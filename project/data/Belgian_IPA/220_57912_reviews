"Rich deep golden colored with an inch thick head of tightly packed off white head.  Brussels lacing. The nose is fairly subdued but I get a bit of the acidic Belgian yeast with a hint of citrus hops.  The taste is intensely bitter citrus hops in the front of the palate.  As it hits the back of the palate you get a bit of that acidic champagne like dry Belgian yeast.  The yeast also provides a nice crisp finish."

""
"Another great job guys.  Enough said."

"You'll forgive me if I say: ""Egg nog?"" A weird spiciness. More wild than Belgian. But I like it."

"This is exactly as advertised. An american IPA mixed with belgian yeast.  The result is an interesting, tasty, and refreshing brew. Improves greatly as it warms"

"Good beer but I like the regular ""Little Sumpin"" better, the hops in this are a little to much and it makes it seem a little out of balance."
""
""
""
"Very disapointed.  Worst of the lil sumpin line"
""
""

"One of the best Belgian IPAs I've had."

"Very good beer, just not my favorite of the little sumpin line."
""
"Pours a nice almost crystal clear medium gold with a nice cap of foamy white head. The head has nice retention and leaves some good lacing. The aroma is lighter, with some nice tropical fruit and floral notes. The taste is a little restrained and comes off just a touch washed out. There is still a nice dank hoppy bite on the finish but the rest of the flavor profile feels like its missing. THe body has a nice weight and there's a good amount of carbonation."
""
""
"Very good flavor in the mouth, though not spectacular. This'll be a good go-to for a party."

"Beer looks very much like a macro, but the scent is awesome, fresh hops and the taste is superb. Lagunitas sure knows how to brew a beer."
""
"Note: when this was first released I detected more nuances of the wild yeast than I did a few weeks later in different packs.  It's not quite as exciting the 2nd or 3rd time around.  It's not a replacement for the lil sumpin', but a great twist nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Lagunitas's sumpin' subtle, floral honey undertones balance the  brewery's characteristic hop profile"
""
""
"This one is just a bit lighter and sweeter than the rest  of the ales from this brewery.  Nice spiced fruit and floral aroma, same for the flavor up front with a smooth sweety and sticky bitter finish. Yet another good one from Lagunitas!"
""
""
"Delicious and lightly fruity Taste"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like this. It does mirror Raging Bitch from Flying Dog. It's just that unique, sour, peppery something with a bite. I'd drink it again."
""
""
""
"I'm close minded so take that into account. Can't get over the Belgian yeast taste. Have to focus with each sip or get a gag reflex. Otherwise not bad."
""
""
""
"Not bad for the high ABV, I'd drink it again.  Good job Lagunitas."
""
""
"Very odd wild flavor...nothing is too distinguishable enough to get a true sense of the brew. Good, not great, drinkable for the abv but my taste buds aren't that impressed. Uneventful as a Belgian IPA or wild ale"
""

"Seriously impressive beer, the belgian yeast does wonders here combined with the fruity and wheaty base. Light upfront florals and citrusy fruit, but then also a great depth of farmhouse yeast, some tropical fruit notes, and spicy earthy notes. Lovely lovely beer, each sip keeps you on your toes and bring new flavours."

"The aftertaste is bitter and almost pithy but without the citrusy element if that makes sense. But also a high note of candi sweet. Also the fact that it's almost 9% is quite evident here."

"Love this beer, brings two great styles crashing together into a wonderful mix"
""
""

"On draft - 12oz in a goblet. Great yeast aroma, fruity, with a good hop finish. A little thin in the middle. Would definitely buy again."
"Bottle, no date. Beer pours a light, cloudy, tan with a frothy white head. Aroma is citrusy Belgian yeast with it's sourdough bread like notes. To be honest my expectations fell at this point, I have never had a Belgian IPA that I really liked, all that changed. Taste is that same Belgian yeast and citrus from appropriately selected hops, but there is a pleasant malty sweetness that makes this beer work. All too often Belgian IPAs end up too dry and the bitterness is poorly balanced and unpleasant, not so here. Great job. Mouthfeel is on point with that nice stickeyness IPAs should have. Again, great beer."

"Overall very drinkable even with the higher ABV.  Very nice balance between a Belgian beer and IPA."
"Cold is this beer's friend.  Drink it quick, it does turn to an off flavor quickly with time.  That being said, it is a fruity hoppy clean crisp beer when cold.  This rating is based on a colder temp."

"If I'm reading the bottle correctly this may have been brewed in May 2014 and I'm seeing it in my area of Frederick, MD for first time in early November 2014 (5-6 months).  Have to say, it is very similar to Flying Dog's Raging Bitch in most all attributes (had a RB just the other day).  Perhaps this one has a tad extra bitterness in finish but overall this is yet another very solid brew from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  No question that it is a Lagunitas brew; and these guys are set up nicely for this style (or mash up).   It has a lot of good interesting stuff going on."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle in Lagunita's mason jar glass.  Poured a golden yellow with a 1 inch frothy head, very well carbonated and leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  The smell for lack of a better term is very Lagunita's, I think all their beers have a certain aroma that clearly defines them.  The taste is slightly sweet and bitter at the same time, sweetness up front then a more bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is terrific, very smooth.  Overall another very good beer by Lagunita's, they really have yet to disappoint me in any of their offerings."
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head glass a very nice dark golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very very nice thick creamy two plus finger head, which leaves some very thick sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, but with a nice malty sweetness thrown in, slightly yeasty, slightly citrusy.. The taste is very nice, hoppy, malty, kinda chewy, and citrusy. Medium body with a nice bitter, slightly dry finish. Overall another very tasty brew from Lagunitas. I'll say it again, and I've said it for years,  for the price it's very hard to beat this brewery."

"O: 4 The aromas are very nice on this beer and it would be much better if the flavors matched the complexity from the nose a bit more. Definitely not a bad beer by any means and it is quite drinkable, however there are more interesting options out there."

"12 oz Bottle.Taste is a grapefruit flavor with a touch of bitterness.ABV is 8.8.I liked this.I goes down really nice.Another one of Lagunitas great brews.Threw back a couple of these last night and they were going down real nice.Give it a try."

"Poured a slightly hazy dark yellow, with a nice inch of head. Nice lacing. Aroma isn't huge, but I get some slight pineapple, a little bit of slight yeasty funk, and some grassy notes. The taste is much bigger than the smell, with lots of pineapple, mango, and biscuit, along with that funky, yeasty flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, with a lot of carbonation to add some good ""bite"" to this beer. The alcohol is very well hidden in this 8.8% beer. Overall, this is another outstanding beer from Lagunitas - as expected."

"Poured into a pint glass, orange due and 1/2 inch head that stays around and sticks to the side. I had just brewed an all Motueka hop IPA that looks almost identical poured, so I have high hopes from the start. Plus, Lagunitas is a great brewery. It still retains a nice hoppy nose although I should have finished off the bottles long ago for a fresher hop flavor. I wasn't expecting a typical west-coast IPA flavor based on the Trappist yeast and knowing it was an attempt at a Belgian version of the regular Little Sumpin', but it remains very west-coast in flavor profile with just bit of the phenolic flavor profile I expected. Still, it is hard to complain when it is absolutely delicious...just not exactly what I expected. Somewhere between fruity and peppery. Nice bite, but not harsh. Overall, well balanced with adequate malt, but finishes appropriately dry. I will definately add this to my regular inventory."

"pours a bit of a golden yellow , slightly unfiltered look. lot of head and lacing. aroma is a bit mild, a little boozy and hoppy, pineapple. the flavor is wonderful, got a lot of bubblegum up front and a pale ale ish quality with the malts. a little salty and tart, grapefruity. overall very nice"
""
""

""

""

"Has a clear golden yellow color, with fluffy white head that holds on nicely. Looks to be well carbonated. Smell is awesome, real spicy smell. Can really pick up on the spice in the taste and it blends well with the citrus, and sweetness. Not a very bitter IPA, with only bitterness at very end. This beer is extremely good. Nice fizzy feel, yet very creamy. Overall this is one great beer form a great brewery. Lagunitas IPAs never seem to disappoint me."
""
""
""

"O- This was a damn good beer. It had huge aromas and flavors, and was extremely well balanced. There was a lot going on, and it all was awesome. I would have again in a heartbeat."

"Comparing this Belgian IPA to likes of Piraat, Wild Ale is much different, resembling more an American IPA. American Hops are evident, with a tad of sweetness. Aroma of molasses, pine, and light fruitiness. Carbonation is high, feels almost like drinking soda. Full bodied, non-existent head. Bitter (pleasant) aftertaste lingers for a little bit. Overall, decent Ale, but was looking forward to try this and it did not meet my expectations."

""
"Trademark aggressive Lagunitas flavor hopping meets a Trappist yeast strain? How could this conceivably suck? Of course it couldn't. In fact is pretty freaking amazing. A peachy orange color, very fizzy, quite cloudy and with a whole shit ton of yeast and hop character on the nose ... Smells AND tastes of sugary caramel malts, saltwater taffy, rye bread, juicy red grapefruit, blood oranges, canned mandarins, pine resin, woody pineapple, and non-descript wildflowers. Spicy phenols abound and remind one of caraway, cumin, and white pepper. These and the strong piney hop resins prevent things from becoming cloyingly sweet, nicely balancing out the influence of the fairly syrupy body and saccharine citrus/tropical flavors. There is a pleasant degree of aromatic alcohol character. I actually brought a few of these to a house party despite figuring that this sort of thing would be too much for most people. In fact two of my good buddies were angry that I did not bring more (""Mmm, boozy pineapple juice""). Apparently a Belgian IPA done right can score new fans and this is a world-class brew, redolent with complexity and yet balanced enough to be drinkable in quantity (but watch the ABV. Seriously)."
"Wonderful surprise and well done. Great balance of the Belgian and American IPA--well integrated. Be careful--drinks like a 6% beer."

"O: hybrid of a Belgian and American IPA - presenting Westmalle's yeast with more American-themed hop character; well-crafted and easy to drink"
""
""
""
"Amazing pour. The pour resembles the woman on the packaging, beautiful, classy, catches the eye and resembles a beautifully crafted beer. Smells like Belgian yeast slightly and has a saison touch to the smell. It's strong pungent aftertaste lends it to be paired well with meats and vegetables. I love the taste and aftertaste of the wild yeast strain. It has a creamy almost elusive bitterness on the tongue. This is a well done beer"
""
"O-Wow. First bottle and I'm jumping in to the rest of the six pack. An experimental palate ride that one will always enjoy. Love the lady on the ""Sumpin'"" bottles. She makes me smile I smile. Belgian IPA's will be the soon popular trend. Gets most points for mouthfeel and complex sensory qualities."
"Overall very nice more balance of ipa and belgian flavors than most I've had. I wish I had It fresh for hops sake but its still great now"
"Though classified as a Belgian IPA, this reminded me more of a Belgian witbier with a moderate, bretty tartness and a slightly hoppy finish. Seeing as this is a summer seasonal, my guess is that this keg had been sat on for a good six months, which allowed the bretty qualities to intensify and the hops to fade. Regardless, this is a very impressive offering from the folks at Lagunitas and one that I will be revisiting when the warmer weather rolls around again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is money! Nice simplicity with the citrus hops and a balanced yeast strain that just explodes in greatness. Not overly complex but well blended flavor profiles create a delicious BIPA that I would purchase frequently. Cheers!"
""
"A different and funky offering from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good overall beer, I think the bitterness lingered a bit long, but the orangey flavors with the funk on the yeast mingled well with the hops. overall a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lots of bitterness and hints of spice, but not as flavorful as the best high ibu ales. Takes a bit of effort for me to get it down. This style has lots of variety but this is not something I'm crazy about. Even Brown Shugga, which I'm not a fan of, has more oomph than this for me. Just okay. I think there are much better options, like Piraat."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O: I really enjoyed this beer. Good balance of the hoppy ipa, with belgian wild funk. I find myself drinking this a bit too fast for a 8+ abv beer, but thats only because its so darn good. I recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer. Definitely on the hoppier side of belgian IPA. Nice balance of bitter hops with the yeast. Yum. Good alternative to the classic IPA flavors."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if the flavor combination works perfectly, but it definitely is very, very interesting, and it doesn't come across bad at all. The worst thing I can say about this beer is that I don't want to drink it every day; it's just odd enough that it becomes a special occasion beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Interesting beer for sure. Nice bitterness and very complex. The dirty citrus/tropical fruit works well against the sweet pale malt. I bought a sixer of this and they got better and better. This is one to seek out."
""
"O - the sweetness that seems apparent in the aroma is restrained, and the finish brings a healthy dose of bitterness. A well balanced version of a Belgian IPA that is recommended."

""

"Wow, what a nice way to approach this recipe. Get one!"

"O - if this wasn't so overly boozy it would be better. I like the flavors, but its too hot and that takes a lot away from it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Belgian IPA may be a fairly new style, but I would call this a pretty definitive (and delicious) example of one."
""
""
""
"As stated before, I have held this in high regard for a long time so my review may be a bit biased. But this hides the 8.8% abv like nobodies business and is drinkable to boot. I would highly recommend this to any IPA fan as it is sure not to disappoint. True to style and worth revisiting. I'm stocked up, but will be sad to see this go out of season."

"Overall i thought this was a really cool beer to come from the sumpin series. loved the mango aroma too....that really got me. just a very big beer. a little bit of maltiness mellows the bang of hops you get through out...and keeps you coming back for more. yet another good beer put out by Lagunitas. Pretty similar to the ""sumpin sumpin ale""... Anybody who appreciates a west coast style hoppy, bitter bomb of a beer. this DIPA is for you."
""
""
"PS. The yeast flavors are more apparent after this beer warms, therefore I'm adjusting my ratings accordingly."
""
"O: not as ""sweet"" as most Lagunitas, a more down to earth (pun intended) offering. Was just what I was looking for today, will have to remember this is different from ""any other Lagunitas"" offering.  Edit: agree with this statement,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: All in all this is a pretty decent beer, the bitterness is fairly assertive but is balanced out by the malt. The Belgian character adds a nice fruitiness and a twist right when you think you have figured this beer out."
""

"Found this at a small liquor store up the street. I was already a Lagunitas fan. Had high expectations for this beer and was not disappointed. Nice appearance, good foamy head. About one finger. Smells of a familiar IPA, citrusy and lemony. Just like a good summer beer should. Tastes hoppy as soon as it hits the tongue. Some spice and sourness mixed here. We'll bodied and very drinkable. Overall this beer is going to be a favorite of mine. Not as good as hop devil, but that's in my top 5."

"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay goblet, generates some short head that levels down pretty quickly. Beer is totally clarified and effervescing from the etching at the bottom of the goblet. The nose on this is very interesting. There's candied citrus fruit as well as pine and then some yeasty funk. There is no detectable alcohol on the nose, but pushing nine percent, definitely has a tiny bite to it and a warming quality. Certainly not overpowering though, and seems to be blending in with the hop bitters almost seamlessly. Flavor is citrusy-sweet, some peachiness, mango, and certainly a grapefruit-like bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly sticky, with adequate carbonation. Overall, I like the fruit-funk and hop-citrus combo, and I think this is well done for the style. If anything, I'd like more funkiness to it, but I think they took it to a good place regardless. Nice!"

"Overall: A great beer. I wish I had a couple more of the same style to really compare, because this one is so good. I might adjust the scores when I have a bit more of this style under my belt, but a slightly different take on a style I'm getting pretty use to. (IPA) so that makes it a very refreshing change-up."

"O: Lagunitas is just like Motorhead - they tend to always taste/sound the same from beer to beer/album to album, but when that taste/sound is so damn good, it really doesn't matter. Yes, this is just another hoppy Lagunitas beer. And I don't care, because this is really damn good."

"Pours a fairly clear light golden color with a huge fluffy bone white head that persists forever. Smells of lemon and spice with a bit of pepper, grass, hay, and earth. Light bready wheat malt pulls it altogether. The flavor is quite resinous with grass hay citrus and pine. Light pepper and yeasty phenols with a hint of light sugar. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous almost chalky mouthfeel. Meh. too many contrasting flavors for my palette. The yeasty phenols and the resinous hop treatment are left unchecked by too light of a malty base. This didn't work for me."

"I have had the Little Sumpin several times so I was waiting to see what this little extra WILD thing did. For me, it do not do what I was hoping for. It still was a good brew, a nice amount of hops, the nice was malty/citrus was was very special. The first taste, it had a good amount of hops, but as I was drinking it, the malt start coming through loud and clear. Enjoyable, but not exactly what I was hoping for."
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice Belgian IPA. Tasty and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall (4.5/5): A Little Sumpin' Wild is another excellent Lagunitas beer. The hops, yeast, and malt fire on all cylinders, making this the best Belgian-style IPA that I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-definitely a Lagunitas beer. Big west coast hoppy beer with a very minor Belgian influence. A bit too west coast IPA (bitter pine resin taste) for me. But this is a damn flavorful beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not great. Worth a shot. Would have preferred this as a 22 ounce bomber instead the six pack I purchased. Whatever, I'll drink them happily."
"Overall, another excellent beer from Lagunitas. However, this is a slight departure in style- a Belgian IPA. Westmalle yeast, and more maltiness to the beer."
""
""
""
"O: This is a great combo. A west coast master of IPA meets the Belgian style. I like the richness of it, and the warmth that the booze provides. In fact, it tastes like it's more than the 8% ABV posted above. It's a sipping beer, whereas most of the other Lagunitas beers are so good you don't realize how fast you drink them. Not this one. Wild seems a little more mature and sophisticated than its siblings. I really enjoyed this rich and complex ale."
"Everything I always wanted Little Sumpin' Sumpin' to be: little sweeter and more kick. Worthy of a case as I expect it will sit well. Says it is a summer release. Currently late summer and this is perfect for bringing in the fall. On my second bottle. Cheers."

" This is the kind of stuff which I will never write, as I am a beer drinker, not a beer connoisseur (actually I had to look up the spelling on that word). But I contend, nevertheless, based on 50 years of beer drinking experience, that this is one not to be missed."
""
""
""

"O: This is a great spinoff of the already wonderful Pale Ale. Not sour like I had expected, but bitter with the flashy cloves and hops that a Belgian IPA should have. Certainly a hallmark for the style. 10/10 will drink again!"

"Overall - This is another very solid effort by Lagunitas. It is not my favorite effort from them, but it is very drinkable."
"O: Very well made, very enjoyable beer"

"Overall worth waiting for. Easily the best Belgian IPA I've had. Lots of tropical aromas and flavor. Masterfully balanced, true to Lagunitas fashion. Clean, refreshing, big flavor. Alcohol is hidden well. If you like Lagunitas or Belgian IPAs or just great beer buy as much of this as you can when you see it"

"This isn’t a “wild ale” in terms of being soured or with bacteria added, it’s more of a Wild take on the original brew. There are no sour flavors or funkiness in that regard although the trappist yeast thrown into the mix does give off hints of a slight funk. The Wild poured a golden amber with a substantial fluffy white head. There were loads of the signature citrusy Lagunitas hops on the nose with a bit of funk underneath from the Belgian yeast. The taste was big juicy citrus and fruit hops with Belgian yeast flavors coming through on the end. The Westmalle yeast gave it a bit of funk though not to the Brett levels, but nicely undertoned and complementary to the juicy hops. Loving this one!"

"I like the regular Sumpin more but this may be available in a keg so I'm test driving tonight. I'm a Belgian IPA rookie so the wild yeast strain does take a bit getting used to. It kind of tastes like a really really good Blue Moon. The color, body and hop profile are typical Lagunitas which is always a good thing. Definitely worth a sixer and maybe a keg. Now I've got to score a lucky13 since that comes in kegs too."

"I had this for the first time last night. I have always liked the beers from Lagunitas. They do a great job with their hops and consistency. Although I liked this beer, it was tough for me to notice the ""wild"" or ""belgian"" influence. To me the beer tasted similar to the other IPAs (which are really good) they make and didn't have the wild yeast characteristics. I was expecting spice, clove, bubble gum, etc and although I could tell there was something different about this one, the hop profile seemed to just dominate the entire beer. So, in all, the beer was really enjoyable, it just didn't have the ""wild"" character I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours slightly hazy golden color with finger width foamy head.  Head retention is decent.  Mild lacing.  Has a deep citrus aroma with hints of Belgian yeasts and slight hoppiness.  Hop forward taste, ending in a bitter, citrus, Belgian yeast malt.  Nice bitter aftertaste.  Slightly soapy.  Very good beer.  This may be an improvement on last year's release."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: Tasty and easy drinking wild ale with well-hidden high ABV. Not my favorite Lagunitas but a very good one."
""
""
"Poured a golden yellow with a big creamy head. Lots of lace on the glass. Smells of citrus and candy, maybe bubble gum, a good smell. Mouth feel is both bitter and sweet, very sharp. The flavor is grapefruit and spice from the hops and the yeast respective. This brew is much more on the Belgium side of ales. Very funky in in the taste department , from the wild yeast."

"Another great hoppy beer from Lagunitas. I really dig their hop profile."

""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
"Overall: Glad I was able to try this one. I probably like the regular Sumpin' a little better, but this was a cool take on the beer."
""
""
""
"I can appreciate a strong hop focus, but sometimes it just gets to be too much. I think that is the case here. The hop characteristics are so aggressive against the rest of the beer, that it just pushes everything out of balance."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall not as ipa like as I'm used to with even a Belgian ipa, still, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an orange brown, with a 1-2 finger head. The head retreats fairly quickly, but leaves some real lacing behind. Smell hits like a regular belgian, though the hop is a lot easier to notice. In taste it's fairly complex. A wall of yeast hits first, followed by a big hit of hops and bitterness. Alcohol is certainly not hidden in this beer. It provides characteristic warming, but also seems to be a bit punchier than I am used to. Alcohol is more of a flavor than a sensation, if that makes sense. The beer is not too heavy in the mouth. I think it's a little smoother than most American IPAs. Overall it's a delicious beer--I'm really starting to warm up to Lagunitas, and it's not just due to the high alcohol content of their beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid belgian ipa, a great concept using the sumpin sumpin base, very good belgian flavors with keeping the strong hop and wheat base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A lot better than what I was expecting. Certainly not as wild by wild ale standards, but a nice twist on the standard IPA. Hop lovers should be happy, as hops certainly dominate but not overwhelm."
""
""
""
"Two of my favorite beers meet at last, to gleefully great results. The dried citrus/wheat profile of Little Sumpin' Sumpin' combines very well with the spiciness and funkiness from the Westmalle yeast, making this very tropical, zesty, and complex overall. The aftertaste goes on forever on this thing. I'd drink it more often if it weren't so goddamn boozy overall - well hidden booziness, at that - but this is better and way more closer to style than most American made officially titled ""tripels"" brewed in the country. Great stuff - I'll always seek this out when I get the chance."
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow in color with a slight haze. Poured with a dense white foam that very slowly reduced to a soapy cap that left huge sticky sheets on the glass. Belgian yeast and sweet malt and spicy aromas down the middle with sharp tropical fruit aromas on the edges and a touch of banana sweetness beneath. Medium bodied with rich, lazy carbonation that tapers to a slick oily finish. Flavor is similar to aroma. Solid bready, sweet malty backbone throught. Intense pugent hop flavors through the middle that turn tropical at the end. A touch of banana sweetness at the finish followed by lingering tropical and pine hop bitterness. A wide variety of aromas and flavors with that signature Lagunitas spicy, malty sweetness."

"Overall (4.0): As I’ve noted in other Belgian IPA reviews, I have a theory that there are a handful of different formulas that brewers use to create beers that are then classified as “Belgian IPAs”—the hopped-up BSPA/Tripel, the hopped-up saison, the American IPA brewed with Belgian or nominally “farmhouse” yeast, and occasionally you see a hoppy Belgian Pale, Belgian Amber, or even a Dubbel. This is, I think, about as good as the “American IPA brewed with Belgian yeast” example of the style gets. The malt and hop character are classic American DIPA in character; the only real difference is the Westmalle yeast, which Lagunitas manages to wrangle into this beer pretty effectively. For me, it’s still not close to the best of the “Belgian IPA” style (I prefer the hopped-up BSPA/Tripel formula, personally) but for the American IPA w/ Belgian yeast formula, this is easily one of the best examples. Add the pricetag and bang for your buck factor, and this beer is hard to beat."
""
""
""
""
"O - At 8.8%, this is dangerously drinkable. There is no hint of the alcohol. Just an easy to drink, tasty, refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average. Definitely worth a try for those who like yeast bombs. And if you don't, you still might want to give it a go."
""
""
""
"Overall- a fantastic example of a Belgian ipa brewed by a west coast brewer. I really enjoyed this beer ."
""
""
""
"O- I reckon for what this beer brings to the table, it's a real bargain for what I paid for it and it is super fresh. IMHO, a very authentic Belgian IPA. Well done, Lagunitas."
""
""
"overall its like a souped up lil sumpin. I like it a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very good beer, but I'll stick with the other fantastic IPA's that Lagunitas puts out!"
""
""
""
""
""
"While not a bad beer that DOES hide it's alcohol extremely well, it doesn't live up to its 'wild' name and is likely not a beer I'll be grabbing again. Pity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I prefer the regular version with its crisp and cleanness. This is an interesting spin on the beer at least."
""
""
"O - This almost feels like I'm drinking two beers, or even three. I like each of the flavors, but it almost seems like they are trying to one-up each other for my attention. I like strong IPA characteristics and subtle Belgian-style characteristics. This one, while certainly flavorful, is a bit to in-your-face."
""
"O - Great Belgian IPA. Highlights tropical fruit hops with just enough Belgian character to balance it out. Drinks dangerously easy for an 8.8 % beer."
""
"O - Another great beer from Lagunitas. I'll be grabbing more while it's still available"

"D - I don't know if Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Sumpin' actually plays any role here other than namesake; but I suppose I should admit I've never tried that brew as it isn't distributed in my parts. This strikes as a brew where the bitterness outweighs the actual flavor, which I'm never much a fan of. Still, this was definitely worth a try, and had a somewhat unique profile to my palate. Would have maybe liked more Belgian character, but what can ya do."
""
""
""
"A lot going on here, but sort of a mess. I didn't think Belgian IPA meant pouring Hop Stoopid into a Westmalle Tripel, but that's what this feels like. Some nice flavors, but at times it seems like they just collide rather than compliment."
""
""
"O: Enjoyable and easy to drink with the alcohol being mostly well hidden and a very pleasant mouthfeel. Glad I grabbed this one and yet another impressive beer from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice for this style. A higher IBU then I usually enjoy, but very nice flavor as always from Lagunitas. Nice color in the glass with a wonderful aroma after a gentle pour. The taste balance was suprising and quite tasty. Looking forward to seeing it on the shelf again."
"O - Overall, This is yet another great beer from Lagunitas. Not as great as Maximus by any means, but definitely easy drinking and great tasting for the ABV. You can definitely tell that the Westmalle yeast strain was used in this as the flavors consistantly and shallowly remind you that it is in fact of Belgian descent. I'd definitely have this one again."
""
""
""
"Very nice, but there's a slight mineral/astringency profile that dampens my enthusiasm a bit. And...the more it warms, the more I'm into it. Probably served too cold."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd have to say that I do prefer the original, but this brew is still tasty and unique, and definitely worth a try."
"Overall - A unique Belgian IPA by Lagunitas. I found it a little more difficult to identify the yeast strain in this one (compared to other Belgian IPAs). Great hop flavour."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good bordering on great belgian IPA. Worth getting fresh if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A special, flavorful and fine Belgian style ale, with an exceptionally strong malt base. It is reminiscent of, but not as satisfying to me, as the superb Lagunitas Lucky 13 Anniv. Ale I had last night."

"Overall - The little sumpin wild is definitely packs a punch. It also has one of the highest ABV's of any Ale I have ever had. It also was more of a hoppy ale which I enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
"This was very good, in fact just about great and so easy to drink. I thought that the yeast would be stronger based on the “wild” in the name, but this was near perfect for a Belgian IPA."
""
"I usually frown on sweet IPAs, as the blend of sweetness and intense bitterness always seems medicinal to me. This one has nice balance and the sweetness is almost overwhelmingly pineapple-like, which strikes me as very pleasant. Like a Belgian tripel with a shot of pineapple juice in it. Quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice full hops flavors have some good support from the yeast even though it is a bit hidden. The hops are bright and dry without being juicy which gives a nice twist on the flavor. Very sessionable."
""
""
""
"Poured into a DF tulip glass, clear light golden with a small frothy white head. Smell is lemony, some grapefruit from the iPa, Belgian, yeasty, and clove from the yeast. This is just awesome, as it warmed a little from the fridge the favors mellowed out. Great Belgian ipa, perfect balance of belgin yeast and hoppy west coast. Rivals Stone Cali-Belgique, if you see it grab it, especially at the price."
"O: I'm not very big on this style of beer, but this is nice. Well balanced, pretty tasty, and the alcohol is hidden."
""
""

"Palatable without being weak; it worked its magic, warming, but not overheating the atmosphere in the room. That would come later. The taste had hints of IPA's, visions of Saison's, and prayers of Trappist Monks, all combined perfectly, and packaged neatly into 22 pure fluid ounces. With the most noteworthy aspect of this beer being its smell, even that continued, flowing seamlessly into the taste, adding to it, and even remaining behind, long after being swallowed..."
""
""
""
"O: Bitters and funk kissed with a little sweetness, chased by a pine tree. Plenty going on and possible more than necessary for some tastes."
"Overall, a pretty good Belgian IPA. The mouthfeel is a little sticky for me but the alcohol is well hiddent and the flavors nicely balanced. A real enjoyable beer."
"O: an interesting beer because of all of the sour fruit tastes, not something you'll want to drink by the gallon though, could use more malt to sweeten and balance."
""
"*I had to reduce the mouthfeel score to give the right letter grade to this beer. I do this to keep my reviews fair and consistent. Please see my profile for more information."
""
""
"Poured into a 13 tulip glass. Pours a clear orange yellow, with a two inch fluffy white head, that leaves plenty of lace. Smell clove, cut grass, citrus, and some hints of hard candy. Taste is very different from most of this style, equal IPA and belgian and that is what I love. Starts with the clove and finishes with the citrus and some grapefruit. Body is medium large for the style, plenty of carbonation, a little dry in the finish, and very approachable. This is really nice, one of my favorites in its style. Excellent price as always. Lagunitas had been in my fridge often lately!"

"O-huge hop flavor but malt provides a nice backbone. haven't had a ton of belgian IPA's, but definitely enjoyed this beer."
""
"O: This is a delicious beer. It has wonderful malt and hop flavors that are great on their own but balance very well together and the mouthfeel is exactly what it should be. I would definitely purchase this again."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation that is medium to high. This results in a mouthfeel that is prickly at first, eventually fading to a pleasantly tingling feeling across the palate that melds well with the attendant bitterness and ethanol burn. Ethanol present in nostrils and mild burning on back of throat, perhaps a bit too high, even for an 8.8% beer. Aftertaste is expectedly dry, from the substantial hopping and ethanol presence. There is also some substantial stickiness around the corners of the lips."
""
"O-Really nice IPA. The Belgian yeast adds a subtle funkiness and complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer, and a great American-made Belgian-style IPA. The hops are balanced very nicely with citrus, yeast, and a bit of malt while remaining highly bitter and pungent - truly a hard combination to pull off, especially this well."
""

"This is a pretty tasty beer, very bitter though. I'd say the regular little sumpin sumpin is a fair bit better."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Almost white head, high retention on a slightly hazy, golden body. Suddsy lacing, receding to reveal oily clear, sticky resinous lacing. Double barreled lacing? Cool. Aroma is a beautiful fruity, citrusy grapefruit with some malty sweetness, candi sugar and belgian yeasty goodness. Taste is wonderfully hopped, piney and grapefruit, mild sweetness with a fruity, yeasty. Ever so slight alcohol presence, amazing for 8.8%. Tongue coating mouthfeel. I guess this beer is the result of mixing two of the worlds best things, pacific northwest hops and belgian yeast."

"Based on the name, I was initially expecting something like a Flemish wild ale, but this is most definitely a distinctive, complex, and extremely well-balanced IPA. A wild and outstanding beer; one that every IPA casual fan and connoisseur should experience at least once..."

"O- The best BIPA that I've had to date."
""
""
"The great thing about Lagunitas is the fact they really strive for a balanced beer now matter what the style. This is hoppy and big as expected but the Belgian yeast strain adds some funk to the beer that blends with the IPA profile. I loved the long finish that was hoppy yet yeasty . Very unique from other Belgian IPAs and way too drinkable for the ABV."
""
"Overall: Nice and solid BIPA. Very little to complain about this beer other than the huge hop bomb that gives this beer a lot of bitterness. I like it, but fan see how some might not."
"Overall: a very tasty beer. Easy to drink and well balanced. A nice change up from the standard version of the beer."
"O: Overall nice grains base, balanced hoppiness with a spicy bite of hops and zesty bite of carbonation that brings things to life. Solid recommend and repeat, very good overall."
""
"Overall I am very pleased with this brew. I love IPA's and to me this takes a solid DIPA and adds another layer of enjoyment. This is my favorite from Lagunitas thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Definitely one of my preferred beers, and one I’ll come back to. A great Belgian IPA, nice and hoppy with added complexity from the spices/pepper/fruit. Vundaba."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good balance between the IPA and Beglian flavors. A little bit drier and more complex than the regular Little Sumpin'."
""
""
"O - This is a good Belgian IPA. It doesn't wow me, but it also doesn't have any of the off flavors I am sensitive to and usually pick up in this style. It is sweet, grassy, and fruity with drinkability high. I won't throw this in my regular roation, but for $5/bomber you can't go wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Super great brew. Lagunitas has really made something special happen with the Westmalle Yeast. Their knowledge of hops and yeast really combine well, and make a truly special, unique brew."
""
""
""
"Watta beer. I'm surprised no one has mentioned the clove taste/aroma. This beer almost tastes like a good Belgian and even has some heffe taste going on with it. Not a beer easy to lump into one distinct style IMO. Complex brew. Great tasting and great smelling brew. I would highly recommend it. Has that clove/coriander/cardamom/yeasty finish of a good Trappist ale. A ""must try beer," to say the least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn’t have much of a problem going through the entire bottle, and I did sip on this for an hour or two. The only nit-pic I have is that it was little too sweet and the carbonation was a bit too minimal. I have to state that I did enjoy this beer for what it was and all the interesting characteristics together and I enjoyed comparing the differences between this and the regular Sumpin’ Ale. Overall, a good Belgian IPA that I would personally have to classify as a double IPA/Tripel/German Hefeweizen. I would recommend this to anybody who really enjoys the year-round available “A Little Sumpin’ Sumpin’ Ale."
""
"O- Enjoyable to say the least. There is no way in hell that you can beat 3.99 bombers from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Phenomenal aroma, I could sniff this for hours. Wonderfully resiny mouthfeel. Hard to imagine something better than this in those categories."
""
""
"Poured a brilliant, medium-deep gold color with a barely perceptible haze. Off-white, creamy, 1-inch head forms, settles slowly, but persists at 1/4 inch. Beautiful, well-developed Belgian lace after each sip. The nose intermingles yeasty notes with distinct hops, tropical fruit, citrus, wood, and cloves. Light and delicious on the palate with excellent balance that hides the 8.8% ABV, but don't be fooled. The ABV is there! Lingers well but leaves a clean palate with hints of hop flavors, hop-bitterness, citrus, and cloves. Moderate carbonation with tiny bubbles. Expected more sourness given the ""wild"" descriptor, however, it is delicious! The moreishness increases as it rises to/above cellar temperature. Would be excellent with rich or fatty foods needing to be balanced with the increasingly evident hop."

"I chose a Duvel tulip for the occasion of this session, and A Little Sumpin' Wild Ale looked very nice in it, with the clear orange body,, and a two finger thick head. The aroma was not exactly wild, but it was very edgy due to the aggressive hop presence, which asserted itself as papaya, pine, tangerine, and mango. The taste was not sweet like the aroma hinted at. Instead the beer was dry, tart, and smooth, with just a touch of radish like spiciness in the finish. Very delicate in the feel, and very sneaky in the alcohol expression, this was like a dirty Duvel. I like the unusual combination of characteristics that work in this creation."
""
""
"O-delicious belgian IPA, good flavor and balance"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"ok, so little sumpin was a great beer.. looks like all they really did was change the yeast, which honestly made it a completely different beast. well done lagunitas!"
""
""
"Love the whole Belgo-American movement, love Lagunitas as well. Very well balanced, Westmalle yeast battles dank hop in a higher alcohol arena ... everything a growing palate needs. Giving this brew a hearty HELL YEAH!"
""
"a decent brew, special yeast. pours a radiant bronze color, with an erupting off white head that stopped just short of needing to be frantically slurped. it smells like belgian yeast, west coast hops, and some fuller bodied malts. the flavor is pungent bitter hops, and rubbing alcohol in the finish. chemically almost at the end. the malt provides a huge amount of body, but only a touch of sweetness. lots of nonfermentable sweetness to this one. the yeast is of course very interesting. ive never had the beer that made this yeast famous, but i can imagine it now. spicy and complex, dry and ancient. the feel is decent, good body on the fuller side, and a little less carbonated than it should be, despite the head. maybe it just relaxes too quickly, im not sure. finish stays bitter for awhile. overall a clever brew, something ive come to expect from lagunitas, but this isnt as good as i expected it to be with the yeast. the west coastness of this beer overwhelms it."

"O - Loving this beer. You can taste the belgian influence & the sumpin' wild in it."
""
"Overall: A really great version of a Belgian IPA. Good citrus hop flavor that is balanced well by the Belgian yeast. Complex and tasty."
""
"Strong aroma is quite hoppy, more like an IPA, with fruity and yeasty hints. Pours a clear, bubbly, golden amber with a very thick and rather persistent pale cream head. Flavor is rich and hoppy with an evergreen undertone - is this a Belgian, or an Imperial IPA? Doesn’t matter; it’s delicious! Has fruity, floral and yeast hints as well. Texture has good body and lots of sass and fizz. Catch this wild ’un whilst you can!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color not a lot of head but a nice ring around the glass as I drink it down. Smells great hops, some sweetness could just smell this all day but i'd rather drink it :) Got a nice hop bite and bitterness with the belgian sweetness also shining through. Mouth feel is great hop aftertaste lingers and easy, easy drinking. Got the last 6er of this at my local bottle shop wish there were a few more pack left lol"
"I'll drink this beer anytime."
""
""
"""Belgian IPAs"" are always a bit strange, but can sometimes be enjoyable. The Belgian yeast esters are just too strong here and make it a confusing beer."

""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A cloudy pour, looks like a belgian ipa should, bonus points for the crazy amount of lace. Smell has a big rush of lemon and banana, big belgian yeast character, nice hoppiness. The taste is identical, huge belgian flavor upfront and then an awesome wave of grapefruit and mango wash over the palate on the finish. Love this beer, love this brewery."
""
""
"Color is a light amber to gold; the head is dense with outstanding retention, and lots of lacing left behind. The smell is packed with delicious tropical citrus scents - grapefruit, mango, pineapple. The taste is as hopped-up as the smell suggests. Juicy, tart citrus flavors stand out, while a slight alcohol taste is present but not overwhelming. It strikes a great balance. A memorable drinking experience, and I will definitely look to buy this one again."
"Drinking this with my corn dog Amanda whilst eating ice cream. Weird combo, I know. But we just got done watching midget wrestling. So it's cool. Pours up clear orange with a decent white head. Aroma is huge of floral hops. Niiiice. Tastes bitter, honey, grapefruit, not too much hop flavor as much as there is hop bitterness. Nice again. Medium bodied, smooth drinkin. I dig"
""
"It pours a semi-clear, amber color with a fluffy, well retained white head. The scent is yeast with a mix of hops and banana. The taste is smooth and inviting. It starts off sweet from the malts, banana, and citrus but finishes slightly dry, bitter and chalky. This is overall tasty yet complex ale from Lagunitas."
""
"Orange in color with some haze to it. The head like a thick foam the subsides very slowly, leaving tons of lacing. Lots of tropical fruit in the nose with a sweet and sour tone. Pineapples come to mind. There seems to be some floral notes as well. Very aromatic. Bitter citrus, sweet tropical fruit, floral undertones, Belgian yeast and a little alcohol warmth come together nicely. Mouth fell is good. Its medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is sharp and tingly. A great beer to be had. Lagunitas has yet to let me down. At 5 dollars a bomber you can't beat it. I would by it again if i saw it on shelves."
"O- Glad I finally picked it up. This is an excellent beer for the style. Complex, yet solid. This is a must try imo. Not more needs to be said than that. Cheers."
"Overall: A really good beer- another example of how great Belgian-style IPAs are."
""
""
"Highly drinkable given the ABV. I'd never turn this one down."
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Light carbonation."
""
""
"Overall: Tastes more like a regular IPA than a Belgian one to me, but still very enjoyable."
"O- nice variation of regular little sumpin. Belgian yeast has nice spice and some light funkiness."
""
"D: definitely a good beer, just not blown away here. hoppy while remaining rather belgian. not much more for me to say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: To me, the Belgian IPA style is all about harmony between the two distinct aspects of the beer: the American hops and the Belgian yeast. It's a fine line to walk, and it's easy for one or the other to steal the show. This beer doesn't quite achieve that harmony. It starts out well with a nice, playful, tasty hop profile, but then the yeasty Belgian aspects tread a little too heavily. The bite of clove, pepper, and spice just seems too harsh and out of place. A pretty decent beer, but it just doesn't quite get there for me."
""
""
""
""
"O- A great variation one of my favorite styles. Lagunitas makes some great IPAs and this is definitely one of my favorites"
""
"Pours a clear orange-yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A latticework of tiny dots and foamy rings of lace of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild citrus zest bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel with a minor notice of the alcohol. Overall, an unusual but tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great variation one of my favorite styles. Lagunitas makes some great IPAs and this is definitely one of my favorites"
""
"O - This stuff is delicious and extremely drinkable. The Belgian element is a bit subdued but pleasant nonetheless. This is definitely one of the better examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"M. Creamy and nice coats your mouth that tends to stick with you all night."
"O-I enjoyed this brew. It is more fleshy than many Belgian IPAs I have had, which is both good and bad. Its good if you (like me) like fruity, tropical hops, but bad if you want something a little more concentrated."
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes of biscuit malt, light orange peel and Bretty yeastiness, and extensive herbal / grassy hopping with a dab of drying hotness and band-aid plastic in the finish. I'm just... not sure what about this beer deserves the adjective 'wild', amazing appearance notwithstanding."
""
""
"Another great beer enjoyed at My Place in Newtown, CT, this one is a clear pale gold color with a nice puffy cover of white and energeticly blanketed with lacing. The aroma brings a lovely floral and slight pine hop element with sweet fruit nougat/taffy and polite yeast biscuit. The flavor comes on with very similar combinations, light yet on the heavy side of medium bodied with very delicate carbonation and a somewhat dry but smooth feel. Very easy drinking despite a subtle trace of alcohol wheat. Very nice stuff, a no brainer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops are citrus-y, floral and delicious, if a little weak. It is well balanced against the sweetness, though, which doesn't cloy. Maybe a bit more carbonated than I prefer an IPA to be, but still a good mouthfeel. Overall, very strong, though the knowledge that A Little Sumpin' Wild exists out there does diminish my enjoyment a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nicely done Belgian IPA with a great American twist. The hops aren't too bitter or overly done, but simply add a great, refreshing citrusy aspect to the beer. Definitely worth a shot before this great weather goes away"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Straight 4s, though it probably deserves a slight bump somewhere. Great example of the style and recommended, though I still prefer the 'vanilla' Little Sumpin' Sumpin'."
"O: a good ipa all in all although not my style of beer. Obvious citra hops in there, but Ladunitas loves the C hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, golden-yellow coloring with a filmy, sparse, white film coating parts of the surface. Aromas of bubble gum, lilac, and chamomile ride a subtle toffee backbone. Flavors are sharply roasted, with a very spice dominant forward flavor, both from the hops and the yeast strains. Bombardments of pepper and basil from the hops combine with off the wall characteristics of licorice, xantham gum, lemon zest, and cedar. This beer is very tasty, and very ""all over the place," for lack of a better term. The body is smooth, but fairly light and crisp. The aftertaste is has some fruity characteristics, with touches of citrus and tropical fruits trying to balance all the different spiced components. Carbonation keeps the finish light, and slightly filmy, with a spicy linger that continues to puzzle and challenge the tastebuds. Tasty and interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is some damn good beer; it has balance, fantastic flavor, and fantastic complexity. it reminds me a lot of piraat and for a hell of a lot cheaper. well done Lagunitas! at 3.99 a bomber buy some today!!!"
"O: The is an excellent Belgian IPA having all the hops flavor, bitterness and malt support I love from the Lagunitas usual line up while adding the fruit and spice from the Belgian yeast. This would be a great beer to enjoying as a compliment to some bold Thai or Indian curry."
""
"O: Very, very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- No question that this is the 'big sister' of a Lil' Sumpin, Sumpin Ale! Whoever in the world is a fan of Belgian Pale Ales who has yet to experience one hopped with an American sensibility, then this is your ticket. An amazing blending of (Westmalle) Trappist yeast and the hoppiness only a West Coast brewery can seem to deliver. Awesome!"

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/6/2012. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a thick cap that lasts. Some nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon, pepper, clove, banana, bubblegum, honey, caramel, earth, and herbal spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, pepper, clove, light banana, pine, lemon, and herbal spiciness. Nice amount of peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, clove, banana, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of spicy yeast flavors with hop flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish; extremely smooth to sip on. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian IPA. Fantastic yeast character and hop flavor balance; and very crisp and smooth to sip on. Wow, outstanding."
"Nose is pine right up front. Grapefruit, maybe something like green onion, lemon and some really grassy notes wrapping it all up. Taste is citrus, grassy, grapefruit, some sweetness that is almost honey like. The bitterness makes the mouth pucker in a good way and it lingers around filling your mouth with piney flavors. There's a slight warming in the stomach from the ABV, but there's no heat or booziness in the taste. This is a damn fine brew. Pretty unique while remaining familiar to hopheads."

"O - A drinkable beer with a ""wild"" touch. Lagunitas hit the title head on, and while I feel it is inferior to the original, it is a fair change of pace."
""
"O - a very well-done Belgian IPA, I appreciate the subtleness of the belgian yeast. I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good Belgian IPA much better then most in this style which tend to be Belgian yeast bombs IMO, but still I wish the yeast was a little more subdued.... Nicley rounded and drinkable, I'm sure if you enjoy Belgian IPA you would love this one."
""
""
"Smells like a pine tree from a foot away - a nice change of pace to a traditional IPA. Pours brown with some ruby. Excellent lacing on the glass. Flavor has some caramel on top of the pine. Maybe some parsley and other spices. The more I drink it the more I think it's somewhere between an IPA and a saison."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is fantastic, Lagunitas rules."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pineapple/tropical fruits in the nose, well rounded flavor and balance, slight alcohol warmth, with a citrus hopiness. I wish this beer was more available because it really is a great spin on the style. Wonderful and delicious! I'm never disappointed with lagunitas."
"O- Good Belgian IPA. Hops come through nicely to mix in with the Belgian flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it strangely doesn't really remind me of a Belgian, it's sort of an odd strong ale hoppy beer from another planet, but I guess it does have ""some"" Belgian character to it, but it really feels like something very unique. Nice job, very memorable."
""
""
""
"O: I don't remember if I had it last year, but I wasn't prepared for how good this is! I love it! Not the most balanced Belgian IPA (leans more towards an American West Coast IPA) but there's enough of a change to make it really interesting."
"This pours a cloudy hazy gold color with light foam. There’s an intriguing distinctively floral aroma which is contrasted by an unexpected bitterness on the flavor (unexpected from how it smells, not from knowing that it’s a Lagunitas brew). The bitterness almost defines the flavor profile, like a sharp peak around which everything else—the floral notes, the underlying funkiness, and a wheated smoothness—rest. Light, effervescent, interesting."
"O- Yes lagunitas does a lot of hoppy beers. And yes, they do them very, very well."
""
"This is the beer that turns believers into non-believers. Profound yet exploratory. fell me. Other wise the appearence is a cloudy light orange configuration that exhibits near unforgetable tones of grapefruit and clove!!! Perfectly balanced perfectly unbalanced glory.!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Buy some."
""
"O- A genre bender for sure, a great seasonal release to savor."
""
"Overall - Gotta be honest... I really didn't taste much of a difference between the Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and this, until I tried them side by side. The reg is sharper, with a bigger citrus bite. This is more mellow, with huge green banana character."
""
""
""
"This seems a bit of a hybrid to me. There are definitely Belgian tones here, but they are subdued and smooth and not overly showy, besides a somewhat pronounced yeasty thing. The other side of this (opposite the Belgian one) are the distinct hoppy tones. Which I guess would make this...a Belgian IPA. Just my opinion. And a pretty nice one too; except it's a bit boozy."
""
""
"Pours a clear medium orange amber. Citrus hops with a hint of pineapple and orange aroma. A typical DIPA flavor profile, citrus and hops with some tropical fruit flavors. Belgian yeast overwhelmed by the hops. A sweet, hoppy finish. Very pleasant, but not really noticeably different from other DIPAs. A stronger Belgian influence would have made this stand out a bit more. I can't taste it. Very nice and worth a revisit."

"The scent of this beer is wonderful - a definite belgian note without being overpowering. The brew is well balanced and keep you wanting more. Once I get my friends drinking hoppy beers I slip them one of these to introduce them to Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured a light copper with a single-finger head that lasted for a while. The smell is a big citrusy grape-fruit hop note with a bit of grassiness. The taste starts with some sweet apricot that gives way to the grapefruit flavor that's got more than a bit of the rind in it. The mouthfeel is slightly thick. Overall an interesting next step from a Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and a beer I would have trouble ever not recommending someone try."
""
""
""
""
"Given that this beer is probably 6 months older than it should be, it held up remarkably well. I'll have to look for a fresh one as soon as its released again, just to compare and contrast, but I didn't find anything missing here. I'm assuming that Lagunitas was going for a hoppier ale than what's in my glass, but I've tasted a lot of so-called Belgian IPA's that taste worse."
"O: Just not on the level I wanted it to be. Need to try it fresh to pass final judgement. Just an average Belgian IPA 3"
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice change of pace and refreshing on its own. I will finish the bomber later with a plate of ziti."

"O - Overall a very refreshing beer. Heavy on the sweeter fruitiness upfront, but still plenty of bitterness throughout. Carbonation seems to lack something, but that could be from the age"
""
""
""
"Hazy peach color huge malt background the bright American citrus hops seem to have faded leaving an amazing Belgian vanilla bubblegum malt bomb that's so strong, smooth, and satisfying. Drinkable? yes.'maybe next time it's brewed I'll have the pleasure to try if fresher."
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden. Thick bubble foam and sticky lacing. Smell is fantastic! I smell a vanilla hop meets fruity hop kind of thing. Taste is exceptional as well. Again you get the bite of the hops, but its not overdone. Its well balanced with a cotton candy vanilla type flavor, but with a fruity, peach maybe?, belgian finish. The alcohol is hidden very well, but noticeable. The hops seem so lively and fresh...where I would say this is even a bit chewey. This is a fantastic beer and not to be passed up."

"O - This beer lives up to its name. It is definitely a bit wild and totally stands out. Maybe a little too wild. But by all means enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazed golden with yeaste particulates in suspension. Nice doughy belgian yeastiness on the aroma mixed with citric hops. Flavor is bright and citric, a little farmhouse sour/funk, and doughy belgian yeastiness. Lemon comes through pretty big in the citrus department. Quite drinkable...especially for 9.4. Wouldn't have guessed. Good brew. Lagunitas is just a solid, solid brewery."
""
""
""
"Sampled from a pint glass."
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic. A very drinkable beer even with the high ABV. - A definite beer to revisit."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. Color is golden, most likely a byproduct of the wheat in the recipe. Appearance is somewhat cloudy, this beer may have been bottle conditioned. Aroma is of bready yeast, with pineapple, grapefruit, and other citrus fruit shining through. With a name like Wild, you would expect this to be somewhat sour, but it really isn't. Instead this feels more like a heavily-hopped Beligian Tripel or Belgian Golden Strong. Not that that's a bad thing. Trademark Lagunitas malt sweentess shines from start to finish, which helps to mask the size of this beer - 9%+ ABV. There's a slightly minerally or metallic thing going on in the finish that I wish wasn't there, but overall this is another nicely crafted beer from a brewery that clearly knows what it is doing."
""
"Beautiful golden orange. Smells very fruity. Pineapple, peaches, and apricots. Tastes of peaches and pineapple with a bitter and slightly sour finish. Some phenolic spice is present and compliments the fruitiness very well. Possibly some notes of breadiness or biscuit in there. A little pine as well. Kind of a foamy and dry mouthfeel. Really nice, interesting an refreshing."
""
"OK. Somewhat clashing but complimentary. Some chemical, metallic, and medicinal notes are not pleasant, but at least subtle."
"By the name alone, you'd think it a wild ale - not so, with the yeast providing the crazy here. Good beer, but I'd actually prefer the original."
""
"Gave this a shot as a wild card from my trip to Asheville. I will say I'm not a big hop head, so I will try and be open. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A golden, copper clear pour with a very generous 2+ finger off white pillow head. Obvious carbonation with decent lacing and rentention. Smell was a bit mild. Some notes of citrus and lemon grass. Maybe a hint of cloves. Taste was surprising for an IPA. It was pretty well balanced with some bready malts poking through the hop bitterness. Pretty smooth and refreshing. Feel was quite a bit of carbonation, but not too watery. Quite balanced. Overall- I was pretty impressed with the balance and flavor of this IPA. Again, not my style, but I've had a lot worse. A bit too much citrus and carbonation for me, but wouldn't turn one down-"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is one of the better ""under $10 6 packs"" I have ever had. I would gladly get this beer again. Another great effort by Lagunitas"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this beer is exactly what you would expect from a Lagunitas-style IPA with Belgian yeast. It’s a good flavorful beer to drink for a long time."

"D: [DRINKABILITY] Due to the overpowering, off-putting and out of place aromas, I can barely stand to put my nose in the glass any longer. The rest of the brew's attributes are strong enough, however, to keep the drinkability rating from being a 1."

"O: Had you told me it was a regular IPA, score probably would be a bit higher. I liked it, but did not love it."
"D: Worth trying a few times. After a couple, it can be a bit much. The antiseptic qualities multiply."

"O - Enjoyable belgian style. Have not had this sty in quite some time. Nice dry finish."

"Pretty goldish orange color, clear, and topped with a nice looking bubbly, slick white head. Aroma is full of tart and sweet fruit over a solid malty base. Candy pineapples, orange, zesty spices, mint, and something along the lines of fresh soap. Taste is just the right kind of sweet, embedded in a plethora of flavory goodness with a bright, smooth bitter hop tingle. There's a nice candied fruit variety, both tropical fruits and sweet citrus. Chewy caramel and bready malts are all over too. A very nice combo of all sorts of things. I would certainly have this again. Mouthfeel is slick, syrupy, smooth, and chewy. A tad resiny too. The body is medium-full, but on the full side. This is also quite easy to drink. Lots of tasty things going on, and the abv isn't slowing me down one bit."

"O - The medicinal quality in the taste is a bit off putting, but not a bad beer by any means, just not my favorite"
"More proof Lagunitas is a world class brewery. Served at a good temperature and a nice foamy frothy, off white head that soon settled down and a whole load of lace. Color is a clear, rich amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is hop, bread dough, wet grass, caramel, malt. Flavor is like nose; hop on top (?!), followed underneath with slight sweetness, good carbonic tang and, perhaps, a yeast bitterness that all told make this a good drinking beer. Body and carbonation are faultless. Finish is like flavor, on the long side, and a some alcohol warmth. Beer On!"
"O - I found the Little Sumpin' Wild to be an interesting take on the Belgian IPA style. Pretty hop-forward and in your face, Sumpin Wild is good-value, distinctive and enjoyable if not necessarily the best Belgian IPA I've had."

"O - Impressed with this beer, as I usually am with any Lagunitas offering. Quite the unusual brew. Can't wait for their winter strong ales to get here."
""
"O-I would not say that Belgian IPAs are my favorite style but that isn't to say I dislike them either.This was an extremely tasty example and one I will surely revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I definitely like this more than the original, it has a fuller flavor and a more complex flavor, while actually being easier to drink since the hops seem a bit toned down. I like this, the complexity keeps me sipping trying to pick it apart."
""
""
"O: Love this beer. First had it on Oktoberfest this year, but no way I could review it after a zillion beers before it. Picked some up in Illinois today and glad to review it now with fresh taste buds. Do be forewarned, that 9.4% is well hidden, don't let it catch you off guard."
"O: A nice tart and hoppy brew"
""
""
""
"Little Sumpin Wild is limited release and can be occasionally be found in a 6 pack for about 10 bucks. Being a high quality 9.4% alcohol belgian IPA, it's a great deal. Not to mention, this is one of Lagunita's better brews. Great Belgian style yeasty flavors combined with the hoppiness of a moderate IPA makes for an enjoyable session beer."
""
"Unique and complex brew. I really enjoyed the balance between the earthy and delicate flavors. This made for a great drinking experience. I highly recommend seeking it out."

"Update: had a bomber on 2/2/13 and as expected, top notch stuff. So much more than their Lil Sumpin with Belgian yeast thrown in. A very different beer. And a very delicious beer."

"Overall: For a Imperial IPA, especially in the Belgian-style, a well-balanced yet flavorful beer. Clean but big, this beer has lots of nuanced flavors that do not overpower one another. Yeastiness is kept in check, perhaps even on the light side, but overall a very good and enjoyable beer."

"22oz. bomber: This one pours a clear, golden color. Maybe a tinge of orange in it. Small off white head that leaves a little lacing. Interesting aroma. Some banana, clove, pine, and a bit of yeastiness. The taste is good. Flavors are a bit more blended and harder to pick out distinct ones. Bitter, a touch bready, good malt body, faint fruits. I like this, and would definitely buy another!"

"This is a good representation of the style, but I could use more Belgian yeast character. It's good, but I don't know if I'll buy it again in the near future. I'll probably try something new and continue the quest."

"Overall this is superb craftsmanship and a well-made brew. I might by a few more and try to cellar them to see if it becomes more balanced."

"A Belgian style ale that I bought 2 six packs of based on the retailer's recommendation. It has a nice burnt orange color with a heady floral aroma. It has a definite Belgium ale taste but is extremely hoppy. Very crisp taste and a good deal of bitterness. I am not sure that the combination of Belgium ale and extreme hopppiness is my cup of tea."
"Medium bodied and smooth with average carbonation. The aftertaste is bitter. I think this beer is too bitter for its style, but not a bad effort."
"Very clean finish."
"Overall: I like the regular version better. The wild yeast and hops didn't mix well as far as I was concerned."
"Overall: A great beer, certainly, but just a bit disappointing. Really was not too much wild about it and, in my opinion, not as good as the original. Still a mighty fine brew at a great cost."
"O- Honestly, I have no complaints at all. Awesome beer. Lagunitas is always great, and this beer is especially awesome."
"D: For the ABV content, it's quite drinkable. I'm shocked actually at how drinkable it is."
"Overall: Pretty good beer. The initial sweetness was a little too much for me to really enjoy. It did have a good flavor and finished well, but I am not a huge fan of this style of beer."
"O: The ABV makes this a two-er at most for me, but the mouthfeel and taste could render this a sessioner without the high ABV. What a beer!"
"O: is this really a Belgian Strong Pale Ale? It's just an excellent IPA with excellent yeast. Whatever the style, it's awesome, cheap, and sometimes available. I've had it on tap in Illinois and Florida. Solid beer all around."
"O: Nice and refreshing. Pretty good, I like it."
"D/O- I believe Lagunitas nailed it with this one. A very good ""beginner"" Belgian-style beer. Easier drinking than it should be. Thanks PTMcB!"
"O: You're not going to get a better bargain for a six pack of 9.4% Belgian style Golden Ale, but I've certainly tasted far better. Seems more like a 'get drunk' beer than one that focuses on the fine points of the style."
"Serving type: bottle"
"4. Bravo Lagunitas"
"I fail to understand its place in the Lagunitas portfolio."
"Pours a darker gold body with a frumpy white head with excellent retention and lacing properties. Aromas are tropical - pineapple, guava, mango, and floral notes are all very strong. The taste is spicier than the nose would suggest, and yeastier. The abv is also more noticeable on the finish, making it very warming as it goes down. This is really good stuff."
"Overall an excellent brew."
"Very nice beer from a brewery that I generally find to be a bit underwhelming. Poured a burnt amber color, clear, with a moderate eggshell head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, cirtus zest and a dab of funk. Nice and crisp in the taste, a solid malt base with plenty of citrus and piney hops up front, juicy fruits, and a certain yeasty complexity. Medium-bodied, with a crisp, dry finish, and quite drinkable overall."
"Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Really good IPA. Lots of flavor on the palate that sticks around. I would have it again. Recommended."
"An orange shaded golden terriffically crystal clear brew with a billowing rocky head. The aroma is not what I expected, lots of piney hops, and vegatile grass but hidding under there is a bit'o bubble gum. Wish there was more yeast driven aroma. Wow, this is a really pithey, piney hop escapade not much else to it sadly. Fairly dry mouthfeel, probably due to the yeast. Overall I was really hoping for more Belgian charecter. I just got mostly hops here. Not many esters or fruityness :( If I wasn't told it was ""belgian"" I wouldn't know."
"Overall I should really come clean and let it be known that I hate this style. I see how much everyone else loves these so I keep trying Belgian's but continue to hate them. I try to score on the style the best I can, even though I can't stand them. This one is much better then the few I have tried in the past."
"Overall this is a really tasty brew. I'm not familiar with Belgian Strong Pales, but I know I loved this one. I think I'll be looking into this style a bit more deeply. Cheers!"
"Overall: I can't categorize this beer. It it very drinkable. It is fresher and more flavorful than Piraat or any of the regular Belgian IPA's. I'd buy this again."
"Taste is also like most other Lagunitas beers and the aroma, candied bittersweet grapefruit with the faintest hint of grain and other general citrus. There is a very faint hint of juicy yeastiness (again, the Beglian element trying to make itself known? Perhaps, but really trying to add to the character is a battle it simply cannot win). Candied grapefruit sweetness just barely dominated by spicy-sharp grapefruit bitterness. One dimensional dud."
"Interesting, but a bit sweet for me."
"O - Pretty solid brew. I wouldn't mind having another sixer in my fridge."
"Overall: Almost too sweet but the complexity of the bitterness is just right to off-set it and make this a very good beer. The hops are not as stong as I would like either."
"Little Sumpin' Sumpin' was good and Little Sumpin' 13th Anniversary was bleh, but Little Sumpin' Wild is the best Little Sumpin' yet. The choice of hops really compliments the yeast. First the dry herbals, then the carmely sweet and aromatic, then with the dry again. There's only a little bit of sweetness that smoothes out the bitter, but after that it's gone. It almost smells like a hoppy saison. There's a good amount of carbonation, but it doesn't show in the head or bubbles. I'm guessing that's because of the extreme clarity of the beer, there's not as many little micro surfaces in the fluid to disturb the CO2."
"I've been meaning to try this for awhile now, and it was well worth the wait. I'm in love with fruity, hop forward Belgian's and this fits that description perfectly. Big thumbs up to Lagunitas for this offering."
"O/D - The flavour was alot more like an IPA, while the aroma showed more Tripel or Belgian ale character. A very interesting mix. While not being mind-blowing, it was still refreshing and a nice drink."
"Pours a deep reddish orange with a 2 finger head that slimes about the glass. The smell is excellent a huge citrus hop, mixed with a strange array of bananas, cherries with a deep alcohol finish. Tastes of grapefruit, fresh tart cherries, warming alcohol found throughout the sip. Heavy on the feel, this is a very big beer, very bitter and dry, goes down much better as it warms up. Overall this is interesting beer, with a lot of complexity, i can dig it."
"This has a wonderfully bold fruitiness mixed with nice hoppy bitterness. There's a mild maltiness mixed in. The fruit is a mix of watermelon and a dark fruit grape-yness. The hops are calm, meaning that the bitterness isn't too biting. Beautiful complexity...just like a hot, crazy chick."
"Last one. Hope you enjoyed it too. Cheers"
"Pours a goldenclean translucent color with creamy white lacing. The nose is infused with banana, clove, peppercorn and spice. The taste is following suite quit closely besides the sweet malt and light hop characteristics. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing with a good amount of carbination to make lip smackingly tasty. Overall, Lagunitas brings another affordable offering to th tavle once again. A great easy drinking BSA."
"O: Bitter and powerful but I expected a better level of drinkability."
"O: Great beer that I have purchased a few times now, can't see myself not picking up this one again in the future."
"Hazy orange, light ring of white head, no lace, decent retention. Smell is fairly malty with sweet notes, citrus and pine, lots of hops here, light yeastiness, tangerine, a lot like a double IPA/DIPA. Taste is fairly malty, big juicy hops, grapefruit and tangerine, lots of citrus especially in finish, some warm alcohol, yeasty finish/aftertaste. Med-high carbonation, slick feel, slightly oily, drying, good weight. Fairly good stuff, don't know why this is listed as Belgian because it much more like DIPA had I had known how hoppy this was I probably wouldn't have waited a month to get to this."
"O - A great beer until it gets too warm. I would get it again and would recommend it to others."
"Well done, Lagunitas."
"A vigorous pour gives a slow-developing but lasting half-inch of foam sitting on top of a clear gold beer. The nose is typical Lagunitas: loaded with hops, pine-resin-like with a tidge of citrus. Flavor is a good mix of really strong grassy hops, dense, sweet malt, and a fruity yeast character. The ""Wild", I assume, implies there's some non-standard yeast like Brett or something, but my taste buds aren't good enough to detect it among the assertive other flavors of this beer. It's still good, though. And warming, by the finish."
"Overall a really good beer. I'm beginning to really like this style and I think this is a great example of it. I'll definitely be looking for this one again."
"Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me. This beautiful Belgian pale pours an orange-copper, almost like a pumpkin beer, with a sizeable head with *excellent* lacing. Slight booze odor given off beneath the floral hop and sweet bready aromas, with a ripe something on the very back end. The taste is sweet and in the front and bitter towards the back with ever so slight peppery phenols around. Dangerously drinkable, like most of the breweries' beers. Excellent stuff."
"A good, what I would style as, american DIPA."
"Overall a good beer, could tone down the yeast a bit."
"This Ale whether you consider it a Belgium Strong Pale Ale or an Imperial IPA has everything you would want in an west coast American Pale Ale. Despite the high ABV 9:4%!! Each flavor is balanced almost to perfection!!"
"A great spin on an already great beer. I blew through a case of this faster than I wanted to."
"Woo hoo. Another one that I truly love."
"Overall / Drinkability: As with many things from this brewery - good amounts of hops and malt. Very tasty and it did not disappoint. But....it doesn't make me think of a Belgian Strong Pale. The alcohol is perfectly hidden which can be a characteristic of this beer, but it's a DIPA in flavor. I'm not complaining exactly as it is quite tasty, but I'm not seeing the connection to the style at all. However, I'll give it this - just like Duvel which will sneak up on you, this one will too. High ABV so well hidden, yep, devilish is one way to describe this, but tasty enough that I want another one. So maybe it is this style after all, just hop forward in fine west-coast style. Quite drinkable despite the fact the even with the devil egging me on I should stop at one."
"This is a solid beer. Complex, intriguing, warming, refreshing. All around good!"
"This is one of those beers that just makes style boundaries seem silly. It has a bunch of different things going on - heavy hops, Belgian yeast, fruity sweet malts. So what is it? Delicious!"
"Clear as a bell - straw-orangy color. Off white head with not the greatest head retention. Smells mostly like floral/fruity Belgian yeast with a touch of booze. Yeast seems to mix/cover hop smell a bit. Hop aroma that I can detect is citrus-piney and very American smelling. Tastes very a lot like Centennial hops in the flavor. Reasonable malty sweetness to back up the booze and bitterness. Slight bread malt notes as well. Westmalle yeast is great tasting, very clean, but the bitterness hits at the same time and really conflicts in my opinion. I do like the idea of American hops mixed with the traditional Belgian Abbey yeast. Other than the high bitterness this beer has no notable flaws in my opinion. Well crafted and fun to drink. Solid alcohol content in this one, so some aging might bring out the yeast and subdue the bitterness a bit. I'll try aging and re-reviewing in a year or two."
"A delicious (Belgian) DIPA, if you ask me."
"Overall this is one of the greatest beers I have ever had in my life. Like I said earlier, this is the best beer I have tried from Laguintas and I have had tons of their beers. If you see this beer, but it!"
"(O) It's different. It's not what I expected but it has that definite ""wild"" type of taste to it. It's more on the side of the pale ale spectrum with that slight difference."
"O - This is a high ABV beer done right. Crisp, clean, and bold. My favorite of a top notch Lagunitas line of brews."
"Not a big fan of wild, farmhouse style - but this is a nice surprise."
"O - I like Lagunitas beers and this is no exception. It is full of flavor and a joy to drink."
"""Wild"" is a seriously fun, big, rollicking, in-your-face American/Euro IPA. Thank you, Lagunitas. Keep doing waht you're doing."
"Overall - Pretty tasty and flavorful. It reminds me more of a saison then anything. The bitterness at the end is my only downfall. A nice addition to the sumpin series."
"A nice offering from Lagunitas... sort of a mellow mix between a Belgian IPA and a Saison."
"Well it’s perfectly natural to compare this with A Little Sumpin, Sumpin Ale, but let’s just say they are both excellent on their own merits. This definitely has a Belgium slant to it, an Americanized Saison, and for that reason I find this Ale to be just delicious! Overall everything comes together in this ale, the yeast, the malt, the hops, and even the sweetness, to deliver an excellent balanced ale. A pleasure to drink, and for me, despite the virtually unnoticeable 9.4% ABV, an Ale I can drink several of back to back. This is one of the few brews I enjoyed slightly colder, seems perfect at around 50 degrees. Lagunitas continues to impress me!"
"o: I liked this for it hoppiness, but I didn't find much Belgian character. Other reviewers mentioned Brett, I certainly didn't find any of that."
"O - im glad to see this in 6 packs this year, my favorite under the radar beer at an event last year, glad im enjoying it as much this time around. solid brew from lagunitas, amongst my favorites from them. i did not enjoy this one on tap nearly as much*"
"This is definitely the best offering I've had from Lagunitas. I've had some Belgian Strong Pale Ales before, but this one blows all of them out of the water, including the almighty Duvel. Finely crafted and devastatingly tasty, this is a beer that merits repeat visits in the future. Bravo, Lagunitas!"
"O: Once again, lagunitas does not disappoint. A very enjoyable seasonal."
"O: Very pleasing brew, the flavours are great as is the aroma. The alcohol shines through a tad to much and it could lessen the bitterness."
"Overall a very smooth, enjoyable, flavorful beer that I would definitely drink again."
"O: a good beer, much better on the flavor than on the aroma though"
"This one had me scratching my head. I could swear that the server poured me a DIPA. Later that afternoon, I had the bartender draw me a sample and sure enough, it's what I had earlier. Maybe I was expecting a wild ale and the name was misleading, as there were no sour characteristics present in the beer. Appearance was golden with a bit of amber and slightly cloudy. Head was a bit on the short lived side and there was little lace. Aroma was strong C-hops, grapefruit and tropical fruit. Flavor was the same. Medium body and carbonation. I would have rated this beer a half higher overall if it were billed as a DIPA, as the hops were too overwhelming."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-gold color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of rotten grapefruit, rotten oranges, and pine. It is not an appealing aroma. The taste is hoppy with the same rotten quality of the aroma. I can't detect anything remotely wild/sour in this beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty bad beer. If this truly is a wild ale then it is way too hoppy to let the wild ale qualities come through. As is it tastes like a poorly crafted DIPA. I will not drink this beer again."
"A really tasty and easy drinking (for the ABV) BSPA. Not quite as carbonated or ""fluffy"" as some, but a very nice Americanized (hoppy) version, nonetheless. Could easily be categorized as a Belgian IPA."
"I didn't know the style they were going for at first, which I guess should be blamed on marketing. The original Sumpin' advertised the wheat, but that doesn't jibe well with most Belgian Strong Pales. I didn't know what to think of this beer. It would have been better without the strong carbonation and bite in the tongue. I guess I could just let it simmer a bit after pouring if I buy a sixer, though. This is interesting if not complex. Lagunitas keeps proving to me that they are a bit one note and should stick to their awesome IPAs."
"The hops are pretty prominent in the taste, bready malts, some tropical fruit, herbs, apple and berries, citrus, just a touch of spicy alcohol which is well blended, fairly yeasty and bitter finish. Medium bodied and a fair amount of carbonation on the tongue."
"Transparent orange in body with bubbly white. Smells of grassy hops, sweet malt, and some wild yeast. Tastes of grassy hops, wild yeast, apples, and vague alcohol. Light bodied with light carbonation.A tasty drink with great flavor and quite sessionable for its ABV."
"Ho Yeah!"
"Try it!!"
"An interesting beer but I think the Wild distracts rather than adds to the base beer."
"Great beer, not the best of the style but really liked it."
"Overall, it’s good, but the hops dominate everything else."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, and I wouldn't mind picking up another six-pack or so while it is around. I like that the American breweries are experimenting with hops in sour beers, and I think that it is a good direction to go. I am also liking the Black IPA, so some exciting things are ahead. The fact that I plan to buy this beer again says that I approve. Go get yourself some and give it a shot. If you like IPA and/or sour beers, you probably won't be disappointed. I would like it to be more bold on the wild side, but this is still OK."
"Overall: I'm going to say it...I like this more than the original. And that is saying something! Its an Imperial wheat wild IPA and it straight-up kicks ass! Great, original beer that's loaded with complexity and flavour."
"I had A Little Sumpin Sumpin and really enjoyed that beer. This one was not far from it."
"Brisk carbonation and even slightly tannic."
"O: I will keep buying this!! Well priced and wonderfully drinkable. At 9.4 ABV I would only be able to drink around 10 to 12 bottles before switching over to something lighter. >;^))"
"This is a rare beer where everything -- flavor, style, value, availability -- came together perfectly. Can't recommend this highly enough."
"O - A unique and deservedly awesome beer. Everything about it screams quality, complexity, and uniqueness. I love this style, and I've truly never had a beer quite like this one. Goes up to the top of my list of best BSPAs out there!"
"O- I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, thought it was very well put together and as I moved through the glass I found myself appreciating it more and more. This is a nice change of pace from my usual brews, so I may have to seek this one out to mix it up every now and then."
"O - this is a unique Blego-American ale that is both easy drinking (maybe too easy drinking for its abv) and exceptionally flavorful."
" There's nothing really wild about this but rather just a hopped up version of a BSPA. All the spiciness and yeast associated with the style just some added American Flair and a lot more hops."
"Your typical Lagunitas offering. very solid beer nice hop profile with a little twist. Nice alcohol kick. I can't say I've every had a bad brew from these guys."
"O: this is a brilliant beer that I am so happy I got a six pack of on a whim. I will be getting this again and find it suitable if not better then some of the good abbey beers. Brilliant."
"Edit: My bottle is telling me it's 9.4% rather than the 8.85% that is listed...shibby"
"Good stuff - would love to try this one again."
"O: Really great. 9+% but you can hardly taste the alcohol. Could drink many of these.... I often feel Lagunitas misses the mark and is only about the spectacle, but they've proven me wrong big time here. Highly recommended."
" ~ This is another high quality beverage from the folks at Lagunitas. They've really done a nice job with this beer. It looks good, smells good, taste good, feels good... it must be good."
"While an excellent beer, this is nothing like what I think of when I envision a Belgian Stong Pale Ale. Far hoppier than any BSPA I've had before, this does have the Lagunitas house brand clearly stamped on it with its aggressive hop presence. Sweet to start, peppery and bitter to finish, this is a relatively complex brew that I definitely recommend grabbing and trying. Cheers!"
"O- Leaning more toward IPA territory. Another example of a tasty, but if predictably hoppy lagunitas beer. Worth a try."
"Overall this is great. I will definitely seek out again."
"Very nice beer, a great mix of different flavors making a fun complex beer."
"O: A very delicious brew, worthy of its namesake. I only wish it wasn't limited release!"
"Overall: This one is occasionally available in Utah, I wish we could get it regularly. A very well done, solid, complex beer. Maybe my only knock is that it would not be accessible to a person new to craft beer. This is a beer lovers beer."
"O - Delightful. I was super glad I picked this up. Easily the best overall drinking pint I have had in a while, I will be sad when the sixer is done."
"D - A really really nice brew... A little more in the aroma department would make this an exceptional offering... Well crafted and rather unique... I would gladly invest in a sixer of this every time I see it and would recommend other BAs do the same... Lagunitas has never let me down... All that being said, I'm not sure I agree with the style classification for this one... It strikes me much more as a Double IPA or Strong Ale..."
"Overall this beer met expectations. It was unique and likable but I'm not sure that's enough for me to want to buy it regularly. It's interesting to experiment making a malty Belgian beer and lots of hops, but a heavy handed dose of American hoppiness shouldn't go to waste. That's why the parent beer to this (Little Sumppin Sumpin) is more of a success. Focus on the hops. That's why I say this is just worth a try..."
"Overall - What an interesting beer, so many flavors and nuances. I have really liked every Lagunitas product I've tried, and this is certainly no exception. I totally get the Wild, with all of the flavors going here, along with a prominent carmel backbone that offsets the bitter nuances, this one is just spiced. Check this one out, I would buy this one again."
"I really enjoyed this one. This is a ""big sister"" to a beer I still haven't tried so I don't quite have a comparison there. It's just a great beer! Lagunitas continues to show great range and quality."
"Mouthfeel - Good crisp body and feel, works well with the taste."
"O: Definitely not a BSPA--too thick and hoppy--but a wonderful Belgian IPA. A delicious mix of sweet and spicy Belgian aromas/flavors with tropical fruit hop aromas and flavors. I didn't expect to enjoy this beer as much as I do, but it's hard not to chug it because it's so tasty and drinkable. Absolutely love it."
"Future outlook: At under $10 for a sixer, this was an incredible steal...might have to be used as cellar-stock...."
"O - Over all this has to be one of the best Belgium style beers I have had/liked. I don't like the Belgium styles much (more of a hop-head). This has the best of both worlds for Belgium IPA fans, hops and a Belgium back ground. Bottle indicates a Alc. of 9.4% instead of 8.8% stated here."
"O - I had this on tap once and thought it was overly sweet. While there is some sweetness, the bitter grapefruit definitely wins out. Overall a nice Belgian IPA that would have again, but wouldn't go out of my way for."
"Final Thoughts: Nothing great. I guess I'm comparing it too much to sumpin sumpin, but looking at it from beligian stand point, I think its pretty normal. It's good, but I kinda expected more."
"O-Truly a wonderful, flavorful beer. Laguanitas has been really impressing me lately, and this might be my favorite so far. I can drink this beer everyday. Highly recommended."
"Very bitter of course, grapefruit rind comes to mind as big waves of citrus and pine combine in the taste. Thick mouthfeel, but crisp and dry as well. Sweetness is brief, but there in an attempt to balance some of the bitterness, quite unsuccessfully, but that might be a good thing for me and other hop heads. Malted barley flavors help a little to bring this down to earth. Boozy notes come through as it warms a little, but it doesn't take anything away from the overall flavor. What this beer lacks in balance it makes up for in its in-your-face hoppy quality. Another really good hop bomb from Lagunitas and definitely worth a try."
"Overall I though this was a pretty good beer and after everything is all said and done I think I like this slight more then the original beer. I find that the combination of the Belgian yeast with the base of this beer really work well together and help take this brew to another level. I also like the heavier amount of citrus hops that show up in the beer, it makes for a really nice mixture of different citrus fruits. I like the flavor and aroma the most about this beer, everything seemed to come together very nicely and with great balance. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, the color was a little pale and head and head retention was lack luster. This beer had pretty good drinkability, the alcohol was hidden well and the flavor kept me coming back for more, if I had another one I would drink it, I would for sure buy this again. I recommend this beer to just about anyone, if you like Belgian IPA's this beer would be a great choice. Lagunitas has been impressing me a lot lately, every beer I have had from them has been good and impressing, they are making a nice run at being my favorite out of state brewery, they sure now how to use their hops. You guys keep making different variations of this beer and I will keep drinking them."
"This pours a clear orangish color with a large foamy white head with good lacing. The smell is of citrus, grapefruit and orange, some yeast funk and spices, very good and sweet smelling. Feel is medium with a mouth coating hop resin. The taste is pretty exceptional, I do get the alcohol boozeiness taste, but there is a good amount of grapefruit hop bite, some nice belgium yeast esters / funk and a load of bitterness on the back end, overall this is an amazing brew, I like it more than the great Little Sumpin regular. This is my second favorite Lagunitas brew (only after the even better Hop Stoopid)."
"O: I actually really liked this one. It's another winner for Laguniatas with me."
"O: I am a big fan of Lagunitas and the beers they produce. This may be my favorite."
"D - Off the charts amazing. This is a SOLID, SOLID beer. First time I've ever seen this and this is one of the best beers I've ever had. A beer that out-of-reach beer drinkers should be willing to trade for. This shit is awesome."
"Reading the other reviews, it may be possible that earlier versions of this beer were different. It also may be possible that I got an earlier version of this, since the Lagunitas site says that the 2011 version of this is 8.85%...so I'm really not sure."
"Poured into a snifter, this one pours brilliantly clear light copper color with a moderate bright white head that leaves nice amounts of lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is medium-high fruity esters, lots of pineapple, some citrus, hints of bready malt, inviting. The flavor is sweet and hoppy upfront, citrus hops, chewy, bready malt. The beer swallows velvety smooth, dries a good deal and a solid hop bitterness emerges. The hop bitterness lingers just a bit with a bit of phenolic yeast character also noticeable. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a tremendous beer, complex yet easy to drink. Very glad I got a full 6 pack, probably should get another."
"O - Excellent beer. I prefer the sumpin' to the sumpin' wild, but still a solid beer."
"Overall I really like this beer and its taste profile. One of the better hoppy beers with Belgian yeast I have had. Would buy and enjoy again."
"o: Solid offering from Lagunitas. Extremely drinkable considering the ABV. I recommend trying this at least once."
"O - While this isn't a bad beer it wasn't wild enough for me I would have liked it better if the funk was stronger but still a good beer thats worth trying"
"D - Very easy to drink; complex blend of hops and malt really work well to create a pleasant palate experience; I would have another"
"Overall this beer is nothing short of awesome. I was pleasantly blown away actually by how good it was. Excellent all around beer with very high drinkability. I didn't realize that it was fermented with Westmalle yeast which makes sense because I love Westmalle and think it's incredibly complex which lends itself perfectly to this beer. I highly recommend this."
"i remember this beer tasting a bit different when it was in 22oz bombers. i think i enjoy this beer even more now that i get 6 of them!"
"Light golden with a big pillowy off-white head. The aroma is slightly sweet, like cream soda with belgian spice and plenty of minty, piney hops. Delicious and hoppy with toasted barley and coriander, the alcohol is well hidden (this bottle is actually labeled 9.4% ABV). Finishes dry. Nice heft but light enough and effervescent. A nice, tasty Belgian style IPA but not really a Wild ale."
"The beer is transparent and golden hued, with 1/4"" of white head. It seems like lately I've been drinking a lot of beers that look like this. The aroma brings some dank hops, alcohol, and sweet malt. The flavor is decent, albeit a bit sharp. Thin to medium bodied, with a fairly present alcohol presence. I'm not as impressed as the large majority with this brew. A valiant effort, but I would take ubiquitous Duvel over this any time."
"O: Pretty good drinkability considering the abv and the belgium yeast. Pretty good overall."
"O: Overall this is a good easy drinking beer given the abv. However I really think it could have some more belgian qualities seeing that it is a BSPA. All in all a decent offering but nothing I would hunt down. 3.5"
"O-> Overall, this is a very nice change of scenery from all of the summer beers that have been in my rotation lately...That being said, I think I prefer Sumpin' Sumpin' over this....not a knock against Sumpin' Wild, just my preference. Really enjoyed the Belgian yeast and mystery mild funk....also was kind of refreshing with the clove-y weizen-like notes in the taste...I will enjoy the few remaining bottles from the sixer on the porch looking out at the ocean...."
"O: Well this has that Lagunitas taste to it without a doubt, I still feel like the odd guy out since I don't find it to be a huge draw. I just don't see their beers to be very unique from one another. This has enough hops to scratch your itch and some awesome yeast strain in it but the flavors aren't doing it for me."
"Awesome stuff here and sessionable."
"O: Quite good. I wouldn't really categorize this as a BPA - at least a typical one. This is basically a stronger lil' sumpin sumpin with the added complexity of some belgian yeast."
"Overall Impression- A nice brew by Lagunitas! Not as spicy or sour as I thought it would be... Very drinkable, fruity, and has the perfect balance all around. One of the coolest attributes of this beer is that the aroma was very similar to the flavor/taste! Cool. Recommend grabbing if you like light Belgians."
"O - Overall, this is an interesting beer for sure. Glad I have another!"
"O- You can almost taste the dirt that each element of this brew was grown in. Such a brilliant balance of hops, malted barley, yeast and water!!! Citrus flavors that spank you, sweet malts that draw you in, and yeasty funk that makes you say... WHAT THE FUNK? Damn near perfect!!!"
"O: I believe that each and every one of the 72.51 IBUs that Lagunitas claims is present. Highly bitter brew with citrus notes and a nice blanket of funk. The only drawback is that the malts, or lack thereof, create an unpleasant graininess as a backbone. The high IBUs hide the 9.4% abv nicely."
"O- This is by far in my top five beers of all time. It is the nectar of the gods. Excellent beer from Lagunitas."
"O - really surpassed w this one. Really reminds me of a Midwest ipa more than anything. Can't say that the Belgian yeast comes through all that strain but that not a knock on this beer. Very very good"
"This beer pours a crisp gold with a fluffy head. It smells sweet, malty and alcoholic. This beer tastes unique; it is sweet, crisp, lemon... I was hesitant to try this as Lagunitas offerings have struck me as being too similar to each other in the past; this one is different and very tasty."
"o-overall it was an excellent beer. It's heavy to be a regular drinker though."
"O - Good brew, glad i picked up a sixer!"
"Final thought - Pick some up for sure. Lagunitas always knows how to brew a great seasonal and a great price $8.99 a six"
"Overall again, one of my favorite lagunitas brews. Just does what it does so well. I'm glad I still have pretty much half a case left."
"O - When i tried this beer last year i thought it was one of the best beers i had tried all year. This year im glad to see it in the new 12oz format, making it a bit easier to enjoy. This is a masterfully crafted beer and im not even sure the Belgians could get as good. The ABV is very well hidden behind the funkiness of the yeast as well as the huge hop aromas. If anyone from Lagunitas is reading this, please make this an unLimited release!"
"Overall solid beer, will buy again for sure!"
"o: a good beer, i cant believe i had a lagunitas beer that i didnt say was great. alochol is a little overpowering for my taste. i'll throw the rest in the cellar to age a little and see if it blends better."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but nothing more. I felt like the main thing detracting from me giving a higher score is that the bitterness seemed to not mesh so well, and not as well balanced out by the malt as I would have liked. It was a solid beer though and I would enjoy this again without hesitation."
"Overall a surprise to see cases of this stacked up. I may buy the remaining stock."
"Overall, it's pretty all-right. I guess it's vaguely more Belgian than the standard, and it's interesting to see a new take on a commonplace standard."
"O- delicious light beer. great for a late summer release"
"Overall, this beer is phenomenal. The bitterness and pungent aromas hide the ABV well, and the mouthfeel matches up very well with similar (I)IPA's. Here's to hoping this sees the same unLimited production as the original Sumpin Sumpin."
"This beer is not nearly as “wild” as I had expected, but I have to say that I am very pleased it was not. The closer I got to the bottom of the glass, the more I dug the subtle funky characteristics of the beer and enjoyed how well it played off of the characteristics of this already excellent recipe. Definitely recommended."
"I like this a lot more than the regular sumpin sumpin. Like a lot of the Lagunitas seasonals it's hard to drink lots of it because they are damned high in ABV."
"O: I LOVE the regular version of this beer and the ""wild"" version is pretty damn tasty as well. I had this in bomber format last time and I'm glad they decided to release this in six packs this time."
"O: nice representation of the style, taste is a bit strong and maltiness in the finish is a bit 'off'"
"Light wheat color beer with nice carbination and a very large white head on an agressive pour- Both looking and smelling like a light Belgian. A hint of citrus on the nose- orange. Smooth going down, even better as it warms a little. I am not tasting the dark fruits, but I taste banana and biscuit. It goes down easily for a 9.4% AVB beer (the 2011 vintage denotes 9.4% ABV on the label)."
"A must try for the style but nothing I'm going to suggest you need an additional 6-pack of. However, for the ABV and the $9.99 price tag on a good beer, it's a great buy."
"Another homerun by Lagunitas! A tasty, inexpensive, alcohol-filled treat."
"Picked up a single to try. This is a nice mix of IPA and Belgian styles as both make a big impression on the taste buds. I wish my pallette was more discerning so I could describe the flavors better. Good stuff."
"D - very enjoyable, nice mix of malts and hops, the sweetness could be a bit overwhelming after a glass but its still very enjoyalbe."
"A heavy beer, I thought best had at a later dinner. Pours orange tinged body with a little retained white head. Mildly hoppy aroma. Big mouthfeel, initial glasses of it demonstrated the yeast, followed by the hops and finished by a lot of malts. The third glass was mostly malt and just a variation of a double IPA, stong American ale. Still good drinkability, but would like to have enjoyed more of the yeast and all the complexity it promises."
"Pours a golden orange color with a nice quick fading head that leaves nothing behind. Nose is somewhat subtle but some nice funk with malts and a slight hop presence. Taste is decent. Not quite as in your face as some american wilds but still tasty. Some sour funk finishes the palate with breads and bananas up front. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is a decent brew. More sessionable that some of the other wild ales. Not overly sour but nice complexity."
"Truly an amazing beer, it seems they raised the abv a tad from last year, but just as tasty, maybe even better.. dank! get some!"
"O - These Belgo-hop bombs can be hit or miss, but Lagunitas knocked one out of the park with this beer. Perfect melding of flavors into a delicious brew. Bought just a single thinking that I didn't want more of a nearly 9% beer around at this time of year, but I'm heading back to the bottle shop tomorrow to pick up a 6-er. This is a must try. Cheers,"
"jd"
"Finally, why is this not categorized as a Belgian IPA?"
"-Cheers"
"Notes - This is classic ""All hop IPA"". Im a fan, and it really is a solid contribution to lagunitas' incredible line. Well done."
"O - Actually a pretty good beer, best one I've had by Lagunitas. Has a lot of good stuff going on and I would drink this again."
"O: Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Wild was a reasonable little beer. Not spectacular in any way, though it managed to hold my attention long enough. I won't seek it out again, but would quaff one in a pinch."
"This reminds me more of a Belgian DIPA than a Belgian Strong Pale, but I'll take it. There is a noticeable difference from last year's fresh bottles, and it's a bigger lean toward the Belgian side (with American traits of course). I'll grab some more soon, hopefully a few 22oz for the cellar (though not for too long)."
"O-I'm impressed, but it isn't the Wild Ale I expected. Very drinkable on a hot summer day, but I probably prefer the more flowery yeast and citrus of regular Little Sumpin Sumpin (one of my favorites). Given the IBUs and high ABV, I wouldn't want to have more than a couple in one sitting."
"Cheers"
"It's a bit hot. While not filmy or overly sweet, the hops don't provide the snap I was looking for. Still, this is a nice beer. Can very well pair with cheeses and come out a winner"
"I normally wouldn't review an old DIPA, but considering it's called a BSPA (which should be fairly cellarable) and they don't date the bottles, I'm throwing this review up. If you want to make sure I drink your product as intended, DATE THE DAMNED BOTTLE (and categorize it better...)"
"O - I'm another sucker who got fooled into thinking this was a wild ale. I was left impressed though, and I have yet to have a lagunitas brew that has let me down. Really good stuff!"
"Very interesting beer. Shades of the original LSS with hints of saison and more herbal hop than either."
"O - This would be a better beer to drink in the New England winter. I would get another bottle and drink it with snow on the ground, after a graceful aging period. The beer would shine in such conditions. Even as it is, this beer is quite tasty and sits very well."
"MF- OK carbonation, coats the palate, but could be a tad more crisp with a little more body."
"D - Very easy to drink. Not taxing and hides ABV well."
"Not to be trifled with. A powerful beer with a load of flavors. One of my favorites from Lagunitas."
"O- This beer was just too sweet and one dimensional for me. It reminded me of a much less hopped Hop Stoopid that I had on tap right before this."
"Drinkability: A very good American interpretation of a BSPA. Lots of flavor and a great Belgian yeast profile. It's a relatively high 9% ABV, but no strong alcohol taste at all. A very easy drinking BSPA, and easy to session with a big bottle or two. Another winner from Lagunitas!"
" The flavor has a good fruity yeast and hop cohesion which gives the hoppy citrus and light tropical flavor with spice from the yeast a lot of room to expand and cover the palate with an array of juicy and peppery notes. The yeast adds elements of melon while there is a rind-like taste from the hops and moderate amount of alcohol in the flavor with mild caramel malt which gives a light sweetness to the flavor but comes forward slightly as it wams with a gentle toasted character. Overall I recommend this to anyone who likes hops and belgian yeast together -this strain is nice to combine with west coast hops and Lagunitas did a good job incorporating in a pleasant way. I think this is drinkable especially for the amount of alcohol in the brew -you barely taste it -A solid offering."
"Taste packs a powerful citrus punch up front sweet orange dominated by bitter grapefruit followed by buttery bread notes and a chewy, malt mouthfeel. There is a taste of raw honey in there as well. An excellent beer that is big on flavor and deceptively strong."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the mystery sweetness. In many aspects this was quite a unique beer, especially for the style. They threw plenty of hops in, and gave it a proper Belgian yeasting, while leaving it nice and strong, and boozy. The very finish of the taste is wonderfully refreshing, with a delicate flowery sweetness that is otherwise hard to replicate in taste."
"The aroma was very solid. Nice light fruit notes, with a very well hidden Brett profile. Light grains and a touch of a fresh grass like hoppiness sneaking in as it warmed up. Light and delicate flavor with a crispness that was very nice. Clean with little in the way of funk showing up here. Light grains and some peach and pear/apple notes that were followed up nicely with the slightest amount of sour flavor, just enough to let you know it was there. Smooth and mellow with a light feel that was well carbonated and easy to drink."
"Its Friday night and had to already endure a hockey game, and birthday party....its time for some me time!!!! Cracked a Lagunitas Little Sumpin Wild...and its pretty decent!!! The color is unfiltered and golden. Massive floaties in this beer, which I dont necessary like....I think it gives me gas! The awesome whites head laced beautifully! The smell has a lot of citrus to it, but not over bearing! The taste is tart and heavier on the grapefruity....doesnt come off the pallete right away. Lingers somewhat. The mouthefeel is ok the higer ABV would make it tough to do an all-nighter!"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are full and rich but extremely well balanced. Really nice hop profile alongside the other flavors mixed in. The 8.85% abv is also pretty much completely hidden here."
"Flavour is malty sweet with dark fruit, but perfectly balanced by the refreshing hops. Leaves a pleasing yeasty aftertaste and lingering silky mouthfeel. Alcohol is not a noticeable presence even though this beer is over 8% ABV. A very unique, excellent beer."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I think I prefer A Little Sumpin' Sumpin', but I would recommend this and would drink it again."
"O: Great beer. Honestly I thought this was a DIPA at times and not a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Very drinkable. Looking forward for this coming out again."
"Excellent. Hoppy and complex. So many different tastes. I like the price too, a good beer I can purchase again!"
"pours a beautiful clear, bright, gold with a substantial head. Smells of yeasty bananas, some summer wheat, a bit of orange spice. Tastes much more of hops than I would have expected, wow, not in the scent. Mellowed hops in the front, some bread like qualities on the backend. Mouthfeel is bait on the dry side, not bad. Overall, nice beer but did not wow me."
"Poured into a snifter this beer is golden/amber, a bit cloudy with a 1/2"" white head. Smells very bready, citrus, vanilla yogurt, juicy hops and a sun tan lotion smell I get from belgian/belgian style beers, not a bad thing. The taste is spot on from the nose, mildly sour, sweet, bready, vanilla, and citrus, and such juicy hops. Mouthfeel is very pleasant with a dry finish and mild carbonation. Overall a real treat as with almost everything from Lagunitas. Highly recommended."
"Overall: A great interpretation of this style. I would call it a Tripel IPA more than a Belgian Strong Pale ale, though."
"MF: Medium to heavy bodied, this one is not that strong in body, yet huge in flavors."
"Well carbonated. But, primarily unpleasant."
"O. If only I had more of this in my fridge I would be set. Fantastic beer throughout. Lagunitas did a great job with this brew. I will be keeping my eye out for more."
"Overall a good beer. I've had 8 of the top 10 Belgian Strong Pale Ales listed here on BA, but this is a fucking joke. I'd never dream of putting this beer in the same category as Duvel. Duvel is untouchable. Good beer? Yes. Belgian Strong Pale Ale? Bitch please..."
"Drinkability: The amount of hops on this destroy the palate, so only one of these in an evening, thank you. It was an enjoyable beer, though I'm not certain this would end up in my crate again."
"Happy St. Patty's"
"4.5 D: I never had this fresh, but I can't imagine it ever tasted better than it does now. Simply fantastic. This would be a damn tasty IPA by itself, but the Belgian character shines through and complements the hops better than I ever would have imagined. By all means, this is a Belgian IPA and easily the best one I've ever had."
"Maybe we need a new category for brews like this...very nice take on an old style, but with a very well done west coast kick to it."
"D: It's strong at 8.85% abv so it can't be a 5, but it's delicious! I want to keep drinking it even though it builds a buzz quickly. A great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall a really nice beer. It's light, crisp and tasty, while still having a delicious fullness."
"D - Wow, I paid $4 for this bomber? Really solid, flavor beer that has a lot to offer, especially given it's preice point. I need to go but more of this pronto. Definitely recommended!"
"Poured a 2"" head which was slow to dissipated. Light amber in color. Smell has citrus and orange and hops. Taste is more of the same and it's really like a medium IPA with a little something off about it (not off bad, just off different). Unique, though I'm not sure it's my 1st choice."
"Dammit, I was going to open an Abyss tonight and she talked me into this damn thing!"
"From now on I'm just gonna grab a 6-pack whenever I see these Little Sumpin brews! Earns a repeat purchase hands down."
"Overall I'd been waiting a while to try this beer and I wasn't disappointed. A very well done beer with some interesting idiosyncracies. Well worth a shot."
"D: The beer is quite drinkable considering its strength because for the most part the alcohol is well masked."
"Pours out a golden-amber with a sticky, frothy and full off white head. Excellent lacing after each sip. Smell consists of intense pine notes, grapefruit rinds, and just a touch of alcohol. Taste begins with toasted malt character, followed by a wave of caramel sweetness. Spicy resinous hops then barrage the palate, bringing those pine and grapefruit characteristics into full swing, with some lighter citrus notes tailing behind. Sweetness lingers around with this brew, lots of brown sugar and caramel noted. The finish is moderately bitter with just a slight alcohol presence noticeable. Hops leave a lasting impression on the tip of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this one has a lighter feel to it, much more than expected. Oily resinous hops leave a slick coating and the carbonation is moderate. Overall, this brew is super smooth. There is hardly any alcohol noticeable due to the seemingly intense focus on hop character. This beer is dangerously drinkable and affordable."
"just as good as lil sumpin but made with wild yeast; had on tap at a local eatery. Slightly sweeter, maybe this is because of the yeast strain used to brew the beer. Joshua says sweet like a belgian almost, I thought it tasted about the same. But if you like lil sumpin, you'll like this one too!"
"D - I mistakenly assumed this to a Wild Ale when I purchased it until I looked it up just before opening it. While I'm not disappointed by this beer at all, it's drinkability was lower than I had set myself up for. Awesome use of the yeast strain though!"
"Served chilled, in a Westmalle chalice."
"How could you turn this down?!"
"It's an OK beer that I don't think I would buy again. The guys I shared it with seemed to think it was ok."
"Very nice beer."
"D- very easy to down the pint, and no question to order another"
"At first sip you get a big punch of sour alcohol as to be expected with this 8.85% by volume beer. But after it settles into the pallet it mellows nicely with fruity sourness. With this drink I ate organic green chile cheddar cheese. What a great pairing! The creamy rich spicy flavor - with the puckering apple alcohol! Cheers"
"Don`t know what else to say. Good quality beer."
"»Wow. This is sumpin wild. I don`t exactly know what this is other than good. At 8.85% very easy to drink, and drink, and drink."
"A nice double IPA for thise who like them sweet and juicy, and another great, reasonably price beer from a stellar brewery. Lagunitas should get more plaudits than they do."
"Good ""Belgian"" IPA, reminds me of Flying Dog's Raging Bitch. The hops are still the main player (like in all of Lagunita's beers) but the yeast was a nice touch."
"Upon trying Lil sumptin wild i was more then pleased by it! The smell of it was delicious hints of citrus and pineapple, the first taste was even better and was very drinkable even at 8.85% aloc. This has easily become a constant Brew that is in my fridge at all times! Enjoy!"
"Overall I enjoyed this quite a bit and have recommended it to friends. No real sense of booziness, and immediately wanted another one. One of my favorite Lagunitas offerings."
"Pours deep golden, quite luminous, with good clarity. Nose is a delight with mixed fruit, barnyard musty notes, and minerals water. Palate lives up to expectations with A pleasant Brett funk, herbal flavors, and a quasi-honey biscuity quality. Finishes with minerally flavors."
"Drinkability - Definitely some drinkability to this beer with such a wonderful display of hop flavor. I wish more of the Belgian yeast flavors were displayed in the overall profile of this beer, as it would help to balance the rather intense fruitiness. Definitely a Belgian-style IPA, although I wish the Belgian characteristics were more present, as I think they would emphasize the wonderful aromas and flavors brought on by the hops. An enjoyable beer for hop lovers."
"I've had a couple bottles of this and can definitely recommend drinking it at a colder IPA temperature than a more moderate wild ale temperature. It moderates the sweetness and balances out the flavor nicely."
"D - This beer if very drinkable. It has a great flavor, and it goes down very smooth. It is a very relaxing drink. This one really surprised me. It's delicious. I highly recommend trying this one if you see it around."
"Overall impression: Looks great, smells great, tastes great. Lagunitas, please make this stuff again."
"Drink- Pretty damn good. When I drank it I had no idea the style. I get it now. With the yeast and the light feel. Fits the style."
"Overall: I was looking for trying this one as I really like the Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale ... but nothing like it. I was hoping for more floral-type hoppiness in this one, and I felt left down...no hop for me, just pineapple (pineapple taste from hop?). I like pineapple, but not so much in beer. Still a very decent beer. Is this supposed to be a Belgian yeast strain? If so, not as floral as I would have expected (good). Good beer for me, but perhaps not in a 22 oz bottle."
"May be my favorite of the Little Sumpin' series to date, though not really a 'wild' ale as I understand the concept."
"Another enjoyable brew from Lagunitas. They've yet to disappoint."
"D - goes down easy."
"I opened a second right after the first one finished. 8.85% ABV is a shock for such a smooth beer. I will definately get a few more of these."
"D- This beer is all about the hops and I didn't think there was anything really ""wild"" about this one. The Westmalle yeast is definitely here, but I just found that the hops overpowered everything else. A decent beer though!"
"D: Very drinkable and have had more than one on several occasions. Highly recommended to fans of the Little Sumpin' Sumpin'."
"Clear gold pour with a 2-finger, foamy, white head. The aroma is orange, lemon and grapefruit with with sweet honey and cereal grains, complemented by some Belgian candi, soft yeastiness, bubblegum, and toffee. The flavor is much more dominated by the Belgian character than the aroma. Lots of pungent clove and bubblegum esters upfront with a healthy dose of honey, candi sugar, and creamy wheat in the middle. The hops come out strong on the finish with lots of bright orange peel and lemon and a long bitter grapefruit note lingering afterward. The body is creamy and full with lots of gentle carbonation."
"D: certainly enjoyable with the novelty of it all - at least to me. This ABV and the sweetness of it makes it a one and done type of beer but I would certainly grab this again in the future for something a little different"
"Drinkibility. Not bad. I like my hop fixes a little less sweet."
"This pours a nice orange color with a thick, foamy head. It smells very hoppy and citrusy. The flavor is very full, leaving no doubt that this is a Belgian style ale. The heavy body and yeast almost knocks you down. It is smooth and well balance for being such a strong beer. I taste malt followed by strong hops. It is not boozy like you might expect. I don't love Belgian beers, they are almost always too sweet in my opinion. This beer is pretty good though."
"O: Another very good effort from Lagunitas. A nice change of pace from Hop Stoopid with the Westmalle yeast. Similar enough to be recognized, but different enough to provoke thought. Interesting beer, and one I will go back for as often as possible for $3.50 a bomber."
"Drinks ok but I'm not real anxious to have it again."
"Pushing through the initial character is difficult but you are rewarded with an unusual yet interesting balanced combination of flavors. The mouthfeel was distracting but it does become a bit more tolerable and almost smooth once the mouthcoating becomes entrenched."
"Feels great on palate, nice and carbonated to go with the lighter texture, but doesn't feel as light as a saison (like lost abbey red barn ale for example). Drinkability is awesome."
"Poured into a pint glass, no bottled on date available. Gave a great golden color with a nice white 1 finger head that dissipated quickly. A bit of carbonation initially when poured is visible. The smell i have to say i was impressed with. I get a lot of the fruit and hops. I know this is brewed with a wild yeast strain and i don't know if it is that smell the primarily overwhelms my pallet or something else. It definitely is a wild smell. The taste is right along with the smell, the wild smell carries right onto the tongue. A really wild taste but for all its worth i don't think that it helps cover the alcohol as well as it could; I just mean to say i can tell this is AVB 8.85%. I would probably drink a bit more of this ale if it were a little easier on the wallet. But no complaints, Lagunitas is a great brewery and i like all of their brews. Thanks"
"O: A really unique and impressive brew. I can't say that I would sit down and ahve 3 or 4 of these, however, I would buy it again as a nice unique treat."
"D - Very drinkable. My bomber went quickly even though it is 8.85%"
"D: Here is a beer that would stand out in a crowd of other Lagunitas brews--due in large part to the characteristics imparted by the abbey yeast used here. While certainly adding interest, the qualities encountered here aren't all desirable, compared to their IPA and Hop Stoopid. Once or a few times a year is fine, but this is not a flavor profile the typical IPA-lover would want to be stuck with. While not reviewed here, I did sample this beer on-draft during a recent visit to the brewery and found it to be generally more appealing, with less emphasis on the funk and more vibrant hop aromatics."
"D: An unusual take on the style, to be sure. Very drinkable, though."
"Wild? Wildy fruity, that's for sure. And much more Belgian IPA than Belgian Strong Pale Ale. But who cares what's it's called, this is just a high quality quaff. How is it possible Lagunitas stuff sells for less than $5 a bomber four time zones east of its origin? I'm not complaining!"
"bomber sample- beautiful golden straw with a moderate white head, and sticky lacing. Excellent clarity. Nose- pine, fruity, spice, soapy. Taste- very interesting interplay of bittering hops and belgian yeast esters of floral fruitiness along with some citrus notes. Body and carbonation is spot on. A very dry finish from the significant hopping. Very tasty!"
"This brew pours a semi see through golden hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy white two finger head which slowly recedes to leave a nice film right across the top with lacing everywhere,the smell is really nice and reminds me of a hot summer's day which is like today and the aromas are pineapple,mango,citrus,paw paw and piney hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated which gives it that nice smooth feel and has tastes of mango,lychee,kiwi fruit,some light toffee and finishes with a floral hoppy finish,overall i really like this drop and will revisit as its damn tasty and perfect for a day like today."
"Creamy broken white head, slow dissipation, nice lacing over clear deep golden body, multiple streams of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. The Westmalle yeast is immediately present in the nose, floral and fruity esters, some sweetness aroma-wise and a goodly amount of hops for balance. Taste mirrors the nose but the hops are even more pronounced, citrusy finish not overly bitter, very interesting taste. Mouthfeel a wee bit on the full side of medium, really active effervescence, a bit sticky of a finish. Scary good drinkability, we didn't have any trouble finishing the bottle and really wish we had another. This was either a really hoppy BSPA or IMP a Belgian IPA. In either case, another winner from Lagunitas, hope I can have this on-tap sometime in the near future. Recommended."
"Definitely worth a try and I have a feeling that this beer will grow on you with every sip."
"I wouldn't buy another because this style is not my favorite, but for those of you who like a bit of hoppiness along with some good body, a really nice appearance in yer glass and a healthy 8.85 ABV at a very decent price, get one if you can."
"Overall, an excellent beer. Tastes less like a Belgian than it smells, but I really enjoyed this one."
"Really nice brew. Unique and interesting. Well balanced, tasty, and easy drinking."
"Drinkability - Yes. Will buy it when I find it. Excellent beer, and very reasonably priced. I'd pick this one over some more ""authentic"" Belgian beers even if they were the same price."
"Very tasty, but I was hoping for a better balance between the yeast and hop flavors."
"D - Very very much so. No alcohol burn and it just goes down nice and easy. Great game day beer IMO."
"Little Sumpin' WILD lacks the vivacity, charm and siren drinkability that Little Sumpin' Sumpin' possesses. It's like a stand-in for that beer and, having paid full price for this bomber, makes me a little disappointed to find out. It wouldn't make any Beer Gone Wild videos, that's for sure. No matter, this bottle was still an unregrettable one night stand."
"This stuff is close to to drinkable, the stuff is very strong and the alcohol isn't nearly as perceivable as you would think in a beer this big."
"This is not a subtle beer, quite the opposite- it is almost inelegant in its presentation- this a brute force of a beer. An atom bomb of flavor with a dryness that lingers on the palate, letting you know whose bitch you are. This is a, to use a film cliche, tour de force beer. It will definitely give the palate a workout, but is well worth the experperience. The willingness to take an awesome beer like Sumpin' Sumpin' and add Belgian yeast to it, to further push the envelope, is why Lagunitas is my favorite brewery."
"Well, truth in advertising, I can always appreciate - a stock (in a good way) Lagunitas strong ale, leavened by the addition of some old-school monk-yeast. The result: exactly what one would expect - a slightly yeast-tinged (a Westmalle joint, yo), usual suspect hop and malt bomb. An interesting experiment, what with the familiar West Coast eye-opener, melded onto a sudden realization of noble Belgian heritage. Wild, in doubt? 'Wild', indeed."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with very little head to speak of. A thin lace ring stays with the beer throughout the session. The aroma is one of fruit (I swear I smell a cider) yeast and hops. I love the taste of this beer. It has a variety of things going on. Nice sweet fruit taste at the beginning and finishes with a nice amount of hop bitterness and a nice amount of alcohol taste. Medium body with mild carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer for an 8+% ABV. Overall I really enjoy this beer. At $5 for a bomber this is also a great value."
"O: This was very good. I think it fits better into the Belgian IPA category."
"Medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Very drinkable ad well balanced. This is an interesting take on a quasi Belgian ipa. For almost 9% abv it is hidden quite well but the Belgian phenols become increasingly evident as the brew warms."
"Drinkability: An amazing beer that is dangerously easy to drink with the almost 9% ABV. Not necessarily the most traditional Belgium strong pale ale but an amazing addition the Lagunitas lineup."
"Apple juice-golden hue with a two finger white head, decent retention. Noticeable hop aroma. Dare I say it wouldn't be a Lagunitas brew without it? Yes, I do. Some yeast aromas, too. Kinda sweet with a more upfront pine-almost-grapefruit aroma. I'm also smelling just a hint of melon. Chewy texture, like a thick Belgian Pale Ale, no strong carbonated presence. There's an interesting play with the hops and the 'wild' aspect of the beer. This beer as some subtle 'funk' to it, for sure, but it's not sour. It's more like a tangerine flavor. It plays with the hops in a curious manner. Burnt-sweet malt flavors, too. There's some hope aftertaste with a sour-sweet finish. Lagunitas has a way with their beers, especially when trying to make things come together. Like I've said in the past, all the right flavors are there, just not always working together. There seems to be a little more team work in this beer, but I'm not in love with the conclusion. Definitely worth a try, just not going back for seconds."
"A Little Sumpin' Wild has got it. It's got a good American hop flavor, and it's got the Westmalle yeast to yield sweet flavors from the malt. This is like A Little Sumpin' Extra taking a trip to Belgium. Excellent stuff at a great price; only $4.49 for a bomber at Total Wine."
"D - tasty and light with no hint of the higher ABV, very easy drinking, Lagunitas does it again!"
"Overall, this is a great brew, highly drinkable, really delicious, but the ABV does come to get you."
"Lots of effervescence on the tongue. Good pale malt start but it fades quickly to a strong hop of black pepper and grapefruit rind. Could easily pass for a Belgian-style IPA. Rich feel to the mouth despite the high carbonation. The finish has a bit of piney hop to it"
"D - Pretty easy to drink with its light flavors and enticing flavors."
"I suspect this brewer, like a few others (Rogue), hop heavier for the style than I think appropriate. If so, good to know ahead of time. Overall, though, its a good beer if a bit off style."
"Pours a clear, golden orange color with a nice frothy, white head. Good head retention and lacing. Smells very floral and tropical. Tropical fruits, that certain belgian yeast element is present, citrus, pineapple, tangerine. Damn good. Tastes of more tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, ...belgian yeastiness, more tangerines, orange peel, slight white pepper, so good. I could drink this sweet nectar all night long and hope to remember it."
"22oz bottle into a Hopus glass pours a crisp bubbly orange with a nice fluffy off white head that lasts and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is crisp Earthy citrus hops and a nice kick of Belgian spice in front of sweet biscuit malts. The taste is smooth citrus hops up front with a nice kick of spices, followed by a nice bitter citrus hop finish. The beer is only slightly heavy, with smooth carbonation and mild dryness. This is a very interesting and enjoyable beer from Lagunitas, I hope this becomes at least an annual release."
"Other comments: The ""Wild"" thing is a little misleading. When I bought it, I thought it would have some wild yeast in it or something."
"Had this on tap at their brewpub on a hot day and on a cold rainy day, either way works fine."
"My brother wanted to be clever and review this beer, so he said: ""the wild citrus flavor dances upon my tongue frivolously in the night as I thirst for revenge."" Wow. I'm speechless."
"D-excellent value. I would gladly pay the 3 bucks again for this bomber...very nice"
"It's interesting that this beer is labeled as a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. To me this beer tastes, smells and drinks more like a Double IPA. This is by far my favorite offering from Lagunitas that I have had."
"D - Good drinkability, not overpowering."
"D - This stuff is fantastic and I could drink it all night. The ABV is incredibly well hidden, and the sweet fruity hops make it absolutely delicious. This company pumps out winners like no other!"
"Very drinkable. I love this beer and it's a style that I usually do not like."
"D - At 72 IBU's and 8.85% ABV I would say that this is very drinkable. It leaves a warm feeling that persuades the mind in to wanting just one more pint of deliciousness."
"This beer isn't exactly true to the style (it's hoppy and the hops are distinctly American tasting) but it is very delicious and far too drinkable. Great price, too. It's even better on tap, though when I had it on tap I was way too far gone to write a proper review. This beer can knock you on your rear before you know what happened."
"Overall, I don't think this is as good a beer as Sumpin' Sumpin' was, but it's still a very high quality beer worth having, especailly at Lagunitas prices."
"bomber from WF Arlington"
"too me this just tastes like Hop Stupid or Sumpin Extra with some Belgian yeast and that's not a bad thing but I doubt a new hybrid style will come as a result. just a little Belgian flair for our well loved West Coast hop bombs this ones worth trying without doubt"
"M/D-leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but a great beer. easy drinker, super smooth, amazing value...less of a BSPA to me and more like an IPA."
"It's eminently drinkable and you get a lot of hoppy flavors and not a lot of bitterness. There is a hint of bitterness right at the front, but it dissipates quickly and changes to grapefruity, west coast style hop flavor. The balance that is struck between the hope flavor and the belgian yeast really makes this a drinkable, everyday kind of beer."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking. Excellent beer."
"Pours more clear than expected, with a nice head. Some nice hops on the nose. Much more hop taste than expected- but very tasty. I agree with others that this is not ""Belgian"" enough for me, but is a nice beer, more a DIPA. Would drink again for sure,and will know what to expect."
"This is one of those beers where I find myself torn between the fact that this is a pretty tasty, well-made brew by the folks at Lagunitas and the fact that it's also just not quite my cup of tea. This is not to mention the fact that, quite simply, the addition of the Westmalle yeast seems to take the back seat to the hoppiness of this beer and doesn't strike me as remarkably Belgian."
"Cheers!"
"D- Very tasty beer. Easy to drink and much hoppier than expected."
"Drinks easy, nice effort. Somewhat reminds me of Boulevard Tank#7"
"D: I usually like Lagunitas beers but this one did not impress me. For me this is an average at best beer...probably won't want to try this one again."
"I hade this on tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel. It followed my first taste of 10-10-10. This beer pours with a red tint. Smell is very hoppy. I would call this a Strong Belgian IPA. The hop flavor is really strong when first poured. It tasted like a weak Nugget Nectar. As it warmed the Belgian flavor was more dominant. Goes down easier when warmer."
"Medium-light body, with nice, high carbonation. Dry finish. This beer hides the alcohol very well, making in dangerously drinkable."
"Not funky in the least, but a very tasty, balanced, and easy-drinking Belgian-influenced hoppy ale. (A great value to boot!)"
"Had this on-tap at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul. No, it wasn't terribly wild, but it was a fine hoppy Belgian pale ale. I was surprised how well these guys pulled off the mix of peppery Belgian yeast character with fruity hops. I'd say the brewery has made good use of the Westmalle strain. Check it out."
"D: A dangerous brew at nearly 9% ABV, but quite balanced and tasty with a nice, aesthetic showing indeed. Perhaps not the most traditional Belgian strong pale you could imagine, but one with distinct American flair and bitterness. A nice brew and one I'd definitely have again."
"this drinks, tastes and feels like a DIPA, and a very good one to boot, but i just wished it had more of that westmalle yeast strain. its there, but hardly. still a great tasting, hard hitting IPA. and if thats what you want, definatly worth a try, if you want more of a belgian thing, look for something else."
"A Little Sumpin' Wild is not the American Wild Ale I expected. Perhaps I should read the forums more. Nonetheless, it is a very good Belgian Strong Pale Ale. The use of American hops certainly adds some pizzazz to already tasty style, and gives it a unique flavor. The only complaint I have is that the body's a little too thin. Good stuff otherwise...in typical Lagunitas fashion."
"D- Very enjoyable and easy to drink. 8.85% ABV is not noticeable at all. Good price and will be buying another bottle or two very soon."
"D-A good beer at a very good price. Not certain it is true to style. It has elements similar to a barleywine and similar to American strong ale. The yeast presence is what makes it similar to a BSPA."
"Really good overall. ALmost a cross between a tropical IPA and a saison."
"I'm not typically a huge fan of the Belgian IPA class of brews, but this one is actually quite tasty. Would be kick-ass with sweet and sour pork."
"Drinkability: Given that it's 8.85% abv I was surprised to find it served in Imperial pints at my local; but that didn't stop me from having two in a row! My friends (who are not quite as well versed in beer) enjoyed it as well, and it was agreed that although it's not ""WILD", it does have a good deal of character going for it. It's easy to consume, and remarkably compelling to the experienced taster, leaving me to give it the highest rating for drinkability. I've bought a few bottles, and given its price to satisfaction ratio I may just put out the hundred or so bucks for a whole case to cellar."
"This has been one of my go-to brews when I don't know what I want. It's always tasty, always goes down smooth. the alcohol is surprisingly hidden and the belgian yeast is beautifully and subtly integrated. I'm not a big belgian IPA fan, but this one is absolutely perfect."
"Notes: Another hoppy hit from Lagunitas well worth seeking out, and again the price/quality ration is outstanding. I've had it on tap also a few months back and it was equally delicious. These bombers took a while to show around but it is a very welcome presence."
"drinks really well. would like them to ditch the ""wild"" name, but i didnt mark them down for it. wild does not quite describe this beer, while a Belgian IPA would be a bit closer. Overall, a terrific brew, and probably the best Lagunitas I have had."
"D - Delicious and refreshing beer. I really enjoyed this one and would definitely have it more often."
"D: Was really blown away with this one considering I wasn't expecting much. Great BSPA, with a nice addition of hop flavor. ABV and carbonation cuts down the drinkability a notch. Can't wait for the day Lagunitas makes its way to AL."
" This is I think possibly the worlds perfect beer, I am highly awaiting its next release"
"Pours an ultra clear gold, with a decent off-white head that patches to the glass. Smell is a bit hot, but contains a very pleasing blend of candied fruits and spices. I'm liking this one right away. Taste starts off with some bubblegum and dives right into the spicy Belgian yeast. A segue into sweet grapefruit hops follows, and by the end, an assertive bitterness leaves me wanting another drink. All the while, a mellow base allows room for all the other flavors to happen. In the end, this is a subtle beer, but is so complex.. Even a touch of alcohol feel isn't enough to dampen this brew whatsoever. It reminds me a lot of Raging Bitch, and that is not a bad thing whatsoever. A great beer imo."
"I'll enjoy this bottle and grab another one for a different night, but cannot drink another one tonight."
"I hope they intend on brewing it more."
"D: This is very unique and probably best qualified as a Belgian IPA."
"Very nice beer. A beautiful copper color with a light, lingering beige head. Strong smell of hops. Flavor is very citruisy/grapefruit. Mouthfeel and taste is light on alcohol but fairly rich and malty. One of my current faves. An extremely delicious and affordable brew."
"D-Lots going on to keep things interesting, and it's a smooth, delicious beer that gets more interesting as it warms up. Gets a little cloyingly spicy-sweet and alcohol, but still very drinkable for a beer of this strength. Great job."
"A well-done experiment on the part of Lagunitas, rather than with attaining balance from the malt they mannaged to pull it off with the yeast. Can't call it a new go-to beer, but I look forward to enjoying a few more bottles of this from time to time while it's available."
"- Overall very cool of Lagunitas to do... it certainly turned out great, and is one of the more unique brews I have had of late. Thumbs up."
"Anyway...this is a very interesting, good, spicy wild brew. 8.85%?? No wonder I am rambling with this review. Great, drinkable beer overall- I've loved all three Little sumpin' brews I have had so far"
"D - Well I know of a couple of shops still carrying this and at the price, which is cheap, I will need to secure one last one before they are gone. A must try for Lagunitas fans!"
"This is really an impessive beer. I've enjoyed the Lil Sumpin series and this is another winner. The hoppiness is really nice and the Belgian yeast gives it a very nice complementary quality. A nice marriage of flavors and a really tasty beer that I will be seeking out again."
"I had this at the brewery in the fall of 2010 and was blown away glad we are getting this seasonal in Alberta. Obviously with Lagunitas this is a hop oil grapefruit bomb, I don't really pickup the Westmalle/Westvleteren yeast maybe just a hint more fruitiness. Hope to enjoy many more of these before they are gone."
"Poured my growler into SA Perfect Pint glass. Pours a bright orange amber color with about 2 healthy inches of head. The head quickly disappears. Strong aromas of hops and scents of the wild yeast. The flavor is very hoppy, floral and citrus up front. The belgian yeast strain adds good flavor punch. Mouthfeel is mostly smooth, a lil oily. This is drinkable enough I will enjoy this growler."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"deliciously drinkable., wish my aunt hadnt stolen half my bomber, will have to try this one again"
"22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on Aug. 31st. Its been in my fridge for over a month so hopefully it hasn't deteriorated too much. Pours a golden yellow with a solid 3/4 inch of creamy head. Lots of lacing. Quite a bit of carbonation. Looks awesome. Sweet candy malt and sharp, bitter hops on the nose. Smells like a Belgian triple and an imperial IPA (can you say Le Freak). Very smooth, almost creamy texture but not heavy. Lighter bodied than I expected. Very drinkable. The taste is very well balanced. For such a unique beer, there is nothing really overpowering about it but it maintains an appealing complexity. I get hit with the sweet malt and the spicy quality that must come from the yeast. Then the resiny hops come in and linger through the finish but they don't dominate, they just add an extra dimension to the flavor profile. Okay, I'll say it: this is a great beer. Very well crafted."
"I might also add that I think this beer is mis-classified as a BSPA. Belgian IPA may be a better category, or maybe even give it the ever-so-vague American Strong Ale appellation."
"glassware: pint"
"It's an odd beer, and an interesting experiment. I wouldn't want to drink this all the time, but it was worth trying for sure."
"Drinkability is ok, it's certainly smooth for the ABV, I'd definitely not guess it's strength by taste or smell. As a pale ale, it's good. As a Belgian IPA, it's passable. With the boasting of the wildness, combined with the usual dankness of Lagunitas' IPAs, I'm disappointed. However, like all their beers, it's an exceptional value relative to it's peers."
"Pours a pale orange colour with thin white head with some mild lacing surrounding the glass. Smells of citrus hops with a nice Belgian yeast aroma. Mild bitterness, but some tarty sweetness as well. Quite a nice Belgian pale ale. I was actually expecting some type of sour ale from the name, but this is quite good too, so I'm not disappointed."
"I really enjoy this beer for its outlandish style; this hoppy beer is accompanied by an amazing malt character. The color is beautiful, it pours well, generates a good head if poured correctly, enjoy with a snifter. Tastes like a full, citrusy IPA with hints of grapefruit--the yeast/malt strays it from straight forward in a neutral way. Do try."
"I gave the drinkability a 5 because this was the lightest tasting beer I have ever had with damn near 9% ABV."
"D- I thought this one was pretty boring and probably something that I wouldn't seek out again. I was hoping for more....oh well."
"D: All right."
"Drinkability: The original still remains my favorite of the Sumpin' Series. Many of the Lagunitas hoppy brews just run together for me. This is good though, and, quite importantly, sold at a good, welcome price."
"22oz bottle served in my Southern Tier tulip. Pours a translucent honey-gold/orange with a loose, half inch, bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a thick, loose band around the edges and a soapy slick across the surface. Some thin strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose suggests aromatic hops, citrus, a touch of spice (coriander) and maybe a trace of candi sugar. In some regards, it actually reminds me a little of a Belgian IPA. Taste follows nose - definitely comes off as a Belgian IPA/Strong Pale hybrid in my opinion. There's also a subdued tropical fruit character, as suggested by the label, but it is somewhat buried behind the herbal/earthy hops bittering. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a prickly carbonation and a slightly oily texture across the tongue. Citrus astringency lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. Interesting and complex, albeit closer to a Belgian IPA than a Belgian Strong."
"Poured into a pint glass poured a rustic amber color with a fluffy foamy head, nice lace on the glass. Smell had a funky citrus hop character to it. Taste was spot on, this was very similar to A little sumpin sumpin with that belgian type of quality to it, bitter but smooth balanced by the malt and a bit of a pepper like finish towards the end with hints of a bit of cedar. Overall I truly enjoyed this fine offering."
"D - Very drinkable. It drinks like a good to great IPA."
".""Fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain"" Appearance? Much like a regular west coast IPA!!, that is orange,clear and with an off white bubbly head. Arma again is typical hoppy IPA territory but with an intrigueing yeast profile that sets it somewhat apart. The taste is were the ""Belgian yeast"" style flavours emerge strongly and meld very well and surprisingly with the pney/juicy IPA hope profile. Nice thick palate, plenty chewy but not cloying. Overall a nice ,unusual hybrid."
"Typically, I am not so much of a fan of this beer style. I like really hoppy IPA, and I appreciate a well made Belgian, but I have rarely had a beer where I feel both styles are represented equally well. This beer is an outlier though; it is very hop-forward and reminiscent of a west-coast ale, but the Belgian notes really come through on the nose and taste. Another great offering from the crew at Lagunitas! Cheers guys and please keep them coming!"
"Drinkability is good, at 8.whatever a few 22s of this beer would have me off my rocker, as the alcohol hides well behind the spiciness of the yeast and the hops. Drinker beware."
"Well, stylistically, this doesn't quite fit; though re-name it a Belgian IPA and you'd be on to something. Very refreshing and tasty despite this (too good to downgrade based on concerns of style really)...and a great value."
"D: I was first introduced to this brew about two months ago, as someone recommended it to me. Now I can't put it down. Recommended to those who like to spruce things up a bit while still getting your hop fix."
"Edit: Went out today to find a case, but could only get 5 bottles. I'll keep looking for more."
"There is a good amount of depth here, but it lacks a defining characteristic. That said, everything works in unison and it's pleasant enough to drink. At $4 a bomber, I'll be seeing this frequently as it fills a couple niches reasonably well."
"Drinkability...what can I say, 8.85% is what is says on the bottle and I taste about zero of it, the only reason you know it's high alc is the malty characteristics but otherwise this is as drinkable as your standard mellow session brew."
"This is a quality, drinkable beer. Love American-Belgian experiments like this."
"D- I really enjoyed this one and it seemed to grow on me as it warmed."
"Poured into a Brooklyn snifter. Cloudy amber color with a nice frothy head. Lots of lacing. Great citrus and hop aromas. Grapefruit seems to be the most prevalent. The taste is more of the hops and grapefruit. Nice bitter aftertaste. I haven`t had all the Sumpin` beers yet but I`ve yet to have a bad one. For a beer thats almost 9% ABV its nicely drinkable. This is a damn good beer."
"I enjoyed this one much more than a little sumpin sumpin because there was more balance instead of scathing hop bitterness. They could scale back both malt and hops so the fruity belgian spices and yeast could shine."
" Wildly in love with this beer."
"Pours a golden orange colour with a decent amount of head. Smells so fresh and floral too. Tastes of very refreshing floral hops with just a hint of the the spicey finish from the westmalle malt. So damn delicious. I wish I had bought one more bottle of this while it was fresh. No hint of the alc % at all. Damn tasty beer."
"This time it was really more like a belgian blonde; derfinetely not advertised as an 8.5 percent belgian strong pale."
"The palate is pretty solid. Spicy and phenolic , this is clearly fresh. This gives way to a moderate fruit character, tropical and citrusy. Bitterness is grapefruit-like. The finish recaptures the spice flavor, with sweetened cloves and a drying, almost bay leaf-like herbal character. The yeast is expressed more in spices rather than a pure, yeasty note. Again, the sweetness is low, just a little caramel and not much else. Drying and bitter on the finish with some fruity sweetness, this beer is light in body with moderate carbonation. As it warms up, the alcohol does appear, especially on the palate and its interaction with the spice is interesting. This beer is very well executed, but ultimately, it's not a style I can drink a lot of. However, this beer pretty much nails it because the bitterness is low enough not to be whelming in conjunction with the moderate spice character that's present."
"I'm not sure this is a BSPA, I don't think it's supposed to be. There are some estery elements, but there's nothing that screams ""wild"" (in a funky sort of way) other than the strong, fruity hop flavors and a solid, spicy Belgian yeast quality. Tasty stuff..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Again, I wish that I had a fresher bottle. Never the less, this still taste pretty good. Glad I got a chance to try it."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! Wow, what a complex aroma; sweet pale and Munich malt scent; lots of citrus hops; and a wonderful Belgian yeast character. The taste is good. It has a crisp, citrus hop bitterness along with a solid pale malt base and tremendous Belgian yeast finish. It's really hoppy; almost overly so. The Belgian yeast adds tons of complexity. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tasty beer. I love hops, but I wish it wasn't so bitter. The yeast esters take a backseat, unfortunately."
"This beer is immensely drinkable. The complexity of the finish brings me back to the glass again and again. Although the texture is substantial, it is in no way overbearing. The beer reminds me of the Stone Begi-Calique with a reduced yeast profile. I liked that beer quite a bit as well, if I remember correctly. This beer is excellent. It combines two of my favorite styles: American IPA and Strong Belgian ales. Good job Lagunitas."
"The label says ale, but this is definitely in the ipa family of beers."
"D- interesting brew for sure. There are some tell tale signs of the yeast used. The abv is barely noticeable and works well with the sweetness. Good but not great."
"Not very drinkable due to the high level of sweetness."
"Interesting hoppy flavor followed by a spicy yeast bite. Finishes pretty dry. Nicely balanced. Another good big beer from lagunitas. Drinkability is ok."
"D: A Little Sumpin' Wild is incredibly drinkable, even for a 22oz. 8.85% bottle that I'm tackling myself. Another top notch brew from Lagunitas."
"Yeast makes the beer have a softer feel and more fruit (light melons) than previous Sumpins. I like it better too. Hides ABV well, and hops are more flavoring than bittering. Grapefruit and honeydew melons galore. This is my favorite incarnation of the Sumpin' series, but the 'wild' nomenclature is misleading, as there is certainly no brett or bacteria here. I think this would fit better as a Belgian IPA vs. a BSPA as currently listed."
"Good beer. And a $5 for a 22 oz bottle certainly a good deal if you are looking for something different at a very reasonable price."
"Heat comes up and spikes the palate as we get further in...plenty of spice, matched with the mellow fruit factor. Tasty, tasty, tasty, yum, yum, yum."
"Overall, I would not recommend this beer. It was a huge disappointment. From now on I will stick to Lagunitas's IPAs and Strong Ales."
"D-I really didn't know what to expect with this one, kind of thought it would be a little sour, but it's basically an interesting American IPA with some Belgian yeast notes. Much better than the Belgian IPA's I've had."
"Review Edit: This brew really softens up through the 22 oz. Im digging it even more as it softens, and I feel the effects. nice!"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark gold color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops along with some bready malt. It tastes mostly like citrusy hops (tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange peel), with some pine hops, Belgian yeast, cloves and sweet malt noticable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with good carbonation. The soft carbonation in this brew makes it smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy it again."
"D - Fairly good offering. I liked this one but I don't think I would sit down and drink a bunch of these all at once."
"Spectacular!"
"Overall, I would call this a Belgian IPA. Similar to others, I just do not like these - there are some weird notes that I can't describe well. This reminded me some of Bruery's Mischief, but not as bad. I was bummed - I was hoping for a sour."
"It pours golden with a strong off white quarter inch head; Immaculate lacing as its fingers drip softly down the glass. Deep tones of pine and citrus, with subtle notes of bourbon. First sip brings hints of caramel, and the finish is dry with a slight fruit aftertaste."
"Overall: Im grading this as strickly an ipa. There's practically no Belgian qualities but it's delicious. Reminds on a lot of levels of their Hop Stoopid. In fact, for a buck cheaper I could have gotten a Hop Stoopid and gotten the same flavor profile. A tasty beer that ultimately misses it's inteaded target but is still very drinkable."
"So this should clearly be classified as a Belgian IPA, and it's a great interpretation of the style."
"Drinkability> yup"
"Right next to Little Sumpin, these are both great beers from Lagunitas. Highly recommended."
"Overall, my favorite incarnation of the Little Sumpin' series thus far. Quite good."
"Pours dark golden with a head that sticks around and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells fruity and a little sharp with wheat and lemon, tangerine, and melon notes. The taste is similar, with the addition of some passion fruit notes. Fruity and slightly sour and soft in the mouth. I like this beer, but perhaps not as much as the regular sumpin sumpin."
"This beer is sweet I will surely be buying these in the future. Well balanced and tasty !"
"I really like this beer. It's a Belgian style ale with West coast IPA hoppiness -- two of my favorite beer styles. It reminds me of Poperings Hommel Ale which is one of my favorite ales from Belgium."
"Despite the high level of alcohol, A Little Sumpin' Wild had a crisp clean citric summer-like quality, that with the aftertaste made it seem like drinking tangerine peel."
"Drinkability: West Coast IPA meets BSPA and that makes it different from the typical Belgian IPA as the citrusy hop character is more forward"
"D - The body and heat make this a sipper; it's a little sweet for me to have many, but I enjoyed the whole glass."
"Love Lagunitas so really looking forward to trying this bomber. Pours a nice golden color, hop aroma just exudes from the glass... never had such a pungent beer and I love it! Taste is medium to heavy bodied, nice mouthfeel and well balanced. For the ABV its surprisingly VERY smooth, lots of hop character too. This does taste similar to a lot of other Lagunitas offering mind you, but I happen to love how their beers taste. Nice clean finish, wayyyy too easy to drink. One of the better beers I've had in a while, highly recommended."
"A bit one-note: you've gotta love hops to love this one. Duvel is still the gold standard of this style."
"The third (and I think best) sumpin' that I have had the opportunity to try. Pours into the glass a deep golden color, with a huge, rocky 3 inches of white foam on top. Good hoppy aromas here, pineapple, lemon, orange zest, light pine. Light to medium bodied, easy to drink, refreshing, with more citrus, some wheat and really no alcohol to speak of. A very good beer."
"This brew is wild and I liken it to Scneider Hopfenweisse for some reason, thought it's not the same style."
" Defiantly coats the mouth, leaves a long lingering taste, but is still refreshing. Good Brew!"
"This one pours a perfect copper in color, light bodied with a one finger off white head. The smell is fantastic. It's almost an overpowering mix of hops and citrus with almost a taffy like sweetness. The taste doesn't quite live up the aromas but no worries. It's light and hoppy and doesn't give you cotton mouth but actually makes your mouth water. It's very tasty and an excellent interpretation of a Belgian Strong Pale. It drinks light and smooth and has light carbonation. I loved this one. I bought two while in Cleveland but wish I would've gotten more. This one really hit the spot."
"I really liked the sumpin sumpin, but have yet to find any variation besides the 'wild' I can taste the same grain and hops that appear in the regular that I can here. I love the fact that they used the westmalle yeast because they make amazing beers."
"This is one damn fine beer, hopefully it gets continued."
"Drinkability: Sweetness is a tad cloying and it actually turns my stomach just a bit by the end of the bomber; the weight is a bit much and ABV is clearly a little high for anything more than the 22 oz. that I picked up; overall though, I really dig where Lagunitas went with this one and it really is a good beer, despite the lower rating here. I think I would probably even limit myself to an 8-12 oz. serving to make sure I don't upset my stomach with this one in the future."
"D: I am still going to give the edge to ""Little Sumpin' Sumpin'"" because of its addictive fruitiness. This one is not quite addictive, but I'm glad Lagunitas offers this option."
"Duvel glass pour and I am met with a copper colored ale and a huge white foamy head with major lacing all over the glass. The aroma consists of orange, grapefruit, floral and light malt. The taste is very malty up front with an underlining sweetness with a bittering background and a further bitterness on the aftertaste. Not digging the ""wild"" part of this brew very much. Solid mouthfeel. A lot going on with the carbonation. The drinkability is low for myself as I finished the bomber but struggled on the bitter/sweet combo taste. Overall I was very anxious to try this, from one of my favorite breweries, but I was disappointed in the final product. I just wasn't impressed with yet another take on the Lil' Sumpin ale. The original is the best of the bunch."
"Ths beer is a slightly hazy gold, with a moderate head and lots of lacing. To my surpise this beer smells more like a Double IPA than a Pale Ale, the aroma is filled with hops and citrus and booze. The taste is very hoppy with obvious citrus notes and honey. If I were blind folded I would swear this is an IPA. This a great medium bodied beer. I can drink this over and over again.."
"This poured very well, the creamy but thick white head (I was sad to see it go in a few gulps) and it laced proper, it did. Crystal clear, too, a very light copper or amber, but on the pale side of that spectrum. The bouquet immediately hits with typical belgian yeast flavors (fruit, specifically peaches and banana) with hops (citrus, and maybe a few greener notes) intermingling. Gotta say, it's a nice combination, but, like with the taste, alcohol and (a little) plastic show through a touch. The malts are simply overshadowed by the esters and it finishes very dry (a touch astringent) with those hops (with which they must have been very generous). But again, a nice pairing of fruity american hop varietals with fruity belgian yeast. It can't help but feel a bit hot, and hides it less well than its belgian counterparts or other american IPAs, and tasting the alcohol through, does detract a bit from drinkability. If you want a glass of intense belgian fruitiness paired with american citrusy hops that still finishes dry? This one is for you."
"D- I would say that this is an American version of the style for sure if not for the hoppiness alone. Regardless, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these."
"This Little Sumpin' Wild is unquestionably different from the other wild ales I have tasted. Less ""wild"" character, more ""Left Coast IPA"" character and undoubtedly delicious!"
"D - A fantastic hop explosion. I followed up the first with a second."
"drinkability - this one is definitely a sipper but flavorful and has a nice hop profile on top of the traditional notes"
"- very drinkable belgian that seems pretty true to style with the addition of a little fresh hops; will definitely drink again; could easily (and did) drink multiple in one sitting; nice!"
"Overall, a good idea, but nothing special."
"So far everything I have had from Lagunitas has been great, and this is no exception. Pours a pale gold yellow with a giant sticky white head. Aroma is piney with just a hint of grassy yeast. Flavor starts out as a hoppy IPA, but then fades and finishes with a tad of sweetness. This is a really unique take on the style. Although I agree with some that it may be more a Belgian IPA, its still delicious. The sweetness keeps this from being just another IPA, and therefore very drinkible. Obviously the 8.8% ABV means you can't drink several. But the alchohol is so well hidden you feel like you could indulge in quite a few."
"This brew is great, but the high ABV would make many drinkers, stop and move on to a lighter brew. Still a great brew, might think of classifying this brew more of a belgian IPA, rather then a strong ale, but again. I wouldn't turn one down. Would love to try some of the others"
"D - decent beer, though I think the regular version is slightly better. this being that plus some extra yeast which distracts from a wonderful light yet hoppy beer."
"Well done, lah-goo-KNEE-tuss."
"D: overall, a very flavorful and enjoyable beer. A refreshing take on an IPA. It would have been a homerun, but it lacked some spiciness that I would expect in a Belgian style ale. I think this would be epic with a little spiciness and maybe a hint of brett. I'll still drink it again."
"D: A very drinkable beer. The alcohol is very hidden, I would have no idea that it's nearly 9%."
"Even as I wrote this review, I was thinking to myself ""the way I'm describing this beer makes it sound pretty good."" In fact, it probably is a pretty good beer, but I struggled to finish my glass and just did not particulary enjoy it. The good appearance and feel of this beer probably make its score a little higher than it otherwise would be, but in this case I think it shows that this is a well-made beer, so the score can stay where it is."
"Pours a clear amber with a light tan head that drops down to small, creamy foam. A really nice looking beer in the glass. Smell was lightly fruity with hints of citrus, but the taste really brought that forth in a much more forceful way. Very nice light malt flavor, shifting to a drying mildly bitter finish. Mouth feel and drinkability seems about right, neither excessively heavy nor thin. A great beer for the price."
"Taste: Very grassy bitterness right upfront but it fades nicely into a sweetness that is a great counter to the bitterness. The hop taste remains as an aftertaste but is milder then in the beginning which is really a nice balance."
"Mouthfeel: I'd enjoy this beer a bit more if it was a little more thin."
"D- Goes down surprisingly easy considering the ABV. Very interesting and a nice twist on the ""Little Sumpin'"" lineup."
"Interesting beer and another winner for Lagunitas."
"D - Very drinkable, quaffable even. Quite surprised by the 8% ABV, I wouldn't have guessed it's that high."
"An interesting brew, almost feeling like a hybrid style, or just a Belgian ale brewed with the American stamp all over it. I'm not sure if it really wows me, but it keeps me guessing, and that's something."
"D: Not a bad beer, and a decent take on the style. Not the best BSPA by any means, but a very drinkable and delicious beer."
"I thought this was a great beer, however because it is labeled and sold as a Belgian Strong Pale, I can't allow myself to give it a higher grade. This is not a Belgian Strong Pale, they took Westmalle Yeast and made an IPA which is fine if they market it as such. I will be drinking this again as I did enjoy it and it was pretty cheap at $5 a bottle. If you are trying to drink a Belgian Strong Pale this isn't for you."
"For an 8.85% alcohol beer they sure hide it well. Not much alcohol taste at all and it really goes down easy."
"D: I'm glad I tried it but won't revisit it again (in the bottle at least) - I would definitely like to try this on-tap though."
"Taste-Spicy hops, Belgian funk note, orange zest, nice hop bite throughout. Very well-balanced hops and Belgian spice. A bright, tangy, snappy very tasty brew. Highly recommended. Get some!!"
"O - Factoring in the very low price, I'll definitely be hunting a few more of these down."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, grapefruit citrus, mango, and orange citrus hops. In the taste, grapefruity citrus hops and dry fruit rinds. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry, citrus hop in the aftertaste. Big hops and big citrus fruitiness. Hides the alcohol and quite remarkable."
"A successful take on the Belgian Strong Pale style that takes some liberties, but still remains true to its roots. Probably my fav from Lagunitas thus far."
"A huge for on the Sumpins. I'd rather have Sumpin Extra, but this is a nice addition to the family."
"Overall, I really like this. I'm not sure that it's any better or worse than regular little sumpin ale, but is sure is good."
"Drinkability - No qualms with the drinkability. I'm sad the bottle is over, and I will definitely seek this out again. I may be in love with this beer."
"Drinkability - This is harder to drink than expected. Just a lot of flavor profile to deal with. Don't think I'll pick this up again, but worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was medium with lots of carb and good aftertaste. Overall, whatever, same old same old from Lagunitas. If you like their stuff you'll like this beer if you arent a fan avoid. Nothing else much to say, blah... in my opinion."
"Clear golden color with two fingers of white head that had good retention. Extensive lacing is left on the glass. Mainly hoppy grapefruit and citrus fruit in the aroma. The bottle says it is fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain. Could of fooled me. I do not detect anything reminiscent of Westmalle or Belgium for that matter. I suppose if I had this side by side with A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' I could find this Belgian influence, but as a standalone, I cannot. The hops are the main flavor influence with plenty of citrus. Alcohol even dominates the limited malt aspect of this beer. Has a nice body with a carbonation that gives a nice soft texture. Just not enough influence from the yeast to garner the $.08 per ounce premium over its sister brew. Otherwise it is a good wheat ale with a whole lot of hops."
"DB- An anomaly in a way but well done. California meets Belgium in an ale worth trying."
"Flavor is surprisingly good! I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a heck of a lot. A very nice mixture of fruit, hops, and very slight funk. The term ""Wild"" on the label doesn't mean this beer is a ""wild"" ale or ""sour"". Even though theres a slight funk...similar to a saison, its mostly sweet...and very drinkable! Medium, crisp mouthfeel...high carbonation, and slightly boozy. O, and not to forget the decent amount of hops! The fruit character once again is bringing to mind apple and pear. Overall a very decent and drinkable beer!"
"Appearance isn't that exciting, lots of head. Very sweet and very hoppy smell. Wow what a taste! Huge hops flavor, great hops profile. I haven't had the regular Little Sumpin, but this is really excellent. The belgian yeast gives a great and in your face hit of spice. All around a great beer. Only wish it wasn't so high in the ABV. If it were an DIPA, it would be my favorite one!"
"Picked this up on a whim because Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me and it was fairly cheap. Pours a dark, crystal clear, golden color with a big white head. Head is foamy and hangs around for awhile, leaves some nice lacing when it does recede. Smell is, surprisingly, lots of citrusy hops with a funky yeast backdrop. Taste is hops in the front with that familiar Belgian funkiness in the finish. Lots of spiciness with a hint of booze at the end as well. Medium bodied with a bit of stickiness to it. 8.85% will catch up with you quick but this is an otherwise very drinkable brew. Happy that I can still say Lagunitas has yet to let me down."
"mouthfeel is on the heavy side with adequate carbonation. pretty good drinkability factor; think i'll be picking up another. recommended."
"D- Overall, this is one of the more enjoyable beers that I have had lately. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone to try."
"D- like most lagunitas seasonals, i like this one very well. its also a nice twist on something they already make. the name is a little misleading. check this one out if you can. for $4 a bottle, its a great deal."
"D. This is one fine beer. The nose alone is worth the price of admission. Very easy drinking, especially given an ABV of almost 9. Not sure which I like better - this or regular Sumpin' Sumpin'."
"Overall, I would say I'm glad I was proven wrong."
"A powerhouse brew. Nice copper, burnt orange color, perfect head, thin but consistent lacing. Very fresh smells of mint, peach, apple, and evergreen. The flavor is big: the peach and mint are there with great spiciness - white pepper (I thought this before reading the guy below - so you know it's in there) with an herbal, citrus kick. I feel like I should marinate a chicken in this stuff and grill it. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy but silky smooth, too. I don't get the ""Belgian"" designation. This tastes like an Imperial IPA all the way, with the slight addition of fruit flavors which are up front but soon obscured by the spicy kick. This beer is a serious contender in the strong, ass-kicking category. Damn good stuff. Really enjoyable if you prefer a beer that runs on 220 volts. This stuff is double the beer and then some of standard Lagunitas bottlings."
"This one has a fairly high but not exceptionally high ABV, the only detractor from extraordiny drinkability. We'll settle for fantastic."
"Love that they put these in 6 packs, and now the alcohol is 9.4%, still not noticeable. Great deal for $9/6."
"D- The finish is great and I enjoy each sip"
"Drinkability is decent, it doesn't drink like 8.85% at all, and dries well. However, a slight lingeirng astringency and bitterness, as well as that lingering yeasty almost funk flavor are there."
"fairly strongly carbonated at first, the larger bubbles soon become tiny ones. orangish color and a decent sized head. pretty decent lacing. piny hoppy smell that is typical of west coast ipas. slightly hoppy with hints of belgian spice and a slight alcohol burn to it. very dry with a strong aftertaste. definitely bitter. it's like someone spiked an ipa with some belgian spices by accident. the flavor is rather strange. mouthfeel is light with a weird aftertaste. i find this beer to be very weird. I'm not a fan of what is going on here."
"Large, frothy head, over two fingers of just off-white, its delicacy shows as it dimples heavily across the surface, the lacing streaks are thin but will stay there until the glass is washed. Transparent, faint metallic glow to the yellowish-orange color, pumpkin-esque, maybe a subtle brown patina. Typical Lagunitas nose of super-sweet tangelo, pink grapefruit, lime citrus supported capably by pine sap, rose petals, basil leaves and nectarine, pineapple, papaya, peach and litchi fruit, block of milk chocolate, the herbaceousness has more of a savory then green nature. Medium-bodied, the carbonation gives if a fluffy, downy soft mouth entry as well as relieves what might be more fat than the beer can nimbly handle. Mint, basil, sage intertwine here with the orange, grapefruit citrus to temper the latter's sweetness. Not that this is a ""dry"" brew texturally, the hops have bounce but no real bite, lets the cocoa and mocha malts, brown sugar glaze and pine oil the joints. The apricot, papaya, peach, pineapple, green apple fruit can let you both enjoy a soaking effect as well as keep it jogging briskly. Bit of biscuit to scone but nowhere near yeasty. Just makes you think of sunshine."
"D: A nice rendition of a great beer. I really liked the cross between the super hoppy beers of California and the traditional taste of Belgian ales, though the Belgian flavors are rather faint. Very sessionable, which is surprising for its ABV."
"Great beer, will seek out again."
"A got a whole lot more than I bargained for with this one. The flavors are a bit stronger than anticipated making it a bit of a sipper. I am enjoying this beer quite a bit and could see having a couple on draft. For at home consumption a bomber is a about right to enjoy in an evening."
"Overall a good hop and malt mix with a bit sweet mix of the citrus & fruit. Carbonation beginning to end is fine. Nice alcohol warmth. A very good drink if you feel a need for hops with a bit more fruity sweetness."
"It really depends on how you see this beer: for a DIPA, it's too easy drinking; for a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, it's not that drinkable. Either way, it's a nice drinking beer, but doesn't achieve anything exceptional drinkability-wise."
"Overall- This has a decent flavor, but as far as being a Belgian Style ""Anything"" it certainly is not. The ABV's are hid nicely so at least I can get this down quick, and on to the next one!"
"Lagunitas is hit or miss for me, but they did a great job with this one."
"Good beer, tastes a little hoppier than most Belgian Strong Pale Ales, maybe on account of it being an American beer. Its still really good though. A bit potent for lots of drinking, but good enough that you might want more. Worthwhile and I'd have it again."
"Poured into improper glassware in my hotel in Rohnert Park. Plastic water glass all the way. Nice finger of spongey soapy head. Retains nicely, and amazing lacing given the plastic. Nice amber, dark golden hue. No cloudiness, with lots of nice little bubbles. Nice citrus hops smell, good malt sweetness on the nose. And then there's that Belgian yeast. Spicy, kinda clovey. Nice citrus and bitterness upfront, followed by sweetness. Very malty. The Belgo spice kicks in, and then a nice bitter finish. The wheat makes it very drinkable for 8.5. Fun beer."
"Overall, a rather interesting take on a hopped up BSPA. I liked it and if one element or the other was strengthened it might have been great. Still highly recommend as it's a unique take on the style. Avail here in TX. Rotation - Sept seasonal. I liked it but if I want a hoppy beer there are better out and if I wanted a true BSPA there are better ones out there. It's a good blend for a bottle maybe two a season but that's it for me. [R;O;seasonall]"
"D: very easy with not haveing super complex flavors and aromas, it hides its abv, and on a side note it is priced very well at under $5 for a bomber."
"I'm not big on wheat beers nor Tripels, but find myself enjoying this a fair bit. While I prefer the regular Sumpin Sumpin, I could see someone who is really into Tripels or Belgian IPAs really diggin' this one! Quality stuff."
"overall: a great beer I really enjoyed this worth every penny I paid for it."
"Judged as a purely hop-driven beer (which this is, despite the yeast), the nose on this beer is fantastic; so vibrantly fresh and hoppy with it smooth, über-fruit character and just enough balancing herbal character to keep things interesting. The yeast character is a bit more noticeable in the flavor, but it is still a weak supporting cast member when compared to the hops, but at least it does a good job with the role it does play; it is not overly phenolic, nor does it contribute flavors that clash with the hop notes, instead it integrates quite nicely with the dominant hop character. Some part of me wishes that this had more characteristics of the Westmalle yeast strain present, but in my hop-heart I know that I would not have liked the beer nearly as much even though this would have ended up a more complex. So yes, this is simplistically hop focused, but there is just enough malt and yeast character to support the hops and to really let them shine here. I can't help but really enjoy this beer; and I think I might have found a beer from this brewery to rival fresh Hop Stoopid."
"Smooth, medium feel in the mouth; noticeable carbonation. Very drinkable."
"not a bad beer at all, I like my BSPAs a little more fruity and this is very hoppy and bitter, but still a damn fine drink. probably could have used my duvel tulip on this one, but still delicious."
"Pours slightly hazy golden with a small creamy white head. Aroma is very fresh citric hops, a touch piney with a noticeable belgian yeast sweetness. Flavor starts sweet and slightly... the yeast definitely playing a role in the balance with the strong american hops. Finishes bitter, a bit grainy and some definite booze followed by a piney bitterness lingering. Medium body and a sharp carbonation. Nice beer Lagunitas..."
"Great beer. As advertised the wonderful Sumpin base with a WestMalle sumpin wild."
"Picked up a growler from DeCicco's."
"Another brew I wish I had enjoyed during the summer, but I'm happy to have gotten to try it at all!"
"Another winner from Lagunitas."
"Flavor is bracingly citric, adding significant bitterness to this style. Very moderate, almost intangible funk from the tap. Juicy, with a smooth, good-sized body. Finishes with a little peppery yeast and a lingering bitterness. So American, with a definite nod towards Belgium."
"Poured into a Great Divide glass a burnt yellow with a two finger white head. Great lacing. The scent is strong of piney notes. That piney smell translates directly into the front of the taste. Very big on the hoppy pine and green grass flavors that mellow out to a sugary finish. The Westmalle yeast provides a nice dry mouthfeel that adds to the experience."
"Slight metallic tinge up front, followed by sweetish wheat and sugar malts. Tropical fruits fill in and take over, but with a powdered sugar edge. Grassy, funky, slightly bitter, slightly spicy, partially funky character develops and builds toward the finish, providing a nice contrast to the fruity sweetness. Slightly warming. Finish is dry with lingering hoppiness. Medium-full body with a creamy, smooth feel. Very nice! Not extremely ""wild," but the Westmalle yeast adds some nice rustic depth to a solidly good base. And $4.99 a bomber?! More please!"
"One of the better belgian ipa's I have had. Not sure how this is a belgian strong pale ale."
"Drink: more IPA than Belgian, A Little Sumpin Wild is light and fluffy yet goes down easy with a lot of flavor."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. The nose is the only thing that could use a little improvement. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Note-my palate and nose are clean and in good order. I wonder why I'm not getting a lot of the westmalle esthery notes described in other reviews... Don't know, hmmm. Bit this was a darn good beer fo sho."
"Finally, I can put a face to the name. It pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises honeydew, grapefruit, pine, and sweet caramel. The taste is very similar, though the melon is decidedly meeker here, and the caramel seems a bit more assertive, even if it's still definitely subservient to the hoppier aspects. The body is light-ish, with a light carbonation and a rather liquid feel. Overall, a solid brew, one I hope to have later on down the road."
"It's a good beer, but it's tart to the point of almost feeling chalky. It's hard to express this because I really enjoyed the mouthfeel, but on the other hand it took away from the drinkability."
"Ultimately, its always been good to see Lagunitas expand their horizons, but this brew is more of an IPA and definitely is wild."
"This beer has a nice golden orange color with a finger of ecru foam. Some hop notes of piny and lemony aromas are, but there is a sweet malt undercurrent that is quite nice as well. During the first sips the hop flavors are the first to attack the tongue with a little bitterness. A slight liquor taste soon follows. The aftertaste mostly comprises of the caramel malts and lemon zest. The hop flavors are prominent, but they are smooth and mellow without bittering too much. The alcohol also is rather smooth on the tongue. This beer is a sipper, but it's pretty good."
"D: Well, it's pretty good for a fairly strong beer. Not something I'd chug, but I will take down this bomber comfortably."
"for the price and the taste, I would definitely get this again. such a unique tasting beer. like a pale ale/hefe put together."
"Overall, a nice, hoppy offering from Lagunitas. Really tasty, original and affordable. Seek this out."
"D: this is another great brew from Lagunita's. The 8.5% abv is very well hidden and the fresh juicy hops pair well with the Westmalle yeast."
"Lagunitas A Little Sumpin' Wild is a clear, dense golden ale with a small, elastic white head. It has a fresh aroma that's very fruity, like tropical fruit. It's floral and grassy. It smells great. It's pretty full bodied and very smooth with a clean, dry finish. It's very hoppy and bitter from start to finish. It's a green bitterness, like pine and juniper. There's a funky grumble just before the finish, where the yeast flavors blend with the hop flavors. This is where the alcohol presents itself, to continue on to a peppercorn finish. Wow, the yeast isn't distracting and it all works!"
"I happily gulped this beer down two nights in a row and imagine I will do it again."
"Good mouthfeel with a decent drinkability for the style. It seems like a kind of light IPA."
"I like this much more than the regular Little Sumpin', though admittedly I haven't had that in some time. Still, this is a much more unique(albeit stronger) take on the same beer."
"D - I would have this again a really nice brew this is really nice and worth having at least once !!"
"A really nice hopped up belgian that drinks well. Worth trying for sure, especially at Lagunitas price point."
"Medium body, good carbonation alcohol is well hidden. Very nice."
"D - Another good one from Lagunitas, don't think I'd want to drink more than one in one sitting. Very complex and interesting flavors, I enjoyed it."
"Verdict: The Belgian yeast and hop additions certainly transformed this into something new, though I'm not convinced it's an improvement. However, if you're a big fan of A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and Belgian IPAs, this is a sure-fire winner."
"D- no alcohol taste. each sip makes you want more."
"Affordable and well worth a try. I was expecting something different but I am completely satisfied with what came from this bottle. Yet another Lagunitas beer that makes me smile."
"Check it!"
"Drinkability: While it doesn't seem to fit it's designated style well, it is a tasty beer that is easy to drink even with the high ABV. I can see this as an approach to a BSPA but with a lot of hops."
"22oz bottle $4.49 (good deal as always). Clear yellow color, decent lace, good head. It smells super hoppy like citrus and lemons and oranges. The taste is much the same, dominated by hoppiness and I could not detect the Belgian Westmalle yeast influence in the slightest. This really was just like a lil' sumpin' sumpin' to me which was ok because it was still delicious. I have to get a couple more bottles while they are fresh."
"Beer could have used a little more carbonation. Perfect bitterness. Matching sweetness. I absolutely loved this beer. I really dont think it is to style AT ALL, but this is a great Belgian IPA! This drank like a bitter. My new favorite ""Belgian"" beer."
"drinkability: fantastic brew. I'd drink more"
"D: LSWA is an interesting departure from the baseline staple. I like this brew as I like LSEA, the other permutation, but the original's explosion of flavor and overall juiciness is without peer in the style. This Belgian IPA is awfully good, but, honestly, I still like Flying Dog Raging Bitch a little better."
"Mild carbonation. This beer is exceptional and if you have the chance, pick 2 up, cause the first will not be enough."
"Taste is fantastic, it's a bit spicy - think nutmeg or similar. It's pretty rich and sweet, very creamy and damn drinkable."
"Poured into pint glasses, has a nice golden/golden brown appearance with a short (and quickly disappearing) head. The smell is great, sweet and slightly grassy. The mouthfeel is good, ample bubbles while retaining a nice wetness. The taste is similar to sumpin' sumpin' but with a slight grassy/earthy note. It is very pleasant, with enough character to savour while maintaining drinkability."
"D- wow, it sure is strong going down. I am enjoying the brew, even though it's big time tropical and sweet to keep them going. That's not a bad thing. Just a little bit of sipper than a gulper. Great job Lagunitas"
"A Little Sumpin' Wild is an odd brew. As a Double IPA this is a clear hop heads delight. It's quite drinkable for its size. The 8.85% abv only starts to show a bit as the beer warms. Unfortunately the Belgian yeast strain is almost completely lost. The usual qualities of Belgian IPA or strong pale aren't there. As a Belgian style beer Sumpin' Wild is a letdown. In the end this winds up as just another tasty Double IPA, which isn't a bad thing at all."
"That being said, to rate this beer to style, I can't see calling this a BSPA. Belgian IPA would be a bit more appropriate, but still the American hops are too much. Thankfully, I could care less about style when I'm not reviewing so I can still enjoy this beer for all its greatness."
"I liked this. No sense of booze in the flavor at all. Enjoy."
"Fermented with Westmalle yeast according to the label, but there is nothing Belgian or Wild to this one. Just a standard DIPA, and pretty much standard Lagunitas as well. Hop heads rejoice, everyone else move on."
"Tried this beer at brewtopia in chelsea last week and knew it was something I had to have again. Picked up a bomber and it was just as I had remembered near excellence. Poured bright gold like carbonated motts apple juice. Head was prominent but faded fast leaving a lasting film on the beer and glass. Carbonation level is perfect - just enough. Smells like an imperial IPA with mild malt backbone. But taste is totally different. Hops hit you but not as some high IBU bears this one is in the 70s but so complex you cant complain. As the taste settles you get the caramel flavor which if you look at the beer it seems to pale to have. Piney hops not very citrusy which I loved. Aftertaste is sugar coated grass and a slight alcohol sting. This beer is one of my top 5."
"I like what Lagunitas is doing here. Sure, they used a Belgian yeast, and maybe the classification wound up being BSPA, but why not just make it their own twist on an IPA? They do have a beer called ""Hop Stoopid."" They've always been one of my top choices for bang-for-your-buck bombers, and at $5.49 I would recommend this to anyone who wants a Little Sumpin' more to go with their liquor store purchase."
"This is an interesting strong pale ale. The strong hops combination provides intense floral characteristics and gives a flavor of fresh tar with a little skunkiness. This pungent flavor lingers in the mouth for good amount of time. There is only a little bit of sweetness to this beer. This is definitely a beer you have to be in to mood for, as the flavors can seem a bit overwhelming."
"Overall this is a fine beer, its strength keeps it from being really drinkable, though."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Great yellow/golden color. Truly awesome lacing. Sticks around for the duration of the drink. 1 finger perfect white foam. Smell is the best part of the beer for me with a strong pine scent hitting first followed by pineapple and citrus. Its an intense aroma, developing more as the beer warms. Taste is strong pale ale at first but goes down very clean with little aftertaste, but an oiliness on the tongue and throat. Tons of carbonation. Very bubbly. Extremely drinkable, i put this whole bottle down myself and i would definitely recommend to friends."
"Very light and drinkable."
"Poured into a stemmed glass a slight chill hazed burnt orange with a big blooming white head that settled very slowly into a creamy mass.The first thing I notice is a big blast of citric hop,I detect some Amarillo I believe,then the phenols come rollin in with some clove-like spice.I really wanted to like the flavors more but I couldnt get myself to,started out great with a shot of citric and aspirin-like hops,but the phenols take over with slight funk and spice.Alot of people like Belgian yeast flavor...I dont.I like the hop profile and its a well made beer,just not a Belgian yeast fan."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company--Petaluma, CA--Little Sumpin Wild 7.70% ABV. 74.2 IBU's. Best of Fest to Me! Mild head. Clear thin bright gold color. Wild hoppy fruit ester front. Fully fermented rich barrel aged tasty tangy delicious spicy IPA body. Crisp clean end. (4.75 / 5.0) 5 oz. Taster @ Fremont Oktoberfest on 9/24 & 26/2010."
"A great beer overall, and an easy and enjoyable summer quaffer for sure."
"Pours a very nice bright orange crystal clear color with a just off white head that lasts for a long time. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The appearance is very similar to pte. The aroma is big time grapefruit, tangerine and some honey on the finish. Really like pte as well. Very strange on this, but it's a beautiful hoppy sweet nose. Perfect. The flavor is very nice, big hops and a malty finish. Great acidic hops and even some sweet bready malts that balance it out. Fruity esters also. Spot on carbonation and dry finish gives this great potential to pair with barbecue for sure. I really think this beer is a home run and definitely worth seeking out."
"D- High. I think this is an outstanding beer. Wow! I hope to see more beers brewed like this... American style + belgian yeast = awesome!"
"Blasted shaker pint; a tulip would do wonders for this one. Regardless, this is a tasty beer & I'll not hold the glassware against it. Definitely worth a try. I'm glad to have stumbled across it on tap."
"Flavor is very nice. Hop profile has a nice amount of citrus, some spice, and a touch of bitterness. The wheat provides hints of banana and clove lightly noticeable under the hop profile. Very crisp, quenching mouthfeel, which helps make it extremely drinkable. Flavors mask the alcohol almost completely."
"Something wild looks like a mix of IPA and SPA with a bright yellow color with some minimal orange highlights. Cant really see through the liquid, it's not that clear cut. A nice whisp of bright white foam on top with some stickies. Smell is IPA mixed in with bananas and yeast. I get a tropic sense and a bready sense, pineapple, mango, yeast. Taste is weird, the yeast really takes center stage and blows everything out da water. Either this is the end of the keg, or the Westmalle yeast is just that powerful. Tropic fruits alot of bananers and yeast, malt under all of that. Feel is medium and nicely carbed up. This kinda felt like juice going down, I would love to try this on cask. Drinkability was alright, I did not feel the need to have another. Im going to say this is good beer for now but I think a bottle will be in store for the future, so I can get more of an IPA taste from it, this serving type was yeasted up big time."
"Mouthfeel is a touch sticky, as the carbonation and dry finish can't help the medium body from leaving some oily coating behind. The citrus hops don't fade as the slightly chalky yeast slams on the brakes, and the finish is slightly bitter. This is a good beer and very pleasant in just about every aspect. What did we learn today, besides that I can type a review of a beer through a glass filled with said brew? I guess Ugly Betty really shines once you can get past the frumpy appearance."
"This beer has the excellent flavor of Little Sumpin Sumpin with a little more body and mouthfeel. The Belgian yeast seems to jive well with the hop character."
"Drinkability: only rated this a 3.5 just because it's such a wonderful beer, that you should savor this one!"
"Not really anything too wild about this beer, but it is a good drink."
"On tap at Hop Leaf into a pint glass...Pours amber with a gold base, ok retention, good lacing...The aroma is fruity to start, tangerine, banana, a little malt and belgian yeast. Expected a little sourness but not much there...The taste is like the aroma, fruity to start with yeast finish. This is not bad, just nothing special, aka a typical lagunitas beer."
"Pours a bright honey golden hue with a bright white head, speckled scattered lacing. Aroma has strong American hops with citrus/pine, and tropical fruit notes. Seems like they are following suit and making a hoppy Belgian style west coast IPA. Westmalle yeast strain, brings out banana/pineapple spicy esters. Flavor is competing with the Belgian yeast strain and American brash hop bitterness, sometimes this works sometimes it's a rough combo. Really great tasting version here spicy Belgian yeast with tropical fruit edges/banana/spice and upfront hops with citrus/grapefruit tones. Mouthfeel is medium bodied a tad oily with hops and smooth bodied carbonation. Drinkabilty is nice but after 22 ounces I'm good even splitting with a friend is a good idea but the flavors here worked well together."
"D: This is a very enjoyable beer, offers good malts, great citrus hops and a legendary yeast strain. Well put together and definitely worth a shot. Very unique take on the style."
"D - Made it through my bomber pretty fast. This stuff is tasty and drinkable at 8.85% ABV. This could possibly be the best deal out there for a bomber at just $5."
"Greta drinkability. Sorry if you don't feel the same way."
"Overall, a lot like a beligan ipa. Fairly drinkable. Some nice flavors all around."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light. The carbonation was gentle. Very easy to drink and well done. I wish I had several more bottles of this beer. Not really a sessionable beer but think I could drink alot of them."
"please send bottles up to Seattle!"
"D-This is really drinkable. I'm almost finished the 22oz and I'm ready for another one!"
"Great drinkability at 8.85% ABV. I wish and pray this could be a year round or seasonal at some point. One of my new favorite brews, Thank you Lagunitas, A+."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Split the 22 oz bomber but could have easily enjoyed the entire bottle myself then opened another one."
"D: It really is an easy drinker. Their website lists it at 7.5. It is almost in tripel territory but I really enjoyed this. I have it at one of the BA fests and thought it was great."
"D - Very, very nice. This seems to be, more than anything, a Belgian IPA, but it has a really strong malt and yeast character that one rarely sees in American brewed interpretations of the style. The fruity hops work perfectly with the Belgian yeast and in the finish it is hard to tell which flavors are coming from hops and which are the yeast. All of this complexity is supported by a lightly sweet and perfectly smooth base of malty goodness that makes the beer eminently drinkable. This is an excellent beer, I would love to see it as a regular seasonal."
"Very impressive effort by Lagunitas. I'm always a little wary of beers that combine American hops and Belgian yeast, but this one works. Lagunitas is becoming one of my favorite breweries. Their beers are always solid and the prices can't be beat. Highly recommended."
"The flavor opens up as the most aggressive ""Sumpin'"" to date, as rugged, leafy hop cones lay down a smacking bitterness quickly followed by tropical fruit-flavored booze. The smooth wheat malt and Belgian yeast notes are a bit overpowered, here, but I like the result nonetheless. Mouthfeel nears heavily-bodied, with a sticky, syrupy finish that lingers with hop oils and more alcohol. Sumpin' Wild is just that: Wild. It takes the palate for a complex roller-coaster ride and keeps me coming back for more. Recommended."
"Drinkability is off the charts. If this were food, I would eat it for three meals a day. Get it while you can."
"Drinkability: As always, a quality product at a reasonable (in general and by PA standards) price from Lagunitas. I really enjoyed this brew and I like that the Westmalle yeast added to this beer. Definitely might have to get some more bottles of this...if it doesn't sell out before I do!"
"Delicious. I could drink this stuff all day. This beer pours yellow-orange-gold (a color I just made up) with a big puffy white head. It's entirely transparent; filtered, I guess - not really sure why that's necessary. The aroma is big and hoppy. Lots of wildflowers, tangerines, candied lemon peel. Underneath the hop aromas, the Westmalle yeast chimes in with earth, bright stone fruits and some very mild spice. The malt lends a honeyed bread note. It's quite a nice aroma, though much more hop-dominant than any Belgian beer I've tried. The flavor is fairly sweet with an excellently bitter finish. The hop-malt balance is quite nice. Mouthfeel is appropriate. ""Wild"" or not (and it's definitely not, in the sense that most expected) this is an excellent beer. I'm actually enjoying this bottle more than the draft version I tried over the summer."
"D- for this particular style(which usually isnt very drinkable), this one was quite nice and enjoyable."
"High expectations for this guy. After trying Flying Dog's Raging Bitch a while ago, I've learned that Belgian yeastiness works well with IPA flavors: this beer does not disappoint. It's a bright, rich auburn with some pleasing head that settles into a sparse film. It smells absolutely delicious, floral and grapey and pretty sharp, but pleasantly so. Tasting it isn't a letdown; very cold, it was extremely reminiscent of some Riesling wines I've had, a very sweet grape flavor. Warming and opening up some, it is still a bit grapey but with some great yeasty, bittersweet palate play and a hoppy finish. This makes me very curious about the other iterations of Little Sumpin and is a great addition, albeit a temporary one, to the illustrious Lagunitas collection."
"Lagunitas really needs to consider making something like this at least a seasonal offering, if not year round."
"A really nice beer, love the aroma."
"If I'm reading the stealth bottling code right, this was bottled Aug 30."
"D- Man I love this stuff. Lagunitas is always a good bargain. I need more of this stuff while its around."
"Cabonation is medium and the finish is nice and crisp. Decent drinkability."
"D: This wasn't nearly as wild as expected (I thought it was brewed with brett instead of Westmalle's yeast), but it was still vibrant and delicious. Body was a bit weak, but the alcohol was hidden well, so it was easy to drink. I love all of the Sumpin's, but they are hardly distinguishable from the other. I was expecting more from this one."
"D: overall a nice take on this trend (belgian yeast + american hops)."
"D: I wasn't exactly sure what the ""wild"" character of this beer was upon drinking it, though some research has shown this beer did spend some time with Brett. At this point, it's like most of the other good Lagunitas beers: hoppy."
"Served from tap into a weizen glass. Poured a nice golden yellow with a one finger white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of malt, hops, citrus, and spices. The flavor was of malt, sweet hops, with a bitter hop followthrough attacking your taste buds upon swallowing. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. This was a very nice brew to enjoy. It just needed a little more on the flavor to be great. The aroma was quite excellent however. This is worth trying at least once if you can get your hands on it."
"I also wish they hadn't given it a misleading name that contains ""wild," which it most certainly is not (note: I am just mentioning this, not factoring it into the score)."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this one. Not sure how this is anything but a Belgian IPA, but OK. Anyway, big burst of hops and interesting Belgian yeast byproducts make for a flavorful beer. Needs a little tweaking, but damn good-- gimme another."
"Drinkability - I was surprised to see this beer comes in at 8.5%. Tasted more like a 5-6% beer. Greater than expected drinkability."
"D - Great beer, easy drinker and very enjoyable. Lagunitas has yet to disappoint me!"
"D: A fantastic beer from Lagunitas, I just hope that it shows up in bottles soon so I can have it again."
"Super easy to drink. The hop load clearly pushes this beer in to the realm of the Belgian IPA. Tasty and well mannered I could see making this a permanent resident in my house."
"D: moderate. a bit too bitter, especially residually in the mouth."
"The mouthfeel is a little below medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkabiltiy is very good, it's an excellent beer and another winner in Lagunitas lineup. I loved Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and this one might even be better. The Belgian yeast complimented the tropical hoppiness very nicely and didn't become overpowering at all. Very nice beer overall."
"* Home-brew Side-note: I made a wheat ale this past summer that I wanted to be a bigger version of Gumballhead, but not quite as big as Sumpin' Sumpin'. I got tangy results and a very unique beer. If I come back to this recipe, I may think long and hard about using westmalle yeast instead of the American Ale yeast stain I used. The fruity notes of that strain would have gone a long way to making the beer as complex as I had hoped it would be."
"Deep orange amber in color. Very clear, lightly carbonated. Not much of a head, but leaves good lacing. Lots of grapefruity-hops in the nose - smells like a DIPA for sure. Also hints of tropical fruit, like mango. Flavor is unique and delicious, however. It's a DIPA to be sure, but with a cherry-like twang upfront. Middle and finish is full DIPA, and not super-unique, but the intro is great. I get all sorts of weird stuff, like lettuce and celery, along with the cherry notes in the background. To be sure, hops is the champ here, like Chad Ochocinco to the malt's Jordan Shipley...The malt characteristics are good, and could even be great, but aren't developed enough yet to get there. Great beer, but expensive at $7.69/bomber."
"pours a mostly clear golden color with a nice head and good lacing..smell is hops and pine, citrus and malts yeast in the background..taste is big citrus hops with pine reminiscent of sumpin sumpin..just add in the yeast..its a hop explosion and a delicious one,,i was lookin for a wild ale a little sour but was wrong..this is wild yeast not sour but it is outstanding for a hop lover ..it a very good beer if you like the wheat you will like the wild..i like both alot"
"After about half a pint you can taste the twinge of brett. Very nice."
"The beer pours a golden amber color with very good head retention and considerable sticky lacing. The beer is every bit as impressive on the nose, and showcases that telltale perfumy, hoppy nose I've come to expect from Lagunitas. This beer just reeks of grapefruit, spice, and light sour funk. The latter is no more than an afterthought, and just adds another layer of flavor both on the nose and palate. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and reminds me very much of a little sumpin extra, but with the added sour funk. It really enhances both the aroma profile and the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a long, bitter finish. Also, this a West Coast all the way still of wild IPA, so there is very little sweeetness in this beer, and the finish is dry and hoppy/bitter. Drinkability is the only area where this beer drops off a bit. The beer is close to 9% abv., and you can kind of tell. It's not alcoholic or hot, but still, the high abv. wears you out a bit at the end. Regardless, this is another excellent beer from the talented folks at Lagunitas. I'm starting to expect it whenever I see something new from these guys."
"i know a lot of people have said this already, but the fact that something wild isn't wild at all bummed me out. basically, what we have going on here is the typical Lagunitas hop profile coupled with a touch of sweet malt, a hint of wheaty zing, and the estery characteristics (i'm getting a lot of unripe banana, a touch of clove, and some other spices as well) contributed by the belgian yeast. it's been done before (a lot), and it's been done much, much better. i wish they had just left it at little sumpin' sumpin'... the follow up beers have been real let-downs to me. all in all, a well made beer that should please Lagunitas fans, but not something i plan on visiting again. sorry lagunitas."
"D - The combo of ridiculously delicious hoppiness and the very high ease of imbibement due to sheer delectabilty makes this brew a dangerously desirable quaff."
"Let it warm up a little for about 25 minutes out of the fridge, then poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass. Nice 1 to 2 finger fluffy white head on sits atop a mostly clear amber orange body. Nice lacing and decent head of ~ 1 cm remains throughout the consumption of this beer. Smells heavily of citrusy hops, reminding me of Diasy Cutter and Dreadnaught in that regard. Slight yeast and fresh-cut grass like taste followed abruptly by a heavy hop presence that I knew would be there according to the smell. On the thicker side of hoppy beers that aren't considered DIPAs but it goes down very smoothly. I can tell that the alcohol by volume is higher than most IPAs but not in a bad way. Finishing the bomber by myself is no problem, and will hopefully be buying at least 1 or 2 more of these before my local store runs out."
"Bottle. Pours a golden color with a fluffy white head. The aroma is hoppy and really just smells like an IPA. Hop notes are complimented with subtle belgian yeast aromas like banana and clove. Hoppy start that then transitions to sweet with a nice belgian yeast flavor that balances well with the hops. Wild? No, not in the sense of is is funky/sour/etc. This is more like a Belgian IPA to me and in that matter I really like it. Medium mouthfeel. My only knock is that it is pretty sweet and malty but other that I think it is a solid beer."
"IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA IPA"
"d - A pretty nice pale ale. Smell was very nice with a lot of grapefruit/citrus, and the taste had some huge bitterness to it. Would try again."
"Very drinkable for two or three pints, but I am not sure that I could drink more than a few of these before the sweetness would start to overwhelm the palate."
"Drinkability- really super easily drinkable, just has such a nice balance that you are really left craving more, nice balance of being hoppy with long finish and just enough malt to keep it enjoyable, definitely one to try especially if you like citrus style of hopped beers, the alcohol is very extremely hidden and couldnt go thru a 22 ozer very quickly, very nice beer thumbs up LAGUNITAS"
"This beer poured out a golden color with orange hues, a solid head with nice lacing. The nose was filled with floral grapefruit citrus, yeast characteristics, a little bubblegum. The taste was very nice, floral citrus, grapefruit, bubblegum, a slight tint of clove and spice and a clean pine that blends fantastically with the bubblegum flavors. The carbonation levels are very nice and a very clean bitter resin coats the palate. I rank this a very drinkable beer based on the fact I will be buying more bottles because it tasted so damned good."
"Kudos to Lagunitas to trying something new. So much better than any of the other wild IPA's I have tried. They didn't just spike this IPA with Brett like so many others do. Great stuff and a truly inovative beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy, quite drinkable, tasty beer."
"CHEERS!!"
"Drinkability -- I'm not a huge fan of A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, but this was quite a pleasure to drink. The bubblegum-like notes conjured out of the Westmalle yeast really worked well with the wheat and the bright citrusy hops. I'll absolutely buy more before it's gone."
"More tasty beer from Lagunitas. I really enjoyed the regular Sumpin Sumpin ale and this was a nice expansion on the original."
"Pours a bright golden yellow with a bit of haze and a nice white head. With the initial whiff, it's pretty clear that this is a special beer and maybe already the best I've encountered from Lagunitas. Off the nose alone, one of the better Belgian IPA's that I have ever encountered. Nice mustiness along with some earthy, floral, and spicy hops. Taste is quite similar, with the yeast and hops performing a delicate dance. Neither comes out on top. Great balance between the yeast and hops. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with a dry finish. Drinkability is superb. A fairly complex beer with enough going on that each sip brings new elements. My favorite so far from the ""Sumpin'"" series."
"D: Pretty good overall drinkability. Not hot at all for the ABV, but the bitterness built over time."
"D= Not bad at all. I dunno if I would go out of my way to seek this out though. It's really not that much different. Good but not that much different. My rating is based on a BPA"
"Bottle poured into pilsner glass. Pours gold with a white head and sticky lacing. Smell is grapefruit and piney hops, some banana and clove. Taste starts hoppy like normal lil sumpin, but merges with yeast esters. They go better then i thought they would. Some sweet malt character. Has a medium body and light carbonation. Just enough aftertaste that I want more. Drinkability is good despite having a lot of strong flavors competing."
"D - I think this one is gonna hurt in the morning. Loving the flavor, typical Lagunitas with a twist. Along the same lines as Raging Bitch with a bit more kick...could just be the freshness of this one (just hit the shelves in MA yesterday...no date that I find on the bottle, but this has to be pretty fresh). At $5.99/bomber this is a pretty good bargain. Glad I grabbed a few, hoping I find a few more out there this weekend."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good, for me. I like this brew and will probably have more."
"I saw this beer on the shelf and noticed the ""Wild"" part right away. I was then slightly disappointed when I saw this was brewed with a Belgian yeast strain instead of brett. Oh well, but it anyway to see what was up. Pours a solid golden color, almost yellow with a large white head that had lasting cap and left very good lacing. Yep, normal aroma from the ""Sumpin"" series, lots of piney, peppery, resinous hops, but not much else. Where the Belgian yeasty phenols? Taste is actually really good. I like this much better than the regular Sumpin Sumpin, but I'm not convinced it's from the yeast. Grainy, cracjer like malt is overshadowed by the big standard Lagunitas hop bill (I mean seriously, do they only use certain hops for their beers??) and only a touch of clove like, Belgian yeast. Medium body, good carbonation. I like this beer, despite it's typical Lagunitas taste. Maybe the yeast adds some character, and I'm not sure how to describe it, but this is good."
"3/4/4.5/3.5/4"
"Overall, another great Lagunitas beer, but until it actually goes ""wild", ill stick with my Little Sumpin Sumpin."
"Drinkability: Doesn't go down nearly as easily as regular little sumpin' sumpin'. I have tried several of the variants and the original is always the best"
"drinkability is good - even with the minor let down in the funk flavor this brew still delivers in all over flavor"
"Overall a very nice beer, very drinkable. Not sure what some age will do with this but I will definately try!"
"D-straight forward beer, the complexity I was hoping for did not exist, mild yeast notes on a typically solid hoppy lagunitas beer that lacked the carbonation it should have had."
"Tasted on draft at Fountainhead. Pours golden with a thick but quickly receding white head. Nose of Belgian yeast, hops, citrus, and some malt. Flavors are malt, citrus, light anise and hops bitterness. Body is medium, carbonation is medium, and the finish is rather short. This is very sessionable, but not terribly exciting."
"D: Not my favorite from Lagunitas, but a very good Summer beer."
"I enjoyed several samples of this at the recent ACBF in Boston, this review is from a follow up visit enjoyed at the Birdsall House in Peekskill, NY. Poured pretty typical looking medium almond amber, near clear. Light tan head, that stays at about 1/2 inch, develops a nice looking maraingue and leaves ample sheeting and strands of lace. Floral, grassy, and Belgian yeast/spice nose, yum, my kind of beer. Boldly hopped, notes of light clove, Belgian infused yeasty/spiciness, more then moderate hops presence continuing to exert itself and adding to the sizzle. Quite worthy example of a style that I love. Fine folks at Lagunitas, please make lots more of this one and send it to the NYC area."
"HV"
"D- Really good beer overall; the wild element really give is some more complexity over what would just be a hop-dominated beer."
"Despite its big beer badge of 8.5, this is a supremely drinkable and wonderfully inventive wheat beer from an underrated brewery."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden straw color with frothy white cap of head leaving nice lacing. Scent is of belgian yests, floral and tropical hops and a pale biscuty malt nose. Taste is a touch more aggressive than the taste, the belgian yeast and citrus and tropical hops work well together, the background has a slightly spicey and biscuity flavor. Lighter side of medium bodied, actively carbonated, dry. A nice beer that misses being top notch by just a hint of aggressivenes."
"Medium bodied with a nice dry hop bite up front with hints of earthy pine that are quickly balanced by swee tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as a pale malt backbone that has hits of graham cracker and biscuit. Hints of mango, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon peel and orange along with some subtle spice and a sweet yet bitter dry finish. I'm also picking up some crisp light fruit, mostly apple and pear, and slight alcohol sweetness but overall the ABV is excellently masked. A very unique hybrid of a west coast IPA and a belgian strog ale. Complex, uber fresh, delicious and dangerously drinkable. I have to stop myself from pounding the whole glass down too quickly. Highly recommended!"
"D - A nice drink all around, and well worth a try. this is one of those specialties and I don't see it becoming a part of the regular line-up...it works well as a limited. Fun."
"D: Among the best IMHO"
"Pours an orange-amber color with a sizeable creamy white bead. Aroma of grapefruit and a touch of pine, with some sweet caramel malt. Palate is very hoppy upfront, grapefruit, pine, anda whiff of astringency. Malt comes through mid-palate, but is still subservient to the big dose of hops. Body is full and just a touch sticky. An interesting deviation in the Little Sumpin series, but still a hop bomb on the whole."
"It had good carbonation and was pretty interesting."
