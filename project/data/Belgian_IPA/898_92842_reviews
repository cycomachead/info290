"A Belgium white ipa. If that sounds good to you, you may enjoy. I didn't care for the taste, but Belgium whites and ipa's are not my favorite styles."
"Good strong spiced fruit aroma follows into the front and turns into a good hoppy bitterness and a nice boozy kick at the end."

"Pours hazy gold yellow with a small white head. Aroma and Taste is citrus floral hops, lemon peel, mild yeast and pale malt, mild bitterness. Palate is a medium crisp body, good carbonation. Finishes with citrus lemon, biscuit malt, fruity with mild bitterness on the end. Overall a good refreshing session Belgian style IPA."

"O:  Nice enough, and on the better end for a White IPA, but I'm not sure if I would call this one (but White IPAs are really confusing).  An under-rated beer from an under-rated brewery."

"7/28 - Pours cloudy gold with remaining ring of white foam. Wheaty nose, some orange. Like a hoppy witbier. Opens citrus, chalky, then builds to a hoppy middle. Fast finish, orange rind close. Kind of an off construction, doesn't quite come together. 3.5 3.75 3 3.25 3"

"O: White IPAs have been a little slower to catch on than I thought they'd be. This one is pretty much as I envisaged the style to be. Great balance. Not necessarily wheat-dominated. Higher abv, good Belgian yeast character, ample hop flavor and bitterness, and some supporting wit spicing. Still very drinkable. Good stuff here."

"O: Loose Cannon gets ass-reamed by a Westmalle Tripel that's high on coriander, and this is the result. I have to say, it's turned out well. There's just enough IPA to satisfy me, and the Belgian-ness isn't half-hearted in execution. I was pretty pleasantly surprised by this."

"Had on tap at Sticks and Stones a few days back.Came in a standard pint glass a hazed orange infused lighter golden with a somewhat creamy bone white head that really stuck to the sides of the glass like glue as it settled into a frothy mass.Light citrusy hops and yeasty spice in the nose,the yeast is bigger in the aromas than flavor wise.Tangerine notes really stand out on the palate along other citric flavors,it didn't seem as ""big"" as it is either with not a whole lot of alcohol sweetness,mild yeasty spiced notes in the finish.Not a bad BIPA it's not overly yeasty and a nice fresh fruity hop profile."

" The taste is good with slight hint of pear and slight peppery element with mild herbal flavor leading to hint of sugar and mild tinge of tropical fruit -more of a muted pineapple type presence with subtle malt and more alcohol as it finishes with good yeast flavor not as intense as the nose lets on. Overall I enjoyed this, however it is more of a hoppy triple than 'White IPA', the hops balance so Imperial Wit might not be appropriate, but it seems like just another beer trying to jump on the IPA bandwagon to sell rather than market it as a belgian wheat which might not be as popular."

"I believe this beer to be slightly underrated, it's really smooth, well balanced and drinkable. you get some of the citrusy topicalness along with a slight funky spice note like you'd get in a witbier. it's clean, refresing, perfect alcohol content, not quite chuggable but you don't need to sip it either"

"Poured a slightly cloudy orange/gold with a creamy white head. The head has decent, albeit thin head and some light lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of their Loose Cannon, but slightly milder due to the wheat in the grain bill. The taste is similar. This is like Loose Cannon light which is in no way a bad thing. A little thinner on the body but a nice smooth finish. An interesting take on the IPA."

"Fairly high abv (to American standards) is not evident in the mouthfeel or taste."

""

"O - Looks great, but disappointed after that. Probably doesn't help that I have recently had a few other White IPA's that knock this one into the dirt"
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, this is a solid flavorful beer to drink for a long time."
""
""
"Overall - Decent, pretty standard for the style. Not great, not bad, nothing new for the style. Easy to drink and not overboard with flavors. Worth a try but there are better examples of this style out there."
"O - A very interesting ale. I think this may be the first of the style that I have had and I will definitely seek out more in the future."
""
"O/D - Definitely tastes like a slightly hopped up wit. Age might be holding this back though. Hop character is a bit...generic, with no real flavour characteristics coming out. Decent though."
"Overall – A pretty solid brew but nothing all that exciting. Not something I'd go out of my way to pick up again, but it was still worth trying once."
""
"O: Decent IPA – nothing I would grab again."
""
""
"Overall, an okay summer offering. Not something I would seek out outside the summer months. Would be interesting trying closer to it's bottling date to see how the hops affect the taste, although in my experience, (and perhaps I don't care for that style) more hops have not necessarily meant a better beer."

"Had this at the DoG (Duke of Gloucester in Williamsburg, Va.) Street Pub on cask. It starts out the color of a Belgian Wit. Starts out like a witbier but them the hops kick in. Unlike any cask ale I've had to date. I tend to rate this beer a little high but anyone who makes cask ale in the states deserves all the support they can get. Kudos to Heavy Seas and their cask program."
""
""
""
"O: I found this beer to be rather interesting as it seems like a hybrid between a witbier and an India Pale Ale."
""
"Taste-Spicy yeast, citrus hop notes. A bit unbalanced to my taste. A valiant effort that almost works."
"Overall: This wasn't what I expected. Hoping for more bitterness balanced with the sweetness, but if I'm craving a Belgian Ale, this is a decent option."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 9/2013. Pours very cloudy golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, apple, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, orange peel, coriander, clove, light banana, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, citrus peel, coriander, clove, light banana, pepper, floral, grass, wheat, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop, spice, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt backbone and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice White IPA! All around nice balance and complexity of hop, spice, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one."

"Mouthfeel: This is a good medium bodied beer that is easy drinking compared to most Belgians but the flavor is something to be desired for me."
""
"Overall my search for a tasty IPA continues. IPA fans may like it but I just couldn't come to terms with the bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy lighter yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, mellow citrus hops. In the taste, lighter pine like hops, , mellow malt all the way through. A hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry and minty pine hop in the aftertaste. A nice mix of hops, quite nice and pleasant."
""
""
"Overall I am still more of a fan of the Loose Cannon. The Belgium yeast really does take the bitter edge off this great IPA. May be best since some really love it."

"This is a beer I will seek out and buy again. It is recommended for when you want a full flavored American version of one of these without the over the top syrupy taste."
"What a delectable beer. It's spirited. Rambunctious but not overly forceful or conceited. It's the happy collision of two fantastic worlds where the characteristics of an IPA meet a proper Belgian. Poised and unique this is my first white IPA and I love the style. It's graceful but fun loving."
""
""
""
"O/D-Belgian IPAs are really hit-or-miss with me. This was pretty close to a miss. Spicy and sweet with not many redeeming factors."
""
"Smells like a witbier, drinks like a cross between a witbier and an apa. Interesting, characterful brew that's fairly refreshing."
""
""
""
"D: overall, not a bad brew by any means, however I think it is missing the mark a little regarding being a BIPA. drinks more like a Belgian golden or a lighter ABV Belgian tripel. bring some more hop component Heavy Seas and you will have a solid offering."
"O- Pretty much just as good as Dubbel Cannon only a touch less zesty. It seems like, at least in my experience, that the only Heavy Seas beers that are any good are the ones where hops are involved. Otherwise, they range from terrible to okay. I would recommend this one though."
""
"Overall: A good BIPA. More tripel characters like others would be nice, but I was pretty happy with this one."
"Food Pairings: banana gelato, a juicy mid rare cheeseburger with that really thick american cheese on a potato bun with ketchup, mayo and butter lettuce. grilled chicken over an apricot salad. Beef Satay with a spicy peanut dipping sauce"

""
"Gotta be one of the best white IPA."
""
"O - This is not what I was expecting, this is a great blend of belgian white/wheat and a mild IPA. Dont come into this beer expecting wild bitterness, but a beer thats bursting with a truck load of flavor. I'm not a fan of this style, but this has changed my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best White IPA I've ever had (that belongs to DC Brau/Union Yonder Cities) but a damn good one that I'll be happy to sip on this summer."

"Fresh release into Ohio from Cavalier Distributing, pours a glowing orange golden hued slightly hazed as the yeast sediment disperses like cigar smoke in the room, light white head forms leaves fine intricate layered lacing. Aromatics heavy in the pinapple, mango, tropical fruit department with heavy spice arriving 2nd, big hops underneath the label of a White IPA. Smoking a La Aroma de Cuba Mi Reserva, a cigar influence by Cuba yet produced by the Holt's Cigar Company (Philadelphia, PA) the folks who brought us Ashton, and San Cristobal. This is produced in Nicaragua by Don Pepin Garcia at the My Father Cigar Factory wrapped with a beautiful Mexican San Andres wrapper, I'm in love with the pairing. And intrigued by the fact that this beer is brewed in Baltimore yet carries IPA and witbier characteristics that have been formed from a love of West Coast IPA and Belgian artisanal ales. What a hybrid of pairings, anyways on to the flavor of the uber fresh White IPA, heavy handed citrus and tropical fruit hops with bready yeast and spice laying down the law. It leaves a lingering bitterness catching those hops and house Belgian style yeast together but leaves an impeccable complexity of tropical fruit including mango and pineapples with tones of passionfruit. The spices come off very perfumey, like walking through a women's dressing room after a hoard of single females prepare to go out for a night on the town. It catches me with some balance but the extreme contrast of flavors that appreciate in a format that turns the volume up this loud is a bit distracting from what the base beer could actually provide to the drinker without all of the background noise. I know it's a trend to blend these two styles and this isn't a horrible version of it, it is just one that I'm not so keen on. The smell is beautiful even some green onion notes from the big hop barrage makes in through to my nares, it's just the clash of Belgian yeast and spice with the IPA that leave me wanting more cohesion and less clash. Know add in the cigar with earthy wood and sweet tobacco with black pepper spice and we have ourselves a magnificent pairing. Mouthfeel is very forgiving with a dry spice lingering bitterness and floral earthy pepper notes that linger kicking in but tasting rather good between sips, the mango fruitiness is complex because it limits the concentration of malt sweetness due to the fact that it's mainly derived from the hop varieties used in this beer. Overall I'm happier with my session with this beer than the flavor description details indicated, a very fine ale from Hugh Sisson and company of Baltimore keep bangin' out these beautiful complex ales and I will keep trying them."

"This is a solid Belgian IPA. I like this much more than Dubbel Cannon, which was their other BIPA which they recently retired. This isn't quite the Belgian equivelant to Loose Cannon, which I've been waiting to see from Heavy Seas. It's enjoyable, but leaves me wanting more."
"All aspects of this beer work, not exactly the easiest style to tackle but Heavy Seas prevails. Long live the White IPA!"
"Overall - A definite must try beer for anyone. This is a very well crafted Belgian IPA that is an easy drinker, full of typical Belgian flavorings and just enough pop in the finish for hop heads."
""
"Warm to close, the beer carries with it a soft covey, minty and somewhat vanilla taste that's overshaddowed by grain character that's very charming if you can get past the husky bite. It's a complex ale that has good intentions but are a bit rough around the edges."
""
""
"O: I honestly am not familiar with this style so really have no base with which to compare. It was an ok beer although its not something I would return to again and again. Still it was really interesting and fans of this style may enjoy."
"This is a decent BIPA. There is a nice herbal hop character here which makes this pretty enjoyable. Unfortunately, this beer is simple and borders on boring after a while. It's definitely a nice addition to the heavy seas line-up, but this isn't a beer I would visit often."
