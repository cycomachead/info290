Palate starts hinting of fruit then blossoms into melon flavors that dissolve into a big, drying bitterness with a touch of herbal astringency. A light graham cracker slightly sweetened with caramel lies under the fruit flavors. Medium body and slightly below medium carbonation.","pat61","Nov 10, 2014"

It's in the feel that this beer falls somewhat flat - literally. It's hard to peg but even though this beer is carbonated, it doesn't feel like it so even though the direction in which Hop Wrangler is headed is a fantastic one, it's not quite ready to ride off into the sunset just yet.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 04, 2013"

Flavor is drier than you would expect from a Belgian styled IPA. Has a metallic twang, and a sizable hop bitterness. Versus the style, it is what I would expect a Belgian IPA to be. The beer feel think, but the champagne-like carbonation really cuts the underlying viscosity. Definitely worth checking out, maybe the best beer from Iowa I have had to this point.","TastyTaste","0"

Well balanced and drinkable. Definitely doesn't feel like a 6.25% beer. Though it lacks some aspects I enjoy in my IPAs, it makes up for it with its execution in other areas. I recommend this beer to anyone who could try it! Thanks again, Matt!","TheGordianKnot","Jun 27, 2011"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: A more than solid Belgian IPA, which has some nice English IPA components in addition to the expected American hops.

4.25,17.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"The flavor amps up the spiciness, as the Belgian yeast adds cracked white pepper and to combine with zesty, minty, herbal hop notes. Drying malt suggests toffee and woody tannins. Mouthfeel is crisp and well-carbonated, with a medium consistency and lingering hop kick. All in all, an excellent interpretation of the style. Peace Tree didn't really impress me with their Rye Porter, but Hop Wrangler is superb! Give it a try.","wagenvolks","0"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Really a good beer, especially for a new brewery. Very good example of a Belgian IPA with distinct flavors from all three countries coming out well. Definitely would recommend this.","FreshHawk","Jul 25, 2010"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"So, Peace Tree Hop Wrangler 3 is a solid effort that doesn't come close to challenging the greats of the style. It is encouraging, though, that an Iowa brewery can brew a Belgian IPA that has many more positives than negatives.","BuckeyeNation","Jul 21, 2010"
4.06,11.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a rich, deep dark mahogany amber. Fairly clear body with a large, dense khaki colored head that fades to a film with some bubbles and large amounts of dry, sticky web like lacing. Aroma is odd...citric and caramel dominant with a musty and smoky (as in ash tray) like undertone. Body is medium thick, chewy and pleasantly sharply carbonated with a clean dry earthy finish. Flavor packs a massive caramel malty body with a potent bitter hoppy and mildly orange and grapefruit citric finish. Unexpectedly, I really enjoyed this beer. Still not a top tier IPA, but for my tastes, the balance of strong caramel malt and citric sweetness with aggressive bitter hoppiness was very enjoyable.","yourefragile","Jul 12, 2010"

3.68,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The flavor is much less unique from the tap. A little wishy washy in the flavor profile, with the citric notes overtaking the Belgian notes. Yeasts add a hint of pepper, with a bitter finish. Body remains a little low, while the carbonation doesn't kick quite as hard. My opinion: get a six-pack and avoid the draft.","BretSikkink","Jun 08, 2010"
3.8,4.7,4,4,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a light orange color with a white head. The aroma is orange hops with some bready malt notes. The flavor is orange hops with some pine and grass mixed in as well. Low to medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Jun 03, 2010"
3.73,2.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12oz. stubby bottle (no bottle date) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a nice brownish/copper color with some head retention and medium carbonation. Smells of some nice citrusy/grapefruit hops, sweet candi sugar with some phenol/estery aromas. Gives a good hop bite that surprised me. Lots of hop flavor with some malt sweetness that finishes with some alcohol warmth. Flows through the palate pretty good with lots of perceived hop bitterness. A little more caramel malts for balance and this would be a very good drinker.","ballz50401","May 28, 2010"
4.07,12.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D: Unlike a few IPA's I've had, I could definitely throw down a few. The refreshing feel makes you want to pick up the glass as soon as you swallow. I'm lucky to have this beer locally and at a nice price!","DarrinRasberry","May 16, 2010"

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It could use a little more carbonation, but is quite easy to drink and well done.","daledeee","Beers"
4.23,16.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Beer from my wife's hometown. I've been frequenting their brewery, and I'm pretty impressed with their efforts. I'm hoping that their full flavored beers catch on in the land of BMC.","katan","0"
