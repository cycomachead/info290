"Serving type: bottle"
"Only ever so slightly grassy on the finish and/but by and large crisp. Easy drinking, nothing special but OK."

"not as advertised. Try long trail farmhouse white IPA instead"
"Quickly becoming one of my favorites. One of my favorite styles.. Witbier.. Combined with IPA from the brewery that already brews my favorite IPA. (to date). I would like to stock up on this stuff while it's around, cuz it's an anytime drinker. Good, good stuff."

"Very subtle IPA clean and crisp great to pair with some good food"
""
"Meringue-like head recedes in clumps, with very nice residual lacing. Aroma is floral but faint. The beer tastes good, but this estimable flavor is also too mild. It's lemony; maybe a hint of fresh asparagus. The hops character is subdued, in keeping with the Belgian style. Refreshing, but not memorable."

"Overall great taste. Love when this beer is out"
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin foamy head.  Head retention is not that great.  Lacing is decent.  More of a grapefruit and lemon aroma with hints of coriander and orange peel.  More of a bready, malty taste at the beginning.  There is a good hoppy bite.  Hint of coriander and orange peel at the end.  Decent beer.  A little different but good."
""
" The taste is very good with a orange peel flavor that dominanates the initial taste and some coriander adding that tangy lemony brightness followed by a slight herbal and citrus type hop profile with malt sweetness balancing the taste into a lightly bitter and semi-dry finish. Overall this is a pretty decent IPA, the hybrid character of wit and IPA is achieved but i have had some that are pull it off with more hop focus"
""
"This is a solid IPA. A little cloudy, light on mouthfeel, but good flavor."

"Way underrated as far as I'm concerned...everyone who I give one to really likes it...it is very well balanced with not the strongest hop profile I will admit, but it is what it is and that is excellent..."
"Hop profile is pretty weak."
""
""
"Pretty good beer. Not too hoppy, our too white, a good balance."
""
"Excellent burger and tots beer!"

"Like a lighter bodied version of their ipa. Very pleasant."

"Better than I thought it would be, slight wheat notes."
"That's a quality beer, dudes. It's not as bitter as most IPA's, and it's got mad Flayva. I dig. Had on draught at Westside Hootie house in MA. Alyssa is a beast. I dig, also."
"Not much flavor. Off smell"

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Yeungling pint glass. The color is a hazy dark-yellow color . Had a bubbly quickly dissipating head. The aroma is very sweet, sweeter then it tastes. As you drink this beer, the inside of the glass is coated in foam. I love the taste and feel of this beer, it is thick, but not too thick a very mild thickness. The taste is initially sweet with a bitter orangey finish. You gotta try it."
"The feel is light and has a great smooth body that helps it go down easy. There is a silky texture that is like a pillow and us soft and inviting."
""
"Pours clear golden with a small white head,smells citrusy and caramely, tastes citrusy and hoppy on the front end with a smooth caramel malt note finish, feels smooth and creamy."

"Old IPAs are like a box of chocolates - you never know what you are going to get. That said, when a beer incorporates spices and coriander, I would imagine that it will hold up nicely. I got a massive finger of dense, bone-white head from my pour that slowly fell, leaving great lacing in its wake. Nose was grassy, lemon-citrusy and with a tinge of pepper. Nothing wrong there and my mouth was beginning to water as a result. Nose was a slightly-hazy sunshine yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). It looked like sunshine in a glass, which would have been more appropriate on a cold, overcast day, but I pressed on. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, almost creamy and the peppery flavor of the coriander was immediate on the tongue. It slowly gave 'way to a lemony taste that reminded me, in total, of a lemon muffin. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing, actually. This could be a summer beer, for that mattter."

"Pours a golden orange color with an unfiltered appearance with sediment. One familiar with beer could indicate this is a wheat beer, others might say cloudy. The aroma is big on hoppy and wheat citrus, kind of smells like cleaning product with the yeast and wheat notes meshing with a firm hoppyness. The flavor is quite good, with more citrus notes, lemongrass, and pine. Moderate bitterness but sticks to the roof of your mouth as the citrus hits the taste buds. The body is light with a prickly medium to high carbonation. Overall this is a pretty drinkable hoppy ipa, like an American hop spiked Hoegaarden."

"O: Normally, I never think much of Harpoon, but every so often they surprise me. This is one of those pleasant surprises - it's almost great, in fact. It's rather simple, so I can't break out any 4's. Still, I'd definitely drink this one again."

"This one goes into my glass with a 2 finger white head, semi hazed golden apricot body with fine speckled lacing as the head fades. Aromatics bring out spicy yeast notes, citrus peel, herbal/citric hop combo this one actually tastes quite nice with the first sip thoroughly enjoyed. Hints of tangerine, oranges on the palate bitter spicy yeast components citric hop bitterness and flavor combine with some coriander spice and wit characteristics along with elements of a decent IPA. Mouthfeel finishes dry and bitter between hops and the spice mix, medium bodied sturdy carbonation it really works for me. I'm a fan so easy to drink very refreshing great mix of different styles offered in some of Harpoon's mixed packs."
"Overall: One of the better Harpoon beers I've had so far as I continue to drink through their offerings. I like the strong hop presence and the mellow flavors provided by the spice and the unfiltered yeast. A good, entry level, standard Belgian IPA."

"O: A nice, refreshing take on the white IPA. Plenty of fruity and citrus goodness with quite a bit of bitterness."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it’s a decent beer to drink for a while."
""

"Lightly sweet with a black pepper finish. Closer to IPA than ""white"" with a definitive hop bite in the swallow. The body is richer than expected. Neutral carbonation. Creamy finish."

"O) A good brew. A profile that ushers in a new season."

"Hazy gold with some sediment floating around in the beer. Thin white cap of fine bubbles, some lacing, decent head retention. Citrusy aroma, zest and grapefruit, fruity rather than pithy, hint of resin. The flavour was a bit sweet up front, a little malty, not much to get excited about. I enjoyed the finish much better. Lingering hop bitterness and citrus fruitiness showed up once the malt faded. Spiciness hung around for a while too. Hint of sourness and slickness. Moderate to high carbonation with medium/low body, Interesting, and pretty good."
"poured from a refrigerated bottle and poured into a over sized wine glass. pours a beutiful golden color. looks alot like a pilsner lager.smell is fruity pineapple and mango sweetness from the hops.a faint belgian yeast note and a biscuity malt background. with faint pineyness. the taste is citrusy bitter hops up front. almost a dank pine resin hint. cracker breadyness on the back of the pallate. the coriander is barley present in the taste. the mouthfeel is crisp and the carbonation cleans the pallate well. pretty dry. overall this is a great white i.p.a. not the best but an above average offering in my opinion....cheers!"

"I'm a big fan of white IPA's, in fact I think its my favorite style (and my favorite beer outright is Accumulation white IPA from New Belgium). This, my second beer from Harpoon, has made me a big fan of what they do. This beer pours excellent without too much spiciness, something a lot of WIPA's over do. All in all a very good beer."

"O: Not a bad White IPA, easy to drink with well hidden alcohol - I could easily put a couple of these back in a session. Nothing great but a solid brew."
""
""
"Overall I guess they need to brew a better Hefeweizen before tackling such a complex style. It just come up average."

"Feel: medium body and carbonation."
""
"Overall - Decent, not great, wouldn't recommend this. Too many better alternatives. Wasn't a drain pour but I can stomach some rough beer haha."

"Drank from a bottle. Smells good. Tastes great. A really good seasonal beer from harpoon. A sharp fruity aftertaste. You can definitely taste the coriander. Goes down smooth and sits on the back of the tongue nicely. Definitely makes a cold day enjoyable. Try this brew, you wont be disappointed."
""
"Overall – A crisp and drier IPA, that is on the more refreshing side. Overall a decent IPA."
""
""
""
"I like the title Long Thaw. It's an acknowledgment to how much winter sucks after the holiday cheer."
"I got no major problems with this brew. Really, I like the overall effort. A nice change of pace."
""
"O: I really really enjoyed this one. I wish this was available for more than just the spring because it is so good."
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing beer. Today was pretty warm, and the evening is still unseasonably above average, this beer just feels right with it. Nice rendition of a Belgian IPA."
""
"The taste also highlights the zesty citrus character with some vague spices and a quickly lingering dry finish."
"Overall: Very good IPA!"
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, better than I expected for a white IPA, esp from Harpoon, but still nothing too special. A bit too thin, hops aren't as good as they could on the taste, spices are interesting but kept mild which is nice."
