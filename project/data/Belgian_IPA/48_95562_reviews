"Poured amber; slightly hazy; very large and durable bone-colored head; bands of sticky lacing. A full pour still left some dark brown sediment in the bottle. Very appealing aroma with brown bread, ripe fruits and a hint of toffee. The flavor follows largely, with intensity building through the finish and into the aftertaste. Very good sweet/bitter balance with an overall slightly sweet character. High ABV is well hidden in the nose, but only partly hidden in the feel and upon tasting. Nice hints of raisins and brandied dates, along with some hop notes, in the aftertaste. Tastes considerably darker than it actually looks. O: less well known than Piraat but worth seeking out."

"Try it though! Excellent"
"Very smooth, enjoyable to drink"
"Alcohol is a powerful but very well interacts with bitterness. Good, but not my taste."

"Pours a hazy amber producing 3+ fingers of bone white, frothy, lasting head that leaves streaks & sheets of clumpy lacing. Aroma is caramel, hay & biscuit, sweet fruity esters of Belgian yeast, especially banana & hints of orange & apple, some cloves & other spices, honey, some alcohol, earthy & grassy hops but less than expected.  Taste is biscuit & caramel malt, sweet fruity yeast: banana, peach, pear & candy apple, cherry with a hint of citrus; honey, alcohol, earth, floral & grassy hops with a nice bitterness in the boozy finish & aftertaste. Sweet yeast fruit notes, alcohol, caramel malt, earth & bitterness make up the aftertaste linger long. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy with moderate carbonation, wet, juicy with some prickles, becoming drier & drawing in the aftertaste."

"Pours an orange color with a slight yeasty sediment.  The aroma had herbal hops, pine, belgian yeast, cotton candy, well water.  Pretty rustic belgian tasting brew.  Candy sugar sweetness, hop bitterness, honey, melon and cotton candy. Sweet to earthy.   Nice bold flavor, definitely tastes like a hop forward Piraat.  A good Belgian IPA that trumps the Belgian factor of its American counterparts."

"Being dry hopped I guess the hops don't stand out as much as other well hopped beers. But I still give it a 4.5 overall!"

"Overall:  Pretty nice BIPA.  More citrus or tropical hops could have made this better, but sticking with Euro style hops and a tripel malt profile still makes this one heck of a brew."

"Pours into a small tulip glass a deep burnt orange with a large white fluffy-sticky crown that leaves globs of lace as it settles into a frothy mass.Leafy and slightly medicinal hops along with deep fruity esters and mild alcohol.Sweet alcohol and tropical fruitiness on the palate with some underlying leafiness,it never gets too sweet though,me personally would like more big brash hops but it's not bad."

"Sweet and delicious. Not as hoppy as I was expecting with the triple hop title."

"Growler shared with the old man. Pours hazy golden with a big fluffy white head. Aroma of sweet pears, some apple, yeast funk, slightly dusty, with some fruity and grassy hop character. Flavor follows with lightly sweet pear, some light hop bite, yeasties, basically like regular Piraat with a slight but more bite. Medium bodied with medium plus carbonation. Overall pretty solid. What’s with the low score here? Pretty much just like the regular version but a bit lighter on the palate with the hop additions."

"It's literally a hoppier Piraat.  That means its just as good as regular Piraat but with more hops.  If you think that sounds good, you'll like it.  Otherwise you probably won't.  I'd personally take regular Piraat over this, but at the same time this is quite good and worth trying."

"A crazily off-kilter beast, this one is - more Tripel-like in its base malt, yeast, and alcohol bearing, before the anemic attempt at hopping it up even has a chance to underwhelm.  Too hot and throat aggrieving to really recommend as a good example of the style."

"O: It’s listed as a Belgian IPA, but really different from others in this style I’ve had.  Strong, somewhat bock like, and like a strong pale ale in many ways.  Bought and drank in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Oct 16th, 2014."

"This was really good. The hop character came through really well. Nice apple and pepper notes in the nose. Earthy in the taste, with some malt breaking through the hops. Hops make up the finish. The alcohol is noticed but pretty well masked here. Really good beer."
"Overall a great interpretation of the original Piraat with a bit more hops!"
""
""
""
"No distinguishable hop aroma at all, could smell only the alcohol. Taste follows the nose with nothing but alcohol. One of the booziest beers I have ever tasted. Couldn't even finish it."
""
""
"Overall: A very good twist on the Piraat Ale. The added hops aren’t overpowering but add a nice juicy and floral kick."
""
""
""
"It has been a long time since I had a regular Piraat, so I at least expected a wave of hops. I'm not sure if it arrived, but I will say that this is one enjoyable beer."
""
"Overall, I really wanted to like this beer but it just misses the mark. Tone the alcohol down a bit and there might really be something here."

"Poured from a bottle into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a slightly hazy medium golden amber with a half finger ivory head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, Belgian yeast, cloves, spicy. Flavor of bready and mildly biscuit malt, apple family fruit, light candi sugar, Belgian spicing. Finishes with a nice combination of grassy hop bitterness and cloves, giving a spicy Belgian feel to the hops. Not much herbal hop flavor, but the dry hopping is apparent in the finish. Medium bodied with nice sharp carbonation. Piraat has been one of my favorite Belgain ales and I was uncertain how I would like this hopped version. No concerns, there is a nice balance between the Belgian base ale, the hops and the traditional Belgian spices. Alcohol is surprisingly well covered. I will be drinking this happily along side the regular Piraat whenever it shows up."

"O: I'm guessing I'm drinking the second release of this ale, as my label is green (not yellow) and it says ""Dry Hopped Ale"" on the label - either that or I'm getting the US version of it - real good stuff, retains some distinctive Piraat flavors and aromas. Features the following hops: Saaz, Tetra, and Aurora, with Cascade for the dry hopping. Fans of Belgian pales and ales in general will probably be pleased. An interesting if not superior take on Piraat. Recommended."

"O: Flavorful and surprisingly drinkable given the ABV. I thought this was balanced and well executed. A great alternative to the original."

"Overall, a very pleasant beer, albeit a strong one. I'd recommend trying it, but it might be best to do so with a friend."

"Its onward trek toward closure turns the beer bitingly bitter and bracingly spicy. While its carbonation is tempered, buffed out by the ordinate residual sweetness that lingers on. Hedging on fusal taste, its numbing prickle is needed to slice through its honey liquor aftertaste and texture."

"O: I really enjoy this beer, even though I have a semi-tired palate from Belgian beers (been drinking them for way too many years). Probably the best beer I have tried from this brewery in a long time. Alcohol could be hidden a little better but still a nice sipping beer."

"3.5/3.75/3.75/4/3.75"
"Not as big and bold as I would have suspected, but still pretty darn good. Pours a deep, dark amber with high fluffy head, that dissipates down to an oily sheen. Rich aroma of dried fruits and brown sugar, dark malts. Taste is more of the raisin, prune, fig with some additional mild sugary sweetness. Overall weight is a bit lighter than I would expect, but still a good Belgian nonetheless."

"The toasted biscuit malts and fruit flavors are there but muted due to the earthy hop character that roars in from the background. It finishes dry with a bitter, memorable bite. 10.5% alcohol well integrated but I felt it by the time I finished writing this review."

"O: Great, great beer. Is it so rare that nobody rates this one? Try it. My topper of 2013."
"Nice moderate carbonation."

"It's still a very good beer, but I had hoped for more of the IPA goodness."
