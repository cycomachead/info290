"Brewery Vivant did an amazing job with this Belgian inspired Double IPA.  For a Double IPA, it was very well balanced and not over hopped.  The citrus flavors and mouthfeel tied this beer together."
"Really awesome. Just right amount of bitter and smooth with an impressive ABV!"

"This pours beautifully and smells great, but feels and tastes like a hop juice box without any bitterness to note from the hops."
""
"Pour is a bright hazed golden amber with a fair bit of white head and medium bubbles with strong retention. Nose has a fair bit of candied sugar, very stale grain, messy yeast and a touch of lemony esters. Faint grassy hay hops. Taste is similar, sweet candied sugar up front, stale grains with a metallic note, lots if sugar mid to late palate with sweet citrus punch and a grassy bitter hop finish with moderate acidity. Finish is syrupy, a bit fizzy on the throat, coats the mouth."

"O- Not really a fan of this or really Belgian IPAs in general. I just don't find the yeast and a big hop profile to be very complementary. On top of that I find this too sweet and pretty expensive at around $17 for a 4pack of pint cans, I mean that's more than even marked up Heady 4packs! I wish I liked more stuff from Vivant but most of the stuff I've had from them just hasn't connected with me."

"Absolutely fantastic. A great sweetness of tropical fruit, with a mix of citru,s and a hoppy, pine like finish. The sweetness nicely cuts the bitterness and leaves you with a perfect taste. Worth the $18 for a 4-pack. I bought 3 :)"

"Poured a nice caramel orange, with a billowing inch plus head, which resolved to a clinging ring around the outside of the glass. Aromas of sweet tropical fruit, melon, wet grass and yeasty hints of raw dough. Taste mimics the aroma, with addition of some sweet caramel malt, thin cracker and underlying peppery spice. Mouthfeel is on the flat side. Faint metallic taste in the finish. ABV is well hidden."

"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but the flavors are quite sweet."

"Another beer courtesy of the legendary woodychandler. Poured from a 16 oz. can. The crack resulted in some beer squirting out and hitting me in the forehead. Settled in the glass with a caramel/orange color and about 1.5 inches of head. Smell had lots of hops, tropical fruits. Taste is hops, grapefruit, some malts, tropical fruits, alcohol is very well hidden. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer worth seeking out."

"A bit too heavy on the Belgian aspect for me, but it's a solid take on the style. The good are a nice compliment to the yeast (something that this style normally misses by a mile.)"
"Poured from the can into a Vivant can glass (again, I got this before I knew what kind of people they were). Clear amber color, with a billowing inch-plus of white head, which sank to a thick ringlet, and laced the glass nicely. In the nose, fruity yeast, soapy, some sugar sweetness, notes of citrus. Vaguely Belgian-IPA-ish. Thinned-out taste somewhat reflected the aroma, estery sweetness, light citrus twang, clovey spice, bready yeast, metallic undertones, crackery malts, neutral alcohol, leaving a bland finish. Overall came off more like an off-flavored DIPA than anything else. Light-medium body, average carbonation. Worth a couple sips, but not something that I would purchase."

"I really like this, it's a solid beer that I've purchased more than once.  If you don't mind your DIPA's a little sweet, you'll like this one."

"O - again, something unique from this brewery - I appreciate that they strive to be different."

"Overall - I like this beer a lot. It is probablky my favorite Brewery Vivant aside from the price of a four pack."

"medium hazed copper color with a 3/8"" head of foam. Hoppy smell with a little citrus and pine. It had a surprisingly mild hop flavor to me, for a double IPA. I prefer less citrus and was not disappointed as the citrus was not the dominant flavor. Not too bitter. I had one glass prior to eating and one glass with my meal of tomato based jambalaya and the flavor of the beer did become sweeter with the meal. After finding the ABV is 9.7% I was surprised because it did not have a strong alcohol flavor."

"It is a hard slap in the mouth, but our palates ask for more. The brewer clearly put little to no restraints on this ale, and we’re glad they didn’t. Clearly more American than Belgian, but it’s great to have the that house yeast edge to set it apart from most of the intensely hopped DIPAs out there."
"O: A pretty tasty brew, but I can't comment too much on it as a Belgian Double IPA since I just don't know the style very well. It definitely has both DIPA and Belgian characteristics, so in that way they got it right. I won't be sad to never have it again, but definitely will enjoy this can."

"O - This was a nice Belgian IPA. This was on the sweet side and slightly expensive."

"16 ounce can into tulip glass; no canning date, but is a recent release. Pours slightly hazy deep orange amber color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of tangerine, orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, lemon zest, grapefruit, banana, clove, caramel, candi sugar, floral, grass, pepper, light pine, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, banana, clove, candi sugar, caramel, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with hops over the yeast character, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, creamy, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian DIPA! All around great complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and malt notes; and dangerously smooth to sip on for 9.3%. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its aroma. There is sweetness, crispiness, freshness, and agedness, in particular afforded by the inoculated Belgian yeast strain that, at times, comes across as a borderline tart zestiness that conjures up thoughts of Flanders red ales. This comes across only slightly in flavoring, but the yeast does give an exotic, bittering punch to the otherwise syrupy, sweet, and caramel-laden DIPA base laid before it. We do, however, wish the hops were a little more pronounced, which would help add freshness throughout the flavoring and lingering aftertaste. This is a fantastic local brew, pulling influence from outside the state and country, for an admixture that truly, and authentically, hits the spot."

"A decent beer but the flavors just don't work here. The Belgian yeast clashes with the citrus, and sap hop profile. Definitely to style, but it's just not very good."
"Excellent, excellent beer. This NEEDS to be a year-rounder for Brewery Vivant, because this is just outstanding, and a great alternative to the typical grapefruit-centric IIPAs on the market. Brilliantly crafted."

"Overall I thought this was a really good beer and a very good example of the style, this just might be the best Belgian Double IPA I've ever had, it had everything that I look for in the style with the bitterness not being to out of control and the citrus and fruity hops were showcased nicely. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, not filling, fairly refreshing and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting worn out or bored with this beer, the flavor keeps me coming back for more, it's a little dangerous how smooth this is for a 9.7% beer. What I liked the most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything that I disliked or would change about this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that it's not in Brewery Vivant's regular lineup, I would love to be able to buy this beer year round. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I've already went back and got a couple more and I will buy a couple more cans if it's still around, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian IPA's. All in all i was very impressed with this beer, since it was from Brewery Vivant I expected it to be good, but they really wowed me with the hop profile, complexity and balance of this beer. Good work guys, this an awesome beer and it's up there as one of the better Brewery Vivant beers I have had."

"This is an extremely well crafted DIPA. The Belgian yeast mixes very well with the hop profile of this beer, which by the way is not over the top leaving your moth a barren wasteland like some other IPA's. This may beat out Thumbprint IIPA as my favorite! Go and get some cans!!"

"The Crack released a spurt of beer that initially surprised me before I got things under CANtrol. The Glug produced anywhere between one to two fingers of light-tan head with decent retention. This was a rare occasion in which I shared a CAN with two other people. Color was solidly amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was not as intensely hoppy as the previous DIPA, but there were still plenty of hops in evidence. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin, especially for the style. Taste was bitter and very hoppy, but not much beyond that. I do not mind unbalanced, but this simply did not stand up in comparison to the previous beer. Finish was citrusy, more toward lemon than grapefruit. Great name, so-so beer."
"overall, this beer is seriously fucking delicious, possibly top 10 beers i've ever had. i knew vivant was solid but between this one and the escoffier bretta they are becoming my favorite brewery."

"overall: A damn good DIPA, one of the best the state of MI has to offer. Seek this out if you like hops and well crafted beer, can't really say anything bad about this one. Might be to early to proclaim, but this easily may become one of my favorites."

"O - This is a very well done IPA. It is loaded with citrus flavors without the bitterness. It drinks pretty easy for a 9.7% ABV."

"It poured a dark cloudy amber with thin head, left plenty of lace around the snifter. The smell? Hops in the face. Floral, citrus, not noticeably Belgian. I had forgotten it would be a Belgian ale, so the yeast flavor in the taste was a pleasant surprise for me. Citrus, pineapple, bitter hops, sugar, and a little alcohol. Medium, well-carbonated, and really pleasant. It's very hoppy and high alcohol, so not one to guzzle. Really nice, I hope to try this one again."

"Overall, this gets some love. I have to say that I notice that BV perhaps serves some of their beers a bit too cold off the tap. Things often start out really bland and just explode into beauty by the end. This is always expected, but a few degrees warmer would do them justice on brews like this one. It seems to take an undue amount of time for the beer to make you fall in love. Some selections can afford to be served more cold, but most of these nuanced selection need less cold. Just my opinion nobody needs, but first impressions are everything. This beer didnt become phenomenal until it was half gone and much more warm. It was served at about a 3.0 star flavor and finished at 4.0 stars. The most important thing is, it became phenomenal. Bravo..."
