I can detect grapefruit and small amount of resin as well.  Malty up front, followed by a strong lemon burst of a hop.  Very tart.  There may be some grapefruit thrown in, but there is mainly a lemon tart aftertaste.  Very bitter.  Not sure what to make of the lemon tartness of it.  Not much in the way of a Belgian flavor either.  It is good but different.  Probably couldn't drink much of this beer in 1 sitting.","jngrizzaffi","Jan 03, 2015"

The taste to me remained fairly consistent over the 45 minutes or so it took to drink it. The label suggests that it delivers hints of Apple and pear.... I never really got the hint! I did however taste bits of citrus and a light pepper finish. I really enjoyed this one ! I like IPA's and  Belgium brews, and this was neither "way hoppy" nor "unhoppy"... So to speak.

What this lacks (?) is grapefruit.  So many other IPAs have grapefruit,  you expect to taste gf, but no. Peppery aftertaste.  And the head still clings.... The lightest mouthfeel you will ever experience.  Overall, an IPA that is not like any other. Is that good or bad?  You decide. As the head stilllllll clings.","johnriley445","Oct 08, 2014"

A slightly musky funkiness...  Some overly ripened fruits...  A hint of white pepper...  The flavor profile is near identical to the aromas detected, but the white pepper notes are dialed up a notch or two...  Medium bodied...  Starts brisk before turning a bit juicy on the finish...

4.15,5.9,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"deschutes can do no wrong, and while they may have overexploited their talent with the citrusy hop varietals in a lot of beers with similar hop complexions, it really never gets old for me, and this is another awesome brew from them. really pale blonde in color, mostly clear, and sporting a luxurious pillowy white head with nice airy lace that gets more elaborate with each sip. the nose is all citra for me, maybe a little leafy greenness to it, but its real fresh and clean, not dissimilar to the fresh squeezed hop profile, but much much lighter in the grain bill in both color and body. almost pilsener-esque, like a belgian yeast lagunitas day time or something similar, the hops are definitely close. the flavor is really clean too, wight he malt being really delicate up front and although the hops are heavy handed in this beer, they aren't sticky or bitter, so the beer drinks awfully easy. the other thing i dig about it is that the belgian part is secondary, its minimally belgian yeasty, not dominated by the fruity high notes, which allows the hops to do their thing, an appropriate focus. so many belgian india pales get lost in their yeast, this one doesnt, its accent flavors of green apple and even green chestnut, its real cool, real subtle, and overall an exceptional bottle of ale, especially at 5 bucks a bomber. great carbonation and supremely refreshing. love it.","StonedTrippin","Aug 02, 2014"

However, they've done a great job of separating the two beers and ended up with two IPAs that harken to some classic Belgian beer characteristics in unique ways. I would love to see this one become a regular seasonal, because it is quite a good summertime IPA.","LambicPentameter","Jul 31, 2014"

The scent carried Belgian yeast and sugar mixed with pine like hops. The taste followed suite....started like a white Belgian then finished like a west coast ipa.

However, the taste is slightly muted vs. some other examples, so I guess that was the trade off. Regardless, I really liked it.","bsp77","Beers"
