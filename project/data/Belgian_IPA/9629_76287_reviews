"thanks again to Dan... low carbonation.... sweet, Belgian-type hop bitterness.  relatively easy to drink; easy for the abv. nothing really special but the typical expected flavor and quite ordinary for the style....."

"Delicious!"
"I liked it a lot but be aware that this a bitter, hoppy Belgian IPA. Great, complex taste though. Imagine a slightly boozy BIPA w/ good fruity/peppery character. I think the ABV is closer to 8.5 than 7.5."

"Short's website lists this as a 8.4 abv. I'm not a huge ipa guy but this was very good. Glad I picked it up."

"Overall, this beer was quite complex. The aroma had so many things going for it, yet the taste was only able to capture a few of those characteristics (and probably my least favorite ones). Work some of the lemon, grapefruit, and coriander into the taste and this beer would really blast off."

"A yeasty, estery beer with not much hop character.  The spicy phenols and restrained use of hop aromas/flavors don't balance the yeast out like I'd like them to.  Short's doesn't do Belgian pales very well, in my opinion, despite having a really firm grasp on many traditional European and American beers."

"O- Best Belgian IPA that I've had. Most are either not hoppy enough or too yeast or too sweet. This one has a great balance of all three. One of Short's best offerings."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 10/2013. Pours moderately hazy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, guava, pear, tangerine, lemon zest, citrus rind, clove, pepper, floral, grass, bread, light banana, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of peach, tangerine, pineapple, pear, guava, lemon zest, citrus rind, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, light banana, light bubblegum, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pineapple, peach, guava, clove, pepper, light banana, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"Overall - Very bitter, but good."

"Bottle as part of a free beer contest. Thanks man! Pours hazy orange with a very small ring of white creamy head. Aroma of oranges, grapefruits, mango, pineapple, and a hint of Belgian yeast in the background. Smells very sweet. Vegetal raw hops are the first thing you taste, yummy. Flavor is sweet orange rinds, some light grapefruit and mango, and interesting dry Belgian yeast finish, and then lingering orange rinds and grapefruit left on the palate for a good while. Bitterness is very present on the way down, nearly puckering. Big, heavy, and slick with medium carbonation. This is pretty unique and very nice."

"I absolutely did not care for it. Doug and I agreed that this beer was a drainpour, and acted accordingly."
"Taste/feel: Well, not being the biggest fan of clove/coriander, I don't love this beer as much as I wanted to, and it's just not what I had expected really at all given the style. It's slightly Belgian, I suppose, but I guess I'm just used to those walloping Belgian IPAs brought on by Brewery Vivant. A floral spice (like clove) is the first thing I notice, then it turns into a sweet sort of citrus, and by the end there's a nice malt balance. This is still a very good beer, and I don't find that floral sort of flavor over-powering, so this is something I really enjoy. Not NEARLY as bitter as I was lead on to believe it would be. Gargle Blaster slowly grew on me as I worked my way down the glass."
"O - Decent offering from Short's. Wouldn't turn down, but wouldn't seek out."

"O: Outstanding. Definitely worth a six-pack purchase if you're seeking it out."

"Overall: a well crafted and strong hoppy beer. just doesn't do it for me."

"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and very good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style and it all came together very well with some great balance. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention and It kept me coming back for more, I could see myself being pretty happy drinking a few of these and I think this would be a great summertime beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both very good and I couldn't stop smelling and tasting it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there's not a single thing that I didn't like or would change, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, I bought my limit of three and if there's any left next time I go to the beer store I'm sure I will get my limit again and I will for sure be getting it when they release it again next year. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or anybody who likes hoppy beers in general. All in all I was very happy with this beer, it was just as good as I remember and so far I think it's my favorite of the style, I like it a little more than Brewery Vivant's Trebuchet, I like the hop profile in this beer just a little more. This made for a great 700th review, it was a nice treat to celebrate this milestone with such a great beer. When I was at Shorts I told the bartender that I really think they should bottle it and apparently I wasn't the only one since my wish came true. Thanks a lot for continuing to give the good people from Michigan exactly what they want, there's no doubt Short's is my favorite brewery, keep up the good work guys."

"Pours a clear golden color with a off-white head that fades slowly with great lacing. Smell has a hint of Belgium yeast with grapefruit and other citrus notes. Taste is very similar to the nose with a nice hop bitterness. Medium to lighter mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall a great IPA without to much of the Belgian flavors that would mask the hops flavors."

"O - This is a solid Ameri-Belgo DIPA. I usually don't prefer the belgian style IPA's but this is nice because the robust american style hops take center while the Belgian flavors are secondary."

"I am a huge fan of Short's...this is the best of the bunch in my book. Pleeaaase bottle it."

"This was brewed exclusively brewed with Galaxy hop. They supplied a amazing citrus tropical flavor and nose. I didn't get a ton of ""Belgian"" flavors but I beg they bottle this one."
"O: Not my favorite. To much hop bitterness for me."
