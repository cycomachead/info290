"Cheers!"

"Great yeast complexity and hop flavour and bittering"
""
"TASTE: Smooth, deep crispness, moderate-sized body, fluffy, very hoppy, earthy, mineral, leafy, dried grass, spicy, slight resin, faintly biscuity, apple skin, alcohol"
""
"Colour is golden with a little bit of orange. Nice floral aroma. Taste is a bit sweet (honey?) that evolves into a nice bitterness (floral, perhaps a bit of orange too). Very nice, refreshing beer."
""
"I really enjoyed this one! I imagine it's one you have to have fresh."

"Another very nice Belgian offering here, this one was quite bitter but as I suspected not quite as bitter as some of the American style beers I've reviewed on here. There was a lot of spice and background fruits to this one that balanced the beer out well and the tart flavours started strong but settled down was the beer had time to open up a little. Overall a decent beer and one well worth picking up."

"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Prairie Artisan Ales teku glass. Toasted penny color with a bubbly white head. The nose is similar to a saison or tripel. Yeast, cloves, banana and apple. Tastes of sweet malts, banana, spice and a very slight touch of bitterness at the very end of the aftertaste. Medium mouth, but the carbonation gives it a dry crispness. For a beer with a fairly mellow taste, there's a lot of complexity. I really like how they've made an interesting beer without a lot of big flavors."

"Quite a fantastic beer, and cheap(8$ for 750mL) for being so highly rated by the bros."
"The pour to this was astounding as the fluffy head, dark golden hue, cloudy appearance, and bubbles on the *side* of my pint glass all combined for an extremely pleasing first impression. The lacing was up to snuff as well, as lots of soapy layers made themselves felt once I worked my way through this. Not a strong aroma to this beer but there was some yeast and apple to be found in the nose. Both of those were present in the taste, along with the grassy hops, pear, candied sugar and booze underneath everything else."

"Beer was a little foamy when poured from the bottle, suggesting some issues with the bottle conditioning, but the mouthfeel was not negatively affected."

"O: One of the most complex yet simple tastes I have had from the region. As my last name is ""Hommell"" (from the root Hommel) I might have bumped it up a point. However, this beer is absolutely fantastic."

"A true Belgian classic with very few beers like it anywhere in the world. High in alcohol for it's body depth maybe, but it still manages to hide the fact it sits at 7.5% ABV."

"Good, solid Belgian ale. Reminds me a little of Duvel. Cloudy color, hoppy, rich taste. Goes down smooth, very little aftertaste. Good Belgian but not in the rarefied air class of a Westvleteren brew. Would try again. Purchased in Newton, MA at the Craft Beer Cellar."

"O-This is a very unique beer. I tasted two bottles and the second had far more bitter, sharp hops than the first, but both had a strange honey-herbal sweetness to them. I'm not sure that I actually liked this beer, but I was so intrigued that I was left wanting to drink it again."

"Excellent Belgian ale."
"Overall, I really feel like I could drink gallons of this beer all day. It is really that good. A great flavor and mouthfeel combined with a hefty bitterness makes this one extremely quaffable and well put together brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd like like to try again, see if the metallic flavor/compound is less present."
""
""
""
"I really like this beer especially since I drank from tab sitting outside in the sunshine after a bike tour through the hop gardens around Poperinge. Very drinkable with a dangerous high 7.5ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would say this leans more towards a powerful Belgian wheat than the weird flavors you would get in another Belgian IPA."
""
"50"
""
""
"Mouthfeel: good Belgian carbonation, there is an oily feel from the hops, the nice fizzy and oily feel gives it a semi-creamy feel, lingering floral and that twist of lemon rind on the aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: quite an excellent, memorable beer - tastes a bit ""high-brow"" - quite moreish - a little more malt (grain) flavor and depth would be nice, however, it's plenty balanced and solid for what it is - old favorite of mine - recommended!"
""
"Zesty and spicy in an elegant way and with a high drinkability. Hints of orange, herbs and honey. Dry aftertaste, and here you feel a little bit more its hops. I am mentioning this as the title suggests a good deal of hops. So it felt to me more like a Belgian Blond Ale rather than a Belgian IPA. 7.5% ABV is unnoticeable. Very pleasant beer to drink, full of flavors and refreshing. Excellent."
"Really enjoyed this little bottle of beer."
""
""
""
"An inspiring brew, to say the least, and wishing I could say more."
""
"Nice Belgian IPA. Borders on Belgian pale ale territory."
"O: This is a very delicious beer and I would for sure get this beer again. So good and glad I was able to get my hands on a bottle of this"
"O - A wonderful beer from a wonderful little town"
"Either this was past its prime or I'm missing something. Underwhelming along with lots of off putting metallic flavors."
"O: Overall the taste and smell is cheap and stale. Im shocked by all the great reviews on this because I was disappointed. Lager yeast is more prevalent than the expected Belgian style. Pretty disappointed in this selection and I really want my money back. Don't waste your time."
""
""
""
"This was a great treat. Firm and balanced, it is a good composition of strong yeast, firm malt and bitter hops for an interesting and complex beer. More on the Belgium Ale side of the spectrum it combines a good amount of hoppiness to lend a nice bitterness, that works well."
""
"Overall - This IPA is incredible when served chilled. Well-balanced and yet not too overpowering, this is a delicious Belgian gem done right."
""
"Pours a bright golden wit a thick foamy off white head that loudly dissipated. Smells of assorted citrus peels, mainly lemon with some tangy Belgian yeast. It tastes great, lots of lemony op flavor with a hint of pine, banana and lots of yeast. The beer is light with lots of soft carbonation and a dry finish. This is a great beer, I could live off of these guys."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an outstanding beer. Not many good Belgian ipas out there but this one is really good. Like most European beers the tastes are very subtle as compared to Americans that tend to be out front. I've had it a few times and will definitely be back."
""
""
""
"I'd like like to try again, see if the metallic flavor/compound is less present."

"Poured from bottle into its own Hommel tulip at a cafe in a small town in Belgium. Pours a hazy straw with nice white foam. Great yeasty hop aromas, slight citrus notes. Taste is slightly hoppy, peppery, citrusy, yeasty... a lot of complex flavors with this. Really great traditional belgian IPA..not overly hopped, but you get the full flavor and characteristics of the mellow hops. Well worth a try!"
"This seems pretty ho hum. I was hopping for some brighter hop characteristics with a crisp and dryer body. I have had pretty hoppy beers from Belgian breweries. This seems to subdued and mild, even for a non hop head like me. One that loves bright, crisp, non bitter hops that can be a great asset for the style. This ain't it."
""

"Pours a pale cloudy gold, fantastic lacing, quarter inch fine foam head that doesn't dissipate. Scent of cloves, fig, citrus, and fine belgian yeast. Taste is of gentle but prominent hops, pepper, sweet citrus, and yeast. Mouthfeel is very smooth and thick, almost creamy, just what I'd expect from a good belgian brew. Very well balanced too, and it has a very fine, light sort of carbonation. A unique IPA, overall a phenomenal brew, highly recommended."
""
""
"I’ll have another."
""
""
"O: Good beer for the style, but the bit a bit too sweet for me to really enjoy."
"Overall this is a very interesting beer. Unable to guess from the bottle what it is (i.e. how descriptive is Hommel?), I wasn't sure if this was a highly hopped Belgian Strong Pale or something even more experimental. It was a nice drink, and would be a great warm weather beer, though the well hidden 7.5% ABV pushes it a little out of the session zone. Tasty!"
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of Belgian yeast notes, as well as some spices, grass and citrus which I guess comes from the hops. The flavor is very similar, with a lot of grass and citrus notes, as well as some spicy and slightly funky Belgian yeast. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"330 ml bottle into chalice, best by 4/2013. Pours extremely peppery cloudy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some nice thick soapy lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, herbal, grass, apple, bread, orange, apricot, earth, slight funkiness, and big yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity. Taste of big lemon, orange, pepper, grass, pear, herbal, bread, banana, earth, apricot, and yeast spices. Nice amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, light fruits, pepper, herbal, grass, bread, and yeasts spices on the finish for a good bit. Really great balance of spicy flavors with sweetness; with a very nice amount of complexity. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy and extremely crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all after the finish. Very easy to drink due to the great flavor balance. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian IPA! Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth. I will be having this again."
"Overall - Good. I find it tough to review Belgian IPAs. They're supposed to be sweet-ish, but I don't always want them to be. Good hop profile in this one, though."
"Overall a good beer."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a superb ale, not ordinary by any means, but just downright delicious and refreshing as hell. Just another reason to love those belgians."
""
""
""
"A nice little beer. Not sure I call it as epic as some others, but it’s real nice."
""
"Overall this is a refreshing and a little different beer, very enjoyable."
"O: This is a beer that could get me in trouble. The ABV is masked by the body and citrus flavors from the hops. I also really love the nose, could smell this beer for hours."
"This is a delightful beer. I am enjoying the fresh orange expression due to the Hallertauer or maybe there's some additional orange rind thrown in. The bready malt and orange flavors complement the funky yeast. Really drinks smoothly and the ABV is just right at 7.5% Although this beer has a reputation for being hoppy, it is only mildly hoppy, with low alpha acid hops, and in the fruity, orange hop direction that I find increasingly enjoyable (Citra). I think this is a top example of a Belgian IPA brewed in a traditional hop growing area of Belgium, what's not to like? Not so easy to find in CA, glad I went to the Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa. Now, I hope to find this on draft sometime."
"Quite nice, but definitely not hoppy. More like a Belgian blonde or golden ale. However, I've come across other reviews comparing IPAs to this beer, so perhaps the example I have has faded or been mishandled. I'll try it again at some point. At any rate, it has a subtle, well-balanced character and impressive body that make it highly drinkable. Well worth sampling."

"750ml corked & caged. It pours a cloudy pale gold with a frothy, sticky head that settles to a rocky foamy landscapy thing. Smells of medicinal phenols, sugar and citrus. taste is crisp apples, then quickly settles to a very pleasant biscuity earthiness. Very light, very refreshing. WOW! I like this a lot. Mouthfeel is tingly carbonation followed up by a finish slicker than a snake who graduated from oil wrestling academy. They have that. Overall a really great beer. I'm not sure the style definition of a Belgian IPA, but the hops are very subtle, just contributing flavor without that ""in your face"" bitterness I exprected. It is light, refreshing, and yet substantial. I'm adding this to the rotation for sure."
"The beer pours an effervescent golden with no head or haze. It smells...disappointing. There is a slight indication of hops, but nothing that would lead me to believe it was either Belgain or an IPA. The taste was a light honey sweetness with citrus zest, but still no hops. The mouthfeel was initially tolerable, but became syrupy sweet and gross after awhile. I would probably never try this beer again on tap, although maybe in bottles."
"D - Pretty easy drinking - but certainly not an IPA. A little bit filling due to the hefty carbonation. Alcohol is strong but well hidden."
""

"O: This beer is rather yeasty, but it’s easy to drink and a good representation of the style."

"Tart citrus on nose, fresh hops with a metallic edge. The mineral character continues on the palate, sour and finishing with a long tart green apple that refuses to go away, in a good way. This is not the malty Belgian IPA you are used to, but rather all about freshness, crispness and drinkability. Pair with Thai or Indianfood."
""
"O: A nice moderately hoppy Belgian ale. Houblon Chouffe is the better widely available offering in the ""Belgian IPA"" style group."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking hazy gold color. The head was fluffy and white. The retention is pretty strong here where the lacing doesn't really do too much. The smell of the beer isn't overly hoppy, there is a surprising sweetness in there actually. It smells rather grainy with just a touch of citrus in there. The taste is a bit on the metallic side in the very beginning of each sip. The flavors changes nicely as it settles on the tastebuds. It's got a super mellow hoppy bitterness to it. The mouthfeel of the beer is very smooth but has a really nice carbonation to it also. Overall this was impressive to me. I wasn't sure how much I would like it but I'm very glad I got to try it. I would drink it again if it was around."
""
""
"Overall: I received this for volunteering four months ago at the BBF and what a treat it is. I am very happy to have gotten this in my volunteer box and will be looking for more of it in the future. Label may look strange, but the beer is far from strange and very delicious."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fine, is arguably the finest part of this beer. It's a true medium-bodied beer that is pleasant to swish around in your mouth (flavor excluded). Overall, though, this is a disappointment. It strikes me as a cluttered, indecisive beer whose yeast has run roughshod over everything else."
""

"Overall: a delightful beer. I love a good strong Belgian pale ale, and this fills that bill as well as bringing in the bitterness to back up the stylistic sweetness. A great beer."
""
""
""
"not cheap but I don't feel ripped off, this ones worth a try for sure"
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, sweet, with a semi dry finish."
"Poured into a stem glass, a hazy golden color with a nice cap of foamy white head. Aroma of sweet pale malts, honey, light fruity esters, and sunshowers in a flower garden. Taste of honey and sweet malts up front, with an almost instantaneous blast of spice and citrusy goodness, bready, Belgian yeast, pepper, cloves, pears and peaches. Complex and tasty, and quite light in the mouth. Nice and drinkable."
"Overall: one of the best belgian IPA's I've had. Actually this is the best belgian IPA I've ever had."
"A decent IPA, rendered Flanders-style, though not as zingy as some of its brethren/competitors. The yeast has a lot to do with that, as does the hops' nature, I would imagine. Oh, what the hell: ""Ayeeee chee waaawaaa!"" - and according to an encounter with Marge, he's Belgian: Aye yi yi!"
"This is a wonderful beer, the fact that it pulls some surprises for a Belgian beer is a great surprise and is very compatible with the North American palate. This thing is a must try."
"Overall: A decent brew but unremarkable in my opinion. I think this style (BIPA) has so much to offer and so many ways to go around and try and find something unique that i really can't in good conscious say that i see this as a anything other than a malty hoped up brew."
"The color is golden yellow. Hazy. Nice white soapy head that crowns the beer. Nice looking. The aroma presents notes of belgian yeast(typical of belgian beers). Some floral notes there. I would have thought the aroma to be stronger. It is good, but appears to be weak in intensity. It isn't bad 'tho. On the taste, the first sip shows notes of metal... the finish is very dry with belgian yeast. Easy to drink and very refreshing. A good beer for the summer. I like this and it isn't heavy has belgian beers could be sometimes."
"Served from bottle into a Mikkeller stemmed tulip. Poured a murky red brown with a three finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, bread, and banana. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, dark fruit, banana, and subtle wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The flavors on this one were really well balanced and refreshing which is a welcome change for this style for me. The aroma was also quite inviting and pleasant to the nose. Really glad I finally got around to buying and drinking one of these. Might be buying a few more to keep in my fridge year-round."
"Overall, this is an excellent ale, and I liked the inclusion of both sweet and sour notes. Well worth trying."
"D - This is a very musty example of the style with a thick malt base. It seems to have an unusually high level of malt flavor and sweetness for a Belgian brewed beer and it is barely balanced despite the strong hop character. Not bad, but I tend to prefer Belgian IPAs that are brewed with American character hops to contrast the yeast and malt, those with grassy, continental hops are a bit too dull for my taste."
"O: Definitely a great Belgian style IPA; hoppier than other Belgian IPAs I've had, as well as being sweeter; pleasantly surprised. Don't miss out on this one!"
"Overall: Great example of how a hoppy beer should be"
"jd"
"Time to try a Belgian IPA that's actually from Belgium, instead of American attempts on this style. This is a great looking brew, for sure. It pours a nice deep golden color crested by a huge, fluffy head that laces well. The aroma is entirely dominated by sweet, bubblegummy Belgian yeasts. Try as I may, I can't coax out any of the other wonderful scents other reviewers posted. Sweet Belgian yeasts. That's it. The taste on this is fairly nice, the hoppiness comes through much better, leaving the sweet yeasts as a backing role. There's also a nice floral character, but all this is let down by a fairly strong metallic note that comes through on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's fairly light and creamy. The drinkability is quite good. Overall, an enjoyable brew. Perhaps a bit too heavy on the yeasts, especially on the nose, but otherwise good."
"An excellent tasting beer, well balanced with a nice finish. Definitely give this one a try!"
"Poured a hazy orange, with a big fluffy white head which subsides to a light head, leaving behind some sticky lace and a nice collar. Tons of sediment. Nose is some citrus, some rind, orange, a big yeasty quality and a light milky quality that I can't quite figure out. Simple and pleasant. Taste is just as simple, orange and citrus with hints of pineapple and peach. Moderate hop flavour and strength, and some drying yeast in the finish. Good medium-full feel, solid bitterness and a light peppery carbonation. Quite nice!"
"A decent Belgian but a little too light and fizzy for my liking. Label is calming."
"Mouthfeel is slightly sharp, finishing spicy and carbonated well. Medium, balanced, great beer overall."
"Dr: It goes right down, but there's hardly any time to enjoy it. Worth trying just to experience this strange effect. The smell is absolutely delightful, but sadly the taste doesn't live up to the scent's promise."
"Fruity ale characteristics in the feel of this brew. Delicate at first glance with a fiercer second opinion. Hops aid in creating a creamy body. Medium bodied on the lighter side."
"Poured a huge 4"" head which took it's time settling. Straw yellow color with a faint haze to it. Smell is citrus and malt and hints of spice. Taste has more of the same as well as a decent acidic zing which makes the finish moderate length. Pretty lightweight in body. It's an excellent refreshing summer beer, lighter than so many of the other Belgian offerings."
"Overall/Drinkability-This is extremely drinkable beer and very refreshing, perfect spring weather beer."
"Man, I love this one. Makes for a perfect summer ale to have for those summer backyard bbq's! Get it if you can."
"Pours a murky honey orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small areas of lattice-like lace on the drink down. Smells of grape juice, honey, and sweet flowers. Taste is of bitter grape juice, honey, citrus zest, and a subdued floral bouquet. Slight hop bitterness after each sip that quickly fades. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and is crisp and clean with each sip. Overall. this is a good beer with nice fruit/floral characteristics."
"M/D: Medium bodied, with a good carbonation. A pretty good Belgian IPA, not very bitter, but very tasty and well made."
"Smooth, rich, flavoursome, but pleasantly unique. This is a lovely drop of beer--one which accentuates the Belgians' commitment to craft, not just extremity."
"This is a top notch Belgian IPA. This beer improved greatly as it warmed up. I like the way the yeast improved on the flavor in the last pour from the bottle."
"An interesting brew, to me it was lambic meets pils, and actually benefiting from both sides."
"Overall, this beer definitely makes my top ten list. Unbelievable. I will buy this EVERY time I see it."
"The flavor matches the aroma exactly. Sour malt base with a yeasty bite with a light bittering hop. Interestingly, there isn't much hop in the aftertaste; again, it's mostly sour. The body tilts to the thinner side, but there's also a lighter than usual carbonation. Overall, I would not call this a Belgian IPA."
"D- Easy drinker. Could sit with one or two a night."
"D - This is an interesting beer. I couldn't decipher the date markings but I wonder if the mustiness was due to age."
"As a Belgian IPA and supposedly a pinnacle example of the style, I am a little disappointed in what this has to offer. The hops were too mild for me to pick up much hop flavors. On the whole this felt like an average tripel crossed very lightly with an IPA which is not well hopped. It is still a good beer nonetheless but I'm not so sure if it really lives up well to its style."
"M/D - Medium, silky mouth with a great fizz to finish. If only a little drier I would have scored it even higher. Overall, a very impressive beer."
"Honestly, I expecfted a lot more from what people said about this beer - doesn't even begin to compare to Houblon Chouffe."
"Pours a orangish body with real good frothy head that dies slow with lace. A spicy, sour grape/tart fruit and citric hop aroma as well as yeasty; something like apple or pear in as well. Little bit of sugariness for sweetness and some spices come in as well. Great balance comes to my mind, especially for the Belgian take on this style. Slightly smooth and creamy, the beer is light-bodied but still has a carbonation that makes the beer sharp and pronounces the citric hops which abound. Great balance is achieved with tart fruit tastes like grape skin, apple and pear. Clove and pepper round out the body which has a good candi-sugar and caramel sweetness as well a grainy, bready touch. Easy to drink with good fruit and sweetness while still maintaing a large hop edge, this beer finishes real crisp and is a must for anyone who appreciates Belgian ales."
"D- Very refreshing when served cold, delightfully wild when it warms... definitely worth a repeat."
"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a chalice, at around 45-50 degrees F. Poured a soapy, white head about an inch thick, eventually forming a dense cap. Lots of lacing. The beer is dark straw or gold with small bubbles, a bit cloudy (but the yeast was disturbed). The aroma is of citrus, grass, hay, and perhaps a little clove or spice, but I find it a bit muted. Flavors of lemongrass, resin, and citrus seem to dominate at first, supported by honey and a definite graininess. The beer finishes exceptionally dry, almost puckeringly so. Something like a hoppy saison or a really, really hoppy tripel. Carbonation is highly evident throughout. Presents as a light bodied beer, and quite refreshing."
"Carbonation is too high."
"Overall, an amazingly good beer. I would buy it by the barrel-full."
"Frothy off-white head is semi-loose with a fair bit of larger bubbles, quickly brings it down from over two fingers to a thin coating across the surface, the lacing is wispy but there. Light orange to yellow color, hazy with close to full opacity, a few beads here and there visible. Earthy, peaty, tarry nose with lichens, tree bark, black tea leaves, brown rice before slowly switching gears into lemon, orange pith, biscuit, white pepper and a small core of apricot, white peach, yellow apple, white grape fruit scents, lasts well. Full-bodied, the carbonation is gentle and pushes things out towards your cheeks. Clove, pepper, yeast and country style multi-grain bread trump the damp earth, forest floor matter components, still the grapefruit, orange citrus more dry pith than zest or juice. The apricot, peach, apple fruit not that sweet, spiked by cinnamon notes. Then maybe witch hazel and banana as it warms. Never fully loses the earthy, wet grass dimension but doesn't seem unclean."
"Popperings Hommel pours a nice gold color, with a bit of head, but not too much. It is the taste and drinkability that it truly excels. If you ever have the chance to try it, please, do so."
"Eh, I was wrong. Beer is weak in the flavor department and in the bitterness department. Medium to light in body, some esters on the mid palate but the finish is non-existent. The forward flavors are weak and subdued. Make an IPA... seriously."
"D - My favourite Belgian IPA, because of it subtleness and balance. This really is the benchmark of the style that non belgian examples just cannot match for whatever reason."
"D- Easy to drink. No alc taste. A good beer, but not impressive."
"The balance of the flavors of this beer was very nice. Very drinkable for me. I've had a few of these at The Monkey..."
"D: an above average offering, and a treat from the tap in the center of hop production in Belgium"
"Best matches are earthy flavors - cheese, roasted veggies, crusty bread or crackers, salami with stout mustard. Exceptional beer."
"mouthfeel is good...holds up to the hopping. some lemon from the hops. good malt sweetness and pleasantly nutty, with butterscotch"
"Overall, this is a good brew."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy the balance of complex flavors in this beer. Definitely something I will come back to."
"Enjoyable beer!"
"Drinks easy, not my favorite Belgian IPA, but a great/tasty example of the style despite the green the bottle..."
"The taste is smooth and apple as well. The 7.5 abv is not massive, but for how easy this one is to consume, I'd take this one every day. The large price tag is a major block for this."
"Pours a hazy bright orange color with visible particles and a great two to two and a half finger head which gives way to lacing up and down the glass leaving rings after every drink. The smell is of belgium hops as well as a nice sweet malt backbone with hints of clove and citrus. The taste is of sweet malt with belgium hop bite that is not too bitter. There is also hints of yeast, clove, green apples, and cinnimon as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and full. The drinkability is great, so smooth, and such as nice flavor. You can easily have more than one of these."
"Cheers!"
"Taste makes up for the smell. Very nice Belgian malt and mild Belgian hops. So easy to drink!!! It is somewhat sweet with citrus. The body is rather heavy. Alcohol is not evident and this beer is too drinkable for my own good. Very nice beer. I think fresh is good with this one."
"drinkability - price considered (~$5 per 11.2oz bottle), this was a bit of a disappointment, I believe this was my first sample of a Belgian IPA and it was a decent beer worth trying."
"This is a big Belgian Ale. The mixture of earthiness, almost nutty at times, and tartness provides a unique and enjoyable ale from Belgium."
"Drinkability: Very interesting taste for a Belgian IPA. I enjoyed this one a lot. The alcohol is very well hidden. I could have several."
"This is one of my favorite Belgian beers. I've had it both on tap and in the bottle. It seems to bottle and transport well."
"D: Nice and light, would go well with dinner. Crisp and refreshing"
"Overall: I'm not sure about this beer. I reviewed it well, as it was a good beer; it's just different. But I think it's different in a good way, it's not in your face, but definitely doesn't disappoint. A nice change from American IPAs."
"On-tap at Monk's in Philly, served in a tulip. Went great with my bowl of mussels. I would have liked a bit more hop flavor and bitterness, but this was still a great Belgian ale. There's a mellow spicy flavor that never overwhelms the character, but certainly defines the beer with subtle pepper, dry herb, and lemon peel. For the strength, the body is still easy to drink (like it should be for the style). Overall, this is really a classic worth picking up."
"*I looked at the sediment in several different lightings and even shone a flashlight thru it, trying to figure out what the heck were the ""floaties."" More experienced reviewers should probably ignore this observation, but I found it rather interesting, although not especially appealing."
"D - Overall a very interesting beer. It is a well-made Belgian golden beer with an elevated hop level. Hopheads who hear of it may be disappointed when they try it, but to me the hop level is enough to add complexity without totally knocking the beer out of balance."
"M, D- With the body of a Tripel, but drier and hoppier on the finish, it drinks accordingly. CO2 turned out fine for an exuberant gusher, and the ABV was undetectable."
"I went out and bought a six pack of this after reading the great reviews on BA. This is a very smooth beer, but I was a little disappointed with the flavor ... maybe my expectations were too high. But definitely worth trying."
"pours with a nice white head. It laces the glass. Color is yellow with slight orange hue and cloudy with lots of carbonation. Aroma is very pleasant. citrus notes with a touch of vanilla and alcohol. Taste is decent, but not great. It has a little hop bite and aftertaste is a little phenolic. Mouthfeel is good with lots of carbonation. Overall, very good."
"We got a magnum (!) of this, poured into a wine glass. A hazy golden with lots of white head, the smell is peppery, the taste is almost like a wit but with a fair amount of hops, more of the continental grassy type than floral American. good overall, not great"
"D: A solid brew recommended by the owner of my local bottleshop. Comfortably in the Belgian IPA category, but I think a bigger hop content would not only solidify that designation but also improve the rating in the smell and taste departments. Definitely worth a try."
"d- these belgian ipas always challenge my palate, and this was a drinkable one, gotta say that i preferred the houblon chouffe."
"D- A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I would gladly recommend this to anyone. Had it with a big pasta dinner, went with it wonderfully. Quite quaffable."
"Overall - A good beer, but I was expecting more flavour."
"The body is full and creamy. Carbonation level is a little lower than I'd like. A little slick going down. Nice earthy bitter flavors in this one. No sharp hops, but just a nice subtle bitterness that doesn't last long and is not grating at all. Mild honey flavor in there as well. Some yeasty aspects noted. Definitely Belgian. I liked this offering. Probably one of the better of the styles that I've had. Recommend."
"D: The beer doesn't feel like 7.5%, at least at first. I went through the glass rather quickly and felt it in the long run."
"Overall a very nice earthy hop forward ale."
"It isn't my first choice for this style but it isn't bad."
"pours a simply beautiful but slightly hazy golden/yellow slight orange color with a nice 2 finger head that recedes rather quickly to a white fresh looking ring with nice clinging lace on the side..the smell is slight clove with a stronger citrus hop and spice smell..i also smell various fruits like bananas and pears ..the taste is a blend of hops and malts and citrus and yeast not bitter at all as it warms has a little sour taste that is good..this is easy drinking it is a little sweet/sour( it changes as it warms) and syrup tasting unlike the smell..overall its a great ipa nicely balanced crisp and clean with a medium mouth feel..its not one to drink alot of in one sitting IMO... but one to try..i enjoyed this one"
"F: Finishes slightly pale and bitter, a little more so than the taste. A little dryness comes in, but not too much as a little of that sweet malt flavor lingers, as well as syrupy. A little chewy flavor lingers too. Still waiting on the nice hops, but seeing as how Belgians tend to sit in warehouses and shelves for a while, and being an IPA it may be contrasted. I also noticed it has best before 09/09, so it's older than it should be. I'll have to see if I can find a fresh one, or have it on tap somewhere."
"Overall I was very happy to try this as I have seen it many times but never consumed it due to the no frills label. My mistake. Definitely worthy of a try."
"An eminently drinkable beer. My preferences for Belgian IPAs lean towards the American take on the style (an IPA brewed with Belgian yeast rather than a Tripel with some extra hops) but this is good nonetheless."
"This beer is all about freshness. Bottles in the States have been variable but one time I had it on tap in Amsterdam. It was freshly written on the chalkboard beer list and the waitress said they had just tapped the keg that day. Boy! What a difference: great floral/citrusy hop aroma along with a grassy yeastiness. The beer was crisp, dry, slightly sour with great hop flavor, a fine mousse and a great finsh that balanced malt/alcohol sweetness and hop bitterness with a touch of tangy acidity. Outstanding!"
"D Really easy drinking for the style really. I finished the 11.2 ounces within a few minutes. It is probably too expensive to drink very much of but if money were no object I could drink 3 or 4 of them. 4.0"
"Great balance between sweetness and bitterness. Flavors of honey, chamomile tea and minerals with a little bit of middle eastern spices lurking. Bisuity malt with well intergrated hops and a refreshing drinkability. Earthy dry finish. This beer has a way of disapearing quickly."
"D: Excellent; like the complexity despite the consistent undercurrent of bitter hops. I usually like Belgian IPAs because of the layers of flavor you can peel away; American IPAs are more of a one-trick pony."
"This is an oustanding beer."
"D- not bad but the flavor is not for me. If you like Belgian IPA's then this is right up your alley. I prefer the american IPA's"
"D - Insanely quaffable... Classy and sophisticated... Smooth... Even... Delicate..."
"The flavors are highly hopped and can feel a touch of honey in the aroma that is quite characteristic. Like any India Pale Ale that respect, we also find the purifying force of hops in the tasting, this one tinged with a character of yeast rather pronounced. In conclusion, an archetype of the strong hoppy beer that will appeal to all, slightly beaten."
"This is a sipper--otherwise, far too overwhelming. Please, try this out."
"The taste is slightly meaty, with a lightly fruity, warm but restrained alcoholic quality, a light, but firm maltiness with some grain, hint of coriander, citrus, but otherwise a lot of grassy-leafy hops, some spiciness. It's balanced in bitterness and sweetness, a bit on the drier side. It has a slight oiliness."
"D: I was impressed. I went in expecting nothing and was surprised. I would have this again in a heartbeat."
"A very good beer to me which I always find well balanced, full of flavor and easy to drink; a definite session beer and a recommendation to try this brew as it’s good on it’s own and very good with a meal."
"D - At 7.5% ABV, this is probably as good as it gets for a Belgian. Almost too drinkable. (Notice that I said ""almost."") :)"
"D: This is a deceptively strong beer, which seems to be a hallmark of this style. It goes down easily. My glass was gone in what seemed like record time for a beer of this strength. An excellent pickup."
"Well-put together brew. Nice palate, easy to drink, and quite refreshing. Few beers are this light with this much flavor."
"Another goody from the shelves of Ohoove's basement, this one shows an extremely cloudy tan amber color with a giant white fluffy head and lots of splotchy lace. The aroma is bready malt with light citrus (orange/lemon). Pleasant. The flavor brings a bright tart lemon yeast that bites the tongue. This mellows as you go and offers more malty nutmeg and some floral edges and clove. Well carbonated, decent drinker, refreshing, all around good stuff for the style."
"Flavor is sweet and fruity with nice hoppy finish."
"Medium body. Carbonation is appropriate. Pretty easy drinker, and a really interesting beer. Good stuff. Thanks to khiasmus for the recommendation."
"Soft, cushy, bottle conditioned texture. The well balanced hoppiness makes this refreshing and very drinkable; it helps that I enjoy a heavy dose of black pepper."
"I tend to love IPAs so a great bartender recommended this to me. Smell was an accurate introduction. Bold floral and citrus notes in the taste. Detected a hint of apricot. Extremely well-balanced. Mouthfeel was simple and light and let the balanced taste of hops be the hero. Drinkability was supreme -- I wanted nothing but this beer when I first tried it."
"D - The numbers in this review may be somewhat arbitrary as I'm not sure what constitutes a ""good"" Belgian IPA. I'd always imagined and read them as hopped up tripels, and while Poperings Hommel Ale exhibits some hoppy characteristics and some tripel characteristics, it isn't a simple mix of the two; furthermore I understand that this brew was once classified as a BSPA. Though the hops never really take the center stage, it's extremely well balanced even if not a standout among Belgians. An enjoyable and somewhat challenging beer that I hope to revisit when and if I understand the style better."
"D: Decently quaffable for the style. Another solid Belgian IPA, though for the price I'd probably stick with Houblon Chouffe."
"I think this was my first Belgian IPA ,but I'm sure I'll buy this one again."
"This beer pours a lovely amber hue which leaves a distinct creamy two finger head which leaves prominent sticky lacing all down the glass,this beer smells of beautiful freshly herbal,rose boutiques with beautiful fresh elegant hop aromas like it they have just been harvested,the taste of this beer has no bitterness at all to it and could def not be classed as full IPA or even a Belgian IPA but never the less a beautiful floral hoppy showcasing of a beer with a sweet finish definately not bitter at all and very easily drinkable."
"Skip this one and go straight for the Piraat."
"Not the typical taste you would expect from an IPA. This had a nice crispness to it. Lots of citrus going on but more like orange than grapefruit. And while the hop bitterness is present its not overwhelming, you get a lot of grassiness with this beer. This was unexpected in a good way. A nice beer to have while sitting on the patio in the summer."
"Edit: I've tried this since and was not as enamored. Still a wonderful beer, I'm looking forward to drinking it fresh in Belgium again."
"light to medium body, quite smooth throughout, with just touch of resins in the finish. prickly, spritzy carbonation is otherwise moderate but gives moments of fluffiness and is very refreshing."
"Drinkability: For a 7.5% Belgian with yeast hanging out in the bottom, this didn't hold up well. It doesn't seem to be a bad bottle either. Maybe this needs to be consumed fresh, but like I said, I thought it would at least be decent. Maybe I'll try and get a fresh one and re-review, but those of you who have it, I'd try it now if you're thinking of holding onto it, because it was an experience we all threw off my third floor balcony instead of finishing our small amounts in the glass."
"4.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"D: This was a pretty good beer. I was a bit underwhelmed by the lack of hops. There are definitely some better Belgian IPAs out there. If you can't find them, this is worth a try."
"Very good Belgian IPA, but it has strong style competition. The beer pours a bright hazy gold with an excellent, puffy white head that leaves good lacing. The nose is a very sweet aroma of candied lemons and subtle earthy Belgian yeast. While there is a strong hop presence in the beer, it's not the hoppiest BIPA out there. The malt contributes a flavor of wildflower honey. The hops are grassy, lemony and floral. It's an interesting flavor profile, but the beer doesn't quite grab me like some BIPAs. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, and it's a very easy beer to drink. I would love to have access to this stuff for cheaper."
"D - Good overall, but expected more hoppiness."
"ah, yea, um, if you drink beer, if you respect beer the journey through a bottle of popering's hommel is time and money well spent, this is a well balanced dynamic beer, has a tremendous sweetness of malt quickly broken by a soft bite of hop with fat bubbles confusing the complex blend of a malty sweetness for ale lovers and fantastic hop aromas and bite without ruination of palate for hop heads, a must at least once!twice and more!"
"Drinkable, smooth and easy."
"I went into this one knowing nothing of the beer and not knowing really what to expect. I poured up absolutely beautiful! Moderately cloudy yellow-orange body with a gorgeous, tightly knit, two inch thick head that stayed that way for several minutes. Exceptional head retention. Smell was mostly spices, some mild cooked fruit, and little else. Taste was heavy on the spice and had that metallic after taste ""thing"" that some Belgians have, but I really did enjoy it. Mouthfeel was ""medium"" and rather assertive on the CO2. This was a really good beer that I am very glad I discovered."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Hazy golden color with a large white crest of fine carbonation. Aroma is basic Belgian blonde with a nice hop influence. Typical banana and yeasty dough notes with a tart, citric character derived from the hops. Candied lemon and grass accents. Flavor is yeasty and biscuity with more lemon and grass. Also some phenolic character and a lightly bitter finish. Effervescent and pleasant mouthfeel, although a bit thin."
"Poured a 330ml into a chimay glass. Straw/hazy color with small lacing that disappears after 30 mins or so. Aroma is citrusy, yeasty spice, pear and lemon. Detected floral/earthy hoppiness. The taste in the beginning is tangy fruitlike flavors like pears, apples, lemon. Yeasty flavor comes towards the end with some peppery spiciness that has a touch of hops. Good carbonation and drinkable. Kinda mellow for my IPA taste buds but definitely will give another try."
"D: Drain pour. What a letdown."
"Drinkabiltiy is hurt by how cloying it is. Despite the atypical amount of hop flavor and bitterness (for a Belgian) this has a sweet, perfume kind of thing going on that doesn't necessarily keep you coming back. It's damn tasty for the first glass or two, though."
"On-tap at Raleigh Times served in a tulip glass a nice crisp straw yellow with a khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is slight hops and yeast with a touch of sweet fruits and spice. The taste is a nice dry sweet fruit presence with a nice amount of citrus hops. The beer has a nice dryness that along with the bitterness leaves you craving the next sip. This is a very refreshing, thirst quenching beer."
"The aroma is metallic and malty with plenty of grassy hops. There is also yeast and fruit. The appearance is cloudy gold with a large head and lots of particles in it. The flavor is astringent but like the aroma. The palate is thin. Overall it's not even average. I would not drink again."
"Looks much better than it ends up tasting. Have had this on tap, much better."
"M) Bottle conditioned, effervescent carbonation. YUM!"
"More like a hoppy Belgian pale ale. (and not even that hoppy.)"
"A very nice IPA, one that will enjoyed and preferred by those who don't like their IPA's to be overly bitter. Nevertheless, this is a very nice Belgian IPA and is much better on tap then it is out of the bottle."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer and I could drink a few, but it's not one that would select over too many others."
"Overall this is a tasty beer but I think it's about halfway in between a trippel and a Belgian IPA. The hops are there but not as crisp as I was expecting. Worth a shot."
"D - Notes of both wit and Belgian pale in this beer. Tasty."
"Drinkability: Smooth easy to drink. Pairs well with cheese not so good by itself."
"I bought this on a whim and had no idea it was a belgian IPA, I did not do my research and I am not disappointed!"
"D - You could have more than a few of these. great for the style. Really a solid offering."
"Drinkability is excellent, not so alcoholic, and the lighter nature of this beer, with its relative lack of fruity yeasty esters and less of that heavy sweetness, make it easy to quaff."
"The beer has a lingering, aromatic head. Smells beautifully floral. Hoppy, but without the bitterness- unique. Avec Les Bons Voeux comes close and is probably even better. Well, the beer is better overall, but the aroma isn't. The mouth feel is lovely. A good mousse- tiny bubbles, not big ones like in a carbonated drink, but like in a fine champagne, so you don't need to burp after a mouth full. This is a fine bottled beer, but peerless on draught. Truly, truly, one of the world's finest beers."
"Definitely different from the first bottle. Why? Recipe change? Wrong batch?"
"Pours a light golden yellow color with a thin white foamy head that quickly dissapears. Arom is kind of bland with hints of light crisp fruit and a strong alcohol presence. Carbonated up front, tickling the tounge with a sweet light crisp fruit center and dry alcohol warmth in the finish. Subtle hop and apple notes."
"A very drinkable beer. Very balanced and I love the sour flavors and aromas. Again, not as good as I've had in Belgium, but still a fine beer."
"This beer is amazing. It has the intangibles it needs to make it world class. There's not one thing about it that I can point out and say, ""that's awesome."" But the whole thing comes together and forms this... I might could drink this every day for the rest of my life. And I'm really not sure why."
"a pretty good abv and very smooth, Im glad i finally checked this one out"
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow gold in color with 2 fingers of pillowy white head that exhibits great retention and leaves behind lots of lacing. Great aroma, somewhat subdued in terms of intensity but very complex. There is some sweet malt, some herbal hop notes, a smattering of fruity esters and a slight phenolic presence. Taste is really quite good. Good herbal/earthy hop flavor, a moderate bitterness and a wonderful drying malt character that is present throughout. Yeast character is relatively restrained but characteristic light fruity esters and lightly spicy phenols are present. Good mouthfeel with a medium boy and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. I'm not really sure if I'd classify this as a Belgian IPA (then again maybe my bottle wasn't at its freshest) but this is one fine bier. This brew seems to transform with time from a hoppy IPA to a more mellow and balanced Belgian bier."
"Tasted on 7/18/08."
"D - Drinkability is good. Even though this isn't quite what I expected, it's still quite good. Flavorful, complex, fairly smooth...all things I look for in a good beer. Hops are just not there given this is an IPA of the Belgian variety. Recommended for the experience but I probably will not seek it out agian."
"D: Satisfying ale that showcases the fresh hops and wild yeasts of the Belgian countryside. It's not one I'd like every day, but it's an excellent sipper now and then. Near the top of the heap when it comes to the evolving 'Belgian IPA' style."
"d) Very drinkable, particularly if you have the time to see it change as it warms in the glass."
"D: Excellent, could've would've just didn't have another too swallow...definately will have again."
"Light body with a good amount of carbonation. A bit of yeasty flavor in the back end."
"D: A very nice version of the style, hoppy definitely compared to a Belgian Pale, but to other BIPAs, quite light. The flavours are real good, a definite re-buy."
"I had previously tasted the Poperings Nunnebier and saw this on the beer menu at a Philadelphia Belgian tavern. I decided to try it and was not disappointed. They served it from the bottle in the appropriate glass. It looked appealing with a nice frothy white head. Then I took the glass to my lips and the flavors took me a little by surprise. The first few sips were malty and slightly bitter. It took me about a half glass to get used to the originality of the flavor. I ordered a second one and then I was hooked. You should try it. it's an absolute delight."
"Poured from bottle into a tulip. Pours a very pretty light orange with an active white head. Smells of light citrus hops with some belgian doughey yeast. Definitely an ipa, but also definitely belgian. Taste is crisp and clean. Lots of sweet hop bitterness- some grapefruit and orange wit a spicy kick in there as well. Very crisp and very drinkable. Wish I picked up a few more of these."
"the drinkability is good, it's has a pleasant unique flavor."
"Drinkability is very decent. Not overwhelming. Could use some aging but if you have the time and money to do so. Check it out."
"Drinkability is very good, this is the benchmark Belgian IPA IMHO, a great balance of Belgian blonde character and assertive, fresh hops, in aroma and flavor and not just bitterness. To me, the definitive classic of the style, regardless of what Piraat may claim! Although I haven't had one of those in several years either, again, only on draught at the edge...will have to revisit soon. The main knock on the drinkability is the yeastiness, which gets a bit thick towards the end of the glass, which is not something I recall from draught."
"Mouthfeel is fairly average, though the slight carbonation make it interesting. Very drinkable beer overall; very refreshing and light compared to most of the other beers from the Watou area."
"D= probably a bit too stylish for my tastes other than having one, but I definitely having at least one to experience it."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"One of the most impressive-appearing beers I have seen. Served in a tulip, it was an orange color with a thick white head. There was a thin stream of carbonation that arose from the bottom of the glass, which persisted the entire time I drank the beer. Other than the kudos for the appearance, this beer was only a little bit above average. The aroma was vaguely fruity and floral. I thought the taste was mostly bread-like, with only a hint of hops. Pretty good beer, not very IPAish."
"Deep cloudy blonde appearance with a fuzzy head that retains pretty well. The aroma is somewhat phenolic with a minty kick to it. In the taste, it's not very hoppy at all. Sweet with some clove and other baking spices. Hmm, still not many hops to be found. It's a good beer, but it doesn't seem to be an IPA, even by Belgian standards."
"Weird mouthfeel - light and syrupy at the same time... sort of fizzy. Flowery hops come back, sweet pale malt and candy sugar tripel notes. Hard cider. Belgian yeast. Boozy warm finish. A hint of citrus rind, yeasty bitterness. Not bad, but not particularly IPAish."
"On tap at HopLeaf in Chicago. Pours amber and clear with a lasting hug whitish head on tap. Smell is lightly funky and belgian yeasty. Taste is dusty, floral, hoppy and saison like with a thinnish body and medium carbonation. Pretty flavorful, and not bad at all."
"Poured into a Unibroue Tulip glass with one finger of cream colored head. Dull gold appearance. Did not have a terribly strong smell but had a floral character. Not too many spices - just full-on hops. A good beer, I'm glad I got to try the hops from popering - but I am a bit disappointed. Not my favorite belgian IPA but worth a try."
"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into Harp 20oz pint glass. Sloth has gotten the best of me as I have yet to buy any kind of real glass wear. Massive spuming head rises immediately to the top of the 20 oz glass and sticks around quite a long time leaving great lacing. Beer pours a nice amber color. Nose is light hops, sweetness, very light malts. Slight iron taste initially on the tongue, followed by light sweetness and hop bitters. Nice overall mouth feel, and drinkability."
"Light. Worth a try. See what you think. Perhaps I got a bad batch."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is moderate and flavors are simple but unimpressive. Easy to consume, but lacking intensity."
"D: I had high hopes for this but it just didn't do it for me. I can't even honestly give it style points."
"Nice. Able to purchase a 12 and a 22 at Marty's in Newton, MA. Pours a dark golden, not copper, not amber, definitely a dark golden colour. Huge foam, had to wait for it to dissipate. Great aroma; malts and sweet grass, and noted a touch of honey/molasses. Excellent taste. Many undertones of citrus, slight malt, a grassy aftertaste. Light, excellent summer brew, and at 7.5% ABV not a killer, yet still able to deliver superb taste on several levels. Keeping this one on my short list."
"This is a great beer and it brings back awesome memories. Thats what it´s all about!"
"Notes: A bit torn about this one. It has its qualities but is fairly flawed overall."
"There was nothing really ""offensive"" about this beer, nor was there anything particularly memorable, except for that slightly metallic and earthy taste."
"Bottle poured into a Orval chalice. Body was a hazy golden color with a slight white head but solid lacing and ring on the edge of the glass. The nose had strong citrus and grapefruit, hop notes. The taste had strong hop and citrus notes up front as well. Grapefruit. The beer is well rounded and dry to the finish."
"Pours a very hazy straw colour and moderate head. Nose- sweet belgian candi sugar. Taste- very sweet. Residual sugars are noticable. Leaves a syrupy taste in the mouth Some bitterness in the finish. Mostly a super sweet tripel. Good desert beer. Drinkability is decent and carbonation is lower than expected."
"D: Not really."
"A golden yellow beer with a slight haze. Has a huge thick white head and nice sticky lace. The aroma is floral and herbal, reminded me dried herbs and flowers, with a light piney note in the background. The taste starts with a light grain malt character with hints of herbs tickling the sides of your tongue. The finish has a hint of piney hops and then goes down cool and refreshing."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong golden ale"
"With a taste comes a rush of fresh continental hops and yeast blended to grain flavors similar to fresh french baguette straight out of the oven. Caronation helps to a dry-feeling finish, making it very refreshing and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Not bad! Note to self: try it again sometime."
"I would consider this pretty drinkable and enjoyable. It reminds me of a good Belgian Strong Pale Ale more than anything else though. Not to take anything away from this great brew but if I want a Belgian IPA, I'll first reach for Houblon Chouffe."
"Great beer... try it."
"Serving Size: 330ml bottle poured into Poperings Hommel Ale glass."
"This is an excellent beer and IMHO, the benchmark of a Belgian IPA. I was surprised and delighted to see this on tap at many establishments in Belgium. I certainly imbibed quite a few!"
"Drinkability- Very even though it has a somewhat high ABV. I could likely drink a six of this if I was in belgium at the brewery."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with some head that leaves good lacing on the way down. Nose is very unique. Smooth and even sweet tone, though not over done. Mild yeast beneath all of it, though not overpowering it all. Flavor is totally odd. Not your typical of the style. Slightly sweet but with a bitter tone and a strong earthy tone that...hey...my palate just isnt experienced enough to be able to place. Slight alcohol invasion, though it is strong in a unique way. Dry edge and just totally interesting. If you want something different to try, this is one for ya. Id love to try this one again farther down my beer road."
"D: Not what I'd call refreshing in any sense of the word but this is still a well built and complex if a bit hoppy Belgian IPA."
"Body is medium, loosely carbonated and airey on the palate with a slippery, smooth texture. Decent but doesn't stand out to me."
"Pours a light, hazy golden amber -- saison color -- with a delicate white head that leaves some nice lace. The aroma is less forward with the hops than some Belgian IPAs and seems to straddle the line between that style and a highly hopped saison. Some sweet malts compose the base of the aroma, with some farmhouse yeast thrown on top, but the fruity-minty hops are a great topping. On the palate, smooth malts, expertly mixed with juicy, minty hops from the get-go, plus a wonderfully full bodied yeast element that grows into the mid-palate. The finish is active with hops and yeast, and envelops the palate in a blanket of fruit and herb flavors. Delicious. Mouthfeel is fully carbonated and nicely balanced between smooth malts and some rough residual hop oils. Overall, this is fantastic stuff. I don't think it's quite hoppy enough to be a Belgian IPA, but regardless of the category, this is a tasty, balanced, expertly executed brew. More, please."
"hazy pale golden with a really foamy white head that holds well and leaves tons of lace. smell is hoppy, but not as hoppy as i hoped. what did i expect from a belgian beer? perfumy, minty and lemony hops ride on a bready malt scent that is just barely sweet. sweetness is faint and smells like unripe pear and apple. hops are definitely the highlight here in the taste department. reminds me of herbal lemon mint tea riding on a majic pilsner malt carpet. just a hint of bitter in the finish, the medium body really feels medium because, unlike a lot of bpa's, this one is not supercarbonated, which usually gives the heavier beers a lighter feel. a nice beer, and certainly nothing ""wrong"" with it... this 750ml came in a nice tin with pictures of beer and hop fields on it. i just fear that i fell prey to marketing and picked it up for the tin, not it's reputation as a great great beer. fun to try, but i don't think i'll be revisiting this one anytime soon. give me a chouffe any day of the week."
"750 mL green, cork-n-crown bottle, best before A/4/08 - served in a tulip. The first pour reveals a translucent orangey/peach hue with lots of floaties, and it becomes more opaque with subsequent pours. The beer has medium carbonation and two inches of off-white head that deposits lace which would look better if the glass were spotless and if I weren't constantly swirling to take in the aroma. The components of which are wonderful noble hops (spicy/perfumy and green/piney notes) on top of subdued pale malts. On the palate, there is a toasty/bready malt base, but this is quickly overshadowed by a substantial perfumy/floral and piney hop dose, imparting a big bitterness that increases as it warms, but never overwhelms. There are also medicinal phenols, crisp green apple, and hints of cork on top of a nice, conditioned, medium-full body that has lively carbonation from start to end, and leaves a medium finish. I love these hopped-up Belgians, and this is a fine example that is worth revisiting at some point."
"D: I wouldnt have another but I can see it being better if categorized as a different style- the yeastiness was just too unpleasant."
"Not recommended."
"D - A nice beer - shame it's so hard to find as at $11 a bottle when found is pretty good here."
"Overall - An outstanding, and pretty different, Belgian IPA... recommended...."
"Awesome drinkability. As with most Belgians, the flavor is not very powerful or overpowering, but somewhat light and balanced. I will have to get more of this beer."
"The body and flavor are close to expectations but the hop presence just isn't there like I'd hoped. Again, as the glass shrinks the hops show more and more. I'd love a 750 of this. Still an excellent all around beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not the wow beer I was hoping for. Belgian IPAs can keep their tripel characters with a more generous dose of hops."
"Foggy golden orange. Beautiful color and a beautiful head too; tall and thick becoming clumpy around the edges and leaving generous lacing on the glass. Flowery, peppery hop aromas with a slight sugar cookie maltiness and yeast. The flavor is uncluttered...simple herbal hops, phenols, clean dry malts, honey and a well-rounded yeastiness. Some steely qualities here and there but no big deal. Smooth medium body...very mellow in many aspects, a little grassy in the aftertaste. Tolerably dry and moderately bitter. Laid back and very easy to drink."
"This was very easy to drink, and thirst quenching for a hot summer day. Recommended..."
"I have only had a few of the style but although different from my favorite American style these seem to have found a niche with me.Poured into a small tulip glass a hazed light golden with big blooming head leaving globs of lace as it settled very slowly.Big citrus notes in the nose very effervescent intertwined with some floral and yeasty tones very appetizing.Slightly phenolic(not something I really care for)and yeasty with a real herbalness and citric quality imparted from the hops good medium mouthfeel almost creamy in texture,it glides down quite easy and has nice hop flavors."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation, and a dry and slightly alcoholic finish. Really easy to drink a bunch of these. A nicely crafted IPA which is a bit of a rarity in Belgium."
"Overall, a very impressive brew. Very, very drinkable. I look forward to having more of this."
"D - Meh. This beer is lacking in flavor. It just strikes me as not being a full enough flavor - more like water with additives than a beer. I don't think I will have again."
"pours a cloudy golden color. small head. smells fruity, grassy. very ""earthy"". citrus. tastes a touch sour with grass/straw comming to mind. a little lemon here along with just the right amount of hops. first taste was a bit metallic, but this subsides. yeasty and just damn good. slick in the mouth, this is a fine brew. i am very impressed."
"Drinkability: Even though I'm pretty disappointed with this beer, it's still good. Certainly worth a try, but not worth all the hype, in my opinion."
"Poured into a Hommel tulip goblet. Pouring a nice light orangish cloudy color, with a nice thick fluffy white head. Smells of sweet malts and small notes of hops. It tastes fantastic, a bit sweet, hiding the alcohol notes with bitterness. I guess Belgium is on their way to IPAs!"
"D: Two would be tops for me on this one. Overall, a nice brew that is best taken in slow, minimal doses."
"Hazy murky golden middle with lemony edges and a tall, rocky, marshmallowy, bright white head. Very nice lacing. Spritzy lemons, lemongrass, sea air, sour brett-ish funk, honey biscuit malt, and yeast on the nose. Harkens to Orval. Soft, wheaty, fruity, lightly-sweet taste up front. Minty-herbal hops around the edge. Hop bitterness grows around traces of malty banana sugar. Funky hop finish with notes of sea air, vegetables, and Belgian yeast. Sparkly, active mouthfeel on a medium body. Not bad at all."
"Drinkability: If you can stand the initial metallic taste, drinkability is pretty good."
"This is a very nice Belgian. The hoppiness makes it a bit distinct from others of that country. Also a good balance of fruit and yeast. Pleasant if not the most fantastic beer. For the price I'd definitely buy it again."
"An absolutely wonderful, unique beer. Very glad Zot had this when I stopped in the other night."
" Nose is yeasty citrus with slightly earthy and hoppy notes. Taste is heavy malts and bread up front, followed by nice hoppy oranges and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is above average, and drinkability is good."
"Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. This beer has some massive head, incredible lacing, and is a gorgeous cloudy orangish apple cider color. It looks like a treat - very nice. Smell is complex - citrus (orange, lemon), some floral qualities, sour apple, and a little bit of bread. There is a very subtle citrus character in the taste along with nuanced hop notes along with a very nice dry finish. This is complex, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is crisp - there's lots of carbonation here, but it could use some more, maybe? I could drink a lot of this - a great beer. This is my first Belgian IPA review & I am totally impressed. Highly Recommended."
"Drinkable and completely forgettable. Maybe a bit past it's prime, but certainly not old. I'd give it a try again if I found a very fresh bottle or found it on tap."
"D: Off the chart! There are so many different and interesting flavors and aromas in this beer almost anyone can find something to love here. Seriously. All of the various layers of this beer compliment each other so well. This is Van Eecke's grandslam beer."
"Nice."
"Poured a cloudy and sediment filled hazy orange. Bright white rocky head that lasted to the end. Lively carbonation with tiny bubbles. Smells of sourish white grapes and a crisp grassy hop smell. Tastes like it smells but with a light metallic aftertaste. Very similar to Westvleteren Blond. Exceptional mouthfeel with the tiniest bubbles on tongue. Very drinkable and refreshing. Decent value compared to the Westy and more available too."
"Drinkability: A fine beer, nice balance bewteen ""Belgian"" flavors and hoppiness."
"Overall a fantastic ale. It's got all the qualities of a graceful Triple with a little less sweetness that's replaced by a multi dimensional hop ensemble that makes this ale sing. It's quite a simple and subtle hand on one hand yet very complex and ambiguous on the other. Whatever face it's wearing tonight, I'm in love with it."
"Drinkability: A complex and quite different Belgian ale; worth trying for sure"
"Overall this is not as good as some hoppy belgians (chouffe houblon, de ranke anything) but this still makes for a very enjoyable beer. Good profile the whole way round, just wish is was cheaper or had more balls, either or really..."
"Mouthfeel was fizzy with a body falling on the light side of medium. Very nice beer."
"This brew has a brilliant white head, filled with large bubbles, and a long-lived consistency. The beer has a clean and slightly sweet smell. I expected a more pronounced hop aroma, given the label. Theres certainly a little herbal and floral hop aroma, its just a little subdued. Theres a little citrus, yeast, and certainly a little caramel in the smell as well. The taste is clean, sweet, and a little peppery. Theres some yeast, and a little fruit as well. The spice and phenolic character stands out as you drink this brew. The finish is a little more hoppy than the rest of the brew, but theres not a lot of bitterness. This is an interesting and straightforward beer. The hops are restrained, but thats okay with me."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great."
"This beer has great drinkabilty despite its high alcohol content. Its pure Belgian, a beer to be sipped and enjoyed with each taste to be lingered on and pondered. I definitely want to try this one again before I return to the U.S., as where I live beer like this is damn hard to come by."
"Poured from the 330ml capped bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a slightly cloudy golden color with orange highlights, topped by a bubbly stark white head that recedes quickly, leaving a bit of pretty lacing in its wake. Aroma of sweet Euro malt, herby Belgian yeast, and spicy Euro hops. Notes of pineapple, grass, and a touch of clove peek through. Palate is mainly semi-sweet, lightly fruity pale malt, with a muted presence of Euro hops and a touch of grass hanging around somewhere in there. Body is substantial enough to firmly hold the alcohol content, but can be foamy on the swallow if you're not careful. I don't know, I guess I was expecting more out of this beer. Not bad, but not something I'll go for very frequently."
"A nice diversion from the norm, light and easy to drink, will enjoy more of these in the future."
"I don't know if this beer is just that much better on tap or if my palate was just happier making the adjustment from the Duchess to this vs. coming in clean, but I wasn't all that impressed. Despite the initial attack of alcohol and pine, it's pretty easy to drink, but the flavor doesn't really suit my tastes."
"Overall a drinkable, but not outstanding brew. I had expected more flavor and complexity from a Belgian. I would recommend giving it a try."
"well maybe not as great as I remember, but in any event this and watou triple are 2 great beers imho."
"More hops than I'm used to in a Belgian, and though I loved XX Bitter, I didn't take to this one quite the same. I'll definitely need to try another."
"The head is white and fairly thick, color is cloudy and brownish gray. The lacing is strong. The smell is fruity, sour, has apple, and a slight lemon, and wheaty body. Taste is a lemony sour that's not too sour. A little wheaty and a little bitter. Feels very carbonated and not too impressive. Overall it was OK to try, and I could get used to it, but it's too expensive to get used to it right now."
"The taste contained a little hop bitterness that combined with the sour yeast. Carbonation was light. I was expecting a little more of a punch with this strong belgian pale ale. Its an interesting, although maybe not great combination of flavors present in this pale ale. Wouldn't call it bad though, I would have it again."
"Overall I'm not too impressed with this ale. It's just a bit too...light, for my liking. It is a good beer, however, but far from the best."
"Yet another beer that gives me reason to hold the Belgians on a pedestal above all others. And one of the more unusual ones, considering it's very hopped up yet also a few steps left-of-center from the typical hoppy beers we know and love."
"250 ml bottle, bought in Frederikshavn, Denmark. Slightly hazy pale golden colour, large head. Nice hoppy aroma, some yeasty and wheaty notes too, hints of citrus and pineapple. Flavour has dominant hoppy notes but not much else, relatively tart and bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden, a refreshing beer despite its strength."
"This a beer that is very drinkable even with a high ABV."
"Poured from bottle to a hazy yellow-orange with thick white head that lingered with good lacing throughout the glass. Aroma was a mix of floral and clover, with hints of fruit, maybe oranges. Taste somewhat spicy at first, and the 7.5% alcohol was well hidden. As beer warmed at mid-glass, taste became more honey sweet. Had a good finish. Surprisingly good, smooth, tasty beer."
"Cool stuff, maybe not worth $3.50 per bottle when I can get a more flavorful St Bernardus Tripel at that price. But nice anyway."
"Drinkability: Top-notch; great Belgian flavors, but the dry hoppiness removes any cloying sweetness or syrupy heaviness. Liked it."
"The mouthfeel smooths as it warms a bit, lots of body for a pale and a fair amount of alcohol that warms gently. Very easy to drink and a solid Belgian strong pale ale that's a treat, for sure!"
"Very, very crisp and peppery-dry (is that a hint of cumin?), this makes a nice quaff along side moules and a a well-spiced steak frites. There's an awful lot to like about this beer."
"Another beer purchased in Belfast ME. Pours hazy orange/brown color with a thick head that vanishes slowly/ Smells a bit citrusy. Tastes quite different like dried fruit, hops, a bit of citrus. A lot less sweet than I've had from other Belgians. Mouthfeel is pretty good, a little thin but not watery. Overall a very enjoyable and differnt tasting Belgian Ale. Only $1.99 a bottle, must get more soon."
"Clean and refreshing. Quite impressive. This is consistently one of my favorite Belgian ales, whether from a tap or bottle."
"D - Goes down easily, but I'd choose several other beers in the style first. I'll try it again at a later date."
"The mouthfeel was bitter and dry at first and faded into a watery and bland feel. Mild carbonation at first and none later. Takehome message: this ended up bitter and very sour. Therefore, drinkability was kinda limited."
"Poured nicely into tulip glass. Nice 1"" head, stuck around for a while--HUGE bubbles! Pleasant orange color. Aroma was nearly non-existant. Good mix of citrus and spices, just a light, flavorful touch. Interesting and sour mouthfeel. A good beer, nothing great or special though. Worth a try, easy drinking."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"This beer pours a semi hazy orangish yellow color with a medium foamy head. Moderate lacing and head maintains quite well. Aroma is Belgian spices and bitter flowers. Some yeast funk for sure. Citrus and honey round it out. I can tell I'm going to enjoy this beer. Taste follows suit. I get some of those bitter estery hoppy flavors right away. They maintain themselves nicely and provide a good balance to every other flavor that comes and goes. English toffee, pears, grapefruit, bananas, cloves, yeasty funk. It seems to come in that order and the flavors will mix and then one gets cut out. Alcohol comes towards the end and drives right through the hops and yeast. Nice little acidic finish rounds out the experience. This beer has a semi-bitter but moreso hoppy base and sweeter flavors on top until the end. I really enjoyed it and could drink quite a few of these in succession."
"Medium body. The carbonation gives it a lively mouthfeel. Exceptionally drinkable. I would like to do a side by side with this and La Fin du Monde. Highly recommended."
"750ml caged and corked (watch those eyes)."
"Very Wit Beir'ish. I smell and taste citrus and corriander mixed a nice hoppy taste. Full head that lasted through half the beer and then dissapated to a nice ring around the rim with a fine lace across the top. There is a lot to this beer and I am happy I have tried it. Definitely worth another look or two!"
"From notes. Poured a brilliant copper color with a 2 finger head that sat nicely over top of the beer through the drink. Nose was spicey noble hop over a light spun sugar and caramel sweetness that I thought really worked well together. Flavor was light orange cirtus and spun sugar sweetness with a solid balance of herbal and spicey hop. Excellent balance and very clean. Feel was moderate with an amazingly fine carbonation that led to a silky smoothenss that I really liked. I found drinkability to be excellent. Balance was great and the noble hop character really worked well in this one. I'd like to see more hoppy beers made with this hop profile."
"Surprised that it's taken me til now to try this brew. A perfect summertime refresher. A lot of bold Witbier-like flavors with the wheat, corriander, orange, lemon, and buble-gum flavors and soft, velvet-ey texture. All this with that Belgian tart twant. Lightly sour, musky, earthy, and spicy. Much complexity for such a smooth and easy drinking beer. Very clean and crisp. I'll be drinking this one often."
"The taste is fine, not as good as I remember but better than the smell woul indicate. Hopefully I can have this on draft again soon (Lucky Baldwin's Belgian Beer Festival?)."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Goes down easy and keeps me coming back for more. I wouldn't complain if this was produced in 750ml bottles! A hoppy Belgian brew that's well worth tracking down and trying."
"Get this now, if you even just remotely like BPA's. Wicked good, and shows Belgian-style brewers not to fear the hops."
"With this beer, it seems that the hops serve mostly to provide bitterness rather than flavor. This is fine, since the Belgians are rather adept at dosing their brews with all manner of interesting and harmonious flavor elements. In the case of Poperings Hommel, I'm glad to see that Van Eecke has managed to combing strong, focused bitterness with fruit, spice, and a lingering sweetness, resulting in a most enjoyable, ever-evolving beer."
"out of the bottle, pours a pale golden orange in color with a good thick lasting rocky head, a little meringue-like. good Belgian hops in the nose, like Orval. crisp hops in the mouth but not bitter. Belgian yeast, alcohol, and a drying finish. light and quick mouthfeel leaves a little lacking, but a good and very unique Belgian beer."
"11.2 oz bottle pours a hazy orange color with a nice off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Flowery, citrus aromas, citrus, honey and pear flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and smooth mouthfeel, finishes dry with some bitterness, very drinkable for the alcohol content."
"Middle of the road Belgian Ale. Pours out to a foggy golden color with a large white foam head. Good lacing in the glass. Higher level of carbonation. Aromas of sweet grain and clove, with a touch of lemony citrus. Nice. Taste was well balanced; starts off with flavors of dry malts, followed by a massive presence of spice and hops. Finished slighlty sweet and smooth. Mouthfeel was good, but could've had more ""umph"" to it, for lack of a better term. Drinkability was around average. Not bad. Worth a try."
"All together a very good beer if you like hops!"
"330 ml bottle. This beer pours out brownish yellow with a dense, rocky head. The aroma is sweet and malty with yeast and lemon zest. The flavor is somewhat malty with a sweet candy taste. Fruit and spice come in to give this beer a delicious, complex flavor. Very hoppy for the style. Mouthfeel is medium. This beer is really addictive. I would love to try this on tap."
"D: overall, despite its softer aroma than the bottled version, this well-balanced hoppy blond ale is excellent on tap. Refreshing, quaffable, yet also complex and flavoursome. Extremely drinkable!"
"Got this as a subsitute at no extra charge. Best before date 04/06. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange. There's a nice fluffy white head, tons of lacing afterwards. Scent is of sweet hops, The taste is sweet with a slight bitterness aftertaste. Light to medium body. This is an exceptioinal ale with a great drinkability factor."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber, huge head forms, lots of lace. Smell is sweet and malty, spices, hope and orange peel. The taste is malty and spicy, lots of hop presence, clean bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty full, nice carbonation, very smooth and dry. Tasty beer, one to try."
"Hazy peach colour tiny, yeasty particles throughout. This was topped by a fluffy, bright white head that settled quickly and produced plenty of lace. Complex aroma, quite malty and slightly vinous with a bit of apple fruitiness. Lemony citrus also added some depth, along with floral hops and a distinct yeast character. The bitterness was balanced slightly on the high side and became one of the dominant components in the finish. Still, there's some sugary sweetness and spice, but overall the flavour was quite mild. Along with bitterness, the off-dry finish had a nice peppery character. Moderately light body with some residual sugar that gave it a syrupy texture. Carbonation was on the high side and was maintained throughout. A tasty Belgian, fairly mild overall and surprisingly hoppy. Definitely one to try. Thanks Viggo!"
"This beer came in 330 ml. brown bottle with a notched in best by date of April 2006. After popping the cap, I immediately noticed how active the carbonation was, as the beer formed a head in the bottle neck! After pouring in an oversized wine glass, the head was tall and crowning similar to Duvel, with the underlying beer clear golden pale amber in color but clouded up after the yeast introduction. The aroma was rather mild with sweet fruity malt (banana, peach), sugar, earthy yeast, and spicy and floral hops. The taste was exactly as initially indicated by the nose, with the malt, sugar, yeast, and hops in a delicate balance. Taste was like a concentrated witbier with above average level of hops. Celery and pepper like spicy hints in the aftertaste. Alcohol was quite well hidden, which made it much easier to drink than most other 7.5% ABV beers. A subtle and sneaky pleasure, well suited for a hot summer day."
"Tasted like it smells with a hint of hops but well balanced with the spiced fruitiness and a bit of a grain/dry finish. Killer. This would be a great daily type beer. Its complex enough to keep your interest time and time again. Very smooth . No harshness whatsoever. Like most imports the price can be too much for daily consumption at 3.50 for a 11.2 oz bottle. Highly recomended if you can find it."
"large bottle caged and corked, that my wife returned from Belgium with, nice job. This one opens with a burst of energy and pours with the same spirit. Spritsy and livley. Light apricot in color and yeasty cloudy. The large head is snow white, dissolving to a thick film and leaving fine but slippery lacing. Nose here is citrusy and maybe a hint of pepper. this is a fine, yeasty, lemony, tasty and lively brew. Fruity and crisp up front and then balanced by citric drying hops, yum. Fine summer sipper. well worth a try."
"Note: the label for English-speaking Europe says Poperings Hommel Beer (as apposed to hommel ale shown in BA picture), otherwise the same label."
"Poperings Hommel Bier is different and is a better beer for it. The hops play a much more prominent role than they do in most BSPAs. Of course, to a hophead, that means that it's in perfect balance. I had a good time with this one and will be sure to look for it again."
"This would be a perfect hoppy saison, actually. Yum. Mouthfeel is great. Carbonation doesn't interfere, and the initial smoothness is very deceptive with regards to carbonation. Drinkability should go down because of high alcohol content, but, really, this is a marvellously enjoyable brew. Three hoorah's for Belgium's hoppy beers!"
"Pours a dark golden color that never seems to settle, with a generous head. Smell is tasty like grapes and a touch of sweet fruits. The taste is also really pleasant... hoppy is the best way to describe it. There is also a touch of sourness like grapefruits or wine. Even though it is paler than most belgians, it is really enjoyable and easy going. There is a slight peppery sensation at the very end of the beer that really makes it nessisary for another sip!"
"this beer pours from the tap into a proper glass looking all golden yellow.. clumpy settled wispy foam.. layers and layers of sticky lacing are present before i have a chance to drink and it's not going anywhere. almost no carbonation in this beer.. still appears beautiful in the chicago sunlight. smells sweetly malted with candi sugar. very belgian. the famous belgian hops don't come through in the nose but provide a nice bitter twang in the flavor. the hops help to counteract a tart lemon and heavy blonde maltiness. this beer finishes smooth, nice for the afternoon.. mild lingering bitterness is nice for something called 'poperinge'."
"This is rather nice. It probably won't appeal to a Belgian beer newbie, as it's a little too sharp tasting for someone whose only experiece is with, say, Duvel (not knocking Duvel, its just a little easier on the palate than this). Though it will never replace St.Bernardus Abt. 12 as my all-time favorite Belgian beer, I quite like it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabilty: Not bad. Wouldn't mind having another."
"D- This is a nice peppy beer. It doesn't have a lot of bold fruit flavors but the multiple flavors are faint compared to the spiciness. I would like to see a hint of malt or alcohol round out this beer and give it a little more depth."
"Got the chance to try this beer on tap at the Map Room in Chicago, which presented the beer in its own glass (nice touch). This hazy, golden ale had a wonderful, bright white, delicate head of foam with lots of facing, and an intense herbal aroma that was hard to describe -- a combination of smells, some mint, some woody hop spice, maybe even a slight hint of eucalyptus(?) -- it actually reminded me of the the combination of smells that indundate the sense whenever I walk in the the apothecary shop my wife likes to visit. I almost enjoyed the aroma more than the flavor of this beer; I couldn't keep my nose out of my glass. The flavor of this beer echoed the aroma in some respect, lots of sort of vaguely herbal flavors, backed up by a crisp maltiness, but nothing that I could really pin down. I like this sort of complexity in a beer. The mouthfeel was absolutely silken and the body was just about right. Overall, a very drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ale that would have downed faster if hadn't been for the wonderful aroma."
"Overall, I thought this beer was a little better than average but not deserving of some of the more enthousiastic previous reviews."
"11.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a very light copper color with three heaping fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is very spicy and very hoppy. Lots of pepper and even some funk under a bed of hops. The taste is very odd. Some spices stick out, like pepper and ginger. Then there's the hops, which give it a good amount of bitterness. There's a touch of funk to the taste as well on the finish. It's very complex. The mouthfeel is frisky on the tongue, with good carbonation and thickness. The drinkability is good for a 7.5% brew as well. A unique beer that everyone must try at least once."
"I could spend paragraphs just describing the funky shriveled white morel head that floats upon the surface of this hazed ginger juice, but I'll spare the casual reader--if there happens to be one--and store the image in my special place. A delicate bouquet of jessamine lollypops, honey and rich fruit cream-based desserts fill the nose before the velvety liquid washes across the tongue bringing a wave of maple sap supped from Autumn leaf. Soothing and sensual and now a clot of foam has dislodged from the liquid to adhere on pint sides and I think there is something furry morphing inside it."
"Nice foamy head. Slightly floral aroma. Juicy chewy Yeasty medium mouthfeel. Nice Belgian pale. Nice Belgian anything. Sweet more than bitter, I like lemon. Drinkable. Satisfying way to Clean the palate. Could have another sometime. Thanks Radek for sharing. Had again ontap at Monk's, it was ust as good, more yeast in taste."
"I could drink this all night and I think after I bought the case BLIND today at the beer yard, I'm not going to be shy about hitting several of these up tomorrow on Xmas eve!!"
"Drinkability- May have to try another one of these to make sure I didn't get a bad one. Otherwise, a decent beer with a bit of an odd taste."
"The 7.5% abv was non existent. Scary drinkability that was only hindered by the sweetness. Great job!"
"This beer poured a clear, golden amber color with white foam that settled to a steady film that coated the glass. The smell was fruity and spicy and malty. The taste was sweet and sugary with some spice (coriander?), a bit of hoppiness, and a good malty backbone. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and modest carbonation. The aftertaste was hoppy with a sweet fruitiness. This was an interesting beer."
"A beer from which you can drink more then one and always a good choice in a bar! Not having the absolute hoptouch though wich it gives on the label!"
"Darkish cloudy organe in color with a pillowy off-white head and a persistent lace. Light spiciness to the nose with a fruity, citric hop boquet. Moderate-full in the mouth, slightly creamy in texture but well-carbonated. The pale malt has a restrained fruitiness which emerges with warmth. Mid-palate develops a slightly bready character which, when combined with the spicy finish, gives this beer just the slightest hint of a gingerbread cookie character. Nicely bitter finish, spicy hops with hints of orange peel. A fine beer."
"Medium in body and seems to grow as it warms. It's a bit gooey towards the finish, though its airy otherwise. Nonetheless, this is a fine, drinkable ale with a good amount of flair."
"Taste: Went down really crisp, with a little coriander and maybe cumin, and a great, dry hop finish. If you like IPAs, and I do, chances are you'll enjoy this one. It's different, and it's good."
"4yr old 750mL. Pour is a cloudy golden with champaign effervescence and an eternal foamy and rocky white head. Sediments float around. Truly beautiful. Spicy aroma(cloves), yeasty, fluffy with tones of tangerine, herbs, must. Very aromatic. Gentle warming sensation in the belly. Malt is toasty, biscuity, honey-sweet. Moderate bitterness from the beautifully mellowed poperinge hops. Awesome rich mouthfeel, totally silky, velvety, luxurious. Very elegant belgian ale."
"This beer is very hoppy but also no hop tea, it has a lot of malt characteristics to back it up. It has a smooth balanced aftertaste. Very enjoyable and worth trying for sure."
"Three inches of creamy-white foam top a hazy, orange-gold (almost peachy) beer. The head collapses hillily and leaves psycho, clumpy coral. Nose is spicy, soapy, citrusy. Front is citrusy and buttery, leading to a metallic, soapy, fizzy middle. Finish is dry, metallic, bitter, buttery and alcoholic. With temperature, this really blossoms: more buttery and malty, fruitier with a really nice creamy finish. Interesting: full of character. Good, but not incredible."
"Very drinkable Belgian Brew."
"Pours a cloudy golden ale color with a good sized white head. Aroma is a nice blend of sweetness and light oily hops. Some orange notes- sweet citrus. Flavor is a hoppy, slightly bitter feel, pine-like, this is about the hops. They aren't overpowering, but they are the main point of this beer. Some bitter citrus notes. Quite enjoyable, and quite unlike most Belgians. I have had this on several occasions, and I note that sometimes I like it, and sometimes it does not grab me. I think this one is either an aqcuired taste, or is very sensitive to one's mood/conditions when trying it. But i do recommend it, if you can find it."
"Pours a lightly hazy gold color, and is topped by an off white head. Quite a floral aroma, with notes of various herbs and spices, all of which seems to be hop derived. The beer is sharp and bitter, with herbal grassy hop notes in the flavor. I get notes of bergamot, hay, and a hint of honey in the finish. It is like a Belgian IPA. It is light bodied with lots of good hop character. Definitely a tasty beer."
"I was highly impressed with this beer. I had it on tap at Monks in Philadelphia and brought home a couple of bottles to try. If the bottles drag down the score, Ill come back and rerate. The aroma is strongly floral, its like gardenias minus the sickeningly sweet aspect. Theres a good bit of orange fruit mixed in and a lingering bitterness in the finish. The color is a cloudy yellow/orange with a stiff white head."
"Overall Impression: This is the fifth beer out of an 8-pack. Two of them so far have been a bit skunky. Not sure why because they are in brown glass. It's a good beer, though. And a great love-letter to the flavor of the hop. Sort of ""real-ale""-ish!"
"A fine dense head on a beautiful scintillating golden copper color. The smell is very hoppy and medicinal, with hints of weed. The taste reveals the floral aspect of the hops, very thick, but that leave a dry finish. Yeasty, the beer doesn't have the sweet notes that are often found in strong pale ales. Light hints of citrus too. The hops are very persistent in the mouth, but in an interesting way. A remarkable brew."
"This is a very good brew, reminding me of a hybrid between a Lambic and a Belgian Golden. The cardboard and tannins hurt its drinkability, however it's still quite enjoyable. This seems more properly labeled a Lambic, as it tastes spontaneously fermented."
"750, poured at Delirium Cafe in Brussels. This is a nice golden colour with a big fluffy head of white foam. Aromas are excellent and consist of freshly cut, medicinal/herbal hops, light, bready malts, and other belgian yeasts, sugars, and spices. The taste is hoppy up front with a nice malt precense on the back of the tongue, and a medicinal finish that is herbal yet not astringent. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is very, very good!"
"Hazy peachy-honey hue, the white head was rocky and massive, it reached an apex of two and a half fingers in height. The head was a solid as concrete; it took a long moment to fade to half of its peak height. The subsequent lacing was minimal, that is disappointing. Visually this is an impressive ale. The aromas are very lively, pears, apples, a hint of fig, raisins, orange zest, lemon grass, and a pinch of pepper. The nose is impressive and inviting. The palate seems a bit lackluster in comparison to the bouquet. It needs to be noted my bottle is a few years old (best by: 01/02) and maybe the hoppiness has died a little. The remaining flavors are pleasant; it just lacks oomph. It is very dry, like Orval, with pear fruitiness, apples too. A little bit of lemon grass in the middle, some candy sugar sweetness, and a hint, just a hint of bread. The alcohol punch supplies some flavor and a little warmth to the belly. The aftertaste is a dull mix of sweetness and pepper. This is a tasty beverage, it seems to be a little under reviewed and under appreciated. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin and ordinary, the carbonation is big and full, as to be expected, medium in body. This is also highly drinkable and quite devilish considering the abv of 7.5%. The legend of Duvel strikes again! I wish I could find this beer locally; I purchased this 11.2-ounce bottle in Iowa City. I want to try a fresher bottle in the future, this one has aged very gracefully but Id like to do a comparison."
"Drinkability is high eve though I can't really place this beer in specific style."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Golden in color, with a billowy, large bubble head that settles slowly, leaving a weak lace. Aroma is of citrus, light hops, and fruity esters. Taste is quite hoppy for a belgian, with strong, traditional, belgian-hop flavor that lingers throughout. Malt base is sweet. Overall, I'm quite pleased. Coming from the hop capital of Belgium, I didn't expect this brew to be so well balanced."
"Far from straightforward, a European beer this hoppy is strange to taste, especially when it is hoppy in an American way, yet its yeast and malt backbone are undeniably Belgian. Phenomenal with food, for me its always a great pick at Monks Cafe."
"Bottle - Light orange brew with a huge white head. Retention is standard. Good carbonation with a complex spicy aroma. Taste of hops is really present with good body. Taste of complex spice is really enjoyable. Overall, a really fine strong belgian brew."
"Drinkability: great drinkability even though it is a sweeter beer. i enjoyed it."
"Honey gold color, slightly hazy. Small white head, with very small carbonation. Aroma is sweet, citrus, bubble gum and yeasty. A medium bodied Belgian strong ale. Malts are fruity and very yeasty. Hops are spicy. This is a very dry ale. Has a sort of champagne like quality to it. The yeasts and the carbonation are the major focus of this beer. A touch of alcohol bite. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Never having this before, I figured I would try the Belgian beer labelled as ""a pale with plenty of hops"". The beer was a cloudy orange color with a wispy head. There was a great floral aroma with some citrus lingering around. The first taste blew me away, with the fine balance of sweetness and bitterness. Both lasted pleasantly on the tongue for a while, and then mellowed slowly away. My second taste seemed even better as my brain was realizing this is an incredibly perfected hopped Pale Ale. This is a must try on tap for anyone that can find it. I had two, which eliminated another Belgian selection for the evening, but I didn't care."
"Poperings; the region in Belgium where they grow hops. This beer [dated best before 09/03] should be pretty good for a connoiseur of IPAs and other hoppy styles as well as Belgian lovers. Only expect Belgian in the mix of the flavors, hence its roots. Malty, yeasty, hoppy, and musty all describe this beer. Clear and orangy pilsener gold color with a puffy, rocky white head that lasts in the tulip glass. Very lemony, peppery, vinous aroma. Once the entire contents, sediment and all, is in the mix, the color becomes a hazier orange hue. The hops are beautiful in this beer; zesty and zippy and I think they are subsued so well by the offset of the malt. Blood orange sweetness interlaced with a gingery dryness that leaves you wanting the next sip... I've had this beer on draft and in the bottle. One of my favorite Belgian ales. I miss it being on draft."
"A nice Belgian in every sense. The nice balance of hops and grain combined with the definite presence of the belgian yeast creates what is the prototype for this style. Huge bready aroma and bubbly palette, it finishes rather nicely with dry bite. I would recommend this one to anyone who is just starting to get into Belgians."
"Gotta throw out some props to LongBeachBum for sending this one my way though. Thanks."
"thanks to PintofAle, big thanks!"
"Hazy gold with yeasty bits floating about, it pours with a relatively light head compared to some other Beglians. In addition to some pleasant fruit aromas and some spice, hops are quite assertive. A nice apple/pear flavor asserts itself up front, with the hops again making their presence known, along with that funky Beglian musty flavor. The mix is a bit surprising but comes together well. It really fills the mouth and drinks easily for the style and abv."
"Appears a golden tone with an orange tint along with a huge white foamy head. For a Belgium I must say there is a very full floral hop aroma mixed with spices and hints of the belgium yeast used here. I am falling in love with this beer with each sip, Taste is a perfect balance of flavors going on with herbal spices, and musty yeast tones and the sweetness characteristic of most belgiums mixed with tones of caramel, finished off with a healthy amount of hop bitterness. Medium bodied beer that dances on the palate, with a high carbonation leaving a smile on my face. Drinkability is amazing just watch out for this one at 7.5 it could get you without even noticing."
"Medium body and lovely mouthfeel. Extaordinarily easy to drink and the most dangerous beer i have ever had the pleasure of drinking."
"Brilliantly clear golden hue when decanted off the yeast. Effervescent, champagne esque, prodigious streams of bubbles support a sea foam like thick, billowy, airy, white head that collapses slowly into a rugged, stiff layer that leaves dense, muddled lace. Sweet, ripe pear and tangerine esters upfront in aroma, followed by mildly earthy hops and must. Granny Smith apple acetaldehyde adds a tart contrast. Sugary honeydew and mellow alcohol spice emerge as the beer breathes. Enticingly aromatic, unique, yet soft on the nose. A pleasure to inhale. Mild honeyish sweetness is perceived at first in flavor then is ensued by a combination of sugar dusted lemon and juicy melon. Sweetness is then tapered by both mild hop bitterness and drying, peppery ethanol. Subtle floral, and ripe fruit melange mid palate lends a perfume laced sweetness. Light in body, and perhaps a bit underwhelming on the palate. Very well attenuated, perhaps due to the copious use of sucrose. Hop and fruit character fades late, leaving an lingering extension of simple residual sweetness to fill the near void. Finishes sweet, thin and lightly peppery. Hommel is a unique, enjoyable brew that starts out rich and multi faceted in character, but slowly peters out to finish lackluster. Nonetheless, taken altogether this is a fine beer well worth a try."
"A fine looking nebulous golden orange color on the pour, the head is modest, creamy and an off white in color, the lace left behind a nice coating on the glass, with lots of dross floating around in the beer. Yeast quite evident, somewhat sweet and sour, vinous is the nose, start is sweet, thickly malted, top is middling in feel to the palate. Finish has a delicate acidity, the hops delightful in their spicy bite, dry somewhat bitter aftertaste, a quite quaffable beer."
"Pours a cloudy, hazy yellow, with a big fluffy head that settles to a good 1/2 inch, then slowly fades to a 1/4 inch. The lacing is thick, and barely leaves any glass showing. Very slight aroma of sweet fruits and spices. The first sip is creamy, very smooth. The carbonation produces an unbelievable amount of tiny bubbles, enticing on the tongue. Creamy mouthfeel, with a hoppy, spicey finish that suits me quite well, thank you. A ""hoppy"" Belgian; very different, very good, very drinkable. As always, much better as it warms."
"Pours with a thick frothy head matched with a cloudy gold texture. The grassy odor is strong, you could smell this from miles away. Wow! This was a lot smoother than I anticipated. It's hard not to appreciate the delicate balance of malt and unique hops. It finishes sugary yet not too sweet. Absolutely a fantastic brew."
"Pale straw color. White as a ghost head and lace. The head is lasting as as well as its lace effects. Pungent hop light malt nose. Medium mouth. Upfront smack you in the face malt taste which is followed by a wave of crispy light hop flowers on the tongue. This is a very hoppy belgian. Since it is made in the hop growing area of belgium (Poperings) I would consider it their tribute to the hops... well maybe.. anyway it is wonderful and has a persistant hop presence. It is very drinkable and with its medium body and well rounded flavor I could drink them all day..."
"Drinkability & Notes: First off this gets to be a Beeradvocate Pick. This is an odd ball of the bunch as far as Belgians go being the amount of hop character that is there, I for one love it. Last trip to Belgium I quaffed many of these in Antwerp and could not get enough."
"Not heavy or alcoholic tasting, there is a finely drawn outline of dusty spices, especially white pepper, that surrounds Red Delicious apple, citrus pith and parsley flavors. As it warms, honey stones, pie crust, baked apples and dried apricot flavors emerge. The finish is incredibly long and leans in a dry, herbal direction as it suggests peppery Nasturtium flowers and kind bud. Terrific stuff."
"A great ""Beer Ambassador"" for the hop-growing area within  West Flanders. I find I prefer it on draft - if you ever get chance, try it from the tap, deep in its homeland at the Palace Hotel in Poperinge, then have a hop-flavored Genever to finish with."
"A light golden haze in color with a smell of spices. But after my first sip I tasted carmel with a pleasant balance of sweetness and bitterness together. The bitter after taste was not overpowering. I would try this beer again!"
"This beer poured a nice light golden color and formed a nice white head that left some nice lace. A lot of carbonation that is common in this style.   An aroma of citrus and hops.  A taste of hops and citrus with some foamy aspects probably due to the carbonation.  Not a bad beer, but the finish could be better."
"Sweetish at the start with bitter hoppiness at the finish, i kind of liked this beer, very drinkable especially at 7.5% alc, bit of added spice in there aswell."
"A rare, hoppy Belgian beer. Sweeter than an Orval and stronger at 7.5%. Liken this to a hoppy triple, but easier to drink and more refreshing. Poperings is a hop region and this brew is obviously blessed by its local hops. The area is known for its role as one of the largest battle fields in the World Wars (so I was told when in Belgium)."
