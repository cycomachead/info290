"One of the hoppier Belgian IPA's out there. Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into my Grape and Gourmet store tulip. Hazy apricot color with a big delicately bubbly white head. Head retention is better than average and the head looks more frothy after the bubbles die down.  Aroma is citrus and  floral hops, not much in the way of Belgian beer aspects.  Flavor adds some Belgian yeast and some light fruit to the big hoppy presence.  The yeast is fairly prominent and adds the ""Belgian"" to the Belgian IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp, bitter and fairly rich.  Overall, an interesting and well crafted beer."

"Overall: Delicious! Feels substantial in every way. Hop profile is like an American Pale Ale, and it goes well with the Belgian style yeasts. Gives it more depth."
""
""
"Very well balanced with a great level of complexity"
""
""
"Nice ruby/orange hazy coloring with a huge head of tight aromatic bubbles. Fair amount of citrus and melon in the aroma. More citrus, a touch of pine, marshmallow, and pith in the taste. Moderate carbonation yet slightly creamy mouthfeel. Some yeasty funkiness in this but not as much as I expected, well done overall beer."

"a hazy blonde body on this brew. head is bright white and HUGE. a lot of citrus in the aroma. really inviting. flavor starts with some earthy yeast bitter-bite. quickly moves to a refreshing citrus and pine hop flavor. getting some melon in there too. really tasty stuff."

"Not a review, but wanted to clarify the chemical structure on the bottle. Believe that it is Humulone. More information is found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humulone. Cortisol also has C21H30O5, but the structure does not match what is printed on the bottle. Nice play on ""Hugh Malone Ale"" (http://hughmalone.com/)."

"O: I've been meaning to try this one for awhile, and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this one--Belgian IPA seems to be a style with a lot of range, and this one was fruitier and smoother than many others I've had. I'll definitely have it again when it's on tap or when I come across a bottle."
"O - This was a great surprise. I tend to not like the Belgian flavor profiles to be strong, particularly the banana notes. This however was more restrained, and the biterness made a nice balance with the sour/sweetness. I wouldn't mind seeing an Imperial Belgian IPA with some more hop and ABV."

"O- Not exactly one of the best things Allagash has ever done, nor is it one of the best Belgian IPAs I've ever had, but it's good enough to make me want to revisit it if given the chance."

""

"Overall: an intense beer that the flavors are a bit too intense for me. The dryness eats right up the rest of the flavor"

"Allagash has yet another great beer with the Hugh Malone. Appearance resembles the Allagash style with moderately cloudy, but very nice color (Deep Orange) The smell was very good, but not outstanding. Taste was the best part of this beer. I was very surprised with the citrus mixed with a little bit of pine taste. The Belgian yeasts adds that nice Belgian flavor and keeps you coming back. Not a session beer but a very enjoyable beer. I highly recommend."

"O: A nice Belgian IPA from Allagash. Plenty of hops in there, so it's probably better off drank fresh. If you've got some extra cash and enjoy the style then pick some up"

"Allagash is one of those breweries that never disappoints. While Hugh Malone is far from their strongest release, it is a nice Belgian IPA. The alcohol flavor’s a little strong, but that’s the only real complaint I have. Pretty solid all-around otherwise. Worth checking out for sure."

"750 ml bottle, 2012 version, served in a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy, golden yellow color with a thick, frothy white head. Aroma is pale malts, straw, citrus hops, dried fruits, and spicy/peppery yeast. Flavor is bread, pale malts, grapefruit, peach, and spicy yeast. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp, and a slightly bitter finish. Good beer."

"Mouthfeel is good- medium light body, moderate carbonation, semi dry finish. Glad I tried it but not something I'd seek out."

"A 750 ml bottle from 2012 poured into a pint glass. This year's version clocks in at 7.3% ABV. This beer is highly carbonated providing a big time dense white fluffy head that has big time staying power. Clear (kept the yeast in the bottle for the first pour) and light in color-straw with just a hint of golden. Aromas of hops a plenty-spicy peppery and citrus rind. Lots of that traditional Belgian yeast aroma in here too. Taste is like the aroma, lots of yeast, hops and clean malts. Upfront malty, then yeasty and finally hoppy and a bit bitter. The beer finishes quickly and is dry. As it warms on the 2nd pint the volatile alcohols come out stronger. Overall although not a style I gravitate towards, this is a well done beer with loads of malt, hops and yeast balanced in unison for a drinkable big beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very nice example of the style (Belgian IPA) with good smell and taste - the beer is rather easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, dandelion yellow coloring with a thin, small bubbled, clingy, white head and a slow, steady flow of carbonation bubbling. Aromas of floral hops, jasmine, and a spiciness imparted from the yeast, with a hint of honey and toasted grains. Very mild, well blended aromas. Flavors are very well blended, riding a thin, sharp body. Roasted and resiny hopped forward flavor, with a floral and bitter component as the brew crosses your tongue. Slight buttery biscuit backbone, which supports the hops profile. A touch of fruity and funky highlights can be gleamed throughout, too. Tart, fruity, and hoppy aftertaste, with the fruit taking over into the finish, along with a touch of resin and bitter. Clean, crisp finish. Very tasty, drinkable brew."

"M: Medium bodied."

"Overall: A well-rounded beer. Maybe a tad too much spice flavor, but the mouthfeel makes up for it."
""
"O: You get a clean sense with each taste and swallow. Hop presence wasn't where I would like, but than again I'm a hop fiend. The Belgian strain, sense of apples, and carbonation were the highlights of this beer for me. It's nothing earth shattering, but it's a pleasant Belgian IPA. I would recommend to try at least once."
""
""
"O: this is a pretty good beer, and it started out w/ two strikes against what I typically enjoy, I am not a huge fan of Belgians or wheat beers, but this is pulled of nicley, and if you a fan if the style if suggest that this is a must try."
""
"B-"
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the cooling, spicy aroma, and solid flavoring. The nose was so inclusive, with the aforementioned accolades, along with intense bittering, hoppiness, and graininess that makes you want to sip it again and again. The taste acts only to confirm this drive. The feel does so doubly. This is the reason we love Belgian IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"This is the way I like my IPA's. It is not too harsh but presents itself enough to satisfy. A fine tribute to an early pioneer of the Maine brewing industry."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a long time."
""
""
""
"A golden yellow/light orange color with a two finger white cap that fills the tulip. The nose is of sweet bready malt, earth, and citrus with astringent, fruity notes from the Belgian yeast. This could almost double as a hoppy saison. On the palate, fruity notes up front with an astringent feel through the middle. Earthy notes and some light fruit (apple) come out in the finish before a mild citric bitterness. A little bit of spice dots the landscape. Medium body with a bit of a prickly feel. Solid flavor throughout with a decent dose of bitterness. Well-balanced. A tasty Belgian IPA that toes the line of saison in spots. I love a good Belgian IPA and while this one doesn't wow me, it is definitely welcome in my glass anytime."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and some lingering bitterness on the end. Pretty happy with this beer and should try to grab a bottle when I get the chance. Pretty solid BIPA and looking forward bto more in the future."

"I downgraded this beer because it really falls off when it warms. You get a lot of bitterness and a little metallic taste. I recommend sharing this bottle to enjoy it at the best temperature."
""
""
""
"O: Quite refreshing, drinks smooth, lots of subtle flavors that complement each other. Leaves a piney aftertaste. Really glad I tried it, not sure it is worth $23/750ml, but uniquely enjoyable."
"Overall, a great beer. I am going to try to find a newer bottle and compare."
""
"Overall this brew is a hop lover’s Belgian dream. Got to give it up to this brewer once again, seems everything they brew is quite tasty..."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form randomly around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain and some soapy and floral hop aromas. Taste is pretty much exactly the same with a medium level of bitterness that lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good Belgian take on an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a fantastic beer, another wonderful one from one of the best breweries in the US or the world."
""

"Hugh Malone is a warm-weather beer that would go well with fish."

""

""
""
""
""
"O: This was pretty tasty. I quite enjoyed the balance and the crispness of the beer. For my personal preference I wish it was a bit more on the IPA side than the Belgian side, but I certainly didn't mind it. The overall does have to take a bit of a hit from the price sadly, which is simply too high. A common problem I've found from Allagash."

""
"O: This ""Belgian IPA"" is a very unique ale. I certainly like it very much. If you're an IPA fan or a Belgian fan you'll likely enjoy this beer. I recommend it for sure."
"Overall: This one reminds me of going in to a bath and body shop. Really soapy. Still thought it was good, but I don't think I'll have it again, especially given the price of a bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer but not worth the bloated price tag. I got it for the holidays thinking it would be a nice treat for the family get together. Again, it was a solid IPA but not worth twice the price of similar beers."
""
""
""
"O: I'm turned off from this style due to the bitter grassiness that I mentioned. This one doesn't have that quality and it's a better beer for it!"
""
""
"Drinkability – This beer is so smooth. The sugared grapefruit flavor really grabbed my taste buds and kept me coming back sip after sip. Full bodied carbonation and a palate cleansing bitterness. The Belgian yeast hold things together really well. Solid brew."
""
""
"O - Pricey beer ($18), but to be expected with Allagash. Quality beer. Despite being kept for longer than optimal, tasted great poured into snifter."
""
"O - its a good brew. not worth the price at meadhall but a good brew none the less."
"Allagash is always top notch"

"Overall: One of the better Belgian IPAs I have had. The alcohol is really well hidden and the hops are not as biting as some Belgian IPAs. This one is really smooth and super easy to drink. I could definitely have a couple of these in a night."

"O: Usually not a style that I really like, but this is a very well done BIPA. I really like the hop combination here and the spicy yeast character, works really well. A very nice beer."
"O: Very good belgian IPA, very tastey and perfect balance on this brew."
"O - This is a pretty solid beer from Allagash. Good take on the style, very nice spices."
"My Accidental Highway to Hell Tour begins right here. I know you're pumped! It pours a lightly hazy pale yellow straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon zest, mandarin orange syrup, wet hay, light pineapple, and a touch o' banana peel. The taste holds notes of banana peel, lemon rind, orange rind, light orange zest, very light clove, melon, grass, and a few pinches of brown sugar and nutmeg. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid BIPA, though nothing overtly special or outstanding."
"Taste if full...belgian hoppy IPA. coats the tongue of alcohol and yeasty fruit. Very tastey and a satisfying brew. I wouldnt hesitate to get again."
"Although it's a pretty good beer of the style, it's also probably the most expensive version of the style I've ever seen. For that reason alone it will be a one time purchase for me as there are too many alternatives for a fraction of the cost. For what I paid I could have probably bought a dozen Raging Bitches instead."
"The golden color and thick alabaster 3/4"" head invited me warmly into this potent Belgian IPA. The 9 ounce pour had a nice bubbly appearance with quite a bit of lacing. Its nose definitely had strong pine and grapefruit notes which also came thru once I tasted it. This finish was crisp and my food match choice woule be fish and chips."
"Overall - A very nice beer by allagash, not the best allagash I've had and definitely not the best IPA or belgian IPA for that matter but a great beer nonetheless. 20 bucks a bottle at my local shop however would make me run away, i probably will never buy this bottled. On tap for 7 bucks though, it was worth it. Good job once again allagash!"
"Overall: It is kind of a pricey brew for my budget now, but I spoil myself with good beer here and there and this is well worth it. If I could drink this all the time I would gladly enjoy, but I believe it is only brewed once a year and I guess that is factor as well. If I see it again I will pick it up I suggest if you were interested enough to read this review then you should try this ale too."
"Poured into an Allagash stem glass, this IPA was a slightly hazy amber color with a frothy puff of white head that retained well and left some decent lacing. Brilliant aroma of herbal and citrus hops, and a cornucopia of fresh fruit. As it approached my lips, I actually got the sensation of a West Coast IPA. Hops and more hops, grassy and citric, orange blossom and honey, all overlaid on a solid sweet malt base. Mellows out towards the end and leaves a nice dry finish. Medium mouthfeel, and quite the quaffable IPA. Goes great with food."
"I will try this one again"
"A hazed but glowing amber color with cap of dense white froth, good lacing. Scent is strong on juicy and fruity citrus hops, strong orange and candied sugar notes backed by a faint grain whiff, light spice and bready yeast. Taste leads with the orange and tangerine notes, spice and bready yeasts come through before the beer mellows into a fresh grain backbone. Medium bodied, a touch of oily heft, bubbly. A very nice surprise, good fruity Belgian IPA."
"Overall it is pretty good, nothing to special for the price"
"This beer poured out as a hazy yellow color, The head was long lasting and left a decent lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer gave off plenty of hop aromas and Belgian yeast. The taste of the beer had a light bready flavor to it with a bitter hoppy finish. The mouthfeel of this had a good strong bite to it with each sip. The yeast didn't really soften this beer up too much. Overall i found this to be a pretty good Belgian Style IPA but not my favorite."
"O- Very well made beer, but what else would you expect from Allagash."
"O: Looks amazing. Smells amazing. Though good this tastes like a typical belgian IPA (read as disappointing)"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, but it was a bit out of balance for my taste. There is something about it that I can't quite put my finger on. It is like it has a very subtle wild character, but not enough to contribute anything but an anomaly in the flavor. That said, it is probably just an earthy hops that I am misinterpreting or something. Either way, I will certainly drink the whole bottle, but they make others that I enjoy a lot more than I have this one."
"jd"
"A relatively uninteresting and bland Belgian IPA. What flavors that are here are pleasant enough, but they're hiding!"
"10/1/2010"
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, fresh hops, and not to incriminate myself, kind of like a bag of weed. In the taste, dry pine hops and a light yeasty presence. A small hop bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small hop and yeasty aftertaste. Big hops and mellow Belgian like qualities. Quite enjoyable."
"O: Overall, a pretty good Belgian IPA, though I feel like the Belgian notes get a bit overwhelmed by the hops. They're definitely there, but don't balance well with the hop flavors."
"Overall this is a good solid beer. ABV is low enough were I can take down an entire bottle and not feel to buzzed, taste is pleasing, goes down smoothly, and the dryness keeps you comming back for more."
"This must be one of the first Allagash brews I have not enjoyed. From the pour, the beer looked amazing. A murky golden orange with very thick foam and a bitter citrus smell. I was pretty excited. But after my first sip, I realized something was a little off. The bitterness I smelled turned into a round, sour taste. Not sharp sour like a flemish sour ale, but round sour, like old milk. I'm not sure if I just got a bad bottle, or if this was their intention, but it didn't work for me. The orange and citrus notes redeemed it enough to make it drinkable, but there was something acrid about the taste that really put me off. All around, I'm a huge Allagash fan, so I'm hoping and guessing this was just an off bottle."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink considering its alcohol content."
"My first Allagash and it won't be my last. Nice foam head on the pour. It is well balanced and easily drinkable. Don't let the high ABV scare you off. Primarily citrus and pine taste with Belgian yeast going around. There might be something better out there but this is a pretty good start to me."
"Smooth to start and then gentle carbonation. Hops balances the sweetness and finishes with slight bitter. Smooth and clean"
"im glad to share this beer, but the drinkability is so high, i wouldnt mind having it all to myself :)"
"D: A very drinkable beer, but not the best in the style. Another great beer from a great brewery though!"
"D: Amazing. Fantastically refreshing. Great brew."
"The yeast flavors are very prominent, bready and fruity, and a bit sour. Hops blend in with a grainy, herbal bitterness that is quite pronounced."
"Listed as 8.5% ABV here but my bottle says 7.8% on the label. Either way, the alcohol didn't show up much, if at all. Very drinkable. A decent take on the style. I find that Belgian IPAs end up either on the hoppy American side or the yeasty Belgian side but this one seems to walk the line pretty well compared to most."
"D: Excellent representation of a style that I'm not particularly fond of. Leans much closer to Belgian than American. Drinks well but I don't see myself making a repeat purchase for B+ beer."
"D: Another well made, drinkable beer from Allagash."
"D - I enjoyed this much more on tap that from the bottle. The hops really come out more and give this brew a freshness that I enjoyed quite a bit."
"D: One of my favorites from Allagash. Although I've never had it from a bottle, it's fantastic on tap. Hops are really put on display"
"On tap at picco. Live review. Poured into an Allagash tulip glass. Golden yellow orange color with thick white head and excellent lacing. Complex smell and taste which are quite similar - combination of spicy peppery and pine (which ultimately wins out) combined with fruity hints which are there but fleeting (citrus, banana, keep thinking peach (?)). Pretty smooth feel. Liking this one but wouldn't go for more than a couple."
"d - An ok Belgian IPA, but there was something in the smell and taste that seemed like mint to me that was offputting; not sure exactly what it was. Decent but probably would not have again."
"Not the easiest one to finish, a little overwhelming, & not in a good way. Hmm, not sure this was worth the ""out-of-towner"" price I dropped for it. The high points were pretty standard for the style (which is still to say, ""good""), the low points were a turn-off. The alcohol wore too much & wasn't justified by the flavor. Decent enough, but not my fave by a long shot."
"Awesome, very drinkable. Complex, tasty. No date, but had for at least a year. This is a great beer with some age on it."
"Drinkability -- Not a bad representation of the style. The hops were subdued enough to let the yeast flavors be fully experienced. Not sure if its' worth buying a bottle, but nonetheless a pleasure."
"2010 version, on draught. Served in a nice Allagash glass, bright and vibrant orange with a soapy foam head. Lots of bready aromas and a nice woodsy hop bouquet in the nose. Wow, lots of hops - moreso than I remember upon sampling this beer a few years ago - maybe they have stepped up the hoppage in recent years to follow the trends. Citrusy and sharp, but with musty earth underpinnings, yeasty and doughy all at once. A pretty darn tasty combination. Nice body and heft on the palate and a fun one to drink, shooting so many flavors at you without over-mucking the beer. A winner."
"A well made beer just not one that wows me."
"D: This was a great beer with perfect balance and bright, crisp taste. It was a delicious mix of bitter and sour and funky and sweet. It had perfect body too, so it was quite easy to drink. Not for aging, but very nice fresh."
"I like this beer a lot. Not what I was expecting for an IPA, but this could be the Belgian take on it. It seems more like a Belgian strong ale, but there is hop character to this one. I think this is a great summer beer and would pair well with pungent cheeses, salty meats, and olives."
"Decent but unlikely to go back to this at $19 per bottle."
"A great beer for summer."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is citrus fruits (mainly lemon) with some Belgian yeast. The flavor is Belgian yeast as well as lemons and oranges. The hop bitterness is there but it is not front and center. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - This wasn't my favorite Allagash offering. Not bad or anything, but not particularly interesting, and certainly not what I expected from the listed style of Belgian IPA."
"Drinkability: A rather large bottle with the alcohol shining through makes it a good bottle for an evening. I would have liked to have seen more hops on the palate mingling with some of the spices from the Belgian side of the story. Nonetheless, a well put together beer that's enjoyable, and I'd like to try again in a few years."
"Served from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Pours a nice copper color with a minimal white head. Lacing is minimal throughout. The aroma was comprised of only mild hops. The flavor was comprised of nice spicy and sweet hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with a nice medium carbonation. Overall this brew had an excellent flavor for an IPA and the sweetness aspect was a welcome change from typical IPA's and made it more refreshing. This was a nice brew with bold flavoring."
"This is one of those beers that's complex enough that one single meeting can't possibly give up all its secrets. Who is Hugh Malone, and what's he and this molecular structure doing on the label of this beer? Time for some research, I reckon. Fine stuff, which is par for the course from Allagash, at the very least..."
"The taste is filled with a light caramel toffee taste. There is a Belgian yeast flavor that adds a slight sour, earthy taste but is not in your face at all. There is a citrusy grass flavor as well. the taste ends with a bit of bitterness though it is light bitterness. It seems there is a mix of British and Belgian style in this beer. It is quite complex and smooth. The carbonation is medium. Overall a nice Belgian IPA not sure if it's worth the price but it is very nice ale."
"Taste isn too hoppy for an ipa but it's got a nice bite to it with a vey fresh clean finish. Makes for a great summer beer."
"A bit of bad follow-up one night at Lord Hobo, starting off with some rich, dark ales, as this one was quite the transition, although a bit a palate re-adjuster for later brews. Golden yellow with some haze and a bright white fluffy 2 fingers of light head & sticky lace. The aroma was somewhat mild, evoking a peppery lemon yeast. The flavor likewise did the same in a creamy, but still quite easy to drink crisp & bubbly refreshing way. Pretty basic, but a nice summer beer, if you can it cheap!"
"overall a very interesting beer. not sure how often i would order this but not lacking personality and has pretty good balance. lemony hop profile could be more interesting and more yeasty spice or malt would make the beer less direct on the palate and more interesting."
"Slainte."
"D: Damn, I really enjoyed this beer. Definitely something I would enjoy sipping on again, as it's quite easy to drink... dangerously so for 8.5%-9.5%."
"A close friend brought over a 750ml bottle to share. Poured a glowing honey/orange color with a big fluffy white head into my SA glass. I am a hop head and the smell was glorious, lots of resinous piney hops, sweet caramel malt, and a whiff of Belgian yeast. Taste was a hop explosion with lots of pine notes well balanced by the sweet malt and yeast notes. Incredible lacing clings to the glass after every sip. I am indeed lucky to have a friend share such a fabulous beer with me."
"On tap at Brick Store Pub. Poured into an Allagash tulip. Inch of white foam rests atop a golden body. Aroma is fruity, slightly sweet, with a hint of funk. Taste is unique in an Allagash sort of way. The Allagash funk adds an interesting twist to this style. I think the sour actually overpowers the bitter and the sweet, not in a bad way. If you go into this beer expecting a beer typical of the style, you may be let down. Go into it expecting an Allagash version of a Belgian ipa, you'll be richly rewarded."
"Not bad. Solid, but the oily and soapy hops detract a little to much for me."
"Overall this was a good looking Belgian IPA but in terms of flavor it wasn't quite up there with the big boys. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Overall, big ups to a great trader for putting this in my hands. I would get this again for the smell alone, the taste is no deterrent either, the 750 will be no problem for one sitting. Good."
"The feel is ok, decent drinkability."
"D: Better when fresh, one glass is enough"
"Quite a nice beer from Allagash. It pours out an even brown clor with a bit of a flimsy lightly colored head. Malty flavored beer with a lot caramel/roasted flavors and a toffee sort of tone. good complexity. Easy to drink. This bottle was aged for a couple years prior to drinking. I've never had it fresh, so I don't know if the complexities change at all over time."
"A pretty nice brew though the price is a bit on the steep side."
"Drinkability: this beer is quite drinkable, which at 9.5% is a danger. If the hops were toned down a hair, or perhaps if another, more floral or less intense variety were used, I feel like this beer would get bumped half a point in drink and taste easily."
"Excellent brew. I would love to try this on tap sometime out East, but from the bottle, this is another fine beer from the folks at Allagash. I'll be serving the other bottle at my birthday tasting party sometime in January, & I suspect Hugh will go over well with those who are not craft beer nuts."
"Overall- Great brew showcasing belgian and american highlights! Worked great with the spicy chili I was eating!"
"Tastes/feels great for a Belgian IPA (examples like Stricklander or CaliBelgique are too pale and thin, the lack of filtering really does it some good). I usually, however like a nice malt backbone to take the sting out of the hops, the belgian yeast is a different approach, and isn't quite my favorite."
"On tap at the Church Key in DC. Beautiful orange pour, with a big fluffy white head on top that leaves perfect lacing as it drains. Hard to top, looks-wise. Strong hoppy nose, big with fruit and citrus all over the place. Flavor is huge as well - tons of caramel malt mixed perfectly with that big citrusy hop backbone. Actually quite similar to an American IPA/DIPA in terms of that monsterous hops presence, but the flavor itself is a little bigger even than your standard IPA. A really excellent beer, another tasty and unique monster from Allagash."
"This is what I don't like about Belgian IPAs. The styles of Belgian beers used for the platform for the bittering and flavoring hops are delicate beers to begin with. They are actually tripels with very subtle flavor characteristics that end up completely overwhelmed by bitterness. This beer is no exception. When I drink a beer like this I think, ""what would this beer be like without the hops?"" Probably a Belgian Strong Pale, another beer that is not known for its over the top malt character or fruity spiciness but a clean bright flavor. The hop bitterness is what is most present in this beer. The citrus flavors (almost orange peel) is present in the mid and some in the front. There is moderate to mild sweetness at the front, but overall the hops mask almost everything. This beer is bright and bitter. Drinkability moderate, mouthfeel is fine. Beer is a little thin for my tastes."
"Drinkability - I just loved this beer. It was rich, flavorful, unique, and exciting. I don't know how you would rate it to the style but for me this was excellent."
"750ml bottle, batch #3, drank on 11/6/09, poured into an Allagash chalice. A beautiful bright copper, slightly cloudy body with good carbonation underneath a four finger, fairly tight, head that slowly dies to half of a finger. The nose has a nice big hop profile, herbal and piney, some sweet malt, a little bit of the classic Allagash yeast character, but definately hop dominant. The taste is more of the same, herbal/piney hops upfront, supported by a great malt backbone, a little bit of booze, some great yeast funk, some tropical fruit flavors, very complex. Mouthfeel is a creamy, medium body, just a touch overcarbonated for me. This is a great belgian style IPA, I will certainly be picking up some more of this!"
"Soft carbonation up front with a lightly hopped creamy medium body with some earthy dry pine notes that linger throughout. Sweet estery golden fruit notes from the Belgian yeast. Apple and pear dominate with hints of grape and raisin. Subtle malt backbone provides nice balance. Slight alcohol warmth present throughout yet the ABV is decently masked making it quite quaffable. Very resinous dry pine hop flavor in the finish."
"Kudos to Hugh Malone!"
"Poured into a chalice a very nice golden orange color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with lots of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some slight hop notes, slight citrus. The taste is sweet/bitter, malty, yeasty, slightly hoppy, some citrus notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this has got to be one of the best Belgian IPAs I've had to date."
"I really enjoy this beer and thought I'd do a review of an aged bottle over a fresh one should people want to keep and try older bottles."
"D- High. Going back to clear out the stock. I found this beer to be more complex than what most reviews allude to. I also noticed the number one complaint about this beer was the price point, as some paid $15-$20 for this one. At $8.79, I feel like I hit paydirt... this beer is amazing for the price. I looove this beer."
"Nothing really off, but not one of my favorite's from Allagash."
"It's hard to compete with the Belgians, and since this is a one-off product it may have been rushed a bit. But overall its a solid beer but weak categorically. It got much better as it warmed up and the yeast was swirled and poured in in the second pour, but the 750ml was quite enough, thank you."
"overall: really complex stab at this style im not really sure exactly where it fits style wise i guess belgian ipa works, sort of a style defying brew in my opinion worth the chance to try if your into beers that finish really dry and if you like allagash because they dont make many hoppy brews which this definitely is"
"Overall one of the top American Belgian style IPA's but I have a feeling this bottle was older than others I've tried and the hops have mellowed out a bit. I'm cheating a bit and upping the score a bit based on those other tastings. Score would be even higher if I had taken notes the times I've had it on tap."
"Hmmm... probably not in the upper tier of brews, but still a decent stab at the style. I felt that the sweetness hindered the drinkability for me, and if that could be reduced this could be a real winner."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: This is an extremely pleasant beer. The flavor profile is not terribly dynamic, but it's well-rounded overall."
"D: A solid example of the Belgian IPA style, the only problem is, with the $17 price tag, I'm expecting something exceptional, not just a 'good' beer which this is. If it's ever on-tap I'm sure to revisit it."
"HV"
"Reviewed on 06/22/2009. I had this on draft. Pours gold with a small white head. Aroma of bready/yeasty malt with spices and sweet fruit. Flavor of sweet fruits initially with a yeasty finish. Pretty tasty although I don't get the hops. Good BSA though."
"D: This is interesting and complex though subtle. I don't know if it's something I'd want to drink a lot of, especially for the price, but it would make a nice after-dinner drink."
"Obviously, I really like this beer, but it makes me wonder what this tastes like when new, and what impact the aging had on it. I see no date code anywhere on the bottle, so hard to say how old it was when I bought it. Frankly, I expected it to be more hop intensive, and I suppose the aging mellowed this somewhat, but in any case I am extremely satisfied with the results. Everyone complains about the price...yes, I think I paid something like $16.99 for this bottle, with $1 going to charity it is still expensive, but as much as I enjoyed it, well worth it...I will look for it again."
"An okay Belgian IPA. Seems like there was too much orange peel flavor in this one for me."
"Drinkability is very good, this belgian IPA is great, and I am very happy to have finally had the opportunity to drink it, very nice beer and worth your time."
"...and so ends another round of the T.U.I. See you again tomorrow morning, when I will hold a breakfast special."
"a beligan carbonated american IPA. pours a murky orange yellow. with a off white head that is consistent but doesn't hold like a belgian. nose of lemon zest and grapefruit hop. peppery. palate is a dry lemon. sharper acid in comparison to most. doesn't have a compatible malt style to what i'm used to. carbonation is a bit aggressive on the tongue... goes horribly with the bitter finish of the beer. don't waste your time having this one on tap. i think i mellows out a bit better in the bottle."
"Notes: This is good beer. I loved the citrus and pine-flavored hops on top of the Belgian-inspired base for this brew. But it just lacked the complexity to blow me away. All of the flavors seem to mingle nicely together. I was afraid the hops would outshine the competition, but they don't because they seem rather subdued and muddled in the midst of things. Still, pretty enjoyable!"
"D: Pretty good, but at $17 a bottle, definitely not worth it."
"Pours a pale amber color with an inch and a half of pillowy head. Lacing is consistent through out the length of the beer. Slight hops aroma, which diminishes with the taste, where a slight earthy belgian yeast is absorbed by the tongue. Mouthfeel has decent carbonation. Not as hoppy as some other Belgian IPAs, but definetly hoppy for a belgian style beer. Nicely balanced, and I was surprised at the drinkabilty given the 9.5% alcohol."
"D - Well-balanced Belgian-style IPA. Wishing for more of the Belgian character and the hops might have faded a bit (it's been in my fridge for 5 months or so). Otherwise, very drinkable and refreshing."
"this brew pours up a murky rust color with a quickly fading off white head. the nose is light fruits, smoothed out hops, cork, slight slight sourness as this bottle might be juuust starting to turn. I taste light fruits again, mellowed floral hops, pretty buttery mouthfeel, full bodied, heavy carbo. This brew may be 6 months to a year past its prime. Still good but better fresh"
" Wish I could find this even in bottle form."
"Overall, it's relatively easy, pleasant, and sufficiently fulfilling."
"D - A very complex and drinkable BIPA. This has great hop character, and while the Belgian yeast character might be a little weak it is detectable enough to mark this beer as something other than an American DIPA."
"Drinkability is pretty good, too bad like many of the ALlagash line the price is up there. Glad I was able to sample it for free. Thanks, Joe!"
"I'm not so sure why this only has a B+ rating thus far. I love the Belgian IPA style and this is either in spot 1 or 2 for me. Highly recommended. Nice job Allagash."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, it went down very quickly"
"This is an all-around good beer. The hazy, chilled golden color stood out against the sunset. A slender head perched atop in a bone white. The nose was hoppy, peppery, fresh, and had hints of sharp belgian yeasty citrus notes. The taste was sweet and hoppy with a nice creamsicle like flavor that I associate with a nice belgian tripel. The mouthfeel was sharp and carbonated, but not too thin. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"D - Easy drinking, especially for 8.5% ABV... Given its classification as a Belgian IPA, it's disappointing... The hop profile was so subdued, that I would have never guessed this was a Belgian IPA if I didn't no otherwise... I've never been a huge fan of Allagash brews, but I keep trying new ones an always seem to walkaway unimpressed..."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"D- This is another solid beer from Allagash, one that I enjoyed from the first sip to the last. Recommened."
"Overall, an outstanding beer that I highly recommend. Another homerun from Allagash. If avail here (brought this back from Indy) this would be in main rotation."
"A less hoppy but nonetheless quite enjoyable take on the style."
"Mouthfeel is firmly carbonated, medium bodied, just a bit oily. I would drink this beer again, for sure."
"D: Bought this by accident. Pretty much knew what to expect. This bitch is expensive at $18. It's a decent beer -- a good Belgian IPA. I'm not a big fan of the style, which I don't consider very drinkable. But was able to slowly begin to enjoy this brew for what it is, and it's not bad."
"Definitely a hopped-up Belgian brew, but I'll need to try a few others to see if the resemblance to an IPA is warranted."
"Medium bodied, great vivacity and creamy richness envelop the palate with flavors of citrus, golden malts and a nice smooth bittering with some spice at the end. Alcohol comes through just a tad strong after the beer warms up a bit, but the flavors are awesome and very well balanced. This is one of my favorite styles of beer, a bastard hybrid between an American Northwest IPA and a Belgian golden ale and this one hits a home run."
"After 1/2 glass, I began to enjoy the unique flavor. Personally, I've never tasted anything quite like this which made it a great experience. This is coming from someone that hasn't found an Allagash brew that I'd buy again. But, I'm pretty sure I've only tasted a few. Also, if someone had an Allagash, I'd definitely want to get a taste."
"I get a very well balanced beer, Belgian throughout yet most intense at the start with the hops! The hoppy finish is necessary and not overwhelming. Great head retention. Could finish fatter. Is a little thin. Real nice flavor on the tongue as the beer warms."
"From the bomber at room temperature into a pint glass, this one gives you a cloudy copper brown color with a solid but thin off-white head and excellent lacing. I smell easter ham here with clove and champagne grape. The first taste brings more of that champagne feel and flavor. Plenty of mellow clove and some malt. Belgianesque in taste and feel but relatively mellow and easy drinking. I like it as a nice change up, refreshing and kind of unique."
"drinkability is fairly good. the high carbonation does detract slightly. this is a confusing brew - it's labeled here as a belgian ipa, but the description on the brewery's website makes it sound more like an english/american ipa hybrid and the taste has it borrowing from all three ipa types. it leans mostly to the american side, with higher (still too high) belgian carbonation and a bit of yeasty twang, yet not enough hops to satisfy any of the three. still, if you ignore the label it remains a tasty and enjoyable brew, especially once it's had time to breathe and allow the carbonation to settle."
"Belgian style bomber, caged and corked, no bargain @ $18.99(!), @ Decicco Market in Ardsley, NY. No freshness indication dating system employed. Pours typical orangy amber, medium tan nice looking frothy head, shows better then moderate retention than dissolves to a layer of fine film and leaves some thick sheeting and splotchy lacing. Dull nose of some maple malt notes, light soap and resiny hop oils. Tasty creation, combing two sexy styles, IPA and Belgian ale. This one simply does not meet the mark of the heavy weights of the style. (which are all available for quite a bit less$ BTW) Here, the hops are muted, I found the hops to be limited to an underlying layer of resinous bitterness. Lacking of the heady floral bouquet and citric hop bite of Houblon Chouffe for example. Decent beer, for sure, but overpriced."
"I am a little disappointed because the marks go down from there, but I still can't complain, because I love this beer. I think the hops and the yeast aren't blending as smoothly as they should. The taste is hoppy, piney a little bit grapefruit pith and ends spicy, yeasty. The mouthfeel is full, creamy. I love the style. The Belgian IPA, traditionalists be damned, is quickly becoming a favorite. Hugh Malone doesn't stand out in a crowd, of BelgIPAs. But what are you gonna do, half-assed breweries aren't attempting this. World-class breweries are. Try Piraat first, if your new to this style, and go from there."
"Got this in a trade as an extra! Thank you for the wonderful beer Miamifan1354. Would definitely purchase this beer if it were available in Michigan."
"1096"
"mouthfeel is appropriate. lively when it's just out of the bottle and it moves quick on the tongue. nice brew...can't decide if warrior and simcoe hops disqualify it from being a belgian ipa, but i guess the truth is that i don't really care"
"Pours cloudy gold with a humongous white head. Rocky, nice lacing. Aroma advertises a great beer. Hoppy, peppery, some pine, and a fragrant, sweet Belgian yeastiness. Flavor does not carry through. Soapy, unbalanced hops with that medicinal herbalness (perfect call swoopjones). The crystal malt goes very well with the yeast, however. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was good, just not great. Probably could have been better without the dry-hopping."
"D- This is a very good, very complex Belgian IPA. Due to its $ I probably won't trade for it again but will have it again if I see it in stores. Another great brew by Allagash that I was impressed with."
"Good one. I again show myself that I love Belgian Ipa's!!"
"Good, not great."
"Notes from 1/15/08"
"D: This is a nice balance between an American IPA and a Belgium Tripel. Solid candidate for a session beer for ale lovers."
"Allagash hasn't always delivered for me in the past but this guy is something I would like to revisit."
"Allagash sets the bar high with their interpretation of this emerging style. Surprisingly, this is more 'Belgian' tasting than examples I've had from Belgium... but now that I think of it, maybe I shouldn't be surprised at all since Allagash is probably the best maker of Belgian beers outside of Belgium."
"The aroma has lots of hops compared to most Belgians. It's also got malt, yeast, pepper, herbs, and spice. The appearance is amber with a foamy head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall it's Pretty good. I am just not sold on Belgian IPA's for some reason."
"Hugh Malone is all about humulones. Ordinarily, that sort of focus would be right up my alley. However, a well-crafted Belgian IPA is much more than Belgian yeast and a huge hop load. The best versions (Urthel Hop-It, De Ranke XX Bitter and Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel) have absolutely nothing to worry about."
"Mouthfeel is very bubbly and finishes mostly dry, with a slight residual sweetness like honey. Very easy to drink, and no real alcohol presense."
"Don't know much about it, except that it cost $17 for a 750mL bottle, 2-4 times what I normally buy.. Pours a medium brown color, very murky. Off-tan head, big & lasting. Big bubbles & good lacing. Very effervescent, light floral aroma. Not as dark or heavy an aroma as a Belgian strong. Also there's a sharp smell, not quite metallic. But kind of plasticy. Uh oh...I think that usually means something bad. Sharp strong taste, with that same plasticy but more dull. Spicy aftertaste. Warming up some more...Not as plasticy and the flavors are a little more muted. Spicy somewhat hoppy & not too dark or heavy. More perfumy & floral. Goes well with salty chips & salsa. Tasty beer."
"D - Well, at 8.5 ABV the envelope is maxed out. I can see pairing this with fish 'n chips, maybe some raw shell fish or preferably on its own year 'round."
"Drinkability is ok, pretty good but overpriced, even with the dollar a bottle going to charity. I better be really blown away by the 07 Interlude I just tracked down for a $25 in WA!!! As it stands, this one has a bit too much of a bite, on both the taste and the wallet!"
"Now that we get Allagash in Georgia we're even getting the special releases. Nice frothy head, fully dimished. Body was hazy, amber. Aroma: light bread, hay, and straw. LIght hoppiness, with herb and grass. Moderate yeast, aswell. Kind of smells like their Tripel. Also banana and apple. Very much like the tripel, but not as malty or yeasty. Ok, but not something I would buy again."
"I had not realized that this beer was a hop-forward ale. I'm glad I didn't try to cellar it, sacrificing the hop character in regret. A little head's-up on the bottle would have been nice. Having said that, the hop character, though pronounced doesn't give the bitterness or the hop flavor/aroma that classic Belgian hoppy beers do, like DeRank XX, Poppering's, or Houblon. The hops are tucked in right behind the Dubbel or Belgian amber ale maltiness. Those malts are very well attenuated, firm, soft, creamy, rich, and never leaves any residual sugars on the palate. Confection-like sweetness evaporates in the mouth and makes the beer increadibly drinkable. Fruity, rum-soaked peaches, pears, berries, apples, and appricots give the beer a lot of direction. Figs, pecans, and dates also contribute a richness that go along with a light maple syrup flavor. Finishes with an earthy, pungent, hop-herbal note that flirts with the candied malts well into the finish. An excellent beer, but I needed a lot more hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness- especially if American variety hops are used."
"D - pretty good. Enjoyed this beer (and 5th Earl) and would've had another, but decided to jet as the gf didn't want anything else. Would drink again. Allagash keeping it real as always"
"The beer poured a very nice cloudy orange-ish color with a big white head, no doubt due to the carbonation. The beer gave off a nice hopy aroma with a hint of sweetness and maybe a little pine. The taste was excellent...at first I really got all of the hops and then the Belgian yeast flavors really kicked in and it just brought the whole beer together. The beer was carbonated just right and it was very smooth, rich and highly drinkable. I will be going back to get a few bottles to keep around. This may become a staple in my beer fridge."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub courtesy of Brickstoredave. Pours a slightly cloudy orangey golden with an okay head. Nice aromas of piney hops and some malty sweetness as well as the typical Belgian yeast. This is a style that I often think can be too far in one direction or the other, but his manages to get it right. On tap its is very nice. The taste is even more on point with piney, spicy hops, some mellow sweetness that serves to underscore the hops, and that nice yeasty, Belgian tang. A tiny bit prickly in the throat, but with a touch of lingering sweetness to counterbalance this. Just delicious on tap. Alcohol? What alcohol?"
"taste of fruits, touch of sweetness, some metallicness to it, some hops, and caramel in the back, slight dry finish."
"I tasted it at the bottle shop at Pizza Port in Carlsbad, CA and loved every drop."
"Had my first Hugh Malone last weekend at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, ME. Excellent flavor and taste, definitely different than a typical American IPA. A sweet, faintly fruity beer -- poured a cloudy dark copper color with a nice head. Hard to describe the unique flavor -- someone else called it piney, which is about as good a description as I can think of. Don't go into this expecting it to taste like every other IPA you've tried -- it's got its own taste and is definitely worth a try. As for drinkability - you do notice it is an 8.5% beer, and more than two in a sitting would be tough."
"This is definitely a beer that doesn't want to be just one kinda beer. This is not a wild or adventurous beer, but it's a great unexpected combination that works really well, which makes the experience special. Mind you this is my first 'belgian IPA', it definitely got me to investigate more."
"EDIT: 9.27.09...I'm editing my review and giving this beer all 5s. I can't find any flaws, so, yeah..it's perfect."
"D: Not quite a Belgian IPA but still a good beer. For the price there are much better options out there like La Chouffe IPA. Don't think I can recommend this one."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden amber with a big puffy white head that lasted the duration of the session and left very good lacing. The smell is subdued and balanced for an IPA with some citrus hops but a significant sweet bready malt aroma as well. Taste is also heavy with sweet malts with the hops playing a supporting role. The mouthfeel is very creamy with good carbonation and a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Very crisp and clean. This is an extremely nice beer and the low-key hop profile makes it more drinkable than the alcohol indicates. Recommended."
"Drinkability- Despite not being as hoppy as expected, it did taste very good and I thought it was one of Allagash's better special releases...even though it wasn't truly to style. Certainly not worth the $14.99 price tag when I can get Hop To it which is better for under $10."
"Pours a rusty, muddy amber wth a slow recedng head, and very hard to see bubbling through the thick haze. The color looks just an IPA with ome more haze tan usual. The aroma is a medium sweet biscuit with a touch of honey a spicey touch of hoppy earth. The tate starts with the sweet biscuity toasted malts with notes of grains of pardise andhoney. The hops lend a light touch of lemon and some pine forest. The palate is a good balance of sweetness and bitterness. THe finish is long and mildly bitter. Great beer worth buying again and again"
"Over all, this is a nice beer- great packaging and nice little note about donating a buck a bottle to community groups in Maine. But in the end, it's nothing that blew me away and I can only look forward to seeing what this guy has in store next July 13th."
"Decent body and seriously carbonated. All in all I would say this beer is interesting and I am glad I tried it. It's not something I would seek out again though. A far cry from the Curieux that I can't get enough of."
"Overall this beer swings more towards the belgian side of the coin and that is not my bag. It was a solid beer that I am glad I tried, but I won't seek it out again. Belgians just are not my thing."
"D: good, nice spiciness and goes down nicely."
"Get a bottle and support MOFGA today."
"Although the hops have faded quite a bit compared to when it was fresh, this was still a very enjoyable beer. I remember it being a good interpretation of a Belgian IPA when I had it last summer, and it was interesting to see how this developed with almost a year in the cellar."
"It has a Belgian-esque sweet and sour going on, but falls short of a really good BIPA. More hops, please! Still, it's pretty drinkable and pretty good, though not worth the hefty price tag."
"750ml corked & caged. And what on earth is a Belgian IPA? I suppose I bought this one to find out. It hits the glass murky golden tan with a thin but determined light tan head and a hint of lace. The smell is honey, coriander, caramel. Seems more belgian than ipa so far. The taste is floral, caramel, peppery, with an element of mown grass and a very dry finish. Very odd mix. It grows on me, though. The mouthfeel is very soft & silky, with nice carbonation balance. Drinkability is good enough to polish off the bottle. Probably won't enter the regular rotation but definitely an experience to have."
"750 mL bottle, cellar aged for a year, poured into a goblet. Two fingers of off-white head dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. Clear amber color, grapefruit, banana and pine aroma. Soft round flavor with hints of banana and a slight malt sweetness. Medium body and high drinkability for this 8.5% brew."
"Thanks Steven."
"D. Pretty good for 8.5%, it's smooth enough and intriguing, but ultimately I didn't feel like this was one of Allagash's best efforts. At ~$15 bucks a bottle you can do better."
"I wasnt overly impressed with this beer."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a cloudy dirt brown color with a good off-white head that left some nice soapy lacing on the glass. The smell is some what faint, I pick up some granny smith apple, lemon, and very light spice. The taste is light bready malt, tart apples, and some dry bittering hops. Not much in the way of Belgian phenols or candi sugar, it is almost hard to detect the Belgian style. The hops don't really standout either. The feel is moderate and quite fizzy. A bit over carbonated actually. The finish is dry, almost puckering. The beer isn't bad but I believe it missed its mark as a Belgian IPA. Not enough Belgian flavors and the hops don't standout. Seems to be more malty than other BIPAs, perhaps this is the reason."
"Tastes of fruits, spices, sweet malt and citric hops (laid back though). The mouthfeel was a tad thin and over carbonated (IMO)."
"750ml bottle: This one opened with a loud POP, but fortunately there was no spillage. It pours a cloudy, dark amber color with a bit of an off-white head to it. It leaves some lacing down the glass. There is a bready, spicy and yeasty nose to the beer, as well as some citrus (mainly grapefruit) and pine also. An interesting taste. Some breadiness and yeastiness to it, with a hint of apricots in there. There is a hint of sweetness despite the hop presence. Somewhere between medium and full bodied, yet there is still a perception of lightness to it. This definitely grows on you."
"I like this beer. It grows on you as it warms up, in my opinion. I am half-way through the bottle and I prefer it much more now than at first sip. It's a relatively light (although not in ABV; it's 8.5%) and easy-drinking ale. Smoother as it warms up, with more discernable Belgian IPA qualities slowly emerging. Give it a try; it's worth it."
"Pours a clear fairly dark brown with a good sized crème head. Nose is very sugary sweet like candy or even cotton candy and a good amount of wood mixed in there as well. Flavor is mild. Slight hops, pretty big sweetness going on. Besides that? Maybe a little wood. Small amount of spices. Feel has a lot of carbonation to it, but I have to say I think the liquid is a bit too thin. Overall it is drinkable, but for the price? Hell no. This is one of the first beers I have wanted to take back and get a refund. $16.99? Are you joking? $16.99 for what?? Dont bother."
"Nicely done IPA. I thought it was an Irish dry, and yet it wasn't overly dry. Yeasty and a body to it. Some interesting, calmer IPA even British style IPA with a cloudy peachy colour and some white head. Fruity hoppy malty aroma. A bit dry finish, otherwise nicely done hoppy ale."
"So, overall the beer was good, but for the price $13.99, I've had beers for 1/2 the price that I've enjoyed much more. I like Allagash beers in general, but this isn't near the top of their best products."
"I could drink this beer all night, and probably suffer from it."
"At first glance you think, nah - can't be, is Allagash brewing an ale in a funky 750ml bottle? Well, it's true, another Belgium for the library - this ale has that Belgium character, but hey wait a minute it's not as strong as some others I've had, but it has a great balance of sweetness and even tier of ABV (sitting at 8.5%), with cloudyness. The chemicals swish and swoosh around in the mouth and it lingers enough for that flavorful aroma. It makes yah respect the Belgium style that Allagash has done over the years. It's nice, maybe could use a little hoppy drive. Have it over dinner and experiment. - jc"
"Bottle: Poured a mahogany color ale with a huge foamy head with some good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with some dry with some dry Czech hops. Taste is also dominated by those sweet malt with limited dry fruits characteristics or oak notes. Body is quite full with some great carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable."
"D: An interesting offering, but not something that I would rank too highly because of the off-the-wall flavor characteristics. The Belgian IPA is a style I haven't had much experience with, but what I have sampled I've enjoyed. This one seems to miss the mark somewhat, but would still be worth a try."
"Interesting, but unfortunately not very drinkable. If laid down for a year or more, it might lose enough of the hop edge to be tasty."
"Pretty drinkable but you have to think Belgian Beer and not really IPA. Still this is a pretty tasty Belgian Style Strong Pale Ale."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a fruity pale malt and Belgian yeast aroma. There is a light hop aroma that seems to blend nicely with the spiciness of the Belgian yeast. The taste is average. It has a warm, pale malt flavor along with a very spicey yeast finish. The hops are present, but they take a backseat to the ""Belgian pale ale"" flavor. There is a mild bitterness that really reveals itself in the finish, but I'm not that impressed with it. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a flop by Allagash. I've had hybris style beers like this before, but this one falls flat. I like the idea, but the execution lacks. I prefer more IPA character. This tastes like a Saison yeast. It's quite peppery. They should use a less aggressive yeast to highlight the hop profile, IMO."
"This beer pours an amber color with a nice head that has good retention. The aroma is slightly earthy and has a hint of alcohol to go along with a bit of fruitiness. The flavor has a lot of sweetness along with some spices. There is also a strong caramel malt profile and some fruit character. The body seems moderate, but a little more thin than I expected. The drinkability is just ok, as the spices and the alcohol present them readily in the flavor. This isn't a bad beer as it has a lot of character, but I don't know that it's one I'd seek out again unless it's much older."
"Not a bad beer, but as most of the reviewers so aptly stated, it is definitely overpriced. $16 dollars for a 750ml is steep for a beer. Yes, the cork and casing are cool, but it ends there. The beer is a well carbonated, hazy orange amber with a very nice off white head that retains and retains. There is a goodly amount of lacing too. The carbonation doesn't quit, with the little fizzy bubbles streaming to the top well after the pour. The smell is very subdued and not very enticing. I little more dry hopping could have brought something out in this department, but alas no, and what you get are some very subtle sweet malts, candied sugars, some alcohol notes, and maybe some fruits. It smells like a weak trippel or Belgian blonde. The taste is sweet malts again, medium bodied, creamy consistency, a little pepperish snap in there, but it fades as the beer warms. There is a malty, caramel flavor more than anything else that I detect. There might be some currant flavors, but they are pretty far down on the taste-o-meter. There is a slightly lingering aftertaste, but not from the hops, more from the candied sugars and the yeasts. If you let it hang on the tongue for awhile, you might get some pine resin hoppiness, but you have to really search for it. Not a bad beer, one I would drink again, but why is this one priced so high?"
"Overall: This beer isn't the hoppiest Belgian IPA that I've had, nor is it particularly hoppy. The hops are noticeable, but are dominated by the fruity characteristics. Despite this, I'm giving the beer high marks because it's very enjoyable even though the name may be a misnomer."
"Drinkability: very enjoyable and easy to quaff big beer. This is why Allagash is a brewery that I respect - great flavors and easy drinking."
"I think that a lot of the fruitiness of this beer comes from the hops; interestingly enough the Simcoe does not taste as it does in an IPA. Some how it is much greener, not nearly as citrus-like (though that is here) and quite herbaceous. I am curios if a Belgian-type yeast strain was used here; there are definitely some phenolics & higher alcohols that could be attributed to this, or it could be some combination of warmer fermentation temperatures, alcohol and green hop notes (though I wouldn't guess so). This is certainly not nearly as hoppy as I was expecting given the description on the bottle, but it is still a nice beer that has some really interesting flavors (the wood-like almost bourbon notes are really interesting considering neither of those were involved in the making of this beer. While drinkable & even enjoyable, this beer in the end is a bit too harsh, hot and not all that well integrated. I am not sure what happened here, but Allagash can definitely do better."
"Nice body and carbonation, pretty clean and crisp... I would happily drink this if offered it in a vacuum, but otherwise? I'm disappointed."
"Drinkability: A beer very unbefitting of it's pricetag."
"Hazy amber/orange with beige foam composed of medium sized bubbles. Very good head retention and lots of longlasting, clumpy lacing. Nice aroma, particularly as it warmed - hoppy, malty, and spicy. Some earthiness, citrusy grapefruit skin, pine, grassy with a doughy, yeasty sweetness and a bit of pineapple. Solid, drying bitterness, some tannins, fruity apple with muted hop notes (pine and citrus). Some caramel sweetness. Quick finish with some lingering bitterness. Medium/full bodied with above average carbonation, very creamy texture and mild warmth. A very pleasant beer with well hidden alcohol and a unique mix of flavours. Good stuff!"
"Who is Hugh Malone? Was he a bartender on Cheers? Nah, I'm kidding, I could Google him but I'd rather just drink the beer. The interplay between hops and spicy esters forms a blended skirmish that plays out enjoyably. The ABV is plenty piggy, but it doesn't dampen the pleasing drinkable nature. Hats off to Hugh, whoever Hugh may be."
"Pours a slightly hazed reddish/brown, very thick white head forms, laces nice, decent retention. Smell is weird, sweet, vegetal, citrus, bready malt, fruits, slightly hoppy. Taste is sweet, apples, signature Allagash flavours, yeast, citrus, hoppy fruity finish, nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, easy to drink, not too bad. Smell is unimpressive but the flavour made up for it. Thanks Stan!!"
"Wow, I did not even look this up or know what to expect when going in, which is the way I prefer to try new beers. I figured another Allagash Tripel maybe with a twist. Poured a very hazy amber yellow with a huge three inch plus head of white foam. This reluctantly faded after a few minutes and left behind copious amounts of lace down the glass. Lots of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. The smell was very hoppy, which quite shocked me at first. There was the underlying base of yeast, and your typical tripel smell, but above that was this huge aroma of citrus hops, lots of orange peel and sweet tangerine aromas. Now this is what I'm talking about. The taste was superb. Lots of west coast hops in the back. Well forst great feel, smooth, light and great carbonation. Went down real easy and had the slightly fizzy feel that really makes the flavors pop. Nice bread and yeast tones, earthy grains made up the backbone of this one. Then interwovern were extremly frsh cut hops. Very nice orange and grapefruit tones. Very upfront too. The mixture of these gave it a very unique flavor I had not seen before. I actually enjoyed this much more then the other Belgian IPA I have tried. I felt there was much more hoppiness to this one. Overall this was a great great beer. I could easily see myself purchasing this again, however at 15.99 a bottle, not too often, but if you are gonna splurge this is definatly worth a try."
"The first smell is a little phenolic and medicinal. The head is creamy looking, beer is reddish and cloudy in color with lots of carbonation streaming towards the top of the chalice, the taste is odd and slightly harsh. My novice palate cannot seem to detect a hint of the simcoes used in this beer or any hops for that matter. Once, this beer starts to approach room temperature it gets much better. The beer starts to exhibit hoppy qualities (contradicting my previous statements) and is actually pretty good but I still dont know how my amateur palate feels about this Belgian IPA thing. I probably wouldnt buy this again but I will try other Allagash beers since this was my first. I think I got a really good deal because this only cost me $8.99 and I think it is supposed to retail for around $15."
"One thing I do LOVE about this beer is the name. Great combination of the history of a great brewer, and a play on words for co-humulone. I also think it's really cool that Allagash is donating a dollar from each bottle to teach others the benefits of organic farming."
"Somewhat muted orange color. Huge off white head that dissapates rather quickly. Lactic and somewhat solvent like aroma. Quite yeasty. Very malty flavor with a bready/yeasty quality. Sizeable hop presence but I was expecting a lot more. Decent enough body. Overall an ok beer but nothing really stands out. From the card I read on the shelf I was expecting a lot more hop presence. A notch above average. Urthel Hop-It blows this away."
"Certainly not within the realm of IPA, but tasty nonetheless."
"a $14.99 750ml bottle pours a slightly hazy dark amber with an off white head that dissipates quickly... i can smell hops and a little citrus if i try really hard, but mostly i smell yeasty, bready, typical good tripel smell... tastes the same, kind of like a good old tripel belgian style beer with just a little hop and malt finish... no doubt a decent brew, but i felt a little misled by what i'd been told by the brewery about what to expect... oh well... it's cool that allagash is donating $1 for every bottle sold to a foundation that educates farmers in maine about organic farming, but i feel violated on this one... sorry rob"
"D - Very rich and hoppy. Definitely a great beer to share with friends who love hops and belgian beers."
"Drinkability: Very good. Paired well with the seafood shishkabobs I was having."
"D: The abv is a little high to make this a go-to, but Allagash has managed to create another winner."
"Once again a Belgian inspired beer that also attempts to include an American hop component. I haven't tasted a one yet that delivered on the hype. Poured a dark dull amber with a flat aroma of yeast and dusty sweet malt. Tasted yeasty with a little burnt sugar, and for a brief fleeting moment I caught a hint of those ballyhooed hops - then they were gone. Sharp, piercing carbonation and a kinda foamy-like mouth feel. I just don't like reading a brewery sell-sheet about how they get all jiggy with various hopping innovations and acclaimed varietals only to come up with something that tastes like a mediocre tripel. It makes me feel misled. Especially when you pay 15 dollars for a bottle of it!"
"an interesting beer, but overall i'd say it's a swing and a miss, though a good effort. it's clear some thought went into this."
"The fruit dominates throughout, with a decent alcohol warming sensation in the finish as well as some herbaceousness, which may be the hops peeking through, though they have no bittering to speak of. An enjoyable, though odd (there's that word again...) offering from Allagash. I'm relatively new to this style, so I'm not sure if this is what they were going for or not."
"A 750ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. It was a cloudy, red/orange color with a thin head. It smelled like an IPA, floral and piney. There was a honey background to the aroma, however. The first sip resembled a tripel, but then the pine and citrus hops kicked in, and they lingered for a while. Very enjoyable. I'll have to try more of these Belgian IPAs."
"Pours a cloudy carmel,honey color with a giant tan foamy head,and I do mean GIANT. This beer has a ton of carbonation,so be careful when pouring. The smell is lighter than I expected,but I could make out sweet malt and some hops. The taste has a real fruity flavor to it,lemon,woody,corriander,and pine hops are the most dominate flavors. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing pretty well. Not a bad beer,but I expected more from Allagash and it was $19.99 a bottle."
"So what are they charging for a bottle....? What ?"
"Pours a bright, dark amber with a grapefruit (pinkish/red) tinge and a soft, dusty head covering the liquid. Wonderful nose of caramel malts, touched by Belgian fruit esters, overlaid by the tropical fruit and citrus of Simcoe hops. It's a truly lovely nose, a hybrid between an ESB and a Belgian IPA. On the palate, it's surprisingly light and quite citrusy, with a metallic edge that's pure hops. Light, graham cracker malts form the backbone for the beer. Big sweetness first off, featuring those lightly caramelly malts, but the hops present themselves throughout with that Simcoe ""sweet tropical fruit flavors with underlying bitterness"" character. Mouthfeel is quite full with carbonation -- almost overly so -- with very little in the way of alcoholic burn. Overall, this is an excellent Belgian IPA. The Simcoe hops provide for some very soft bitterness, which goes very well with the Belgian style malts and overall lesser emphasis on hop bitterness. Quite the entertaining and beguiling, complex brew. Yum."
"The beer pours a very nice amber brown color, with decent head and lacing. Not a lot in the nose, maybe some spice and citrus. On the palate the beer tastes like your rather typical Belgium brown ale, with a bit more hoppiness then normal. This was a nice enough beer, but I have to say it seemed a bit simple and one dimensional. I am surprised to see it characterized as a Belgium IPA, as the hops were not very noticeable and there was very little hoppy citrus flavor. Nevertheless, this was a pretty tasty beer, but probably not one I'll order again any time soon."
"good but the 8.5 abv is present."
"Pours a very murky orange color with a medium head of tan/off white bubbles. Aroma is very yeasty and bready with only a hint of citrus and pineapple(?). Taste is a bit oaky is this barrel aged? Yeast dominates the flavor profile. Reminds me of drinking a homebrew that was bottled too early. Hops and malt are nearly completely hidden under all the yeast, and this was not a vigorous pour. In the background, you can detect and presence of simcoe hops and some malty sweetness. Mild bitterness, again distracted by the yeast. If you have one, I would recommend ageing a bit. Right now, it is a mess."
"Poured in a Rapscallion glass, formed a 2"" beige head over the cloudy orangey amber brew. Head actually grows initially, fueled by vigorous bubbling from deep in the glass, lacing meringuey and sticky. Aroma is lightly of piney hops, with some spicy yeast adding to the show. Taste is relatively balanced, and while the moderate hoppiness is a constant throughout, in the door we find some delicate malt sweetness, coupled with light fruitiness in the middle. The hops character returns for the close to slowly but surely return to the bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost seems a bit thin, and drinkability is nice and easy. Nothing over the top here hopwise, but constructed nicely with everything working well together, which is always appreciated."
