"In any case, this is a good beer..not a GREAT beer but something I will buy again. Worth the adventure!"

"Would I recommend it? Maybe. It is not horrible, the only downfall is the booze-taste. Perhaps buy a couple of these and share between a friend or two."

"The taste is amazing, the color is good, everybody must drink this."
""
"The beer is dangerously drinkable as it drinks towards a 6-8% beer. A good balance of hoppiness, Belgian character, light malt, and a crisp finish."

"This is a very good beer with a slightly weak aroma; otherwise it is a flavorful version on a Belgium IPA.  The yeast phenolics do not overpower the hops, but instead blend to create a well-balanced taste bud stimulation.  A 10.5% abv is hard to hide but the balance between the phenolics and hop terpenes ties the ethanol up nicely – it is only hinted at by flavor and not noticeable in the aroma.  The heavy lacing and golden body make this an attractive pour as well.  Overall, if you like the style, you’d be well-advised to buy as many bottles as you can find.  If you don’t like the style, it is definitely worth your time and money to buy one bottle and try it – it may change your mind."

"O: a nice beer, different than any Belgian IPA I've had. It is sweeter and fruitier. This is a second chance review for this beer, the first time I had it it was right after enjoying a Hibernus and it didn't stack up. Now, I have enjoyed it quite a bit and it was a pleasure to enjoy this with friends."

"Decent beer. Lots of spice, fair sweetness, but a bit too dry which doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the palate."
"This is a standing ""want"" as I don't know when I'll get back to that area."
"Served in Pfriem chalic - lovely golden body with a huge sticky white froth. Really nice looking. An overall excellent beer, minus some of that green bottle tang (god damnit) - bright, orange zest, fresh cut grass, grapefruit, peach, bubblegum, belgian yeast. Great!"
""

"This is a killer version of a Belgian IPA. Quite intense for the style, yet still incredibly balanced. Keep your eye out for this if you are in the Quebec province."
""

"Might buy again, especially in the summer."

"Verdict: A nice Belgian IPA and one that I'm glad to have tried. I was able to pick this bottle up when I was in Montreal on recommendation and was not disappointed, the alcohol could be dialed back a bit and I think it would really help this beer out, otherwise the hop character is a really pleasant aspect."

"Appearance is gold and clear with generous white head and tons of spotty lacing. Nose is full of spicy Belgian yeast with mellow hop character. Faint caramel in the back and plenty of Belgian yeast and a little bit of sweetness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium body with mild carbonation. Overall, nice balance, worth a try."
"Pours a hazy yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, dry yeast and notes of green apples. In the taste, earthy, hoppy, a touch funky, and a dry green apple sweetness. A spice like bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry spice and earthy hop in the aftertaste. Hides the 10%, a mellow hop presence, but a bit saison like."
"O: The taste and scent is unparalled. The Lupulus manages to combine the best of a Saison, triple and IPA and takes the best of those styles and mingles them. The cost of this brew out on the west coast was rather high, but that doesn't compromise the overall enjoyability."
""
""
""
"Overall: no problem finishing the bottle, dangerously easy drinking for a 10% beer, and never gets boring"
"Quality, very good after dinner!"
""
"Overall, an outstanding example of a Belgian IPA. Definitely one of the best in style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was a very tasty beer. The biggest flaw I found was that there was a ridiculous amount of carbonation. I could only half-pour my glasses without them overflowing. Aside from that this beer was quite easy to enjoy and it's quite easy for me to recommend this to anybody."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Blown away by this one!"
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a fluffy white head. The nose is slightly bitter with a slight fruity sweetness and bite from the alcohol. There really is nothing special about the nose, although it seems quite refined and balanced. The beer's taste has a bold yeast presence and modestly hoppy aftertaste. Overall this is a taste beer, but I'm not sure it's quite worth the price. I found far more enjoyment in drinking bitter monk."
""
""
"Pours clear, golden in color with a large white head. Great bready malt aroma with some floral hops, citrus hops, and plenty of yeast and spice. A really great nose. The flavor is crisp and refreshing. Nice yeast to go with citrus peel, pine, and a mild herbal note. Bready malt with a touch of cracker to go with it."
"Final Grade: 4.63, my first A+. I've reviewed 300 beers now, and Dominus Vobiscum Lupulus is the best one yet. How's that for a capper? It is mouthwateringly good, with perfect balance and absurdly high drinkability for something of its heft. At over 10 bucks a bottle (and with limited availability - I had to drive to London to get this), it's not something I can get regularly, but I may just head back to procure a few more bottles before it's gone for another year. This is a must-try, combining the best of both the IPA and Belgian beer in general."
"O: This is really refreshing, well balanced, clean, and drying. It's pretty darn impressive. There is a lot of subtlety in this beer that I keep finding as it warms as I drink it. I'd love to try this beer again. Thanks Sammy."

"Believe this to be an excellent example of the Belgian IPA style."
"Clear gold body with a voluminous white head. Great retention and loads of lacing, exemplary for the style. Nose has herbal Noble hops, tropical fruits, and some orange. A bit of sulphur as well I think. Still quite vibrant for what I've been used to recently within the style. Taste has a sweet fruity malt component almost reminiscent of a Belgian golden strong at points, before being cut but a tropical hop profile and some bitter citrus rind. Long and significantly drying herbal finish. Full feel with a medium high effervescence and some alcohol. A very nice Belgian IPA, but a bit too bitter for regular and mass consumption in my eyes."
"I really love this style and this is a great example. The hops and yeast play well together: I can clearly identify both, but they also mix in a delicious fugue."
"Quite sweet to taste up front and just enough bitterness at the finish. Belgian type character up the middle. Tastes better at just below room temp than cold as the beer is better able to show itself off. Just a bit too much sweetness at the front end of this one, but quite good overall and worth a try."
"A great continental IPA. Seek this out if you get the chance, very balanced and rich tasting."
"Overall: This is a great beer for sure. I could see some of the flavours and smells popping a little more in the aroma and taste, but the apparence and mouthfeel are totally nailed. If it wasn't so hard to come by, well, I'd be drinking it more often. If you're looking for a fresh take on a Belgian style, this is it!"
"Pale blonde colour 3 fingers of dense white head, lots of lace stuck to the glass. Smell is of citrus fruit and candy apple, floral and vibrant with a huge hop profile, spicy belgian yeast works well with all the hop aromas, malt with some more citrus, grapefruit, orange and tangerine. Taste has a nice semi-dry spiciness too, more of the giant hop bill on the palate, yeasty, light sweet points, with citrus and tropical fruit flavours. Medium drying carbonation, medium to full body, nice consistency from the yeast and oils. Great stuff here, truly a treat to drink, ABV of 10% nowhere close to present."
"O: Pretty disjointed imo, and very sweet, with high IBU, strange and unbalanced..."
""
"Pours a hazy golden yellow/orange colour with a large amount of head. Tastes of lemon and grassy notes, with a slight floral hop bite finish in there. Considering the high percentage, it drinks down pretty smooth and you don't pick up the booze in the taste at all. This brewery makes some real quality beers."
""
""
"O - a world class brew with a unique style - really blown away by this brew and definitely worth it even at $11. If you see it, buy three."
"Drinks amazingly easily for a 10% abv brew. I might find this awesome if it were finished a bit drier. And I would like to try it with a little less bottle age on it as well."
"Light to medium bodied with an abundance of soft, pillowy carbonation. It feels smooth, creamy, velvety, and light in the mouth. This is one hell of beer - full of bold flavours held in a delicate balance, and being so strong yet drinking as easy as a beer half it's strength. It's like the angels themselves fermented the essence of heaven and bottled it. Dangerous and very delicious."
""
""
"A sensational brew. Even though it runs at about 11 bucks, I will happily go back for more of this. Great example of the style and another winner from Charlevoix!"

"O- This is good, it's refreshing, bitter and juicy all in one great bottle."
"No knowledge of Latin is needed to understand the word of this saintly brewer; Dominus Vobiscum Lupulus translates to the ""The Lord be With You, Hops"" both figuratively as well as literally. It is a divine creation that brims with angelic fruits, blissful pungency, anointed yeast, and heavenly drinkability. It is true holy water if ever there was. Amen."
"Again I'll say it - Microbrasserie Charlevoix is the best microbrewery in Quebec. I would recommend. this to anyone."

"Overall: A pretty unique beer with some atypical characteristics. There are some things about it that I really liked, and some that were so-so. The flavor wasn't really in my wheelhouse, but I can see how some would like it."
"Overall. Just a fabulous looking beer. I can't say belgian style IPAs are my thing, but this one is pretty nicely done."

"Beer is an attractive hazy golden color with a creamy, ivory-colored head. Aroma is a melange of yeast, citrus, hops, and malt. Taste is assertive and malty up front -- with almost sweet yeastiness and a pleasant heaviness. Finish is hoppy and citrus, not too dry. Mouthfeel is substantial with some nice alcohol warming. Overall, this is a big, solid beer. A nice fusing of a quebec-style belgian ale with an IPA-esque hoppy edge."
""
"Bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a very lively white head. Big sticky left on the glass as the head settles. Soft aroma of fruit and spice. Some must. Very soft on the palate. Peach, apricot, and pear flavor are really nice. Really nice and flavorful. Easy drinking."
"M - Medium body with a good chew. Light carbonation."
"This is a really fantastic beer. Really enjoyable. Maybe my favourite Canadian beer. A gem!"
"Overall, this was a good beer. I really liked the nose. A bit dry. Decent drinkability."
"Brilliantly clear light golden yellow with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is spicy, yeasty, honey-like, floral, grassy, mildly rustic and has a prominent Saaz hop character. Very fruity, this is brilliant. The palate opens a little sweeter than I'd like, with honey, grainy sweetness, sugar, a little bit of Splenda. A real hop tea flavor is present on the mid-palate, with a ton of Saaz flavor. Sweet but with a lingering hop resin character, Saaz tea, there is also a touch of butter, earth and yeast flavors. Medium light in body, moderately carbonated, this beer has an excellent finish with a lingering resiny hop character. Highly recommended."
"HV"
"Overall - Wonderful combination of flavors. A little drier and less sweetness and this would be spot on."
"OVERALL: This is a solid brew, but didn’t think it was as complex or as interesting a Belgian IPA as Hibernus was a Strong Dark Ale. I enjoyed this one more than the others in the group did, but don’t think I’d seek it out again like I would Hibernus. Thanks again Freud for hooking us up with these ones!"
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style and carbonation is above average. Overall it was a very nice beer with some great flavors. It had some great balance for the style which really helped soften the sometimes overpowering yeast spice. The citrusy, bitter flavors really worked for me as well in this one and they really integrated well into the overall flavor. Very well made and taste beer overall, I'd definitely put it up there with any of the Belgian made versions of the style I've had."
"Overall: Really dug this one. Just as authentic & good as ales from Belgium, maybe better. Worth the hype for this world-class beer."
"Overall I just could not get into the groove of this beer. I am usually a big fan of Belgian IPAs, but there was just something about this one that did not sit well with me. Perhaps a fresher bottle may have been a bit more to my liking. It was definitely worth trying though."
"Poured a hazy medium copper color with a large frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate sour citrus and yeast aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Very good brew."
"A fantastic beer. Way to go Alex!!!"
"O: Love it! It lived up to the hype and I am glad I can get more of this asap!"
"O/D - No alcohol at all. Lovely flavour. More like a Tripel. Very nice. I liked this alot and I'm looking forward to aging it. Well done Charlevoix."
"Beer is thin to medium in body, minimal carbonation in the mouth but a pretty good Belgian IPA overall. The beer is nice and sweet with good esters and nice hop flavors on the midpalate of the beer. The overall experience is nice with moderate bitterness on the finish. I really enjoyed this beer a lot."
"I would gladly put this in the top 5 beers I've ever had and I'm happy to say that it's from Canada. Worth every penny and then some. This is a must try."
"Drinkability on this isn't very high. With the size of the bottle it's more of a sharing beer. Not to mention the high abv. All-in-all it's an intriguing ale, but not something I'd want to drink on a regular occasion or more than one at a time."
"i was lucky enough to have this in the same stretch as the duvel triple hop and must say that this is a bit more broad. the interesting thing is that it has a healthy abv interaction. its not noticeable but it does have subtle hints that make it more pleasant. it just as brisk as a duvel would be. there is fruits in this one. golden clear with a wonderful cauliflower head... but the pop gave way to a pilsner hop/malt quality that was undeniable. this was almost momentary though. this quickly opened up into something more. acidic notes of triple like esters. fruit qualities of persimmon and sour earthy hints. palate was a hint of sweet with a sour white grape and a floral earthiness that first gave way to rosemary then a mineral hop quality that make me think of the grit of straw. palate as it warms has hints of lychee but with a significantly more bitter note than that i came across in the hill farmstead E. this has almost a chalky note to it. which dries any quality of elixir sugar the 10abv sweetness could provide. on the spectrum of palate range this is a lot of flavors that seem to come into the palate very pin point but expand violently as it is experience by whom which ever. brings on an appetite too."
"With an over-the-top creaminess this beer is an absolute joy to drink. Its crisp and refreshing, and has a lot of body as well. Overall, if this beer wasn't so damn expensive I'd buy this every time I drink beer. Which is obviously quite often. Everyone should try this - not just fans of the style."
"Clear amber-gold with a huge white cap that leaves webbed lacing. Beautiful beer. Smells green, herbal, spicy. White pepper and fresh cut herbs, pale crackery malt. Tastes really, really nice. Ripe pear, white pepper, cut grass and fresh herbs. Very hoppy but evenly balanced between yeast, malt and hops. Finishes intensely dry and spicy. Fantastic stuff."
"A special, special thanks to flipper2gv both for the patience and the understanding. A true gentleman!"
"Mouthfeel was good - very dry, highly carbonated, and medium bodied."
"Drinkability: Smooth and clean, this is as balanced as any Belgian IPA I have had."
"Drink - The look of the bottle and the beer once poured was truly fantastic. I would suggest sharing this bottle among friends and there is quite a bit of sweetness to it and 750ml might be a bit much for one person."
"Great beer from one of the best microbrewery."
"This is exactly what I look for in a Belgian IPA, it is spicy and moderately bitter with a big fruity hop kick, though they could have dry hopped it a bit more."
"I think Belgian IPA is the perfect label for this beer. Much too hoppy to be a tripel. IMO Glory."
"WS"
"This is an amazingly drinkable beer for the size - the alcohol is not discernible in the flavour, though I do start to feel the effects half way through the bottle. Quaffable, though I recommend you don't. I'm really loving this brew, I think it has really come together nicely. It would be interesting to see how the belgian qualities take over with a year or two of age (as a blurb on the bottle suggests). Fresh, this is a beautiful beer, among the nicest I've had the chance to try."
"D - i love the idea of the Belgian IPA, and the execution here is fantastic, high octane with the hops being big enough to shine in the face of strong belgian flavour characteristics"
"D- An easy drinker for 10% abv. This grew on me as it warmed, wasn't all that impressed initially, but another nice offering from one of Canada's best breweries."
"My first Belgian IPA, and I wasn't sure what to expect. All in all very drinkable, and more Belgian Tripel then American IPA."
"D - Hard to drink for me due to the taste. If you like Duvel, you should seek this one out."
"A very good and tastey beer worth getting a hold of. Doing Canada proud."
"A unique hoppy Belgian Strong Pale Ale, which even flirts with some elements of a Saison at times - worth trying if you can obtain it, though there may be better options for less money in the ""Belgian IPA"" category."
"D - Is it worth the price? I found La Chouffe's offering much better than this, with a lower price tag. By no means a disappointment, but the there's better value to be had elsewhere. An honorable and tasty offering, but it produced less of experience than I was hoping for."
"d - A really nice Belgian IPA. Some nice Belgian spice and fruit. Would try again."
"I wasn't sure what kind of Belgian Pale I was getting with this 70 IBU beer. I thought it would be more like The Bruery's Mischief, but instead it's more in the lines of an authentic Belgian IPA, or ever De Dolle's Ara Bier. I say go for it, but expect something a little different."
"D: My first from Charlevoix, and I'm quite impressed. Belgian at its core, but with a lot of North American flair, a great hybrid."
"This is a great beer, no doubt. A little high on the sweetness but everything about it is tasty."
"D - Fantastic. Was this beer 10% Drank like a fine champagne and gets you just as buzzed just as quickly. Dangerous in that sense, yet a fantastic beer."
"D: Very drinkable all around. Big thanks again to viggo; super glad that I was able to get a bottle of this."
"An all-around GREAT brew."
"My kind of strong Belgian ale - low on the overtly astringent yeastiness, big on the spicy fruit and organic esters, just hoppy enough to further the aim of balance, and a nice round 10 points of alcohol to boot, for which you'd need an experienced bloodhound to track down their whereabouts. Bravo, once again, Charlevoix!"
"Overall a near perfect example of a strong pale, I would be hard pressed to find one better then this. Go seek this out, worth every penny."
"Truly outstanding work from one of the best brewers in Canada, and I'd say North America."
"A wonderful ale and far too drinkable for 10% - nothing is too harsh or overpowering."
"Kudos to Charlevoix for bringing this back and living up to expectations, this is a terrific beer. I wouldn't want to drink too much as the 10% sneaks up on you but it's quite refreshing for such a big beer. Big thanks to Colin for cracking this one!"
"D - This is dangerously drinkable. It blew both the Inferno and Avery Salvation I had at the Hopleaf beer dinner immediately afterward out of the water. The bitterness is there, but it's not brash, and the heat only makes the slightest presence about halfway through the 750ml bottle. A must-try."
"Bottle. Nice appearance gold-copper pour with frothy white head. Aroma is pretty complex; belgian yeast, pineapple, orange peel, flowers and pepper. Nice intense flavors with lots of hops, grapefruits, herbs and a tropical fruits fnish. Mouthfeel is quite full with well balanced carbonation. Great beer."
"Um, nailed it? Charlevoix pretty much did that with this hoppy strong Belgian Pale, if this is what it's like young then it's going to age in a phenomenal fashion. I could very easily drink this all day (yet not get anything done as a result while it ends in tears...). Worth the price of admission, and even though I was surprised to find that it comes only in ""family"" size, I'm more than happy for that and all the extra goodness I got as a result."
"I was looking forward to this for a long time and it definitely didn't let me down. The numbers I gave Lupulus just made it my highest-rated beer and I don't disagree with that at all. This beer is easily world-class. Thanks Charlevoix!"
"I'm stoked on this beer it's something special, after watching it soar up the Canadian top 25 I assumed there was a little hype involved but I was wrong thinking that. well deserving of its place in the Canadian top 10 and I would guess it will settle in the top 5. let it be known this isn't even my favorite beer from this brewer, think about that"
"Pours a pale yellow with a huge cloudy white head. The head doesn't seem to want to go away, with lacing all down the glass. It smells of floral hops, citrus and Belgian yeast. The taste lives up to the smell. Nice bitterness in with the classic Belgian pale ale taste. Some caramel and hoppiness. Very smooth mouthfeel, with the bubbles being very tight. I don't notice the alcohol in this, which I suppose could be dangerous because I could drink this all day if I was able to get enough bottles."
"Overall, the 2007 bottle lost all its bitterness that I liked so much in the 2009 bottle. Maybe it is due to 2 different versions, I don't know. I didn't drank a fresh 2007 bottle and I'm not sure I will cellar a 2009..."
"drinkability is great. great balance. not terribly deep or complex, but better than most in its style. good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied, pretty chewy, with high but fine carbonation. Really feels good and goes down way too smooth for the ABV, no alcohol comes through at all. This is great stuff, I see the reputation is deserved. This is like a hoppier La Fin du Monde."
"Well, a GREAT americanized version of a strong Belgian pale, this brew is extremely balanced and has a great great taste. Definitely one of my favorite all time brew and I'm an Imperial Stout guy. Very very impressive!!"
"Wow. This just made it into my favorite beers. I absolutely want to try and clone this one some day..."
"Bottle- Deep golden pour unleashes a beautiful frothy white cap, leaving plenty of lace. Spicy, fruity nose hints at rose petal and fresh hops, with lots of citrus and a blast of cotton candy. Smells good. I don't really like the sweetness here, but the flavour profile is still pretty good. Sweet mango and apple with yeasty flavours lead to spices and candied malts. The hops don't come through in the flavour the way they were calling at me in the aroma. Pretty good beer to be sure. A bit over-hyped though."
"A bottle brought down from Jean of Quebec City. Had it previously just after it was released in '07 - very fresh and extremely aromatic then. This bottle had mellowed to the point of faded hop glory, but malt profile was still plenty sturdy and the alcohol nearly invisible - had become very sneaky for 10%. Retained a puffy, long-lasting head and the aroma, although muted, was still inviting. Highly-hopped, this beer gains no benefit from aging if you are a hop-head, but is still enjoyable if the balance more toward the malt end is preferred. Hardly any available now, so enjoyed it for its rarity at this point."
"Drinkability is off the charts. You would be hard pressed to find a better representation of the style. Period. I'd definitely never have had the chance to taste this had it not been for my main man Phil."
"Bright gold w/ 2 fingers of foamy white head. Lots of orange aromas with light notes of dried spices like coriander, plus some leafy parsley. Palate is super bright and spicy right off. Drying yeast and hop bitterness on the finish. Flavors of orange and light mango, white pepper and spiciness. Not a lot of hop flavor left in this beer. Long finish with a touch of drying mint."
"This is a complex and delicious beer. One of the best I've had in a while. Highly recommended, if you can still find it."
"Notes from: 6/27/08"
"Thanks to Beersignal for the hard to find bottle!"
"Had again summer 2012 and shows itself as popular, sweet fruity drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yeasty, estery, and fruity."
"Thanks to wetherel for sharing this rarity at the RBSG 08 Grand Tasting. Poured into my La Chouffe goblet. Clear gold with a white head that leaves incredible lacing. Aroma is spicy dough with raisins and citrus. Flavor is, again, spicy dough with notes of citrus, grass, apricot, and banana. Pretty weird but very tasty. A little alcohol on the palate, but otherwise smooth."
"All around a great beer."
"Very nice presentation. Pourred in a ball-like glass (Fin du monde) and revealled an hazy light amber colour with a THICK creamy/foamy white head. Head so thick that temper down the smell, but still revealing lots of spices, earth and yeast smell comes afterward. Still young and should be cellered for a while. Should handle long cellearing (5-10 years)if you can wait that long!"
"Wowza, this beer really opens up as it breaths and you get to know her. I had to kick up the numbers twice as I sipped, and I'm only finishing my first glass."
"Bottle: Poured a deep lightly cloudy golden color ale with a huge pure white foamy head with perfect retention and some great lacing. Aroma of West Coast hops with some notes of citrus and grapefruit and some nice floral notes can also be detected. Taste is perfect balance between some light sweet Belgian malt with huge notes of floral hops with notes of grapefruit. Full body with a somewhat creamy texture with some great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I really enjoyed how the hops presence brought aromatic notes but left a light controlled bitterness. As much as I had enjoyed the Chouffe Houblon I believe this one is even more enjoyable."
