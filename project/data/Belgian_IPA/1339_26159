3.86,-1.5,3.25,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Pours a finger of sudsy white head, fades rather fast with no lacing. Cloudy and straw yellow. Some particles floating around. Smells of malt and cloves, with hints of banana and bread dough. Tastes quite malty, with a tropical fruit following, mostly pineapple. Lingering hoppy bitterness. Mouth feel is astringent and lightly syrupy, with a medium-heavy body. Higher carbonation, leaves tingling sensation on tip of tongue. Overall, an interesting beer, a little off-balance, but decently complex and enjoyable. For the price, would not buy very often.","sporklift87","Mar 10, 2015"

3.92,0,3.75,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,"Tried this classic Belgian IPA on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary, 12 oz. as memory serves. A burnished gold color with a slight reddish tint and a finger or so of white foam. Surprisingly fruity aroma with the requisite dose of Belgian yeasty spice, although to my sniffer the hops steal the show ... Some toffee and whiskey notes underneath gummy bears, nectarine, orange, pineapple, kiwi, clove. Sweet for the style despite the hoppy power on the nose. I get a healthy dose of cantaloupe and butterscotch with some pine needles to complement the clove-like medicinal burn. It is indeed bitter but the butterscotch and fruit elements really dial this aspect down for me. The complexity on the nose does not quite translate perfectly onto the palate but I'm not really complaining. Some alcohol detectable on nose and palate. Body on the high end of medium, with mellow gentle carbonation. Quite a nice brew that I would seek out again. My impression does not jive that well with the written impressions of the masters like Micheal Jackson, who emphasize the bitterness. Aw well. Gustatory impressions differ across tasters, and these guys probably haven't blasted their taste buds with modern DIPAs to the extent I have. YMMV.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 25, 2014"

Urthel Hop-It should be considered well worth a try for any fan of Belgian beers looking for something with more of a bitter, grassy hop bite than usual. As a bonus, the price point in this market ($3.25 / 330 mL) is outstanding, making it the most affordable example of its style by a comfortable margin. If you're a hophead or Belgian beer fan, you'd be remiss in passing up the opportunity to grab a few bottles while it's available locally.","thehyperduck","Jun 15, 2014"

The nose comprises melon rind, grass, grapefruit peel, light honey, lemon zest, and a small tinge of light caramel. The taste brings in more of the same, though the grass is the real star of the show now. This adds a bunch of chlorophyll, as well as a stronger-than-usual sting of bitterness, mostly rind-based. It's a bit much for me, but luckily not too much altogether. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall a pretty nice BIPA, just a bit far into bitter territory for my tastes.","TMoney2591","Dec 31, 2011"

As much as the alcohol is in the nose, I'm nervous about how well its going to be hidden. The feel is medium with plenty of tingly carbonation. The taste is okay, the alcohol is pretty present as I feared. The taste is of grainy malts, a little hops, a long dry finish with a lingering alcohol after taste. To be honest I from the few Belgian IPAs I've tried, I prefer the ones made in America over the ones made in Belgium, I don't think they're used to the West Cost style of an insane amount of hops, this is much closer to an English IPA and is far less hoppy than even an American Pale Ale.","DavidST","Jul 15, 2011"

Very little sweetness from the malt profile, but there's a nice crispness to it. A hint of funk. Good stuff.

There is toasty sweetness and hop bitterness playing all over your palate, and the alcohol comes in late and pretty much cleans up the whole mess. All this said, I like the Samaranth better as it is more blatant alcohol mixed with malt and other characteristics. As it is, this beer does well for what it is supposed to be, so if you like Pale Ales in general, run to the store to give this a try as it is a quality brew.

Hard on the first sip but then balances with a light-to-medium body comprised of some sour fruits that give off a mild vinous taste (white grape, orange) and there is some spicy clove. Some sweet caramel malt balances beer with sticky sweetness in backend and the hops are mild but everpresent and lead to a smooth, slightly dry finish.

Taste starts out a bit uninspiring, some vague fruitiness, before a nice hop bitterness takes over. I wish there was a bit more there to balance the beer. But it avoids being cloying or too hoppy.

I just have an 11.2 oz. bottle, and though it's only half gone, I can feel the alcohol just beginning to creep. I've had beers at similar ABVs that were definitely more drinkable, and others that were less.

Luminescent cloudiness to the full orange color, only moderate fade to yellow further out from the core. Earthy nose, thickly constructed out of spices particularly solid cloves, raw baker's dough, day old orange peels, the hops like a wet forest floor, pungent yet more verdant than sharp, some banana among the apricot and pear scents, the nose is sugary but it still comes off as more sweet than dry. Full-bodied, the carbonation shouldn't be any more aggressive than it is, the beer was made to soak into the tongue. More floral here with more oomph in the orange, lemon citrus as well. However, that earthy, herbal component sets the overall tone, even pushing back the hard toffee, banana, golden raisin, apricot, fig flavors.

3.79,-3.3,5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Appeared orange-golden with a monstrous, and I mean monstrous, frothy head and excellent lace retention. This is a beautiful looking beer. The aromas were somewhat tart, and centered primarily on citrus juices and lemon rind with some strong floral notes. To be honest this beer smelled closer to a standard Belgian Blond Ale than I had expected. The hops were not a huge player in the aroma, and seemed to come through mainly in the bitterness of the citrus rind. The taste was a completely different story. Bold flavors of pine and orange peel mingled up front, fading into a bright, lemony woodiness with tons of sticky resin and just a touch of honey sweetness. Black pepper comes through on the back end and lingers and lingers; the only hint of this beer's strength. Feels dry, but with a resin-laden silkiness. Drinkability is good, but this beer sneaks up on you and, when you least expect it, slaps you across the face with 9.5% ABV. The alcohol is very well hidden and only perceivable in the peppery after taste (like WAY after). A nice change, I really like experimental beers.","jletts","0"

Decent carbonation lends a creamy mouthfeel, with an initial hue of lemon that slowly fades to reveal a hoppy bitterness that lingers for quite some time, sitting pretty heavily on the tongue, asking for it to be recycled at the back of your mouth for many minutes.

The good: A good malt backbone, a good amount of hops, and a solid bitterness. The Bad: The hops are a bit too resiny in my opinion and, when combined with the substantial alcohol presence, they take on a medicinal character that is out of style and unwelcome. Good mouthfeel, medium-full body with a moderate amount of carbonation yields a very creamy brew. Definite alcohol presence.

It was thick with lots of carbonation, and a lasting bitter/sour aftertaste with some alcohol warming. Overall this was a very unique beer. I'm not sure if I liked it or not, but it certainly had a complex and interesting scent and flavor. It was pretty clean, but was more of a sipping beer due to the extreme flavors.

Green apple and pear play nicely with the belgian yeast's funky, earthy flavor, and all are visited by a peppery, pine apple and citrus note. Nothing is overbearing and the champagne like mouthfeel helps dry the finish and keeps me going back for more. The scary part is the 9.5% abv. That number alone would tell someone that this is a sipper, however this beer can be drank by the mouthful without a second thought.

Aromas are full of tripel like esters, light clove and citrus, a little funk and a blanket of noble hop notes, floral and spicy. It basically smells like a hopped up Duvel. On the palate, the Belgian blonde flavors really dominate and it finishes with a dose of Hallertau-like hop flavor and a firm bitterness (but nothing in the realm of AIPAs). Carbonation is medium high and with a moderate body. This is the first BIPA I've had, and I have to say it's really a creative style, fusing two other styles I really like and doing it well.

Wow, this sets the standard for the style in my mind. The aroma is citrus up front with orange and lemon peel coming out. There is also a slight hint of breadiness that finishes with just a bit of spice from the yeast. The taste is hoppy and the spiciness comes out and reminds me of pepper on my tongue. A slight alcohol comes out in the finish of the beer. The mouthfeel reminds me of a DIPA. The mouthfeel of this beer is full, thick and it coats your mouth with a mild bitterness.

Sour fruits make for a slightly tangy and a bit of a winy experience. Carbonation is active, and really opens things up on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied.

Monster lacing effects, some 3D, that fade like an ice cream float. Many tiny (itsy-bitsy) suspended particles reveal themselves as you venture downward further and further. Really quite a show. The smell has a nice bright crisp lemon fruity character that dominates the earthy yeast notes below. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is refreshing and light. More or less a hoppy tripel or in other words a tripel with attitude! Scores serious points for passion and imagination. Full flavored, the taste is bright with a fruity citrus note. Moderately spicy and full of hops, finishes on the dry side with a unique and complex fruity yeasty after taste that lingers nicely. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden. Best when considered in an 'off centered' alternate to the ""best pint glass"" and in the comfort of a poofy recliner. A lot going on with this one, quite a hoot!

Bubble-gum flavor with fresh pines, hops, fruit, and perhaps a bitter of coriander and spices with a honey and cream taste... exquisite, top-notch taste... I could drink this all night...mouthfeel was like butter... light, full-of-flavor, rich, with a nice sprucy, bubbly feel... overall easy drinkability and the 9.5% ABV is only slightly noticeable behind a wonderful cornucopia of rich, satisfying flavors... hands down, one of the better brews I've ever sampled... great stuff... looking forward to sampling other beers from this terrific brewery...

The head is a decent tight white head that left some real nice lacing on my Chimay glass. The taste is typical Belgian. Some nice barn yard funk, like a saison; some nice Belgian candi sugar, like a BSPA. It also has a tart apple aroma. The taste starts off with palt malt and candi sugar which is quickly followed by a wave of corriander. There is a light, light bitter hop. Also, there is a noticable fusel alcohol flavor. The feel is moderate and quite fizzy, the finish is on the sweeter side. Definitely a very nice golden Belgian brew. The hops really aren't there. Not sure if this brew needs a 9.5% ABV, which definitely limits the drinkability. Would like to try a side by side with Piraat.

Two of my favorite styles on the table! I took it out from a 42deg fridge, let it set in room temp for 30 min and popped the cork! That's where my excitement started to dwindle. Poured a hazy butterscotch color with a ridicules amount of tiny white bubble into a Duvel tulip glass. Don't get me wrong, I love a good head, but this was quite the over load. I literally had 6 inches of tight ice cream like head for every 1oz of beer I poured. I had to wait 5 minutes for the ball of foam to ""produce"" a mouthful of liquid. Smells much more of a banana cream, triple Belgian ale concoxion than an IPA. I don't like the way the beer is balanced between the creamy sweetness and the hoppy bitterness.

First sip was belgian yeasty and some bitterness on the finish, Left a medicinal taste in my mouth-very earthy. I decided to let this warm for a whole and was very happy after about 10 minutes. The hops really came though to balance the sweet malt. Good citrus and spice flavors all the way through and the yeasty/earthy flavor faded into the background, but did not disappear altogether.

Hop character disappears as soon as the beer starts to warm up. This has a typical citrus hop and pale malt flavors of good blonde triples.

By the mid point, things change a bit and the hops really do kick in it becomes more of a tangy vanilla cream and slightly bitter ale. There is a rather prodigious aftertaste that does compromise the drinkability. As for the alcohol content, I would not have known this was a whopping 9.5 ABV unless I looked closely at the bottle.

This is mixed with some bready pale malts and honey. Alcohol lets itself be known, but it really just helps to round it all out. Slight peach and banana esters come out as well. Lots of honey sweetness kicks off the flavor as it intermingles with light, crackery malts. Some white grape leads into a hop profile that is at once floral and fruity. I don't know what kind of hops they are using, but I'm getting big jasmine notes (the best kind). The sweetness continues on toward the finish, where the spotlight is taken up by some mild warming alcohol and a little dry closer. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, but leans just a touch to the fuller side of things. Carbonation is vibrant, but not violent. Delicious beer, but the overall sweet character and hefty ABV keep the drinkability down just the slightest.","goochpunch","Sep 23, 2007"

The mouth is very prickly and slightly syrupy, leaving a bit of residue on the tongue. The opening taste is mildly sweet and fruity, followed by a slow crescendo of spicey, then espresso, then acrid hops, culminating in a very dry, very crisp aftertaste of bitter.

The earthy and yeasty notes which are upfront in the aroma are in the background in the taste. They are nearly covered up by a green, resiny, hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is slightly ligher than medium bodied, with nice carbonation. Overall, it is as if the normal flavors of a Belgian ale and the hops are at war with one another, and, like in all war, everyone is the loser. Nothing in this beer seems to be in harmony with anything else. A fellow BA once said, ""I can tell you if a beer is made well, and I can tell you if I like it.""

On the palate, the hops are quite present for a Belgian brew but middling to my American palate. Initially, the palate is rather sweet. It doesn't dry out until the finish. That's not necessarily a bad thing, either, but in this case the sweetness of the beer detracts a bit from the hop notes. Drinks well, especially for a high ABV beer.

Some mild grapefruit hops, just a little earth soil, and a light mix of fresh baked bread and mild orange citrus. The flavor has a lot of citrus up front, kind of a simcoe mandarin orange, but its much softer than most simcoe beers. The earthiness extends into the finish of the beer where I also find just a touch of spicy heat, maybe a little white pepper. Slick, and mildly smooth mouth feel. Nice drinkability.

The cork was extremely anxious to come out, essentially coming out on its own, and then proceeding to foam over. The first pour delivers a RIDICULOUSLY huge head - my full tulip has only a half an inch of beer in the bottom. It takes a good 30 minutes to get the head to reduce enough to leave me with a half-full glass, and because of the dense head, I could tease it to 3 fingers above the rim of the glass. The beer is an unfiltered golden/amber with low carbonation, but becomes highly carbonated after some swirling and the white head is big, creamy, sticky, and incredibly dense - I can tilt the tulip to almost horizontal and the head doesn't budge. As I drink, an amazing amount of foam sticks to the glass - as much as 3/4"" of an inch thick, making a gaze into the glass seem like a glimpse into a foam cavern. It smells of hops, juicy apples, medicinal/perfumy phenols, some fruits and a spiciness. Hop-It has a big bitterness with sharp esters and perfumy phenols, grapefruit/grassy/spicy/raw hops and hops oils, lemon rind, coriander?, apple cider, watermelon, pear, light mustiness and spiciness, and sweet malts that appear near the end.

The yeast characteristics and hop flavors meld together seamlessy, very difficult to tell where one ends and the next begins. Tremendously well balanced. Finishes dry with spicy pepper.

This one was all that, but was nicely balanced by a great hop spice. Im told this is a Belgian interpretation of the American IPA style.

As the beer warmed, the flavors came together and blended into a much more pleasing taste. Mouthfeel was medium in body, and somewhat drying.

Nice balance between the Belgian yeast characteristics and the malts and hops. (I had to go back and change the flavor rating its really growing on me). Good mouthfeel-quite bright on the palate-lingering bitterness. Very, very drinkable beer indeed. Well worth enjoying by hop heads, Belgian fans and just plain beer fans. Very impressive.","lackenhauser","Jun 02, 2006"
4.33,10.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"About 10 seconds after I took the cage off the 750mL the cork exploded out of the bottle without my touching it. After my heart stoped racing and I cleaned my pants I got into this beer. Amazing head. Light cream colored with a creamy texture it held itself aloft about half an inch above the top of the glass. Almost transparent golden beer shows little of the carbonation that expelled the cork and produced a four finger head. Did I mention the lace? It's all over the place. The aroma is hard to describe. Faintly sweet with spicy floral notes. That's kind of a simple description, but you'll have to try it for more details. A little bit of sweet caramel malt on top of some candied grapefruit and a kind of grass spiciness from the hops. A little bitter in the finish, but nothing you can't handle. Fluffy mouthfeel makes for a smooth experience. My only complaint is that the carbonation just won't stay in the beer. Second pour (beer was cool to room temp.) produced about half an inch of beer and four inches of head, which is more like a foam barrier to the beer. I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I bought this beer, but it is plenty interesting. I dig the flavor and as it warms there is a yeasty flavor that appears. At $9a 750mL I probably won't be drinking it all that often, but maybe that's a good thing.","HappyHourHero","May 29, 2006"

It had that signature Belgian fruit/spice/yeast flavor, but more hopped up, and some crisp citrus notes. The high ABV was definitely apparent in the taste, but what else would you expect from freakin 9.5%? Pretty awesome lacing action too - the head was clinging to the inside of the glass for dear life, I've never seen a beer lace like that before - hence the 5.0 for appearance.

Head stuck around a good ten minutes before subsiding leaving behind tattered lacing. Aromas of grassy hops, grain husk, light must and moderate fusels. Slightly phenolic. Certainly hoppy for a Belgian, with a lingering bitterness akin to APA. Very strong, yet the higher hopping level seems to mask it well. A fair bit of biscuity malt sweetness to keep it well-rounded. A little too strong to be good sessioner, but a couple will do you right. A nicely constructed ale that's right up there with some of my other favorite Belgian pales.","crookedhalo","Apr 10, 2006"

A combination of malt, spice, Belgian candi sugar, yeast and citrus. This beer had a very rich, creamy mouthfeel and was quite easy to drink. The 9.5% abv stated on the bottle was barely noticeable.

Flavor is nicely bitter up front with citric hops and a yeasty malt doughiness. Nice notes of sweet fruits in the middle with some spicy hops finish up the taste. Pretty damn thick and full body with perfect carbonation. Extremely drinkable beer to me. I had no clue it was almost 10% till I was done with the beer and was looking over the bottle.

There is a hop bitterness that excedes any other Belgian I have tried, but not in an overpowering/puckering type of way that the most bitter American beers are characterized by. The bitterness is consistent from the moment it hits the toungue to when it goes down. It is countered by spiciness and a slight sweetness that.

A sharp and sudden hop bittering hits in the back of the throat, contributing an earthy, grassy flavor the presents itself primarily in the finish.

The lemony and orange citrus is much stronger, with a subdued banana ester. Over this is a nice spicey and herbal noble hop, with a moderate to strong bitter on the finish that is relaly clean. Feel is thick with a lighter to moderate carbonation of small bubbles that gives it a good velvety smoothness. Overall, this is an enjoyable beer.

3.78,-3.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Slightly hazed darkish gold appearance, good styrofoam-like rocky head of almost an inch and of decent duration. Lots of puffy laces grip the glass. Caramel malt and sweet orange hops dominate the aroma. Mouthfeel comes out as sub-medium, carbonation is high and quite bubbly. For its hops claims, this one leans on the malt -- candy corn and some candi sugar aspects. Attenuates with some bitterness in a dryly leafy manner. A little gaseous at the close. Not a bad brew, not particularly hoppy or dry, in a lot of ways its seems to be another rendition of a Duvel clone in the slightly too sweet manner that's more typical of some North American brewers. Good drinkability.","ADR","Oct 03, 2005"

Many thanks, Hildegard, keep on brewin'...or, should I say, ""Pache'!""","feloniousmonk","0"
