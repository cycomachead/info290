"O: This is supposed to be the hoppiest beer in Belgium but the hops are there as much for flavor as for bitterness. The bitterness is rounded and not harsh. Very easy to drink."

"Dry  bitter light bodied with a touch of flavor"
"Belgian aroma, bitter taste = Belgian IPA"
""
""
"Hops become the center of attention, while this still drinks like a belgian ale, due to its distinct yeast flavor, with some peppery spices towards the finish, introducing an almost herbal dryness to the tongue. Finishes hop-forward, while malts and yeast handle the bitterness well, providing a convincing sweet, mellow, spiced counterpart."
""

""
""
"Beautiful champagne-like appearance.  The aroma wasn't much to speak of.  The taste was a clean cracker kind of malt flavor, finishing quite clean and bitter.  Nothing really stood out for me other than the appearance.  Maybe I was expecting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall lacks something, maybe just too bitter and not rounded enough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great, clean beer flavors; like Belgian Pale crossed with an intense, hoppy Czech Pilsner."

"12 oz. draft pour at Jester King Brewery on 9/26/14. Thank you Jester King. This beer reminded me why I got into, and enjoy, drinking craft beer. It reminded me of the first time I had a good European Lager in the mid 80's: golden, hardy unroasted malt backbone, strong bitter hop finish. While the malt takes first billing, the hops provide a perfect supporting role: citrusy, slightly acidic, what balance. Beautify look: golden with a healthy white head. What really impressed me, though, was the aroma, a wonderful combination of malt and fruit. Fresh, dry, a masterpiece."
""
""
"Sharp initial flavor with lemon pith and more peppery notes. Nice subtle pilsner malt characters that blend well with the sharper hop and yeast character. Spicy noble hops and some citrus notes from what I would imagine are American hops. There are some slightly tart characters and horse blanket/barnyard but this isn't overwhelmingly sour. It seems just a touch which just rounds out this beer and helps it finish dry leaving just a hint of hops on the palate."

" On the spicy side for the genre. Not bad..not that good, but as I said this bottle may be past prime."

"Enjoyed a pint on tap at Beer Revolution in Calgary. A Belgian IPA actually from Belgium, this brew presents a slightly cloudy golden yellow with just under an inch of white foam on top, looks much like Duvel or another ""strong golden"" ale. Aroma presages the tart, dry bitterness to come, tons of Styrian-type hops and an astringent green apple, pear, and orange fruitiness counterbalanced by a doughy yeast sweetness. Although a subtle candi sugar sweet note is detectable, on my palate this brew registers largely as tart, dry, bitter, and rather woody, medicinal hops leading the way and closing out the show with a tannic, dry gooseberry and grape finale. Once the palate acclimatizes to said bitterness, you will notice the fruit elements from the nose (pear, apple, orange) and a classic Belgian yeast character, but this requires some perseverance if you are unfamiliar with this style. Did I mention that this beer is dry? Well-attenuated body and rather heavy carbonation. Truth be told, I prefer many North American takes on this style, where the fruit is more ripe and prominent on the palate, but this obviously has its merits and is a good benchmark for a classic, genuinely Belgian hoppy ale."

"I wasn't too sure about this one really, I quite enjoyed the aroma & how the taste started out but I wasn't a fan of the incredibly bitter finish to the beer. Despite the fact that the name should have been an indication, nothing in the smell prepared me for just how bitter the taste of this one would end up. Drinkable but not one I'll go back to."

"Medium body, high carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable despite the bitterness, didn't last too long in the glass. Overall a good belgian IPA, which I preferred with the yeast poured, but very good both ways."

"belgian golden meets english bitter to me here, its got the dry belgian yeast and great carbonation, but also that english grain profile and body. it has a nice golden color, cloudy and with some lingering yeast floaters, as well as a tall and bright white head. it smells like the all too common euro green bottle skunk. its not old at all, but has that stink to it that is in so many of these. behind that though is a summery belgian yeast and what appears to be a primarily wheat malt base. the flavor has a great grassy hop finish to it, bitter and robust, but pleasing and refreshing. the malt is bigger than it looks, and has a nice frothy texture to it. combined with such frantic carbonation, the mouthfeel on this beer is near perfect for the style. i wish i could try it without the staleness to it, but i like it more as i drink it more, and i can see what its supposed to be even through this. simple beer really, but a nice balance between yeast and hops, the two main flavor agents of this brew. overpriced at about 13 bucks on shelves, but a tasty brew nevertheless."

"Picked this up at a great little beer store in Arlon, Belgium, Miorge Mihoublon. Cloudy golden-yellow pour with a two finger foamy white head with decent retention and great lacing. The nose is herbal and grassy with hints of lemon, grapefruit, subtle yeast, and straw. The taste lives up to the name with loads of bitter hoppiness along with hints of grass, lemon zest, white pepper, grapefruit, and subtle caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is light bodied, sharp and tangy, with a refreshing crisp, bitter, dry finish. Overall, this was about what I had expected, considering that I had already had the XXX Bitter. Extremely bitter, but quite drinkable and very refreshing. And you can't beat the price for a beer of this quality. Wondering why I waited so long to try this."

"Poured a cloudy yellowish golden body with great carbonation that gave a very large, foamy head, that died slow and left lace patches everywhere with a mild bitter hop aroma, I mostly picked up some funk and a little Belgian yeast. Smooth, lighter bodied, has this yeastiness on the edge that makes it pass easy on the tongue and gives a touch of sweetness. There seems to be sour/tart fruit flavors like green apple or pear and there is a nice bit of barnyard funk. Some minor citric hop bitterness adds a little spice to the beer, mainly the finish, and once in a while I get some fruit sweetness."

"Pours a hazy tangerine color with three fingers high rocky white head, sheet of sticky lace for a few inches. Smell: hoppy and fruity; lemon, grapefruit, grass; pine, pear, and berry notes. Taste: biscuit, notes of stone fruit and not-so-ripe pear, spicy, grassy, sticky orange citrus notes. Hop soaked, semi-sticky, semi-dry finish. Mouthfeel: medium-plus bodied, incredibly creamy, prickly then pillowy -- very near perfect. A fantastic Belgian IPA."

"D: High. Refreshing. The ""low"" ABV helps a lot and the bitterness is a must."
""
"Overall: Interesting, hoppy, enjoyable Belgian golden ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a different take on the IPA with approximately equal contributions from the yeast, hops, and malt. I didn't enjoy this nearly as much as some other Belgian IPAs."
""
""
""
"This isn't my favorite for the style but still damn good. Nice hop flavor with low bitterness and plenty of Belgian flair."
""
"XX Bitter, in my opinion, is one outstanding ale. Absolutely delicious with a nice hop bitterness on the finish. I feel like running to the store and picking up more of these right now. Two thumbs up. I'm anxious to try others from De Ranke."
"What a superb beer, refreshing with an assertive and elegant hoppiness, and still very well balanced and with high drinkability. And it is not overly sweet, which in my opinion is an original sin of several Belgian brews, and it is much more fun given the adequate hopping with a mild tartness."
""
""
"O- Everything about this beer is OK except for the flavor. Yes, it does say that the bottling date is five years prior to the Best Before date so that means it's over a year and a half old, but it also says that it will be good up until 2016 which I disagree with. They should just put a bottled-on date."

"This beer is so darn complex and refreshing, but interesting at 6.2% ABV. I’m maybe influenced with my rating based on how much American IPAs I’ve had. I love how Belgian and funky this beer is. This truly is one of my favorite beers having had it again."

"Overall extremely dissappointing. Not sure what i was expecting, but it wasnt this. Do not recommend."
""
""

""

"To be honest I'm not seeing what the big deal with this beer is. Implications seemed to be that this would change my mind about Belgian IPAs. It's a little different maybe and perhaps a bit more cohesive but it still strikes me as quite a middle-of-the-road drop."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid Belgian IPA that had more of a Belgian feel than a hoppy one that I get with American versions of this style. The beer has a super dry finish. Left me wanting to have another one, yet there are others in the style I would go to first."

"I really do love this beer, despite its bittered excessiveness. There's a lot of wonderful fruity esters and a dried citrus finish that makes it really unique and sublime. This pairs with spicy food like a charm, as well as fried fish with lemons and pesto pasta - which is what I had this with. Fans of tripels and colorful bitter beers must try this for sure."
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, yeast, and some peppery aromas. Taste is much the same with a grain flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the flavors don't match up to the smells I am getting on this one."

"Hazy straw yellow with a white cap. Trails of lace all over the glass as I drank this down. Spices and earthy, grassy hops come through the nose as a touch of light pale malt and honey wafts through as well. Very light citrus tone  too. The flavor is of crackers, earth, nutty yeast, pears and other lighter fruits, golden raisins, spice. A medium body with a fair amount of carbonation. Very nice."
"O - I find this beer disappointingly one-dimensional. There is a bit of Brettanomyces character in the end of a swallow, but there is a lack of malt to round out and balance the strong hops. I'm not a hophead, so I find this one disappointing."
""

"APPEARANCE: Many white foam mostly inconsistent. There remains a layer thickness of a finger for several minutes passes before stabilizing at a thickness of half finger. Many brands irregular foam from the maximum height reached to serve. Hazy blond color. MSE gaseous seen intense activity coming from the background, as if boiling. The ""boil"" is very curious. AROMA: In the first instant, herbal flavor that gives way after a bitter notes. That smell becomes final. I like. TASTE: No shades or is especially attractive. I expected a very intense bitterness, but is moderate. Very ordinary except for the bitterness that, again, is present, and is intensifying, but without being excessive. Easily drinkable and refreshing, but nothing more. Okay to accompany nibbles like some fries or a rough, and in that sense is a good alternative to the plague of European lager, but nothing more. Overall rating: Not rated I think it's okay to consider it more like an Orval, for example. For me there is more than a good quality lager. I said. If your budget allows, alternative to a common European lager. € 2.20"

"2012 vintage .. insane carbonation. smells like a lambic?? great sour taste up front, almost pours like a champagne. must have taken 5 minutes for the head to settle. nothing like ive ever seen before! definitely an interesting brew from de ranke and worth a second glance, even at 11.49/26oz"
"Again, when it's fresh, this is quite enjoyable for what it is. When the hops begin to or have all but faded (in flavor), it's not so superb, yet it's still surely drinkable. Still, a must have for any (burgeoning) Belgian beer enthusiast."
"O- This beer is growing on me. Certainly worth trying for a change amongst Belgian beers. I'd compare to Orval Trappist beer and Russian River's Damnation. TIP!"
""
"O: Truly outstanding. A beer that I have, do, will continue to aspire to brew as a homebrewer."
"Overall I am pleased. I'm always excited to try something from De Ranke as it's fairly difficult to come by in my neck of the woods. This beer did not dissapoint and for the price would happily buy it again."

"O - Has grainy and big belgian character, definity interesting and well worth a purchase, just make sure you have some time to sit and let the head settle!"
""

"O: Definitely for ""advanced"" beerheads. This being my first, a big part of the enjoyment was the novelty. This is a very original beer that -- like a lot of Belgians -- doesn't neatly fit into any style."
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Overall: XX Bitter has some of my absolute favorite beer characteristics in it. What at first seemed like a niche selection to me, I now realize is something closer to a crowd pleaser, if one is already inclined towards Belgians and craft beer, that is."
""
"Overall: A very tasty BIPA. I will add this one to the list. Very enjoyable and easy to drink too."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/2016(11/2011 bottling). Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, pepper, clove, pineapple, herbal, floral, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of lemon, pepper, clove, herbal, pineapple, floral, grass, earth, and yeast spices. Fair amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, pineapple, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity; no cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly crisp and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian IPA. Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. Highly enjoyed this one."
"Overall a very good beer. At $13 a bottle I expect a little more. Because of the price I'll probably stick to the le chouffee ipa, which I prefer. This beer doesn't hold a candle to duvel triple hop."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A tasty and easy drinking Belgian IPA. Nice hop flavor profile and a nice aroma; give it a go."
"O - Very interesting take on the Belgian IPA, although it seems to be more of an experimental brew. Very good."
"overall: It's a nice beer, but still in doubt how to judge this one. I like the hoppy dry grapefruit bitter together with the more wet and easy fruity sweet flavors. I love the effect and development of the flavors in your mouth, but it does feel just a tad too much to the bitter/grapefruit side to really enjoy any day. I really need to be in the mood for this one. Just lacks the final word in balance. But i'm sure if you're a fan of these flavors you'll love this one."
""
""
""

"Overall: Surprised that I haven't tried this before as I have tasted many other Belgian IPAs over the years; this, apparently, is the original and is well worth seeking out"

"Handsome, paper-wrapped, corked and caged bottle, but the price tag is a tad steep - $12.99/750mL. Looks brilliant poured into a chalice. Glowing goldenrod with an enormous head of airy white foam. It's bitter and elegant all at once. Bright grass and herb notes with a lingering black pepper bitterness. Smooth malt lends a touch of freshly baked bread crust. Dry and drinkable. Almost too drinkable, 750mL washed down my gullet in less than 60 minutes. A world-class Belgian pale."
""
""
""
""
"O- Highly enjoyable and thirst-quenching despite dominant bitterness. Not very complex but at least i'm finally tasting a belgian ipa that has some distinctive character, not just a random strong pale ale with a bit more hops than usual"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- what seem to be pils malt and noble hop creates a lot of similarity between this one and a pils. Yeast is understated and the beer isnt too ale fruity. Belgian ipa isnt my favorite style but this one is pretty good."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy light orange amber, two finger medium white head with nice lacing. Aroma of funky herbal hops, light sour fruit, interesting. Belgian yeast, light fruit; starts as a Belgian light ale, quickly followed by hop bitterness that has a strong floral component. Finish is semi-sweet malt and hop bitterness. Quite different and tasty. Mouthfeel is medium with a hint of creaminess. Nicely made and interesting."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. Overall it was a very good beer. It had a nice hoppiness to it with the yeast spice and pale malts complimenting well. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer of the style overall."
""
""
"O: A drinkable beer. The bitterness in the finish is a bit overdone. Also wished they would have used less earthy hops to bring more focus on fruity yeast flavors. Would drink again if readily available, but not worth going out of your way to obtain it."
""
""
""
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
""
""
""
"O - Seriously, this is a beauty. I have walked past this on the shelf so many times before giving it a shot. If you like Belgian flavours, do yourself a favour and pick one up at next opportunity."

"11.2oz. bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a slightly hazy gold with a couple of fingers of white head. Plenty of carbonation. Bottle conditioned. Citrus hop aroma with an earthiness that seemed a little off IMO. Sweet malt up front with a fair amount of hop bitterness for a Belgian beer. A little Belgian yeast profile. Fairly drying finish from the hops."

"This beer poured out as a hazy looking golden color with a fluffy white head on top. The head left behind some good lacing. The smell of the beer had lots of Belgian hop aromas to it. The taste of the beer was earthy and very bitter. The mouthfeel was smooth but dries out the mouth really quick. Overall this brew is pretty good, I like that they are attempting ""the hoppiest beer in Belgium"". I think that's pretty cool."

"Poured a 2"" white head. Body is a clear light lemon color, kind of pretty. Smell and taste both bring the hops in clean fruity, sweet, bitter expressions. The label claims this is ""The Hoppiest Beer of Belgium"". Yeah, it's hoppy, but I'm not sure their claim would stand up. In the US this would be a more mid-range IPA."
"For a 6.2% beer this is a behemoth. An uncompromising bitter, tart and slightly funky brew that lies somewhere in between a Saison and a Lambic."
""
"Poured into a Gouden Carolus goblet, the beer is a hazy honey color with a foamy white head. Nice hop aroma to it. The taste is hoppy as well, as the beer leans on the bitter side with a nice Belgian yeast flavor, while finishing dry. A good velvety feel to it, the carbonation assists the bitterness."
"O: after the great looks and smells I hoped for a little bit more. I bit too hoppy for me. But can I blame the Ranke? The warning was XX-bitter!"
"O: A really good beer that went down exceedingly quickly. I like the refined earthiness with nice herbal tones and a solid underlying bitterness on a biscuity malt foundation. I will be looking out for more of this without a doubt."
"Overall, this is a style i could really get behind, but it lacks the intensity i was expecting. Perhaps I'm too used to American-style IIPAs. This one is quite easy to drink, while still having a very distinctive hop character and a fantastic aroma!"
"Drink- It was a nice little beer to start the day, but the flavors just didnt work all that well for me."
"O - In my opinion, this beer has the perfect amount of bitterness despite being named ""XX Bitter"". The bitterness is there, but it doesn't overpower any of the other unique facets such as the Belgian yeast strain, complex mix of spices (I won't even pretend that I know these), and overall funky saison-like character. According to my co-worker (who is friends with the Shelton Brothers), they both quit their jobs and starting importing Belgian beers after tasting De Ranke XX Bitter...thank you Sheltons!"
"O - I would absolutely have this beer again. It is the first I have had of the style and it sure wont be the last. Maybe I will stop practicing law and start importing beer."
"Haven't reviewed many Belgians, but this was a nice introduction to the style for an IPA drinker."
"jd"
"An outstanding IPA mostly because of what it is *not*."
"Overall: See my notes on taste. If offered this vs an average american IPA, there's no question I'd choose an American IPA."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink for the style and the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"O/D - I'm really impressed with this beer. I was already a fan of Belgian golden ales and IPAs, and this is an excellent combination of the two. If you're an IPA fan that is thinking about trying some Belgians, do yourself a favor and pick this one up."
"The palate opens beautifully balanced, with a blend of Bretty clove phenols, moderately resiny hop flavors with some mint, herbaceousness and a little pine and a delicate cotton candy malt backbone. The malt is *really* simple here, a light mildly doughy, mildly honey-like sugar. Drying and bitter on the finish with lingering clove and Bretty phenols, this beer is light in body and highly carbonated. Despite this, it feels just right on the palate, a little creamy even. Drying, refreshing and well-crafted - what more could one want?"
"O: great classic beer"
"Pours hazy orange gold with a frothy, sizeable head that recedes slowly. Aroma of yeasty funk, floral hops, and sweet malts with citrus accents. Inital taste of grass, pine, and citrus, followed by an overpowering bitterness that lasts through the finish into sometime next Tuesday. Hops taste real fresh. I guess they don’t call it XX bitter for nothing. This is one of the bigger Belgians I’ve had, but isn’t truly balanced. It is what it is, and what it is is BITTER and tasty."
"O: This bottle was like a slightly skunked fresh saison. It was enjoyable but the skunk thing was just a little distracting (to be honest, I'm not sure if it's actual skunking or it's supposed to be THIS funky/musty/slightly almost spoiled, but the first rush of aroma was like a skunk walked by my window). It's an interesting beer, if it is indeed skunked and old, I could see how this could be solid when fresh. As is, I would probably be a little upset if this was my home brew."
"Hazy yellow, slightly orange and the pour formed a big bubbly off-white head. Biscuit malt aroma along with a big burst of floral/fruity hops. Tangerine and mango, faint amounts of fresh hay. A strong aroma of champagne yeast blends in as well. Compared to the nose, the flavor is very different. The fruity side of the hops has been masked and it has become a lemon bite with an earthy hay finish. A lot of bread, slightly wheat, malt, which has a subtle sourness, make up the body. The yeast adds a spicy/sour fruit character and gives the creamy body a solid amount of carbonation. Pleasant lingering aftertaste and not a lot of bitter bite."
"Most likely the hoppiest Belgian beer I've had so far. I'm a malt man normally, but this was fine for me: any more hops however and I'd not be so generous with my review or scores."
"Overall. Good beer. Not a big Belgian fan, but the heavy-handed hops in this one made me happy."
"Overall, this beer is good. Easy drinker. Very refreshing. One of the best belgian IPA I've tasted so far."
"O: I kind of expected more from this beer since it is touted as a world class beer and is offered throughout different beer stores, but I don't think I would buy this one again. Whether that is a matter of freshness or not, I am not sure as this is the first time I have tried this beer. But it said on the side that it should be consumed by March 21, 2015 so I guess this isn't the case..."
"A nice beer easy to drink and light bodied. I was expecting a little bit more from the flavor, but not bad. I'd like to try this one on tap sometime."
"O- Overall, it is well executed but overall not that memorable. Drinks well for the ABV. The mouthfeel is what makes it for me."
"O - A very solid BIPA"
"Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, not as carbonated as I was expecting but good. Overall this is a nice beer. I am glad I tried this. A bit pricey for a daily drinker but worth coming back to again."
"One of the better Belgian IPAs I've had."
"Pale straw gold pours into my snifter glass. Cloudy apperance. Headed with 2 cm dense foam. Good retention & carbonation. Fruity & hoppy aroma, floral hints felt too, opens the door to a subtle & kind bitterness in your mouth. Well balanced flavors & dry bitterness will remain in your palate. Medium body. Excelent drinkability & refreshing sensation. May I have one more please?"
"Finish is ""heavy"" pine bitter character."
"D- Abv becomes apparent from the bitterness of the phenols although inherently i think it wouldnt have been felt. Some sips were very tasty others just bothered me from the phenols."
"Good, though the hops are overwhelmed by yeast-derived phenols in the flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing, although the slight plastic-y phenols detract from the overall enjoyment of the beer."
"The best Belgian IPA I have had so far, certainly will buy and enjoy it again."
"D-nicely balnaced and very easy and tasty to drink. mild yet pleasant flavors, nice belgian yeast presence and a well integrated hop profile."
"D: Good, if you like a bitter beer. Otherwise, that bitterness will slow you down."
"Surprisingly aggressive & pungent hoppiness on par with a well-hopped American IPA. Hoppiest non-US brew I've ever had & the focus on European hops is a really nice change of pace. The earthy, herbaceous hops are held up by sweet malts with lots of light fruit esters. It's sort of a cross between an amped-up English IPA and a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Reminds me of Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel, except this one is a hell of a lot better. Very good beer."
"Overall, a very nice, very drinkable beer. Will definitely try this one again."
"Drinkability: Rates fairly high. Spot on for style, easy to drink. Just wish it was more readily available and the price was cheaper."
"Mouth: Dry, hoppy notes. Very dry, somewhat bitter. Again, a touch of oxidation, but it's not unpleasant. Mouthfeel is explosive, a bit over carbonated. That could benefit from some chill, but I was too eager to drink it. Linger hoppy finish, more grapefruit pith... yet gentle, subtle."
"Drinkability- Quite Belgian. If you like Belgian beers, you'll like this."
"This bottle was dated April 2009, so it's a year and half past its best by date. It poured a dirty burnt orange with a lot of sediment and a one finger, off white head. It smells great for it's age. It is very heavy on the orange, very heavy. There is some malty sweetness but the defined hops have faded. The flavor is very interesting. It's a sweet orange flavor with little hops or malt. It has slight yeastiness. It drinks light to medium bodied and is pretty tasty. I'd love to see what it's like fresh if it was this good six years old."
"Unless it is so well balanced that I am undercutting the hoppiness, I would rate it about 55 - 65 IBU's, but I'm believing that it is the well rounded profile causing me to shoot in that range. Still, as they claim, hoppy for a Belgian."
"D: Pretty good, as far as these things go. A bitter belgian, with the trademark de ranke funk."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer and probably one of the best Belgian IPAs out there."
"330 ml, BB date says October 2015, into tulip. Pours pale golden slightly hazy body topped by medium-sized white head that persists. Aroma is clean sweet malt with grassy hops suggesting dry-hopping and fruitiness that might originate from yeast-derived esters or hops. The simplistic flavor is predominantly resinous & piney with high bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Light-medium bodied with moderately high carbonation creating peppery-prickly sensation and palate-cleansing dry finish enhanced by intense bitterness. Good for what it is and justifying its name, the xx bitter."
"bright hazy yellowish orange color. Thick, bright white 1"" head at pour. head retention is very good, leaves pretty good white lace rings around glass. A faint hint of a musty spiciness. Smells light, and dry. May just be my bottle, but picking up a slightly skunky smell, can't remember the scientific chemical name right off hand but I assume that it is intentional. High carbonation. The spice and cloviness smelled in the aroma is barely present in the taste. Some bready notes. Dry hop finnish, dryness later joined by citris aftertaste. Very light and refreshing. Not quite as bitter as I was expecting to have it so advertised on the bottle, but still good."
"D-Certainly nice stuff and while the hop profile isn't quite my cup of tea for the style I cannot deny it's goodness. A very well done beer for sure."
"This is the closest thing to an acrid west coast American IPA that I have experienced of the Belgian variety. Of course, in this case, the hop flavour profile differs, as it should, but the bitterness remains, along with yer typical pervasive yeastiness. I'm used to malt-heavy Belgian offerings - nice to see one more given to the hoppy side of the coin."
"D: A very nice Belgian IPA, if you never had one before - try this one."
"D - With a tame ABV like this and a complexity that deserves a devotion of time this could definately be a session beer if you could both afford it and find it."
"T: Much more balanced than in the nose. In fact, very nice. Of course the hops are the focus - piney, slightly floral. But there is a light sweetness and a bready malt character there to balance also. Paired with a uniquely Belgian yeast character, this beer is really unmissable."
"I was expecting 5.0 drinkability, but I have to knock it a couple notches. I find that the flowery bitterness almost becomes tiresome as I progress through the bottle. Still, this is a very solid extra-hopped Belgian blonde. Would have gladly have another, but next time I'm splitting it with someone. So this is the beer that spawned all the Belgian IPAs? Cheers - it would seem to me that every BA should drink at least one bottle of this."
"D: A good drinker."
"XX Bitter leaves a slight lingering bitterness that makes you want more. The hops are slightly more prevalent than the fruits and flavorings, but give a good bouquet."
"If you're looking for hops, this is the right direction!"
"I can see the Orval comparison many other writers are commenting on. Will definitely aim to have both in a session sometime soon to compare the two."
"This is a really great Belgium ipa. Nice floral nose with notes of yeast and wheat. Extremely balanced, almost makes me crave the unbalance of a DIPA. Nice notes of wheat hit the palate with a phenolic finish. A very drinkable and surprisingly refreshing beer."
"Ah, a great brew here. I prefer the American hops in most of the newer Belgian IPAs, but this brew is a classic."
"D: High. Refreshing. The ""low"" ABV helps a lot and the bitterness is a must. Highly suggested to bitterness lovers"
"Double X comes off the spout looking bright golden with yellow highlights infused underneath a clump of white foam that leaves minimal stick. A nice ring around the glass. Scents dont exactly burst out at you, obviously there is some hops and very low traces of malt sweet backing. Some warming brings a fuller bouquet with small citrus, grass clippings, and the 'bitter'ness deepens a bit. First swigs Im just like 'eh' but overtime this did turn out to be quite bitter but not overpowering. Not really tropical more down to earth. Small lemons and grass, light malt sweet back, light as can be. Pretty bitter on the mouth this lives up to it's name. The low ABV makes for less malt and sugars used so this is on the hoppy side, I liked it, alot."
"11.2 oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Bottled in January 2010 - best before January 2015. Pours 80% head - creamy, frothy and cloud-like with a bright white hue. Body is pale, orange-gold with a semi-hazy clarity. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim with thick, swaths of porous lacing coating the sides of the glass and exhibiting excellent adhesion. Nose expresses Belgian yeast, citric acid and an earthy/medicinal bitter quality. Taste is entirely less bitter than I anticipated - citrus, perhaps a little minty and a medicinal bitterness that slowly dissipates between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light with an assertive carbonation that approaches prickly and gives the body more presence. A solid Belgian IPA, but hard to believe it is the hoppiest beer of Belgium (per the label). Nonetheless, quite easy drinking for the style."
"D: Easy drinker. Pleasant balance of bitter hop and sweet malt."
"I wouldn't pick it over a good Amerian IPA but thats just my opinion. Lacks the hop complexity that I love so much."
"Slow progression of some really unique and interesting flavors. strong bitterness, but it fits into the range of flavors like a puzzle piece. Balanced and suiting. Every sip tastes better. I keep noticing new complexities. Clean citrousy hops, spicy. Not very scorching to the palate. I like American IPA's more, but this is a pretty interesting beer. worth trying."
"D: This was not super clean, but it was definitely a hoppy Belgian ale. Body was ok, and it wasn't difficult to drink aside from the lasting bitterness. But I'm generally not impressed with this beer."
"330mL bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a big white head. The aroma is a little funky with grass, citrus, and yeast. Flavor is rather light with citrus, pepper, grass, and some bitterness. This is also quite dry. Decent beer, but not one of my favorites."
"D - Really good dry hoppy finish. Extremely drinkable really making you want more with each sip."
"I would down a couple of these bad boys if I had them."
"Pours a slightly-hazed straw color with a good-sized white head that eventually makes its way down to about an eighth of an inch of lacing. Nose is slightly sweet and grassy with a wee bit of hay. Some pear and milder fruits. Taste is similar with a bit of bitterness coming through alongside a bit more earth. Mouthfeel is beautifully done; wonderful carbonation and a silky creaminess. Excellent drinkability. Another big hit from De Ranke."
"Spicy hop flavors, some bubblegum and white pepper from the yeast. Quite dry and bitter, herbal and floral. Medium-bodied, fairly crisp. Pale malts show themselves mid palate, but the finish is a bitter herbal hop assault. Pretty tasty stuff."
"XX Bitter appears a hazy straw yellow hue with a massive whipped meringue head and an ample supply of caked-on lacing. Belgian yeast, hops, and straw make up the aromas. This beer tastes exactly like one would/should expect from a Belgian IPA. The hops are quite present and taste really nice, especially paired with the heavy Belgian yeast component. The carbonation level is solid and the beer has a decent feel. Overall this is a well-crafted brew, and a solid example of the style."
"Thick hazy golden yellow brew with a thin white head. Smells of sweet and bitter orange rind, honey, some faint lemongrass hops. Fairly sweet. Taste is strong lemongrass hop on a thick and sweet honey and malt background. Faint yeast, good bready feel. Leaves wisps of foam on the glass. Some spicy coriander and a hint of clove as it warms. Body is fairly thick but the carbonation cuts through to give it a crisp and balanced feel."
"D: Extremely drinkable, improves with every sip. An excellent brew."
"Beer is light in body and finishes a little dry. Bitterness builds in the back of the palate. There isn't much sweetness up front and the yeast / bready character with the nice Belgian yeast esters are also rather subdued. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is fine. Overall its a little thin and a little too dry."
"UPDATE: I had this a second time and it was very weird: every time I took a sip it exploded into fizz...so it wasn't actual flowing liquid. It was actually had to drink. I will have to try again to see if this was a one-off thing."
"Very minimal white head, leaving a small ring around outside of glass, no lacing. Strawish orange body, no visible carbonation, not sure this is the freshest of kegs. Very very hoppy nose with some lemon notes and a bit of white pepper presence as the beer warmed. The taste starts upfront with a firm malt backbone, not too sweet, may be pilsener malt, a really hoppy middle, a bit grassy and floral, leading to a quite bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium light, decent effervescence, leading to a fairly dry finish probably attributable to the Belgian yeast. May have lost a bit of the hop presence due to a bit aged of a keg, but this was certainly one of the best Belgian IPAs I've had. Recommended."
"Brewer's Gold and Hallertau don't really do it for me hopwise but I could see if that's you're thing this is a great beer."
"This is a classic highly-hopped Belgian IPA, with an underlying Belgian malt/yeast structure. Very drinkable at 6.2%, a sessionable beer of choice for summer drinking if you like bitters. Cheers!"
"Too expensive to be drinkable. Nothing to appreciate mouthfeel, other than bitterness. Too one dimensional."
"11.2 oz bottle pored a hazy golden color with a huge fluffy white head ( its a belgian no aggressive pour here) it recedes in a timely manner just enough for it to warm a little more... clinging lace abounds..smell is light floral aromas,musty malts and bread,with yeast and spice..this has a malty musty sweet floral hop taste not overwhelming but more sweetness with a hint of bittering hops in the finish with a musty grain taste ..mouth feel is medium but light for a belgian ipa ..overall its way drinkable and the flavors augment as it warms but not the tastiest BIPA ive ever had especially for the price..wanted to try this one glad i did will buy again and would love to have on tap"
"OVERALL: As bitter as it says it is. I can believe that this at least competes for the most bitter beer in Belgium. Enjoyable enough, but a little one dimensional. Would drink again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"D - It's not nearly as big as other Belgian IPAs and doesn't have the depth of flavors some of them offer, but I can definitely appreciate something that isn't going to sink me after one. It's hot and humid out and De Ranke XX Bitter manages to be refreshing while providing ample flavor."
"F: The bitterness comes out more on the finish as it builds especially, and a little more astringent too. Grassy earthy spicy hops with a little citrus are the key items. It's somewhat dry as well, with some lingering Belgian malts and a looong bitterness."
"Drinkability: Proper ABV, balanced Belgian IPA - quite quaffable."
"D: Goes down easily, not too filling, nicely balanced, and I could certainly have a few of these."
"D: it is a decent beer, but i have had much better belgian IPAs. its not something i would seek out."
"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip, bottle thanks to freud! Huge white head, billowing, sticky, soapy etc etc, settling down to a thin layer, body is a deep orange, opaque with the yeast. Looks real good. Smell is spicy, bready, some alcohol, sweet malt, and a bit of hops. Smelled hoppier when I opened the bottle though, was big when I popped the cap. Taste is hoppy, but fairly balanced, the spices are right there too. Quite bitter in the aftertaste and a really dry, stinging finish as I gulp this. Pretty good Belgian IPA, only my second ever though, so I'm not one to judge!"
"D - very good if you're in the mood. one of my new favorite styles...this one brings some real bite. can wear after a little but still delicious."
"If anything, it's over-carbonated. The 'tingle' of the carbonation gets in the way of the bite. But it's still good. Malty, too. Finished it rather quickly."
"Regardless of hop-beaten tongue, I'd say this is a very drinkable beer. I found this at a fine foods shop across from my new apartment and I think it may get a spot in the regular rotation. If you come across it, grab it immediately."
"D: This is a really good Belgian IPA... after drinking so many North American IPAs, it's nice to go to the Belgian style to realize not every IPA has to knock you out with the hops. Very subtle and enjoyable."
"D. too drinkable! Can not wait to find on draft!"
"Cellar temp 750ml decanted into a Cordendonk tall tulip glass. Hazy straw pour with a stiff, though short lived, head."
"D - This is an interesting beer. The smell and taste were vastly different. Overall, it's good but not great."
"Another good one. So far all my favorite Belgian IPAs are the ones *made in* Belgium, & this is no exception. Easily drinkable, despite its complexity."
"Nothing special here."
"12 ounce bottle shared via fisherman4- pours a golden hay with a very thick snow white head. Nose- earthy and citrus. Taste- quite bitter along with a brett musty undertone. Hops are grassy and herbal. The brett combined with the agressive hopping makes for a really dried out beer. Finish is very dry. Carbonation is fairly high and body is on the thin side. Interesting brew I'd like to revisit again."
"quite a nice beer this. plenty of character but still light enough to leave you waiting for the next sip."
"D - A sophisticated and worldly sipper... Not my favorite, but a highly recommended and much appreciated Belgian IPA none the less... A brew the a wine drinker may truly appreciate... This one is going down fairly easy and without any complains..."
"D – Extremely sessionable. Pairs as well as a pairing can be."
"I drink this a session beer when I can and hope I never tire of it."
"A deliciously dry Belgian IPA. ""A-"""
"It may be the hoppiest, but it isn't the best Belgian IPA though it is solid."
"drinkability: I liked it, but mostly because it was interesting and different. It's not going to make my top 10 list of beers I can't wait to drink. I might have one again sometime, when I'm in the mood for something different and a bit funky."
"Slainte."
"D- I need to seek out more Belgian IPA's, what a unique flavor profile in this one."
"A very bitter pale ale more than any kind of IPA; all IBUs over hop flavor."
"Notes: Most bitter, and probably the hoppiest, Belgian IPA I have tried. That said it is definitely a Belgian (yeast). Good every once in a while beer, especially if you are craving hops and a bit of funk."
"D- A very nice Belgian IPA, very clean and refreshing."
"This is an interesting beer. it certainly isn't (and shouldn't be) a Belgian IPA. This seems to strike what the brewery is seeking to do. Nonetheless it could be refined a bit further to round out some edges which grate a little bit. While my review differs quite substantially from others, the bottling date on my bottle indicates that this beer is under a year old so freshness shouldn't be an issue."
"O: mild but very smooth, lots of bitterness, great hoppy belgian beer"
"Golden color with greenish reflections probably due to a resinous hops. The nose is hoppy and mouth following the same path is to be both safe, tough and bitter. The palate is intense and shows the power and quality of hopping. The holding of mouth is also impressive. It also presents similarities with Orval where, vis-à-vis the latter, it gains in power hop what it loses in complexity. A beer of high quality."
"I love hoppy beers and since the ABV is low, this is a very drinkable beer. I would most enjoy this in the warm summer months while sitting on the deck."
"Pours with a cloudy yellow/orange body, with a big rocky white head, and very heavy carbonation. Very floral aromas with a heavy citrus slant, slightly soapy, and an unmistakable Belgian yeastiness. The taste is like the nose with a clear floral character upfront, followed by a bitter hoppiness. There is a sweet malt back bone which has a butter popcorn taste, and a light caramel. Really great beer, very light and drinkable."
"Completely missed the brett, its nothing like Orval as the description suggests."
"750 ml bottle, best before the end of May 2014. The beer pours a hazy gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is lemon, peppery spice, Belgian yeast and a bit of grapefruit. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, with the addition of a nice lingering bitter hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's well carbonated and finishes dry. Drinkability is pretty good, it goes down easy and it's very enjoyable. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Pours cloudy yellow-copper with a huge, rocky white head. Okay lacing. Soapy, herbal, earthy aroma. Some funk, but it may be from the yeast-hop mix. Effervescent mouthfeel, dry finish. Very hoppy, bitter, earthy bite with faint Belgian funk and spice. Kind of a weird blend reminiscent of Urthel's Hop It. I don't know, it just feels unbalanced."
"An exceptionally drinkable brew, and one which highlights what the Belgians do best. I've recently been drinking huge and flavoursome US craft brews, and this beer puts them in context. It shows what you can do with a more moderate taste profile, by blending disparate elements flawlessly, and providing impeccable balance. This is a big winner."
"Good drinkability for a belgian pale."
"I like the bitterness--from mid-taste through the finish and aftertaste. There's a good malt base. Lots of ground pepper. Spritzy but with a good body."
"D: Superb! It has the smooth, perfectly balanced taste of an English Bitter with the added complexity of a Belgian ale and the moderate ABV makes it very sessionable."
"A classic bitter, near the top of the style, and definitely worth seeking out."
"This is my first review, so bear with the perhaps-shaky evaluation language. I may have poured the beer a wee bit too cold, because flavors became more complex as I made my way through the bottle."
"One of the better belgian IPAs."
"pretty good beer overall, I will give it another chance in the future."
"Pours a very cloudy golden color with almost no head to speak of. Some spotty lacing is left that seems characteristic of Belgian style beers. Cloudyness is accpeted in this style so no points can be docked for that. However, it does not APPEAR all that appetizing. Smells like belgian malts and yeast, the nose is not huge for me here, some citrus in the nose as well. Taste here is great, I wasn't sure it would be this way after the nose. A very complex taste and a bitterness you will not find in most American beers. It is as if they extracted the hop bitterness and removed a lot of the hop flavors, this is probably the most bitter beer I have ever had. It is just a straight up bitter slam with no huge hoppy notes, some pine and earth but not overpowering, very cool. Also in here is the belgian malts, yeast, and citrus. Lemon and lime peel can be tasted giving the beer even more great flavor. This beer's taste is probably the most unique IPA taste I have sampled thus far. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, light bodied with good carbonation. The MF suits the flavor very well and feels nice. No warming in this beer at all. A nice bitter coat left on the tongue. Drinkability is good. The amazing taste is something that shouldn't be overlooked, the price is a bit steep and the bitterness will certainly get overpowering after a while. If I see this on tap again I will probably have another but won't be buying the rather expensive bottle anytime soon (which I have had and must say I prefer the tap version by a long shot)."
"D - crisp flavors and low ABV...this is very drinkable. i'll give De Ranke the benefit of the doubt and assume I had a lightstruck version."
"Light to medium body with a crisp, dry finish. Enjoyable all around. Not very strong, making it one of the more sessionable Belgians around."
"Taste is awesome, screw miller this is the Champagne of beers! Dry and smooth, quite carbonated but still very smooth. Very sharp an tasty, an awesome beer!"
"D ehh...O.K. but I am disappointed in this expensive import which features a taste that is close to many that can be found stateside. 3.5"
"Pours a cloudy apple cider mixed in with some orange juice. While the white head isn't big by any means it has good retention and laces very well. Grapefruit,grass, pepper and tropical fruit make up an enticing aroma. Spicy flavour has a moderate bitterness. Again the grapefruit turns up, but there's also some fruity, slightly funky yeast in the mix. Medium body and medium-high carbonation feels about right."
"Overall, I really enjoyed the hop flavor in this Belgian beer. It was not as dominate as some hop flavors in American IPAs, which i like, but it was great to try a Belgian with hop flavor."
"Not as bitter as I expected from the label but still a very tart, citrusy hopped brew."
"Decent carbonation, but not quite a session ale. A nice sipper though."
"D - Could drink a bunch based on ABV. This is a nice brew that should not be passed by"
"D - Very nice."
"Overall - I can't believe those WA breweries would make such an obvious ripoff of XXXX, and make it so obviously worse. XX Bitter is the most pathetic excuse for a beer ever."
"D - Definitely not a session style, but not nearly as trying to drink as other beers of this caliber. I could definitely see going for another, but obviously not too many after that."
"A very good beer, but better when fresh in Belgium. The bottle I had at the cafe across the road from the Mannequin Pis was to die for."
"D - Very refreshing. Good balance. Great Taste."
"D: This really is Orval turned up to 11. I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
"Mouthfeel: A little thin for an IPA of this strength with a sharp carbonation"
"Well done."
"pour is golden with a beautiful head. tight, white, and with time contracted head. smell is a minty pine, and lavender. palate so crisp its soapy. quite clear and very bright. strong floral that clears the tongue dry. mint, lavender, a light bitter, and thyme. definitely wonderful hop quality."
"Drinkability is very much here, and with an abv at 6%, you could certainly indulge in more than one of these, delicious !"
"D - This was a top beer, I've actually had this sitting around for a few months and it probably wasn't at it's freshest to begin with. I'd LOVE to try this fresh. It was still very good and I'm so tempted to go put the 2nd bottle in the fridge now..."
"But this here's the original."
"drinkability is good, except for the price, I payed 5.49 for the 11.2oz bottle."
"Pouring in the sediment, it pours an extremecy cloudy brown-yellow colored body, with a very big head, creamy, but not very lasting. Very hoppy aroma, alcoholy, dark fruit. Dark sugary. Bitter dry taste, full body, not watery. Kind of dirly tasting. Some maltiness. Dry & somewhat acidic. Kind of like a sweet pale ale."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body with prickly carbonation. I could drink this one often."
"this is pretty enjoyable to drink, it has a nice balance of belgian sweetness and hops, i don't think the price is quite justified (12.99, if I remember correctly, Houblon Chouffe is cheaper and better, and Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor is nearly as good and is $9 at most)....still a very good beer though"
"Future outlook: Not a bad beer, but not exactly my cup of meat, and not something I'm likely to revisit anytime soon."
"12oz bottle with a best by date of January 2012 so I guess this is about two years old. Nice hazy yellow, billowy head. Smells like earthy hops and tastes like a nice belgian pale. Very easy to drink but when I think of hoppy I think of copious amounts of American hops. Overall, I liked this but I still would not call it hoppy by any stretch of the imagination."
"I'd have this again, for sure, as its a very balanced beer, and very tastey. But at 4.99 for a 11.2 oz, I'm not sure I will be back for another."
"Pours a hazy straw color with a thick, fluffy white head. The smell was of honeyed grain, lemon and very floral hops. The taste was very tart during the middle of the sip, but finished pretty dry. I probably drank this during the wrong time of the year, because this beer would be great during a hot summer day. Drinkability was good. I will definitely try this again in the summer."
"D: Very drinkable."
"d: Brewed to be a more extreme version of Orval, XX Bitter helps set the bar for Belgian IPAs. I would rather have Orval, but this is still an excellent beer. I could drink this all day."
"9/4/8/4/15 (4.0/5)"
"Overall impression: Although this beer wasn't as 'funky' as I'd typically expect from a Belgian, I enjoyed it a lot. Would be a fun session beer if I could afford it!"
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a huge foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of yeasts, medicinal and hops. The flavor was of hops, pepper and bread. The body was medium light and the finish bitter yet sprite."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a thin foamy white head that settles into a thin lace. Aroma is a nice balance of belgian yeast strain and citrus and earthy hops. Very quaffable with a lot of bitter hops and light crisp fruit. Nice dry finish. Very hoppy fr a belgian beer."
"loved todd's orval on crack comment. if you ask me, it nails it on the head. horse blanket, hint of sour, and lemony, chocolate mintish hops all abound in a really lovely brew. mouthfeel leaves a tiny bit to be desired, and super hoppiness kind of puts this one in the appertif category if you ask me, but worth seeking out."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Very pale peach-flesh color with a dense white head. Completely opaque with yeast and maybe some chill haze. Lots of filmy lacing. Aroma is gentle and subtle, with no real outstanding feature. Nice noble hop nose with spicy and mildly citric notes. Flavor is toasty and yeasty up front with some nice lemony hops and a medium bitterness at the back of the palate. Carbonation is very high, to the point where I think I'd enjoy it more after a few minutes of letting the Duvel etching force some of the CO2 out of solution. Lovely dry finish and good drinkability."
"D: Overall a very good bitter Belgian though would be hard to drink in multiples."
"D: It's a tad bit filling, but still great. I'll be seeking out more Belgian IPAs in the future, for sure. I really enjoyed this beer and am disappointed that I don't have any left to enjoy!"
"-Plenty of lacing on the glass, like cobwebs..."
"D - This is actually quite refreshing and at 6% ABV is more than drinkable. This would be ideal in summer's heat with some shellfish."
"11.2oz bottle. Pours an almost opaque amber with a huge white, rocky head that will never quite go away. Strong citric and floral hop aromas present first, along with some bubblegum-like esters. Herbal and earthy. The taste is much bolder; lots of citrus hop presence dominates a slightly roasty malt back. It is indeed extra extra bitter. Finishes on a dry note; very nuanced, with earthy tones and some spices. Light-medium body with perfect carbonation. A masterpiece."
"Mouthfeel is very Belgianesque with a full creamy impression. Very clean and drinkable with a dry finish. Different, but excellent!"
"Overall, this is an interesting bitter. The Belgian characteristics were not really there, but the IPA flavors were."
"Enjoyed on tap at Novare Res in Portland, ME this brew was a hazy yellow gold color with a scant but bubbly white head and great lacing. The aroma is clove with wheat breadiness. The taste is crisp rye bread and lemony sweetness. It had a very fine carbonation and was quite drinkable. Lively in feel with bitter grass hoppiness."
"Pours a clouded orange brown with a frothy creme head. Nose is very earthy with some yeasty funk in there too. Flavor has an earthy bitter tone. I can't say it's very complex, but it's definitely robust. Feel has a fairly full carbonation to it. Liquid is smooth enough. This is quite the robust Belgian IPA. Distinct because of it's rugged earthiness."
"Pours pale/yellow in color, slightly cloudy with a small head. Smells of yeast, hops and malts. First sip is more bitter than hoppy. The malty backbone nicely compliments the strong hops. Strong yeasts also add to this beer's intense flavor. A strong bitter with above average carbonation. A fine showing."
"This beer was so much better than I had expected. It had everything that you would expect from a great belgian ale with a significant amount of hoppiness. Where I had this, I usually only have one of each beer so that I can try a variety, but in this case,I had to have a second xx bitter. so good!"
"A very solid beer, if not exactly my style of Belgian IPA."
"Overall a very drinkable beer."
"T/M/D - wow, very hoppy and bitter! It starts off a bit sweet (again, a faint reminder of a triple) and then the hops kick in. tsa bit oily, and the bitterness lingers on. It is a nice departure from what I normally expect from my Belgian friends - I'll definitelt try this one again!"
"The more Belgian IPA's I have, the more I like them. More subtle than American IPA's and a completely different flavor profile than either American or British IPA's. Great change of pace and highly recommended."
"Glowing golden color under a perfect silky head. The nose has a delicate hop profile followed by creamy malts and Belgian yeasts. The taste has rich malts up front followed by a mix of bitter hops and peppery yeast strains. Medium body is well carbonated. Another delicious brew from De ranke."
"Mouthfeel-hearty bitterness that stays constant. Very light malt flavors are present. It is saison-like without any strong yeast profiles. A froth on the palate releases some lighter fruit flavors-pear and white grape. Finishes just as it does when it hits the palate-bitter. This was a treat."
"Overall this is a very, very smooth beer and it's less sweet than other Belgian IPA's that I've had. Definitely worth a try, and I'm glad I got to try this on-tap."
"On tap at the Brick Store, served in a De Ranke glass. Pours a hazy yellow with a very nice white rocky head that leaves some beautiful lacing. Smells of fairly light earthy hops with some decent lingering bitterness, but not a hop monster. The taste has aa beautiful balance between the malt and the hops. Slightly sweet malt up front that segues nicely into a soft creaminess and then into big, earthy/piney hop flavors with a long, pleasant bitterness. Very smooth in the mouth and delicious. This is particularly good on tap, and lacks some of the sharpness of the bottled version and seems more finely balanced while preserving the earthy bitterness. Very nice."
"D: Fairly easy drinking. The bitterness really cuts down on the drinkability for this one. Good beer but not something I would seek out again for the price. Stick to the McChouffe."
"Pours a bright hazy golden yellow with a big fluffy white head that lingers throughout the session leaving generous lacing. The smell starts with the lemon and floral hops but is fairly sweet with Belgian yeast and some sugar in the background. There are definitely some spices tickling the noses as well. The taste is less sweet than the aroma and brings more bitterness to the table. The floral hops are big up front with lemon zest and some grapefruit and the Belgian yeast and sweetness are much more in the background with the bitternes lingering through to the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and crisp but with the obvious bitterness and lots of carbonation. This is decent Belgian IPA, though there's nothing really differentiating this one from the rest."
"Other comments: XX Bitter is a fantastic beer in the bottle. When I passed the foreign beers bar at GBBF this year and I saw it on cask, I just had to try it. It certainly has some interesting elements and is also good, but I think I prefer the bottled one."
"Pours a nice looking golden clear with a nice fluffy white head that leaves moderate lace. Nose is a bit of farm funk with some euro hoppage and mucho belgian yeast. Taste follows, some barn, spice hops and belgian yeast and a touch of wheat. Mouthfeel is nice, but I think it could be a bit thinner. Drinkability is good, but not amazing. Overall a good example of the style for those who have not yet been exosed to it. A very nice and refreshing brew."
"not too thin. decently smooth, then some hoppy tannic texture in the finish. prickly carbonation can also be fluffy."
"Pours a nice cloudy dark yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white creamy head, with lots of nice thick creamy sticky lacing. The nose is malty/hoppy, laundry soap, with some yeast tones. The taste is malty/hoppy, yeasty, some sourness and bitterness. Medium body, slightly dry/bitter. Drinkable, but would not drink again. Different though."
"Definitely recommended..."
"This is one of the weaker Belgian goldens I've tried, and it shows. The low abv means that there isn't that slow alcohol burn that adds another layer to many goldens. It also means that this one goes down smooth as hell, and probably isn't as dangerous to throw back in quantity. It sort of reminds me of a mix of the Berkshire Steel Rail (one of the most drinkable beers ever) and something like a Duvel (possibly my favorite beer of all time). I'm definitely enjoying this beer, and I look forward to enjoying it again. However, it just misses the cut of super-elite bevs."
"Poured from a capped and corked 750ml bottle, best by 07 2012. So I guess this was a young buck. Pours a very nice dark amber with billowy head, that leaves nice lacing and moderate retention. Smell is lite hops and malt, some Belgian yeast. Immediate and nice hops on the tongue, sweetness in middle hop bitterness in the finish. Finish lingers and is very pleasant. Mouthfeel is a joy, this is rich buttery beer. This is a very nice beer and well worth a try. Another great offering from De Ranke."
"Pours a slightly hazy gold, with a big, frothy pure white head that disappeares rather quickly with little lacing. Smell is spicy, lots of hops showing up. Yeast and breadiness as well, and some fruity hints. Taste is very nice, bright and hoppy with Citric notes, unique and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is crisp, full-bodied. Of the Belgian IPAs that I have tasted, I would rank this one of the best."
"Excellent drinkability and very smooth. Interesting presentation with a few flaws that are more interesting than off-putting."
"I've only had this brew one other time, and then the cork was shot and it tasted very musky.. this time.. I am very impressed, although I won't likely buy again unless I am brewing a Belgian style IPA/DIPA... too pricey for my every day enjoyment."
"Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Mild creamy texture from the persistent head. This is a good one for hot summer nights."
"Tastes of hops (German types?), yeasty spice, fruit and lightly acidic. This is one interesting and delicious beer."
"With help of water after each few sips, this is pretty drinkable for how bitter it is. The aspirin-like taste does fade a bit as it progresses. Overall it is reminiscent of Campari, and would serve well as an aperitif, though a whole 750 is a bit much."
"Overall a delicious and unique ale."
"A must try for those love Belgians with hops."
"Out of a 750ml corked and capped bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a beautiful sudsy white head that left nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is of Belgian yeast phenols and candi sugar, that nice tart funk earthy saison aroma. I pick up some banana, green apple, corriander, white pepper and a light grassy hop. The taste definitely has more of a hop presence. Some grassy hops flavors and dare I say a slight citrus hop. The hops are paired with a nice honey malt, flowers, spices, and Belgian candi sugar. Out of all of the Belgian IPAs that I have had this is one as the most bitter hop profile. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation and finishes bitter. Another excellent BIPA. This is becoming a favorite style. Nice combination of sweet, spice, and bitter."
"Had on tap at Moan and Dove. Murky, cloudy gold appearance with a nice thick head and eventual patchy lacing. Strong floral hops that were to die for; a little bit thin smelling, but with its strength, it helped hinder it from being too overpowering. Bready and wheaty to the max: it was so deliciously hoppy and wrapped in woody, forest overtones. A soild medium body helps explicit the taste. Overall, really really good."
"Drinkability: This is a very good mash-up of a Belgian strong pale ale and an IPA, one that's flavorful and interesting and refreshing. I do wish some of the Belgian fruitiness came through more, but it comes through enough to set it apart from your average IPA."
"D - Drinkability is good. Balance of flavors is good for the style. Alcohol is low which lets the other flavors show some character. Very nice overall. I would pick this one up agian."
"Very well balanced and extremely delishous. Can't wait to pick up some more."
"D: A very unique and excellent beer. I enjoyed it."
"I have noticed that the bottle reviews are scoring much higher than the tap reviews. I am going to have to find a bottle of this somewhere and do some comparing."
"XX poured a hazy lemon with some orange highlights blended into it. On top of this beer was a 1 finger head of white foam that had great retention that left behind a small white film and a fair amount of white streaks of lace. The aroma was truly unique! The aroma is spicy and dry with spicy citrus hops, a drop of perfume, Brett yeast, a slice of lemon, a pinch of grapefruit, and then it ended with an aroma that smelled like hay or something you would smell on a farm. I read a brief description of the beer and they said it was going to be very hoppy. Instead, it wasn't overly hoppy, but it still had a nice high level of hops to it. It started off lightly hopped and as it progressed, it got hoppier, but it ended with a mildly aggressive hoppiness. Besides all the hops in here, there was also citrus fruits, citrus hops, grapefruit, brett yeast, lightly toasted malts, a dab of lemon, and a slight touch of hay. It was a medium bodied beer with a light dry hoppy aftertaste of citrus fruits, citrus hops, and a touch of yeast. Overall, a nice not overly hopped Belgian beer. It is hoppy for a Belgain beer, but compared to what the Americans can dish out, it's mild."
"Update - I had a chance to pop another bottle in early 2011. It really is an incredible beer full of life with a unique hop flavor, for firm for the style, and a terrific drinker."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a chalice. Yellow with a small head that dissipates quickly. Smells vaguely fruity with some hops and malt present. Flavor is a little odd. Initially it tastes like a typical Belgian Ale with spices. But then resiny and floral hops kick in and overpower the other flavors. Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. I'm not entirely sure what to think about this beer. I like the two flavor profiles by themselves, but mixed together it doesn't work well on my palate."
"Verdict: An interesting take on an IPA. I wouldn't classify it as such and it's more of a Belgian XPA to me. I've been wanting to try this beer for a long time and glad I finally did. The bitterness is very nice."
"Drinkability : A very good beer (remind me Orval ?), a lesson in terms of bitterness"
"Rich malt up front is immediately balanced out by an herbal/earthy hop character. Toasted grain blends in with the finish. There is a very pleasing rind type bitterness that sits on the tongue and melds so well with any lingering sweetness from the malt. Great carbonation and a light to medium body. I'm almost done with this and it's only been about 5 minutes. Should have bought a case."
"This is one of my favorite beers, maybe my absolute favorite."
"750 ml bottle. Head is just so-so and the brew itself is a cloudy golden color. But things get bitter with the aroma, being a combination of citrusy hops (American hops?) and Belgian yeast. Taste was in line with the aroma, being a hybrid between two styles. It might be the bitterest beer in Belgium, but compared to real IPAs, it's not so bitter at all. Best to let it warm up to near room temperature lest it be far too dry."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light fruit, and a hop load of bitterness up front with herbal and yeasty complexities."
"Sampled at the Odds and Ends Tasting II on 10/19/07: Hazy honey color with a medium bone white head that diminishes steadily. Spotty lacing on the glass. Yeast and hops in the nose, with bits of malt. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with grassy hops and yeast flavors, as well as some malt in the background. The finish is dry and hoppy with a yeast/hay aftertaste. De Ranke has chosen an interesting characteristic on which to differentiate this beer from its Belgian bretheren. All in all it is a worthwhile effort."
"M&D: light-bodied, refreshing, low-fizziness on the palate, all guaranteeing a nice mouthfeel and quaffability. To me, a lover of English Bitter, this is my all-time favourite Belgian answer to a hoppy Bitter. A marvellous drink!"
"Highly recommended. This is what a Belgian IPA should be. Try this with some spicy (spiced, that is - not Habanero spicy) cheese. Nice pairing. Of course, this also stands on its own just fine."
"D: This is a nice and fresh and certainly very bitter take on a belgian IPA. Personally I think I enjoy Piraat's version better, but the two seem almost like completly different styles, the Piraat tasting much sweeter and this one a great deal more bitter, but really this is a very nice representation of belgian style."
"By far the hoppiest beer I've had from Belgium, yet it's fairly easy drinking. An 11.2 ounce bottle wasn't enough for me. Next time I'm going for the corked 750 ml bottle."
"Not a bad beer, but inferior in style to Hop-It in my opinion."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright golden-yellow, with a big, frothy pure white head that dissipates slowly and leaves fabulous lacing. Smell is nice and spicy, lots of noble hops showing up. Yeast and breadiness as well, and some fruity hints. Taste is very nice, bright and hoppy with lots of complexity. Citric notes and leafy notes alongside cloves and yeast, it's unique and very enjoyable. Mouthfeel is crisp, well carbonated, and full of body, and drinkability is excellent. Top-drawer beer."
"D: One of the few Belgian IPAs I have ever had, one of the most idiosyncratic flavours I have ever had in a beer. A nice experiment, but I don't know if I'll have it again, very pricey, but I'm glad I tried it."
"By blending the complex yeasty fruit character of a Belgian ale and the bone dry body of a good IPA, this superb hybrid truly delivers. Served on tap in a large Unibroue tulip at Brasserie V in Madison, WI. Appearance is a bit disappointing on tap as there is no head. This is partially the result of an overly generous and poorly executed pour but still, I would like to see a touch of lace at least. I dont recall having this problem when Ive consumed it out of the bottle. Body is light orange and clear. Aroma is clean and spicy with hints of citrus and floral hops and touches of fruity yeast. Taste contains a pale malt backbone but that is just an afterthought. Hops dominate this beer. Sharp citric flavors and feel hit the front of the palate while dry spicy notes pound the back. All the while a generic fruity (think cotton candy) yeast flavor balances and rounds everything out. The superb mouthfeel makes this beer fun to drink and the peppery dry finish makes it easy. A great beer."
"d: I only bought one bottle, but I will seek out more as this beer is unique in my experience."
"D_meh. This just doesn't quite meld like the Piraat. A good beer to try I suppose"
"D - Quite an interesting beer. The overall impression is of a German style pilsner, but this beer is much more complex than a pils. Some of the flavors are very surprising considering the beer's color. This is not a sessionable, easy drinking beer, but under the right circumstances it could be spectacular (perhaps with a cigar)."
"Drinkability: high!"
"D- This beer has nice big hops that are not American in flavor supported by some nice Belgian yeast notes. The crazy head kept me mesmerized while drinking."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, its a decent beer to stick with but it would not be my first choice."
"Slightly hazed golden colour with a bright white head that settled quickly to a short cap. The fine bubbles formed solid sheets of lace on my glass. Very hoppy aroma - earthy, floral, perfumy, woody - with a bit of spice and fruit character. Bitterness was very strong and lasted through the finish. It had a sweet-tart fruitiness and a mild malt presence. Hops were earthy and then spicy in the finish. Light bodied with considerable carbonation that gave it an airy texture. Slightly soapy, yet still with some dryness. Quite drinkable and very enjoyable on a hot day."
"This was a fantastic brew, but too bitter to really throw back to many of them, even one started to really build up on my tongue by the end."
"I still prefer the Chouffe Houblon."
"Wow very impressed fro the ""Hoppiest Beer of Belgium"" not strong like an American IPA. Creamy Head, Very light and crisp which makes it a great summer beer, and something that you can drink over and over again. It is not bitter like the name of it might suggest."
"Not as carbonated as some bottle conditioned Belgians, this one is a very nice hoppy import. Recommended for all to try."
"With this low of an ABV it is truly worthy of being a session beer. Must have more. This 750 will be gone sooner than I wish."
"A classic. I gave this beer the highest score because I am a combination belgian beer and hop lover. This combines the best of both worlds. A solidly bitter beer, unlike the appelation given to the British style, with Belgian ancestry. Nino explained to me that He wanted to start a brewery that brought Belgain beer back to its roots, hoppy and dry. Over the years with the conglomeration of breweries, in the world and in Belgium, many beers have lost their character and it has been replaced with a sickly sweet one. Nino hand picks his hops and a larger quanity is added to the kettle than you could imagine, but because the hops are low-alpha european varieties the effect is something completely unlike the super-hopped American styles. If you haven't already tried this award winner, you are seriously missing out."
"The mouthfeel was impressive -- light body, but huge profile (the hops I mentioned) which dries right up. However, I let my buddies finish this bottle up while I moved onto a Sixpoint growler, as I found it way too unbalanced. Disappointment."
"Belgian Pale Ales and IPAs are both some of the most drinkable styles around, and so it makes sense that a hybrid of the two would be just as drinkable, and it is."
"had this at the hopleaf, served in a small tumbler-type glass. poured a very hazy, orange/light amber. nice creamy tight head and lacing. aroma was phenomenal...i swear it was dominated by apricots. also some vegetal, grassy aromas as it opened up along with some doughy/malty notes. a bit of bready sweetness upfront is quickly followed by a good amount of hop bitterness, a touch less ibus than a big american ipa. finish is long and complex and mouthfeel is medium. nice carbonation in this one. definitely worth a try if you can find it."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"4s across the board, what can I say? No deficiencies to speak of and it's a nice blend of styles. Recommended."
"pours a hazy straw color with a big, fat, long-lasting white head on top, and gorgeous, sparkling lace down the glass. smell is grassy, floral, spicy, and lemony - very noble-hopppy - with nice bready malts and faint yeasty-funkiness. taste is fantastic, following suit from the smell, but with more sweetness from the pale malt and surprisingly refreshing! mouthfeel is slave to the champagne-like carbonation, but as a celebration drink, this beer is fantastic! highly recommended, if not a bit pricey..."
"D- a hoppy and bitter beer thats not ridiculously over hopped, awesome, though i could live with out that lemon flavor, i'd pass on another for now, but i can see this brew and me in the future."
"For what it is, it sees and raises the ante on US IPA's. Very balanced and tasty, exceptional drinkability. If it were a 750mL bottle, it would disappear just as fast."
"This is a bit dry for my taste, but I think that is true to the style. The bitterness is just not the kind is was hoping for. It is not balanced by any real malty body or alcohol taste. At $13 for a bottle I will probably never buy this again, although I will certainly finish this one."
"Pours a hazed gold with a big bubbly head at first, but then subsides. Head clings a bit to the glass on the sips, but doesn't leave much lacing to speak of, but some scattered spots. Some sweet pale malts up front in the nose, and some mild esters. Pretty clean for a Belgian. Hops take on an herbal and floral presence. In the flavor, a malty sweetness is presented at first, which is then followed by herbal and grassy hops. I somehow get a flavor of caraway in the middle. What follows the hop flavors is a bitterness that lingers on past the finish while bready and nutty malts come to the forefront in the aftertaste. Overall hop character in this hoppy Belgian reminds me of an assertive pils. Body is pretty lightweight with a carbonation that tingles the tongue, which I think is right on considering what this is going for in the flavor profile. 11.2 oz. is not enough of this."
"If you can't decide between having a Belgian Pale or an IPA, this could fill both cravings. Certainly worth checking out."
"This beer is very hoppy and dry compared to most other Belgian ales (hence the name, right?). Interesting, layered and complex, though subtle and not over-powering."
"VERY light and refreshing; I wouldn't be surprised if there were adjuncts. Don't get me wrong, because I really like it. Tiny bubbles, like a champagne mouthfeel, with a dry finish. If I lived in Belgium I might drink this like I drink Big Daddy IPA now. Cheers!"
"750 ml bottle, wrapped in paper. Freshness date clearly printed on the paper which tells me that the beer will be good until May 2011. That means it was bottled May 2006. Enjoyed in large, bulbous wine glasses. Pours a beautiful golden straw color with a bit of cloudiness as some yeast sediment spilled into the glass. Big fluffy, white head that faded to a thin ring around the glass. Well...guess what...it smells like hops! Wow, big strong hop aroma here. Fresh, grassy, slightly piny hops with hints of that fruity Belgian yeast aroma. Medium bodied with refreshing, tiny bubbled carbonation. Starts out with those fruity flavors, I'm getting a little bit of banana and tart apples...just a little though. That is followed by the super crisp hop flavors. Not resinous like American IPA's, but clean and dry with a strong bitter finish. Oh, and underneath it all is a subtle dry, biscuity malt flavor. This has possibly the most enjoyable bitterness I've ever had. My only gripe with this beer is that I don't find it very drinkable due to its strong bitterness. The more I drank, the more the bitterness seemed to numb my palate to the other flavors. Other than that, this stuff is just amazing and hard to believe that it comes from Belgium."
"Really good, and completely original and interesting."
"Basically, if you don't like hops, obviously the ""hoppiest beer in Belgium"" isn't probably something you would be interested in trying in the first place. So assuming you do, this is a gem for sure. It has the usual golden ale characteristics with a supercharged hop make-up. Definitely worth a shot...or two...or ten."
"The bitterness is the selling point and a true strength, but it's the busy, organized-frenzy blend that makes this so refreshing and enjoyable. It's so clean that each sip asks for another, making it gladly drinkable, if you like its traits. It's pretty, involved, and worth the measure of attention it demands."
"I've been working my way through the Belgian IPA offerings and this beer has been on my radar for quite some time. This is a unique treat that really sets the benchmark high for hoppy Belgian beers."
"This Belgian IPA poured a hazy, light amber color with strong, fine carbonation, and fluffy, off-white, stiff (meringue-like) foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was strong, aromatic, noble hops. Very nice. The taste was dominated by the hops: strong, bitter and floral hoppiness. This was combined with a nice, dry maltiness. A wonderful marriage of flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and strong carbonation. It had a light, airy feel on the tongue. The hop flavors lingered on the back of the tongue. This is a beautiful beer."
"D: Tasty hops and nice complexity coupled with 6.2% abv make the drinkability good on this one...if you get a good bottle. My experience with this beer has been hit or miss to say the least, both in bottles and on draft. I've had bottles of this from the same case that have been very good (like this one) to almost drain pour (the whole bottle tasted like mouthfull after mouthfull of dirt). I had it on draft at Map Room once and it also tasted like dirt! Strange."
"This beer is incredibly refreshing and drinkable. I wish I could afford a few hundred bottles of it. It would make for many great food pairings and enjoyable moments. A classic!"
"Mouthfee/Drinkabiity; as I said above, at first this was a bit harsh with the carbonation, but that settled down to become pretty smooth, with medium body. The drinkability ends up pretty very good on this one."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into an Orval glass. The head is big carbonation and white. The color is a murky, orange; much like a Julius Etcher hefe. Unfiltered, but no big particals floating around. The taste is a clean bitterness that is ""the hoppist Belgian beer"" is maybe true. There is a rawness in the body and flavor that is sweet smooth texture. The flavors are the hops and the yeast variety. The body is medium and I finished the bottle myself and that's all I need in a sitting of this brew."
"Drinks fairly easy, says it's the hoppiest ale in Belgium & to my knowledge they might be right. Granted they cheated by going low on the abv 6.2%/malt profile by Belgian standards. I liked this & wished it wasn't so expensive ($4.50 a bottle)"
"Pours a cloudy orangish yellow under a slightly off-white two finger head that fades quite slowly but doesn't leave much in the way of lace. The nose is very floral, reminiscent of carnations, with a bit of spice. The mouth is surprisingly light and very prickly. The taste opens with a more traditional Francophone fruitiness with hints of coriander and cassis. The hops kick in fairly quickly though, overwhelming the fruit and turning the lighter spices into a pretty sharp espresso bitter. The hops are not overpowering by any means, but they are insistent into the finish, then fade fairly quickly in the aftertaste, leaving just a faint memory of their bitterness. An interesting hybrid of traditional Belgian and new age hoppiness. I like it."
"What a wonderful beer. Just had to get that out of the way before I started. 750 mL, corked, crowned, and wrapped in paper - very elegant presentation. The wrapping tells me that is it best before June 2010 (making June '05 the bottling date) and the label mistakenly identifies the bottle as 11.2 oz. It pours a bright, unfiltered yellow/gold with medium carbonation and a beautiful, fluffy, four finger, bone-white head that leaves big clumps of lace on my tulip. Subsequent pours make the beer more and more transluscent. The aroma has noble hops aplenty, with oily, soapy?, grassy, and spicy notes, along with some medicinal phenols. On the palate it is a showcase of spicy, floral, perfumy, piney?, and grassy hops, with clean, pale malts in the back, giving only enough flavor to balance the medium bitterness. In addition, there are phenols and notes of green apple, melon rind, and yeast on top of a medium body that retains medium carbonation all the way through, leaving a medium to long finish. I really like the way they hopped this beer - it reminds me of a well-crafted pilsner, but so much better. There is a huge hop presence, but the bitterness is well-calibrated and, although it is heady, it's light enough in alcohol to make it a session beer. Amazing to say the least. The only downside is the price tag ($13), but I'm willing to splurge on this beauty at least once more."
"This poured a golden straw color that's very clear, many columns of tiny bubbles rising to a 1 ½ finger white head. The aroma is light fruitiness, floral, and slight spicy noble hop, Saaz like presence. The taste seems to have the same citrus, floral, and spice hop flavors melded with a nice pale Belgian malt profile. The malt adds nice sweetness that tries to balance out the hops, but it fails to do this, perfectly. There's isn't a overpowering ""Belgian yeast"" flavor, and that's good. Light bubbly carbonation in the mouth, and it finishes nice and dry. This is low in alcohol, great tasting, and has a crisp refreshing quality to it. Well done."
"This isnt as much like Orval as I was anticipating. Its paler, less funky and has a very different mouthfeel. That is irrelavant though because its still a damn good beer."
"""Best Before"" January 2011 notched on the bottom of the label. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a pale orangish amber color with a creamy white head. There is a lot of yeast on the bottom of the bottle and I found that it just intensifies the taste and aroma when included in the pour. Beautiful aroma that is sour with a yeasty and floral spicyness. I am really digging the taste. It is bitter that finishes dry and spicy. Not much in the malt department, but that is not what this beer is about. Overall, this instantly climbs the ranks as one of my favorites. This is simply a superbly crafted brew."
"The yeast pour thickens the beer, but doesn't do much to lower the hop bite."
"Drinkability: wonderful belgian pale ale that can almost be considered a session beer. Easy to drink and very enjoyable on the tastebuds."
"A very good brew. Had this on-tap at the Map Room in Chicago. It's a hazy golden color with some bubbles, a small white head, and good lacing. The nose is very nice. It's a complex blend of hops and wheat, smells very ""fresh," with a hint of citrus and some airy grains. Taste is a balance of hops and malts, slighty fruity up front with the namesake bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and full. Drinkability is good."
"D - Tasty stuff and pretty drinkable."
"This beer was unique to me, probably the most bitter Belgian I can remember trying. The flavor is complex, and the bitterness is heavenly. Highly recommended..."
"D - Quaffable. Dinner's best friend. Sessionable (sans price tag of course). Worth seeking. All around impressive. This bottle will have no difficulty disappearing. Since it is $9 a fifth, I won't be seeing this for a long time I fear . . . but someday, we shall meet again!"
"This beer unquestionably lived up to its name."
"Drinkability - this is decent, but not great, and something I'd get only once -in-a-while."
"this beer pours a cloudy golden yellow with orange accents (i poured the yeast) with a large, off white rocky head. the smell has a yogurty sourness with some piney hops, belgian spice, some woody elements/ something else i cannot identify. taste is of very bitter hops, spice, golden maltiness and some sourness. very nice velvety mouthfeel. solid, delicious beer that bends style boundaries. a little hard on the wallet at $3.99 for a 330cl, but worth it once in awhile. purchased at cellar's in roseville, MN."
"750ml bottle. A cloudy yellow-orange pour, slightly hazy, with a large rocky off-white head. The head subsided fairly quickly and left a reasonable amount of lacing. Nose is citrus, primarily lemon, a faint earthiness, and some scent of apple. The taste was, surprise, rather bitter (grapefruit). I also picked up a melon like flavor that I have only tasted in Fantome before. Towards the middle, there is a phenol/medicinal taste, and finally pepper in the finish. Very light and highly carbonated, quite drying. Highly drinkable, another nice hoppy Belgian."
"Overall Impression: Good hoppy beer, very unusual for Belgium. Doesnt stand a snowballs chance against any American Pale Ale, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall: I've been on a major hop vacation, and perhaps I never really understood Saaz, but it was quite a quaffer despite its harshness"
"Highly drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable. Strikes a balance between the hopheads and the Belgian enthusiasts. A must try."
"Very good and surprising Belgium. Recommended for sure."
"Drinkability and Overall: A complex, damn near challenging brew I'd have trouble putting down more than one of. A lot is happening on my palate, and it's a bit confusing and ubalanced. The bitterness is almost out of control, and I think the label brandishing the phrase ""the hoppiest beer in Belgium"" may be true. Enjoy."
"This is a unique brew and very drinkable...not a high ABV...I consider it a stand alone beer, but I'm sure this would also go very well with a seafood dinner. Great stuff if you like bitter brews."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Starts balanced between bitter and sweet, hoppier than usual for a Belgian but nothing like the heavyhanded hops we get here. Smooth finish. Best before 4/2010 and this has only 6.2% ABV. $3.85 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability: I personally find this flavor delicious. The bitterness is not the aromatic type that goes up your nose, it's just on the tongue and all the tartness is delicious. Great beer and great Belgian pale ale."
"""The hoppiest beer in Belgium""? I'd stop short of calling myself an expert on the subject, but, in my humble, somewhat versed opinion, I would agree."
"I feel this beer is 1-dimensional, the bitterness leaves little room for other flavors to come out. Nevertheless, a good beer."
"An interesting and enjoyable beer. A nice fruitty tartness lends a good deal to its drinkability and this is not the bitter that one might expect. Mildly bitter with a noticable hop character that indeed balanced well. This beer deserves the praise it gets. Very enjoyable, excellent in the summer, and one I'll have again for sure."
"this is good. i'm looking forward to the pere noel i've got (perhaps i should throw that in the fridge so it doesn't explode as well)"
"11.2 of this nectar is not enough. If you've been scared to pull the trigger because of the price tag, get over it. Hellaciously good."
"CRUX: GREAT BELGIAN PALE ALE. One of the hoppiest Belgians? Nah, but a very enjoyable brew, and I appreciate it immensely, but I wish it was, uh, cheaper. I'd get this again, though."
"thanks to Malto for this sample. Golden orange colour with a big head this is a strange beer in that it has all the citrus, big yeasty notes of a Belgian pale ale but there is considerable US style hope that come across in the nose and the finish. A very nice combo of old and new world and a overall big balanced flavour."
"Notes: The hoppy dry powder effect really controls this brew. I never let the price dictate the final score as I would have scored this the same at $1 or $100 dollars but for a staggering $15 bucks I'll pass next time I'm around this offering....is it hella good? You bet but far from excellence."
"I am truly impressed. It would have been easy to brew a heavy-handed hoppy Belgian ale, it is truly skillful to brew a hoppy beer with restraint and keep so much flavor! What a playful beer. The more I quaff the more I like it. This is so damn drinkable! I hope this beer will be available in Omaha soon. I purchased this bottle in Lincoln, NE a few months ago plus I lost these notes for about a month. Recommended."
"Gold. Aroma of of mainly fruity hops (nectarine, apricot, peach), herbs, dough, caramel and butter toffee. Characterful hop flavor. I wonder if the Belgians like this stuff or if they think it is over the top. Notes of peach, nectarine and lemon. Great hop flavor without much bitterness. Nice balance and texture. A different, but worthy saison."
"Tasted bitter (yes!), at first but then mellowing into a very nice flavoured ale. Mouthfeel was very very good. Very nice to swirl about. Very drinkable."
"mouthfeel is great. nice and creamy but with a dry finish. highly drinkable, but a bit expensive."
"Yeast clouded white body, head is ample, leaving a nice amount of lace on the way down. Citrus hops are present, slightly sweet. Taste is hoppy, yes, but the hoppiest Belgian beer? Doubt it. It does have a nice sharp but refreshing flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy, carbonated well enough. Drinkability is good, I could session these easily, if the price wasn't so prohibitive."
"Straw colored gold and very hazy, this beer is topped by a clumpy white head that looks like it will stay around for days. The aroma has a bit of bread dough, some mild orange, and light caramel, and a bit of hop flower. The flavor moderates the Belgian triple character. The orange and yeast notes are there, but the bitterness from the hops is more pronounced. It resonates throughout the entire drink. Nor residual sweetness, which I like. Full and slick mouth feel, with a mild alcohol heat on the finish. I had this beer on tap more than a year ago. Its great to finally have it from the bottle."
"Overall - An excellent beer !! Highly recommended !! Pretty unusual for a Belgian..."
"Drinkability: This is a very clean tasting easy drinking beer. I think this beer has redefined what a Belgian beer is like for me."
"Served in a 750ml bottle with cork and crown cap. Pours hazy golden color with a large frothy white head. Smells yeasty with hints of citrus. Taste is such of belgain pale ale, with more bitterness than usual. Very yeasty with a spicy citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is good and well carbonated. Very good on drinkabilty."
"A unique style for a Belgian brew; think Fantome meets Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Great balance and flavors. At 6.2% abv, this makes for an interesting session Belgian."
"This beer pours very cloudy with sandy dust piles and granules clinging to the side of the glass. The head is an enormous white pillow set atop this golden cascading waterfall. Smells like fresh fields of grains found throughout the midwest and tastes fresh with lemon hints springing right out of it. A delicious brew that delivers exactly what one would expect going in."
" This reminds me of the shock of my first taste of Ruination. This is a lot hoppier than my previous year old bottle led me to believe. No citrus, just a clean bitterness. Some yeast notes. Mouthfeel is quite lively. I'm glad this is a 750."
"One of the most beautiful heads I have seen - Small bubbles and creaminess combined, keeping the great aroma coming out. Nice leafy hops that are a little spicy and a little citrusy. Very very dry but not harsh at all. Finish lasts a long time and continues with the hoppy leafiness. So very smooth and drinkable. An amazing brew that shows that the potential of hoppy brews when they are polished."
"Sits a hazy straw color in my glass with a frothy, pale, off-white head that fades after a bit of time. The aroma is herbal with lots of hoppy notes to it. There is a sharp bitterness cuts throughout the flavor notes of this beer. It is quite herbal as well with a raw grassiness to it. The hops clearly dominate this beer: bitter, chewy and raw, dominating any light malt character that might be present. There is a bit of a tart lemon-like character here, which seems to be hop derived as well. This is quite tasty, though it seems a lot cleaner than the bottled version that I am used to. I definitely like it, but I think I prefer the funkiness that is found in the bottled version."
"The taste in this beer was exactly what an extra hoppy Belgian pale ale, like an Orval would take like. Juicy sweet and a detecable yeast please the palate. The hops seem to be low alphasin this brew. Finish is crisp from the bitterness and carbonation. This is a great Belgian pale ale, and at 6% or so is ideal for quaffing. I think the tag of ""Belgium's hoppiest beer"" may dissappoint some American hop-heads but it's a good into into this classic style."
"Interestingly and experimental. It's a great Belgian even without the hopping. The aromas bring out citrus, tartness, lemon, grapefruit, muskiness, yeast, spice, and sweetness. The hazy golden brew has a fizzy head that retains really well. Tastes sweet and tart at first, but then intense hop flavor comes through in the form of lemons and grapefruit. Combined with the fruity belgian peaches and pears, with spices of corriander and pepper-like prickling. Bitter in the finish with a lingering belgian malt flavor. Alcohols are a little plastic-like, but easy to ignore. The body is light and creamy. The hops give a mild oily and protein thickness--a good combination here. Will have again."
"750ml bottle wrapped in paper. Pours out a cloudy golden orange with a tall pillowy white head that drops slowly. Plenty of thick hoppy lacing rings left stuck to the glass. Light grassy and citric hops. Some lighter yeast notes and a bit of spice. Taste has a pretty big yeasty bready backing. Plenty of grassy and earthy hops. Light sweetness. Very much seems like a Belgian IPA. Ends on a funky hoppy bitter note. Solid body with the right amount of carbonation and quite damn drinkable. Good stuff and quite unique."
"Get some MF!"
"Definitely one to enjoy in a snifter or tulip shaped glass, and not too cold. Everyone has their personal preferences, but this one is already very high on my list as a Belgian classic. Highly reccommend."
"Deep gold in colour. Aromas of eggshell, grapefruit, black pepper, and grassy hops. The flavors start as tropical fruity and yeasty, then progress into bitter hops and the horseblanket that is typical of a saison. Fuller in the mouth than expected, but this is not a bad thing."
"The taste was superb! That lemony smell translated into a very hoppy/lemony taste that hit my palate on nothing but positive tones. Boy....am I sad that I only bought 1 bottle....this is GREAT stuff! Hoppay! ;^)"
"It took a great deal of effort to remove the cork from this bottle of De Ranke XX Bitter, but it was worth every grunt and heave. I don't believe I've ever had a Belgian pale ale that can compare to this one. Although it isn't the bitter bomb that I was expecting, it is the hoppiest non-U.S. beer I've ever had. All things considered, it's probably a better beer than the one that lived in my hop-fevered imagination. Refined. World-Class. Highly recommended."
"This brewery delivers a good product."
"A beer like no other, for sure."
"Smooth mouth. The carbonation is strong, but it doesn't cut through all of the malt or hop oils. An excellent session beer when craving hops that aren't over the top."
"This is probably the most hop-intensive brew I have reviewed so far. Great stuff."
"Pours a nice light copper and makes a small yet dense white head and leaves a very nice lacing on my glass. Aroma is really huge, slightly funky barnyard to start and then very piney, loaded up with the hops, this is the hoppiest belgian brewed beer I have ever put under my nose. Flavor starts out rather bitter, more piney hop character, sweet malts, light alcohol bite. Mmmm, so this is a belgian IPA... I like it. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, creamy sweet finish leaves some sticky coating on the palate. I like this alot, I have sampled on a couple other occassions... however, I was holding out for a fresh bottle before I reviewed it. This is really great."
"Without the hops this beer would have struck me as a Saison, or even a heavy duty Gueuze (minus the lactic characters). As it is, it stands by itself in style as a delicious and unique brew."
"The taste is hoppy, the bitterness hits you first followed by a balance of fruity touchs, then the bitterness of the hops come hit you again. An aftertaste of wood and spices come in too. Some shy notes of coffee are present, now I don't know how to explain these flavours of coffee but they are present especially in the aftertaste, similar to the bitterness of coffee I quess. Pineapples flavours come tickles the palate , notes of phenols and pinewood"
"I'd heard this was a hoppier pale ale but i didnt know what to expect. Its amazing, so drinkable and full of hoppy flavour along with a smooth typically belgian character"
"everything takes a back seat to hoppiness in this beer. i liked it."
"The drinkability of this beer was incredible. If I could afford it, I could drink this all evening with good food and good friends."
"Flaming golden yellow with vigorous carbonation quite visible to the naked eye. A nice crop of airy white head crowns the beer. Retention is fabulous and lace ability even better. Interesting blend of Belgian yeast spiciness and citric hoppiness on the nose. Also some candy and dough. Very solid nose. Upon tasting I think, ""Wow!! This is some damn unique beer."" All the great properties of a nicely put together Belgian beer with the added oomph of hop flavor and bitterness. The bitterness is actually fairly sharp, but not out of place. It really doesn't hit you till about 5 seconds after you swallow. There's nice doughiness and candy qualities on the palate. And also spicy, peppery, earthy tones reminiscent of a nice saison. This beer melts in your mouth like cotton candy. It just dissolves away...all too quickly. Great stuff."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a hazy, golden orange color with a frothy, white head. Lacing is minimal due to the oily consistency. Smells (and tastes) mostly of spices, yeast, and phenols. Lingering, dry aftertaste. I bought this beer because it's the self-proclaimed ""Hoppiest Beer of Belgium"". Not much to brag about, considering I can probably think of nearly a hundred brews made in America that are more hoppy. Sorry, but for me, this beer has ""average"" written all over it.."
"Pours a cloudy, golden orangish-yellow with a nice foamy white head, a beautiful belgian pale. Aroma is of grassy, floral hops with a light, bready malt background...this is quite a different style of belgian pale ale. Taste is quite hoppy, with phenolic, mineraly, grassy and floral hops flavors being prevalent. There's also a sturdy and lightly fruity malt character with flavors of apple, lemon and unbaked bread. The bitterness is truly unique because no other beer that is so hoppy uses mostly Hallertau and Brewers Gold hops. Really an excellent and unique belgian, a classic in my opinion. Mouthfeel is crisp and carbonation is high, kind of like a hoppy champagne beer. Drinkability is quite good. An excellent brew."
"I like this beer, but I am put off by the aroma - perhaps it is the particular strain of yeast being used. It is quite drinkable, though, and refreshing."
"Soooo very good."
"Despite De Ranke's standing as one of the world's finest I'm still waiting to be impressed."
"Crisp, somewhat dry mouthfeel. Very enjoyable beer. Thanks to Venom for filling my glass again and again."
"If heaven was only a mouthful away, this could very well be one of the keys to unlock the gate. Character is all over the board. I can not imagine anything else of this style that could stand along side this beer without looking microscopic in proportion, but I can only hope it exists. Bottle consumed without second thought."
"Pours like wavy fileds of grain--but with a nice thick and foamy head. Slight carbonation, but does not hold throughout the drinking process. Aroma is my favorite part. Sweet Belgian sugars but with a very bold hop notes in the background. Strong grains too. I couldnt wait for the head to reside and try this beer. I was a little worried when I popped off the cap that it had corked because beer had worked its way on top of the cork. But it must have happened rcently because the underside of the cork was still clean. At first I thought it was sour, but then after a few minutes I just realized it was more bitter than I am accustomed to for the style. Not sweet like a Blegian pale ale but more bitter like an American. also the grains and sugars came through more to complete a really nice balance. Mouthfeel finishes very dry; this would go well with a fruit dessert. Tough to drink this one slow."
"Good Lord."
"Beer had a low carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. I miss the beer of old."
"drinkability: as long as you're ready for the bitterness at the end, i think you'll find this quite drinkable and pleasing. was with a friend that was turned off by its bitterness though, and you don't expect it from a golden beer. also, the 6.2% abv seems misleading. it's bigger than that, but perhaps this just means you can have one more..."
"edit: bumped up several scores.. this stuff is great! Dry, bitter, herbal, medicinal. Bracing bitterness and nice carbonation make it great. No maltiness. Slightly sour. Buy and Drink!"
"There is everything here to please the most hardcore Saison freak while also appealing to the less committed bitter, dry, pale lowland ale enthusiast. No wonder this is such a crossover beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin, drinkability is decent. I don't know if I'll buy this again next time I am craving a fine belgian ale, but I'm glad I tried it. I'd choose an Orval over this for a belgian pale any day."
"The mouthfeel was pretty good, and drinkability also fine. This was like a Belgian IPA... an interesting animal, and I am glad I tried it."
"Smooth once warmer. A very unique and quaffable Belgian."
"The mouthfeel is medium/big with a very smooth, creamy texture. It has a huge finish bursting with juicey hops and a hint of yeasty bread. I can tell right now that this will be something I will be craving from now on. Worth 10-12$ a bottle? You bet your ass it is!"
"pours a murky yellow with little-to-no carbonation, some floating and shifting particles of sediment which i mistook for bubbles. syrupy and flat like a nectar of sorts.. hop nectar, i guess. smells very hoppy with a light sweetness. taste is super bitter. sure, it's called 'bitter', but being belgian i did expect something more mild. not my cup of tea at all despite its uniqueness. will not drink this beer again."
"Drinkability- The most bitter non-US beer I think I have ever had. Not bad, the metallic taste kinda takes it down a notch for me though."
"Taste starts out with acidic, bitter hop juices that are lemony and ganja-ish. Light, biscuity malt base comes in with a noticeable yeast component. Hops last throughout, and get bitterer near the finish. Slightly numbing, a touch sappy, and some mintiness all come through. Very nice. Finish is bitter and yeasty with some lingering wheaty biscuit malt. Medium-bodied, creamy mouthfeel, with a dry, appetizing finish. This is definitely the hoppiest Belgian beer I've ever had. And hopefully I'll have it again."
"First of all the 750 ml. bottle with the decorative paper wrap sprang out at me from the shelf. This Belgian bitter displayed a golden color with a creamy head. Very appetizing! I sensed the aroma of citrus, a hint of lemon, and a plethora of hops. It was very smooth and drinkable. A great session beer! Very well balanced with an excellent lingering hop aftertaste."
"Destroyed a rack of ribs with this beauty - Belgiums boost my appetite."
"Bottle: Poured a pale yellowish kind of beer with a medium head with better then average retention. Aroma is quite hoppy thought not in the American sense (IPA) but more in the sense of Orval. Taste is also impregnated with the hops and you can feel brett yeast all the way through. Not too sure of what to make of this one since it seems to exist outside of my usual beer boundaries."
"Has a deep, sparkling gold color, with a pungent hop aroma. So hoppy, and yet the hops are so different than what is found in hoppy American ales. Feels like a slick, spongey bitter coating of hop residue is left on the tongue with every sip. Flavor is light and citrusy, yet finishes like eating a pinecone. Stands up to its name, and though its not overpowering, it is quite bitter. Quite tasty too. If it was easily found in mass quantity, this would be a hell of a session."
"Very interesting presentation of the bottle. Its wrapped in paper with a lot # of 000016 in a 25.4 oz. bottle. It was almost like opening a present on Christmas. Upon opening, I find that it is corked and capped, quite a combo. It also appears that the label on the bottle itself is wrong, as it states the bottle as only 11.2 fl. oz. Hhhmmm. Anyway, onto the beer. The nose is lemony, hoppy, sprucey, and just plain awesome. The body is crystal golden that appears just a bit more yellowish tint than anything. The head is big and pillowy with good traction on the lace. The mouthfeel is liquid yet edgy, good combo. Among the huge hop bitterness, a few flavors intermingle; a lemon, grainy, and some orange rind notes appear. The finish definitely has a lemon pucker to it, but it quickly mellows into a more balanced offering. Its just a little more piney than the body and just dry enough from the dosage of hops. Outstanding brew, definitely in my personal top 10."
"On-tap poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light yellow-orange color with two fingers of head. There is a good deal of lacing left on the glass. The smell is both sweet and bitter, with some lemon and grassy aromas going on. The taste is malty and sweet at first, then has a little saaz hop bitterness and lemon pepper spice. The body is fairly nice and thick. The drinkability is awesome. This is a unique hoppy treat from the land of beer."
"This may be one of the very few beers I prefer in a bottle to draft."
"A very balanced brew, despite being Belgiums hoppiest. It is indeed and entirely different interpretation than say Orval.. but a treat nonetheless."
"25.4oz bottle. Pours a yellow color with a huge head that sticks around nad leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly European hops - nice and subtle - with some spicy malt for the backing. The flavor is very smooth. The hops give a great bitter character that isn't over the top. The malts back it up nicely and it has a slightly spiciness that makes it very nice."
"11.2 oz bottle served into a tulip glass. Whoa! Lots of foam here, and a messy pour. Slightly hazed golden yellow body underneath an enormous, pitted, head. Hard to believe so much foam came out of such a small bottle, with a delicate pour. Lots of patchy lacing is no surprise, after the head settles down a bit. Aroma has some citrusy lemon, spicy coriander, Saaz hops, and dank yeastiness. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, with that Belgian effervesence. Dryness is immediately apparent. Light medium body. Unusual taste for a Belgian ale(label proclaims this ""the hoppiest beer of Belgium""), with leafy, dry hops. Some white grape fruitiness lurks underneath and is the saving grace of this ale. Otherwise, a bit chalky and dry, with a dank yeast note and some coriander spiciness. Not as hoppy as an APA or IPA, but certainly more hoppy than other Belgians I've sampled. A nice session ale at 6% abv, and a most interesting take on a Belgian Golden Ale."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. We're ringing in the new year in style. Beer number 5, and counting down to new years eastern. This one pours a very nice yellowed orange color with a very explosive head that overflowed the bottle upon uncorking it. Stickey lace is hanging in as heavy as I've ever seen it as the head recedes towards the beer. The nose is full of Saaz and Hallertau hops, very much like a highly hopped pilsner would smell in my mind. Underneath the hops there is a really nice orangey spicey character that lets me know this is a Belgian as well. Hmm. I think this is going to be a highlite for me. The flavor is really nice. A nice light hop that is hanging over the sweet and spicey malt. I do like it. The feel is moderate to thick and a nice slight creamy as well. Drinkability is really good. I'm happy to see a Belgian with a decent hop flavor. I do recommend this beer. Good show de Ranke."
"I have a hard time admitting it, but I may like this more than Orval, my favorite of this style. They each do things slightly differently, so I'll call it a draw. But oh, man, this is one of the best beers I've ever had, and this is from someone who generally prefers malty to hoppy!"
"This the easiest drinking belgian pale ale I have ever had. This was amazing. We went through two 750 ml bottles in a heart beat and were cursing ourselves that we did not buy 8 more bottles for the evening. This is amount the three great belgian beers in my opinon, with Saison Dupont and Hommel Popperings."
"Christmas night and drnking enjoying with friends... somhow have to go to the computer; feel the need to jidge. Why? cause i have a beer in my hands that is exceptional! Noce white head with a bright white coloer. Nose is hoppy, fruity and a wonderfull sweetness. Dry but clean hoppy taste with only litle malts and yeast, happily for that if you have such a nice hoppy flavour! Aftertaste only hop of the finest! Great beer if you like Humulus lupilus at his best!"
"on tap at the Moan and Dove. Golden, hazy, white head, strikingly good looking lace. hop/yeast nose, yum yum, this is gonna be good my senses tell me. Medium bodied brew. Gobs of Belgian yeast notes, fruity, spicy, earthy, phenolic. Crushing and crisp hops very evident, spice in the back ground, a bunch of yeast gremlins dancing around in the rear. Complex, sophisticated and mostly just fine and tasty. Seek and enjoy."
"Personally, I could do without the Rodenbach yeast, but its hard to argue with the complexity and of the results. I like a beer thats a little challenging, in concept and in flavor and this one achieves both. Of all the Belgians I've had, this is one I'd actively search out to buy again."
"Edit: I think I was in an IPA phase when I first tried this beer. I guess I was dissapointed that it wasn't as hoppy as I thought it might be due to it proclaiming itself ""the hoppiest beer in Belgium."" But on a second sampling this beer is just so good. I've come to appreciate the more subtle hop flavors and bitterness. This stuff is so good. Yum. Yum."
"Drinkability: This is a good Belgian Pale Ale worth trying, but it is not a blockbuster. I would certianly drink it again given the chance, but I wouldn't go looking for it myself."
"Grapefuit juice hazy yellow-orange color with a creamh white head. Lacing is just clinging all the way down the glass. The aroma is very citrusy, lemon zesty, slightly phenolic and yeasty as well. Whoa, this is one bitter Belgian bitch. Not at all what I was expecting. The flavor is slightly fruity and citrusy, which flows to a earthy, spicy bitterness, with a light touch of malt in the back. This brew is bitter all the way through. It is as bitter as some IPAs I've had, if not more. It has a light mouthfeel and is easy going down. A really interesting Belgian. This one is going to make me hungry."
"It all comes back to me...the boisterous head atop the cloudy yellow beer. Lacing everywhere. Aromas are a mix of orange rind, peppery spices, and fresh grassy hops. Flavor is a Belgian crossed with a big-time IPA. Loads of complexity roll across the palate. Dark fruits, hops....ending with a dryness infused with lemon rind. Great body and extremely drinkable. Awesome."
"Medium bodied"
"Feel is quick and clean with an overall clean and favorable dry medium body thats got a nice fluffy carbonation thats fulfillingly smooth and bready. Quite drinkable in that regards. Slides right down with ease and carries a nice finish of hop character and flavors the whole ride through without alot of hankering bitterness. Which I wouldn't mind having show up more in this one, but as is this is one fine dandy, drinkable, dry hopped ale. I think I'll have another thank you. And a thanks to truthbrew for the many bottles."
"Excellent murky golden color and frothy head, one of the best. Smells like a nice pilsner with a hint of lemon. Tastes exactly like a pilsner with a hint of lemon. Crisp, clean mouth feel, with a watery finish. And an average drink ability because pilsners are just not for me. Although I would say that this is the best pilsner I have had (technically it's not a pils, but it pretty much is)."
"Cloudy maize with a big, billowing white head and solid lacing. Pronounced hop aroma with mild citrus and sponge cake. There's an amazing amount of hop bitterness to this beer, but unlike most English/American takes, the initial flavors one encounters in this beer are well spiced and completely unique. Banana, lemon, and even some phenolic, plastic clove flavor comes through. Mineral water and a raw, oily feel lend a certain dull weight to this beer. Heavy, despite it's ""fluffy"" appearance. A true Belgian pale ale with a heavy dosage of hops. This is something yeasty, complex, wild, and uniquely Belgian with an intense bitterness around the edges. Even better fresh and on draft."
"Light, crisp and flavorful. Great drinkability."
"75 cl corked and capped bottle dated best before 12-2008. Pours a hazy, golden peach color with a huge light cream colored head that's lasting and leaving lace as it slowly subsides. Big fresh, floral hop aroma (I'm picking up on some Saaz and Hallertau), somewhat spicy in character. Decent malt backbone evident, but the beer's yeastiness seems to shine brighter than the malt, but the winner is the hops. Very dry on the palate, spicy and white peppery, with a hint of citrus, but it gets lost in the mix. Silky mouthfeel with excellent carbonation keeps the drinker sipping. Highly enjoyable, refreshing and jaw-droppingly delicious."
"It pours a muddy golden with an honest off-white head from which only a film will last. Lets take note that this bottle is a year and a few months past 1 yr old, so the bitterness level must not be what it used to be. First sniff indicated very yeasty aspects that remind me of a cement-floored basement with a bit too high of a humidity level, a fair bit too many cobwebs hanging on the ceiling and just too much dust on the books that decorate the walls. Nevertheless, the hops are strong although not as agressive as I thought, reading the labels, I see theyve used hallertau which I love. Its very floral, lemony, slightly resiny, lightly orangey. In mouth, the musty yeast and noble hops work very well together. Its extremely refreshing, salty with a moderate bitter attack that finishes spicy. Silky medium body. Excellent, I guess the age made it wonders for me, not being a fan of very citrusy and sour american IPAs."
"Notes: Very drinkable."
"Had this beauty at Beermania in Brussels as well .. this is the hop monster of belgium. Pale golden color with a wonderful white lasting head in the goblet. Big wonderful hop field (sweet flower grassy) nose. Gentle coating mouth lovingly surrounds the tongue. Lingering flowery taste calls you to drink more.. An awesome hoppy pale ale. Good until 2008. I love this beer.. very very drinkable."
"Oh those wacky Belgian beers. This one is pretty weird I have to admit. Poured out a light orange color with a massive head that took a few minutes to settle down. Smell consisted of lots of yeast and hops. Taste was bitter alright. Lemon, hops, herbs, and spiciness all come through and blend together. It finish quite dry which I didn't like about this brew. I would of preferred if it had a wet aftertaste. Even though the taste was nice, I wouldn't want more than a glass. But it's an interesting brew and look for this one in stores."
"De Ranke XX Bitter is billed as Belgium's Hoppiest Beer and comes in a paper-wrapped 750ml bottle with a wine-style cork and beer style cap. The label says 11.2 oz, but the bottle is obviously a 750ml. I poured my into a Duvel tulip glass; it formed a thick creamy white head atop a slightly cloudy golden ale. Aroma is full of piney, spicy hops. Taste is bitter, with some yeasty flavor and some slight Belgian barnyard flavors and some floral notes as well. A delicious beer that belies the notion that Belgians only use stale hops. One of my favorite beers right now - wonderful on tap as well."
"Beautiful persistent creamy head. Pale golden color, very slightly opaque. The smell is hoppy, herbal, grassy, slightly citric. The hops overwhelm most of the taste. The only other thing thats noticeable is some sweet citrus, Id say grapefruit. Hops are herbal, fruity and mostly powerful. They remain forever in the aftertaste. A nice hoppy beer."
"This is like Orval on crack. A very heady and carbonated brew. Bit of resiny hop bitterness on the tongue as well as some in the aroma. This is doubled with the effects of medicinal phenols as well as the yeast flavors. Lots of bitterness and phenolic activity with hints of lemon, horse blanket and mineral. Touch of fruitiness gets lost as well as the malt as it attempts to add some sweetness to the brew. In the end it is quite dry."
"It is a cloudy, golden color with plenty of creamy white head. It leaves some good lace behind as well. There is some brett in the aroma with some vanilla and a lot of floral hops. The body is resreved with some soft barnyard flavors and plenty of floral and herbal bitterness. It finshes quite dry. This is a great beer for hopheads and belgian lovers alike."
"Really a very cool and unique beer. Its like an old fashioned Belgian monk got together with an American hophead brewer and they only have German hops. Farmhouse meets hophouse. Simply a great beer."
"Easily one of the hoppiest beers I've ever tasted from Belgium. Not quite my favorite BPA (that belongs to Poperings Hommelbier)"
"Pours a slightly hazy light copper with a 2 finger head that leaves sheets of lace. Aroma is a mixture of musty yeast, some toasted malt, and a boatload of spicy and earthy hops. Flavor begins with some biscuity malt that is then completely assaulted by spicy hop bitterness... a touch of grapefruit works it's way in as well. The flavor is heavily tilted to the bitter side, but it is a great beer if you're a hophead (which I am.) Mouthfeel is oily and acidic, with a light to medium body and low carbonation. All in all, a most unusual and enjoyable beer!"
"Hoppiest beer in Belgium?Pours a nice hazy orage/golden color with a huge blooming head that globs up on the side of the glass,citruisy aroma with some deep honey estures pretty appetizing.Taste starts ut dry and leafy definent hop profile but not a big fan of the heavy medicinal flavor in the finish and aftertaste all good up till then.A well made Belgian Pale but a little to medicinal for me."
"I will sit back with this one many times again and will update accordingly."
"Overall: I'm what I'd consider to be a fan of beers packing some bitterness. I like a good kick in the butt from a solid IPA. This brew, however, offered up bitterness on a entirely different level that was unappealing. The aroma and feel were good but the bitterness just was a turn-off for me."
"De Ranke send us some more."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Bottle says 6% ABV."
"Appearance: Clouded golden orange hue with a rocky foam white head very gelatinous in texture with fine Belgian lacing. Aroma: Sharp citrus hop edge with flowery hops flowing in the mix this shit is hoppy surrounded by a sweet honey malt profile. Taste: Extremely hoppy belgian ale, this is the Stone Brewing of Belgium awesome stuff earty mix of pine cone flavor hops rough edge of citrusy hop bite, soft Belgian pale malts tie this one altogether. Mouthfeel: Effervescent carbonation bubbly medium body hop resins flowing along the palate. Drinkability: Good stuff happy to taste a belgian this hoppy adds a new posibility to the flavor profile of beers great bier easily consumed."
"Drinkability was high. I kept sipping at this beer to keep the bitter taste going full on. I will have another!"
"In one sentence, I'd call it an artful rendering of hoppy flavors on a malty base with the magic of yeast and handcrafting. Very Belgian in its peculiarity."
"Poured golden yellow with minimal head. Alcoholic esters hit right away along with powerful hop aroma. Flavor is very bitter at it sort of jumps at you but is somewhat offset by light chewy malt that also appears. Little but too bitter and dry on my palate. I imagine this would be a good session beer as your palate got adjusted to it."
"This is by far one of the more enigmatic and esoteric beers I have ever tried. A hoppy belgian. Quite the interesting combonation. It poured a cloudy golden color with a white bubbly head that reduced to nothing much more than a ring around the outside. The smell was very fruity, with mellon, berry and soft fruits dominating with hints of lemon and other citrus hiding in the background. The taste was like two beers blended. It had much of the traditional spicy belgian pale ale characteristics with doughy yeasty notes mellowing it out.... then all of a sudden huge piny hop leaf would assert itself pummeling my taste buds. Very interesting beer. One to sit and ponder over."
"Light yellow orange color, slightly cloudy. It looks alot like a light apple cider. There is a little head, but it stays around, leaving a touch of lace. The smell, surprisingly enough, has a lot of spiced apple cider to it, with sweet piny hops rounding it out. The flavor is immediately hoppy, deep and piny, beggining out mellow, and then growing to sharp finish, mellowing into a distincly hoppy aftertaste. Slight citrus flavors linger behind. This is a great beer in terms of mouthfeel. It is smooth yet crisp, with a sharp hit on the back of the tongue. It is very drinkable, although expensive."
"Got the last of a keg, so I was not surprised that it poured a cloudy light cidery orange with very little carbonation. The hops are first evident in the smell, but there are numerous other aromas: tart apples, pineapples, some pine. The taste is far more understated than I expected, and beautifully balanced. The bitterness is always evident from start to finish, but the complex spiciness transforms as the taste moves from the initial apples to a finish on the back of my palate of grapefruit-like sourness. There is predictably little carbonation, and the mouthfeel is light, but not too watery."
"As a special treat, my friend Stephen brought a bottle of this special beer over during the Thanksgiving holiday. I will admit that I was already giving this beer some bonus credit for packaging - albeit not the most critical form of beer analyzation, but the presentation was really nice. It poured a thick and gracious head which hung on to the glass through the entire drink (which to me, was amazing). The color was a hazy golden yellow. This is a bitter, and as far as bitters go, it has a lot to offer. It seemed to have several bitter agents that were time released to target different areas of the tongue and mouth. There were other spices that kept you guessing on ingredients (and kept you coming back for another sip). The sensation was wonderful, and left the mouth with an amazingly perky, fruitful (as in pear) aftertaste."
"11.2 Fl oz. bottle. Best before April 2008. Golden yellow in color with a small bright white head that seems to last. The smell is grassy, citrus and sweet. Very different in taste from any other Belgian beer that I have had. My initial reaction is, a triple with more hops and a bit lighter. Sweet in the beginning, then the bitterness takes over. Nothing is overpowering, just well balanced. I really like this beer and will have to try the 750ml bottle."
" Poured a hazy golden yellow with an inch of fluffy white head. The aroma is very distinct floral hops, sweet malt, yeast and herbal notes. The flavor is malt up front with the more heady yeasty and then hop bittering to round it out. Slightly chalky yeast. Smooth body with decent carbonation, this one went down easy. Quite a good brew, an interesting balance of flavors."
"Good, wet head that fades to a fuzzy film on top of the cloudy orange body. The aroma strikes me first with something that I really don't like. My best way to describe it is orange-juice gone bad. Otherwise it's flowery and herbally. The flavor is even more herbally, which melds nicely with the hop bitterness. There's a bit of odd flavor here. It's like the difference between fresh orange juice and the orange juice stored in clear glass bottles. It's not rotten, but something light does to orange juice, make it have a similar bitter fruit flavor to what this beer has going on. Turpentine or creosote. Definite bandaids. It's got a lot going on, but there's too many things that I don't like about it."
"Tasted this after warming up with a Wittekerke, and damned if this was not nearly the same color-hazy golden orange. The head was serious though, and puffed up nicely and showed a good solid stick. Aromatics hint of sweet malt and pungent herb. The mouthfeel is medium, with good crispness. Flavors are bold and assertive with lemon zest and pink grapefruit sandwiched between green bud-very bittter-in a damn fine way I might add! The bitter is finely balanced by just enough malt to keep you coming back for more. The taste is again quite herbal with an almost menthol quality-very green tasting. The bitter flavor hammers away at the palate yet in an elegant fashion. I'll take this over many a domestic ""sticky"" hedonistic IPA any day!"
"Very hoppy and dry and yes bitter. Quite a malt presence also. Definitely not your run of the mill Belgian. I prefer a fine IPA to this, but this beer is loaded with quality"
"A Firm Favorite (i.e. I'm biased)."
"Poured from a paper-wrapped bottle at the October BA gathering, it's a nice gold with a fairly thick white head leaving lace. A hoppy Belgian beer? Well, the hops are there, but nobody's going to confuse it with a west coast IPA. Musty Belgian yeast and traces of that familiar barnyard smell mix nicely with the hops. It has a nice light refreshing feel and taste. This was a rare treat and one I hope to find again."
"Hazy golden color with a foamy, bone white head. Great lace remains on the glass. Nose features hints of earthy hops, citrus, pine and yeast. Zesty overall. The label touts this beer as ""the hoppiest of Belgium," and it certainly is the most hop-laden brew I've sampled from the vast brewing nation. Though the hops are everpresent in this beer, they're balanced, with floral and citrus characteristics accompanied by a typical Belgian yeast character and some sweet malt. Mouthfeel is creamy, yet somewhat oily on the finish, which is decidedly dry. Almost West Coast US in nature, this a great beer in its own right. Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"I tell ya, they know how to brew beer in Belgium! I finally got around to trying this at Redbones, and now I am wondering what took me so long...anyway, nice cloudy yellow when poured, no head, but a nice fruity aroma. Taste was a mix of a sweet start, finishing with a bowl of grapefurit at the end. There was some bitterness, but it's so refined...would get again, and think I could sneak this in under the session beer label...maybe. Good stuff, recommended. pat"
"Originally sampled 8 March 2003 at Pizza Port's Belgian Beer Fest. I am writing this review from my notes. This is a cloudy yellow brew w/ a nice bitter taste & very full mouthfeel. It's quite drinakable & it's a nice palate cleaner, which is quite usefull during a day of beer tasting."
"""The hoppiest beer of Belgium"" according to the bottle. I don't think so. Bottle conditioned, and a careful pour managed to leave the sediment in the bottle, resulting in a golden yellow decant. A little sweet and dense, no more than average for the style. Hops bittering seemed no more pronounced than the average Belgian golden or pale ale. Moderate yeast phenol flavors, with a slightly off finish. Overall, my experience was neither particularly good nor bad."
"A hop heavy Belgian ale! Life is good and this sure helps. The pour was perfect, massive blocky head formed over a clear, golden brew, and remained clinging in clumps to the side of my gass and floating on top. Steady streams of carbonation release strong citrus and damp straw aromas with yeast notes and some astringent phenols. Initial sip is light and slightly metalic, but then hop flavors of resinous pine and lemongrass kick in. Tastes and smells like a blend of German and British hops. Malt richness fights to make this a fuller bodied beer but loses its battle with the hops even at room temp. Some yeast inspired hints of ripe fruit and toffee float around the hugely bitter finish. Small, hand crafted batches of af a Belgian IPA. The De Rank people must have been reading my mind!"
"Average body."
"Pours a caliginous orange color, the head massive in size, and the consistency frothy with fine sheets of lace that smother the glass. The aroma plums, citrus and a bit sour or tart if you like. Winish, also slightly floral, the start is mildly sweet, the top skimpy. Finish purposeful in its acidity, the hops masterful in their spicy bite and the aftertaste long lasting and quite bitter."
"Lightly hazy golden hue, topped by a porcelian white, fluffy, cappuchino like head. Belgian lace is left. Pungently spicy and grassy dry hopped Saaz hop nose dominates the aroma. Overshadowed hints of light caramel and yeast must. Assertive, sharp, chlorophyll laced hop bitterness hits the palate in an IPA like fashion, albeit w/ continental hops. This slowly fades sufficiently to allow light white bread like sweetness and subdued pear like esters to eek into the flavor profile. Pervasive grassy hop flavor. Lightly bodied, but smoothly dextrinous and crisp in mouthfeel, not unlike a good pilsner. Finishes slightly musty, but otherwise dry, well attenuated and with lingering hop bitterness. De Ranke XX is unique, delicious and versatile. If you can't choose between assertively hopped pilsner and a Belgian pale, you can have your cake and eat it too with this brew. Delectably bitter, and not one dimensionally so."
"Slight ambient light illuminates the hazy blond color. Marvelous aroma that starts out fruity pineapple and peppery hops, then shifts gears to a pear-like fruitiness. Unique and complex hop profile is unlike any other beer. Quite resiny...concentrated, then prickly and peppery. Yeast imparts a sour-doughy breadiness. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation steady. Finishes with a dry but welcome bitterness. I WILL look for this again in the near future."
"Excellent beer, quite a herbal and floral nose, hazy lemon colour (kind of like lemon juice), very, very dry, herby, slightly spicy and bitter on the palate, i thought it was quite interesting and quite unique, and i like my beers on the drier side, a great little find."
"Hazy yellow ochre, creamy 1/4 inch head after 40 seconds or so, VERY aromatic in citrus and hop zazz...wow, this stuff is bitter, lots of hops in the middle and back of the tongue. Other notes are definitely of citrus rinds and a little sweetness in the attenuated finish. Good but not excessive carbonation. I enjoyed this beer as something different and something not as vinous (its a tad plastickly phenolic) as many Belgian styles. A little bit of a letdown in that despite its yeast and ""Old World"" hops, its a lot like a brewpub super IPA. Nice ""small batch"" brew, but not sure if it was worth $10 a bottle..."
