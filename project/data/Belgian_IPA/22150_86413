Smells and tastes of graham cracker, toasted grains, citrus hops, coriander, herbs, floral hops, caramel, biscuit, yeast and piney hops/pine cone. It seemed too grainy at first, but it grew on me as the balance was really nice and it flowed down like a session beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with average carbonation, some thickness and a slightly bitter finish with a slightly tart yeast essence. Nice above average Belgian IPA that tasted fresh on tap, but lacked the big hop accents I was hoping for.","CHickman","Aug 27, 2014"

3.75,-2.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of a farmhouse ale, but I don't think it really fits into the Belgian IPA category simply because the hops are on the lighter side and they don't impart that bitterness that I would expect from a Belgian IPA. This beer had good drinkability it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little refreshing, a little dry on the finish and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it, but I think that would be my limit and I think it makes for a nice beer to enjoy in the spring and summer. What I like the most about this beer was the funky yeast aspect, I thought it was at the right level and it's just what I expect from a good Farmhouse Ale. What I like the most about this beer was the drinkability, i liked how easy drinking it was and the fact that it was a little refreshing helped that out also. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop aspect, it was nice, but I wish the hops stuck out more and I wish there was a little more bitterness. I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Farmhouse Ales. All in all I liked this beer, but I thought the hop profile held this beer back from being as good as it could be and I think with some more hops this would be a pretty great example of a Hoppy Farmhouse Ale. This isn't my favorite of the style or my favorite beer from Stillwater, but I still think it's a solid beer in it's own right. Nice job guys, this was a tasty easy drinking beer, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","0"

Pours lightly hazy pale gold color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of of big lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, straw, light bubblegum, wheat, cracker, herbal and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and light-moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, straw, wheat, cracker, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, clove, grass, straw, herbal, wheat, cracker, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great hop/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian IPA. All around good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 12, 2014"

3.96,3.1,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light straw amber with a big, loose three finger white head that dissipates to a thick cottony film, leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of Belgian/saison yeast, Belgian spicing and nice grassy and floral hops. Flavor is a great blend of grassy hopped American IPA and Belgian saison with a spicy, saison yeast finish and bitterness. Medium bodied with active carbonation. One of the better hybrids of Belgian and American IPA styles, leaning a bit more towards the Belgian with spicing leaning more towards coriander than clove. Well made and nicely balanced. I was a bit tardy drinking this; it sat at the back of my fridge, but the hops have held up well. Fresh this may have a more even balance between the styles. Still very enjoyable and as expected from Stillwater.","LiquidAmber","Apr 02, 2014"

Some lemon peel character before finishing with biscuit malt, bread and cracker. Decent balance but it kind of falls off in the finish. Kind of watery and bland on the back end.

4.25,10.7,3.75,4.25,4.25,5,4,"Overall (4.0): As mentioned above in the tasting notes, this was a good beer, overall, with some good to great qualities, but it wasn’t the hop bomb-saison/BPA fusion I was expecting or hoping for. Still, glad to have tried it, and it’s clear from drinking this and Brian has a vision for each of his beers and exceptional skill and ability in making that vision a reality. In this case, my vision of what this beer could be may not have lined up perfectly with the brewer’s—but that isn’t to say this isn’t a perfectly good beer, because it clearly is.","fmccormi","Sep 24, 2013"

3.86,0.5,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,4,"more of a hoppy saison than a Belgian ipa, nitpicking of course. I liked this one a lot, very unconventional. the artwork is really cool too. pours a light cloudy straw color, still see through, but some sediment in suspension. over an inch of fluffy white suds on tap rising well above the brim of my pint glass. the nose is funky like some of their other saisons, smells like the saison yeast I used in my homebrew. fruity and tart, with a floral hop profile and assured bitterness. the taste agrees completely with the nose, this is a saison through and through. hoppy, but only on the back end, I expected it to be more aggressively done, and a pine complex would work well here, although all I really get is a floral character and pronounced bitterness. super light too, like the others ive had from Stillwater, elegantly malted. good carbonation and a nice light feel, plenty drinkable and a well hidden abv. another fine crafted ale from these guys, an imperial version of this would be fun...","StonedTrippin","Sep 14, 2013"

4.05,5.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Why Cant IBU? I don't know, why cant u? This beer has a nice light golden color with some trace specs of faded yellow up towards the sides. A nice bright white head of foam up top with some vigor and sticking power, a slight haze throughout the liquid, looking quite nice, retention is there. For a kinda low ABV'ed Belgian IPA, this has more of a hoppy scent than Belgian yeast influence. I get some lemon, orange, pine and earthy scents coming out instead of bready yeasty malt. The musk kinda jumps out. Pretty smelling IMO, but I do get some perfume scents with warming. A very straight forward ale here, I get some of the Belgian bready yeast up front with some hop taste. Not your normal Belgian IPA, I am not entirely sure if this is classified right. Some pineapple notes come through with the warming. Not getting a stitch of the 6% alcohol, which is quite low, but there is a whole lot of flavor. Feel is between light and medium with a nice felt carb going for it. Not my favorite beer, or IPA, or Belgian IPA, whatever it is, but it works for me for a go. I could drink alot of this, but I would probably get bored by the 3rd glass","BARFLYB","Nov 30, 2012"

While still enjoyable, I thought the draft version really paled in comparison to the cask version sampled previously. Probably would rate the regular draft version a straight 4... still good, but no where near as excellent as the cask version.","John_M","0"
