"Overall, this definitely comes across more as a pale ale or IPA than a Belgian-style ale, but it is delicious and I would definitely buy it again."
"This beer is ok, but almost too much. Bitter on the front and the end. Heavy and  biting mouthfeel."
"Overall this was an interesting beer. Tasty, drinkable and it hides the alcohol quite well. I did pick up some metalic taste in the finish but the friend who shared this with me did not."

"Pours a hazed orange tinged lighter golden with a nice looking half finger  almost creamy-like head.Citrus fruits in the nose with a tinge of spiced Belgian yeast although not real big,very citrusy.Mild yeasty notes on the palate with a big burst of the fresh citrus and tropical fruity hops,light earth in the finish.A refreshing beer that doesn't seem to show it's ""size",very drinkable."

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time."
"Funky spicy, citrusy, earthy. Interesting and complex aroma. Unfortunately, it's probably the most phenolic /band aid beers I've tried. Unsure of age, but it's got a bitter finish."

"O: I almost thought I wouldn't rate this given the fact I wasn't getting the best of it, but wanted to record my thoughts should I get another chance. Even with age, it wasn't that bad, so if the base that remains can be replaced with fresh hops scents and flavors, I could see this being quite enjoyable."

"Only second time having this beer.  I had it below average prior, but moved it up to average."

""

"Crystal-clear amber body; short white head. Terrific, strong aroma of flowers, limes, lemons, and naval stores. The beer's flavor is subtler than the smell portends. It's more savory than fruity, with a subdued hoppy waft followed up by a cozy afterthought of caramel. The feel is a little pricklier than I was hoping for, but some might call it bright. All in all, pretty darned OK."
"Cheers!!"

"O- I had this on tap at the CBC brewpub, yet I agree with fellow BA member StonedTrippin that this is better from the bottle. If you enjoy this style and can score it fresh (after all, the bottled on date is coded in yellow ink on the shoulder of the bottle), then get yourself 1, 2, 3 bottles...if not a case because this stands to be my favorite in the category...trumpeting Stone's Cali Belgique, Flying Dog's Raging Bitch and flirts with overcoming Lagunitas' A Little Sumpin' Wild. 5.0"
"O - Nice blend of styles and enjoyable as it warms."
""

"Very interesting beer. I sort of like the name, The Audacity of Hops... To me, that meant that move over Hops, even though I am a DIPA, you are going to taste my Belgium style!"

"O: I’ll take a hop bomb any day, but my favorite beers in the world are the ones that can take extreme flavors and achieve balance. This beer does that, blending thick, hoppy DIPA flavors with a flowery, estery Belgian yeast character in satisfying unison. To be honest, I’d rather have less American IPA and more Belgian pale, but that’s just my style preference; for what this is – a Belgian DOUBLE IPA – you can’t really ask for much more. Cheers!"

"O: What a complex, tasty beer. It truly combines Belgian tradition with a US influence"
"edit: the bottled version of this, when fresh, is even better than on tap. i get a way more tropical fruit hopping, like fresh pineapple juice even more than the tap. it honestly reminds me of abner from hill farmstead as far as the hop profile, which is about as high a compliment as an ipa can receive from me. its less west coasty, and more refined than we usually associate with that. amazingly easy drinking for its size, and just a beautiful beer all around. top quality belgian ipa, the only one i can think of right now that i could drink every day and not lose enthusiasm for. cambridge is awesome."
""
""
""
""
"O - Don't be turned away by the fact that this beer is technically brewed in a Belgian style. You will swear it's an all-American IPA or DIPA. Hop lovers will love it. Delicious brew!"
""
"The flavor profile on this Belgian IPA really saved it for me. I was not really excited until I took my second or third sip; then I was hooked. The sweet phenolic flavors mix well with the hop profile presented. Seek this one out! Maybe try to find a fresher bottle than I did though."

"Awesome job CBC!!!"

"This falls right in my wheelhouse with the marriage of IPA and Belgian flavors. I thought it was damn good. I’d have to say that Audacity is to Belgian/white IPAs what Stone SSR is to black IPAs for me. It pushes out the limits of what I thought the style could hold and sets a high mark for others to beat."
"O. A beautiful double IPA. A mild bit too sweat, but good overall."

"Real nice take on a Belgian IPA and a large hop presence. Enjoyed my first CBC brew."
"Were it not an obvious reference to a book title, I'd say this was a badass name for a beer. Not that it's bad 'cause it's a reference, it's just not as awesome as it could have been with the innate originality. Regardless, this stuff pours a hazy sunshine amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises Belgian yeast, pine sap, light clove, a pinch of black pepper, melon rind, and a hint of sourdough. The taste brings in more of the same, the yeast and the now slightly-earthier pine jockeying for position, occasionally all-out clashing. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a solid-enough BIPA, but the yeast and the hops don't fully mesh for me. It's not bad by any stretch, but not something I'm gonna be picking up again any time soon."
""

""

"Great with food. Goat cheese, salad, and some peppery sausage went great with this one..well worth a try...hmm when's the next time I can get to Danbury?"
"Overall, quite good. A nice Belgian IPA but not one of the best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer. Definitely worth a try and a good representation of the style. Just don't expect to overwhelmed with hops because you won't be."

"Flavor is more IPA than Belgian. Strong hop kick starts things off with some nice citrus notes. Some grapefruit and some slight piney notes round out the hops. The nice piney notes go well with the Belgian notes of phenols and some slight spice. This is definitely a DIPA with some slight Belgian notes in my book. It is pretty delicious though. Resinous and nicely hopped up. There is a slight boozy note to it and some good fruit sweetness in the middle of the brew that is rounded out again by some good hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisp and with a nice dry finish. Overall this brew was a great surprise. It’s nice and hoppy like a DIPA but it has slight Belgian yeast notes and spices. Well crafted."
"Excellent Belgian IPA--easily one of my favorites, in fact."

"Bomber poured into tulip. Pours hazy orange with a two finger white head. Smell is tropical fruits, Belgian yeast, pine resin, some green apple. Taste is very fruity, very piney, with tons of Belgian yeast, some banana, some floral spices, slightly dry, amazing balance between the styles, maybe the best I've had. If you're in the area, make sure to try this amazing Belgian IPA. It's got a huge hop profile with a ton of Belgian taste."

"Yes. This is a Belgian ipa. That much seems certain. It strikes me as somewhat boozy really. There is a definite burn on it and it detracts from the overall experience. If it were toned down a good bit then the hops and Belgian side of things would probably be able to shine better."
"22 oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brownish orange color with a half inch of head. The aroma is dank hops, mango, orange peel, yeast and some sourness. The taste is dank hops and mango along with those orange peel and yeast flavors you expect in a Belgian. A bit funky and bitter. Some floral hop notes as well. Hints of grapefruit at the finish. This is a Belgian IPA with a good amount of hop flavor. Mixes both qualities of a Belgian and an IPA very well. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style. I didn't know what style of beer this was until afterwards. I basically saw the name with the hop on the label and grabbed it, but I have to say that I am presently surprised by this one. Overall, good version of the style."

"O-a nice variation on a Belgian IPA, good flavors"
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Nice hue, decent (although short-lived) head, and some adequate lacing. Nose is a very full, great combination of pine resin, with orange, and a syrupy sweetness. Unfortunately, some of the complexities in the nose, do not present in the flavor. Dry and bitter....not much else. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Overall - Would definitely recommend. Great fusion of styles. Stellar brew that bridges the gap between my two favorite styles."

"Overall, this is right up there with the best IPAs or DIPAs I've had. It's got good flavor, is easy to sip, and has a nice kick to it...and the alcohol lets you know it's a beer."
""
"Overall, this is good beer, and hopheads should certainly seek out a bottle, as the hops are potent and varied, showcasing a powerful array of hoppy goodness. However, the Belgian part of the beer is largely lost because of the potency of the hops, and seems imbalanced because of it. Had this simply been labeled a “Double India Pale Ale,” rather than a “Belgian Style Double India Pale Ale,” there wouldn’t have been such a problem; as it is, the fruity, spicy bananas and cloves seem almost an afterthought. This is not to say that the beer is bad—in fact, it’s very delicious, though likely far too hoppy for the novice—just that it seems mislabeled."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a golden yellow color with a white head on top. The retention of the is thin but holds up well. The lacing is sticky, leaving some foam on the glass. The smell of the beer is floral, some fruity citrus notes. The taste is piney, some lemony citrus in there as well with a resin-like finish. There is a very subtle breadiness in there also. The mouthfeel has a good amount of carbonation with a lighter body. Overall this beer is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well done for the style. It doesn't hit you too hard with the hops or yeast."
""
""
"Pours a nice, transparent yellow-gold. Medium cream-colored head. Mix of small and big bubbles. Nice enough. The aroma is an interesting mix of flavors. There's a lot of hops. Quite juicy. Big pineapple and bright citrus with a twist of a floral, spicy noble hop aroma. That part is very nice. Belgian esters and simple malt sweetness round things out. The hops are so nice that I can almost overlook that the flavors don't quite mesh. There's also a bit of booze and a touch of acetone, but I'm still loving the hops. The taste has more grassy and spicy hop flavor and less tropical fruit and citrus. It's not quite as gentle as I was hoping. Fair bit of pepper. A touch more booze. I hate to say it, but I get the feeling that the hop loveliness is hiding a not so great Belgian-style base. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, and there's a definite booziness right at the start of the finish. I like this beer, but I think I'd love it with a cleaner yeast. If they just brewed it as a standard DIPA, I'd probably be happier. That said, the hops are so bright and flavorful that it's easy to see past the flaws."
""
"Where the beer is a justified Belgian-inspired American imperial IPA, it's Belgian character is suppressed and it's Pacific Northwest hop attributes are elevated to the point where if the label hadn't told me that this was a Belgian-type of beer, then I may have missed it and chocked the fruit and spice up to the hops alone."
""
"Clear, dark yellow with a fizzy greyish head that fades fast. If I didn't know better this could be Colt 45 by appearance alone. Nice floral hops and Belgian spice in the nose. This beer tastes much better than it looks, big resinous hops and dry spicy Belgian yeast in perfect harmony. Full bodied with seltzery carbonation. One of the better ""Belgian"" IPAs that I've had. Well balanced between the hop bitterness and spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a golden hue. There is a layer of off white head. The smell is hoppy, but there is a strong Belgian spice note. The taste has a nice balance between sweet, spice, and hops. There is a fruity note, the finish is bitter. Lots of Belgian spice here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed apricot hue with a creamy two finger head and similar lacing here and there,the smell is pine,citrus,lemon sherbet,candy and as it warms liquorice and aniseed,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated maybe a little too much and has tastes of pine citrus infused hops,peaches,nectarines,lychee,candy,the lightest hit of toffee malts and finished with a citrus bitterness and overall its nice and hides its ABV very well as i dont get much of the alcohol on smell or taste just wish the mouthfeel had abit less carbonation apart from that yeah id buy it again cheers."
"A delicious beer. A nice balance of IPA and Belgian yeast that works well."
""

"A clear copper-amber color with a fair off-white head and tenacious lacing. The aroma offers sweet pine-citrus hops with a touch of piss and vinegar. The lemon edges blend with some skunky caramel. Very nice although I don't detect much of the usual Belgian ideas. The flavor brings a nice blend of caramel-pine and lemon along with a modest clove yeast that just hints at the Belgian theme. This stuff is pretty yeasty with a slightly funky hop. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The feel is gentle but with a pleasant frothy quality. Although it did not provide the classic Belgian IPA flavors it is none-the-less a very enjoyable concoction. Very much recommended."

"O - Seek this beer out. Really excellent example of a Belgian Double IPA. The 8% is totally lost until the very end (as it's warmed)."
""
""
"O - This gets a 3.5 because of the age. I can detect some really nice notes in here but they have faded too much. Not the beers fault but I will try and track down a fresher bottle to revise my rating. Would recommend others do the same. I have a feeling this is an overlooked good BIPA."
""
"Poured a 2"" custard head of decent lifespan. The body is a hazy light burnt orange color. It smells very strongly of piney and citrusy hops. The taste blows me away with hops just like the smell as well as a nice carmamelly aftertaste. Quite rich and with a long finish. Delightful beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am little disappointed with this beer, it lauded itself as having a big Double IPA hop flavor with a Belgian flair, but it seems to be quite lacking in the hoppy smell and over powering bite that I expected in a Double IPA. The beer is hoppy, just not as much as I expected. It’s not a terrible beer, but it is nothing special in my book, with an overall feel of underwhelming."
"(originally reviewed: 12-20-2011 - batch 1, freshly bottled, purchased at CBS)"
""
""
"O: A great-tasting beer, that doesn't try to do too much. Easy-going, light and fluffy, but with some great flavors and interesting feel, I would recommend it to those seeking a summertime DIPA. Nice effort, and good product."
""
""
"O: Good, not as much Belgian character as I expected."
""
"O: smells great, looks good, and very nice and complex flavor profile. a well done beer that is sure to please"
"O: Initial impression is not great. Over time this beer gets better, but -- come on. It's not a bad brew to begin with. I'd like some more hop flavor -- you start to get it with time. More than any other beer this one gets better as it warms."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really great Belgian IPA with a good hop profile and a good amount of flavor from the Belgian yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a great beer. The combination of hop and Belgian yeast flavors are very complimentary and quite tasty. Add to that a great feel and you have a very worthwhile beer!"
""
""
"Overall: Much more DIPA than Belgian IPA. It's a tasty pour though. Lots of great hops flavor...not overpowering and quite drinkable."
"T: This is pretty delicious. I was a little worried about the hoppiness fading because this bottle is dated December 2011, but it seems to be intact still. Opens with a lot of pine and citrusy hops, grapefruit pith, a touch of belgian yeast and crushed black pepper. Finish is dry and pretty bitter, but leaves you wanting a lot more. The alcohol is really, really well hidden. Super drinkable and super delicious. Wish we could get this in California."
""
"Overall, enjoyed this one, and I felt like it was a fun take on an IPA. I tend to think it falls more into the characteristics of a DIPA rather than a Belgian, but it's light and easy to drink, and very tasty."

"CBC is a great place to go in Cambridge MA. heads up to all."
"This was a well done take on a Belgian IPA, with a complex yet balanced profile that kept this smooth and flavorful on the palate despite the occasional assertiveness of the hops. Watch out for this, it's dangerously drinkable for the size."
"O: I like this one. A little different but very tasty."
""
""
"Tasty, tasty brew. With the low bitterness and and dry character, the beer is seriously drinkable as well. In comparison to the original draught version for the Symposium though, this bottled version is a bit subdued in the hop department."
""
""
"There seem to be two camps of Belgian IPAs - the traditional ones with intense swampy/herbal characteristics (De Ranke Bitter) and the more American ones with a mix of herbal and citrus hops (Audacity of Hops). I prefer that later."
"Appearance is a nice golden tone with two fingers of bright white head. Its` nose contains citrus hops, pine and flora. Taking a sip confirmed my suspicions that this is a fine beer, sweet from orange and other citrus components with more hops and pine. Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation level and a lingering, pleasant bitterness to the finish. For those who appreciate a nice BIPA, be sure to pick this one up, it does not disappoint."
""
""
"O- Not bad, not amazing. Tone the phenols down a bit and it would be much closer to an A rating. Bitterness was balanced, buy they did have a come-and-go harshness to them at times, tgif I think the alcoholic character added to this."
"O: Goes down easy, VERY tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, good representation of style. This is a belgian IPA that I could sit with for a night!"
"The Audacity of Hops pours a hazy, but not opaque light orange, with plentiful tangerine to goldenrod highlights. The off white head approaches, but maybe doesn't reach two fingers in height. Head retention is just OK, but there's a decent amount of lacing coated onto the side of the glass. The nose is a little on the weak side, but there are definitely clove and tropical fruit notes there to appreciate. The flavor profile steps things up big time though. The front end has some candied sugar sweetness, before an aggressive charge of bitterness come through. The back half is where things get interesting though, as phenols, esters, and hops come together to bring wave after wave of flavor coming through. Notes of bubble gum, tropical fruit, light citrus, clove, and a bit of earthy herbs all come through in time. No one sip is exactly like the last, but they're all delicious. The body is nicely dialed in, not desert dry, but tending towards the dry side of the spectrum. The carbonation however, is just a little bit dull. I'm thrilled that CBC is bottling some of their beers now, and only wish I lived in MA so I could have a glass of Audacity of Hops (or any of their other beers) at home more often."
"Poured into a Mayflower nonic, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head lasts and lasts, with thick coating lace. Aroma is spicy hops and candi sugar. Taste starts with a light pale sweetness, hits with spicy hops in the middle, then floral bitterness to close, with a shot of warmth. Mouthfeel is smooooth, and drinkability is way easy. An example of hops working hand in hand with flavors in a brew, instead of just bashing around with the bitter club. Audacity of hops, indeed."
"O: Audacious, absolutely. Brilliant? Borderline. After eating at CBC yesterday after a 5 mile road race, I felt compelled to review one of their beers today. This is powerful, potent, and worth your time."
""
"D - I'm not sure I would have used this name for a Belgian IPA, but in any case it's not as hop-forward as I was expecting. Still, for the style it's pretty well done and largely enjoyable."
"I'm very fond of west coast IPAs but I really like this beer over all."
""
"Beer is light in body and sweet on the front with a dryish and mildly bitter finish. The center of the palate is earthy with hops and a little sulfur and mild spiciness from the yeast. Pretty good, I'd have it again."
""
"The feel of this beer is bitter but medium bodied with some mellow feel. It seems to be just the beer for kicking back and relaxing. This beer just seems to soothe the sense."
""
"Bit it's an interesting one. Te Belgian yeast isn't that noticeable."
"Notes: Might benefit from lowering the bitterness just a tad and beefing up the body just a hair. Minor complaints though, it's still a good beer."
"This is definitely a solid IPA but perhaps not worth what I paid for out of the bottle. I'm sure at the brewery it's great."
"Pours a fairly-clear light golden color with a thin white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Some spotty lacing and a thin collar throughout. The nose carries some pepper and a bit of Belgian yeast atop a bit of floral hops. Slight earthiness in the background. Flavor is hoppy with some yeast character in the background. A general earthiness pervades. Medium body with crisp carbonation and a moderately-dry finish. Some bitterness throughout. Pretty good."
"This is an interesting brew, and I don't really know what to make of it. I taste a lot of distinct flavors, and when they combine, I get a strange nutty flavor. I suspect that most others won't experience this. Overall, this brew will intrigue you and keep you guessing."
"O: Overall a solid double Ipa with a Belgian twist , Very drinkable and one I would have again.."
"Poured in my Duvel tulip from a bomber. Dark golden color with average head after a fairly hard pour. Smell was very piney from hops. Taste was dry and piney, not much of the citrus that other IPA's may have. Very refreshing and tasty; light in a way despite the alcohol. Mouthfeel was great, a very enjoyable IPA that I could, and would drink any time."
""
"Definitely A for effort, and I would definitely get this one again."
""
"O - Nice and light for a Belgian."
""
"O- I found this beer to be alright, but not really something I would seek out again. Considering Belgian IPA's aren't really my thing I'm not surprised. This one seems fairly well balanced, but I would want more hop flavors shining through from anything with ""double IPA"" in the name."
""
""
"I would definately have this again. I think it's much more IIPA than Belgian IPA, but that's OK by me."
"Well done!!"
"O - Overall, I'm enjoying this beer. Not much of a Belgian hop character...a bit of estery and spicy aspects, but really subdued. 8% alcohol is really not noticeable...goes down smooth and easy. Intense juicy grapefruit character will likely please some and turn off others, but I like it. Worth giving a try for sure."
"A very nicely balanced IPA. Great malt start and while the bittering hop presence is huge, it doesn't overwhelm. The body is rich but the carbonation is also high. The swallow is a mixture of bitterness and earthy yeastiness. The aftertaste is short-lived given the flavor. Less ""Belgian"" in taste than American."
"Clear gold/orange colour with a soapy eggshell cap. Good head retention with some spotty lacing. Lots of citrusy hops in the aroma, mostly grapefruit with elements of flesh and pith, quite floral. Malt notes were mild and there was some yeasty fruitiness, along with a soft spicy character. Solid bitterness that lingered long into the finish. More citrus, grapefruit and an edge of lemon zest, just enough malt presence to keep the hops from being overpowering. Spicy character from the yeast and mild alcohol flavour/warmth. Medium bodied with smooth carbonation, some dryness, nice texture overall. Really well constructed and hits the right notes for a Belgian (D)IPA. Recommended."
""
"O: While I often dislike the candi sweetness of many Belgian styles (none of which is present here), I think I really prefer a Belgian IIPA to a traditional DIPA, as it seems to knock the syrupy sweetness, which I dislike, out of the equation. Maybe that's just the CBC's interpretation of the style, but I'd put this just in the IIPA/DIPA category, and in that case, it's among the best I've had. This is fantastic beer--audacious, indeed--providing that wonderful, fresh hop aroma and taste without the excessive bitterness or syrupy taste of so many others. My heart sunk when I realized it was after 11pm at the brewpub last night, and so I couldn't pick up another bomber to take home."
""
"Overall, this is one tart and acidic brew, but very hop-tastic!"
""
""
""
"Overall very impressed with this beer. The nose was a perfect balance of Belgian yeast, malts, and American and Euro hops. The flavor comes on a bit stronger and finishes a bit astringent, but otherwise balanced well and nice hop characteristics. A very drinkable and well balanced beer. They did well on the hops, didn't go crazy overboard like most American style Belgian IPAs that drives me crazy. If you overdo the hops (like Raging Bitch) you don't get any of the Belgian, and it's not even really a Belgian style IPA IMO, just an American IPA with a different yeast that you can't even tell the difference. Anyways, I'm rambling again, thanks for a very well done BIPA."
"O - I love this style when done right, and this is a great example. Definitely on the hoppy and bitter side, but this combines well with the subtle Belgian character."
"It's a bit different from many ""belgian-styled"" IPAs as most are not as over-powered by hops. the belgian yeast is definitely detectable, as is a bit of malt, for an interesting, and tasty beer."
""
"It tastes as I expected from the nose, but the yeast comes through more. Hoppy hoppy, all grapefruit and bitter citrus pith. No fruity sweetness to the hops at all. The yeast comes through spicy and warm. I enjoy. A touch of a tiny, itty bitty, ""grape candy""effervescence dancing in the back ground. Lik-m-aid style, mingled with champagne. Look for it. Trust me. You'll be like: ""wtf?"""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a really good beer. I'm just not sure it's really a Belgian IPA. It seems more in line with the characteristics of a nice DIPA. The taste is better than the nose at showcasing the Belgian characteristics but both are still really good. So high marks for a really good beer with a half point off overall for not really falling into the style."
"This beer is mostly an IPA with some Belgian notes mixed in. It's very nicely done. Other Belgian IPA's I've had are more a spicy Belgian beer with a touch of hops. Audacity is more balanced and easy to drink."

"O: Very interesting Belgian IPA. It's about 90% an american DIPA to be honest. If someone had handed me a glass of it at random, I probably never would have guessed it was anything but a normal DIPA. Doesn't mean it's bad, in fact it's quite good. It's just a very americanized version of the style."
"O: very good IPA, would highly recommend."
"Pours a slightly hazy deep straw yellow color with a decent sized head that slowly recedes and leaves marginal lace. Wow this is hoppy! Huge amounts of pine and citrus waft into the air long before I get my nostrils over the top of the glass. Slightly spicy with a hint of green onions and just a touch of yeasty esters. Taste is resinous, pine, citrus, spicy, woody hops with barely enough bready malt to call this anything other than fresh squeezed hop juice. Belgian yeast adds a hint of phenols and a touch of pepper to round out the flavor. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly, prickly, resinous mouthfeel. Finally a Belgian IPA where the yeast funk doesn't hide the hop funk on my palette. Very nicely done."

"Overall, an excellent IPA with just an insane amount of bitterness. The Belgian yeast was a non factor for me. Just a really nice, bitter IPA."
"O/D-Overall, this is a kick-ass beer. American IPA/DIPAs I find to be far superior than their Belgian counterparts. However, this beer trounces many of the American DIPAs I have tried. Super fresh and super tasty. Seek it out. Gotta try more CBC."
"overall i'm incredibly impressed here, maybe my favorite beer to date from CBC."

"Overall stood beer for what it is - hops, hops, hops and hops with a Belgian yeast. I could probably enjoy it more with a lower ABV."
"O - A wonderful Belgian DIPA that I enjoyed very much so. A nice way to end a wonderful trip on the East Coast. I hope to get back to CBC to try some of their other offerings."
"I'll admit I let this bottle sit a little longer than I should have. It still retains it's Belgian characteristics and yeast profile. Being a one off I would have liked to have it on draft as well. Nice head retention/Belgian lacing. Cloudy body with a spiciness that lingers. Not that hoppy, hints of earthiness(?) (not that it needs to be for this style), but once again it may have been hoppier while fresh. Not much rye character but a little dry in the finish. If you still have a bottle than I suggest you drink it ASAP. IPA's do not age well. I look forward to the CBC this April in Chicago and what it has to offer!"
"Thanks, jleblanc, for the opportunity"
"Overall I am very glad I got to try this one, it was truly one of a kind and one of the most bitter IPA's I have had in recent memory. Would love to do this one again."
"Tried this on tap at The Armsby Abbey at the meet the brewer night. Poured a nice golden color with a largish head which dissipated and left a nice lacing on the glass. Lots of good hoppy aromas, very strong. At first all I could taste was the hops and was really questioning the Belgian IPA classification. As I continued more Belgian yeast characteristics emerged. The drinkability is okay, at 8.5% I really only wanted one. I would love to see this brewed again and bottled."
"Drinkability: Certainly a beer for the hopheads out there. It's about as caustic and bitter as I can stand without having to tap out on the mat. Though, having said that, I was happy and relieved this was available in a sensible twelve ounce format, as finishing anything bigger might prove to be a daunting task. Even with the lone twelve ounces, it might be best to share this with a friend. Or as dear Samwise Gamgee might say, ""Share the load."""
"Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a clear yellow with a white head. Aroma of citrus hops and caramel malt. Flavor of sweet melon, citrus, with a bitter hops finish. Hmm, I thought this was just a regular IPA when I had it, although now I can see how there were some Belgiany notes in there too. Pretty decent."
"bold american hopping is nice, although seems to blunt out the belgian yeast character more than should be for it to still be classified as a ""belgian ipa""."
"Really liked it, too bad it isn't available."
"Too much of a messy potluck for me to really enjoy. Thin enough to quickly put down that I can see it working on some levels, but really not my idea of good stone soup."
"D - A nicely balanced, fruity and drinkable IPA. The belgian character is not overly strong, as any spice and fruit notes from the yeast blend with similar characteristics form the hops. The hop character is excellent, with a strong aroma and flavor as well as smooth, balanced bitterness. Overall a very nice beer, too bad I can't get any more."
"D) A great IPA... the weird funkiness in the aftertaste might deter me after a pint or two."
"Glad to have the opportunity to try this collaborative brew. Hazed yellow in a nice shapely glass, big foamy and very thick and dense head. Rings all the way down the glass with each sip. Smell is just out of control hops. Really smells like when you go to the homebrew store and stick your nose in a pouch of hops. Taste is much the same, totally hoppy, but somehow balanced by a nice caramel malt and a nice fruity Belgian yeast presence. It is almost too hoppy. I can't believe I'm saying that as a lover of all big flavors but it almost tastes more like a hop pellet than the desirable flavors imparted by hops. Still, it's unique and I dig it. Smooth on the palate and really very drinkable. Wish this would be around for longer. A great beer for a great occasion."
"Had this one on tap at Union Brewhouse- quite a treat. Served in a thin tulip glass. Pale yellow color but almost had a neon hue to it, with a huge white head. The barkeeps were having trouble keeping the head in check when pouring it. Smells were dominated by the hops. Some light citrus and minty hop aromas. Taste was the same, at first. Then the belgian yeasty flavors come through. Some light spiciness and pepper come through. Very interesting. Drying mouthfeel but the hops come through again at the end for a bit of bitterness. Good beer, very original."
"On tap at Deep Ellum, Allston this past weekend. Served in a Unibroue glass. Huge white head. Maize color body. Not quite opaque, but not quite clear body. Can smell the hops right up front. Interesting flavor. Hops dominate the mouth, but there is that subtle bit of Belgian sweetness that appears in there to tone down the hops just a tad so I can enjoy it. Very smooth finish. Served in small portions, I could drink a couple of these. But for a hop head, it could be an all night affair. I would consider this more of a Belgian IPA than the way it was described on the menu (to paraphrase) as a Belgian style hoppy tripel. Another high quality creation from CBC though."
"Not quite a sipper but lots of power. Anyone's political leanings aside...damn, this is good."
"What a tasty and interesting concoction. Like nothing I've had to date. This beer flips the Belgian IPA mutant-style onto its ass and brings us an ultra-hoppy IPA with the Belgian characteristics taking the back seat. The fruity Belgian yeast is there in the finish but a big simcoe-heavy, West Coast hop aroma and flavors dominate, staying on the palate until your next sip. Lots of pine in the taste as well. The 8.5% keeps me from drinking this all night. A must try for hopheads."
"I could drink this beer all night. The only complaint is that the Belgian characters are just whitewashed by the huge, and I mean huge amount of hops!"
"Hoppy, but balanced well. Crisp and drinkable. Like I said, this is what a Belgian IPA should be."
