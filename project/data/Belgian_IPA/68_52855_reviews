"A very underrated beer. Probably the best Belgian style Imperial IPA i've drunk so far in my life."
""
""
""
""
"Nose is unremarkable and slightly malty.  Has a great, fairly balanced bitter hop taste.  Finish is nice and clean; a pleasant surprise."

"O: I'm generally not big on Belgian style beers, but this one is pretty crisp and refreshing. I might not go out of my way to grab it, but I wouldn't complain if it's put in front of me."
""
""
"Clear copper pour with off-white foam. Aroma of yeast, malt and some citrus. Hop bitter up front, with a mellow lingering bitter, but pretty clean finish. Not the best of this style, but entirely enjoyable."
"Best beer hands down... Awesome name too"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter but not terrible. These sneak up on you if you drink more than 3. Don't let your girlfriend drink these, it's called raging bitch for a reason."
"Overall - WEll balance and tasty but slightly pedestrian the mouth feel is the weakest link but this beer is by no means a bad beer just a bit of a let down given the hype."
"Fruity! Lots of grape fruit"
""
""
"O: Strong Belgian IPA, probably best described as a DIPA. Very enjoyable. Will get again."
""
"I love this beer, one of the best imperial IPAs you can find on the east coast, let alone Baltimore.  Absolutely delicious and definitely worth a try. On tap in the Baltimore/Washington area is best but from bottles delicious nonetheless.  definitely worth a try."
"Light amber 4 finger head lots of lacing"
""
""
""
""
""
"Good taste with great tasting hops.  I was pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
"A curious IPA flavor , unfortunately I am not much given to beers IPA"
""
""
"Too heavy, too thick, too Belgiany"
""
"Great ABV and just a great heavy IPA.  Very citrusy and hard to put down once you get going.  I made the mistake of downing six of these in a few hours and felt it all day the next day.  No hang over though."
""
""
"Sweet and bready up front, with some resiny pine notes on the finish.  Lively carbonation, not that bitter."
""
""
"I drink ALOT of this beer, I have noticed that the taste varies quite a bit depending on the batch.  Alcohol level is high, so go easy...but overall one of my top 10 favorites"
"Overall good good IPA and it is ok"
""
""
"Big thumbs up for this tasty treat.  Enjoyed the unique and very different passionfruit and mango flavors punching through the middle.  Nice balanced finish too.  A yummy gulper this one.  And very good value at the checkout!  Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty much an average IPA. Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
"This is a hoppy beast. No much else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great taste for this style of beer.  Very easy drinking."
""
""
"Being a hop head, I like the bitterness. The flavors are a bit muddled, no distinct grapefruit or pine. The alcohol makes up for this."
""
""
""
""
"Different batch proved this to be a much better beer then previously experienced."
"I have mixed feelings about this one. It started so promising. It poured a beautiful combination of light copper, amber and dark golden. A modest head dissipates into a thin lace that retains throughout. The aroma was my favorite aspect. It smelled of malts, sugar and tropical fruits. I was excited to taste this one, however, the aroma and taste did not really correspond. Althought there is a slight bready, fruity and malty backbone, the intense hops finish is overpowering. The bitterness does not seem to render this a very balanced drink. The feel is good however; a stinging carbonation, medium body. This is a drinkable beer that I would not mind having again, but overall not my favorite."

"O: [4.00] This is a solid IPA.  It doesn't try to kill you with bitterness - but still highlights nice hop flavor with a good balance of malts.  The beer looks nice in the glass.  All around a really solid IPA.  Will drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Very dry finish. Not bad but needs food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a marketing gimmick."
""
""
""
"Nice relatively light ipa..with a mild aftertaste..love it"
"This certainly tastes and smells like a Belgian beer. I really enjoyed it as it adds a nice layer of bitter on top of what would be a nice Belgian style ale. I would get this again."
"First time trying this beer.. I think it's really good. Very mild ipa.. A great mix of beer styles! Great head, nice smooth mouth feel, very well made beer.."
""
"05/22/13 At Rattle N Hum, NYC, on tap.Listed as an imperial, I should have known what was in store. As an 'unhoppy' guy, this should have been an aggressive assault on the ol' taste buds, but it wasn't. Assertive, sure, but it actually had enough 'manners' to almost (& I emphasize the 'almost') assuage my abject aversion to the ""happy in hoppy"" philosophy. This is an extremely tasty treat, but I must admit the 4 oz taste I had, was more than enough. God Bless Us One and All."

"A bitter one, but she's so good. I may get my pleasure from a variety of beers, but I go  home to her. Pours a copper/golden color. Bitter and hoppy flavor with a bit of tang. Pleasant aroma. Alcohol content is up there, but not high as to overpower the flavor. Delicious and soothing."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A solid beer that is hoppy and slightly grapefruity.  Over all over good."

"O: This is certainly not for everyone,  but I like it a lot. It's a fun beer to drink, and one of the few IPA's on the market that is bold enough in my opinion to hold up to the colder months here in New England. The first time I had it I wasn't a huge fan, but is has grown on me."

"Orange and cloudy.. A/T floral hops, Yeast, woody earthiness, banana and clove.. Very yeasty and astringent.. Not great the taste seems harsh with netiher style really coming out..maybe I'm just not a fan of this style.. Rather have just a ipa or Belgian ale not mixed together."
""
""
"I love IPA's and I love Belgian style beers when you combine the two they are awesome. This beer fell really short on the Belgian side. I didn't really detect any of the clove or fruity esters you get from a Belgian beer. The IPA side was great. Hop aroma and flavor were on the citrus side with a nice hop bite at the end. I would rate this beer a little higher if the Belgian side came out a little stronger."

"A hint of citrus smell but this one packs a punch with the bitterness. A bit too strong of a taste for it to be an everyday beer."
""
""
""
""
"Good Beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Whoa momma!  It packs a punch. Smells good but this b*tch will bite.  You can really taste the alcohol and she's a bitter one!"
""
""
"My brother in law bought a six pack of this and brought it to the hospital following the birth of my daughter. Two months later there are a couple of them still sitting in my fridge. That about sums up my feelings towards this beer."
"One of the best IPAs I have had. Interesting flavor and a LOT of hops!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An enjoyable and well-made version of the style, the yeast and the hops not colliding, but rather working on their own, towards the common good, a pleasurable whole.  Worth seeking out if you're into this sort of thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not love this. No subtlety to the flavor and you can really taste the high ABV. I do, however, love Flying Dog's labeling and general attitude towards the world, so I'll continue buying their beer, just not the Raging Bitch."
"Awesome pull-up a stool and sip beer. Goes great with a bar meal or if you'd like a taster beer to get yourself buzzed at happy hour."

"Pours really nice reddish brown with a 1.5 inch white head. Minimal hop smell. Can really smell the malts. Has a nice sweet malty flavor with a kick of hops. I like it. Will need to try some other Belgian IPAs."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into glasses and shared with friends.  Its a nice clear amber/orange with a finger or so of white head and good lacing.  Aroma is of dried fruit, caramel, molasses...most of the elements you expect in a big Belgian.  Taste displays the same dried fruit character but with some herbal spiciness and substantial but not overwhelming bitterness.  Nice mouthfeel.  Overall, an interesting beer.  This was my first Belgian IPA and I did enjoy it, but it's not a style I'll seek out.  The Ralph Steadman graphics and quote on the bottle were nice conversation pieces."
"Interesting beer."
""
""
"Really nice Belgian style IPA.  Smooth, complex, but still a hearty IPA.  Another winner from Flying Dog, Good stuff."

"ok, not bad. Color and appearance great, head ok. Flavor is good, nice hops and such. Bottle is awesome and I assume that is what draws a lot of people to this beer and maybe even helps boost the ratings?. Nice flavor but a touch sweet at the end. Other than that, this is a nice beer from a great brewery"

"I am a big fan of IPA's and bitter Belgian style beers so this was a perfect match for me. Color was absolutely extraordinary, however was a bit disappointed with the head retention. I also tend to like a more dry finish while this was a little sweet. Overall, I was really impressed with the color, clarity, and finish of this beer. I highly recommend."

"“So hoppy it’s got a bunny in it,” and my personal favourite; “It’s got an orange aftertaste, but it’s still bleeding hops.” Makes for good conversation."
"A- deeper amber color. Pours very little head but nice lacing. S- citrus and caramel. Reminiscent of a Belgian ale. T- sweet with good malt backbone. Bitter aftertaste, almost tart. M- medium with hops lingering. Decent carbonation. O- with the intriguing yet almost repulsive artwork on the bottle this delivers for me. A good hop to malt ratio with Belgian yeast pleases my taste buds and is very drinkable to my standards."

"Poured into pint glass. A really great take on an often poorly executed style. Flying Dog delights us again with the Raging Bitch. Great dark golden color, the Bitch pours easily into room temperature pint glass. Leaves behind medium lacing with a rich golden-white head. Easy belgian taste up front, followed quickly by bitter hops. The hop takes over the flavor and lingers for a bit. Mouthfeel is overall very nice. Notes of the belgian fullness are there, but in my opinion the hop bites quickly and doesn't let go. Good beer. Would drink again."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a minimal white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of malt, toasty caramel, marshmallow and spice. Those all carry over to the taste, and combine with the hops and flowers to give a distinct molasses note. The bitterness begins to come through as it warms a bit. Nice medium mouth that coats the tongue without being too oily. This isn't something I would drink frequently, but it's a really nice change of pace IPA."

"Overall, a very good beer. Clarity is outstanding. Quite hoppy. Also, the high ABV makes it very ""relaxing."""

"O - Really not sure what to think. I'm not a fan of the sweet tripel style beers, and I am a fan of IPAs, and this reminds me of a cross between those two. I'm not sure that it works for my taste. The tripel style is just a little too overpowering, almost like I poured a tripel into a glass after drinking a pale ale and didn't clean the glass out or get a new one. Interesting concept, and really not a bad beer. I could see this working for some, but it's not for me."
""
"Pours a nice copper colour with a nice off-white head and good lacing. The smell definitely reminds me of a good Belgian IPA, but it isn't particularly interesting. The taste is dominated by the hops. It's very bitter, and you can only detect a little balance from the malts. Quite piney. And I'm quite sure I can taste the Belgian yeast in there as well. Slighty oily mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation. Overall, not bad, but it doesn't go down as a favourite."
""
"This beer really didn't do it for me. I've drank plenty of Belgian beers and plenty of IPAs, many high alcohol beers, but this beer was not enjoyable. Not sure where to put my finger on it, and I won't stoop as low as gross, but I'd almost rather have bud light."

""
""
"O: I wasn't a fan of this one. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great. However, if you are new to craft and want to try an IPA for the first time without having your palate be bombarded, check this one out. Raging Bitch is decent IPA, just not astounding. Would be good for the curious but not too crazy beer lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first Belgian style IPA and it's pretty much what I imagined. More on the American IPA spectrum with undertones of belgian yeast and spices. Perhaps a bit sweet for my liking, but quite decent really. Bitterness lingers. Wouldnt pick this over what I'm used to in an American IPA, but something ill consider again if I want to switch things up and in the mood for a more earthy IPA"

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"Attracted by the art by Ralph Steadman (he drew all the illustrations for Hunter S. Thompson) and was excited to find a very nice beer. A nice hazy yellow amber pour with a lasting head. The smell had a lot of citrus hops to it. Upon the taste though you get a lot of complex flavors within. The hops compliment the Belgian yeast perfectly and I found the beer to be very refreshing. A beer with great flavors, cool name, awesome artwork. I thought it was great."

"M - You can taste the alcohol on the aftertaste, but its not detrimental at all. In my opinion. its a very good sessionable beer with 8.3% abv. It has a good taste. Only downside is the alcohol can creep up on you."
""
""
""
"Taste: After not being all that impressed with the smell I didn't expect a lot from the taste but it is actually pretty good. There is a little bit of a floral taste with a slight hint of sweetness that finishes off bitter but not too bitter."

"Nice reddish amber color. Slightly brown head that leaves a nice lace. Citrusy (orange, grapfruit) nose. Smells like an IPA! Kinda tastes like an IPA but there is something else in there. Perhaps a burnt flavor? Not sure. Doesn't make it a completely different beast. It just makes it a litte different. Ever so slightly chewy, and a bit sticky in the mouth. This beer is good. Very refreshing (though I am thirsty!). Its high alcohol content can make it dangerous! Guess I'll find out. Yum"
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not the biggest fan of Belgian style beers, but the added hops to consider this an India pale ale are a nice touch. The beer is well balanced and not too heavy, but it is very strong and did not go well with dinner. The flavor profile was slightly confusing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all a really good beer."
""

"I am glad that I only purchased a single bottle of this one this time around. I don't know... maybe this bottle was from a bunch that wasn't stored properly for awhile before being refrigerated at the retailer. I am willing to come back to this one again after some time to give it another shot."
""
"O- Not for the faint of heart, this is a high octane brew with regards to aroma, flavor and alcohol. For its proclaimed status of 'Belgian IPA,' I think Flying Dog has absolutely nailed the style. I am happy that this is a year-round offering and will be back for more. (4.75)"

"I recently tasted this against ""Loose Cannon", ""Aprihop", & ""HopSlam"". Each have their place and Dogfish stood out as a great grill IPA. Great beer for standing around a grill full of burgers, steaks and dogs. I typically love belgian style IPAs, and this one stood right up there with all the others."

"I'd expect a ""Belgian"" IPA to be a little heavier on the pale malts, rather than the dark caramel, but this is a fine example of an American-Belgian hybrid. I've had it a few times before, but this is by far the freshest (bottled less than two weeks ago) and it seems to make a huge difference. As it warms, the aroma and flavors come alive and really make an impression. DO NOT drink this beer too cold, you will be doing both it and you a disservice. Overall, as long as I can find it fresh, I think I'll be buying a lot more of this."

""
""
""
"This is a good beer for a high ABV beer. Not really heavy and you can drink more than one at a sitting because it not so heavy. If you are looking for a good high ABV beer and you like IPA's this is a good one to try out. I would recommend this beer."
""
"pours amber brown with some head and sticky lacing. aroma provides banana, some farm and citrus. flavor spicy with lemon peel. good sweet malty finish, pretty thick but goes down swift. had this a while ago and didn't enjoy it, had a cough syrup note. this is improved"

"Very nice, and among the best of the style that I've had. Definitely more PA than Belgian IPA, as the Belgian yeast flavors while present, stand in the background after experiencing the hoppiness of this beer. The hops are more prominently featured than the Belgian yeast, making this one of the hoppier Belgian IPA's I've had but definitely a pleasure as it is full-flavored, yet restrained and balanced well enough."

"Taste, some sweetness, some grapefruit, and some malt. It wasn't a bad beer, but the fact that this is supposedly their best beer, I had high expectations and this fell short of those expectations. It really was just your ordinary beer you would get off tap at any local bar. I will have forgotten the taste of this beer by tomorrow. In this day and age where breweries are REALLY stepping up their games, this one would fall in the bottom 40% of beers that are not worth your money. Paid $13 for a 6-pack, really should not have exceeded $10."

"Had this at The Blind Tiger Ale house in NYC- It was cask- poured by gravity- so it just kind of slowly pours out of the cask. Once poured, looks like apple cider- very cloudy, hazy, no foam or any kind of head. Citrus and grassy aromas upfront. The interesting thing about cask conditioned ales, and I really have had only a few in my life- is the almost absence of carbonation. There is some to let you know this is a beer. Amazingly smooth to me given the hop kick- which is immediate. The dryness hits you hard- grapefruit like any other IPA- but the yeast has sugary like flavor that lets you know this is Belgian style. Overall- an experience- really unlike regular tap beers. Because of the lack of carbonation, it is easy to drink quickly, and at high ETOH- it will catch up to you quickly. A must try for any beer connoisseur or anyone who wants to try something different."

"BBD 073/14. Amber pour with a full head and lasting lacing. Low strength nose comprised of Belgian yeast spiciness, a touch of grapefruit hops and light malt sweetness. Almost medium body with a nice slick mouthfeel. Normal carbonation level. The flavor profile is interesting and complex. Against a sweet malt background, grapefruit hop flavor leads to a tasty slight bitterness that is both tart and spicy. The 8.3% alcohol is well hidden and expresses itself only as that nice residual alcohol burn on the finish. The finish is smooth and lingers with a touch of tart and bitter. An outstanding offering from FD."

"Easily the best year round Flying Dog Brewery product. Not that some of the others aren't good, its just that this beer is superior. Its wonderful. It doesn't matter if its room temperature or frosty cold, this beer goes down smooth and leaves you with an aftertaste that makes you crave another one. I can't say enough good things about this beer. It has a rich taste and a slightly bitter hop after thought on your taste buds. Every restaurant should have it because it pairs well with a variety of foods. Every pub should have it because you don't find beers this smooth for the ABV concentration that it is comprised of. A++++"

"O-Definition of okay beer. Expected more. Great label art. Quality brewery. Smells and tastes were too muted. There was too much bitter finish without a balance of quality sweet malts & juicy citrus to wash said bitters out. Citrus tastes rotten. Like old grapefruit. But with a robust beer drinker palate, this isn't nauseating. Raging Bitch has enough Belgian and IPA nuances to be branded a Belgian IPA. An affordable introduction to the style. Packed with a high 8.30% ABV, Raging Bitch is by no means a regret. With few BIPA's out there to drink it's worth a try, and that's about it."

"O: While I'd be lying if I called this one world-class, I'd also being doing a great injustice if I didn't give it the praise it deserves. This is a fairly common brew (at least in my area) that delivers everything I look for: good nose, full-flavor, and exceptional flavor. While I'd be wary to session with this, I'll definitely be revisiting it in the near future and I'll definitely be recommending this to others... With caution, of course. Because when you trifle with a Raging Bitch, you're bound to get bit."

"O- This was a strange, yet very cool, experience for me. I love Belgian Ales and IPAs, and this was the first time I've had, or even thought of, the flavors being combined. It was like Delirium Tremens mixed with an IPA. It took a few minutes to accept what was going on, but the more it happened, the more I realized how beautifully the flavors complemented and balanced eachother. I'll be having this one from time to time."

"Raging Bitch pours a cloudy bronze color with a small lacing head. There is a harsh and very hoppy aroma. The taste has sweet Belgian candy flavors, but then finishes with a harsh earthy and hoppy flavor. Full body, full flavors, weird flavors. Overall its a very strange beer, it doesn't really know what it is or trying to be, I feel like its someone mixed an old IPA with a Belgian strong."

"O: flavored like a massively over-hopped heffe, hop flavor is just one dimension... bitter"
""
""

"Overall: This is my first Belgian-style IPA, so my confidence in this review is rather low. I'd like to try more of this style, although I currently like malty beers which this style isn't. Accordingly, I did like the way this beer sweetened as it warmed."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/20/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear orange amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, bread, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, clove, pepper, banana, caramel, bread, floral, grass, pine, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, clove, pepper, banana, caramel, bread, floral, grass, pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian IPA style. All around great balance and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Good Belgian style IPA. Not to hoppy, but with a good flavor. High alcohol content, good taste. First beer that i have tried from flying dog brewery. I think the art work in the bottle makes the beer appear most special than it actually is. Bought this beer at the world of the beers in West Henrietta."

"o: Enjoyable and a bit different, but probably not special enough for me to want to buy this again. Too many other brews out there of similar quality at an even better price, or better quality at a similar price. But I suppose if you live in Mid-Atlantica where this dog flies lowest, you might pick it over, say, Green Flash WCIPA, SN Torpedo or Lagunitas IPA and not feel particularly shortchanged."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Raging Bitch appears to be angry because she can't stand stably on shoes that hurt (like new). The foundation is out of balance, unable to merge styles without unpleasant clash. I wonder what she might do if left in the bottle for a while--perhaps lay down a bit and let some classier spice emerge."
""
""
"330 ml. bottle. Hazy amber-apricot colour, with an off white head that has a correct retention and a ggod lace. Smell of tropical fruits (mango), spices: coriander, clove, citrus and some skunky feel. Medium body, thick and rough palate. Taste of mango, spices, marzipan?, caramel, pine needle. Dry finish. A beast."

"Pours clear and true amber with a finger of foam that fell quickly to some soapy lace. Nose is funky with Belgian yeast, tropical fruits with a touch of sour, grass and floral hop notes and a generous, deep and bready malt underneath to round it all out. There’s a touch of skunk in the nose that’s outrageous and frolicsome. As it warms the fruits come out banana and bubblegum. Up front taste is malt, dank, floral and fruity. The sour hops and bitter climb in mid palate for a delightful expression. It’s plenty fruity with citrus, banana and tangerine but the malt stays up strong well into the drink and the dry finish. Some medicinal alcohol on the palate but it’s agreeable & warming. Mouthfeel is buttery smooth, totally enjoyable & finishes bitter with a plucky aftertaste. This is a vivacious Belgian IPA that lives up to it’s reputation in every way."
""
"In the end, this is quite good. Recommended for Double IPA lovers looking for something different. For Belgian IPAs, I think this goes a bit too far with the IPA qualities."

"sort of the flagship beer for these guys, this one is everywhere, but somehow I missed it until now. thick like all the flying dog beers are, this one is well hoppy, but more bitter hops meets mildly red malt, and its not a totally perfect fusion, but the Belgian yeast helps them be more cohesive. I like the creamy feel and the bitterness, but I don't care for the sharp acidic almost sweetness, or the way this stays filling in my stomach long after just a single beer. the 8.3% is also a little excessive, although I don't think its too forward or interfering with the intended flavors. its in balance, but its just not fantastic. probably overhyped to some extent, and like I always say, still waiting for a flying dog beer that really wows me."

"O: Pretty sweet and the hops in it bounces flavors around a lot. But I love the complexly and the bite at the end. I see where she gets her name from. This is my first Belgain-Style IPA so I don't really know how to compare it to others. And I think I could only drink one at a setting."
""
""
""
"Overall: I wasn't expecting to like this because of the mixed reviews and I'm not generally a fan of IPAs (Belgian or otherwise). That being said this beer probably won't appeal to the hopheads but if you're trying to get into the style this might be a good starting point"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Some crossover styles are terrific. Some are simply awful. This is sort of a blend of two good beers but the result is just OK. The aroma is terrific but the hops just overpower any Belgian character. I shouldn't be surprised at that but the aroma is such a tease in that regard. I don't think I'd rate it as low as The Bros or as high as the readership."

"Had this at The Half Pint in the west village NYC. Raging Bitch pours a nice toasted orange color with a full, foamy white head. Great aroma of tropical fruits, fresh cut flowers, and pine. I found that this beer benefits quite a bit from being on cask, as it added earthy complexity, with the hops still very prevalent, tasting more 'resinous' than they typically do on standard tap or our of the bottle. There was a bit of a yeasty funk as well, that was not at all unpleasant. Although the mouth feel was moderately light, I felt that this was very warming on its way down. Overall a great IPA to try on cask."

"This brew was way too sweet for my taste. My favorite brew is a DIPA, so I guess that I am a hop head. I bought a six pack of this beer with the intriguing name and gave away 5 of the bottles. I guess I will never again try a beer that has ""Belgian style"" on the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great brew--not for beginners, amateurs, posers, BMC only dullards, toddlers, dabblers, or anybody unaffiliated with serious beer. This would be too good for them."
""
""
""
"At first sip, the remnants of the head offer up zesty notes of citrus. Several sips later, it's clear that this beer tends to use it's 10% alcohol content punch-up it's flavor profile instead of letting the ingredient speak for themselves. That's actually not a bad thing, but it does leave something to be desired after the experience is over. I'd revisit this review after a heavier meal prior to consuming another bottle. On its own, it doesn't do much to leave a lasting impression."
"not one of the best belgian ipas out there. poured into a chimay chalice (goblet) gave me a finger and a half worth of head that wa a slightly dark orange color. smells like an ipa with a belgian yeast strain, but mostly taste like an ipa. mouthfell is medium. gf's le freak or some of the others are much better examples' but this is not a bad beer"

"My third review, and as I said in the first two, please bare with me. Out of the bottle and into the glass, this is a pretty beer - a dark, transparent copper. The average pour produced about an inch of light white head, and as I drank the lacing clung to glass the entire way to the initial pour. The smell really made me want to dive right in; sweet biscuit, some banana, a touch of piney hops. The taste closely mimicked the smell, yet only sweeter. That delicious biscuit is up front but the sweetness surges forward. Next, I tasted a rush of banana and some unique candy, which is best described as bubblegum, but is much more indescribably unique. The hops don't appear until after the brew leaves the pallet. With the hoppy aftertaste, I get a nice boozey rush as well. The mouth feel is a bit watery, maybe even oily for the style. Overall, this beer is delicious, but the sweetness deters from the style and may prohibit prolonged drinkability."

"Interesting brew. I think the recipe must've changed over the years. Don't recall so much tropical fruit character. Bitterness is a bit too much for my palate, but love the flavor overall. I'll tolerate the bitterness for the flavor complexity."
""
"O: Delicious. I REALLY REALLY love the combo of Belgian yeast with citrusy American hops. Phenomenal combo, somewhat similar to what I've done with some of my homebrews (saison yeast, wheat, citrusy US hops)."

"The taste drops hints that it is a Belgian style IPA with the pale malts, banana, and bubblegum (like the aroma) and moderate hop bitterness lingering on at the finish. But there is something rather off about it. It has this graininess or something I cannot quite define. It looked and smelled good but it slipped on the taste."

"M: After just taking sips of the beer tho, it kinda shows you the complete opposite of its taste. Allowing you to leave it in your mouth so smooth and subtle, until your ready to swallow it whole in which you encounter its full wrath and flavor."

"Overall: The flavor of this beer is great and I would like to have it often. However, with an ABV of over 8%, I would need to keep an eye on my consumption, which brings this rating down slightly."

""
""
"*I have to add, I wonder afterwards if this beer is bad? I just opened a Smuttynose IPA, which I've had before, purchased at the same time/place-today, and it is obviously bad, not the great IPA I remember, at all!"
"O - I was unsure about this brew at first. I drank one and decided I would write the review a couple days later after I had the chance to drink a few more of these. I've just about polished off the 6'er and I have to say that I will miss this when it's gone. I don't pick up much if any of the Belgian character I was expecting...seems like a pretty straight forward IPA. Very hoppy / piney. Not my favorite style (I'm a porter / stout guy) but I enjoyed the change up from the routine. I also had fun explaining to my 7 year old why daddy's beer had a ""bad word"" on the bottle! LOL!"
""
""
"Pours a nice clear amber with a half finger of off white head trade fades. Smell is full of hops and a bit fruity. More hops in the taste, has an east coast like hop bitterness. There is also a nice fruity note. Good amount of sweetness to balance the hops. There is also some Belgian spice hanging around, but you have to pay attention to not miss it."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable, complex brew. With a variety of different elements - sweet, sour, bitter, and rich - it's hard to put a label on it. I've been drinking this for a few years, and have never thought about it as hard as I did tonight. Would definitely recommend, and I'm curious to see where this style goes in the future. Cheers!"
""
"D: a style that is a bit tough to hit, at least in my opinion, flying dog does a pretty good job here. I gotta say this is definitely one of their more enjoyable brews and worth picking up."
""
""
""
"Certainly quite interesting, but it seemed to have a couple loose ends, some of the belgian style eventually shines through behind the strong hop character. Interesting take, but I think some of the other examples of this style are more balanced and more interesting. Definitely pleasant to drink though."

"A slightly cloudy orange body with an off-white cap that rises to fill the glass. Some sip marks appear, but they are light. The nose is of citrus and light bready malt. Some pine and yeasty esters poke through with just a faint hint of booze. The flavor profile follows the nose. Citrus and pine with some floral hops poke through up front. Some bready malt through the middle with spicy esters from the yeast. The finish is a touch spicy, with bitter citrus, and some faint warming. Medium body, a bit oily. Smooth. This beer is a little all over the place. Brash in spots and not congruent from one layer to another. Not a bad beer by any stretch, but not as tight and smooth as the best in the class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer smells fruity with a higher than average alcohol content of 8.3%. The beer is a dark amber color when poured into a bottle with a heavy amount of white lacing. Flying Dog forces carbonation in their beer so there is heavy head on this beer. It leads to a smooth, crisp heavily carbonated (though not in a bad way) mouthfeel. The taste is slightly sweet due to the Belgian yeast but neither that nor the taste of the hops linger. This is a very drinkable beer."

"I poured from a bottl into a pint glass, deep orange pour, with a moderate white head. The aroma has a decent amount of Belgian yeast, alon with pine and grapefruit. It taste like it smells, very heavy on belgian yeast and grapefruit, lingering bitter/sweet finish. The body is full/medium, moderate carbonation, easy drinking for ABV. Not usually a fan of this brewery, but this one seems to hit the mark. IMO a very good example of the style."

"O- Weird beer, never had one like it before."

""
"Cheers!"

"Tried it on two more occasions, after other various beers and found a unusual wheat beer taste to it. Will have to investigate further."
"Last thoughts: My mouth still has that lingering bitter, alcohol, chalky, IPA residue on it. Thank goodness I'm home for the night. If I were driving somewhere after drinking this beer, a cop would be able to smell this on my breath for hours after drinking it. I am ashamed to write this review as I genuinely liked this beer on my first sip..."

"I really like this beer! I think it's very smooth yet hoppy. Not that this is significant, but the illustration on the packaging is pretty cool. I'm drinking it right now, in fact. My friends and I have been enjoying it this week. I definitely recommend this beer. It isn't too expensive."
""
"O: Huge props to FD for being able to make this so balanced. The malts, hops, yeast, and alcohol blend so extremely well and makes this a great example of the style. Obviously it leans more towards American versions, but it is relatively tame (or at least it seems like it with the way everything goes together). Worth picking up"

"To the Point: damn this is one nice ale. I will be keeping this Raging Bitch around too! This is worthy of a six pack purchase. If you don’t like it send me the other five."

"O: IPAs (and DIPAs/IIPAs) are my favorite brews in the world. I can't say the same for wheat beers, whether they be Belgian style, or Weizens, or whatnot. However, Flying Dog's Ragin Bitch 'hybrid', is absolutely phenomenal. It kicks your ass and leaves you refreshed all at once. This would be the IDEAL beer to cool down with on a hot summer day!

The body is light enough to be refreshing. Great interpretation. The first time I drank this beer I believed it to have some soapy aromas to it but maybe it was just one bad bottle."

"Really not what I would expect from a Belgian IPA, but it's a good beer overall. Hard to score it too low because I really am enjoying it, but hard to score it too high because it isn't a great representation of the style. I'd buy it again. The higher ABV goes virtually unnoticed."

"Looks good. The nose is typical Belgian in character. The flavor is a bit too tangy, for the style. Certainly, there are some spicy hop tones on there, but there is a soapy sweet tone that is a bit too much. This is decent, but it's not quite there really. Especially with so many others of this style available. Nice beer, but not quite the Belgian IPA I'd hope for."

"Overall, this beer strikes me as an underwhelming attempt at a style becoming increasingly popular. Flying Dog's focus seemed to be not on the beer as a cohesive whole, but rather on making a voluminously hopped IPA with some fancy yeast in it."
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a 1 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, herbal hops, spices, Belgian yeast, and slight banana. Taste is of Belgian yeast and herbal hops up front with a malt finish and a slight banana aftertaste. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer in the flavor department with a great smell that makes for an easy drinking experience."

"o - a nice take on the style, more so than i was expecting. the mouthfeel is really what makes this so enjoyable for me as the belgian yeast is toned down and carbonation levels are just right. easily the best flying dog brew i have had yet."
""
""
""
""
"D: Quite good with an interesting taste profile that leans towards a malty base with belgian qualities more subdued."
""
"O-good, a slight departure from normal IPA's which is good sometimes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Their Wildeman Farmhouse Belgian IPA is far superior. The belgian yeast qualities in this are just too scaled back, giving it an average IPA feel with just a touch of sour, as if someone added a small squirt of lemon to the beer. Of the 4-5 Belgian IPA's I've had, this one is easily the least interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this beer is too over the top for me. Note to brewer- tone it down so the flavor has a chance."

"Taste is spicy, with definite notes of citrus hoppiness. Nary a hint of the relatively high ABV (8.3%). This is a well-done spicy, hoppy Belgian-style IPA that's worth revisiting."

"O: i was impressed by everything up until the taste, the sour note i described above just doesnt fit with the style or really help to make it a drinkable beer at all, i know this beer gets much praise in the community but im not seeing it here, i plan on trying it again soon to figure out if i found a bad bottle or if im just not aclimated to the taste notes"

"O - overall I really like this beer. I am a huge IPA guy and Belgians are my second favorite style. My only knock the beer is more of a 70% IPA and 30% Belgian. The Belgian style takes a backseat the the aggressive hoppy flavor. The first beer has a better balance of yeast and banana flavor but with all the hops, alcohol and malts the Belgian style gets lost. With all that being said I would drink this a any day, and any time. If you like aggressive IPAs then I would recommend this fo sho!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This has definitely surpassed my expectations and turned out to be a very nice Belgian-style IPA that packs a huge hop bite yet has enough room for the yeast and the malts to shine. Recommended!"
"O: Great beer, love the belgian yeast and the sour notes. European hops are great here."
""
""
""
""

"Everything about this bitchin' IPA is aggressive. Buy the ticket. Take the ride. You look at the bottle and think, ""what kind of post-apocalyptic nightmare have I found myself in today?"" As you pour, you inleash the fury of the raging hounds of hell. They first assault your senses with a subtle and spicey smell, luring you into thinking this clear, perfectly carbonated drink might not be the violent ride thought it was. When you take your first sip, all doubt is put to rest. You are being attacked by an animal of a beverage. It's already got you in it's jaws. It's going for the kill. Violent hops, stinging spices, strong yet masked alcohol...this beer is a killer. When it's over, the only thing you are left wondering is ""what the hell just happened?"" and ""what's a Belgian-style IPA doing being so American""? Then you do what Hunter would do and have another."
""
""
"Giving this a solid 4 in everything. I have not had another ""Belgian style"" IPA to compare it with yet. But this is a good beer. Aftertaste to me is rather spicy. Not in a bad way though. Tons of flavors each sip with this beer that you tend to notice till the last bit. At $48 a case and $14 a six pack i dont get much of it. One of them beers you want to drink at home with some friends. It will get you nice and toasty lol."
""
"I had been hearing good things about this Flying Dog effort and found them to be mostly true! This has a nice balance to it between those bold American hop flavors and Belgian yeast notes that kept them quite complimentary to each other. This drank nicely for the bigger size here as well. I’ll be returning to this."

"Pours a hazy orange color with a decent sized white head that dissipates and leaves a nice lacing throughout the glass. Aroma of peaches, plums, pear and belgian yeast. Tastes of same fruits, belgian yeast and a slight bittnerness that follows in the aftertaste but doesn't stick around. Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the robustness of the hops and the funk through both the nose and the flavoring. The aroma sets up the tasting beautifully, with all the bittering Belgian activity that one might hope for, while leaving plenty of room for balance from equally as bittering hops, and a sweeter malt base. One criticism is that the booze, particularly at the end of the flavoring, could be a bit overwhelming at times, taking away some of the balance previously lauded."

"Poured into a snifter this beer pours brilliantly clear copper color with a moderate white head that diminished to a skim but leaves some bits of lacing. The aroma is a tango of spicy yeast character, fruity esters and citrus--lemony hops, nice. The initial flavor is largely spicy phenols, immediately replaced by moderate citrus hop flavor. The beer finishes with a dry hop bitterness that lingers and welcomes the reemergence of the yeast character. The body is moderate and carbonation medium-high. Overall a good looking, good smelling and tasty brew. Definitely worth trying, though some tweaking with hop flavor/bitterness and carbonation would be interesting to see if this beer could be elevated further."

"Coming from a brew so named, I didn't expect such a balanced beer. Pours a light amber with a white one inch head, dissipating into nice lacing. Lots of visible carbonation. On the nose, I notice the aroma of Belgian style yeast, and some pine. Also some sweet malt. I am also getting some citrus, orange peel. This beer begins bitter, then you get the familiar Belgian beer flavor, then you get the hops again. I am picking up notes of pine and citrus, some grapefruit. Although this beer has a relatively high alcohol content, though it does not taste hot. i would say that is of medium body, though the alcohol does catch up to you. I am quite pleased with this beer. It is everything that I would expect from the style."
""
""
"Had this one at Bierkraft earlier today on a whim, and was impressed. This is the first Flying Dog I've had, because I tend to find their schtick annoying, but coming out of the cask, this one was a winner. It has a nice, cloudy gold and amber hue with lots of fruity hop aromas. The body and taste work well together, as the malt is present, but soft, which works well with the lower carbonation of the cask, and the mild diacetyl."
""
""
"O - I love this beer because it opened me up to a whole new world of styles. Flying Dog is a decent brewery, if you were going to try any of their brews this should be the one."
"O- This beer was pretty decent, however there are many other IPAs that I would rather drink. The taste wasn't bad, however the yeast, spice, and hops didn't really balance the best in my opinion. The yeast was a little bit too overpowering for an IPA and didn't match the best with the bitterness. I also prefer a little bit more sweetness and flavor. Other then that it was a very drinkable beer, especially at 8.3%."
"There is something in the flavor that I just can't put my finger on, but the beer is good. Absolutely beautiful and enjoyable all around."
""
""
""

"A pretty good beer, tastes more like an American barleywine than a BIPA. Can't complain about it quality-wise but might not be what you are expecting coming in. Worth trying though and would have it again."
"D: A good bitch. More nice than raging. But that is just fine. Robust and complex – tons going on with good depth. No clash as can happen in this style. All the aspects work well together. Very interesting, yet pleasant and scarily drinkable for the abv. Luckily the richness of it slow down a bit."

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear coppery orange amber. Nice one finger white head and lacing. Aroma of Belgian spices, light and exotic fruit, light sweet malt. Interesting combination of hops, malt, citrus and light fruit to start, finish is a bit dry and and abrupt which doesn't present the residual citrus and piney hops that well. Nice medium almost creamy body. I really like the subdued, well integrated flavors of the start and middle, which make up for the finish."

"I'd call it an IPA with some Belgian flavors. But it's a wilder IPA than a lot of the pack. Apparently they jiggled a bottle enough for Ralph Steadman to notice and pontificate about it. 12 oz bottle from Best Damn beer store in San Diego."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This is the only area for improvement. I would have liked a heavier mouthfeel that went down a bit smoother. Oh well, its a small critique on an otherwise wonderful brew."
"O-Received as a gift and would definitely buy this one for myself. A surprise to me because when I hear Belgian I think sweet, which this is not the case at all. This is right in my round house as far as IPA's go."
""
""
"Reddish copper, with a voluminous white head. Big chuny and sticky lace lines the walls of the glass and relatively dense head retains atop the beer. Nose is floral and juicy with a light herbal quality, just as expected from an American interpretation of a Belgian style - big hop notes amidst a generous amount of Belgian yeast notes. Light bready maltiniess, and hints of spice. Alcohol is detectable. Malt and yeast take over on the palate, light sugariness and a bit of dryness in the finish. Hop notes are muted, and there a slight candy note; gentle and understated bitterness in the finish. Some resin-y notes come through. No alcohol on the palate, smooth carbonation (an actually quite favourable). Easily drinkable but not too complex or desirable, I could revisit this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer, great name. Want to see more of this style across the board. Have been impressed with this brewery. Will never forget how this helped break the ice with the girlfriends mom by recommending it to her while out to dinner."
"Copper colour with 1.5 fingers of white head, quite a bit of lacing left behind as well. Smell is spicy and yeasty, some citrus fruit, fairly big malt presence as well, the mix of hops and belgian yeast give off a ginger spiciness as well, lightly floral. Taste starts of dry and yeasty, spicy, bitter and fairly hoppy, some alcohol heat, some sweetness at times, earthy and citrusy aftertaste. High carbonation, quite dry, nice weight and fairly full bodied. Though at first I really couldn't decide if I liked this or not but this is pretty good, definitely something I would revisit."

"O: this is a great beer. Now one of my favorites. Well balanced and moderately priced."
""
"Overall this is some really delicious nectar. I wish I had gotten more. I bought it because I’m curious about BIPAs. This one is definitely more on the IPA side than the Belgian side –mostly an IPA but with some Belgian-banana-smelling softness. Within the style, this is sort of opposite the White Birch Hooksett Ale from NH - that one is more Belgian-ey, less hoppy."

"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer isn't the most gulpable but is still more than sippable. The body is a pretty standard density for the style, but is a bit on the sticky side. The carbonation is certainly doing a lot in the background but is not really noticeable. As such, more carbonation could definitely help to increase this beer's drinkability and cut the stickiness of the body."

""
""
"Like the smell, definite grassy hops up front, good bitterness, somewhat mild sweetness, detect some light sugary candy but the taste consists mostly of the hops with a definite alcohol presence."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid brew, definitely for sipping. IPA's with citrus like hops are what I tend to lean towards and this one is a fine example. Can't beat the price either, I paid $7.48 for a six-pack."

"O: Kind of reminds me of Stone Ruination IPA in a way, but it's cheaper, more satisfying to drink, and just as ruinous. And more phenolic, can't forget that. A definite winner in my book, though be warned this could pass for a DIPA in terms of bitterness."

"Recommended by a gentleman in Watertown. Wow. Cool beer. I read the bros review...but I must disagree. An excellent beer. Wonderfully rich hop aroma. Dry hopped for sure. Piney. Taste is interesting indeed. Huge hops with a spicy bite. Peppery perhaps from a Belgian yeast. So smooth with a rich mouthfeel. Gentle but lingering bitterness. High marks. Bros...try this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great beer fresh or with a little age. If you get it fresh it's pretty bitter and the hops shine, wait a little and the hops mellow out and the Belgian yeast shines."

""
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian IPA."
"Whoa, a most excellent beer. Served at a good temperature, with a large, foamy, frothy, off white head that settles to a light cover after a bit and lots of lace. Color is a clear medium amber with some bubble trails. Flavor is huge hop with plenty of malt, dry, spice, carbonic tang, a little banana. Body is perfect, ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, very long and only a hint of alcohol. Good hop head brew."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance- light to medium amber. Smell is refreshing and hoppy, with hints of malt. Mouthfeel is, well, let me see if we can discribe this. It hits the tongue with sweetness and then move around to the back with slight bitterness. Then it is gone, nice. Taste is great. Overall this beer is very fridge worth and will complement ribs very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There is so much going on here! A wonderful complexity of flavors here, not exactly balanced here as there is a definite order and progression, but I LOVE the progression in this Belgian IPA. None of the acts in this play stands out, they work perfectly together. I love this beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice light yellow amber, clear with good lace and head. Pleasant hoppy scent with flowers in the background. Flavors are a battle between hoppy ale and yeasty floral ale that never reconciles itself with balance. Part of the reason is the differing types of water that go with these two experiences. Overall an o.k. brew."

"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are all spot-on, but the most detracting aspect of this beer is the bitterness it brings that seems to overshadow them at times. This is a pretty decent, easily-available Belgian IPA, but I'd probably have to give the edge to Great Divide's Belgica in terms of one I can grab off the shelf."

"while its actually an ok IPA, its not really belgian in any way. Aside from the slight belgian yeast smell, there is little else to be considered belgian here. So, if this was just an IPA, id give this a bit better score, but its not."
"Glad to grab a 6 pack while they are still available. Head is short lived into minimal lacing on the glass edge. Copper color is a bit darker than one would expect given the taste. Aroma is complex but dominated by hops that are present throughout smell and taste. Pronounced bitterness with dry finish. Best of both worlds for those who like belgians and hops."
"Morey's Bottom Line: While I'm not a fan of the artwork, or the name of this beer...I have to say, it's what's in the bottle that really counts. And what's in this bottle is a really good beer. Cheers!"
"O: This brew kicked some serious butt. Love the style. Great balance and superior flavor."
"O-great Belgian IPA. One of the hoppier versions I have had. Manages to include both the gentle banana/citrus taste up front with an alcohol kick at the end, but the flavors are distinct and they go well together. My favorite offering from Flying Dog."
"Had in a 12oz bottle on 8/5/11 (have had it before but never reviewed)."
"O- Most definitely an interesting beer. Tasty and uniqie. Worth seeking out."
"As far as drinkability goes, this is one of the best DIPAs to date. The lower alcohol helps, and I found the spices kept me coming back (in most beers they keep me away). I'll probably pick up a 4pk next time I see this. I suspect some this DIPA would be good fresh or old, and anywhere between, so I'd like to experiment."
"An imposter of style but still quite a lusty offering which I just can't ignore. Could happily drink another six, maybe seven in succession."
"O - As a Belgian IPA, this misses the mark. As just a DIPA, it is pretty good, but not among the top tier."
"Recommended Music Pairing - Vince Guaraldi - Black Orpheus"
"O: a great belgian ipa. More of a DIPA with some belgian influence, this is a great unique brew worth trying. Very complex taste but not confusing."
"overall: this beer really blends the two styles of tripel and ipa together beautifully. After getting an idea in my head of what the style should be, this has definitely come the closest to that idea. Pretty damn close, in fact. The only quip about it that I have is that while I think it is pretty much stylistic perfection because it fits my definition almost exactly, it just doesn't have that intangible bliss factor that comes with a perfect beer. It is because it so closely fits the definition that it isn't perfect. There's just no feeling of bending the rules to make something unique but still stylistically accurate. I will most definitely be buying this beer again, but it just doesn't have the ability to make me break from thinking analytically about the beer like an A+ beer should. I'm still giving it a 4.5 overall because it is so well crafted, really and truly. Just a technically astounding beer."
"O - Not a bad beer by any means and one I would definitely have again. I would really like to try it a) on-tap and b) in a different glass. However, were I in the mood to go out and buy another Belgian IPA (on which I intend), I would probably try out something else."
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a hazy orange-red, with a sticky one inch white head. Smell is clove, pine, citrus, and a little banana. Taste that, but more pine and citrus than the others. More IPA than Belgian. That is why I love this beer. Very drinkleable for it's abv. Great body, with plenty of life. Wish didn't have to leave state to get it."
"Overall I love this beer. It is interesting, complex, and drinkable. I feel like the IPA characteristics and the big Belgian characteristics are in conflict more than they are in harmony, though. Definitely well made and worth a try though."
"O - I didn't really get much of a belgian taste in this beer. The only other belgian IPA I have had was by terapin and that definitely had that belgian taste to it. There's better cheaper IPAs out there that I would buy before I buy this again. It just didn't have what it advertised."
"The finish is hoppy upfront and all about the spicy character of belgian yeast on the back end. great bready aftertaste lingers."
"O: A good beer; definitely worth a try– could easily see someone enjoying this a lot."
"O - If high alcohol content and crazy hop bite is your thing then go for it. But if you're thinking you'll be getting a unique, complex mix of the subtle flavors of a Belgian and the balls out flavor of an IPA, you'll be a bit disappointed."
"O: cool bottle, interesting name, great beer. Very interesting beer, haven’t tried anything like this, and it sooo good I could drink this beer all day. Very hard to give this a rating, if I could I would give it a 4.25 for taste and total."
"Not bad, but not my favorite of the style. Maybe freshness played a role?"
"Pours orange honey color with nice frothy off white head which sticks around with nice lacing, bubbles. Aroma of belgian yeast, spices, with hops noticeable, spices dominating. Smooth, creamy mouth feel with slight booziness on the breathe after a sip. Warming. Notes of east-coasty hops, floral, pungent, slightly citric, with belgian spices and yeast very much involved, hops prevailing on the finish. Best brew I have had in awhile, very glad I chose this."
"O - Overall, I really like this one. Probably enjoyed it more on tap than out of the bottle but I'm glad to have tried it again. This could be my favorite brew from Flying Dog besides Gonzo."
"O-A decent beer, but it just seemed like there could have been a little something more."
"To be honest this one is BIT too bitter, not much but the first sips are bitter. After that the beer grows on you and the bitterness fades away."
"On cask at tap and mallet."
"This beer is one of, if not actually, my favorite Belgian IPA's. Super hop-forward, but doesn't over-power the Belgian flavor. The bready malts provide a nice backbone to all the flavors bouncing around. Just a great example of a BIPA and an awesome beer all-around."
"O: Flying Dog makes some good stuff, but this is underwhelming. It's far from undrinkable, but there's no single redeeming positive, either. I'd like this to either assert it's hop/booze-bomb traits, or aim for a more complex blend of Belgian and American flavors. This is caught unfavorably in-between."
"M: Pretty standard. Carbonation is medium, initial feel is very smooth, medium body."
"Overall, on cask pretty straight forward. With a mild body and big chewy malt and hint of hop goodness on the finish to give a sense of ipa fun."
"This is a lovely beer. It's pretty much a light American IPA that is spliced with the interest and roundness of Belgian yeast to give it something surprising. A very clear exemplar of the style, and one of the best of the style I've had."
"Overall: A very tasty and solid take on an IPA. The spicy yeast and American hops make for a nice combination."
"O- I'm loving this beer, especially as it warms up. For a beer that incorporates ingredients and flavors that can easily run wild and take over, a delicate balance is achieved and makes this one very memorable. I would certainly buy this again."
"A pretty good beer if you like IPAs and are in the mood for one with a nice twist to it. Definitely worth tasting if given the chance."
"Smoother than expected, and of a style I drink rarely, this is a good brew. Dry finish with a nice grapefruit linger. Medium bodied though leaning fuller. Lightish effervescence though prominent on the tip of the tongue to start. Warming in the throat. A good brew to be sure but the ABV says ""just one, son""."
"Overall I thought this was pretty good beer, and it made for a pretty good first experience with a Belgian IPA. Since this was my first Belgian IPA I was unsure of how the Belgian yeast would work with a hop forward beer and I was pretty happy with how well the two went together and I will for sure be looking to try more of this style. I thought that the alcohol was hidden pretty well and I wouldn't mind having another one but I think two in one sitting would be my limit. The things I liked most about this beer was its appearance, aroma, and mouthfeel they were all awesome and very well done. I liked the sweetness and the lesser presence that the citrus hops had in the taste of this beer the least, but that would be borderline nitpicking. I would for sure buy a four pack of this sometime, its a nice change from your average IPA. I think this beer is for sure worth a try, especially if you love IPA's, so pick this one up if you haven't tried it yet. It seems like all the beers I have had from the Canis Major series have all been a step above Flying Dogs regular lineup and this beer is no exception, I am glad Flying Dog stuck it to the man and got their beer into the hands of the people in Michigan that want it, I admire them for that and I wish more brewery's were as passionate about their beer as Flying Dog is."
"Overall--This is probably not what most people are looking for in an IPA, but I love it. It's balanced, tasty and refreshing. If you're looking for something outside the norm in IPAs, this is it."
"This is a good IPA if you’re looking for classic East Coast qualities blended with Belgian notes. The beer is a bit extreme (borderline imperial) and I know of a few states that have banned the beer because of the bottle artwork. Overall it’s not bad."
"A lively grapefruit flash up front leads the flavor profile, with a nicely married hop presence accenting the grain, followed by a slightly bitter back palate and a hint of sweetness in the finish. This is a well balanced IPA that is so smooth on the tongue the high gravity is hardly noticeable. Seems almost too clean though, and not so raging."
"O: A solid take on the style. I was actually expecting this one to lean more towards and American style IPA than it did. Drinkability is good. 4.0"
"Overall: If you’re still new to Belgian style IPA’s, I bet you could do a lot worse than Raging Bitch. Don’t let the name and, uh, anatomically disturbing dog on the label turn you off. This dog’ll hunt. I’m glad I made myself give this a go before Flying Dog disappears from the shelves in my hometown."
"Raging Bitch pours a slightly hazy reddish copper with a nice fluffy head. The aroma is fruity and estery, with some nice tropical fruit and a undertone of a medicinal phenolic character. Hidden under the yeasty aroma is a nice herbal, and slightly citric hoppiness. The spicy, sweet esters dominate the flavor, but after the estery sweetness fades quickly and the hops are become apparent. They are herbal and earthy, with hints of pine and citrus. Some bready malt is apparent as well. There is bitterness and phenols linger in the aftertaste, but the alcohol is hidden."
"O - Different. Not sure if it's a good different. I just don't think that the belguin flavors and the IPA flavors go together that well."
"Especially considering the very affordable pricetag, this one is a great gateway into Belgin IPAs for someone who doesn't wish to spend $15 on a 750 of Houblon Chouffe or $8 on a small Piraat."
"O- This has been one of my favorite beers for a while and it is about time I got around to reviewing it. I consider this my gateway IPA. Please Flying Dog, keep sending it to Texas!"
"O - An excellent beer. Tastes amazing, and it's always nice to have a beer who's name was involved in a court case. TAKE THAT MI liquor control board!"
"Overall, a pretty tasty brew, and it's nice to see some innovation in the style."
"O-An excellent beer, the best one I've had from Flying Dog. All the characteristics fit together almost perfectly, it's a bit pricey but if you can fork out the extra change it is totally worth it!!"
"Overall really love this beer. Fav offering from FD."
"O- My first Belgian IPA and it tasted good, but the over carbonation of this beer did not quite work for me. I would love to try more of this style though and would be interested in revisiting this one sometime. Overall I really liked this beer."
"alright, but i enjoy many of their other beers more."
"Not sure if I would buy this again for myself. Maybe for an IPA party. It is pretty interesting all in all."
"This beer was 'outlawed' under our (michigan) former governor due to the name. Now it is allowed to be sold again, and I have to say, it is wonderful, very impressive blend of 2 unique styles. Be careful as the alcohol is well hidden. This is well worth the while."
"O- Nice beer to shake things up. I would have again, but I would have trouble downing a 6pack of this in an appropriate amount of time."
"The beer appears amber and clear. Atop the fermented beverage sits an inch of dense head that leaves copious residue about the pint glass. The aroma brings spice, pepper, yeast, hops, and alcohol. The flavors are a bit scattered and rough, with too much alcohol in both the nose and taste. That said, the beer offers some pleasant spice and yeast character, and is certainly drinkable and enjoyable. Perhaps this was inspired by Belgian IPAs, but Raging Bitch is not in the same echelon with Duvel Tripel Hop or Houblon Chouffe, a couple of my favorite beers of this ilk. Overall, a decent brew. I would try this again."
"Overall a solid Belgian IPA. I've had this several times before, and I'm sure I'll have it several more times in the future."
"M - Carbonation good, creamy mouthfeel present. All told, not bad."
"Pours a clearish copper / amber color thin white head, almost no retention. Smell is initially of Belgium yeast esters, some banana, spice, oddly I don't get a very over powering hop presence? The feel is medium, some alcohol burn, a little more hops, nice sweet belgium yeast taste. The taste is a little different, it starts nice with some banana, a little sweet malt, and ends with a decent hop presence and an okay bitter after flavor which seems slightly off. Overall its about what I expect from Flying Dog, I've had three of their beers, none were great, none were bad, just average."
"Overall-Haven't had many Belgian IPAs but picked up a bottle of La Freak and Stone's Cali-Belgique to drink this week so I figured I'd have another Belgian today. Definitely not as harsh as an american IPA, but nicely balanced and refreshing."
"O - I wish the hops were a bit more prominent, but the yeast does add a nice level of complexity that works well. I'd get it again."
"D - I'm on the fence here. There are some nice qualities, but the overall flavor has some issues. Will revisit after a year or so to see if the recipe has changed."
"i don't know if this beer is a near miss or a belly flop. EITHER WAY, this does not diminish Flying Dog in my eyes -- they made a weird beer. but they made it well;>"
"I liked most of what this beer had to offer except for the aftertaste. I just can't get past that. It's a good beer, but not at the $14+/six pack price point."
"If you dislike the idea of combining a belgian and an IPA this is NOT the beer for you. I hated it the first time I tried it. Now, my fifth or sixth, combination has grown on me."
"Taste is sweet and bitter with a good spicy belgian yeast flavor. The sweetnesa is a bit too much but the mouthfeel is full and creamy. Overall it's quite good."
"i would recommend this to anyone who likes hops. very well balanced between the malts and the hops for an ipa."
"O: The ABV keeps it from being a session beer....but dang, it's tough not to keep knocking this one back. Probably the most drinkable IPA that I've gotten a hold of recently."
"O: I like Raging Bitch and it's even better on-tap. Definitely recommended. Will be looking for it on-tap again."
"Roaring out of the bottle, you can immediately smell the sweet Belgian malt, but wait. There’s something else there. Why it is the strong (almost cannibis) aroma of high alpha American hops barking sharp orders to your palate. The two are a match made in bitchdom. The initial swig shows sharp resiny hops on the sides and back on the tongue, but the candi sugar character slowly melds with that character and settles into a finish that is both malty and hoppy at the same time. Fruity yeast esters a long earthy bitter finish round this one out. Complex, yet refreshing, this one hides its 8% attitude well."
"Pours a nice reddish, amber hue; a little on the lighter side of Red Ale. A very stick lacing on the insides of the pint glass. It smells of a fruity mix, but I can pick out the smell of tangerine on the hops. The spiciness of the hops is rather smoothed-out, different from many IPA styles - the bitterness isn't as profound here. Rich in malt flavors, the traces of yeast are covered very well. Very happy with this beer, runs true to its reviews, and would definitely drink again."
"Give this one a try! While a bit crude, and definitely from deep in left field Flying Dog is onto big things with this one!"
"Overall: See drinkability."
"M. Medium bodied. Decent carbonation. The bitter on the end really builds if you drink it relatively quickly."
"Overall, I'm not particularly impressed. The first whiff of this thing was amazing, but by the time I actually stopped smelling and drank it, I was sorely disappointed. This has potential -- an American IPA with Belgian yeasts, but the end result was just nothing special."
"Mouthfeel? Euphoric. Can't wait to buy more of this stuff, and am left wondering how thisd escaped me for so long..."
"O: Surprisingly drinkable and balanced. Nothing exceptional in complexity, but balanced."
"O: This beer is pretty tasty and I wouldn't mind getting another bottle to try."
"Tasting the beer , you will be enjoying some banana, peach and honey up front. In the middle this flavors will be joint by malty notes, and brown sugar, while towards the end the great selection of hops balances and finishes this beautifully crafted IPA. Great beer, must taste."
"O: This just didn't seem to be an IPA to me, Belgian or not. Not very bitter. Very spicy, rye like qualities(not sure if it brewed with rye) Very nice easy drinking Belgian beer."
"Slightly hazed brassy amber with an ivory head. Good retention. Very fruity, like applesauce and pear juice with hints of overripe banana and a bit of peach. There's also something distantly spirituous, like good vodka or perhaps limoncello. There's a strawberry and chopped cucumber note in there that reminds me of Pimm's as well. A good mouthful develops big sweetness cut off by a quick, sharp bitterness of hops and booze. Quinine and bitter lemon, musty yeast, grapefruit rind, baked apple, and burnt orange dominate, fading into a green banana and lemon peel finish. Not bad! Almost exactly what you'd hope for in a Belgian-American hybrid."
"O: As of 7ish p.m. on the Saturday of Mem Day weekend, I have a new favorite (easy-to-find?) American Beer. Way to go Dogs."
"I support the Brewery's use of the word bitch. If you are old enough to buy beer, then you should have the maturity to be okay with the word: ""Bitch."" Obviously, Texas and Michigan lack the ability to see the ability to see the forest for the trees. You should google this issue to understand more."
"Overall, I'd buy more when I'm in the mood to drink a flavorful beer and one that may impede me pounding several more. You know when you've when on a date and you know she's going to be bitch, and you got to drink but are worried about the drive home."
"O-Overall this beer is just OK. Wasn't too blown away by it. The drinkability saves this one for me."
"O= a very decent West-Coast hops styled IPA. Not sure where the ""Belgian"" enters in. Great for the hop-heads. Nice for an IPA high."
"Overall - I can tell this beer is 8.3% ABV, just wish I could have distinguished a bit more of the complexity I think this style has to offer"
"O: There isnt much in the way of depth to this beer. But it does go down well for a hop head like myself. Alcohol doesnt overwhelm, but i wish it were a little more balanced."
"Drinkability: Fantastic. 1-2 tops though @ 8.3%"
"Not a terrible beer, not even a mediocre beer, just didn't have that true hybrid flavor as the name would have suggested. The beautiful aroma and color of this brew were the highlights. Worth a try, but I'm not going out of my way for it."
"Raging Bitch was amber-orange in color with good clarity. It had a white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was citrus hops with some spice mixed in. The taste was citrus hops upfront with plenty of malt and some peppery spice. The finish was semi-dry with residual hops, pepper, and throat warming alcohol. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and medium carbonation. Overall Raging Bitch is a good beer and worth trying out."
"Really like belguims and Ipas, thought it would be a match made in heaven. Too much asprin in the flavor. The belguim aspects did not come across great. Good beer just not as good as I was hoping from ratings and description. I think the smell was good but it didn't impress after that."
"O: Probably the best belgian style IPA from an American brewery that I've had."
"12oz bottle. Nice pillowy head pour, smells that of an strong IPA but without the entire bitterness bite at the end. Very drinkable, without the big bite at the end so watch out on this one. Very smooth in the mouth. The belgian influence on this IPA makes it very enjoyable. One of my new go to beers."
"O- Overall I felt this was a good BPA that blends the aspects of an IPA well with elements that belgian style beers will offer. In my opinion I'd prefer the american counterparts, but this was good."
"O/D - Definately not to style and not what I would expect for a style I enjoy. I didn't mind it at all but it wasn't what A Belgian IPA typically represents."
"Overall - this is by no means a bad beer and for the money it is and breath of fresh air. However I personally believe that the combination of the two styles represented as the hybrid ""belgian ipa"" is a mistake. Ultimately the subtleties of both styles are lost leaving a confused beer. The marriage of American hops and Belgian yeast strains IMHO has not been accomplished at a note worthy level yet; I hungry await the union."
"O - Overall, this is a good represenatation of the style. The noticeable ABV doesnt really work for me though."
"My very first Belgian IPA. I really enjoy this one."
"O: I enjoy this beer very much and is what I drink if I can't decide on a Belgian or IPA."
"O- This beer was alright but not at all what I was thinking it was going to be. The ABV really stuck out and not always in a good way. A nice try from Flying Dog but I think they missed the mark a little bit. I wish the yeast would have come out more than it did..or lack there of."
"O: Flying Dog's Raging Bitch is a good quality BIPA, and something I'd recommend to someone looking for an American interpretation of the style. Better then expected - thumbs up."
"Mouthfeel is medium body with a pleasant creamy texture to it. Overall, I'm not sure what to make of this beer. While it is certainly a tasty beer to drink, it doesn't quite stand out from a crowded market of Belgianized American ales."
"Overall, I don't really care for Belgian IPAs, but this is one of the better ones I've had."
"quite hoppy for a belgian style ipa. in fact it doesnt remind me too much of a Belgian ipa."
"O: Not a bad brew. A tad bitter for my taste, but drinkable considering the ABV."
"The appearance was nice. The nose was fantastic. And everything that followed went down hill. I would have really liked to see the juicy tropical flavour carried over into the taste as well as a stronger yeast presence. Without either and the mediocre mouthfeel, all that's left is a fairly average beer. It's sad because the brewery this comes from is good and the style is great. This didn't meet my expectations but I'd say it's still worth a try."
"Seemed very similar to Dubbel Cannon at first sip, which I liked, so I liked this one as well. IPA with a twist."
"Poured the 12oz bottle into a snifter glass to find a nice clear, dark orange body with a nice one inch head that left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was dominated by the yeast & hops. The taste was interesting you get the belgian yeast first then the bitter hops. The drinkability is good, its a crisp, clean beer that is easy to drink. The alcohol is masked very welland you would never guess that the ABV is that high. I enjoyed drinking the beer. It was something different but it was enjoyable."
"This beer was a nice treat. Don't think I could down more than two or three in a sitting and that's a good thing. Will definitely purchase this again"
"Opinion: Well, this is one of the more intriguing beers I have had from Flying Dog. It is an unusual mix of a lot of things. That said, it doesn't really do it all very well as the flavors and aromas seem to not really get along all that well. Perhaps if there was a sour component to it as well, that would make it world class, to bring it more on the Saison side of things, which is more like what this beer really is...but stronger than most. This is one of the better beers I have had from Flying Dog, so I wouldn't mind trying it again on draft or something, but this wouldn't be a beer that I would buy regularly...but I bet it would be absolutely excellent mixed with Girardin 1800 Gueuze with about 20-25% gueuze. That dry lemony tart thing would probably really compliment this beer nicely. Either way, this is a pretty good beer."
"It's an IPA variant that doesn't really acheive any significant Belgian content. I'm not sure why people rave over this one. Maybe it's the hop appeal? If you want a derivative IPA then try it."
"I wouldn't call this Bitch ""Raging", but overall not a bad beer. Not my favorite beer in the world, but certainly worth drinking. Plus, it's a good conversation starter to be drinking anything called ""Raging Bitch""!"
"A really nice IPA, well balanced, well hopped."
"O - A huge disappointment for me. The ginger is a real turn off. If ginger and tons of spice is your thing though, give it a shot."
"m/o: very drinkable, a little dry in the finish, but i expect that from an 8.3% beer. all in all not a bad beer, plenty i would prefer over this though."
"Poured from the bottle a bright golden amber with a sticky one finger bright white head. Smell upfront was fruity citrus hops with some bready or buscuity notes from the malt with a touch of that fruity belgian yeast smell. Taste was more than I expected crisp and fruity upfront with hops but softens in a nice buscuity malt with yeast and fruity twangs from the yeast with a crisp finish with a slight hint of the abv coming through as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light and balanced with a good body. Overall I was happy with this purchase haven't been a huge flying dog fan but this beer was crafted very nicely!"
"D - I enjoyed this way more than I'd hoped. Raging Bitch is easily one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had thus far. Great stuff!"
"One of my favorites, probably not a good summer beer but in this crappy Minnesota weather just a couple of these at over 8%abv and you become warm very quickly!"
"Overall - Very good and highly enjoyable. I have yet to be disappointed from a Flying Dog brew as of yet!"
"O: This is a nice beer, but I find the spices a little overpowering."
"Well this was quite a nice introduction to the style in my opinion witbeer Belgian spices with IPA bitterness and hops make for a very refreshing combination. I think I would prefer this over a saison or witbeer in the summer, just so I could get my hop kick. Filtration helped this beer achieve great bold flavor but lacks in the mouthfeel a bit."
"O- This isn't my favorite IPA/DIPA, but it's a good one. It's a local brewery for me too, so I'm glad I tried this one. Very economical for a six pack of this beer. I'll definitely pick it up and enjoy it again."
"Food Pairing: Spicy Foods, Pork, Chicken, Beef, Fish, Green Vegetables, Medium Cheeses (goat cheese, aged chedder), Tofu, Soy Products, Potatoes, Pasta."
"Overall, a bold example of an emerging style. Very good, but not my favorite example of the style. If you like this, try Flying Fish Exit 4 (one of my favorites)."
"Overall the beer is just above average for me."
"Overall: This is a solid beer and well worth picking up. I'm kind of bummed now that I waited this long to try it, as it doesn't disappoint. Great nose, solid flavors, enjoyable mouthfeel, this beer's got just about everything going for it."
"O- Great beer IMO. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great IPA. This is one of the better beers produced by Flying Dog."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and the carbonation is rather aggressive. For me, letting it sit for thirty minutes made it near perfect."
"Poured a nice orangish amber color with a bit of off-white head on it. Smell was full of hops with some citrus notes and yeast as well. Taste was pretty incredible. Very balanced medium bodied beer. Good citrus malt flavor. Not quite as hoppy as I expected. All in all, I loved this beer. The name and label are creative and appealing and the taste really backed it up. Hope to pick this up again soon."
"Orangey. both in color and in flavor. Not like orange life savers, but more of an orange zest kind of flavor. Pretty strong too, so that's a good thing. This was a nice surprise. I actually got it because of the silly name, but I liked it too. So that's a good thing."
"CONCLUSION: A very creative, well-made beer. Although I do agree with another reviewer who felt this was nothing more than an American double/imperial IPA which used Belgian yeast. Do the Belgians really like their beers this hoppy? I kinda doubt it. This is American to the core. I suppose Flying Dog simply used ""Belgian"" in the title for lack of a better word. Regardless, it's interesting and worth trying if you like IPA's or trippels."
"In any event, a pleasant surprise, one in which I won't be caught off guard again. More to come."
"D- Med. When looking for IPA this isn't it. But it's interesting and has great flavor inspired by a belgian style."
"i didn't think this was that strong now that i look at the information. pour is orange clear with a small head that doesn't look belgian at all. its has a carbonation when agitated. its american in feel though. nose of pine bark, yeasty banana hints, and orange. palate is yeasty and sweet with a earthy huskiness. this makes the beer have one dimension and no broadening ester qualities. i don't like the grain used here. not poorly made but somewhat heavy handed ingredients. not as light as a belgian IPA should feel."
"I've had this on tap, from a bottle and from a hand pumped cask. All 3 were great, I think that when it came from the cask it was at it's beat though. This beer is a yellow hazy copper color with a fluffy thick head that won't quit. Te aromas of Belgian yeast are beautifully mixed with citrusy and piney hops. The flavors are a delightfully hoppy experience that dingles your tongue. This beer rocks!"
"Overall: Pretty good beer. The ABVs are pretty hidden in this beer btw."
"DRINKABILITY: This a big beer with a high alcohol content which is very well masked. Watch out that it doesn't sneak up on you after two or three rounds. It's one of the best beers brewed by Flying Dog and a very nice Belgian IPA, though certainly not the ""best of breed."" I'd definitely buy it again and serve it in the right circumstance. My only complaint is that it's slightly overpriced compared to others of this style."
"I recommend trying the beer, but don't be fooled by the supposed style. My personal favorite Belgian IPA is Robot Bastard! from Springhouse Brewery in Conestoga, PA. Good look finding that in bottles though."
"D- Pretty easy to drink given the strong hoppiness and bitterness, but the complexity of the nose doesn't quite carry through to the flavor to bring me back for many more."
"The beer poured Golden with a tan head. The aroma is of Caramel malt and hops. A bit of sweet malt, maybe hints of vanilla in the front with a hop blast in the close. The feel is medium and dry. This is a very pleasant beer, and I would hope they keep it in the lineup."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: While I was interested to try this I didn't think it was all that drinkable. I found myself not looking forward to sipping and probably won't have this beer again. My overall impression is of a beer that was targeted to be a Belgian IPA where the grains worked reasonably well but the hops were way wide of their mark."
"Quite drinkable. My favorite from this brewery so far."
"Pour is fat 3 finger head and luckily used my Duvel tulip. Body is rich glowing amber and very fine looking by IPA standars. Smell is bubble gum spicy with a fruity grapefruit kick. A bit of a solventy alcohol smell but not enough to change my mind that is smells great and very strong. Taste is a very sweet tart grapefruit laced with banana and some earthy notes. Bitterness is there but nicely stays away from the other flavors. Not a big fan of Belgians but I really enjoy this taste. A touch of heat on the throat. Very slick and oily mouthfeel with well rounded carbonation. This is a really good beer. If flying dog could produce more stuff like this and Double Dog they would become very popular."
"Overall not a bad beer. I'm glad I tried it and won't have a problem finishing this one but not sure I would go out of my way to find it."
"-re-reviewed 3/22/11, partly because I forgot that I had already had this, and partly because I know so much more now then I knew then"
"Final thought - At 8.3% and only $7.99 a sixer this beer is well worth it"
"Medium body and carbonation, sticky and a bit dry on the tongue. Drinks really nice, alcohol is masked well, nice flavor although there's a lot going on in the glass."
"O: very good Belgian IPA. Good combination of the Belgian yeast characteristics and hoppiness."
"Highly recomemded, one hell of a beer"
"O. Overall this is a damn good Belgian IPA. Raging Bitch does a very good job of blending 2 styles of beer. The question is whether this is a spicy mellow IPA or a hoppy Begian Pale Ale. Very good none the less."
"Mouth feel is average, could be better. Intense flavor does slow me down a little."
"Clear, copper to amber color. Dense, white head and good retention. Good lacing on the glass. Hop aroma up front - pine resin and floral notes. Some caramel malt as well but the Belgian yeast comes through nice and strong on the back end. Nice spice aroma and again quite floral. A nice mix overall. The flavor has a nice malty sweetness followed by some resinous hop flavor. Could have more hoppiness. Good spiciness from the yeast. Nice balance, good bitterness and a smooth mouthfeel."
"This is an excellent beer, although not belgian nor raging. it's a great blend worthy of another try."
"D- I want to try it on-tap, but I doubt I would have another one after that. The style has so many great representatives that I would have a hard time reaching for one that didn't blow me away."
"Recommended: Nice and tasty, but can creep up on you real quickly."
"D - decent drinkability. I probably wouldn't drink more than one of these at a time just because it's not really my style. but I really enjoyed it as a stand alone. overall a finely crafted brew from my home state."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. great blend of hops and belgian character. delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a bit sweet, some light heat going down. Pretty good, has some cool flavours going on. Thanks Russ!"
"Overall: Not recommended at all. Avoid. Looks deceived me."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is every bit of medium bodied with fine carbonation. Rarely do I say this, but I think this beer is a touch heavy for the style. The finish is also pretty hot. It could definitely drink smoother, and the body could stand to be lighter. Overall, this is a pretty solid beer, and an interesting take on the style. I'd probably go for it again."
"I'm glad I had the chance to give this a go... Not sure I'd grab it again though... There are just too many good offerings out there..."
"Poured a light orange color with good head and sticky web like lacing. Low head retention but has a solid cream floating for a few minutes that fades to a spotty sheet across the top of the beer. The nose grabs you with nice citrusy and floral hops and an almost tangerine orange fruit. Taste is packed with piney bittern g hops that flow nicely into a caramel biscuity malt bill that has a Belgian spicing backfinish. This beer speaks to me what a Belgian IPA should be. Great finish"
"D: Average I'd say, would definitely not have gotten another glass."
"Overall: I like it, but not like crazy. It's drinkable and crisp, but it just doesn't leave me wanting to buy it again."
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid, I have no complaints there. A great beer from Flying Dog - I'm not sure if it's worth the recent across the board price increases though. There's a store by me still pricing their singles at 1.89, so I buy one or two when I'm in there. Worth trying, especially if you're more fond of Belgians than me."
"D: Pretty drinkable, the flavors were nice and they flowed well together from one flavor to the next which is something I either don't notice or don't get a lot of. Decent sized abv rolls it's drinkability back a bit, but still pretty good nonetheless."
"D- This is a very good beer overall and one of the best that flying dog makes. Over the past year or so I have become a HUGE fan of Belgian IPAs-and while this one is good and definately fits to the style it doesn't measure up to a lot of other great examples of the style."
"Slainte!"
"drinkability - lots going on in this beer, there isnt much alcohol taste, it is well masked. there is a good balance, would stock."
"Color is beautiful. Slightly north of golden. Taste is amazing- the hoppiness was controlled with a subtle hand. Smells like most IPAs, nothing to write home about. The drinkability of this beer has reframed my expectations and future rankings- one of the best I've had."
"This may be my favorite beer yet, and one that I absolutely am going to have to have a constant supply of. It eludes categorization. Thus, it's not a one trick pony, and may very easily appeal even to those who don't exactly love IPAs. I wouldn't even hesitate to recommend to honestly anyone with any sort of palate for beer."
"D - A very drinkable beer, and one that I could enjoy a few bottles of in a night. However, the bite from the hops is a bit more palate wrecking than the IBU rating leads on."
"On the whole, this is a pretty nice, drinkable beer. A bit unbalanced, and perhaps over the top on hop bitterness at the expense of other elements that have helped to make this a popular style, but a nice, quaffable beer."
"Drinkability: A delightful beer and a true exemplar of an emerging style. To be honest, I didn't have the best opinion of Flying Dog before this beer; I found most of their line-up to be severely disappointing. However, this beer nearly (if not completely) makes up for it. It is a complex and interesting beer from a style that I can't wait to try more of. It is a true marriage of brewing cultures and one that no one should miss..."
"Having not tried a Belgian IPA before, I like the fusion of the fruity esters and the strong citrusy IPA qualities. The color is wonderful but the head retention and aftertaste could be improved."
"M & D - Smooth. 8.3% ABV is nicely hidden and I would certainly grab another."
"D: These are buzz inducing at 8.3% abv. Pretty smooth IPA that I would be able to keep drinking without quick palate fatigue."
"A solid over-the-top American IPA. Plenty of white fluffy head over a hazy old gold with a trace of orange. Aroma of citrusy hops and toasted malt, flavor is true to the aroma, but transitions toward a more piney, resinous hop flavor and a sweeter malt that keep each other in check. If you're paying attention, the light fruity yeast notes can be found, but they really are not up to do battle with the hops for your taste bud's attention. SWMBO says ""the hops kinda overpower everything, but that's not a bad thing."" Indeed."
"Conclusion: 2/2011 is simply too late for this one."
"This was my first ever beer on cask and I absolutely loved it. The fact that it wasn't cold took a bit of getting used to but by its end this turned out to be one of the best beers I've had. I'm not sure how much of a difference the cask makes but regardless I plan on ordering a few more of these."
"Poured out a dark bronze color that's very clear with light reddish hues, plenty of carbonation and a thick frothy head light tan head, and yes plenty of carbonation! It has some really good lacing and a dry sweet hoppy aroma with hints of banana bread. Its light and semi crisp on the tip of the tongue, slightly tart on the edges of the mouth and warm and hoppy as you swallow. It has a dry feeling over all and has a light-medium mouthfeel."
"Overall I have said this is my favorite FD beer, and having it from the hand pump makes further supports this. I think I may like it a bit more from CO2 because the bitterness shows a bit more, but this version was nothing short of kick ass too. Well done."
"Drink - So many tastes going on with this beer, my mouth didn't know what was going on. It's a really interesting fusion taste that was nice for a change from the norm. I'm not sure I could drink more than one of these every now and then, but I'm happy I tried it."
"From hereon is the biggest disappointment of the year. I couldn't believe the first sip - I asked myself a simple question - where is the Belgium in this Belgian Style IPA ?? This simply tasted like an IPA and that's it. Overly hopped for the style, faint maltiness that gets lost without a hint of the famed Belgian yeast aroma or flavour. Indeed disappointing. I didn't really care from here on. I am really upset with Flying Dog as I can't figure out really why is there so much variation in the outcome of their products."
"I'm not sure if it was because of it being cask conditioned but this beer wasn't nearly hoppy enough. I would like to try this in bottle form to compare."
"Appearance is golden with a murky touch and a good sized off-white head. RB`s smell has banana, hops, some grass. Taste contained more of the citrus element, small amount of yeast, and yes, hops and bitterness in the finish. MF was medium and kind of creamy. Drinkability is good in this Belgian IPA and the abv sneaks up on you. This was probably the 3rd time that I have picked this up and it always satisfies."
"A very interesting beer, lots of spice character in both the smell and taste, and definitely more citrus hop flavor than your usual Belgian style beer. I'll have to try some others from this style."
"Notes: Excellent beer with intense flavors that for me epitomize the ideal convergence of Belgian and IPA characters through the use of spicy, herbal hops. A little too bitter though."
"This pours transparent amber with two fingers of head. The taste seems lagered (it almost has German features), but that could be the appearance suggesting that. I smell a lot of sweetness, more specifically, brown sugar. It does have the typical Belgium flavors...yeast and other crap that I could do without. For being an 8.3%, the tastes hides the strength pretty well, but this wasn't the first beer of the night either. It is very sweet, but has a nice hop presence. I am curious to know what this beer tastes like on a fresh pallet; time may tell. Hey! It's 8.3%, What?!"
"The color when poured was reddish amber, with not a lot of foam, but, did have some lace on the side of the glass. The smell of mild hops and spice was evident upon the first sniff of this Belgium ale. The taste was of bitter mild hops, malts, with cloves and hints of all spice and yeast. Not overly bitter as to kill the balance flavor of all the component that make up this ale. A pleasant surprise and a happy smile!"
"Pours a clear, dark golden amber with a finger off white foamy head. Nose is fruity, hoppy, Belgian yeast, caramel. Taste is bitter upfront with a clear malt profile on the palatte. A Belgian spicyness is ever present. Medium bodied. High ABV limits drinkability somewhat. I'll have to revisit this beer one day."
"A very clear golden brown with an almost red hue to and a small head. The aroma has a nice fruitiness to it and that distinct Belgian yeast character. A pleasurable and very nice aroma. The hops mix very well with the yeast. The taste is again fruity at first then the yeast contributes banana, pepper, and other spice that I can't finger. The yeast also seems to add bitterness along with the hops. You know I was real surprised with this one and kind of changed my opinion of Flying Dog."
"Overall, I probably won't be buying this again, glad I bought a single! Not bad but nothing amazing here."
"Having grown up on Belgian Pale Ale's I don't quite see where this would fit in that style. A US West Coast IPA this is imho and a very good one. The best is that I can get this fresh and for a reasonable price on my end of the pond. Will make get on my bike to buy a few fresh one's whenever I can."
"Drinkability: This brew need more hop character and also needs be dry hoped. This beer is more of a mediocre triple than a Belgian IPA. 2.5"
"D= way too drinkable..8.3% ABV.."
"D: drank good and was surprised on the flavor the second time around."
"Really good hoopy IPA. Very enjoyable any time of the year."
"Alcohol does make its presence felt, warms the inside big time with each sip. Unique brew, which surprisingly is highly drinkable, in spite of the high ABV. It's best to drink this one with caution."
"This is an interesting beer, it'll throw your taste buds around and possibly your eyes cross. One note, it's does a minimal job of hiding the alcohol."
"This beer is very drinkable. Belgian fans and hopheads alike can easily enjoy this beer, and I personally really like it. Flying Dog did a great job with this mashup."
"Drink ability is easy drinking. The body feels good and the taste is very unique. I can have another one of these no problem. Three may be too much, though. I bet this would taste awesome ontap."
"Good Dog!"
"Curtain of lace dresses the glass; very clear amber color. Hints of bubble gum, ripe tropical fruit and medicinal herbs from the yeast with clementines coming from the hops. Smooth and creamy with a hefty medium body. Lots of bready malt, a bit toasted. Hops grab a hold of the palate and slap it around some, almost to the point it missed the Belgian aspects that the yeast had tried to lay out. Trace phenols are soon chased away from the fruity warming alcohol. Bitter finish has a faint aspirin flavor. Belgian style? Perhaps just inspired 'cause of the popular- ity of the style? Good but too clean and overly bitter. The raw marketing does not match what is inside."
"Overall: By far my favorite from Flying Dog. They nailed it on this one. Definitely a keeper and repeater. One of the most well-balanced beer I've had in a very long time..."
"D - could take out all 6 if I didn't have places to be. huzzah!"
"Last stop on my Boston trip was at Bukowski's. Had this from the bottle, really beautiful red color to the beer. Thin head around the sides though. Aromas were packed with malts and citrus flavors, but definitely prominent with the hops. A solid bittersweet taste for me with a dry, citrus flavor mixed with hops. Crisp body and very clean. Really enjoyed sipping this one throughout the night."
"while this wont be my last Flying Dog brew it will be my last Raging Bitch!"
"Good drinkability with the alcohol dececption, but might be a bit cloying half way through a pour."
"D - I find this dangerously drinkable, considering high ABV."
"A very good belgian ipa. Golden in the glass. Smells of belgian yeast and esters. A hop note is also there. The taste starts with hoppy goodness develops into a something like a golden belgian and finishes dry and bitter. The carbonation is just right for all of the developing flavors. This is a very drinkable beer that you have to be careful sipping. A true marriage of two excellent beer styles resulting in a wonderful result."
"I didn't know what to expect, but man this is a fine brew."
"DB - Alcohol very well hidden, easily could have too many of these."
"D- I find this a tab bitter to be considered a Belgian style IPA. Overall a good beer that should be experienced at least once, maybe on tap. This six pack won't go to waste."
"Poured from a bottle out of a six pack I picked up at the beer store yesterday. The beer pours a pale copper coloring with no head. The nose is very hop heavy, and it seems like there is a hint of coriander or some other spice deep down below the hops. The sharpness of the beer hits your tongue before the taste does. The taste follows up nicely with a bold blend of spice and malt riding a wave of sour hops. The beer, for all its grandness early in mouth, slips quickly off to a quiet and smooth finish. Spice flavors in the aftertaste, also. Decent beer, but I have had better. I would be interested to try this on-tap or from a cask to get a different perspective on it."
"D - Yes. If you are an IPA person this is a nice example."
"overall, this is a pretty decent beer, I like it"
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Appearance is nothing really to write home about, but it does have a deep rich look. Nose has a great range of grains, nicely combined with some sweet and savory spice notes. Flavor is grainy, with a little spice. A nice light body, and dry finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall this beer skewed slightly too far toward the IPA side for a Belgian IPA as the bitterness was a bit too strong. Still, it's a very good beer that's worth a shot."
"Good beer. Has a sweet hops flavor, mixed with the traditional Belgian crisp drinkability & wheat flavor. Very good head. It doesn't taste like it's got a lot of alcohol in it like a lot of imperial IPA's. I drank it paired with a Greek salad and some noodles with butter."
"Very good, an interesting new style for me. Though I prefer hoppier, this is a nice change. Will have again sometime."
"Great beer, good in bottle, better on tap. Seemed to be a bit more rounded than in bottle."
"Ehhh...."
"D: Nope. That is all."
"D - Very drinkable for the alcohol content, however the overall bitterness hampers drinkability for me."
"At my local retailer, all of the Flying Dogs are marked the same. So for more flavor (and higher ABV), definitely a good buy!"
"This beer pours a clear orange color with amber hues. The head is one inch of fluffy foam that recedes slowly into sticky lacing. The aroma is of moderate funk, earth, horse blanket, and a lot of citrusy hops. The taste is similar to the aroma, with a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a good beer, and one of the better Belgian style IPA's I've tasted. I like how the hops don't overpower the Belgian qualities of this beer."
"Recommended..."
"D-mmm this was good and the after-taste stays and the high ABV is not apparent at all. i won't mind having this again. and again. this is a finely brewed beer and it redefined what i thought a beligian IPA was capable of."
"Drinkability - I would come back to this beer, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes anything from St. Lupulin to Gulden Draak"
"Raging Bitch is an appropriate name for a beer that is comprised of a rabid yeast, seething alcohol and merciless hops. And doubly so because I'm now enraged by the fact that the brewery doesn't sell it in bombers! The fact that I had to settle for a 12 ounce bottle has me seeing red! And also definitely seeing a full six pack in my future purchases."
"D: I enjoyed the 16 oz. brew that I had, but if I had ordered another beer, I would have changed things up a bit. Too much pine for one sitting."
"In my experience, this is Flying Dogs best, but it could be said that their Gonzo is either a close second or just as good."
"Drinkability is very good. Really enjoying this one, nice hoppy beer that isn't too much of a good thing."
"Their 20th anniversary beer, and an absolute steal at the price my local specialty store is selling it for. I will definitely grab more before it's gone."
"8.3% is well hidden, and as such drinkability isn't bad."
"Drinkability is wonderful as with all IPA's watch yourself because of the higher than ""normal"" ABV. Overall this hands down one of my favorite brews."
"If I find this again on tap (found it down it Baltimore at Pickles during Baltimore Beer Week), I'd definitely go for it. Would most definitely buy another case to mix up my regular rotation."
"O: Like some Belgian brews, and many ""Belgian style"" brews, I find this beer a bit too spicy."
"D- Definitely very drinkable, refreshing yet satisfying for all the hop heads out there. Best of both worlds if your a fan of Belgians and IPA's , a perfect harmonious balance between the two. Wish I could find this on the shelf more often, definitely my favorite American spin on a Belgian!!"
"D- This is a very smooth and supremely drinkable beer. Nothing is overly exaggerated making the final product a huge but balanced and delicious beer."
"D - The drinkability of this is really good. It is a very crisp and clean IPA. It is very very easy to drink. This is a great go-to IPA. I'm glad I finally decided to pick it up. I recommend trying this to those who haven't. I don't think you will be disappointed."
"Still, a very good beer that is changing some of the notions I have about Flying Dog (in a good way)."
"I would try it again."
"For being an IPA it is wonderfully easy to drink, but still has enough hops punch that you won't be disappointed. I don't know who thought of the Belgian IPA style, but the Belgian malt combined with American hops is just such a perfect balance of opposites."
"The aroma from this beer is amazing. The hop/fruit combination jumps out at you and smells as if you were actually in the brewery itself. The taste is very complex. Some alcohol burn in the aftertaste but surprisingly little hop bitterness which is more prevalent in the other Flying Dog varieties. This beer will kick you in the rear quickly and the flavors are so ""over the top"" so its tough to drink more than 1 or 2 in a sitting. I definitely recommend trying this brew. Its not the easiest drinker but it will draw you in lure you to crave its flavors on another day."
"Well done guys , as always :-) Never tried to pair this with food, I have some cheesy ideas but I really like to drink this one in relax listening to some good music."
"Overall a solid example of the style and, actually, it could be argued, one of the only Belgian IPAs to get American-sized hoppiness."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer and I will stock it in my cellar for a future sampling."
"D - Quite drinkable and a particularly interesting mixture of styles. I don't typically like Belgians, but the strength of the IPA flavor brings a nice balance."
"Too flowery... Just can't see myself reaching for this again. I like the idea of BIPA, perhaps this just isn't the one for me..."
"Drinkability is quite nice, abv is well hidden."
"D - I like this a little more than the 12 ounce bottled version, drinkability is a touch higher."
"This is just an ok Belgian IPA for me. It was decent enough, but nothing really stood out. The flavors didn't pop, and the Belgian yeast didn't add enough character to make it interesting. Perhaps it was past its prime; had I been able to decipher the date code on the bottle (or what I believe to be the code) I may have known that. Not bad, but I probably won't be revisiting it."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours an orangish-golden color. There was a small off white head on it that doesn't linger long. Nice big hop nose. Pine, citrus and maybe even a touch of pineapple mixed together. Smells like some Belgian spices and breadiness in there also. The taste is good. There is a nice hop bite to the beer (mainly citrus), with a decent malt body behind it. Get some of the Belgian notes in the peppery spices and a touch of breadiness to it."
"Raging Bitch pours a hazy, copper color with a good 2 fingers of head that leaves lots of sticky lacing on my pint glass. You can smell the Belgian yeast, but the citrus hop aromas are what stand out the most...smells really fresh. Lots of hops upfront in the taste, both citrus and earthy, which is accompanied well with that familiar Belgian yeast and sweet malts - balances out nicely. Medium bodied, good carbonation level, and easy drinking for its ABV."
"The body seems light and soft but has plenty of heft. The chalky feel gets more dry through the finish, and the light nature of the Belgian yeast makes this IPA exceptionally drinkable. Interesting fusion going on, give it a try."
"3/11: was a good value at 7.49-7.99 a 6-pack, but the drastic increase to $12-14 is completely ridiculous. will not be buying again."
"Poured with a light white head that forms a thick white cap that leaves behind lots of sticky lacings. Yellowish copper in color with a moderate haze. Yeasty aroma at first that with hints of sweet malt, honey, spice and orange citrus. Medium bodied and creamy feel with ample carbonation. Belgian ale flavors in the beginning, sweet and yeasty, with a spicy middle, orange hoppy ending and a hoppy pine aftertaste that doesn't linger for too long. The complex flavors nicely hide the higher ABV which makes this very drinkable."
"D- The ABV is well hidden which makes this brew very drinkable. Also a good mix of styles makes this one special"
"Drinkability - Very nice brew! Good-tasting and intriguing."
"D= I really liked this beer would try it again I don't think I could drink more than a few but it is a nice beer."
"A Belgian-Style IPA, it's just as rowdy and provocative in execution as it is by title. I really dig how this brewery names all of their beers in a doggy spirit without holding back on the bite...clever and attention grabbing. Appearing a clear burnt orange with copper highlights, the Raging Bitch held a respectable sandy head that gradually faded to sticky sheets of lace. The nose came across as a bright orange peel citrus combined with a light lemon zest making the aroma quite crisp and bitter. There is also quite a bit of Belgian yeast, as there should be, and in the end, the nose is really pleasing. Leading straight into the flavor, there are a lot of hops (Warrior, Columbus, and Amarillo - holy goodness) that make up a large, fantastic bitter bite. The orange is still quite present as a quick zest in the spicy carbonation and medium mouthfeel, though I found myself searching for the yeast after a while. Regardless, this is one Bitch that is definitely raging."
"At first it smells like that clove/spice Belgian yeast smell. Then when you give it a swirl you really get that citrus almost pine like smell which all together smells like a forest. The taste is even better with that Belgain yeast taste at the beginning reminiscent of Dogfish Head's Raison Detre but then sweet in the middle and the citrus hop bitterness on the back. Normally I'm not really a fan of the Belgian style because all you really taste is the fruity clove like yeast that dominates all the other flavors. Where this has that taste but mixed in real nicely with my favorite American IPA taste. This beer actually makes me like Belgian beers more just like the Raison Detre made me like it better because of that added sweet roast malt with the raisons. It has a nice candy malt sweetness to it as well that mixes in with all the flavors perfectly. The mouthfeel is awesome too because it has that thicker rich like malt taste that you'd get in well crafted higher alcohol beers. Definitely worth the price especially because your getting a 6 pack of a higher alcohol beer. Also, the alcohol is very well hidden. All in all my favorite Belgian beer I've ever head and that's mostly because of the subtle but well mixed Belgian yeast taste with those awesome citrus American hops."
"Hey, this is an interestingly complex beer, that I really enjoyed and would highly recommend."
"Overall this isn't a bad beer and if you really like ipa style then you will really enjoy this one"
"I have to say that I am really surprised by how good of a beer this is. I just may have to stock some of this.. I love that it's available in 12oz bottles."
"The mouthfeel was full and rounded. Right on carbonation."
"It works. It is a beer that I could drink regularly."
"Pours from the 12 oz bottle an orangish-coppery color with a substantial slightly off-white head. Carbonation is light and soft, only a few bubbles rising in the glass. Aroma is quite sweet & fruity, must be the influence of the Belgian yeast. Not quite what one would expect from an IPA. 1st sip brings a potent, resiny piney blast of hops that is a 180 degree u-turn from the aroma. There is a slight hint of dry fruitiness on the swallow but it is quickly subdued by those hops. The alcohol makes it's presence know as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sparkly! The drinkability is good, although this doesn't quite qualify as a session beer, IMHO. Overall, a very nice melding of styles! It wouldn't surprise me to see more brewers try their hand at their own version of a Belgian IPA soon."
"A good drink for sure. Strong but very balanced. I liked this quite a lot. Probably couldn't drink more than two in a night; I'd buy this again as part of a mixed 6-pack."
"I really liked this beer, and I like Belgian IPA's more and more the more I experience the style. Strength and a highly hoppy taste mars the drinkability a bit. But still, a very good beer from Flying Dog."
"The body is a burnished amber, clear and bright, filtered to death for a Belgian IPA. Smells like bubblegum, Pepto-Bismol, sweet pale malt, grandma's spice rack and perhaps a touch of fruity hops. The palate has a stronger hop presence, juicy and tropical with grapefruit undertones. Whatever yeast strain they're using for this beer is awful, it's heavy on the bubblegum and medicinal flavors, while finishing with a phenolic kick that almost overwhelms the bittering hops. This isn't outright awful, but it's not great; it's hard for me to get past the cloying yeast profile."
"i fairly enjoyed it would have again but not my favorite"
"Drink- A good marriage here and I am sure that over time I will come to appreciate the mixture and blending of styles. Until then, I am sure my rating is fair based upon that."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is of hops, somewhat sweet, a bit of yeast, not overpoweringly bitter. Feels medium bodied and bitter in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good brew."
"All around good beer. My 1st belgian IPA and to me, its something new. Who would of thought this would work and be so good! I'm looking forward to other variations of the style."
"D. This is a great beer thats blurs the lines between a great Belgian ale and an American IPA. I think there is a place for this beer in my fridge anytime. I will drink this any day."
"D: Would drink this just about any time. Really liked this one just as an end to the day. Great by itself and worth a try. Once again love the hop characters here that really make this beer stand out!"
"States remotley the same, nice hoppy front with a punch of yeast towards the end. First Belgian Style I've ever had to be honest."
"Served @ 41.6 degrees straight from the wine cooler. Looked great smelled good with rich pungent aroma of hops. Sweet flavor but comes on strong with the hops with a semi- bitter finish. Overall, decent beer, a litle hard to find but it is hard to drink."
"Really, I don't mind a sweet Triple, but a sweet IPA? My mouth didn't know what to make of tasting it against other pure IPAs. Mostly, I'm a Flying Dog fan and I'm a 8+ ABV fan. Why didn't this beer work? It was too much effort to enjoy. I'll stick with either a Belgian or an IPA. This marriage is, as they say, a bitch."
"This is an instant classic for me. Top 10 ever, possibly top 5. TRY THIS!"
"Pours a moderate golden color with quite a bit of haze and a nice white head along with oodles of sticky lacing. The nose brings some fresh Belgian yeast with a bit of white pepper and spice. Strong floral hops mix in well. The taste is a bit spicy with mild fruit and a decent amount of bitterness, though not too much. Feel is a medium body with good carbonation. Drinks quite well and is a really nice example of the style."
"I'll admit that I initially scoffed at the idea of a ""Belgian-style IPA"" (i.e. ""WTH kind of marketing ploy is this?""), thinking that it was just an excuse to put the ""Belgian"" label on something and up the alcohol content. While I'm still not sure if I'm convinced that this is a completely unique sub style, I AM convinced of its deliciousness. I'd hate to call myself a ""hop head", but this beer certainly satisfies my (probably too substantial) hop cravings. Though I was probably too mesmerized by the hops to notice many other flavors, I still find this beer to be remarkably comprehensive in taste. It is well-hopped without being too bitter to displease or exclude the other ingredients. Its high ABV is very well hidden, and therefore makes it very sessionable- provided the session doesn't last too long! For any fan of IPAs, I highly suggest this beer."
"It also packs quite a punch, so much so that the alcohol is the reason why I couldn't down more than one or two in a sitting. I'm confident that there are other beers that are at the forefront of this style but to say that this took me by surprise is an understatement. To warm up on a nice fall night, I'm gonna grab another one of these again and enjoy the marriage between the citrus and plum like flavors that this beer has wonderfully enjoined. Without a doubt one of the best new brews of the year!"
"D - Very refreshing."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. It may be a bit bitter for some, but I enjoyed it. Recommended for the hopheads out there."
"Wow. I wasn't expecting this at all, but in a very good way. The smell is over the top hops. I started getting really excited after smelling this beer. It pours a nice copperish brown color with a tight compact head. So the first taste is absolute IPA heaven. Heavy grapefruit, pine and spice flavors. The malt backbone supports the hops perfectly but still stays behind the scene. If you gave me this and I didn't know what it was I would just say it was a fabulous American IPA. Though at 8.3% its a little high for a typical IPA. I don't taste the alcohol though. Give this one a shot, it is excellent."
"D: Extremely high. Light, tastes great, can't go wrong here."
"Overall: I might be biased, because I'm not crazy about the style, but this one didn't blow me away. Its a good beer, no doubt, but it just seemed like the flavours were fighting for the spotlight instead of mixing. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but I certainly wouldn't pass it up either."
"I don't see what makes this a Belgian IPA. It is American through and through. It is very enjoyable however. What ever it is called, this is an excellent beer that is well balanced and nuanced. Highly recommended."
"I am usually not a big fan of the Belgian IPAs. The Belgian spice and strong hops don't always work. But this does."
"Overall: I've been wanting to try this one for while but didn't want a whole sixer. Finally found it as a single and jumped on it. I'm still not completely sold on the style. I mean it's not bad beer but it's nothing earth shattering."
"An emerging style for sure. I just wish there was a little more Belgian in this one."
"I also must mention that this is the first Flying Dog beer that I've considered worth repeating."
"Mouthfeel seems more like a much smaller beer, and the well-hidden heat seems to confirm that this is much lower in alcohol content. Finishes nicely, albeit aggressively, with the high carbonation pulling the hotter flavors away from the palate. Well done and in the upper echelon of the style, though not quite elite."
"Listed by the brewer as an American style IPA with the add of Belgian yeast. Pours beautifully, great, deep amber color with an full pale head. Great lacing. Aroma is yeasty and hoppy. Taste is wonderful, slight malt flavor, a little yeast, and a lot of hops. Nice dry crisp finish. Flavor holds up as a really nice from beginning to end. Very drinkable. Lives up to the hopped-up ""American-style IPA"" expectation."
"Too harsh to be very interesting, and not really the balance and complexity that this style should be about."
"I wish Belgian IPA was an official style! This beer is amazingly drinkable. Even though it is high in alcohol it doesnt have that alcohol burn to it. Its amazing how simple the malt bill is on this beer and yet how complex the flavor is thanks to the 'El Diablo' yeast. I think the hops that the brewer used in this beer pair very well with each other, has a nice American IPA citrus flavor and aroma to it. Awesome beer Flying Dog!"
"Don't go into this beer expecting to be blown away. The aroma is a great mix of the fruity Belgium yeast, American hops, slightly sweetened from the malt and perhaps at of spice. Apart from that you're looking at an above average beer, priced EXTREMELY well."
"D - It's good I like it worth having and worth giving it a try."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, grapefuity hops and quite citrusy. In the taste, grapefruit to orange citrus hops and a nice dry Belgian like yeast presence. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry citrus in the aftertaste. More a double/ imperial IPA than Belgian, love it though."
"Fairly easy drinker but the high abv holds it back a bit."
"After having this at BWW on tap I had to get myself a six pack. This is really a great take on a belgian IPA at a great price point. Pours a cherry amber with 3 finger white head. Moderate amount of lacing. Aroma is banana, bread-y yeast and pineapple-y, pine-y hops. I really love all the smells going on here. Taste doesn't fully translate though. On tap it was a bit better taste wise, but there's still some good IPA flavors. Plenty of bitterness on the back end balance out the sweetness up front. Mouthfeel is good not much to write home about."
"Drinkability- This beer is a fantastic drink. Its sweet, smooth flavor is complimented by the great feel of this beer to create a taste that I would love to purchase again."
"Big, buttery, smooth mouthfeel. Way too drinkable at over 8%. And totally worthy of representing Flying Dog's 20th anniversary. Imagine what they'll create for their 40th?!"
"Copper colored with a finger of head. Leaves little lacing. The smell is hoppy with a definitive alcohol overtone-that I can't say I prefer-and yeast. Fortunately the taste is much better with milder hops than I'm used to in American IPAs, but very tasty. I read they use American hops, and perhaps they are just very nicely balanced with more pale malts then I'm used to. Or perhaps they use the candied sugars often used in Belgian ales to increase the sweetness. The yeast taste Belgian and really just makes everything alright with me. When cold the alcohol is less noticeable, but as it warms the alcohol becomes more obvious. I like high gravity beers, but I prefer the alcohol to be more hidden, but that's a minor complaint that I feel a little awkward even mentioning. The alcohol is more pronounced in the smell than on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium or even a little beyondwith low carbonation leaving it a very drinkable beer. I will buy this again for sure."
"Drinkability: For all its apparent bitterness, this beer could easily qualify as a session'er -- at 8.3% ABV, a short session it would be!"
"D: I'm loving this beer. BIPAs are my favorite style and subtlety is my preference. This one doesn't disappoint. Everything you could want from an IPA and a Belgian is there, blended together in perfect harmony here. I will definitely be getting another sixer of these soon."
"Overall a killer beer. Would definitely have one again when i get the chance. Not a beer you want to start a night of drinking on but a great one for a tasting."
"D= I enjoy this guy. Not my fav style but this is a decent rendition of it. Nice unique mix of flavors for those who get bored of hop bombs but don't wanna venture too far. A tasty treat."
"D. This beer merges my two favorite styles and does a fabulous job at it. I could drink these all day long."
"A great Belgian-style beer! Just experienced Stone Vertical Epic 10 and to be honest reminds me a lot of it's taste. (Belgian Influence) Smells of grapes, pears, bananas, and apples! Love it, too bad it's just an anniversary ale. Good Job Flying Dog!"
"As much as I enjoy Piraat, I was expecting more from this. A good beer, but perhaps a bit too hoppy for my taste. I find IPAs are hit or miss with me."
"D - This one is scary drinkable at it's ABV. I feel like I could handle a sixer in one night, but it'd also probably put me on my ass before I knew it."
"Verdict: Raging Bitch is a solid Belgian IPA and a worthy tribute to 20 years of Flying Dog. It's deceptively drinkable, unique, and enjoyable throughout. One of the best beers from this brewery, I'd love to see Raging Bitch make the crossover to yearly visitor."
"Sweet citrus up front followed by piney hop bitterness - finnishing with grapefruit. It has a candied sweetness in the back and some sweet orange. This beer really wrecks your palate and your mouth loves every minute of it."
"The mouthfeel of this offering is quite pleasant along with the other components of the beer. There is a smoothness to this beer that is carried thanks in part to the malty parts of the beer. A bit more carbonation would ideally be present in this beer and if there was that added bit of carbonation that appears to be missing this beer would be just all that much better."
"D - great drinkability for an 8.3% abv, deceptive even."
"D Fair to good. This is a rather big beer so I would have only one or two. 3.5"
"It is very drinkable, and overall it is a great beer and a great value. It was only 9 bucks for a six pack. I will drink this regularly."
"Aroma is - WOO WEE STRONG, seriously hoppy with a strong citrus tone that is a mixture of good grapefruit and sweet orange. It pours a nice clear orange amber with an average pale tan head that leaves minimal lacing. Flavor is quite hoppy, with a good evergreen tone, minimal bitterness, and an undertone of grapefruit with just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is rough and edgy, leaving behind a fair tingle."
"Considering my bellow average review, I'm thinking I maybe got a bad batch."
"Overall, a very solid beer. I haven't had a Flying Dog beer in quite some time but thought it was time to give them another go. Definitely worth a go! Cheers."
"d- a very enjoyable beer, kind of a new taste to me, highly recommended"
"Mouthfeel is medium full bodied, bitey, bitter, sweet, pungent, and sticky."
"D - Great beer here and the 8.3 ABV is practically undetectable! Enjoy with caution!"
"Impression: Not a huge fan of FD but this one is quite tasty."
"I had high expectations for this beer going into it. It just tasted too creamy for my taste. I got a lot of caramel and not much else. It was nice and smooth, with very little hops; but it just did not wow me like other Flying Dog beers. I think it has potential, might just need to open up a little bit."
"This one poured light and auburn in color with an off white head that quickly dissipated. It definitely smelled more like a Belgian than an IPA. It had good yeasty aromas with some light maltiness. It didn't feature hoppiness or alcohol at all. The taste was excellent. Again it was heavier on the Belgian side. It featured a good mix of breadiness with sugars and some light alcohol on the backend. The mouthfeel was light, crisp, and well carbonated. I really liked this one and I found it more drinkable than a lot of other Belgian IPAs. This one certainly is closer to a Belgian than an IPA."
"D: This is a extremely drinkable, brew. Light on the palate and non-filling. I have kicked through most of the bottle just going back to gain a new light on the complexity of flavors."
"A tasty take on a Belgian IPA. Good hop profile pairing with yeast. Worth trying."
"Raging Bitch pours a deep amber color without much of a head. The hoppy bite is apparent from both the nose and from the first sip. However, the hoppiness does wear off as the drink goes on and the flavor goes from biting to smooth, yet strong. Even though hoppy beers are not ""my thing"" this is still a very solid and great beer and have no complaints. Try it if you can!"
"The alcohol comes through more than the hops in this one."
"This is a fairly good brew, but maybe an acquired taste. It is certainly a great example of Flying Dog's ingenuity and great to celebrate 20 years."
"[ serving type: Chilled bottle poured into a glass]"
"All in all not a bad job flying dog."
"Hops=happiness"
"I wasn;t sure about the hoppiness at first but a few sips in I realized it wan't as overpowering as I thought. The 8% alcohol was apparent as I caught a buzz a few sips into the second bottle and just as I realized what a good taste this had. Just hard to drink in mixed coed company with a name like raging bitch. Not many know the dog reference."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Raging Bitch is a clear, copper-orange color (almost like apple juice) with a one-finger, soapy white head. The nose has some spicy, peppery characteristics as well as some piney, citrusy west coast hops. The flavor follows suit, with the Belgian characteristics being more reserved and the west coast IPA flavors being dominant; fruitiness like apricot and grapefruit along with resinous pine make up most of the palate. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall a pretty drinkable beer, would like to see more ""Belgian"" in the flavor but certainly not a bad attempt."
"D - I didn't really expect the flavors to work with this beer but it really does. Very balanced, the alcohol becomes more apparent as the beer warms but nothing over the top. I'd drink a glass of it, maybe two but that's about it because the alcoholic flavors would get to me a bit. A very good beer and well worth a try. I might pick this one up again sometime. Cheers!"
"Despite it's ABV, it's pretty darn drinkable for what it is. I'm liking this a lot. Well done beer."
"D: A little too much spice to drink much of - but a good beer and interesting style nonetheless."
"Nice job and I love the name!"
"Pours with a deep, rich golden/amber color with a surprisingly small amount of head for the style unless I just did a crappy job pouring it. Not a very big hop presence in the aroma, but I do detect hints of vanilla and peach. The peach comes through in the flavor as well instead of a citrusy hop character. The finish is extremely smooth for an IPA. A really great example of the style in my opinion!"
"D- very, although the abv is high went by pretty much unnoticed"
"This is a very good BIPA. Full of hop character wiht a malt body and yeast profile right out of Belgium. A very cloudy burnt orange with a yellowish off white head. A good size head and considerable lacing. Smell is a rich pale malt and Belgian yeast. Some funk and a piney hops with a banana tinged fruitiness. Taste is Bam Bam hoppy with a grapefruit and pine right away followed by an oily hop leafyness. Then you get a tripel like malt backbone and a return to grapefruit with caramel sweetness. Some more of that faint banana. Finish is very dry and clean with an astringent touch of hop oil lingering. No trace of alcohol anywhere. Feel is crisp and effervescent with an almost cream like quality. This is a real sneaky one to drink as it goes down like a milder mannered IPA with all the smooth complexity of a Belgian ales. A real gem of a beer and one I plan to keep on hand."
"Raging Bitch is quite an enjoyable beer, better than usual from Flying Dog, and once again shows (like Gonzo) that these guys can really put out a solid drink when they want to. I'd love it if they made this a seasonal. One of the better Belgian IPAs I've encountered, and worth the trip to track it down."
"All in all, this is a good brew. Not great, but worth trying. Definitely suits a Belgian IPA category."
"D- a nice brew, highly hopped is it's claim to fame. the belgian side of this bitch is very subtle, and i would like to get to know that side better. all the assertive bitterness seems to mask the yeast. decently drinkable for a high abv beer but i'm not sure i would call her MY bitch, just THAT bitch."
"D: It's not much of a Belgian or much of an IPA, but it has enough of both to make it worthwhile."
"Very drinkable, perhaps too much so; at 8.3%, you taste none of the alcohol."
"D: You don't feel the alcohol but it doesn't mean it isn't there. This is a really really good beer and if I wasn't driving, I'd defiantly have a few of these."
"Drinkability: Great"
"D- Can I just leave it at great? No? Doesn't hop me out after one and this is my second attempt at the bitch. She is quite the partner for an evening and I'd love to tempt her company once more."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkabilty - A different beer, A nice change from a hop driven ipa, or a standard tripel. Not sure i would drink a whole 6-pack but i enjoyed this one for sure"
"This one trends more into the Belgian realm than many of these newfangled American brewed belgio-IPAs. Yeast first, hops second...I like that. Both are assertive though and are draped with a caramel, toffee malt backdrop that I could probably do without. Almost too much going on here with the beastly malt, does not seem to have a focal point. Throw alcohol up in there and you got a four-headed bitch on your hands...Kerberos, watch out! Rough around the edges, but this dog is ultimately petable when all is said and done."
"Pours very foamy head on deep yellow. Yeasty aroma, it's evena little funky. Creamy mouthfeel, major bitterness yet somewhat offset. Good for the Belgian IPA style. The palate needs some time to recover. Dcent drinkability. Orange citrus.Surprising alcohol that hits you later."
"Well done."
"One minor complaint. Some of my family is a little too politically correct and I would feel uneasy bringing this drink around. Especially if kids may be around."
"D: Alcohol content is higher than standard IPA, but it's not present in the taste. Proper glassware and temperature give a certain degree of balance; very drinkable considering the thickness, hop presence, and alcohol content. I've been tempted to make a session of it, but usually talk myself out of it on account of the high ABV."
"This beer had the pleasure of being my very first IPA and I was not disappointed. Beautiful pour with a nice pillowy head. I could not wait to dig in. Has a really great fruity aroma that just permeated through the whole tasting. I loved the lingering bitterness that just keeps building as you drink it. Flying Dog has a winner with this beer."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer! Probably Flying Dog's best."
" D- This beer has a nice full spicy hops flavor with a great depth and it blends well with the saison style yeast. The fizz is a bit overpowering in the finish but it does enhance the hops character."
"D: If you ever want to try the perfect example of a Belgian IPA, this is it. Great taste and will definately get again."
"I actually preferred the bottle version of this much better and found it to be a lighter style IPA which was perfect for a hot summer day. The flavors are quite complex and, in this case, I believe the belgian yeast and american hop characteristics meld well together."
"My favorite Belgian style IPA. First time I had it I pretty much thought it was a American IPA labeled as a Belgian IPA just to garner attention. After trying it a few times I can see why it has such label. No question my favorite Flying Dog brew. Pretty cheap too. This beer surpassed my expectations."
"A great beer, and sure does go down easy for 8.3 % alcohol."
"D: My favorite six pack buy for the price. Hoppy and fruity, well balanced, and a desirable abv"
"One of my favorite beers since release. Good pricing, good on style and very easy to drink and enjoy."
"Loved this beer. Very good mash-up of the two styles. Good maltiness balanced out by the grapefruit of the hops. The belgian spice come through next followed by the yeast(s). The nose is pretty great, too. Again a blend of two styles paired very well."
"m/d-A little light in the body. Leaves the mouth a little dry and wanting another drink. I sat down to casually drink my glass and it was gone before I noticed."
"Pours a nice reddish-amber hue. Aromas of grapefruit and piney hop. Mouthfeel is silky with a dry finish. Nice balance with a bright citrus flavor. Belgian yeast comes through with just the right sweetness to balance the amarillo/warrior hop overload. Overall, a tasty brew. Dare i say sessionable at 8.3% abv?"
"D - Moderate to low. Assertive bitterness chips away at the palate while the ABV chips away at your mind."
"Flying Dog Raging Bitch is a super clear amber ale with a soft, thin, dense white head that has outstanding retention and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a very grassy aroma with a note of fresh earth. It smells like outdoors. It has a smooth medium body with a dry finish. It has a nice grassy bitterness and it's very fruity, with notes of peach and stone fruit. The finish is bitter and phenolic. It's very tasty. I could drink a lot of this!"
"The beer pours deep amber color with a white head. The aroma of Belgian yeast is prevelant, with some floral hop notes. Taste is bready malts combined with the Belgain yeast and grapefuity American hops. Has an overall dry finish with a little alcohol at the end. Overall, a good-balanced Americanized version of a Belgain classic that is very drinkable."
"The balance between hop bitterness, malty sweetness and the spicy yeasts are close to perfect. This is a very well crafted Belgian IPA. And with the slightly higher ABV, this beer is dangerously drinkable."
"Exactly what I would expect a Belgian IPA to be. The fruitiness of a belgian golden or triple ale, combined with the similar but different malt aspects of an IPA, and a nice US style hops kick. The alcohol esters also add to the Belgian aspect of the beer. It is pulled off as well as any hybrid in this style as I have ever tried. Good work, Flying Dog, you have seem to gotten over the quality issues I used to associate you with, this is a well crafted and drinkable beer."
"I am starting to warm to this style."
"I like this one the most when its colder - it keeps more of the best flavors present. The intensity of the bitterness slows the drinking some and limits the desire to indulge in the next. Having said that this is unique and good."
"Bottle poured into a glass."
"It's a great example of a complex IPA, which I really wish would become a regular in their lineup. However, the ABV ensures that one or two is all one needs at a time."
"Raging Bitch 20th anniversary was almost too good and I was not let down at all while drinking it. HopFest may be technically located in Madison county NY, but yesterday at approximately 12:39pm...it was in my glass. I will definitely pursue this beer in the future."
"Orange copper body. Thin off white head. Lacing is minimal. Aroma is juicy hops and cakey belgian yeast. Flavor is balanced nicely with resinous and grassy hops blending in with the bready malts and estery belgian yeastiness. Solid flavor and a bit unique compared to other Belgian IPAs I've had."
"In the Flying Dog line of exceptionally middle-of-the-road brews, this is king."
"D- Like I said, drink this sum'bitch with a hearty steak. I had a six pack between 3 people over some nice steaks that had been marinating in a ginger/soy/citrus marinade for a day. DAMN."
"Not my favorite version of the style but a decent beer."
"It isn't the least drinkable IPA I've ever had, but it's certainly not the most either. One of these per session is plenty. Not a bad beer overall, but the herb character very nearly overpowers the rest of the beer. If that was toned down I think this brew would be a real winner, but as it stands I think one six pack is all I'll be buying."
"Drinkability: It's been a while since I have had a Belgian-style IPA, and I haven't had many, but this is what I think an IPA really should be- this has mostly very unique hoppy flavors, though they arent extremely overwhelming or bitter. Not necessarily balanced, but this is very hoppy while not overwhelming- highly recommended. VERY drinkable for its ABV, though the hop profile makes it more of a savory beer."
"D- not bad for a belgium ipa."
"definitely worth the $7.99 price tag. i've had better belgian ipas but this is a good deal for the price."
"Fresh and bright, balanced and just super-good. Hell yeah. No need to say more."
"D- Amazing for an IPA, I want ten more right now."
"D- very easy to drink, silky smooth, definitely picking this up again sometime"
"Pours a dark golden with little head, and what head there is fades away to a swirl. Smells peppery, dry and herbal up-front, followed by a little Belgian yeast clove and sweetness. More pepperiness and herbalness in the taste, plus some heat from the alcohol. Almost spicy. A little too austere, and hot, but not bad. Slightly tangy in the mouth, dry, and herbal. Pretty decent effort here."
"This is a very drinkable big beer. This is my second go around with it, and I genuinely know that glassware makes a big difference. The brew looks way better then my previous review. The brew at this point has a different taste as well, not sure if it is because of the glassware as well. Good stuff."
"A fine example for the style and drinks wonderfully. Well hidden alcohol, a solid brew."
"Drinkability: it goes down easy and the 8.3% abv is hidden well."
"drinkability: good"
"A nice hazy amber color with a solid white foam and good lacing. The aroma is a very scrumptious bready pine hop with a floral toasted malt complement. The first taste says yeasty pine hop with some juniper and raspberry highlights. Medium plus bodied with a pleasant carbonation and a light syrupy feel. It's very drinkable and likable with the vague Belgian hints presented in a slightly sweet and edible form. Would gladly revisit any time, nice job Dog!"
"Drinks very easy, abv is well hidden, I do find the Belgian aspects of this a bit restrained. Still a winner"
"D: It wasn't too difficult to drink this beer because the alcohol was well masked. I would definitely try this again if I saw it on cask because it was silky smooth."
"D: Delicious beer. I would drink a barrel"
"12 oz. poured into a Stone I.R.S. tulip. It pours an astonishingly clear sweet tea red with a small head. The nose is rather funky with the combination of belgian yeast and american hops. The taste is floral and citrusy with some sweetness, but it ends dry and hoppy. The mouthfeel is crisp but thick and lingers. This is a tough one to place. It's good but not worthy of buying a whole six-pack."
"Raging Bitch has supplanted Gonzo Imperial Porter as my new Flying Dog favorite. Pours hazy, the color of dull apricots with a big off-white head with nice retention and lacing properties. An interesting nose, with lots of grapefruit and general fruit basket smells up front giving way to lots of bready malts and cloves. The full, heavy body pounds the flavors home. Initially bitter, the lemon notes slowly sweeten to grapefruit and then sweeten more to reveal multiple layers of complex fruit, spices, and herbs. There's a lot happening here. Perfect food beer, or all on its own."
"D - Love this stuff and can't believe the 8.3% ABV. An amazing beer from a brewery I once thought average at best."
"Be prepared, it does go down easy and the 8.3% will sneek up on you."
"Overall: A nice beer, would not mind to drink it again"
"Another great beer from Flying Dog, maybe the best I've tasted from them. I'm a hop head, so I love the hoppy flavor of the beer, and the kick it delivers is great. Smooth, strong, great flavor, a slight bitter aftertaste which may turn off some, but for me I don't mind at all. I find myself picking up a six pack of this nearly every weekend. If you love hops and love a good kick with the great aroma and taste of hops, then this is your beer."
"Overall a superior example of the style."
"Things area bit ragged for this old dog. More IPA than B...elgique. An American in Brussels. The Daisy Miller of Beers? Caught a yeast infection at the Coliseum. Worth it for the money ... Enjoyable if un...cultured ... Shout out to Ryan of Pleasant Ridge for the bottle ...."
"This could easily be a sneaky snake."
"D - Overall, I usually think this is the best beer FD makes. However, I dunno if the bottles old or what, but I'm not feeling it as much this evening as I have in the past. It is a very good beer and a great mash-up of a Belgian pale and an IPA, one I've enjoyed greatly while it's been available. This needs to be brewed year-round!"
"Clear orange/amber colour with a thin layer of white bubbles coating the surface of the beer. Short-lived, streaky lacing and decent head retention. Caramel and toasted bread in the aroma, fruity and powdery, a bit yeasty. The flavour was surprisingly mild and balanced - I was expecting something more bombastic. Malty and fruity up front, a bit of alcohol, some citrus and spice towards the end along with sugary sweetness, followed by a slightly bitter and somewhat quick finish. Pretty easy drinking for the abv. Light peppery warmth, a bit dry, medium to full bodied with lowish, nearly creamy carbonation. I liked this and enjoyed it. I'm glad I have another bottle in the fridge."
"D- Overall, a good beer from Flying Dog. Could have a couple of these before the sweetness got to me."
"Great mid-Amber color, with a wonderful aroma. It has a very good hoppy flavor with a smooth finish that is neither too harsh on the pallet nor to light for a good belgin-style IPA. Very drinkable and I would recommend trying this one out. This beer is a good representation of what I have come to expect from Flying dog."
"drinkability: Goes down fast for a high gravity hoppy dry concoction."
"Overall, pretty much what I expected from Flying Dog in all that entails."
"T- Very intense explosion of flavor. Bitter hops. Has an almost Saison after taste, which makes sense because of the Belgian aspect."
"I know a beer should be judged by what is inside the bottle, but I've always found myself turned-off by Flying Dog's rather frightening label art and general attitude. The name and label art on this beer are disturbing, but, with the beer receiving consistent high marks, I decided to give it a chance. Pour was a beautiful vibrant amber/copper. Aroma was both Belgian funk and hops. Flavor was redolent of fruity Belgian yeast notes, carried on a substantial current of hops. A big beer with a big abv to match. ETOH was moderately evident at the finish. The Belgian/IPA marriage has always seemed to me a tricky proposition - like paring sweet and salty, the balance has to be just right. Here, the two flavor profiles seemed to retain a consistent distinction - like drinking a half-and-half of each style - it never quite came together for me."
"d-one of fd's best. right up there with gonzo. for a brewery with a lot of meciocrity, i do like this one for sure."
"Most evenings, when I have a Raging Bitch, I only have one or two, then shift to a lighter flavor. But this unique, robust brew would be an excellent first beer on most any evening."
"Enjoyed this on tap at a local bar. It is billed as a Belgian IPA. The color is copper and clear and the head was average. Aromas included mild banana and a somewhat floral hoppiness. The taste was an unusual combination of strong banana/clove and up front bitterness. There was some maltiness noticeable underneath, but it was not a large component of the taste. The menu claimed an ABV of 8.3%, but I did not notice an alcohol flavor."
"Nicely hoppy, stiff hop oils, some leafy freshness, peppery phenols and spices - notably menthol, and perpaps some mustard greens. Mild malt noticable through hoppage. Moderate bitterness. Finishes hoppy dry. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a small off-white head. Smells of freshly cut grass and heated plastic (lol, in a good way). Taste is cinnamon up front, with a grape juice middle, and a phenolic, clovey, medicinal finish. Piney hops are in the aftertaste along with a bitterness that clings to the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, its the beers lowest point though, as the high alcohol and intense flavors make this a sipper. I would definitely get this again though."
"Notes: I, nor Brett who I drank this with as we brewed a Pale Ale, can say a single bad thing about it. I follow Flying Dog on Twitter, they were posting like mad as they brewed, bottled and shipped this beer. And I wanted a pint of it every time they posted, and after all of that, it lived up to its hype. Great beer."
"I could really drink a couple of these. This is the first beer from Flyin' Dog that I didn't hate! (perhaps sampling it blind helped with that)."
"D- I was stunned at how much I enjoyed this. Very drinkable beer...real good IPA, hope it sucks around for awhile"
"F/D: Plenty of carbonation and fair crispness. A good beer over all, but really only one at a time, a real palate burner."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose. Flavor is grapefruit, some sweet orange. Dry finish. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"WoW!! What a great find. Had heard a lot about this one and finally tracked some down. Pours a pale copper with a nice fluffy white head that fades but leaves good lacing. Nice inviting aroma of pine and a little bit of clovy spice. First sip is a nice bitter crisp IPA. Then it turns to a spicy sweet belgian thing. Its really a GREAT combo of flavors. A nice clean feeling in the mouth and very easy to drink. Maybe too easy given the 8.3% ABV. But one of the best I have had of the style, and actually one of my new favorites overall."
"Taste, more hops, leans to the American side, thankfully. Still has the warming alcohol presence and yeast fruitiness on the Belgian tip. Mouthfeel rocks, alcohol feel fades, more nuance of the spice come on. All the right points from both sides of the pond. $11 a 6er is actually pretty good for this high quality product, the best thing Flying Dog has ever made."
"Drinkability: For all of the alcohol and IBU's within, it goes that fairly smooth. While Horn Dog and the seldom seen Barrel-aged Horn Dog still remain the Best of Show winners for me, this new Raging Bitch surely deserves a ribbon of its own."
"I'm knocking the mouth and drinkability just a touch for two reasons: first, the bitterness is a bit much, and two: these flavors just don't entirely place nicely. As an IPA this would be fantastic. As a Belgian ale... these aren't the yeast-derived esters I'd be aiming for. No Houblon Chouffe this, but tasty."
"Drinkability is on the high side for this style for me. I can have 2-3 without being overwhelmed and wanting something to reset my palete. Comparative to others in this style, where I have one and no desire for another."
"Drinkability: A sipper if not just due to the super bitter finish. I like how I can taste both the Belgian part and the IPA part of this beer. A very well executed beer. Not sure if it is totally my style and would get it again. However, the craftmanship is excellent."
"D: Goes down easily, not very feeling, well balanced with a nice kick to it. I will definitely pick this beer up again."
"I think this is an excellent beer. There's the perfect amount of bitterness, backed by the perfect amount of flavor. When I first poured this beer, I could smell its aroma in the air. For anoyone out there who loves an IPA style, this is an excellent beer to enjoy."
"Drinkability is surpassingly high for a beer with this ABV; beware!"
"One of the top beers from Flying Dog's lineup, I believe."
"Very sessionable in spite of the abv. Would easily pick up a case of this."
"Clear amber with a bit of carbonation. Dense head that eventually disappears. Honey, berries, and bananas comprise the sweet aroma. A bit of alcohol is also noticeable. A bit of carbonation up front. On the sweet side, but with increasing bitterness starting in the middle. By the finish, a battle ensues between the malt and hops. In the end, the hops win a battle of attrition. Mouthfeel leaning on the heavy side with a good amount of body."
"Still not convinced of this style but yet again a well put together beer. Radiant orange with a creamy head and some sexy lace. The nose represents the Belgian IPA vibe well but I can't help feel it's a clash rather than a harmony of IPA hops and Belgian yeast goodness. The IPA side of things is winning over and a nice IPA it would've been. It's a good beer but I just don't know when the time is right for this type of beer. I can't help but wish it was one or the other."
"Overall: I like this beer. A little high on grapefruit flavor and high on alcohol. This may not satisfy hardcore Belgian beer drinkers, consider this a hopped up Belgian Blonde, but very approachable for the rest of us."
"D: The alcohol seems a bit more then its advertised 8.3%abv as well the hops of 60ibu which were quite dominant. Spicy, hoppy Belgian take that will leave you with a good impression and wanting more."
"Pours a very light, clear, amber color with a big frothy white head that hangs around for a bit. The smell is very nice. It's definitely unique... Is it weird that after I smell this beer for the first time I think of the way that Saison Du BUFF smelt? Had that beer quite a while ago, but I get the same herbal, spiciness to this beer as well. Smells like an herb garden with a bit of hops and sweet malts. Initially, I taste the herbs and spices. Lots of oregano, clove, thyme, and pepper. Then it gets very sweet and hoppy. This beer is so damn tasty. Very unique in my opinion. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden and the mouthfeel is just perfect for this style. I could drink a whole six pack of this beer, but would not remember it. My favorite beer Flying Dog has to offer."
"Do yourself a favor and try Rock Art's Belgo-American IPA, it's a revelation."
"A real delight from Flying dog."
"Pours a rather luminous dark honey color with generous white head. Nose has a bit of chalkboard, and some background citrus. Palate has the same chalkboard like powerdy thing going on, almost somewhat medicinal like swallowing a tablet. Some dry grapefruit is there and a bit of wild flavors from the yeast. Finish has that powdery taste too."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. Other beers of this style are either too acidic or too weak. Raging Bitch strikes the perfect balance. It's solid enough for the serious beer drinker yet light enough to still be enjoyed by people of more petite palettes. At 8.3% percent, it's definitely smooth enough to have a few and be happy."
"D: The only thing that bothers me is the tartness at the end. It's otherwise very interesting, perhaps too interesting for drinking several."
"The first beer I've had from Flying Dog and it has made me want to try some more!"
"Dangerously smooth and delicious for a +8%. I'd petition to make Flying Dog keep this year-round!"
"M - Again, very well done. Perfectly balanced I will be seeking out more of this before it goes away."
"Very nice beer from flying dog. Let this one warm up for a while before judging. It gets dramatically better if you do."
"D- I really see no reason why you couldn't drink a few of these if... you had a ride home. Very drinkable but very big at 8.3% I love this bitch!"
"This is completely unusual to me, but not necessary in a good way. Worth seeking out if only to try something new."
"Drinkability- This was really good. I really enjoyed it at the brewery and had such a good time. I would love to drink it again."
"Flying Dog is fast becoming one of my favorite breweries. I don't care for their marketing but I love every beer I have had."
"D - Super easy to drink, due to the complex yet accessible flavor profile, and the consistent carbonation."
"D = Pretty damn versatile in drink-ability. The bright citrus really makes it refreshing and drinkable. The mouth-feel and slight complexity makes it sippable."
"D - This is pretty good, definitely different. Tasty, refreshing and a lot of flavor."
"Notes: Love it! A super-infusion of Belgian yeast and American Hop-slamming ingenuity. Perhaps the best in the style."
"Overall, the beer is pretty decent for its style. It is lacking a few things and the abv shows too much for me. I think it is a decent brew from flying dog, but nothing I would go crazy for to have again. Decent drinkability if I can get by the alcohol showing."
"Drinks: like diplomacy. Raging Bitch takes the best from both beer regions, offering an interesting and well-done blend of American hops and Belgian yeast."
"M/D: Mouthfeel seemed a bit thin to me. Drinkability is pretty good despite criticisms, generally unoffensive. Enjoyable overall, but not my favorite Belgian IPA."
"Pours clear copper with a cream-colored head that sticks around. Tart yeast and some spicy dry malt on the nose. Opens up quickly with lemony hops. Zesty, with lemon and green hops over a fairly soft, grainy malt bill. Yeast adds spice and zing. Finishes clean and softly bitter, with lingering leafy hops. A very drinkable, clean beer with bright flavors and a soft mouthfeel. No Houblon Chouffe, but very well done."
"Overall, I was pretty happy with it, though I didn't fully understand it. I'd put it above Cali-Belgique but below Houblon Chouffe."
"This should be the mold of what Belgian Style IPAs are made from. There's no denying this is a strong pale ale. You can taste everything, the hops, malt, wheat, etc. Flying Dog usually makes things strong, this one is no different. It was almost too much IPA though, but I did have two of them at the bar."
"Pours a clear, amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, floral hops, dark citrus, slight alcohol, yeast, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. The mouth feel is also slightly watery. Tastes of sweet malt, floral hops, dark citrus, slight yeast, hint of alcohol, and a hint of wood. Overall, an alright Belgian IPA; good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"M/D: Medium body. Average carbonation that feels a little soft making it feel smoother over the palate. Good drinkability. Since it finishes dry, you want another sip right away. I could drink a lot of these. ABV is very well hidden."
"The flavor is quite spicy as it first hits my mouth, but there is also quite a bit of fruit character here as well. This is very herbal tasting with a substantial bitterness and lots of big pine like flavors. The American hops contribute expressive flavors of lychee, kumquat and tangelo just underneath the herbal notes. The finish has some peppery alcohol, ginger flavors and phenolic notes that lean more towards turpenes than the typical clove notes. The hops are actually heavy enough that they drown out the fermentation character (I have a feeling that the fermentation character changes the emphasis of the hops here though), and I definitely like this part of this beer."
"Overall, I was surprised by how much I liked this beer. I'm not a huge fan of the standard Flying Dog lineup (I do like Gonzo and BA Gonzo), but this one impressed me with its flavorful palate and drinkability."
"I rarely drink Tripels, never been a big fan, and this certainly has a whole lotta Tripel going on. Regardless, this is a monster of a beer and I give Flying Dog a lot of credit on a fine brew."
"Very drinkable and not bad on the pocket. I hope this becomes a yearly offering."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (bottled 3/10/10) into a snifter glass. Pours a clear reddish/copper with a nice frothy head and light carbonation. Fruity aroma with some phenols and light caramel. Taste notes of light mango, caramel, and candi sugar. Good creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of hop bitterness. Very good example of the style that I will have to try again."
"Conclusion: Nowhere near La Chouffe, but fairly tasty nonetheless. My first bottle (same six-pack of this) was TERRIBLE...like a completely different beer; I think there must have been an infection or something else awry. I didn't review that one, as I was at home w/my family and just drinking and hanging out. I almost gave the remaining five away. I'm glad I gave this one another shot; it's one of the better beers I've had from FD, a brewery I'm not usually (except for Horn Dog) that big of a fan of."
"D: Great American hop taste combined with Belgian golden ale flavors makes for a great beer. I hope Flying Dog decides to make something like this again."
"Belgian IPA huh? Havent had too many of these before. This one is a clear golden colored brew, big cream-colored head, fluffy. Really bitter hop scent, oily. Raging Bitch is an apt moniker for this one. Very bitter taste, seems like the hops are some that you might find in an American IPA, but the yeast is all Belgian. Gets a bit spicy from the alcohol as it warms up. Other spices as well, pepper for sure. Pretty active mouth. Cool beer, well done"
"D: One of my favorite in its style. I get a few of these every time I go out."
"D-- Very different. Have not been really big on the US Belgian IPA style as Belgica was a total letdown. This is quite nice. Think the mix of the Belgian yeast and the hops pair very well and make this interesting as orange, peach, and spicy hops work really well in this. ABV is not real noticeable in this until finishing the 750. A well done beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"This is a current favorite of mine and is a must try for anyone who loves hoppy IPA's."
"Great bright orange in the glass the head is fairly thick at first but it falls somewhat quickly to a thin film. The lace is nice though. The smell too is good. A combination of west coast hops less of the citrus and more of the pine variety with some Belgian yeast character and spice. So the taste...there is a malt backbone in there somewhere but this beer is dominated by the hops. The Belgian character is a bit lost behind the hops which really dominate. I'd say there is a small lack of balance, but it's a great IPA. The body is good and the carbonation is moderate, the finish is dry with a lasting bitterness overall pretty good. When cold this beer is incredibly refreshing. The high alcohol and high bitterness don't detract from the drinkability of this beer in any way. I've never tried any other flying dog beers but have to say that I'm pretty impressed by this one. A solid IPA with some refreshing Belgian character."
"Overall a good Belgian IPA, was expecting a little bit more with the A- overall rating but a solid beer from Flying Dog no doubt!!"
"Drinkability was good for a strong beer. I could have enjoyed another!!. This is what I expect in a mixture of Belgian-style beer and IPAs."
"Light, clear amber topped by foamy white head that leaves thin lacing along the sides of the glass. Sweet aroma of caramelized sugar, apples soaked in liquor, slight raisin bread, prunes. The taste isn't as exciting as the aroma: faint apple fruitiness, booze, burnt bread towards the finish and rides out grassy with patches of mud and some candle-wax. Light-medium in body. The raging bitch must have hit menopause. There's no mojo here, no great flavor, no lasting impression. Flying Dog never ceases to fall short of expectation."
"Pours a clear amber orange color with a large white head that fell slowly leaving some good rings of lacing and had a lasting cap. Aroma is peppery, piny, and full of Belgian yeast. Alcohol is noticeable in the aroma as well as a touch of anise, presumably from the yeast. Taste follows the nose pretty evenly. First thing that hits are the spicy, peppery hops that give off just just a hint of pine and herbaceous qualities, followed by a good dose of caramel malts which are bready, and overall pretty balanced. I gotta say I'm not a fan of the spicy hops nor am I huge fan of Belgian yeast being used in IPAs. Maybe this just isn't my style, but it's hard for me to really get into this beer. It has some nice qualities, but could use a little more citrus/tropical hop flavors to balance the spiciness. Body is well rounded and nearly full for the style. Alcohol isn't as present in the taste as it is in the nose. Not a bad beer, but not my favorite either. Still searching for the Belgian IPA that blows me away!"
"Pours a amberish-orange colour, with a nice white head. Smells like a Belgian tripel that is hopped up, as you'd expect with the style. The taste doesn't disappoint at all. Nice Belgian tripel yeasty, with the American hops. This beer is truly awesome, I wish I could get it in Ontario."
"goes down ok. the smoked meat flavor is not unwelcome, but not off-putting either. pretty enjoyable, and this has turned out to be one of my favorite beers by Flying Dog. the complexity and uniqueness won me over in the end. I can't see myself recommending this too often, but I can see myself buying it again."
"I had high hopes for this one but came away fairly disappointed. It looks nice - amber-orange transparent liquid with a mess of fine white bubble on top. The aroma is pretty good - orangey/floral/cat piss hops, clean wood, honeyed malt and light Belgian earth. It's actually a tad boring for the style, to be honest. The taste is just disappointing. There's a lot of bland bitterness from both hops and wood. I've never much cared for Amarillo hops, so that could be to blame, but this beer just doesn't have much going on. The more delicate hop notes have faded, the wood doesn't provide much interest and the yeast is understated. For the style, it's harsh on the palate and drinkability is poor."
"Drinkability: I've had more than one of these on more than one occasion. To me, this is like an American IPA fermented with Belgian yeast more so than a hopped up Belgian pale ale, which is good, but just a really different kind of beer."
"Overall: Very good BIPA not the best but damn good. Cheers to Flying Dog for this one."
"Bitch please! This poured a nice gold with a solid white head. Pretty clear with particulates floating around. Pears, touch of apricots, and lots of citrus of the grapefruit/lemon variety. The flavor is quite similar, but less pears. Perhaps a hint of white grapes in the finish along with all the bitterness from the hops. A decently bitter Belgian beer. I think I could get used to this. Moderate carbonation, though I wouldn't mind a bit more."
"I have to retry some Canis Major beers (Double Dog, Gonzo, Horn Dog) but until I do, this is by far Flying Dog's best beer."
"very unique and good beer"
"Medium bodied and well carbonated. This is a good drinker, but the booze is very well hidden. Beware but enjoy. A great brew that was $1.95/single. Good value, easy to drink, good balanced flavors. Terrific. And people have an issue with the name? Really?! Buy this."
"This is my plea to Flying Dog to make this a year around beer. Definately one of the best to date."
"Pouring from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, it's a clear golden amber with a thick, creamy, off-white head. It gives off a wonderful, very bright aroma of fresh pine. That promise of pine certainly lives up when tasting it for the first time--resiny hops fill the palate, but it subsides into a malty, caramel finish with a deeply satisfying alcohol undercurrent. It's a well-bodied beer that's neither too light nor too heavy. It may not be entirely sessionable--it can be a bit intense--but it's certainly a rather enjoyable experience."
"One finger white head, medium dissipation resulting in solid layer of head on top of clear orange amber body, considerable carbonation rising from bottom of etched glass bottom. Grapefruit dominates the nose but the Belgian yeast is noticeable, as is cardamon-like spiciness. Taste is a bit on the sweet-side up-front, noble pine hops in the middle leading to a fairly bitter finish. Full mouthfeel with above average effervescence leading to a quite dry finish. . Alcohol very well hidden, quite drinkable. IMHO, this is quite good. Here's to another 20 years from one of America's best small breweries Worth checking out."
"Prefer the Hopus to this..."
"This is one intriguing beer. Very easy to drink and dangerously so. Alcohol does not make an appearance in either taste or arom, but the head feels a bit twisted after a few and then you realise how dangerous this beer really is. Absolutely loved it."
"Drinkability is good on its own but this really should be paired with some good spicy food."
"D: I kind of like it. I'm not a huge Belgian IPA fan, but the beer works well for the most part. The orange flavor is a bit weird, but it's not a deal-breaker. Might have again."
"I would keep drinking and drinking and drinking this lovely. The high ABV doesn't bother at all like in some. It's wonderful."
"Raging Bitch Belgian-Style IPA is Flying Dog's second best beer. Horn Dog Barley Wine Style Ale is the best. It's a humdinger of an ale that is a few tweaks away from being amazing. Here's hoping this 20th anniversary brew becomes a year-round release."
"d- really nice, so drinkable, i would definately drink this again. this is probably my favorite belgian ipa to date."
"Overall, Raging Bitch is a good attempt to reproduce a Belgian take on an American style. I have to admit that Flying Dog has never impressed me - until now. It's not a true blue Belgian IPA, but it's hoppy and tasty so I have no room to complain. This is a nice beer and one that is certainly worth trying."
"Most days I would prefer a SN Torpedo, but this is enjoyable for a unique twist"
"Pours a pretty golden orange with a finger plus of head. Terrific tropical and citrus fruits jump out of the nose, smells like one of the really good IPAs - lots of fruit. Just a hint of the yeast coming through, which makes this one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had. The hops are fresh and vibrant, some caramel sweetness, hints of esters, medium bitterness. Slick mouthfeel, I quite enjoyed this one which was a bit of a surprise as I don't particularly enjoy Belgian IPAs nor have I been overly impressed with Flying Dog's offerings (outside of Gonzo). Would gladly drink again."
"A pretty good representation of the style, and I really enjoyed the esters that dominated the flavour. Remove that weird astringency and this could be a world-class Belgian IPA."
"Comments: A beer of the month selection that I received in special, limited edition 750ml bottles. This beer emphasizes its IPA qualities much more than the Belgian qualities. And that is its stylistic shortcoming for me."
"D: This was a very nice clean and crisp Belgian IPA. It had a nice balance of bitter and sour elements, with some sweet malt to smooth out the finish. It had good body and was easy to drink. Among the best Flying Dog beers, and definitely worth a try."
"Aquired taste."
"A disappointing beer. The yeast and hops are not integrated well and the bitterness is just a bit too high."
"what a wierd beer. i like it, but i'm still not sure what to think of it. will revisit at a later date."
"M/D: The bitter end is a little off-putting, but the beer has nice carbonation and a nice mouthfeel. It is an intense beer that I enjoyed drinking, but probably wouldn't have more than one in a night, two max."
"Although I really didn't care for this beer initially, the 2nd bottle wasn't as bad. The aftertase is a real negative. Very hoppy though. I wouldn't purchase this one again."
"Good drinkability, one of the more bitter Belgian style IPAs out there."
"I enjoyed this much more than expected. Hybrid styles not usually my thing, but the Belgian yeast is toned down well enough to meld well with the IPA style while sustaining its uniqueness."
"This is a cool beer. It's highly carbonated like a Belgian, but very Americanized with the hops used. For the beginner beer drinker, this would be the beer that makes you want to try them all."
"Poured a clearish brown with a slowly dieing frothy head and a light, airy hoppy smell with hints of citric fruit and some sweet malt. A easy to drink ale as this beer is light-to-medium bodied and smooth with a good hoppy presence that makes itself known with sour fruit and spiciness. Some yeasty and caramel malt mix in there for a good balance. Not the tastiest beer yet one I can't help but keep drinking and has a well-hidden ABV. Definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability - One of my first Belgian IPA's and I'd say a good introduction into the style. Easily quaffable for the alcohol content. Has an odd sensation of flavors/taste due to the style, but it is something that sort of grows on you."
"I was expecting this one to be interesting and it didn't let me down. The label is crazy enough but the flavor backs it up."
"This is a nice beer, and I recommend it. It has a good balance between the hop flavor and its maltiness. Can get a little overwhelming at times, but a nice brew nonetheless."
"Oh well, even trying to get away from getting this beer an identity, I don't think I""ll be getting it again. Just a bit too spicy for my taste."
"D - The alcohol is no where to be found in this beer. Raging Bitch contradicts itself (in a good way) once again with a bark that's worse than bite in the ABV regard. Despite the nuances of this brew, it's got a nice clean, crisp feel and east of drinkability. A good beer, one of the better ones in fact, from Flying Dog."
"drinkability - great flavor, surprised me quite a bit, smooth and consistent"
"D: Drinkable with nice spicy, citrus flavors and a strikingly authentic Belgian yeast character."
"D- A bit too intense of an aftertaste to score mad points on drinkability, but after a few of these I might not notice anyway."
"Notes: This one is just plain tasty!!!"
"This is the first beer I've tried from Flying Dog, and I must admit I'm turned off a bit. However, the Ralph Steadman artwork on their bottles is cool enough to make me willing to give some of their other beers a chance."
"Overall a solid stab at the style. A bit too dry and spiced for my taste. One is enough for me."
"The body is on the light side of medium. The aftertaste does not linger and the filmy sensation I mention above doesn't hang around either. Not a guzzling beer, but throwing back a three or four would not be out of the question."
"This is cripplingly drinkable. Flying Dog's finest moment by far, and one of the best bargains in beerdom...while it lasts."
"For being an American version of this style, I like it quite a bit. Overall, I wouldn't want more than one. Just not really my cup of tea."
"Notes: Sad that this is not going to be a year round beer for Flying Dog seeing as it the beer I have enjoyed the most from them."
"D: A interesting take on the IPA style from a Belgian perspective. I haven't had a Belgian IPA before but this is exactly what I would imagine it to taste like. A fruity IPA taken to the extreme with that characteristic Belgian yeast nose and flavor. I'd definitely have this again but its pretty middle of the road for me for the most part."
"D - This beer would have been rated higher if the flavors would have combined a little more...this was a solid beer that had the potential of being awesome...this is one of the better beers from Flying Dog...well done"
"D- I was certain that I would not care for this one due to the whole Belgain IPA thing, but I was wrong this is a very solid and easy to drink brew. I'd pick up more of this one if I could find it. Recommended for sure."
"Drinkability is good. One could easily enjoy several glasses of this concoction."
"Feel the rage! Y'see, in public speaking courses, they stress attention-getters. That's the best I could come up with here. Speaking of attention-getters (that there's a transition), this brew's got quite a lovely orange-amber hue to it, capped off with a chapeau of white suds. The nose comes off as sugar-dipped hops steeped in some funky straw and garnished with some parsley. Not only does it add a bit of color, but a dash of spicy aromatics as well, adding to the whole dining experience. The parsley is also on the tongue, joined by some mightily bitter hops, some light caramel, a dash of soap, and I think I've got a pinch of paprika in there too. Something like that. So, (and here I'm connecting with the audience) if you're lookin' for a tasty, light, and not-too-fizzy beer that won't leave you hanging, choose Raging Bitch. (There's an overly large smile on my face at this point.) ...I think I may have stepped into commercial territory there... Seriously though, this is a damn fine brew right here. (I somehow got an A in COM 114...)"
"First of all i love this breweries labels definately original and i love dogs so thats a big plus with me,anyhow it pours a deep golden hue almost bordering on copper with lovely carbonation that leaves a creamy two finger head that slowly reduces to layer of froth and heaps of sticky lacing everywhere,it has aromas of spicy belgian yeast,pears and pepperoni,it has a nice above medium bodied mouthfeel which feels quite creamy with tastes of pears,apples,paw paw,boiled candy and spicy belgian yeast,overall this is definately a very decent brew that i would revisit and am only annoyed at the fact that i only got the one but will buy more of tommorrow without doubt."
"Overall - An excellent brew and one of the best of these ""Belgian IPAs"" that i've had... highly recommended..."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and sticky. Drinkability is pretty good for the style, I could down a couple of these with a burger and fries no problem. However, I'm not sure it really separates itself from the pack enough to warrant revisiting."
"Drinkability on this Bitch is above average, could be a bit higher, but the alcohol content will sneak up on you and bite your ass. Consume copious amounts of water during or after having a few of these, as you might wake up with a Raging Bitch of a headache."
"Pours a lovely orange into my Duvel tulip, with a large white head that leaves plenty of lace. Nose is a nice mixture of sweet malts, belgian spicy yeast and floral hop notes. Taste doesn't quite match... the sweet malts and yeast flavors are there, but the brewers could stand to ease up on the bittering hops and ramp up the late additions. Nice level of carbonation, and the mouthfeel is good overall. Pretty drinkable as well, not in any way hot or boozy."
"I've learned that not every beer is for everyone and that's okay. I like this beer. And while I won't go crazy over stocking my fridge with any collection of bitter options, I will say that this is one that I would be glad to have around."
"D-Hugely drinkable. I have had a number of very good brews lately, but the profile of this really brings a smile to my face...what a sweetheart of a beer."
"After a few sips I though I couldn't imagine a better beverage. This was packed with flavor, complex and very easy to drink. It was only my first Belgian IPA, I will certainly be on the lookout for more of the same."
"A really decent big APA that is too drinkable."
"Drinkability: If you don't get caught up in the Belgian aspect, which I'm not, this is a damn good, fruity, balanced, hoppy DIPA, and I could easily drink a few more of these. One of the best Flying Dogs I've had. A tweaked, bolder, more alcohol, more Belgian version I could see phenomenal as a corked and caged future part of their series."
"I would buy this beer again."
"While the smell is beautiful and enticing, and the flavor of the beer is not overwhelmingly bitter, it is not quite as boundary-pushing as I wanted it to be. That and the fact that the alcohol is pretty high on this one means that it is easy to polish off a pint, but impossible to drink a sixer. I wouldn't invest in a case, but I might drink it again if I saw it on tap."
"D - love this one. great IPA with some kickers. unique and refreshing. wish i had more. i'm sold."
"Decent drinkability. Well made beer and an unusual style."
"Overall, this is my first beer from Flying Dog and I am very impressed. I don't know if they went all out on this one, since its their 20th anniversary beer, but this recipe is definitely a keeper. Rich IPA flavor mixed with beautiful Belgian notes. If this beer was readily available in my area, it would have a permanent place in my fridge. Damn New Hampshire for banning this based on the ""vulgar"" name. Definitely pick this one up if you can get it."
"All in all, this is one awesome beer. The first Belgian IPA I've had, but it won't be the last."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a clear coppery color, very clear - no haze, which is a bit unexpected. 1"" of off-white head. In the aroma, there is a strong hint of clovey Belgian yeast followed up closely by hop bitterness that creeps out. Same thing in the palate except a little less Belgian yeast clove/spice character - more hop bitterness that makes you pucker up, I love it. Mouthfeel is that of a traditional Belgian-style ale - a tad thick yet soft carbonation. Very dry finish. The mix between the high level of hops & Belgian character is wonderful - very different. This is a wonderful ale, I cannot wait to get more."
"D - A nice American brewed Belgain IPA. Worth trying and I'd buy again. Shame it's pretty pricey here at $AUS11.50 per bottle."
"Pretty darn tasty, though 8 oz.s is probably more than enough for me."
"Ultra clear, light golden amber with an off-white head lacing the glass. I really like the smell, light molasses on top off a broad but light tropical fruit-like hops. The taste is pretty good too, I get an increased hop presence, a sweeter grapefruit base, and underlying malt that is excellent. Sharp bitter and spicy finish; a bit carbonated. The alcohol percentage is about right, as I detect but a small amount of burn on the end. I would be happy to drink one of these every once in a while. ""Belgian"" due to the yeast, but really this is a solid IPA. Recommended."
"Really enjoyed this beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer. A little on the carbonated side but still a delicious brew. Watch out for the ABV."
"I've had Raging Bitch on tap and from the bottle. It was definitely better fresh on tap; the hops go a long way to temper the sickening sweetness that made the bottled version a disappointment to me. However, all-told, both versions suffer from being too obviously a fusion, where the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts. If I felt like an IPA, I'd order a better one than this. So too if I wanted a Belgian ale. Nothing about Raging Bitch draws me back, though it's a decent beer when fresh."
"D: For a ""Raging Bitch"" ABV of 8.3 %, this has a smoothness you can appreciate throughout though I'm sure the well hidden alcohol can eventually bite you in the arse..."
"This Raging Bitch is actually a fine and sophisticated lady. I poured this Bitch into a 12oz goblet I'd put in the freezer for about 15 minutes. Dark honey/amber color, beautiful head and fine, detailed lacing. The flavors are incredibly well balanced and rich enough to hide the sturdy ABV: vanilla, oak, honey, minty hops, with a creamy, silky finish and a slowly fading rich, welcoming aftertaste. This is one of the better beers I've had in a few weeks. Not sure about the ""Belgian"" appellation here, since it doesn't seem akin to any Belgian beer I've had. A regular IPA title would be fine. The day before I had this I was downing some Bell's Two Hearted Ale; and this is clearly better, even though the Bell's is a renowned powerhouse in the heavy-duty IPA category. Enjoy, and please, my friends, drink responsibly at 8.3% ABV."
"Drinkability: One of the better, if not the best, of the regular Flying Dog lineup though it doesn't really have a classic Belgian IPA character; not crazy about the finish, however"
"This is a really good beer - probably the best I've had from Flying Dog, and much better than expected. Definitely get out and try it if you get the chance."
"All this makes for a robust, good tasting experience. Did I mention the near perfect appearance? I would not have expected a lesser brew from Flying Dog. With their reputation, the pressure is always on to produce great product."
"my first try at a belgain style india pale ale,was pleasantly surprised!it is an orange color,decent head,and taste very simalar to some other india pale ales.the 8.5% alcohol was a plus for me also.not exactly my favorite but definately drinkable and not like anything else ihave ever had with ""belgian"" in the name. also pretty creative name from flying dog."
"Full bodied IPA. Decent mouth feel. Not heavy but with clarity of purpose. Hint of spice without being over the top. Minor bitter in the after taste. Excellent with a mild cheese (non-smoked). Not for the session as ABV is high. Enjoyable. Worth a try for those that want to move beyond yellow water advertised as beer."
"I had this a few months ago and did not care for it, but this certainly surprised me tonight, a interesting IPA with qualities of the style from two countries perspectives without either stepping on toes. It packs a lil punch to so i'll stop at two. One of the better Flying Dog beers I've had recently. Happy 20th guys!!"
"D - Since it is limited I may grab one more before it's gone but I did like it and the price was very affordable. Very solid brew!"
"Pours a nice shade of dark orange, 2-finger rocky white head. Shrinks but covers the beer the whole time, retains quite well and leaves some 'raging' lacing. Definitely smells the part of an IPA. Definitely getting the citrus and a hint of grapefruit, alongside with scents more common in light Belgians such as pear and yeast. A strange, yet intriguing taste. It seems like each sip varies back and forth between styles - sometimes it is IPA, sometimes it is pale Belgian, but these don't seem to mix like they should, not very well balanced. Also much more IPA flavors are detectable as a whole rather than Belgian. Still, the flavors that come through from are both good. Heavy citrus and pine, slight caramel, the Belgian tastes seem to focus on mostly sugary yeast and spice. A bit of booze. Mouthfeel is fine, carbonation and thickness is in a good place. This was my first of the style and I enjoyed it, though I think it is unbalanced, it is much more IPA than Belgian."
"d: I really like this. Call it an IPA and I give it an ""A". I just couldn't taste the Belgian qualities like I hoped I would. If I see this again, I'll certainly order another though."
"D: I wouldn't really call this a Belgian IPA in the sense of, say, a Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor or an Urthel Hop-it. However, this does prove to be one tasty American IPA though."
"pours a golden copper slightly hazy color with a small head but a realy fresh off white ring..i smell citrus and hops and malt first with a background of belgium yeast i also smell some bubble gum and clove..the taste is a crisp big ipa with citrus and pine and hops with some clove and other spices..then some caramel malts sweeten the taste with some belgium yeast in the background but not enough 4 my liking..it seems this ia an american ipa 1st that was then fermented with some belgium yeast (which is fine)..its really good its tasty hoppy and sweet but i was expecting say more of a tripel with hops in an ipa with more yeast..its still very good and very recommended"
"Pours a great mid-to-dark copper color with a slight orange tint at the bottom of the glass; it has great initial head, very nice lasting head, and wonderful lacing. Very deep hoppy scent with a nice citrus tone; also has an interesting bubble-gum scent (guessing from the Belgian yeast); very nice deep malt back bone. Great taste, a wonderfully thick IPA; great malt presence with a wonderful pale sweetness; excellent hop attributes, with great citrus and slightly earthy tones; a nice bubble-gum sweetness in the end that merges with a very nice and deep hop aftertaste, that has a slight pine edge to the other aforementioned hop tastes. Goes down thick with a bit of hop roughness."
"Pours a clear amber color - a nice, thick head on top. Smells beautifully hoppy...all resinous and green with bitter citrus pulp, subtle Belgian yeast, and pine wood. Hops all over the tongue too. Dank, oily, and sweet. Pale malts are there as a base, but it's the balance of the fruity/spicy/estery notes of a strong golden Belgian ale and the ripe bitter orange and pine sap hoppiness that makes this beer. Medium bodied and quite refreshing for its strength. Good show Flying Dog. Happy 20th!"
"Overall, one of the better examples of a style that I'm not in love with. Worth a shot when you see it."
"A very good 20th anniversary beer that I hope gets brought back as a seasonal. I for sure wouldn't mind drinking this one a few times a year."
"D: Taste more like a normal IPA to me -- I'm not picking up a whole lot of Belgian qualities in this. Very smooth for 8.3 ABV."
"Strawberry blonde with a big creamy off white head that lasts and leaves beautiful lace on the glass. Fresh resinous piney hop aromas hit my nose the second I cracked the cap. Up close this beer smells fantastic, citrus and pine sap with a blast of Belgian spice. Spicy clove and coriander with tons of juicy hop flavors and a caramel malt backbone. Finishes slightly bitter. Medium light bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Another good beer in the ""Canis Major"" series, I wish their everyday beers were this good."
"This beer is really impressive, and a great way to commemorate their 20th anniversary."
"Medium to full bodied. Beer has this late spiciness and slightly dry finish. Not a lot of bitterness but there is some forward sweetness. Not really an IPA but its a nice strong ale."
"The drinkability is decent; there are some aspects of this beer that detract. The alcohol is well-hidden, but that is not enough."
"Taste is crisp and clean. Slightly citric in nature and a bit chalky in fact. Feel is thinner than expected given the ABV, yet still manages to cover it well. Somewhat coarse on the finish with with a firm bitterness, revealing a hint of sweetness on the close. Decent drink though a bit of an odd balance, drying and bitter and with a relatively light Belgian presence."
"Pours out a hazy coppery orange with some chunks floating around freely. The head is off-white and fairly creamy in texture. It resides at about two fingers and has very good retention. Even after a minute or so, the head does not want to go away, a very nice looking beer. The suds stick well and there is some medium lacing left behind. The smell reminds me of a Belgian white. Hints of bubble gum, yeast breadiness, light grainy malt, some citrus fruit and spice. I definitely get some orange peel and banana. The nose has good strength, nice. The taste is similar to the smell but hits the palate much harder. I pick up some huge spice, maybe from hops and yeast but it feels added, cardamom? either way, I have tasted it in Belgian style ales but not to this degree. The light grainy malts stick around and so do the yeast products like banana and bubble gum. The citrus peel aspect is also there and makes for an interesting beer. To me, the spicy/yeasty aspect is way to big in this one. The hop bitterness seems out of check too, too bitter. It has some cool flavors but I don't see much balance here, it is a raging bitch. Mouthfeel is nicely creamy and medium bodied. The carbonation is lower and allows the flavor to come through maybe a bit too much for me. A hugely bitter coat of Belgian yeast spiciness is left on the palate. Drinkability is alright. The flavor is too strong for me in spiciness and bitterness. The price, as always, is very good from flying dog and the ABV is very well hidden. Good beer with some good flavors and price, worth a shot, probably won't get it again, not my style."
"D: It's a pretty decent beer, but I'm not inclined to drink it quickly or drink a bunch of it."
"A 12 ounce bottle that was part of my mixed sixer at Abe's. Uncapped and poured into my shaker glass. The Bitch appears a crystal clear pale copper color with about two fingers of off white foam. The head leaves a decent lace on the glass with each sip. Aromas and flavors consist of toasted bread, sweet caramel, coriander, citrusy hops, spicy belgian yeast, grapefruits, white grapes, tangerines, bananas, floral, yet somewhat bitter hops. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a bitter, spicy, dry finish. Delicious stuff and at around $1.75 a bottle? C'mon! Go get some."
"This is a great beer. It's my first Belgian IPA. My only wish would be slightly more of a belgian kick, but other than that, I can't wait to explore this style a little more."
"Hey, if the Bitch is Raging, then she simply needs to be set free. I began with one of the most aggressive pours of my life, nearly inverting the bottle as it growled at me. Down, girl! That pour resulted in a finger-and-a-half of eggshell white foam that was as dense as some of Kotter's Sweathogs. Even the remaining foam poured like soft-serve ice cream! The color was a deep, coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was definitely Belgian yeast with esters of banana and must. Speaking of bananas, the taste was initially that of banana bread, then suddenly, the pine hops kicked in for a riot of flavor. It was like a King Cake, except that instead of a baby, somebody baked a pine cone into the middle of a loaf of banana bread. Zoinks! Mouthfeel was kind of abrasive, lots of CO2 scrubbing the nooks and crannies of my tongue. The finish was all hops, leaving me gasping for breath. Almost forgot the beautiful lacing throughout. Phew, ""pure GONZO!"" is putting it mildly. I have no words."
"D: Fantastically good. But only if you like hops and Belgian yeast. And I do."
"There might be a Belgian hint or two in there, but this beer is definetly more IPA than Belgian."
"I was hoping this would have a little more belgian style to it but otherwise it is very tasty."
"Drinkability - Very dry, very satisfying. Love those Belgian yeasts! Could have asked for a little more hop complexity - felt a little one-pointed - and a little smoother mouth feel, but I would certainly go for this again. Cheers!"
"Overall, I enjoyed this and would have loved to have one just a bit fresher. A nice Belgian IPA. Happy birthday Flying Dog!!"
"Drinkability: easy drinking beer despite the higher alcohol level. Great balanced beer with a great flavor profile. Worth seeking this out."
"Overall this beer is different in a good way. I could get very used to this beer."
"Overall, I liked it. I have always dug Flying Dog's hoppier beers, and I would get this one again. Plenty of bang for your buck."
"May they never retire this one!"
"Hops that hit the nose aren't overpowering in the initial taste. Same with the boozy first sips. Orange, lemon, licorace and pepper balance the hoppy bitterness nicely. Just enough malt background as well. Light feel makes this a perfect hot day treat. Not sure about the ""Belgian=style"" description but I DID like this beer!"
"if you see this one get a sixer you'll be very glad you did!"
"I had this beer on draft over this past weekend. Today's review is poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Dark copper color with about 2 inches of foamy head. Suds remain clung to the glass. Pungent hops scents along with fruity esters along with a certain amount of spices. Strong hops and certainly flavors of belgian yeast. Nice flowing mouthfeel. Easy to drink. This was certainly a big surprise for me."
"Drinkability: I will have this one again!"
"D-Nice belgian type IPA. Maybe a bit less of the yeast ester and more hop flavor and aroma. I'd have this again."
"D: The 8.3% ABV is well-masked and it's a very good representation of this relatively experimental style. Enough citrusy and piny hop resins to satisfy most IPA fans with that sweetened, lighter, relatively high ABV for the Belgian fans. What a way to celebrate 20 years; Flying Dog is spot-on with ""Raging Bitch!"""
"P.S. Sorry for the weird breaks, I did this on my blackberry and can't seem to fix it..."
"I drank this out of a Chimay goblet."
"Drank a bottle of this the other night. Overall, an excellent beer, although it came off as more of a double IPA than a Belgian IPA. Perhaps the hops were just too overwhelming. That being said, it's a great beer. Excellent appearance. Smell and taste of a mix of hops: sweet, citrusy, piny. Good mouthfeel - not too light, but not overwhelmingly heavy. Overall, very drinkable and dynamic beer."
"I don't often encounter unique IPA's any more, sadly (or Belgian IPA's for that matter...), but this is one. Floral hops add a lingering piny bitterness to a backdrop of spicy Belgian esters, cracker-crust malt, and a hint of medicinal booze. Body is crisp, tightly carbonated, and of medium consistency with a drying, peppery finish. All in all, Raging Bitch is a great anniversary beer (ironically reviewed on my parents' 30th wedding anniversary). It's also one of Flying Dog's best beers to date."
"you know, if someone wanted to level the criticism that the hop gets in the way of the belgian i would not call that someone unreasonable. smells belgian but just taste like bitter (it's a bit crass, i know. bitter does have a flavor and it's not bad unto itself)"
"Pours a clear golden orange color with 2 fingers of head and sticky lace that clings to the glass. Aroma is a strong burst of hops presenting themselves as scents of lemon-like citrus, orange and pine. Taste is very hop forward with citrus bitterness and a bit of the classic belgian style of spices. Light feel with moderate carbonation. Fairly warming beer as the alcohol is not hidden at all. For a belgian style IPA, it is very americanized with the major characteristics being the strong hop presence without much malt backbone. It seems quite unbalanced but a quick fix if you are looking for some hops."
"Overall, I love IPA's and I love most Belgian styles but this one just didn't blend well for me. In the style, I've seen it done much better (Piraat and Hugh Malone). R/A - not sure if we are going to get this in TX or not. Ummagum had an extra so I shipped that back from my CO trip to see him. It was interesting and glad I tried it but one is enough for me [N;N;OTR]"
"An amazing beer... I'm a huge fan of serious hop; I've lived in CT for just over a year and have yet to find an IPA that knocked me on my hind region... look no further. I'm am in love with this rich and hoppy beer. Totally sexy with licorice, walnut and hazelnut a grassy minty floral middle with a crisp honey and caramel malt finish..."
"D - Eloquent... Hands down the best Flying Dog beer that has crossed my lips... I could sip on this all night long even at 8.3% ABV... I highly recommend and am glad that I invested in a six pack instead of a single bottle..."
"The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, full bodied, and has a lingering hop feeling. It's good but I'm expecting more from a Belgian style. This beer started to grow on me by my third glass over a few days, but I never loved it and wouldn't get it again."
"Before this, Flying Dog was a bit like Magic Hat to me, something people always talked about that just did nothing for me. This has changed!"
"the 8.3% is hardly noticable, drinks so easy and is quite refreshing, definatly would be nice for the summer months to come. a really nice session beer, drank quite a bit of this last night with the boys watchin the sabres lose again. i really hope to see this around for awhile, cause i will definatly be revisiting another 6 pack really soon. i also noticed this was an anniversary beer(20 years! i had no idea flying dog was so old!) so hopefully my wish will come try and this will be on the shelves for the rest of the year."
"i'll be downing plenty of these after many a cyclocross race this fall! and while training this summer! ;)"
"D: Oh my, one is plenty, but I'll be back for more."
"D-at 8.3% its approaching most double IPA styles and usually one is enough for the day, but it was well balanced and two could easily get finished. definitely better than most of the flying dog line, unfortunately I don't think this will get produced for awhile or never again. I didn't noticed much belgian characteristics, to me it was just a sweet cirtrusy version of an IPA and lacked a classic Belgian dryness"
"Smells green and citrusy. With a lot of Belgian yeast eathiness. A bit different than the bottle I had a few days ago. Tase is a great blend of american hops (citrusy, juicy) and the belgian yeast flavor. Really nice beer, one of the top Belgian IPAs. Better than anything from Belgium I've had in that regard."
"Drinkability - This beer is very easy to drink but the taste is so interesting that all I want to do is sip and enjoy. I wish I had more than this one single. I will definitely be returning to this beer."
"Poured into a chimay chalice transparent orange with a thick white head, great lacing all the way down. Smells of weak floral hops with a hint of yeast. The taste is rather odd for an BIPA. The hops flavor up front doesn't really mix well with the belgian yeast used. There's a conflict of flavors going on that may just be too complex for my palatte. But there is flavor with this beer, lots of it. The mouthfeel does leave a unpleasant aftertaste, but the alcohol is not evident. Making this a rather confusing drinkable beer."
"D - This is a unique, fun and drinkable beer. I'm not a big Flying Dog fan but this may make me rethink that."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with a very thick three finger plus frothy head that gives way to some nice lacing. The aroma is of sweet malts and some dark fruits as the base with floral and earthy hops over the top. Very nice pleasing smell. The taste is on par with the smell, sweet malts, dark fruits, and a slight roasted malt taste, for a backbone. Over the top is a nice floral hop bite with some hints of earthy hops. Very complex and interesting. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very high you could have these all night, perfect balance of malt and hops and complex enough to keep you very interested in it. Overall a very good beer."
"Overall this was not what I was expecting at all from the stellar reviews. Quite bland and disappointing."
"Poured a golden amber with a thick, long last white head. Smell was very citrusy with some very sweet fruity notes as well. Taste starts out earthy and floral then moving to sweet fruity and finally citrusy and oily hop finish. Medium carbonation, very full bodied with a definite alcohol presence limit the drinkability of this to just one or two, probably best as a night cap. Very good, very complex."
"D: Despite high ABV very drinkable, easily the best Flying Dog brew that I've encountered."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a frothy and clingy khaki colored head. The aroma is definitely of hops; floral and juicy with some pineapple and other tropical fruit notes. The hop presence it a bit more subtle in the flavor letting the sweeter belgian style to pop through. Not much in the way of yeasty phenols. Definite tropical fruit flavors coming from both the hops and yeast. There is some spice and pepper, though it seems that its main job is to offset the hops, which it does. A light to moderate feel with fizzy carbonation, very nice balance, especially for an American made BIPA. Very enjoyable though I still prefer the Belgian made BIPAs, I just enjoy a more Belgian flavored BIPA."
"Bottom line: VERY well done. If you haven't tried this yet, do so."
"Pours a nice orangy-amber with a slightly off white head that laces nicely and dissipates rather slowly. Aroma is nice and spicy as it should be with ample citrusy hops backing up the spice. Taste is again spicy and citrusy. Feel is crisp and light bodied, with a slightly oily finish. Overall drinkability is good, I'll definitely have a few more of this Belgian IPA."
"This is some tasty stuff and definitely one of the best Flying Dog beers I've had. Not the most complex Belgian IPA, and the Belgian characters in general are somewhat subtle, but the fresh, fruity hops really make this beer. They do their job very nicely, and I find this to be very tasty and drinkable. It's definitely an Americanized Belgian IPA, but I don't have a problem with that. Oh and then there's the price, which is extremely reasonable for a Belgian IPA. I think I just might buy some more..."
"A real ride: invites you in coyly & then moves in for the kill! Very good, but approach with caution."
"Bright flavor and bittersweet aftertaste compels the imbiber to continue..."
"Pours a clear medium orange color with a white head. The aroma is Belgian yeast, citrus and oranges. The flavor has lots of citrus with lemons and oranges. Belgian yeast flavors are present as is medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium to high carbonation."
"drinkability: well masked high abv. awesome flavor and something which is relatively new and interesting to me. very refreshing also."
"Pours a pretty nice dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, slight yeast, pepper, caramel. The taste is a pretty nice hop bomb, malty, a nice pepper note, slight corinander, and caramel. Medium body, the finish is bitter and dry. Very Drinkable, this brew surprised me, very nice, recommended. Thanks Wayne."
"overall a very good beer that i look forward to drinking again, and stocking up on next time i see it."
" I find this ale to be quite an interesting style . Each sip brings me in further and further.... So yeah I could put a few of these back with out missing a beat. ....well atleast not until the 8.3% ABV kicks in."
"Overall, this was a pretty good belgian ipa. I only wish it was balanced a little better with some sweet on the front."
"Very drinkable. This would make a good session beer. I could finish the sixpack over an evening. This would be a treat for either lovers of Begian Goldens or APA/IPA lovers. Well done."
"Delicious. Love this stuff. I'm seeking out bottles, so I can enjoy it more. Here's to 20 great years, Flying Dog!"
"D= A delicious twist on an IPA, hops are present as flavors more than bitterness The malts and yeast make you keep searching for new flavors and aromas with each sip."
"Super super drinkable in my book, it's intriguing like I said before, and that seriously just makes me want more and more to discover all the layers in this bitch...literally, Ha! I like it, if you see it I recommend it for sure."
"my .02"
"D - This is pretty enjoyable. I wouldn't mind having another right now. This is flavorful and complex and an interesting take on a Belgian style IPA (though probably not totally authentic in nature). It is very pleasant to drink and I'm having a hard time believing it is an 8.3% beer. Hope they make this a regular offering."
"Drinkability- this is certainly not a hard beer to drink by any means though I wish had a touch more balance as I feel the dryness is almost overwhelming and makes it become a beer I would only want to drink at most one of, its certain a sipper and one you take your time with as you can notice a touch of heat and the fact its not light wieght, overall its decent but to my personal tastes nothing I would go particularly crazy over."
"It doesn't seem like an almost 9% content beer. Very drinkable and perfect blend of taste. Pours nice, not too much head for this type of beer. Typically you have to be very cautious with the pour, but it was not bad at all. Overall this beer finds it way near the top of my beer list, maybe even into the 10 top all time."
"Overall, this was an amazing beer. It was my first Belgian style IPA and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be picking more of these up."
"It pours a nice, bright orange-amber with a thick and frothy off-white head capping it off and eventually leaving some nice lacing down the glass. The nose is full of piney, citrusy, and fruity hop aromas with subtle hints of bannana and Belgian yeast coming out on the end as it warms. The flavor seems to follow the aroma pretty closely with each sip with a touch of honey sweetness coming out as it warms. There is a nice and refreshing hop bite lingering in the finish. As it warms the 8.3 % abv comes out a little bit, but stays very drinkable."
"Pours as a slightly hazy warm yellowy copper colour with a medium sized creamy off-white head that shows great retention, and loads of carbonation. Strong, slightly citric, hoppiness with lots of oranges, and a hint of zesty lemon. The taste is bitter with a mouth coating perfuminess. The Belgian yeast is very apparent, offering, adding a harder edge to the familiar Flying Dog pale ale flavours. An interesting beer, was expecting a bit more though I think, given the hype it received from beer bloggers over here in the UK. To me it taste a bit like their Classic Pale Ale on steroids, however, the power seems to have unbalanced the subtle bitterness that makes the pale ale so great."
"D: One of the better Belgian IPA's I've had, and that includes Piraat ale. I enjoyed that one, but the mouthfeel of this one is much better. Raging Bitch is not as cloying either. Overall, both are good examples of an unusual style that for me combines two of my favorite styles, though they are quite contrasting style. Seems like an unusual combination, but it does work to a degree. I'd probably drink this again, but won't go out of my way for it."
"Good hop taste, but no mistaken that this is a belgian yeast beer. Very tasty. Not an every-day beer, but for special occasion, this is very good."
"Pours a bubbly bright orangy amber color with frothy white head, diminishing quickly to a nice cap, good lacing. Smell is a nice blend of hops up front - grapefruit, pine and grass, whiffs of belgian yeasts with a candy like sweetness. Taste is again forward with a wonderful blend of the above mention hops, slight sugary sweetness and belgian yeast flavors, slight bitter bite. The hops are the star, but the other ingredients round out the flavor perfectly. Great body to it, i love the feeling on the palate - fuller side of medium bodied, slightly coating and hints of a sweet and fruity aftertaste all with a nice carbonation profile. A very well put together beer that exceeded my expectation and is one of the better Belgian IPA's on the market. Thanks to philbe311 for picking one up for me."
"Rather complex and quite drinkable, with the powerful dryness leaving behind a scratching for another quaff. Pleasant overall, and a nicely balanced interpretation of the style, if perhaps a bit over-hopped for expectations."
"Drinkability is good, it was a very nice beer and maybe the best of this style I have had. That said, personally I really don't care for the Belgian yeast flavor in an IPA. This would have been an excellent IPA without the Belgian yeast that I might have enjoyed even more. But that's just my personal taste, still a very good example of the style."
"good drinkability for the style - quite impressed. overall as a brewery i find fllying dog pretty hit or miss...this one is a hit."
"Drinkability is quite good. Balanced, even as hop-forward as this is; the Belgian character keeps the hops from being completely dominant while at the same time accenting their qualities. I didn't enjoy it as viscerally as the sweet, Tripel C-Hop assault of Houblon Chouffe, but it's still a very nice beer. A very well executed Belgian IPA."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (thanks richbrew!) into pint glass. 2 finger off-white almost tan head and the beer itself is golden amber. Strong hops in the nose with slight malt and a little belgian yeastyness. Citrusy hops dominate the taste along with some semi-sweet malt. Not as much belgian flavors as expected but present in the finish. Full-bodied and very drinkable. I must proceed with caution as the 8.3% creeps up on you."
"D: The thing I really like about the Belgian IPA category is when a beer incorporates the greatness of American hops while maintaining a Belgian yeast identity. Beers like Hopsinjoor and Houblon Chouffe can do that. This beer is not is their league currently. Suffice to say though, this is quality stuff and clearly one of the better Flying Dog's I've had in a long time."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a nice pale and Carapils malt scent along with an excellent hop nose and a subtle Belgian yeast aroma. This is what a Belgian IPA should smell like. The taste is good. It has a solid malt base of pale and Carapils malts. It goes down smooth with a killer hop flavor. It's incredibly refreshing. It's also well balanced and highly drinkable. What a delicious IPA. The Belgian yeast character is limited. There's only hints of it in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a really good beer; probably the best Flying Dog has to offer IMO."
"D: More drinkable than I would have thought for 8.3%. Good, bordering on sessionable."
"the drinkability is about two mugs, if you want to respect the beer and to savor its taste."
"Hops are in the taste. But it doesn't overwhelm the Belgian character which is quite nice. Probably the most interesting aspect of this beer is that it has honey tastes in the finish."
"Overall a pretty nice effort from Flying Dog, who for me is really hit or miss. The abv is well hidden and the crossover style intersting. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one, but would be happy to drink another one if convenient and well-priced."
"Overall Impression: This is one of Flying Dogs better offerings! (It's their 20th anniversary beer). I've had this beer with Asian food, and it paired nicely. It was a hard beer to find, so you should try to seek this one out if you like the style. I can't believe they finally named a beer after my ex wife!...DOOOOH!"
"I gotta say, this is better than I expected as I haven't been too pleased by most offerings from Flying Dog. This was a good stab at the style, resulting in a beer that satisfies and displays some similarities with the style leaders, but finally is influenced by its American roots as well."
"Like many I have been left wanting on alot of Flying Dog brews but this had me wanting MORE!Poured into a small tulip glass a brilliant golden with a sticky one finger white head that left multiple rings of lace as it settled slowly into a creamy froth,excellent.Aromas to me are full of Simcoe goodness,grapefruit rind really takes the forfront,slight yeasty notes but the american hop profile wins the day.The palate is full of citric,oily, hop,ever so slight phenolic spice actually lends well to the big American hops,some peppery notes come in as the beer warms.Easily my favorite of the style to date,not to yeasty and or medicinal,a true mix of American hop,and Belgian yeast,a great beer."
"M/D: Mouthfeel is smooth and silky. Lowish carbonation. Overall, an extremely nice beer from Flying Dog. I'm not super familiar with the style, but it's one I see myself wanting to get more acquainted with."
"D- This is a nice beer but for what ever reason I cant see myself drinking more than one. I would have this beer again, but I think I would pick something new over this."
"I believe this is just coming to NC and was fortunate to have it on tap at the Liberty Gastropub in Charlotte. this was part of a beer pairing and we enjoyed it with Beer Braised Spicy Boudin Blanc with GrilledArtichokes, Gaelic, Cheese Fondue, & Grilled Peasant Bread. a nice combination to say the least. This is a great style and Flying Dog hits the spot with it. Easy to consume, even for those who are not hophead. Nice color, head, and balance"
"D: A nice beer over all, a little too hop forward for me to have everyday, but it still fits the style. I really like the mouth feel, but wish there was a little more sweetness to balance the hops."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a refreshing bite of carbonation."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a crisp bubbly dark orange with a nice frothy eggshell head that lasts and leaces great lacing on the glass.. Aroma is sticky pine hops in front of caramel malts and mild spice. The taste is a very complex blend of sweet caramel malts and bitter pine hops with a nice touch of Belgian spice. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with slight alcohol presence. This one is very enjoyable, likely the best filtered Belgian IPA and the best Flying Dog beer I've had yet."
"Drinkability is decent for the style. It is definitely a sipper, but with enough time one could enjoy this beer and later go back for another. RB is a nice addition to what Flying Dog has been putting out in seasonal mixed packs."
"Kef"
"Notes: Good beer that seems like a bready American IPA with Belgian yeast. Enjoyable mix of flavors with a lot of different flavors present. Not the most hop forward beer I have had, but hops are the stars."
"Flying Dog is one of those breweries that doesn't really stand out for me. They brew some alright beer, but Horn Dog is the one only star in their roster. I had high hopes for Raging Bitch, but it's just not my ideal Belgian IPA. The spicy hops seem to negate some other positive qualities that are here. Same goes for the toasted malt flavor. They just seem out of place to me. It's alright, and is worth a try. But, this bitch is just alright."
"Slightly dark tint with a thin head and slight carbonation. I was impressed by the flavor. I expected more of a Belgian but it tastes much more like and IPA (of which I am particuarly partial of). The ABV is high so you need to watch out for this one sneaking up on you. Right now it is on my regular list."
"Overall, I didn't taste a ton of Belgian influence in this brew. As one of my favorite styles, Raging Bitch makes an alright showing. Very drinkable Bel-IPA (and strong to boot) but fell a bit short in my eyes."
"Wow, this beer is properly named...she really is a bitch. Great banana notes from the yeast, strong hops and a little kick of sweetness not sure if its from the yeast or malt. This is a fun beer, but be careful and watch your tone, cause you just might get slapped in the mouth from this Raging Bitch."
"D- Not much drinkability. Hot in the finish. One of the toughest quasi-categories to brew right now since I don't think anyone has mastered it yet, but this is a good try and I think the intensity and ingenuity is there."
"D/O - I'm really digging the marriage of American IPA and Belgian yeast flavors in this brew. This beer is one helluva a surprise from the guys at Flying Dog. It's easy to find, tasty, and reasonably priced. I'm definitely going to seek out a another sixer of this before it's all gone. I just hope FD adds this beer to its regular rotation. Highly recommended. Cheers."
"If you like a good example of a Belgian IPA, pick this one up!"
"Pours a brilliant reddish-orange with a blast of bubble activity that results in a giant fluffy off-white head that does not want to dissipate. A thick lace rings the glass when all is said and done. Nose is filled with sharp citrusy hops, some orange peel in the middle and a slight mustiness poking through as it warms. Tastes spicy, with a vein of grapefruit running through and enveloped in some big hops. Goes down a bit dry with a little chalkiness coating the palatte. Medium-bodied with big carbonation and a subtle alcohol heat which appears randomly throughout the session. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Flying Dog is either right on the money, or way the hell out in left field with their beers. This one almost hits the jackpot."
"A really nice beer, very bold flavors and aromas. I really enjoyed the inclusion of Pacific Northwest hops here, really brings great dimension and works beatifully with the belgian yeast flavors. A great surprise, highly recommend."
"This beer I had on tap at Bill Batemans in Reisterstown. Had it after drinking resurrection and oddly enough I think I liked it better. It had a smooth mouth feel, a nice spicy finish, it poured an off red color with a white head. It smelled nice and hoppy and had a creamy head. I could definitely have drank another."
"dark amber color with a one finger head that left a good amount of lacing. The nose is hoppy with citrusy notes. The taste is hops, first, very noticable but not overly bitter like in many IPAs. I can taste citrus and also a malt presence. Goes down easy also. I will say that I think overall flying dog is a bit overrated, but this is an exceptional beer nonetheless. One of my favorite IPAs."
"D- Awesome beer. Not too cloying. Big hoppy flavors. I loved this. Very different. Nice rendition of the style."
"Drinkability: Having not had very many Belgian IPAs, I would have to say this seems like a good one."
"D: This is a fantastic beer. I was hesitant to buy this because I have never been impressed with Flying Dog in the past, but a guy at the beer store talked me into it. And I'm glad he did, I could drink these all night."
"OVERALL: This was one heck of a good beer. The IPA qualities dominate the Belgian in it, but that equates to a very enjoyable American take on the style. This is maybe my favourite offering from one of my favourite American breweries. Very enjoyable and very drinkable. Make sure you get to try this one. Recommended."
"D - I'm really enjoying this one I like the blend of extra hops with the Belgian yeast worth finding to try sometime"
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Chouffe tulip. Translucent copper color with a big, lasting beige head. Very fluffy and leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma is pretty intriguing. The hops and yeast esters are both very strong but just about even in proportion. Banana hits first, then mango and guava, some bubblegum, slight herbal resins. Smells like that Dole orange pineapple juice. Really luscious and potent aroma. Unfortunately the flavor isn't as robust. It's not bad but it lacks complexity. Simple, lightly sweet malts emerge up front and then a light tropical fruitiness washes into a mild bitterness and a very very clean finish. I didn't expect this to be filtered but with a yeast-free final pour, it must be. Explains the clarity and cleanliness. Body is not too thin on the palate but it finishes like water. Carbonation is rather subdued after such a prominent display of head upon pouring. Great aroma, decent flavor, good beer."
"D - Very drinkable for the 8.3% ABV. I'm on my 2nd 6-pack since it came out a month or so ago and each of the 6-packs last a couple weeks with other beers being drank in between. So basically it's not a pounder."
"Overall: My favorite Belgian IPA used to be Great Divide Belgica. This is now my favorite of this bastard style called Belgian IPA."
"Alc 8,3% best before dec 2010."
"In my tulip glass this beer was a gold color with a thick, white, sticky head. A nice aroma of citrus and pine. Yeast was also noticeable, coming across as a woodsy odor. Unique taste: grapefruit and pine tempered by the Belgian yeast. I really enjoyed this beer. My only small criticism was a rather sharp, metallic mouthfeel."
"Overall this is a unique beer, I have never had a Belgian ipa before bit this is a very good, comex beer."
"I have never really been drawn to Flying Dog before but this one changed that for me. This is an amazing brew that I hope makes it into the seasonal line. I hate to think this is a one time brew."
"This is a solid beer, but it certainly isn't the best Belgian IPA I've had. If you have the opportunity, give it a try."
"12 ounce bottle, best by June 5, 2010. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about a half inch off white head that went away quickly. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma is great, it's sweet, fruity and hoppy. It smells like pine and citrus hops, tropical fruit, candy sugar, Belgian yeast, caramel and peppery spice. No one aroma overpowers the others. However, the hops are stronger in the taste at first. Once the beer warms up more, the flavors start to balance out. It tastes like pine and citrusy hops, peppery spice, yeast, and bready and caramel malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think this is a good overall brew, one of the best I've had from Flying Dog in a while!"
"Glad I got a 6 pack of it!"
"Much different from a bottle and I must say it's far superior on tap. Color is more transparent, less lace. Taste is overly bitter and has less Belgian qualities."
"Since this is a 20th anniversary beer, I will try to find what I can and hope it gets put into regular rotation."
"This is a fine anniversary ale but I do hope that Flying Dog puts this within the regular rotation."
"I am not looking forward to the remaining 5 bottles of the sixer I bought."
"D: For my tastes, the ABV is perfect. Gives it just enough heft, but not too much to knock you on the floor. Very drinkable, very enjoyable. Definitely check this brew out. An interesting style too. Cheers to Flying Dog."
"Oh, and it's a decent pair with my burrito from Chipotle."
"Overal a great beer to drink and share with your BA buddies."
"Medium body is well carboneated. Nice hoppy finish. One of Flying Dog's better offerings."
"At a decent price may buy again."
" Get Some!!"
"Drinkability: Pretty high if you like hops; there's no question that it's far more drinkable than some of the very aggressively hopped IPAs and DIPAs out there."
"12oz. bottle served in my ST tulip. Poured a translucent golden orange with a creamy, 1.5 inch off-white head. Copious tiny bubbles present effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a half inch cap with delicate, semi-concentric bands of lacing formed as the brew recedes. Nose presents with some citrusy sweet hops initially, but as you tease the aromas out there's something else there, perhaps herbal or candi sugar or both. Taste consistent with nose; however, the citrusy sweetness is there, but well masked. Herbal quality expresses itself as somewhat bitter and lingers between quaffs (maybe anise), and I still think there's some candi sugar in there. Mouthfeel is medium-light and very lively, just shy of prickly with a fairly dry finish. A very interesting and tasty beer - better than I expected, but I found it a little tough on the palette. Nonetheless, probably my favorite example of the style; not that I've had many. Well worth trying this one if you have the opportunity."
"This is far from my favorite style but I can enjoy one of these from time to time."
"*A couple sixers later and, after going back and forth a few times, I'm bumping this score up a touch. I keep waffling as to give this a five or not. Right now this is the best beer I've drank as far as my buds are concerned. If I have to add, I'd mention that the bubblegum really comes in after a few of these"
"Beautiful amber color with a head that is just okay. Tons of citrus hop aroma. Ruby red grapefruit, a little bit of spiciness and a touch of bready sweetness. The taste is surprisingly sweet and catches me off guard. Definitely plenty of grapefruit and pine hop taste, and some black pepper/clove but the bitterness, while there, is not as evident. This beer has a lot of slightly carmely malt sweetness, yet still maintains a finish that is not too sticky. This beer is on the lighter side of medium bodied and I find that mouthfeel fairly smooth and pleasing, though I find myself wishing it was a bit more carbonated. Despite any shortcomings I feel like this is a beer that I could drink quite a few of, and would enjoy doing so. A nice change of pace from other American made IPAs."
"This is an excellent beer, probably Flying Dog's best. I won't rate this as highly as some of you, but I understand why it is getting rave reviews. If you like just a little Belgian-ness in your IPA, this is your beer."
"Drinkability is good, easy to finish though not a quick drinking beer. This one seems to really hit the major points for the style though not necessarily dead on. It's a good beer from FD and worth a try especially if the style interests you."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Pours a golden orange color, with a good two finger tan head. Decent lacing, good retention. Nose is very much belgian yeast and bitter hops. Taste is bold hops, but balanced out in the middle by caramel malts and just a twitch of belgian flavors. Dry finish with a hint of alcohol. Medium body and carbonation. Good drinkability for 8.00 ABV, won't finish the 6pk in one sitting but it will get finished. A great limited release offering from Flying Dog. If you have the chance, get your hands on some before this dog runs off."
"First off, props to Flying Dog for some cool packaging for this beer... funny name, and great artwork on the label, plus this beer is damn good! Pours a light golden color.. plenty of ascending bubbles. Nice head as well. Taste is medium to light-bodied.. nice sweetness to it. Very hoppy but its balanced out, has the typical Belgian yeasty sort of taste to it. Nice smooth finish.. for being a strong ABV beer not too harsh at all either, but it will definitely hit you after one. Nice pick for a 6 pack (plus iI paid only $7.99 for it, which is great for an 8%+ beer)."
"The beer pours a clear dark amber with a pillow topped head. Toasty amber malt aromas sneak through the dank, earthy, hop stink that plumes off of this nuclear IPA. Hop flavor dominates, but is propped up grainy maltiness. A light citrus character and a deep ""purple"" earthiness that're indicative of Amarillo, fill all corners of the palate and are chased by pleasant alphaic acid bitterness. A crisp light medium body delivers round lingering hop wonderfulness throughout the mouth. For an 8% and change abv beer with 60 IBU's Raging Bitch is dangerously drinkable. This beer epitomizes the class of beers we, in America, call IPAs, Belgian Style IPAs, Double IPAs. Whatever we call these hoppy ales they're awesome and this one is one of the best."
"I haven't had all that much from Flying Dog, but this is the best I've had from them. I'm trying it from the bottle later."
"D- Definitely different from other higher-abv IPAs I've had; not sure if I've developed the taste for it yet... perhaps I'll have to drink some more of them..."
"Great representation of the style, just wish it was regularly available, would easily be a six pack that I often keep in stock."
"Pretty easy drinker for a strong IPA."
"A very nice Belgian-styled IPA. In fact, one of the better American ones out there. I'm thoroughly impressed."
"I preferred this version to the bottled version but I was still kind of disappointed. I was hoping for something bigger and bolder."
"Overall: my 3rd of this style. Probably my favorite, but still not my cup of ipa. The other 2 I had were from Great Divide and New Belgium."
"pint at Galaxy Hut, Arlington"
"In the end, the beer favors more American influences than Belgian. I'd prefer more assertion in the foam, head, and carbonation catagories. I'd also like to see more Belgian yeast character with aged cork-like attributes. But the American hops are spot-on with this kind of beer. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
"D - Quite drinkable, it has a nice hop character and crisp dryness. There is some belgian yeast character here, but not a whole lot. Just a bit of peppery character that compliments the pine hops. The dryness is the most Belgian aspect of the beer, which leaves it feeling like a dry IPA with a strong malt flavor. This makes for an enjoyable beer, but the dry toasted malt becomes cloying after a while and I really prefer the bright, tropical character that I get in some other examples of the style."
"The nose detects some subtle bubble gum notes; the palate is greeted by some mild hoppiness amid a sweet, brown sugar finish. Nice balance of the hops and the malt. A tad too sweet and a tad too bitter at the end. I honestly can't say that this bitch was raging. Still, I was at Churchkey and my palate was no doubt overwhelmed."
"A: From a medium pour comes a hefty dose of thick and fluffy head that sticks around for several minutes, the color falls between copper and peach, as the head drops it shows lots of spots sticking to the sides of the glass - 4.25, S: The nose is very floral and yeasty, some slight citrus and significant bubblegum, mild sweetness as well - 4.25, T: Solid hop bite on the palate, quite earthy and woody, alcohol is noticeable as are the candied sugars, there is also a considerable amount of grapefruit and possibly some honey, finishes dry - 4.25, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: Overall a very drinkable beer, sufficient hops to satisfy the hop head in me mixed nicely with the Belgian characteristics - 4.00"
"Drinkability, I've been on the fence before with Flying Dog beers, but there are some I really do like. Raging Bitch I'm afraid puts me back on the fence with the inclination however to climb on over. Perhaps it's because it's the first of the style I've tried but I could see this growing on me. I'm not quite sure I'd want a second right away but I can easily see the interestng flavor profile getting stuck in my head and perhaps creating a craving for it. It is a very warming beer and definitely interesting on the palate!"
"Cool experience, I won't be buying this one again anytime soon."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, not the best representation of style, there are definitely better beers in the style that I would pick before this one."
"(D)- A solid IPA that has some good things going for it. Enjoyable hops & citrus. Definitely one of Flying Dogs better offerings."
"Overall: Great beer, without a doubt the best beer Flying Dog has ever done. I'll be the first to admit that I did not enjoy much of their other products. However, this brew has it all in spades. The use of Belgian yeast is certainly present, and unmistakable. However, it does have more hops than the average Belgian IPA, indeed, more aggressive. Thus, it lacks some of the elegance of Belgian IPA's."
"D: This is a powerful beer that I wouldn't want more than one of in a sitting. One of the best Flying Dog beers I've had to date."
"Many other reviewers are raving about the sharp citrus of this beer, which I simply didn't get. Maybe I've been hitting the HopSlam a little too hard!"
"D - Overall this is a decent beer, but I don't think I'll be having another. The hops used are varieties that I'm not extremely found of. That said, it's decent, but not outstanding."
"Side Notes: I wish there was more to the belgian style though. This is my first American made Belgian IPA."
"I'm working my way quickly through a six pack of this stuff, and it's my favorite new discovery. It definitely emphasizes hops-- a nice combination of dusty, resiny, citrusy, and tropical hop flavors-- but it has plenty of light caramelly malt, warm alcohol, and funky yeast flavors to balance it out. The aftertaste is dry and bitter and still reminiscent of wonderful hops. This is scarily drinkable for an 8.3% beer."
"Drinkability is fairly high. The flavor profile is interesting and unique making for a really enjoyable experience that keeps bringing me back for more. The ABV is relatively high but well incorporated and easily managed. It's just a solid beer."
"I've had more IPAs than I can count and I consider the IPA my preferred style. So it's saying a lot that I put this in my top-5 IPAs of all time!"
"I don't get Belgian from Raging Bitch. it's wonderfully citric, aggressive, and bitter. It stacks up well against most American Double IPAs. To me, that's a very good thing and was a pleasant joyful surprise."
"D: It hides the 8% well with a big juicy flavor profile and a dry, sharp finish. The alkalinity tired my tongue out after most of a bottle, however. I've never been a huge Flying Dog fan, but this is a solid beer for the style - it's just not a very good style, in my opinion."
"Pours a clear amber color with a great, frothy white head that retains very well. Terrific lacing. Smells very fruity. Aromas of cantaloupe, papaya, pineapples, and that classic ""belgian yeast smell"" as well as a hint of piny resin. Lots going on on the nose. Taste is more ipa pronounced up front with a lingering aftertaste of the belgian yeast, spicy, coriander & banana flavors interlocked with a drying bitterness. Citrusy and candy sugars flavors, very resiny...not as nuanced as a lot of the actual belgian interpretations. More ""in your face."" Mediumed bodied, good carbonation, slightly oily, astringent finish. I could relish in a couple of these but no further. I'm usually not a big fan of Flying Dog brews but, all in all, a good american interpretation of a belgian interpretation. ;)"
"M + D: A bit of an oiliness almost becoming a bit of a sticky feel. While it is a decent brew, I find it to be perhaps a little too intense on the palate, and not showcasing some of the more subtle nuances that could make it fabulous. That said, it's still a worthy selection for an odd evening - I simply wouldn't place it among my top choices."
"Cheers!"
"D: The only negative aspect is that I did not have more of these. Buy a six pack, now."
"nice to see a dry crisp entry in the dipa sweepstakes. gonna have to try some cheese pairings with this."
"Drinkability: Nice abv level is masked well by the intense flavors. This is a solid belgian IPA for sure. Would try this again and its a high reccomendation."
"Drinkability: Overall, the best example of an American brewed Belgian IPA to date. It shows off a tremendous American hop profile with that Belgian funk that is expected. Flying Dog did a fantastic job with replicating a real Belgian made IPA that we can all find in the states. Definetley worth grabbing a six pack and trying. I see alot of other American craft brewers following suit with trying to jump on the Belgian bandwagon. Excellent all around!"
"Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Drinkability is pretty good, the 8.3% ABV isn't noticeable and I could have another with ease."
"Flying Dog makes great beers and this is one of their best. Grab it if you can find it."
"D-this is a nice Belgian IPA bringing good hops and a thick mouthfeel. i will enjoy the six pack i picked up!"
"I already said this is Flying Dog's best beer. Easily. Is it the best Belgian IPA? Possibly. There is stiff competition, but I think this one can hold its own. Buy this beer. Flying Dog has to make this their official anniversary beer: a yearly release in the Canis Major series."
"Overall I feel this was an excellent take on the Belgian IPA style and be warned...Flying Dog is here. Excellent showing at the 2009 GABF is well deserved."
"This was my first Belgian-style IPA. Picked up a 12oz bottle, well priced. Pours a great golden color w/ amazing white fluffy head and lacing. This beer is hoppy as hell! The hops outweight the belgian characteristics, which is ok. Medium-bodied and bitter. Flying Dog has something to be proud of w/ this one. This would be a great summer beer."
"D- A little smooth a not too rough, pretty much a perfect balance. Very drinkable for an IPA lover like myself, maybe not so much for one who doesn't, but either way it goes down right."
"Edit* Some bubblegum in the nose. I was wondering what it was when I came upon TonyReaves' review. You hit the nail on the head, man."
"I'm going to sit on a bottle for a while (something I never do) and see if it smooths it out a bit."
"I was excited to try this and I'm still glad I got to. But I'm also glad I only bought a single. I don't think the aggressive hopping of this beer combines well with the belgian style aspect. Its just too many things going on at once. I can definitely see what they were trying to do though."
"Fantastic beer, I want to see more high hop belgian IPAs"
"It'll also be good for the style. It's not a common one among U.S. brewers right now, but I think we'll see a lot more Belgian IPAs come next year."
"D: This is definitely one of the most interesting beers I've had in a while. A unique, hoppy bombshell of a Belgian-style ale. Drinkability is difficult to assess. The wild flavor profile scores points, but the finished product is a bit rough, raw, and alcoholic. One thing is certain though; this bitch can rage."
"Overall: A hell of a brew that's going to make me have to rethink my stance on Flying Dog in general."
"This beer would be a great AMERICAN IPA, but not Belgian. For a Belgian IPA it needs to be a lot more subtle on the hop bitterness and much less aggressive. I'm not sure why they even call this a Belgian IPA. This shows how Americans can take styles too far. Flying Dog I love most of your beers, but this is just too far!"
"I have bought more than one human should consume in the last two weeks, and I fear that once the production run is over I may be curled up on the bathroom floor calling liquor stores to see if I can get a quick fix. They need to make this a fulltime production beer."
"Drinkability: Certainly interesting, and pretty damn drinkable for a beer that packs a big punch. Gets easier to drink toward the end of the session, but at no point would either one of us call this beer ""easy"". Enjoy! N: 4.0; Z: 4.5"
"Opening with a fairly potent bitterness with a lot of pine needles and grapefruit and citrus rind, this is quite the palate-bruiser. The hop bitterness is really strong, quite dominating the Belgian yeast character that's relegated to the background with a yeasty, spicy, estery character. There is a definite malt presence, mildly sweet and honey like. Resiny on the finish with more hop bitterness, this is EXACTLY what I'd imagine an East Coast Belgian IPA to taste like. Medium-light in body with a fairly high level of carbonation, this beer is solid. Great for the style, but unfortunately, the style just doesn't do it for me."
"Poured clear copper color with a large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy tart citrus hop and small yeast aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate citrus sweet flavor with a moderate bittersweet finish of medium duration. Very good complex brew."
"D: Interesting complexity of flavors. Personally, I liked it a lot."
"Cheers."
"D: good, easy sipper."
"D - This brew was a very pleasant surprise. The flavors balance very nicely together, and the 8.3% abv is basically unnoticeable. A solid offering from Flying Dog that I will definitely have to pick up again."
"drinkability - this beer is 8%+ abv so you may want to pace yourself - i drank this bottle a little fast it was so tasty"
"Pours a surprisingly light orange amber with a full finger foamy off white head that resists fading and leaves a nice amount of lacing behind. The smell is really good...an aggressive and unique fruity candied-melon-tangerine-apricot and piny hop resin. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is smooth and crazy creamy. Full flavored the fruity sweet aspects of the nose are well balanced by the intense hop resin mirrored in the nose. The piny hop and melon characteristics linger nicely. A real easy drinker...the 8.3% ABV is really well integrated. Scoring CRAZY points for CREATIVITY...Highly recommended!!!"
"Saw a sixer of this in the local BeerMart and it looked interesting. Poured a bottle into a tulip glass. The pour leaves a thick bubbly head that fizzles out into a thin ring. Moderate amount of lacing left on the glass. The color is a clear copper/light orange. The aroma is real heavy on the citrus. A noticeable grapefruit presence. It smells like an IPA should smell. Real nice. The taste is much the same as the aroma. Real strong citrus punch up front. Grass and pine follow and give way a nice bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. This beer drinks well and is quite enjoyable."
"Overall I was not expecting this one to be as good as it was. Simply intense and very welcomed. I loved this one very much."
"Alcohol shows a bit, but this is still very ""drinkable"". Great hop character with a Belgian infuence in its character. Very nicely done!"
"Drinkability: Given the finish is less intense than its beginning, and the fact that it is a unique balance between a tradtional IPA and a Belgian ale, it makes for a very enjoyable beer. ABV is 8.3%, in conjunction with the dry-hopped taste, some may be overwhelmed."
"I'm drinking this one a little cooler than room temperature...it may open up as it warms some. But, overall, this is a decent beer...one that is drinkable, for sure...and an interesting hybrid...I love the idea of blending the Belgian style with the overly hopped American IPAs...so, for this attempt, Flying Dog has done a pretty good job."
"D - The 8%+ abv is not noticeable. Very nice. They really nailed the hop profile."
"Pours a clear burnt orange with fine sediment, with a thin off-white head, spotty lacing. Smell: spicy, lemon, green apple, nectarine, caramel in back, a little yeasty earthiness. Taste: piney, lemon peel, spicy with a vague tropical fruit flavor and cantaloupe beneath. Just a little mustiness. Bitter throughout with a very dry finish. I don't know that I'd pick it up again but it was enjoyable. Best before June 2010."
"A hazy golden amber color pour with a lasting foamy white head leaving plenty of jagged lacing , light carbonation . Aroma Is quite fruity , lots of apple skins , peaches. caramel , and citrus rhind , lots of yeasty slightly bready notes as well, a light hint of alcohol . Flavor is lightly malty and just sweet enough to balance the hops , lots of cirtus and orange type hops with very little bitterness , lightly earthy but very good flavor . Light to medium body with a very fresh clean mouthfeel . long dry slightly chalky finish, Very drinkable and quite sessionable . A nice brew ."
"Future outlook: OK stuff. I've got a few more, so we'll see how I feel about it after that...but I'm guessing my money will go elsewhere next time."
"Oh yeah, buy it, drink it, love it."
"Its winter and I normally don't drink pale ales in the winter, but I had to try it, and I'm VERY glad that I did. I wish this to become a permanent fixture in the flying dog line of fine beverages"
"d - Overall it was good IPA. Thought it hid the 8.3% ABV well, would definitely drink again."
"This is a great beer. I haven't had a ton of belgian IPAs, but I've had Houblon Chouffe. I feel like this isn't as ""big"" as that one. And I also didn't have that one fresh, so I shouldn't compare them. But anyway, give this beer a try if you see it."
"Overall, pretty decent. I like this a little better than Victory's Wild Devil, but they're very similar."
"D: A great one to try that I would have any as long is it were fresh, with out the hops I think this one wouldnt have been nearly as enjoyable so get em now"
"D - A better than average Belgian IPA - not sure what that means since I have probably only had enough to count on 2 hands, but the ale seems more bitter than the listed 60 ibus and tastes exactly like 8.3% if not higher- watch out for this bitch!"
"D- This is a great one you get the best of both worlds tied into one. Great winter warmer hides the 8.3 very well! I would like to go drink a sixer of this in the Tahoe snow..."
"D- Still not sure what exactly I think of this beer the flavors are bold and spicy. If the carbonation were a bit lighter it would be a bit more pleasant to drink."
"A must try!"
"D: this is a very well balanced beer and a very nice example of the style. I haven't been a huge fan of some of the other Belgian IPAs out there, but I am enjoying this one a lot. Excited to pick up a sixer of it."
"Drinkability insane one of those beers like Nugget Nectar that will disappear on you. Extremely easy going hoppy spicy brew that will keep you wanting more and more once you try it out. I used to love Frederick Brewing company when Wild Goose beers were widely available to me, I'm glad Flying Dog found a new home bringing out beer like this they should have no worries about their future in craft brewing."
"D: One of the best American examples of the style that I have ever had. They really nailed this one down. Their other Belgain offerings are subpar but this is a homerun. Way to celebrate 20 years. We still miss you Hunter."
"Drinkability is surprisingly high considering alcohol content and style. Flavors are balanced enough and refreshing enough to leave me wanting more after the first bottle."
"Seems to be a little lighter in the mouth with an elevated carbonation level. Some warming alcohol. Interesting, and enjoyable."
"D- A very interesting brew with huge hop flavor. Certainly worth checking out."
"If you like belgians and IPAs and can get on the bus of the two together this beer is not only for you but one you will likely think to reach for a second glass of, which I am going to do right now."
"Notes: This is certainly a surprise from Flying Dog. I do like quite a bit some of the stuff I've tried form them, and their average offering is typically a quality one. But here they have outdone themselves. I don´t know if the controversy with the name and design of this brew is relevant but it remains a great and very welcome offering in any case."
"Feels rich, creamy and dense. Mild carbonation makes it very drinkable and the price is very reasonable."
"Resinous, herbal hop flavor and bitterness up front. Hops become sappier and bitterer as the fruity (melon and pear), slightly sweet malt shows itself. Yeasty, funky character throughout. Aging hay, pine, and minty hop bitterness in the finish. Slightly warming. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Big and bold and definitely what we now call a Belgian IPA. Oh, and a steal at 8.99 a six pack!"
"It's a dark copper beer with white foam on top. There are some carbonation bubbles rising within. It leaves patchy lacing on the glass. The aroma is hoppy, slightly earthy and farm-like (recalls hay and other grains you'd find in a barn). As you'd expect, the taste is dominated by hops. It's mostly bitter, with some sweetness and detectable alcohol. The combination of sweet and bitter in the aftertaste is interesting, unexpected and very good (probably my favorite aspect of this brew). It has a medium body with a lot of carbonation. There is some mouth coating, but it disappears as you swallow. I find this to be pretty drinkable for a strong hoppy beer. I could easily drink a few glasses of this...slowly."
"D - Excellent. I wish i had more than just one bottle. Drinking one makes me want to drink two more, so maybe it is for the best that. Runaway beer chain reactions are not something to be messed with."
"A very interesting beer. The Belgian-style was pretty subtle, but loved the hop aroma and flavor. Overall a great beer."
"D- easy to finish and i will probably go back to grab a full sixer instead of just a single. flying dog seems to be hit or miss with me, and this is a hit for sure. probably the best beer ive had from them, and one of the best american examples of this style ive had yet. unfortunately, its a little too strong to drink all night. check it out, im impressed."
"Quite a nice beer here. On the high side of the hop scale for the style but I love it."
"D - This is a really nice Belgian IPA."
"Overall impression: One big yes. Very interesting and intense beer. Not very complex on its face, but very interesting how it all comes together. Definitely raging."
"Notes: Didn't get much of a ""Belgian"" sense here. More of a lighter American DIPA with a touch of spice."
"What's not to like about this beer? An IPA brewed with the glorious simcoe hop, finished with Belgian yeast. The beer will pour a golden orange hue that is topped with a sumptuous white head. The aroma of the simcoe hop and mild clove and coriander create a beautiful bouquet. As for the taste, this is easily one of the more satisfyingly flavorful yet refreshing IPA I have had for a long time. The Belgian IPA is a great trend for other breweries to catch on to, I look forward to see what other places have up their sleeve."
"Notes: the hops really dominate here and wish the yeast and fruitiness stood out a little more. could hardly tell there was anything belgian about it"
"I'm not sure what part of this is beligan. Otherwise, a decent beer that seems more like an American DIPA."
"CHEERS!!"
"D - Ok but definitely a sipper. Also, could get a bit heavy due to yeast content."
"Pours an opaque tan/light orange, almost the color of cream soda. White head that shows quite a bit of carbonation and moderate retention. Lots of fruit in the nose. Grapefruit and other citrus and sweetness. Lots of citrusy hop spiciness on the front. Classic Belgian spiciness on the back. It's like a flavor mullet! Palette seems about right for this beer, keeps it crisp, not too thick or thin. Really well balanced, no hint of the considerable alcohol. Overall a very good beer and worth the wait of finding it."
"This is a nice experiment from Flying Dog. Worthy of the purchase."
"The beer pours a golden honey color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is very floral, with some very perfumy hops backing the light fruity sweetness. Flavors replicate the nose, and I have to say this is one of the hoppier, bitter, domestic Belgain style IPA's I've tried. There is some underlying sweet white peach and honey, but the hops really come on strong in this beer, giving if a long, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is fairly light and drinkability is OK. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable then I would like, and I can't see myself having more then a single glass at a sitting. Still, this was a nice effort by Flying Dog; one of the more interesting beers I've had from them of late."
"Growler pour, clear medium dull amber, has an olive oil sheen to it, sits under a luxurious and creamy light khaki head, that stays and stays forever. Leaves thick frothy sheeting on the glass and rings of thick lace. Heavy/pungent tropical fruit/hop nose. Hopped up ale, fresh pineapple notes predominate. Not really getting whats all that Belgian about this one, perhaps some phenolic yeasty notes in the back ground, but mostly what I'm experiencing is a tasty, fruity, hoppy ale. Tasty and enjoyable, hop lovers will love this one, actually a real nice looking and smelling brew, but I'm not sure if they hit the note they were going for."
"Loved it!"
"D - Very solid. This went great with the free brats!"
"Pours strawish yellow with medium head and slight carbonation. The smell is fruity and slightly phenolic. The flavor is just an ester bomb - grapefruit, apricot, nutmeg. It's flowery, with jasmine, hibiscus, lilly. There is little bitterness, just fruit. Lovely. The mouthfeel is thin and refreshing"
"D - I thououghly enjoyed this. not for the faint of heart."
