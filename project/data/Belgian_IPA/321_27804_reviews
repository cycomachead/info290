"Overall, I didn't think it was a great as other reviewers, but certainly good."
""
"Overall, not bad in its category. I much prefer Duvel’s Triple hop to this one. I just don’t care for the hop flavor in this one. It really is an herbal bitterness. It’s not citrusy or piney, just more of a herbal bitter. I would pair this with a strawberry and bacon salad with a lemon vinaigrette. I gets a 90/100 from me."

"O - probably my favorite d'Achouffe brew. Possibly the standard I Hold all belgian ipa's to. It's ahead of its time, packed full of class, and down right delicious"

"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a light golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of yeast, spice, light hops. Taste is hops, alcohol, some mild malts, less complex than I expected. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a decent beer, but I was expecting whole lot more from this one."

"Not bad... Good masking of the alcohol content..."

"Houblon Chouffe truly is an oldie but a goodie. One of the original 'Belgian IPAs' it is still among - I'd argue the - best one out there. I don't remember ever having a single draft pour or bottle that left me smiling any less than ear to ear. If you don't care for this you don't care for the style."

"I liked this one well enough. Belgian yeast flavors with a nice subtle hop bitterness go along well with the classic tripel."
"Worth it's reputation."

"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Smooth and enjoyable Belgian.  Less bite than expected."

"Glass- Tulip"
"750 bottle with an enjoy by date of 09/2016 poured into a Teku. Dark hay color brew with a vigorous head. Nose is alcohol and isoamyl acetate. Taste profile is straightforward with familiar yet unique Belgian yeast, predominant cloves, and a nice splattering of hops. On the tongue, heavy carbonation keeps things light. Enjoyed drinking the whole bottle myself, and would again. It would be nice to see how more cellaring might mellow the booze and resin."
""
""
"Delicious, smooth, balanced, great feel, yum."
"This is a stylistic ménage a trois that blends together aspects of the English IPA tradition with the more aggressive American Imperial IPAs and Belgian brewing techniques. On the nose yeast driven esters and phenols wrestle with hop fruit and spice flavors over malt bread and sugar aromas. It pours a hazy straw gold with a pillowy 2” or more off-white foam cap that with proper care can perch above the lip of the glass like a fresh meringue. On the palate British IPA fruitiness and grain flavors wrestle with Belgian banana and bubble gum and both confront American DIPA levels of assertive hop bitterness. The beer has the Belgian body, coming across lighter and more digestible than a beer this big should be. The bottled versions are more highly carbonated and the carbonation comes across finer and softer than the tap versions. While the individual components stand out as you drink they come into focus and balance and in the end, by the finish they work surprisingly well. I prefer the 750 ml bottle to the tap version."
"O: Definitely a Belgian tripel, had more in commonwith Val Dieu or Straffe Hendrik tripel than any American IPA."
"Overall wow I can't believe I passed on this for so long! Pick it up even if it's 5-6 dollars!"

"Poured 23.4 oz bottle into std pint glass.  Nice big head with some retention.  Fairly clear light straw color.  Minor lacing.  Sour bready aroma, nice Belgian taste.  You can definitely pick up the Saaz in the aroma and taste.  Hangs on the palate appropriately.  Very nice choice."

"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  Giant sudsy head with a yellow gold body. Presents with a musky, piney nose. The taste is remarkable: everything you like about a Belgian ale combined with a hoppy IPA Lacing is incredible, from top to bottom. This is a unique beer that should be on everyone's bucket list."

"O – Very flavorful IPA, with the hoppy notes of an English IPA but the yeasty funk and foamy carbonation known in Belgian beers. Really interesting combo, where I stay interested long after the first (and second, and tenth) sip."

"Review based on the BJCP 2008 Aroma: intense hop aroma with floral and some citrus notes. Appearance: clear golden âmbar with persistent white head. Taste: balanced flavour between hops and malt, with tendency towards hops. Some fruit notes present with a lingering bitterness ending. Palate: nice medium body with no astringency and somewhat high carbonation. Overall: a very nice IPA / Tripel hybrid that everyone should taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am smelling pine, clove and yeasty aromas. The flavor of fruit and spice, grapefruit and lemon with a warm finish."
"OVERALL – A enjoyable beer, not a hop bomb or standard West Coast IPA, but one that I’d buy again if in a pinch while looking for an IPA."

"Final Grade: 4.62, a flawless A+. Houblon Chouffe is a positively fantastic Belgian IPA that I will definitely purchase again. I have had several Belgian-brewed BIPAs over the past month or so, and this one is definitely my favourite of the bunch. Delightfully rich and hoppy, yet shockingly quaffable - a must-try, and that is not a description that I bandy about lightly."

"O- The team at Brasserie D'Achouffe have themselves a winner in Houblon Choffe IPA Tripel. If assured of getting this as fresh as this bottle (purchased at Brewery Ommegang in Cooperstown, NY), this would be a staple. As such, I will check for bottling dates (Best By of which I think is two years) and will be certain to purchase within (3) months of it being bottled. Another feather in the cap for the Belgians using Pacific Northwest hops to brew a lofty beer! (4.5)"
""
""

"Overall a fabulous beer and one to be savored and enjoined. Extremely drinkable and wonderfully complex. I highly recommend this as one you absolutely must try."
""
"Excellent beer served draft in a tulip glass. Perfect lines after every sip. Nice frothy head on the beer. Appearance has golden wheat tint to it. Sweet floral hoppiness come at you. A little hint of honey in their as well. Smooth sweetness with a sight bitterness that is perfectly paired. Very smooth going down. Genuinely a delicious beer. Seasoned tripel and ipa drinkers will enjoy as well as a newbie."

"O: This one has it all. Bitter and sweet. Creamy and dry. Crisp and yet boozy. Awesome example of a diverse Belgian beer that displays hoppy American IPA flavors and the spicy, carbonated, dry characteristics of saison / farmhouse ales."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/16/2015. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright gold color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, pine, clove, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and citrus/earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, pine, clove, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spice/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange, pear, apple, white grape, light banana, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, pine, light clove, honey, bread, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and citrus/earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a really excellent Belgian IPA. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, pale malt, and citrus/earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Light golden in color. Beautiful rich, foamy, creamy head with great lacing. Flavors are floral, sweet, with a nice balance of hop bitterness keeping this beer grounded. Mouthfeel is light, delicate, airy, with a pleasing carbonation. Aromas and flavors are complex and subtle, and this beer does not taste as strong as it is. Very interesting example of a Belgian IPA. Would love to drink more of this."
"If you dont have expectation, try it. If you're a hophead, there a lot of belgian ipas on the market,..."
""

"Still overall this on tap is a great drink, but I was expecting magic compared to out of the bottle. Served too cold for my tastes, but still a great and personal favorite beer of mine."

"O:one of the better Belgian IPA's I've had and would have again. Hard to believe it is abv 9%, not very noticeable. As someone else described this beer, champagne IPA! Great brew, 4.2 stars"

"I knew this would be an interesting beer, as it combines my favorite style of beer with one of my least favorite styles. The combination actually works, although it is a bit more hopped up than I prefer. The triple part of adds complexity and flavors I like, although this is probably one of the most hopped up Belgian beers I have ever tried. Definitely worth trying out, glad I tried something a little different."

"Overall, a very delicious and quaffable Belgian ale. I love the tropical citrus married with Belgian yeast and this is probably the best Belgian IPA I have had."
""
"Another great beer from another great brewery.It's like hoppy champagne. What's not to like?"
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably."
""
"O: Right up there with Chimay - 4.5"
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Lots of effervescence, nice head, and plenty of lacing. Nose light hops and yeast. Yeasty character is very prominent, lemon pith is quite prominent as well. Overall this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"Still, as the beer warmed, it mellowed out a bit and I began to appreciate it a bit more."
"O: A little let down. Heard good things but basically got a weak tasting barleywine. No grassy or fruity hop characters. Maybe a fresher bottle would be better?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this beer, but prefer the Le Chouffe original ale, as the extra hop I. This beer covers up what makes Le Chouffe a truly great beer; a perfect combination on carbonation, Belgian yeast, and a slight hint of hop."

"Bottle from Proof Bottle Shop. Poured into a champagne glass. Tons of really bubbly off-white head with a slightly hazy orangy yellow color. Aroma is sweetly floral, grassy, and touch of yeasty goodness. Taste has a good hop bitterness, some spicyness, and with the same floral notes coming through. Also some light sweet malt and a good amount of the fruity-ness I associated with tripels. Very light on the tongue, but the bubbles and hop spice kinda bite at the tongue. I definitely enjoy this beer!"

"Had this seminal example of an ""IPA triple"" at a taphouse in Calgary. The beer arrived in a legit Chouffe goblet, a light orange with a little whitish foam. Smells of citrus hops, I get a lot of orange and pineapple, as well as aromatic buttery yeast, a few floral and spicy notes. Palate includes these features as well, along with some red berry (strawberry), peach/apricot, green grapes, and a hint of toffee. A fair amount of residual sweetness and overall I get a strong boozy pineapple effect. Sweet grains provide a backdrop, a little like honeyed pancakes, and then boom, you get a powerful medicinal blast of mixed herbs, coriander, bitter roots and leaves, licorice, a little clove. I love massive IPAs and yet I was still a bit awestruck by the bitter woody finish. I agree that the alcohol is well-concealed at first, but I started getting a fusel burn or some ethyl acetaye about halfway through, at which point the bitter finish started to seem coarse and overpowering. Still, deserves some of the accolades."

"I will say though, that I'm VERY disappointed that the subsequent bottles I've had here in North American have not evoked the same blissful memories I had at this fateful bar in Vancouver. The bottles I've found here have a similar sweetnesss/citrus flavor but lack the hops. I'm not sure if they brew it here, or it's a bottling issue (in Europe it's equally as good). But find this on-tap and please try it. It is simply amazing."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is great. You have the Tripel components and also hoppy notes as well. This beer is balanced with not an assault of hops on your tongue, but enough to let you know they are there. If you like hop resin in your beer, this should be no problem punishing. The alcohol is very well masked. If you like Hoppy ales and Belgian ales, there is no reason why you haven't tried this one yet. This is Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: Different. Had to try it with the description of a Tripel IPA."
""
""
"O- I like how the hops tame the yeast in this Tripel. It works."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not so sure about the ""tends to IPA"" statement, but definitely a little dryness behind the mildy fruit flavors."
""
""
""
""
"(4.25) D: This is one of those that can quickly creep up on you considering how easily drinkable it is. Still can’t get over how well balanced and well executed the two styles are."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A hoppy and complex Tripel. Hops enforcements have suited much better here than average for the style, but do not expect a DIPA, it is definitely Belgian."
"Overall: This one is pretty unique. Hop character is very american IPA-ish but then comes the spicy, yeasty part with soft malt character. Works well together and creates a wonderful dynamic. Recommended."

"This is definitely an interesting hybrid style beer that was pleasing to my palate and will certainly motivate me to sample more Belgian IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"nowhere near as hoppy as an American ipa, but that's okay, because this beer is balanced and drinkable and delicate even at 9% abv. it pours a lovely pale straw color, clear, bubbly, and accumulating a massive white fluffy head with good staying ability. the nose is hoppy sure, but its light in a way too, fruity, not too bitter, and balanced out well by potent Belgian yeast and some wheat malt. not sweet at all, wondering if this tripel style skipped the candy sugar, it finishes clean, yeasty, and hop forward, balanced, but all elements contribute in a distinct way. grassy vibe too, fantastic stuff, and you cannot taste the booze at all. really light body and typical Belgian yeast effervescence. yum"
""
""
""
"Probably the best Belgian IPA. It's a style that can get messy, but this one works."
""
""
""
""
"Bravo! Bravo I say!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is an amusement park for your mouth: The casual drinker will enjoy it for the adventureous hops profile. The keen, observant drinker will giggle in delight at the simple sublety of this beer. Rich and savory, with simple, but satisfying esters....a lingering hops exploration on multiple levels, perfectly balanced with the sweet barley body....you should definitely try this one."

"A smooth enjoyable drink. More tripel than IPA. Tricky balance more towards the malt like a British IPA."
""
""
"On draft at the Old Monk in Dallas."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice tripel with a light IPA influence from the hops. One of the better Belgian IPAs out there for the sole reason that it allows the Belgian influence to rule instead of the IPA side. Definitely a classic and probably the innovator/inventor of the 'style'"
""
""
""
"The beer's taste matches its outstanding appearance in terms of quality, but it is surprising in its dusky, deep character. The finish is light on the palate, but only after an initial sensation that is neither sweet nor bitter, but rather, and simply, serious. Woody, it is. Pithy. ""IPA"" is in the name, but this is not at all what the term would lead those raised on contemporary American craft IPAs to expect. The taste is as bold as the Americans', but is distinctly different. And, did I mention the head?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one expertly crafted beer. One that I will enjoy over and over again. I'm not sure of the age on this bottle but I'd love to get a fresh one. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile, finally getting around to it it's even better than expected. Exceptional!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -  Just a fantastic beer, one of the very best if not the best in the style, that has the ability to quench thirst, enjoy a a fine sipper and can serve any purpose in between meeting the approval of Belgian lovers, hopheads and just about anyone in between. World class all the way."
""
""
"O: I'm very familiar with Tripels but never had a Tripel that is apparently hopped like an IPA. Very delicious. If I come across this again I will definitely purchase."
""
"O - Wow! This is some good stuff. Definitely amongst the best beers I've ever had."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really nice and smooth, and very well balanced. You can enjoy everything this beer has to offer. Doesn't drink like a 9% beer, very floral and smooth, you can really take nice full sips and enjoy. A truly great beer."
"Received a bottle as a gift. I can't believe I waited several weeks before drinking this. It pours as a light-orange golden color, with a magnificent foam head that sticks around like frosting on the top of the beer. Has a very pleasant crisp lemon peel scent. A nice bitter feel at the beginning of each sip, but it as it goes down the taste transitions smoothly to a classic tripel. This is a truly amazing beer. It doesn't seem to suffer from the same angel-devil feel as a lot of hoppy belgian beers. I'll be looking for this again."

"O- Overall I would consider this a world class beer. The color is perfect to the Tripel Style where the hop flavor takes over in the finish and accents the West Coast IPA style. The English side in this beer is the overall balance between the two. Perhaps all three styles are accented in a sense. That's why I consider this to be phenomenal."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: A creative and well executed beer combining American IPA hopping with Belgian Tripel malt and yeast character. Grapefruit and orange hop bitterness with heavy pale malt and Belgian yeast character. This is definitely one of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer never disappoints. The complexity between the hop and yeast profiles is awesome and it all melds into a final product that any beer enthusiast must try. I think I'll pick up a four pack soon. The fact that this is 9% is also absurd, I think I drank 75% of the beer in like 8 minutes."
""
""
"Spectacular beer. Would have again without a second thought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Interesting IPA Tripel – there is a lot going on here – lots of complex flavors and aromas and a good amount of alcohol. Classic Brew."
"Overall: coming into this I had a little bit of a preview at the brewery, and I enjoyed it then. Having it as a whole bottle, it was really enjoyable. The hoppy character is actually refreshing since the body is a medium. I would definitely have this again and would definitely recommend it to a friend. Hopefully I'll run into it again. Cheers!"
""
""
"Beer was a pale straw color and a little hazy when served. Definitely smelled the phenolic spiciness from the yeast in the nose. I do not like a ton of the clovey flavors in my Belgians, this one had just enough to let you know it was a Belgian without being obnoxious. A little more hops would have made this beer a solid 4.0."
"The flavor is smoothly lemony, with a floral note. It pops and crackles yet finishes smooth and spry. Really enjoyable."
""
""
""
"This tripel ipa is OUTSTANDING. Highly recommended to anyone who loves sweet, herbal, champagne-like taste. This beer goes incredibly well with smoked sausage, pretentious hamburgers (wagyu beef with sharp cheddar cheese and caramelized onions with some garlic), and everything pizza; this beer is amazing"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the most fun beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. A sensory roller-coaster ride. A perfect harmony of over-the-top American-style hop aggression and deft Belgian brewing technique. Very heady, yet supremely drinkable. This will go down as one of my highest rated beers, and for good reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Having really high expectations as La Chouffe is one of my favorite Belgians, it surpassed them. On par with normal La Chouffe this is a great example of a Belgian IPA. A world class beer that everyone should try."
""
""
""
"Fairly bitter hop notes, with nice, complex yeast esters and a hint of funk. A little too bitter dominant for my palate, but I love the esters."
" Its a good beer. It doesn't strike me as amazing though. It is easy to enjoy. My palate keeps taking me back to a sushi restaurant (on that note, it would probably pair great with most seafood)"

"Hazy bright orange colour, one finger of solid white head, good lace here also. Smell is a nice mix of yeast with lots of hops, orange and some grassy-lemon, fruity, as well as a bit of spice here as well. Taste is big and hoppy upfront, fairly bitter mixed with yeast and tropical fruits, orange and pineapple, spicy yeast flavours and hops in the finish and aftertaste. Medium carbonation, prickly with a softer lush medium body. A fantastic hoppy belgian beer, ABV not noticed and very drinkable, could certainly drink a lot more of this."
""
""
""
"Straw yellow in color and hazy. Poured with a short, fizzy white foam that quickly reduced to a soapy cap. Citrus lemon zest aroma with light orange and tangerine in the background along with bready malt. Medium bodied with rich, lazy, tangy carbonation. Smooth feel down the middle with carbonation along the edges. Bitter citrus and herbal hops are dominant with bready malts, funky yeast, bread and a touch of banana beneath. A nice variety of delicate, distinguishable flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Light and refreshing. Balances the IPA & Triple style to offer the fruity/yeasty triple profile with hops that compliment the style. Easy to drink and light enough for a lunch without noticeable alcohol. I could see drinking this along side a blue cheese & micro greens salad, the crisp tartness would be a solid foundation for creamy and earthy cheese."
""
""
""
""
"o-a nifty little marriage of some sweet, hickory smoked bacon and fruit. charming and endearing, would pair well with chicken or fish. well crafted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll definitely need to find a fresh bottle because I know that Chouffe is way better than the score I've got for this old bottle. Tripels can have this amazing ability to hold onto the hops flavor and aroma for a couple years and aroma but this bottle tastes like it's a an old American Double IPA. Unfortunately there was no date on the label to assist me when I bought it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'd like to try this on tap. Would love to have it fresher to see if more of the hops come through. Otherwise, I wont be spending so much $ on this beer again."
"Didn't blow me away, but interesting for sure. Might need a full glass of this stuff for a better assessment."

"O: Great balance of a traditional Belgian Tripel and IPA. Nice to see the hops as a star here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first Belgian-made Belgian IPA, and it is quite different from what I am used to in the US, where they are just American IPAs with Belgian yeast. This is more like a Belgian Strong Pale/Golden Ale, with a lot more spiciness. I like it. A lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The most balanced and perfectly composed Belgian IPA I've had. The hops lend flavor without too much bitterness messing up the Belgian profile underneath. More sophisticated and tasty than Piraat and Duvel Tripel Hop."

"Overall: What an incredible beer. Everything is tightly balanced on all departments. It has a simple and pleasant smell, an interesting and refreshing taste and a very nice texture. One of the best Belgian beers on the market, definitely a must try."

"Crazy interesting to say the least. The head just sits there for minutes like a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Wonderfully smooth, complex hints of citrus at first, then as it warms the banana releases from the yeast. The alcohol is subtle, and the finish is crispy and bold. I would suggest this beer for anybody who like me has a wary view of IPAs, but these Belgians have constructed a fine tripel that just wants to be enjoyed. The fullness of the look in the glass, slightly cloudy, bekons for the adventure ahead. Not sure how I missed this fine beer for so long, but glad we found each other."

"Price Point - $9.99/750ML bottle"
"O: Solid Belgian beer. Interesting take on a tripel. 9.0% ABV is excellently well hidden - sneaky, as you would expect a good tripel to be. Didn't see a freshness date on the bottle. I think the hops have somewhat faded in this bottle, but something I'd definitely try again. Not sure if I would pay $7 however."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A great beer which I will now continue to have as often as possible. This will be my ""go to Belgian Ipa"" whenever I'm caving a hop bomb with a Belgian twist. Also, a good intro beer for those non-Belgian, all american Ipa drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've been looking forward to trying this for sometime. Definitely didn't dissappoint, smell is amazing, taste and mouthfeel are really good as well, an interesting combination, this is more on the triple side, hops actually become more prominent as the beer warms, but it does achieve a really nice balance in its profile. Try it."
"O: This is a very tasty beer, but not one of the best that I have ever had."
""
""
""
"Sitting on a cloud of judgement... Pours up a cloudy honey golden with a big white head. Great lacing. Nose of honey, lemons, and poop pops. Tastes of lemons, honey, white pepper. Body is medium. Carbo is smooth. I got this beer as a Christmas gift. Woooop!"
""
""
"O. This is just a really pleasant and truly refreshing brew. Highly suggest, even for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light golden amber with a huge half glass of white foamy head with good retention, dissipating eventually to pillowy lacing. Aroma of spicy orange, sweet malt, Belgian yeast and spices. Flavor is peppery light fruit and citrus, tripel spicing with an emphasis on coriander, finishing with a pleasant well hopped bitterness complemented by the spices. Medium bodied with active carbonation. This is a very nice melding of the tripel and IPA styles, and great to drink, like other Chouffe ales."
""
""
"O-This might be my favorite of the Chouffe family, which is saying something. The taste is complex and always evolving in your mouth, but the flavors integrate really well. Unlike some mixed styles, this beer's flavors never clash and it feels like the flavors were meant to go together. This one really clicked for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a class beer - the bottle says tripel and IPA: the beer straddles the two style elegantly, leaning toward the body and feel of a tripel, while being more in-line with the (Belgian) IPA in flavor and aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The jury is still out with this one. One doesn't know if the beer is fresh or stall or what. I would tend to thick they don;t sell much so I'm thinking it's old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty great. will definitely try this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my faves of the style. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- try it. A lot of American breweries are putting out Belgian IPAs, and this is my current standard for them."
""
""
"O- The most unique IPA I have had so far. Very different from all the other IPAs I have tried, but it seems to take the best qualities of an IPA and Tripel. An awesome combination of American hops and Belgian yeast. One of those beers you’ll never forget! Will definitely enjoy this brew again!"
""
"This is a fascinating beer. It seems to combine all the best traits of an IPA, a Tripel, and a Barleywine. It is crisp and refreshing, yet also quite strong and assertive. It demands your attention, yet also manages to accompany almost effortlessly whatever you happen to be doing. It is very complex, yet still seems accessible. I will definitely try this again sometime. It is one of the more enigmatic beers I have encountered."
"Pours a beautiful cloudy copper orange color with a thick, bubbly head. Scent is mild but has hints of wheat, citrus, and tame hops. Taste is rich, creamy, and delicious. First you get a full flavor of citrus and wheat which then turns into a slight bite of hops. Also contains hint of banana within the yeast taste. Finishes slightly dry. Overall this is delicious and complex. A world class beer well deserving of its rating."
"Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel pours a mildy hazy sunshine yellow. Three fingers or so of white foam rise up to top the beer. Head retention and lacing are both decent, but neither particularly impresses. The nose isn't too potent, but it does have some pleasant apricot/fruity and earthy/spicy aromas. The flavor is a much better display of the fusion between tripel and IPA that makes up this beer. Pear and apricot stone fruit esters open things up, and fade beautifully into some more tropical fruity hoppiness. The bitterness that rolls through next is notable, but not overly aggressive. The finish is the same earthy, spicy, noble hop note from the nose, I'm guessing courtesy of the Saaz hops. If a little bit of a phenol presence could ave been integrated the beer would be just about perfect. The mouthfeel was a little bit of a letdown. Simultaneously, the body was a little chewy and the carbonation fell a bit on the dull side. That aside, Houblon Chouffe is a great Belgian IPA, displaying the harmonies that can exist between American hopping and Belgian yeast strains."
"Overall (4.5): This is great right now, and if I’m not mistaken this actually isn’t as fresh as it could be. When it’s super-fresh, it can have a bracing, pithy bitterness that almost distracts from everything else going on. Right now, it’s balanced and has a mixture of fruity, spicy, pithy hops and an equally complex, well-put together yeast profile. Meanwhile, the malt body stays on the side of BSPA (rather than Tripel), which suits this mixture of hops. This is just really well done. A great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very ""light"" and quaffable mouthfeel for what I expected to be a cloying beast from d'Achouffe."
""
"Overall this is certainly not what I was expecting. Very hop-forward with little malt to back it up. Would imagine this pairs great with an array of cheeses. Would love to try this fresh on tap."
""
""
"Overall this wasn't a total hit for me. I am just not a fan of overly yeast/spicy Belgian ales with this much hop character. The flavor profile just clashes for me, not as ""off"" as some Belgian IPAs I have had but there are few examples of this style that really succeed in my opinion."
"Hazy straw color thin bubbly bright white head. Extremely floral nose. Sweet honey and eldeberry upfront with bright tropical fruits. Peppery clove and flowers. Honey suckles. Finishes extremely floral dry and clean with a touch of alcohol. Not a beer to mess around with. Complex layers of flavors, bold and brash. Rough around the edges but concise. Faint bitterness lingers a bit, lots of flowery hops on the back end, hoppy resin balances alot of these sweet belgian notes. quite amazing."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, carbonation just enough to be lightly prickly. Flows simply and quickly down, leaving no coating, but drying as it goes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, what an interesting beer! as i pour the last little bits into the still mushrooming cloud, i watch the effervescence and nuclear fission as the liquid breaks the cloud line, dives to the bottom and returns to the cloud line joyfully. i'm not even buzzed yet; sorry. the slowly receding foam leaves a sticky,starchy residue on the sides with only an island left of hard foam in the middle. hard, stucco-like protrusions are still hanging off the sides where the foam was pressed against the glass. while still not a fan of hoppy brews, i'm finding i can drink them a little more easily and actually enjoy some of the better ones . . . ."

"O: Solid tripel. Not the best I've ever had, but worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste was dissapointing. Drinks like a 5% pilsner with barely a hint of alcohol and a dissapointing finish. I think this beer does not travel well, as it is currently summer here in the US and the bottle is pale green. Why oh why would a brewer work hard than bottle in a green bottle and send his product 1/2 way around the world? I would love to try it in Belgium, I bet its fantastic. Will try again but my hopes aren't too high."
""
""
"O/D-Took me far too long to try this, but I had to drink some sort of IPA on National IPA Day. Great beer. Don't always love Belgian IPAs but this is obviously a gem and a legendary brew. Happy to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I’m going to seek out a fresher bottle. I had this beer a couple of years ago and it was an entirely different experience. That said, this was still one of the best smelling beers I’ve encountered in awhile."
""
"O: While it's not the best Belgian IPA I've ever had, it definitely brings a lot to the table. I'm glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty and very enjoyable, I could sip on this beer for quite a while. The alcohol is well hidden in this beer but it could sneak up on you."
""
"O - I was pleasantly surprised to see this one at Whole Foods and scooped one up. Belgian IPA is one of my favorite styles, but this one drank more like a tripel. There wasn't really a hop bite or spicy finish. This was a longtime want, but I was a little bit disappointed."
""
""
""
""
"Mostly full body with a drying aspect, medium effervescence and a slight warming after the swallow. Worth trying but not buying a sixer of it."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly murky honey orange-tan with an off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, yeast, spice, and some hop aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice hoppy presence."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy straw color with a white head. The aroma has a bit of wheat, as well as some grass and orange citrus notes. The flavor is very similar. There is a good bit of toffee and wheat, as well as some grass and citrus in the flavor. The bitterness is fairly low, but the spiciness and yeast-like character is quite high. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable. Nice balance and degree of sweetness. The hops are light but the beer is nicely done otherwise."
""
"Yellowish orange with sticky lacing and a head that remains around the outter rim the whole way down. Smells of hop and fruit, kinda like dried banana smells but good. Tastes of banana and hops with great balance. The mouth feel is one of best I ever had especially being a Belgian...liking mostly American ales!! Goes down so smooth I'll have another for sure!! Love it"
""
"Another pretty good beer with a lot of little things going on, I wish more American brewers beers would evolve into stuff like this, but at the same time not exactly like this, we already have this, just saying."
"The taste is all sweet malt at first.I tried to find any sort of flavor, but I get nothing. no funk, no hops, no yeast esters. Nothing, at all. Super powdery sweet, with nothing to accent it. Rather disappointing for what should be (and sounds like) a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"I liked that I was able to review this beer. It is about time."
"Damn, I love this completely outdated beer! I have tasted it fresh on tap, but only in a small sip. Time to go back and see what this beast can do when its hops are still alive!"
""
""
""
"O: good beer very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Very interesting and quite hoppy, but not in a ""smash your palate to nothing"" American way. Don't get me wrong, I like American IPAs and DIPAs, but this was a nice change - the hops are the main event with this beer, but, they are carefully balanced with a solid malt backbone that is more than just sweetness. Very drinkable - had help with the bottle but drank most of it and I know I want more sips to tease out more of the flavors and to continue to enjoy all that this beer is. Very good and something I'll try to pick up again."

"This is a fine IPA with Belg written all over it. It does not have the maltiness of an American IPA or a British for that matter but has the light effervecent feel of a belgian. Classic in that you don't realize the alcohol is 9%. But the taste is clean. Yeast, malt, hops, and alcohol are all balanced to present itself as a wholy different packge. This is brewing subtlty. It is like recognizing a police sobriety block and slipping into your jail cell and then waking up at the ritz"
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice balance between citrus IPA and the Belgian tripel. Amazingly well balanced and well presented."
"This is actually less strange than I expected. It has the heart of a tripel, with some IPA touches. I would personally categorize this as a tripel rather than Belgian IPA. Regardless, it's tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is fairly unique in terms of the various components it brings to the table across the board from the appearance to the aromas to the flavors... I can't say this will become a staple, but I enjoyed it, will explore the style more and will certainly re-visit."
"Overall this is a really great cross between Belgian and American brewing traditions."
""
""
"This is one thats...good, but I don't see myself revisiting it. It might appeal more to those familiar in the Belgian IPA's, but I'm not feeling this one much."

"I'm not one prone to hyperbole. My students know that, though I'm not a harsh grader, I rarely ever hand out A's or A+'s. But this is as close to a perfect beer as I've had. The hazy golden-yellow color and medium-thick head simply looks the way beer should look. Inhaling the aromas of hops and hay makes one think of a walk through a Wallonian field in spring. I'm talking some flowers-and-grass-on-a light-breeze shit. Round, delicious hops obviates any comparisons to non-beer flavors. This ale tastes like ale and I mean that in the best way possible."
""
""
""
"O: This is a great one, folks. I’m so happy that a Belgian brewer is using some good ol’ American hops; it’s really the malt bill and yeast interplay that attracts me to Belgian beer, while it’s the hop varieties that I’d describe as one of my favorite parts of American beer. And this, my friends, is a beautiful combination of those two brewing traditions."
""
""
""
"O - Everything about this beer is one of a kind. More of a cousin than a brother to the American IPA. I've had Belgium IPAs that still had many characteristics of an American IPA but this should be the standard for BIPAs."
"I wish I had tasted the regular La Chouffe more recently, or that I had tasting notes to compare."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. Not quite up there with Lupulus or Duvel Tripel Hop, which for me are the Belgian IPAs par excellence. However, still very tasty and a great beer to drink on this first really nice day of the year!"
""
""
"Hazy, straw colored. Well carbonated. Foamy mountainous head. Awesome looking beer. Smells strong of floral soft hops (most likely Hallertau). *Be sure to smell it the moment it's poured as it dissipates quickly. Bit more subtle than a ""normal"" IPA. After a while the yeast aroma really comes through. I don't give it a 5 only because of pungency, which very well have to do with the 3500 mile distance this beer traveled to my glass. Bitterness is solid and suiting. Doesn't scorch at all, quite soft aftertaste. Great grainy flavors in the body. High carbonation lend a pleasant acidity. The booze is remarkably well hidden. Always have, and I probably always will love this beer. Really how I learned to appreciate Belgian beers in general."
""
""
"O-a delicious tripel with a nicely balanced flavor"
"On draft at Duvel tasting room. Poured into houblon tulip. Small bubbles but huge white head. High retention.  Sticky soapy lacing. Blond, hazy body. Aroma is fruity, grapefruity and yeasty. Awesome. Taste follows suit with the aromas. One of my favorite beers....ever. Pairs well with most any cheese btw. "

"The Amarillo and Tomahawk hops add character and potency to the already impressive base; while the yeast and craftsmanship make this more enjoyable then all but the very apex of domestic versions of the style."

"Overall, a fine Belgian classic. A must have for anyone who appreciates Belgian ales."
""
"Overall – This is a nice example of a Belgian triple. A little dry for my taste, but quite nice none the less."
""
""
"In my opinion, this is the gold standard for Belgian IPAs-fantastically complex, awesome yeast character and a nice hop profile as well. Kick ass."
""
"O/D - Delicious, very nice and simple to drink. A great Belgian IPA with all the requisite flavours to make it very memorable."
""
""
""
"D - This one drinks like a decent tripel with some stale hops notes. Totally disappointed, especially for the price (and the fact that half of it spilled on the counter)."
""
""
"O - I'm pretty certain this tastes loads better when fresh. Still, this was interesting enough and very drinkable. It's a Belgian Tripel with a solid hoppiness!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I really like this beer. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but it's amazingly good. In the bottle, it tastes every bit as good as a dry-hopped IPA on tap (better in most cases). The candy-like aftertaste gives it a character I find appealing."
"O: Simply a phenomenal beer. Apparently it's a tripel blended with a Belgian IPA that uses some American hops? It works incredibly well. Highly recommended. Will drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, delicious beer. Great style and great flavor. Definitely reccommend."
""
"O- Really good. More flavors develop as it warms, but it's refreshing as well as strong. best enjoyed as a sipper."
""
""
""
"Dr: Highly drinkable for the ABV in spite of its mouthfeel problem. It features some pleasant flavours that are balanced well, and feels quite experimental, but it never reaches a level of being unique or special. I might try it on draught in Belgium, but it's not anywhere near good enough to consider paying a high price for as an import again. This brewery has better beers."
""
""
"O - Great Belgian hop offering - rare as they are. I'm not one for hoppy beers generally, but this is one I'd be glad to see show up in my glass anytime, although I don't know that I'll ever run out and buy one."
"Huge fluffy head, and the fluff lasts a while. Scent is hops, citrus, and a touch of alcohol. Nice bubbles, cloudy. Taste is awesome, hops taste really fresh for a Belgian. Malty backbone good citrus hops. Hard to describe flavors except perfect IPA, nice Belgian yeast flavors and wow these suds stick around a long time. Top notch and highly recommended!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, this is one of the best, if not the best Belgian IPA's i have came across. and the alcohol is unnoticeable."

"o: it's an alright tripel, lacked any hop presence for something that is suppose to be an ipa."
"O: 3.5"
""
""

"Drink- A very big beer. It's highly peppery, yeasty and damp, dank lemon. I enjoyed it but really wish this one would've been a smaller version. I'll probably come back to this one for sure."
""
""
"O- Where has this beer been all this time! I have no one to blame but myself. I've probably passed this on the shelf hundreds of times but I finally decided to pick it up...and I'm glad I did. Very tasty brew, well done."
""
""
""

"O - I am normally not a big fan of DIPA's, but this one has my attention, very very good. The body could have been a bit thicker though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you can procure a fresh bottle in Belgium that might be the way to go. I wasn't as wowed by this bottle as I was over there, but there still isn't much of a fault in this thing even after months and months of sitting around in transport and the store shelf in a green bottle. Lots of sediment that rears its head after the first glass."
""
""
"The taste's very distinctive of the european tradition for this beer. I shared this with a friend who thought it would be similar to the American IPA. I had to correct him, but I thought this beer was a very well-brewed one. There was not any odd aftertaste nor was it too over-carbonated, as i thought it run the risk of being."
""
"O- A very interesting beer and the first actually Belgian ""Belgian IPA"" I've tried. Definitely worth a try, it's very cool to see a Belgian old-school response to a style that has become so dominated by the West Coast."

"This is a great example of what a Belgian IPA can accomplish. The hops didn't step on the yeast and vice versa. Balance is good, but the malt bill was solid and complimented the hops and Belgian yeast well. The lacing was really extraordinary and truly reminded me of the lace hanging in the windows of shops in Brugge. A great break from the monotony of west coast IPAs, Achouffe shows another flavor in the spectrum of IPAs as a style."

"The feel of this beer is smooth and medium bodied and is so well received that this is what a brewer looks to achieve each time they mash in: a beer that seems to be in harmony with itself from start to finish. This is balanced and enjoyable."

"O: In the end this is a great beer. I'd 9/10 prefer a west coast IPA. That being said it's a really interesting amalgamation of a tripel and an IPA. A touch too sweet for me though."
"Overall: I really enjoy this ale. I am happy I found it at a small little bottle shop by my place. I will be picking some up soon, probably tomorrow and the next day, and a few day after that. ITS GOOD!!!!"
"Very unique beer with the taste of tripel yet hopped up to an IPA feel . The hops are in balance with the citrus notes in the tripel side of things. I found it way too drinkable for the ABV and the whole beer had a light handed touch to the proceedings ( almost a summer beer in feel). I will buy this again as along with De Ranke xx this is one of fave Belgian IPAs"
"Overall – The alcohol is very well hidden and this beer is really easy to drink. The flavours are not as in your face as I thought they would be, but everything is well balanced and tasty. My bottle says best before end of 2011, so maybe I should have opened this a little sooner to see if the hops were more present. I'll buy it again for sure."
"Good brew. The whole IPA Tripel name threw me off a little bit. Hard to tell what style to compare against. Either way it is solid. Lots of complexity while staying crisp and refreshing."
"Taste is nice. I always take anything listed as a Belgian IPA for what it is. As a hop head I prefer the American IPAs. The hops on this beer are presant, but they are not very aggressive. The banana and passion fruit are more dominant than the hops. Tastes more like a belgian pale than an IPA... but that is just my opinion. I am a typical american that wants the hops to slap me around a little. Still a very nice and enjoyable drink. Always a fan of d'Achouffe."
"Pours a light gold color w/ a two finger white pillowy head. Excellent carbonation and lacing. Very cloudy in appearance. The carbonation is almost like a little tornado in my snifter- a life of its own. The nose is lemon, malt, yeast, hops, and some clove. Not as strong as I'd expect- but still a masterpiece from the smell. It kind of smells like a lemon dessert to me- but not too sweet. Taste is hoppy, but also has a huge malt backbone on it as well. Everything on this beer just works. Very smooth/bitter aftertaste as well. Overall, this is a really fantastic beer, and a great example of the style."
"Huge monster head that threatens to overflow my duvel tulip. Body is hazy golden yellow that is borderline too light. Smell is heavy on the belgian yeast. Bananas aplenty! Lemony zing and juicy grapefruit. The juicy grapefruit is quite prominent as well as a dose of peppery notes and a twist of banana. Good balanced belgian ipa. A tab bit ofheat hits the throat."
"O: Very well crafted Belgian IPA, or should I say Tripel? Whatever you want to classify it as, it is pretty amazing."
"Overall, this is an exceptionally well balanced beer, and it manages to flawlessly blend characteristics of a good Belgian Tripel AND and an American style Double IPA. Fantastic beer!"
"{revised with new tasting in Dec. 2012)."
"M: medium body, fine carbonation, and sharp bitterness. "
"Drinkability: Quite high. I’ve had this before from time to time and enjoyed it, but in focusing on it for purposes of this tasting I’m incredibly impressed; this is a great beer."
"O: A great tasting beer... Just a little pissed of about the gushing!"
"O - The original Belgian IPA. Understandable why this style has been replicated by the likes of flying dog and hardknott. Goes well with chilli con carne."
"O: Even though my tastes have changed over the years, this is still pretty much the beer I remember it to be."
"This was the strangest IPA I've had yet. It was the most complex and didn't have the punch from the hoppy bitterness anywhere. It's a good beer, but different."
"A tasty Belgian IPA, and one I remember liking more than this variant on tap."
"D - This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I love both IPAs and Belgians, and this is a perfect combination of the two. The drinkability is high and the taste is exceptionable. I will be buying more as soon as possible. Also has one of the best beer labels around."
"Overall it is a good beer. I don't recommend this beer after drinking something sweet. But a solid IPA."
"Overall: Best I've had of the style. It's such a young new style of beer that I hope I try better in the future."
"This beer poured out with a big foamy white head on top that laid on top of a cloudy golden yellow colored liquid underneath. The lacing was decent here leaving to scattered bubbles on the glass. The smell of the beer was a hoppy blend of an IPA and a spicy Tripel. The aroma had some spice, some hops and some earth to it. The taste had a strong bitterness upfront that was mellowed out but the earthy spices in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer was retty nice, it had a pretty good thickness to it and plenty of carbonation. Overall I found this been to be pretty good. I would drink this one again."
"Side note: I'd be interested to see what Stone/Chouffe could do if they collaborated on a Belgian IPA. I'd love to see that happen!"
"Overall, while I like the attempt that was made to combine Belgian and IPA flavors, in this case the result was less than perfect."
"Overall: Nice to drink sometimes"
"Medium carbonation and medium body, appropriate. As far as this style goes it's really the only game in town."
"Just the best hops. The product for the product. Without distorting it. Just the sublime. A classic IPA."
"This is an excellent Belgian. I will be back if I can."
"Brilliant; simply brilliant."
"I would bring this beer to a party or showcase it at a tasting."
"The smell is of belgium yeast esters, there are some citrus hops. The mouth is medium and very carbonated. The taste is harder to describe, there is some hoppiness up front, there is a little sweetness mid way, maybe a hit of some spices, clove or cinnamon, some funkiness, followed by some alcohol burn, and a little dryness and bitterness as an after flavor. Not nearly as much hops as I expected, this might be about the same level as orval hop wise."
"Side note: I recommend drinking this beer significantly warmed than the 40-45 degrees that is recommended for this style, as the second glass poured from this bomber was infinitely better than the first, and is the one I used for this review."
"O: good beer. Last time for me though."
"Pours a pale yellow, nice frothy head and retention. Aroma of resiny, pine hops and a muted belgian yeast fruityness and some lemon. In the flavor, a nice earthy bite from the hops, almost piney but not quite. The Ahtanum hop employed leaves a big bitterness and the earthy pine note. Pale malts and a fruity yeast presence. Alcohol is very light in the flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, smooth and a good level of carbonation. Overall, this was an above average Belgian IPA. Lovely stuff."
"Pours a hazy light gold color with a tight white head. Very sweet, pilsen malt aroma with a small amount of hop pushing through, surrounded by yeasty fruitiness. Seemingly light body for 9%with moderate carbonation and heavy lacing. Citrus hop flavors surrounded by candy sweetness. Decent amount of alcohol warming at the back of the tounge and throat."
"O- Drinkability is very good, no alcohol is to be found and freshness is king. The beer, though, lacks both the complexity of a classic belgian strong ale and the true bitter character of an american ipa"
"This is an excellent beer, complex, tasty, and with an active and interesting mouthfeel. It was a pricey growler, but I knew it would be worth it, since finding this on tap around here is certainly a rarity. I've never had bottled, though I've seen it in the store and will make sure to give it a try to see how it compares to this beer on tap."
"D - excellent drinkability as I like the combination of tripel spices with hops."
"A solid triple with extra hops, was tested with the bottled version. Were actually quite different in taste. The on-tap was better."
"O: Extremely interesting beer as I am more of a fan of hoppy IPAs and ESBs than tripels. Maybe the beer could have been a little tighter with the flavors, but possibly the beer I had was starting to pull apart flavor wise. Regardless, its a recommendable beer."
"There is a certain smoothness at first too. It’s almost like you are drinking a fruit juice or something. I wouldn’t say thick… but close. Regardless, this is a great beer, a wonderful addition to the 1001 Bottles list, and one that I will totally buy again. I wonder if they make this on draft? Bottoms up everyone!"
"Overall: I will be buying this one and the rest from this brewery as this was my first from them as well as my first Tripel. A must try."
"O: Belgian IPA's have always confused me a bit, they seem to be a hybrid of other belgian styles. That said, I really enjoyed this one. Glad I had the chance to taste this fresh on tap. Must try."
"Good appearance in its Houblon glass (that I don't find having the right shape, neither I like it very much) good head (even if it does not last very long), the goldest gold you can imagine on top, paler on bottom (since the glass narrows). Smell and taste are dominated by hops, and it has a dry, bitter and tart finish I definitely don't like very much. Probably that's the point, it has a so hoppy character I can't deal with. I find it's a good beer, and two slices of gouda did the job to finish it... But... BA says ""Generally, Belgian IPAs are considered too hoppy by Belgian beer drinkers"". I'm definitely a Belgian beer drinker."
"O ~ A great choice if you're wanting to dabble in beer from Belgium."
"I was expecting to find a citrus bomb and got a pleasant, airy, saaz bomb. I love the springtime feel that Achouffe has to their beers."
"jd"
"O: Nothing interesting about this one. I wonder if the floaties mean it's past it's due date or if it's just natural for the beer to have it. Also, I'm not sure if this is a tripel, or a belgian IPA, or a dubbel, or what? Definitely won't buy again."
"Overall - If you're looking for your typical, outstanding, well-rounded Belgian tripel, you need not look any further because it is truly incredible. If you see IPA on the bottle and you are a hop-hound and you're expecting this to resemble a typical American IPA (with some belgian flavors mixed in), that's not what you're going to get. I love tripels so I highly highly recommend it. Enjoy."
"O: A really nice beer from a style that I'm generally not a huge fan of. This could be a dangerous beer, as there isn't hardly any booze for a 9% beer. I could definitely see me buying this again, or having it at a bar. Very nicely done."
"I don't know why this is considered a belgian ipa... tastes like a tripel. Lemon grass flavor that is smooth to the mouth, but high carbonation. Gets extremely better as it warms. You cannot even tell this is a 9.0% beer."
"Not as much hop characteristics as I expected, although the hop oil is visibly evident. I had this beer on tap at Wurstküche in Los Angeles, and I remember the hop characteristics to be much more evident--maybe this is because of the bottle conditioning, maybe due to age. Not as impressed by this as I would like to be, but then again, this is not my favorite style. Still rated to style though."
"Overall this was a solid pick up. Its tasty, light and crisp. Definitely a venture out of the typical IPA realm but not an unwelcome one."
"Edit: And I love the logo on the bottle. Caught my eyes in the liquer store, that's for sure."
"Served on tap in a stem glass. Poured a hazy yellow, almost reminiscent of a witbier. Citrusy nose with a bit of spice. Light taste, yet full-bodied. Slightly citrusy, with a smooth hoppiness that wasn't too strong. Very pleasant and drinkable."
"Overall is excellent and is one of my favorite Belgian beers."
"Excellent overall. Clearly the best Belgian IPA I've had."
"D- 4 I could enjoy a few of these. It grew on me as I made my way through. I'd like to try more of the style, however, because it was quite different from other IPAs that I've had. Maybe a fresher bottle would produce more of the hoppiness that I expected? Either way, a good brew overall."
"O - I may have just found my favorite Belgian beer. This will go great with a spicy dish like BBQ or chili."
"O-A very enjoyable bottle of beer. I picked this up in Nashua, NH for something like $8.99. What a deal when compared to other 750 ml bottles at up to $4.00 more!"
"There's a reason that this is one of the top ranked Belgian IPAs on the site and that's because it's damn good! I loved how the fruit and spice notes from the yeast were very subtle here, almost to the point where you could have mistaken them for hop characteristics. And the overall drinkable nature was VERY good for the bigger size of this. I'm not usually a huge fan of this style but the emphasis on the hop flavors and overall clean feel really won me over here in a big way. I think having this on draft really made a big difference here."
"Cheers"
"overall; this is an IPA but yet the hops don't make me forget that it's also a beer...a malt beverage. Great jobs to the brewery for making a delicious beer and not just catering to hopheads."
"O - I'm buying this again. I'd really like to try this with food of that region."
"750ml bottle shared with mrmanning, StephenRich, Chris, and Erin. Pours a pale golden yellow with two fingers of billowy white head and a few dots of lacing on the tulip glass. Nose is floral, doughy, grassy, lots of Saaz hops evident, mandarin oranges, creamy, a little grainy, very clean and effervescent, perfume, ethanol, lemony hops, yeasty as hell. Taste is crisp pale malts, strong spiciness, tangy, grassy, and lemony Noble hops, hint of pine, cookie-like sweetness mid-palate, slight alcoholic burn, tingly and lasting bitterness to end. High side of medium bodied, lively but smooth carbonation, oily and resiny middle transitions to a bone dry finish. A robust and nuanced Belgian IPA, not as hoppy or bitter as Lupulus, Hop-It, and Hopsinjoor. Nevertheless, a solid brew overall."
"Notes: Everything is in good balance with an excellent hop and funky character."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied with high carbonation. Very easy drinking, an interesting mix of the styles. Would very much like to give this one another go in the future."
"Could this beer get any better? Not a chance. Its bone dry finish rounds out the experience to make this a beer I will go out of my way to find again. Although at 9% ABV, I certainly won't be drinking more than one at a time when I can only find 750ml bottles."
"Overall this is too dry for me and far to strong for more than a glass. Intersting though and a good beer to add to flavour experience journey."
"Poured into a la Chouffe chalice the beer looked perfect. A hazy golden body with yeast suspended within. Holds a puffy head that reduces to a filim remaining as long as the beer. Strong hop smells, nice use of tomahawk, amarillo, and saaz; a nice blend. Bready yeasty smells produced among the strong alcohol esters. The taste matches here with the peppery phenolics of the Belgian yeast, not overbearing. A full body with excellent carbonation for the level of alcohol and body of the beer. Don't pass this one."
"In short: A Belgian approach to IPA with perfect interplay of hops, yeast and malt."
"Libation: A fantastic and might I say unique brew experience. I've never had a beer of this concoction that delivers so completely. Very drinkable, even at 9% ABV and most certainly a beer I'll return to with some regularity."
"Usually share Belgian 750ml bottles but this is one where I do not regret my greed. Nice to see that the green bottle didn't let me down too."
"D - It's got a lot going on. The alcohol is too apparent for my taste. I would like to try it on tap."
"Another excellent offering from La d'Achouffe."
"The CPJ"
"This is a very nice example of a Belgian IPA, and one I return to now and then, but I rarely want more than one at a time."
"T: Light fruit flavors and a lot of malty smoothness. Finish is where the hops come in with a bit of pepper. I was expecting a little more from this one, but it's not terrible."
"Very well constructed, and overall it seems to be exactly what it intends to be: a Belgian IPA tripel."
"D: good, I enjoyed the bottle, but was not blown away....would probably get it again on tap, but wouldn't pony up for the big bottle again...."
"D: I won't be spending 12 dollars for a bomber of this again."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the palate. A tasty Belgian IPA for sure, and the 9% is nearly invisible while drinking."
"D: Good IPA for a Belgium brewer. Both styles (tripel and IPA) are well-balanced and it's quite drinkable. Hop bite doesn't linger too much at the end, so it's great. Highly recommend and best for this specialty style."
"I really love this beer. Every since having it in 2006 for the first and even having the opportunity to have it on draft that summer at the Stumbling Monk in Seattle, it has been a favorite. Do not drink it as much as I would like because I kept running into less than fresh bottles."
"Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and lacy, and the carbonation does a good job of keeping it that way the whole way through the sip. Drinkability is good in terms of texture, but the banana/spice tastes get a little bit too strong and unbalanced near the end of the bottle in my opinion. Everything else about it is great though."
"Impression: I am now convinced I need to try this style freshly bottled, though it may take a trip to Europe to do it. When do we leave?"
"Big hops give the taste of grapefruit. The grapefruit produced an interesting sweet vs. bitter contrast. The high ABV showed somewhat which is okay because the beer remained balanced. Finishes with tart dryness and black pepper. A tasty and unique beer that was excellent with fries."
"This was poured from a 11.2oz bottle into my Founder's snifter. And we have a gusher! That certainly wasn't expected. I'd say I only salvaged about 6oz of the bottle by the time I cleaned it up and a good amount of foam remained in the bottle. Anyway, it poured a dirty, murky and darked tinged gold in color with a one finger white head that laced the glass like soap water. The aromas are very sweet, yeasty, and feature an ever so subtle light hoppyness to them. It's interesting to say the least. The flavor is very yeasty, very bready, very malty and pretty sweet. It has a honey like sweetness. The hops are pretty nonexistent. After the bottle bomb it has little carbonation left and drinks pretty smoothly with a light carbonation that tingles on the tongue. This beer is just ok. Belgian Tripels are just a totally different style. In my opinion it's a hard task to perfect it and this bottle at least did not do that. It was solid, just ok. This one, smaller bottle, will be enough for me."
"Carbonation is just a little too high for my liking."
"This is a very interesting, complex, and good beer."
"D-this is a great belgian IPA, goes down easily! i wouldn't mind having an entire 750mL of this one!"
"D - very drinkable, will drink again."
"D: Not the best Belgian IPA. Drinkable and enjoyable but not incredible."
"D - Moderate drinkability - ABV on the high side for the style. Slightly filling but not overwhelming. FLavors aren't as potent as other BIPAs I've had."
"D: medium"
"Pours a hazy golden color, nice dense fluffy head. Served pretty cold which is probably contributing to the fact that the nose is reticent. There's some light orange/citrus, white floral notes and Belgian yeast, not particularly hoppy on the nose for those used to American IPAs/DIPAs. On the palate this hits you with a thwack of of bold bitter hops and alcohol. The hops do a nice job of masking the 9% ABV so the overall impression is strength rather than booziness. This is fairly drinkable for such a big beer, refreshingly clean and bitter. Unlike a lot of high gravity American hop bombs, this isn't thick and sweet...a dangerously drinkable Belgian IPA."
"An odd mix of styles, at times I feel polarised within myself. But it's at least very interesting."
"Appearance is nice and smell is average at first and better as temperature settles into the zone.The taste to me is very temperate and seems to be better closer to the 50 degree temperature, impressive head and enjoyable. A very good beer that is easy to drink and quite a value at my local store."
"Drinks well. A very nice beer."
"I enjoyed drinking this beer, it was very drinkable."
"Pours hazy gold with medium head. Aroma is fruity and flora. Taste is complex fruit flavors including dried fruit such as raisins and prunes with nice and strong spicey hop balance. Strong hop bitterness that leaves a very smooth finish. This is a dry beer with the characteristics of an IPA but the complex spicyness of a Tripel."
"A good Belgian style ale, but not one that rocks me. Indeed, I feel like the extra hop additions are to the detriment of the base beer, and not intense enough to really rock the flavour spectrum."
"Poured from bottle into dimple glass. Pours cloudy yellow with a large fluffy white head. Aroma is a nice mixture of fresh citrus hops, yeast, spices, and malt that's mainly bread and some light citrus-ish fruitiness. Flavor is fairly strong but flavorful hops up front, mellowing slightly to a dry, yeasty, tart/fruity, and somewhat spiced tripel, but finishing with quite a few hops also. As advertised, it's a hopped tripel, but somewhat less hopping would probably have brought out more complexity. Definitely worth seeking out if you like both American-style and Belgian-style beers. Can't say I'm a big fan of this one here due to its high rankings."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer that I hope to try fresh sometime. I will be buying it state side in the near future untill I can make that happen."
"Overall I was happy to revisit an old favorite and it didn't disappoint. A benchmark for the style in my opinion, not overly sweet and the dryness accentuates the hops."
"I grow weary of these damn green bottles.... Not sure of the last time I've had a beer in a green or clear bottle that wasn't skunked in some manner... What a letdown..."
"D: Fantastic. Everyone raves about La Chouffe, and now i know why."
"MF/D: Chewy for the style, alcohol is well hidden (except for the nose), smooth with low carbonation. Finish is of Belgian yeast mixed with citrusy hops"
"D: OH MY WORD! Do Belgians even know how to make a bad beer? The alcohol is well hidden and excellent beer. Randomly grabbed this at Trader Joe's; seen it on the shelf a million times and thought nothing of it, until now."
"Poured a murky golden yellow with pale yellow highlights that had a thin bubbly head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was nice and malt with some fruity character which consisted of bananas apple and pears but didi have grassy hop notes as well. The taste was pretty yeasty and malty upfront on the palate wtih fruity citrusy accents and a good grassy hop profile that really surprised me from the belgians. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, malty, mild fruity, citrusy, hoppy slight bitter finish. The brew surprised me for sure I honestly thought it wasn't gonna be that good but was damn tasty and drank good."
"Poured hazy amber pour with a large creamy white head that lasted and had good lacing. Moderate yeasty sour fruit aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carb onation. Full yeasty sour fruity flavor with a smooth hop finsh of moderate duration. Good interesting brew."
"D: A darn good beer; a bit of an alcohol presence but it works well and drinks well"
"For being so heady, the carbonation is rather mild. Gives a nice crispness. A big finish, leaving you little depth to mask the next sip. Oh so nice. ABV is high but you can neither smell it nor taste it. Watch out though, it bites."
"Anyway, after the citrus-y hops you taste grain sweetness with a hint of yeastiness. Good head retention, not quite Duvel egg-white fluff but the similar. All in all similar to Duvel Green with more graininess, a bit thicker, stronger, and less fragrant."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Tripel (a golden beer like a Duvel)."
"Had this bottle at a Moroccon restaurant in San Francisco. I was expecting to go with wine here, but apparently the beer list at every nice restaurant in California is great. Pours a hazy golden-orange colour with pillowy white head. Some lacing down the glass. Smells of strong citrus hops with the Belgian tripel yeastiness. Quite bitter, but also the tartness of the tripel comes through. I love Belgian IPA's and this is one of the better ones for sure."
"d. this is just lovely. i could drink this for hours (1 bottle or multiple bottles). but its too tasty to be so patient, or hasty."
"D: Just discovered the Belgian IPA format. This is one of the best around in that style. I encourage everyone to try this beer because it has something for everyone and will not disappoint."
"Everyone has to try this beer, there is so much to it, it's very good too."
"Overall, a decent enough beer to try, and (as the overall score here shows) I seem to be in the minority in my views. Worth trying if you see it."
"Pairs well with an evening of conversation and music appreciation."
"Light hopping, light body, sweet, a tad tart and funky. Enjoyed more with each sip. A real good example of the style, only downside is that its real expensive and that definitely affects its drinkability."
"(D)- Its good, but very bitter and grassy. It think it would be better with a little age on it to allow the harsh hops to settle."
"D: Very drinkable for an ABV that high. The hoppiness doesn't overwhelm you."
"D - This is the best BIPA i have had including Poperinge Hommel and De Ranke XX."
" I was so intrigued and impressed at this point that I had to crack open a Duvel only for comparison. I understand that these are two different beers but I really wanted to see how it stood against Duvel. In my opinion, Chouffe is a hoppier BSPA and it's a fair comparison. I found that while Chouffe is more complex than Duvel, Duvel is better done, but they are equally good. I would've liked Chouffe even better had the bitterness seemed more in place, but that's perhaps just nitpicking. A fantastic beer, highly recommended. I will seek a fresher bottle myself!"
"d - A wonderful Belgian IPA that is easy to drink considering the high ABV. Lots of yeast and spice in the smell and taste, one of the better ones I've had. Have had a few times and will certainly have again."
"Overall, a supreme example."
"Taste - Very well balanced. For how much hop flavor is in this beer it is hardly bitter on the palate. The Belgian yeast character and hop character balance very nicely as well, which in some beers there is a tendency to conflict. I enjoyed for the first few sips an intense spearmint flavor which my palate quickly got accustomed to. It was absolutely delightful. A very complimentary complex and balanced beer."
"Light bodied beer with light small bubbled carbonation is good. The lingering herbal hops on your tongue encourage you to savor the lasting flavor, sipping this slowly and see how it develops."
"Drinkability - Initially i was NOT an IPA fan, but more and more i am beginning to appreciate the IPAs. I would stock this beer and share with friends."
"Dobbelen IPA Tripel beautifully bridges typical Belgian Ales with American IPAs. It's light with bitterness and spicy yet grassy."
"A lot of pretenders have attempted to assail the mountain of this somewhat newish beer style, but it's always nice to see the old boys show 'em how its done. Here, the typically overwrought yeast/gargantuan hop battle is thankfully absent, leaving a more tasteful, subtle flavourful blend of all that is good therein. Sure, the hops don't scream out ""PACNW", but that can actually be a desirable thing, maybe."
"An excellent beer. Notes of grapefruit and malt hit the nose. The beer has a great haze with a thin pillow head. The carbonation is perfect on the palate, a medium to full body. A subtle sweetness upfront as the beer quickly moves to bitter with a dry, foamy finish that leaves a slight sweetness on the tongue. Just a great beer."
"Accomplishes the admirable feat of being both refreshing and satisfying with nice clean flavours but notable complexity and a big mouthfeel."
"The pour is a hazy almost opaque yellow out of the petit brown bottle. Slightly off white head looks like a meringue and really sticks around. My Sam Adams perfect pint glass might have aided this. Smells fantastic. Yeasty and fruity and the Saaz hops stood out. Lots of lemon and a little clove as well as a touch of bubblegum. There's a doughy sweetness when this hits your mouth, but it's quickly replaced by a stream of other flavors. There's some peppery clove blending to grapefruit. Then a touch of vanilla comes in before the grapefruit reappears and establishes the lingering taste. You almost have to try to taste the alcohol in this...pretty impressive for 9%. I felt it in my stomach more than anything. Smooth, creamy feel that goes down effortlessly. Pretty impressive beer."
"Drink: This beer makes one thirsty. The high ABV could slow you down as well. Its not particularly filling though."
"This beer pours with a pale straw color. The head is a billowy white which looks more and more like a cloud as it starts to recede. Some pretty mellow hop and sour notes are present in the aroma. Very slight hop presence in the front. A touch of citrus and honey in the finish. This has to be one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had. The finish doesn't leave you with that dry bite in the back of your jaw."
"A very drinkable and unique beer."
"An enjoyable beer, particularly for a fan of US IPAs..."
"Poured from bottle into De Dolle tulip. Gusher pours a hazy yellow straw with a thick white head that fades to a ring with very nice lacing. Smell is a nice mix of yeast and spicy hops. Taste is hops up fruity and spicy hops up front followed by belgian yeast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy, medium carbonation and a slightly hot finish. Drinkability is good - one of the better belgian IPAs."
"D: The alcohol is relatively well masked and the dryness in the aftertaste leaves you longing for another sip."
"Very medium-bodied, crisp and lively. Would definitely consider pairing this with food, especially for the holiday season. Great drinking overall- easy, clean and tasty."
"D - well balanced yet unmistaken as an IPA. hides its ABV very well. not as appealing (to me) as some of its American variants but good nonetheless."
"Drinkability is quite good, with the unique flavoring providing a pleasant tasting experience. It's more of a slightly more bitter tripel than a IPA to me, which suits me just fine. Interesting fusion of two styles that makes for a quality brew."
"d: a decent beer but it's slow slipping beer"
"But then again, if I want a very good triple, I go for Karmeliet or westmalle. If I want a very good Belgian Ipa... I definitely go for Viven Ipa Imperial"
"D - I've had the chance to sample this before so I wasn't blown out of the water by this bottle like I probably should have been, but it's quite fantastic regardless. Clearly a classic for it's style, Chouffe is well-balanced and never over-the-top making it a perfect quaffing IPA."
"Taste is really quite hoppy and bitter with a bit of vegetal and earthy hop taste along with a very good Belgian backbone, good maltiness to balance it all out. Very full and rich Mothfeel tops it off."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and carbonation is high. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice flavors to it and felt very balanced for an IPA. It seemed much lighter in hoppiness compared to the American versions, although more balanced. It was flavorful, easy drinking, and a pretty solid beer overall."
"I'm rarely flat-out disappointed in a beer, but Houblon Chouffe disappointed me. This is a favorite beer of so many people and I can't tell why. Maybe this bottle is poor, or perhaps the beer is better in the 750mL form (more room for the yeast to do its thang). This is a decent beer, but there are other Belgian IPAs that I'd reach for instead."
"MF/D: a smooth start that gives way to a refreshing sizzle of carbonation, certainly doesn't taste like the proclaimed abv..."
"Overall, I am in love with this beer. With the Tripel and the IPA being my favorite styles currently, this beer was made for me. It's a desert island selection."
"D A good ""mild"" IPA. As with most bottle conditioned beers, the loss of freshness from the trip over is minimized."
"Overall though I feel like this particular beer is fighting with itself. Doesn't seem to know if it wants to be an IPA or if it wants to be a Tripel. So it ends up muddy. I've had this on other occasions and this isn't the best example of what I know this beer can be. I have to chalk it up that something was off in the bottle I had. Disappointing experience."
"D- very good! The alcohol gets a bit hot, but I could handle a few of these for sure."
"very interesting, almost hard to compare on the flavour wheel...a very good and unique beer"
"11.2 oz bottle served in my ST tulip. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Foam gushed out of the neck of the bottle off the cap pop. Pours a dull, golden-orange with a creamy 1.5 inch, rocky, off-white head. Clarity is semi-hazy with large particles floating in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap, with porous bands of lacing forming a semi-circle around the bowl of the glass. Nose suggests toffee, and an herbal/medicinal character, as well as some honey and candi sugar. Taste consistent with nose - flavors reveal candied fruit (perhaps figs, prunes or apricots); very tripel-esque in character; however the herbal hops bittering subdues any potential sweetness. Flavor profile also tastes a bit more watered down than anticipated; however, it all comes together fairly well. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency, with a pleasant and easy background carbonation. A really interesting beer - the taste is entirely consistent with description on the label in that it is clearly a tripel/belgian IPA hybrid. Glad I finally gave this one a try. Probably my favorite offering from Brasserie d'Achouffe thus far."
"D- Very easy to drink, almost watery it was so easy, but it's pretty good"
"Drinkability: This is a top notch Belgian IPA. It starts out a bit sweet, but the balance with the hops works so well for me. Some may say it is too hoppy, but I have a hop-adjusted palette, so it works perfectly for me."
"D: Very interesting and unique. Something I would love to drink again sometime down the road."
"d-very good. not my cup of tea stylewise, but an interesting mix of two of my favorite styles. i did enjoy it, and it's pretty dang nice for the price. how they 9% in here, i will never know.."
"Poured carefully from a wine-like bottle, this ale produces a perfect puffy head that is just the right size and leaves textbook lacing. The first sip pops in your mouth with smooth carbonation. The start of the sip gives the usual Belgian sweetness, but tapers off and finish dry with subtle hoppiness."
"Bottle. Hazy yellow pour with a huge frothy white head looks fab. Aromas of orange peel, passion fruit and floral hops. Taste is spicy and yeasty but with a very refreshing hop finish. Creamy palate with lively carbonation. A nice blend between a IIPA and a belgian tripel. Unfortunately the alcohol is a little overwhelming. Still A solid beer."
"D: With 9% ABV, definitely not a session beer. Extremely tasty for someone who really likes hoppy beers. A very complex, interesting flavor."
"D- It's a good brew, but being an IPA and being made and Belgium doesn't make you a Belgian IPA. It's good, but there's a number of Belgian IPAs I'd pick up before I got this one again."
"Excellent beer overall. The tripel/IPA combo I'd like to see more Belgian brewers attempt."
"D - this is a cool beer. My first belgian ipa. I really enjoyed it and will definitely try it again."
"A hop odyssey! I recommend Houblon to any West Coast IPA drinker who needs to be slapped around while shouting, ""There is more to life than Cascade, Colombus, and Centennial!"""
"Great great beer and an IPA that stands up to any California IPA, while still maintaining distinctive Belgian Tripel characteristics and flavors. Truly a craft beer."
"Thanks kecarl7"
"This is very refreshing and I would love to have another, even at 9%. I enjoy this beer."
"pours a hazy golden yellow with a pure while fluffy 3 finger head with lots of sticky lacing..smell is citrus , hops ,spices, yeast and fruit..taste is great it full of hops and citrus balanced with spices,yeast,bananas and clove..a little malt in the background balance this out nicely..this is a real treat..mouth feel is medium but full of flavors for the palate i taste the saaz hops but also spice and fruit..the range and balance of flavors are great very drinkable and a real taste treat..9% is nowhere to be found,,highly recommended"
"I like this beer and think that it's good but it lacks the hop character expected of anything called an IPA."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Pours golden yellow with a one finger white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of fruit, alcohol, malt, and a hint of skunky hops. The flavor was of skunky hops, fruit, and malt. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall it was not bad, but not great either. I honestly had no idea it was supposed to be a Belgian IPA until I went to review it... The hop definition just wasn't there for me and the skunky hops were not really that appealing to my palate. In saying that, I would drink this again but it might be awhile."
"Great beer on tap at the Brick Store in Decatur, GA!"
"Love it!"
"This is a very good take on a recent trend of making very hoppy beers from traditional belgian ale bases and yeasts. The tripel was a beautiful, hazy gold with a voluminous white foam. The smell was intoxicating, with the sweet malt combining with cedar and grapefuit-like hops and the fruity, tropical esters produced by the yeast. The beer was very tasty with a fruity, spicy sweetness but dry (alcoholic) finish. This was a very complex beer with different flavors tasted with each sip and as it warmed. The fruit character could be peach, apricot, mango, or grapefuit depending on what you were thinking of as you tasted it. The bitterness from the hops and alcohol helped rein the beer in and keep it grounded and earthy."
"O: High drinkability. Absolutely delicious Belgian IPA. Best on business"
"OVERALL: A decent beer, but not their best offering I don't think. There are also some better examples of the style here in the low countries, like Urthel's Hop-It. The head on this one also became scarily nasty as well. This one tasted pretty good really, but the look and muted nose let it down. I'd pass."
"D- Great beer especially if you are looking for the higher hop end of a Belgian I.P.A. A lot going on that makes you keep reaching for this one."
"D - 9%ABV makes it a bit much for regular drinking but I'd drink this again for sure."
"Notes: Great bottled offering. Interesting how the honey and spices emerge here more assertively without making it lose any of its overall roundness."
"330 ml stubby bottle, as ""Chouffe Houblon Dobbelen IPA Tripel", bought at Købmandsgården, Voldby, Denmark. ABV is 9%. Hazy pale yellow colour, huge and lasting white head. Moderate but nice aroma of floral hops, some fruity notes too. The flavour is distinctly hoppy but not too much, and has also distinct spicy notes of Belgian ale yeast. Bitter finish and aftertaste. The alcohol is well hidden. Good beer!"
"Makes you thirsty and, behold, there's a refreshing beer right in front of you. Plus, the abv is a fine motivation. And also well hidden by the spicy nature of this brew."
"Overall/notes: Follow-up to my LaChouffe. I must say, this was the better of the two. I've never had anything quite like it. it's really unique... Belgian IPA? Hm... I've got to look into more of these styles. Great balance, smooth, powerful flavors. This is one of the better beers I've had, I think. Highly recommended to both the IPA and the Belgian crowd."
"D - This one is quite delicious, and I would highly recommend this to any fan of Belgian beers, or hop heads. The hops are tame, but perfectly balanced with the Belgian flavours making for a tasty beverage. The only caveat is that you enjoy this responsibly, as the high ABV can easily creep up on you!"
"One damn fine Belgian IPA, would LOVE to try this fresh from the tap!"
"Looking forwards to trying this as i never have and have heard only good things about,it pours a pale murky golden hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a nice white two finger head and sticky lacing here and there,suprisingly enough i find the smell of this brew very subtle yet on the nose you can still notice the hints of belgian yeast,a touch of fruity citrus hops,pale malts and a very peppery,grassy aroma of Saaz hops aswell suprisingly and they really stand out on aroma its almost like im about to drink a nice german pilsner instead of a BIPA,it has a really nice medium bodied mouthfeel which is well carbonated and very sessionable and so is the taste of this with touches of grassy,herbal Saaz hops,pale malts,some bananna and a nice pale malt background which really levels this brew out and i suspect they may have used Saaz hops in this brew which really makes for an interesting IPA of any description as its not in your face at all which i usually like yet it is very drinkable and moreish and i hardly get any bitterness at all on finish if any and no hint of its 9.0% ABV even on first taste and this is my first beer of the night,overall its a really drinkable interesting moreish brew that doesnt leave you gobsmacked but makes its point with a subtle mix of aromas and tastes and will always have a place in my fridge,i even reckon its probably a nice brew to try and entice some of my micro knocking,macro drinking mates over to the good world of beer cheers."
"Notes: Kind of simple and focused, but a pleasure to drink. Less aggressive than I remembered it being, but damn tasty."
"After half a glass, I find it hard to believe that this is 9%, until the alcohol buzz started to kick in near the end of the first glass. Still, the more I drink the better it is. Well worth it."
"Drinkability is excellent for 9%. Very crisp and refreshing."
"D: Easily one of the best Belgian IPAs I have had to date."
"I would say this is a great Belgian beer. One of the best in the 2 mentioned categories."
"D - i was a little shocked at first, but became more of a fan with each gulp. After 750ml the 9% had be buzzing, but it is very drinkable. An interesting and attractive brew."
"First pour turns into a crystal clear golden colour, with the second glass turning into a hazy golden yellow with some floaties in the bottom of the duvel glass. Not as much foam on the first pour compared to the second. Its like marshmallows are in my glass, very cool. The taste is very sharp with some piney hop bitterness with the yeasty dark fruit taste lingering as well. No trace of the 9% alc in this beer at all. Goes down quite smooth. Would definately consider another bottle of this."
"D: This started off kind of skunky, but as it warmed and opened up, it got a lot smoother and sweeter. It had nice body and a delicate and complex taste. It's more of a sipping beer, but it was pretty enjoyable."
"overall: a cool beer that has high alcohol yet retains a light mouth! refreshing and crisp super drinkable and smooth. extremly enjoyable beer."
"D- The 9% abv nicely masked in this beer, will definitely creep up on you, very drinkable for a large trip IPA. Great depth, awesome bitter finish, refreshing, yet with a warm finish, good blend of styles. Very exceptional beer!"
"Drinkability -- Devilishly drinkable. Crisp, refreshing, well-rounded, and with an abv that is dangerously well hidden. Will revisit shortly!"
"Drinkability: This is an interesting mix of Belgian and American styles, and I've loved every sip of it."
"Light bodied, thinner than I would have expected. Very refreshing and highly drinkable."
"Quite a complex beer with many wonderful aspects of the Belgian brewing tradition. Definitely a beer to savor, especially since the ABV will have you feeling good in no time. I tried Flying Dog's Raging Bitch before this and there is no comparison, but I didn't expect there to be."
"The question is do you want a tripel with an IPA finish. If you do then this is a very nice beer. I would have preferred a cleaner finish which spoiled it a bit for me. I understood what this was a tripel/IPA hybrid when I bought it so can not be too critical. If this is the kind of beer you want, it delivers."
"D: enjoyable to drink, although the feeling of disproportionate bitterness wouldn't make it a session for me"
"Tastes like hoppiness. Sweet in the front of the mouth with a nice bitterness and crisp mouthfeel. Some belgian yeast flavors are coming though as well. I'll definitely try this one again."
"Poured from the 750ml bottle into a snifter. Thick, fluffy white head, with a straw coloured body, bit hazy from the yeast. Smells primarily of hops, bit citrusy, some alcohol esters, some yeast. Nice head retention, lacing is thick, clumpy and sticky. Taste is quite hoppy, got alot more of the alcohol as I got closer to the bottom of the glass, definitely the Belgian yeast coming through also. Not too bitter, pretty nice for an IPA. Almost drank the whole 750 by myself, save a bit which I shared but I probably could have. Alcohol really stands out the more I had, and detracts from the drinkability however. Overall, my first experience with a belgian IPA and was pleased!"
"However - Cali-Belgique and Le Freak are two examples of this style that I like a lot more."
"Poured a very light straw gold with frothy head that died quickly but left some lace patches. A mix of sour and tart fruit flavors along with a healthy hop presence and some funk makes up the aroma. A great balance is in this beer as this beer is light to medium bodied but contains a good sweet edge plus some sticky caramel malt. Also has a good orange/yeasty feel with citric hops for a dry, crisp finish that is bubbly thanks to great carbonation. A decent amount of biscuit/caramel malt work their way into the beer as well and there is also a smalle sour/tart edge. A great ale that is easy to sip with well-hidden ABV and is more sweet than sour but still has a good hoppy profile."
"Quite a drink. Easy to appreciate but offering lots."
"Eh. It's a pretty good Belgian IPA, but I was hoping for more. I thought the amarillo might go further. Instead it had more grass and lemon rind than I'd prefer. Also, surprisingly boozy. It looks incredible however, including the great 11.2 oz bottle."
"One of, if not my absolute favorite Belgian IPAs-I will be buying this again."
"A hazy bright golden color pour with a big lasting foamy white head leving lots of jagged lacing , lively carbonation . Aroma of bright citrus hops , orange and lemon a little like fruit punch , bananas and bread dough . Flavor is hoppy up front with a nice toasty malt backbone , yeasty esters of banana ,and clove . Nice citrus hops , nice level of bitterness , a bit of complexity , medium body with a crisp clean mouthfeel and a long hoppy finish . Very drinkable and good ."
"Fresh Houblon Chouffe on tap has redeemed the entire Belgian IPA style for me. The bottles I've had in the past must have been too old, because this is exactly what I want a Belgian IPA to be (minor, subjective flaws and lack of complexity are all that kept the Smell and Taste categories from being 5s). This was even better than Stone Cali-Belgique, the other Belgian IPA I've liked. Don't miss this if you see it on tap at a trustworthy bar."
"D: I would seek this beer out, and drink it repeatedly. Better to do that at home or with a DD."
"Absolutely wonderful brew."
"A well-aged Belgian IPA - I was beginning to fear this style was just not for me - paired professionally. I need more of this in my life."
"D- This can definitely hit your stomach with a punch due to the high carbonation a lot of this wouldn't be desireable but it is a great beer to have a couple off complimented with maybe a good American IPA and a Belgian Tripel."
"This was a really unique beer, not quite and IPA and not quite a Tripel. This beer pours a cloudy light golden straw color with a thick and foamy bright white head. On the nose I pick up strong notes of damp wet hops and pine, with subtle grapefruit and citrus notes. The palate has notes of wet hops some what reminisent of American IPAs but with none of the bitterness, great carbonation and a mouthfeel that reminds me of the St. Bernardus Tripel."
"Overall - A delicious example of the style. Excellent in all aspects, just a bit prominent in terms of noticeable alcohol."
"D: absolute great madness. Incredibly balanced and drinkable. I seem to have run out of superlatives. This is the real deal"
"D: Tasted more like an IPA to me than a Belgium, although you can certainly pick up some of the Belgium yeast characteristics underneath the hoppiness. Still very good and worth a try -- but not my favorite Belgium."
"It definitely has a strong taste, so you have to prepared to taste some strong brew."
"D - Exceptionally well balanced with all the traits melding together almost seamlessly leading to an extremely refreshing beer. Without the skunkyness this would an excellent beer to have quite frequently. The balance and refreshing-ness are remarkable for something with 9% alcohol."
"D: The dryness, the total absence of alcohol taste and the not overpowering body makes it quite easy to drink."
"Pours a nice honey golden color with voluminous, thick, white head. Beautiful lacing/head. Great retention into a little cap. Smell is of clove with some lighter malts dancing in and out. Maybe some banana too. Pretty light though. Taste has some alcohol in it, but the clove/fruity tripel is nicely balanced by some slightly bitter hops. Very interesting combination, definitely what I would envision a Belgian IPA to be. Slight bitter finish. Light in the mouth, good carbonation, this one is an easy drinker. For 9%, it drinks like 5%. Delicious beer, though a unique one, I feel like I might not always be in the mood for one of these."
"Pours a hazy, golden color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of pale hops, slight citrus, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, yeast, slight wheat, and hops. Overall, good body, blend, and appearance."
"D: This beer is a classic. And while it is good, I do not find it terribly interesting. I have no thoughts on buying another any time soon. Overrated in my opinion."
"for drinkability, if i wanted an ipa, this would not do. on its own, the beer is fantastic with lots of character and great balance."
"D= I wish this bottle wasn't skunked. Again like I said I know some people think that a beer shouldn't be reviewed when it has an obvious flaw but I disagree. This beer wasn't that bad when you look past some of the flaws but even under that it just isn't that great."
"Had a fresher version and I have updated my rating."
"Overall - A very good beer !! Highly recommended !! Another excellent brew from d'Achouffe..."
"Cheers!"
"Lighter body with a good amount of carbonation. Some alcohol is felt, but still hidden pretty well. This is a pretty enjoyable beer."
"75cl bottle. Pours a sparkling golden color, with some floaties, huge frothy white head, lacing throughout. Aroma is pale malts, lots of spiciness, yeast, citrus and flowery hops. Flavor is pale malts, yeast, citrus and spicy hops. Mouthfeel is light, well carbonated, dry, and bitter at the end. Very good one, better at the brewery though, warms well."
"Drinkability- overall a very unique beer to me that in most ways reminds me of alot more of the american beers I have tried then most belgians, if poured for some of my american ipa fans I am doubtful blind if many would guess this as a belgian beer and would mostly across the board enjoy this, the finish was long and any hint of the alcohol being 9 percent is extremely well hidden, served as great yet all be it strong aperitif and builds a nice appetite and went tasty with some pizza, one I will have again and recommend others try,"
"Pours a pale and hazy golden yellow color with a creamy and frothy white head. Excellent retention. Smell is of pale malts, wheat, spicy hops and yeast. Taste is of earthy and spicy hops backed by a nice spicy yeast flavor. Pale malts come through as the bitter flavors pass. Light bodied, fully carbonated, prickly and drying. A very nice Belgian IPA, maybe a tad thin and prickly for the palate, but the earthy and spicy notes were very welcomes after too many resiny and over bitter hoppy brews."
"D= 4.5 this is my first true Belgian IPA and I must say it is an amazing beer. The problem with this beer is that I want to drink more and more of it. Great brewery, amazing beer, long live Belgium."
"so impressed with this brew. pours an impenetrable copper/yellow with a very lively two finger, white head. even when attempting to open the bottle, foam spewed out from the top. impressive lacing. the smell is world class, dominated by lemon zest. yeast, flora, tons of banana, and hay aromas are also present, ending with a leafy hop bite. absolutely intoxicating. the taste is lively and delicious. citrus (lemon), spice, and banana with a bitter finish. crisp, light, and beautiful. sight malt as it warms. definitely the best of it's style. im going to stock up on a few of these monsters."
"Served in a tulip, slightly hazy and golden with a rocky head. Smell is very fruity and fresh with a touch of spice. Aroma really reminds me of the raspberry bushes out In front of my parent's house on our farm. The taste is quite complex. Fruity, boozy, hoppy, spicy, herbal. Quite bitter, but the fruity yeast really dominates. Medium bodied with a nice dry, but not too dry finish. The strength takes away from drinkability, but it is still a tasty and interesting brew."
"O: Strong bubblegum, alc too harsh, like the mouthfeel, funk mild and intriguing"
"Notes: A bit less hoppy than what I was expecting. That said, I still think hop flavors are the main part and attraction to this beer. Not a hop bomb but rather a fairly balanced hop-centric beer. Enjoyable and definitely worth getting, but not amazing."
"D: A bit too sweet and a touch of booze diminished my enjoyment of this beer. Perhaps the style is just not my thing, but I was hoping for more."
"(I'm honestly not sure why this exploded. Maybe I inadvertently shook the bottle around without realizing at some point? The carbonation was NOT huge and the beer didn't taste light-struck. It tasted excellent.)"
"D- Crisp and easy drinking is the way I could explain it. Goes down easy despite the high ABV. Can't even notice them. A good interpretation of the style."
"Slainte."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, delicious, leaves you wanting more. Great Beer!"
"D – Very likeable beer; a crowd pleaser."
"Great drinkablility, very solid beer."
"Overall, this is a solid beer and it is a nice combination of two styles. Pretty drinkable and something I would definitely want to have again. I recommend this one!"
"Belgian IPA's have a long way to go before they can stand side by side American IPA's. As of now, it's no contest."
"Had this one on tap. Bright and clear straw colored beer. Fluffy white head with tight bead, leaving a nice lace on the glass as I drank it. Had a nice citrusy hop smell along with that spicy Belgian yeastiness. Medium bodied, crisp and dry with a good hop bitterness in the finish. A really nice Chouffe that goes donw very easy considering it's 8 or 9% alcohol"
"Overall, a very solid example of a Belgian IPA. I liked this and hope to have more."
"Great smelling and tasting brew. smells of a ton of citrus hoppiness and some spice. Taste has a great mixture of hops, with a lot of citrus and spices. delicious brew. would recommend this to anyone."
"Finish is a pleasant pine resin. Complex and nice."
"O- Good, not great, but good."
"Overall - Not a bad introduction to the style, but it gets points off for being in a green bottle"
"Pours with a mountainous white fluffy head. The body is slightly golden amber and the carbonation is quite intense. The nose has a spicy peppery edge to it with an underlying hint of alcohol that provides a warmness. There is a sweet toffee wheatiness that sit alongside a little grassy hop bitterness. The first taste is an almost yeasty perfume bitterness with a slightly white wine dryness. After this the flavours open up and there are more sweet malt flavours ending with a buttery flapjack taste. I'm a massive fan of this beer, really love the mix of flavours and aromas."
"Only weakeness is mouthfeel, as I felt this was too carbed, a little distracting, but I know many bottle conditioned Belgians can end up this way. But this is a great beer, a wonderful gateway towards Belgians for hop lovers."
"This is a great beer, and one that I've been looking forward to trying, as I've been a Chouffe fan since I got into good beer. Doesn't disappoint."
"D- Dangerously good at 9%abv. I usually don't like the floral/grassy hop flavor, but what can I say??? This is an amazing beer, a fantastic way to start off my weekend."
"D - As others have stated dangerous because of the smoothness and the ABV. Definately would want to have this again."
"The beer is dangerously drinkable, the ABV should be respected."
"D- Dangerously high, the alcohol is well masked but catches you. My wife (who had not had a beer in over 9 months due to pregnancy) and I split the bomber, and five minutes into the beer she said ""Whoa, what's the ABV of this?!"""
"Drinkability is dang near dangerous at 9%. This is what beer was meant to be. My $2 10 oz pour was probably the best beer purchase I've made in a long time."
"F: Pretty dry and bitter, it gets a little more bitter on the finish as they build and hit at the finish. It's a nice grassy earthy spicy hop taste and bitterness that lingers a bit. A little alcohol sting and warmth, and slight lingering spice."
"This is a simply perfect belgian IPA - one of the best beers i've ever had period."
"Lemon carries forward to the flavor as well, acting as a dilute sauce upon some fresh apple and pear and with just a bit of spice. A slight coarseness to the texture provides for a smooth feel and keeps the apparent sweetness down. The ABV is well cloaked nonetheless. A light bitterness concludes after a final flash of sweet lemon bread. Farily drinkable given its size, quite pleasant yet not quite the showstopper I was expecting. Solid beer that is surely worth a try, more of a hopped up tripel than an IPA and an interesting take on the Belgian IPA style."
"Notes: I really liked this beer. I cracked this open for New Years instead of a bottle of champagne. It was a different belgian beer since not many belgians are IPAs. I highly recommend this."
"At 9% there is little evidence of alcohol, it is creamy and deceptively easy to drink. Very smooth, but finishes a tad bit dry. I could drink this all day."
"Drinkability: while this is a very tasty beer, I was hoping to be blown away, which I was not. Perhaps I shall revisit this beer after exploring more Belgian IPAs out there."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the drinkability was good. Definately something that I will try again."
"annnnd this review gave me my ba initiate mug!!!"
"So interesting. Who cares how strong it is? But really, it's not very noticeable at all, until about the halfway mark when when a wave of boozy warmth hit me. Hoppy flavors were stronger at first, but about halfway through I'm not even thinking about this is as a hop-forward beer anymore. But the bitterness is there when I look for it. I will probably buy this again just to keep exploring. Really intriguing."
"Drinkability - Quite a delicious beer - very enjoyable, especially for anyone who enjoys belgian style beers with an extra hop kick."
"Pretty tasty stuff, but don't expect to be bowled over by a big ol' grapefruit. Incredibly well balanced, though I actually wish it wasn't, I think it would work better with a bigger Amarillo hop aroma. Reminds me somewhat of Boulevard Saison, I think I prefer whichever one happens to be freshest at the time."
"D - HIG! even with the higher ABV."
"Flavor is bright and mild. Hop flavors and bitterness relatively balanced against the Belgian spicy yeast character and the malt. This is probably the best example of a Belgian IPA I've had. Finishes a little dry. Medium body overall, drinkability high, mouthfeel high. Overall a really good beer."
"Taste is great and very drinkable. Not too bitter to ruin the Belgian Tripel taste, a very nice contrast. Lot's of sweetness that remains on your tastebuds well after you finish. A great beer!"
"there was a distinct lack of head, but the colour and all else was the same as the bottled version. the taste was very well blended: it was a perfect 50/50 split between a triped and an ipa. very smooth and refreshing. pretty much the same as the bottle, but a bit more fragrant and explicit in the flavours."
"Overall, this is a very solid brew from a solid brewery. I am a hop head that loves Belgians so the Belgian IPA is one of my favorite styles and this is one of the beers that I think helped put it on the map. I have to say, though, that the Urthel Hop-It I enjoyed a couple days ago was a clearly superior brew, in my opinion. I hate to knock the brew, but since I had the two in such a sort period of time, it's easy to compare them. Still, this is definitely a tasty beer worth trying."
"Pours a massive hearty white head that takes an eternity to diminish. Hazy Golden in color. Aroma carries pine and citrus notes lemon and orange, with hints of grass as well. Taste is an excellent balance of strong hop bitterness early on, with a sweeter finish to follow. An excellent beer all around!"
"I'm learning to love this style and this is one of the better Belgian IPA's I've had to date."
"I was really excited to try this beer, after all of the very excellent reviews. Perhaps my hopes were too high, as I thought is was a good beer, but not entirely excellent. The hops balance well with the sweetenss and malt base, but the finish is a little to bitter. I will try another bottle to make sure it wasn't just a fluke, but with guarded expectations. I would recommend this beer to anyone, it is certainly good."
"Very hop forward medium body with a lot of bready yeast and estery Belgian yeast, proving a lot of crisp light fruit notes. The strong hop presence up front provides an excellent dry bitterness that lingers throughout into a long dry finish. There is also a nice amount of citrus peel and grapefruit from the different hop varieties, providing a lot of complexity. Strong bready yeast character comes through mid-palate with some more citrus peel, ripe banana and peppery spiciness. Lots of estery light fruit notes, especially apple and pear add to the sweetness and the ABV is extremely well masked making this beer dangerously drinkable. There are so many different flavors bouncing off of each other making this beer extremely flavor, complex and quaffable. Highly recommended!"
"D: this is an interesting beer. it's been awhile since I've had a Belgian IPA so it's difficult to make a proper comparison to others in the style. on its own, there's a lot going on here with the yeast, hops and carbonation. The complexity is really enticing. Wish I'd had a bit more time to order another one but sadly it was time to leave. I'll catch up with Houblon Chouffe another time for sure."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Did nothing but improve as it warmed."
"Conclusion: Intoxicating, beguiling, heady...and a smack upside the head as well...what an interesting and tasty beer."
"A must try."
"This is my first (I think) taste of the Belgian IPA style and I am enjoying it. It is very drinkable despite its high gravity and I'm really digging the dichotomy of hoppy/fruity tastes and they both are distinct and do not step on to each others toes. A solid beer and a style in which I will search out more examples."
"33cl bottle. Hazy dark yellow with a meringue-like white head that lasts longer then the beer and laces liberally. Fruity and yeasty aroma with peppery spice and lots of pineapple. The flavor has lots of fruit: pineapple and citrus that seems to be from the hops. Hop flavor is big considering, but the sweet fruitiness definitely dominates it. Sweet and full, with a dry bitterness in the finish that hints at an IPA, though remains very belgian. Alcohol presence is minimal. Full and chewy mouthfeel with smooth but ample carbonation. Tripels usually aren't my favorite Belgian style, but this has an interesting complexity and clash of influences that makes it very tasty. I how an american that is used to IPAs would find this much more appealing than a typical tripel."
"Drinks like a Belgian trippel, tastes like a lambic, but smells of strong hops and bitter caramel malt. Funkiness of the yeast comes through in the end. Finishes smooth and sweet in the back on the throat."
"D - This is a very good beer the abv is well hidden making it almost too easy to drink worth trying sometime if you get the chance"
"As of tasting, this beer is chilling at the bottom of an illustrious list - the top 25 beers from Belgium. I've got a lot of Belgian beers to work through, but I'd say this deserves to be there. Its a Belgian take on an American take on a British style, and it does it well. Chouffe are pretty consistent, eh?"
"Bitter taste with a sweet finish. Appearance was all natural with sediment floating in a aged honey yellow colored liquid with a pale white 1 centimeter head. Smell was somewhat sweet and very hoppy. The beer had a smooth feel while having a slightly sudsy. This beer was pretty drinkable beer albeit high alcohol. Another fun Belgian IPA"
"glassware: tulip"
"mouthfeel/drinkability - feels heavy in the mouth but is so refreshing and drinkable even@9%abv"
"D: Good beer. Will not buy this myself though."
"Despite the considerable ABV, this is a beer that lends itself to generous quaffs of hoppy, phenolic goodness. I love it!"
"As I pour the beer, the aromas reach out - the body is topped by a rather rocky head that gradually fades and clings to the glass leaving rather nice sheeting. The aroma is superb- loads of sweetness and yeast esters just make me want to continue inhaling until my nose starts to lose the enthusiasm for the new smells. Flavor profile is equally exciting - great malt sweetness and a full flavor profile from what must be some awesome yeast balanced by a reserved bitterness. Even at 9% abv, this is an extremely enjoyable beer that I'd like to drink more of."
"This is great. This is a prime example of what a Belgian IPA should be, and not just another version of a Belgian Strong Pale Ale. Something I would recommend."
"M&D: the palate is refreshing, clean, and moderately carbonated vis-à-vis an elegant flavour profile, while alc. on the palate is simply nowhere to be found, really! This is a well-crafted hoppy Tripel and not actually quite DIPA-ish in any departments. Instead, the overall balance, integrity and cleanliness sit firmly in the Belgian Tripel tradition IMO, and proudly so."
"The taste is a light start with a strong finish. Decent mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Ok, the taste is strong hop citrus, but not strong bittering from those hops. I'm not sure why this is as the malt doesn't seem to obtrusive. Still, this is refreshing. good light spices and the hops makes this a nice summer IPA. That familiar breadiness makes this a good food beer. Perhaps with grilled burgers."
"An excellent Belgian IPA with a dominant yeast spiciness and enough sweetness to make things interesting."
"This is the second time I try Chouffe's Dobbelen IPA Tripel. I remember being blown away the first but it seems a bit over-the-top the second time around. Regardless, it's a hugely complex and interesting beer."
"D: Would be much better without the head, but still ok."
"Poured from bottle into a goblet. Pours a hazy dark straw color that leaves a big fluffy white head. This one smells like a cross between a tripel and a pilsner. I think it smells great. Fresh saaz hop aroma followed by banana and clove in the background. Upon first taste there is a strong peppery bitterness. As this one warms up peppery taste is less evident and a mild sweetness comes through. Thick mouthfeel and a creamy carbonation. This is a fine beer to drink but not overly exciting. I like the idea of a belgian ipa but the flavors seemed to fight with each other rather then mellow out."
"Golden colour, small white head, lots of lacing. Smells of grass, straw and yeast although less than is usual for the style, smells almost more like a well hopped pilsner than a tripel. Flavour is also hoppy and is also reminiscent of a pilsner more than a tripel although the yeastiness is there in the background. Mouthfeel is average with small crisp bubbles. Overall more interesting than well tasting, I don't join the hype, but it is still worth a try."
"Notes: I know that my profile lists the IRS as my favorite style, but seeing as how deciding between that, the DIPA, and the Belgian Tripel was like splitting hairs, it really means nothing. Having said that, I knew I was going to like this beer because it combines two of my favorite styles, but damn! This is a grand-slam of a beer as far as I'm concerned! It's as impressively hoppy, fruity, spicy, alcoholic, dry, and scrumptious as I was hoping for, and then some! I'm not exactly well-versed in Belgian IPA's, but one thing is for sure. This one is my favorite of all the ones I've tried so far. Highly recommended!"
"Nice triple, not to harsh but could use a bit of mellowing. Not much of an IPA IMHO, just not hoppy enough to qualify for me."
"This is an awesome beer, and I would definitely classify it as a (hoppy) Tripel before I would call it an IPA or a double IPA."
"This was actually a VERY good example of a style that has not worked for me so far. Had a really good IPA flavor . Not too much hops, not too much belgian character. Good golden color, great carbonation, very good. At this abv, it's really a double ipa but very drinkable at that ABV."
"Pours a hazy golden with a massive white head. Smells phenolic, and like alcohol. Taste is earthy bitterness, a hint of spicy Belgian yeast, and a sweet malt middle. Finish is dry and sharp hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, high carbonation. Pretty drinkable, this is a good beer. I am a bit disappointed though, especially considering the average rating of this beer is an A. It was a good beer, but I would not consider it great IMO."
"Drinkability: Very. It's sweet, yes, and that can drag in the longer run of things, but this quenched my thirst in every way and then some. Very, very awesome summer beer that I will be seeking out more of in the very near future. Highly recommended."
"I poured the last bit of the bottle into the glass to see what would happen. Now it's cloudy with bits of yeast floating around. Not much difference in taste except perhaps for a touch more sweetness."
"Be very careful in pouring this one as it has a tendency to Overfoam if not poured slowly."
"-Also If you happen to see this beer on tap, I would highly recommend you get it, drinking it out of a bottle is almost nothing compared to it on tap. It's like comparing a plain chicken filet to a chicken club sandwich, It's got the bacon and cheese!... only metaphorically, and that bacon and cheese is all it needed to be absolute perfection."
"The beer had medium body and was sort of creamy. Pretty bubbly, as well. All in all it went down nice and drank the whole 750 in one sitting no problem."
"drinkability is decent. the alcohol and overly-carbonated mouthfeel do hinder the drinkability a bit, but aside from that the brew is quite good. nicely proportioned with a hop quality that works quite well with the belgian yeast. cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is very pleasant. Slightly gritty, light and effervescent. Very drinkable."
"Excellent tripel. Not sure if I could even say it can be identified as an IPA. Although the hops are definitely more prominent than most other belgian beers. This stuff is great."
"Drinkability: This is great. The best Belgian IPA I've had yet. Its still not perfect though--that brief unpleasant bitterness on the back gets a little old. Overall though, the marriage of IPA and tripel works well in that its a nice balance of imbalance, if that makes sense. As I eat/drink the last chunk of fluffy head from my glass and look at my empty bottle, I'm sad that I don't have more."
"I liked the mouthfeel and drinkability. This is a big beer for sipping but it's just about right for a little Dutch cafe."
"D: If you find this on the shelfs (even with the whimpy gnome on the label) you must be on the wrong website if you don't first buy it and secondly drink it and thirdly enjoy it. To sum it up - BUY THIS ONE!!!"
"D- nice, but not great...definitely would not turn one down"
"Note: The draft version seems to me to be a bit more harsh, showing some alcoholic flavors. Moreover, the carbonation is less refined and mouthfeel isn't as good. This one is definitely superior in the bottle, though on draft it's still quite good."
"D- Moderately low to moderately high. This is 9%, so watch out. Still, for us hop heads this beer takes beloved hops in a new direction without compromising the integrity of the essential hop flavor we all know and love. Truly a great beer."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination made this beer pretty drinkable. Would have liked a little bit more of a bitter hop taste to it as the alcohol definitely undermined the hop presence of the beer."
"One finger spongy white head on an opaque soft golden body. Spotty lacing on the glass, decent head retention. Nose is a mix of earthy hops and yeast, some perfume. Taste is strong, flavorful, perfume, floral, sweet. Alcohol heat is noted with an excellent body, perfect carbonation on the pallet, easy to drink. A tasty Belgian IPA."
"Probably the most American-styled of the Belgian IPAs. In a good way."
"smells of lemon, citrus, a level of grassiness, and herbs (plus a hint of spice) i almost thought it was going to be like a wiezen or saison because of the light and refreshing aroma. Taste is great, lemony and grapefruit with mixes of several hops and a bit of citrus and fruit. medium bodied with a crisp, refreshing feel. tingles with carbonation and ends with a slight bitterness."
"interesting, but seems a little bit like it's just some type of blond or tripel, with some extra hops thrown in for the heck of it."
"A bit of a chimera, yet it works, not outstanding but its also greater than the sum of its parts, and very fine for what it is, and when all is said and done I'd tuck it in under an ambitous Tripel that's worth revisiting."
"Drinkability is dangerous on this one, the 9% could get you in trouble with no hint of alcohol at all. Although, I am filling up quickly with the heavy carbonation. Knock out offering. Will seek out again."
"Drinkability - I may have found a new favorite. I could easily do a session with a few of these. Even though it's a higher ABV, it's easily drinkable and very tasty. Excellent."
"It smells soft, some spice, a small amount of hops as well. Sipping this beauty of a beer,I taste grapefruit, banana, yeast, and again that faint dash of hops. Mmm, the taste leaves you yearning to sip again, why not ? The mouthfeel is well balanced and not overpowering, no bitter or dry aftertaste whatsoever. Drinkability is exceptional, and you would be unlikely to assume this clocked in at an abv of 9% if you had not been privy to that information ahead of time. A great beer with a clever marketing schtick."
"D - could use a few more hops, but overall a damn tasty belgian."
"Overall a fantastic beer, well worth seeking out."
"T: David the Gnome's finest hour. If you're expecting something similar to a West Cost IPA, prepare to be disappointed. But if you want a tripel with a little extra kick, this is the beer for you."
"One of the most drinkable beers I've ever tried. I was expecting to think that it's overpriced at $9.25 for a 750ml but I don't; I would happily pay this much for a beer this good. I could easily drink two of these back to back, though I don't know if I would want to because of the ABV. This is the best IPA I've had so far in my experience with the style."
"On an after note, I poured the rest of the bottle in my pilsner, and it foamed over bad. I would always pour it at 45 degrees and not let up at a 90 at the end or you will get the drink on the floor, table, all-of-the-above. For that, I bumped my appearance up 0.5."
"taste is very smooth, grain, corn, sour malt, hops in the back, a little citrus, banana, pear, aftertaste is bitter and a little dry."
"D: Wow. This IS refreshing. An idyllic summer brew, but watch your back as it's 9% abv can quickly catch up with you when you are under the blazing sun."
"Mouthfeel: Nothing to complain about, sharp carbonation and a thinner body than you would find in a American IPA of this strength."
"11.2oz brown bottle. Instantly foamed over the top of the bottle when opened - quickly poured into a snifter glass where a murky golden - tangerine ale was revealed with large amounts of particulates suspended throughout. Fluffy off-white head towers over the rim of the glass and is not quick to dissipate. Eventually leaves sticky chunks of lacing all the way down the side of the glass. At first I did not find it appetizing to see all the particulates, but the stickiness of the lacing won over the look of this one. Aromas were of fruity Belgian yeasts with hints of spice mixed with the familiar scent of hoppy citrus. Tastes dance on the palate as the different aspects interchange - Belgian yeast, grapefruit, mandarin orange (maybe rind) with notes of spiciness from both the Belgian side and the hop profile. Alcohol is well concealed although still present. Finishes tart, bitter, and dry. This is nicely balanced and very enjoyable. A new style for me and one I would try again!"
"D - Fantastic Belgian-inspired IPA with equal and impressive parts Tripel and IPA. Definitely one of the best I've had of this style to date."
"The beer seemed to get drier as the tasting progessed and the final (third pour) glass was a lot more hoppy than the first two, so the sediment must be heavy in the hop department."
"This is a grand beer, but not as simple just bitter as other Belgian IPAs that I have had before."
"d - lip-smacking good. i'm really getting into ipa's with belgian yeast and this was a fine offering."
"What a ale, drank the whole 750 ml bottle quickly, and felt like openning another!"
"Overwhelmingly one of my favorite belgian beers even though it is really a Belgian influenced by American style hop profiles. What a keeper! I wish I had bought more than one."
"D- Very, very drinkable especially considering the hefty 9% ABV."
"This stuff pours a cloudy golden (some of the sediment got mixed up during transport - but it works!) The aroma isn't so great - but once they change those bottles from green to brown I expect that to go away. The flavor is the biting bitterness from the hops, both the Europ and American varieties. The stuff does have a warm mouthfeel that tastes pretty boozy, but the dryness balances this out."
"Drinkability: This turns out to be a wonderfully drinkable beer but with the 9% ABV it could easily sneak up on you and thump you across the back of the head. I'll definitely want to have more of this beer, but only one portion at a time."
"pour is like few. beautiful and with a nice head of bone white with a condensing head. turns to cotton candy in about five minutes. nose of belgian sugar cane. honey malt. and candied pineapple. taste is more extravagant. honey, pollen, very mild musky saaz bitter, fruity, orange juice, lemon zest, pineapple, but more so applesauce. hops are clean but the beer is sweet. i'll be honest to say i don't like it out of the tap. too thin... too sweet and mild. muskiness is in the bottle. the sweet is nice but it takes away from the beer when the range of flavor is put on the chopping block. i will be honest as to say that i don't know what would make this beer a better example of its style besides a milder sweet."
"D: Ehhh, I finished my first glass and I'll finish the bottle.. but this won't be something I will bother with"
"Holy calamity is this thing soft! Medium body with prickly (at first), refreshing carbonation that quickly becomes very soft that really sticks to your teeth and tickles your gums."
"D - An outstanding brew in all facets... ABV is well hidden... Sophisticated... Easy drinking... I could drink this over and over and over again..."
"D= Two of my favorite styles (IPAs and Belgian tripels) blended into one fine elixir. Highly drinkable and extremely enjoyable."
"I have wanted to try this one on-tap for a while now and finally came across it at the Charlotte Flying Saucer. Served in a tulip glass a nice hazy pale yellow with a nice frothy off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is a nice amount of crisp Earthy hops and spice. The taste seems to lose a bit without the benefits of bottle conditioning. The hops, spice and sweet malts are still there, but not as profoundly as from the bottle. The beer is on the heavy side of medium with some alcohol presence. This one seems to follow in the footsteps of other Belgians such as Saison Dupont that are much better from the bottle."
"I can see why this is one of the top 5 Belgian IPAs on the site - good balance of the sweet, grassy hops meets the presence of malts and Belgian yeasts to give off that slight funk that I find to be intriguing and not at all distasteful. Definitely a world apart from most American IPAs I've tried because this beer overpowers your palate with a multitude of subtle flavors rather than just the brunt force of hop bitterness.  This is much smoother while still offering those bright, grassy/citrusy hop aromas and flavors to enjoy."
"This is a beer unquestionably worthy of an A. Wow."
"This is my favorite of the Belgian IPAs so far."
"Body is heavier than I expected. On the heavier side of medium. Super creamy and smooth. Pretty easy drinker."
"D: A very good beer, but something was just missing. The taste wasn't quite as good as the nose, and overall I'd say that I definitely prefer Piraat to this one."
"D: It's an interesting, complex beer that makes me want to keep coming back."
"This beer is a solid package all the way around. From the beautiful head, through the smooth, well balanced delivery, the pleasant bitter finish and the carbonation. I would happily drink this all afternoon."
"This beer pours a nice yellow with much sediment with a large head that takes a while to go down. It smell very refreshing and spicy. It tastes very hoppy and has a bite to it. This is a very distinct taste, not your usual IPA, but very enjoyable. I would definitely buy this again"
"D- The carbonation slows you down a bit with this beer and that's just what you need with a surprisingly quaff-able 9%ABV Belgian IPA Tripel."
"Bottom Line: Try this beer if you have not! I don't care how much it costs you, try it."
"D: A very unique and drinkable version of an IPA. Quite inspiring actually. I really liked this beer in the bottle. I do think it is nearly perfect on tap however. I'll have to seek it out again on tap and update my review. Until then, I'll pick up a few more bottles."
"I found it very drinkable - slightly filling and high ABV will keep you from plowing thru it."
"D: I had 2 of them last night, but I couldn't have a 3rd. Drinkability suffers some from the hoppiness (for me) and the sweetness. It's just a big beer and I can only have a couple of these max."
"typical heavy body for the belgian ale. hoppiness really adds a little to the mouthfeel. off the pour has strong carbonation that settles to minimal at the end of the glass, typical for belgians. pretty good drinkability just gotta watch yourself with the alcohol. go out and get this one now!"
"In short, Belgium is weird. There's a gnome on this bottle and I'm not sure I understand what they're going for with the beer. Also, I hate gnomes."
"A crisp and refreshing, but also spicy, Tripel. A good amount of hops add a citrus characteristic to the Belgian Style. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is crisp, well carbonated and with a dry finish. Intriguing and very complex beer, absolute masterpiece."
"D: I really liked this one. It manages to blend a rather aggressive and bold hop character with the sweet, fruity and yeasty character of the Belgian pale ale style in a great way. Highly recommended."
"D - I tend to lean more towards the hoppier American IPA styles but I thought I'd give this Belgian style a try. I am a big fan of other Belgian styles, particularly golden ales. This IPA isn't one that I'd drink on a regular basis but it isn't bad. I'm glad I tried it. The high ABV would probably limit most beer fans to one or two of these but it seems like a fairly well-rounded beer and representative of the style."
"Foam & head everywhere! Extremely foamy, even opening after warming for a bit. Very cloudy, golden body. Big foamy white head, somewhat lasting. Belgian flowery aroma. Some graininess, slight amount of alcohol, some spices. Watery taste, light flowery taste, some spice. Weakish for 9%. Very light flavor, watery."
"Drinkability is dangerously high as far as the ease with which this stuff goes down. What keeps it from being too drinkable -- however -- is the fact that it's 9% and that a 11.2 oz. bottle clocks in at about four and a half bones. Otherwise, this shit is straight out of sight."
"Overall this may be my favorite belgian style IPA I have had to date. Very crisp, clean, hoppy and refreshing..not to mention super drinkable. Great beer."
"Note to Self: Ranked #18 Top Beers of Belgium, #1 Belgian IPA, when I tasted it."
"D - Very interesting how this beer masks the saaz. Very drinkable, each taste gives you a little something else."
"Well - I liked this, even though I'm lukewarm to Tripels. The hoppiness is more evocative of a pilsener like Bohemian Lager than it is of an American IPA. I suppose that's because it uses Saaz hops. Worth trying at least once."
"D - excellent example of the style, a true Belgian IPA."
"I had this once quite awhile ago and just revisited it now! The nose is bursting with floral & citrus hops. It's a gorgeous pour; straw gold in color, cloudy and with a great, pudding-like head that lasts. The mouth feel is nice; juicy and very easy-drinking. The flavor! I don't want to gush so I won't but if I did I'd say WOWWW!!!! It's loaded with citrus, honey, pine, white pepper, and nicely malted. Great balance. I didn't detect the alcohol so much, so this went down way too easily."
"Received as a gift for Christmas '08. Thanks Linda."
"D 4.5 - I really enjoyed this one, it was a nice complex fun ale to experience in good company, I really liked the diverse hop notes and complexity."
"Body is medium/light, plenty of CO2 in solution, and drinkable."
"Refreshing and light which is misleading given the ABV. Not too bitter or sweet."
"Palate offers an interesting balance of background malt with citrusy sweet hops, and the light fruitiness of the yeast is at play also. Nice balance and complexity, without being hit over the head with any particular component of the experience. Long, juicy-fruit finish and again very ""fresh clean""."
"D: Solid belgian take on the ipa/tripel... i like piraat a tad better."
"The taste is fruity upfront, I suppose from the Belgium yeast, with background notes of citrus. It's well balanced, tart and tangy on the tongue. Very clean refreshing brew. Extremely drinkable, almost dangerously so. Overall the beer is light and refreshing with tremendous amounts of flavor."
"Overall: I just started getting into Belgian IPA's a little while ago and have tried a handful but this is they very best I've had. A must try for hop-heads and Belgian fans alike."
"Notes from: 4/27/06"
"D- a wonderful IPA/tripel hybrid. something id like to see more attempts at. the bottle was very easy to finish and if i had it, i could see myself going for another one. very nice."
"I had no interest in having a second one. I like Tripels, I like IPAs, I dont think they mix well. Or, maybe they would with more earthy hops instead of the citrusy."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer to a degree, but considering the competition in it's class I'd probably spend the money on something else. Slightly above average for it's style, but one can find better brews out there."
"D: Due to its tartness, crisp carbonation and upfront bitterness, I thought this beer was quite drinkable. I mean, it's not as easily quaffed as a session IPA, but with 9% abv, that's to be expected."
"I reluctantly finished this expensive bottle. I had high hopes this would be something like a belgian ""meantime"" very disapointing."
"Drinkability is incredible for a 9%ABV beer...Incredible beer!"
"Drinkability: this one was fun. It lived up to its hype and I would drink it any chance I got."
"Overall a tasty beer that I'm glad I tried."
"I had this on tap at high Street Grill. It was presented in a Chimay goblet. The beer is a clear yellow with a moderate white head, mild lacing. The aroma was dominated by citrusy hops, a background of spicy Belgian yeast. The flavor was mildly sweet with a pleasant amount of bitterness. The beer is medium bodied and it went down very easily with my Belgian Endive salad. Even though this is a hybrid style I felt this was more IPA than tripel."
"This is one of those beers that's so deceptively delicious that I had not idea what the ABV was -- it's very drinkable, in my opinion, as the palate is wiped clean & begging for more after every sip. This does not scream ""IPA"" to me. The owner of 6 & Save said it's more popular with their hopheads. I didn't find it overly hoppy -- the hops are a refreshing, breezy prelude to that sweet, creme brulee center that I loved."
"D - I half expected this to be a DIPA in the traditional American super-4C hops tradition, but these Belgian madmen have taken the hop craze to a whole new level. This is one of the strangest brews I've ever had, (though not quite as oddball as rauchbiers and roggenbiers). I would totally pick this up again. It's a nice treat to take a vacation from the endless stream of IPAs, porters, stouts, pale ales, amber ales, brown ales, and other blah brews. This unique brew takes it to the edges of the brewing envelope."
"Having said that, this is a big drink. Great for one, but the alcohol starts to really come through."
"D- I liked this beer a lot! The Belgian IPA's are becoming one of my favorite style of beers. You get the belgian triple style with a nice healthy dose of hops, what's not to like! This beer has a nice balance of triple flavors and hops without being to aggresive. I will happily drink this one on many more occasions. Cheers!"
"This is an inspired beer. Poured from a 750cl bottle into a Chimay glass. Very cloudy, chunky unfiltered golden liquid. Fluffy cloud of head on top. A handsome beer. Smell is yeasty and fruity. Taste is a nice balance of hops and summer fruit sweetness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth going down. Nice aftertaste. I only regret that I lost about a third of this chilled bottle when I opened it (I had not shaken it and I was very careful opening it). The Gnomes' share I guess."
"D: 1-3"
"This beer is great, definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Interesting beer, definitely a blend of two worlds. Tastes sort of like what it is, a Belgian pale with hops. However, not my cup of tea (or mug of beer as it would be). Something to try, but not something I would drink again."
"Drinkability is incredible all around one of the hoppiest yet most drinkable beers I've had. The balance and extreme flavors make this brew awesome in every way I'm glad my local just got a case in, now I will really be able to enjoy it for a couple months at least. This brew doesn't exactly jump off the shelves. I will continue to drink this one available to me, I can't believe I've never seen this beer in Pittsburgh."
"From the label I expected a confused beer, trying to be too many things at once, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is a fine brew. I found it pleasant, drinkable and a smooth combination of flavors not usually found in the same glass."
"D - I've found this beer to be very drinkable. The several times I've encountered this beer, it has been shared with friends during tastings and this one is always the 'best of show'. The hybrid style seems to appeal to the best of both the IPA and Triple crowd and both 'camps' will be very happy."
"Poured a semi hazy yellow golden color with a HUGE super fluffy white head. Aroma is citrusy, yeasty and a fruitiness, especially pear and apple. Now this is interesting. Never had a belgian IPA before! Tastes like a typical strong pale beligian but with hops! Not super hoppy though just enough. I dunno, this is kinda weird but i think i like it. Might be the bunk ass cheese i had before this. Feel is kinaa slick and sticky with some carbonation tingly."
"Drinkability- low, I don't find this enjoyable. I poured it out, and will be complaining to the guy who recommended it to me. He often refuses to sell beers he thinks are too old, so I don't think this was a skunked bottle."
"T Velvety smooth all throughout. Lots of lemon at the beginning which lasts through the taste, a nice tartness kicks in around the middle with some bitter malts and finishes yeasty but nicely"
"D - SO easy... too easy."
"Drinkability: I was a little leery at first, but this combination works incredibly well, having imparted the finer points of both the tripel and the IPA into its flavor profile"
"M/D: I expected the beer to feel more carbonated than it did. The beer was smooth and crisp. Very drinkable and one that I will most certainly pick up again."
"D: An interesting hybrid. A triple to be sure, but with these fantastic bitter undercurrents"
"I cannot think of many beers I like better than this. Pours a yellowy cloudy/unfiltered straw color with pillows of head. The smell is sweet and floral with a nice hoppy smell of citrus in the background. The taste follows right along with everything from hops to yeast and spice. Just a fantastic beer to drink."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Honey blonde with a ton of suspended yeast particles. Big white whipped meringue-like head lasts long after the pour. Leaves big sticky rings of lace all down the glass. Citrusy and aromatic piney hop notes with soft honey dominate the nose. Big and bold IPA hop flavor with a nice hit of candy sugar sweetness to balance the dry almost champagne like finish. Nice medium heavy mouthfeel with a very fine smooth carbonation. Extremely drinkable, alcohol is well hidden. One of my all time faves."
"D- This is a great Belgian IPA and definitely my favorite so far. The hop bill is pretty impressive on this Belgian beer. This really seems to combine my favorite IPA and BSPA aspects well to make for one awesome beer. I will definitely buy this again when I see it."
"D- great drinkability despite its intensity. a very sophisticated brew."
"This beer pours a very cloudy, light amber, with a 2-3 fingered head and tons of lacing. The smell is of citrus. The taste has some orange zest flavors, some grapefruit... all coming from the hops with a wonderful malt base to contrast to the huge hop flavor, a wonderful example of balancing huge hop flavors with beautiful malt bases. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, just a little overcarbonated for my liking. The only thing that hurts the drinkablility is the carbonation level as for a 9%'er this is an incredibly easy beer to drink."
"A wonderful, layered beer. Massive, foamy head. Crisp hops with orange slices, balanced by a bit of dough and a fairly malty finish. Malty, but not cloying. Excellent mouth feel, with plenty of carbonation that seems to release the flavor without distracting from it. Very drinkable, which is a bit dangerous. ; )"
"3.7/5"
"The body is moderate with a somewhat sweet finish. A bit hard to pick out with the bitterness. Some soap finish notes but ok. Overall, the hop notes are a little off specifically bittering hops. Would like a drier finish overall and some cleaner malt flavors. But still easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Pours hazy gold with an uncontrollable white head. Big, white, and rocky, it always exploded out of the glass with the slightest pour. The hop aroma is nearly identical to any English IPA. The yeast and spice are there, but drowned out. The same goes for the flavor. Bitter, soapy, and waxy, with more wood, pepper, and pine than sweet citrus. Some esters and tripel-like spice in the end, but unremarkable. Its a good beer, with a big identity crisis."
"D_Surprisingly enough, extremely easy to drink. Does not way you down, and alcohol does not make its presence known hardly at all. Unbelievable"
"The ABV is exceptionally well hidden in this dangerously drinkable brew. Nicely carbonated, medium bodied. Very crisp in taste and feel."
"D: For a belgian, and at 9%, pretty good."
"There's a nice creamy mouthfeel, with some good carbonation. The hop spicyness really leaves my mouth dry, though. The alcohol is virtually undectable in this one, too. I'm glad I spent the money on this one."
"Overall, it is drinkable. Certainly an unusual beer. That is a good thing since it makes it interesting, but it is also a bad thing since the various flavors didn't quite work for me. Didn't blend well. The sweetness was too strong."
"Picked up a 750ml bottle. Poured into a snifter glass. Pours a dark yellow color with a huge foamy head...almost made me think I did a bad job of pouring. The head lingered for quite some time. Smells of yeast and hops, with a bit of citrus and spice. Not an overwhelming aroma. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a smooth texture. Tastes a bit hoppy and bitter, and the spice and fruit is subtle. It's a smooth and enjoyable beer that goes down easy."
"Overall, I was a little disappointed in the presentation of this beer. Besides the gushing, there were little particles floating throughout the glass. Nice beer to contrast to the typical American IPA counterpart."
"750 ml bottle acquired via trade. Pours out an insane amount of foamy white head. Every pour fills about 70% foam. A light orange color. The aroma is pretty light; lots of rich malts and some spices. The flavor is interesting; like a Belgian Strong Ale combined with a IPA. Lots of spices, yeast, and some citrus, but also a bitter hop finish. The alcohol is fairly light, and the mouthfeel is very creamy and full. Quite nice, but not amazing."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite of their offerings, no need to have it again."
"Poured a hazy orange color with a large white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of orange, grass, floral hops, yeast, buttercream, honey and some barnyard. Taste of tart citrus, spices, aloe leaf, honey, grass, toasted dough, with alcohol and heavy carbonation."
"D: While I'm failing to notice the 9% ABV, it's not my sobriety that will keep me from reaching for another but my tastebuds themselves. All said and done, a pretty unique beer, one that I probably will revisit a few times a year when i see it on tap. I guess Belgian IPAs aren't quite my thing :-("
"Overall: Another delicious brew from the great brewery. The empty bottle now sits longingly next to my garden gnome in the vain attempt to scare off snails."
"D-Once was enough. I'm sure there are some out there that would love to sit with this one all day, but not me."
"This is an outstanding beer. One of the hoppiest Belgians I've ever consumed for sure, and something I will surely have again."
"I would have smoked this even more, but I'm trying hard to be fair despite being pissed that I'm still wiping beer off me and the rug."
"I would rate this as one of the better triple or Belgian pale ales I have had."
"Well, this is certainly a high alcohol beer, the flavor doesn't hide it at all. Is it more IPA than Tripel? Yes. In fact, I'd go on the record as saying this has all the elements of an IPA, and only the smells of a Tripel. Interesting, if ultimately forgettable."
"Notes: Alcohol is well masked and this is just so easy to drink. A wonderful concoction and something I really looked forward to having. The taste is just so unique.World class brew from where else,but Belgium."
"The mouth is thick and creamy. The viscosity of this one leaves a mouth-coating aftertaste for days. Those really must have been floaters in there. A bit too heavy on the carbonation. Medium to full bodied."
"D: This one tastes strong, prefer the Urthel Hop It but still a great beer- love the style. Superior partner to some mussels."
"Poured into my chalice this hazy golden liquid produced a nice white two fingered head. An eruption of bubbles flow from the bottom of my vessel to the surface. The smell of hops, along with belgian yeast are the first sign that you have a unique beverage in your hand. Nice sweet taste up front, than the presents of some spice, and fruit, white pepper, then the finish of the piney hops. A brew just begging for another sip. Nice full mouthfeel, with those little bubbles dancing around your tongue. A pleasure to drink!"
"served in a 750 ml. DELICIOUS! very surprising and fruitful. the brew dances on the palette. wonderful to have a Belgian ale that is IPA rock'n'roll style. this is what will turn me unto a belgian drinker, if there is any. it looks a beautiful cloudy pale wheat, good looking brew. the smell is delectable, it got my nose too close, and i was not cross (aside from the have sip lost). the taste stays with you. fruity and well rounded with an aftertaste that sticks to the gums. a true fine wheat taste. i could drink it all day... well, a good two, but would need a mix-it-up. definitely drinkable for two to a few, but wouldn't feel comfortable drinking all night. a must try, for sure. its hard to drink the keystone light and PBR after this, but it is too good to follow it with a home brew (mine are really good). this is a great beer, buy it, try it, and enjoy yourself."
"I could drink this all day a great belgian here, but like them all probably would have to limit oneself."
"D: Pretty drinkable for the bitterness and complexity."
"D: Drinks rather easily, given its 9.0% abv. Could have probably 2 or 3, then would be a little too soused to want to keep enjoying."
"It's a no-brainer that if you like Belgian and Belgian-style beers and you like American IPAs, you should try this. I feel that it's the eccentric cousin of the American IPA. Worth a try at least."
"Very full mouthfeel and very little alcohol make this a great beer to drink. Hard to believe it is 9% abv."
"D - This is a big, spicy, hoppy beer. The flavors are robust and hard to ignore, especially the grapefruit hop flavors reinforced by the wheat sourness. Certainly not a session beer, but a complex and very interesting beer that would go great with seafood or maybe even dessert."
"Notes: This is certainly a high hops beer and it you like that then you may love this beer. It is certainly superior to other ""hopped up"" beers that I have had. This is a very solid beer."
"Overall, this was one hell of a Belgian IPA. Tons of citrus and hop flavors that I will be getting again!"
"I'll be back for more."
"Very good, very drinkable beer. Well balanced. A very interesting new beer experiment. Well done."
"At 9% ABV and alcohol warming does not make this an easy drinking beer. A nice experiment of combining a Belgian beer with hop aromas and flavors."
"Very very nice, loved this beer, one of my new favorites."
"Overall: don't be afraid, it's really nice"
"D - At 9.0% ABV one can only take so much but let there be no doubt I could swirl down one of these 1 PT.9.4 ounce bottles with no problem - as long as I'm sitting down. Wow."
"Poured into a goblet. Pours a hazy yellow with a huge soft, white head that won't end. Really pretty beer. Smells belgian- very spicy, lemons, some grassy hops. Taste is similar. I liken this more to a tripel than an IPA. I get some hop bitterness with the spicy belgian yeast taste, but not as biting as the De Ranke xx bitter. Very easy to drink, despite the 9% abv."
"Glad to split with a friend but could finish a bottle alone."
"I dig it. It's in my little black book of go to brews."
"D: Went down nicely. Had a 12oz pour and I could have had more. Really nice.Still I feel this is better in the bottle. This is the second time I have had this on tap and this was leaps and bounds better than the first time. That being said there is a huge variance between bottles as well."
"Overall, I deeply love American IPAs and am a big fan of Belgian ales too; I thought I would enjoy this one more than I did. It seemed less a cross between styles and more its own form altogether. Still, it's a tasty beer!"
"Drinkability: Absolutely no alcohol note, but you can definitely feel it afterwards. This is a truly an outstanding and complex beer, and ranks up there with some of the best I've ever had. You really can't knock it for too much, and stylistically, it's spot on - the best Belgian IPA I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"This is a beer worth trying if you enjoy the two styles. Not overly strongly resembling either style, but an excellent clash of the two."
"One heck of a drinkable beer. Too much so probably. If it wasn't 9.0% ABV I would have a new sessioon beer."
"Very delicious brew but the ABV a limiting factor obviously. Another quality showing from Brasserie d'Achouffe. Could drink this any day of the week and look forward to the next time."
"D- this beer showcases the unique balance between a very strong IPA and a very special Belgian Tripel"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finish is dry. Carbonation is low, and is perfect for this beer. Body is medium-light. Alcohol is hidden well, and this is an easy drinking beer. This is one that I'd not be opposed to drinking all night. I'll definitely be picking this one up again....very soon, I think I'll go with the 750 and keep it colder than 38 F when I open it, hopefully there'll be less chance of a gusher."
"D - Nice to sip on. Great beer all around"
"D: Very smooth and spicy in nature making for a very interesting drink. A definite try."
"There is alot going on, behind a beautiful, seductive appearance. A billowing, bright white, storm cloud head grows on top of a foggy, dark orange abyss. An aroma of flowers, chamomille, bitter peels and honey suckle, carry away the senses. Initial hit taken is peppercorn, and the wind is knocked out of me. Second attempt reveal bitter, flower stems and peels behind the spice. Oil streams carry herbs downstream to paradox; bitter-sweet. Complexity is key. Translating this one into words is a bit of a struggle."
"Whoa, a trippy beer that can take you on a magic carpet ride of flavors from beginning to end. Gorgeous looks of golden lion's mane with a big, fat head that makes the brew look picturesque. Strong scents of hops wrestling with orange peels, and cloves interrupts the match for a quick clothesline. On this great acid trip of taste you will glide through orange groves, sail the 7 seas with Captain Hops, have some lemonade with the Mad Hatter, talk with the Chouffe in a field of cloves, and arrive back home eating a peanut butter and chocolate sandwich hours later as if nothing ever happened. Is it all a dream or is that the 9.0% ABV playing tricks on you? The alcohol bite is there and then not there depending on what taste you concentrate on; a brilliant illusion in this hall of mirrors. So sit back and enjoy this Lewis Carroll creation of a brew."
"Drinkability- It is a great beer the combination of these two styles are awesome."
"M: lively carbonation, helps promote the bitterness, promotes the scent to be notices while drinking. This is a fantastic example of good belgian beer crafting. without a doubt one of the best that I've ever had from our belgian friends."
"D-I would like to always have one or to of these around cause when the itch comes nothing"
"Golden-yellow color, white lacey head. Smells of banana sweetness and spice... I found that both the smell and taste are affected by which point you are drinking from the bottle if it has been cellared upright. At first opening, it has a light banana spice smell, much like that of a belgian pale but those scents mingle with a breadiness and citrusy grapefruit as you near the bottom of the bottle. This beer has an exceptional balance of flavors with a tripel style sweetness, belgian spice, and hop backing. The same flavors also create an interesting, refreshing moutfeel. The Saaz hops create a mineral astringency on the sides of the tounge, while the amarillo adds a warming bitterness to the back of the throat, and the light fruit sweetness cools the palate. Plenty of flavors mingling with nothing overpowering. As I continue to pour this and near the bottom of this bottle flaky yeast and haziness accumulates adding breadiness. Grapefruit bitterness also increases toward the end of this bottle. A beautiful, fairly complex, yet very drinkable brew with no noticeable alcohol content."
"Cloudy (and lumpy) pale orange with a huge white head that lasts and lasts. Smells tripely - it's all about candy and light caramel. It smells.. Astringent. Which isn't a big surprise in a Belgian and darn it, it has an astringent flavor to it as well. It tastes like... A cross between a Hop^3 and a really astringent Belgian. Sweet, floral hops. A little bitter in the end. I'd think that without the astringency it would be awesome."
"Drinkability - As a phenomenal tripel this one more than holds it's own against the best of it's style. So well rounded and easily sipable. Belgian brewing at it's best."
"D - One of the easiest drinking beers I have had in a while. Extremely enjoyable beer. One of the better belgian IPA's I have had. This would be even better on tap."
"Opinion: This is a really nice Tripel! I am not sure exactly where the ""IPA"" reference comes in except that there are some American citrusy hops used in the beer rather than European hops. Other than the fact that I don't get the dry bitterness that you expect from an IPA (and I am glad that isn't the case BTW), this is a really nice brew."
"Extremely drinkable--dangerously drinkable! It's such a refreshing and seemingly sessionable ale. All around very tasty."
"Pours a murky bright yellow with a hugh beautiful persistent head that just doesn't go away. Aroma is mostly herbal hops. Saaz is the dominant varietal in nose (The bottle says Saaz is one of the hops used.) There are also some citrusy notes in the aroma. As I begin to drink this the citrus aroma is definitely coming out more. Oranges. Taste is fairly sweet. It definitely has that tripel malt character. Must be the yeast. There is that distinct Belgian phenolic and spicy flavor. But it's the hops that are the real story here. Mostly citrusy american hop character. Oranges again. Definitely a more herbal noble hop note is present as well. Pretty full bodied and well carbonated. Finishes somewhat dry. A bit of alcohol is barely noticeable. Dangerously drinkable. This is the first Belgian IPA I've tried and I'm definitely a fan. Everything works together incredibly well in this beer. Awesome stuff."
"M/D- Nothing wrong here. It's good. It was much better than I thought it would be since I didn't think the Belgian yeast character would mesh well with increased hops but it actually worked ok. Bitterness was fairly low but the taste and aroma of hops were increased to make for a nice experience."
"Interesting, affordable & worth a look if you can get it."
"D - Awesome. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable. I can definitely see grabbing several more bottles of this."
"Overall, despite the bottle nearly exploding on me, it ended up tasting great. Very nice hybrid type beer that I would gladly purchase again."
"The mouthfeel is a little sticky, and it coats the palate quite nicely. As far as drinkability goes, I'm glad I shared the bottle with my wife and a friend. I wouldn't have wanted the whole thing. It's quite filling."
"bought in to my store, sold half a case in one day! ... pours with an obscenely huge white rocky pederasts head and lacing ... lots of sweet honey and fresh pie with caramel (then blended on puree) .... is very smooth and delicious ... another beuty from the chouffers!! ...broccoli heads??"
"Poured into the best available wine goblet, this beauty poured a light yellow gold color, a bit clouded, with a big white frothy head and solid lacing. The aroma is wheaty citrus with a surfside freshness, salt air sweetness. The flavor brings on more of the same with some bubblegum highlights and light citrus over a mellow sweet malt. Kind of grapey, fair drinkability, nicely carbonated, a pleasant viscosity. Very nice, fairly unique stuff from my experience."
"My thinking was that too much hopping would diminish the complexities of the Belgian Yeast. This CAN be true in some beers. Not in this one. This one nails it to produce an excellent beer. It took a few years, but I'm hooked!"
"Upon warming a bit the smell hasn't changed that much. As I should have figured, though, this tastes much more like a Belgian pale than an American (or even British) IPA. Lots and lots of spicy yeast, very little alcohol zing or burn. Strong nodes of spicy european hops end things out. No huge complexity, no giant burn of hopiness. But it's wonderfully balanced and tastes great."
"Interesting combination of styles. Hoppiness not quite what I'd expect for an IPA. Finish out a little drier to improve drinkability."
"This beer was tasted in a wine glass. The beer pours a cloudy yellow with a rocky off white head that holds wonderfully and laces incredibly. Obviously the Belgian Yeast and massive hops combine for this wonderful head. The smell is full of Belgian yeasty spiciness and citrusy/spicy hops. Very nice aroma here. The taste is up front with hop bitterness. Again citrusy and spicy hops. A nice fruity and spicy hop character, with a toasty malt character. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall a nice way to combine a tripel with an IPA."
"Pours an effervescent golden hue with a pillowy white head that mountains up to the top of the snifter. As the head recedes it leaves thin tiny bubbles, thickly laced in spotty patterns across the walls of the glass. Smell is intense! Ripe pear, green apple, orange juice, banana, white pepper, and clove. Taste isn't quite as intense as the nose, however it is very balanced and very unique in a good way! Begins with sweet banana bread and transitions into a citrus orange zest with a tongue tingling peppery finish. The alcohol slowly warms the back of the throat but is never overbearing. Everything balances everything out. No doubt there is a lot going on in this glass, the champagne like mouthfeel certainly helps melt it all together and dance it across the taste buds."
"Thanks to BA member OnSlow (our local brew stocker) for ordering and letting us know that he had it!"
"This beer is superb. I like the hoppiness and how the belgian influence takes a backseat. Give this a try definetly."
"M/D= Mouth feel is really light and dry from the high carbonation. But if anything this makes the drinkability really easy and smooth."
"Notes: I had high hopes for this and was slightly let down. I guess I was hoping for an Aldebaran, but got an overly sweet, as opposed to overly hoppy brew. I would love to try this fresh, on tap."
"Mouthfeel is initially slick, moderately carbonated, but finishes dry and crisp and tingly. Pretty drinkable, but I expected some juicier hops."
"Drinkability - an unseasoned palate of mine might not have appreciated this as much. A merry-feeling combo of two good styles. Thumbs up for the guys in the Ardennes. A good beer tasting pick for palates in the know."
"Taste is crisp and citrusy, almost soda pop-like, and really refreshing. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation and a solid herbal bitter hoppiness that balances the sweet, fruity brew, contributing mightily to top-notch drinkability."
"This beer actually has some heat, as I'm finishing this fine unique Belgian ale, I'm feeling some heat, this is some spicy beer!"
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a nice big white head with a great lacing. Color is cloudy tan/gold. Smells like a Belgian floral beer, very interesting. A definite bitter floral smell of hops is present. Taste is a slightly bitter hop flavor. Hops are slightly citrus. Tastes very good, fairly balanced even with an emphasis on the hoppy profile. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, but I just let it sit and sip on it while swirling it. Overall this is very nice, good drinkability."
"Drinkability: Way to really jazz up the tired, old tripel style, guys!"
"The beer poured a hazy, straw-yellow with an enormous white, fluffy head into a pint glass. The aroma was the distinct bubble-gum sweetness of Belgian yeast. The taste was more of that distinct Belgian yeast, sweet and fruity, but also with a hefty hop flavor and bitterness blended in as well - a nice complement to the candy sugar sweetness. A bit fizzy mouthfeel, but still a very drinkable brew."
"pours a clear pale yellow into a snifter. Huge fluffy three finger head lasts for days, leaving a thick sheet of lacing on the sides of the glass. The sediment comes in the last third of the bottle, clouding the brew like crazy. Nose is sweet fruits, spice, and citrus. The taste starts off sweet & tripel-like, with sweet fruits & sugar. The hops & bitterness hit towards the end, creating an interesting balance. Hoppy, but not overly so. Insanely drinkable, the 9% doesn't show at all. A very unique & very tasty brew; one to ne sought out for sure. Big thanks to goodbyeohio for hooking me up!"
"A truly spiritual experience, Chouffe is a Godsend; I couldn't imagine enjoying drinking a beer any more than this. If I were to ever meet the brewer, I would most certainly need to give him/her a thanks, a handshake, and a hug. Thank you."
"Goes down like water is the major complaint, real smooth where I'd like a beer this good to make some resistance on the way down. The hop character here is downplayed, sort of has this nice mix of spice and light hops and belgian sugar sweetness. Incredibly fresh tasting beer, refreshing."
"Amazing..."
"The body is silky smooth with perfect carbonation. This was my first experience with this style, but this was fantastic. A fantastic hybrid between Belgian and American brews."
"I had been looking forward to trying this one for a while, and I had really no idea what to expect as it was the first beer for me to try in the style. I was surprised by a lot about it. It poured a nice golden color with a thick foamy head. The balance in this beer was tremendous with a nice amount of bitterness and alcohol that was very well-hidden. I shared a bottle with a friend and we both found it highly drinkable."
"Bottle exploded. Lost 1/3 of beer. Pours cloudy gold with a substantial white head. Bready byeasty aroma with strong notes of citrus and spice. taqste has initial components of grass and citrus, but spicy hops take over and lead to a peppery, bitter finish. Definitely an impressive beer. Wish it didn't spill over."
"A great beer, indeed."
"D- No hint of the 9% which means dangerously drinkable. First time I've had it and very glad its readily available."
"Overall, pretty drinkable beer. A refreshing, summery ale."
"Overall a great drinker. My tulip glass was emptied in no time at all."
"This beer was absolutely incredible. Nice golden color with a cloudy appearence with a masssive foamy white head that coated my glass. Wonderful citrus, spiced aromas followed by a crisp and spicy hop flavor that was well-balanced. At 9% abv, The alcohol was well hidden. I have to say this is my favorite Belgian IPA so far."
"Over all, a truly fine Belgian delight. This beer is a study in contrasts; both sweet and bitter without coming across as disjointed or confused. Leave it to Brasserie d'Achouffe to challenge both the mind and the palate with another terrific creation. Whether you're a fan of the Belgian tripel style or a devotee of the American hop-bomb, there is something for you to like in this beer. Far from a session beer, the Dobbelen IPA Tripel is one I could enjoy with great frequency if not quantity. Well done."
"D:a awesome and complex beer balance of malt and Hops is great , watch out for the alcohol content this is a great beer, I do not really care for IPA but this is in the top for me, will drink it any chance I got."
"D - Quite drinkable for 9%. Very tasty, well balanced and more importantly intriguing."
"This is such a brilliant blend of styles that it blows my mind. Pretty darn drinkable for 9%, and an experimental style to boot. An inspiring beer for sure."
"Good beer, for sure."
"Fine carbonation adds to the pleasure of this beer. Its a nice beer with multiple facets to it. Being my first Belgian IPA I dig the style. Its not as biting as an American style IPA and its got more personality then an English one. A nice one that I am sure will spur on my beer obsession."
"I got her down easily enough, but it's not near the top of my list for an encore."
"Although this is one great beer, a little more carbonation in this brew would put this near perfection. Still, this beer in a word: YUM!"
"I would definitely give this a try again sometime. A really enjoyable and unique brew."
"Notes: This was a good choice, and will remain with me forever on this special day."
"I liked this beer, but I found that after finishing one I did not really think I could handle another. The big, strong flavors here are very good but not something I can handle a lot of."
"The best of both worlds is present in this IPA. The citrus notes of a classic Belgium Ale are followed by the intense hops you would expect from an American IPA with a clean finish thanks to the alcohol. Great for a sipping beer, but it is best cold. Other reviews have noted the lacing and head retention, but seeing is believing for this one. Definately worth your time."
"All in all, another tasty ftom the chouffe guys. This is one I will try again."
"Totally dig the mix of flavors in this hybrid. Only thing I would add to it is a little more amarillo. Otherwise an outstanding brew that I will probably never know how to pronounce."
"I've never really had anything like this before. Its a strong Belgian with lots of hops. You can't go wrong with this one or any others by the same brewers."
"Houblon Chouffe poured a hazy and bright lemon yellow color with a decent sized head of white foam. I thought the retention was OK, but it could have been better. It managae to leave to leave behind a handful of foamy white rings along the edge and spots of lace here and there. The aroma was a bit on the yeasty side with spicy citrus hops, a pinch of citrus fruits, and a dash of pine in the background. The taste started of gentle with yeast and fruit esters and then after the esters have passed, in comes the dried citrus hops, a drop of lemon, more citrus fruits, and then it finished up with fruity yeast. The hops in here weren't as aggressive as I thought they were going to be. It was a medium bodied beer that contained a nice aftertaste of citrus hops and fruity yeast. I couldn't help but notice that it really masked it's high 9% ABV. There was no way of knowing from the taste or mouthfeel that the ABV% was that high. Overall, a nice not too overly agressive hoppy Belgian beer."
"D-might go for something a little cheaper but its a great beer"
"D - The gnomes always seem to make beers that require you to take your time, and this is no exception. You can't swig it as easily as most American DIPAs...but nearly all serious beer lovers are gonna be happy with this beer. Hopheads will love it, aficionados of Belgian beers will love it, and there's enough malt and interesting spicy yeast stuff going on to satiate those who like their beer rich and malty. It will also satisfy those who love a good hoppy farmhouse ale (like me!) Not for the neophyte, though. Cut your teeth on American DIPAs and BSPAs, and then get back to this. This Belgian IPA thing is a great idea, and the Brasserie d'AChouffe is just the brewery to execute it to near-perfection. The level of craft here is very evident...if I ever make it to Belgium, these guys are tops on my list of places to visit. This might even be their best beer, and that's saying a lot. All hail the gnomes!"
"D - Drinkability is good. Overall, the beer is smoother than expected. Alcohol is somewhat hidden which makes this beer go down even easier. Definitely a beer I would have again."
"Overall, this is a pretty cool combination of a Belgian ale with big hops. Definitely worth trying."
"my first belgian double ipa, who would of thought the style existed, very few exist according to BA, so here goes maybe the only one i'll ever try. it looks like a hefe, a cloudy yellow color with a big white head, tons of lacing, and a huge huge head, smell is like a hefe aswell, but with more hop undertoes. taste is absolutely magical, its just amazing. im at a loss for words, its like heaven came down in the form of a beer and poured itself for me to drink. its unlike any beer i've ever had, its a very mild double ipa, its nothing like any american double IPA's, not even remotely as hoppy as most american ipa's, but has a more malty flavor to it, and alot of carbonation. i really can't formulate any words, its just perfect."
""
"The flavor is also quite grassy, but brings along other notes: tangy orange, pepper, lemon, dandelion, and booze. A nice alcohol bite grips the back of the palate, it's not overwhelming and quite pleasant. The mouthfeel is thick & bubbly, with a prickly hop, grass, & alcohol finish. An excellent aftertaste of American-style hops is left behind. This is one of the most drinkable Belgian beers around, even at 9% ABV. It's complex, tasty, smooth, refreshing, and certainly a brew I'll be purchasing again."
"Very good mouthfeel. This is a very good tripel. I'm going to slowly enjoy this."
"Had this on-tap at a bar in Amsterdam in December. I had never had it and I chose it at random, but I was not disappointed. It was served in the Chouffe glass - pours very cloudy, with a thick head. Great smells of citrus - lots of lemon. Very drinkable for a beer with such high alcohol content. Very complex, but balanced, good hop flavor balanced by the citrus. Overall, an exceptional beer, so much so, I ordered another one. I was very happy to find it in my local liquor store on Columbus St in Boston."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. Very drinkable despite being 9% abv. I could drink a few more of these easily. Overall, this is an excellent beer. Highly recommended."
"D: Superior malt to hop balance. Very complex and enjoyable. This is a beer lovers dream...best of BSPA and American IPA."
"M-Crisp, light and sweet despite high alcohol. Carbonation is just right, and balance is good."
"It's a potent brew, but so delicious you will end up having at least a little too much. Very nice beer - one I would be more than happy to enjoy anytime - but my favorite IPA (of any variety) is still Urthel's."
"Bought this beer as a single after seeing it was a combo of two of my favorites (belgian tripel, and an IPA). Poured a very cloudy golden color with a two and a half finger head, which lingered a half a finger throughout the drink. Aroma was of a lot of citrus but my sinuses have been acting up so my nose is really not up to snuff. Taste was everything I expected. First drink there was a lot of hops up front, then mild malts, with a dry hopped finish. After that it was strange. Some drinks I primarily tasted the first combo, others were a rich malty taste with a hoppy finish. Very nice and different. Mouthfeel was good, with good carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability was a little too good,(if thats possible) because I found myself sipping on it continuously because it was so tasty but different than anything I've previously had. I will be buying this again.... soon."
"Clean, crisp and airy to the nose, spicy and tart to the mouth. Saaz dominates, with the amarillo (a sombrero on the label) and tomahawk (feathers) bringing up the rear. The light spice of a triple, the hop presence of a pale ale, I found it quite intriguing and enjoyable."
"Very crisp and light for the high abv. and very easy to drink. These could get you in trouble."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is massive, billowy, and recedes at a glacial pace into thick, chunky lacing. The aroma is of citrus, orange peel, barnyard, and hints of grapefruit, and caramel. The taste begins with funky barnyard, then some citrus, and finishes with dry, lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. I like how the aroma and taste differ. I would drink this again."
"D - Exceptional! My first Belgian IPA and I loved it. I may have to pick up a couple bottles to see how it tastes that way."
"This is dangerously drinkable and pure pleasure. I am not an advocate of mixing beers, but if you could perfectly mix a Orval with a traditional Belgian IPA, this would be it. Outstading beer."
"Overall I urge all fans of Belgian and IPA beers to seek this beer out at all costs."
"D: Yes. If I weren't driving a rental, 2-wheel drive minivan (they were out of every other type of car) on icy Maine roads, I would've had more than one. It is intensely flavorful, and I don't think I could session these, but I'd be good for a couple. And given the high ABV and the powerful flavor profile, that says quite a lot."
"D- very tasty and well balanced, recommended, very interesting for the palette indeed."
"Mouthfeel is slightly creamy from the head with a nice dry pucker. Lingering musty after taste. Very enjoyable."
"M + D: A nice body, smooth and almost creamy, but with a dry finish. One I'd get again and again... I had meant to get more Chouffe products for a while, and finally had a fellow make the recommendation of it this evening, so I decided it was time. It was a wise choice. I'll have to buy him a beer next time around! A nice drinker... goes down very smooth. The touch of alcohol warmth serves as a gentle reminder that it's got some oomph, but it's still nice for a little beyond sipping."
"Must try this again at the cold end of the range (45) vs. the warm end (55). I appreciate the quality of the individual components of this deal but feel like the guy in that bad SNL ""Appalachian Emergency Room"" skit with the railroad spike through his head - ""My head ain't hurt 'dis bad since I did one of 'dem Su-do-ku puzzles..."" I really want to have this without the Saaz and replacing them with something like, dunno...Columbus? This is very well made but stands the palate on its @$$ end something fierce. Impressive."
"Had on tap at the Englander in San Leandro. Poured into a Chouffe tulip glass. Poured a cloudy golden color, with only a small head remaining by the time it reached my table. Smell was bubble gum, hops, and glorius sweet yeasty funk smell. The taste was fantastic. It had a distrinct bubblegum / sweet yeast taste, that was balanced by an underlying bitterness."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a bunch of yeast floaties in suspension and a towering white head. The aroma is great. It has a nice pale malt scent that's sweet and dry with a slight warming effect. The hop aroma is excellent. It blends well with the spicey yeast scent and the malt aroma. The taste is great as well. This beer has a ton of complexity. The malt taste is solid: pale with a dry finish. The yeast component is wonderful. It's earthy with a spicey character. The hops provide a bitter edge, but they really work well with the yeast. The spiciness is a wonderful companion. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This beer lived up to the hype. It complex and flavorful; a damn good drinker."
"D: Delicious and keeps me wanting more. It is strong though!"
"Drinkability is fair, not overwhelmingly bitter so I was easily able to finish a 750ml myself. However, I recommend drinking this brew slowly or the 9% ABV will catch up with you."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle which exploded upon opening. Pours an electric pale orange color with a good sized pure white head that left some fantastic rocky lacing and chunky cap. The smell is excellent, nice Belgian spices, light banana and clove, candi sugar, barn yard funk yeast combined with a citrus like hop aroma. The taste is of a beautiful golden Belgian ale, definitely tripel like with the candi sugar, Belgian yeast. The phenols don't stand out as much as a traditional tripel. There is a noticable hop presence in the finish. Stale grassy hops with a light piney and citrus hop combination. The feel is moderate with tingly carbonation, finishes a hair slick but with some hoppy bitterness."
"I could drink this beer for the rest of the night. Good beer."
"My only criticism of this beer is the fact that the beer exploded upon opening, leaving me with only a portion of the contents and pushed the yeast into suspension. Other than that this beer is a thing of beauty. Hop character is classy yet in your face. It reminds me of a blend of Duvel, Saison Dupont, and an American IPA like Bridgeport IPA. Unique. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a very convincing Belgian IPA."
"Had this before on tap at Monk's and Teresa's Next Door, but today I am having this at home. Overall a well brewed Belgian attempt to fuse a tradition belgian tripel and American IPA. I love this particular style because I love hops, but also this style has provided me more familiarity of tripels whcih has led to a love of them and saisons. I do especially like the yeasty and funk notes the tripel provides, and the subtle european hops creep through a bit stronger after you swallow your sip. I love the fruity character of this beer, and yeasty beer sediment is at the bottom of the glass. There's always lots of foam with these tripel/IPA hybrids and its attractive. the foam is almost like merange [sp!], very thick."
"I fine beer to drink. I would have preferedd more of a hop character, but this is my first Belgium IPA so I'm expecting my palate to change as I seek out more of this style. For where I am now this is a worthwhile brew, though I prefer American IPAs and Belgium, well, belgiums."
"D- What a great beer, this was a serious treat and I'm going to have to pick up more of it. It's very well balanced, but keeps all of the unique elements very present. Definitely one to seek out if you haven't tried."
"One rock sings the fermentation characteristics of a tripel. Spicy, yeasty, fruity and full of life. From the other rock sings the floral high notes and bitter bass of a DIPA. But somehow Chouffe steers clear of the pitfalls of both. The nose is spicy and fruity with a bit of earthy hops in there. It's hard to detect what's hops and what's esters. The flavor brings some bitterness up front followed by pils malt sweetness, slight pineapple and a finsih that allows malt yeast and hops to have syncopated solos. Tastes of honey are left on my lips as I look forward to another bottle. Brown bottle, Amen."
"Mouthfeel was light with lots of carbonation, not watery at all. Very light and refreshing, i could drink this beer all night. Outstanding."
"D - you can have two in a night and be done. not a session brew, but you're not expecting that with a brew of this stature, either."
"D:AWESOME!!!! I love this damn beers. Hands down my favorite Belgium. The only thing I wish is the head was not as big. I just can't wait that long."
"I picked up a bottle of this at Nikki's in NP, RI based on the Beer Advocate ratings and I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoyed this one. It's simple perfection like an Orval but with a lot more kick. The flavor is very crisp, clean and balanced. It's a strong one not to be rushed so you can enjoy the experience. I plan to make this one a regular."
"Nice thick mouthfeel, not particularly drinkable."
"Poured this into a tulip glass. Looks fantastic. Transparent golden yellow with a MASSIVE fluffy white head. Impressive lacing that sticks all over the place. Smell is very hoppy and sweet. Layers of yeast lie underneath the hops. Very fragrant. Taste is both bitter and fruity at the same time. Lots of citrus, but also white grapes and apples. Tasty! Nice and full body with plenty of carbonation. Finishes kind of dry. Well-balanced. Very warming on a cold winter's night. Pairs well with blue cheese, a close friend, and Super Mario Galaxy."
"Drinkability is just ok here. Obviously not a session beer because of the abv, but the thin mouthfeel and bitterness at the end affect drinkability."
"My first-ever beer from the brewery Brasserie d'Achouffe, and I was completely blown away by the overall quality and outstanding character of this terrific sample... From a 1pint, 16 fl oz large green bottle, pours an exceptional appearance with a cloudy, frothy, hazy sediment-filled strawish color with immense bubbly head with impressive staying power... smell is very intense, with a distinct bubble-gum aroma pouring out of the bottle with fruit and slight hops smell... taste was superb, full of fresh fruit, sweet grapefruit, and only slight hops... hardly any bitterness detected at all which surprised me considering the logo on the bottle claimed it was an ""IPA Tripel""... not what I was expecting at all with such a sweet marriage of perfect flavors and a delicate balance of Amarillo, Tomahawk, and Saaz hops... As far as the 9% ABV is concerned, the alcohol is hard to detect with such strong and rich flavors...Outstanding, world-class brew, Definitely recommended..."
"Will buy this one again if I ever find it. interested in cellaring but unsure about the bottlecap"
"D- Very drinkable, goes down smooth and easy and is absolutely delicious."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. nice mix of belgian tripel and more american hop character, yet different enough to stand on its own."
"Pours clouded gold. Nice level of off-white head. Nose is very yeasty. Flavor is full of funk and hops. Earthy aftertaste like a deep clay. Yeast is definitely there as well. Robust is the key word here. Feel has a nice level of carbonation and a good liquid feel. Overall very good. Extremely hearty and robust, yet consistent."
"this poured a murky gold with a thick, big, rocky white, super long-lasting head and lacing. visible large floaties and sediment towards the bottom. bouqet was powerful and very complex. honey, hard candy, resiny and citric, fresh bread dough, apricots along with some grassy notes and musty barnyard aromas. taste was sweet malts with a smooth, prominent hop bitterness with some sourness present. mouthfeel was barely medium-bodied and, being belgian, lighter than expected for a beer of this abv. would be more drinkable if i could put down more than one of these big-ass bottles without ending up on the floor."
"Great Belgian tripel one of my favorites so far"
"First pour into my tulip yields, dare I say it, perfect appearance. This is one nice looking beer. Fluffy, frothhy head with some serious staying power. Sticky resiny lacing left behind. Color is a cloudy straw blonde. Faint hops presence in the aroma, but nothing overbearing. Some yeastiness and barnyard promise a Belgian treat. I have had this before, and it seems as though the hop presence was stronger than this. May be that this bottle is not as fresh. No matter, still a wonderful beer. Faint hop bittering against a sweet Tripel. Nice. Very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and luxurious. Only real downfall I have is with drinkability. This is jus one of those beer that falls into the ""sipper"" catagory. It is heavy, filling, and full of warming alcohol. A bomber was almost too much for me...Almost. And the best news, this wonderful beer is much more available than my other favorites. Seek this out."
"Drinkability is good. This scores points here for originality and complexity. A very interesting beer to sip. I like it, and I am glad I have another I can drink at a later date."
"Bitter flavor up front. Hops form the main element of the flavor, with smooth malt. A hint of sweetness, though it doesn't do much to stand up to the complex hop profile."
"D: I really think I have found a new favorite beer style as I am in love with Belgian IPAs at the moment, I'd have a very very hard time choosing between either this or a Piraat. This is a clean easy drinking refreshing beer that is very complex and beautiful to look at. If I were in on a hop kick I'd take this, if I were looking for something sweeter I'd take the Piraat. If I had a wad of bills I'd take a case of each."
"This beer is a must for anyone interested in Mendelian genetics! Pours a beautiful yellow with an amazingly fluffy three finger head. I love it when you take a sip and get foam on your nose. The nose of this beer is incredibly strong and reeks of both hops and bread with some pleasant spice aromas. At first sip I thought trippel but then the IPA came through and the ardennes hop flavors delight, but only for a moment as the carbonation and creaminess of a classic belgian trippel finish the taste. Incredibly smooth, and the small amount of bitterness that there is is only in the middle which is an incredible feat. This is the perfect meld of a belgian IPA and a classic belgian Trippel. Great accomplishment, and a must for any belgian fan."
"Drinkability This is very drinkable, though a bit dry. It is nice melding of two of my favorite styles. This is a pretty unique beer. There is almost no hint of the high alcohol content of an imperial IPA or a trippel."
"Mellow mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation in the pour that doesn't come out to much in the mouth. The crispness of the carbonation is somewhat absorbed by the yeasty/grain/wheat feel. Very tasty and unique."
"I'm not one to give straight marks. But this one is superior in every way."
"D - I remember the big IPA hops being more dominant on tap but a good beer none the less."
"I didn't really care for my first European take on a US-like hop bomb (the Brooklyn/Schneider Hopfen Weiss), but this is much more up my alley."
"I really like the fact that one can taste both the IPA and Belgian components here. They blend very well together but are distinct at the same time. From the smell alone I would think IPA but the Belgian yeast figures prominently in the taste, curbing what might otherwise be a dryly bitter beer. The taste is still primarily hops, though, with complexity added by malts and citrus."
"On tap at Luka's in Oakland. Dark golden pour, a little cloudy/yeasty looking actually. Definitely unfiltered. Nice subdued hop aroma, more yeasty/estery/belgian aroma than a hop aroma. Awesome hop/yeast flavors. Some fruitiness from the yeast, some from the hops. Apparently the hop flavor is from Amarillo, which citrus flavors seems to work very well with the esters in the yeast. Very dry. Extremely drinkable. A very unique marriage of the double IPA and Belgian brewing indeed. An excellent beer."
"D: This is a great beer from the Chouffe Brewey. A fantastic mix of styles, each part lends a simple elegance to a tasty beer. Pricey, but worth it, great on tap as well, first time I have had it in this context."
"Overall, this is a really solid and flavorful beer, but nothing spectacular. It's definitely worth a try, but this may be the last bottle I buy for myself."
"Tastes wonderful. The label does not lie, Triple IPA for sure. Lots of bitter hops, orange, pepper, yeasty spiciness ( once again more powerful when the sediment makes its way in), pale malt and a well hidden but warming alcohol. This is one hell of a beer, it is so complex and I was amazed how much it changes past mid bottle."
"This beer poured a hazy yellow color with a huge head  great lacing. The aroma is sweet and a bit fruity. The taste is spicy and bitter. A grain/cereal taste is also noted. The mouthfeel is full and it has a dry aftertaste. Overall, this is an interesting beer that has a lot of character."
"An interesting beer, but having tried it a couple of times now, I think I can safely say that it's not my thing."
"Bravo!"
"This is made for big important meals, and carries the complexity and dexterity to match pretty much anything it is paired with. From frozen pizza to roasted herb-crusted grouse to rhubarb pie, this, I believe, would shine. Oh, and it shines pretty fucking bright on its own too, in the absence of food and the desire for more once the 750mL is gone."
"this world class brew!!"
"I'm a big hop fan and I really appreciate the hybrid approach that this beer appears to take. I've only within the last couple of years began to truely appreciate all the wonderful beers of Belgium and being that this is a mix of two of my current favorite styles, I'm just that much more grateful that a beer like this was made. A heartfelt ""thank you"" goes out to anybody and everybody involved in making this wonderful beer."
"Light golden color, slightly chill hazed at first that becomes crystal clear. A late arriving white head overflowed my glass and stuck around in big clumps. Looks like globs of shaving cream as it falls. Leaves sticky globs on the side of the glass. Nice crisp floral hops smell with a nice spicyness in the background, very interesting combination. Hops up front in the taste which is quicly followed by a spicyness that drys the finish out. This is one of the more enjoyable beers that I've had in a long time. A great combination of hop bitterness and yeasty spiceyness that balances out nicely. Pepper spice flavor becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Best of 2 worlds, American IPA and Belgian Ale."
"Presented in a kinda cutsie bottle, with a cartoon of the little Chouffe, but it is a great brew. Pours a yellowish hazy copper with a massive four-finger head. Long lasting and leaves lacing all over the glass. Aroma is hoppy and spicey. Tastes fruity and citrusy from the American hop bill, but the toasted malty flavors and Belgian yeast flavors add a pleasant balance. Bitter taste in the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and a little creamy, but carbonated well. Overall, this is an excellent beer. I hope there are more of these cross-continental hybrids of IPAs and Belgians. I've tried Greenflash Brewing Co.'s Le Freak Belgian IPA; now I can fix my craving for a Trippel/Golden and an American IPA at the same time... Where's my rig?!"
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a big white head. Aromas of a sweet yeastiness and a nice presence of hops. As in the taste, A dry yeasy and hoppy, with a small Belgian sweetness. A very clean mouthfeel, with a bitter yeast aftertaste. All I can say is what is better than a Belgian triple that is actually an Imperial /Double IPA."
"Interesting...unlike an American IPA and unlike most other Belgium IPA's I've experienced."
"Thick head for an IPA with a distinct brownj color"
"This is just simply a kick ass beer. Bursting with fruit and hop character without being to ""belgian"" and leaving odd ends on the palate. A moderate amount of sweetness on the mid palate and finish. 9% ABV is hardly noticeable as this taste to good to care. Thick with passion and tropical fruits that lead into clove and citrusy hop, with a resiny feel to them. A near perfect amount of carbonation. Just a solid, great tasting, overly drinkable beer."
"Very drinkable considering the strong abv. The coolest part about this beer was the head. It was really clumpy and thick and it left large pieces on the sides as it fell."
"Overall, this was a very nice suprise. I heard good things about the Belgian take on the IPA and was not disappointed. Very tasty and very well balanced. The nice sweet malts of the tripel style mesh with the hops of the IPA style beautifully. Highly recommended."
"At first this gem I got from the NEPA case split club seemed mislabeled as I wanted to know where the hops were hiding. But they are in the aroma and have a pleasant grapefruity streak in the flavor. But the almost trademark Chouffe yeast and malty flavors rule the day even though I have to say both hops and malts are well blended and balanced. There is a slight sour aftertaste going on but it doesnt diminish the overall experience heavily."
"D: The flavour is big & bold, but body is relatively light & digestable."
"Old world meets the new world with a wonderful balance of bitter and sweet drinkability. Golden ale with a heavy white foam that eventually settles down to a long lasting fine soapy head. Smell of grapefruit and spice with light floral tones. Taste begins sharp but immediately sets sweet and lingers to the top hop and then balances to semi-dry and finishes with a hint of black pepper. No kidding. A lasting and complex flavor event. Kudos to the Makers for combining the best attributes of Belgium and North America to create such a delicious brew. One of my personal favorites for sure. Best enjoyed with good friends. Outstanding!"
"D - I really enjoyed this. For an Advocate who started out in the microbrew scene with IPAs only to eventually come to explore the Belgian crowd, this is definitely a welcome hybrid. Price is an issue, however, as this style doesn't seem readily available - I paid 7.99 for my bottle; not too pricey, but just enough to keep it from being a regular dinner-drink. Weekends?"
"Looks great in the Karmelit glass nice dense white head and a true golden body. The aroma attacks me before the glass even gets in my hand. Candied hops and spicy yeast bits. The taste is a hopped up, but with gentle citrus and noble type, triple and the alcohol blooms on the back end that leaves a tang of wonderful hops and yeast. Nice drinkable body and this is something I will drink again."
"A very drinkable beer -- just wish I had someone to share this with at the moment. Being an AIPA fan -- a very cool spin on the DIPA through a Belgian brew. I look forward to bringing a bottle or two to some friend's house over dinner. Glad I finally stumbled across this beer."
"Drinkability: This is what disappointed me. I love IPA and all though I have little experience with Belgian IPA, I felt that the brewer was just trying to burn my palate with bitterness (that came off harsh) and didn't tap into the American sense of flavor, aroma, and bittering that make IPA so wonderful. I drank the bottle but with the high alcohol and the lingering mouth feel I wouldn't have had any more."
"WOWZERS! Get on this brew NOW!! An amazingly complex and refreshing beer both physically and stylistically."
" Its good to see the Belgians embracing the high AA hops."
"Lazy gold with generous white head/lacing. Tons of suspended yeast adds texture. Not much carbonation. Yeast dominates the smell with honey, mild citric hops, and alcohol all playing their parts. Citrus hops make way for a sticky malt base and plenty of yeast characteristics adding spiciness/tropical fruits along the way. Large amounts of toasted grain make an appearance towards the end. Bitter hop finish cleans the palette while a bit of honey sweetness sticks around on the tongue. Solid mouthfeel. It borders on slick at times, but is pulled back by the bittering hops. Fairly medium bodied, but does lean towards heavy. This isn't your everyday go to beer, but it's good for the right occasion."
"I could drink this one with on the first day of a three-day hangover. Smooth as silk, every sip gives you something more. Beautiful product."
"D: A very tasty, unique, and fascinating brew. The mix of flavors of a Belgian tripel and an IPA works very well together. It's well balanced, complex and very delicious. I've never had anything like it and I likely never will, except of course when I come back to this great beer."
"What a funky, cross style, throw the rules out the window beer this is. Combination almost-double IPA and Belgian Tripel. Interesting interplay of Belgian yeast and loads of hops. The Belgian spirit of beer adventure is evident here, and the sum effect was good, but not outstanding."
"D - Overall this is a good beer. I loved the mix of Belgian with IPA. It was a good experience and I would get it again, but only if I could split it with someone. 25.4 ounces it a lot to drink in one sitting."
"slightly hazy golden color with a massive creamy white head that sticks around like nobody's buisness. i'm not sure i've ever seen a head like this one. nose is like citrus flavored cotton candy. comes through very citrusy and just straight yummy. a little bitter with a very bubbly mouthfeel. yes, please, i'd like another."
"Great beer."
"Love of hops and Belgian ales combined led me to purchase this brew. However, I was suspicious that the long trip across the world to my beer glass might result in hop degradation. With plenty of sweet yeasty Belgian flavor, this beer is nothing like the US idea of a hoppy beer. The hops managed to maintain a touch of aroma; noticeable citrus hop flavor, and a nicely balanced bitterness. This beer is easy to enjoy and a nice change from the ordinary."
"yeah, an interesting experiment. doesnt quite have the hop presence in aroma or taste i thought it would, but thats probably a good thing as the belgian side seems to be the focus."
"I picked this one to see what a Belgian IPA was. This was a cloudy yellow beer with lots of floaty yeasties in it. The smell was nondescript. The taste was a little citrus hops but still mostly belgian yeast in flavor. Interesting concept but calling it a ""Dobbelen IPA"" was very misleading. There is nothing DIPA about this beer. The only thing this beer had in common with a DIPA was they type of hops. I think I'll pass on ""hoppy"" beers from Belgium; they need to leave the hop bombs to Americans who know what they are doing."
"Pours out a striking brass tone with lively carbonation, a wavy, fluffy head, and impressive lacing. Nose has a lot of grain, alcohol, spicy yeast, and some citrus and herbal hops tones. I also get some candy-ish sweet tones and light stone fruits. Flavor begins sweet with a hefty amount of pale malt and some graininess. Some citrus and floral flavors come to the fore along with a backing of yeast spices. Finishes still dry and with quite a bit of bitterness. Grain just stays on into the aftertaste. Sweetness and booze just seems to come out more as this warms. Mouthfeel is a little sticky and slick for me, but the carbonation is pleasant and the weight of the beer on the tongue is acceptable. This is a decent beer, but I don't think everything meshes well. I'd much rather a De Ranke XX."
"Wonderful, and highly recommended. I enjoyed it best at about 45°F. Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly hops, slight citrus, and coriander. The taste follows the nose, this is a clean fresh kind of IPA, tasty. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice twist on an IPA, belgian style, recommended."
"Seems pretty light for a 9% brew, I could easily drink a few."
"glass. It subsided very slowly, coating the glass with latticed lace and looking much like a soda. It was a very hazy yellow color. The aroma was of hops, yeast and lemon. The flavor was of hops, bread, citrus and pepper. The finish was fairly light and had some elements of the hop bitterniss and the pepper. Another good beer from Chouffe. Now if I could just learn to pour them properly."
"Pretty smooth and easy to quaff."
"Big thanks go out to MrBURTON55 for the bottle."
"D: An interesting interpration of the style. This is definitely a Belgian creation and I enjoyed this brew quite a bit, but I was hoping for a bigger and more pronounced hop profile considering the use of Tomahawk. Amarillo and Saaz hops. Recommended."
"9%ABV be damned. Not only could I drink this until I died, but I'd have a happy stay in Hell as long as this was on tap."
"An extraordinary thing, this. At least to look at. Gold covered in snow. Thick, thick snow. Head is fabulous, with great staying power and topography. Visible carbonation, gorgeous. Smell is coriander and hops. Didn't dig on the taste so much. I love Double IPA's and Triples, but two great tastes don't necessarily always taste great together. This is interesting, but to me a mess of sweet malt and predictable spices along with a hellacious blast of hops... It's interesting, and applaud them for what they've done, but there is no way in hell I would shell out ten bucks for another bottle of this, except mayber to lay one down for 6 months to a year to see if the flavors meld a little better. Mouthfeel starts smooth but ends stingy and obtrusive. Hot, actually. A for arrogance, unfortunately an C for cohesiveness. It may be a Triple Dubbel, but this is no Magic Johnson. I apologize for that pun, I really do."
"Recommended!"
"Far and away the best Belgian IPA I've had, as it is not too heavy on the pepper and really hides the alcohol nicely. I don't care how hard it is to get your hands on, do it!"
"Drinkability - Wonderful balance of hopped and belgian tripel. If your a fan of either get this."
"I would drink this anytime it was presented to me, very nice from start to finish."
"The almost solid chunk of head leftover after the liquid is gone was a tasty treat!"
"This is an interesting brew and hands-down beautiful, but a little dry in the finish for my liking."
"D-Interesting for sure...nice blend of styles....but for me this does not rate as an all-time great....definitely enjoyable, but nothing I would go back to."
"D-This is very good D is right up there. Higher ABV will prevent excessive consumption though."
"An altogether excellent beer."
"Overall this was one of my best beer experiences. A delicious beer that embodies the best of an IPA, barlywine and trippel all in one!"
"a remarkable accomplishment"
"My my, this one sure is neat. Pours a light gold into my chalice, the fluffy white head exploding from the glass and keeps until settling down to no thinner than half inch. Crazy lacing in bubbles, streaks, foam, this is crazy. The only problem is all that sediment, which is my fault. The aroma tips me off to whats to come, a delightful mix of citrus, coriander, yeast, and it really wafts of saison more than anything, and gets me thinking... why haven't I tasted anything like this mix of IPA and Saison... ever.... its wondrous! And then to taste, just brilliant. Take every good quality of IPA and Saison (which, coincidentally, is everything) and roll them into one nifty little bottle and you have this. And add to that rich mouth, smooth and creamy and carbonated just right, with a good body and the slightest feel of alcohol warming, and you have yourself something very special. An absolute delight, a treat, and a great introduction to Chouffe."
"I was wondering when I bought this beer what style it would fall under, I had no idea that Belgian IPA was a style. It pours a hazy slightly brownish yellow with a beautiful thick head that lingers. Aroma is at first just that of a belgian triple, but then a huge fresh hop smell comes out, fitting in perfectly with the yeasty aroma. Taste is sweet pale malts with a major bitterness. The spicey, chalky yeast flavor comes through in the finish, just as the citrusy hop flavor really takes hold. There is very little alcohol flavor. I am really impressed! This hybrid style really shows off the best of both worlds, and despite the flavor extremes, it maintains quite a balance."
"This beer hides it's 9% alcohol very well. I'll have to get another, fresher bottle to see if the aroma improves."
"This is a fascinating experiment and a solid, if flawed brew. I will be more than happy if I can make a Belgian IPA that enters the same ballpark as this brew."
"750ml green bottle from Burby and Bates. Murky yellow body with chunks of yeast floating around and a couple inches of white to offwhite head that leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smells citrusy and piney, with a hint of skunk. Tastes sweet, citrusy, piney. Unfortunately, I'm tasting just a hint of skunk is also there, making this pretty good tasting. I bet this beer is phenominal fresh or on tap. Damn these green bottles. Still quite pleasant and drinkable."
"D - Overall this was really nice. I could see myself having a glass in front of the tv anynight. Very hoppy and really bitter and well done. Very dry finish only served to cap off a great experience. Loved this one."
"D: Decent. This is pretty good, but, it didn't blow me away like so many other people. Will have to buy a fresh bottled example to compare."
"Not remotely a bad beer. Perhaps just one that I don't appreciate."
"Beer was a hazy pale yellow and very foamy. Aroma was of champagne and slightly sour, but not detectably hoppy. Flavor was puckery up-front like a tripel, and the finish was bitter, but not in a conventional IPA kind of way. A very distinct flavor all the way through. A very soft and billow-y mouthfeel. Delicious."
"Dry, underlying sweetness to the beer with a spicy hoppy bite. Grainy with a slight malty background. Citrus zestiness comes across from the beginning. Medium mouthfeel finishes very smooth and more drinkable than it began."
"A little less lingering bitterness might be appreciated, but this is quite a unique beverage! I guess the hops and ABV make me think of American double IPA, but that part of the flavor seems more reminiscent of English IPA, albeit a bit more complex. Regardless, it is the first successful mating I've seen between Tripel and IPA. I'll definitely have another."
"D- This was a fairly refreshing beverage. It was also very interesting. Doesn't quite live up to the hype for me, but was worthwhile nonetheless."
"Cloudy but vibrant gold with a small, white, creamy, quickly diminishing head, yet still has some good lacing. Fruity and fresh smell. Berry, herbs and alcohol esters. Hops really come out as soon as the first drop hits your lips. Wow, this is my first Belgian IPA and I have to say Im impressed. Not what I was expecting at first, but once I settled into it, I really enjoyed it."
"This was not the US hopbomb I expected, but it is a very good beer."
"Gnomes make great beer."
"Overall and great and unique beer. the color was lighter than i thought, but not a bad thing. the head is incredibly large and sustains through the whole beer. makes me wonder what a belgian double ipa would taste like (and how much alc they would make it)"
"Color is cloudy amber with a very thick head that persists like whipped cream more than beer foam. The smell is weak and so-so, but the taste is superb - smooth with a bite, as well as plenty of hoppiness and fruity undertones. A very tasty brew that is worth looking for; I found it at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur (just east of Atlanta) Georgia."
"$6 a glass."
"Highly recommended."
"If you get the chance ...do it"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling, hell of a kick to it, but I found this beer fell short of the hype surrounding it."
"Ordered online. Poured into my Schiltz Chalice, this Belgian ale poured with a monstrous foam of good density, forming cool shapes as it fell. Dried herbs, with hints of fruits (white peach and pear), some aroma hops. Herbal and dry initially, until the mid-palate leads way into a deep, sweet, estery fruitiness, with hints of mint. Finish has some hops, lingering herb and spruce. Just okay. Not very magical. Could be hoppier."
"Hmm...I think my bottle was a bit light struck. It initially smelled skunky, but letting it air out helped tremendously. At any rate, pours a very cloudy, golden, straw yellow. A few bits of sediment suspended perfectly throughout. Huge, reactive head that resembled really airy whip cream. Some parts of the head stuck to my snifter and never dissipated. Now, Americans should not get their hopes up, because this isn't anything like an American IPA. However, you can pick up the grapefruity scent and flavor of the hops. It smells like a tropical smoothie with light booze. It tastes exactly how I thought it would...yeasty, citrusy, with a sweet malt background. Medium to medium full body that is perfectly smooth. Great beer."
"I find it very drinkable."
"Ovr: I really enjoyed this beer. I thought it was a perfect blend of a hoppy American IPA, and a Belgian. I've always loved Fantome Brise Bon Bons, which is similar, but I enjoyed this beer even more."
"Overall a very interesting beer with some very interesting flavors. Sorry to repeat myself but the flavors do come together nicely. One of the best looking beers I have seen. Well done."
"On tap at Biergarden, Portsmouth VA. As Id expected, a very ""Belgian"" visual ... hazy yellow with a big airy, foam topping. This drank extremely smoothly with a definite alcohol-spice kick, a bit of a dirty orange peel aspect, wonderfully complex, yeasty, bready, grassy, barky, with a quite bitter finish. Excited to read the description of this as a cross with American Imperial IPAs, because it all makes sense now! (#2694, 2/10/2007)"
"Drinkability: The novelty of the beer is enough to warrant a look. The flavors though never mix together well enough to really enjoy."
"Drinkability is decent."
"what a great blend of IPA and traditional Belgian characters. Medium copper color, with a thick, THICK foam head, pale cream color. Highly aromatic, and pleasant. Great taste and smooth feel, both before and after swallow.... leaves you wanting more."
"D- I have tasted several attempts at trying to make a Triple and an IPA work together and they never have. This is amazing with the perfume hop smells and tastes with a slight sweetness to enhance the hops while showing them with a yeast note. The hops have nice big flavors but are not a kick in your teeth like other beers. Don't get me wrong I like a good kick-in-the-teeth hop monster aswell."
"D- Excellent. This is a great brew. The alcohol is not too much, though it is present. Not for mass consumption. The sweetness is present throughout, making the bitter finish not so abrasive. I will be drinking this more often."
"the label don't lie. it tastes like a high-qualty tripel melded with a high quality, subtle, IPA. amazingly balanced, and quite inspired. something about this beer, conceptually, would lead one to believe it would be very showy and bold. this is not the case at all, making it easy to appreciate its flavors without being overwhelmed, or forced to concentrate all that hard on it. a beautiful beer!"
"If you ever see this on tap, try it! I did also have a bottle a while ago, but I really enjoyed it the most on tap. It transformed it from a very good, solid beer to an absolutely exceptional beer."
"This beer will always have a place in my heart and my cellar."
"outstanding. top 3 beer for me."
"D: HE-double hockey sticks YEAH!!! I may have to make another trip back to Chicago to find this beer."
"Note: I am not usually an IPA hophead, but this Belgian take on an American classic is an interesting turn. High on the spicy hop bitterness without the excessive grassy or vegetative ""fresh"" hop flavor from dry hopping and late additions. Gives a strong citrus and gingery bitterness that finishes clean and helps cleanse the palate from strong and spicy food. Strong like an IIPA but light and bubbly like a Tripel."
"Fantastic, soft, supple bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. Deadly drinkable for how big it is. Less hoppy than on release, and not better for it. Drink up IMO."
"This is a real afternoon sipper, and a crowd pleaser  big beer drinkers and cross-overs too."
"Beautiful silk-screened 750 mL, capped champagne bottle - brewed with Amarillo, Tomahawk, and Saaz. It pours a medium to dark gold with quite active carbonation that subsides fairly quickly, and is topped with a 2 inch, rocky head that is fluffy on the bottom and dense as meringue on top. The lace is extremely sticky and subsequent pours release yeast and floaties that turn the body a hazed peach. The smell is essentially all hops: spicy/perfumy, floral, citric (lemony), and grassy (freshly-cut hay), with notes of dried apricot, pear?, pine, and a lightly musty character. The flavor has additional notes of apples and raw, leafy/green hops which contribute a medium bitterness. It would be higher, but there is a hefty malt background taming the hops and reminding us of the tripel influence. However, at times the malts become a touch too sweet. The body is nice and smooth, medium to full and very balanced, with a carbonation that starts high but mellows near the end. Overall quite an interesting blend of the two styles, slowly progressing from a hoppy DIPA to a sweet, malty tripel. Would definitely try again, but I wish the malt bill were slightly smaller."
"Drinkability: So I shared this 750ml amongst a few friends, to their great enjoyment (they may not be so lucky next time). It hides the high level of alcohol so well (it is unnoticable) that this could easily creep up on you, and I feel until that level hits, I would indulge in this. Will certainly return to this one, a job well done."
"D: An all-around tasty offering that excels. 9% abv makes it one to savor. Still, this style is done exceedingly well, and I would order another, and stock up on several."
"This beer is just stupidly drinkable. Never mind the big-assed bottle. I had no problems draining this one. Such a great combination of flavors and aromas. I must get several more of these when I venture west to Ohio next time. This is one damn fine beer."
"Poured a golden, but somewhat murky champagne coloration, with lots of little bubbles shooting up to the top. Heading was thick and white, sticking to the sides of the glass, and holding up very well. Aroma definitely had some odd yeasty smells reminiscent of some of the crappy euro pale lagers. The hop bitterness could also be detected, which was probably what was balancing the strong yeast smells. Taste was pretty damn bitter up front, then became pretty fruity towards the end. Mouthfeel was medium I would say, with lots of carbonation, but not too much. I won't have a problem finishing off the bottle, but I think once is enough for this one. I guess my problem is that I love ipas, but Im not too crazy about tripels. Oh well, its worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability is excellent. The flavors and mouth presence are so wonderful that this beer just disappears from the glass."
"A beer that I could just keep sucking down. Delicious."
"Poured from 750ml bottle to a red wine glass. Great white billowing head! One one of the nicest snow white heads I have seen. Very nice golden pale hue. Smell is of saaz hops. The nose was a lot like a fresh czech pilsner. Taste- the hops have really blended in well with the malts. I don't know the age of this beer, it may in fact have some age on it.Very balanced and absolutely delicious. There is not hint that this is a 9% beer. I have quite a few pints of this, but alas it is my only bottle. I will miss you little gnome! If only I could find you close to home. Very creative offering and an outstanding beer."
"The mouth is pleasantly puckering with low carbonation. The elves outdid them selves with this one!! Viva La Chouffe!!!"
"Beer was poured slowly but resulted in a gigantic fluffy head that is leaving lacing all over my Duvel glass. It is pale in color and highly charged from the carbonation. My nose was greeted with a nice aroma of Belgian hops and yeast, light citrus, and spices. Taste is a wonderful blend of a Belgian Tripel and a strong Pale Ale styles. An orange peel hop fuels the finish. Mouthfeel is classic Belgian smoothness crossed with a fine dry champagne feel. Drinkability is very enjoyable. Alcohol is slight in the background with each sip. This is an interesting style which i would recommend to Belgian PA and Tripel fans."
"Very unique brew that I'm glad to finally try. Great to see some Belgian brewers being this innovative and mixing styles."
"Overall, this is an incredibly unique beer and definitely pulls off the combining of the two different styles."
"Pours hazy bright golden yellow with a billowing snow white head. Lots of Belgian lace. Wonderfully spiced aroma with plenty citrus hop aroma. Sweet candy sugar as well. The tripel character comes through perfect, and the Amarican hop bitterness is very evident. The palate is great. Full, but refreshingly carbonated. Get ya some."
"As advertised, this is a tripel ipa. Not an iiipa, of course, but a geniune belgium tripel style, with an ipa delivery of hops. This is a hophead's dream come true (assuming that they're fans of belgium beers - but who isn't?). Pours and smells like a quality tripel. I smell bready yeasts, spice, apple, and a hint of banana. Good, sticky head retention. But once on the tongue, its obvious that something's different. The hop profile leaps out almost immediately. Citrus burn and peppery zest. Starting like a tripel, and ending like a solid ipa, this offering finally leaves that lovely, lingering earthy, fruity after taste, once the hops-burn fades, and then you burp up a little grapefruit. This is fantastic! Drinkable for sure, but at 9.00% is rather heavy duty. Get your hands on one of these! Enjoy with fuji apples and sharp white cheddar."
"D: very drinkable beer, just blew through the 750 mL, and could easily do another, maybe two."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. Very nice combo of hops added to a great tripple base. This is a very interesting and dam tasty beer. The alcohol is well hidden in the beer."
"Not quite what i would expect from and IPA or from a Tripel, but this is one damn good beer no matter what style you condemn it to. I will definitely be picking more of this one up, since it's now available in Omaha thanks to Beertopia."
"Pours a hazy golden/yellow, huge white head forms, tons of lacing, great retention, head sticks for the long haul, very rocky. Smell is amazing, sweet, some citrus, grapefruit, toffee, yeast, floral, some alcohol, very hoppy. Taste is toffee and yeast, with a big floral grapefruit hop hit, tons of citrus, some wheat, long hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation, medium, some warmth, nice clean hoppy finish. Excellent experiment, wish more breweries would create hybrids like this."
"Whatever you want to call this guy I'd say this is good stuff."
"Drinkability - This one went down surprisingly quickly. Not as noticeable as some other 9% beers. Before I knew it, I was finishing up my third and final pour of the bottle craving another glassful."
"Overall drinkability is fine, this is a very unique, solidly constructed and quality beer, but just doesnt have the right balance or transition for me."
"Drinkability: This is complex and pleasant on every level. It's much easier to drink than it's ABV has any right to be."
"938"
"Drinkability: Very quaffable, but the alcohol sneaks up on you. This beer truly is one of a kind."
"Mouthfeel is extremely carbonated (perhaps too much so) and rather prickly. Drinkability is good, but slow. The taste and drinkability don't live up to the head and nose of this beer."
"Drinkability: This one is a real gem. I have to brew something like this soon. Dobbelen IPA Tripel? A British ale style, with Belgian yeast, and American and Czech hops? Who'd have thought?"
"Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Creamy smooth texture. It was interesting but I don't feel it lived up to the hype."
"Warming notes of alcohol waft up through my nasal ducts as I sip this brew. It is not sharply alcoholic and in fact hides its alcohol quite well, but there is that warming in the nose that lets you know that this beer will bite you if you don't watch out. The balance that this beer strikes is really the wonderful thing about this beer. Soft, creamy and enticing, yet at the same time bitingly bitter with ample hop notes. And the ample meringue like head is as good as it gets. This is definitely one of those beers that is quite well integrated, the sum of its parts, tasty as they may be, still add up to a greater whole than one my expect."
"Because of the 9% abv one should drink this slow and enjoy one at a time."
"Well worth getting again and again, if you can."
"I think its hard for this beer to match its aroma in taste...not that it was a letdown in any way because this is an excellent beer. Eh, what the hell, I'll match the taste and aroma score-wise. Very interesting and well done!"
"I had this on tap at Pitchers Pub in Cumberland RI and ever since, this is the first drink that i ask for when i see it on tap. The apperance is a cloudy gold with a thick white head that dissipates to a flat plain. The taste and smell are both exceptional with the hop and citrus prresents well known. With 9%alc, this beer should be enjoyed slowly for it will cetainly put a smile on your face."
"Beer pours out a hazy golden color with a thick, fluffy white head. Nose is all about hops, citrus, grapefruit, and some earthy aromas rounding out the edge. The taste hits you over the head with hops, but the malt balances it out quickly before it becomes overbearing. Finishes citrusy, orange, grapefruit, and a bit bready. Moderate carbonation, and a slick long finish."
"This beer is quite fruity and spicy, like a saison. It has a nice, not overpowering, hoppy kick to it as well, very nice for a belgian brew. Slight yeastiness leasds to a smooth, medium mouthfeel. This beer goes down so smoot. For about $10 for a 750 ml bottle, this is a beer I will always want more of."
"Slightly hazed golden. Bigass white crown of froth. It becomes quite rocky as it recedes and leaves great webs of lace. Great nose. Not exactly an IPA nose, but still, a great nose. I can pick out more of the Saaz on the nose than the 'Rillos. Doesn't matter. I love the smell of both. But there's also a nice belgian biscuity malt aroma that blends in nicely. A very warm and comforting aroma. Onto the flavor. Nice. Interesting. And unique. Unlike any beer that I can remember off the top of my head. It's got the great hop attributes, albeit slightly different than the hop bombs of America. But also this great underlying Belgian matliness and yeastiness. Bready, biscuity, warming... I've heard of comfort food, well this is comfort beer. A beer that would be outstanding on a cool, cloudy, late autumn day...with a fire going...and a good football game on...and good food cooking in the kitchen. This would be the perfect beer for Thanksgiving. I may have to get some more."
"D: Damn, this is such a fine beer. Wow - I'd drink this again and again (and again)...a favorite for both of us. Highly recommended. Among the best beers I've ever had, regardless of style."
"Next challenge....homebrew clone of this!"
"This Belgian double IPA poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that slowly settled and coated the inside of the glass. The smell was Belgian malt with a bit of fruitiness and some grape skins together with a nice hoppiness. The taste was a basic Belgian maltiness with a touch of sugar sweetness together with a vinous grape-skin flavor and layered with a rather strong hoppiness, but not an overpoweringly bitter hoppiness. Overall a very nice flavor combination. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly sweet with medium body and low carbonation feel. The finish left the flavors of grape-skins and hops lingering pleasantly. This was a very nice beer, reminiscent of DeRanke XX Bitter."
"Cheers!"
"What a beer, this has so many flavors and smells that my crappy writing can't do it justice, but I will try. The body is slightly cloudy yellow/orange with massive creamy white head. The head itself had a very citrusy and piney hop taste. The first thing that comes to mind on the smell is a lemon pound cake. I also smell some spicy cloves or black pepper and there is a little grapefruit hidden in there too. The taste is more of the same it starts with citrus, then bready malts with a nice bitter ending. The bitter ending is great with the sweet citrus beginning and malty middle. This is a very impressive beer."
"Warning: Stop pouring this beer early, as I got 2 inches of beer and 6 inches of head which is a huge foamy off white. Body is a yellow hazy straw colored hue. Lace is left thick on the glass, as the foam fades at about an inch every 4 minutes or so. Wow! Nose is a nice wheat and soft hop mix. I was amazed at how smooth and balanced this was, with a silkey belgium feel mingled with a nice mix of hops. Hop heads and belgium fans unite. Notes of vanilla and mellon exist. Finish is clean. Mouthfeel is welcomed. Very surprisingly drinkable."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured to a bright golden color, with possibly the thickest, most pillowy off-whte head I have ever seen. Head lingered thru entire glass, and slowly reduced to excellent lacing. Aroma was a very hoppy citrus, lemon and grapefruit. Taste was hoppy citrus bitterness, but with just enough malt to take the edge off. Palate was smooth and warming, as 9% alcohol made itself known. This beer was quite a treat."
"Great beer, what a unique treat... no doubt I'll be seeking this out again..."
"Belgian tripel with hops? - yes!!! It's unusual, it's exciting, it's well-rounded, and balanced, and drinkable! Superb! The Houblon is without a doubt my favorite of the Achouffe line. Magnificent!!! If it wasn't 9% I could drink this all of the time!"
""
"Zum wohl!"
"Poured into a duvel tulip glass which looks like a great idea as the head on this one is huge, as foretold by the exploding bottle which had been dormant for a few weeks. Pours a cloudy straw yellow wit a giant chunky foamy head, by chunky I mean not level. Aromas of banana and alcohol are dominant. Taste is bitter hops with banana and citrus with some maltiness.This is a great tasting beer but drinkability is limited by the alcohol."
"Pours a hazed, straw yellow with a huge head of white foam. The head slowly settled into a very weird glob of thicker foam in the center of glass. It looks like a spoon full of marshmallow fluff was dropped into my glass. That eventually faded into the belly of the beer, leaving behind about 4 inches of lacing and a ¼ ring of foam around the glass with pockets of off-white fizz in the center. Smells of cloves, creamy malts and estery banana with a backbone of citrus hops. Starts with a light sweetness with some spice. Hops come out in a bitter finish. Earthier hops than the ones in the aroma. Mouthfeel is airy and light with a decent amount of carbonation. Definitely not as weird as I thought it was going to be. Much better than Urthel attempt, in my opinion. I would drink it again, but wouldnt go out of my way to get it."
"Great job to the brewmaster for thinking outside the norm."
"You know what sucks? I only have an 11.2oz bottle and I am almost finished with it. This is a very tasty beer. Is it a Tripel? No. Is it an IPA? No. Is it another kick ass beer from Achouffe? Oh yeah. I love this brewery and this beer has lived up to my internal hype. I was expecting a bit more American hop influence but this beer rocks as is. Thank you Bill, I loved every drop."
"Drinkability: The alcohol recognition really doesn't come into play for me, as the quality and balance of this brew is amazing. Also, at around $9 a bottle, the price range I think is very affordable. It paired very well with my spicy shrimp and penne pasta and made me feel like I was drinking a fine wine with it (when, really, I'd much rather have something like this brew to accompany the dish). I waited way too long to get a bottle of this, so I hope I can find more and stash a bunch away. I'd love to see what happens after some time in the cellar. But damn, this stuff is fantastic and I can't say enough about it."
"D- Very good"
"I think this beer is highly drinkable for any acclimated to the style, not overwhelming in the hop, sugar, or alcohol categories like some. This is exactly what I want from a Tripel."
"Very effervescent on the tongue, crisp and clean. I could actually drink this all day. I know it's 9% but i couldnt really tell. A good showing this one."
"This beer is excellent. Although it is strong and complex, the bready malt makes it still seem lighter, and the mix of flavors keeps you interested, making the drinkability almost dangerous. It's so damn good..."
"This beer pours a very hazy yellow color with one of the largest heads i've ever seen. If its poured with any vigor, this beer will explode in a white foamy head and will not stop growing. The smell is much like you would expect from a tripel-IPA, mostly a sweetly spiced nose with just a hint of hops. The taste is incredible, but this is a synthesis of my two favorite beer types so its pretty much a dream come true. For the first 3/4th of the beer its just like a lightly spiced tripel, but toward the end there is just a kiss of the bitter hops that you would expect out of an IPA. I wouldn't normally equate these beers together, but they are able to seamlessly take the best qualities of both and make one incredible beer. Very impressed."
"This is truly a outstanding beer, perfect for savoring with a cheese plate."
"I really dig the uniqueness if this beer. An incredibly balanced be for what it is. A little pricy but worth a one shot without a doubt."
"Notes: You get what you pay for sometimes and in this case its worth every cent. The best way to describe this beer is that its got all the goodness of a superb belgian Tripel w/ an American hop twister on the frontside that actually blends well."
"-UF"
"Pours clear pale yellow with showy white head and heavy lace. Aroma is a strong point - Saaz hops and Chouffel's Belgian yeast to linger over before moving on to a citric light-medium body featuring a balance of malt with the typical Belgian flavors spiced with tangy citrus-orange American Amarillo-Tomahawlk hops. After a little competition for which will dominate the aftertaste a clean hop finish ends. I will repeat this one."
"Hazy lemon amber. Towering head of fine, cream-like eggshell bubbles that stands for a long time before settling to a still quite tall cap. The foam tastes like hop cream and you could spoon it into a bowl and eat it by itself. Huge, thick bands of lacing grace the glass. There are a few stray carbonation streams. The aromatics are distinctly Belgian triple, with crunchy white fruit, as well as nicely suggestive of a double IPA with spicy, citrusy, orangey hops. There is also a bit of alcohol that shines through. The alcohol edge is distinct from the first taste, but it meshes well with a the fruit crispness of the triple. It is warming and slightly sweet before the hops take over. They are both boldly spicy and citrus rindy, with a nice long lasting finish. There is a slightly resinous element to them as well. Medium body with a light mouthfeel that is well carbonated. Overall, this is an interesting and enjoyable blend of a triple and a double IPA. Highly drinkable, the aromatics were top notch and I could have gone through several more bottles. I am looking forward to the next release of this fantastic beer."
"... this brew is intruiging, difficult to discern any one flavour, this is one i'll come back to time and time again as my tastes evolve."
"Overall: This is a great artisinal beer, though might be a bit too raw for some people. If you like IPA's and tripels, you will love this beer, which combines both into one. A very interesting brew to say the least,"
"Cheers!"
"But overall a pleasant experience. Nothing I'd really seek out, but I certainly don't regret it."
"Overall, a very drinkable ale. Remarkable in its simplicity, and in its complexity. Outstanding!"
"Finally got my hands on some of this. Pours outrageously with a giant rocky head of fluffy, soft white. Body is Pale straw lemon with a faint haze. The glass is cobwebbed with lace. Powdered sugar, Orval-tart yeastiness, and a big citrusy, sea-air wall of hop juice bitterness. Interesting and inviting. Sugary fruit sweetness up front with wheaty malt. Soft, moderate feel witha very dry, peppery finish. Hops come on strong, but not American DIPA strong. Hops are citrusy and tart, refreshing and bitter. Along with De Ranke XX Bitter, perhaps the hoppiest Belgian brew I've had. Pretty good too."
"D- This is one of those epic ales that I will always remember and want to go back to. Right up there with XX Bitter yet a boat load more hops."
"Got this item at Max's on Casey's advice. A goblet full of bright golden liquid, topped with marshmellow fluff. Not a very bold aroma but nice. Super flavors and great balance, with just the right touch of carbonation to enhance. Smooth, clean, and complex finish with the alcohol heft neatly masked. Incredibly drinkable for all that beer. Wow!"
"Mouthfeel is loose but not too light. With the heavy carbonation it makes the long list of flavors more drinkable. Nifty, and a little dangerous at this ABV. Lots of fun, and a good recommendation to adventurous non-beer-snob types."
"I went out the next day and bought more. I love this one."
"Drinkability is great, the hops greatly improve the style for me anyway."
"Medium bodied, with an excellent mouthfeel and drinkability that makes this stuff almost dangerous. So smooth and flavorful you really don't even notice the alcohol sneaking up on you. A tripel for hop lovers, as only the Belgians can do it. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable to consume, though not to the same degree as a traditional Tripel."
"fine brew. i love the hoppiness"
"Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a large foamy white head with great retention and great lacing. Smell is fruitty and floral with a nice sweetness. Taste is initially like an ipa with bitterness from the hops and a nice citrus presence, followed by more of a Belgian taste with a little carmel and fruit. This is great, I love the combo of the two styles. It is very drinkable, and this will definitely be a repeat purchase."
"Hoppy Chouffe is not too hoppy. These hoppy Belgian beers havent been too hoppy as far as I can tell, but this one is still quite nice, and possibly a bit better than the Urthel affair. Dark golden in colour with a nice off-white fluffy cap of foam on top. Aromas of zest floral, piney hops, candy sugar sweetness, and sugar cooke malts, all blending together to make a sweet and well integrated hoppy Belgian beer that is not too hoppy. Taste is sweet and sugary with some nice piney hop notes and wonderful malt complexity. Mouthfeel is zesty and spirtzy, not too thick or filling. Drinkability is quite good, I just wish a hoppier Belgian beer would come out!"
"This is very different, and very good beer. I love it when a brewery can make something altogether different."
"Edit -- Warning! The well-hidden alcohol hits all at once when you've finished the 750 ml! I'm very happy now!"
"The name and the bottle intrigued me and I am not disappointed that I purchased this brew! I'm going to seek out as many more as I can purchase tomorrow! Truly, this is a divine nectar that is worthy of praise!"
"Note - Easily in my top ten, a completely unique and stunning beer. Makes me literally want to shed a tear thinking how much care went into producing this incredible brew."
"From a large corked bottle, this brew pours a light, translucent orange color, yellow at the edges, with a nice thick head and a bit of haze. The aroma is of resin-like and cirtic hops, backed with a lot of esters and yeast smells. Theres a lot of grassiness and a bit of spice in the smell as well, mingled with bread and a little ethanol. The alcohol aroma is a pretty well hidden, given the ABV. The first sensation when you drink this beer is the high carbonation. Following that is an earthy, yeasty flavor, backed by lots of grapefruit-like and pine-like hops. The alcohol warming sets in pretty early-on in this beer. Its not as sweet as I thought it would be. I was very satisfied with this beerlots of hops, in Belgian garb. Interesting, and worth having again."
"750 ml capped bottle pours a cloudy yellow orange color with a huge sticky head that clings to my glass. Spicy yeast and citrus aroma, apple, honey, lemon and spice flavors. Full bodied with nice crisp and carbonated mouthfeel. Very different and tasty, hard to believe it's 9 % alcohol."
"Mouthfeel is light and relatively clean. A strange hybrid style, this offspring of a mild IPA and a Belgian tripel. Probably my favorite of the Chouffe brand to appear locally."
"I have never had anything like this before. Totally unique. Totally quaffable. Awesome."
"D- Very easily downed. I like this much more than I thought I would. Great after a long hot days work."
"Drinks too easy, almost a perfect beer IMO, tripple purists may take offense, but I really enjoyed this treat from my favorite belgian brewery!"
"D: This beer is a something else. Triples are my least favorite Belgian style...but this one I'm a fan of. Quite original and enjoyable."
"Finally traditional (the Belgian style) and contemporary (The massive use of hops) styles come together and create something that isn't awful."
"Pours a light honey with a haze. Two finger sudsy white cap that slowly fell into a low rocky top. Aroma is fruity esters of pear and banana, clove, light biscuit and yeast. A little citrus and alcohol is in the nose. Flavor was very similiar to aroma. Fruity sweetness of banana and clove, light grain and a little pepper, slight sulpher in background. There is the hops in back of the throat, citrusy and grapefruit. Body is medium with med-high carbonation. Finishes dry. Interesting combination of styles, but blends very well in a nice quaffable or sipping beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass, with a large puffy white head on top, with a pale golden color settling in the glass. At first scent, you think, where did this beer come from. Strong hop scents start out, nothing to overbearing though. Then the belgian pale malt and yeast aromas become prevalent, and assert the fruity scents typical with belgian beers. The taste starts with those hops that come across the palate bring some bitterness, but it soon blended away to the wonderful belgian fruitiness and sweetness at the end. It is light in the mouth, not to watery. This is truely a unique beer, a great experimentaion in flavors, and yet seems very easy to drink, a must try."
"In the end, I really enjoyed this beer and can't wait to try more of this style."
"I think this beer would make a decent session beer. It tastes and looks great, but it is just a little high in alcohol. It is definately worth trying though."
"Poured out of a bomber into a tulip glass. Poured slowly, still creating an IMMENSE, frothy, whipped creamy head - unlike any other head I have experienced...even more frothy & thicker than an Old Ruffian. As the beer was going down in the glass, it left an incredible, thick creamy lacing all over the glass. I don;t know if I'd even call it lacing as much as a complete white-out of the glass. What an aesthetic work of art this brew is. Appearance was pretty cloudy, light copper color. Smelled of belgian yeast, tropical fruitiness/citrus, honeydew, and coriander. Taste was complicated, unlike a lot of things I have had before, yet all too familiar. I guess you can definitely call it a Tripel/IPA. The taste reminded me of Westmalle Tripel, tropical fruits and yeast up front, coriander - then the hop bitterness kicks in a bit, but nothing overwhelming. My only beef with the taste of the beer is that the alcohol presence is a little too overwhelming. It subdues a tad, bringing out the fruitiness of the beer, when it warms up a bit, but still is very prevalent. Perhaps this beer would be better aged a year or two imho. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and velvety. Very refreshing with medium carbonation. I may cellar this one and compare/contrast my views."
"Mouthfeel is thick, liquid velvet. Decadent-feeling and yet somehow light on the palate, though the overall richness makes this a sipping-beer. Alcohol goes almost completely undetected, which is dangerous considering the ABV. While quite good, the 9% plus the chewy texture makes this a one-glass beer for me."
"drinkability: great"
"Bottle: Poured a deep dirty and hazy yellow color ale with a super huge pure white foamy head with absolutely perfect retention and lacing. Aroma of floral hops is quite intense with what I think are Saaz hops really taking over this wonderful mix. Taste when beer is slightly below room temperature is akin to a wonderful triple (Westmalle, Moinette) with some added floral undertones. When beer gets at about room temperature the hops really comes out and provide a bitter finish which I enjoyed a bit less. Nonetheless, this is a great experience and would probably try this again even though price is a bit high IMO for this beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: A very unique American/Belgian hybrid created with the utmost style and grace. An elegant blend of fruity esters, dry yeast, and juicy, yet restrained hops that show all of their flavor without an astringent bitterness. Simply a delight to drink."
"Drinkability: This is a real treat - all the wonderful flavor and complexity of La Chouffe with a wonderfully balanced hops bristle. The hops are a little light for the dobbelen IPA end of things, but this balances the tripel flavor nicely and develops a truly unique beer. I'll be sure to drink more of this while I can."
"Drinkability: This is definitely more tripel than it is IPA, but it is really an interesting experiment with beautiful results. Highly drinkable (but be careful - the 9% is well-hidden), and highly recommended. And it matched perfectly with this: http://www.allagash.com/ice_contest.htm#2003_03."
"While I enjoy the beer, I do not find it to be imminently drinkable, although it manages to hide the abv quite well. As I mentioned, a very interesting brew, and although I'm not sure how soon I'll be purchasing this one again, it is great to see other countries experimenting with styles the way the US does.... thumbs up to the gnome."
"Drinkability: A unique melding of two styles. Certainly more Tripel than IPA but I like the results. The high alcohol content and price makes this an occasional beer for me rather than a go to brew."
"It's hard drinking this not thinking you're drinking an experiment, which is strange as it so very subtle. A good tasting beer, but generally in the $10 range for a 750 mL - likely one I won't revisit often."
"This is a solid, and entirely unique snifter. A good beer and one to try for someone interested in something in a league or style of its own."
"D- went down easily enough, a good beer, definitely intresting and worth a try, especially if youre a fan of both the styles like myself"
"After the head settles and I can get my lips on this one, the flavors that shine through are only mildly hoppy (a combo of Saaz, Amarillo and Tomahawk), with a pleasant fruity backbone. Alcohol is kept nicely in check, and just barely noticeable in the dry finish. A quality beer, though not truly an IPA or a Tripel"
"Pours clear golden straw color with big airy white head, very persistent lace, and slow carbonation. Smells of earthy yeast, some barnyard funk, tangy hops, lemon and orange zest fruitiness. Flavor is an interesting interplay of typical tripel fruitiness with American hops. Starts with coarse graininess, builds sweet tropical citrus and banana flavors in the center, finishes with pepper, yeast, rough grapefruit hops, and quenching mouth-puckering dryness. Lighter, easier-drinking, and more carbonated than expected in the mouth. Surprisingly appetizing and successful!"
"Absolutely gorgeous beer. This is my first time to try it, and I find it one of the best beers I've ever had. YUM!"
"A huge white head explodes off a pale straw colored beer with an obvious amount of carbonation. The head never completely disappears, leaving a remarkable merengue-like substance that clings to the walls of the glass. This is an IPA, Belgian-style, which is to say, extremely interesting. Loaded with Amarillo, Tomahawk, and Saaz the aroma is actually dominated by the typical Belgian Tripel qualities: spicy, a bit fruity, with that lovely yeastiness that defines the style. The hops are there, but in the background. The taste is a marvel, at first extermely tripel-like, sweet and yeasty and spicy. The load of hops quickly comes to the fore with a dominating bitterness and a nice hop flavor. Towards the finish, the sweetness comes back and dances around the hop bitterness. Very drinkable, I didn't have a problem finishing the 750 by myself. The mouthfeel is bouyed by a blast of carbonation. This is an extermely interesting beer....I'm not sure it would ever be an ""everyday"" beer for me, but when in the mood for something a bit experimental, it's great!"
"The drinkability, for me, was way down since it found the flavor so trying. I appreciate the creativity of this beer, but I just felt like it was the wrong combination of styles, and at least of hops. I want to try a something like this with more citrus flavored hops and less pine-like ones."
"In the meantime, this is a terrific beer from a classic artisinal Ardennes brewery - a ""must try"" in my book. Enjoy."
"Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel, even though it contains at least three different styles in its name, is a singular creation by a master Belgian brewer. Some will discount over-the-top hoppiness as a passing fad, but in the right hands (and the hands at Brasserie d'Achouffe are some of the most capable that you'll find) it turns great beer into transcendent beer. Houblon Chouffe looks like a masterpiece and drinks like a dream."
"Now I need to go find this on tap."
"It goes down easier considering its fullness and its alcohol content. But its made to savor. Great brew, if you ask me!"
"Beer is good. Happy new adventurous beering."
"Overall, this is a fantastic brew. I look forward to trying the other two styles from this brewery that are available to me."
"After its disinterment from the 750ml brown bottle, it sets in the glass a bemused golden yellow with a demonstrative creamy off white head that settles slowly forming a glutinous coating of lace. Nose is dominated by the grassy hop floral aroma, banana like, pepper and orange peel, citrus like in its crispness, start is sweet with a delightful grain presence and the top moderate in its feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity, the hops potent, with a desert dry aftertaste that welds itself to your palate, a beer with multiple personalities, I found if quite drinkable, different for sure."
"I like these new hoppy belgian beers that are starting to come out. This still has a lot of the character of a good belgian ale and the twist of high hops."
"Mouthfeel is nice and easy going. Good carbonation and a nice creamy sensation as it goes down. Pretty easy to drink as the alcohol is not at all apparent in the brew. Overall this is a tasty, unique, special brew from Achouffe. Not something I see myself drinking all the time, but a nice change of pace. It's fun to see more Belgian brewers embracing the hops. Check this one out if you run across it for sure."
"This is a great beer but not as hoppy as I expect. I really enjoyed this for a great Belgian though and I'll more than likely revisit this one."
"750 ML bottle, thanks to Imstillthegman and BIF 33. Pours with a merangue head, and it's HUGE. Litereally, about 80-90% of the glass if foam. Overcabonated. Aroma is nice, piney for a triple, perhaps leaning towards IPA. Taste is sweet, piney, grapefruit(?). Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation gets in the way. It's plenty interesting, but I've had better from this style."
"A golden yellow beer with a slight haze. Has a magnificent huge creamy white head. With great lace. The aroma at first is piney with a hint of lemon in the background. The citrusy lemon character then transforms into a hard lemon candy with just a hint of alcohol way in the back. Only a belgian ale could make your tastebuds do the jumping around that this beer does. Hoppy, malty. citrusy, peppery. Every mouthful a new experiance. Hints of sugar candy on the side of your tongue with a nice sharp dry finish"
"Taste has a lemon pith/rind character and old hops with a background of oil of bergamot and a black tea bitterness. The mouthfeel has a tannic bitterness As it warms, I get a bit of a sweet bubblegum flavor and some mintiness/marigold smell. Very interesting. Very drinkable."
"Poured like a classic Belgian beer with an enourmous, pillow-white head that filled a good half of my tulip glass. As the beer began to breathe, crags and valleys and a fair bit of lacing appeared above a straw wheat gold body. This beer looked like everything a beer should look like. Perhaps the weekest part of the Dobbelen was the nose. It offered little in the way of creativity with perhaps some slight whiffs of the saaz hops and a bit of barnyardy grass, but nothing really overpowering. The taste however was crisp, refreshing, full of the interesting mixture of belgian tripel with its creamcicle like flavors and the IPA character replete with a hoppy bite and a bittering finish. Very flavorful and worth drinking."
"Drinkability: What an interesting beer. A hopped up Belgian Trippel. A nice blend of hop bitterness intermingled with a fruity and flowery sweetness. Dry to the bone makes you want to drink more and more. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile but you can feel its warming effects. Easy to drink and one I will be buying again. Very unique. Seek this very interesting take on a Tripple and enjoy."
"Drinkability - this is good, goes down well, but high abv limits to one in a session."
"As much as I like this one, I will still take De Ranke XX Bitter as my favorite of hoppy Belgian beers. Nonetheless, this one is highly recommended."
"D - Good. I wish I had normal access to this beer."
"This brew has an active carbonation with a medium body. Taste is slightly peppery with a hop presence that is quite green. Undertones of banana and citrus are evident. Drink ends with a splash of prickly, bitter hop carbonation while yielding a dry tonic water finish. Not too bad. All in all the hop bitterness is the story here. Absolutely no help from constituent ingredients to help quell the bitter beast which is the hop balance, or should I say lack thereof. Still, this brew has something to offer as the nuances underneath the hop current are varied and interesting. Well worth a try."
"All things considered, the 750 did drain quite quickly."
"Overall Impression: It is slightly annoying after awhile to wait, once again, for the massive head to slowly drop into its malleable blob, but in the end, its worth the wait. I really enjoyed the citric lemon aspect and the unusual combination of worlds. This is a solid choice for review 600; recommended."
"But with all the talk of the hops factor in this one, I'm still not convinced the Belgians either 1) know how to, or 2) care to mirror the ultra-hopped IPAs that this was apparently inspired by. No matter, this has all the complexity and satisfaction that the best tripels should deliver, it's different, and the well-hidden alcohol and creamy/fruity elements makes this almost too easy to drink. Would be great to try this on tap, or right at the brewery, because I feel like I'm too new to Houblon to glean its deepest subtleties. A beguiling and intruiging ale for sure."
"An interesting concoction to say the least. The alcohol presence seems to be a bit heavy with a lack of balance at times. This is probably the only thing keeping me from indulging in this Belgian more often."
"Drinkability- Another quality brew by La Chouffe...this one will be purchased again in the future."
"Drinkability is decent, but for the price I will pass on this one next time. There are better, hoppy Belgian ales out there. This one is an interesting effort, but just doesn't work for me. Malt balance is lacking. Doesn't succeed as a morphed Tripel or IPA."
"Despite that, I detected aromas of honey, hard candy, yeast, and freshly cut grass. The taste was very much in line with what might be expected from a Tripel with subtle bitterness underneath. Good texture with a slightly astringent finish. Overall, this beer was smooth and sour with a rich and flavorful profile dominated by various sweet flavors. Easy to sip and one to enjoy with cheese."
"Some healthy body that gives a smooth creamy mouthfeel plus a nice warming from the high ABV. This is a big, beautiful brew that's real easy to drink, but best enjoyed slowly...and it ain't cheap."
"Well done Chouffe. You win this time you rogue."
"This beer is called an IPA, and should get respect for that, since evidently as the story goes the brewer in Belgium was inspired by IPAs being brewed in California which is EPIC! But this is not really an IPA, it's a Belgian saison beer. The IPA reference, aside from the name, comes from a little bit of cascade aromatics just at the end as you swallow the beer. All the same, I guess you'd say that this beer is unique among Belgians, but the brewer has not created a great new style, rather he has created a very drinkable hybrid. I would drink about 12 oz. of this beer, but not a full pint, because it's a little too sweet. But I wouldn't have a problem quaffing a Stone IPA, then a Chouffe IPA, then a Pure Hoppiness or something. It's stong enough to hold its own in the middle."
"Mouthfeel- A little dry, but overall a medium fading flavor from the tongue. Lots of grain and hop interplay."
"Pretty carbonated, but not too thin on the pallate. Not very drinkable, as this bottle is being split with my lady and I doubt i'd be able to polish off an entire bottle on my own."
"Fine drinkability. Soft, yielding, delightful, and yummyliscious. It makes a slow settled, sinking impression into the mind with wonderment and awe as it makes me ponder how a beer so good could be so dangerous. I mean it made me say something along the lines of 'savoriness'? C'mon, thats worth something, isn't it? Wow! A lovely, lovely beer. A real winner by Chouffe!"
"Achouffe is definitely on to something here. I look forward to version 2.0."
"Overall: This is an interesting fusion of styles. There are very pleasant Tripel flavors along with a nice strident bitterness."
"Explodes with a five+ fingered white, pillowy head that leaves gobs of lace. A clear pale amber color. Hoppy nose. Starts just on the hoppy side with some sourness, slight hop but smooth finish. Good carbonation and medium bodied. $7.99 for a 750ml bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA. Also $4.19 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"This is great, great, great, great."
"Enjoyed a 750ml bottle on a warm spring evening. Beer poured a slightly hazy gold color with a massive head that lasted until I was done. I didn't get much aroma, predominantly hops with some citrus. Taste was exceptional, started slightly sweet, then the hops kicked in, and it finished with some spice/pepper. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent despite alcohol content. I drink a fair amount of Belgians, and this one is not very representative of the style, but I really enjoyed it however it is classified. Dangerous beer because it is so easy to drink...."
"The only downfall I think would be if you don't care for very hoppy beers because this one is definately hoppy."
"A big thank to AlexJ who not only provided this beer at the Charlotte beer pairing event, but for making some excellent Chicken Satay with homemade Thai peanut sauce. I'm unsure how some figure what to pair with what, but this one just paired beautifully with the spices. Nice hazy appearance to it."
"Drinkability was good enough for me to drink four in a row and I very rarely drink the same beer twice in one sitting, especially when Im at a place with a great selection like the Firkin."
"This ale hangs tight on the palate, sticking it out, giving a kick every inch of the way, but downable and delicious. I'm liking it, and I think I'll like it again and again. But then again, I've never met a Chouffe I didn't like."
"Edit: Scores adjusted for Batch #2. I am in love with this beer. This beer just proves that there couldn't be a better time to beer a beer lover in America. Not only is the selection of American micros seeminly expanding by ten-fold each year, but the brewers of the old world are following our lead. The result is an orgy of mouthwatering American hops and belgian yeast complexity. It tastes like citrus and bubblegum. Not too sweet, not too dry, just the perfect amount of bitterness (which seems like a bit more than batch #1 to me). The head on this beer is phenomenal, and the lacing is amongst the thickest I've seen. This is easily the best use of Amarillo hops I've had, as many ""Amerikuhn"" brewers like to use too much of a good thing, in our typical fashion. Highly recommended to anybody. If you see the gnome, bring him home!"
"Despite its strenght, very very drinkable. Overall, a superb ale. It bursts with fresh hops, but they are nicely integrated into a spicy, fruity Belgian yeast character. I want a case of this. Its been a while since I've declared that."
"Not a bad beer but it is not a superior Triple or an IPA. A strange beer that I can recommend as an oddity but in truth the normal La Chouffe is just plain better."
"This poured a cloudy, straw yellow with a thick, bright white head. Clumpy lace was left behind as the glass was emptied. The aroma was spicy, bready, and yeasty, with a little bit of lemon. Moderate bitterness with plenty of bread and floral hops. Some citrus fruitiness, lemon, and pleasant spiciness. Bitterness grew into the finish. A bit dry with a lightish body supported by high carbonation. Mild alcohol warmth. Pretty good. Thanks biegaman!"
"Notes  This is classified as a Tripel but really is a Double IPA-type of Tripel as it states on the label. I think if I were to rate this IAW strict Belgian Tripel guidelines it would have went down a notch or two, but as long as they are proclaiming their intentions right on the bottle I threw caution to the wind and just went for a more open-mined approach."
"P.S. In terms of rating, grading this against other tripels is really a mistake since it attempts to carve out a pretty new niche. Therefore, all numbers are really a general grade (as are most of my reviews I admit)."
"Yet another hit, in my book, from these folks."
"Overall: Hmmmso it has a big write up on B.Uniteds Website, but I am very surprised to see that this new Houblon Chouffe is not even mentioned on the Achouffe Brewery Website (as of the date of this Review at least)!!! This I think hints big style at the target market for this brew..clearly the US, where I think it will do extremely well, not so sure back home though. Sure, I enjoyed it, but strip away the fan-fare and let all the Houblon-talk die down and its a nice Hoppy grapefruit Blonde of sorts but its low on the IPA traits and its no De Ranke XX Bitter, Ill stick with the latter for my Belgian Hop fix."
"I might be biased in my review because I love pale ales and tripels, but this is truly a great beer. Poured into a chalice, the beer has a beautiful fluffy head that reminds me of lemon meringue pie in appearance. The smell is complex, with the spicy yeast and piney hops making for a really unique nose. The hop flavor of this beer is just right, not so overpowering as to diminish the traditional tripel flavors, but it's definitely there. The flavors mingle with each other with each taste, seeming to alternate with each sip. Sometimes the hops stand out, sometimes the yeast. A really great experiment by the chouffe, and a really fun beer to drink."
"Pours out with a cloudy yellow body and a huge white pillowy head of foam. The head breaks down slowly leaving a mountain of foam in the middle and covering the entire glass. Nice light floral hoppiness comes out in the aroma with a bit of fruit sweetness. Some light notes of yeast and alcohol, a bit mild but interesting. The flavor starts sweet with fruits before some bitter earthy hops and spices show up. Some yeasty notes and light alcohol. Very interesting overall taste that was good but didnt quite do it for me. Plenty of carbonation and a thick body carried the flavor well. It started off easy drinking enough but by the time I was on the last half of the bottle it took a bit more work to finish. A unique beer thats definitely worth a try and has some interesting things going on in it."
"It was drinkable, but not something that I would necessarily go out of my way for. It was very different - something I would have to be in the mood for."
"I've been looking forward to this beer, and finally got a chance to sample it. It was a cloudy yellow with a thick Belgian head. Some nice lacing. Fragrance was all floral, very pleasant. It had an interesting taste. There was a sweet, citrus taste; a hoppy taste; and a spicy taste. I thought it a little discordant, and am not sure the IPA/Belgian angle works that well. Will have to try it again."
"Drinkability - I drank this first in the night and didn't feel the effects of the high abv until later in the evening. Be warned, it will catch up to you."
"Fresh, fruity esters. Slightly flinty. Initially quite sweet, but finishes dry and masks its strength very well. Medium-full bodied, robust carbonation, but still soft on the palete. A unique and very drinkable take on a tripel."
"D - This can be imbibed all the time, anywhere, anytime, no matter the season of year or anything."
"D - nicely balanced, unique beer. Alcohol is well hidden, but above average. Good, but not something I'm going to seek out and order regularly."
"D - very high, a great session beer, especially for a tripel, would highly reccommend, great balance"
"Pours a hazy gold color with an un-freakin'-believable white head. Looks like whipped cream filling half my goblet. Leaves a ton of lacing and a few chunks hanging onto the side as well. The smell is of yeast...slightly sour, with a bit of floral hops and candied fruit lingering in the background. Taste a lot like it's name. Perfect blend of the two styles. Starts with a sweetness quickly followed by a spicy pepper flavor before the bitterness from the hops take over. Some alcohol warming felt on swallowing. Medium bodied, smooth, well carbonated mouthfeel. You can tell the higher abv is present in this beer. Quite tasty. The little Chouffe came up with a fabulous recipe during his latest journey"
"This is a fantastic brew, it has depth, a myriad of flavors, the only flaw is that it is slightly over carbonated IMO, but none the less fantastic."
"I would buy this again, but it's not on the top of my list. I just don't have any idea what to think about it. It is definitely not what you expect. I'm curious to see what this may do with a bit of age on it... IPA's shouldn't be aged, but some belgians should... what do I do? At the very least, this beer gets the ""prettiest beer award"" in my book. That head is just unbelievable."
" The maker of this beer has hit a bullseye. The bitter, citric American hops pair well with the fruity esters and huge malts. You taste the fruit for an instant, then the hops. Fruit, hops, and so on and so on. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick, creamy, and foamy. The alcohol is barely perceived, drinkability is perfect."
"I thought about buying 2 of these last thursday and only bought one - guess you know where I am going tomorrow and crossing my fingers that one is still there."
"Drinkability: Handling this bottle will not be a chore. This beer is big and spicy, very different, and the experimentation is welcomed."
"I enjoyed the beer and found it drinkable but in carefull moderation. It nicely combines the aspect of a few styles while maintaining balance and character."
" The aroma is a touch musty up front, with Belgian ale yeast, some light spices, and a good bit of floral hops. Palate is, well, a hybrid between an IPA and a tripel. Sweet and mellow up front, with notes of light fruit and black pepper. Towards the back of the mouth the hops emerge, providing a nice slightly bitter finish along with some warming from the alcohol. Body is very nice, light and buttery, yet substantial enough to hold the complexity of the palate. Easy to drink for something so complex and strong. Man, I love the gnome."
"Somebody had to marry the two of the most popular strong pale ale beer styles in the world. Brasserie DAchouffe from Belgium finally did it, and the result is a hybrid Double IPA and Tripel. Unlike most Belgian bombers, this one was simply crown capped, with no cork to pull. As I poured out the contents of the green bomber into a Tulip, a massive soufflé like head formed above the rim of the glass reminding me very much of Duvel. Each time I poured more liquid, the head reappeared in its craggy peaks. While the looks were pretty much all Belgian, the aroma was more or less balanced between the two styles. The hops were easily detectable by the nose, but were most apparently of the floral Saaz variety, and not so much the citric and piney types found more commonly in the DIPAs. There was also a yeasty and bready smell typical of many Tripels. As the head died down, I could taste the beer, and the taste was more dominated by hops than the smell had led me so far. The bitterness of hops led to a taste sensation that was unmistakably influenced by modern American brewing. While not a high alpha hop bomb, this was clearly closer in taste to an APA or a single IPA, than a Tripel, although the peppery spiciness and candi sugar sweetness poking through from time to time were alien to those styles. If I had a bone to pick here, it would be with the readily apparent 9% ABV. Normally its not a bad thing for a beer to be warming, but that is not a typical characteristic of either of the two styles being melded into this concoction. The mouthfeel was light as a result of the sprightly carbonation, which was again in the Tripel territory. This beer was a bit underwhelming to me as a DIPA. As a Tripel, it was a ballsy brew. The seemingly dual nature of the experience was not a problem with me, but some others may find it a bit incoherent."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass. Cloudy golden with a massive rocky white head and thick, clumpy lacing. Nose is primarily of Saaz spiciness and ""typical"" Belgian yeast funk (y'know, green apples, tannic grape skins, newly mown hay, etc.) -- although because of this, I can't say it's anything special. Wow, this tastes exactly like the name makes it sound like it would taste: a primarily sweet and fruity tripel initially, then followed by a bitter and citric hop ballast. Hop flavors also range into grassy and medicinal territory as well. Medium body and clean, juicy, and full mouthfeel. Refreshing, in an odd sort of way. Not bad for the price ($5.99 + deposit and tax at Consumer's in Kenmore). Definitely one to try."
"This one pours a cloudy golden color with a very tall head that sticks around a while and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is very floral and slightly spicy from the hops. Interesting. The flavor is full of hops that taste like noble hops. I really don't care for this type of hop flavoring, but the malt character is strong in the back and it lends a little caramel flavoring. The body is on the thick end of moderate and the drinkability is good."
"highly hopped Belgium,the second in as many days. Bitterness is not as drinkable as was the Uthel hop-it, i.e. a character of malted offsetting like a double ipa. its got musty yeast that doesn't right hit the spot with me. Ntonetheless,much creaminess and an interesting hop profile for the hophead portion of me. Fresh from Knightly Spirits in Orlando."
"Summary: Good beer, but I hope they up the Belgian flavors in the future so this will neither emphasize its Belgianness nor its hops for a hybrid style."
"Cheers!"
"Fabulous beer, well worth getting."
"experimental like and american beer, but belgian in character, quality and origin, a great combination."
"D: This is a good slow drinking beer. I think, for me, I would limit it to two. Good and unique beer though. Kudos for Chouffe for trying something new and shaking up the establishment."
"I'm trying this in the bottle for the first time. The head wasn't as nice as it was on tap, but it was still damn good. Body is like pooled honey in my glass. Nose is honey, buggle gum and cotton candy. Nose is leagues away from what it was on tap. Plus, on my first sip on tap all I could taste from the foam was the hops. Here it seems the flavors have meshed (not that I thought balance was a problem before) and really complement each other. Props to Chouffe. You've made what I imagine will influence many other brewers in your country ... and will make you a legend."
"This pours a yellow straw with a giant white foamy head. This beer has a ton of carbonation. The smell has a strong hop and sugar aroma. Those two scents are the most dominant,but there are also some pine and citrus zest aromas. The taste is hoppy and pine filled. This beer has an IPA taste,but with a sour aftertaste. Very interesting. The m/f is light and well balanced. Overall,this is a quality beer that should not be missed. The label says 9 % alcohol,but you can't tell by the taste. Mmmm Good beer."
"Mouthfeel is of fully carbonated brew and much like a sweet dessert with a hoppy pine that lingers."
"On tap at the Gingerman in New York. Light straw gold and hazy with a fluffy white head. Nose has lemon citrus, a little bread. The flavor really reminds me of a triple with a dump of hops. Light citrus lemon, light caramel, big citrus kick in the middle, a little grass a lot of alcohol on the finish. Light slick mouth feel, ok drinkability. I had great hopes for this beer. It really is what you would expect LaChouffe with a healthy supply of hops. If thats what you want, youll really enjoy it. I was hoping for something a little different."
"Power and elegance are both on display and with remarkable balance- it's not a rival of IPA's but it is a hop-forward Belgian beer in all its glory."
"I taste with a clean pallet"
"I'd been looking forward to trying this since reading the article the bros. put out on this beer. IPAs and Tripels are some of my favorite styles, so what could be better than a marriage of the two?. It poured a deep golden color into my Duvel tulip and had a huge rocky head that took forever to dissipate. It left tons of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma was an enticing mix of sweet malt, spices and candi sugar. The taste was a wonderful melding of sweetness, citrus, pine and peppery spiciness. The beer finishes quite dry. This was very easy to drink and quite smooth. The alcohol is well hidden and makes this beer a good thirst quencher. I could easily down one of these on a hot summer day. A hophead expecting something along the lines of an IPA might be disappointed though. This beer leans more towards it's Belgian roots and has more of the characteristics of a Tripel."
"I can't imagine anyone's first sip of this being anything but a pleasing surprise. It's the merging of two worlds, yielding damn near the best of each. The ABV is hefty, but the way the beer dries and crisps it's very refreshing and drinkable. Some beers suffer by trying to be too many things, but this is not one of them. Instead, it has its own happy, snappy identity."
"750 ml bottle. Pours a straw color with an amazing billowing head that appears to continue growing to a massive cap over top. Clarity is moderate, with a bit of haze in there. Massive cascading bubbles help maintain the head. This one is going to take a long tim to get a full glass poured. Nose is hindered a bit by the foam. I get most notes of the tripel. Solid pilsner malt sweetness with a moderate sugary sweetness, layered with light lemon and banana creamyness. Floral noble hops are definately there and prevalent, but seem to really blend well with the tripel aromas. I just can't get the head to receed enough to fill the glass to the 25 cl mark. The head is actually bordering on solid. It is dense. Flavor is not as hoppy as I expected. Its got a very nice sweetness, with just a kiss of banana fruityness and lemon, with a interesting combination of hop flavors that break through after swallowing the beer. The hops are floral, slightly soapy, and moderately bitter. It's tasty, yet seems like the hops are battling against the base beer. Feel is moderate, with a very nice smoothness about it. Carbonation is fairly minimal, as it seems to all have bubbled out maintaining the head. Overall, drinkability is good on this brew. The ABV is not apparent in the nose of flavor. I like the mouthfeel a lot. I wonder if the tap variety is as heady."
"Poured from a 1pt. 9 oz bomber into a tulip. First thing is the absolute massive Duvel-esque head that forms with even the softest pour. It's really quite beautiful floating atop the cloudy peach body of this brew and though it does dissipate in time, it still leaves a huge dimple filled marshmallow island and sporadic lacing everywhere and for the duration of the session. The smell is typically Belgian: pepper, lemon, hay but with some nice sweet citrus hops mixed in. Taste is just really awesome. The slightly sweet candi sugars and Belgian spiciness mixed with the tangerine flavored hops and their bitterness. The mouthfeel is nice as well. Creamy, fruity and tart all in one sip. The marriage of the two styles is complete when my favorite aspects of them meld...the aftertaste. The lingering IPA hops and Tripel spices sit on the tongue and leave and play off each other long after the brew itself leaves your mouth. Just an overall great offering from a great brewery. A bit different and daring for a Belgian beer but I think it was done to great success here."
"Well there is alot of hype that comes with this beer but it was what I expected really.Poured a hazy light golden with a big blooming white fluffy head,aromas are yeasty somewhat pneolic with herbal notes.Yeah this beer is pretty hoppy the saaz really show thru quite spicey and zippy with ""green"" herbal notes and somewhat medicinal.The Belgian yeast is very prevelant along with a mineral-like quality,eh its ok but to me along the same lines of Urthel Hop It in its hop character just not my thing I guess but a solid beer none the less."
"This is easily the ""hoppiest"" Belgian beer I've had. Quite the unique concoction. As someone else pointed out, it's like if you took La Chouffe (which I really like) and dumped a bunch of hops in, that's about what they ended up with here. Pours a huge, lasting, foamy head (almost reminiscent of Duvel). Take your time pouring! Tangy taste, dry bitter finish. Packs a whollup which seems bigger than the 9% ABV would suggest. If you're a tripel fan, and/or an American double IPA fan, grab this up. Quite a marriage. Thanks Ron!"
"The mouth is alive with lots of carbonation and hop dryness that help clear the palate save for some lingering hop flavors. This is a great beer. I will buy more in the morning before work. I'll make sure to keep it in my truck in the parking structure down the street....but who knows...those gnomes have a history of causing mischief."
"Opaque medium yellow color with a dullish brightness. Good head, rocky and rising to over 1/2 an inch. Laces in dripping rings. Nice aroma, medium malt base with a slight sharpness and a definite Amarillo orange cream backbone. Carbonation is high, but still the mouthfeel comes off as medium with a solidly textured impression. Flavor starts with a pointed tanginess, bittering hops seem to re-inforce the aroma in a one-two effort. Nevertheless, by mid mouth there is a distinct husky and slightly oily sweetened apricot tone, partly malt-derived from residual sugars and perhaps owing to the the finishing mix of aroma hops. A pretty big mix of characteristics, perhaps there could be a more seamless blend of the dominant qualities."
"Really good, I'll happily try it again if someone else buys it. Otherwise I'll be careful because Brasserie d'Achouffe keeps bottling the 750's in green bottles. This might be too fresh or too hopped to be skunked, but over time you never know."
"As for drinkability, this was off-the-chart for me. The bottle was emptying at an alarming rate until I reined my tastebuds in. The brewers at d'Achouffe have produced a sublime brew that, on the surface, doesn't seem to possibly work. However, the elements co-exist beautifully and make for a standout hybrid. I wish I'd had more room in my backpack for this liquid gold."
"Not as hoppy as you would expect. My wife doesn't like belgians but loved this. Go figure. Basically tastes like la chouffe kicked up a bit in the hop bitterness. A very drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thinish. Finishes dry. Very refreshing though with its spiciness and crispness from the carbonation. Drinkability is superb. I'll really struggled not getting another glass of this tonight. Hopefully I can get a couple bottles to enjoy this at home. Good stuff, definately worth seeking out or making a special trip."
"Drinkability: easy drinking, and the alcohol is well hidden and could sneek up on you. This is a unique beer, and it grew on me during the session. I'm looking forward to having a few more of these in the near future. All IPA fans must seek this out."
"D: I need more of this nectar, I bought 4 bottles, I hope that this stunner is widely available all year round, go get some and enjoy!"
"D: There's nothing here that you wouldn't expect to find in either a tripel or a DIPA, but to maintain the characteristics of both of these styles and make a beer this good truly shows the artistry of the brewers."
"drinkability: very highly drinkable. like i said earlier the alcohol content goes almost unoticed. pretty amazing. i could have had more than one bottle, which is rare for me being i'm a bit of a light weight with bigger beers."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both extremely high. Carbonation is pretty big, but still doesn't take away from the wonderful flavor. High abv is pretty noticeable as it burns when you sniff, otherwise its kind of hidden in the taste. Definately drinkable, but only one. A good and different tasting brew."
"Body is very big on this one. Mouthfeel is creamy and slick. leaving your lips hoppy and sticky with each sip. I bet this would age wonderfully, although the mighty hop character would lose some of it's luster. Hoppy, fruity, full, wonderfully complex, and different. I love it. Go buy lots right now!"
"Overall- a unique blend but 1 I wasn't too crazy about. The strong alcohol almost ruins the beer."
"I have been anticipating this beer since I saw it on the importers website. I love both the other beers I have had from this brewery. It pours with a bright straw color and really nice head into my 16 oz goblet. Has tons of bubbles in the head. Lots of aroma. Mostly sweet malt typical of a triple, but with a bit of hops at the end. Leans toward the sazz. Taste is truly unique. Different from other hoppy belgian beers I have tried. Not as hoppy as the Deranke XX Bitter, and not as biscuit as La Rulles Triple. Leaves a tingly sensation on the tip of my tongue, almost like licking a 9 volt battery. I am only half way through the bottle so maybe when it warms up a little the flavors will become more distinctive. Overall, I would say I would probably buy this again, would really like a chance to have it on tap."
"starts sweet but balanced with a cleansing, bitter, floral hop finish. starts like a belgian blonde and finishes like an american ipa. nice blend of flavors to make a balanced, drinkable beer."
"Overall impression: Very refreshing and enjoyable. Not as offensive as a classic tripel (which I don't usually like) and not as bold as any American IPA. I dig the experimentation. A nice blend of both styles. Recommended."
"Notes: much hoppier than Urthel's Hop-It. Too much bitterness not enough hoppiness, sweetness. Good experience and enjoyable."
"750 ml bottle, $7.99 at Greenlife in Asheville, NC."
"This is a very, very nice beer. It has a nice hop bite in the back of the mouth. The taste has the typical Belgian fruity yeastiness, and in this case I get a bit of figs and prunes. What sets this beer apart is its absurd drinkablity. The hop finish is very dry, as if the only thing that can soothe the toungue is another sip. I could drink this beer all night, and would if it were a bit cheaper."
"Coming into this brew blind, I feel like I had a unique take on it. Rarely do I enjoy a beer without knowing what it is, and this one impressed me no matter what the style. I was definitely confused, because it wasn't exactly spicy like coriander, but it wasn't entirely unlike it, either. I looked like a witbier, and smelled like it, too, so I just assumed it was another crazy beer from the gnome of belgium. Indeed it was, but a stronger animal than i expected. Respect the gnome, because I felt the effects of sucking this bad boy down. Very good. I loved it. I'd like to try a bottle for comparison. Word on the street's that it's not quite the same."
"I've been anticipating this beer for a bit now. It's just about what I expected -- the hops aren't perfectly integrated with the malt, but it's a good effort, especially in a style that most Belgian brewers aren't accustomed to making. It will be interesting to see how this brew evolves over different batches, but even now it's pretty damn good."
"interesting take, hope this is more of a one-off. if not, no worries.. i'll stick with the original though. messing with near-perfection is not the way to chouffe enlightenment although it is a nice change from the classic norm."
"Turbid and straw yellow, with a sizable white foamy head; quick streams of carbonation reinforce. Familiar Chouffe yeasty nose accented by large (this is Belgian you know) doses of citrus, grass, and candy-sweet malt. Nicely balanced hop flavor and esters, sweet malt finish. Hardly a hint of the 9% ABV. Bitterness is big, nice and big, perhaps a bit out of whack. On second taste, hop flavor seems second compared to the mildly raw bitterness. Very good beer in a bottle. Even better draft. I cant wait to see what this is like a batch or two once they nail what theyre looking for. Worth seeking out like De Ranke."
"The beer was hoppy, but not IPA hoppy. There was a lot of body in this to balance the somewhat high hop levels. I found it to be a very solid triple."
"Sampled at ZBF 4-3-06. Nice and forever lasting white head and a witbier like pale golden beer. Nose is nice and hoppy, anis, malts and backed with high alcohol damps. Taste is rich malty, bit sweet but balanced with high but peaking and not hanging bitterness and warming alcohol. Great brew and a pleasure to drink making wanting for more."
