4.02,-2,3.75,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Overall, this is one of the most impressive uses of wine barreling we’ve ever encountered.  The chardonnay flavoring just pours off of the oak, blending with the warming, bold graininess of a surprisingly bitter base tripel.  The result is rather mixed however.  You find cloying sugars clashing with the most intensely puckering and bittering phenols around, all with this grapey wine and ethanol flavoring that never fully clicks for us.  The biggest surprise here is that nose.  It tends towards the wild side, more so than either a Belgian IPA or a tripel (it’s hard to nail this down stylistically, as so many things are mentioned on the bottle, contrasting with what we actually get).  That is probably why we felt so discombobulated through the flavoring and beyond.  You never quite know where you are with this beer, and it leaves you questioning your own basic knowledge of beer.  As our introduction to Nebraska Brewing Company, this has certainly piqued our interest.","TheBrewo","Feb 19, 2015"

4.48,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Hi, I bought Hop God Last night. You asked me to let you know what I thought. First, my nose is almost completely dead from childhood allergies, so I require a beer that really stands up to notice anything. This one does. Pours a beautiful cloudy gold, with a moderate head (I poured it pretty cold). Nice lacing, etc. First thing was, I got citrus on the nose. It's got to be strong, for me to smell at all. A little bit grapefruity on the tongue. It's hard to quantify the mouth feel, it's pretty bright and then hangs around with what I think is a citrusy aftertaste. There is actually enough going on with this beer, the hops aren't really the biggest thing, at least for me, but for a hop freak such as myself, they are still there. I don't think it said so on the label, but at 10 it's certainly it's a double. Also, it's clearly Belgian yeast, with some sour coming through. Anyway, I think the alcohol fits nicely, but I'm accustomed to drinking nines and tens anyway. All in all, I do like this beer. it's interesting – sometimes that's a curse I guess, but not here I think. If I had a complaint at all, it is that it's a little bit heavy on the citrus (disclaimer – I dislike citrus is in general). I would buy it again, though.","mobius024","Jun 29, 2014"

4.15,1.2,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"this is a very interesting brew, my second from nebraska brewing, and as impressive, if not more impressive, than the apricot saison. the pour in this is hazy and more yellow than golden. it has an inch or so of pure white wispy head that settles a bit, but is easily reproduced with a twirl of the glass. the nose is more wild yeast than Belgian yeast specifically, taking on some late summer farmy elements. the hops aren't as in my face as I expected them to be in a beer named hop god. they are tropical fruity and citric, but not hardly bitter at all, which allows the complexity of the yeast to fully develop on the palate. some fresh cut grass in here, and some drying straw, its definitely a summer drink. very active carbonation and only a light malt body give this beer a lot of life, and the fact that it is over 10% abv is almost impossible to detect. this was a real treat, many thanks to claystation for sharing it with me!

It was not overly sour as to dominate the taste, but it was certainly at the front. Notes of grapefruit, peach, and the hops were also evident. The peach comes out a little more in the aftertaste, with modest grapefruit, yields to a warming sensation on the back of the throat.

A - Pours a very nice deep gold color with a nice 1 inch head that is white and quite dense. The head recedes quickly down to a thin film and ring around the glass with a nice sticky lacing to it.

4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a blast of dry earthy hops up front that linger over the earthy oak and sweet fruit notes into a slightly dry, lingering finish.  Hints of pine needle as well as some prominent lemon citrus and apple flavor.  The barrel presence is pretty strong with notes of dry toasted oak and a powerful vinous white wine character. Lots of vinous grape and white wine which compliments the fruit from the hops and Belgian yeast.  Subtle alcohol but easy to drink with decently masked ABV.  Hops complimented by oak/barrel and citrus complimented by estery fruit notes.  Pretty good.  4","corby112","Oct 22, 2011"

3.73,-9,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"750 mL bottle shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a hazy brass color with a light-tan head. Aroma is pretty much pure chardonnay, not getting a lot of IPA or even beer character out of it. Big apple/pear, perfume and alcohol. Flavor is buttery oak up front, then a winey fruitiness, some round esters and yeastiness and a tannic, bitter finish. Comes together pretty nicely but it's not very recognizable as an IPA of any sort.","illidurit","Jul 24, 2011"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Shared this one with the group at the "Evening Wood" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The barrels on this one were not very pronounced if I am completely honest, which was kind of a disappointment... However, the flavor profile on this one was quite nice with the chardonnay coming across as a part of the fruit character in this one. I really enjoyed this one, just wish it wasn't so expensive...","thagr81us","Jul 21, 2011"
4.08,-0.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours out as a lightly hazy golden color. The head is pretty good on this beer despite the barrel aging. The smell of the beer is pretty interesting, it's god a good amount of hops on the nose but it also has a a lot of spicy and barrel aromas. The taste gives us the hops upfront with a nice floral and citrusy flavor. The bitterness sets in and then the barrel aging flavor give off a light tartness. The mouthfeel is about medium bodied, the decent carbonation. Overall the price of these beers kill me. I hate paying for an entire bottle of these because they're always more than $20. If the was was lower I could probably enjoy this a bit more. All in all though I like what they did with this beer and it did taste good.","Knapp85","Jul 04, 2011"

The nose comprises orange zest, coriander, banana, honeydew, and white grapes. The taste holds notes of mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, melon, clove, banana peel, red grapes, and light oak. A sharp bitterness bites at the back o' the tongue. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice BIPA, definitely something to experience.","TMoney2591","Jun 29, 2011"

3.78,-7.8,4,3.5,4,3,4,"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy dirty blonde color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma is a complex mix between a dry hoppy Belgian ale with some sweet notes mix with some light tart vinous notes. Taste is quite complex with notes of sweet Belgian style malt with dry hoppy notes and light tart vinous notes. A bit lacking balanced with more vinous notes would have been better. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very interesting experience though maybe lacking a bit of balance.","Phyl21ca","Apr 07, 2011"

3.88,-5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a moderately-hazed orange-copper color with a nice white head and a bit of lacing as it falls.

Finish is quite bitter with some nice oak tannins filling things out. Medium body.

4.17,1.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer appears crystal clear and light orange in color. The head stands in at approximately an inch thick, and displays lasting retention. As the cap recedes it leaves a healthy dose of lacing on the glass. The aroma is really wonderful, with a lot of barrel scents coming through prominently. The flavor is very good, but not quite up to the level of the aroma. The taste is very tannic, as the wine barrels really shine through. The hop aspect is there, but is a bit overshadowed by the French Oak Chardonnay barrel. That being said, the beer is pretty well balanced, and surprisingly drinkable for what it is. Frankly, I did not expect to enjoy a barrel-aged IPA this much. The feel is medium bodied with a solid carbonation level. A blend of hops and barrels lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is complex and interesting, and I would certainly have it again. Best shared and / or enjoyed in small quantities.","Huhzubendah","Feb 12, 2011"
4,-2.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer is relatively thin and the finish is REALLY dry. At the finish there is some moderate hop bitterness but there is also a tannic quality to it. It's strong but not detracting. Overall, the wine comes through in this one slightly. It's a decent beer. The malt backbone probably could have stood out more as well as the hop bitterness but since we didnt' have the base beer I don't know if the original was more hop forward before the exposure to the wine barrel.","drabmuh","Feb 11, 2011"
3.87,-5.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I would say that the mouthfeel makes this beer surprisingly drinkable, especially since I found it to be a little bit boozy.

3.93,-4.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazed golden orange color with a plume of bone white froth, great retention and sticky lacing. Scent is of belgian yeasts, citrusy hops and hints of peppry spice, vanilla, dry chardonay and oak. First sip brings a hard taste of belgian yeasts and alcohol, smooths into a pleasent citrusy and tropical hop note, as the malt begins to present itself, the flavors of peppery spice, dry chardonay and oak steal the finnish. Medoim bodied, active carbonation, very dry. An interesting beer that is definitely as advertised, would have like the alcohol and belgian yeast flavors toned down a bit (as in Raging Bitch and Cali-Belgique) so the other flavors have a little more time to shine.","rfgetz","Jan 27, 2011"

4.2,2.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A hoppy Belgian in a chardonnay barrel ... look at where beer has gone. This beer's epic head sticks all over the glass as its weathered golden color shows a perfect clarity. Tartness from the barrel, spice from the alcohol and slightly pungent hops make for a very complex nose. Smooth and creamy, the hops jump in with some bitterness and late-to-the-game flavor that lingers. The alcohol is spicy with a hint of tropical fruit. Wood and wine flavors are prevalent from middle to end. This brew's maltiness is thick and bready. Some damn tasty beer ... and dangerously drinkable for its size.","BeerAdvocate","Jan 10, 2011"

Flavor is sweet and fruity at first and then melds into a pulpy orange finish like you just took a bite out of an orange and got some pulp and rind with it. Lots of woodsy notes as well, which reminds me a lot of Fred from the Wood. I can't say I really got the Chardonnay; it just blended with the citrusy, fruity notes. Quite tasty overall, very impressive coming from a brewery I hadn't heard of before.","LilBeerDoctor","Dec 23, 2010"

4.03,-1.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a murky golden orange color with a fantastic tight white head that left lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is tart and wine like due to the barrel aging. Fermented apple skins, lemon and oak dominate the aroma. The flavor follows the aroma, tart apple skins which melts into a slightly sweet pale malt, nice subtle oak flavors play very well with the rest of the beer. I can detect the Belgian candi sugar but most of the hops and yeasty goodness is hidden by the oak. That being said the sourness and sweetness come together well. A moderate feel with good carbonation, again the sweet and sour balance each other out on the palate. Perhaps a light grassy hop pops through towards the end. I'd probably like to see more yeasty flavor and a touch more hops but the flavors are quite good and mellow. Its different and its good.","Gmann","Mar 27, 2010"
