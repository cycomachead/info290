4.41,16.4,4,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tramp Stamp has a glimmering look of golden copper, topped with a tall, fizzy white head. A deliciously sweet aroma delights my nose with apricot, grapefruit, and honeysuckle aspects to it. The flavor ultimately boils down to exactly what it sets out to achieve: an accessible and harmonious marriage of an American IPA and a Belgian Golden Ale. I never thought it could be possible to make hallmarks of a Belgian beer for the general beer lover. I have always imagined myself as unique in falling in love with strong flavors of Belgian yeast and fruit esters as a gateway to good beer. It seems like an acquired taste, second to the more approachable IPAs. But this beer combines the two effortlessly, and it goes down nice and easy. I see this as being a huge hit at bars and parties for all demographics in the beer world!","Neorebel","Feb 18, 2015"

Darker than its double IPA stablemate Galactica but similar in the pungent hops department. Aroma and palate redolent with orange and lemon rind/juice, menthol cough candy, fennel seed/licorice cake, dry dusty burlap sack, turmeric, green bananas, pumpkin, fresh cut grass, yeasty vitamin tablet, and dandelion. I must say, this is one of those brews that truly strikes the balance between American hops and Belgian funk ... The Belgian yeast is aggressive but the hops keep pace admirably. Very dry, bitter, earthy, and spicy, equal parts apothecary's cabinet and citrus orchard. Finishes with ample pine resin like a strong American IPA. Moderate of body and quite highly carbonated, which is maybe not a selling point. Regardless, I am converted. Could be my favorite Clown Shoes to date.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 06, 2014"

S: Citrus like smell. I get a slight sour smell almost hidden. T: Slight grapefruit. Not too bitter for an ipa. Get a little of that Belgian yeast taste, enough to let you know it's there, but not overpowering. Tastes like it smells. M: A slight spice feel to it. Little bit of sour near the end that lingers on the tongue. On the dry side. O: Not bad at all. This style is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Worth a sixer for sure, interesting name and label.","crbnfbr","Jul 28, 2014"

Bright, vibrant orange colored liquid, inclines more to red-brown than yellow, very clear and crisp looking, you see a fat bubble here or there. From a distance the nose is powerfully floral yet as you get closer more dominance in the well cooked bread dough, herbaceousness, sharper spices and pepper, moderate pine sap and likewise the peach, nectarine scents are quiet, takes a little opening up but there is a decent bubblegum component. Medium-bodied plus, foams up some in the mouth, carbonation big rather than prickly. As a result, it sits there and slowly percolates rather than flows. Spicy attack, ginger, cardamom, caraway then spiced orange peel, not getting a consistent yeast presence. Here too the peach, apricot, pear, apple flavors have minimal thrust, ending up in a drier texture. The bitterness not fully to be pinned on the herbaceousness, more like sour grains. Pine more present, the bubblegum to banana notes mostly retronasal than perceived as flavor. It’s actually pretty good and can easily be understood as a smashup of two styles.","farrago","May 10, 2014"

This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not filling, a little refreshing, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these especially on a nice summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance they were both pretty good with the aroma being my favorite. What I liked the least about this beer was that the hop profile in the aroma wasn't more similar to the taste. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for this style, it does a good job of representing the style and I enjoyed it, I would recommend to anyone who likes Belgian IPA's. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer and it made for a good first impression of Clown Shoes, it was just an all around nice beer and I will for sure be checking out more of their beers, good job guys this is a pretty enjoyable beer.","StoutHunter","Jul 25, 2013"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, unreadable bottle date code. Pours very hazy deep orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, floral, light pine, caramel, biscuit, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Light pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian IPA! All around nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

This one looked like the top of a soft-serve vanilla ice cream cone by the time that I was done. Tawny, rocky and with great retention, it really slowed me down. Fall, dang you! Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose had a bitter, citrusy mustiness, as though they had commingled all of the ingredients above so as not to overwhelm one or the other. I call it a) truth in advertising and b) just what I like. I am tiring of hearing people that do not like hoppy, bitter IPAs moan about the current dearth of malty beers. Yo, hops is what sells, currently! Move on. This was nice. Mouthfeel was medium, but the taste was superb. It had a tea-like characteristic that reminded me of orange pekoe. Orange and black powder, plus must. Wow. I remember my Pops' one-skillet Chun King meals with orange pekoe tea when I was a child and this really took me back. Man, but Pops could cook. I was totally inspired by him in high school and took four semesters of HomeEc (Foods). Finish was semi-dry, offset by the sweet orange peel and if you think that I could not perceive it, think again! I remember that one of the criteria for Overall asked if you got your $'s worth. In this case, for six bone for a bomber, the answer is ""Hell, yeah!"".","woodychandler","Feb 17, 2013"

This is a Belgian-style IPA, but it just doesn't handle the synthesis of the spiced fruit hop notes with the malts in a good fashion. Instead, you get a bit of a mish-mash of the two fighting against each other for a bit of an undefined taste. Finishes pretty smooth with a bit of coffee-ish malts on the back. A medium body and low carbonation make this quite nice. Note: As this warmed up, the clovish spices coalesced with the malts in a much more unified way and gave rise to a much better taste. Serve this slightly above the recommended 40-45 degrees F for maximum taste. Tasty, but nothing exemplary.","Tomhet","Jan 04, 2013"
4.15,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Now this is much more in tune with my preferences than Muffin Top was. It's a straightforward Belgian IPA with good sweetness-bitter-yeast phenol three way balance right in my personal sweet spot. If anything, I'm only really disappointed by the slight lightness of body, and I'm being rather nitpicky about that. The head could also be a bit more stable. But it's got a great sense of just the right amount of herbal / pine / citrus hopping and phenols to accent a nice bready caramel malt into something better than most of the usual domestically produced BIPAs for sale in my local market. Absolutely no boozey burn, either. Check this one out if you can.","WastingFreetime","Dec 29, 2012"

I love this style and the breweries that do it right. Clown shoes does this style right. This is in my personal Top 5, maybe Top 3 of Belgian IPAs. It has a nice balance of juicy, citric, fruity hops and doughy, bready belgian yeastiness. Nice little accent of belgian yeast spice as well. Nicely carbonated and medium-full body. 2nd beer from Clown Shoes. 2nd winner.","Bighuge","Oct 09, 2012"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a hazy medium caramel amber. One finger fine off-white head with decent retention and good lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, orange, sweet malt and faint coriander. Flavor is sweet malt, pine and citrus hops, orange. Finishes with lingering citrus and hop notes. Belgian spicing is faint and overwhelmed by the IPA character, but the hop and malt combination hold their own. The Belgian elements are subdued, but do give this an interesting off-beat flavor that works well. Medium bodied with some creaminess, mouth feel is enhanced by active carbonation. An interesting take on a Belgian IPA. The labelling didn't bode well for a serious Belgian IPA, but the contents worked out well.","LiquidAmber","Jul 22, 2012"

3.53,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This is a weird one, the Belgian characteristics are kind of weak, but the are present in sufficient quantity to really screw with the hop profile. The yeast flavors are harsh and excessively phenolic which only serves to highlight the harshness of the hops and really clashes with the pine and grapefruit notes. To me, this is a perfect example of why so many people seem to dislike Belgian IPAs, no thought put into how the hops and yeast work together and an apparent lack of understanding of how to deal with Belgian yeast. You shouldn't try brewing a Belgian IPA unless you are already capable of brewing a very good tripel.","nickfl","Jun 21, 2012"

I'm keeping the bottle. Nice rich amber appearance, great head retention. Pretty good yeasty citrus smell. The taste is good too; once you get past the stinging hops, which try to overpower things a little, there is a nice undercurrent of flavors normally associated with a wheat beer - banana, clove, yeast, etc. On account of this, it feels and tastes great in the mouth, but once you down it, the hops come back with a vengeance. Nevertheless, I enjoy and recommend this - look forward to trying more Clown Shoes stuff.","angusdegraosta","Jan 28, 2012"

The grassy piney hop flavor comes across sharp as knives (or tattoo needles?)—in my notes I wrote sharp three times—but it’s matched by a floral hoppiness from the Belgian yeasty esters.

A thinnish, light body, goes down smooth, the citric hops along w/ spice are prevelant and quite tasty. However, the Belgian yeast strain and orange notes, as well as some candi sugar sweetness typical in Belgians are minimal yet I still pick up a touch of tart/plush fruit that is typical of some light Belgians. This is more IPA than Belgian with some of the sweetness muted but still a good balance.

Getting some citrus and pine hop notes. Also some spiciness and maybe even a faint breadiness to it. The taste is quite good. Hops are there, but not overdone. Citrus and pine. Some spiciness, but faint. Also just a bit of the breadiness that you get from the Belgian yeasts, but ever so slight. This is a nice beer!","Boto","Aug 25, 2011"
4.1,8.2,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, what we found most interesting about this brew was how much it felt like a wheat beer.

The nose is dominated by a nice Belgian yeast with sweet undertones, some citrus perhaps, and finishes with an ultimately light hop characteristic. It smells just like I like my Belgian IPAs. It tastes of sweet banana-esque yeast with a nice hoppy bitterness, accompanied by a moderate amount of spice. It has really nice flavor and is a lot more bitter and dry than I anticipated. It's right on point for how I like the style. It drinks pretty smoothly and is in between light and medium in body. Overall I'm a big fan of this one. It may have catapulted itself right behind Stone's Cali-Belgique to be one of my all-time top Belgian IPAs. Well done Clown Shoes.","aasher","Aug 22, 2011"

I hadn't read the description of the beer on here or on the bottle prior to drinking this. It poured a beautiful, largely translucent/opaque orange with a decent head, accompanied by an abundance of lacing that has some real staying power. Beautiful beautiful hop aroma on the approach. When I got my first taste, the first thing I though was ""Saison with a strong hop profile."" Well, it's not a saison, but the hops are front and center. Wonderful citrusy, piney, grapefruity taste, with a nice light mouthfeel. I love this beer. I'm glad I was able to procure some of this in a couple trades. Wish it was distributed to Philly.

The yeast esters are present and add a nice dry finish with a some added fruitiness. There is a touch of orange peel character as well. The mouthfeel is fine.

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Good example of the style, and very drinkable. Well balanced between the significant and tasty orange citrus Simcoe hops and the witbier yeastiness clinging in the secondary. Elevated bitterness by the two C-hops. Cloudy orangey body with lasting quarter inch of head. Thanks Dr. Jay for including this among five Clown Shoes intro package. 650 ml. bottle with a PG picture.","Sammy","Apr 30, 2011"
4.38,15.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Overall this is a well put together Belgian Ipa, the flavors work well together. definitly would have this again.","InebriatedJoker","Apr 30, 2011"
4.03,6.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"True yeast flavors are right up front on the initial taste. I cannot really detect any malt because the strong bittering (peppery) hop. The body is as one would expect, with a higher-than-average carbonation level. In summary, a decent cross between an American IPA and a Belgian one.","smcolw","Apr 29, 2011"
4.5,18.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall a very nice belgian IPA. Not overpowering bitterness, almost in balance, with complementary fruity esters from the yeast.","JamnesCameron","Apr 26, 2011"
3.81,0.5,5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured a 2"" head which dissipated quicker than average. Absolutely lovely orange apricot color held up to the light. Smell of hops and citrus. Taste has a hint of orange peel and lots of hop bitterness. Moderate body build to it, and a moderate length finish. So let's see, ""Belgian IPA""? Yep, Belgian body and finish, and IPA hoppiness. But I'd call it good but not great. I don't think these were the same hops in a lot of other IPAs I've liked.","MoreThanWine","Apr 25, 2011"
3.16,-16.6,2.5,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall, this one has all the characteristics of a Belgian IPA but they seem to be out of whack. The hops are a bit weak and really don't mesh well when the do come through. The spice characteristics are a bit strong - not overwhelming but they take over at times when they are probably best served as complimentary flavors. This is a beer that wants to be could and probably can be with a little tweaking but the flavors are just a bit off right now.","ms11781","Apr 23, 2011"
3.91,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O: Good beer, this definitely is more on the edge of a 'belgian' style as opposed to the 'american ipa' side of the belgian ipa.","Dreadnaught33","Apr 10, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall not bad, the finish with the astringency gets a bit overbearing, decent flavors, bit too much on the sweetness and overall gravity I think.","jlindros","Apr 09, 2011"
4.62,21.9,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"What makes this beer a stand-out is its balance of light/heavy and bright/dark flavors. There are a lot of craft beers out there that taste like the brewer wanted to see how much of all kinds of flavors could be packed into the bottle. In other words, if a little is good, more is is better. By contrast, Tramp Stamp has power, but is light on its feet and almost elegant, allowing your palate to taste the subtleties rather than being overwhelmed by heaviness.","jakorpi","Apr 08, 2011"
3.78,-0.3,3.5,3,4,4.5,4,"Very drinkable, very pleasant - I think this is a solid example of the style. I haven't given this brewery the props it deserves. I mean it's hard to take Clown Shoes seriously but I'd be happy to drink this one again though wouldn't go out of my way for it.","OldIronLungs","Apr 07, 2011"
3.33,-12.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D - This is pretty mediocre. It's largely inoffensive, other than the strange finish, but it's not something I'd want to try again unless it was fresh off the line or on-tap somewhere.","MasterSki","Apr 07, 2011"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"overall this one was a sleeper hit for me. i tend to overlook american takes on belgian styles as i typically find myself decidely underwhelmed. but this offering definitely holds its own.","perrymarcus","Mar 28, 2011"
4.57,20.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"overall a more then solid offering here and something i grately look forward to be able to try again.","mikesgroove","Mar 27, 2011"
4.47,17.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Very tasty with good complexity, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely one of the better Belgian IPA's that I've had.","TheManiacalOne","Mar 21, 2011"
4.65,22.7,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Appearance is orange, hazy, with a thick cap that leaves rings of lace. It smells of oranges and fresh bread. The taste is very complex, with orange rind, bitter hops, barely noticeable alcohol, and a juicy citrus finish. This beer is terrific.","wburch1967","Mar 21, 2011"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"O - This is a case where the overall outweighs the individual components for me. I have to admint that I've been loving the Americanized Belgian IPA style - definitely becoming one of my favorites. This one has quite a bit going on - lots of flavor nuances, lots of character...I'm gonna be going back to this one frequently I think.","portia99","Mar 18, 2011"
3.78,-0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Drinkability was where this beer seemed to falter. Belgian IPAs are typically a nice marriage of phenolic, powdery yeastiness and slight candi sweetness (the Belgian part) and crisp, grassy, noble hops (the IPA part). This beer however reminded me more of dry, bitter, West Coast-style IPA. I really would have liked to see more of that typical Belgian character come through.","Damian","Mar 05, 2011"
4.06,7.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D - This, like pretty much every Clown Shoes, is just delicious. Really great appearance, solid flavor profile, and a great mouthfeel. Definately would buy again.","rudzud","Mar 01, 2011"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"D = Well crafted IPA. Being familiar with Clown Shoes Clemintine, I expected a stronger taste of citrus in this IPA. What I got from the orange peel, was a stronger taste of the orange peel pith. Which did work, but not what I expected.","getgetgettleman","Feb 26, 2011"
4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Well done, complex and simply delicious take on an exciting and pleasing style.","Billolick","Feb 23, 2011"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Feels tart deliciously hoppy with all the flavors masking the 7%. This one actually caught me a little off guard. Overall a terrific brew.","Fluke828","Feb 23, 2011"
3.82,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Canary Sq. in JP. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark orange color, with a small white head. Smell had a fresh aroma of hops to it. Flavor was really loaded with citrusy hops. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a bit of sweetness, but then a bit dry at the end. Alcohol was hidden well for a 7% beer. Nice overall flavor and body, so I'd have one again sometime.","morebeergood","Feb 21, 2011"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Crystal clear orange colour with a half inch cap of fine beige foam. Sticky, spotty lace, good head retention. Nice aroma, fruity and bready, orange and citrus, banana, hint of bubblegum and cloves. Sturdy bitterness was backed up by bready and toasty malt, some sugary sweetness, citrus and spice. Light alcohol notes were apparent in the finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, light dryness, nice texture. I liked this one.","DrJay","Feb 18, 2011"
4.35,14.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is just a great beer. Aroma of hops and a hint of oranges. A great blend of clean crisp hoppy bitterness with an ever lingering sweet orange/lemon flavor. Each sip is a new taste. The bitterness just plays really well off of the citrus hints. Alchohol is hidden very well, and makes this a Very easy drinker. Plus at 5.99 a bomber its a great deal.","Liverpool08","Feb 17, 2011"
4.55,20.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I had been trying some new brews this week, and the last few were let downs for me. Thankfully, this one pressed the reset button nicely. Very enjoyable, and great quality. I'll definitely seek it out again.","jbertsch","Feb 17, 2011"
3.22,-15,5,3,3,4,3,"Drinkability is OK. I almost gave up on my bomber at one point, but the warming mellowed everything out to just plain OK, and I managed to finish. Decent, unspectacular offering from a cutting-edge brewery.","stonermouse","Feb 11, 2011"
3.09,-18.5,4.5,3,3,4,2.5,"T - Good. Not as bitter as some members of the style, like Houblon Chouffe. Some of the complexity more associated with Belgian pale ales, ie Bruges Zot","joehiatt","Feb 11, 2011"
4.32,14,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I would definitely recommend this beer. Another good job by Clown Shoes.","Chincino","Feb 07, 2011"
4.72,24.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"D: You really don't taste the 7% at all.","BenjieK","Feb 06, 2011"
3.93,3.7,4.5,4,4,3,4,"D - This is a very drinkable beer and the 7% abv. is hidden pretty well...however there are definitely better beers of this style out there.","BeerMaverick","Feb 04, 2011"
4.5,18.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The feel of this beer is complex but medium is size, the scope is not too big to handle but is well layered for most beer enthusiast tastes. It has a smooth finish that is quite refreshing going down.","Duhast500","Feb 01, 2011"
4.57,20.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Another very impressive effort by Clown Shoes, now one of my favorite breweries. The beer is orange with a big thick head. The smell is yeast, citrus, and hops, my god it smells good! The taste was a balance of sweet and bitter hops with a gorgeous backbone of oranges and soft malts. Super duper drinkable!","BeerMusketeer","Jan 25, 2011"
4.92,29.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"This is most definitely a beer that I will purchase again. It is something that instantly struck me as perfect for Asian cuisine and I will be making that pairing very soon. Cheers!","ambluhm","Jan 19, 2011"
4.17,10,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer grew on me as I worked through the glass. Another nice effort by Clown Shoes.","Reagan1984","Jan 15, 2011"
4.12,8.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This is one serious Belgian IPA. Dial back the bitterness, up the finishing hops, and you'de have a block buster.","brewandbbq","Jan 15, 2011"
