"Horrible tin-can metallic smell and somewhat taste, despite coming from a bottle."

"The hops are dominant in the aroma, a mixture of floral and grass accents. It pours a nice golden beer, with a white head that vanishes rapidly. The hops dominate the taste, which makes it a medium bitter beer. The texture of the beer is thin, and the initial hop accents are completely absent in the finishing.  Overall a nice beer, which tastes better if you drink it slightly warmer than the recommended serving temperature."

"Not a fan of the smell or taste."

"05/01/13 At Rattle N Hum, NYC. On tap. As a huge Unibroue Fin du Monde fan I like this very much. Lacks the bready Unibroue yeast, but that just adds to the mystery. If it wasn't for the 8.3% ABV I could drink this all day in any season. Love it."

"Hits you with a lot of complex flavors. Fruity but not overly sweet. Nice carbonation, peppery finish. Fairly bitter but not overpowering. Overall a very enjoyable beer, drinkable but complex."

"Belgian golden strong ale -brewed with 5 different hop varietals for complex flavor and refined body. Strong, bitter, blonde. The created for the brewers'  wedding celebration. So tasty!"
""
"From large corked bottle, clear light gold with good retention on creamy white head. Smell is dry and grassy, some fruity cherries, a bit spicy with some yeasty character over a firm malt base. Taste is fruity but also distinctly yeasty and mild kilned Belgian malts, toasty with some dry bitterness. Hops aren't very lively, grassy and earthy. Not bad but not an outstandingly complex beer."

"This is not a beer for me, but still I can apreciate the experience. If you like bitter, this might be the beer for you."
""
"There's nothing sacred about definition. You can define any style for your own purpose provided you do so clearly and unambiguously. In the case of Belgian IPAs - distinguished by their use of Belgian yeast strains - I think it's pretty self-explanatory what to expect. Hopus is a good example of the style but far from the best."

"O: I quite enjoyed this beer. I like the bitter finish and I found it incredibly easy to drink. To me the idea of a Belgian IPA is confusing, perhaps this is a BSPA. I'm glad I picked up a couple of bottles, I will enjoy it again."
"Overall - A little unrefined at times and a touch medicinal, but still a pretty solid beer. Not something I'd pick up again though, something about it just tastes a little home brew-ish.. far too many other beers available to come back to this one."
""
""
"Overall this is certainly one of the more bitter beers from Belgium I've tried. That being said the focus still seems a bit heavy on the malt flavors, which do make for a quality beer."
"Enjoy"
"Overall - A passable Belgian IPA, but this to me is more of a Belgian Pale Ale, than a Belgian IPA. Still worth a try while quantities last"

"d: a decent beer (although it is a little overpriced), could use a little less sweetness i think and some more complex balance - good though, but an also ran for beers in the style."

"The beer was poured from the bottle into a glass. Lots of carbonation visible. The beer looks okay, like a bit yellow-orange. The smell is awesome, very rich, with lots of hints of spices. The taste was a bit disappointing, not very rich and a bit too bitter for my taste. The mouthfeel was good, when the beer warms up a bit, if you don't swallow too quickly, the taste becomes more complex. Overall, not a bad beer."

"O: With its aromas and flavors of candi sugars, I thought that this beer shared a lot of similarities with a dubbel, except that it also had some spices and bitterness."
""
""
""
"M&O: the mouthfeel is kept smooth, creamy and consistently finely carbonated, the body comes full but not heavy, while the spicy-yeasty feel and hop bitterness plus resins combine to deliver an altogether chewy feel. Hoppy as it tries to be, the estery elements in the beer still play a very important role, esp. on the nose, while on the palate the hop elements add more complexity and enjoyment, esp. in the aftertaste where yeasts and hops converge to deliver a palate ideal for anyone who appreciates Belgian yeasty magic and hop consolidation at the same time. Personally, I think this is a nicely hoppy Belgian ale with a decent balance and evolving flavour profile to savour. If fixed at a lower gravity, this beer could’ve been even quaffable."

"Overall not very good, seems like some off flavors, and not very hoppy for a beer called ""hopus""."
"Pours a murky dark orange-brown with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grape juice, spice, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour grape juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that displays more fruit and spice aromas and flavors over any sort of hop presence this beer is supposed to have."

"Overall, maybe I misinterpreted the name, along with the phrase ""5 sorts of hops"" and in my head I had it as something very hoppy, surely above average. At the end, it was a very nice beer, a typical example of a Belgian Ale. Very good, very easily drinkable, especially since the alcohol is just a tiny bit traceable, and very tasty."

"Tasty and well-crafted. It certainly isn't a Belgian IPA - more of a strong pale ale. Although the hops are a tad more distinctive compared with your typical Belgian beer, they are grassy and herbal while adding a delicate bitterness. Hopus is no hop bomb. With that said, it has a balanced yeasty character fleshed out with a hint of sweetness and some serious booze. Perfect for appreciating the relative subtleties of Belgian brewing - it goes down nicely. Worth sampling if you chance across it."

"Bottle: Poured a dirty beige color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of dry hoppy notes with a light Belgian style malt backbone. Taste is a solid mix between some hoppy dry herbal notes with some floral notes sustain by a solid Belgian-style malt backbone with limited sweetness. Body is quite full with great bottle conditioning and no apparent alcohol. I really enjoyed this one and I really liked the dry floral and herbal notes coming from the hops."

"O/ an ale from Belgium to revisit again. Easy to drink and with personality."

"O- Are they hyping the hops to appeal to an American market dominated by IPA's? This is a Belgian beer all the way and a great one at that."
""

""

"Overall (4.0): This is a pretty good beer, and pieces of it were great. It is not, however, a Belgian IPA, so much as a notably hoppy, somewhat farmhouse-y strong pale. Which, I dig—I love all of those elements, actually. It doesn’t quite pop with this one (I think De Graal Triverius nails that particular profile), but I enjoyed it all the same and this is a solid beer, for sure."
""
"even though it was slightly off, it had enough sweet malts and mild hops to help pull through the whole glass i'd like to try this one fresh."
""
""
"none of the belgian india pale ales are really hoppy in the american sense, but this one has some tang to it. pours a little hazy bright golden color with a ton of carbonation and lasting head. smells like bready yeast, english caramel malts in a refined form, and something more than kent goldings on the hop front. not a beast, but a bigger on the hop belgian. the booze is absent in the taste, which is surprising. you can really feel it. the flavor is the same as the nose, with a crisp aftertaste. great feel, bright bubbles and cold clean finish. not my favorite belgian, but a nice take on this style and a beer i will definitely drink again here in europe. this is as hoppy as ive been able to find in eastern europe."
"For $5 & 11.2 oz, pass on this one. There are better belgians for less than a sawbuck per..."
"Did someone mention hops??"
""
"O: Good drinkability. Good Belgian IPA"
""
""
""
"Balanced, for the style, with a good yeast that holds it up."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy medium orange amber. Thick, long lasting white head and massive lacing. Sweet malt, light fruit and Belgian spicing; faint hops. Taste is light fruit, apples and light citrus, very little malt presence, very small hop bite in the somewhat dry, fruity finish. A pleasant, but subdued ale. Nothing really stands out and there certainly should be more hops in an IPA. This is a decent Belgian strong pale ale with a tame, but pleasant flavor progression."
""
"Poured from brown swing top 330mL bottle to Duvel tulip. Bottle reads best before end: L20130809. The beer pours a cloudy dark golden color with a nice 2 finger white head. Excellent retention and some lacing. The nose is peculiar yet nice, blends of belgian yeast, hints of dark fruit, almost wild character. The flavor is equally distinct, mild caramel malt base provides a mild sweetness from which the light belgian yeast builds. Hints of banana and apples. Mildly bitter, more fruity. Finishes with a hint of tart. Odd flavor for a Belgian IPA, but not bad at all. Medium bodied and carbonated the beer finishes dry yet smooth. Overall, an interesting beer. Not as hoppy as I expected though pleasant."

"O- A great beer that im glad I took the chance and grabbed one out of the blue. I definitely would have scored it higher had the pour not been so disgusting. maybe I just got a bad one but it sure didn't hurt the taste!"

"O: This is a very nice ale that is neither too hoppy nor too sweet, too dry nor too slick, too strong nor too weak. A very admirable effort from Lefebvre."
"Overall: reasonable, commercialized beer. Okay but not impressive."
"Great beer! Served with a big, foamy, frothy, fluffy, off white head that is long lasting and clumpy lace. Color was a clear, dark, gold amber. Nose is malt, grain, leather, yeast, sweat. Flavor has bitterness stand out and sweetness is almost gone to the point of dryness. Not much flavor or aroma hop. Malt flavor is subdued, but unmalted grain is there, plus grass. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is long and a little warm. I'd like another, please."
"Still, my first belgian 'IPA'."
"M: very nice"
"Poured out as a nice hazy golden color with w decent looking head on top. The head was a little sticky and left a pretty good lacing for a while. The smell of this beer is earthy, yeasty and a little hoppy. The hops don't jump out at you too much on this one. The taste has a nice spicy hop flavor to it, along with some nice Belgian Tripel flavors too. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth and seems to be well balances in my opinion. Overall I like it, it's not my favorite Belgian IPA but I did enjoy trying it."
"It doesn't have too strong of a finish, so it's quite nice. I'll drink this again if I happened to have a chance. The only drawback is it's a bit more pricey than I'm accustomed to. (or did the bar overcharge me?)"
"O: Decent Belgian IPA. Has a nice balanced flavor and aroma."
"O: reminds me of a saison / farmhouse ale"
"O: This was a total blind buy for my first purchase in Belgium. I tired finding something a similar to what I'm used to back home in Seattle before branching out. Nice combination of a Belgian ale with citrus and pine hop flavor from a typical IPA."
"O - my friend picked this one out for me when he came to a bottle shop with me, im pretty sure the swing top had some influence. this brew is not bad and surprising while lacking the pleasant part, more hops are needed for sure, lose some sweet fruit or add some malt but other than that not bad. i feel it could be enjoyed more with a very sharp cheese that doesn't fuck around. worth a shot, rather sure i will never have this again."
"A decent beer, but not one of the better Belgian IPA's I've had frankly."
"M-good body, decent carbonation"
"Nothing to write home about...similar to, ""homebrew pride," in it's flavours."
"Not one of my favorites, but fairly drinkable."
"One was enough."
"Taste is mildly bitter with a faint cidery note in the background; lemony and vaguely spicy with a nice earthy hops presence."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a rocky off white head. In the aroam, English/ gingerbread like maltiness and faint pine hops. In the taste, dry yeast, dry pine hops and a bit boozy. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine and alcohol like aftertaste. Too boozy, small hops, but not enough for balance. Eh! A little hairspray like too."
"Overall an enjoyable Belgian Pale Ale which I will seek out as I make purchases at home."
"Golden hazy colour. With an amazing hughe head. But you smell it, and it´s like a alcoholic golden pale ale...where are the hops?...some alcoholic, and yeast notes in mouth, and some light hops, not bitter flavour, not complex...just a little bit in the finish, but it tastes malty, grasy and alcoholic...It seems a try of a handcrafted IPA, but I think it´s not-. I think it´´s not an IPA at all."
"Hopus is a very dry beer and incredibly creamy. Nothing at all to complain about. I'm thoroughly enjoying this beer, and I wish I had more. This comes highly recommended if you're a fan of the style, although I'd stay away if you're shy when it comes to bitter beers."
"Side note: The initial head required me to make two pours. The second pour was extremely cloudy from the yeast sediment in the bottle. Interestingly, the flavor really didn't change dramatically."
"Good enjoyable and drinkable beer, the 8.3% abv is unsung and not too ferocious to interrupt the drink."
"This is a really nice example of the style although I would like a little more of a hop presence. Drinks well and I would pick this one up again."
"Drinkability is OK. Not really a Belgian IPA to this tongue."
"Mouthfeel is very tingly, as there is lots of carbonation, and this affects drinkability too, as having too much of this at one time just overwhelms the palate with all the bubbles. As a sipper though, this is more than passable, and a tasty beverage with the food I was having (greasy pizza)."
"Pours a nice white frothy head that lingers awhile. Color is a cloudy amber and not very appealing. This beer is a little too bitter for my taste. There is the sweet apple Belgian ale taste - very carbonated and I don't think the hoppy bitterness mixes well. I much prefer an Urthel or Piraat of the same style. This is not a terrible beer, but I would not buy again."
"D: Nice everyday beer. I think you cannot get bored with it."
"330 mL stubby Belgian swing-top bottle with no freshness date. This ""hop opus"" is brewed with five hops to celebrate the ""yield of the harvest and the work of the brewer."" It pours clear gold, with a good amount of carbonation and a very big head that leaves lots of clumpy lace. A touch of hops and sweet malts in the nose, but there is an odd, vegetal aroma in there that is pretty offensive. The flavor yields pale malt, spicy/floral hops that contribute a soft bitterness, skunk?, a bit of alcohol, and lightly fruity, chalky yeast on top of a crisp, highly-carbonated body that has a bitter linger. It isn't too bad, but there is something wrong with the bouquet. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this one."
"This is a nice sweet dessert type of brew. It smells very similar to how it tastes. I think it would make a great xmas beer."
"With a name like Hopus, well, you expect a big ol' hop punch. Something like De Ranke's XX bitter. This here, it turns out, is just a strong, blonde Belgian IPA with a back end that's a little hoppier than average."
"This beer is certainly interesting... I can't think of another beer that I could compare to this one. Not my favourite Belgian IPA but I would definitely consider giving it another go in the future."
"D - Very drinkable and sessionable with a well hidden 8.3% but may be less approchable to some due to the bitterness. (4.5)"
"For some reason, I feel this tart and bitter brew will go nicely with lemon tarts or bitter pineapple upside down cake."
"Meh. Kind of boring, frankly--there is just not enough punch, but being boring can be ok sometimes. It's just that the qualities are a little lacking."
"Carbonation should be higher."
"Overall a good Belgian IPA and well worth a try."
"Sort of like a Belgian IPA meets a Belgian sour. Fairly tasty, but not particularly inspiring."
"This brew doesn't really hide the alcohol but it's still good."
"D- This was a alright beer. Good drinkability on it along with a nice size makes it dangerous at times. A nice belgian style that should help be a gateway into the style."
"D= This is sort of a thanks but no thanks beer for me. I got a buddy who I introduced to beer and he really likes his hops so the name persuaded him here and he agreed this was a bust. This beer looked amazing in the glass and from there it let down."
"Beer is really sweet and only mildly hoppy. Its medium body and has a harsh mouthfeel, a little too carbed. It grows in bitterness overall. Its OK, but these Belgian IPAs need to focus and pick a style and go with it."
"Notes: Meh, decent. If you like key lime pie this might be up your alley. Don't know how much this goes for, but I suspect it's too much."
"Tasted from bottle at Lush West Town. Pours light golden brown witha huge frothy and rocky white head. Nose of Belgian yeast with some candy, brown sugar, and a hint of banana. Flavor is somewhat bready and somewhat brown sugar sweet with light hops on the finish. Body is medium with average carbonation and a medium plus finish that is at first brown sugar and then light hops bitterness. There is nothing overly exciting about this beer, but it is super drinkable and easy to enjoy."
"This brew pours a dark golden hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind very frothy two finger head that stays with heaps of lacing,the smell is a very strong mix of grassy,herbal hops and golden malts,it has nice well carbonated mouthfeel is very sessionable and like the name says th taste is very hoppy with a nice grassy,herbal,lemon zest taste to it which suprisingly from its name really only finishes moderately bitter on my palette and could easily drink as a session brew but you would have to be careful given its 8.3% which is so well hidden its not funny."
"Having said the foregoing, the cool bottle with the swivel top will likely work to hand bottle some growler left overs! So, buying this one wasn't a total waste."
"Creaminess of the beer is what sticks out the most. Hop flavor and bitterness are both there with an overabundance of sweet bread and milly grains. Too sweet for me and despite the bitterness, does not finish very dry. I think it is the hoppy-thick-doughy combination that does not set right with me. No mas para me."
"The nose is very hoppy with a mouth that plays on the same combination, that is to say the power of hops but it must be admitted that this is far from being fully successful. Indeed, the mouth is too syrupy and has a very herbal mouth which is much closer to the drug than the hoppy bitterness. The basic product marketing, the power hops, appears slightly truncated."
"Taste, definitively Euro. Lacking hops, bitterness wasn't attributable to hops. Alcohol pronounced more than anything. A lot of those fruit flavors in beer, while below the radar, just don't jive with my preferences (apple, white grape, clove)."
"11.2oz bottle into a very nice Hopus glass pours a hazy bubbly pale orange with a very frothy eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice blend of crisp Earthy citrus hops with a nice spice kick and slight fruit. The taste is citrus hops and sweet fruits blended nicely with a mild spice providing nice complexity. The beer is on the light side of medium with its alcohol well hidden. This is a great hoppy Belgian IPA, one I can certainly see myself purchasing again."
"Definitely modest for an 'IPA'."
"Pours a light straw-yellow colour with tons of head and lacing. Some hops and a funky smell, in a good way. The flavour has a certain element of, what I can only describe as, salty. Has a tartiness to it as well. Carbonation level is great with this. An interesting Belgian IPA."
"Overall this is a nice, fairly light yet complex and mildly tart blonde ale. I found it to be balanced, aromatic and quite nice. It is a bit thin for my taste but I enjoyed drinking it."
"A nice blond with some hoppiness, but nothing extraordinaire. Funky yeasty aromas. Very yellow body with some significant white head. Lacey. A tad below average mouthfeel for the style. Drinkable because of the mild spiciness, which I take as cinammon."
"Poured a swing-top into my glass and had a very tall white head with a clear, gold body. I was a bit let down by this beer after hearing good things from friends. There was an astringent alcohol taste for starters. Also, the hops were very mild, hardly bigger than a dry Belgian pale ale. The basic malts reminded me of Duvel - for the white grape, bready taste - but it didn't have the same rich yeast character. I don't know if this had too much aging or too little, or if there's something else going on, but I'd avoid this beer. There are simply better Belgians out there for your time and money."
"I first had one in Leuven and after sharing it the others in the fridge disappeared among patrons. In the US, they have been more difficult to get (see BeerSpy report). After traveling through Belgium for a week, and trying all the traditional Belgians, it was great to have this as a reminder of the American craft taste I was missing."
"D - A very soild brew to try."
"Overall a very solid little ale, nothing really out of the ordinary though. Maybe a bit fresher it would pack a better punch, but this one just hung back in the crowd."
"A very nice Belgian Ale that could benefit from less sweetness to taste but retaining the hop flavor while adding aggression to the bitterness."
"Probably a little sweet for the style but tasty nonetheless."
"D - Enjoyable sip after sip... Not at the head of the Belgian IPA class, but one I would welcome in my glass without hesitation in the future... Has some distinct Belgian Pale Ale and Tripel notes... A little more in the aroma category would go a long way..."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This goes down relatively easy, and is a pretty good example of the style. Not sure I'd buy this one again, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down. Interesting and worth trying."
"Overall the brew has a pretty quick finish, which is a pitty. A bit more body would make this excellent."
"This is one damn fine brew, it is too bad I have only seen it at one place. Gotta get it fresh too."
"A very good Belgian IPA, but I wonder why they just don't make them taste like American IPA's, which are so much better in my opinion."
"D - This is a nice brew. I am not sure that I would ever grab it over, say, the almighty Duvel."
"D: superdrinkable. smooth, no alcohol bite, this is only a bit bitter. ????"
"D - just kind of an average beer, really wasn't anything that made me want to do cartwheels, especially considering the price. It was ok for what it was, but if I want to drink a light Belgian ale that's easy on the palate, I'd rather get a sixer of Stella. Overall, I think I appreciated the glassware the beer was served in more than the beer itself."
"On a positive note it pairs well with a charcuterie plate..."
"Love it!"
"Pours a cloudy yellowish/light orange color boasting a huge white head. The beer seemingly wants to pop right out of this swingtop and into the glass. Nose has light malt and citrus hop aroma with a slight sulfur twang. The scent of this beer finishes quite sweet smelling. Taste is well balanced between malt and bready sweetness and slight bitter hops. Warm alcohol presence is felt through the finish. Light feel and highly carbonated. Very easy drinking. As it warms some alcohol comes out in the nose along with a bit of earthiness."
"Man, there's something about this one that I can't get enough of... There's nothing here that stands out individually but everything collectively blends together in a superb way...I love the way this one blends together and this ended up being one that I wish I had access to on a regular basis.. Splendid..."
"Drinkability is low here because of the % of alcohol here."
"D - This is a pretty good Belgian IPA. I had never seen one before so I had to order it. It was worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The beer's texture is relatively tame for a Belgian IPA, and within a few seconds in the mouth it smooths out completely to the point of being no match for the intense flavors. I elected to add the yeast in with the last pour, which changed the character substantially with regard to mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full. Some alcohol sting. Low to moderate carbonation, the beer released all of the carbonation in the giant head."
"I give bonus points for the swing-tops, which add to my homebrew supplies."
"pours a hazy straw -yellow color with a huge fluffy white head that did settle to a nice white ring with lot of sticky lacing.the smell was hops and citrus and clove and spice..the taste is bittersweet floral with resinous hops then some clove and spices with citrus and grass i get a sweet taste also with some lemon background..the mouthfeel is medium a little bitter on the tongue but it is an ipa..this on is just ok to me and to pricey for the 330ml bottle for me to buy again ..i will recommend to try it and you be the judge"
"D- a nice beer to kick back with in the summer but not so much in the colder months of the year. this would go easy with BBQ"
"O: very sweet with slightly rough alcohol, nice floral and spice but too sweet with rough alc, llemongrass not in taste (which is good)"
"This is very enjoyable. Not my favorite of the style, but something that is worth a try."
"Light body and lots of carbonation on the tongue. It's 8.5% and does not come through in the aroma or in the taste, pretty amazing really. I think the label will lead alot of us Americans to believe it will be more of a hopped up brew since we are so addicted to the hop. For a Belgian Ale, it's a little hoppy, but not overly. It's very drinkable, different, I might enjoy a few of these on a hot summer day, but definitely not one of my favorites for the style."
"D - I an really liking this beer this is an awesome blend of styles if you like Belgians and well balanced ipas this is a beer to seek out"
"D: It's O.K. I would say. Basically, it feels like a Belgian Pale Ale with some hops thrown in... but the hops changed the overall character of the beer very little."
"Bitter, hoppy slap to the palate up front, then softly faded back...gets milder, slightly sweetwhile retaining the hoppy flavor. Needs more body, and a bit more from the hops to compare to Poperings and the like."
"D: I was somewhat underwhelmed by this brew. Don't think I'll be seekig out again but it is not terrible."
"D: It's not offensive, it just lacks the Belgian IPA kick that I like. I'm glad I only bought one bottle."
"D: Best skipped, I think, although it's a few notches above a drainpour."
"Well, it was a great present, and certainly an interesting experience. However I won't seek this out again or recommend it to others. There are just too many better beers in the world."
"D-Well, hmmmm... This beer is very unique and interesting in every way, and mostly not in a good and pleasing way. I think it goes down well, but I would'nt ever buy this beer again. But I'm glad I tried it. hmmmm... I think it just doesn't have enough hops for me..."
"Really, a rather bland beer. I'd call it a generic Belgian blonde, not an IPA."
"mouthfeel and drinkability: this beer is very sessionable and would also be great for introducing some non beer advocates to different styles. it has a well masked high abv and a very complex flavor. some aspects of this beer i really dont like and others i do."
"Unusual bottle, its an 11.2 ouncer and its a swingtop...rinsed and will be a sauce dispenser of some sort in its next life...this one poured cloudy light tangarine. Sweeter nose with a moderate hony whiff. Pleasant enough Belgian pale, the hops seemed to be on the muted/subtle side, so not sure what makes this one an ""IPA"". Worth a try but nothing to get overly excited about."
"Very nice new beer, very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"D: I enjoyed the beer it is just way off style. The more belgian IPAs that I have the more I realize LaChouffe really did nail it down. This is good but stick to the Chouffe."
"Overall, this beer was lackluster. Packing no real punch. However, i'd gladly sip on 1 or 6. Its very drinkable."
"Not a hoppy beer like I was expecting. Big presentation with the beer glass and a separate shot glass for the sludge at the bottom. Average in my opinion though."
"D-I could drink it several times a week, if I could get my hands on it. I'm afraid that I will have to go back to the Belgium Online Beer store to get some more once these 6 are gone."
"Notes: Glad that I had this (what a great place Cambrinus is!) but I do not think that I will try this one again."
"A Strong Bitter Blond with bulky foam. A round Bitter taste with a hop finisch. Made from 5 different european Hops, the result is a fabulous beer with a unique combination of bitterness and aroma. Served in a beautiful glass and a little yeast glass."
"Beautiful and really unique beer - try this if you can."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong ale (triple ?)."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied (for a Belgian) and the carbonation was pretty high but softer than expected."
"Immensely drinkable despite it's 8.3%."
"I tried this as it was new on the menu of the local belgian bar in my girlfriend's town. Not bad, though I'm not sure I'd use the title of IPA to describe it. The hop taste is definitely more apparent than other Belgian beers, though compared to other Belgian IPA's, it seemed somewhat lacking. Everything about it was good, though I would like to see less sweet and more bitter. The appearance was great though, served in a tall, narrow, thick glass. Cloudy tan with a slight orange tint. The smell was not necessarily distinctive, though it did not detract in any way from the overall experience of the beer. All in all a good beer and definitely worth a try. I can't say it's a favorite, but like I said, pretty decent."
"Not hoppy enough to earn it's name (or style) but a pleasant strong blonde."
"In the bottle, on the great Tweede Paasdag tasting (a Belgian Hop-off in this inagural year) of 2009 -- bottle is more active and has a slight taste of licorice, which I did not appreciate. Stood up better than expected and a fine but different beer than some of the other competitors."
