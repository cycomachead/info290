"Cloudy yellow, nice head. Lots of bitterness throughout, not very appropriate for the style, pepper and yeast, hints of dried citrus zest, herbs, farmhouse. Rough mouthfeel. I'd have to pass on more than a sample of this."

"Bought at The Beer Cellar in Glen Ellyn as a roadie for the train to Chicago. Wish I had 2! Very tasty."

"En bouche: Les notes classique d'agrumes tels que le pamplemousse, le citron et l'orange sont plus présente toujours avec des notes de fruits jaunes a noyau qui la diffère de la plupart des IPA. Le clou et le poivre, ainsi que les notes funky sont présentes en bouche également. Une finale avec une amertume moyenne, herbacé avec un peu de sapinage résineux et une touche de ""dankness"". Quelle belle profondeur. C'est difficile de poser son verre."

"Modest head of about a finger’s depth, close to bone white, tightly woven but not especially longlasting, the lacing comes in broad streaks and sticks well. Light orange to yellow colored liquid, looks a touch a dilute, good deal of active bubbles within as well as a very fine particulate which lends it a semi-translucency. There is a raw graininess to the nose as well as peppery nature which keeps it on edge, however, plenty of pine, sweet citrus and floral notes for prettiness, cardamom and chamomile, peach and yellow fruit, fresh with good clarity to the parts. Medium-bodied, dry and zesty entry into the mouth, very floral and the spiciness more pronounced here, cumin, ginger and something close to tarragon, not sweeter spiciness. More orange to lemon citrus than grapefruit. The pine seems more knit in here. The carbonation is tight and not too aggressive. The apricot, peach, pear fruit light of touch without ever disappearing. Essence of violets left behind at the end, expansive floral lift continues. Too rich to be delicate but it is intelligently put together and subtly holds your attention."

"Long live the bold & brave at heart. FYI ""Derniere Volonte"" means ""last will"". I doubt this will be my last, but shall modify the paperwork. Codicil is not a prescription drug but it's use can re-mediate oversight. G'night."

"O: I tried Dieu du Ciel for the first time when I was in Quebec. I had Chaman and I absolutely love it. Dernière Volonté is a great brew. (4)"
""
"Not impressed.   The concept of a “Belgium IPA” seems makeshift at best, and, IMHO, tend to combine to a drink that is less than either style alone.  This has the IPA bitterness and sometime oiliness which is at odds with the yeast phenolics, producing a mish-mash of clashing flavors."

"O: There's a great balance of flavors here, with malt, hops, yeast, and alcohol all contributing. Vibrant and juicy tropical notes brought by both big esters and hops provide the focal point. Spicy and peppery yeast and alcohol add a lot of depth and complexity. It ends up being more of a sipper with the big alcohol warmth slowing things down, but this one is both fun and contemplative at the same time."

"O: not an easy beer to like. Not complex, leaves a bitter taste..."
""

"O: A very good beer, but I would like more late addition hops, very easy to drink, I could easily reach for a second one. Definitely worth trying, would buy again at the right price."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer definitely got better as it warmed up. I feel a road trip to Chambly coming up in the near future."
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent beer. Would like it a few shades cooler as I had it at room temperature. Complex and unique, more floral than others in this style I remember and slightly sweeter."
"This was just fine, but didn't really stand out in the style."
""
"A bit too hoppy for my taste and definitely packs a punch of yeast to all senses."
"O:It as a good beer overall. It was pretty solid but it wasn't really as outstanding as some of DDC's other beers are."
"Single bottle snagged from a craft beer ""pick 6"" wall poured into a goblet. This one is a cloudy golden amber hue with a billowing white head, the latter settling out to leave some intricate lacing on the glass. Aroma is assertive Belgian yeast, spicy yet fruity, with some papaya, mango, and pineapple apparent along with hints of dried banana chip and tobacco. I am getting a lot of musky pineapple on the nose. Palate is a unique, multifaceted hodgepodge of fruit, spice, sour green, bread, and candy flavors. Spicy phenols (clove and faint band-aid) coexist with strawberry fruit chews, rhubarb, candy cigarettes, melon rind, astronaut ice cream, grapefruit, and unripe pear. Initially everything flits about, with nothing obviously out of place despite the mishmash. Things do eventually sort themselves out to a degree, with the strawberry creme and pineapple remaining most salient to me. Moderate of body and carbonation, with a green sour fruit and doughy yeast finish. Not parching and boozy like many tripels and notably hoppy, albeit not in a resinous or piney fashion (think green banana and pineapple skin). Wonderful brew really, so much going on yet not unbalanced or harsh. One of my favorite Belgian IPAs to date."
"Enjoy"

"Overall, a very nice and tasty begian/IPA mix."

"Overall - A very good Belgian IPA, one of my favorites and probably one of the most ""sessionable"" ones if a Belgian IPA can ever be called that. Could easily drink the 4 pack over the course of an evening without thinking twice."
""
"O: Much more hoppy than what I was expecting and more ""west coast"" in style. Quite well done."
""
""
""
""
"I rather enjoyed the ale, but not as the usually constructed Belgian IPA. Its heavy British overtones gives the ale a unique identity that's quite left of center."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, slight citrus, herbal hop, and Belgian yeast aromas. Taste is much the same with honey, earth, and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop and yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite earthy all around."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Great head, lingering foam, substantial lacing. Nose is fruity and yeasty with some bitter, sweet, and earthy components. Yeast accentuated with hints of bitter pith, sweet citrus, wood tones and bittersweetness. Steely, biting, and dry. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
""
"The taste departs from the smell by having a far greater level of hop flavor. There's nearly no yeast bite, which is surprising given that this was dominant in the nose. Reasonable pale malt base. For the style, the body leans on the rich side and the carbonation is spot on. Overall, it's a smooth IPA with very mild Belgian tendencies."
"Interesting Belgian IPA, not my preferred style, but there are very few true Belgians that could compete with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The bottle date seemed to imply it was about a month old. But maybe with the Canadian DD/MM system it was actually bottled over six months ago. I sure hope so but I'll still look out for it again if I know it is fresh."
""
"O: a powerful, tart Belgian Ale; definitely NOT a Belgian IPA -- more like a Belgian tripel. Didn't hit the spot with e but certainly will for others."
"Zealous, biting carbonation plays with the tongue, but like a child soon grows bored and gives it a rest. Moderate to light in body, well balanced and satisfying. However, there is little hop presence for an IPA, Belgian or not, in both flavor and aroma. To me, this drinks as a Belgian pale ale. A Belgian pale ale I would certainly drink again."
""
""
""
""
"I really like the rich flavor of floral and citrus with a strong pronounced yeast character. This style is a favourite of mine and this is a pretty solid example of some of the best aspects. It is lighter on hops than American IPA’s but does has a realy nice citrus bite to it, lots of complexity and a good balance of aromatic citrusy hops with a really solid yeast profile. Will be looking for this again, enjoyed very much. 4.5"
"Rich, full and wheaty, very thick frothy cream head. Mildly cloudy yellow. Strong notes of citrus. Begins crisp and light and finishes with strong honey and light malt character. Very balanced and refreshing, hides its great very well. It seems much more like a wit than an ale."
"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a hazy, opaque, orange-yellow coloring with suspensions floating throughout and a filmy, frothy, uneven white head. Aromas of peach, pear, pineapple, bread, floral highlights, subtle cinnamon and coriander spicing, and some Belgian funk. Subtle nose overall. Flavors are sharp and fruit forward, with a bready backbone that supports and balances. Pear, pineapple, and other tropical fruits blend with coriander spicing on a light, frothy, effervesced body. Spiced and tangy sweet aftertaste, with floral hops highlights accenting the fruit and bready characteristics. Frothy, effervesced finish that cleans the palate and leaves only a trace of spice to linger. Refreshing brew, that is for sure."
"M - Light to medium body. Slight stickiness. Moderate carbonation."

""
""
""
""

"Would definitely have again. Worth seeking out."
""
""
""

"Otherwise, I think this would be a very nice beer if they can get their quality control issues sorted out. I'd be very happy to taste a batch that doesn't have these issues."
""

"A cloudy golden amber pour with a huge lasting white head. Very good head retention and lacing throughout. Aroma of biscuit malt, Belgian yeast, fruity with mild citrus hops. Taste is of malt, Belgian yeast, fruity with mildly spicy citrus hops. Palate is a medium crisp smooth body, moderate carbonation, slightly dry. Finishes with a combination of biscuit malt, Belgian yeast with fruity citrus hops for balance. Overall a very good fairly refreshing Belgian ale nicely balanced, definitely one to try."

"Poured this one in my small Struise chalice. The look and smell are quit normal, nothing special. There was an ingredient i could not lay my hands on... Taste is a bit disappointing but it could be that i had higher expectations..."
"o: really solid. i'm not sure how fresh my bottle was, but there was almost no bitterness - which is not a bad thing. the sweet harmonizes nicely with the yeast and spices. this is a nice crisp, refreshing drinker that provides a nice amount of flavors while at the same time feeling refreshing. thumbs up"

"O: Very drinkable. It's not at all a Belgian IPA but a Belgian Strong Ale. Great beer which is no surprise considering the brewery"

"overall, it's another wanna-be belgium from canada, just like the unibroue line up. still decent, but more rich and sweet than i prefer. also, the american wanna-be belgiums are catching up and putting our some really good brews, so the canadian wanna-be's have some competition.... but overall it's a decent product. just not my favorite, and i prefer the real belgiums..."
""
""
"Just when I start thinking that I might enjoy Belgian IPAs, this pops up and I have to take a step back. It wasn't bad per se but it didn't have what I was hoping for."
"A great complex Belgian pale, but I kind of struggle to find the ""I" part of that. Belgian base is a bit too bold for the hops. Funny that. Still a great drink though."
""
""
""
""
"O - Perfect! Keep up the good work DDC"
"Overall. A nice dry Belgian IPA with some decent hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A delicious blond ale I look forward to having again."
""
""
""
"Overall: A Belgian ale that is just enough hoppy. Well done."
""
""
""
"The taste is much like the aroma with a vibrant citrus flavor that tends to favor oranges or nectarines. Some spicy or peppery notes. The bitterness is moderate and lingers briefly on the palate. Very nice beer all in all."
"Appearance is metallic golden, clear, with white, billowy head that settles to a thin layer. Aroma is sweet, corn or beet sugar and white grape juice, with cracker, biscuit and honey. Taste starts somewhat thick with honey and overcooked biscuit, moves to grassy, nectary hops and a thick mouthfeel. Hops linger on the back of the tongue, but it's lacking the gross candied sugar throat feel. Very solid, but there's better out there imho."
"This is a tasty beer that's well balanced between Belgian spice, hops and malt."
""

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Slight gusher upon opening. Pours murky golden amber color with a nice 3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, honey, grape, orange, herbal, grass, bread, earth, floral, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of orange, lemon, pear, bread, herbal, grass, floral, pepper, earth, candi sugar, light caramel, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, floral, grass, bread, candi sugar, light caramel, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Very nice Belgian/hop flavor balance with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy blond ale! Great flavor balance and complexity; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyable offering."

"Another great offering from Dieu du Ciel, and coming from a Montrealer who drinks a lot of beer from this brewery, this brew is a favourite and a staple of mine."
""
"The beer pours a lovely, hazy golden amber with a generous, fluffy, white head that laces. There is a touch of loose sediment and plenty of carbonation to maintain a constant blanketing of fluffy. The nose is yeasty, bitter, and slightly alcoholic. Initially, it's not as refined as I'd hoped, but as the beer warms more notes of honey and citrus break through. The taste is lovely and unique. It's grainy sweetness to resiny bitterness ratio is quite balanced, while subtle citrus and yeastiness build up and compliment this balance. The beer is medium bodied and well-attenuated with a slight honey sweetness and residual hoppy bitterness. Although this isn't one of my favorite styles of beer, it's a great beer that exemplifies the style."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a murky orange brown with a rich white head. Fruit, light citrus, spicy aroma. Flavor of light citrus, malt and fruit. Dry light fruit middle and dry, slightly hoppy finish. Well made, but with little Belgian spicing. Medium bodied. Interesting take on a Belgian ale."
""
""
"O-a surprisingly raw and well brewed Belgian style from a non Belgian brewery. It doesn't have much complexity to it but it's an enjoyable mild brew. Probably one of the better pale Belgians I've had at the low abv. "
""
"A nice Belgian PA, I did expect more from this brewery, but respectable none the less, plenty pricey too"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a decent Belgian blonde (not a Belgian pale)... Could use a little more hops to balance the sweetness"
"My first DDC brew and can't wait for more!"
""
"O: Totally took me off guard with the more present hop flavors. But it's totally in a good way. Love this beer and I am now determined to have all of this fantastic brewers offerings."
""
"O - I've always seen this beer around but for some reason was always ignoring it. After I tried it, I realised how much I'd been missing out. This is a very well brewed Belgian Pale ale that is very smooth, extremely pleasant to drink and packs lots of flavour, while not going over the top with the ABV. Here in Montreal, this beer is also very affordable. Recommended!"
"3.5 D: It's a tasty beer, but it's ungodly expensive for what it is so I doubt I'll ever buy it again."
"Would be interesting to somehow add some tart lemony notes to this. Is it possible to sour this with some bret/lacto (and optional add lemon)"
""
""
""
"A very nice example of the style, though somewhat simple."
""
"I find that Unibroue and DDC brew better Belgian style beers than most American breweries, something up there in Quebec. This drinks nicely with great yeast and hop flavors."
""
""
""
"O: A good buy, moderately priced and a nice drink. As far as my exposure to Belgian Blondes go, this one is top notch. It would be wonderful to try on tap or cask drawn. The taste is the selling point of this beer, although the appearance makes a close second."
""
"Overall: This pale ale has a different taste to it. The sweetness was a bit much, but I enjoyed it enough."
"O: So far my least favorite Dieu du Ciel beer, but still not bad. I probably won't have another, but still recommend it."
"O: If it's a bit of a letdown, it's only because I have placed Brassierie Dieu du Ciel so high in my mental estimation. A nice beer, recommended even, but nothing I'd seek out again."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into sampler glass. Pours dark gold in colour with an one finger head head which left some bubbly lacing. Aromas could have been stronger, a little bit of spice, some citrus, dry yeastiness. Flavors of pale malt, some honey sweetness is balanced by spice and a drying bitterness from the hops so it is not cloying. Sticky medium mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Expected more despite it's high ranking."
"O- A great Belgian-style ale, lots of flavor and very refreshing. This would be perfect for summer, I'll have to revisit this one again."
""
"O - To me, this Belgian-like brew has a lack of complexity in the taste. The hop is too present and may mask the rest of the aroma. It is worth trying though and I would drink it again. However, next time I will better have it in summer!"
""
""
""
"T: Takes a little while to develop. The taste starts with some Belgian yeast and then moves to some fruity esters, white pepper and earthy hops. Finish has a touch of stone fruit sweetness alongside a definite earthiness. Pretty tasty stuff."
"Like It? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer, and one of the most flavorful you'll find in the style."
"O - For those that love belgian pales, this is worth trying. I like many of the Dieu De Ciel offerings, but this one didn't do much for me."
"Overall: this beer doesn't greatly appeal to me, but it definitely has some good characteristics which seem ill-executed or simply not well put together. Not bad, but I won't be going after this beer again anytime soon."
"Now this is good stuff. I had it out of the bottle for lunch w/ tourtière du Quebec and chaudrée d'hiver. The beer pours well, had a fluffy head, and smells great. It's a perfect compliment to French Canadian food. It has enough taste but doesn't overpower the food. I strongly recommend it."
"D/O - Very drinkable as the 7% ABV shows but is not overpresent. Another great beer by Dieu Du Ciel, not my fav, but I will be going for this one again in the future."
"O - This was my first Brasserie Dieu du Ciel and its a good one. Solid beer here. I particuarly loved the yeasty characteristic. I will be looking for more beers from Dieu du Ciel. Good beer."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice mix of Belgian and American elements. The caramel malts do a nice job of balancing out the strong yeast elements."
"Overall: I actually really like this beer and I am becoming more impressed with brasserie dieu du ciel. Highly recommended"
"95."
"jd"
"Cheers"
"Paired this up with some Goats Cheese, I found that it went very well together. The beer poured out as a hazy yellow color with a fluffy white head on top. The smell of the beer is a little grainy and also has a light floral aroma to it. The taste is a bit on the simple side, it doesn't have a whole lot of depth but it is refreshing. The mouthfeel was soft and had a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall this beer was pretty good."
"Poured a 2"" soap suds bubbles head. Hazy yellow verging on apricot appearance. Smells strongly of malt. Taste is same plus has caramel. The body is rich and oppulent, almost a blond barleywine. And I'd say it fairly lives up to it's Abbey-style labelling, in a blind tasting I'm pretty sure I'd guess it was a Belgian Abbey. Nice beer."
"A very impressive, well-crafted beer. There's a lot going on, but it's all harmonious and delicious. Wow."
"O- So far, everything that Dieu du Ciel makes that I've tried has been excellent and this isn't an exception! Very well balanced, I think there are qualities in this beer that a wide variety of beer enthusiasts would appreciate. Another great Quebec microbrew!"
"DRINK (4/5) A really drinkable BPA, well balanced and tasty. It didn't really play into style guideline; but who cares? I was tasty."
"Overall a lovely blonde, and one that I could easily drink again and again. Though a little heavier than I personally like with the style, it never really gives away its higher alcohol percentage."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great Belgian IPA."
"Pours yellow in color. Very clear at first, but I did not hold back yeast, so it became hazy (in retrospect, a mistake). Lively white head that dissipated to a solid cover. Aroma is crisp and refreshing - grassy, lemony and a bit fruity. Taste is a bit spicy, but with strong (even if very light) maltiness to balance hops and yeast. Light body especially considering its strength. I find it very drinkable. I would enjoy it on tap (and perhaps in a bottle) on a hot summer evening."
"I had a Peche Mortel as few months ago and came away thinking Dieu Du Ciel might be overhyped. This beer thoroughly changed my mind."
"Scarily drinkable for 7%!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: Sipping this one is quite easy to do and one sip follows another perhaps a bit too quickly. When looking for a Belgian Pale that asserts itself and leaves a strong impression this is one I’ll return to again. My overall impression is of a well-made beer that is complex enough to be interesting and has enough strength of flavors to assert itself and make itself known. I’m thinking that this would make a nice companion to certain types of foods as it would not get lost in the shuffle."
"This beer poured a very cloudy yellow color and formed a nice huge off white head that refused to go away and coated the glass with lace when it finally did much like a float. A heavy amount of carbonation present and some sediment and particles floating about. The aroma was Belgian yeasts, lemon, spices and pepper. The flavor was of bread, citrus and pepper. The body was fairly light and the finish was sprite."
"D= Damn good beer here. I think its their nod toward the hoppy Belgian ales being made by Urthel and Chouffe, with some citrusy American hops blended in with the European. Tasty enough that I will be buying more of this when I see it."
"nice, dry, fruity, refreshing belgian blonde here. somehow, doesn't quite come together harmoniously. additionally, though i love dry beers (see de ranke, for example), there is a bit of an astringency here that needs smoothing out. still, i'd recommend it."
"Overall, a good beer. Nice version of a belgian pale, but not a standout."
"O - a great belgian pale ale and what i've come to expect from dieu du ciel."
"Great beer. Toned down the booze, gave us grain and malt and hops and fruit. Great balance -- nothing outdoes the other. More than worthy."
"O - An exceptional beer. All the qualities of a tripel with more drinkability if you can believe it. On the sweet side for sure but still very complex and probably the best looking BPA - not to mention one of the best tasting - I've had to date."
"Lighter color, but very cloudy. Wheaty and hoppy... floral as well, but in a way that's rougher than with the rosee d'hibiscus. Sweet and fruity, but surprisingly, these tastes of dark fruits come through in a great way. Like peach with plum or something like that. Really complex and interesting. I've probably missed a lot, but I'll just have to wait until next time. Hopefully on draft..."
"Drink- A little let down by the taste. Probably wont have this again but it was pretty decent."
"Mouthfeel is very, very creamy aside from a brief chalky interlude that appears to be random. Drinkability is solid, as the beer doesn't really offend, but isn't phenomenal due to the sub-par finish of unintelligible hop bitterness. The bitterness is not as strong as I'd have liked, nor is it distinctive in any way. This beer is worth it for the taste though, I really enjoyed it."
"Finish is a nice medium full grapefruit bitter. Nicely drinkable."
"This was poured into a snifter and is several months past it's ""recommended drink date"". It pours a beautiful, murky muddied apricot in color with a root beer float like, pork rhine looking cream colored head. There is a wicked amount of sediment floating around. This beer smells like an orange tree with a little mint added. How is this? It smells delicious, mouthwateringly so. The flavor is very malty and of subdued citrus fruits but has the sweetest of an orange with a light minty after taste. I'm guessing it's not supposed to be, or drink like this but I'm loving it. Because it's a little past its date it is exceptionally smooth and very drinkable. This aged bottle is superb. I was lucky enough to snag it for only $1.49, so it looks like I'll be grabbing some more. I do wonder how it is fresh though. Yet another good beer from Brasserie Dieu du Ciel."
"Overall impression: interesting yet complex flavor. worth a try but i can't have a second."
"Pours a hazy, amber color. 6/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, wheat, sweet malt, slight yeast, hint of citrus, hint of floral, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of a Belgian Pale Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, hops, sweet malt, slight wheat, slight pale malt, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"A very nice example of the style. The hops are pretty americanized for the style which I enjoy. Well done and worth trying."
"Drinkability - Another Dieu du Ciel masterpiece, this is a great beer that offers so much to the beer drinker. I am very impressed and will stock for sure."
"Drinkability - The lack of balance in this ale resulted in what could have been a good beer land right at average."
"The nose is tangerine peel, peach, mango and citrus fruit rind. Moderately dense body, smooth texture, sharp flavours, tart and bitter, spicy clove, marjoram, a touch sour in the long finish that lingers for some time accentuated by lemon rind. This is a complex and interesting offering from Dieu Du Ciel! and up to the high standards set by one of Canada's best breweries, what a pleasure to sip and savour."
"D - Overall a very tasty offering from DDC and I can understand why this one is so well rated/respected. A great example of the style and highly recommended to any Belgian fan."
"Drinkability: This is a really great beer. Big Belgian flavors and big hops."
"A great marriage of big hops and Belgian yeast. Maybe bettter classified as a Belgian IPA? Regardless, I will be sure to reach for this one whenever it is available!"
"D: smooth drinking as always dieu du ciel has the ability to make beers come together, am going to pick a few of these up they are on sale."
"D: it drank good and was really tasty easily making it one of my new favorite belgian style pale ale."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian Pale Ale."
"Drinability is pretty good with some hoppy resin and little astringency but finishes clean and crisp and very drinkable."
"This is easily drank. It is very well balanced."
"A solid Belgian-style pale from one of my favourite breweries!"
"I challenge anyone who tries a beer which offers so many aromas and flavours and textures to stop at just one. How can you? I owe it to the brewery to buy plenty more; after all, you wouldn't listen to a Stravinsky sonata but once, or simply glance at a Klimt, or read one of García Márquez's tomes for the first time and just assume you understood it all and can appreciate it to its fullest. No, works of art, such as this, deserve deliberation."
"D- Exceptionally drinkable, definitely a very nice Belgian Golden, great beer."
"Light golden with pretty good head and lacing. Smells of soap and slight grain. Taste is about the same. Slightest hint of toffee and no real depth. Feel is light with prickly carbonation. Drinks light without much flavor."
"pretty good IMO. this one isn't that cold but I think would taste great a little colder than what it is now. good tasting, refreshing, an overall good beer."
"Dry, yeasty Belgian style brew, ample lime notes, dry hops and wheat infused intrigue. Enjoyable and flavorful Canadian take on a sturdy and classic style. More quality brew from BDDC"
"A nice take on the style, I like it. Traditional Belgian style with some added citrus and hops. It's nice to have a Belgian style where the hops and spices aren't the only thing getting all of the attention."
"Overall a really fantastic surprise of a beer. Then again, Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel seldom fails to disappoint."
"Nice beer. Recommended."
"Taste is hops, orange peel, and fruit. Very interesting, lots of stuff happening. Clearly a Belgian style brew, but at the same time reminds you of a good weiss. 7% alcohol very nicely handled. Perhaps a bit too bitter on finish, but overall a really well made beer. Perfect for settling into the comfy chair with."
"One for the Ages."
"More props for the awesome consistent label from DDC."
"D- Pretty good beer for any occasion, be it with food, or alone. I find it has a taste that really stands out, and I'm glad I reviewed it now, while it's still available to me. I plan to pick up more and hope some are still left before the LCBO takes it away."
"D - a great brew all around in all aspects, DDC never fails to impress"
"A nice flavourful yet easy going Belgian style ale. Very pleasant."
"Excellent rendition of Orval, less complex but more drinkable."
"Another winner from DDC, a great BPA that can challenge any Belgian or Unibroue product. Definitely worth a pick up - or two or three. (And, once again, terrific bottle artwork!)"
"D: This would make an excellent lawn chair quaffer...you'll just be belching alot - brings back those excellent hops though."
"This one has a thick lush head that looks like sea foam rather than the thin white carbonated bubbles one often sees. The scent is complex: Rye, grapefruit, caramel, frankincense?!. Strong in alcohol but not overpowering thanks to the very flavourful hops and prominent malt. If you are ever in Montreal be sure to visit the Brasserie Dieu du Ciel in Mile End."
"This is a fantastic Belgian-inspired beer that's both complex and a real pleasure to imbibe. So damn refreshing too. Our one disappointment is that we only picked up a single bottle instead of a six-pack, but we didn't want to push our beer karma with customs."
"Drink - one of my favorites by Dieu Du Ciel. I'd be happy to drink this beer again."
"Pours a hazy/murky orange, with tints of light golden brown and tangerine around the edges. Couple of fingers of dense, cream coloured head. Excellent retention, with some dense lacing also. Aroma is a nice bouquet of citrus, lots of banana, green apple, spice, Belgian yeast and a very floral aspect to it. Flavour is on the hoppier side of things, fairly citrus again with some lemon zest, and a grassy/floral feel to it. Fairly high carbonation, smooth and crisp. Good drinkability and almost feels like a saison in some aspects. I like this and (although likely heresy) might reach for this over the Orval I had last night. Just a tad more appealing to my buds."
"Overall I rather enjoyed this, and can't wait to get my hands on some more DDC stuff."
"Pours pale golden orange with bright white head that started lacing the glass immediately. Once head settled it retained a thin layer on top of the beer. Smells of yeast and citrus and fruit quite good but nothing special. Taste is good, very refreshing and carries the 7% well. It finishes with a pleasant white grape taste, different but nice. Mouthfeel is a little thin, not disappointing, but quite pleasant. Drinks really well, this is a very approachable abbey ale that won't just please the beer geek but also those who may not take a chance on something like this. Not my favorite abbey ale but I would certainly buy it again."
"D - High. Tasty enough and low enough abv that this could be sessioned without losing interest."
"This was one of my first Belgian pale ales when I first had it. It is finally available in Ontario (at least for now) so I decided to review it. Pours a pale yellow with a hint of orange colour. Very thick white head that doesn't move at all. Lacing is literally covering the whole glass. Smells of fruity malt and Belgian yeast, but with some mild hopping. I think I pick up some type of spices, but can't put my finger on it. I can almost see some hints of an English pale ale in this, but I could just be crazy. Very nice carbonation. I'll be buying a lot of this while I can actually get it in Toronto."
"Bottle pours a lovely dark hazy yellow with a decent amount of foam in the chimay glass. Tastes of initially of slight lemon zest with a faint citrus hop background to it. It drinks down very smooth and is quite sessionable. Glad I have 10 more bottles left of this. This beer is very delicious."
"A pleasant drinking beer with a couple of challenging flavours, but goes down smooth. Very enjoyable."
"Very nice. Interesting twist to a pretty well made Belgian ale, that works. Very drinkable all up."
"Drinkability:This is spot on in terms of style, and is really pleasant to drink. Easily sessionable."
"D: Very easy to drink but I hoped for stronger flavors."
"D: Goes down very easy but the weak taste is very confusing. The bottle seemed to be fairly fresh and was bought from an establishment that kept it refrigerated and has decent turnover. Odd, considering blandness isn't something I've yet to find in the DDC beers I've tried."
"D - Very good."
"D: A very good BPA and drinks with the complexity of a BSPA. I'm glad I got to try another Dieu du Ciel, just wish they weren't so pricey and hard to find."
"I'm always down for a tasty Belgian Pale Ale and this one delivered. Well balanced and flavorful with a creamy easy drinking body here that really set this apart. Nice offering here from Dieu Du Ciel."
"It has a medium body, a nice bit of carbonation, and I could go with this one for a while. Nice brew, I may have to find some more"
"Drinkability is severely hampered by the nail polish remover/plastic character. It's too bad because this beer seemed to have a lot of promise until that hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm hoping the bottle I got was bad or something, but I just don't know. I eventually drain poured after drinking about half of it."
"drinkability - this is a pretty smooth beverage that is unobtrusive, I could drink this for a while"
"D: Very pleasant to drink, but could use some stronger aromas and flavours."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy, pale yellow color with a white head. The retention was good and the lacing impressive and consistent. The aroma was a combination of fruity elements (perhaps Ringwood yeast) earthy notes and a light spiciness. The flavors were a classic blend of Belgian yeast, light citrus, some tropical fruits and a light amount of spices and a dry finish. More hoppy than a lot of Belgian Pale Ales tend to be. Very much a Belgian style beer, only lighter, less bold and more sessionable. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation high. Traditionally Belgian in style but not quite so much in execution. Still worth trying but more as a session beer than a Belgian Pale Ale."
"A liked this one a bit more than I did."
"Slightly astringent, but crisp at the end. A good beer."
"Light body with moderate carbonation suit the beer well."
"D: The beer has some rather interesting flavors so I would definitely try it again."
"D - A decent enough beer if you like the style. Worth trying."
"The brew pours a deep golden hue with decent carbonation that leaves a dense frothy two finger head and sporadic sticky lacing,the smell is quite nice with aromas of perfume,yeasty bread,pepperoni and lavender,it has a nice sessionable medium bodied mouthfeel with tastes of belgian yeast,bready malts,apricots and confectionary all hitting the tastebuds and it finishes quite dry and very moreish,definately a decent brew that could drink more than one of,will buy again."
"Taste is quite concordant, very sweet but in a clear spicy grapefruity background. nice and balanced bitter finale much like the mentioned citric, mouldy alcohol feel throughout. strong enough and quite pleasant. Kudos, finally got my hands on this brewery."
"Final Thoughts: Well, Peche Mortel this was not as I was left very disappointed by this beer. As far as I can tell, the biggest problem I have with this one is that there seems to be far too much of a yeast presence here. It really is a shame, but maybe I got a bad bottle."
"Recommend to everyone"
"Very refreshing, would be a good summer time beer, my only complaint is that I wish it was a little sweeter"
"D: Damned drinkable, and something I'd love to have again."
"D: Refreshing and full of flavor."
"Overall very session able, the light fruit notes and the nice easier feel really worked. For a blond ale, I was impressed."
"M - Yeasty and dry. Crisp and refreshing. Delicious and good amount of CO2."
"pours out a cloudy peach color with a persistent 1"" head with sticky lacing..the smell was clove, coriander, ginger, and citrus..it did not fill my senses but was just there ..good..the taste was the same better then the smell i was hit with clove and and coriander some then nice spices like ginger were offset with a citrus/hop zing ..its medium bodied in the mouth and drinkable.. IMO its a little high priced for the style with many belgium pales at half the price..still recommended and one i will try/buy again"
"My first sip I was taken aback by the alcoholic strength being so dominating a charter in the beer, covering up the underlying flavours. As I drank it over a good half hour, the flavour profile developed (or maybe my palate was used to the alcohol). I found the taste to be good, but disappointing as the nose promised many subtle flavours. The carbonation was nice, although I believe that the drinkability and subtle flavour would be better served with a slightly lower ABV."
"Drinkability is good here but this is not an easy one to get. Definalty a good blonde ale."
"Overall, very drinkable. Refreshing. Very easy to drink."
"Cloudy amber color, lot of foam retention! It smells spicy, but not a strong odour though. However, strong taste: citrus, ginger, spices. It would have been even better if a little sweeter. Medium-bodied, not a lot complex though. Alcohol finale and a good carbonation. I could drink a few without being bored."
"I liked this beer enough, though, for the price, there are some better pales on the shelf. As far as Canadian beer brewers of Belgian imitations (and this is personal opinion) I would go with Unibroe."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not the greatest Belgian style beer but not bad either."
"Drinkability- Fairly drinkable. A bit bitter for my liking but finishes well."
"Not what I think of for a Belgian Pale. There is an odd bitterness that lingers on and on. No Belgian yeast or funky flavors that I love so much. It is really not bad, and worth a try. Though not one of Dieu Du Ciel's better offerings."
"my only complaint is the price of this beer, and even then it's worth it. this is yet another great beer by DDC I've said it before and I'll say it again ""Best brewery in Canada"" enough said??"
"D- I liked this one at the start, but the bitterness that's left in my mouth afterwards really lingers and it just doesn't work with the flavors or the style IMO."
"Subtly tart on the back end, which really gives quite an odd presence to the otherwise funky yeast and ends up giving it a dry crispness not particularly notable of others of the style. Drinkable nonetheless."
"Mmmmm - HMM!! Yessir, this is one FINE beer! Perhaps the best beer out of Canada I've had yet. Poured with a huge, foamy, frothy, fluffy, textured, off-white head that lasts forever and loads of lace. Color is a moderately hazy amber. Aroma is floral, a hint of minerals, hops, malt, spice, and grass. Flavor's all a that and more. Dryish up front with hints of sweetness that come and go. Little honey in there too. Good burps. Great body and carbonation. Pick up a touch of alcohol in the very end. Could sip this beer on and on and on."
"D: Drinkable and very interesting. Very surprised with this one."
"This Belgian Ale is hazy yellow with lots of yeast floaties throughout showing right after thew pour. The head is a frothy, rocky cap and leaves nice lace. In the nose, lemon rind and funky yeast meet bread crust and flowery hops, with a touch of spicy pine. This beer shows good flavours of lemongrass and floral hops, leading into yeasty funk and quite dry hops. Finish is dry and bitter. This is well made and dangerously drinkable given the ABV. Thanks a lot for this one Jeff!"
"D: A multitude of aromas and flavors compose a flavorful, enjoyable brew."
"Since I bought the last case from Sherbrooke Liquor, I'm now a bit nervous that it will be difficult to get. Quebec, ici je viens!"
"D - A well put together and refreshing blonde. The spicy yeast and hop flavors are spot on, but it comes across a bit too tart and with more wheat flavor than I need in a blonde. A good, drinkable beer nonetheless."
"Worth a try."
"Overall this is a bit mediocre without nothing really standing out."
"Drinkability- Calm down the foam and a touch more malt and you have a fabulous brew...as is, still a winner in my book. Nice flavors."
"A good beer - an interesting Belgian Pale Ale"
"This poured a hazy gold with chunky sediment and moderate white head. It smelled like lemon hops and salty wild yeast, with Belgian sugar and a bit of banana and light chocolate. It tasted like lemon and grassy and floral hops and wild yeast, with Belgian sugar and light cocoa powder. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a dry bitter aftertaste. Overall this was not very unique but had a nice clean and crisp taste. The flavor was fairly well balanced, and was light and easy to drink. Body was decent, but this beer generally lacked depth or anything really compelling. Not bad, but an easily forgettable beer."
"Drinkability: This is a top notch Belgian Pale Ale that could easily be classified as a Belgian IPA"
"A 341ml bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed golden yellow color with about an inch of dense, but quickly fading bone white head. Flavor and aroma are of spicy yeast, citrus fruits, grassy, semi-sweet. Medium in both body and carbonation with a somewhat dry, slightly alcohol finish. Decent stuff overall."
"The beer pours a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. There are loads of floaties present. The aroma is good. It has a really nice pale malt and Belgian yeast ester scent. It's quite fruity with a slightly dry earthiness. The taste is good as well. It has a perfectly balanced flavor profile that includes a wonderful hop character as well as fruity yeast element. It goes down with ease and finishes dry with a earthy/yeasty feel. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine blonde ale. It love the yeast character as well as the hop taste."
"An agreeable enough Belgian IPA, one which drinks a bit more like a strong saison, but that's just nitpicking. Tasty, especially if you need a dry kick to the palate."
"The taste was a too astringent. I think the hop bitterness battles the Belgian yeast too much and it ends up being too much of the wrong flavors. The finish is very medicinal."
"This is a hoppy interpretation of the style, while maintaining a malty backbone. Nice Belgian yeast strain ties things together. Nice effervescence without becoming fizzy. Could be a Belgian IPA, IMO."
"Pours a five finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Cloudy amber color with a ton of yeast floating. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Belgian yeast nose. Flavor is citrus and Belgian yeast with light grapefruit aftertaste. $4.29 for a 11.5oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Very enjoyable. Highly drinkable."
"the finish for me was a bit harsh...hence a lower score than this beer could have had given it's balance and excellent ingredients. Just a little too much bitter citrus peel to make this an upper teir BPA...that said, very drinkable"
"This one is incredibly drinkable and refreshing. At 6.5% you can't quaff it like a pale ale but like an IPA, in the summer it's so damn refreshing and clean and leaves you gulping it down, especially with its slightly thinner body. DDC nails this one. Going to have to go get some more bottles from Montreal!"
"This is very drinkable and currently one of my favorite drinking beers. At 6.5% it's just right for drinking three or four...or six. Interesting and flavourful but won't overwhelm your taste buds."
"Golden blonde color with tons of floaties. Two full fingers of fluffy white head. Very light clove aroma, yeast, orange peel, perhaps some white grapes. The taste is a departure from the smell, with a waxy malt dominance that isn't really that impressive but is still drinkable. Medium bodied but a slightly watery taste leaves the impression that it is lighter. This is a nice easy drinking beer but not a memorable one."
"An all-around great beer."
"Nice straw color with a beautiful white head. Aroma is cool refreshing fruits - not too strong. The taste was slightly underwhelming upon first sip. After a few more sips, it opened up a little, but I'm not blown away. I was expecting more - it just doesn't have that depth that so many real Belgian ales have. Still a nice and smooth drink."
"Poured into a wine glass, the body is a honey color with an attractive two finger head. Taking the first whiff of Derniere Volonte is quite a sensation. It consisted of pepper, vanilla, and some citrus, incredible smell ! The taste had malt, some carbonation, peach and some more of that pepper. Mouthfeel is refreshing and has a sweet and satisfying aftertaste. Drinkability is good, I wish I had a couple more of these to go, oh well."
"A very good Belgian Blond Ale in my opinion. The dry hopping adds a nice subtle hop flavor, without veering into Belgian IPA territory. Recommended."
"Overall: the mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and soft with a crisp edge. The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium. This is a very nice example of a Belgium Pale Ale. I want it to be a little more agressive with the hops."
"Excellent stuff and very, very easy to drink. Have to say I quite liked this one. Impressive."
"More please! Refreshing, quenching, and you don't wanna stop at one, great session potential if it wasn't for the higher abv%. Don't take this the wrong way, but this is such a decent satisfying easy-drinker, especially for hot summer months and patios, that if you have the clams to shell out this might just be one of the finest and most expensive barbecue/lawnmower beers you ever pick up. Or maybe just stick to sharing this with good company on the patio..."
"A nice Belgian Pale, lives up to the style. Solid but not amazing."
"Drinkability: this is one of the best BPAs that I've tried. Hoppy and flowery with fruity aromas and flavours. A luxurious and highly drinkable beer."
"A must have in the fridge, for those times when you need a good belgium with some twist."
"Pouring into an oversized glass results in a cloudy orage color with a finger of bubbly white head. Head quickly evaporates, leaving just a thin layer over the top, and some minor lacing at the top of the glass. Smell is somewhat hoppy, with a bit of citrus. The taste is complex - a bit earthy, a hint of orange peel, a bit chewy with a bitter finish. Taste lasts in your mouth for quite a while. Not something I would choose for a night of drinking, but decent overall."
"Worth it for the try."
"This sucker was picked up at MarCellars in Idaho Falls which is in Idaho, of course! Freegin' killer choice for a drink this evening. I think that my only partial non-smile was because it's a bit too heady, super frothy and it sticks around forever w/serious lite lacing. She's a spike to chew on....anwahhh. Super drink that teases like great super yumm yumm floral masterpiece or one could simply say, ""Great Beer!"" Cheers!"
"D- This is a great Belgian Pale Ale. Soft hop bitterness with a bigger hop flavor that blends perfectly with the yeasty qualities and opens up more and more with each sip."
"Revisit December 2009: Yup, just as I reviewed it previously. The biting qualities which seem to be from some spicy yeast, don't do this beer justice, or any favors. Not bad for the style, but there are lots better."
"Nicely drinkable. A nice sessionable Belgian..."
"D: Easy drinking abbey ale. I don't get disliking this beer. Maybe, it's not your very favorite style or Belgian, but it's balanced and could go with any meal. It's interesting and complex, yet light on the palate and the head. Delicious stuff."
"great work DDC."
"Overall a tasty and user-friendly ale. Nice dry hopping."
"M/D - Medium bodied, maybe on the thin side of the spectrum. Light chewiness and very crisp. Excellent carbonation. Very easy drinking."
"D-I wish I had more of these. So far I'm impressed by the offerings I've sampled from Dieu du Ciel."
"A delicate Belgian Pale that lacks a dynamic, bold flavor profile. Flavors, aroma, and body are all above average, in addition to how light and drinkable this offering is."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style while adding a bit more hops than usual, I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of this beer but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it as much as I did. It's a solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"Notes: Wasn't impressed right up until I put the beer in my mouth. Aroma/appearance were decent enough, but the spicy pepper thing on the palate really won me over. The finish is a little odd, and reduces some of the ""drinkabilitly."" A good beer."
"Good stuff here.I could drink it and drink it."
"Very nice and drinkable example of its' style. Definitely a good twist on the American Pale Ale as well due to the spicy mouthfeel."
"D: Good drinkability, one of the best per style outside of Belgium. A beautiful combination of spices and malt with a the perfect abv makes this very enjoyable and easy to down in multiples."
"Mouthfeel is good as is drinkability. Having a few of these in a row is real possibility."
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color with lots of visible yeast loaties. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes slowly into thorough lacing. The aroma is of spicy, yeasty, and bready. The taste is spicier than the aroma with a lot of cardamom and anise. The finish is lingering, and again spicy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety, chewy texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice, spicy Belgian Pale Ale. It is so flavorful that I see it more as a sipper rather than an easy drinking Belgian Pale. I would definitely sit back with another one though."
"Notes - Pretty darn tasty, but there's something about the finish that is just the slightest bit off to me."
"In case anyone is wondering. We purchased the bottles at a local Metro market."
"An exceptional take on one of my favorite styles. Fantastic."
"Pours a cloudy bright golden orange color with an average pure white head that dissipated into a ring around the glass. The aroma is not very strong but it is nice, some pineapple or other tropical fruit, some bubble gum or clove phenols and candi sugar. The taste is similar to the aroma; tropical fruit, clove, candi sugar but there is a bitter hop presence that keeps the sweetness in check. The feel is fairly light with loads of carbonation; finishes bitter not sweet, as most BPAs do. I appreciate the (somewhat) lower ABV that goes along with a very flavorful BPA. Nice balance between sweet and bitter."
"Dernière Volonté's a good beer. I've had better releases of the style. This one comes across as a little overly aggressive and could stand to have a few kinks worked out (nose strength, alcohol warmth, and high carbonation). It's a good beer that's well worth checking out, but it could be improved a little."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange with a gigantic white head that laces the glass well. Smells of light citrus and that nice Belgian bread aroma. Pretty nice overall beer, hits the style well. Has notes of citrus, spice, red fruit, hop bitter finish, with slight alcohol warming on the finish. Good Belgian flavors that round out this beer very well. Overall a pretty well balanced b.pale ale with a nice malty sweetness to it that rounds this one out well, Dieu Du Ciel is 2/2 so far, and I haven't had Mortel yet."
"D - A good beer, more carbonation than I like, but still a solid beer from a good company"
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Head recedes gradually, with lace that sticks so solid and long as to look etched in place. Aroma is sweet, fruity, banana, lots going on. Taste starts sweet as well, banana with a citric twinge in the middle, and closes pleasantly hoppy. Mouthfeel is small-bubbled and smooth, with very nice drinkability. Everything comes together beautifully, an excellent brew."
"Nice, session-able beer but at $4-5 per bottle in the US, it hurts it's drinkability score."
"A decent brew, but won't drink alot of these."
"D - Could be easier to drink and more enjoyable but isn't bad."
"Pours a nice golden color with a frothy white head. It leaves slight lacing around the edges. The nose has some fruitiness and bready yeast and sweet malt. The taste is quite similar to what you get from a belgian pale. Its nice and semi sweet then bitter and bready with hops and yeast. Its got a high level of carbonation with a light feel. Overall a very solid belgian pale. Definitely worth a try."
"One finger off white head on initial pour. Opaque yellow orange body. Spongy head after a few minutes, soapy lacing. I'm a little stuffed up but I'm getting some good hops on the nose. A little pine and citrus. Refreshing hop and carbonation balance in the mouth. Very bitter for a Belgian, this is probably the first Belgian PA that I've remembered such a strong hop presence. Tasty."
"Derniere Volonte (Last Will) is one of the best non-Belgian Belgian pale ales that I've had. Although it falls a little short in the depth and complexity departments, it comes close to compensating completely by being so bold and spicy. Other than the legendary Peche Mortel, this is BDDC's best (easily obtainable) beer."
"Pours a yellow golden straw color with a white pillowy head. Lots of bubbles and carbonation. There was not a much of an aroma to speak of. Tasts bready with a bit of lemon zest with a bit of floral hoppiness and a dry finish. A good amount of carbonation with some nice bubbles as it goes down. Another winner from dieu du ciel."
"M/D - very enjoyable brew, easy drinking in my opinion. I'm mad i only picked up one bottle of this one."
" i am a big fan of dieu du ciel.hopefully with time they will be able to bottle more of their fine brews."
"Poured into a tulip and served at 50 degrees.A near perfect amount of sweetness that is assertive yet always held in check by both the hops and the flavorful yeast strain.The only flaw I find is a long powerful grass note that is initialy intriguing yet overstays its welcome lingering at the end of each pull. These flavors certainly have the potential to coalesce into an even more impresive whole with a little careful cellaring (6 months-2 years). An impressive example of the style."
"Pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a huge foamy white head that quickly settles into a thin lacing that lasts. Citrus and floral hop aroma with some pine, citrus fruit and sweet maltiness. Perfect balance of hops, fruit and yeast, with hints of golden crisp apple and pear and subtle spices. Bitter hops up front with creamy smooth fruit center and dry hop finish. Very good!"
"Wow! Delicious Belgian ale with a ton of flavor. Aroma was the only average thing about this beer- grass and a hint of yeast. Pour was perfect and stunning. Deep dark orange with so much suspended yeast floating around it looks like you are looking into the night sky. Taste was very full and rich. Strong orange, apricot and spice. An apple/pear aftertate fills the back of the throat after the strong carbonation stops pricking. Great Belgian style beer."
"Sufficiently complex to intrigue a slow, contemplative taste but also drinkable to be enjoyed on less reflective occasions. This one is underrated and worth seeking."
"Flavor is packed with notes of white pepper, lemon grass, floral hops, white grape rinds, and yeast. A finish of grassy hop bitterness lingers just long enough, followed by a slight hint of soap. Uber-creamy, slick mouthfeel to this Belgian Pale, but where did all the carbonation go? You really have to let the beer sit on the palate for a bit before some light bubbliness peppers the tongue. Finishes with a blend of sweet tropical fruits and bitterness, with a slightly sticky, medium body. Overall, a great beer by Dieu Du Ciel that drinks easily and packs enough complexity to keep me wanting more. I'd definitely have this again, if only the steep price tag allowed it."
"The finish, as well as great taste, makes this a dangerously drinkable brew. The alcohol manages to make its presence known with a slight warmth. This is an impressive brew that i would recommend highly to fans of pale ales in general, whether it be english, belgian, or both. I hope to find more of this soon."
"D- Good. Overall I really like the flavor of this beer, but there's smoething funny at the end that I dont care for."
"Nice beer, but for the price it's not worth it."
"A nice belgian, one that I'll buy again, but hopefully I'll be able to get a little fresher next time. Seems to age just fine, though."
"A: Hazy straw with a touch of white, nice thin layer of foam that covers the entire surface area, peaks of lacing that run the edge of the foam - 4.50, S: Lots of spices, possibly orange peel, Belgian yeast 4.25, T: Some dry bitter spice, bitterness almost certainly from the significant hop load, the yeast is definitely having a say in this beer - 4.00, M: 4.00, D: A pleasant beer, the first from Dieu Du Ciel - 3.75"
"D - Drinkability is really good for this brew. I pretty much like everything about this one and could easily see myself revisiting it again in the future. Stays pretty smooth throughout and has a big enough flavor to really grab you by the taste buds. Alcohol is covered well. Dieu Du Ciel really hit the mark with this version of the Belgian Pale Ale. Recommended for sure."
"Bought a single of this at Marty's in Newton. Poured in to a snifter a brilliant murky orange, with two fingers of white head. I poured the sediment from the bottle in to the glass at the end, wasn't really meaning to, but oh well. Cream and orange come to mind in the aroma. Taste is a bit odd. Lots of carbonation, an almost chalky medicinal presence, bitter hops. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, and very in your face with a range of complexities. Not bad as far as drinking goes, but one is enough for me. This one ranks as one of the more fascinating Belgian Pales I have had. I think I will pick another bottle up to see how it compares."
"Big head and a nice cloudy orange colour top this beer off. The nose is both yeasty and redolent of blood oranges. This a refined tripel that has well balanced flavours that are not in your face. Unibroue may be the go to Canadian brewer for Belgium style beers but these guys seem to know their way around a brew kettle."
"D: Another fine beer in this style I could drink a lot of this very easily, especially on a hot day. This is a fine beer, one of my new favorites."
"M/D: Nice mouthfeel, carbonation is just about right, slight creaminess to the medium body. Decent drinkability and low ABV helps. A very well balanced beer in every way, nothing spectacular, but a good beer."
"I'm liking this brew but my liquor store charges $6 for a 11.5oz bottle and I won't be returning to it at that price."
"Drinkability - tasty but at $6 a bottle I'll seek out a cheaper alternative when I want a Belgian pale."
"Wow! A hopped up Belgian Blonde Ale. A: Hazy yellow, with a huge, spritzy head. Lumpy patches of foam stuck around till the glass was finished. A: Smells like earthy Belgian type yeast and citrusy American hops. F: Big citrus hops hit first, then a peppery yeast note, some delicate bready malt finished with ample hop bitterness. The yeast is rather subdued, which helps the hops shine through. B/M: Very light bodied and effervesent. Full carbonation that makes for a thirst quenching ale. This is a dangerously drinkable beer. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: this is a great version of a belgian blonde that everyone should try. Easy to drink this one despite the bold flavors."
"Overall, I found Dernière Volonté to be a great beer, but more of a pale ale than Abbey Style Blonde. That alone made the beer a little more appealing to me!"
"Pours a cloudy pale gold in color with about an inch or more of pillowy white head. Smell is slight citrus and lemon zest. There is a bit of yeast in there as well. Just noticed some yeasties as I set down my beer as well. There is quite a bit of hops and biting citrus in the taste. Pretty hoppy belgian."
"11.5 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both low. The aroma is Belgian yeast, pepper, spicy hops, lemon, and tropical fruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but it's also a little bit bready and the hops are stronger in the taste compared to the other flavors. Mouthfeel is medium, it has a bit of a dry finish and above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it has a bit too much carbonation for me, but it is smooth and not hard to drink. However, I don't think I could drink more than 1 at a time. Overall I think this is a decent brew, it's not a bad beer but it's not something I'd pick up very often either."
"Purchased: Liquor Max, Loveland CO"
"Sizzling carbonation, airy feel, quite refreshing and extremely drinkable."
"Tastes of spice, fruits, alcohol, hop bitterness and a nice smooth malt presence."
"This is a really solid, tasty brew. Quite drinkable. Definitely recommended."
"Pours a bright, hazy yellow orange with a rocky white head that shows very good retention and sporadic lacing. The aroma starts much like a typical Belgian pale with yeast and sweet fruits, but there is a big pepper presence that stings the nostrils a bit. The taste has an even bigger peppery spice presence on top of the fruity hops up front and the yeast in the background. There is also a bit of bananas in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is pretty dry and peppery for the style with a bit less sweetness than I would expect. This is another unique offering from Dieu Du Ciel and one that has a strong spice presence to mix it up a bit. Very good."
"D- Well here you have it. I haven't sampled much from this style considering we like our big beers-and BSPA is my favorite style. The other pale Abbey Ales I have tried don't measure up to this one though. This has everything I like about BSPAs and Tripels w/o as much Alcohol...therefore perfect drinkability. French Canadians sure do know how to make their Belgians."
"Pours a nice yellowish gold with big lasting soapy white head. Smell is lemon, some peppery spice and belgian yeast. Taste starts hoppy, lightly bittered, and clean with orange peel and lemon, and then finishes a bit yeasty and musty. The hops give a nice citrusy quality that brightens the belgian yeasty flavor I'm not typically crazy about, and makes this a pretty solid beer for me. Nice and crisp and lively mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"Hazy deep gold with a constant stream of bubbles supporting a dense, fine cap of off-white bubbles. After slowing settling to a thick collar, foam clung to the glass and stuck there through to the end. Aromas of honey and spice, wheat crackers and lemon were evident, along with notes of fruit, bread and floral hops. Sweet honey malt flavour too, with spice growing into the finish. Light lemon character, wheat and bread, some fruity esters. Medium to light bodied with a rich, creamy texture. Quite dry in the finish. Great stuff, very refreshing with enough complexity to stay interesting."
"Pours hazy golden with three fingers of pillowy white head. The aroma is floral, definite pineapple, nice peppery phenolics. Nice spicy flavour. Firm bitterness and copious English hop flavour keep it very crisp, while the Belgian yeast notes (pineapple, pepper) carry over strongly from the aroma. Some alcohol. Silky and light on the tongue. Slight acrid dry hop character, almost tobacco-y. A beer of delicate but exceptional balance - a Belgian blonde with the hopping of an English summer bitter. Not a style-maker; just a perfect bent beer."
"Pours a foggy gold. Frothy creme head. The nose is a real thick doughy, spicy, perfumed concoction. Flavor is ripe with character. Lots of dough and spices and yeast funk. What's odd is the butterscotch aftertaste I get. Feel is smooth. Drinkability is high even though it's dough and spice forward. Robust and full of character."
"D - A pretty easy drinking beer, slightly strong at 6.5%, but delightful and worth a try to anyone considering a taste. A style I feel is so easy to drink when done well-especially in summer. This is no exception."
"Feel is light-medium body with plenty of carbonation. It leaves nothing in the mouth though, very clean finish. Drinkability is decent, though the hop bitterness is a bit aggressive for an Abbey-style blond."
"Poured into a Unibroue tulip glass. Appeared a gold amber with a massive cream colored billowing head that lingered for a great while. Smelled distinctly of banana along with spices and bread. Tastes starts with a little bread/grass then peppery spice then a bit metallic and finally hop bitterness. Very well-balanced. Mouthfeel is great - good carbonation, glides over the tongue and has some bite. A very fine example of a belgian blonde."
"The body is light but highly carbonated. Leaves a strong carbonic bite that enhance the spiciness. Overall I would have like less spice and more Belgian esters."
"Drinkability is fair, it's not a chore to finish this one but it is very aggresive. I would recommend splitting the bottle (and the cost) with a friend. A fine beer, much better than the Corne, but still looking forward to the peche and their spiced rye beer."
"Nicely executed by this Canadian brewery, very much akin to the finer Belgian hoppy ales."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, refreshing."
"D: I really liked this beer. Take a BPA and thoroughly dry-hop the crap out of it with US style hops. I gotta get up to Montreal!"
"The aroma is very good, similar to Unibroue house yeast or maybe a little like St Bernardus Tripel. The taste was good if a little bitter, it was definitely rich with esters and spices (probably actual spices of some kind instead of due to hops, but difficult to know for sure). Very good and drinkable, very good for the style."
"hazy orange pour that becomes a little cloudy after the whole pour. big fine white head, that never disappears and leaves nice lacing. weird, the bottom of the glass is clearer with the dregs staying at the top of the brew. wow I love this smell. Spicy and citrus candy. Taste starts sweet and turns dry, bitter. kind of fizzy. got to let warm a little. more spices coming thru, clove, yeasty sweet fruits. pretty interesting, not my favorite style of beer and kind of pricey but worth the experience"
"Flavor is spicy too, mild bitterness and clove in the aftertaste. Curaçao orange peel, light pale malt or wheat softness. Citrus lingers, pretty pleasant overall. Yeast and hops are played-up a bit. Not too heavy, I could see having a couple of these."
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a bubbly white head. Seems like its a little over carbonated, gives me a few inches of head then subsides back to a cap on top of my beer. My first whiff of this brew right after I opened the bottle was of citrusy hops. That disappeared after I got it in the glass, could be an anomaly. In the glass I smell a spicy peppery bready yeasty brew. Taste is yeasty peppery bready as well. The carbonation of the beer actually seems a bit light, weird! Medium body with a dry spicy finish. Good brew, I could drink a few of these."
"Pours a hazy golden with a nice head that settles to a cap. Smells dry an with noticeable white pepper a touch of sweet smelling malt and some banana at the end. Lots of white pepper in the flavor as well as a good deal of fruity esters and some sweetness. The spiciness somewhat overwhelms the sweetness however. Smooth mouthfeel. This is fairly enjoyable but not quite as sweet as I would like, or perhaps just too spicy for the sweetness that is there to really be enjoyable. Nevertheless, it is not bad by any means."
"Pours a hazy golden straw with a funnel of bubbles rising up the middle, leading to an enormous fluffy white head in spite of a light pour. Smells sweetly of candi sugar with a touch of pear and clove. Some faint mustiness and teensy citrus notes. The sip is similar, with a touch of apple and a number of herbal and floral notes that my palate can't quite pick apart from each other. Clove is definitely present, a bit of hibiscus, some tangerine and orange rind May be a touch heavy on the bubble gum in the back, but light and complex overall with no element too dominant. Finishes quite bitter for the style. The mouthfeel is creamy with some prickle, just a notch too syrupy. Smooths out in all senses as it warms, though alcoholic esters do pipe up. All in all, not half shabby version of a Belgian Pale. Dieu Du Ciel's two for two for me."
"Only one, yet fervently robust column of bubbles rising to the top of this beer amidts a summery golden pale yellow with maybe a touch of copper. The head could use some more staying power though. The aroma is a light touch of banana, a hint of hoppy peppercorn spice, and some sweet yeasty fruits greet the nose. The taste has a strong yeasty profile that makes the malts stand out even more. Some bananas, cloves, and maybe even some honey mixed with some peppercorn hops make for a unique Belgian style pale ale."
"Light golden color with a full, wispy head of foam. Authentic Belgian smell, some dough, light fruits, farmhouse character. Quite vibrant. Lots of taste, with expressive citrus and herbal hop notes, hints of fruits. Nice Belgian character as well. Very full bodied. An impressive brew."
"Belgian Pale Ales often leave me a little non-plussed (Orval as the huge exception to the rule), as they seem to lack the complexity of the bigger brothers. Not so with this example, which achieves a fine balance between North American levels of bitterness, and traditional Belgian maltiness. Dieu du Ciel keep producing these fantastic beers, and I keep drink them. Not a bad state of affairs."
"D- Easy to drink, would go well at a BBQ. However, I wouldn't buy this again as it isn't my personal favorite style or taste of beer."
"Poured from the 11.5oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Body is a honey-orange color, crowned by a half-inch of creamy white head that leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Nose is mostly light pale malt, with some peppery notes lingering in the background, along with a touch of citrus. Palate is mostly light sweet malt, with peppery and citrusy notes and very light sugary sweetness on the finish. Body is creamy and smooth, just about perfect for the style. This is a highly drinkable, true-to-style beer that's quite enjoyable. Another great offering from Dieu du Ciel."
"12oz single bottle purchased for $2.29 from Metro Joanette (probably) in Montreal. Pours a perfect cloudy light gold with good head. Fabulous aroma of hops and yeast. The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell though. First sensation is tanginess on the tongue, and the beer goes down with yeastiness and some spice. Quite nice."
"Drinkablity was average to me as a Belgian Pale Ale (or IPA for that matter), as the heavy hops cull the quaffablity.Still, I enjoyed it enough to savor the last few sips for as long as possible. At $5 a pop I probably won't be revisiting this to often, it was very interesting and I'm glad I gave it a try - another strange brew from Dieu Du Ciel."
"Recommended..."
"Overall, a surprising little brew that lacks just a little kick to stand its ground with the made in Belgium ones. Nonetheless, I will seek it out in the future as I was pleasantly surprised. A good representation of the genre."
"Of the six Dieu Du Ciels I've tried recently, this one was far better than all but the Peche Mortel."
"Flavor is predominantly belgian yeast driven, taste is much like a Duvel, exept a tad more bitter. The finish is all hops and alcohol. Alcohol aromas and flavors a quite perceptible, but not overbearing. I'll bet a year in the cellar would round this beer out nicely."
"Drinkability: In an attempt to fit in more around these parts, I've given more and more Belgian ales a try. Sadly, though, this one failed to win me over."
"Définitivement pas la meilleure offrande de la brasserie Dieu du Ciel, la Dernière Volonté demeure une bière de qualité pour ceux aimant le style."
"Pours a hazy golden/amber, loose white head forms, big bubbles, solid layer, doesn't want to leave, some nice lacing on the glass as it drops. Smell is great, caramel/honey, bread, yeast, biscuity malts, spices, wheat, nice floral and fruity esters, spicy hops, excellent. Taste is excellent as well, very sweet caramel malts, yeasty bread, wheat, light banana and spice, very fresh floral/citrus character, very dry finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation, refreshing. Just as good as I remember it on tap, great Belgian pale. Thanks Martin!"
"Bottle: Poured a deep dirty yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with perfect retention and some great lacing. Aroma of noble dry hops with some nice Belgian style malt. Taste is really dry and is totally dominated by some floral and dry hops with a nice Belgian malt structure. Body is above average with some limited filtration and perfect carbonation for the style. I believe we are just missing some wild yeast and we would have a perfect score."
"de belle couleur blonde, trouble à souhait, on dirait qu'elle est au blé, la mousse est insipide, le nez est bizzare, on ne sent pas les épices, en bouche le goût est prononcé, il est fort, très amère, on goute les houblons, houblonage à froid, ce qui lui donne un goût de vert. ce n'est pas ma préféré."
"Cloudy yellow, good head, lace. Good carbonation. Dry hoppy finish, citrus spice yeast, medium mouthfeel. Mondiale 2005 where they were generous with sample sizes. Satisfying Belgian Pale. Nothing disapointing from this brewery, but this was an over-the-top highlight."
"Taste: Grassy, almost milky mouthfeel, with an excellent hop aftertaste and lip smacking dryness. I think they tweaked thier recipe, because it used to be only 6.0% and I don't remember it being so hoppy. Fans of Hommelbier would enjoy this one."
"Another excellent offering from Dieu Du Ciel. This one was a dry hopped abbey style Belgian pale ale. This was a nice light golden colour with a small white head that lasted for a while and left nice lacing. The aroma was of nice hops, sweet malts, and various yeast complexities. The taste was hoppy up front with some lovely sweet malts and biscuity notes in the middle. The mouthfeel was medium bodied>thin and the drinkability was pretty good. Another winner from DDC."
