"O- mostly sweet and malty with lots of woodsy notes, but not so much bourbon.  it all seems to mesh well though, I enjoyed this one"
""

""
""
"Very mellow but smooth with subtle fruit flavors. Goes down easy. Really like this a lot."
""
""
"The Rest:  Very interesting.  The Belgian yeast is very pronounced and lends a ton of character, but the barrel aging is pretty muted.  Other than being a bit flat, this is really drinkable for over 9%."
"Overall, this is a nice take on a Belgian IPA, I just wish there were more hops to it."

"D: This was a really interesting brew, with a great balance of bourbon character and hops. The body was a bit thin, but the finish was really smooth with well hidden alcohol, so it was easy to drink. Fantastic."
"Poured from a 750ml bomber.  Half a finger of head that dissipates quickly.  Pours a golden orange that's opaque.  Aromas of orange citrus, hops and slight pine.  Delightful citrus orange on the tongue with very little pine bite back.  Very mellow.  Hints of horrible Bowman's cheap bourbon but it seriously tames the IPA into a truly delightful and drinkable beer.  Dump the Bowman's for Two Brothers and this would be the best DIPA ever.  Expensive and tastes like it."

"enjoyed with some friends over thanksgiving.  a friend who cannot stand barrel aged beers or hops actually found this quite tasty.  not saying that this was the only positive comment, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one as well.  great blend of the two styles (BA and DIPA).  Sure wish I could get more Hardywood in Colorado"

"Incredibly underrated beer. It's very decadent and doesn't try to kick you in the face with hops.  The barrel adds another layer of complexity to this amazing DIPA. So smooth, rich, and well balanced with amazing aromas that are followed by the taste. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who can get it. Well done Hardywood. A+ in my book."

"Hardywood repeatedly sets the bar at a higher level."

"Big whiskey and vanilla flavor with a hoppy citrus spike towards the middle.  Touch of toffee flavors.  Excellent beer and the best I have had from this brewery so far."

"O: A nuanced beer with a good mix of barrel qualities, strong malt character, and moderate hopping to bring a lighter feeling, more subdued but flavorful BA DIPA."

"I get the bourbon barrel aged part, but missing a bit on the IPA side, perhaps.  It's a nice bourbon barrel ale, a bit dry, and maybe I am missing something in the balance (which I try to applaud in most beers, to debateable success), but the beer seems a bit pedestrian.  Even writing that seems harsher than intended.  I will say that the price relative to other beers seemed unjustified, but if I ignored that, I would grab this again in the right situation."

"So aside from the fact it comes off like a clashing mess, where is the Belgian character in this? Neither hop driven, nor even very well complimentary barrel forgiving. This just doesn't work."

"The idea of an IPA in a bourbon barrell seemed odd but it really worked as it cranked up the honey like sweetness and thickness."
""
"Overall: I am not a big fan of Bourbon treatment in hoppy beers though I have had a few that I have enjoyed; while the aroma of this one was promising, it was just too Bourbon dominant for my palate"
""
""
""
"O-not generally a fan of barrel-aged DIPAs but this was a good one, nice balance and depth of flavor"
""
""
"Overall cant say i loved this one. A decent beer..."

"O- The nose on this one is fantastic, but for me, the booze takes over way too quickly. If I drank this blind I would say it was a barrel-aged barleywine. There are not too many DIPA characteristics left in this beer, and the Belgian yeast was hardly noticeable."
""

"Overall - A really big, complex and strong beer. Very bourbon forward, with some decent hops. There's no way I could tell without reading the bottle this is a Belgium style ipa. The whiskey aspect is big, bold and dominate. This makes the balance of the beer suffer some. Its really warm too, the alcohol is as present as the whiskey is. Theses few issues is what keeps me from rating the overall higher. None the less, this is super tasty if your into barrel aged beers with loads of flavor."

"M - Medium body. Slightly oily. Fairly dry overall. Light carbonation."

"O - There is a lot going on in this beer...on one hand there is a fresh, green, grassy hop character of an IPA/DIPA, a firm sweet malty base loaded with caramel and toffee flavors and noticeable alcohol component of a barley wine, and the addition of bourbon barrel aging giving more complexity with woody, boozy, earthy and vanilla flavors. This all varies at times throughout the bottle between working well together and missing the mark a bit. Overall, I am enjoying this beer, but recognize there are some minor flaws."

"O: Overall a good brew. I dig the hoppiness combined with the sweet combination of brew and barrel. A great beer to crack open to celebrate!"

"O - Overall this was an excellent beer. Glad to try it, was nervous due to it not being fresh but those hops held up wonderfully. Well done Hardywood!"
""
""
"Overall great! Not much else needs to be said except a lot of great flavors combined well that balance each other for a big drinking beer that's tasty and smooth at the same time."

"Big thanks goes out to beeruser and funkydelic for sharing this one at a recent tasting! Served from bottle into a Sweetwater 15th Anniversary snifter. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, earth, earth hop, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, earth, fruit, caramel, and vanilla. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I went into the one not really knowing what to expect if I am completely honest. However, what I found was a very pleasant all-around brew that had a nice touch of complexity on all aspects. It maintained all of this while still remaining refreshing. I probably would not have been able to guess that this one was in a bourbon barrel, or any barrel for that matter, but that didn’t change the fact that it was quite tasty. Really glad I got the opportunity to try this one with good company. Even if you don’t have the good company part, I still suggest you trying it. Tick."
