Pours moderately hazy bright orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, peach, guava, pear, tangerine, lemon zest, citrus rind, clove, pepper, floral, grass, bread, light banana, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of peach, tangerine, pineapple, pear, guava, lemon zest, citrus rind, clove, pepper, floral, grass, pine, light banana, light bubblegum, bread, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine/floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, pineapple, peach, guava, clove, pepper, light banana, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, yeast, and malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 16, 2013"

Aroma of oranges, grapefruits, mango, pineapple, and a hint of Belgian yeast in the background. Smells very sweet. Vegetal raw hops are the first thing you taste, yummy. Flavor is sweet orange rinds, some light grapefruit and mango, and interesting dry Belgian yeast finish, and then lingering orange rinds and grapefruit left on the palate for a good while. Bitterness is very present on the way down, nearly puckering. Big, heavy, and slick with medium carbonation. This is pretty unique and very nice.","BMMillsy","Nov 11, 2013"

It's slightly Belgian, I suppose, but I guess I'm just used to those walloping Belgian IPAs brought on by Brewery Vivant. A floral spice (like clove) is the first thing I notice, then it turns into a sweet sort of citrus, and by the end there's a nice malt balance. This is still a very good beer, and I don't find that floral sort of flavor over-powering, so this is something I really enjoy. Not NEARLY as bitter as I was lead on to believe it would be.

4.46,8.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall I thought this was a very good beer and very good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style and it all came together very well with some great balance. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, and the taste did a great job at holding my attention and It kept me coming back for more, I could see myself being pretty happy drinking a few of these and I think this would be a great summertime beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the taste and aroma, they were both very good and I couldn't stop smelling and tasting it. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there's not a single thing that I didn't like or would change, it's great just the way it is. I would for sure buy this beer again, I bought my limit of three and if there's any left next time I go to the beer store I'm sure I will get my limit again and I will for sure be getting it when they release it again next year. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or anybody who likes hoppy beers in general. All in all I was very happy with this beer, it was just as good as I remember and so far I think it's my favorite of the style, I like it a little more than Brewery Vivant's Trebuchet, I like the hop profile in this beer just a little more. This made for a great 700th review, it was a nice treat to celebrate this milestone with such a great beer. When I was at Shorts I told the bartender that I really think they should bottle it and apparently I wasn't the only one since my wish came true. Thanks a lot for continuing to give the good people from Michigan exactly what they want, there's no doubt Short's is my favorite brewery, keep up the good work guys.","StoutHunter","Oct 17, 2013"
