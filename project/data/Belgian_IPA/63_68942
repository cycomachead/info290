4.42,21.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Another beer that I would guess the style but is really good.  This one does not have the amount of hops that I typically associate with a Belgian IPA.  What it does have is a big burst of fruit and juiciness.  Taste is peach, coriander, wheat, Belgian spices, and slight earthy hops at the end. All of the flavors seem to pop.  A very light and semi-sweet beer.  This is one I could drink several of, especially as it gets warmer. Really well done.","tigg924","Mar 22, 2015"

3.75,2.7,4.25,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"This beer poured a nice opaque gold with about a half a finger of head and persistent lacing. This was an approachable Belgian ale, not overly sweet or acerbic but balanced with a refreshing but astringent impact on the palate and a moderate, mouth-coating feel. The aroma isn't strong, more characteristic of a Belgian, not at all piney or hoppy. Thoughts of lemon, white raisins, coriander, and mild cloves are evoked. IPA seems a misnomer; to even call it a pale ale is generous but regardless of genre it was an enjoyable and very refreshing brew.","mdexter","Mar 01, 2015"

It's really cloudy, a lot like a wheat, but mellow and at the same time very flavorful, which isn't always the case with straight wheats.  And it's not as hoppy as most straight IPAs.  As such, I liked it a lot more.  Apparently I'm now a fan of white IPAs.","dcscientist","Jan 13, 2015"

3.5,-4.1,,,,,,"This pours a semi-hazy color with some floaties and an frothy off-white head. The aroma is very citrusy for an IPA. The taste is light and very clean with lots of herbal and citrusy note. This is an intriguing brew from Deschutes with a very unique taste for the style that either be a hot or miss with the drinker.","Lemke10","Nov 10, 2014"

Perfect amount carbonation; just enough to quench your thirst. Very drinkable and fresh. Overall, I felt like I was drinking a Belgian witbier, saison, or even a German hefe because of the spice and coriander that is quite common in those beer styles. I think this particular beer's style is interesting; it lives up to its name for sure; the combination of an IPA and a witbier definitely hits the spot. I could easily knock back a couple of these at a summer bbq. Solid beer, give it a try.","Jsteez","Aug 01, 2014"

While I'm not "wow'd" by it, it offers enough to keep me satisfied throughout the duration of the glass. Including IPA in the name feels like a bit of a stretch to me, considering the hops hardly play a role, being dominated by the Belgian white spice influence. Hair-splitting aside, Chainbreaker White IPA is a refreshing spin-off of both the witbier and IPA, respectively, and could easily find its way into my cooler during a summer BBQ.","ThePaintedGrey","Jun 27, 2014"

The flavor has spices, bread, coriander, citrus peel bitterness a bit of candied lime, soft coriander/lavender notes very herbal middle, and the sharp wheat notes make it all work together so well on the palate. Great food and beer pairing would be some mahi mahi fish tacos off the top of my head. Mouthfeel light to medium bodied slightly creamy texture from the wheat base, and has a nice dry spiced finish nothing over powers the other aspects of the beer well balanced White IPA...I believe Chainbreaker is a trailblazer.

4.51,23.6,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.25,"I was excited to get this started, especially after really agitating it in the bottle, per the label's instructions. This resulted in a LOT of foamy, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving so much sticky lacing behind that I may be forced to break out the jackhammer, despite planning to run the dishwasher later. Nose was really spicy, like coriander, black pepper and even perhaps some saison yeast. I want this in my mouth! Yeah, yeah, that's what she said, ad nauseum. Color was a cloudy lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) and when combined with the head atop it, it looked like a slice of lemon meringue pie. Mouthfeel was effervescent and the melange of hops and spices was riotous. I was reminded of a recent Law & Order: SVU episode in which a woman was performing fellatio with a mouthfeel of Pop Rocks. This beer is probably what that must be like although I have no personal experience. This was an exciting beer for this self-avowed hophead because it gave an all-new dimension to the style. The finish was dry, but not gasping as some AIPAs have been when saturated with hops. I like them, but this was new and different by comparison.","woodychandler","Dec 01, 2013"

Flavor follows as a combination of wit, tripel, and IPA. Light spice and bretted wit flavor, some yeasty honey and clove, and a crisp pine hop finish. Light bodied, high carbonation, really crisp.

Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, carbonation is fine-bubbled...sweetness is moderate. Its a fairly decent beer and a little different take on the Begian IPA style, but I wont be rushing out to buy a sixer anytime soon.","twiggamortis420","Sep 10, 2013"

Smells a lot like a west coast IPA at first and then the witbier like scents emerge. Flavors of pine, orange peel, slight coriander spice and Belgian yeast funk. Like a witbier and IPA crossed.

No light penetration really. The nose had lots of mute colors, mostly fruity esters of the yeast and some white bread. There were some subtle citrus hops, especially lemon and grapefruit. The taste had a little more bright notes to it. The fruity yeast was big on the palate and the lemons and grapefruit really came forward more than on the nose.

It gets a solid 4 out of 5 from me! So it's lacking a little in the hop department, and lacking a little head as well as the high alcohol content coming in just below 6.

Quite lemon-lime flavored with an enduring sharpness. Maybe they just use a lot of orange peel, and the hops do the rest. The hops are listed as Bravo, Citra, Centennial, and Cascade. Thoroughly fascinating brew, but I don't need more than one for the forseeable future. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Baron's Marketplace in San Diego.","mactrail","Apr 22, 2013"

The wheat backbone here is disappointing. Lacking in structure, it is limp and lacks that bready, crisp and slightly dextrinous definition that great witbiers have. Instead, it is rather loose and soft. A little watery on the finish, this beer is crisply carbonated (a little too much IMO) and has lingering flavors of spice and tropical fruit.

3.71,1.6,,,,,,"Overall (3.75), a nice quaffable summer beer. Belgian IPA is a pretty broad style, with a few subcategories--hopped-up tripels/strong ales, IPAs with Belgian yeast and hoppy witbiers all seem to qualify. This one is definitely in the latter most category, with the spicing and wheat grain providing far more characteristic to the beer than the hops. I drink this one every summer, but I do wish there were a bit more presence from the American hops. Maybe it would be more noticeable if this one were a little fresher. Based on Deschutes' 120-day time between bottling and enjoy by, this bottle was packaged on 6/26, making it over 45-50 days old. That said, the nice thing about this style is that even after the hops have faded a bit, it remains a good, refreshing beer.","LambicPentameter","Dec 27, 2012"

Tastes a bit bitter, mostly on the citrus side, and wheat, and yeast, but not detecting much of the claimed 'spices added.' Might be coriander but really noticing this much. Mouthfeel is fast, and wet, and fussy and refreshing...not heavy like some IPA's. I think the hops could be more aggressive, and complex to match the IPA label, but this is a good beer.

It has a really nice Belgian wit backbone. However, this is such an interesting brew I can see this one becoming quite popular given its uniqueness. Deschutes is so great at making the dark beers, this one in it's own way is such a well made beer I might have to give their other lighter beers a closer look. One of my absolute favorite breweries.

It doesn't have the usual hoppy taste that most I.P.A. beers have.... Instead, it has more of a crisp citrusy taste with notes of citrus in the nose of the beer....

The Belgian yeast overpowers some of the hops which tend to be too much for my palate in most IPA leading to a really powerful but not overbearing hoppyness. This is (as of now) my favorite IPA. Must be an IPA (kinda).","N3rdM3t4l","Apr 16, 2012"

Flavor is sweet and wheaty with a good bitterness up front and an interesting citric rind character on the finish with a witbier taste. Full bodied with hi carb and a dry finish. A decent beer, and one of the more approachable Belgo style IPA's I've had. Probably won't be found buying this one too often however.","harrymel","Mar 27, 2012"

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at Old Chicago's. Served to standard pint glass. The beer arrives a hazy golden/yellow that is fairly light. A 1/2 finger white head with some retention and lacing. A pleasant blend of citrus and spice on the nose with a hint of belgian yeast. Orange, coriander, lemon, pepper. Nice. The tastes again follows the nose with the citrus flavors and a more pronounced spice. Tangy almost in flavor with a medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean. Medium bodied with good carbonation. As I am not a huge fan of the Belgian IPAs I found this beer to be a good representation that was easy to drink and didn't overdo any of the flavors or characteristics and as such was pleasantly surprised. I would not hesitate in ordering another.","hopfacebrew","Feb 11, 2012"
