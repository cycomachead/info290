"If I wanted to drink something that tasted like a cheap bottle of chardonnay than I would buy a cheap bottle of chardonnay. I'd avoid it. I hate that beer has become so pretentious, and now we have people rating this sour white grape flavored beer with an overall score of 91 and 94!!!! Are you kidding me?"

"Overall, this is one of the most impressive uses of wine barreling we’ve ever encountered.  The chardonnay flavoring just pours off of the oak, blending with the warming, bold graininess of a surprisingly bitter base tripel.  The result is rather mixed however.  You find cloying sugars clashing with the most intensely puckering and bittering phenols around, all with this grapey wine and ethanol flavoring that never fully clicks for us.  The biggest surprise here is that nose.  It tends towards the wild side, more so than either a Belgian IPA or a tripel (it’s hard to nail this down stylistically, as so many things are mentioned on the bottle, contrasting with what we actually get).  That is probably why we felt so discombobulated through the flavoring and beyond.  You never quite know where you are with this beer, and it leaves you questioning your own basic knowledge of beer.  As our introduction to Nebraska Brewing Company, this has certainly piqued our interest."

"O- Need to do this next summer out by the pool. I feel like I'm in Napa Valley at a wine tasting. Quite enjoyable."

"So, I was at the Nebraska Brewing Co. last night and was told that they couldn't sell me this delicious beer. Apparently they received a cease an desist letter from a brewery in Tennessee with the naming rights to HOP GOD...smh. There will be NO more HOP GOD in Nebraska EVER!! So I called half of the liquor stores in the city before I finally found one that had a bottle, four bottles to be exact, bought em all. Best $80 I have ever spent. If you can find this beer BUY IT."

"Interesting brew served in a 6 oz glass at the White Oak Tavern in Ellicott City Md. Weak nose but citrus and grape must scents. Smooth mouth feel with minimal carbonation and limited bitterness of hops. Chardonnay flavor is noticeable with slight lingering aftertaste."
"O-enjoyed the barrel characteristics and the beer was very drinkable in spite of the abv"

"Hi, I bought Hop God Last night. You asked me to let you know what I thought. First, my nose is almost completely dead from childhood allergies, so I require a beer that really stands up to notice anything. This one does. Pours a beautiful cloudy gold, with a moderate head (I poured it pretty cold). Nice lacing, etc. First thing was, I got citrus on the nose. It's got to be strong, for me to smell at all. A little bit grapefruity on the tongue. It's hard to quantify the mouth feel, it's pretty bright and then hangs around with what I think is a citrusy aftertaste. There is actually enough going on with this beer, the hops aren't really the biggest thing, at least for me, but for a hop freak such as myself, they are still there. I don't think it said so on the label, but at 10 it's certainly it's a double. Also, it's clearly Belgian yeast, with some sour coming through. Anyway, I think the alcohol fits nicely, but I'm accustomed to drinking nines and tens anyway. All in all, I do like this beer. it's interesting – sometimes that's a curse I guess, but not here I think. If I had a complaint at all, it is that it's a little bit heavy on the citrus (disclaimer – I dislike citrus is in general). I would buy it again, though."

"O: The wine barrel aging lends nice flavors of Chardonnay, but this overpowers the taste of the underlying Belgian IPA."
""
"A pretty tasty brew here. There's a lot going on, between citrus adn malt and Belgian yeast and saison-like sensations. It's a lot to enjoy."

"O/D - Good. Intense and worth the time to sip it. Not as much IPA character as expected, but it was nice."

"Hazy, golden-amber pour, with a wispy white head and medium-sized collar; some tracks of lacing on the glass. In the nose, Belgian yeast and obvious Chardonnay aromas, herbal hoppiness and pale malt sweetness. Pretty much delivered what was promised in the taste department: Belgian yeast complimenting pale malts, vinous flavors, stone fruits, notes of oak and light hop bitterness into the aftertaste. Medium body, moderate carbonation, pretty easily drinkable, with the higher ABV well-concealed. Nice overall."
""

"O: Clearly, this isn't much of an IPA, Belgian-style or otherwise: the hops are only a slight addition here, playing second fiddle to the barrel character. This is a perfect example of an over-barreled beer - the base beer pretty much cowers in fear of the chardonnay barrels. It's a reasonable beer, but considering how much this brewery charges, I'm having a lot of trouble recommending this one (except to barrel lovers, that is)."

"this is a very interesting brew, my second from nebraska brewing, and as impressive, if not more impressive, than the apricot saison. the pour in this is hazy and more yellow than golden. it has an inch or so of pure white wispy head that settles a bit, but is easily reproduced with a twirl of the glass. the nose is more wild yeast than Belgian yeast specifically, taking on some late summer farmy elements. the hops aren't as in my face as I expected them to be in a beer named hop god. they are tropical fruity and citric, but not hardly bitter at all, which allows the complexity of the yeast to fully develop on the palate. some fresh cut grass in here, and some drying straw, its definitely a summer drink. very active carbonation and only a light malt body give this beer a lot of life, and the fact that it is over 10% abv is almost impossible to detect. this was a real treat, many thanks to claystation for sharing it with me! I have to get my hands on more of their stuff, both ive tried have been absolutely fantastic. this is proof that the Midwest isn't all bad..."

"Overall, if the taste of the beer had more closely resembled the aroma, this would have been an amazing beverage. However, on the tongue, the hops simply overwhelm everything, and combine with the high ABV to produce a hop-and-vodka martini overtone that so heavily dominates the beer as to make most of the other flavors quite difficult to detect. The beer is definitely out of balance because of this, to such an extent that even hopheads might have a problem."
"Starts with a rich barley flavor. Holding the liquid in my mouth, a subtle carbonation shows up preventing the beer from getting coy. Just prior to the swallow, the alcohol is notable, oily and warming. The swallow and aftertaste is all hop and alcohol. The hop portion is bittering without any strong spiciness. In a word: Complex."

" This is a very interesting blend of Belgian IPA with some wine-barrel influence adding to the complexity in general, very phenolic and bitter with some mild tropical and vinous elemments. Overall I was more than pleased with the flavor and intensity, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys hoppy Belgians, not over the top with bitterness to the extent that you can't get the wine barrel in the flavor profile, highly enjoyable."

"Although primarily a Brewpub, they do things right...If you are passing through...try it, if you can get it, buy it! Tyson Arp and Co. are doing really great things with beer!"

"A good DIPA with chardonnay notes is what it is. Maybe it took me off guard, seemed to get better as I went (I actually winced a little though, not something I do often with beer). I drank the 25 oz bottle over two days and enjoyed it more on the second. Perhaps it needed to breathe!"
""

"Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the IPA was a golden color with an modest white head. Retention around the sides of the glass evident. A wine-like aroma with a certain measure of hops dominated the aroma. In the interest of honesty, it smell more like wine than beer. The initial taste had a sour grape-like potency. It was not overly sour as to dominate the taste, but it was certainly at the front. Notes of grapefruit, peach, and the hops were also evident. The peach comes out a little more in the aftertaste, with modest grapefruit, yields to a warming sensation on the back of the throat. The mouthfeel was not as thick as I would have liked, but it worked. Overall, I am not sure Hop God was worth the price tag. However, I would certainly drink it again is somebody else picked up the bill."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour of malt, grain, citrus fruit, floral aromas, and some spices. Taste is much the same with a mild herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a better smell than taste in my opinion."

"Overall: I have had mixed results with the previous Nebraska beers I have tasted but this one really delivers the goods; definitely worth the high price of admission"

"Superior drinakability for the style & ABV, I love the American slanted hop attack of this beer! First bber from this brewery, I am blown away..."

"D: Complex, definately a sipper. Avoid if you do not like chardonnay. Share the 750 with friends."
"O-I am really impressed, I typically find the Belgian IPA style too abrasive and contrasting with musty yeast and citrus hops. Not sure if it is the oaking on chardonnay barrels or the fermentation staying at a lower temp limiting the ester blow off but this is so polished, well integrated and an absolute pleasure. I will buy a few cases no matter the cost next time I am in Nebraska. Excellent work Nebraska Brewing Company."

"It's quite likeable, though a bit odd and I'm not sure what style/category it should really be in. However, if you like sours or you like chardonnay (as I like both a lot), definitely try this one for a special occasion sometime, with sophisticated beer drinkers ONLY. If you're expecting some kind of bold IPA you will probably be disappointed."

"An interesting and quite tasty Belgian IPA from Nebraska Brewing Company. Definitely worthy of a try."
"overall i wasnt a big fan of this one, the chardonnay characters took over to much."
"Overall: I was not a fan of this beer at all. The flavors were not something I found very drinkable"
"Medium bodied, above average carbonation, and there is a sweet aftertaste. The alcohol is not perfectly hidden, but is hidden pretty well for 10.00 % abv beer. A bit expensive to buy, but still very good."
"[96/100]"

"Overall it's different yet nice. Not something I'd want to drink on a regular basis by any means, especially for the price. But I think it's a well thought out and executed beer."

"O - Very good Belgian IPA. Has a bit more of the IPA character than the Belgian side but its still an ok beer. A - Pours a very nice deep gold color with a nice 1 inch head that is white and quite dense. The head recedes quickly down to a thin film and ring around the glass with a nice sticky lacing to it. (3.5)"
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a blast of dry earthy hops up front that linger over the earthy oak and sweet fruit notes into a slightly dry, lingering finish.  Hints of pine needle as well as some prominent lemon citrus and apple flavor.  The barrel presence is pretty strong with notes of dry toasted oak and a powerful vinous white wine character. Lots of vinous grape and white wine which compliments the fruit from the hops and Belgian yeast.  Subtle alcohol but easy to drink with decently masked ABV.  Hops complimented by oak/barrel and citrus complimented by estery fruit notes.  Pretty good.  4"
"D - Nice one to try! I enjoyed it."
"Ridiculously drinkable for a big, hoppy, barrelled up something-or-other. Hits all the right notes, & the use of the wine is simply divine. Original, tasty, hoppy - damn, this is superb. I'm going to nurse the rest of this one with a smile on my face."
"A very interesting treatment to an emerging style. Love the dry chardonay finish. Nebraska is definitely growing on me!"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and dry but with enough body to support all the complexities this beer has to offer. This is a big beer and it is assertive at times but very complex all at once."
"I paired my second pour with beef tenderloin bites wrapped in bacon and I felt like royalty. This is a classy brew - very complex and strong - a great (as my beer guy called it) celebratory beer. I'm curious what the Hop God regular/non-reserve must be like. Hats off to Nebraska Brewing for quite an achievement."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is pretty decent. The alcohol is well hidden, the flavors are nice. I can appreciate the complexity. I would like to see how this one would age."
"One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Top 3, hands down. My first Nebraska, and definitely not to be the last. WORTH EVERY GOD-DAMNED RED CENT! POSSIBLY THE BEST BEER IN AMERICA."
"750 mL bottle shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a hazy brass color with a light-tan head. Aroma is pretty much pure chardonnay, not getting a lot of IPA or even beer character out of it. Big apple/pear, perfume and alcohol. Flavor is buttery oak up front, then a winey fruitiness, some round esters and yeastiness and a tannic, bitter finish. Comes together pretty nicely but it's not very recognizable as an IPA of any sort."
"Shared this one with the group at the ""Evening Wood"" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, banana, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, banana, fruit, and fruit hop. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. The barrels on this one were not very pronounced if I am completely honest, which was kind of a disappointment... However, the flavor profile on this one was quite nice with the chardonnay coming across as a part of the fruit character in this one. I really enjoyed this one, just wish it wasn't so expensive..."
"This beer pours out as a lightly hazy golden color. The head is pretty good on this beer despite the barrel aging. The smell of the beer is pretty interesting, it's god a good amount of hops on the nose but it also has a a lot of spicy and barrel aromas. The taste gives us the hops upfront with a nice floral and citrusy flavor. The bitterness sets in and then the barrel aging flavor give off a light tartness. The mouthfeel is about medium bodied, the decent carbonation. Overall the price of these beers kill me. I hate paying for an entire bottle of these because they're always more than $20. If the was was lower I could probably enjoy this a bit more. All in all though I like what they did with this beer and it did taste good."
"Let's get in on some wine-barreled BIPA, baby! It pours a minimally hazy amber-straw topped by a finger of dirty white froth. The nose comprises orange zest, coriander, banana, honeydew, and white grapes. The taste holds notes of mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, melon, clove, banana peel, red grapes, and light oak. A sharp bitterness bites at the back o' the tongue. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice BIPA, definitely something to experience."
"Overall: Not recommended at all. Bad flavor. Dumped."
"O- The great blend of Belgian yeast, Chardonnay Barrels and a Tripel is a great combination. Dry mellow oak and fruity grapes and green pine hops really work well together."
"Final note: as the beer warms it's becoming even more mellow and drinks like a velvety citrus juice that is being dripped into your mouth from a piece of oak. Yes it is good."
"Bottle: Poured a deep hazy dirty blonde color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma is a complex mix between a dry hoppy Belgian ale with some sweet notes mix with some light tart vinous notes. Taste is quite complex with notes of sweet Belgian style malt with dry hoppy notes and light tart vinous notes. A bit lacking balanced with more vinous notes would have been better. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very interesting experience though maybe lacking a bit of balance."
"Outstanding craftmanship.Wafting wine and hops. Looks great though a light colour. Full mouthfeel. Very satisfying, with the patience of 6 months of barrel ageing, is it a double IPA or a great white wine.Thanks Michael for this and all you have done, and our wishes for your complete recovery."
"D - A suave and sophisticated sipper... As a fan of Belgian IPAs, I wish there were more... There also aren't too many Chardonnay barrel-aged offerings... This is a tremendous marriage of the two... Unlike anything I've encountered in beerdom... Highly recommended... A very unique offering..."
"O- A nice beer that is very enjoyable, a bit of a sipper. I would not seek this out again but would drink it again if I had the chance."
"This was a very interesting brew that I really enjoyed drinking once. I am not sure that I would drink it regularly if it was available to me, but for a one time sipper, I really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable and complex beer. The dry finish helps with the drinkability, but the sweetness might get to be a bit much after a while."
"Pours a moderately-hazed orange-copper color with a nice white head and a bit of lacing as it falls. The nose brings some tropical and citrus fruits plus a good dose of oak and chadonnay. The taste is quite the improvement with some nice hop flavor and a bit of grape skin and oak. Finish is quite bitter with some nice oak tannins filling things out. Medium body. Overall, quite drinkable and certainly one of the best, if not the best, barrel-aged IPAs that I've come across."
"The beer appears crystal clear and light orange in color. The head stands in at approximately an inch thick, and displays lasting retention. As the cap recedes it leaves a healthy dose of lacing on the glass. The aroma is really wonderful, with a lot of barrel scents coming through prominently. The flavor is very good, but not quite up to the level of the aroma. The taste is very tannic, as the wine barrels really shine through. The hop aspect is there, but is a bit overshadowed by the French Oak Chardonnay barrel. That being said, the beer is pretty well balanced, and surprisingly drinkable for what it is. Frankly, I did not expect to enjoy a barrel-aged IPA this much. The feel is medium bodied with a solid carbonation level. A blend of hops and barrels lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer is complex and interesting, and I would certainly have it again. Best shared and / or enjoyed in small quantities."
"The beer is relatively thin and the finish is REALLY dry. At the finish there is some moderate hop bitterness but there is also a tannic quality to it. It's strong but not detracting. Overall, the wine comes through in this one slightly. It's a decent beer. The malt backbone probably could have stood out more as well as the hop bitterness but since we didnt' have the base beer I don't know if the original was more hop forward before the exposure to the wine barrel."
"I would say that the mouthfeel makes this beer surprisingly drinkable, especially since I found it to be a little bit boozy. It is a very interesting beer, and the tartness makes it pretty enjoyable to drink. It's not one of the best beers I have ever had and for $27 I probably would not buy it again, but it was definitely an enjoyable beer to share and discuss with fellow BAs."
"Overall, this was a great beer. I wish I could have drank this a few months earlier because I think the hops would have been more present and tasted even better. However, I highly recommend this beer it is delicious."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden orange color with a plume of bone white froth, great retention and sticky lacing. Scent is of belgian yeasts, citrusy hops and hints of peppry spice, vanilla, dry chardonay and oak. First sip brings a hard taste of belgian yeasts and alcohol, smooths into a pleasent citrusy and tropical hop note, as the malt begins to present itself, the flavors of peppery spice, dry chardonay and oak steal the finnish. Medoim bodied, active carbonation, very dry. An interesting beer that is definitely as advertised, would have like the alcohol and belgian yeast flavors toned down a bit (as in Raging Bitch and Cali-Belgique) so the other flavors have a little more time to shine."
"D: At 10%, the ale is big and bad. Moderation is the key to surviving it. Me? I'll split it with ksak and hope for the best. The very nice blend of Belgian IPA and a barrel."
"D: This is quite a drinkable beer for 10%. I had this beer when it was first released and it has changed beyond recognition 6 months later."
"A hoppy Belgian in a chardonnay barrel ... look at where beer has gone. This beer's epic head sticks all over the glass as its weathered golden color shows a perfect clarity. Tartness from the barrel, spice from the alcohol and slightly pungent hops make for a very complex nose. Smooth and creamy, the hops jump in with some bitterness and late-to-the-game flavor that lingers. The alcohol is spicy with a hint of tropical fruit. Wood and wine flavors are prevalent from middle to end. This brew's maltiness is thick and bready. Some damn tasty beer ... and dangerously drinkable for its size."
"D - Quite drinkable for a double digit ABV beer, would be even better if it were better balanced with hints of oak aging rather than having aged in an oak forest fire."
"Reviewed on 4/2/2010. Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of Belgian yeast, grapefruit, citrus, orange pulp, sweet grapes. Flavor is sweet and fruity at first and then melds into a pulpy orange finish like you just took a bite out of an orange and got some pulp and rind with it. Lots of woodsy notes as well, which reminds me a lot of Fred from the Wood. I can't say I really got the Chardonnay; it just blended with the citrusy, fruity notes. Quite tasty overall, very impressive coming from a brewery I hadn't heard of before."
"Too much going on, I wouldn't drink this again or recommend it."
"D - This was solid. I split the bottle with two friends and we didn't have a problem finishing it. Still, I probably wouldn't explicitly seek this out again."
"Hop God Belgian-Style IPA (Aged in Chardonnay Oak Barrels) is beer that will make the palate of any self-respecting beer geek weep for joy. It has everything that I like in big beer... and nothing that I don't. Time to make a trip to Papillion to see what else these guys can do. Thanks a million, Eric."
"D: This was a complex and delicious beverage that seemed like half beer and half wine, but all wonderful. It had a nice silky body and hid the alcohol decently, so it was easy to drink but preferable to sip. A true testament to superior brewing skills, reminiscent of Midnight Sun's 3767."
"D: ABV is noticeable as it warms. Flavors and scent are very good, but begins to be monotonous as it goes on."
"Very interesting and complex brew."
"HV"
"Oak shows nicely with thick oak wood tannins on the finish. Hints of grapefruit, with a good amount of loam and earth, peach, apricot, pear, honey suckle, bitey belgian spice and yeast character, moderate carbonation and thick mouthfeel. Clove, with a starfruit like bitterness. Quite a tasty complex treat."
"The beer pours a cloudy golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma is oak and Belgian yeast with some light wine notes. The flavor is Belgian yeast, oak, citrus fruits such as orange and pineapple and a nice bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a murky golden orange color with a fantastic tight white head that left lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is tart and wine like due to the barrel aging. Fermented apple skins, lemon and oak dominate the aroma. The flavor follows the aroma, tart apple skins which melts into a slightly sweet pale malt, nice subtle oak flavors play very well with the rest of the beer. I can detect the Belgian candi sugar but most of the hops and yeasty goodness is hidden by the oak. That being said the sourness and sweetness come together well. A moderate feel with good carbonation, again the sweet and sour balance each other out on the palate. Perhaps a light grassy hop pops through towards the end. I'd probably like to see more yeasty flavor and a touch more hops but the flavors are quite good and mellow. Its different and its good."
"This complex as hell. An excellent beer. I highly recommend this."
"I raise my glass!"
