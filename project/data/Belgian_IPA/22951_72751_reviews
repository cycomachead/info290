"O - A very enjoyable beer.  I was put off by the strong hops aroma because I was expecting a tripel, but the beer is complex and interesting.  A good mix of US IPA and Belgian characteristics."

"This poured a nice translucent copper colour with a thick white head which turn a creamy mousse like.  The extensive  bubbles created a almost fire like quality when held up to the light. An nice citrus happiness to the smell along with some light grassiness.  There is a definite malty sweetness to really balance out the nose.  Wow, the malt really comes forward in the mouth.  That doesn't mean there is no hops like you'd expect in a tripel IPA, just not the punch in the face you might expect.  And that grassiness sticks around in the mouth with almost a honey sweetness as well.  That alcohol warmness you'd expect from a 10.5% ABV is there but not in mouth burning way.  Awesome beverage.  A very well balanced IPA."
"This is one of those beers that I say ""this is not for me, but I'm glad I tried it"" I more of a stout guy, so maybe I'm not being fair on my rating."

"This ale surprised me. I didn't expect such goodness with their attempt at a style twisted hybrid. First off, it's a beautiful beer. The look is a rich, murky amber with a thick, tight froth from a moderate pour. Cracking the bomber emits very nice aromas. Rich pine trees, sweet citrus, background of dates and funk. Yup, a mix of IPA and Belgian. Flavors are still good, if not quite as appealing as the smells. Immediate hit is that of a quality IPA, followed by an almost clashing Belgian style (to me, more of a dubbel) and then drifting into a strong DIPA-like fade. Individually the flavors are all of apparently high quality.  I'm just not convinced the flavors match so well side by side. Mouthfeel is excellent, with just the right carbonation to match the IPA backbone. Overall a very good beer. I'd buy it again. For those Clown Shoes brews that are mediocre, this one definitely stands quite a bit higher, IMO."

"O: If you are expecting an IPA/Trippel merger you will be disappointed. It is far sweeter than any of those have a right to be. Despite that I really enjoyed it...would never drink more than one in a sitting (and even more than about 12 oz is an ask) but a truly unique flavour. Would wish for the hops to be more prominent and the yeast to be more authentically Belgian, if that makes sense. But would still drink again."
""
""
"Not at all what I expected... Poured a gorgeous, extremely hazy orange-ish color with a nice rocky, off-white head. Tasted wonderfully citrus, tangerine-like, with a touch of clove. Very good flavor. I drank one that was a little over a year old, so not sure how much of the flavor can be attributed to that. Oops."

"Nice tripel"
""
"Bought this with hopes it'd be a great combo of my two favorite beer styles.....but it's not that great.  Lacks the smell I hoped for and doesn't taste at all like a Belgian Tripel - mainly just boozy high alcohol content taste"
""
""
""
"O- Clown shoes is theoretically a very good brewing company- and when executed correctly the ""Belgian IPA"" is my favorite style- but it is important to note that this is a belgian tripel/IPA which I perceive as a hybrid between american IPA and tripel...which is much different than an intensely hopped BSPA, saison, or tripel.  There is way too much sugary sweetness to this brew...and the hop/belgian blend is just executed poorly.  I was really looking forward to this brew but I am very disappointed."

"Bomber poured into a tulip glass. A hazy yellow-orange amber with some frothy off-white head that breaks down quickly to leave some creamy lacing rimming the sides of the glass. Intense medicinal/citrus/herbal aroma, a marriage of resinous hops and fiercely spicy/sour Belgian yeast with some big peppery notes. Like this brewery's Clementine white ale on performance enhancers. Tons of clove, licorice, and burlap sack phenols do battle with grapefruit, navel orange, lemon, and menthol cough drop to yield a pretty pummeling taste experience. Clown shoes has some pretty skanky Belgian yeast in their arsenal and they aren't afraid to use it. If in the mood this is great stuff, although I became satiated rather quickly and was pleased to share with some buddies, one of whom could not get past the initial sip while the other described some flavor notes like orange spice tea. Indeed, recalls an unsweetened orange-lemon creamsickle covered with coriander and cardamom seeds. Body on the thick side of moderate, a tad chewy and reasonably smooth. Carbonation quite bold and this enhances the ""sour"" citric effect. I think I prefer the less citric Tramp Stamp but this is well worth sampling if one is addicted to Belgian IPAs or the spicier tripels."

"Tried this at the weekend. I was at the Brewdog bar in Shoreditch and brought a bottle of this to take home. Another fine example of those crazy American IPA's. Full bodied with incredible malty sweetness, then a tsunami of hop explosion across the palatte. The sweetness reminded me of the Belgian Tripel Karmeliet. Great beer, would definately drink it again."
""
""
""
"The taste is about what the aroma predicts it will be with a definite grapefruit citrus character, floral and pine, and a lesser malt sensation that almost tends to outlast the hops on the finish."

"22oz bottle poured into tapered glass. Beer pours relatively amber in color for an IPA, with a massive orange creamsicle colored head. Huge, tropical hop aroma is immediately evident. Pineapple, papaya. My sense of smell is not at 100% today but this really is one of the most fantastic smelling beers I've ever cracked (assuming you can abide the lack of citrus / pine cones). Flavor is similarly tropical. I think this might be the fruit punch of IPAs. And as promised, there's a good dose of Belgian yeasty goodness, throwing a well-placed curve ball into the brew. Orange peel and bitter orange soda mixed in there, too. I imagine this to be a really fresh brew. The flavors are strong and definitely unconventional, and I could easily see the flavor being divisive among connoisseurs. I commend Clown Shoes for the novel concept fabulously executed, but still I'll admit the flavor isn't exactly all beer, and I find it a bit tiresome after a while. Which is probably for the best given the well-masked 10.5% ABVs."
""

"M/O: Just a little thin and abrasive at times; then sugary sweet at others. Strange. I don't think I'd have another, but I'm glad I tried it."

"Mine was ""Bottled 2/2012"" so I seized the reins and went with a nearly inverted pour! I think that my judgement may have been rendered compromised at that point in the day. My overly aggressive pour may have stirred up some sleeping beasts. I got a dense finger of tawny head from my ridiculous pour, but at least, it had good retention. Color was a slightly-hazy, deep-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13). I apologize for th lack of clarity as there probably had been some settling. Nose was odd and I got aged sharp cheddar cheese, fusel alcohol and candi sugar. Remind me, why did I feel the need to gild the lily and open this beast? Mouthfeel was medium but it brought the heat. Whew! There was no doubting its 10% ABV, but that might have been low, actually. Once the initial fire subsided, I began to taste a sugary fruitiness, which they called ""candied fruits"" and ""intense"" and I was not going to disagree. Finish left an alcohol burn that reminded me just how the length of my esophagus is laid out. I felt like a flame swallower with the circus! Dry? Gaspingly so! Pour me another, Justin. I am feeling rather poorly at the moment."

"For a Belgian IPA, this is good. For an all around enjoyable brew, it's so-so, the faults inherent in the style exacerbated by the extra sugary notes introduced by the brewer. Whatevs, it goes down better than I would have thought, is hoppy and boozy, and those spicy-ass tacos (love ya, Mom, thanks for having put the 'life' in larger than life) cooking in my kitchen will make an excellent pairing for the rest of this, methinks."

"Deep clear golden hue, craggy white head that clings to the glass. Sweet sugary, dried, fruits, apples and apricots, faint tropical fruit, clove and spices. Sweet slick full mouth feel. A little syrupy. Honey suckle, sweet breads, tropical fruits and citrus, with some yeasty undertones and a touch of bitterness. Sweetness overrides though and to call this an IPA or hoppy is far off. Booze is heavy in the finish and while some bitterness exists, it lends to a semi-dry finish, with a long lingering sweetness. As a big boozy belgian blonde, this beer has lots of complexity with well blended flavors and even has a bit of complimentary hop. To call is a belgian ipa or a hoppy belgian is a little off though. Good beer, just misleading"

"Not what I would say to be typical of the other BIPAs Ive tried, this kicks up the spiciness and a lot of strong citrus hoppiness to it. The finish in particular was not all that dry and mostly spicey. Certainly a flavourful beer, the high strength makes it a bit of a different profile and its not all that sessionable really, but the spiciness and yeast character are quite pronounced. My first from Clown Shoes, wasn’t a knockout but I would be interested in trying some others by them."
""
"Overall- I love a good Belgium beer but at 10% ABV the alcohol takes too much of the taste. The fruitiness is lost behind the bite."
""
""
""
""
"The light to medium body has a nice, even softness and fluffy smoothness all the way through without giving up its crispness at any point. It sort of skirts either style."

"Pours into a chalice with a deep slightly hazed body, big off white head flowing thick. Fine Belgian style lacing in this Belgian Style IPA from the folks at Clown Shoes. Aroma is full of spicy yeast character, citric notes from the big hops, hints of coriander and citrus peel as well. There's even hints of cotton candy, tropical fruit notes...think mango/papaya action, with big luscious bready malt layers. Flavor profile a hint of acidic notes from the citrus peel but a super sugary sweet experience, you better have your sweet tooth craving before cracking this decadent dessert like beer. Big flash hop profile, layers citrus fruits, tropical fruit especially mango/pineapple/papaya with a touch of black pepper and full on yeast phenol party. Hiding in the mix of all the flavors going on is a bruising 10% alcohol by volume, hard to believe there's absolutely no heat in the chest with each sip maybe a bit of warmth on the palate but it's well hidden. Mouthfeel is big chewy and on the edge of cloying, healthy dose of natural feeling carbonation saves all of the sweetness from becoming too much along with the hop bill of big alpha acids to dry the palate enough to achieve enough balance. Overall a big interesting beer that I'm glad I caught, by chance while out hunting for some 3F's Zombie Dust in a remote but well stocked beer store in south central Ohio."
"Top of the Muffin to You! The exclamation mark is definitely needed. Muffin Top is an excellent Belgian-style IPA that has bold elements of both Belgian yeast and American hops. Ironically enough, Clown Shoes don't joke around - don't let the names and labels fool you, many of their beers deserve serious consideration as being top examples of their respective styles."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I know they were going for a more americanized version of the classic style but I don't think it worked out well."

""

"Eh, I really wasn't on board with this one. Just didn't fit my flavor preferences, I guess. I do like Belgian ales, and well made tripels, but something about this one just wasn't cutting it for me. Hope you like your Belgian ales spicy and minty, because that's what this one is all about. The almost-hot alcohol presence wasn't helping either. Not awful, but not a constant rotator, either."
""
""
""
"Very delicious! Didn't have the hops flavor I expected, but I tend to like less hoppy beers. Don't know how they made a belgian trippel IPA, but I like it! Tried Clown Shoes at a beer festival recently, and can't wait to try more of what they have to offer. Haven't been disappointed by any of their beers so far..."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/3/2013. Pours lightly cloudy bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, pear, banana, clove, floral, grass, pepper, pine, honey, light caramel, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pear, banana, clove, floral, grass, pepper, light pine, honey, light caramel, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, light pine, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Belgian IPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop, malt ,and yeast ester notes; and very smooth to sip on for 10%. A very enjoyable offering."
""

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer, and decent example of the style, the Belgian yeast worked nicely with the hop profile, they seemed to complement each other, but the sweetness and bitterness seemed to overpower those when it came to the flavor and that made this beer a little rough around the edges. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, fairly filling, and the 10% was apparent, but the flavors did an ok job at holding my attention, but I wouldn't want another one and I think this would be a good beer to split since it may become a choir for me to drink a whole bomber. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they were both very good and the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and drinkability, they were just a little rough around the edges. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there's a few other Belgian DIPA's that I would rather have and I don't think I would really recommend this beer. All in all I thought this beer was decent, there were some aspects I like, but there were some that I didn't, it's defiantly not my favorite of the style, but it's not a bad beer, it just needs to be cleaned up a little. Tramp Stamp is still my favorite beer from Clown Shoes, but there's still many more of their beers left for me to try,"
"Has a flourishing off-white head that sticks to it like a champ. Hazy golden orange and pretty. A sharp resinous aroma hits the nose and we're off to the races, followed by notes of caramel, orange peel and grapefruit. Fine and dandy so far. The bitterness loses a length at the tongue and the sweet and tangy notes catch up, evening thing out to the end. Not as in-your-face as the label would like you to believe (surely a craft brewer wouldn't hype on a label for marketing purposes) but fortunately this one kicks it out on all fronts and ends up being a very well-balanced and tasty brew despite itself."
""
"Overall-Not bad, the scorchy bitterness throws me off a bit but still worthwhile all in all."

"O: an odd hybrid brew, flavors are more belgian strong ale that IPA"
""
""
""
""
"O: very good but I'd trade a lower ABV for better disguised alcohol. nice complexity and flavors with a solid hop kick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very solid and unique beer. Surprisinglu the belgian tripel and IPA mesh well IMO. Only knock is that it is sweet and it stays sweet. Might be too much for some."
"O: A solid big Belgian IPA. I have no reason why a bomber of this costs 13 bucks, a $5.50 pint at Happy Hour is much more reasonable."
"Poured an inch of foamy head on a hazy, copper colored body. The aroma was a mixture of citrus and barnyard, pretty good though. The taste is moderately bitter with a mild sweetness and a mild bitter finish. The texture was soft with moderate carbonation. Easy drinking for the high ABV and tasty."
""
""
"Well balanced but has a noticeable alcohol kick. I wasn’t totally into the flavor profile; Loads of honey and loads of grapefruit juice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"cloudy yellow in color, small cream color head that turns to a nice lace on top. The smell is of malt, hops and a citrus background. Not to bitter. Nice mouth feel with the taste just like it smells. At 10% you would expect a stronger alcohol flavor, but it is pleasantly missing. Very easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky honey orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spices, and some candied fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pity the smell is so good but not the taste. Need fewer IBUs to allow the other flavors to be sensed."
"Overall – It tastes better than it smells. My bottle is from Feb 2012, so maybe this would be better fresh. Still good, just not great."

"Pours a golden hue with a creamy three finger head and similar lacing,the smell is bready belgian yeast,a slight tartness,bananna muffins,grassy hops and a touch of sherbet,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of lemon sherbet,a touch of funk,belgian bready yeast,peaches,boiled candy and finished with a grassy herbal bitterness and overall its nice and very drinkable but no standout cheers."
""
""
"O: If you don't like a lot of bitters, this may be too strong for you. A good spring or fall beer."
"Overall: This is my first taste of a triple style hybrid (no pun intended). It is really interesting, and quite balanced, but the niceties of the styles are lost amongst all the complexity. The alcohol (10% ABV) is notable nowhere in the drink, which is a victory for what is already a very refreshing beverage. It is unfortunate that I am drinking it in the middle of winter, as it would really fit better as a summer beer. Clown Shoes did great with the idea, though there is definitely room for improvement. Pick this one up if you see it on the shelves; it is more than worth the chance. 16/20"
"Pours a very cloudy, golden orange color with a medium-large white head that goes down slowly. Scent is somewhat floral at first with Belgian yeast and fruity esters. Banana with a hint of clove, orange peel, orange juice, and grass. Not as hoppy as I was expecting this one to smell. Hops are pretty mellow, whereas the floral and Belgian yeast aromas dominate. Taste is just as it smells. The Belgian profile definitely overpowers the hoppiness this beer is supposed to have. Not necessarily a bad thing. Flowers, yeast, hops, spices... Pretty spicy. Pepper and clove. Hoppy bitterness with a ton of citrus... like drinking some hoppy orange juice. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick...almost juice-like. Alcohol is well-hidden. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer. Great option for Belgian beer lovers who are merging into the hoppier stuff."
""
"Smells and tastes like candied orange peel with a side order of peach preserves and medium amounts of yeasty phenols and booze. Actually, the nose is a bit hotter with booze than it seems to present to the tongue, and the nose has more coriander than the flavor does. It's really sweet in an odd way, however, more akin to a Tripel than the bottle's claims of Belgian IPA-ness. In fact, overall, it presents as a mediocre tripel *because* of the overly citric hopping and as a poor IPA for the same reason. This beer is good evidence for why three-way mixing of styles tends to be risky business, the most common result is mediocrity."
""
""
""
"Hazy golden body with a fluffy off white head. Lace is minimal. Aroma brings bright citrus and bready belgian yeastiness. Some alcohol on the nose as well. Flavor is pretty good, but the heat is noticeable in this one. Also get the bready,cakiness and birght hop tones. This is definitely a Belgian IPA kicked up a notch. I actually prefer a straight Belgian IPA....like their Tramp Stamp for instance, to a higher alcohol version like this. Good beer, but definitely a sipper."
"In the mouth the citrusy hops become steel bright, with a scaffolding of zucchini bread malt. Hence, the name, ""Muffin Top""."
""
""
"Overall: full bodied.the high abv adds nice depth. Nicely balanced citrus, malt and sour."
""
"O: I liked it. I liked it alot. As if someone took a pretty good tripel and tossed some hops in. It's got complexity, but remains really scary in drinkability for the ABV. Good job Clown Shoes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a nice light copper body with a minual amout of head that lays down quickly. The smell had a nice citrus and belgium yeast aroma to it. The taste was kinda citrus and sweet up front then the hop bit came in around the middle to back of the tongue. The mouth feel was great, nice an smooth and overall this is another great belgium ipa."
"pour is dark reddish copper, rather hazy with a tan bubbly head. Nose is a bit of stale rye bread with a faint spice to it. The hops are green and earthy but very light. The taste is bigger and the hops come through more. There is sticky malt and notes of caramel underneath. Hops are citrusy and herbal with faint bitterness. There is a bit of grain underneath with a slightly syrupy body, moderate carbonation, and prickly on the tongue."
""
"O: The tripel style is really the main focus of this beer, with a nice addition of hops that barely justifies the IPA part of the label simply because of the large influence of the malts and Belgian yeast. Unlike most American Belgian-style IPAs, this one actually focuses much more on the Belgian aspect. Definitely respectable. If you're really looking for an American Belgian-style IPA from this brewery, go with Tramp Stamp. This one leans more on the Belgian side. Very nicely done"

"A pretty good marriage of Belgian and hops. Each sip was like manna, one can think Belgian or hoppy. Very good drinkability. Light coloured with lots of head. A bit aggressive carbonation, otherwise middling mouthfeel. Bottle from Winooski. Lemony, and yeasty. Pleasant."
""
"Hazy darker orange, dense offwhite head - thick lacing and fantastic creamy retention. Nose has lots of citrus/orange zest, candied malt flavours and big dry, Belgian yeast qualities. Hint of spice/clove but the American hopping and the yeast (moreso) is right at the forefront. Taste has dry yeast qualities upfront, some melon, subtle spice and bitter/herbal and citrus hop qualities. Touch of raw banana. Full feel, no alcohol (just barely) and drying. A big yeasty beer all round, fairly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a large tulip glass a hazy peach infused lighter golden with a sticky large white head that settled slowly into a frothy mass.Yeasty phenols,overripe fruit,and citric/medicinal hop flavors,the yeast gave off quite spiced element.Again yeasty spiced flavors upfront with the hops giving off a sharp lemony note,sweet alcohol and more spiced phenols in the finish.This is a yeasty BIPA normally not my thing but this was decent,still not something I would search out again."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a cloudy caramel amber, nice fine two finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, pine hops and Belgian spicing, smells good. Flavor is very malt forward, caramel malt, strong bittering hops and mild Belgian spices. Flavor is understated but well integrated. Finish Is malt with very strong bittering hops that seem to concentrate on the back of the tongue where there is no real herbal hop flavor, but a lingering hop bite. Interesting subtle flavor to start, but the finish is a bit on the astringent side. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess; good mouth feel. A well made imperial IPA that tastes good but could use some more herbal hop flavors and a bit more flavor in the finish to balance the hop bitterness."
"D - A good beer. In the middle between a Belgian IPA and a Tripel; I'd have preferred it more if Clown Shoes had committed to either one or the other."

"O: Very impressive beer. Everything balances well, with the flavors flowing into each other and mellowing out as the brew warms. Really impressed, Clown Shoes is becoming one of my favorite new breweries."
"O: This is a very interesting styled beer, not quite what I expected from the Belgian IPA - more like a Belgian tripel merged with an IPA. I enjoyed the flavors and found the beer pretty easy to drink. I think the flavor is quite refreshing and one I would be happy to have again."
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange color head is white and creamy looks like a nice beer overall... Smell is of a very sweet fruit maybe a sugary orange??? I expect a certain level of sweetness in a belgian but this is somewhat surprising. Not off putting overall but surprising... no hops on the nose... Taste is slightly sweet not nearly the sweetness you get in the nose and there are definitely hops present. Very interesting indeed... ooo and there is the 10% alcohol on the back of the tongue leaving a boozy mouthfeel... In the second sip getting a little more of the orange I picked up in the nose and you can definitely taste that beer has some alcohol in it... again not off-putting just very obvious but I don't mind tasting my alcohol a little bit... Overall a good beer would drink again on tap to give that a try."

"O/D - A very interesting beer of little style designation. I thought perhaps this would be a tripel, but it clearly pulls through the hops. However there isn't enough yeast notes to make me think Belgian IPA. The result however is pretty tasty - reminds me of some japaneese beers surprisingly."
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a large white head. The aroma is quite floral and candy-like, with some pine and orange citrus notes, as well as some biscuit malt notes. The flavor is very similar. I get a lot of floral and orange notes from the hops, along with some pine, Belgian yeast and biscuit malt. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"Great tasting beer. Plenty of Belgium and American pride mixed in a bottle. Full Mouth, citrus, earthy flavor. Consistence Drink from the front to the back end. ABV is obvious! 10% +.... Very good Pour. I was hesitant to try the new Clown Shoes Brewery, but I'm glad I did. Vampire Slayer's next. Cheers!"

"O: A solidly made, drinkable brew."
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, it’s certainly not as good as the regular version and is proof that “Imperial” doesn’t always make a better."
""
""
"Overall: The dueling tastes in this beer were a bit distracting. The herbal notes and the hops were a bit extreme, and that resulted in a slightly confusing taste. Not my favorite, but still pretty good."
"O: I'm pleasantly surprised by this beer. It's a big beer, but the flavors are solid, and it's really drinkable. I don't know if I'd want more than one bomber in a sitting, but I'd buy this beer again if I was in the mood."
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer. It's definitely one of the better Belgian IPAs that I've had. It has balance. It's smooth and drinkable. It's not overly flavorful, but it doesn't disappoint either. I will probably have this again."
""
"The flavor was biting, and the bitterness came in thoroughly (which isn't a surprise). I was right about the begian helping with the over-hopping. The balance wasn't correct though. Just don't let this beer warm too much, it really falls off if it hits room temperature."

"Fresh bomber poured in a duvel tulip. Somewhat hazy orange with a foamy 2 finger white head. Eventually it recedes leaving a foamy center that actually resembles a muffin top. Aromas are yeast, bread, orange zest, pumpkin spice. Flavor is bread, Belgian yeast, orange, grapefruit, fall spices. The mouthfeel is chewy and there is noticeable alcohol as expected. Pretty decent. This is my first clown shoes offering."

"O- Overall, I love the label. The beer is pretty solid as well, definitely worth a try! "
""
"Very ""stick to your tongue"" hoppiness, true to the triple IPA, and the ""Belgian"" in it brings on a yeasty, bready sweetness. Nice copper color, and clingy lacing. If you pause a while, there is a spiciness that lingers in the nose. Very good for a hop-head like myself. I am sure my wife would hate it!"
"Poured a clearish dark gold hue with one finger offwhite head that left lace on top of a strong aroma of yeast and cnadi sugar, touches of caramel malt and bitter citric hops. Strong citric (tea and grassy as well I guess) hop presence, along w/ yeast give it that typical Belgian smooth/orange citric zest (minus the peppery clove spices). Medium-bodied, filling, goes down easy, balances with sweet malts although other than a sugary caramel swirl I can't really pick it out. Finishes balanced and crisp with a touch of sweetness and the ABV is kept at bay. Not the most complex or greatest Belgian IPA but I really enjoyed this."
"Overall - A really nice Belgian IPA, a style I'm usually not too fond of!"
""
""
"Poured into a large wine glass, it pours a light yellow ochre color developing a one inch head that dissipates quickly; very little lacing is left. First sip, the hops bittes my palate, I can taste traces of citrus, tamarind; hops are dominant in the aftertaste. I like this, packing a 10% ABV I think I am going to have another cup...and keep drinking BEER and SUPPORT your local brewery. HOG"
""
"O: a decent beer overall. I'd like a bit more hop presence and more carbonation."
""
"O: Overall, a good beer.  Starts off mediocre at best but finishes very strong.  Worth a try, and I would have again, but I'm not going to run out and buy the supply."

"Served in a snifter, a hazy orange-amber color with a small cap of foamy white head. Didn't get much in the aroma, but it was still nice, with scents of bready yeast, and citrusy hops. Taste was good: notes of bready yeast detected in the nose, citrus zest and fresh fruit, honey and malty sweetness. Crisp, sharp, dry finish. Higher alcohol was no more noticeable than most other IPAs I've had. Medium body, and fairly enjoyable."
""
"Thanks for the chance Berto!"
""
""
"D- I enjoyed this to an extent but not terribly blown away. It's good, but I won't be going for a 2nd glass, Is it an amped up version of tramp stamp, who knows?"
""
""
"Where the beer is tasty for the most part, the unresolved sweetness of malt and the abused hop profile keeps it falling short for either Belgian Golden Ales or IPAs."
""
"O: good beer, a bit thick and could be better if scaled back a bit in ABV and maltiness"
""
"O: Not a bad choice if you are getting introduced to the brewery. This is an american interpretation of a belgian IPA, which seems a little off the mark."
""
"Overall: A great beer, the hops are balanced by the malt and both are very present and forward"
"Overall (4.5): Damn. I did NOT see this coming. This is really an excellent beer if you ask me, and I’d be delighted to ever see it in a bar. Full disclosure, I picked up this bottle for about $1.50 on discount from my favorite local store, because they had bunches of it and it just wasn’t moving. I am so, so glad I picked this up. It’s a surprisingly solid tripel brewed with sweet orange peel and a shitload of hops; a Double India Pale Tripel might sound like a potential disaster, but evidently this was executed very well. Clown Shoes, please release this at least once a year, and preferably in 12oz 4-packs!"
"A word of advice: don't bother with it."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Ugly, muddy amber color, big mistake pouring all in glass - tons of floaties that don't settle plus a ton of yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose, sweetened grapefruit flavor, dry bitter finish. Disappointing Belgian triple IPA. $9.60 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
""
""
"Beer is a little dry on the finish, light in body, earthy, sweet, bready, biscuit, aromatic, nice. Carbonation dances on the tongue. A good Belgian IPA but nothing makes it stand out. Just another BIPA. But I really enjoyed it."
""
""
"Another Clown Shoes brew to prep for an upcoming tasting. It pours a partly cloudy sunset golden-straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises honeydew, pine resin, light balsa, grapefruit, orange zest, coriander, clove, banana peel, and sweet honey. The taste brings in more of the same, but the citrus fruits are now favoring their rinds and peels, bringing out a decidedly more bitter situation. It's not too bitter, but I think the new lack of fruitiness is a general detriment. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Overall, a generally solid BIPA, but one that falls just shy of making me really happy with it."
""
"D: This was a very nice IPA, but not very Belgian. It had an enjoyable scent and taste, with very good body. The alcohol was well hidden, so it was easy to drink. Maybe not one of the better examples of this style, but a very enjoyable drink anyway. I say give it a shot!"
""
""
""
"nope. almost, but not quite."
"Not the best Imperial IPA, but that's not what it is! I've only had a few Belgian-style IPAs but this is certainly one I'll be coming back to. This is the 4th Clown Shoes beer I've tried and they continue to impress me. I sure hope some Vampire Slayer finds it's way to GA..."
""
"Aroma is strong, fruity and yeasty with a hoppy note and just a hint of caramel. It pours a pretty clear golden with a fairly thick and fluffy ivory head that leaves substantial lacing. Fruity flavor is mainly apple with a note of pear and malty and yeasty tones plus a subtle hoppy undertone. Smooth, firm-bodied texture is edgy and lively, leaving a fizzy, fruity and malty finish."
"This style can be pretty hit or miss in my experience. Fortunately, this one is well balanced in taste and texture, and it's flavors really shine especially for the alcohol content."
"Its a pretty thick and smooth beer, very low level of carbonation."
"Bomber poured a cloudy gold with a lasting ivory head. Aromas of grapefruit, yeast, straw, candied orange, lemon zest, light mint and a hint of licorice. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of yeast, straw, grapefruit, lemon zest, ligt candied orange and light mint with a smooth dry bitter lingering citrus finish."
""
"An interesting beer that I might try and get fresher to see if the hops/IPA comes through."
""
""

"D - A little too sweet and a tad over spiced with orange peel."
"Gold/amber with some haze and a thin whitish cap. Decent head retention and lacing. Hops were apparent as soon as the bottle was opened. Fruit candy aroma, pineapple and citrus, dry malt and bread, hint of phenols and alcohol. Sweetness in the flavour was mostly caramel with some sugar and malt. Bitterness was more prominent in the finish, along with alcohol warmth and peppery spice. Grassy, citrus, a bit fruity. Full bodied, lowish carbonation, smooth, almost creamy texture. Not bad at all, but a little on the sweet side."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer, though the alcohol is so high that I am really drinking water to compensate. It dries you out a bit. Either way, this is good beer and if you are a big fan of American DIPA variations, you should definitely give this one a shot. That said, I wouldn't put it above Great Divide Hercules or DogFish 90Min, but still it is a good brew."
""
""
"O: The beer has a very interesting taste and has a much fuller bodied compared to other beers in the style."
""
"This is such a unique taste. There is a high alcohol taste and some wheat. There's a bite of watermelon. I'm tasting blueberry in there. The hops provide for a bitter after taste. Cotton candy taste. This is one of the most unique tasting beers I've had in a while. I can't drink too many, but it's uniqueness make it a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the first CS brew I've had, and it makes me want to try others. It is really an interesting take on the style, mostly because of the DIPA used. This is one of the harder-to-find CS brews, but it's definitely worth a shot for hopheads and pretty much any beer enthusiast."
""
"(Initially it poured very clear but I shook it up some to see if there was any sediment in the bottle and on my second pour it was quite hazy just as other reviews claim. And it improved the taste as well!)"
""
""
""
""
"O- Basically, a pretty extreme beer that didn't quite hit the mark. The alcohol is pretty well-masked but the hoppiness is a bit too much. I'll stick with the Tramp Stamp (as ridiculous as that may sound)."
"D-Clown Shoes is very sweet to this guy !!! you will never think this is a 10% ABV beer ...amazing"
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, bitter hops up front that lingers over the sweeter and spicy notes into a dry, boozy finish. The hop profile isn't as complex as the aroma suggests with only faint fruit sweetness. Instead, it's mostly dominated by a dry, earthy presence with resinous oils and grassy pine. As it warms I'm picking up more citrus, notably orange zest but it's still subtle. The slickness from the hops are complimented by candy sugar. Other than that there aren't many Belgian qualities. Finishes with lots of sweet, boozy heat. The ABV is not well masked leaving lots of warmth in the chest."
"overall, I'm not super impressed. too much going on and not enough focus on what it wants to be."
"O: Very enjoyable. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Belgian-style IPAs, but Clown Shoe's Tramp Stamp had made me a believer in the style long ago. Muffin Top carries on the tradition by taking the style to new heights and I found everything about it to be very enjoyable. Muffin Top is a delicious, complex brew."
"The feel of this beer is big but not too heavy. It has a complex feel and flavor that keeps you alert. Is a pretty drinkable feel and is a wonderful smoothness."
"Cheers!"
"Flavorful and tasty take on a well liked style. Smooth honey notes abound. Smoke, lime, more tropical fruit and yeasty phenolics. Well done, likely the best I've had from Clown Shoes."
"Notes: Another one aiming to define the range of a Belgian DIPA? Nice, quality, and provocative, I´m just not so sure this range is going to be much of a favorite of mine."
"Overall: a nice Belgian IPA that hits the spot. Easy to quaff despite high ABV. Sip this one slowly and enjoy the flavors."
"This one is a one hit wonder that fails to knock anything out of the park....it doesn't have much identity overall. The first real let down from Clown Shoes for me."
"eep golden, straw color coming forward right away. Nice two fingers of white foam quickly come up and over the top of the glass settling down with a nice amount of lacing that quickly takes over the glass. Very cloudy, even through the final pours. First thing I notice is the aroma of honey, lots of grains, bready malts and a noticeable amount of honey, whether intentional or not it is there. Grape skins start to come forward now as does a light touch of grass, nothing really bowling me over though. First sip is very smooth, rich and well carbonated the flavor is allowed to explore the palate quite nicely and really makes for a very full feel. Light grains, pears, peaches, apples, all seem to be well represented, but something seems to be missing with the depth here. Just not as full as I would have liked."
"The CPJ"
"750-ml bottl poured into chalice on 10-29-11. I think it was bottled on 9-23-11, so less than a month in the bottle. Pours a healthy orange haze with a decent white head. Smell citrus, orange to be specific, hops and yeast. So, here is where things get weird...It says triple Belgian IPA...and it is. Its basically a crazy hopped brew with belgian yeast. I taste hops, yeast, and orange. Its good, but heavy. Not amazed by it, but it is a pretty interesting take. worth a try, especially since its new to NY. Nice label too..."
"O - a good example of the style."
"A very good beer!"
"Picked up a local flavor the other day to sample. Orange in color, head retention was good. Smell a bit complex. Syrupy, sweet, , not bad. Not a huge BIPA fan , but not a bad offering.Overall, not bad prefer the other Clown shoes selection. Prefer OOmegang BPA as an alternative."
"One and done."
"Very interesting brew. Lots of orange peel and coriander smell. The taste starts off sweet, as expected from a Belgian tripel, but immediately you begin to get the bitterness of the hops (ipa). Really a fantastic beer, the alcohol isn't too prevalent. I don't review a lot of beers but felt I had to with this one, it's That good!!"
"Overall not bad but kind of a mess, mix of spices, malts, lemon and citrus hops, booze galore, esters, etc. it doesn't really know what out wants to be. Although despite all that its still fairly tasty, just not very drinkable. I know most Americans and hop heads will love this beer though, but I'm not really sure what to think of it since it's just all over the place. And not sure when I've ever had a Belgian IPA that is 10%, although this is more tripel than IPA I think."
"A definate try."
"O - Not really something I cared a lot for. Overly sweet, harsh, and alcoholic. Kind of hard to drink and the flavor profile is just a little strange. Pass."
"O: One of the top 10 Belgian IPAs that I've ever had. While I'm not a huge fan of this style overall, I think Clown Shoes produced a winner here!"
"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. Clown Shoes isn't kidding around when they say they added a tripel influence to this beer, but I feel it greatly overshadows the IPA portion, which I feel is quite weak when compared to the excellence of the hop flavor in Tramp Stamp. Combine that with the high alcohol heat, and you have a beer that is nice to sip, but I'd take Tramp Stamp any day of the week."
"D - Well - this beer delivers exactly what it promises, a blend of American hops and Belgian Tripel flavors. That being said, the alcohol is a bit harsh, the beer is too sweet, and I don't find this particular marriage of flavors all that appealing. That being said I can see others enjoying this quite a bit."
"Overall a fantastic brew. Big, bold, complex, very intense, definitely a sipper. Worth seeking out."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall this beer really surprised me in how much I liked it. It really did have some great hoppiness to it. Lots of juicy, fruity, hoppy goodness came out in it, and the little yeast spice was just enough to give it some character without overpowering it. A great beer overall and definitely my favorite beer of theirs so far."
"Poured into my Duvel VIJF 20 oz plus. Pours a thick hazy brown orange,with a bold 3 inch sticky cream colored head. Smell is clove, banana, grapefruit, orange, and little bread. Very bold, all those flavores, more aggressive than smell. The body is large, with a ton of life for this style. What I like about this Belgian is it has almost equal amounts of IPA as a Belgian. A ton of flavor and a wonderful BIG beer."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, lingering and sticky on the tongue, slightly creamy. A really nice version of the style, the alcohol is masked well, and plenty of citrus flavor."
"Overall this is a tasty beverage. Candy and hops melded into one and pretty big bitterness too."
"O/D-Clown Shoes is awesome. This one is an ass-kicker. This one will be sipped again by me. Eagle Claw Fist is probably still my favorite by Clown Shoes, but perhaps another bottle of Muffin Top could my rankings of Clown Shoes' beer."
"O: Goes down easy, quite tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden but big kick, interesting representation of style. This is a very interesting blend of belgian and IPA... enjoyable, but at 10% a bomber will more than do ya!"
"O - This is a fairly nice Belgian IPA. Not my favorite from Clown Shoes, and I'm not sure if I'd buy it again. Its a nice mixing of the two styles, and is nicely strong, just doesnt do it for me. I respect the offering though."
"Overall.. I love this beer. I'm drinking it as I type. Wish it wasn't almost gone..."
"O: Wow. Just wow."
"I don't exactly dislike Muffin Top, but I'm not sure this is a beer I'd reach for again. It was an interesting beer, though, for sure, and masked it's 10% alcohol with ease."
"Definitely a beer that packs a punch. One to be sipped and enjoyed. Very interested to see what happens to this over time."
