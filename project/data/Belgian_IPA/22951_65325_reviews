"Overall, looks nice and smells okay, but flavor and mouthfeel just didn't do anything for me. Aside from the amount of carbonation, there is little else to consider this a Belgian, no sweetness and no softness usually accompanying the use of Belgian yeast."
""
""
""
"Tramp Stamp has a glimmering look of golden copper, topped with a tall, fizzy white head. A deliciously sweet aroma delights my nose with apricot, grapefruit, and honeysuckle aspects to it. The flavor ultimately boils down to exactly what it sets out to achieve: an accessible and harmonious marriage of an American IPA and a Belgian Golden Ale. I never thought it could be possible to make hallmarks of a Belgian beer for the general beer lover. I have always imagined myself as unique in falling in love with strong flavors of Belgian yeast and fruit esters as a gateway to good beer. It seems like an acquired taste, second to the more approachable IPAs. But this beer combines the two effortlessly, and it goes down nice and easy. I see this as being a huge hit at bars and parties for all demographics in the beer world!"
"Overall-  there's a hint of unpleasantness in its flavor profile that keeps me from loving it. A good IPA and shall be purchased again."
""
"Was just okay for me.  Average beer, had it on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Very complex brew. This bottle is about 6 months old, but still has great hop presence."
"Slightly hazy, golden-orange pour with white clingy head - this is a good looking brew! Smells of citrus, pine, and some esters - mouth watering. Flavor is malt and biscuit with some of the citrusy hop, but not very bitter, almost sweet in a way. Smooth mouthfeel and clean finish - I’ll be buying more soon!"
""
"Overall - An enjoyable Belgian IPA on all fronts. The only minor knock would be to increase the belgian yeast taste (clove, banana) but that is a very minor adjustment needed in this one. I look forward to trying more of these guys offerings."

"Pours a pale amber color with an off white head. The smell is full of hops in front but with some sweet fruits and spices like banana and clove on the end. The taste was very nice with a lot of citrus and grass flavors up front from the hops and a very clean finish from the malt on the finish. Not bad and not too expensive, I'll probably be picking this one up again."

"Overall: This beer is well crafted, but there's a hint of unpleasantness in its flavor profile that keeps me from loving it. It has a lot going on, but it's not all perfectly executed. A nice beer, but a slightly imperfect one."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of fruits, yeast, some spices. Taste is hops, spices, citrus, some resin, balanced and tasty. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine and enjoyable beer."
""

"Single bottle from a 4-pack poured into a tulip glass. A rather dark cloudy ruddy orange amber with a finger or so of white foamy head. Darker than its double IPA stablemate Galactica but similar in the pungent hops department. Aroma and palate redolent with orange and lemon rind/juice, menthol cough candy, fennel seed/licorice cake, dry dusty burlap sack, turmeric, green bananas, pumpkin, fresh cut grass, yeasty vitamin tablet, and dandelion. I must say, this is one of those brews that truly strikes the balance between American hops and Belgian funk ... The Belgian yeast is aggressive but the hops keep pace admirably. Very dry, bitter, earthy, and spicy, equal parts apothecary's cabinet and citrus orchard. Finishes with ample pine resin like a strong American IPA. Moderate of body and quite highly carbonated, which is maybe not a selling point. Regardless, I am converted. Could be my favorite Clown Shoes to date."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pleasant enough Belgian IPA, the yeast and the sassy west coast IPA-worthy hops both clashing and working together at different times in the life cycle of this brew.  Uselessly provocative name aside, I gotta say I kinda liked this one, insomuch as this continues to be one of my least favourite styles."

"A: Hazy orange color. Some lacing lingers around the glass. A little head that quickly fades to leave bubbles  around the edge of the glass the whole way down. S: Citrus like smell. I get a slight sour smell almost hidden. T: Slight grapefruit. Not too bitter for an ipa. Get a little of that Belgian yeast taste, enough to let you know it's there, but not overpowering. Tastes like it smells. M: A slight spice feel to it. Little bit of sour near the end that lingers on the tongue. On the dry side. O: Not bad at all. This style is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Worth a sixer for sure, interesting name and label."

"O - really nice beer here, you have a fantastic balance of hops and orange-citrus zest, some malt characters, but a solid offering for a Belgian IPA. Not too sweet but not too bitter either, this is a solid beer."

"An incredibly good beer, plenty of bitterness & citrus flavours with a solid tropical fruit backing that was great. This one is a much try from Clown Shoes, I'm already looking forward to picking it up again sometime soon if I can."
""
"This tastes like an IPA, but calling it a “Belgium” anything is quite a stretch. It looks OK, smells like an IPA, and tastes like one too. I don’t pick up any yeast phenolics or spicyness."

"o. Very good beer from a very good brewer. Wow factor was missing so I could not move into the outstanding range, but I would revisit this beer."
""
""
"A weak Belgian beginning to the taste followed by an unbalanced tart/bitter after taste. The smell was pretty faint and didn't really help the beer much. The mouthfeel was probably the strongest feature of this beer but thats only if you can ignore the aftertaste. Maybe a Belgian IPA just isn't for me..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'll have to try more Belgian IPA's. Maybe I don't like the style? But North Coast ""Pranqster"" is a go to beer for me, and that's a Belgian strong ale. According to my review score and memory I gave Ale Asylum Bedlam! a better rating. I'm glad I tried this one out, but I'm glad it was a single. Not awful, but not my thing. Don't see myself seeking this one out. This was my first from Clown Shoes. This was a miss for me but I'll give them a couple more shots. That pecan pie bomber sure sounds enticing."

"Fluffy head, dimples deeply in a few spots, pretty much bone white, tight weave overall with good retention, the lacing comes in thick stripes, tends to move like flexible metal mesh. Bright, vibrant orange colored liquid, inclines more to red-brown than yellow, very clear and crisp looking, you see a fat bubble here or there. From a distance the nose is powerfully floral yet as you get closer more dominance in the well cooked bread dough, herbaceousness, sharper spices and pepper, moderate pine sap and likewise the peach, nectarine scents are quiet, takes a little opening up but there is a decent bubblegum component. Medium-bodied plus, foams up some in the mouth, carbonation big rather than prickly. As a result, it sits there and slowly percolates rather than flows. Spicy attack, ginger, cardamom, caraway then spiced orange peel, not getting a consistent yeast presence. Here too the peach, apricot, pear, apple flavors have minimal thrust, ending up in a drier texture. The bitterness not fully to be pinned on the herbaceousness, more like sour grains. Pine more present, the bubblegum to banana notes mostly retronasal than perceived as flavor. It’s actually pretty good and can easily be understood as a smashup of two styles."

"O - with craft beer so prominent and progressive today, this is nothing short of average at best. Small chance I'd buy it again."
""
""
""
""
"So did the booze, although I couldn't taste it. This felt stronger than it was in actuality, which was a testament to the ""IPA"" in this beer. While not the best example of a Belgian IPA, there was enough t like here and the body was more than sufficient to tie everything in together. While not memorable, this had the staying power of a tramp stamp without the accompanying tackiness. Worth a go once for anyone who likes this style or a hoppy beer that has the characteristics of a Belgian Pale Ale or IPA."

"The aftertaste is also robust - you don't forget it too soon. Overall it is a good effort from the clown people."
"Overall: definitely the best Belgian India Pale Ale I have had to date. Fantastically complex and less awkward than some others. Another well done to Clown Shoes. Great pricing too, particularly for a high ABV import."

"Medium bodied, well carbonated brew. Lots of flavor to the beer, and could pose a challenge to ipa drinkers not fond of Belgian styles. Overall this was an interesting beer, but probably towards the average range for the style."

"As far as I can tell, this is the same yeast as the Muffin Top, with a slightly downgraded grain bill. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm a fan of Belgian IPAs, and this one didn't disappoint. Sure I've had a few that were better, but I've also had much worse. I would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's ok. The flavors work well enough and I feel like it would be a good choice poolside on a hot day. However, the disappointing mouthfeel means I'll most likely bypass it more often than not."

"Deep copper orange in color with a deep haze that lifted a bit as this warmed. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Belgian yeast, caramel malt, tropical citrus and pineapple aromas. Medium bodied feel up front with tight aggressive carbonation through the middle and a thinner, slick, oily feel at the end. Spicy belgian yeast and caramel malt flavors up front with light tropical hop flavors through the middle. Finished with a malty and herbal, citrussy hoppiness. An easy drinking belgian ipa with well balanced flavors without much intensity. "
""
""
""
""
"Very nice easy drinking Belgian IPA. Not overwhelming or too intense but definitely plenty of Belgian characteristics and hoppiness present. Attractive orange-amber hue but below average head and lacing on my pour. Not quite as full or complex as could be, but a tasty beer I'd drink again!"
""
""
""
""

"O-underwhelmed unfortunately. Want to try other Clown Shoes, this left a little disappointed."

"O-nice example of a Belgian IPA, nice flavor"

"Overall - A decent offering. Wish it had more bitter hop notes then being as sweet as it is. Its easy to drink but not something id want to have all the time. Worth a drink."

"Poured out of the bottle a nice ambery tan, cloudy with a gradient. Hoppy smell is big and pleasant. Tastes clean! Not overly bitter, not filling. Floral, bright, and hoppy. Very drinkable -- could easily be a session for me. Pairs well with bar food. Worst part is the bottle design!"

""

"From my tasting notes: The beer poured an opaque orange that persisted throughout my tasting. The aroma had the signature Belgian yeasts with a bit of hop which is true to the style. The taste started with the sweet Belgian flavors that gave way to the bitter hops on the back end with a nice creamy mouthfeel. It was a great beer that was true to the style and was a great introduction to Clown Shoes. I will definitely be trying more of their beers in the future."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Hazy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Pine hops and caramel nose, flavor is a balance of pine hops and caramel, some bitterness at finish. $2.69 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"This was an easy f=drinking Belgian IPA, but not what I would expect out of that style of beer. I would drink again."
"O - I think brews like this are a great advance in perfecting the Belgian-IPA's; however, this beer was confusing. The Belgian and IPA styles were not harmonically blended. This brew seemed to be working against itself rather than harmoniously working together. It was mild on the hops, the Belgian style, the everything. All in all, it definitely is an average beer to me."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent beer, but when it comes to these belgian style american brewed hybrid wit/ipa's, I keep wanting more orange and coriander. Cleanly brewed with no off-flavors and pretty well balanced though. Well brewed."
"Overall: Should appeal to anyone who likes the idea of a hoppy Belgian Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, bright copper orange with a dense cream colored head, with long lasting retention and thick clumps of lace. Bitter floral and pine nose, Belgian yeast, bready and orange. Very sweet flavor of orange juice, bubblegum, lemon, pine bitterness, bready malt and buttery. Not quite a Belgian or an IPA or a Belgian IPA. Not bad, just generic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very intrigued by the description of ""Belgian-style IPA."" This pours a golden amber color with a foamy beige head. There is a mixture of citrus and hops in the aroma. The taste starts out as a yeasty/banana Belgian ale but finishes with that classic IPA bitterness. Very interesting and well made."
""
""
"O. Solid and fits the style well. Definitely worth a try."

"Had a pint at Newburyport St Trattoria. Had a few pints in fact. Nicebheadbon this beer with a mild lacing. Had a mild floral smell with hints of caramel. Surprised by how much I liked this beer. It has a great balance of malt with a great blast of hops. Not overwhelming, just balanced. Healthy carbonation throughout made it a quality drink throughout. Very good beer"
""
"Nothing off-putting or offensive with this one, but it's largely forgettable. There's just not a whole lot going on, and there's nothing really new or exciting happening. It's easy enough to drink, but whenever you're in the position to purchase this, there's likely something equally or more enjoyable that will be available as well. No real redeeming qualities, but not bad by any means."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty decent offering from Clown Shoes. Not something I would rush to the store for, but cetainly would not turn down if offered."
""
""
""
"The taste is sweet upfront followed by some bubble gum and yeast notes and finishing off with a nice pine on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is very nice smooth, leaves a little aftertaste on the tongue. Overall this is a really good beer and show off the style quite well."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and a nice example of the style, it had enough Belgian yeast aspects and hoppy aspects to represent the style nicely, and I thought the slight bit of funk in the yeast worked really well and it helped make this beer a little unique. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not filling, a little refreshing, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these especially on a nice summer day. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance they were both pretty good with the aroma being my favorite. What I liked the least about this beer was that the hop profile in the aroma wasn't more similar to the taste. I would buy this beer again when in the mood for this style, it does a good job of representing the style and I enjoyed it, I would recommend to anyone who likes Belgian IPA's. All in all I thought this was a pretty nice beer and it made for a good first impression of Clown Shoes, it was just an all around nice beer and I will for sure be checking out more of their beers, good job guys this is a pretty enjoyable beer."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, unreadable bottle date code. Pours very hazy deep orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, floral, light pine, caramel, biscuit, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Light pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian IPA! All around nice balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall - This is just OK, I get what they were trying to do but it tries too hard like InBev or something, I dunno. Not my cup of tea, a far cry from a masterpiece and not much testament to the Belgian style. Thumbs down, would NOT recommend. Unbalanced as hell."

"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours hazy dull golden with a thick white head and plenty of visible tiny bubbles. The beer smells of toasted malt, Belgian yeast, mild citrus, and some spice. The taste follows the nose. I get some nice citrus flavor with the malt and some of spice. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little dry. The drinkability is pretty high. This is a very good beer."
"This poured out as a deep hazy orange color with a white head on top. The retention is thin but the lacing looks really nice. The smell of the beer is a bit earthy, some subtle latex aromas as well. The taste has more of a latex flavor, earthy malt comes through pretty strong, there is a subtle orange flavor as well. The mouthfeel is carbonated and smooth. Overall it's a little disappointing, it had potential but it just doesn't hit the right notes."
"Too much carbonation."

"O: A well made tasty BIPA. Does it match the best, no, but a single is an easy choice. Something to buy again, though the label is quite tacky."
""
""

"Overall a great tasting beer with layers of recognizable characteristics and without the ""over the top"" hoppiness that makes you want to switch to another beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Thick swaths of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, earth, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and spice flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of citrus zest and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the yeast and spice presence is pretty intense in this one."
"Would happily drink again"

"O: Somebody put this in a six-pack! I’m in love. I haven’t had a brewery excite me this much since I started digging into Anchorage Brewing – and that’s saying a hell of a lot, believe me. The Blaecorn Unidragon in my fridge just keeps looking better and better…"
""
"O - This is not a BIPA for me. The style should have far more candied sugar, and Belgian yeast qualities and be balanced. This is a hop driven beer that could pass for an APA or IPA. The original style was developed by Belgian breweries and was distinctly different to traditional IPA's. Nonetheless a very nice beer in its own right. Had to mark down because of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent brew from start to finish. This brew had a hopper profile then what I was expecting which really suprised me. Very good."
"Flavors of grassy hops and pretty much what I wrote above. Still very bitter and dry throughout and in the finish. I'm lowering my mouthfeel a notch...this is more rough than delicious for me."
""
"Amber orange with a unrepentant blanket of dense foam. Curtains of lace obscure the glassware. Very, very nice. Oranges and more oranges on the nose. Sure they smell like they've gone over, but it's quite a rich melange just so. Also, is that soy? Or salt? Or possibly Earl Gray. Not sure but it's a very intriguing combo. Taste is similar, over-ripe oranges, tea, lemon, funk, bitterness. Firm palate. Nice soft carbonation. Funky but pretty dang good."

"All right, I added a student this past week named ""Tawny"" and for now, she seems to be dominating my beers. This one looked like the top of a soft-serve vanilla ice cream cone by the time that I was done. Tawny, rocky and with great retention, it really slowed me down. Fall, dang you! Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles in evidence. Nose had a bitter, citrusy mustiness, as though they had commingled all of the ingredients above so as not to overwhelm one or the other. I call it a) truth in advertising and b) just what I like. I am tiring of hearing people that do not like hoppy, bitter IPAs moan about the current dearth of malty beers. Yo, hops is what sells, currently! Move on. This was nice. Mouthfeel was medium, but the taste was superb. It had a tea-like characteristic that reminded me of orange pekoe. Orange and black powder, plus must. Wow. I remember my Pops' one-skillet Chun King meals with orange pekoe tea when I was a child and this really took me back. Man, but Pops could cook. I was totally inspired by him in high school and took four semesters of HomeEc (Foods). Finish was semi-dry, offset by the sweet orange peel and if you think that I could not perceive it, think again! I remember that one of the criteria for Overall asked if you got your $'s worth. In this case, for six bone for a bomber, the answer is ""Hell, yeah!""."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice beer, would buy again."
""
""
""
""
"D - A promising Belgian IPA to start with nice appearance and aroma before quickly turning average at best... The flavor and mouthfeel prove to be a bit of a let down... The overall result is an average at best ale that I would neither recommend nor seek out again, though I wouldn't turn it down if offered again... Like an actual tramp, try to enjoy once and then kick it to the curb..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a good show of hops, though when i think belgian ipa i think a sharp spiciness and some belgian yeasty character which this lagged a bit behind enough so to garnish just good regards."
""
""
""
"Taste: Hops hit you right up front and reveal a bit of the orange peel taste that the label describes. This is a Belgian-style IPA, but it just doesn't handle the synthesis of the spiced fruit hop notes with the malts in a good fashion. Instead, you get a bit of a mish-mash of the two fighting against each other for a bit of an undefined taste. Finishes pretty smooth with a bit of coffee-ish malts on the back. A medium body and low carbonation make this quite nice. Note: As this warmed up, the clovish spices coalesced with the malts in a much more unified way and gave rise to a much better taste. Serve this slightly above the recommended 40-45 degrees F for maximum taste. Tasty, but nothing exemplary."
"Now this is much more in tune with my preferences than Muffin Top was. It's a straightforward Belgian IPA with good sweetness-bitter-yeast phenol three way balance right in my personal sweet spot. If anything, I'm only really disappointed by the slight lightness of body, and I'm being rather nitpicky about that. The head could also be a bit more stable. But it's got a great sense of just the right amount of herbal / pine / citrus hopping and phenols to accent a nice bready caramel malt into something better than most of the usual domestically produced BIPAs for sale in my local market. Absolutely no boozey burn, either. Check this one out if you can."

"O: honestly have to say that it is one of my favorite belgian style IPA of all time. I have not ran into one that had a hop profile like this brew."
""
""
"This beer showed some creativity and finesse with its execution. Really impressed with Clown Shoes with this beer. I will buy more of their expensive bottles if they are this good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with high carbonation, and a dry, slightly bitter finish. This is a nice beer, with good bitterness, sweetness for balance, and some spice to make things even more interesting."
""
""
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass, bottled on 8/12. This pours a cloudy mid brown color with a mid-large off white head which leaves a lacing and keep a finger thick retention. The smells are nice, you get a load of pine and floral hops with a nice sweet caramel ending, a little funk and some other belgian yeast esters like banana and bubblegum. The feel is medium. The taste is excellent, a highly bitter load of hops but a little yeast esters and caramel to attempt to balance out."

"Hazy golden body with a fluffy off white head. Lace is pleasing enough. Aroma brings bright citrues and bready belgian yeastiness....as does the flavor. I love this style and the breweries that do it right. Clown shoes does this style right. This is in my personal Top 5, maybe Top 3 of Belgian IPAs. It has a nice balance of juicy, citric, fruity hops and doughy, bready belgian yeastiness. Nice little accent of belgian yeast spice as well. Nicely carbonated and medium-full body. 2nd beer from Clown Shoes. 2nd winner."

"O: A solid Belgian IPA that borders on being a little too bitter but is constrained a bit by the nice malts and fairly reserved (in terms of flavor profile) Belgian yeast. Abv is just right, and makes this bomber a perfect serving. If you're looking for a nice middle-ground Belgian IPA, look no further"
"Love the name and it pours a hazy golden orange hue which leaves a two finger creamy head that stays and leaves sudsy clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is orange peel,caramel candy,butter popcorn and resinous piney hops,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with tastes of boiled candy,toffee,citrus,kumquats,mango and finished bittersweet with piney bitterhops and sherbet,overall its quite drinkable and i would drink again."

"Serving type: Bottle poured into a glass from the Boston Beer Garden (cool place) reviewing from the 26th of June 2012 before the Beach Boys concert at the Pavilion."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a hazy medium caramel amber. One finger fine off-white head with decent retention and good lacing. Aroma of citrus hops, orange, sweet malt and faint coriander. Flavor is sweet malt, pine and citrus hops, orange. Finishes with lingering citrus and hop notes. Belgian spicing is faint and overwhelmed by the IPA character, but the hop and malt combination hold their own. The Belgian elements are subdued, but do give this an interesting off-beat flavor that works well. Medium bodied with some creaminess, mouth feel is enhanced by active carbonation. An interesting take on a Belgian IPA. The labelling didn't bode well for a serious Belgian IPA, but the contents worked out well."

"Overall for what I paid it's well worth it and could see myself trying other clown shoes beers. A very well done Belgium IPA."
"M- Light to medium body. Good carbonation."
""
""

""
""
"O - This one had all the components I look for in a Belgian IPA. Great blend of Belgian flavors and hops make for a great summer beer. At $5 a bomber, this is one I will definitely get again."
"This is distinctly Belgian in aroma and flavor, but the hop character is tremendous and forward. It's citrusy and floral with notes of grapefruit and faint melon. It's easy to drink, smooth, and flavorful. It's worth a try."
""
"D - This is a weird one, the Belgian characteristics are kind of weak, but the are present in sufficient quantity to really screw with the hop profile. The yeast flavors are harsh and excessively phenolic which only serves to highlight the harshness of the hops and really clashes with the pine and grapefruit notes. To me, this is a perfect example of why so many people seem to dislike Belgian IPAs, no thought put into how the hops and yeast work together and an apparent lack of understanding of how to deal with Belgian yeast. You shouldn't try brewing a Belgian IPA unless you are already capable of brewing a very good tripel."
"Overall: A lot hoppier than I like my belgian IPAs. This takes away from the complexity as the hops sort of run together in the middle and finish."
""

"O: Pretty good, this is a nice spicy and citrus laden beer, but nothing to knock your socks off."

"O: I really enjoyed this one. Surprisingly complex. Quite hoppy, bordering on a normal IPA. Love the biscuit in the aftertaste. Nothing earth-shattering, just a solid and tasty belgian IPA."
"This leans more towards a regular vs. a Belgian IPA. This whole asprin thing is too off putting for me to even consider trying this one again."
""
""
"O: Very good Belgian IPA from excellent local brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Hmmmm... an interesting IPA, although I can't say I ever really warmed to it. Probably would not order again."
"Poured a one finger head on an orange amber hued body, not a lot of retention with some patchy lace, scent is earthy citrus, some sweet malt, taste follows the nose with some characteristics of a typical IPA (grapefruit and orange peel) but with a funky finish that has a vegetable earthy feel, strange but I am game, mouth is medium with some carbonation, it is nicely bitter (not overly) and relatively smooth given the funky taste, glad I tried this odd but neat brew."

"This lovely lady deserves better than to be called Tramp Stamp. That's for trashy trendy dunces with poor judgment. This is the somewhat reserved, demure, alluring, feminine girl next door with enough mystery in her eyes to draw you in with a promise of untold depths. For that reason I hereby rename her Isabel. See to it, Clown Shoes."
""
"O: Very nice and enjoyable beer all around. Looking forward to more Clown Shoes brews as the guy at my beer store keeps harping about them."

""
"Hazy amber orange with a pale yellow finger's worth of head which built up thicker along the sides. Expected more lacing than I got. Bready hops underlie pine and earthy spice. A hint of citrus as well. This goes for the aroma and the flavor as they are identical. A decent amount of bitterness and spot-on body for the style. I really enjoyed how the yeasts added phenols that played well with the hops. Nicely executed."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is pretty clean but the hop resins are oppressive. Won't get this one again."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable and quite easy to drink. I have had this beer a couple of times now, both on tap and in bottles, and I would likely get this one again. I really like the balance to this beer, especially in the flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Starts with some sticky citrus and orange notes. A heavy malt flavor kicks in with some Belgian yeast. A bit too sweet and heavy for me."
""
""

"Overall: This beer is an absolute blessing, complex and gives you little bit of everything you could ask for. Salud!"
""
""
"22 oz bomber poured into a duvel tulip. Pours a somewhat hazy burnt orange with a 2 inch off white head that quickly shrinks to a finger. Decent lacing. Aroma is grapefruit, orange, lemon, and dough. Flavor is orange, pine, lemon, spices, and bread. The Belgian yeast flavor is somewhat subdued and the mouthfeel is light to medium and sticky. Overall a pretty refreshing Belgian IPA"
""
""
""
""
"D: I enjoyed this but was expecting a bit more I think. A bit on the light side with less Belgian attributes than I'd prefer. On the flip side, fantastic bottle art."
""
""
"Overall this is a very good beer, the balance of sweetness and the bitterness of the hops is perfect. I would go for this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Strongly juicy & fruity citrus hops with a NW undertone. This really leans on the IPA part of the equation with quite a minimal Belgian influence. Style arguments aside, this is a very solid IPA. Great juicy fruit citrus open with good sweetness and then plentiful bitterness and a firmly drying closer. Rated as an IPA with just a hint of Belgian influence. And damn nice as such."
""
""
""
"Poured a hazy burnt orange with a foamy off-white head that receded quite a bit, and left some streaky lacing on the glass. Bready aroma, Belgian yeast, malty, with traces of indistinct fruit esters. Taste followed the aroma with a decent kick of bready yeast, citrus zest, peach and pear, a bit rubbery, with notes of peppery spice, tree sap, and floral hops. Medium body, a bit chewy, decent overall, though I prefer this style to be a bit lighter in body with a crisper hop profile. But that's just me."

"O - Nice Belgian stlye IPA and so many to chose ffrom this is a beer I would go back to for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D ~ Can't get enough really. Perfect balance. Never too phenolic. Ultimately it DOES lose flair on warming, but the hops still shine through in a wonderful way. A true Belgo interpretation of an American IPA with mild heat. Recommend for BIPA naysayers."
""
""
""
"O- Belgian IPA's are typically not my style, but this is right up my alley. This is a good IPA with the slightest hint of Belgian influence. Sometimes two great styles don't blend well, but in this case it does. My favorite Belgian IPA thus far."
""
""
""
"Overall - Good for the style but I am still learning to like BSPA's and I hope to try more beers from this brewery."

"Tramp Stamp has a dark orange look to it with some amber thrown in as well. A small amount of white stuff with minor stick. Smell is of grassy hops, fruity esters, some Belgian yeast and trace pine. This is a hop forward Belgian IPA with the Belgian yeast taking a backseat. The hop comes off grassy, bitter and floral, with small fruity taste in the middle followed by some sweet malts. Kind of all over the place for me. Feel is a bold medium with a nice ample carb. Not my favorite Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good Belgian IPA that has some bite to it. This is a sipper. The earthiness comes out as it warms and that is my favorite part of this. Would not rush out for it, but I would get it again if I desired something hoppy."
""
"Overall: Another nice addition into the BIPA family of beers in the world. Love the citrus this beer gives off and will be having more of this in the future."
"Pours a very nice hazy dark golden amber color, very nice carbonation, with a one-finger plus thick creamy off-white head, and leaves some very nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slightly yeasty, very nice hop notes, very slight citrus. The taste is slightly sweet, with a very nice hop note, some citrus. Medium body, with a nice slightly dry/bitter finish. Another very tasty brew from CS. Thanks Bill!"
"Overall good choice would have again"
"Bottled 8/11. Sampled on February 2, 2012. It has a pretty typical IPA pur with a medium-amber color and a lot of foamy head. The aroma is bountiful with floral hops, orange peel, and a bread-like character. The body is in the medium range but the texture is smooth. The taste makes you realize it is an IPA with its powerfully bitter hops along with the citrus-orange note, and clean finish."
""
""
"Got to love it. The name is testament to a time-honored American tradition, and the chick actually has a beer bottle tattoo popping over those low-rise jeans! I'm keeping the bottle. Nice rich amber appearance, great head retention. Pretty good yeasty citrus smell. The taste is good too; once you get past the stinging hops, which try to overpower things a little, there is a nice undercurrent of flavors normally associated with a wheat beer - banana, clove, yeast, etc. On account of this, it feels and tastes great in the mouth, but once you down it, the hops come back with a vengeance. Nevertheless, I enjoy and recommend this - look forward to trying more Clown Shoes stuff."
""
"Overall: The appearance and aromas are extremely enticing. Unfortunately, the flavours are almost asking me to go away. Extremely bitter, and just not in the good way."

"This pours a tan-straw color with a light amount of foam. There’s a grassy-piney hop aroma and flavor to it. The grassy piney hop flavor comes across sharp as knives (or tattoo needles?)—in my notes I wrote sharp three times—but it’s matched by a floral hoppiness from the Belgian yeasty esters. This gives the flavor some fruit spiciness and a floral, hoppy, pungent flavor that finishes strong."
"Mouthfeel is fine, medium-high carbonation with a fairly crisp finish, fairly refreshing although perhaps a bit boozy overall. This isn’t a bad beer at all; just not a favorite of mine. If the idea of mixing an IPA and a BSPA together appeals to you it’s certainly worth giving it a shot."
"Yet to be impressed by Clown Shoes."
"This beer is a medium golden brown color, with amber highlights when held to the light. Nice white head, full and stable. The aroma has a spicy hop character. Woody, piney, and a little earthy. It's a bit malty underneath, with a bit of spice and yeast. The taste is balanced...bitterness in the mid-taste, and a little sweetness up front. Malt is firm. There's a belgian yeast flavor that gives some phenolic angle to the beer. It's interesting and very enjoyable. Full and firm in body. I enjoyed this."
""
"Pretty obvious why this one could've been better: more Belgian yeast character! They advertise it as a Belgian IPA, yet the ""Belgian"" part seems lacking. But as an IPA, especially one modeled on the southern California variety, hey, it's great!"
"I poured from a bomber into my SA perfect pint glass, hazy orange pour, above average white head, light lacing. The arom has lots of citrus, good amount of pine. Very hoppy, lots of citrus, finishes pleasantly bitter. The body is medium, good carbonation. A very good IPA, nice blend of hops. The Belgian notes are kinda light, taste more like an IPA than a Belgian IPA"
""
""
"This is a good sipping beer. I drank the whole bottle, enjoyed it from beginning to end"
""
"Above average example of the style. It bothers me that on the front of the bottle it says, ""ale brewed with natural flavor."" What is this, a soda?"
"Bomber from Half Time poured a hazy orange amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of biscuit, yeast, orange zest, grapefruit and light earthiness. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied and crisp with a dry finish. Flavors of biscuit, yeast, orange zest, grapefruit and light pine with a crisp dry bitter lingering citrus finish."
""
""
""
"The beer looked pumpkin colored, with a thick three finger thick head that looked very creamy. The aroma was a mix of sour cherries, orange peel, and grapefruit. The taste was dominated by the bittering hops followed by a floral rosewater like flavor. There was a touch of lemony sourness as well. Very refreshing and light feel, and a tart finish. The approachable nature made this a very easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
"Strong aroma is yeasty and hoppy with a hint of apple. It pours a luscious dark golden amber with a nice, if not persistent, pale golden tan head that leaves some decent lacing. Flavor is fairly hoppy, although quite fruity, more Belgian than IPA but still tasty. Smooth texture has average body and a fair amount of fizz. Overall, not outstanding but still worthy."
"I don't find the Belgian influence to be huge and as an IPA it's only fair to middlin'."
"Mouthfeel is a little more in the IPA zone then the taste. The hops present themselves here in the form of bitterness and pucker. Smooth with a mild body and carbonation making it a vey drinkable beer. The finish does have an excessive dry almost powdery feeling that doesn't compliment well but all in all it's a fine brew. The tramp stamp is solid and one I'd buy again."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is a wonderful blend of a hoppy Alpha hops American IPA and a yeasty Belgian style IPA. I tatse a range of flavors from bread dough to kiwi!! Fantastic."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer, especially for an IPA. I personally don't get a monstrous Belgian yeast character so it is a little disappointing in that respect because you could almost call it a bottle-conditioned IPA and I would think the same of it. If you are a hop-head, you will love this. If Belgian Pales are your thing, this may be a bit to ""American"" for your taste."
"O: Despite all of the hops, the beer is very well balanced so that the bitterness and citrusy flavors are not overpowering."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a nice bright orange with a fluffy white head. The nose has nice IPA hops, bright and piney with a touch of yeasty spiciness in the background. The taste hits you at first with an assertive bitterness that lingers with some citrus fruits and some more of that yeasty spiciness. Finishes on the dry side with medium carbonation. Overall a nice example of the style, it is not going to blow you out of the water with anything crazy but it is very well executed and drinkable."
""
""
"Poured a reddish-brown with one-finger head that died quicky but left some lace patches on top of a mostly piney, citric aroma along with some caramel, sugary malt. A thinnish, light body, goes down smooth, the citric hops along w/ spice are prevelant and quite tasty. However, the Belgian yeast strain and orange notes, as well as some candi sugar sweetness typical in Belgians are minimal yet I still pick up a touch of tart/plush fruit that is typical of some light Belgians. This is more IPA than Belgian with some of the sweetness muted but still a good balance. Only criticism is that the finish has a slightly funky, offsetting spiciness that I wish was a little more crisp and muted."
"Overall: A very nice beer and quite enjoyable to drink; while the hops are great, I would have preferred to see the yeast play a slightly bigger role"
"This has its moments. At times I sat here and thought it was a great example of the style (from an American brewery) and other times, the exact opposite. All in all, this is well above average, albeit a bit of a mess."
""
""
""
"O: This is another solid, drinkable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A fairly competent Belgian IPA."
"O: Not the most assertively-hopped Belgian IPA to hit the market in recent years, but rather, Tramp Stamp is a hop-centric Belgian Pale ale, unfiltered and quite drinkable, even at 7% ABV."
""
"O - Ehh, not a great beer, but decent. Doesn't really ""wow"" me."

"A real cloudy tan amber color with a big fuzzy white cloud on top and thick chunky lacing. The aroma brings out a delicate clove/pine-lemon hop with a pleasant caramel malt base. The tongue gets a goodly dose of lemon clove and yeasty nutmeg spice. Really nice with a medium body and a fizzy fullness that goes down comfortably. Easy drinking with a very universally likeable clove hop blend. Nice job CS."

"O- What an unexpectedly awesome beer! I must say that given the name of the brewery (goofy) and the name of the beer (gimmicky), I was expecting something not-so-good. But the BIPA is just about my favorite style and these guys just about nailed it. I look forward to trying more of their beer. Kudos."
""
""
"Drinkability- Overall this beer is really easy drinking but not the most flavorful Beligium IPA I’ve ever tasted. I’ve really become a big fan of Belgium IPA’s over the years and I feel like this one needs a bit more of the Belgium influence. It’s good but definitely could be better. Thanks much Kevin!!"
"Overall: very easy to consume this one, as it refreshes and quenches one's thirst. Very enjoyable beer."
"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep amber with good head and lacing. Smells of oranges and belgian yeast. Taste orange with good piney/citrus hop blend, belgian yeast is there but subdued. Smooth medium finish with oily hop resin. Not usually a big fan of this style (give me a good old fashioned American West Coast hop bomb) but this one is very subtle on the yeast treatment. Not bad at all!"
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy gold-orange color with a small white head. Aroma of pine and floral hops. Belgian yeast is noticeable but now what I would call strong. Flavor of pale malts, grass, and floral hops. The bitterness increases as the beer warms to be the primary profile of the beer. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation. The Belgian character really is very subdued compared with other Belgian IPA's that I have had. This is not a bad thing. But it is different. A nice beer."
"Poured into a tulip glass a rich copper color with a fluffy white head that was gone pretty quickly,with a longer lasting head I would have gave it a higher score,I really like the color and clarity to the beer.Bigtime Amarillo hop aromas,sharp and citric they really burst out at ya,light phenols and even lighter bready malt round out the aroma profile.The yeast plays a bigger role on the palate,spiced and warming the phenols overshadow the citric hops a little but its still quite good.Another good offering I have tried from Clown Shoes,and the write up on the label is spot on."
"O - Pretty good Belgian IPA from America, but I think there are some better out there such at Stone's Cali-Belgique."
"Overall, was pretty excited about this one after reading about it but this missed the mark for me. Not well balanced and bad aspirin aftertaste. Avail now in TX. Rotation - might try on tap to see if any better but one in bottle is enough for me. [N;O]"
"O/D - A really nice Belgian IPA. Fruity, hoppy, and not too boozy. Well crafted and easy to drink. Really solid."
"Overall – A very taste brew that seems to taste more like an American IPA than a Belgian one. Still, I enjoyed the entire bottle and would pick it up again if I saw it. Worth trying."
"Medium bodied with a strong dry hop presence up front that lingers throughout into a bone dry finish.  Lots of sticky, earthy pine flavor providing a decent amount of bitterness that is countered by the estery yeast and citrus fruit notes.  Hints of pepper and coriander along with mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel.  Sweetness balanced out dry/bitter notes nicely.  Subtle alcohol in the finish.  Malt backbone is faint letting hops and Belgian yeast shine.  Pretty quaffable with decently masked ABV."
"A well made BIPA but a bit heavy handed on the american hops. I like the Belgian aspects of the beer but the hops really do a number to a fairly delicate style."
"This has an overriding pepper and Belgian yeast character with just subtle earthy hop notes and some fruity esters. There isn't much to gripe about here even if it's fairly straightforward...well done overall."
"When poured into a glass, this beer had a very appealing rusty, orange coloring. It flowed brilliantly from the bottle with little to no head and carbonation was just right. The aroma of citrus is very delightful and the beer is a bit too sugary or I would have rated alot higher. The beer will leave a slight impression on your tongue, but other than that, I really liked trying a new beer from a company I have never heard of. Not a bad first impression from Clown Shoes, I would like to see what else they have later on."
"O - A solid belgian style, but didn't stand out as something I should try again. Not as jaw dropping as other Clown Shoes beers."
"Overall, very well done. 22oz is a lot of this beer, as heavy as it is."
"M: clean, crisp well-balanced"
"Appearance is cloudy orange color with a one finger head. The nose of this bipa has grapefruit, belgian yeast, some hops as well. It kind of draws you on towards the first sip. Upon doing so, I taste orange, grapefruit, candy, some spice. MF is medium with bitterness in the finish. Not over the top, however. All in all, I enjoyed this brew and would pick it up again."
"Overall a solid beer, good interpretation of the style."
"O- very solid beer. Nice hop flavors with great balance to it. Enjoyed this one a lot! Could drink this one anytime."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Review: 10/3/11"
"Medium mouth-feel and creamy through and through. Despite the boldness of each individual note, this one is a full on drinker due to the consummate fusion of all its elements."
"The palate feels nicely carbonated, and bitter from start to finish, the malts don't do a whole lot to balance out teh flavor of this beer. Don't even put ""Belgian"" before the ""IPA"". Nice to sip bitter beer."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I have to say I am quite impressed with this. The only beer I've had from Clown Shoes prior to this was the Pecan Pie Porter, which was tasty but much too sweet. I love the inclusion of the C-hops mixed with a Belgian yeast strain to bounce different flavors off of each other. A tad bitter, but that is a small complaint to file when looking at what the rest of the beer has to offer."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. Despite all the controversy surrounding this beer (and other Clown Shoes releases), this one lives up to the hype. I'd recommend this one, especially to hopheads."
"O - Overall, one of the better Belgian IPAs I have had. I will definitely be seeking out more offerings from these guys. Well worth picking up."
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is an orange-copper color that is slightly hazy with no head. The beer has a complex nose, with malt and honey sweetness, a bit of baked bread, and fresh, wet, piney hops. Flavors are a strong hop bitterness on the forwad tongue, with a good grapefruit citrus balance. The beer is velvety creamy in mouth, and laces the glass while you drink. There is a hoppy, peppery aftertaste, with some toasted grain characteristics. The finish is very hoppy, with a drying bitterness to it. Good balance and good body. Tasty brew!"
"O- I really like this Belgian IPA. One of my favorites so far. I will definitely be purchasing this regularly."
"Overall-Stone's Cali-Belguque is the only other Belgian IPA I can think of that I can get for this price, and I think this was a buck cheaper at 5.99. I enjoyed this beer more as well. I can see this beer being a go to beer for me, too bad no 6 packs."
"Medium body, well carbonated, wet and lingering on the tongue."
"Medium body, well carbonated, wet and lingering on the tongue. A pretty drinkable IPA, and just what the doctor ordered after Belgian Beer fest this weekend, although I didn't get a great deal of ""Belgian"" in this."
"O - At first I really wasn't digging this beer but as it opened up a little and my palate had some time to adjust it definitely grew on me."
"O: I really enjoyed Tramp Stamp, as I have most Belgian IPAs. Though not excellent, still recommended. I would have again."
"O: Smells nice, but that's about it. No more for me."
"Decent and enjoyable for the most part. It just did not do it for me for what ever reason. I think it is a combination of the really unattractive look and the bitterness that continues to build with each sip."
"Pours pale amber to dark gold, decent white head, then receds to little rim. Nose is big tangerine, maybe some kumkwat. Palate is big tangerine & grapefruit, kumkwat, and general hoppy bitterness. Some wild yeasty/estery flavors too. Light malt to balance. Finish is more tangerine & kumkwat."
"o - overall rather impressed by this one. nice belgian ipa, a bit heavy and thick and syrupy for the style, but that doesn't seem to take much away from it. would definitely have this again."
"O: The beer looks and smells fantastic, but the taste falls a little short for me. Don't get me wrong, I won't have a problem finishing the bomber, but I would have to be in the mood for this to pick it up again. Skal."
"O- This has a full flavor of dried out old oranges but not really in a bad way, with some pithy green characters. The hops are not bad but there is nothing to support them. The malt is hidden and the Belgian yeast character is just not there."
"Overall: I confess I've never been a fan of Belgian IPAs, Love IPA, Love Belgian beers, but the style always seems contrived to me, more marketing than substance. I'll finish the bomber without any drama, but don't think I'll be back for another."
"O - a good beer overall."
"Overall: I don't think I would seek this one out. Maybe if I found out it was an old bottle I would try a fresh one, but I honestly wasn't that impressed."
"Excellent choice for the hop lover."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O--This is a complex brew. One thing I have noticed after trying two Clown Shoes beers--they really nail the smell of the beer and the taste. Both of the ones I have tried have wonderful noses and heavy flavor."
"22oz bottle: This one pours a fairly clear amber color. There was a very small off-white head that dropped away rather quickly. It leaves no lacing. Nice nose. Getting some citrus and pine hop notes. Also some spiciness and maybe even a faint breadiness to it. The taste is quite good. Hops are there, but not overdone. Citrus and pine. Some spiciness, but faint. Also just a bit of the breadiness that you get from the Belgian yeasts, but ever so slight. This is a nice beer!"
"Overall, what we found most interesting about this brew was how much it felt like a wheat beer. It had big coriander and spice, but had robust hops, which were surprisingly much more present in the taste than in the nose. This beer ultimately was not necessarily 100% true to its style, but it certainly pushed the envelope, and made for a very tasty treat."
"O: Goes down easy, quite tasty, not too filling, nice kick, nice representation of style. Clown Shoes continues to bring it!"
"This one pours a nice honey gold in color with moderate turbidity and a light white lacing around my snifter. The nose is dominated by a nice Belgian yeast with sweet undertones, some citrus perhaps, and finishes with an ultimately light hop characteristic. It smells just like I like my Belgian IPAs. It tastes of sweet banana-esque yeast with a nice hoppy bitterness, accompanied by a moderate amount of spice. It has really nice flavor and is a lot more bitter and dry than I anticipated. It's right on point for how I like the style. It drinks pretty smoothly and is in between light and medium in body. Overall I'm a big fan of this one. It may have catapulted itself right behind Stone's Cali-Belgique to be one of my all-time top Belgian IPAs. Well done Clown Shoes."
"The taste is very nice the carbonation instantly fills the mouth. Sweet malt enter and then as the carbonation subsides citrus hops and a slight yeast. At the finish is a slight bitterness very nice"
"Clown Shoes did a great job parsing out the flavors in this Belgian-tinged IPA. It's easy to let a product's ""controversial"" branding affect your judgment, but clearer heads can look past the marketing. Immature names and labels should not offend; bad beer should. What's inside the bottle is much more important than what's on it -- and in that regard, Clown Shoes has nothing to worry about."
"First Clown Shoes offering...and it didn't disappoint. Split a 22 oz. bomber with my friend over a Tombstone pizza while watching the Steelers-Eagels preseason game. I hadn't read the description of the beer on here or on the bottle prior to drinking this. It poured a beautiful, largely translucent/opaque orange with a decent head, accompanied by an abundance of lacing that has some real staying power. Beautiful beautiful hop aroma on the approach. When I got my first taste, the first thing I though was ""Saison with a strong hop profile."" Well, it's not a saison, but the hops are front and center. Wonderful citrusy, piney, grapefruity taste, with a nice light mouthfeel. I love this beer. I'm glad I was able to procure some of this in a couple trades. Wish it was distributed to Philly. Get some if you can. Solid beer."
"Healthy tight foamy white belgian looking head, honey amber body. Spicy hops and yeast in the nose. Super sharply crisp carbonation along with an instant hit of pine sap bitterness. Resinous oils, slick light bodied. Pine & herbal domination, along with a nice crisp mouthfeel. 7% comes through. One of the best belgian-styled IPA's I've had."
"Overall its ok, nothing I would run out and get again, but not bad either."
"Very nice. Where the beer is strong, it works very well. A bit more alcohol punch would have been good, but it is not enough to get upset about. In fact, there is nothing about this beer or brewer to get upset about."
"Pours a murky orange with tons of foamy whte head. Looks typical of a Belgian beer. Smells yeasty and subtly hoppy. Leaves something to be desired. Tastes great. Lote of hops, floral yeasts, a solidnbut subtle malt backbone. Well carbonated. Overall a verybsolid representation of the style anid much better than I anticipated"
"O: this is a good beer, that i will buy again."
"O: Although Belgian IPAs tend to be a bit weak, I thought this was a pretty good example. It didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed it for what it was."
" Overall pretty solid no complaints here. I could use a hint of sweet in this just a tad. Otherwise it is a great beer, like a mix of double ipa and other Belgian styles."
"D: Very smooth. Rich, but not too complex. Easy drink overall."
"O - This is a really good Belgian IPA. I'm glad I got my hands on this one from Clown Shoes."
"Poured a cloudy orange with a fluffy white head. Nose lacks a lot of complexity, I'm mainly smelling some sweet candi sugar, bubblegum, and grapefruit hops. Flavors follow the nose closely, it's a fairly typical Belgian IPA, just with a rather pronounced grapefruit hop flavor. Nothing too special. Moderately creamy mouth-feel, with crisp carbonation and a moderately dry finish. Not a bad brew overall, but not something I find particularly memorable. I do like the label though ;)"
"Really nice citrus flavors going on and just enough Belgisn yeast influence. Clown Shoes knows how it's done."
"The mouthfeel is great, with a brisk amount of carbonation and a thirst-quenching mouthfeel. The drinkability is very good, this is a fairly easy drinker. Overall, this is easily the best Belgian IPA I've had. Most of the ""Belgian IPAs"" I've had let the Belgian part far outweigh the IPA part, to the point where they might as well just be a Tripel. This one's different, and amazing. Highly recommended."
"I loved everything about this beer. The name, label art, smell, taste, everything. A perfect mix of American Ipa and Belgian. Can't say enough about this beer. I will definetly be heading back to the store to stock up on more Tramp Stamp!"
"D/O- I split this bomber but would've had no problem taking down it in it's entirety, quite drinkable. Every sip left my mouth watering for more. Highly recommended if you like your Belgian yeast/citrus hops combos."
"O/D- I like it, what a tasty treat. This beer satisfies in a way that one hasn't in awhile. Try it. Or try it again."
"O: Good beer overall. The Belgian portion is more pronounced than the American IPA part."
"Overall- I like the Belgium beers but I love Ipa's and this to me is a great representation of the styles. Cool bottle art and at $5.99 a bomber this was a steal. Glad I tried it and will buy again. My first Clown Shoes did not let me down."
"The first nasty bite."
"If you're a Hophead looking for something different, give the Tramp Stamp a try."
"O: Highly recommended this one!"
"drinkability: This beer is badass!"
"Much to my surprise I really enjoyed Tramp Stamp. Though I usually prefer IPA's and DIPA's with 80 + IBU's, Tramp Stamp is a great mix between two great styles."
"D- Overall, tramp stamp is a really solid beer that is worth picking up. Recommended!"
"O: Overall, a good beer. It smells great--a perfect mix of Belgian and IPA influences. However, the flavors are much more IPA-forward with only a little influence from the Belgian characteristics. Still, it's quite nice."
"Overall: This is a style I really enjoy for the balance and juxtaposition of flavors, but this really just came up short for me."
"This beer has a darkish almost burnt orange color when poured into a pint glass, with a large off-cream head to it. The smell is heavy on the citrus with a cloudy unfiltered component to the beer. Taste-wise, the orange peel is very prominent and fills the mouth along with a very bold hoppyness that pinches your tongue and then the malt flavoring lingers onto the next sip. This is one of the best summer-esque belgian pale ales that I've had the privilege to taste and share with others. Overall, it was a very crisp and refreshing beer with a great label. Rock on Clown Shoes ."
"O: Really enjoyed this beer. Thanks Jared and Chad for suggesting it. I'm definitely going to get more and would recommend this to others. A must try."
"O - I like it a lot. One of the better belgian yeast mixed with bold West Coast IPA hop bitterness that I've had. Many, many brewers can't pull this off IMHO, but Clown Shoes did."
"D: definitely a good drink, just more on the hop side than the belgian side."
"the CPJ"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, small citrus and a hint of candy sugar. In the taste, citrus hops and sweet candy sugar. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry, small orange citrus in the aftertaste. A bit sweet, but nice orange citrus."
"Beer is medium bodied with a really odd bitterness at the back, moderate, sweet throughout, creamy in the mouthfeel, mildly dry finish. It is a mish-mash of flavors but overall a decent Belgian IPA, I've had a lot of Belgian IPAs and this one is pretty good. Definitely an IPA, definitely a Belgian ale yeast beer. I liked it, I would even have it again."
"Finally trying out these new-to-us Clown Shows brews. This one pours a cloudy tawny topped by a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises orange zest, very light leek, clove, banana, ruby red grapefruit, cantaloupe, and lemon zest. The taste holds notes of orange rind, lemon peel, light pine, black pepper, banana, honeydew, and white bread. The body is a hefty light, with a very light moderate carbonation, an almost grainy feel, and an almost dry finish. Overall, a very nice BIPA. My only complaint is that it seems a bit too light and fluffy, but it is damn good beyond that."
"An interesting cross between a Wit and an IPA. Belgian IPA seems a little bit of a mis-nomer, but close enough. Another surprisingly good brew from Clown Shoes."
"I am finding that I am liking the style and this is a good representative of it. Will be interesting to see if changes if they grow into their own brewery"
"The beer pours a hazy, dark golden/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale, Carapils, and crystal malts. The hop aroma is excellent. It has a nice mix of piney and citrus hops along with a dry and fruity Belgian yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It's smooth going down with a good deal of bitterness. The malts provide adequate balance and complexity. The yeast esters are present and add a nice dry finish with a some added fruitiness. There is a touch of orange peel character as well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed Belgian style IPA. It's complex and easy drinking."
"D: This had a great scent, but the flavor wasn't as potent. Nice body and no alcohol noticeable, so it was very easy to drink. An enjoyable Belgian IPA, but not my favorite of the style since the taste was muted and the yeast character wasn't as pronounced as I would prefer."
"I don't find this very drinkable. It starts out pretty well, but they bitter profile is just too overwhelming to the other flavors. If you like the hoppier end of the Belgian-influenced styles, this is one to try."
"Overall I will now seek this beer out as much as I can. It is now one of my favorites. I highly recommend."
"overall: a decent belgian IPA, a little more malt there than i would expect for the style. worth a pint, but not something i would get again. it definatly has its place in the clown shoes line up."
"O: Clown Shoes Tramp Stamp isn't the best brew in their repertoire, but for the style it's not half bad. Yet another intense, Americanized interpretation of a classic style by the folks at Clown Shoes."
"I could stand more yeast byproducts. This brew with a LaChouffe strain would be remarkable."
"pours a nice dark orange with a bright tope head, good lace... very orange nose especially for a Belgian, in the middle is alcohol, a little yeast, and some pine, smells pretty good, not a Belgian nose though... the taste is not good, there’s all the yeast I was expecting, basically Belgian yeast and chemical resin mixed together, right components just tastes terrible"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was an interesting and decent beer, but the candied, sugary flavor was a little too dominating for me. Things just didn't come together as well as I hoped for it. it was still a pretty flavorful and decent beer overall though."
"d: The name is childish and stupid and the finish needs softening, but there is something that could be really good here."
"Not very much carbonation and a bit of alcohol here, too. I would prefer more of the typical Belgian effervescence."
"Nice beer, easy to drink."
"O: I had high hopes for TS, but was let down by the subpar feel and underperforming flavor."
"O- This is a pretty solid beer (my first Clown Shoes experience). I don't know if I'll grab another anytime soon as I have other favorites in the same category, but I am kind of curious to see how this would age, considering the prominent yeast character."
"D - More IPA than Belgian but still tasty."
"O: I continue to be impressed with the unique and creative offerings from Clown Shoes. As a primarily IPA drinker, this style is a natural addition to my arsenal. I am normally weary of aggressive fruit flavors in my beer but Clown Shoes proves it can be an effective technique when balanced with enough hops, malts, and spices."
"Light bodied and well carbonated with tongue prickling carbonation."
"D- tramp stamp is a spicy bipa that I will definitely come back to. Was hoping for somw stronger belgian characteristics, but this was still enjoyable"
"Overall pretty good. A nice BIPA. Only thing I would like to improve on it is less belgain and more hop flavor."
"This beer is full flavored and a good example of a Belgian IPA. Lots of hops, but plenty of Belgian characteristics too."
"O/D-At first I was not a fan of the flavor. I was ready to give this beer a low mark. Over the course of the bomber I have warmed up to the flavor. A few sips have allowed me to become accustomed to the taste. Once accustomed, I was able to more clearly identify the flavors. All in all, I like the beer...I do not love it. I could see myself paying to get another bomber of this just to finalize my opinion of this beer."
"Overall: This is a solid Belgian IPA. I think it would benefit from leaving out the orange peel. I just don't think it ever adds anything good."
"O: Another killer Clown Shoes beer! Excellent bitter/prickly spice, hops, and citrus peel blast. Niiiice!"
"O: A real nice beer. Tempted to give it a ""5" overall, but it's not quite there."
"Overall I enjoyed it but wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
"Overall, i wish that this brew offered more IPA qualities because it really just tastes like a Belgian pale ale."
"Flavors of earthy bitter hops, resiny orange peel citrus, leafy green herbals. Yeast lends some spicy phenolic Belgian character, and there's some sweet toasted grain in the middle. Dry bitter aftertaste. Light to medium bodied, and pretty easy drinking, though I find myself slowing down with it halfway through. Pretty good, i'd drink this again."
"Lightly toasted, fruity malts up front. Herbal, minty hoppiness follows as the fruity malts become sweeter and spicier (thanks to the yeast?). Bitterness crescendos into the finish. Spicy fruit (almost tropical) sweetness lingers, in an otherwise bitter finish. Medium body. Almost syrupy feel. One of the better examples of this burgeoning style I have tried!"
"Overall: A very refreshing beer. It goes down easy and doesn't sit heavy in the stomach."
"A very spicy yeast character in the nose. Cloves with a weird twist of something earthy but not in a hop character way. There is a defined hop character however which is a burst of citrus over the yeast. The taste is all Belgian yeast(more spicy than fruity) dominated by an earthy clove character that transitions to a clementine/sharp citrus. A tangy astringent finish makes me want more but by the end of the glass I am satisfied with one."
"This beer is very drinkable I polished off two glasses from the bomber and could have certainly enjoyed some more. This is a nice example of a Belgian style IPA brewed locally and still pretty fresh. I will definitely be enjoying this one and others from Clown Shoes again."
"Bottled March 2011. The beer is a bright amber with tinges of orange. Gorgeous tan head sat for a while on top of my glass and left rings of spidery lace. The smell is bananas, bubble gum, citrus, hoppy, hoppy and bready, yeast. The taste is much of the same. Very impressive beer. Highly reccomend."
"0 - Not bad..."
"Overall: I would definatly recomend letting this one warm up a bit, or not letting it get to cold as it improved a bit once as I got to the end of the glass. I have had better Belg-IPAs, but this was still pretty good. Had all the characteristics it should have, especially a great nose. My only issue was that there was a bit of a harshness from the peppar charateristics. Not that that doesn't belong in the style, just a bit to much which affects the drinkability."
"Good example of the style, and very drinkable. Well balanced between the significant and tasty orange citrus Simcoe hops and the witbier yeastiness clinging in the secondary. Elevated bitterness by the two C-hops. Cloudy orangey body with lasting quarter inch of head. Thanks Dr. Jay for including this among five Clown Shoes intro package. 650 ml. bottle with a PG picture."
"O: Overall this is a well put together Belgian Ipa, the flavors work well together. definitly would have this again."
"True yeast flavors are right up front on the initial taste. I cannot really detect any malt because the strong bittering (peppery) hop. The body is as one would expect, with a higher-than-average carbonation level. In summary, a decent cross between an American IPA and a Belgian one."
"Overall a very nice belgian IPA. Not overpowering bitterness, almost in balance, with complementary fruity esters from the yeast."
"Poured a 2"" head which dissipated quicker than average. Absolutely lovely orange apricot color held up to the light. Smell of hops and citrus. Taste has a hint of orange peel and lots of hop bitterness. Moderate body build to it, and a moderate length finish. So let's see, ""Belgian IPA""? Yep, Belgian body and finish, and IPA hoppiness. But I'd call it good but not great. I don't think these were the same hops in a lot of other IPAs I've liked."
"Overall, this one has all the characteristics of a Belgian IPA but they seem to be out of whack. The hops are a bit weak and really don't mesh well when the do come through. The spice characteristics are a bit strong - not overwhelming but they take over at times when they are probably best served as complimentary flavors. This is a beer that wants to be could and probably can be with a little tweaking but the flavors are just a bit off right now."
"O: Good beer, this definitely is more on the edge of a 'belgian' style as opposed to the 'american ipa' side of the belgian ipa."
"Overall not bad, the finish with the astringency gets a bit overbearing, decent flavors, bit too much on the sweetness and overall gravity I think."
"What makes this beer a stand-out is its balance of light/heavy and bright/dark flavors. There are a lot of craft beers out there that taste like the brewer wanted to see how much of all kinds of flavors could be packed into the bottle. In other words, if a little is good, more is is better. By contrast, Tramp Stamp has power, but is light on its feet and almost elegant, allowing your palate to taste the subtleties rather than being overwhelmed by heaviness."
"Very drinkable, very pleasant - I think this is a solid example of the style. I haven't given this brewery the props it deserves. I mean it's hard to take Clown Shoes seriously but I'd be happy to drink this one again though wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D - This is pretty mediocre. It's largely inoffensive, other than the strange finish, but it's not something I'd want to try again unless it was fresh off the line or on-tap somewhere."
"overall this one was a sleeper hit for me. i tend to overlook american takes on belgian styles as i typically find myself decidely underwhelmed. but this offering definitely holds its own."
"overall a more then solid offering here and something i grately look forward to be able to try again."
"D: Very tasty with good complexity, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is definitely one of the better Belgian IPA's that I've had."
"Appearance is orange, hazy, with a thick cap that leaves rings of lace. It smells of oranges and fresh bread. The taste is very complex, with orange rind, bitter hops, barely noticeable alcohol, and a juicy citrus finish. This beer is terrific."
"O - This is a case where the overall outweighs the individual components for me. I have to admint that I've been loving the Americanized Belgian IPA style - definitely becoming one of my favorites. This one has quite a bit going on - lots of flavor nuances, lots of character...I'm gonna be going back to this one frequently I think."
"Drinkability was where this beer seemed to falter. Belgian IPAs are typically a nice marriage of phenolic, powdery yeastiness and slight candi sweetness (the Belgian part) and crisp, grassy, noble hops (the IPA part). This beer however reminded me more of dry, bitter, West Coast-style IPA. I really would have liked to see more of that typical Belgian character come through."
"D - This, like pretty much every Clown Shoes, is just delicious. Really great appearance, solid flavor profile, and a great mouthfeel. Definately would buy again."
"D = Well crafted IPA. Being familiar with Clown Shoes Clemintine, I expected a stronger taste of citrus in this IPA. What I got from the orange peel, was a stronger taste of the orange peel pith. Which did work, but not what I expected."
"Well done, complex and simply delicious take on an exciting and pleasing style."
"Feels tart deliciously hoppy with all the flavors masking the 7%. This one actually caught me a little off guard. Overall a terrific brew."
"On tap at Canary Sq. in JP. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark orange color, with a small white head. Smell had a fresh aroma of hops to it. Flavor was really loaded with citrusy hops. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a bit of sweetness, but then a bit dry at the end. Alcohol was hidden well for a 7% beer. Nice overall flavor and body, so I'd have one again sometime."
"Crystal clear orange colour with a half inch cap of fine beige foam. Sticky, spotty lace, good head retention. Nice aroma, fruity and bready, orange and citrus, banana, hint of bubblegum and cloves. Sturdy bitterness was backed up by bready and toasty malt, some sugary sweetness, citrus and spice. Light alcohol notes were apparent in the finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, light dryness, nice texture. I liked this one."
"This is just a great beer. Aroma of hops and a hint of oranges. A great blend of clean crisp hoppy bitterness with an ever lingering sweet orange/lemon flavor. Each sip is a new taste. The bitterness just plays really well off of the citrus hints. Alchohol is hidden very well, and makes this a Very easy drinker. Plus at 5.99 a bomber its a great deal."
"I had been trying some new brews this week, and the last few were let downs for me. Thankfully, this one pressed the reset button nicely. Very enjoyable, and great quality. I'll definitely seek it out again."
"Drinkability is OK. I almost gave up on my bomber at one point, but the warming mellowed everything out to just plain OK, and I managed to finish. Decent, unspectacular offering from a cutting-edge brewery."
"T - Good. Not as bitter as some members of the style, like Houblon Chouffe. Some of the complexity more associated with Belgian pale ales, ie Bruges Zot"
"I would definitely recommend this beer. Another good job by Clown Shoes."
"D: You really don't taste the 7% at all."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer and the 7% abv. is hidden pretty well...however there are definitely better beers of this style out there."
"The feel of this beer is complex but medium is size, the scope is not too big to handle but is well layered for most beer enthusiast tastes. It has a smooth finish that is quite refreshing going down."
"Another very impressive effort by Clown Shoes, now one of my favorite breweries. The beer is orange with a big thick head. The smell is yeast, citrus, and hops, my god it smells good! The taste was a balance of sweet and bitter hops with a gorgeous backbone of oranges and soft malts. Super duper drinkable!"
"This is most definitely a beer that I will purchase again. It is something that instantly struck me as perfect for Asian cuisine and I will be making that pairing very soon. Cheers!"
"This beer grew on me as I worked through the glass. Another nice effort by Clown Shoes."
"This is one serious Belgian IPA. Dial back the bitterness, up the finishing hops, and you'de have a block buster."
