The extensive  bubbles created a almost fire like quality when held up to the light. An nice citrus happiness to the smell along with some light grassiness.  There is a definite malty sweetness to really balance out the nose.  Wow, the malt really comes forward in the mouth.  That doesn't mean there is no hops like you'd expect in a tripel IPA, just not the punch in the face you might expect.  And that grassiness sticks around in the mouth with almost a honey sweetness as well.  That alcohol warmness you'd expect from a 10.5% ABV is there but not in mouth burning way.  Awesome beverage.  A very well balanced IPA.","Svingjo","Jan 16, 2015"

4.35,14.2,4.5,5,4,4.25,4.25,"This ale surprised me. I didn't expect such goodness with their attempt at a style twisted hybrid. First off, it's a beautiful beer. The look is a rich, murky amber with a thick, tight froth from a moderate pour. Cracking the bomber emits very nice aromas. Rich pine trees, sweet citrus, background of dates and funk. Yup, a mix of IPA and Belgian. Flavors are still good, if not quite as appealing as the smells. Immediate hit is that of a quality IPA, followed by an almost clashing Belgian style (to me, more of a dubbel) and then drifting into a strong DIPA-like fade. Individually the flavors are all of apparently high quality.  I'm just not convinced the flavors match so well side by side. Mouthfeel is excellent, with just the right carbonation to match the IPA backbone. Overall a very good beer. I'd buy it again. For those Clown Shoes brews that are mediocre, this one definitely stands quite a bit higher, IMO.","datalager","Dec 27, 2014"

There is way too much sugary sweetness to this brew...and the hop/belgian blend is just executed poorly.

A hazy yellow-orange amber with some frothy off-white head that breaks down quickly to leave some creamy lacing rimming the sides of the glass. Intense medicinal/citrus/herbal aroma, a marriage of resinous hops and fiercely spicy/sour Belgian yeast with some big peppery notes. Like this brewery's Clementine white ale on performance enhancers. Tons of clove, licorice, and burlap sack phenols do battle with grapefruit, navel orange, lemon, and menthol cough drop to yield a pretty pummeling taste experience. Clown shoes has some pretty skanky Belgian yeast in their arsenal and they aren't afraid to use it. If in the mood this is great stuff, although I became satiated rather quickly and was pleased to share with some buddies, one of whom could not get past the initial sip while the other described some flavor notes like orange spice tea. Indeed, recalls an unsweetened orange-lemon creamsickle covered with coriander and cardamom seeds. Body on the thick side of moderate, a tad chewy and reasonably smooth. Carbonation quite bold and this enhances the ""sour"" citric effect. I think I prefer the less citric Tramp Stamp but this is well worth sampling if one is addicted to Belgian IPAs or the spicier tripels.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 25, 2014"

4.16,9.2,4.5,4.75,4,4,3.75,"22oz bottle poured into tapered glass. Beer pours relatively amber in color for an IPA, with a massive orange creamsicle colored head. Huge, tropical hop aroma is immediately evident. Pineapple, papaya. My sense of smell is not at 100% today but this really is one of the most fantastic smelling beers I've ever cracked (assuming you can abide the lack of citrus / pine cones). Flavor is similarly tropical. I think this might be the fruit punch of IPAs. And as promised, there's a good dose of Belgian yeasty goodness, throwing a well-placed curve ball into the brew. Orange peel and bitter orange soda mixed in there, too. I imagine this to be a really fresh brew. The flavors are strong and definitely unconventional, and I could easily see the flavor being divisive among connoisseurs. I commend Clown Shoes for the novel concept fabulously executed, but still I'll admit the flavor isn't exactly all beer, and I find it a bit tiresome after a while. Which is probably for the best given the well-masked 10.5% ABVs.","hreb","Jul 20, 2014"

I think that my judgement may have been rendered compromised at that point in the day. My overly aggressive pour may have stirred up some sleeping beasts. I got a dense finger of tawny head from my ridiculous pour, but at least, it had good retention. Color was a slightly-hazy, deep-amber (SRM = > 9, < 13). I apologize for th lack of clarity as there probably had been some settling. Nose was odd and I got aged sharp cheddar cheese, fusel alcohol and candi sugar. Remind me, why did I feel the need to gild the lily and open this beast? Mouthfeel was medium but it brought the heat. Whew! There was no doubting its 10% ABV, but that might have been low, actually. Once the initial fire subsided, I began to taste a sugary fruitiness, which they called ""candied fruits"" and ""intense"" and I was not going to disagree. Finish left an alcohol burn that reminded me just how the length of my esophagus is laid out. I felt like a flame swallower with the circus! Dry? Gaspingly so! Pour me another, Justin.

4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Deep clear golden hue, craggy white head that clings to the glass. Sweet sugary, dried, fruits, apples and apricots, faint tropical fruit, clove and spices. Sweet slick full mouth feel. A little syrupy. Honey suckle, sweet breads, tropical fruits and citrus, with some yeasty undertones and a touch of bitterness. Sweetness overrides though and to call this an IPA or hoppy is far off. Booze is heavy in the finish and while some bitterness exists, it lends to a semi-dry finish, with a long lingering sweetness. As a big boozy belgian blonde, this beer has lots of complexity with well blended flavors and even has a bit of complimentary hop. To call is a belgian ipa or a hoppy belgian is a little off though. Good beer, just misleading","jtierney89","Jan 25, 2014"

The finish in particular was not all that dry and mostly spicey. Certainly a flavourful beer, the high strength makes it a bit of a different profile and its not all that sessionable really, but the spiciness and yeast character are quite pronounced.

4.24,11.3,4.25,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Pours into a chalice with a deep slightly hazed body, big off white head flowing thick. Fine Belgian style lacing in this Belgian Style IPA from the folks at Clown Shoes. Aroma is full of spicy yeast character, citric notes from the big hops, hints of coriander and citrus peel as well. There's even hints of cotton candy, tropical fruit notes...think mango/papaya action, with big luscious bready malt layers. Flavor profile a hint of acidic notes from the citrus peel but a super sugary sweet experience, you better have your sweet tooth craving before cracking this decadent dessert like beer. Big flash hop profile, layers citrus fruits, tropical fruit especially mango/pineapple/papaya with a touch of black pepper and full on yeast phenol party. Hiding in the mix of all the flavors going on is a bruising 10% alcohol by volume, hard to believe there's absolutely no heat in the chest with each sip maybe a bit of warmth on the palate but it's well hidden. Mouthfeel is big chewy and on the edge of cloying, healthy dose of natural feeling carbonation saves all of the sweetness from becoming too much along with the hop bill of big alpha acids to dry the palate enough to achieve enough balance. Overall a big interesting beer that I'm glad I caught, by chance while out hunting for some 3F's Zombie Dust in a remote but well stocked beer store in south central Ohio.","WVbeergeek","Oct 18, 2013"
4.08,7.1,3.5,4.25,4,4,4.25,"Top of the Muffin to You! The exclamation mark is definitely needed. Muffin Top is an excellent Belgian-style IPA that has bold elements of both Belgian yeast and American hops. Ironically enough, Clown Shoes don't joke around - don't let the names and labels fool you, many of their beers deserve serious consideration as being top examples of their respective styles.","biegaman","Oct 17, 2013"

Pours lightly cloudy bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, pear, banana, clove, floral, grass, pepper, pine, honey, light caramel, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pear, banana, clove, floral, grass, pepper, light pine, honey, light caramel, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, light fruit, banana, clove, pepper, floral, grass, honey, light caramel, light pine, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and balance of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly slick and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial Belgian IPA. All around nice balance and complexity of hop, malt ,and yeast ester notes; and very smooth to sip on for 10%. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 17, 2013"

3.83,0.5,4.25,4.25,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer, and decent example of the style, the Belgian yeast worked nicely with the hop profile, they seemed to complement each other, but the sweetness and bitterness seemed to overpower those when it came to the flavor and that made this beer a little rough around the edges. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, fairly filling, and the 10% was apparent, but the flavors did an ok job at holding my attention, but I wouldn't want another one and I think this would be a good beer to split since it may become a choir for me to drink a whole bomber. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance, they were both very good and the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the taste and drinkability, they were just a little rough around the edges. I don't think I would buy this beer again, there's a few other Belgian DIPA's that I would rather have and I don't think I would really recommend this beer. All in all I thought this beer was decent, there were some aspects I like, but there were some that I didn't, it's defiantly not my favorite of the style, but it's not a bad beer, it just needs to be cleaned up a little. Tramp Stamp is still my favorite beer from Clown Shoes, but there's still many more of their beers left for me to try,","StoutHunter","Aug 13, 2013"
3.88,1.8,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Has a flourishing off-white head that sticks to it like a champ. Hazy golden orange and pretty. A sharp resinous aroma hits the nose and we're off to the races, followed by notes of caramel, orange peel and grapefruit. Fine and dandy so far. The bitterness loses a length at the tongue and the sweet and tangy notes catch up, evening thing out to the end. Not as in-your-face as the label would like you to believe (surely a craft brewer wouldn't hype on a label for marketing purposes) but fortunately this one kicks it out on all fronts and ends up being a very well-balanced and tasty brew despite itself.","stephens101","Beers"

It is really interesting, and quite balanced, but the niceties of the styles are lost amongst all the complexity. The alcohol (10% ABV) is notable nowhere in the drink, which is a victory for what is already a very refreshing beverage. It is unfortunate that I am drinking it in the middle of winter, as it would really fit better as a summer beer. Clown Shoes did great with the idea, though there is definitely room for improvement. Pick this one up if you see it on the shelves; it is more than worth the chance. 16/20","THANAT0PSIS","Dec 24, 2012"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a very cloudy, golden orange color with a medium-large white head that goes down slowly. Scent is somewhat floral at first with Belgian yeast and fruity esters. Banana with a hint of clove, orange peel, orange juice, and grass. Not as hoppy as I was expecting this one to smell. Hops are pretty mellow, whereas the floral and Belgian yeast aromas dominate. Taste is just as it smells. The Belgian profile definitely overpowers the hoppiness this beer is supposed to have. Not necessarily a bad thing. Flowers, yeast, hops, spices... Pretty spicy. Pepper and clove. Hoppy bitterness with a ton of citrus... like drinking some hoppy orange juice. Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick...almost juice-like. Alcohol is well-hidden. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this is a pretty tasty beer. Great option for Belgian beer lovers who are merging into the hoppier stuff.","DovaliHops","Dec 23, 2012"

Actually, the nose is a bit hotter with booze than it seems to present to the tongue, and the nose has more coriander than the flavor does. It's really sweet in an odd way, however, more akin to a Tripel than the bottle's claims of Belgian IPA-ness. In fact, overall, it presents as a mediocre tripel *because* of the overly citric hopping and as a poor IPA for the same reason. This beer is good evidence for why three-way mixing of styles tends to be risky business, the most common result is mediocrity.","WastingFreetime","Dec 17, 2012"

Unlike most American Belgian-style IPAs, this one actually focuses much more on the Belgian aspect. Definitely respectable. If you're really looking for an American Belgian-style IPA from this brewery, go with Tramp Stamp. This one leans more on the Belgian side. Very nicely done","BEERMILER12","Sep 22, 2012"

Finish Is malt with very strong bittering hops that seem to concentrate on the back of the tongue where there is no real herbal hop flavor, but a lingering hop bite. Interesting subtle flavor to start, but the finish is a bit on the astringent side. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess; good mouth feel. A well made imperial IPA that tastes good but could use some more herbal hop flavors and a bit more flavor in the finish to balance the hop bitterness.","LiquidAmber","Jul 22, 2012"

Full disclosure, I picked up this bottle for about $1.50 on discount from my favorite local store, because they had bunches of it and it just wasn’t moving. I am so, so glad I picked this up. It’s a surprisingly solid tripel brewed with sweet orange peel and a shitload of hops; a Double India Pale Tripel might sound like a potential disaster, but evidently this was executed very well. Clown Shoes, please release this at least once a year, and preferably in 12oz 4-packs!","fmccormi","Jan 29, 2012"

The nose comprises honeydew, pine resin, light balsa, grapefruit, orange zest, coriander, clove, banana peel, and sweet honey. The taste brings in more of the same, but the citrus fruits are now favoring their rinds and peels, bringing out a decidedly more bitter situation. It's not too bitter, but I think the new lack of fruitiness is a general detriment. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish.

As it warms I'm picking up more citrus, notably orange zest but it's still subtle. The slickness from the hops are complimented by candy sugar. Other than that there aren't many Belgian qualities.

Nice two fingers of white foam quickly come up and over the top of the glass settling down with a nice amount of lacing that quickly takes over the glass. Very cloudy, even through the final pours. First thing I notice is the aroma of honey, lots of grains, bready malts and a noticeable amount of honey, whether intentional or not it is there. Grape skins start to come forward now as does a light touch of grass, nothing really bowling me over though. First sip is very smooth, rich and well carbonated the flavor is allowed to explore the palate quite nicely and really makes for a very full feel. Light grains, pears, peaches, apples, all seem to be well represented, but something seems to be missing with the depth here. Just not as full as I would have liked.","mikesgroove","Oct 31, 2011"
