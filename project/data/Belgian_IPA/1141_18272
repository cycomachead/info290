Light orange to yellow colored liquid, looks a touch a dilute, good deal of active bubbles within as well as a very fine particulate which lends it a semi-translucency. There is a raw graininess to the nose as well as peppery nature which keeps it on edge, however, plenty of pine, sweet citrus and floral notes for prettiness, cardamom and chamomile, peach and yellow fruit, fresh with good clarity to the parts. Medium-bodied, dry and zesty entry into the mouth, very floral and the spiciness more pronounced here, cumin, ginger and something close to tarragon, not sweeter spiciness. More orange to lemon citrus than grapefruit. The pine seems more knit in here. The carbonation is tight and not too aggressive. The apricot, peach, pear fruit light of touch without ever disappearing. Essence of violets left behind at the end, expansive floral lift continues. Too rich to be delicate but it is intelligently put together and subtly holds your attention.","farrago","Dec 05, 2014"

4.09,2.5,3.75,4,4.25,4,4,"Single bottle snagged from a craft beer ""pick 6"" wall poured into a goblet. This one is a cloudy golden amber hue with a billowing white head, the latter settling out to leave some intricate lacing on the glass. Aroma is assertive Belgian yeast, spicy yet fruity, with some papaya, mango, and pineapple apparent along with hints of dried banana chip and tobacco. I am getting a lot of musky pineapple on the nose. Palate is a unique, multifaceted hodgepodge of fruit, spice, sour green, bread, and candy flavors. Spicy phenols (clove and faint band-aid) coexist with strawberry fruit chews, rhubarb, candy cigarettes, melon rind, astronaut ice cream, grapefruit, and unripe pear. Initially everything flits about, with nothing obviously out of place despite the mishmash. Things do eventually sort themselves out to a degree, with the strawberry creme and pineapple remaining most salient to me. Moderate of body and carbonation, with a green sour fruit and doughy yeast finish. Not parching and boozy like many tripels and notably hoppy, albeit not in a resinous or piney fashion (think green banana and pineapple skin). Wonderful brew really, so much going on yet not unbalanced or harsh. One of my favorite Belgian IPAs to date.","CalgaryFMC","May 25, 2014"

Aromas of peach, pear, pineapple, bread, floral highlights, subtle cinnamon and coriander spicing, and some Belgian funk. Subtle nose overall. Flavors are sharp and fruit forward, with a bready backbone that supports and balances. Pear, pineapple, and other tropical fruits blend with coriander spicing on a light, frothy, effervesced body. Spiced and tangy sweet aftertaste, with floral hops highlights accenting the fruit and bready characteristics.

Taste is of malt, Belgian yeast, fruity with mildly spicy citrus hops. Palate is a medium crisp smooth body, moderate carbonation, slightly dry. Finishes with a combination of biscuit malt, Belgian yeast with fruity citrus hops for balance. Overall a very good fairly refreshing Belgian ale nicely balanced, definitely one to try.","Samp01","Jul 10, 2013"

Pours murky golden amber color with a nice 3 finger fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big lemon zest, pear, honey, grape, orange, herbal, grass, bread, earth, floral, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of orange, lemon, pear, bread, herbal, grass, floral, pepper, earth, candi sugar, light caramel, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, pepper, floral, grass, bread, candi sugar, light caramel, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Very nice Belgian/hop flavor balance with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly dry mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy blond ale! Great flavor balance and complexity; extremely smooth and crisp to drink. Really enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 14, 2012"

There is a touch of loose sediment and plenty of carbonation to maintain a constant blanketing of fluffy. The nose is yeasty, bitter, and slightly alcoholic. Initially, it's not as refined as I'd hoped, but as the beer warms more notes of honey and citrus break through. The taste is lovely and unique. It's grainy sweetness to resiny bitterness ratio is quite balanced, while subtle citrus and yeastiness build up and compliment this balance. The beer is medium bodied and well-attenuated with a slight honey sweetness and residual hoppy bitterness. Although this isn't one of my favorite styles of beer, it's a great beer that exemplifies the style.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 20, 2012"

This beer smells like an orange tree with a little mint added. How is this? It smells delicious, mouthwateringly so. The flavor is very malty and of subdued citrus fruits but has the sweetest of an orange with a light minty after taste. I'm guessing it's not supposed to be, or drink like this but I'm loving it. Because it's a little past its date it is exceptionally smooth and very drinkable. This aged bottle is superb.

Flavour is on the hoppier side of things, fairly citrus again with some lemon zest, and a grassy/floral feel to it. Fairly high carbonation, smooth and crisp.

Mouthfeel is a little thin, not disappointing, but quite pleasant.

The flavors were a classic blend of Belgian yeast, light citrus, some tropical fruits and a light amount of spices and a dry finish. More hoppy than a lot of Belgian Pale Ales tend to be. Very much a Belgian style beer, only lighter, less bold and more sessionable. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation high.

Aroma is floral, a hint of minerals, hops, malt, spice, and grass. Flavor's all a that and more. Dryish up front with hints of sweetness that come and go. Little honey in there too. Good burps.

You really have to let the beer sit on the palate for a bit before some light bubbliness peppers the tongue.

A: Smells like earthy Belgian type yeast and citrusy American hops. F: Big citrus hops hit first, then a peppery yeast note, some delicate bready malt finished with ample hop bitterness. The yeast is rather subdued, which helps the hops shine through. B/M: Very light bodied and effervesent. Full carbonation that makes for a thirst quenching ale. This is a dangerously drinkable beer.

The aroma is Belgian yeast, pepper, spicy hops, lemon, and tropical fruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but it's also a little bit bready and the hops are stronger in the taste compared to the other flavors. Mouthfeel is medium, it has a bit of a dry finish and above average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it has a bit too much carbonation for me, but it is smooth and not hard to drink. However, I don't think I could drink more than 1 at a time. Overall I think this is a decent brew, it's not a bad beer but it's not something I'd pick up very often either.","bluejacket74","Sep 19, 2008"

The aroma starts much like a typical Belgian pale with yeast and sweet fruits, but there is a big pepper presence that stings the nostrils a bit. The taste has an even bigger peppery spice presence on top of the fruity hops up front and the yeast in the background. There is also a bit of bananas in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is pretty dry and peppery for the style with a bit less sweetness than I would expect.

Taste starts hoppy, lightly bittered, and clean with orange peel and lemon, and then finishes a bit yeasty and musty. The hops give a nice citrusy quality that brightens the belgian yeasty flavor I'm not typically crazy about, and makes this a pretty solid beer for me. Nice and crisp and lively mouthfeel.

Aromas of honey and spice, wheat crackers and lemon were evident, along with notes of fruit, bread and floral hops. Sweet honey malt flavour too, with spice growing into the finish. Light lemon character, wheat and bread, some fruity esters. Medium to light bodied with a rich, creamy texture. Quite dry in the finish. Great stuff, very refreshing with enough complexity to stay interesting.","DrJay","Aug 02, 2008"

Firm bitterness and copious English hop flavour keep it very crisp, while the Belgian yeast notes (pineapple, pepper) carry over strongly from the aroma. Some alcohol. Silky and light on the tongue. Slight acrid dry hop character, almost tobacco-y. A beer of delicate but exceptional balance - a Belgian blonde with the hopping of an English summer bitter. Not a style-maker; just a perfect bent beer.","KaiMiller","Aug 01, 2008"

That disappeared after I got it in the glass, could be an anomaly. In the glass I smell a spicy peppery bready yeasty brew. Taste is yeasty peppery bready as well.

Lots of white pepper in the flavor as well as a good deal of fruity esters and some sweetness. The spiciness somewhat overwhelms the sweetness however. Smooth mouthfeel. This is fairly enjoyable but not quite as sweet as I would like, or perhaps just too spicy for the sweetness that is there to really be enjoyable. Nevertheless, it is not bad by any means.","Georgiabeer","Jun 16, 2008"

The sip is similar, with a touch of apple and a number of herbal and floral notes that my palate can't quite pick apart from each other. Clove is definitely present, a bit of hibiscus, some tangerine and orange rind May be a touch heavy on the bubble gum in the back, but light and complex overall with no element too dominant. Finishes quite bitter for the style. The mouthfeel is creamy with some prickle, just a notch too syrupy. Smooths out in all senses as it warms, though alcoholic esters do pipe up.

The head could use some more staying power though. The aroma is a light touch of banana, a hint of hoppy peppercorn spice, and some sweet yeasty fruits greet the nose. The taste has a strong yeasty profile that makes the malts stand out even more. Some bananas, cloves, and maybe even some honey mixed with some peppercorn hops make for a unique Belgian style pale ale.","scruffwhor","Jun 15, 2008"
