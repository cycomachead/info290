"Poured a lively orangey amber. A big foamy white head takes a minute to settle down and leaves sticky lacing as it does. The aroma is mild, with just light hints of malt and a touch of yeast. The taste has a little bit of spice, but not much funk. It's kind of bland, as it goes along. The mouthfeel is adequate, with a just little spicy bite. It can't seem to decide if it's an IPA with a Belgian twist or a Belgian Wit with an IPA twist. In the end, it's muddled and not really either.."

"This is my first experience with a saison or a farmhouse ale. I'm reviewing this beer but still not quite certain about the style or my affection for it. The ale pours a hazy golden copper with a very thick white head that is quite long lasting and leaves a slight white lacing behind. The aroma is sour and earthy with notes of orange bitters, grass, and herbaciousness. It sips smooth with a light to medium body. The flavor is quite tangy. Slightly sour and has a slight bite of alcohol. It is pleasing on the palate and invigorating on the brain with questions of what all is happening in this ale. I've enjoyed te differences in this ale from what I am used to but still not sure if it is a beer style that I will return to often. That being said, I can say that this is a very well crafted and enjoyable ale. Which, at the very reason price, should most certainly be picked up and tried even if the style is not completely your cup of tea."
"O: A nice, easy drinking ale with some complexity and a superb integration of malt, yeast, and hop flavors. Recommended."

"Farmhouse Hatter makes great use of Saison and Abbaye yeast as well as American hops, combining them all with rich malt to create a super agreeable beer that is layered and hearty yet super approachable and ideal for casual drinking. New Holland aren't in the habit of making crappy beers. Definitely give this one a go. You'd be mad not to."

"I saw this sitting for the past few years on shelves and never bothered picking it up. It's been hit or miss with new holland beers, but it seems like the price was just right for my thirst. Picked up this year's bottle and I am very glad I did so. This is a wonderful, yet subtle, display of a Belgian IPA."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/14/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, grapefruit, pear, apple, clove, banana, pepper, caramel, floral, grass, light pine, light bubblegum, and floral/yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, pear, apple, clove, banana, pepper, caramel, floral, grass, light bubblegum, light pine, and floral/yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, clove, banana, pepper, caramel, floral, grass, light pine, bubblegum, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and malt flavors; with a great sweetness/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Overall an enjoyable and refreshing IPA true to the Belgian style. Having it fresh on tap was definitely a plus. I'd have another."

"O: Fun, fun, fun. Good stuff, good price tag."
""
"A very tasty Farmhouse Belgian from New Holland. I'm ready for another."
""
""
""
""
""

"The Farmhouse hatter has a definite rustic edge and a mild funk to it which is welcome in this day and age of mass-produced play-it-safe saisons."
""
""
""
""
"Overall glad I could give this one a go, could be a little better fresher and on tap but still tasty nonetheless. Good for those who like things a little funky."

"Only drawback is low alcohol content. Otherwise top draw stuff."

"Very nice beer. The nose is a bit subdued for the style but it has plenty of complexity and a decent hop bite."
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer, and especially enjoy the prominent yeast, though the finish is a bit on the sour side. The 5% ABV makes it pretty easy drinking. And the lemon and grass/pine notes are enjoyable. Still, it doesn't establish itself as a real competitor to other heavy hitter Belgian IPAs. It would pair well with savory and rich soups or stews, where the lemon and hops could provide good contrast. This beer was a surprise from my girlfriend, and certainly enjoyable."

""
""
"O: An enjoyable beer – I could see myself buying this at a bar and being very happy."
"Farmhouse Hatter Belgian IPA pours a slightly dark golden color, with a nice size white head. There is a nice strong floral hoppy aroma. There is a nice strong floral hoppy taste, but then it blends with bits of a sweet candy like taste. Nice strong flavor, and a nice little kick of bitterness form the hops. Overall I found this fantastic. It has a typical floral bitter IPA, that mixes with sweet Belgian candy flavors, I found it unique and enjoyable."
""
"Poured a dark orange with a thin head that leaves fits of lace. Smell is malt, and lightly citric hop. Taste has citric elements along with fruit tartness, cherry and green grapes, gooseberries. Medium-light bitterness level. With all these flavors it would seem surprising that there isn't much depth and complexity. Mouthfeel is too light and it falls apart across the tongue. The aftertaste has late-appearing sour notes that linger."
""
"bright clear amber body with a towering whith frothy head that stands four fingers tall. smell is real floral with hints of bread, citrus and yeast. taste is a crisp hop presence with yeasty bread and malt. mouthfeel is light and crisp yet oily with a dry finish. overall i really like this beer, easy drinkin, good taste, getcha some while you can."
""
"O: a decent farmhouse ipa, managebale funk for those who don't like it overdone. Toasted peppery flair with a decent level of hops. End of day a solid mid level B range style."
"Overall – Very enjoyable overall with some nice flavor transitions and a good feel."
""
"This beer pours hazy orange with a one finger white head. The beer has a lightly hopped nose and the belgian yeast really comes through. This beer has a moderate bitterness and a very piney, citrusy hop profile that is on par with the other hatters. The belgian yeast really gives this beer a unique spiciness. There is flavors of clove and wheat but a spicy note only the yeast could add. It has a good deal of feel for a beer this size and its not super quick to drink but makes for a nice paced beer. Overall, its not my favorite of the hatter line up but its a pretty decent farmhouse IPA."
"Drink- I liked this one a tad more than the oak. Really hoping the Rye will be better."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is pretty good. The beer is drinkable, but there is some tough competition."
""
""
"The body is medium, moderately carbonated with a brisk, consistent crispness. It's smooth enough to keep the flow moving, even creamy to a point right up to the bone-dry finish."
""
"O-an interesting Belgian IPA with a unusual mix of flavors"
""
"Overall. This is not my favorite. Its a bit mild on both ends the Belgian and the IPA side. Middle of the road for me. (3.0)"

"Overall (3.5): To me, this beer is like a classic saison, done relatively well, with a ton of bittering hops thrown in. It’s not FANTASTIC as a Belgian style, and the IPA side of it could use a little more malt depth / grain richness, some solid dry-hopping, and more flavoring hops, in my opinion. This would POP with a richer grain body and some serious tropical hop flavor. It’s pretty good, for sure, but not excellent in any way, outside of the appearance (which is damn good) and the smell (not quite as good, but very good in its own right)."
""
"O: Looks and smells nice, and I like the tartness, but the hops were way too weak in the taste."

"A nice American-twisted Belgian IPA, very drinkable indeed"
""

"Overall this is a tasty and interesting take on the IPA. It struck me as a good American IPA that just happened to be fermented with Belgian Farmhouse yeast. Criticism: the overall beer was a bit thin in both flavor and ABV. While a fun, and intricate little brew, they could have amped it up a couple notches. Recommended if your a fan of the style or are looking for a cheap and different bomber for the night. Cheers!"
"It's a flavorful brew that you should not refuse. Don't expect a big beer because it is understated. The alcohol is pretty low for anything that says IPA on the label. T he aroma is first rate and almost a redemming quality."
"D/O: While yeast qualities are true to the farmhouse label, this beer's hop flavors unfortunately distract and bore the palate. Columbus cultivar qualities stand out, going from simple pine, passing through dilute chemical plastic, and finishing with harsh unmodified bitterness. As a straight saison, or even with a more judicious handling of the hops, this ale could have been much more enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Far more a saison than a Belgian style IPA or Pale. Earthy & funky & a bit tart rather than fruity and phenolic and hoppy. Hops, while substantial, are not in IPA territory. Marketing, names, and pigeon hole aside – this is a damn fine beer. A fine saison too. Very tasty – the drinking leand more to intereting than to easy – and quite refreshing too."
""
""
"O: A decent beer with an easy drinkability. Belgian qualities are present, but are not overpowering."
"Taking the farmhouse ale to another level with the hopping here, a bit over the top with complexities here but it seems to work sip after sip. A lot of fun to drink."
""
"Pours a deep orange with a giant thick white head. Lacing and retention off the charts. Nose of Belgian yeast, grassy hops, lemon zest. Nearly identical flavor profile. Begins with yeast and light Belgian spices. Followed by citrus zest, mostly lemon. Pine resin hops, peppery spice and a touch of saisin funk. Definitely a hopped up saison that varries just a bit from your typical Belgian IPA. Spicier and funkier Belgian IPA"
"Top pops and head pours everywhere. Once it resides, you have a golden saison with still massive head. There is some serious farmhouse funk coming off this thing, yeast, grass, hay, pine. Light mouthfeel, more saison than IPA but the flavors are a bit muddled. Hay, yeast, lots of light hay, dry, some grassy hops, a little spice. Pretty good, not great."
"This is quite a bit more enjoyable than I was expecting. The mix of vibrant hop character and spicy, earthy yeast character works quite well."
""
"Overall: This beer is alright, but I would have liked more hops and more of a Belgian presence. Kind of boring, but not bad."

"Found at Cardinal Liqs, Niles IL"
"Medium bodied, well carbonated, and dry. Has a bit of a peppery aftertaste. Well worth trying if you get the chance."
"O - This is definitely an enjoyable brew, however, I don't think the nose or flavor profile was where NH's description lead me to believe. Had the hop profile been more present in the nose and the Belgian notes more present in the flavor, I would've enjoyed this even more."
"This is like a Saison with the malt drained out. Something about this tastes incomplete and used up. The Belgian character is there, with a touch of yeastiness, but the bacteria seems to be eating whatever malt was left. Austerity in a bottle."
"O - Not one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had, but not bad. There is quite a bit of earthiness to this one."
"O – I was left wanting a little more from this beer, but was left a little empty. I would put this more into the Belgian Pale category than the Belgian IPA. This still was a decent a respectable beer."
"O - nice dry Belgian ipa. Light and wild"
"The mouthfeel is very bubbly, somewhat dry, and finishes on the metallic side."
"O: Not as good as the other Belgian IPA's I've had. It's decent and definitely drinkable and refreshing. At only 5% ABV I'm surprised I get any alcohol in the taste."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a light tan head. In the aroma, green apples, small earth and a small hp. In the taste, yeasty, earthy and ends with a green apple fruitiness. A small sour bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry yeasty green apple in the aftertaste. Nice tart, great saison qualities, I can dig it!"
"O: Kind of funky for a Belgian IPA, but a lot going on and some nice flavors."
"The mouthfeel was medium to light in body. There was a mouthfilling, fluffy carbonation. Nicer than I had expected."
"O- The hops are nice and big but the peppery yeast character is a bit to bitter and hides some of the hop depth. The pepper and hop bitterness make it a bit to harsh in the finish."
"It really does come across as an odd hybrid between a lighter more subtle Saison and an IPA. My only complaint is that the Saison elements sometimes aren't strong enough to shine through the overlapping IPA citric oil. If only there was more....funk. I never found any horse blanket funk in this brew, only a faint tartness, which is why I called the Saison ""subtle"". Maybe about 20% more raunchiness would have worked better for my tastes."
"D: Drinks quite nicely. I'll have to keep this one as of my regulars."
"It tastes like I imagined it would: A cross between a Belgian IPA and a saison, and a harmonious one at that. I highly recommend it."
"o: I was excited by what I smelled, but this just doesn't come together well. The bottle read ""vintage 2011", so this may have just been too old. Oh well, I'll continue trying New Holland offerings because they do take chances and their bottles are reasonably priced."
" This comes off in flavor somewhere between a saison and ipa with some slight earthy tinges from the yeast with an almost funk influenced light horsey taste with slight citrus and fruity hop flavors with slight tart elements and spice accents with some gentle sweetness and biscuit from the malt in the background. The alcohol is mild in the flavor with some bitter hop and slight grassy notes with a hint of pepper as the beer finishes. I thought the flavor was pretty good, it has some 'farmhouse' yeast elements and the hoppy aspect is pretty high overall but the combination of the yeast and the hops used isn't the best fit, it is tasty and I would drink it again, but not necessarily the best example of the style."
"Hazy coppery honey colored body with a decent off-white head. Good lacing. Characteristic Belgian yeast notes and fruity American hops in the smell and taste. Very well balanced between the hop and yeast flavors without one dominating the other."
"I can see where this derivation of the Mad Hatter comes from, adding another chapter to the beer's history."
"This is my second in New Holland's Mad Hatter series, and while I appreciate their adventurous attitude, I've not sure I'd run out and have this again. Its more spicy herby farmhouse ale than it is IPA, and can't hold a candle to other Belgian IPA's like Flying Dog's Raging Bitch."
"Overall Impression- A VERY interesting Farmhouse/IPA and has to be one of the toughest beers to seek out though. Really enjoyed this thoroughly and will be buying a bottle of this as well. Hoppy, Fruity, and easy drinking. Recommend!"
"In short, I think this is one of the better Belgian IPAs I've ever had. I could use a little more hop character in the aroma, but the aroma was still quite complex and satisfying. Bravo."
"22oz bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Poured a hazy amber/gold with a couple of fingers of white head. Very fragrant with citrus and pine from the hops and a good dose of Belgian yeast spice. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Starts off with plenty of hop bitterness. Finishes with some Belgian spice. Very drying from hops in the finish as well. Very fresh tasting, which I always like. Interesting beer. Easy drinking."
"The mouthfeel is mild and very dry. The New Holland website says the Farmhouse Hatter has an ABV of 5.07%, but it feels a little higher than that. It makes me want to go out and try the other Hatter variations. At $4.99 a bottle it's an easy way to explore the different variations."
"D - Refreshing, a nice try for $4.99 a bomber and I like that NH made a whole series of these. All that being said, I see no reason to pick this up again, straddles the fence between a pale ale and a saison in not really a good way."
"Notes: The Farmhouse-Belgium-IPA is a bit unusual but it´s true that it either feels like a hoppy soft saison, or a tart Belgium IPA… Irrelevant in a way, given the overall pleasing sense of the brew. Maybe not overtly complex and extraordinary but it is a nice iteration of the style, and my favorite of the Hatter variations I´ve tried so far."
"O: Not a bad beer, overall, but the flavor is lacking for me. I'd like to taste more from the hops than just dry bitterness, and I'd like the Belgian flavors of the beer to stand out more."
"Buddy brought over a stinger of Farmhouse Hatter to try....and it was quite tasty. The appearance is a cloudy copper with thin white head. The nose provides a bouquet of hops, clove and banana. The taste starts with hop and malt which is really nice, then the beer turns very tart and finishes with the clove, banana, and spice common to belgium ales. The tart finish lowers the mouthfeel for me, but overall this is a pretty good beer and worth a try."
"D: This was a nice Belgian IPA, with clean and tasty hop character balanced by sour and spicy Belgian character. Similar to a saison, but hoppier. The body could have been fuller, but the alcohol wasn't noticeable, so it was easy to drink. Not the best of the style, but worth trying once."
"Overall just average but for the price, not bad."
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish copper color with a nice two finger frothy head which leaves behind some nice lacing. The aroma is of some saison funk along with a slight citrus hop and a little sweet belgian yeast smell. The taste has a citrus hop bite to it with some belgian yeast sweetness and some spiciness. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated. Overall it was solid, it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst. The hop bite seemed to be more prevelant than others in this class. The sweetness was a little more subdued."
"O- A decent beer, not my favorite, but I'm glad I tried it."
"overall, this brew is decent. it is not quite astonishing, but there is nothing abrasive and the taste is clean. decent."
"O - This is a really nice Belgian IPA. One of the better brews I've had from New Holland."
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, bitter hops up front that dominate the flavor and linger into a bone dry finish. Earthy with lots of soily pine flavor as well as some citrus/light fruit. The nose had me expecting a strong citrus hop flavor but it was pretty faint and overpowered by the drier, bitter notes. Hints of grapefruit and orange peel but nothing that would suggest that this is a farmhouse beer or that any saison/farmhouse yeast was used. I was pretty disappointed in the lack of this characteristic and the overall lack of complexity."
"Overall, this treatment on this beer is average. It is interesting...but it doesn't seem to be a fine marriage of the American IPA style and the Belgian funk."
"Poured into a chalice, thanks to wino47 for this. It pours with two fingers of tiny bubbles, a hazy orange color. Smells great, nice funk and hops. Grassy on the nose with lemon and orange. The flavor is funky with spicy notes. Clove and lemon again, nice bittering hops. Dinged this a bit for the finish, almost watery. Nice carbonation helps with the mouthfeel and drink ability. Good New Holland beer, solid Belgian style IPA."
"overall - very enjoyable on a hot summer day liek today."
"Taste - Echoes the aroma to some degree; definitely lots of spicy clove and lemon peel, ripe fruit, exotic yeast, and a dry mineral finish."
"O- I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of Belgian IPAs. I tried to adjust my scores accordingly, taking into account the style, but I am just not a huge fan of this one."
"O- Overall a nice Belgian style beer. Taste was a bit too heavy on the spices and pepper for me, and it was a little too carbonated, but it was pretty enjoyable for the price but I probably wouldn't seek this beer out again."
"Overall, an excellent brew. My favorite of the Hatter series to date. A very good, hoppy saison."
"Bomber Pours a perfect hazy orange into a pint glass with a huge head. Smells like all hops and belgian yeast, wish i had a better sense of smell as this one is phenomenal to me. Tastes exactly as descriped a cross between a saison and an ipa. Certain sips the hops are present and on others the yeast. It is however a little dry for my liking. Very glad to try this different style, I wished i had another one as it was very sessionable. I would have poured it immediatly"
"O: This isn't a bad beer, but I probably won't drink the second one that I bought. Think it would be a nice gift for someone looking to try something different."
"O- This was one of my two favorites from the Hatter Series. It had a little more balls flavor wise but still fell a little short for me to really enjoy this one for another pint. Glad I got to try this one."
"This is a very interesting and enjoyable brew. I have to say that before I took a sip I was thinking it would be good, but boring. After tasting it though, I have to say that this is a really interesting beer that has some nice flavors. Not the best Belgian style IPA by a long shot, but certainly a fun beer to drink. I would definitely recommend people give this a try."
"Thanks Justin for sharing this one!"
"Would drink this beer again as it was very drinkable. Only thing I would change is to have the citrus presence in the aroma match the flavor profile."
"Thouroghly Belgian in influence. I did not know what to expect with this beer and was pleasantly impressed."
"Overall: Its a decent beer, but not as good as many others of this style. Sort of boring, too bitter (too much unopposed bitterness), and not enough Belgian flavor or hops flavor."
"Belgian aromas take a backseat- way in the back- to what appears to be plentiful American dry-hopping. Not terribly bitter, but the hops are well showcased by a very dry finish. A bit peppery, a bit spicy, a bit clovey, plenty hoppy. Funkiness more pronounced in the flavor than the nose. A bit more carbonation would take that finish to a whole nother puckering level. Paired nicely with some mussels frites."
"overall - this beer hit the spot - belgian ipa's are not done by the masses of craft breweries yet like how American Black Ales have taken off - not quite as good FD Raging Bitch or CC Dubbel Cannon but still very enjoyable and a solid offering"
"Overall, a good beer and a nice combination of styles. My only knock on it is that the flavor is on the light side. I understand that's where they were trying to go with this one, but I think they could have took it up a notch and still kept it light and crisp in body."
"o - Overall a nice Belgian style beer. Taste was a bit too heavy on the spices and pepper for me, and it was a little too carbonated, but it was pretty enjoyable. Would give another shot and looking forward to trying the other Hatters."
"Copperish, hazy golden color. Rich yeast and pine hop aroma. Thick and creamy head. Nice carbonation. Mild citrus/ fruity taste. Nice hit of hoppy bitterness which quickly leaves and leave the base flavor of the beer behind with a light tartness similar to a Saison. Great beer for all types of heads, during any season."
"-Cheers"
"O: This is an odd type of beer that won't appeal to everyone, but is definitely worth trying."
"Deuce to pint. The appearance is the best thing about this beer. I was eager to try it, as I like both saisons and IPAs, but the combination is worse than its separate parts. I am giving 3.0s for the rest of the categories. And while there's nothing average about this beer, when you put it all together, it's an average brew - at best."
"O- It's a really nice beer and reasonably priced. No problem finishing the bomber. Unexpectedly Belgian flavor when compared with the initial aroma. I'd buy it again. Very competitive with my previous experiences in the style."
"M- A little carbonated feeling on the tongue. To me it feels as though I am drinking a seltzer water. It's not really a bad carbonation though as this beers complexities really keep it together quite well."
"Cheers to another great beer from my alma mater! In my opinion, this one really shows the potential breadth of the emergent Belgian IPA style, by introducing a saison yeast to the dance. Most Belgian IPAs have focused on tripels or golden strongs as the launching point, but this shows how beautifully the lemon and pepper zest of saison yeast can blend with the right varieties of hops. It just fits perfectly. Bravo! This is not just a novelty; it’s a beer you could drink all night."
"O: Great Nose, hoppy with some Belgian funk. It was way over carbed when first opened, I let it sit and settle a bit before giving it a negative review. It was just okay overall. The Belgian side was good and funky, the IPA was not nearly bitter/hoppy enough for my tastes."
"o-another decent representation of new holland IPA's."
