"Still an interesting beer, but am not sure how much of this I could drink.  The pint I had WF's was all I can handle and then some."

"I really wish I would of had it on a hot summers day. The coriander is a bit over powering for me... Does NOT drink like an IPA. More of a hefeweizen/Wit. It's seems like a upgraded 'Blue Moon' the balance is off. Leaves a spicy aftertaste... Like maybe soap and/or tea. On the other hand. It's creamy and light. Appears to be a situational beer to me~"

"O- If I wasn't told this was Belgian IPA, I think I would just think it was a Wit. The bitterness is subtle. But overall it's a nice beer."

"This beer goes down very easy and is tasty to boot. There are more dramatic Belgian IPAs out there, but this one packs some good flavor in a fairly low abv package."

"O- A wonderfully refreshing and flavorful Belgian style IPA.  I am personally very fond of these Belgian or ""White"" IPAs.  This particular one marries the unique spiciness and characterful yeast typical of Belgian beers with the aggressiveness of American hops really effectively.  This would have gotten a considerably higher rating if not for the appearance, but as previously stated that will come done to personal opinion. (3.58)"

"8/9...pours cloudy darkish gold, mustard like. Chunks of sediment in the mix, and thick fizzy foam to boot. Orange rind nose, bright and bitter. Musty, citrus orange taste, a little offputting. Flavors do not blend well, making the whole experience somewhat clunky."

"good, orange color with a decent head which goes away fast. The flavor is orange, lightly spiced with spices(cinnamon). It drinks smother than u would expect and is very refreshing. A great summertime, hot weather type beer. Balanced well with the spices and will definately be drunk again. !!"

"Another beer courtesy of the legendary woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a cloudy golden color with a 1 inch head. Some floaties are present. Smell is of lemons, hops. Taste is mild hops, a very light bitterness, malts are present, zing of lemons and oranges as well. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall makes for a refreshing warm weather beer."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/3/2014. Pours hazy/murky deep gold color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bright grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of bright grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, herbal, grass, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy spiciness/hop bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon peel, tangerine, orange zest, coriander, clove, black pepper, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice white IPA! All around good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops, fruity/spicy yeast, coriander, and pale malt flavors; and extremely smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"12oz. bottle served in an American pint. Pours a golden hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a rocky, two inch, bright white head. Nose is typical of a Belgian IPA - citrus, spice and zest. Taste follows nose - no surprises here. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, slightly coarse carbonation and a mild acidity. Overall, a decent example of the style that I'm not generally a fan of. That said, I'm pleased to see Otter Creek expanding its portfolio"

"O - This is a great summer beer. Good amount of hops that are balanced extremely well by the citrus flavoring and coriander spices. Neither are overpowering, they all compliment each other very well. I really enjoyed the hops of the IPA and the sweetness of the Belgian. Great summer beer. Would recommend if you enjoy hops and sweetness."
""
"Pours light orange, big fluffy head at first but quickly dissipates. Very pretty cloudy lacing. Smells mostly citrusy and a little bit metallic, slightly yeasty but not very. Taste is big citrus up front, dry herbal hops, and a little bit of banana esther and copper. A little underwhelming, I feel like they could have actually turned up the citrus and coriander. Overall a good summer beer, don't get me wrong, but nothing spectacular."

"O: Not a bad beer. Not a great beer either, but it was actually better than I thought it would be. Fresh, light, and easy drinking. A good summer beer."

"o: Not a style I reach for often, but I have had much better."

"Overall a very easy drinking white ipa. It's fruity and crushable, orange comes through but not in a overwhelming fashion, but a hop presence is lacking. Like and reading mouthfeel, work moderate carb. Good drinker for a lazy afternoon,  or day in the sun.   Like other beers from them better, this one is a bit boring."

"This is really ""Brewmaster Mike Gerhart's Fresh Slice White IPA", but I am not going to request a change. Instead, I am CANducting a Crack! and inverted Glug in Mr. Gerhart's honor. He may have forgotten to mention that it is unfiltered, but I will not hold it against him (by much). The trick with an inverted Glug is knowing when to back off to allow the pseudo-cascade to take place and I certainly know that one. The result was a soapy, rocky, two fingers of off-white head that burped and burst its way out of existence, leaving behind great lacing in its wake. The resulting liquid was a deeply cloudy, intensely turbid golden-yellow (SRM = 4-5), like freshly-squeezed grapefruit juice. Nose smelled of white pepper and orange zest and I was drooling in anticipation. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very tea-like, orange pekoe, to be precise. Spicy, peppery, and with a pleasant orange zestiness, all dancing across my tongue in a harmonized ballet. The finish was dry and citrusy and I CANnot think of a better summertime beer to put in a CAN. Thanks for thinking of me!"

"O- this is only the second white IPA ive had but it is my favorite to date. Im not much of a hop head but this style is very balanced and drinkable."

"This beer is made for outdoor enjoyment. I see myself on a boat, at the grill, or plopped on a chair with my toes in the sand at the beach. Quite delicious and drinkable."
""
"O- My second favorite of the Brewmaster Mike series as it's only slightly behind the fantastic Kind Rye'd. I love a good Belgian IPA and this one lives up to my expectations and then some."
"O - OK, but not a huge fan of this. Would have really liked a bit more sweetness to play off the citrus and really bring it out. Instead, the flavors were muted and hidden by a harsh bitterness. White IPA's aren't my favorite style, but there are several that I would certainly choose over this example."
""
""
"On draft at Diamond Market in Pittsburgh. Pours light orange gold with a big fluffy white head. Sweet aroma of citrus with light grassy hops. Flavor follows with sweet citrus fruits and mild grassy bitterness from the hop presence. Super light and crisp with medium plus carbonation. Very drinkable brew that I would have again, but something isn't quite right here with a little funk left on the palate."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice- medium light bodied and well carbonated. I wouldn't get it again but if you're looking for a session able beer and you like citrus or don't like really bitter beers, this is a good choice."
""
""
""
"Not too bad at all, this was very enjoyable."

"Overall: IPA or wheat beer, I can't figure it out. Definitely will be nice once the weather gets warmer around here."

"Mike Gerhart is among the best brewers in the state."

"I honestly do like the beer, but I just feel like it fell short on all the categories. It really is just OKAY - its good for Otter Creek, but I was expecting a lot more from them after having Citra Mantra on tap . The yeast/protein floaties I understand, but they are still just a turnoff for me. I would overlook them more if the beer packed more of a belgian punch, or an IPA punch for that matter. I do love the lemon curd flavor though, that comes through really nicely."
"this would be better without the belgian yeast, a jovially hopped pale pale ale, with a nice refreshing mouthfeel, but its muddled and bogged down by a lackluster belgian yeast expresison. blonde beer, looks wheat based, with a great big white head with excellent retention. the only problem is this snow globe yeast chunky wash swirling around in my glass. this looks like an old belgian strong ale that got lost in a cellar for awhile, its almost gross how much there is, seems not necessary to me. the nose is hops first, lemony and light, but they are covered up by the melon and banana esters of this yeast strain. the flavor is just like the smell, hops first, yeast interrupts and carries on in isolation. very light malt base, and a potentially very refreshing beer in hot weather, but the intensity of the yeast covers up how well and interestingly hopped the beer is, and all the sediment is sort of unappetizing. still, its obviously well made stuff with a unique interaction between yeast and hops, and probably deserves a little more credit than i am giving it with this review. its something different from the masses, and is absolutely worth trying."

"No complaints here, this brew is as advertised. Totally fresh, a little funky and quite citrusy. Well done."

"Overall this beer seems to be in a style dead zone and tastes like it doesn't know what direction to go in. Witbier not enough citrus, IPA not enough aroma, and what's with this sticky yeast quality? While drinkable this beer tastes like an identity crisis."
"O: Nice witbier - it's just not much of an IPA at all. More late hopping would really make this a winner. Still, it's worth drinking."
""
""
"O - It was ok. If it wasn't so heavy on the coriander through the finish, I may be intrigued to get it again."
"very nice beer with bitter hops. pours cloudy orange, some citrusy and funky aromas. really balanced flavor with bitter hops, spice, citrus peel. a really well sessionable summer beer, or an anytime beer, very full of undeniable flavor, can be sipped, swigged, or chugged"

"Had a pint at Astoria Bier & Cheese on Broadway. Overall, a nice clean version of the white IPA, but nothing new. There's a big white pepper and coriander spice matched with sharp grapefruit hops. No malt character, but that yeast character and the American hops. It reminds me of the Saranac White IPA and Bluepoint White IPA—these three beers all kind taste the same. It's tasty, but I'm a little bored."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: More assertively Belgian and hoppy than one of its other new competitors in the white IPA class, SN's Snow Wit. Consequently both more tasty and sippable, but perhaps less refreshing. Still a fine representative of its style, in American terms."

"O: Another great beer from CBC and Brewmaster Mike Gerhart. I feel like the name White IPA is misleading a bit, but that is about it. This is a great beer that isn't hoppy at all, at least not to my palate."
"Poured into a bell tulip, a cloudy, golden-yellow color with a finger of frothy white head that settled to a foamy layer; good retention and lacing. In the nose, Belgian yeast and coriander came at me first, bready malts and light citrus zest followed. This brew really came off more as a witbier to me, but I guess it was hoppy enough to be considered a BIPA. As in the aroma, I got a lot of yeast and spice in the taste, coriander, orange peel, light crisp hops that were present, but never really reached over the dominating ""wit"" character. Medium body, and nice drinkability. Overall, this was a good brew, but I probably wouldn't get it again unless there were no better options available to me."

"Overall as others have mentioned, Otter Creek set the bar pretty high with their first two of the Brewmaster Mike series. While this is by no means a bad beer it had big shoes to fill."
""
""
""
"Another great new brew from Otter Creek."
""
"Overall it just didn't come off as good as the other dry hopped experimental beers. It was pretty chunky too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as impressive as Citra Mantra or Kind Ryed. Good concept but the execution could use some work. I would like to try it from the tap next time."
""
""
""
""
"One of the more tasty White IPA's but I would prefer a bigger hop character."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather refreshing and crisp Belgian IPA. This will be a nice summer style brew to sip at a BBQ."
""
""
""
""
" The taste is good with mostly belgian yeast up front and a mild tangy element with a lot of spice in the taste. The hops don't bring a lot to the taste when cold but do have herbal and zesty quality which I can understand that they are going for a grapefruit, however the yeast overwhelms the hop flavor. Overall I liked this, but it is not the best in the style IMO, pretty drinkable for the strength, but wish it had more hop flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good stuff from Otter Creek. A good, sturdy IPA that paired well with a burrito bowl. I'd have another."
""
"Overall, this is a very good tasting bipa, similar to some other sweeter, hoppier saisons and bipas, I'd like it to be drying and less sweet, but its still pleasant in the flavor presentation."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have not had many ""White IPAs"" but I think this is a pretty darn good path to follow. The Witbier yeast flavors here are somewhat subdued and allow the hops to shine alongside it's own flavors. It is neither a spice or a hop bomb and a balanced, enjoyable experience."
""

"The nose on this thing keeps the score higher than I'd give if I was merely rating it."

"Interesting beer, but the menthol in the nose makes me question repeat purchases."
"On tap at 2 Bros. Pours a murky dirty yellow color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is orange peel, spices, cloves and funk. Smells very Belgian-y. The taste is tangerine, cloves, coriander, and that Belgian yeast. Light hop notes with hints of bananas. Not really getting much of the ""IPA"" aspect of this one, but it's not a bad brew. Medium bodied and pretty drinkable. Of the recent run of new(er) Otter Creek beers this is probably my least favorite, but it's not a bad beer by any stretch. Just a bit disappointing since Double Dose, Kind Ryed, and Citra Mantra were all fantastic. I heard this is being canned so I think that will work well in the summer. Overall, decent but nothing special."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid “white IPA” to drink for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a refreshing drink that would work well on a warm day outside, but it's below the standard I've come to expect from Otter Creek's latest series. It doesn't quite have the hop flavor I would want in an IPA, and it's drier and less sweet than I'd like from a Wit. Overall, it doesn't quite work for me, although it's not a bad beer at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very solid beer. Very flavorful for such a small beer. Well crafted. Great for the warm weather."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not a huge fan, I loved most of the brewmaster Mike's series from Otter Creek this however is out of my comfort zone too much harsh zest oils from the peel/pith to actually be enjoyed or balanced."
""
""
""
""
"Great Belgian IPA. Aptly named."
""
""
"Part Witbier, part IPA...it is what they say it is. It's easy drinking and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good white IPA, I really like the addition of the clementine, super refreshing. I'd love to have this in cans to take out disc-goflin."
""
"O - One of the best of the new breed of White IPAs. Good aromas and flavor throughout the consumption time. For me, the amount of citric bitterness in this brew was pushing the limits of what I like in this style, but it stayed on the good side. I'll have this again."
""
"O-Slightly disappointed. It still doesn't suck, though. Otter Creek has reinvented their brand and while this one isn't as good as their last few additions, it's still decent."
""
"Pours a hazy deep straw color that makes it look like carbonated grapefruit juice. Aromas of orange and bitter citrus with a bit pf peppery Belgian yeasty bready esters. The flavor is spicy citrusy with a light spicy wheat malt flavor. Lots of bready spicy yeast phenols. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick spicy resinous mouthfeel. comes together pretty well for a WIPA although at times the bitter grapefruit to me almost feels a bit overpowering."
"Otter Creek is really doing some great beers lately, I sure hope these turn into regular seasonals or even year round beers. I could drink this and Citra Mantra all year long. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I usually shy away from White IPAs but Otter Creek has been pumping out some good beers of late and this falls right in line. I would love to be crush these one after another on the beach. Super easy to to drink and nice complexity to it. Another winner."
