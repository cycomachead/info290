"I found my summer IPA. A fine hybrid of IPA and a Belgian Wit"
""
"Very interesting combination of styles."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another beer that I would guess the style but is really good.  This one does not have the amount of hops that I typically associate with a Belgian IPA.  What it does have is a big burst of fruit and juiciness.  Taste is peach, coriander, wheat, Belgian spices, and slight earthy hops at the end. All of the flavors seem to pop.  A very light and semi-sweet beer.  This is one I could drink several of, especially as it gets warmer. Really well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lightly yeasty with a nice crisp citrusy finish."
""
"A beer I could sit on the porch on a sunny day drinking.  A nice golden yellow color with a nice wheat/IPA taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured a nice opaque gold with about a half a finger of head and persistent lacing. This was an approachable Belgian ale, not overly sweet or acerbic but balanced with a refreshing but astringent impact on the palate and a moderate, mouth-coating feel. The aroma isn't strong, more characteristic of a Belgian, not at all piney or hoppy. Thoughts of lemon, white raisins, coriander, and mild cloves are evoked. IPA seems a misnomer; to even call it a pale ale is generous but regardless of genre it was an enjoyable and very refreshing brew."
""
""
""
"It was good, maybe it was just a good batch, I dunno, but never mind what haters say, it was good"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Worth a try, but would be better if the hops were more forward- I would classify this as a Belgian Pale Ale, not an IPA"
"A refreshing break from many of today's over hopped IPA's.   Lots of flavor.  Drinkable year round."
"Great flavor.  Lighter in color.  Taste is slightly fruity, but flavorful."
""

"Closest thing to Matilda I've had so far!"
""
""
""
""
"I really had only tried one white IPA before, but most any beers from Deschutes are worth a shot, plus it was on tap at happy hour, so I figured I'd give it a go.  It's really cloudy, a lot like a wheat, but mellow and at the same time very flavorful, which isn't always the case with straight wheats.  And it's not as hoppy as most straight IPAs.  As such, I liked it a lot more.  Apparently I'm now a fan of white IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my all time favorites,  always a go to in the beer aisle and even better on draft"
""
"Notes:  Im not sure exactly what to compare this to, as it is the first Belgian IPA I've ever had.  Interesting style with many possibilities."
""
""
"Hazy golden w minimal head & lacing; beautiful floral, papaya nose; light, crisp, fizzy mouthfeel, tastes kind of like a Shandy but with a bit if hops bite in the back end; It was kind of like a more bitter raddler or a slightly assertive shandy"
""
"OVERALL:  I really enjoyed this beer, something different for me, it's a Belgian wheat beer with a bigger hop profile, the hop profile is not as much as most IPA's but it was enjoyable, I would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
"Smells like spices particularly cinnamon and a little citrusy too. Tastes approximately like pears sprinkled with cinnamon.  It's light and easy to drink but kinda blends in with all the other servicable white ipas out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I could drink a few of these under a hot sun, perhaps better suited for a summer day but no major complaints on this chilly evening"
""
"O: As it is, it's good. Tasty flavors and excellent drinkability. No flaws by what's in it, only flawed by what isn't. I'm by no means a hop head, but I still would have thought an IPA would have more hop character (otherwise call it a hoppy Belgian White). Still, if I'm looking to put down a 6 pack on a hot summer day, this will be a top contender."

"This pours a semi-hazy color with some floaties and an frothy off-white head. The aroma is very citrusy for an IPA. The taste is light and very clean with lots of herbal and citrusy note. This is an intriguing brew from Deschutes with a very unique taste for the style that either be a hot or miss with the drinker."

"Overall this gets the style right with a sweet wheat beer coupled with just enough hops to keep it from being too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.85): Its hard to pull off a wheat IPA, it really us. I appreciate the effort put forth, but it just falls short a bit for the style. If this were labeled a wheat ale then i may have rated this slightly higher. It is a fairly clean tasting wheat beer, but something about it just misses the mark for me."
""
"I love Deschutes Inversion IPA, but this tastes too much like a wheat ale to me, with some citrus notes. It pours kind of cloudy yellow and I picked up the citrus on the nose. Will pass in the future."

"O:   I think Belgian IPA is a tough style to master.   This is a pleasant enough example, but it falls flat of perfect in a few areas."
""
""

"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a long time if you’re in the mood for the style."

"Overall: 3.5/5. A solid white IPA, but one I wouldn't feel the need to have again."
"I was drinking this last night while I was rewatching the 3rd season of Breaking Bad and I thought to myself: ""Why does my mouth taste like I licked the asshole of a soap monster?"" Upon further contemplation, I realized it was because of the sad excuse for a White IPA by Deschutes. Why bring such scorn and sadness (dishonor) to the Oregon brewing scene? Have you no love for your home and native land? Come back when you get 'A' in mathematics."

"Absolutely delicious beer. Must have."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was light, which makes it a perfect summer beer. It had a smooth quality that was refreshing and quite satisfying. Perfect amount carbonation; just enough to quench your thirst. Very drinkable and fresh. Overall, I felt like I was drinking a Belgian witbier, saison, or even a German hefe because of the spice and coriander that is quite common in those beer styles. I think this particular beer's style is interesting; it lives up to its name for sure; the combination of an IPA and a witbier definitely hits the spot. I could easily knock back a couple of these at a summer bbq. Solid beer, give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer leans more toward the ""white"" side of a white IPA. At times, I think I'm drinking a wit beer, actually. As a result, the score suffers a bit since I would expect a bit more hops to make this a true IPA. Style-guideline criticism notwithstanding, the beer is refreshing and easy to drink on a hot summer day."

""

"Overall, much better than the ratings indicated. Very refreshing. Not normally a bughe fan of Belgian IPAs, but this one hits the spot. The balance of lemon and grassiness is sensational. Chalk this one up as a very pleasant surprise."

"Well, every rose has its thorn they say… Deschutes is no different and here's the weak (weakest) link I've found in their generally incredible beer assortment. Not bad by any mean but just not as balanced as I'm used to with this brewery. It's not about the bitterness (I am a huge fan of IPAs) neither about the belgian thing (I love belgian triples too) but I feel like drinking two beers in each sip here. They're both good, but they're just not part of the same beer… I guess this is still a very decent score though..."

"A pretty decent summery ale with some nice flavor and full body. It's not super great but it hits the spot on a warm day and goes down pretty easy."

"O: Deschutes has been one of my favorite breweries for awhile now, and Chainbreaker White IPA is another solid offering that keeps them towards the top. While I'm not ""wow'd"" by it, it offers enough to keep me satisfied throughout the duration of the glass. Including IPA in the name feels like a bit of a stretch to me, considering the hops hardly play a role, being dominated by the Belgian white spice influence. Hair-splitting aside, Chainbreaker White IPA is a refreshing spin-off of both the witbier and IPA, respectively, and could easily find its way into my cooler during a summer BBQ."
"Overall, this is another nice example of the white IPA. A beer like this could be considered the American answer to the Belgian IPA. Of course the style varies considerably, there are still many similarities. Pretty good stuff from Deschutes Brewery here. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One disclosure....not a huge fan of wheat beers."
"Taste is definitely a spicy take on the Belgian IPA hybrid, with a touch of sour grapefruit rounding off the edges, but it's subtle, taking backseat to the wheat and yeast character. I get some lemon zest in there, and orange, even, too. Really, this is a complex and well-done Belgian wit, and one I'd love to try again."

"Hazy, very lemony, aroma, Belgian yeast, pear. Flavor is more wheat, with a cracker finish. Lots of lemon, pear, and grain, with floral highlights. Slightly spicy, clove, and a touch of proper. Citrus pith. Very clean yeast character. Notes of bubblegum esters surface late."
""
""
"Beyond its milky yellow hues, the firmly headed ale sings praises of both witbier and American IPA. However, the hop influences only provide a slight tilt to the lupulin where IPA should be strongly commanding with hop bitterness, aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale shade of yellow nearly looks like that lemon haze that Hoegaarden has bright egg shell white head with fine even banded lacing. It smells great citrus notes, slightly spiced not overkill like some of the east coast versions I've had, this is balanced wheat accent combine nicely with the hops in this brew. The flavor has spices, bread, coriander, citrus peel bitterness a bit of candied lime, soft coriander/lavender notes very herbal middle, and the sharp wheat notes make it all work together so well on the palate. Great food and beer pairing would be some mahi mahi fish tacos off the top of my head. Mouthfeel light to medium bodied slightly creamy texture from the wheat base, and has a nice dry spiced finish nothing over powers the other aspects of the beer well balanced White IPA...I believe Chainbreaker is a trailblazer. Overall I'm happy with this beer in every way."
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from bottle to glass. Hazy light yellow, strong foamy white head. Carbonation lowered quickly. Smelled slightly fruity and flowery with a small amount of hops. Soft taste, not aggressively anything. Lemon, sage, tiny amount of bitterness. Medium mouth feel. Tasted more of a whit or wheat beer then IPA. It was a good beer, a very mild IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours a hazy very pale straw color, with big soapy white head. great head retention all the way through drinking the glass. any hops in the aroma are overpowered by your normal witbier aroma - wheat and lemony herbal yeast. taste is similar, but the with a hoppy aftertaste. medium body and higher carbonation."
""
""
"Nice, refreshing brew. Light, hazy color w/rocky, white head. The nose is lemony and herbal and some things in the mix that are hard to place but create a nice aroma profile. Very smooth, solid wheat base with notes of citrus, though not a lot of specifically Belgian esters. Good beer, approachable and drinkable, creative yet not mind-blowing."
"Great beer. It's definitely a unique taste for a white IPA. Has a great smell, great body, and is very smooth going down! Easy sipping beer for a warm day when you don't want the full body of an IPA. Great starter IPA for anyone not quite ready for the full hippiness of IPA's."
""
""
"D - A very nice refreshing brew... This one walks a fine line between Belgian IPA and Witbier... Insanely quaffable... I'm not sure why this one doesn't have higher ratings on BA because I find it quite enjoyable... I can recommend and will likely find this in my fridge on a regular basis going forward..."
"O- not a bad beer. not what I expect when I read IPA though. more yeasty. its decent though."
""
""
"Overall: A solid brew, nice and refreshing on a hot day"
""
""

"Overall: an alright but overall completely overpriced brew. I wouldn't call it an IPA either - not very hop-orientated, more spice-driven. Too expensive and not interesting enough. Drinkable."
"I am not sure I ever had a white IPA from a bottle before. I prefer my beer to come from a tap over the bottle in general. But this Chainbreaker White was a nice change from my usual selection of beers. While I am not a big fan of fruit favors in beer, I liked this beer...maybe I was just thirsty and maybe the nice finish let me appreciate the slight fruity flavors."
""
"O: smells great. Taste not so great. Too bitter tied to the phenolics. Doesn't pair."

""

""

""
"o: Not bad, but I'd rather have a wit followed by an IPA, than have them in the same glasd."
"The beer is pale yellow and extremely hazy with a pure white cap. Aromas of herbal tea, lemons, lemon rind, earth, wheat, coriander, hops. Really, this brew drinks as advertised - a hoppy witbier, essentially. Refreshing and crisp, finishing dry. Prickly carbonation with a tangy, mildly tart, grapefruit finish. Lingering bitterness and coriander. A cool and unique beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really nice wheat beer. I thought the IPA in the name is a little misleading, this is more of an attempt to cross a wheat beer with an IPA, so the hops and ABV are not what you probably expect when you see IPA, but Deschutes balanced the characteristics nicely here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

""

""

""
""
"This is my first mediocre review on here, but if the label says IPA, I want at least some of the bitter notes of the hops to come through - this one tastes more like a basic wheat beer with a generous dose of lemon squeezed into it. Its not a bad drink, but not a particularly good one either."
""
""
""
"I like this beer, a local wings joint has this on draft, less lemon and more creamy mouthful on tap than this bottle but still a favorite of mine...a very good beer, Deschutes is quickly becoming a favorite brewery of mine to sample. I will buy again, preferably on tap."

"I was skeptical at first, but this IPA/witbier combination is not bad. This raises one question; how good would the wit be on its own?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too odd, and really doesn't work to this palate. To me, it is a standard Hef/wit with added lemons and a little extra hop bite."
""
""
""

""
""
"I was excited to get this started, especially after really agitating it in the bottle, per the label's instructions. This resulted in a LOT of foamy, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving so much sticky lacing behind that I may be forced to break out the jackhammer, despite planning to run the dishwasher later. Nose was really spicy, like coriander, black pepper and even perhaps some saison yeast. I want this in my mouth! Yeah, yeah, that's what she said, ad nauseum. Color was a cloudy lemon-yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4) and when combined with the head atop it, it looked like a slice of lemon meringue pie. Mouthfeel was effervescent and the melange of hops and spices was riotous. I was reminded of a recent Law & Order: SVU episode in which a woman was performing fellatio with a mouthfeel of Pop Rocks. This beer is probably what that must be like although I have no personal experience. This was an exciting beer for this self-avowed hophead because it gave an all-new dimension to the style. The finish was dry, but not gasping as some AIPAs have been when saturated with hops. I like them, but this was new and different by comparison."
"This is my first ever white IPA. I am very happy with this beer. Not your average Belgian."

"On tap at Southpaw in SD. Pours a hazy golden with small white head. Bretty aroma with hay, spices, honey, light pine. Flavor follows as a combination of wit, tripel, and IPA. Light spice and bretted wit flavor, some yeasty honey and clove, and a crisp pine hop finish. Light bodied, high carbonation, really crisp. This turned out nicely for a style that to me is mostly meh. Not bad."
""
""

"O: A great, pleasant and relaxed beer, with plenty of hearty and fresh flavors and a wonderful dry feel. It doesn't quite reach a transcending balance, but it has great qualities nonetheless."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a bright white/yellowish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is strong of grapefruit, some hops. Taste is grapefruit, some tartness, hops, a bit of malts, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a little different, but a solid beer."

"Overall: This one did win a GABF medal and deservedly so. I like the style a lot and this one is a great example of a hoppy wit. Good stuff Deschutes."

"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer and would definitely have it again. I wasn't sure if the combination of wheat and IPA style would work at all but Deschutes has done this nicely. However, for me it seems like a light IPA. Maybe additional malt and hops would make this good beer a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"At first impression this one seems to be more wit than IPA, though as it warms there is a fair amount of hop bitterness. There is a little clash between yeat/spices and the hops, but it does not seem to be as distracting as some other Belgo-IPAs I have had. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, carbonation is fine-bubbled...sweetness is moderate. Its a fairly decent beer and a little different take on the Begian IPA style, but I wont be rushing out to buy a sixer anytime soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer that reminds me more of a Belgian Ale that an IPA. Still an enjoyable beer without being overstated."
""
""
""
"O: Overall has some yeastiness, spicing is moderate though a bit muted and hardly wow worthy. The hopping is adequate but a bit linear, carbonation could of used some snap. Body is light enough for summer use. End result is somewhere between ok and good. C+."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't my favorite Belgian IPA but it's a good one. It keeps the qualities of both an IPA and Belgian Wit at even par until the taste. And even then it's still good, but being such an IPA fan and seeing ""White IPA"" written right on the label, I wanted the tropical fruity goodness of the hops to be the star of the show, and to that it fell short. Although it didn't meet my expectations, it still made for an enjoyable beer that I could see myself sessioning in the summer months."
""
"It's very good beer."
"Pours a hazy lemon yellow with ample white foam. Aroma is spicy yeast, citrus zest, sourdough, and lemon meringue pie sweetness. Palate is lemon, orange, coriander, clove, and a touch of yeasty funkiness that approaches brett. More lemon meringue sweetness followed by a dry and bitter finish. A strong yeastiness persists on the palate along with an acidity like weak lemonade and a hoppy somewhat herbal bitterness, although the overall effect is much less hoppy than the IPA designation would suggest. More of an extra sour and bitter witbier. Refreshing and sessionable."

"This is a fantastic summer beer. It pours so clear and so orange it just invites you to come hither and drink from it supple core. The aroma promises a citrus zest of orange lemon and every tangy memory you could ever imagine. The taste is crisp and will wake you up if you start slumbering into the late dogdays of heat and despair. The finish is smooth like getting out of the pool And walking into the last 30 seconds of an automatic car wash. I love this beer and will forever treasure it on a warm summer day"

"Overall: As a big fan of Belgian Witbiers in the summertime, I love this beer! It has all of the flavors I love in a Belgian Wit, but with the added bonus of some nice subtle citrus hops. This is another winner from Deschutes, and has become my favorite beer of this summer."

"Chainbreaker poured a pale and hazy yellow straw like color with a small lacing head. The aroma was well balanced, with a slightly floral aroma, and lots of citrus. The taste was light with lots of citrus notes, some hop flavors, but rather balanced, some sweet Belgian candies come through too. A bit lighter, but not exactly watery, but still flavorful. Overall a lighter example, but tasty and refreshing."

"Nice lighter white IPA. Good carbonation,light in color,nice citrus/grape fruit smell as well as taste. Light,dry refreshing finish,slightly hoppy. Great beer for a hot summer day. Had it in a bottle as well,like most everything a little better on tap. Another solid offering from Deschutes..."
""
""
"Overall: I really tried to find something I really liked about this beer. Unfortunately it didn't happen. I really like Deschutes as a brewery but this one fell flat ( both literally and figuratively). The call it a ""white ipa"" but drinks more like a wit without much bite. I would recommend the porter and stout instead as they are world class brews"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a great summer beer. It's light enough to drink in hot weather and has enough complexity that I can drink it pretty slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is light-medium bodied. The carbonation is very biting. It refreshes first, then coats the tongue with a thin bitter layer. Dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty nice flavorful brew overall with a decent blend of graininess and a lemony taste, although slightly low on the hop profile for an IPA."
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was really good. Quite refreshing!"
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice cloudy pale yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger fizzy/creamy white head, leaves a big island in the glass. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some coriander, bannanas, nice little touch of hops. The taste is very nice malty, slightly hoppy, yeasty, with a nice touch of fruits/spices. Medium body with a nice dryish finish. Overall this is a very tasty brew, and hit's the spot on a hot day."
""
""
"Overall - i normally don't go for BIPAs, but this one was very well executed. crisp and refreshing"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice cloudy yellow with a half-finger white head that dissipated into a ring of white that left no lacing. It looks a lot like a witbier, but with less head and lacing. Scents of pine, slight citrus, coriander and Belgian yeast. Smells a lot like a west coast IPA at first and then the witbier like scents emerge. Flavors of pine, orange peel, slight coriander spice and Belgian yeast funk. Like a witbier and IPA crossed. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderated carbonation. Easy to drink. It's an excellent beer, a combination of two great styles that work together in a unique beer."
""
"Eh. It's a completely average for a wit and subpar if it's really any variation of an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Delicious brew whose flavour is well received on the palette. Well worth a try, easily sessioned and would be incredible on a patio. Another brew I wish we could access in Ontario, but know we will never have the pleasure of enjoying on the regular."
""
"Overall mixed and matched for $2.50 this was a great white IPA. I could see myself getting this again. Easy drinking wheat based IPA."
""
"O - Good BIPA, not a whole lot goin on, but overall just majorly refreshing."
""
"Served on tap at the Blue Heron in Coos Bay, OR. Poured a quite hazy yellow like fresh lemon flesh with fairly small head. Decent lacing on the glass though. No light penetration really. The nose had lots of mute colors, mostly fruity esters of the yeast and some white bread. There were some subtle citrus hops, especially lemon and grapefruit. The taste had a little more bright notes to it. The fruity yeast was big on the palate and the lemons and grapefruit really came forward more than on the nose. There was a strong, clean bittering to the beer. Pretty dry and bitter finish."
""
""
""
"Overall I think this beer is incredible! It may be lacking on the IPA front a bit and calling it an IPA may lose it some points in judging, but seeing that this is a fairly new style I think you have to be a little open minded in judging it. It gets a solid 4 out of 5 from me! So it's lacking a little in the hop department, and lacking a little head as well as the high alcohol content coming in just below 6. Those are the only bad points, if you can call them that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
"O - This is a pleasant, refreshing beer to have in the spring or summer. It's more of a straight up Belgian wit than an IPA, although hops are definitely present. Pretty good."
""
""
""
"Give it a try if you like Whitbier, if you are an IPA head, you will be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Maybe it's just a fruity IPA with a bunch of wheat thrown in, but it really works."

"O - A fresh, drinkable summer session beer, with a slightly weak and underwhelming flavour"
"Overall Drinkability: This beer definitely found its niche. A nice wheat-IPA hybrid. Might be a bit too much for your average wheat drinker, and a bit too light for IPA lovers."
""
""
"Chainbreaker White IPA is a tasty beer from Deschutes Brewing and it seems like it would be right at home served next to the pool on a hot summer day. It is reasonably complex, but still light and refreshing and it’s the type of beer that most anyone will find at least likeable enough to drink on occasion."
""
"Probably not my style and I appreciate the willingness to be creative but I could not get through this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good change of pace for a summer brew. Wish I could get a bit more of the hops coming through as they are dominated by a fresh healthy wheat."
"o: Deschutes is one of my favorite brews, and while this definitely isn't one of their best brews its not really bad in any way. it's pretty light, and not too complex but not bad in any way"
""
""
""
""
""
"I had high hopes for this and was very intrigued when I first saw it on the shelves, but it quickly disappointed. For how great most of Deschutes' brews are, this beer was a huge let down for me."
""
""
"M: Really nicely carbonated - easily drinkable and possibly the best part of the beer."
""
""
"This tastes more like a Witbier dosed up with some hops and more citrus. The interesting tartness is almost in the range of some sours, but it lacks the vinegar edge. Quite lemon-lime flavored with an enduring sharpness. Maybe they just use a lot of orange peel, and the hops do the rest. The hops are listed as Bravo, Citra, Centennial, and Cascade. Thoroughly fascinating brew, but I don't need more than one for the forseeable future. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Baron's Marketplace in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of lemon zest, grassy hops, light malts, spice, herbs, walnuts, minerals, honey. Overall very smooth and easy yet flavorful with modest complexity...almost like a wit beer with a touch more hops."
""
"O-easy drinking, great summer beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, straw color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, floral hops, yeast, slight herbal, and a hint of spices (clove?). Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation. Tastes of hops, slight floral hops, sweet malt, yeast, hint of spices, and slight pale malt. Overall, good appearance, feel, and complex aroma, but the body is slightly deflating."
"O - This is going to make an excellent hot weather quencher. Since we have that in spades here in PHX, I'll be going through alot of this i'm sure..."
""
""
"Overall a tasty and well-made brew for those who'd like a bit of a hoppiness to their Hoegaarden experience. I admire the light use of hops, so that the Belgian yeast likeness remains on center stage. I wouldn't think twice of knocking down a few of these on a soft spring day."
""
""
""
"The Chainbeaker needs to work on teh chain gang. This beer pours a cloudy yelloe with thin white head that is leavinjg a nice lace. The scent has a slight piney citrus hop mixed with belgium sweet malt. The taste is very similar to the scent with the addition of a pepper type spice that gives it a nice flare. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with good carbonation. Overall it is an ok belgium style white IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Very enjoyable beer. This example of the white IPA has grown on me."
""
"This looks pretty good on the pour--a light, hazy yellow with very active bubbles and an impressive two finger head which leaves strong lacing. Unfortunately, the smell is very grassy and grainy, and the taste is very sweet. Lemon, wheat, lemon. There's some lingering bitterness from the hops, but mostly this tastes like a wheat beer without the coriander spice/yeast. I'm mostly just getting sweetness along with a zippy carbonation--it's an okay beer, but probably not something I would try again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh."
""
""
""
"Overall: Never had a ""Belgian IPA"" that went for basically a Belgian White base with a Northwest Pacific Hop profile. Really great beer from a great brewery."
"This tastes like an average witbier that's been hopped. Opening with a refreshing blend of citrus and tropical fruit ( lemon, mango) hop flavors, there's some citrus peel, some spice (a little earthy/muddled) and some yeast. The wheat backbone here is disappointing. Lacking in structure, it is limp and lacks that bready, crisp and slightly dextrinous definition that great witbiers have. Instead, it is rather loose and soft. A little watery on the finish, this beer is crisply carbonated (a little too much IMO) and has lingering flavors of spice and tropical fruit. Bitterness is medium-low here. Decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" A very bright and refreshing IPA. Smooth wheat backing with snappy citrus bitterness make for a crisp drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - such a well constructed beer, has big element of both Belgian and IPA styles but melded into what the style should be, stoked that this is available is 6-packs here, this will be become a session regular for me!"
""
"A cheaper and more available version of the Collaboration, but not as fulfilling."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An enjoyable Belgian IPA. I like the fact that the flavours are cohesive and don't compete with one another. Definitely would suit for a hot summer day."
""
"O: This is the first 'white' IPA that I have tried. To me it was a great success. It is like the more common summer-shandy but really seems like a beer that is sweet instead of a lemonade trying to be a beer. For hardcore IPA lovers this may not be as robust as you are looking for. But for someones looking for a lighter side of the IPA spectrum that will brighten up your pallet this is a great route. I foresee picking up more of this in the summer time."
""
""
"Overall-I like it. It would be great on a hot day after mowing the lawn. Has a lighter feel than a traditional IPA. Easy drinking and tastes good. A great summer weekend beer while grilling out. Would go well with grilled fish with a bit of lemon. Makes me wish it was summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pure and bright one-finger white head; decent retention. An interesting cloudy, light yellowish lemonade appearance. A unique look. Citrus & hoppy aroma. Tart orange and spices, evergreen. Medium carbonation. A surprising and refreshing brew made for a hot summer day. Glad I picked one up."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a wonderful variation to the IPA…I wasn’t sure if I would really enjoy a “white” IPA, but this is good, real good…the coriander and yeast don’t over do it here, only enhance and compliment…the flavor is super drinkable and refreshing, this is the perfect summertime brew…I could drink several of these while watching a day game at Wrigley Field or hanging out on the disc golf course over at Hudson Mills and be very happy…this brew came to me highly recommended and now I pass it on to you…if you haven’t tried this uniquely delicious brew yet, now is the time…life is to short to be withholding to yourself…(4.25/5)"
""
""
"overall i'm impressed with this style bending offering. this is going to be a go to quaffer come summer time. it's got sunshine and yardwork written all over it. yummy stuff here!!"

"Fairly refreshing, I could do this in warm weather, but otherwise I could take it or leave it. More like a Wit/IPA hybrid to me"
"i'm going to offer this one to my wife..."
""
"O: This was a delightful drinkable beer. Probably one of the better interpretations of a white ipa ive had. But there are just some things id like to see different to make this one a home run for me."
""
"All those bicycle enthusiasts in the City must be pleased with another bike-referencing brew on the shelves. Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy pale straw topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, leek, and light lemongrass. The taste brings in more of the same, though the leek is thankfully absent, replaced by a good dose of lemon zest, light coriander and grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a nice little beer, but one that seems more like a slightly grassy wit than an actual BIPA. It ain't bad, but it's pretty forgettable."
""
"Overall this is a great lawnmower beer that you can chug huge volumes down the hatch. This is less of an IPA and more of a belgian wit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another winner from Deschuttes. It goes down easy and is a good thirst quencher."
"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a cloudy whitish-yellow. The nose offers up wheaty, lemony, floral/herbaceous notes. It's very fresh and bright smelling. It has a nice refreshing light mouthfeel and has all the requisite tart citrus and coriander flavours to complement the spicy/fruity hop notes. Perfect for summer, but really enjoyable year-round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer, but I was expecting more of a hop presence from Deschutes, especially since IPA is in the title. There are better offerings of a similar profile out there, but still a pretty good beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a nice bright hoppy beer with lots of depth both in the hops and in the yeast/spice characteristics that support it, but at the same time it is very sessionable."
""
"Dry, chalky palate with a good body. Dry bananas and sweet, lightly toasted wheat intermingle with citrusy and earthy hop flavors. This beer is great and easy and fun to drink."
"O: The zest complimented the esters from the yeast. Easy drinking. I would definitely have again even though I'm not the biggest fan of this style."
""
"I like this. I typically hate the ""Belgian IPA"" label because like most of these new style breweries don't know what the style is. I am not going to claim that I know what the style is either, though this is close to what I have in mind. Regardless, just a very enjoyable beer to drink."
""
"O: Great beer. If Deschutes offered only seasonals, I'd wouldn't feel bad about losing the regular lineup. Nicely balanced. Very refreshing. I'm partial to citrus forward hops and the Belgium yeast only enhances the the lemony taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-- not the best beer I have had, but I can see why they were going for... And I am probably not who they wanted to impress with this one."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"O – I like this take on the style, it's got good character and complexities to it. Nice crisp and refreshing, with a hint of a hop kick. This is a solid brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is beautiful, creamy wheat with super fresh, fruity hops. Complements eachother perfectly. What an amazing beer. This will be my go to beer for sessioning from now on."
""
""
""
"O- fairly disappointed with this one, not a very good representation of the style, not that it's a terrible beer by any means it's just not a great belgian ipa, there are better examples out there, probably won't buy this one again"
""
""
""
""
"Above average to average score if this were a witbeer but the lack of obvious hop features in this beer were a serious let down. Belgian yeast, spices and lemony wheat take center stage here. Nicely crafted but give me my hops please!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I'd get this again as a nice ""palate-cleaning"" beer. Not really for a session."
""
"Other than the misleading name, I find this beer to be a good contender."
""
""
"Enjoyable and something different in the IPA world."
"Overall (3.75), a nice quaffable summer beer. Belgian IPA is a pretty broad style, with a few subcategories--hopped-up tripels/strong ales, IPAs with Belgian yeast and hoppy witbiers all seem to qualify. This one is definitely in the latter most category, with the spicing and wheat grain providing far more characteristic to the beer than the hops. I drink this one every summer, but I do wish there were a bit more presence from the American hops. Maybe it would be more noticeable if this one were a little fresher. Based on Deschutes' 120-day time between bottling and enjoy by, this bottle was packaged on 6/26, making it over 45-50 days old. That said, the nice thing about this style is that even after the hops have faded a bit, it remains a good, refreshing beer."
""
""
""
"O- Not as good as I was expecting my first Deschutes to be. I'm a sucker for BIPAs but I guess I should have listened to the BA score on this one. Not bad, I've just had better."
""
"Overall this beer stars off as a spiced witbier yet without the yeast notes. As it warms it offers a garlicky yeast aroma with good agitation. Otherwise the lemon and spice crowd out such things. A decent beer though the IPA moniker seems a bit brazen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Churchkey. Pours a hazy straw-yellow with a good white head and some nice lacing on the way down. The nose carries some light witbier spice alongside nice American hops. Beautiful notes of citrus and tropical fruits come through alongside a nice backbone of wheat. Flavor has a nice body with good wheat presence and a nice Cascade and Citra punch. Extremely drinkable. Light body with good carbonation and a moderate bitterness. Excellent."
"O: I like the beer. I don't like the beer. Tastes great but less drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first white IPA. Chainbreaker is very pale golden color ale with some haziness. A tall fluffy head sits on top with plenty of lacing. Aroma is akin to a Beligum wit but is balanced out with a citrus hop bouquet that lightens the wit beer aroma. Smells wonderful in all honesty. Taste is like wow, light and refreshing hints of wheat malts, yeasty esters and lemon grass hops. Drinks smooth and tart with a bitter finish. Probably will be a hit in the summer no doubt, which would be prefect for that time of year."
""
"O: Very easy to drink, refreshing, and thirst quenching - this would make a very nice cook out beer in the summer. I enjoyed this one quite a bit, another solid offering from a dependable brewery."
"O: This beer is easy to drink but doesn't seem to fit into any particular style-it is more like a witbier ans less like a Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
"O - Interesting mix of styles, but with the IPA designation, I was expecting more of a hop presence to it."
""
""
""
""
"O- All and all a decent brew, though my least favorite of the deschutes family, i can see it being a good session."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very nice brew, easy to drink and tasty."
"Pours a very light yellow color that remonds me of sunshine, the head is frothy and white sticking to the glass on the way down. Nice floral aroma with a ton of Belgian wheat and yeast, and lots of nice citrus notes from the hops, very nice smell. Nice bitter lemony flavor with wheat, yeast and some banana, grassy hops. It has low carbonation with a refreshing finish. this beer is really good, nice representation af a Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
"High C"
""
""
""
"O= This is a pretty nice beer, the best ""white ipa"" I've had. The man version of Blue Moon?"
""
""
""
""
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink! Solid Deschutes brew. Stacks up nicely against all the other new hoppy wheats out there."
""
""
""
"Billed as a Belgian IPA, this one pours a very light, pale yellow, with big head and extensive lacing. Smells clean, and lemon and light malt, not picking up lots of IPA hoppy goodness. Tastes a bit bitter, mostly on the citrus side, and wheat, and yeast, but not detecting much of the claimed 'spices added.' Might be coriander but really noticing this much. Mouthfeel is fast, and wet, and fussy and refreshing...not heavy like some IPA's. I think the hops could be more aggressive, and complex to match the IPA label, but this is a good beer. May be sessionable."
"Pours a pale, pale, bright, hazy, straw color with a tall, white, frothy head that holds excellent retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Aromas are wheat, freshly squeezed lemon juice, citrus, wheat, yeast, and grass. Tastes are equally as fresh with lemon, grass, wheat, and yeast dominating the palate in unison. Mouth-feel is smooth but on the resiny side, finishes sharp and crisp, and semi-dry. Leaves a prickle on the finish with some white pepper. Nice and fresh, with a good balance of flavors."
""
""
""
"This white IPA has a decent light wheat beer taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid brew, definitely worthy to try!"
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale golden wheat color with a soapy, white head. Aroma is lemony citrus and notes of Belgian yeast. Light, crisp, wet mouthfeel, with a mild carbonation burn at the finish. Flavor is comprised of Belgian yeast, lemon, and a bit like a pilsner, a little like a white Belgian, and some like a pale ale. Decent, interesting, beer."
""
"Pours a hazy dirty yellow with a white head, that doesn't stick around for too long. A nice sweet and fruity aroma - lemons and clementine -, some pepper, with just a touch of some tartness to it. Interesting. Flavor follows suit quite well, very bright while also being sweet lemon and clementine on top of a wheat underbelly. Not much bitterness. A nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, pretty good beer. However, I am not a wheat fan and after about halfway through the bottle I find that wheat malt starts to begin creeping up on me. Good beer objectivelly, not quite for me subjectivelly."
""
""
""
""
"O - Not the biggest fan of this style, but I really enjoyed this brew, as the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, and the whole thing comes together really nicely. A great summer beer. Adding to my list of favorites."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by 1/05/13. This pours a slightly hazy light yellow, straw color with a large white head which has good retention, and leaves a lacing. The smells are of belgian yeast esters, banana, cloves, light hops with crisp light malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is decent, a little belgian funk, some banana, light hops (not IPA hops) and some crisp malts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyable drink."
""
"Pours out cloudy yellow. The head is white and has minimal retention. There isn't much lacing but all in all the beer looks healthy. The nose is peppery and floral with a good amount of bitterness. I get lemon, flowers and black pepper, plus a good amount of piney hops. The taste is bitter and spicy. I'm still getting that lemon and pepper. The finish is bitter and lingering. The mouth feel is not too heavy not too light. The carbonation is spot on. The beer goes smooth and crisp. A fantastic beer no doubt. I'm extremely happy this beer made it down to Texas. Ill be purchasing this quit often. At least as long as I can get it."
""
"Overall, I am just not feeling this one. Very different, but sort of not working out for me, and I just don't feel like wanting this again either."
"Overall: A solid beer rounding out another good offering from Deschutes Brewery. Not quite my ticket, a little too earthy (reminiscent of a farmhouse ale or saison) but well done."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very refreshing beer. It's crisp without being too light. And the added hops (at least I'm assuming they added more hops to fit the IPA style) give it a nice amount of bite. It goes very well with pizza. Another fine specimen from Deschutes."
""
""
"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."
"O: Overall, what a nice surprise. I really enjoyed this one. The bottle says IPA, BA says Belgium IPA. But its pretty unique and doesnt fall neatly into either of those categories in my opinion. I enjoy the unique qualities. This would be a great summer time cook out beer. Its light, refreshing, but really tasty. Id drink this again, no doubt."
""
"Overall, this is a drinkable, hoppy witbier. A decent 6-pack to bring to the beach or to drink after mowing the lawn."
""
"O-A nice White IPA, the bitterness is there and the blend of orange and lemon is nice."
"Final Thoughts: On the one hand I'm not a huge fan of Belgian Ales, and on the other hand I'm a huge fan of IPAs. Chainbreaker White IPA presents a rare case where a negative and a positive put together make a positive. Not bad, Deschutes."
""
""
""
""
""
"My wheat beer friend liked a lot - but this was after 3 hours of digging a trench - so take that with a grain of salt. I've only had two wheat beers that surprised me pleasantly - this is average and I don't see any reason for it to have the IPA moniker."
""
"O-One of my favorite styles, I have been waiting for this one to show up. It doesn't blow my socks off but it doesn't blow my wallet out either. I would recommend fans of this style go after this one."
""
""
"Smells and tastes of lemon and orange peel, coriander, white pepper, and just a touch of clove / banana with a heavy aspirin sort of bitterness in the finish. It's... kind of middle of the road for my tastes. I've seen this idea done with more complexity and better balance than this before."
""
""
"O: A perfect six pack Belgian IPA. Nothing too strong but it drinks very well. Worth a shot."
"O: White IPAs are one of my new favourite up and coming styles and it seems Deschutes has pioneered this. Like a mini Conflux No. 2, real good flavours, great price, I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the beer I thought I was buying but probably would be excellent if I was sitting in the sun."
""
""
""
""
""
"""Belgian IPA"" isn't really apt. There's Belgian Wit spicing, but there's no discernible Belgian yeast funk. This is just a Northwest Wit. And as all things Northwest should be, there are too many hops."

"love this. pours cloudy but bright sunny colored if that makes sense, lively white head on top. smells like fruity/spicy yeast above a nice hearty hopped up pale ale. im picking up caramel and wheat malts both in the flavor, with piney and acidic hops working up a feverish finish to an otherwise quite relaxed brew. i love the fruit notes together with the bitter hops, and this is the first white ipa ive had that i really really dig. wildly drinkable because of its plentiful carbonation and body on the lighter side of medium. great 6pack to drink, ill be getting this again."

"O-I think I would enjoy this a bit more if it was less IPA and more Belgian white. But then again I absolutely love a good Belgian white and am not a big fan of IPAs. It has a really nice Belgian wit backbone. However, this is such an interesting brew I can see this one becoming quite popular given its uniqueness. Deschutes is so great at making the dark beers, this one in it's own way is such a well made beer I might have to give their other lighter beers a closer look. One of my absolute favorite breweries. I'm going to have to find a way to visit Bend. Well done!"

"Morey's Bottom Line: Pretty good summer beer for sure. The best by date on the side of the bottle is Sept 21st, so this one only has a few weeks left, but I'm not getting a ton of hops. Still, it's pretty refreshing, and not offensive in any way. Cheers"
"I really enjoy this beer.... Everything about it is pleasant.... It's the first ""white"" I.P.A. I've ever tried.... That, in itself, is unique.... It doesn't have the usual hoppy taste that most I.P.A. beers have.... Instead, it has more of a crisp citrusy taste with notes of citrus in the nose of the beer.... Perfect amount of head and body.... Overall, it's a truly enjoyable beer like most beers I've had out of the Deschutes Brewery."

"Light bodied with fizzy carbonation. Not much aftertaste, and finishes somewhat dry. Basically this is a middle of the road Belgian IPA. Decent, but not memorable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good BIPA. A tad quirky, but nothing unusual of the style. That said, there's also nothing that really sets it apart, in my experience, from the rest of the beers in this relatively new style. I much prefer Stone's Cali-Belgique, though if price were a concern, I'd probably choose this."
"O- It's a good easy drinking example of the style. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty good, but has room for improvement."
""

"I think this is my first Belgian IPA where a wit is the base beer instead of a Belgian Pale or Dark. I haven't been too impressed with Belgian IPAs and this one doesn't quite hit the mark either. The hops showing up as more of a tartness is interesting. Worth a try."

"An interesting light brew. Soft, bitter, with an underlying sweetness. A good warm weather thirst quencher."
"Poured into Tripel Karmliet glass. Appearance is hazy and yellow with a layer of dense soapy bubble which stick to the sides of the glass. Belgian esters come first, tons of yeast, banana, lemon, and orange peel. This is followed by a faint pine hop background. The taste features more hops than the nose and brings out the IPA side of things. Pine and resin on the finish. Carbonation level is appropriate and body is light. There seems to be more White Ale than IPA here, still not entirely sure how I feel about this style."
""
""
""
"Nose is yeasty, bread notes, lemon and slight tangerine. The taste is very white. Bread flavors, lemon, yeast and there is some cirus hoppiness in there that actually compliments the beer very well. Think something similar to Lost Coast Great White with a wedge of orange in it. A white IPA is actually a really great idea as long as the hops used are citrusy."
"Overall: A refreshing summer beer; nicely balanced between the two underlying styles"
""
"Not bad at all! This one is a surprisingly light, crisp affair. While they market it as a ""white IPA," I find that the ""white"" part overshadows the IPA. It's very much like a witbier ala Namaste or Allagash White, with just a small handful of extra hop character. It works pretty well."
""
"Overall I should score this on the style and not my palate preference. This is what it is supposed to be, a light, easy drinking summer ale with a Belgian influence. Not my style but to those that like the musty yeasts and hops this one is a summer delight."
""
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a white head. Really dank, hoppy nose. Very citrusy, floral aroma, mild pine, an some wheat and bread. A hint of tropical fruit and grass. Flavor has a light tropical fruit note, citrus, grapefruit peel, and very faint bread malt. A little bit of wheat flavor, very citric, and just very light and refreshing."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy yellow with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus fruit, citrus zest, spices, and yeast. Taste is much the same with a slightly soapy flavor as well. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but it smells better than it tastes in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Still, I DO like this and will probably keep grabbing bottles here and there. I think it's one of those situations where something isn't a world beater, but just hits the spot in a lot of different situations."
""
""
"Overall - This is a quality brew. Highly recommended to try it, I will absolutely buy it and maybe feature it with some pretzel cheese rolls at a small tasting event. Why not?"
""
""
"D/O: While this beer fills a gap in Deschutes' line-up, it is hardly an IPA of any qualification--white or otherwise. Most similar to wit beer, it presents qualities both appropriate and experimental to that style. Austere hops replace traditional seasonings, giving a decidedly herbaceous theme."
""
""
"O - They've really combined an American wheat beer and a Belgian IPA. Really cool."
""
""
""
"This beer pours a cloudy pale yellow color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of yeast, grapefruit, flowers, and a hint of leather and hay. The taste is similar to the aroma, but a little milder. It would be nice if there were a stronger bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but there are much better Belgian IPAs out there. I can't see myself drinking this again."
""

"12oz bottle $7 per sixer. Bright yellow color, almost flourescent. Super white head. Smells hoppy, spicy, wit. Taste is a super hoppy wit. Not really a hoppy wheat like say Lagunitas Lil Sumpin Sumpin but truly a witbier with a ton of hops. The ""White IPA' moniker is ridiculous but what do you expect from craft beer?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty solid take on the Belgian IPA. Leans more towards being a wheat beer than IPA, but it has enough hops to keep it from being too light. The spices are very good."
"O- I loved the flavor of this beer and the astrigency, but the really high level of carbonation on this beer did hurt the drinkable though. I love IPA's and witbiers and I liked this blend of styles a lot."
"O. Not an amazing beer. Easy drinking. Not much flavor. Ok, but not the best white IPA I have had."
""
"Easy drinking beer that is a little lacking in a couple of areas. Especially enjoyed the yeast qualities."
"O: This has served as a good staple for early summer get-togethers - it's likable enough to please malt or hop lovers, even wine drinkers. Refreshing on a warm day, but with flaws that I can't quite get past. Not one of the better things I've had from Deschutes (but they set the bar so high... this is still pretty darn good!)."
""
""
" The taste is gently malty with subtle spiced tinge with moderately lemony hop flavor with slight citrus tanginess and achieves a sort of lemon-pepper type combo with gentle toasted wheat taste in the background. I think this is a quality ale with more emphasis on the wheat than the IPA of the hybrid which is refreshing and nicely spiced with high drinkability -a quality offering from Deschutes, I wouldn't expect any less."
""
""
"I love the whole concept of the style, sort of a mish-mash of styles but it works and works here as well. Worth a getting a sixer of it IMO."
"This is a “white ipa:” there are notes of spice, but the hops do most of the talking here. SN’s rye-ipa is a tastier seasonal ipa, and its rye gives it a stronger spice than this has. Chainbreaker ain’t bad. I feel like with ipas, it’s easy to notice right away how simple and one-dimensional a lot of them are. This isn’t one of them, it’d be great hot-day beer, but it’s nothing particularly exciting. I suppose it excites me only because it’s not generic ipa crap like a lot of the competition."
""
"Hazy pineapple white body, almost a soft inner glow. White head with lots of lace. Smell is oranges, pineapples, lemon, slight pepper. Taste is a little pineapple infused orange marmalade, although its only very slightly sweet. Slightly peppery, or maybe clove. Good level of citric pithy bitterness, yet malt is there providing a nice balance. It's wet, crisp and refreshing. Very good."
"Overall this was very nice white ipa. Well balanced and drinkable. Tastes almost like an ipa mixed with a hefe. Very nice for this hot weather. Recommended to all. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Overall: This has just jumped into my top echelon of summer beers. Although I do believe the IPA moniker may be somewhat deceiving, as it is mainly a ramped up Witbier."
"Crisp, refreshing, and a hoppy beer with nice flavor elements. An easy drinking spring/summer beer when you’re in the mood for an IPA and a wheat beer. It does get a bit salty if you try and drink this too quickly."
""
""
""
"Overall; white IPA...that's lame IMO. This beer, a tasty rendition of a wit that is perfect for summer, widely available, and a tad hoppy for something different. Well done brewers, can't say the same for the marketing dudes. Whateve, it'sr a good beer that I will certainly pick up more of."
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body and hoppy, moderately bitter on the finish a nice beer to the end. I'd have this again."
""
"This tastes like a cross between a pilsner and a wheat ale - not like any IPA I’ve ever had. It’s refreshing tasting and would be a decent beer to drink on a hot day, but it’s not terribly exciting, and I doubt it will appeal to any hopheads looking for their daily fix."
"Overall: I enjoyed this one. My only issue with it is the lack of flavor in the finish. I don't know that I need another, but I'm glad I tried it."
"o - Overall a really nice, easy drinking Belgian IPA. Some nice floral and citrus hops to it, and no bitterness at all. Would love to have it again."
"Overall I love this beer as a nice refreshing summer session beer. I could very well drink this one all day long. Very much worth getting."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, dry and lingering. A decent, sessionable Belgian take on the IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The wheat and lemon really dominate the flavor profile. This is a rather simple beer. I'm not very impressed. It seems the ""White IPA"" is a failed style."
""
"Hazy straw yellow body, several visible streams of fast rising bubbles, under pure white head, relatively quick dissipation with some spider legs. Pretty wit-like nose, some lemony esters, light coriander balanced by citrusy hops. Taste mirrors nose, fairly sweet for a Belgian IPA, not sure I'm picking up a Belgian yeast, fairly sweet. Finish is medium, good effervescence, a bit sticky. Certainly a different take on Belgian IPA, IMO more of a NW hoppy wit, not something I'd drink regularly, but a decent change of pace."
"This notion of combining a Wit with an IPA is still a bit odd to me. But Deschutes pulls it off well. There are some big flavors combating within the confines of one beer, yet this somehow remains pretty mellow. Not amazing, but worth a try."
"An agreeable enough Belgian IPA, one bereft of the lofty booze of the norm, though the hops do show too little resolve towards the end, leaving me wanting more - unfortunately, of something else."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer that will offer refreshment on hot days. Rather light and approachable, it would be a safe inclusion in the public cooler at social events. On the other hand, it's a bit strange for the style, really emphasizing the witbier characteristics over the IPA notes; a bit unremarkable in both categories."
"Overall: As would be expected from Deschutes, this is an amazing piece of balance. Nice touch of spice and hops. Balance and more balance. That's what they do."
""
"overall rating: 4.6"

"Other comments: This just might become my summer beer for this year. Refreshingly quaffable!"
"Overall: this is kind of a gentle beer, but I really do like it. It's floral and citrusy and well-composed; perfect for a sunny spring day. Kudos Deschutes!"
"This is a very tasty and refreshing brew that delivers a lot of taste and has a nice smooth mouthfeel. I like!"
""
"Light and refreshing with a nice balance between the Belgian yeast and citrusy hops."
"Chainbreaker has a very light color, a bit lighter than wheat in the fields. The aroma is fantastic. You are immediatly hit by what can only be Cascade hops, just as if you had opened a bag of pedal hops. The taste is that of wheat with a mix of 4 hops. While the hop aroma is strong and refreshing, the hop flavor is present but not higly hopped. If you enjoy wheat beers and IPAs, this could easily become a summer favorite."
"Taste is smooth and light. Belgian yeast prevalent but not overwhelming. Hops also on the light side. Smooth, refreshing, enjoyable. A decent offering, not great. A good fun session beer just in time for summer."
""
"O: I like this beer, a lot. I have said before that I am not an IPA fan really but some specialty ones have really hit home with me. This one most of all so far. The Belgian yeast overpowers some of the hops which tend to be too much for my palate in most IPA leading to a really powerful but not overbearing hoppyness. This is (as of now) my favorite IPA. Must be an IPA (kinda)."
"Mouthfeel is light. Overall, it's a pretty good beer."
"O - Light and refreshing, but the belgian yeast totally overpowers any other flavors and dominates all that you can smell and taste."
""
"- This is a stand-out beer. As for Spring releases, I think this one will take the cake. This beer is very solid, very balanced, very complex, and just very damn good. I highly recommend drinking a lot of these. Huge fan here."
"Overall a drinkable beer. I'll be looking forward to some of this on a hot summer day."
"A refreshing beer, definitely could see enjoying a couple of these on a warm summer day. I was happy to see that the coriander and Belgian yeast did not become too dominant."
""
"O- A nice spring/ summer sipper. Might not fit the IPA moniker, but it is refreshing and tasty. Also, Bottle says 5.6% ABV rather that the 5.1 noted above."
""
"Overall: While I liked the sound of it, this beer didn't seem to choose a direction to go in as far as style goes. It felt like a not fully integrated mixture of APA, witbier, and hefe at times. Still is worth a go and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Pours a diaphanous light yellow ale with a sheet of white foam and spotty lace throughout. Phenols, coriander, citric hops, slightly plastic. Flavor is sweet and wheaty with a good bitterness up front and an interesting citric rind character on the finish with a witbier taste. Full bodied with hi carb and a dry finish. A decent beer, and one of the more approachable Belgo style IPA's I've had. Probably won't be found buying this one too often however."
"O: What I would expect from a Deschutes Belgian/White IPA. More hops would be welcome, but overall its still a refreshing and drinkable beer."
""
"I rarely buy witbiers as most domestic examples seem to balanced toward the spices or are too light body... this brew is perfect for summer sipping and lawn work.... I will make sure my wife (who loves wits) gets a bottle or two... I bet she has a new favorite."
"Overall: This is a nice drinkable IPA that arrives just in time for summer. I have a feeling that when it gets hot outside this will become one extremely popular beer around the pacific northwest."
""
"O- Pretty good, but expected a bit more from Deschutes. Could be hoppier, but possibly this is exactly what they were going for. I could see this being very refreshing on a hot day in the summer. It is also nice to see Deschutes kicking out a new brew. Too bad some of their pub only beers are not in bottles."
"Overall not a favorite, reminds me a lot of Conflux."
""
""
""
"overall - i expected a little more from deschutes on this one, it's almost like their version of blue moon, there are some decent citrus hop notes and it's probably a decent summer session beer but not an amazing brew"
""
"On-tap at Old Chicago's. Served to standard pint glass. The beer arrives a hazy golden/yellow that is fairly light. A 1/2 finger white head with some retention and lacing. A pleasant blend of citrus and spice on the nose with a hint of belgian yeast. Orange, coriander, lemon, pepper. Nice. The tastes again follows the nose with the citrus flavors and a more pronounced spice. Tangy almost in flavor with a medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean. Medium bodied with good carbonation. As I am not a huge fan of the Belgian IPAs I found this beer to be a good representation that was easy to drink and didn't overdo any of the flavors or characteristics and as such was pleasantly surprised. I would not hesitate in ordering another."
"O - A pretty good Whitbier, pretty crisp, but not extraordinarily standout. A little above average for the style, and I would get this again since I love whitbiers."
""
"5.9% now"
""
"The body was decent, not heavy nor crisp, and had good effervescence. Drinkability was good, but I can't see myself having more than one at a time. Overall, a fairly decent beer, but one that didn't really trip my trigger. Maybe this combo of of hops and Belgiany yeast just isn't my thing. Certainly worth trying if you see it."
""
"Clear yellow-orange liquid with a small, fizzy, white head; minimal lacing. Citrus and fresh hops in the nose, light notes of spice and funk. Crackery malts on the tongue, citrus and piney hops, acidic wheat profile, and spicy yeast. Good for the style. Light-medium body and easily drinkable."
"Light in body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable! I almost got more of a witbier taste from this than an IPA...or maybe a mix of the two. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O - Very impressed, great marriage of IPA and Belgian Esters, lots of citrus, herbs, spices, hops, very complex, refreshing, and enjoyable, had to have a second pour."
""
""
"This was interesting. Almost like a cross between an APA, IPL, and Whitbier at times, which neither of these sides really stepping up and taking control of the overall experience. I’m glad that I gave this try, as it certainly had a unique spin on a couple of different styles but this ultimately didn’t leave a huge impression on me."
"I think if they upped the hops, this would work. Cool in theory, decent in reality."
"Really light but with an interesting witbier/ipa style thing going on. Worth checking out, though I wasn't filling my growler with it."
"O- A nice easy drinking lighter brew with a unique spice note to make things interesting. Worth a try."
