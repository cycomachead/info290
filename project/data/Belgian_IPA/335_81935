4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"White Hatter brewed by New Holland Brewing Company, an has an ABV of 5.50%  This brew pours out a cloudy amber color, with a small white head. There is a lot going on in this brew.  The smell is sweet, grains, and malts.  Now for the taste, it is bold with flavor. You pick up on some citrus, malts, and hops. This is a nice drinking brew. The mouthfeel is bold , but clean, and relishing. Overall I'm giving White Hatter a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. New Holland Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. There is also some things floating in this brew, but it a nice drinking brew.","nicholas2121","Mar 27, 2015"

Taste was v. nice... interesting yeasty and crisp malty notes (bit of biscuit?). Strong citrus punch. Much better than the aroma dictated. Rather light mouthfeel, with a clean aftertaste.

It came rushing out, filling the glass with a pseudo-cascade and producing two fingers of mountainous, fluffy, bone-white head that slowly fell, leaving great lacing in its wake. Color was a VERY cloudy orangish-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9). Nose had a musty citrusiness, kind of lemony, but also very dry and dusty like newspapers in an attic. Mouthfeel was soft, caressing my poor, bruised tongue like an old friend. This was like hops tea! It was really mellow, with loads of flavor, like lemon zest, mango, peach, pear, garden flowers and some black pepper. i felt like I was being lulled into a nap. The finish was quite dry, thanks to the spices, but on a hot, humid afternoon, I really enjoyed it.","woodychandler","Jul 11, 2014"

2.84,-20.9,4,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Final Word: Sorry folks, but I donâ€™t recommend this one! Iâ€™m always reluctant to tell people not to try a beer, but this one just felt like New Holland needs a bit more time to perfect it. The hop and wheat flavors countered each other very well, but the sticking point with this beer was the bubblegum fluoride aroma and flavor. Some wheat beers have a bit of a bubblegum flavor in them, but the degree to which itâ€™s present in this beer is completely out of balance with the other ingredients. It doesnâ€™t complement nor mesh with the other flavors, and doesnâ€™t seem to have a place in the brew. I donâ€™t feel like this is a problem inherent to the fact that itâ€™s a Belgian Style White Pale Ale, but instead that itâ€™s a sub par batch or a recipe that needs perfection. If youâ€™re the type that wants to try something new, Iâ€™d wait a year or two and see if this brew is still around, as by then Iâ€™d say theyâ€™ll have worked out the kinks or you have a chance of getting a better batch than I did, but otherwise Iâ€™d choose many other wheaty beers over this one if I wanted that fix. But hey, if you love bubblegum fluoride, have at it!","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 18, 2014"

At least it was not offensive, kind of like drinking a weak sparkling water.","Ozzylizard","Beers"

This was pretty unique but only because I've never had a Belgian IPA that was supposedly brewed like this. The bottle says that there were notes of coriander and grains of paradise here, along the lines of a Sam Adams Summer offering. While they could be detected to some extent, the citrus bite faded quickly after the initial kick. Had they endured longer, it would have rounded out this beer nicely and complemented the Belgian aspects of this. Take it for what it is - it's a fun style that served as a steppingstone for what else is possible and still went down relatively easily.","JerzDevl2000","Aug 21, 2013"

Bitterness lingers with an apple like sweetness lingering on the tip of the tongue. Medium bodied with prickly mouthfeel. Beer gets a bit better as it warms as your tongue grows accustomed to the bitterness as well. Let's some of the more subtle flavors come through and shows off the complexity of the beer.

Aroma is full of citrus, spice, and orange peel notes. A nice bready yeast/malt combo going on, almost like a Sam Adams Summer Ale I also notice grains of paradise on the ingredients listed on the bottle. Flavors are really combined into a spice mix pack with a mediocre IPA with citrus forward hops. Very dry presentation the bitterness comes from the spices, orange peel, and hop additions. Somewhere in the mad mix of adjuncts you have a drinkable beer, medium bodied spritzy carbonation, dry bitter finish.

I poured the beer in a tulip glass and it is light copper with thin white head that is leaving a slight lace. The smell provides coriander and slight pine tones. The taste has the scent plus some peppery kicks. The mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a good beer and certainly worth a try.","WoodBrew","Aug 24, 2012"
4.42,23.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2012 vintage(June release). Pours hazy golden amber color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, pepper, wheat, coriander, herbal, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of lemon, pepper, clove, orange zest, herbal, wheat, earth, floral, coriander, grapefruit, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of citrus, pepper, coriander, wheat, clove, earth, floral, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Medium high carbonation and medium body; with a slightly sticky and quite crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a fantastic Belgian White. Awesome balance of hops flavor, spices, and yeast character; and extremely crisp and smooth to drink. Fantastic, and I really did not expect it to be as good as it was. A welcomed surprise.","superspak","Aug 21, 2012"

The hop profile is really mid country, there is a lot of pineapple, orange, and lemons zestas well as a lot of other fruity notes. I did not get much of the ""white"" aspect of this beer but I bet it would be easier to differentiate by doing a side by side with the classic mad hatter. Drinks really easy and quite refreshing. A great white IPA, if my memory serves me right I like this more then the original but I didn't have the original fresh from the tap.","TwelveOunces","Jul 31, 2012"

The nose is very spicy with significant waves of coriander, cloves, orange peel along with plenty of earthy hops. The nose is incredibly floral and fragrant. The taste matches the nose with flowers and spices up front. The beginning is all White Ale, the finish features a nice wave of hop bitterness. This is an interesing combo, reminds me of some of the other Belgian Pale Ales with more spices. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing wiith a nice balance. Overall, this is worth a try.
