2.73,-28.7,3,3,2.5,2.75,2.75,"Beer had big flavors but they were not balanced. Sweet fruit taste clashed rather than enhance. Also, somehow even with the big flavor, the alcohol was noticeable. This one was bottled in 2011, so maybe the age detracted.","msquared36","Dec 22, 2014"

3.8,-0.8,,,,,,"Toffee sweetness, confectioners sugar, pear, green apple, and clove dominate the aroma. Great ester profile. There's a hint of must. Flavor reveals tart crabapple at the base, with notes of peach leading into a slightly sweet, toasted malt backbone. The finish is peppery and a touch bitter.  Perfumey esters add complexity. Alcohol surfaces in the aftertaste. That tart character dominates a bit more than I'd prefer, and adding in the booze makes it almost have an acetone quality.","barczar","Dec 14, 2014"

4.08,6.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"OVERALL: A very good beer. Lots of good aromas and flavors, and definitely showcases the spicy nature of Belgian yeast, which is a hallmark of this style. I would have liked to see more hop flavor perhaps as opposed to the hops simply providing bitterness, but the spicy and estery qualities of the yeast made this an enjoyable drink. Though the fuller feel is definitely not Belgian in character, I’m a fan and appreciated the creamy fullness here. Definitely a quality brew that’s well worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again dad!","Jeffo","Oct 16, 2014"

2.89,-24.5,3.75,2.75,2.5,4,3,"This pours a cloudy very light copper color with a medium head and average retention. Lacing is pretty good. The smell is unfortunately overpowered by alcohol, although when straining to see past the alcohol I find some nice fruit, including cherry and berry, and malt tastes, and it's clear there's some yeast being used here. The taste suffers from a lack of balance, with the alcohol flavor out of control. The yeast seems to offer some nice flavors, but the label on the beer says that it is "Impregnated with loads of hop character", and yet I find very, very little hop character here at all. By the way, don't drink this beer when pregnant or when looking for a balanced and flavorful beer. Anyway, it's OK--it's not well thought out, like the Gravitation beer, and I wish I hadn't bought such a large bottle of it. The mouthfeel is drying but spot on as far as thickness, but overall it's a beer I would try again as it needs to be reconstructed.","DeFaz","Nov 16, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and citrus-like hop aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

I could have one of these every once and a while and while it is still quite tasty, I enjoy having a few beers, and by the feel of this so far, this would be a beer I could have one over a good deal of time. Delicious as a beer, but for my drinking preferences, I would like it a little weaker. Still a damn good brew. Sorry if this was a bad review.

I'm alos getting a spicy, bready beer that somehow maintains this light body and fruit taste (along with candi sugar and caramel sweetness) yet has a somewhat "hot" finish - the ABV kicks in out of nowhere and just packs an almost medicinal, boozy finish at the last second. This is a great beer, I love the mix of hops and citric twang against this sturdy sweet malt base and then quite frankly a high ABV that can get you in trouble. Not as complex as a Belgain triple but doesn't mean it's a great beer (and as a sidenote: here in VA it's $6 - a similiar beer - Allagash Hugh Malone which was stacked right next to it is $14 - in this economy a $6 bomber that can deliver the goods is mighty nice).","clayrock81","Feb 14, 2012"

Full-bodied, the carbonation is present throughout but not sufficient to impact the general creamy mouthfeel, just brings a percolation under the surface. Richer and close to poached feel in the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, guava fruit. This aided by juicy pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus notes. Crusty pie flakes and dough, cinnamon and nutmeg, no real “sharp” spiciness, maybe a pinch of pepper.

Some nice thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass as well. Aromas of lemon, grass, pepper. spices, banana, and clove. Some nice and fairly strong aromas. Taste of big banana, clove, pepper, spices, lemon, and breadiness. A bit of a yeasty tang in the back. Decent amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pepper, spices, citrus, and clove. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel. Great drinkability for being over 9%. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden, nothing but a small warming after the finish. Overall this is an excellent and well balanced hoppy Belgian golden ale.

The sweetness is mostly lost, and there is a slightly acrid bitterness, and the hops seem a bit of a mismatch here. I'm craving a fruity note or some sweetness- instead I get entirely too much dry herbalness, a bitterness that seems a bit too astringent, and a bit of acrid sourness.

4.13,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle served in my Spiegelau tulip. Bottle conditioned in 2011 notched on the label. Pours a dull, burnt orange with a hazy clarity and a half inch frothy, bright white head that quickly disperses towards the edges leaving a creamy band around the edges and a soapy skim across the surface. Light fruity esters initially hit the nose (melon fruits); however, there is also a suggestion of candi sugar and a slightly herbal/medicinal quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose - all the aromas present in the nose nicely coalesce. Fruit and candi sugar is a bit more prominent and there's a light herbal bitterness that comes out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation and a slightly oily texture. All and all, I really dig this brew - not at all what I would expect from a Belgian IPA (less hoppy and more fruity); more of a Belgian Strong Pale ale in the Duvel family in my opinion. The alcohol on this is dangerously well-hidden - I didn't realize it was 9.90% until a slight buzz ensued. The flavors also seem to be much more prominent as the brew warms. This is one of the best additions to Smutty's line-up in years in my humble opinion.","Jwale73","Aug 08, 2011"

4.52,18,4,4.5,5,4,4,"had this on tap at Andy's Corner Bar (twice), pours a rich golden hazy color with a thin off white head, it smelled of grape fruits, semi bitter hops but overall tangy fruits. taste is of nothing i have even had before as there is a lot going on here, very complex, there is lots of citrousy notes along with some pleasant hops and the taste differs slightly as it warms up, this one is very different, its unlike any other belgian ipa i have drank before, the mouthfeel is very nice with a slight bite on it as you sometimes get from eating grape fruits, this is for me is pretty drinkable, if you can find it drink it!","whitehouse50","Feb 17, 2009"

4.16,8.6,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours nicely. No head. Mild nose. Nice tangy profile mixed with a mild dough edge. Full and consistent ride. Smooth feel. A very good American interpretation of this style. Had this and many others at Mugs Belgian shindig and this was clearly the winner for me.","RblWthACoz","Jan 01, 2008"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Glowing, slightly hazy tanned-amber in color. Thin coating of creamy, bright white head that holds throughout the entire tulip leaving thin lacing. Bright, almost tart fruity esters: green apple, pineapple, and banana. Underlying candied sweetness. The taste begins with a mellow candied sweetness that is soon met with a ripe citric tartness. A lingering yeast-mustiness with a faint spicy profile. The alcohol presence is subtle but warming on the back of the palate. A light medium in body; mellow and smooth. Surprisingly drinkable at 9% abv. Very similar to La Chouffe's hop offering; however, The Gnome's flavors seem more rounded and balanced.","NEhophead","Aug 28, 2007"
3.26,-14.9,4,3,3.5,3,3,"All in all, it seems that "intense" is a good word choice when describing this beer. This is definitely an American take on a style known for its smoothness and subtle nuances. In my opinion, it has nothing on the "real" gnome.","Damian","Aug 26, 2007"
4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Sampled several of these and even took notes (!) at the Blind Tiger in NYC, p0ured kind of flat unfortunatly, cloudy dark apricot, leaving just a smidge of lacing, nose is Belgian yeastyness, and fruits and flavor notes were of more fruits, bananas, yeast and the expected crisp and spicy and resiny hops. Alot of interest here, respectable take on a style I love, looking foward to more of this from Smutty and hopefully lots of other American and Belgian brewers.","Billolick","Apr 07, 2007"
