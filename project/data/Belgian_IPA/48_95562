3.88,-1.3,4,4,4,3.25,3.75,"Poured amber; slightly hazy; very large and durable bone-colored head; bands of sticky lacing. A full pour still left some dark brown sediment in the bottle. Very appealing aroma with brown bread, ripe fruits and a hint of toffee. The flavor follows largely, with intensity building through the finish and into the aftertaste. Very good sweet/bitter balance with an overall slightly sweet character. High ABV is well hidden in the nose, but only partly hidden in the feel and upon tasting. Nice hints of raisins and brandied dates, along with some hop notes, in the aftertaste. Tastes considerably darker than it actually looks. O: less well known than Piraat but worth seeking out.","chinchill","Mar 27, 2015"

Aroma is caramel, hay & biscuit, sweet fruity esters of Belgian yeast, especially banana & hints of orange & apple, some cloves & other spices, honey, some alcohol, earthy & grassy hops but less than expected.  Taste is biscuit & caramel malt, sweet fruity yeast: banana, peach, pear & candy apple, cherry with a hint of citrus; honey, alcohol, earth, floral & grassy hops with a nice bitterness in the boozy finish & aftertaste.

Aroma of bready malt, apple and pear juice, Belgian yeast, cloves, spicy. Flavor of bready and mildly biscuit malt, apple family fruit, light candi sugar, Belgian spicing. Finishes with a nice combination of grassy hop bitterness and cloves, giving a spicy Belgian feel to the hops. Not much herbal hop flavor, but the dry hopping is apparent in the finish. Medium bodied with nice sharp carbonation. Piraat has been one of my favorite Belgain ales and I was uncertain how I would like this hopped version. No concerns, there is a nice balance between the Belgian base ale, the hops and the traditional Belgian spices. Alcohol is surprisingly well covered. I will be drinking this happily along side the regular Piraat whenever it shows up.","LiquidAmber","Aug 18, 2014"

Features the following hops: Saaz, Tetra, and Aurora, with Cascade for the dry hopping. Fans of Belgian pales and ales in general will probably be pleased.
