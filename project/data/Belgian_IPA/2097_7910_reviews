"This isn't an awful beer, but it needs a new name, I think. Surprisingly boozy and sweet. Not as simcoe forward as I was expecting and hoping."

"Kuhnhenn puts out some great beers. Some fantastic beers. This is neither. This is barely above average at best. Too many weird aromas and flavors that just didn't play well together, and definitely didn't agree with my palate. I'll pass on this one next time."

"O - Amazing. IPA isn't my favorite style, but this interpretation is very very good. I expect the freshness of having this from a new growler may account for my score being substantially higher than the average. If you have the means to try it on tap, don't miss it."

"Orangey red, with a white head, thin ring of bubbles and some spots of lace. Nose of Simcoe, citrus and orange zest and a mild ""pulpy"" character. Belgian yeast spiciness comes through prominently as well. Taste has sweet malt, more Simcoe orange-y zest and Belgian yeast in the finish retaining a good bit of sweetness. Medium full body, slight chewy texture and medium carbonation. Delicious flavour profile, one of my favourite hoppy Kuhnhenn offerings."

"Appearance is mainly orange, some amber with a nice one finger head atop it. The nose contains citrus fruit, hops, yeast, a very pleasant smell to it. Sipping on this high abv ipa and I taste grapes, fruit, candy, hops. This is a nice tasting beer, albeit a bit boozy. Mouthfeel is medium, a bitter and sweet finish. If you come across it, I recommend it."
"A dark, cloudy amber tea color with a solid white head and nice lacing. The aroma brings a nice tea clove and banana/citrus hop. Mild but very nice. The flavor brings a sweet banana bubblegum and grassy wheat grain with a lemony touch throughout. Maybe an orange idea too. This is medium-plus bodied with a pretty thick feel over tiny carbonation that brings a tingly addition. The citrus banana bread is different, it's a Belgian ale that’s sweet and unique. Not disappointing though I’m not sure I’d pay another $18 a half growler for a repeat performance, but arguably worth it. Nice!"

"O - Based on the name, I was expecting more bitterness. Overall, a decent beer, but too thick for a Belgian style and not bitter enough for an IPA."
"O: This beer is quite interesting for the style due to the flavors of bananas from the yeast. It seems like it could use a little more hop flavors and associated bitterness."
"O: Another really good beer from a quality American brewer doing European style beers. Very easy to drink and quite enjoyable with a really interesting flavor combination."
"O - Guess I expected more hops, but this is quite fruity and spicy. The yeast component is nice, and this is probably the creamiest pale ale I've had. Interesting, but probably not something I would go back to."

"Don’t really know what to base it on or what to expect from the style (Pale American Belgo style), but it was better then the tangerine wit and the loco yokel that my gf and my dad tried. Very drinkable."
""
"Overall: The weird off flavor took over this beer for me. It could have been good, but just didn't get there."
""
""

"Typical average american made BIPA. Heavy on the tropical fruit hops. A sweet malt to go along with a tropical fruit hop profile just doesn't do it for me."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a very interesting beer, lots of tropical fruits, nice hop flavor, good malty backbone with kick of booze. I could put back a few of these despite the abv."
"o - Overall I liked this one, thought the RDIPA was better. Wish the nose was a bit stronger, but the taste and mouthfeel made up for it. Would have it again."
"If you normally prefer the more citrusy strong IPAs, I would recommend switching out to this every now and again. I've had a number of Michigan Simcoe varieties, and this is definitely the best"
"I don't think this should be sour based on other reviews, but it also doesn't look like a beer that is traditionally aged, so who knows. Maybe it was a different beer in 08? Anyone have any insight, BM me. Thanks!"
"This beer pours out as a golden yellow color with a thin head to start off with. The head fades away pretty quickly. The aroma was a little hoppy, I expected it to be a little stronger on the nose. The taste was also a little lighter than expected but it was strong in the aftertaste. The Simcoe hops really shine through on the back end of this beer. The mouthfeel is average, it's not thick or watery so much. It's just about right. Pretty good brew."
"Taste is good, an enjoyable pale but doesn't live up to the name. I ordered ""Simcoe Silly"" so I expect a slap of simcoe. Disappointing, but given a different non-misleading name, I would have really dug it."
"Poured a moderate orange-copper color with a white head that didn't last long at all and really didn't provide any sort of lacing. The nose was just a mess with some yeast going atop some pine and floral hops and the floral hops taking on a grassy, medicinal astringency. The taste was a bit worse with a bit of alcohol and the flavors just clashing completely. Alcohol in the feel. This just did not drink well and was unfortunately not a good beer. I'd like to think I just got this at the wrong time and would be up for trying it again, as I'm normally a fan of pretty much everything that Kuhnhenn does."
"It drinks okay for a beer of its strength I guess, but the alcohol isn't covered up all that well. Because of the wet finish I'm not finding it refreshing and I am not eager to get to the next sip. So far my least favorite Kuhnhenn beer I've tried."
"I had this on tap at the brewery into a tulip...One of the few disappointments on an otherwise outstanding night...Pours a very dark orange, almost brown. Tope head, good lacing and retention. Aroma is light hops, notes of cloves, banana and bubblegum. Super sweet here, not in a good way at all. The taste is also way to sweet, banana and bubblegum, a total lack of hops. Wheat finish...The feel is ok, not easy to drink just way to sweet. This is not a pale ale...This beer is really not good, needs to be much more balanced with hops. If you want bubblegum get a gumballhead."
"Growler courtesy of Puzzl over on RB. RateBrackets 2010. I have had this many different times over the years so it was nice to re-visit this beer. Hazy orange pour with a fizzy off white head and drippy lace. Aroma is dusty with subtle hints of tropical fruit and pine. Hops were rather subdued in comparison with my previous samples of this beer. Drinks like a saison with a modest hop bite. Spicy dry finish."
"I think I liked this out of all proportion. It seemed fairly simple, but at the same time insanely drinkable. Really good stuff. Thanks to Andrew for bringing this growler back from Michigan!"
"D: Very nice. I'd like another and would buy again. I'd maybe get a pack of these for a party."
"On tap at the Kuhnhenn brew pub. Poured a clear, dark golden orange with little head. Had a sweet orange fruit taste with a hop bite up front, and finished with a yeasty spice kind of after taste. Almost like a belgian. Well I guess they have it classifed as belgian on here, and the brew put had it listed as a golden ale. It was a interesting offering, thats for sure. The 8.5% alc wasn't noticable at all. Decent beer overall."
"Chewy mull body with a lot of fresh floral hop bitterness as well as some nice sweet citrus character. The bitterness from the hops last but become less prominent as they are countered by the graham cracker and biscuit malts as well as a very prominent bready yeast character. Hits of light crisp fruit and ripe banana add to the complexity but the hops are the star here. As mentioned above they are very floral and sweet up front with a slight bitterness that lasts throughout into a delicious dry finish. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable. Usually I don't like hoppy beers to have this much of a malt backbone but I really enjoyed this one. i"
"Not a bad brew, but not my favorite from Kuhnhenn."
"Well, I was TOLD this was a strong IPA, so I was kind of disappointed. But to see here that it was a strong belgian pale ale, then it seems much more spot on. It poured a pretty clear dark coppery and smelled of light fruits and hops. The taste was pretty sweet and hoppy but finished slightly bland. It's mouthfeel was pretty decent and decently drinkable--but not enjoyable enough for me to want to."
"This is another interesting big beer from Kuhnhenn and the aroma didn't prepare me for the onslaught that I was going to get in the taste. Tons of different flavors from sweetness to floral to almost purfumy. I'm not convinced it comes together perfectly but I'm enjoying sipping on it."
"Overall, this beer just does not work. Nothing seems to fit together at all. Too much alcohol, too musky, and too much going on at once (in a bad way). Maybe I got a bad bottle, in which I would reevaluate, other I really don't plan on drinking this one again."
"Acquired this in a trade thanks to cosco. Pours honey in color with white head. I had no idea what to expect of this beer. I just assumed from the name that it would be an IPA, but that's not the case. Honestly, I don't know whether this is supposed to be any specific style. Regardless, on the nose, I'm getting hops (simcoe, I assume), sweet malt, and a tad of honey. Same with the taste, which is quite sweet and floral. But there are also some clove and spice qualities characteristic of a Belgian brew. So perhaps this is a hybrid? Body is a tad on the thick syrupy side for my taste, and drinkability suffers for it. An interesting beer, but it doesn't come across as tightly focused. A bit of multiple personality disorder here with too much going on for my taste."
"D - I don't think I will make it through this one beer."
"An interesting beer, it definitely works for the most part, though it can be a touch cloying at times (though not really if you take the 10% alcohol into account). This is a nice beer, one that certainly combines the Simcoe hops and the Belgian yeast pretty well, but somehow it seems like it could have been much more interesting; I am not exactly sure why though, perhaps it is a touch too sweet, and it doesn't quite seem complex enough somehow."
"I really wanted to try an offering from Kuhnhenn on tap and I was totally and completely underwhelmed by this beer."
"D: I don't view this as a Belgian strong pale ale, rather a weizen-IPA mix (a German IPA, perhaps?). Whatever it is, I like it and could tolerate another glass or two."
"Served in a tulip, low white head, good lacing, amber body. Grapefruit dominates on this first beer of the day. Same on the nose. Very easy to drink, lightly bitter. Balanced carbonation and sweet/bitterness. Banana, and bubble gum in the finish. Wheat malts?"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with low carbonation."
"Growler (29/04/2010): Juicier than I remember it being on tap but esters still dominating. Big and bold and still doesn't pull it together for me. Thanks to Bartle!"
"Overall not bad, not my favorite from them, but not bad at all. I would love to try this one fresh on tap as I am sure it was intensely good."
"HV"
"On tap at the brewery. Poured a cloudy pale orange into an oversized wine glass. Smell and taste were a combination of bubblegum, pepper, coriander, cloves, and banana. Smooth, drinkable, and not overly strong, but the flavor faded fairly quickly in my opinion. While I was drinking this I swore it was a Tripel, but I guess the difference in the styles is still blurry to me."
"Bottle: Poured a medium copper color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of simcoe hops with semi-sweet Belgian malt backbone is quite interesting. Taste is a mix between some quite sweet Belgain ale with some green simcoe hops clearly noticeable. Full body with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very well done and a lot more complex then just a Belgian hop bomb."
"Notes from 1/12/06"
"Drinkablity - Remarkably smooth and dangerous. On just a sip, I would never guess that this is 8.5%."
"Bottled on 4-4-09"
"Not my favorite of Kuhnhenn's brews by any means but not bad compared to others out there, this should probably be listed under a Belgian IPA judging by its taste, definitely one of the more hoppy Belgian-style beers I have tasted in quite some time, might drink again, worth trying"
"D-One of the better Belgian IPA's (quickly becoming my favorite style) I have had. Wonderful fruity flavour with a sharp citrus smack. Good job Kuhnhenn!"
"Big ups to my man Erik for the hook-up on the long distance growler!"
"Very smooth, complex, and rich; full bodied yet easy to handle. An awesome offering and one of my favorite taps at Kuhnhenn!"
"The alcohol is not perceived at all, but it's drinkability suffers a tad just from how overhwelming in size the taste is is. If you get a chance you should definitely try it, but one is already a huge amount to make sense of."
"While Simcoe Silly gets my nod for the oddest beer to cross my gullet lately, it earns little else. It's just too much. The flavors don't mesh all that well... you know that crazy uncle of yours who has no social graces and tries to compensate by telling dirty jokes (loudly) at family gatherings? Yeah, that's this beer."
"Thanks to kkulacki for getting my growler filled! Pours a cloudy orange with a solid, small head that builds our of a very pretty reverse cascade of bubbles. Odor is lemony, grassy, also bubblegum and bananas. Smells fresh and delicious. This is one of those style-spanning beers that you can't really place with anything else and don't really want to. Hop bitterness and phenolic malt up front, with lemony simcoe hops growing along with a peppery banana. Alcohol evident but not overbearing. Heavy, but still crisp. Very, very drinkable. Kuhnhenn can do no wrong."
"D- Very impressive. I am absolutely blown away. Kind of makes me think of an American DIPA made with Belgian yeast. My roommate said it tasted like an alcoholic orange cream sickle. Get some."
"Really drinkable Belgian Strong Pale Ale hides the alcohol well. I have been enjoying this growler all weekend and will be sad to see it go"
"D: I'm enjoying this after a 15hour workday and i'm glad i chose this one!"
"Well carbonated and pretty easy to drink, just a hint of alcohol in the taste but it doesn't fell hot."
"The bottom line: Kuhnhenn justifiably have a reputation for unique, well-crafted beers, and Simcoe Silly is another example of that. Very complex taste profile, and certainly worth trying out if you run into it."
"Pours a murky dark sunset orange with a fluffy one finger off-white head that sticks around for a while. Good lacing left behind once the head descends. Smell isn't as hoppy as I was hoping seeing it has Simcoe in the title. Big yeasty aroma with sweet candy and banana. Very slight hops with an earthy pepper scent as well. The hops definitely shine up front in the flavor department, lots of citrus; clementine, pineapple, peaches, and grapefruit. The sweet hops are quickly taken over by the bready yeast which lingers in the aftertaste. Once again, I could use more hops in the taste department but I shouldn't complain seeing it's a Belgian Ale. Body is medium with a smooth feel and a fair amount of carbonation. Pretty drinkable for 8.5%, Kuhnhenn lives up to the hype once again. These guys really know what they're doing. Keep up the good work!"
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Easy to drink for sure. Try it if you can."
"Overall: This beer and Weyerbacher Double Simcoe are the Yen and Yang of Simcoe beers. The double simcoe is big bold and assualting to your senses. This beer does the same thing in such an opposite way. The sweet bubblegum and fresh fruit flavors of this beer are so unique. The double Simcoe shows off how Simcoe can be used in a big bold hoppy beer, and Kuhnhenn has shown with this one how you can craft a perfect Belgian brew using simcoe. I love it. It was a real joy to try this beer."
"I really enjoyed this. The addition of the Simcoe hops really added a nice countertouch to the yeast, spice, and sweetness of a regular Belgian Pale Ale. It's not hugely drinkable by any means but it hides it's ABV very well and is generally a fine steady sipper."
"Drinkability: Good stuff! I'd offer you some, but know what? Don't bother... cuz I already drank it all."
"D- This was just a little too different for me. I enjoyed trying it but it was a tad hard to finish."
"Note: The generous provider of this beverage mentioned that there were French sea salts added, which might account for some of the minerals."
"O: Good beer, very interesting glad I got to try it, the cloves that came out limited the drinkability for me. Interesting beer from a brewery that seems to like to try to push things. I can't wait to try more from them."
"This is a high quality beer....different and unique for sure but also high quality....when I sample something legit I know it and this effort speaks highly of this brewery....I can only dream of living close enough to this to try more..."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a slightly hazed golden/yellow, nice thick white head forms, settles to a layer but leaves some nice lacing. Smell is wacky, bubblegum, really estery from the Belgian yeast strain, caramel, almost banana, then big pine hops from the simcoe, some nice floral aroma as well. Taste is similar, lots of sweet candi sugar goodness, bubblegum, caramel, pine and floral, yeast, weird mix of flavours but it works really well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, medium carbonation, bit of a dry finish, very smooth. People couldn't believe this is 10.5% (not 8.5% as listed!) Thanks for letting me borrow the jug Grub."
"I remember through a DL and tasting-induced haze that this is a growler I came back to a few times. I also remember why."
"BSPA? Ummm...okay. Don't expect such a thing when it's your time to drink it. It may be brewed with a Belgian yeast, but this does not it make. Medium amber with a sparse off-white head. Mild-moderate carbonation. Aroma is all pink bubble-gum and lots of it. Big bodied with a sweet, sticky lollipop taste. Cloying with moderate fusels in the finish. Bitterness is mild. Not really my cup of tea. I figured this would be the best of the evening but it really fell short."
"Very good beer. Big vibrant banana and candied roasted pineapple. Some piney earth on the mid palate. Malt is sweet and bordering on caramel. Layred and complex flavors. Bubblegum with some spicey notes. Delicious beer. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin is the only fault of this one."
"Overall, an extremely fun and easy strong drinkable beer. Flavors are fun and simple, yet bold. Awesome balance."
"Thanks to mcallister for bringing this one over to share. Hazy copper in color, with a thin white head that disappeared immediately. Huge piney aroma, with a catty note to it as well. A bit of yeasty and spicy aroma, although somewhat subtle. Candi sugar sweetness in the beginning, with some Belgian yeasty flavors, and a few spices. Slight caramel flavor. This beer is balanced well with some piney hop flavor, along with a bit of citrus rind. Not as much bitterness as expected from the aroma. Lower amount of carbonation. Very nice."
"This was really good, big thanks swoopjones!"
"drinkability is great, dangerours even. balanced and hides the alcohol very well. very smooth and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Interesting experiment but the phenolics were a bit disconcerting"
"Somewhat pale bronze in color. Moderate carbonation level. Floral aroma-slightly grassy with a mellow sulfury odor in the backround. Big malt flavor-good balanced bitterness and sweetness running together. Nice hoppy bitterness and flavor mix. Good mouthfeel-very slight twinge of alcohol harshness. Extremely drinkable beer and damn enjoyable. I think I might be relocating to be closer to Warren MI-these guys are impressing the hell out of me."
"D: Good. Very refreshing all around. Very strong as well!"
"The hop freshness in this beer was low. I am very interested in trying this one a bit younger. It is named after a hop afterall, no?"
"Another unique Kuhnhenn."
"I got a bunch of Kuhnhenn bottles while on the east side of the state and they all seem to have a bottling problem. I would love to try the taproom because these bottles aren't quite living up to the name."
"D: Fine for this one, not something I'll run right out and buy more of."
"I had this on tap at the Kuhnhenn brewery, poured into a chalice. The appearance was murky orange, kind of hazy. Smelled citrucy and sweet. I was surprised by the hops in the flavor, because Belgian pale ales usually aren't too hoppy. But it was pretty good. A little strong in alcohol flavor maybe, but not too bad."
"Sampled on draught @ Kuhnhenn Brewing Company in Warren, Michigan. Light yellow color. Moderately aromatic, with herbal, fruity hop aromas and a ligtt hint of passion fruit and coriander. Heavily fruity, loaded with passion fruit, tangerine, orange, coriander, peach and curacao. Well hidden alcohol with an herbal base. Seemed like the spices, malt and yeast contributed more in my sample, as the pine-like simcoe flavor was pretty light."
"Very unique Belgian-American hybrid. Hazy amber color, fluffy white head. Complex Belgian yeast profile, dry, estery, and slighty woody. Contrasted is a heaping amount of Simcoe hops. In essence, these are seemingly two contrasting flavors, but this works. Not highly drinkable, however. ABV was 10% on tap at the brewery."
"at the brewery, on tap, poured a amber golden color, with a small off white head. aroma banana, bubble gum,orange, and hops. flavor alcohol, bubble gum, hops hints of orange . like the alcohol bite on the tongue as it warmed. another good one from the brothers"
"Mouthfeel...AGAIN sits heavy on the tongue. Medium bodied and sweet with complimentery sweetness."
"Flavor is all about the citrus and the alcohol is not as up and front as I was expecting. Hops are nice and lemony tart. Briefly preceded and followed by a quick sweet maltiness. Very balanced and pleasureable. Slight Belgian spiceniess too. This would be a nice dessert beer. The alcohol ha only a slight presence and really blends in well with the lemony citrus. Surprisingly light body and refreshing. Way too easy to drink because this beer will knock you over."
"This is a beautiful beer. It represents an old-world and new-world fusion that works. While others may not appreicate these crazy American hops monkeying with their Belgian ale, I don't think they are ill-placed, over-stated or spoiling to the enjoyability of this beer. Is it true to style?-- not exactly. Does it work?--- absofuckinlutely."
"Orange colour with a thin, cream coloured head that formed very nice lacing. The aroma was a combination of belgian spiciness with lots of cloves, coriander, banana, and apple fruitiness with citrusy, and slightly piney, American hops. The flavour was more of the same, with a juicy citrus character and great balance. Good attenuation with little residual sugar/stickiness and well integrated carbonation. Smooth. For the high abv, this is a frighteningly drinkable beer. The flavour combination might not work for some, but I found it to be interesting. Definitely something that I'll look for again. Too bad they didn't have any bottled when I tried it at the brewery."
"One of only a few Kuhnhenn brews I have had a chance to try,poured a deep copper with a deep orange tint,aromas really stood out for me with this beer fruity apricot and very ripe pineapple with a light spice note.Very fruity and ""big"" tasting orangey and spicey some cloves mainly with a noticable hebal hop flavor in the finish.This was quite big not sure if I could much but it was flavorful and quite tastey."
"Amber color with just a slight haze, and a slight head (although that is probably due more to the glass I was drinking from). The aroma has a nice grapefruit rind and orange character. I do get a little banana, but not the bubble gum the label not mentions. The taste is hop forward with more of the grapefruit rind, the bubblegum does come across here with just a hint of caramel on the finish. Delicate, but full mouth feel, nicely drinkable, really for any season (especially this warm fall day). Nice beer, hard to pick a style for it. (APA?)."
"Hmm ... though it's interesting and worth the try, it's not overly drinkable. I do like the uniqueness of this beer, and flavors that make you think, but one was enough. Interesting use of hops for the style, but I don't think it works."
"Another nice offering from the guys at Kuhnhenn. Poured out to an amber color with a nice head that stayed steady. Rather cloudy, but no sediment was found. Nice lace around the glass, too. Odors of bananas, malt and almost clover were noted. Flavor was a little to alcohol for my taste, but true to form for the style. Smooth, slightly creamy yeast and malt flavors, with a light syrup-like quality. Finished smooth, with a bubblegum like aftertaste. Not a bad beer, but could use some improvements here and there. Still a solid beer, but I really feel that the prevalence of alcohol was too strong, and took away from the overall enjoyment of this beer. Still, I must recommend this beer for fans of the style."
"Overall, I would say that one or two of these a night would suffice. It is a very good and tasty beer to sip and enjoy in moderation. As far as Belgian strone pales go, this is not near the top of the list, but otherwise enjoyable."
"OK, I gotta be honest. I heard good things about this beer, especially the aroma. It smells like a sack full of buttholes. I tried drinking it but the rank smell scared the hell out of me. If you hold your nose its actally not a bad beer, the mouthfeel is solid, the taste isn't bad...the only problem is it stinks. Drinkability suffers due to the fact I need to hold my nose to drink it. That gets old quick. I just got a cast removed from my broken hand. The beer smells alot like that nasty old cast."
"The mouthfeel is good for the style, but it leaves a rough tingle on my tounge that's a bit awkward. Between the 8.5abv and odd nose, I would switch to something else in this style. At the same time, this could be a great beer as it tastes really good, but other aspects could use some help."
"Clear, light copper body topped by a half-inch of off white foam. Sparkling amber highlights accent the body. The aroma is sweet pine and florals. On the palate, this beer is very sweet up front, with nice bitterness in the mid, and a lingering bubble gum finish. Hints of alcohol become a bit more pronounced as you proceed. The mouthfeel is very thick, but falls short of syrupy. Excellent drinkability. Really a superb beer. The use of some type of Belgian yeast gives this beer it's unique character. Very creative."
"Superb color, a cloudy ghosty orangey brown topped by a foamy off-white head. Aroma is piney, containing a strong hop impart, highly yeasty yet intensely caramelic, woody and orangey. Ive never smelled anything like this. A great original blend of less original flavours that work in unison. Wow, thats good. More earthy orange flesh paired along with piney and foresty floral and herbal butterscotch flavours. Rather complex, but most of all hypnotizing working well together factor. Moderately carbonated, perhaps a bit thinned-out mouthfeel, but still working well. Now Clark who was kind enough to share this growler insists that it is far more exciting, filling and better bodied fresh on tap and while I believe him, I certainly enjoyed this beer a whole lot."
"Mouthfeel was medium and it finished quite clean and refreshing after an initial sticky sweetness. Wont rate this very high on the drinkable scale, due to the seriously heavy perfume flavor."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" eggshell head over the bright copper brew. Head isn't as resilient as most Belgian-styles, but could be the alcohol coming into play, and lacing is average. Aroma is sweet, yet citrusy, not unexpected from the name, and it meets the advertising. Taste is tart citrus upfront, which changes gears to slightly sweet malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and interesting, and drinkability is excellent for the style and strength. Try it if you can!"
"Pours a peach-like color with a creamy white-head that leave a bit of lacing. The aroma is belgiany and candy-like, fruity and sweet. It is alcoholic and liquor-like in aroma too. The flavor is sweet and sugary...candy-like. It has a fruity, yeasty character too. It has some strength too it, but it is well hidden. An different beer, very interesting and tasty. Thanks to Stub-ob for sharing."
"Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. Looks like a standard pale ale in the glass, though it's marketed as a Belgian. This is a strange brew - a marriage of a belgian brew with a overdose of west coase (Simcoe) hops. Remarkable. Imagine La Chouffe meeting 90 minute pale ale and you get the idea."
"Many thanks to trbeer for making me the first beer recipient in BIF XV, and for sending me this gem. Can't wait to try the rest!"
"Once again, thanks to Brett and Eric for their world-class hospitality in giving us these rare beers to sample!! Well, definitely brings together just what I like...Belgians and hops and shows they aren't mutually exclusive in any way!! Esters meld nicely with the Simcoe hops to present a very unique beer, and one I enjoyed more than say Orval. Definitely another one of the ones I'll hope to try again!!"
"Drinkability is OK. Hop choice seems just too powerful for style and overpowers mre subtle notes."
"Get some."
"Almost a kind of crossover between a more standard English-style pale ale and something Belgian. Obviously, they seem to be going for the latter. But something about this dulls it out. Not bad and kind of interesting."
