"O: disappointingly, not much hop character;"

"Pours a hazy pilsner yellow with a finger and a half thick white head.  Smells of grass, earthy, wheat.  Tastes of wheat, bready, crystal malts, with earthy/grassy hop character with light citrus and spice.  Medium/light body with a smooth med carbonation.  Wheat and light pine resin on the aftertaste."

"way too fruity for me"
"Pours an opaque deep straw producing a huge, to the point of being difficult to pour, shaving cream fluffy, thick, white, lasting head that leaves rings, streaks & a wash of chunky lace. Aroma is a plethora of citrus: orange, tangerine, lemon, lime, backed by  cracker & biscuit malts with hints of grass, floral/herbal, Belgian yeast funk & chalky mineral. Taste is dry, chalky & lactic throughout with a bitterness that begins at mid-sip & intensifies until it becomes aggressive in the aftertaste with hints of biscuit, cracker, tangerine, lemon, lime, grass, floral, earth, spice, pepper & barnyard funk. Mouthfeel is light pushing toward medium bodied with aggressive carbonation, prickly, dry, drawing & with impaired drinkability."
"Pours a hazy straw color with two fingers thick of soapy head, settles to a thin ring, wispy rings of lace halfway down the glass. Smell: straw, floral, lemon custard, notes of orange and dried pineapple. Taste: pils-y and crackery base, quick blip of soft ester action overwhelmed by the substantial hopping... fairly clean at first with grass and citrus pitch, then into a grapefruit segment and lemon water with some pineapple-like acidity in the finish. Worth the single."

"Pours a clear, copper/maize color.  1/3 inch head of a white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of yeast, sweet malt, hops, slight citrus, slight alcohol, and slight tartness.  Fits the style of a Belgian IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level.  Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, hops, slight citrus, alcohol, and tanginess.  Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."

"O- Overall this is a nice belgian IPA.  Its pretty dry in character but nice and hoppy with a good amount of funk thrown in there too.  I really like what stillwater does in general.  This isn't my favorite of the Belgian IPAs-but it sure is a nice one."

"Pours gold color with a 2 finger foamy snow white head that was full of bubbles and faded extremely slowly, leaving excellent lacing. Smells and tastes of graham cracker, toasted grains, citrus hops, coriander, herbs, floral hops, caramel, biscuit, yeast and piney hops/pine cone. It seemed too grainy at first, but it grew on me as the balance was really nice and it flowed down like a session beer. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with average carbonation, some thickness and a slightly bitter finish with a slightly tart yeast essence. Nice above average Belgian IPA that tasted fresh on tap, but lacked the big hop accents I was hoping for."

"For a Belgian IPA, it is quite nicely balanced. The Belgian yeast flavors mingle quite well with the bitter resiny hop flavors."

"Carbonation is a bit over the top."

"O: a nicely crafted 'Belgian' IPA."
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy blonde hue with a creamy two finger head and a swirl of lacing,the smell is pineapple,some piney hops and that typical Stillwater funkiness,the mouthfeel is light bodied and well carbonated with tastes of mainly pineapple,a slight hint of barnyard funk,fruit salad and finished with a soft piney bitterness and overall abit of a weird one no IPA whatsoever for me but a very sessionable drop and easy to drink more than one of cheers."

"Stillwater's Belgian-style IPA is a near-perfect blend of Belgian and American tastes that start with the iconic fruity and spice balance of Belgian ale but also leads with the citrusy dryness of IPA. Yet secondary flavors of red apple and honey give the ale a not-so-fresh taste."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of a farmhouse ale, but I don't think it really fits into the Belgian IPA category simply because the hops are on the lighter side and they don't impart that bitterness that I would expect from a Belgian IPA. This beer had good drinkability it was smooth, fairly crisp, a little refreshing, a little dry on the finish and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these without getting bored with it, but I think that would be my limit and I think it makes for a nice beer to enjoy in the spring and summer. What I like the most about this beer was the funky yeast aspect, I thought it was at the right level and it's just what I expect from a good Farmhouse Ale. What I like the most about this beer was the drinkability, i liked how easy drinking it was and the fact that it was a little refreshing helped that out also. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop aspect, it was nice, but I wish the hops stuck out more and I wish there was a little more bitterness. I would buy this beer again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Farmhouse Ales. All in all I liked this beer, but I thought the hop profile held this beer back from being as good as it could be and I think with some more hops this would be a pretty great example of a Hoppy Farmhouse Ale. This isn't my favorite of the style or my favorite beer from Stillwater, but I still think it's a solid beer in it's own right. Nice job guys, this was a tasty easy drinking beer, keep up the solid work."

"Tasty enough but this beer doesn't deliver the hops as eluded to on the label. Perhaps not a fresh bottle."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/31/2013. Pours lightly hazy pale gold color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of of big lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, straw, light bubblegum, wheat, cracker, herbal and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and light-moderate malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, pepper, clove, floral, grass, straw, wheat, cracker, herbal, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, clove, grass, straw, herbal, wheat, cracker, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great hop/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly prickly/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Belgian IPA. All around good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hop, and light-moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: Slightly disappointing, but tastier nonetheless. Solid, vaguely funky farmhouse effort."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a light straw amber with a big, loose three finger white head that dissipates to a thick cottony film, leaving lots of lacing. Aroma of Belgian/saison yeast, Belgian spicing and nice grassy and floral hops. Flavor is a great blend of grassy hopped American IPA and Belgian saison with a spicy, saison yeast finish and bitterness. Medium bodied with active carbonation. One of the better hybrids of Belgian and American IPA styles, leaning a bit more towards the Belgian with spicing leaning more towards coriander than clove. Well made and nicely balanced. I was a bit tardy drinking this; it sat at the back of my fridge, but the hops have held up well. Fresh this may have a more even balance between the styles. Still very enjoyable and as expected from Stillwater."
""
"Pale and hazy gold with some nice sticky lacing. Smell is very saison like. Funky, wet hay and slightly sour and straw notes. Lots of Belgian yeast character with lemony hops that are slightly sharp and quite bitter. Quite dry with hop bitterness in the finish. Reminds me of a hoppy saison. Nice beer and take on the style. Growing on me as I drink it too."
""
"O.A.: for a style that I really don't like this was a very pleasant surprise, try it even if you don't generally like Belgian style ipas, definitely try it if you do!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very hazy honey golden color - pretty cloudy. Smell is very malty, chalky and lots of Belgian yeast. Taste is about the same, somewhat bitter and funky. Lots of yeast and some bitter citrus dominate, but not in a good way. Not worth the price."
""
""
""
"Another tasty, brutal beer from Stillwater! I'd go as far as calling this a palate wrecker, but it's got enough character to keep you interested while your tongue takes a beating. Well worthy your coin."

"M - Crisp, refreshing, sessionable, and somewhat unique due to the Belgian IPA meeting some hops. Dry and grassy finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly not a bad ale, but it could use some tweaking."
"A bold Belgian IPA, above average of their native counterparties, and it is actually mingled in the Saison territory."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very nice first impression by Stillwater here. An easy drinking, thirst quenching saison/belgianipa/whatever with nice cohesion between the yeast and the hops. The yeast does come through more than the hops, but it all works together rather nicely. Recommend to all, especially when the warmer weather hits."

"O - Very nice Belgian IPA. Lots of complex and interesting flavors going on. Quite enjoyable."
"O: This is great stuff. An aggressive assault of hops laid in a valley of Belgian pale glory. Nice an earthy with citrus bounty. Extremely drinkable Belgian IPA that is sure to please."
""
"O: As usual, Stillwater delivers a pretty tasty beer. definitely drinkable."

"The flavor has a grainy pale malt, with banana, lemon, citrus pith and a hoppy bitterness along with a Belgian drying. There's pepper and clove spiciness along with that strong phenolic note that continues."
""
"Pours into a small tulip glass a slightly hazed lemony yellow with a large blooming white head that settles very slowly leaving multiple rings of thick lace behind.Lemon oils,lightly spiced phenols,and toasted grain in the nose.Lemon comes to find upfront on the palate along with some grapefruit juice,toasted cereal grain and just a hint of funk and phenol spice round out the flavors profile.Not bad and kinda refreshing,not over the top with the yeast wich is a good thing...in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"What a strange palate of flavors! Where this beer starts, with clove and Belgian spicing works wonderfully, but that backside of plastic, smokey char, earthiness, and slight aspirin bitterness do not finish this beer well at all."
""
"A very nice beer, but very similar to the 2 other Stillwater beers I've had so far(cellar door and stateside) with maybe a bit more hops in this one. Their yeast strain seems to dominate. Definatly worth a try."

"O- My favorite Stillwater beer thus far and one of my new favorite Belgian IPAs. Gives Le Freak a run for its money."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really enjoyable and complex beer. My big gripe with this beer is the low level of carbonation. If this beer had more bubbles to open the palate and intensify those dry, musty flavors, it could be awesome. Still, another example of just how complex, drinkable, and varied Belgian IPAs can be."
""
""
"Loads of lemon and bright assorted citrus on the palate. I'd like a more prominent yeasty component, but this is still some tasty and quite worthy stuff. Biting, herbal and fresh tasting hops dry out the party in your mouth. Tasty and delicious. Go get some and enjoy. Super cool label is a bonus"
"I'm not a lemon fan, but this is a well constructed beer. The balance between flavoring and bittering hops is great, and it's nice to see some variety in the ipa scene. Not your typical west coast ipa. This would be s great lawnmower beer."
"Pours a murky light yellow-orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small chunks of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, chalk, and citrus aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, yeast, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is a tasty and very drinkable American example of a Belgian IPA."
""
"o: A nice summer drink, quite true to the Belgian golden ale style but with an American level hops kick."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I think this is a well crafted IPA. Nothing to give you the WOW factor but its a good offering from Stillwater. Nice job."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid spicy Belgian IPA. It has good bitterness, but the spice and funk overwhelm the hop flavors."
""
"O - A very nice brew. Belgian IPA or Hoppy Saison? Who cares it is very good!"
""
""
"Great mash up beer. If you love saisons/IPAs then definitely give this a try."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a really great beer. It's really interesting, and the hops are still satisfying and noticeable. The only thing that would make it better for me is if the mouthfeel was a little bit thicker. Incredibly well-done."
""
""
"Overall- This is a real solid beer. Even as ""old"" as it is, it's still quite enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best bottles & names I have ever seen. In case anyone was wondering yes the 3D effects do actually work with 3D goggles on. Not my favorite beer from them, but it was still enjoyable and well priced for the product. I think I have seen one more from them I haven't tried yet from their Colorado shipment. So far I'm very happy with this company."
""
"This one really grew on me as I drank it. A unique take on the Belgian IPA."
""
""

"A nice hoppy Saison with some residual bitterness. Certainly worth trying."
"O: Decent IPA but different. You can tell that it is Belgian due to the characteristic spice."
"Solid mix of a strong flavorful yeast with some nice hops on the back end."
"I very much enjoyed this, as it resembles a farmhouse ale, yet far hoppier and filled with funky Belgian yeast that adds extra complexity to the mild grain base. I'm seeing more beers come on that reach this level of quality and its good to see them more plentiful than ever around here. Tasty stuff - well recommended, especially on tap."
""
""
""
"I will have this one again!!!."
""
"O: The citrus aromas and flavors in this beer seem a little subdued, but it is still a pleasant drinking IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is quite well done and also easily consumable."
"Pours a bubbling, unclear straw color crowned by a tall, loose, frothy white head that has decent retention. The aroma is a blend of hops and yeast; lemon and crushed herbs with a peppery yeast touch and a bit of dried banana. Fresh citrus and floral hop flavor finishing with a lingering peppery spice. Just a little pale malt sweetness, but what is there is quite tasty. Spicy, crisp, and lively. Just a nice, fresh, hoppy beer with a properly done Belgian tilt. I am officially a fan of Stillwater."
"Light body with tight combination and a stronger hop presence than the nose suggests. There's a dry, crisp hop bite up front that lingers over the pale malt backbone into a dry finish. Earthy, grassy and slightly spicy with dry piny bitterness and subtle citrus zest. Some lemon peel character before finishing with biscuit malt, bread and cracker. Decent balance but it kind of falls off in the finish. Kind of watery and bland on the back end. Decent hop flavor and pretty easy to drink but I found this beer a bit bland. I guess if you just want to pound an easy to drink, aggressively hopped beer this old be appealing but I found it kind if boring."
""
""
"O - Nice profile; spicy, light, and dry."
""
""
""
"Has both characteristics of a BIPA and saison/farmhouse. It's highly hopped and balanced for an exceptional beer."

"O- Another great beer from Stillwater. Love the label and the price of four packs. This is a balanced mix between a Saison and an IPA, and it is very easy to drink!"
""
"O: Very good example of a Belgian IPA with some hints of Saison - nice flavors and easy to drink. I enjoyed this one and would definitely consider picking it up again."

"Overall (4.0): As mentioned above in the tasting notes, this was a good beer, overall, with some good to great qualities, but it wasn’t the hop bomb-saison/BPA fusion I was expecting or hoping for. Still, glad to have tried it, and it’s clear from drinking this and Brian has a vision for each of his beers and exceptional skill and ability in making that vision a reality. In this case, my vision of what this beer could be may not have lined up perfectly with the brewer’s—but that isn’t to say this isn’t a perfectly good beer, because it clearly is."

"more of a hoppy saison than a Belgian ipa, nitpicking of course. I liked this one a lot, very unconventional. the artwork is really cool too. pours a light cloudy straw color, still see through, but some sediment in suspension. over an inch of fluffy white suds on tap rising well above the brim of my pint glass. the nose is funky like some of their other saisons, smells like the saison yeast I used in my homebrew. fruity and tart, with a floral hop profile and assured bitterness. the taste agrees completely with the nose, this is a saison through and through. hoppy, but only on the back end, I expected it to be more aggressively done, and a pine complex would work well here, although all I really get is a floral character and pronounced bitterness. super light too, like the others ive had from Stillwater, elegantly malted. good carbonation and a nice light feel, plenty drinkable and a well hidden abv. another fine crafted ale from these guys, an imperial version of this would be fun..."

"O/D-Wasn't in love with this one. Not aggressive enough for me. More along the lines of a Belgian Pale than a Belgian IPA in my opinion."

"Why Cant IBU? I don't know, why cant u? This beer has a nice light golden color with some trace specs of faded yellow up towards the sides. A nice bright white head of foam up top with some vigor and sticking power, a slight haze throughout the liquid, looking quite nice, retention is there. For a kinda low ABV'ed Belgian IPA, this has more of a hoppy scent than Belgian yeast influence. I get some lemon, orange, pine and earthy scents coming out instead of bready yeasty malt. The musk kinda jumps out. Pretty smelling IMO, but I do get some perfume scents with warming. A very straight forward ale here, I get some of the Belgian bready yeast up front with some hop taste. Not your normal Belgian IPA, I am not entirely sure if this is classified right. Some pineapple notes come through with the warming. Not getting a stitch of the 6% alcohol, which is quite low, but there is a whole lot of flavor. Feel is between light and medium with a nice felt carb going for it. Not my favorite beer, or IPA, or Belgian IPA, whatever it is, but it works for me for a go. I could drink alot of this, but I would probably get bored by the 3rd glass"

"Edit from 11/2/12. Tried the regular draft version at max's on Saturday. While still enjoyable, I thought the draft version really paled in comparison to the cask version sampled previously. Probably would rate the regular draft version a straight 4... still good, but no where near as excellent as the cask version."
