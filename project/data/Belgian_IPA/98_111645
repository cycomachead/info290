That said, when a beer incorporates spices and coriander, I would imagine that it will hold up nicely. I got a massive finger of dense, bone-white head from my pour that slowly fell, leaving great lacing in its wake. Nose was grassy, lemon-citrusy and with a tinge of pepper. Nothing wrong there and my mouth was beginning to water as a result. Nose was a slightly-hazy sunshine yellow (SRM = > 2, < 4). It looked like sunshine in a glass, which would have been more appropriate on a cold, overcast day, but I pressed on. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, almost creamy and the peppery flavor of the coriander was immediate on the tongue. It slowly gave 'way to a lemony taste that reminded me, in total, of a lemon muffin. Finish was semi-dry and very refreshing, actually. This could be a summer beer, for that mattter.","woodychandler","Jun 20, 2014"

The aroma is big on hoppy and wheat citrus, kind of smells like cleaning product with the yeast and wheat notes meshing with a firm hoppyness. The flavor is quite good, with more citrus notes, lemongrass, and pine. Moderate bitterness but sticks to the roof of your mouth as the citrus hits the taste buds. The body is light with a prickly medium to high carbonation. Overall this is a pretty drinkable hoppy ipa, like an American hop spiked Hoegaarden.","Stinkypuss","Beers"

Hints of tangerine, oranges on the palate bitter spicy yeast components citric hop bitterness and flavor combine with some coriander spice and wit characteristics along with elements of a decent IPA. Mouthfeel finishes dry and bitter between hops and the spice mix, medium bodied sturdy carbonation it really works for me.

3.53,-3.6,3,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Hazy gold with some sediment floating around in the beer. Thin white cap of fine bubbles, some lacing, decent head retention. Citrusy aroma, zest and grapefruit, fruity rather than pithy, hint of resin. The flavour was a bit sweet up front, a little malty, not much to get excited about. I enjoyed the finish much better. Lingering hop bitterness and citrus fruitiness showed up once the malt faded. Spiciness hung around for a while too. Hint of sourness and slickness. Moderate to high carbonation with medium/low body, Interesting, and pretty good.","DrJay","Mar 08, 2014"
4.25,16.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"poured from a refrigerated bottle and poured into a over sized wine glass. pours a beutiful golden color. looks alot like a pilsner lager.smell is fruity pineapple and mango sweetness from the hops.a faint belgian yeast note and a biscuity malt background. with faint pineyness. the taste is citrusy bitter hops up front. almost a dank pine resin hint. cracker breadyness on the back of the pallate. the coriander is barley present in the taste. the mouthfeel is crisp and the carbonation cleans the pallate well. pretty dry. overall this is a great white i.p.a. not the best but an above average offering in my opinion....cheers!","osant37","Mar 08, 2014"

This, my second beer from Harpoon, has made me a big fan of what they do. This beer pours excellent without too much spiciness, something a lot of WIPA's over do. All in all a very good beer.","Johnny_Muir","Mar 02, 2014"
