"O: This was pretty tasty, though not truly outstanding. This is a style that I think has a definitive ceiling, at least to my palate. The characteristics of a Belgian IPA don't always play well together, but this seemed to be as good as any of them. Recommended to try."

"This is an awesome beer that I'm glad I have one more of. Great job PipeWorks"

"Mouthfeel is great, medium bodied with lots of carbonation and a lot of bitterness."
"O: This is an awesome beer that I have overlooked for too long, another great offering from PW"
""
"This is probably one of the best Belgian IPAs around. Hunt it down."

"This is a solid DIPA that isn't gonna blow anyone away with its hop presence or bitterness, but instead really accomplishes a nice balanced Belgian IPA. Well done, I was surprised with how much I liked this beer."

"Pipeworks Glaucus ---4.5/5"
"Overall (4/5): I can easily see why there's such a fuss about Pipeworks among craft beer enthusiasts in Chicago. This is an outstanding beer that successfully pulls off complexity without becoming incoherent. Thirst-quenching and interesting, this beer would be great for any time and place."

"O - a good American-Belgian IPA made with American hops that lacks coherence."

"Very enjoyable Belgian IPA and something different, hunted from 20 West Wine and Spirits. Pours generous head on light yellow body. Floral hoppy aroma. I liked this because of the spices rather than yeast being emphasized in this style.Smooth mouthfeel, very good drinkability."
""

"Overall (4.00) - By far the thing they need to work on here is the taste. There is just too much fruit/lemon presence for me. It fits into the style very well though and is actually very satisfying. Though it is heavier than other belgians I've had, I attribute that character to a better body profile. Needs a slight bit of work, then this will be an excellent beer."
"O- Fantastic, well balanced Belgian style IPA. Not overly hoppy or yeast heavy. Another great offering from Pipeworks it seems they really impart nice dank hop flavors in their ales. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their beers. Cheers."
"Tasty beverage. Big Belgian character with plenty of tropical American hops."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with soapy and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."

"Overall: This was a wonderful change of pace and an overall great beer. I would like to sip this on a warm summer day paired with some food on the grill."
""
"M: Light medium body. Carbonation helps make feel lighter."

"Another amazing beer by Pipeworks. If these guys continue to put out quality beer like this local Chicago brewers will need to watch out!"
""
""
"I love bitter beers, but this IPA seems to lack a little more balance and depth for the style, not bad, but not something I plan on picking up again."

"Browned orange, offwhite head. Mild retention and good lacing. Nose of citrus rind, big Belgian yeast character, some tropical notes, peach, nectarine, cantaloupe and some herbal and spicy notes. Taste has tropical fruits, melons, herbal hop character, medium spice character, and Belgian yeast finishes it off. Bitter well into the finish. Medium body, no alcohol, medium carbonation. A very nice American take on the style."
"A good representation of the style in my opinion."

"I've never been a huge fan of this style, but this just showed me there's hope for the style. A solid blend of Belgian yeast and American hops. Drink it. You won't regret it."
""
"Overall: Another singular creation by the brewers at Pipeworks; every one of their beers I have tasted tastes like nothing else"
""
"This was another great brew from pipeworks. I hope they keep this in the regular rotation."

"O: an addition to a spicier IPA. Worth the pour and worthwhile of drinking a bottle. 8.0 abv is good too, lends to a stronger palate and discussion among friends."
"O - I don't have a ton of other Belgian style IPAs to compare this to, but this is definitely my favorite. A+"

""

"D - A very nice take on a style I don't generally enjoy. Well done guys! Would happily drink this again and hope that Pipeworks makes another batch in the near future."
"O: I like this take on a cross between a Belgian and an American IPA. Obviously the two styles are similar, but this beer does manage to be both unified between the two styles yet still have distinctly different characteristics."
"O: Pretty nice."
"Yeah, I missed out on my precious sushi, but at least I can commiserate with friends and beers, right? This one pours a clear straw topped by over a finger of white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, mandarin orange, light lemon zest, sweet caramel, and a touch of pineapple. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light leek and a very small contingent of what seems like salt. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, an enjoyable beer, but I don't really get too much Belgian-ness going on. Regardless, I'd readily have another..."

"O: very nice balance, full flavored, delicious"

"O: A very balanced and delicious take on the style. I would like a little more hops, but it was nice none the less. A great refreshing beer! Chalk up another great beer for the boys at Pipeworks."

"O- A nice beer, one of the better Belgian-style IPA's I've had."
""
""
"O- good beer. I have probably drank 100 x more American ipa's than Belgians so it's not a go to style for me. Also, some others I have had more recently have more Weiss notes, where this is more spice and bitterness."
"A light sweetness at first with lots of citric fruit, pink grapefruit and orange, something almost tropical about it. Nice complimentary yeast that lends some esters and spice to the mix. Moderately bitter aftertaste, balancing the light sweetness upfront. A hint of malt in the middle, but this is a showcase of how well the hops and yeast dance together. Lighter feel, creamy, drying in the finish with a pleasant aftertaste of fruit and light pepper. Good stuff, will definitely look for more of before it's gone."
