"Light straw color. Mild hop smell. Mild flavor. Slightly fruity. This beer is just ok."
""
""
"Overall, a nice Belgian IPA.  Heavy on the fruity hops with Belgian funk to complement."

"O: OK"

"Eh. Kind of a mediocre belgian ale with a mildly spiced tone to it. Kind of thick in a clogged kind of way. Almost chalky thing going on too. Kind of just there. Not really a Belgian IPA so much; or at least, not one I am impressed by. Like I said: eh."

"Overall a very tasty and user friendly IPA."

"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would drink it again. It's not one of my standard ones but still pretty good."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a TON of white, fluffy, foamy head. This one had head coming out of the bottle as soon as I popped the top. Aromas of bread, honey, yeast cake, esters, and some berry highlights. Smells are light, but tasty. Flavors are light and crisp, with a buttery, cracker, and floral blend on the forward tongue, with some more honey rich notes in the backbone. Smooth, light bodied, with a softness throughout. The aftertaste is more of the Belgian yeast strand, with fruity notes and funk. The finish is smooth and clean, with a subtle spice linger."

"I would gladly drink this beer again to see what I might have missed on this first taste, but doubt I will be seeing it around home."
""
""
""
"O - its not a bad brew but not a great example of the style, neither belgian yeasty or the hoppy aspects take center stage, the result is a little strange but still relatively tasty and drinkable"
""
"Drinkability is OK, it's pretty digestible, and the taste isn't overbearing, but I'm not loving it and wouldn't re-buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this to be an easy-to-drink Belgian IPA because it wasn't too bitter or dominated by yeasty flavors."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a brew that is tasty and refreshing, one i would definitely do again!"
"Initial taste is creamcycle orange. The hop taste remains there but it is an aged taste. Light orange body and a great long lasting head. I just received this bottle from Lueken's Liquors. There may have been some time since brewed, which should not be critical for a Belgian IPA. Good drinkability though not the best I have had in the style .Above average mouthfeel."
"Too much carbonation."
"Pours a golden hue with a creamy three finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is mandarins,bready Belgian yeast,pepperoni,piney hops and spices,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with above moderate carbonation and has tastes of spicy zesty citrus infused hops,bready Belgian yeast,mandarins,lemons,peaches and finished with a piney hop spicy bitter finish and overall it's a nice mix of Belgian and American IPA and would drink again cheers."

"O-The hops and yeast strike an interesting balance here and this is a unique beer within my realm of experience. The hop character seems to become more perceptible as I drink the glass down. I enjoyed this beer, but I don't have any comparables when it comes to aggressively hopped belgian style beers."
""
""
"All the hallmarks of the style are here, to be sure - Belgian-style pale ale, on the high end of the alcohol range, and perky, bitter west-coast Yankee hops. Decent, but without flair, my skirt remaining barely ruffled. Sometimes the whole is not better than the sum of the parts, I would say if I was being unduly pissy. Which I am. Sorry."
""
"I've had some good luck with this brewery and I'll keep paying 10$ to try a bomber but I slightly overpaid for this one"
"An OK beer but there are better Belgian IPAs out there."
""

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, spices, and Belgian yeast. Taste is much the same with earthy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells."
""
""
"O - overall, I enjoyed this IPA. given the competition for IPAs today, I would be hardpressed to say i would order another but it was good to try, and if the mood strikes me, I would have another."
""

"Pours a clear golden orange with a spotty, billowy white head. Aroma starts with a lemony tang accompanies with soft spices such as clove and pepper. Very pungent. Flavor is strong with clove, allspice, and pepper. Amazing that it was masked so much in the aroma. Grapefruit and other citrus come through in taste as well. Bitterness is grassy and barkish and strong, lingering a moderate amount. The huge flavors swing back and forth almost balancing each other out. Feel is also balanced with a dry finish. Very interesting and one of the better Belgian IPAs I've had."
"Always been a fan of the Belgian IPA substyle - Coronado's version is a nice textbook version - citrus hops, honey, yeast, flowers, a little alcohol bite. Paired nicely with a catfish poboy covered in hot sauce. A nice beer - lots of hops, yeast, clove and spice."
"Complex Belgian IPA, pretty well put together with the yeast providing tropical varied fruit and the bitter hop kick, alcohol well hidden but it could be smoother. I wouldn't turn this down."
"Overall: This beer has some excellent qualities with some minor drawbacks but overall, I must say that I did thoroughly enjoy this beer."
""

"A pretty good Belgian IPA, but a little bit all over the board. Not as smooth as Iâ€™d hoped."
""
"This current version is listed as 7.5% ABV and 74 IBUs, with the hops being Warrior, Centennial, and Chinook. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Olive Tree in Ocean Beach."
""
"o - not bad for an ipa, a little too bitter for my tastes to just drink alone. Probably great if paired with the right cheese."
""
"Taste good and has a dry hoppy finish but not overly bitter. At 9% one could get quite tipsy on this beer because it drinks quite well."
""
""
""
""
"I had this beer at the SLO Xtreme beerfest. It pours a very cloudy golden color with an antique white head. It demonstrates good head retention. Citrus and pine nose. Clean, crisp pine presence up front that quickly yields to raw oat flavor. Interesting, but not my favorite."
""
""
"I'm in love with this beer. It's heady, which is to say that it's a little hot. But, a great aggressive hoppiness and interesting spice character with makes for a delicious spin in a Belgian IPA."
""
"Two thumbs way up."
"Overall: As the name would suggest, this a hop assault on the tongue and mouth. It's pretty much a one-note beer for me. Would have liked to see some other flavors complimenting the hops. Not sure where the Belgian part comes into play with this one."
""
"O: Interesting flavors, but maybe a little overboard on the bitterness."
""
"Final thought - for $8 a pop and 9% this is nice but not an every day ipa like idiot. That is the best beer they make by far. Still very nice"
"O: Wow his beer is really amazing. I wouldn't have minded a tad bit more body as well as a little bit more bitterness but the bitterness is not something i would knock it for. Damn good tasting IPA especially for the price."
"O - a veyr solid IPA"
"O - This was a big beer and I'm glad I waited around for a 12 oz. bottle of this to show up...definitely a sipper...not much Belgian qualities, more of a sweet, American version"
""

"This brew poured out as a nice looking golden copper color, with a very little amount of head on top. The lacing is very minimal... next to nothing really. The smell of this beer is a super hoppy and sweet. I'm enjoying the aroma of this quite a bit actually. The taste of the beer doesn't scream Belgian to me really, it's got a lot of american style hops in it that kind of kill off any of the Belgian flavors that it might have in there somewhere. Still I find it to taste very good. The mouthfeel of this brew is oily and lightly carbonated, very smooth and for me very drinkable. Overall I enjoyed this beer, I'd probably drink it again no questions asked."
"Not that big on Belgian IPAs, but this comes across as a well done Belgian/US hybrid. I wouldn't have a lot of these, but one is certainly worth it."
"Pours a deep golden in color, solid off white head and lacing. Aroma is of spicy, pungent, grapefruit hops. In the flavor, mainly grapefruit hops with some pith, zest and rind action with a substantial bitterness. For a ""Belgian Style"" IPA this misses the mark and is clearly in the American IPA style, with the belgo yeast only making itself known in its spiciness. Mouthfeel is good with a crisp carbonation and hop bite. Overall, a nice IPA style beer, but not enough Belgian influence to be true to style."
"Despite using Belgian yeast, beyond some aspects of the flavor, this is a domestic style through and through. Still, Coronado knows what to do with hops - so this is worth seeking out."
"O - I could tell from the first smell that this bottle was probably toast, there's no way Coronado would brew a Belgian style IPA with this kind of tang because they're a talented bunch of folks which tells me it's the bottle. I'll definitely give this one another go around and adjust my review as such. I really like the beers from Coronado. However, if I weren't expecting more Belgian flare in the aroma and taste, and this were classified more as a big IPA, I might enjoy it more. The pungent acidity reminds me more of what I experienced with a Mikkeller ""I Beat yoU", and that was done in a good way. This is too, but I don't think it's what the brewer was shooting for, if so, call it something else to eliminate the Belgian expectation because it's just not there. Like I said, I'll DEFINITELY give this one another try. The bottle is on the downside, and I still give solid a ""B", only because I do like pungency and spice in my hops, just doesn't work with this style. Can't wait to try a fresh one!"
"Mad Mex featuring Hoppy Daze IPA on tap right now intense array of citrus hops brings out Beligan spices as well. The moderate carbonation and the smooth drinking body goes hand and hand, one of those beers that drain themselves than you find at that Mad Mex is charging nine bucks a glass for this masterpiece. An excellent product but so limited that Mad Mex is selling it for a set price of nine dollars a pour but it only charges 4.50 during happy hora M-F that's why they can get away with the inflated pricing. Even the Brown ale from Coronado was nine bucks fuck Wilson Mcginnley and Fuck Mad Mex for 9 dollar pints. This beer was excellent too bad I couldn't drink another serving without spending 18 dollars did I mention they want to serve this in 12 ounce pours. Citrus, floral, and earthy hops stand tall against the barrage of West Coast hops but the alcohol is well hidden and the malts are plentiful enough to create some balance. Drinkability overall is quality but the price leaves this one on the experimental backburner."
"A bad bottle, maybe?"
"Overall â€“ A good beer to have with a Ruben, but not one Iâ€™d have again to be honest."
"D Again the alcohol doesn't show up and it has a kind of slick mouthfeel. Probably the highlight of the beer."
"O: Belgian IPAs often fall a bit short for me, but this was quite good. Very nice flavors to this beer."
"D: This is a well made, drinkable beer."
"M/D: Medium-bodied, almost milky viscosity with a mellow carbonation that lends to the body nicely. Extremely drinkable and quite enjoyable in large quantities."
"O - Interesting beer but somewhat unbalanced. Tastes more like a muddied IPA than a true Belgian IPA with the yeast character very much subdued."
"D- I enjoyed this to an extent but I was blown away last year. It's good now but I won't be going for a 2nd glass, where as last tear I had three."
"D- nice belgian ipa for sure. Not sure how fresh it is so I won't pass to much judgment on the hops but I think this brew super fresh might be awesome, or if this is super fresh its a good beer."
"Pours hazy golden with a large white head. The initial aroma is very hoppy, with both grassy and citrusy orange hops. The flavor is Belgian yeast and grassy as well as some fruit flavors, with citrus as well as a little banana. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $6. Poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed bright yellow color with about two fingers of fluffy off white foam. Nose and flavors are of orange creamsicles, menthol, apricot, grapefruit, peach, mango, sweet malt, pine, spicy yeast. Better than medium bodied and dry with ample carbonation. Pretty tasty overall."
"This is a great beer. Very good aroma, flavor, feel and finish. Wish I had more of these!"
"Just an all around terrific beer from the folks at Coronado. Impressive."
"D: I could drink this all day. I did dock a 1/2 point for not quite fulfilling my hop craving. But that is quickly overlooked by my excitement for this style of beer. I love Belgian IPAs!!!"
"The Belgian character is subdued by the high hopping rate, and the hops seem to lean in the pelletized direction. A mild wet paper note is found thoughout as well. Probably not the freshest example of this beer."
"Drinkability: Despite the ABV, which is well concealed, I could dink a few more of this one. I kept wanting another sip and found this a delicious and dangerously drinkable beer. I'll definitely be looking to have this beer again. This is one of the more enjoyable beers I've had in a while."
"Talk about day and night, I so enjoyed this from a bottle, but from tap the sweetness comes pounding through....too much so. The hops and yeast are nice, but the sweetness needs to be dialed down a bit. I left disappointed. Shame too."
"Split a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Poured into a tulip, the beer was a hazy yellow with a sticky white head. The aroma was a big nose full of of sweet piney resin with a mild earthy note. I'm really impressed by how clear and rich the smell is, damn. The flavor diverges surprisingly, with a much grassier, citrus rind flavor - likely the Belgian element kicking in. Like most really good beers, it could still be more complex, but this is a beer worth seeking out. Thanks to Plunkett for introducing me to this fine beer."
"HV"
"This is just a down right enjoyable brew; it has such a ripe hoppiness to it that I can't really even find fault that the hops drown out the Belgian yeast character to a large degree. Letting the beer warm up certainly helps (the phenols in the finish become more noticeable and a herbal, slightly vegetal and grassy character is accentuated as well), but ultimately this is all about the hops (as it should be). This is dangerously drinkable for a beer of this of this strength, which is definitely requisite in my book for anything with IPA on the label. This definitely hits the spot for this oft-times hop head, and even has a bit of yeast character to keep the funky freak in me at least slightly interested."
"I'd like to get a bottle of this to compare to my earlier rating from the Brew Pub."
"Sample at Stone. This brew is a clear copper color with a medium and fluffy white head that dissipates slowly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrus, hops and grass. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with grassy hops, citrus and light malt flavors. Slight spice and yeast are present as well. The finish is hoppy and leaves a mild spice and hops aftertaste. Pretty good overall."
"This is a decent and very drinkable Belgian IPA, though I really think it would be better fresh as the hops have faded a bit. As it is, this is a light and fruity sweet take on a Belgian IPA."
"Bottle, 4/08. Pours clear gold with a huge white head. Strong yeasty aroma with a lot of banana and clove. It nearly drowns out the floral hops. Taste is the same. Bubblegum and clove abound, then the grassy, pine hops come in at the end. The closest thing to this is the Urthel Triple Hop IPA. This one is sweeter, but I don't know which is better."
"Drinkability - a fine Belgian IPA, a great change of pace for an IPA beer tasting."
"My only previous experience with Coronado Brewing Company (Idiot IPA) was a positive experience. Nevertheless, I didn't expect Hoppy Daze to blow me out of the water like it has. This unique, delightful elixir deserves a lot more love than it gets. Bottom line: the flavor of American hops married to the complexity of Belgian yeast. Thumbs way up!"
"D - Fun to try."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent Belgian IPA. Really well done and a differenced take on one of my favorite styles. I am glad I got a few of these as I believe they will hold up very well over time and really make a fine addition to my regular lineup. Definitely a top notch beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability is average, the sweet malts overwhelm the restricted hop profile, the Belgian aspect is different and exciting although the IPA-ness is sort of drowned out here. . ."
"Odd actually. A little off balance. Hoppy and bitter on the finish with a biscuit bready middle leaning into caramel on the finish. Hints of citrus and peach with even more in the way of pine and bits of earth. Middle seems to be somewhat lost for just a second and than it all comes back full throttle on the finish. Ahh well after reading the bottle I see that this brew is femented with a belgian yeast strain. That would explain the lack of a middle. A good DIPA but just can't get past the middle."
"Very nice approach to a Belgian IPA style. Not terribly balanced between the 2 styles, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"I could barely read the label but I think it said it was nine percent alcohol, thought this was more like a DIPA anyways, definitely a Belgian-style India pale ale regardless, also tasted this on tap at Hamilton's about a month ago, might drink again, worth trying at least once"
"D- I really like what CBC has been doing recently. This is definetly unique and fun. With that being said, this one has me intrigued and confused at the same time. Nonetheless, an easy beer to drink."
"Overall, quite tasty and quaffable. Like I said, not the hops bomb West Coast IPA but still one that has a good convergence of characters. Worth trying out."
"On tap at the CBC. Pours a red, slightly hazy color with a nice thick head. The head leaves a huge lacing as it drains. Aroma is completely hops - with lots of sticky pine smells. Huge amounts of bitterness, and a very hoppy finish. This one could have used more of a malt base to back up the hops - I love big hoppy beers, but this suffered on drinkability without the malt base."
"Hazy amber colour with a thin lace of white head. Good retention for the meager amount of foam off the pour. Light malty flavour sits underneath a combination of citrus and resinous hops. Highly resinous bitterness with a citrusy hop flavour. Light sweetness most of the way through, finishing on the dry, resinous side. Medium body and carbonation. Dry, resinous texture. Overall, the hops really overpower the malt base, but it's still a nice beer."
"Reminds me of the Hopmaniac IPA at OnTap in La Jolla. Certainly not as bitter or powerful or in-your-fave as Stone ales. I swear that it was listed as a Double IPA on the board above the bar. It fits the regular IPA category pretty well. Very well done IPA."
"A lighter amber-colored offering than the Four Brothers Pale Ale, this brew provided much more of a hop experience. The body, as noted, was light amber and clear with a decent white head and good lacing. Very malty and hoppy nose with more presence than the pale ale. Decent flavor with nicely subdued hop presence yet clearly a well-hopped offering, but refined and restrained. Good feel and finish. Easily a session beer."
