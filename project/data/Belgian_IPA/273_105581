Taste is also strong of citrus, a bit of wheat is present, a touch of spice. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer.","tone77","Jan 10, 2015"

3.85,1.6,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"This is one Heck of a hybrid ale. Wit grain bill, strong ale yeast, American IPA hopping. Sizeable head, good lace, wispy covering. Cloudy orange gold. Nose is lively with wheat twang, light pils breadiness, tropical fruit hops. Taste is an amalgam and it works out beautifully. Light malty body that seems to be overwhelmed by the huge hop content but the yeast and mellower hop artifacts bring a balance to the finish that makes this highly quaffable and refreshing.  Feel is smooth with a mild carbonation that brings a gentle dubbing of the mouth. I like this stuff. It's hard to define out pigeonhole bit it's good.","scootny","Dec 16, 2014"

Flavor is monumentally hoppy and has a bold sour citrus tone, as much grapefruit as Mandarin orange. Texture is quite fizzy so you feel it inside you as it heads downstairs. This is one whiplash you will be glad you got!","Cyberkedi","Dec 12, 2013"

Has a great balance and all in all is very drinkable. This is pretty new beer and I would definitely suggest you go and pick some up to try for yourself.","theranchstar","Nov 30, 2013"

4.15,9.5,4.25,4.25,4,3.75,4.5,"Pale golden amber appearance, with haze in the body, made it clear, that this was a beer drawing on both IPA and wheat beer traditions. The smell was sweet, delicate, floral, and lightly citric. The taste struck a good balance between a Witbier and an IPA, as I could first detect bubblegum, banana, and a peppery yeast, and then got a dose of grapefruit, and some pine. This was not quite a thorough melding of the two style, but more of a layering effect, with two distinct waves of flavors. The mouthfeel was creamy and soft, being close to basically a Witbier, while the finish was drawn out hops similar to, but not quite as intense as an IPA. Nicely done blend of styles.","rajendra82","Nov 24, 2013"
4.26,12.4,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"O - Sweetwater nails this belgian IPA. Glad to have a new seasonal. A very close cousin to their IPA but with a belgian yeast strain. Great brew!","BeerDawgs","Nov 18, 2013"
