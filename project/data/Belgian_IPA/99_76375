4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Saranac White IPA brewed by Matt Brewing Company with an ABV of 6.0% This brew pours out a cloudy amber color with a small white head. This is an unfiltered brew you can not see thought it. The small is rich with wheat, sweetness, hops and other gains. There is nothing overpowering in smell of this brew. The taste is bitter but smooth. The bitterness is not overpowering in this brew, it is a nice touch. You pick up on some citrus brew but not much. The mouthfeel is an clean. Saranac White IPA has a nice balance to it. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jul 27, 2014"

Very enjoyable beer from Saranac, who kind of drifted away from me in the craft beer market over the years. This beer will make me want to come back again, as this is one of their better beers I've had in many years. Like I said, a very cloudy beer, which at first I attributed to the initial pour from the keg. The second and third pour gave me the same cloudy results. Not in a bad way, but a little unexpected since this beer is a mixture of two equally distinct styles. If you like the Belgian Witbier & IPA style, this beer is definitely worthy of a try.","cmq103","Jul 26, 2014"

Appearance: fuzzy peach body allows a splotchy off-white head-unfiltered... Aroma: crisp, peachy citrus--coriander, grapefruit prevail--a nice overall sentiment.. Palate: light and refreshing with a tingle of substance--so light for an IPA--and little aftertaste... Taste: a mixture of flowers--soft hops really allow for a smooth, pilsner-like crispness... Overall: this beer presents an odd problem--it tastes so little like any other Saranac I've had, and that is saying something. The difference is not only noticeable but welcome!

Crisp notes of spice and citrus. Mid-taste breaks into hard notes of pine and bitters. Fades into final roll of creamy malt undertones highlighted by lemons and oranges. Sour and spice lingers. Creamsicle after taste. Wafting more piney hops and minor alcohol tinge. Smooth mouth feel. Fairly drinkable. Flower notes may be an issue with aggressive session. Sipped slowly and respectfully, this is not an issue. Meant for a ""slow drive through the country on a hot day"" not for a drag race. Very good. If you're a hops head you'll like this fusion of Heffenweizen, Blonde Ale, and IPA. Each quality is there and well balanced. Good experiment. 3.56 out of 5.","digitalflood","Jun 17, 2013"

The coriander was big, followed closely behind by the minty hops. The Utica boys are becoming mighty innovative in their third century of brewing. Mouthfeel was medium and exactly unlike the nose, I caught the hops initially, followed by the orange peel, then the coriander on the tongue. Very nice and quite refreshing on a hot day.

It is a good beer but the hoppiness is not quite balanced. As it sits for a little while the hoppiness mellows out and more of the citrus/orange flavors become prevalent making it taste more like a wheat beer.

And I think to a certain extent it's because of the way they did it. A lot of the beers I've seen like this have started by bumping the white ale up into a beefier IPA style - but you get a lot of wheat malt that way (more body/more filling/more malt flavor). Saranac started the other way around, adding the coriander and orange peel to an already decent IPA. In fact, the Citra hops are so bright in the nose I'd be more than happy to drink it straight. Fortunately, they've kept the hops a bit more restrained in the flavor, and the the orange peel and coriander are noticeable as well. They appear after the hops, there's no doubt about that, but then they lend it another interesting component that helps to keep it pretty drinkable. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Apr 09, 2012"

4.04,8.9,3,4,4,4,4.5,"Saranac White IPA is a very cloudy, dull golden ale with a frothy, bubbly white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a very citrusy aroma, like grapefruit and orange peel. It has a very smooth medium light body; fluffy in the mouth with a dry finish. It tastes citrusy throughout. There's lots of wheat in the middle of the taste and then resiny hop flavor takes over. Orange peel seems to be ever present and brings everything together. It finishes like an IPA but the aftertaste has a little wheat and something doughy in it. This is a very clever beer. An IPA and a Wit work together very well.","yesyouam","Mar 27, 2012"

Thin, textured rings of lacing are revealed as the head recedes. Nose expresses citrus rind, grapefruit, phenols and belgian yeast. Taste follows nose; however, flavor profile is a bit duller than suggested by the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a light acidity. Overall, a decent, albeit lackluster Belgian IPA. Definitely one of the better brews I've had from Saranac.","Jwale73","Mar 26, 2012"

The flavor comes on with sharp citrus hop and a woodsy wheat. It’s got oak and orange, grassy bite. This is a bit too stark to me but I do enjoy the rye bread qualities that result here. Not that it’s too bitter but just a bit caustic. This is a fizzy brew with an aggressively effervescent feel with a touch of dryness in the finish and a medium-light body.

3.88,4.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A new concept from of all brewers...Saranac,kinda cool.Poured a hazed peach infused lemonade color with a thinner but well sustained white head atop.Alot of coriander in the nose along with toasted wheat malt,a smattering citric hops comes thru as the beer sits more.A little more hop forward on the palate with citrus and tropical fruit-like flavors,a firm toasted wheat base with a little more subdued coriander in the finish.Not bad it's something I would drink alot of in the summer.","oberon","Jan 25, 2012"

It's a solid attempt at something new and they succeeded. Whether or not this will catch on like the black IPA craze is yet to be seen, but definitely worth checking this one out.","BeerPhan86","Jan 21, 2012"
3.76,1.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Crazy new style, Saranac seems to have jumped on this one before the scores of brewers fired up the bandwagon. Its basically a hoppy witbier or a spiced IPA ... you figure it out.

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"So I'm not a huge Saranac fan. Their beers are hit or miss for me but I must say they really hit the mark on this one. I had this beer from a growler and I have to say the unfiltered hue Was impressive. Looks a lot like apple cider. It has that clean crisp wheat taste with citrus notes and a great hop finish. Saranac has finally impressed me. Cheers!","NASSPETE","Jan 21, 2012"

3.86,4,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall this was a nice spin on an IPA, but a little off base to be a true IPA and more like a Belgian style pale ale. Nice new beer by Saranac that's worth a try. Glad BA listed this under American Pale Wheat Ale, since to me that style or a Witbier is more in line with the flavor and less like the “IPA” title, so I'll rate this on the BA style and not the label title. I look forward to trying this again.","CHickman","Jan 16, 2012"

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This is my first encounter with a ""White IPA"". I am a big Wit and IPA fan, so I was interested in this to say the least. Believe it or not, it was hard to find, and WalMart of all places had 6-packs, $7.99. Poured into a DFH pint glass, nice 3 finger head with good retention and excellent spider web-like lacing. The color resembled a textbook unfiltered wheat ale style with the golden hazy yellow hue. The aroma was just what I had anticipated, a mix of citra hops, corriander, and wheat. The taste is a direct mirror of the smell. The first few sips were almost strange with the two distinct styles clashing. As the pint became less full, the flavor was growing on me. Each one was better than the last. I enjoyed 4 bottles. The first sample pack of Sarnac was dissapointing, but each brew I have sampled since has increased my fondness for this brewery. Prost!","ElCaholicRacer","Jan 16, 2012"

3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"6.49 a six need I say more than that in the review, well I guess I can describe my experience. Jumping on the White IPA bandwagon even Saranac is throwing down with their own version, holy shit A-B is really missing the bus. Nevermind the next shock top beer due out is supposed to be a White IPA. This one pours like a clouded banana smoothie orange cloudy glowing slurry of yeast suspensions and spice and protein. Lacing is a brilliant egg shell white with a nice thicke tof billowing head. Aroma again very perky with the citrus hoppy green notes, this one even seems a bit like perfume. Harsh bitterness between spices and hop pellets this is over the top with the citrus bang and green hop pellet finish making you wish you could brush your teeth and clean that flavor off the palate. Crazy thing about it despite harsh qualities I still take big sips and continue to drink, almost like a zombie in cruise control eating brains. I just can't help myself, and believe it or not your palate gets adjusted with each sip, I can see the white ale spice a touch of clove coriander with big green hops bringing the citrus clove bitterness this one seems to wear it's orange peel on it sleeves (and the label). Mouthfeel despite the harsh feel and medicinal spices left on the palate there's still a good amount of hops in this NY state Matt Brewing offering, the most bearable hoppy beer I've had from them yet.","WVbeergeek","Jan 14, 2012"

Still one of the better Saranc beers I've had recently. would be a decent beer to get people more used to hop flavors, as its not quite as hoppy as an IPA, has little bitterness and has some approachable flavors on the forefront.","silentjay","Jan 14, 2012"

4.01,8.1,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"!2oz bottle. Pours a cloudy dark straw color with a half inch of head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is of citrus hops, grains and orange peel. Smells pretty hoppy, especially for Saranac. Taste is of citrus hops and wheat up front. Orange peel near the end. Nice hop bitterness. A bit of a floral finish to go with the orange peel. This is a solid beer from Saranac and is right up there with Wet Hop IPA as being one of their hoppiest offerings. Overall, this is an interesting style that is well crafted. I will be buying it again given the chance.","PicoPapa","Jan 14, 2012"
4.15,11.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, bottled on December 7th, 2011 (julian date stamped on label). Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a cloudy gold color with about an inch frothy white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is mostly hoppy, it smells mainly like citrusy hops (grapefruit, lemon and orange peel), along with some coriander and bready/wheat malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but the hoppy and malty flavors are pretty even and none of them are much stronger than the others. It's a nice mix between a witbier and an IPA. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and a bit creamy with good carbonation. At just $7.99 a 6-pack, I'd buy this again for sure. It's a great deal for the price, I can't think of many beers this good for that low of a price.","bluejacket74","Jan 12, 2012"

I've been drinking Saranac for close to 20 years now, I'd suspect, and this one might be my highest-rated beer from a brewery that generally comes across as average, nothing more (though I have a soft spot in my heart for their Pale Ale). Not sure why they chose winter to release this, though, as I think this would make an excellent summer beer.","Kendo","Jan 06, 2012"

What’s more, Citra hops supposedly have a short life in terms of bitterness but personally I think their byproduct flavors are enjoyable in their own right, so this beer will satisfy those looking for hops, but also those who aren’t—drink it fresh for hops, or a few months old for a nice wit.
