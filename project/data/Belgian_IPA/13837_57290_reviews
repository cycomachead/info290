review_text
"Aroma is very interesting with spices, yeast, hops and a bit of resin. Outstanding appearance with a huge billowy, off-white, semi-permanent head, with lots of lace and a clear honey amber color. Flavor's similar to nose with resin coming out more and lingering somewhat unpleasantly in the finish. Body is on the soft side which enhances that resin finish. Otherwise it's a real good drinking beer."

"Lovely honey color, light white foam.  Smell heavy on bananas, a bit of bubble gum but not in cloying way -- it's what's most Belgian about this Belgian IPA. Slight carbonation on front of tongue.  Exceptionally smooth, very easy to drink beer while still having a personality.  Nothing challenging about this IPA but be careful because it does not taste like a 7.4 ABV.  I will go back to this beer and serve to none beer lovers because of it's balance, despite the fact I don't think it's especially interesting. Nice."

"Probably one of the most grassy, piney, and earthy beers I've had. Wish the esters and fruity hops were more prevalent, but a nice beer. In the end, the resiny, earthy hops are too much for my palate."

"Great beer, very fruity with a nice kick of bitter hops"

"Does not taste like Zombie Dust as I was told."
"Pours a dark yellow with a foamy one finger head.  Nice citrus hop smell.  There is a mixing of other fruit smells including orange.  The banana and clove breaks through the citrus hop taste.  The banana taste lingers nicely.  The mouthfeel is very smooth with the desired hop bite and clove/banana finish.  The hops burst back up the nose slightly.  Banana keeps coming back through.  This was very good, and would put this in the ball park of Gumballhead head."

"best beer from a brewery i have never heard of i can remember. what a cool brew, amber in color, light amber, pale copper, with a tall lasting off white head. it smells way more belgian than i usually like in belgian ipa, with a ton of fruity yeast and an almost white wine vibe. the citra hops are the kicker though, they are so well dosed and so fresh and vibrant that they bring the yeast and the malt together where it always seems disjointed in the style to me. the citra is juicy lemon curd and pineapple, which matches the esters in the belgian yeast as well as the higher sugars in the medium crystal malt. a great tripartite synergy here. hops do carry enough bitterness to balance out the sweet, but they are so oily and big that they keep the finish really long. its refreshing though with high flying carbonation. this was a huge surprise to me, one of those beers i had no real expectations for and it floored me. super well made, i am now eagerly seeking more beer from these guys. are they all this good?"

"Pretty fine brew. Just got done with a PsuedoSue, so get to compare Citra hop beers. This ones good. Much sweeter from the Trappist yeast. Don’t like it as much, but still a very good solid beer."
"Dat deer be pissed, yo!  Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear brass-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam.  The nose comprises leek, old grapefruit rind, clove, light nutmeg, banana peel, and leafy greens.  The taste brings in more of the same, the Belgian-style yeast and spices clashing with the overdone Citra hops, making for, appropriately enough, bedlam on my tongue.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, I just could not get into this beer at all.  The overwrought Citra hops would have been bad enough, but the clash with the Belgian characters just ran things right off the rails."
""
"O-One of the better Belgian IPAs out there, the citra hops definitely help out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's an understated sweetness that lends itself to multiple servings without a sugar overload. I generally like to switch my drinking up, but a long evening with a six-pack of Bedlam is perfectly fine in my book."

"O - This beer blew me away for the style. The only other Belgian IPA I've had that comes close is Lagunitas Little Sumpin Wild. If you live in Wisconsin, don't hesitate upon purchasing a sixer of this stuff. Easy drinking and flavorful: everything you would want in a Belgian IPA."

"No, wait, actually, I think I finally understand what the yeast tastes like from within the package of an IPA. Amazingly, now that I've got the yeast figured out, I'm digging this brew all the more. Or perhaps it's just more delicious as it warms?"
""
""
""
""

"Very reminiscent of Houblon Chouffe in that it seems to taste like a cross between an American IPA and a Belgian Tripel. This one lacks some of the hoppy components of the d'Achouffe beer (sadly), but is still a fine beer. Very well-constructed and enjoyable. Complex without demanding too much."

"Pours a cloudy, copper/orange color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, floral hops, slight yeast, spice, alcohol, and sweet malt. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, hops, floral, hint of grass, strong yeast, spice, and sweet malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, body, and blend."
"O -- Really solid. Drink it!"
"Mouthfeel is fairly viscous and chewy, able to stand up to the aroma and flavours in the beer. I'm very impressed with this beer, one of the better IPA styles I've enjoye in recent memory. Beautifully constructed, the ring and lace has lasted to the final sips!"
""
"Overall: i initially liked this one more and as you drink more it declines a bit, too much of a grassy taste. Ideally a belgian ipa that i like should be doable but it seems less so everytime i drink one. this one ends up in the upper end of mid row."

"Poured bottle into a glass - opening it up - a very crisp and refreshing. No bite to speak of and therefore not hoppy or malty at all. Very drinkable - great for summer / spring time. Has that refreshing effect served cold as my fridge would get it. Has a neutral finish - leaving your mouth light and refreshed not bitten like an IPA."

"very easy to drink. 'best enjoyed by' date is rubbed out (bought it online from a broker) so i'm not certain how old it is but it has a very interesting footprint. kind of creamy, kind of sugar-y sweet. very interesting. I want to say 'popsicle' but it really isn't there. but this is an awesome brew!"
""
"Overall a very good representation of the style. A very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - super refreshing with juicy, fruity hops melding with the yeast to create an explosion of taste, however I would like this to be a bit more bitter than it is, especially if it's an IPA of sorts."
""
"O-This beer surprised me and is much better than I thought it was going to be. I've had other beers from Ale Asylum, but this one easily beats them out. I'd buy a six of this anytime."

"Overall - I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I would definitely enjoy this one on a hot day."
""
""
"(Afterthought) Really a nice blend, and a nice intro to this style. The ABV is well hidden in this one. For my intro it was a bit stark at first not knowing what to expect, but it settled into a nice balance between the hop and yeast profiles that became a bit sultry towards the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't drink this style too often but id definitely say this is a fine example. Cant decide if you want a hoppy IPA or golden Belgian? Go for both with this!  Excited to try other offerings from Ale Asylum who just hit shelves in IL"
""
"Overall, I was quite surprised with this! Flew off the shelves during the first wave of it's release here in the Chicagoland area and rightfully so!"
"Overall: I like it. Again, if you like ipa's but are on the fence about that Belgium funk, this is your beer. One of the best and most unique smelling beers in recent memory, and I can't complain about the taste. Overall this brew delivers quite a unique, and agreeable flavor profile. Would definitely throw a couple of these in my create my own sixer again."

"An easy drinking ale for the hophead and the Belgian nut both. Bitterness lasts long on the palate, flavor consistently delivers. Yum. Tasty as heck. Belongs with the best of the Belgian IPAs."
""
""
""
"Thanks again, Duff27!"
""
""
""
"O. It's not a pretty beer, but the citra character is great."
"O- The full hops flavor has some nice depth with good Citra qualities and some good sweetness and bitterness balance."
""
""
""

""

"Pours a hazed peach color, sporting a soapy white froth that retains well and laces superbly. Aroma of citrus and pine. In the flavor, bubblegum, citrus, candi sugar, cotton candy. Mild bitterness working well with the sugars and cake like yeast. Herbal, minty notes emerging late. Medium bodied, well carbonated and crisp. Doughy yeast and juicy hop linger on the palate. Overall, a fine American take on the Belgian IPA style. Very nice."
""
"Overall: A really good take on a Belgian IPA. This really brings the IPA part with lots of juicy hops but there is enough Belgian yeast spice to keep things interesting."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice balanced IPA that really highlights citra. Belgian yeast lends a bit of complexity and uniqueness. Very easy drinking for such a hoppy IPA. Really well crafted and enjoyable."
"Of the taster I had at the Asylum....this was my favorite....there is something about the Citra Hop that KICKS ASS! This beer poured a nice coppery orangish clear with white head that left a nice lace. The scent was a perfect blend of pine and citrus. The taste was like the smell but had the Belgium sugar/malt twang. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was a great beer."

"Overall: Tasty, not overwhelming, but not underwhelming either. Shows off the Belgian yeast characteristics well, while complementing it with a good fruity hoppiness that doesn't overwhelm the spices. It definitely hit the spot on a hot summer evening on the patio."

"O - Aroma was it's highlight, had a good grasp on style. Hops seemed to be one dimensional leaning strongly towards pine in aroma but even more so taste. Great feel and appearance. I would recommend but not go out of the way to find."

"O- this Belgian IPA is superb buy this one or trade for it"
""
"Seriously, this defines a GREAT smelling brew!"
"O: Just read the quote from the bottle I posted at the top. A fun beer to drink with a very unique and delicious flavor. Ale Asylum sure has great IPA's."
"They just stated bottling this a little over a week ago so it is the essence of fresh! Bedlam baby, no better Belgian IPA out there!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Bedlam is a great example of what a Belgian ipa can and should be. I can't get enough of that big tropical/citrus flavor. The body is different and more interesting then a run of the mill ipa. Never hesitate to grab a 6 of this when I come across it."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is Ale Asylum’s best offering. It is truly a shame that this is not a year-round beer because, living in Madison, I would love to have this in my fridge at all times. The Trappist (or, more broadly, Belgian) IPA is not something I have had before, but I will certainly be seeking more out after this masterpiece of brewing craft. This is unquestionably deserving of a spot in my personal Top Five Beers, and is just a hair off perfection. As it is distributed only within a very small radius in Wisconsin, look for possible trades if you are interested. If ever there was a beer that needed exposure, it is this jaw-dropping Trappist IPA. 18.5/20"

"This took me entirely by surprise. I got a single. And will be seeking out more."
"This was definitely a pleasant surprise as it's one of the better Belgian IPAs I've tasted recently. The taste didn't quite deliver the promise of the aroma but that was a pretty serious promise."
"4.5 D: This is a damn fine beer. Incredibly drinkable. Hops do their job and do it well, but don't make the beer a cloying undrinkable hop bomb that some of the more citrus oriented IPAs do. This is a wonderful beer and a must try."
"Wow, Bedlam surpassed my expectations with ease. I have no idea how old it is (I've had it for a week and a half), but it's very tasty as is. Wish I had a few more."
""
""
""
"O: Quite nice, although I expected more Belgian funk in the taste."
""
""

"Notes: Excellent Belgian IPA. Citra hops work wonderfully with the Belgian yeast and malt. Loads of fruit and very juicy on the tongue. More please."
""
""
"Poured this one out with a big of aggression, the head wasn't too big on this beer... Perhaps some of the carbonation has started to fade with time. Would like to try a fresh bottle sometime. The color of the beer is a very nice looking clear golden copper. With a thin white head that doesn't last long at all. The smell of the beer is so nice, the aromas of fresh fruits like pears, peaches and some pineapple come together on the nose with the sweet Belgian yeast and the Citra hope as well. The taste of the beer was awesome too, a brilliant sweetness in the beginning that is quickly destroyed by the bitterness of the hops. The carbonation is very gentle in the beer, it remains smooth and very drinkable. Overall this beer kicked ass."
"Appearance is an orange tone w/ 1 finger of white head. This beer looks appealing, excited to try it. Its` nose has pine, Belgian yeast, orange and biscuits. Sipping on it, it has a taste of grapefruit, orange, hops, some light spice as well. Mouthfeel is low key, average carbonation, some bitterness in the finish. This is a great beer from this small brewery out of Madison, WI."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: excellent beer, will have to search more by these guys out."
""
"O: I don't quite know what the hell this is, but I love it. Not so sweet or bitter, nothing overpowering here, but very well balanced, peachy, yeasty. I love it. A total surprise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Its like a belgian zombie dust, but more focused on the belgian part of the beer and less focus on the hops. Great job Ale Asylum!"
"D/O- Highly drinkable considering ABV. Got better as it warmed a tad. Get this beer a head and it be great, otherwise a very good Belgian IPA. Hats off to Ale Asylum, my favorite from them so far."
""
"O - Overall this was a tasty beer with nice citra hop notes. Still, I'd like to see a bit more hop with this. All in all though it is a good beer."
""
"This drinks so amazingly well. I only grabbed two sixers of this and am now wishing I would have grabbed a case or more. Overall, this has to be my favorite american made belgian IPA. Love it!"
"Cost: $10.99 for a six pack."

"O: I was expecting a bit more Belgium qualities instead of almost straight IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation, scrubs the tongue dry without being aggressive. Pretty easy to drink beer with an interesting flavor profile from the citra hopping combining with the Belgian yeast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would buy this by the case as my every day IPA if I had access to it....if you are expecting some yeasty Belgian style blended IPA you'll be disappointed...if you just sit back and enjoy this bitch you'll love it...."
"Golden yellow body with three-eighths inch of retained white smooth soapy head. Lacey. Carbonation bubbles rising. Good hop and yeast aromas. Good bitternss with yeast very secondary. Good use of citra hops. Buttery mouthfeel, with the citra edge. Good drinkability."
"This is a surprisingly nice beer! It has a nice hoppy citrus (oranges/grapefruits/lemon) nose and a great, delicious hoppy amber ale taste. Perfectly carbonated and really well done. I am thouroughly impressed by something I had never heard of before! I would gladly take another one of these in a trade and I may even seek them out."
"Overall: very good beer by AA, probably my favorite by them. definitely worth a pick up, probably a bit better in warmer temps due to the fruity undertones. very robust and unique tasting beer."
"Overall, this is a strange beer as some components came across very strong and others seemed to struggle. Interesting and it is worth trying if you like belgian or IPA styles."
"The description sounded great: Citra hops, Trappist yeast, an IPA. A unique twist on the Belgo-IPA moniker. Unfortunately it does not live up to my expectations. The aroma screams Belgian with hints of phenols and spiciness. The mouthfeel is thin for such a beer and the Citra really doesn't shine through the yeast profile. At first sip it was an unexpected taste, upon letting it warm up and further tastes the beer is palatable but not as interesting as it could have been. I've had other beers by Ale Asylum and they do not disappoint. This one leaves the drinker wanting, and expecting more."
"Thank you, Ale Asylum."
"O: Mmm.. This beer was delicious, very glad I got to try it. It was the perfect pairing with my spicy nori sitting next to me. Very much worth trying if it's available to you."
"Overall good stuff. Not ridiculously good, but good."
"Burnt orange and cloudy in the glass with a slightly off white head on time that falls into a nice lace. Overripe grapefruit in the nose and some pepper and spice on top of some funky, yeasty smells as well. Good but convoluted. Bite is fairly strong from the hops in the initial taste that's followed by the funky, yeasty spice. Citra hops in the website description are apparent in both. More funk that hop in the taste. Nice Belgian IPA (note how easy it is to talk about it like it's a singular style already), but the marriage of the yeast and hop on this one is not a comfortable pairing. It seems to fight a bit, but just fine for the six pack I bought of it."
"Crisp earthy and citric ops throughout with sweet toasted malts and fruity yeast. All these flavors come together. Yeasty, bitter and malty all in one package."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a large white head that receded fairly quick. Aroma is big mango frutiness mixed with a nice Belgian yeast character. Taste is again very fruity with mango and maybe some passionfruit. Nice dry finish as is characteristic with Belgian yeast strains. Medium body with a nice medium level of carbonation. Overall a really well done beer in the Belgian IPA style. My only regret is that I don't live in Wisconsin to be able to buy more of this."
"D-Not my thing at all, the bitterness is so low key and the feel is just completely disappointing. I'm a little disappointed that I bought Citra hops to brew with based off this beer."
"Overall: An interesting mixture of American hops and Belgian malt characteristics. "
"O - Good for what it is, probably one of the better ones I've had for what it is. I just wish it wasn't what it was."
"O - I've had a lot of Belgian IPAs, but none hit it quite on the head like Ale Asylum does. All of their beers are great, but Bedlam is (imo) the best of them all. Superb, and a must-try if you ever come up to Madison!"
"Mouthfeel: It flows nicely on the tongue but I wouldn’t mind it being a little thicker so taste might stick around longer.3.5"
"O-- Good interperation with a bit of a twist. Smells and tastes Belgian but acts US in the mouth. Easy to drink and well hidden ABV. Can I have more of this please??"
"D - A true american/belgo ipa. Perfect balance of spicy yeast and citrusy hops. bitterness is more in tune with an apa, but this is one damn enjoyable beer. finishes dry, begging for another pint..."
"The beer pours a hazy orange-copper color with a clingy white head. The aroma is very inviting pronounced citrus hops and fruity, banana, and bubble gum yeast esters in the background. The flavor is a burst of hop flavor-very citrusy, a touch of pine, beneath the hops there is the reminder this is a Belgian IPA with some yeast character. The hop bitterness medium-high, but definitely second fiddle to the hop flavor. The beer finishes rather smooth, with a bit of a dry finish with loads of hops lingering in the palate. The body is medium and carbonation medium-high. Overall this is a wonderfully delicious beer. I need to buy more."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours a clear deep golden bronze with a spotty-lacing white head. Has a lightly sweet pale malty nose with a fresh citrusy hoppy character and a biscuity yeasty note. Starts with pretty good fullness and light malty sweetness with a grassy citrus hop bitterness and flavor for balance before a drier, herbal hop finish. A true to style and tasty Belgian-style IPA."
"Narrative: Hermes languished on Mount Cyllene kicking rocks idly in his path. “Ah Hermes, what’s gotcha lookin so long in the gums?” Argos asked, consoling with his many eyes. “Aw jeez Argos, I just got all this old speed and no one seems to want to get that wasted anymore.” “Oh?” Argus questioned with a series of tilted brows. “Yeah, here I was, getting all these people sufficiently drunk and all of a sudden, they cut my distribution to the lower Mediterranean, can you believe that? Then here I am just stuck to kick rocks with a bunch of Stoics, holy hams and eggs!” Hermes folded his arms and felt the power that he wielded. His speed could intoxicate a mortal man several times over. As a concession, he delivered an Edible Arrangement to the failing economy of Greece and hoped that they would continue to drink themselves into oblivion. “The EURO is strong with this one” Poseidon remarked and proceeded to destroy another coastal town, insouciantly."
"D - One of the best Belgian IPAs I've encountered (although good ones have been few and far between). I'd gladly pick up a six-pack of this next time I'm in WI. Ale Asylum has a definite winner here, so I hope it gets made more regularly in the future."
"Overall: This was another surprise beer. We knew nothing about this one but were all very happily surprised. Aside from the BCCS it was a highlight for the tasting. I always enjoy Belgian IPAs and wish more people would brew them."
"O: I had it on tap, and then on the way home bought a case. Terrific beer that more people need to try."
"Overall a pretty solid beer, drinks much smaller than its 7.5%. This would be a nice one to enjoy outside on a hot day. I don't usually care much for Belgian IPA's but this one is a winner in my book."
"O - I absolutely LOVED this beer and would recommend it to anyone. It is citrusy enough that many non hop-heads would like it, yet it still has enough hop flavor to cater to a true hop-head."
"Overall a really good tasting beer. I'll definitely look for this one again."
"GOOD BEER, WORTH TRYING!"
"Overall, a treat to sample, one of the best IPAs I have had to date. Thanks again Barry!"
"D - If I wasn't picking up the catty flavor from the citra this would be exceptional."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely seek out again. Definitely my favorite beer from Ale Asylum that I've tried. Surprisingly under the radar."
"O - Extremely pleasantly surprised by this beer. Was not expecting the complexity of flavors that I was presented with. I love this beer. Not sure of the price point, but I will hit up all my WI traders up to get more of this beer."
"O: This was my first Belgian IPA and I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a very pleasant mix of two different styles of beer. This was nicely hopped up but not too overbearing and still gave me the typical malty flavors of a Belgian ale."
"Round 2 of Bedlam just came out, so I thought I would check it out. Pours a golden brown with a small tan head. Looks good. Smells like spicy orange hops and the smell that wafts out of the next door neighbors windows before they throw on loud techno and order pizza...this represents a somewhat odd combo. The orange from the citrus hops comes out strongly in the taste, but in a grassy, spicy manner. The hop profile tastes somewhat similar to Surly Furious, though not executed as well. There might be just a touch of bready yeastiness representing the Trappist component, but if you didn't tell me that was there, I am not sure I would pick it up. It mostly comes out with a flavor like a really interesting IPA with a slightly odd twist. Mouthfeel is dead on, not too sweet or heavy, good carbonation. Overall, this is the beer I get 6 packs of when I want to have a few. It's so cheap and has a more interesting hop profile than many local WI beers."
"Seek this out fresh, don't settle for anything less."
"Drinkability: This was pretty good, sort of like a blend of a Belgian IPA and a DIPA. There are some more enjoyable examples of the style out there."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. it leans a little more american than belgian, but it's got a nice hop complexity and it is delicious."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Really nice hoppy character, nicely balanced, quite drinkable but the alcohol is a bit hot. Thanks Russ!"
"Really nice take on the Belgian IPA here, with some well balanced and robust hop character that marries quite nicely with that of the yeast. An easy drinking big body on this is only the icing on the cake. This is a winner from Ale Asylum."
"But great results cannot be second-guessed, and this is, by all means and measures, an amazing trip."
"D - Killer nuances create and exotic and deeply flavorful profile in Bedlam. Ale Asylum has proved, once again, that they know their hops and know them well. It's a very good beer with nice drinkability."
"Notes: This beer is awesome, very balanced, very tasty. I read an article that said the ABV is 7.5% - if so, this is extremely drinkable! Honestly I wish I had a case or two of this, I could see myself going through a couple bottles for sure."
"Cheers!"
"The tap version of this beer moved it into my favorite beer from Ale Asylum. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber color with good lacing that sticks pretty well down the whole pint glass. Smells fantastic with a very heavy citrus aroma. Not as hoppy as I expected and a bready aftertaste, but a good balance and just the right amount of carbonation for this brew. It feels really light and I could easily drink a few of these. It's a tasty brew for sure and leaves your mouth a bit dry tempting you for another sip."
"Another interesting extra from FrankenBrew. Pours from the bottle a hazy dark golden color, with some nice lingering off-white foam. Huge floral hop aroma, along with lemons and bubblegum. The Belgian yeast seems more prevalent on the palate, as the hops take a little bit more of a backseat. A really good example of the style, and much hoppier than most."
"I find this one comparable to the venerable Raging Bitch, with a slightly more complex malt profile and more tempered phenols"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Good body and carbonation add up to equal easy drinkability. This is another great brew from Ale Asylum and I love it when they bring the hops! Good way to showcase the Citra hops and the Trappist yeast brings a tasty twist. Thanks Severstad."
"Brandished copper body. Thin off white head leaves sporadic amounts of lace. Huge hop nose of bright pineapple and all things citrus, including tangerine too. Pineapple is the main player on the nose and a nice one at that. Awesome flavor follows suit with the nose. Hugely radiant citrus hop flavors. Pineapple and tangerine again. Biscuity malt base underneath provides the support needed. Body is medium and carbonation provides effervescent feel. This is really, really good. And I only got a singe of it. Damn."
"D. Another well done ale from AA that is easy to drink and enjoyable. Though not an upper tier IPA producer yet, AA has two excellent ones with Ballistic and now Bedlam. Highly recommended and one that I will buy on a regular basis."
"Pours a cloudy, golden color with about 2 fingers of head. Smell citrus hops and a little bit of yeast. Taste is citrusy and hoppy with a clean malt finish, deliciious. The mouthfeel is medium with a good amount of carbonation. I could drink a lot of this!"
"D- This was a very well balanced beer that I want more of. I am really surprised that a Belgian IPA can taste so good. I will be looking for this one again if they decided to make it again. First time beer for this company and I like what I have tasted so far!"
"Ale Asylum has been putting out quality beers from the get-go, and this is likely my favorite yet. I had a growler two weeks ago, and it's even better fresh. An excellent Belgian IPA!"
"drinkability: nice"
"Bedlam...it's delicious, hop forward, yet due to all the yeast qualities, ultimately well balanced. Leaves a fruity, slightly bitter flavor on the palate. I actually really enjoyed this beer. I found the unique combination of flavors to be quite delicious."
"D- A good representation of the style. They have found a nice balance between the two which equals a nicely balanced brew. This may be a little sweet for some but I think it is a solid offering from Ale Asylum."
"D: A solid Belgian IPA. A bit too sweet for everyday drinking, but it was definitely an enjoyable treat."
"Really digging this new offering from Ale Asylum...well balanced, supremely easy to drink while not sacrificing any flavor. Would like to try on tap or a bottled version (coming soon, bartender showed me the label printout) and see if the mouthfeel improves a bit..."
