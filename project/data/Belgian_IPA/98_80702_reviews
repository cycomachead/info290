"Just been drinking this beer on draught in a Wetherspoons pub.It was absolutely gorgeous.Looked good and tasted superb.I didnt realise it was so strong as it does not state the ABV on the pumpclip so it made a mess of me.Recommended."
""
"Overall:  Not that impressive as far as Harpoon offerings go.  It's perfectly drinkable, but I think I was expecting something a little more.  It's my first White IPA, so maybe this is typical of this style."
""
""
""
"A very nice IPA that the wheat gives a nice mouth feel.  I would buy this one any day of the week."

"O: A good beer and interesting in that it combines wheat flavor with the hoppy bite normally associated with all malt IPAs. This won't ever be my ""go to"" beer, but it's worth a try and an occassional 6-pack."

"O- Incredibly refreshing, bright, and drinkable. I am not a hop head and being only 45 IBUs this IPA is very approachable. If you aren't big on more hop-forward IPAs you have to give this one a try. Honestly, I don't understand why it's not rated even higher. Just a great beer."
""
""

"my review does not seem to do this beer justice, while I would not call it great it would be a great go to when out dining or at the bar, easy drinking, has a pleasant character all the way around, damn smooth drinking brew, if you see it out on tap, grab some, I think this will be a nice addition to my summer brew lineup as a change of pace, nicely made."
""
""
"Overall I am really not sure what to think of this so called ""white IPA"" beer style of late, but this one is very unique compared to others I have had."

"Anyway... We had singles of it, so I figured I'd give it a shot to be able to tell customers how it is. The appearance is hazy yellow, 1 finger white head, plenty of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass, all nice aspects of a White IPA except points off for zero lacing. Aroma seemed very faint to me with hints of orange and pineapples in there somewhere if you searched for them. The flavor outweighed the scent by a long shot -- nice burst of tropical fruits and a firm but not overwhelming hop bitterness, lemons or limes in the aftertaste. I feel like there's a sort of tartness or sour flavor that lasts on the tongue but since no one else said that I feel kind of crazy. Pleasantly surprised by this offering from Harpoon, I could see myself buying a six pack when the weather starts getting a bit warmer. Cheers."

"Respectable and easily approachable white/Belgian styled IPA. Worth a try"

"Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass, best by 5/15/14. Pours a dark yellow, with a two inch fluffy white head that leaves behind some webs of lace. Smell is clove, mango, oranges, fresh cut grass, and some hints of banana. Taste is all of that, a nice pucker of grapefruit that hangs on the tongue a while. Body is not quite medium, great amount of life, a little dry, and easy drinking for sure. This is a solid beer, I love so many of the cross breed's. Toss extra hops in any beer and I like it."

"Just got this into the store this week. Opened the bottle to a great smell of hops mixed with citrus. Poured into a chilled pint glass and the smell got even better. Small white head and a cloudy, orange/ copper color to the body. Taste of hops hit first, then the citrus and spices take over. Finishes nicely tangy and tart at the end. Very refreshing IPA."

"This is a nice White IPA. This has an intense citrus character similar to their UFO beers, but this has a nice, herbal, piny hop character that rounds out the flavor nicely. There is good balance and drinkability here. This is definitely worth a try."
""

"So today is my birthday and we ran by our local Costco to get some beer to bring to a friend's house. Bought a case of Harpoon and tried to share. They were drinking PBR and would not partake. Enjoying my third beer of the evening and really enjoy the white IPA. I can taste the orange described on the front page of the beer but cannot taste the coriander. Come to think of it I don't know what coriander tastes like. The beer is a little ""hoppy"" but I tend to like that. I will definitely drink this beer again. Inexpensive but good."
"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. The feel is lively, uplifting and very easy drinking. The IPA portion of this ""blended style"" is much more focused than the white aspect. Having never had a ""white IPA"" before, I was not really sure what to expect. I think this was done pretty well and would not mind trying other examples of this if given the chance. Thanks again Matt!"
" The flavor is great it has the orange zest and slight tangy citrus from the hops with a mild pine accent and slight tropical taste with yeast adding a light peppery phenolic element and wheat giving a gentle tanginess which adds to the citrus from the hops. Overall I loved this all the best elements of an IPA combined with the belgian Wit style a very nice hybrid from Harpoon!"
"Taste starts with sweet pale, citrus in the middle, and sedate pine hops character feathers into the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good. Nice brew, too bad label says it is limited."

"O- This one surprised me. I'm not a huge wit fan though I enjoy a good Belgian. IPA's? Who doesn't like 'em. This is a perfect melding of the two. I picture my self on a tropical beach, drinking these down all day long."
"Harpoon White IPA pours out a hazy orange color with a tiny head that laces well. The aroma is big on citrus hops that are very well rounded by the Belgian yeast. The taste follows with a very nice hop character for the style that actually works with the yeast as opposed to against it, as tends to happen with Belgian IPAs. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability goes. As far as Belgian IPAs go, I actually like this one. It's basically a solid IPA with just a little bit of Belgian character."
""
""
""
"O/D-This Harpoon brew is stellar. Quirky and complex. This is one of Harpoon's best hoppy offerings. This one should be a year-rounder."
""
""
""
"Toasted grains and herbal bitterness up front. Hops become peppery and spicy as sweetish fruit juice malts fill in. Slightly tropical with a bit of strawberry and banana. Grassy, herbal, slightly citrus hops into the finish. Lingering spiciness and Juicy Fruit. Medium to moderate body. Another nice IPA iteration from the Harpoon mix pack."
""
""
""
""
"D: Very complex brew, and I have to say its pretty damn good...Both the Wit and IPA styles are so distinct that it almost clashes at times, but is still so interesting that you can't put the glass down... Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
"I think it's a pretty desent beer and easy drinking. Has summer written all over it."

"Overall – Doesn't really taste like a Belgian IPA (as it's listed as on BA) - but regardless it's a great beer. Reminds me more of a APA with some nice fruity notes. I'd buy a 6 pack of this."
""
""
"O: A nice, refreshing take on the white IPA. Plenty of fruity and citrus goodness with quite a bit of bitterness. Quite easy to drink as well. So far, this is a nice pack of IPAs. Onto the black"
"O: One of the better beers I've had from Harpoon and actually pleasantly surprised by this one. Very refreshing beer, prefer it to the regular IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O- great pronounced citrus and tropical aromas with a well balanced flavor profile, very refreshing and one of the best I've had from the 100 barrell series."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good brew. I might be a little biased because of the fact I am a huge IPA fan but maybe it works for me in me telling you that there is no failing when making this beer a purchase. Grab a glass and drink, Salud!"
"O: I'm glad I got it for under ten bucks, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. It's the first 100 Barrel Series that hasn't particularly wowed me."
"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, coriander, spice, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, citrus, earth, fruit, and coriander. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like what I found on this brew if I am honest. There was a nice touch of complexity and balance going on in both the aroma and the flavor. The coriander note I got was a really nice touch for the style, but the citrus notes were what made the beer for me. It added just the right amount of sweetness to the brew to keep me smelling and tasting it as long as my sample lasted. Could easily crush a pint of this and maybe a few more while I was at it. I suggest you take a chance on this one as well."
"O: a great take on a white ipa, they should make this a regular"
""
"Poured into a small tulip glass a slightly hazed peach tinged lighter golden with a half finger lacey white head atop.The aromas really don't jump out at ya but the citric hops are there,lemony and orange notes over top of a healthy yeast shot.Lemon oil and grapefruit flavors give a bright and sharp flavor some breadiness underneath,the lemony notes linger nicely.The yeast is held in check well and the hops are bright,a solid BIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely not your typical beer. It's kind of a hybrid of an IPA and a witbier, but it seems to work very well. Drinkable."
"Overall: a very tasty beer that is easy to consume and refreshing. Well worthy of a try if you can find it."
""
""
"The Wit components were more evident in the appearance and smell than the taste in which the Wit was simply an accent to a bright IPA."
""
"Overall what I like about this beer is the backbone of a more foresty pine sort of thing. It goes down smooth and with a lot of flavor. The bitterness is well balanced. Much better than the last 100 barrel series I had."
""
""
""
"Damn, no fruit? I guess it was just juicy, juicy hops this whole time. Even now, I know there's not fruit in here, but I still taste it! Weird. I enjoyed (and am still enjoying!) it quite a bit."

"Harpoon's BWhite IPA pours a very cloudy tangerine, with three fingers or so of fluffy white foam rising to the rim of the glass. Head retention is pretty good, and the foam sticks to the side of the glass and leaves lacing pretty well. The nose has a little bit of spice to it, but otherwise just lots of juicy, citrus aromas wafting up from the glass. There's a lightly appreciable wheat graininess right at the open, before a sturdy bitterness makes itself known. The hoppy finish has some orange tinted citrus flavors, but it's not quite as pungent and ""in your face"" as I would have liked. The body has just a little bit of the chewy quality that I sometimes associate with wheat. The carbonation it's matched with though is just not lively enough. Harpoon's (newest?) entry in the 100 Barrel Series is a good take on the new White IPA trend, but it could stand to be a little bit hoppier."
"Pretty mellow, maybe more of a wit than an IPA. Very enjoyable."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/19/2012. Pours hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Good foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon, mango, pepper, herbal, grass, pine, earth, floral, and yeast spices. Fantastic aromas with good balance and complexity. Great hop profile as well. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, lemon, pineapple, pepper, herbal, pine, floral, earth, grass, and yeast spices. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pepper, herbal, pine, earth, grass, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of hop flavor and Belgian character; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance as well. No cloying flavors at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent White IPA! Great hop flavor profile with nice complexity; extremely smooth to drink. Highly enjoyable offering; might get more if it is still around."
"(4.0) D: This is one of my favourite 100 Barrel Series I’ve tried to date. It’s got a little bit of everything and worthy of a try."
""
"A hazy orange body with a foamy two-finger ecru cap. The cap fades slowly, revealing some spider web lacing. The nose is of oranges, wheat, candied grapefruit, and some spicy pepper. On the palate, candied grapefruit and oranges dominate the palate. A clean bed of hay and spicy pepper with some soft apple and grape laying low. Even some sweet vanilla and grassy notes in the finish. Medium body with soft carbonation. The finish is sweet and dry. White IPA's work if they are clean and tight. The candied grapefruit/orange and sweet malt are just too dominant to let the base wit flavors poke through. Decent, but nothing special."
"O: This is a fine White IPA. I'm giving much of the credit to the Citra hops, though the bottle says there are others (I think Simcoe and Cascade) in the mix as well."
" I treated this one like a session brew, gulp, gulp, gulp! but it's nice n complex and well worth sipping. This is easily of the very best from the small batch collection!!"
""
"Overall, this is good fare, and certainly an interesting mix of witbier and IPA. By themselves, each of these styles are well represented in here, and would make for a delicious beer. Together, they have great potential to become something greater, and do for the most part, but in the end the grapefruit zest from the hops simply overpowers everything, and makes the aftertaste messy."
""
"Traditional IPA flavor. I can't detect the ""Wit"" portion of this beer--no wheat in the flavor. This is a dry beer. Also, I don't detect any Belgian styled yeast. Still, this is a good IPA. The body is predictably average, the carbonation slightly elevated."
""
"I'm glad Harpoon seems to be doing some more interesting/ experimental things with the 100-barrel series again (Black IPA, Spruce Tip, White IPA). Do more like these and I'll pay attention. I didn't bother to try the Ginger Wheat and Maple Wheat, that theme is old and busted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are better choices within the style."
""
"I'll second the bland part. It just doesn't feel ""right"" but that could easily be carbonation level, etc."
"Frankly I'm blown away at the level of hop aroma and flavor coming out of this beer. The grapefruit notes really give the beer character while the lingering orange flavor adds a little something extra with each sip. Quite simply, excellent."
""
""
"I'm fairly new to the style, though I guess the style is new in general, but I like it. My un-biased pick as the father vs. son beer battle winner."
""
"More complex than I anticipated, a lot going on with the hop profile and as it bounces off the Wit side of the brew it does well but comes back in a different way as it was to compliment and somewhat clash at the same time. The most interesting White IPAs brewed that I have tried, the UFO brand should take this beer on it is that good."
"Overall this is definitely the best white IPA I've ever had, and absolutely one of the best beers I've had. I'll definitely buy a few more of these while they're still around."
""
""
""
"M: Lightly carbonated, just thick enough - really pleasant."
