Aromas of Belgian funk and some banana, and then some nice lemon. Lemon/citrus came through on the flavor side, the funk was very smooth, and there was a nice bitterness to boot. Excellent balance and flavor. Light mouthfeel, more of a nice, clean IPA feel than a Belgian (or at least those I have tried). This was a really well done beer, and the best 'Belgian IPA' that I have tried. I may have to try more!","Mikus","Sep 05, 2014"

3.93,3.4,2.75,4,4,4,4,"Overall (4.0): This is interesting to me because it kiiind of breaks the mold(s) of other “Belgian IPAs”. Most are some combination of American IPA with nominally Belgian yeast, legit but over-hopped saison, or hoppy tripel/BSPA. This is more like an amber-ish Belgian pale ale with a moderate but well-placed load of mixed American and classic noble hops. That’s how it comes off to me, anyway. That said, it’s not phenomenal by any means—just solid to very solid in almost every way (though I am a sucker for lacing). Definitely worth trying if you’re into the “Belgian IPA” thing.","fmccormi","May 25, 2014"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,4,3.75,"O: Overall this was an excellent IPA, the belgian yeast strain and the hops compliment but do not over power each other. Recommended.","Mavigo","May 25, 2014"

The aroma offers a very solid bubblegum, floral hop with delicate grain some cotton candy sweetness. very nice and just what I like in a BIPA. The flavor comes on with a slightly more subdued bubblegum with more of a yeasty bite and bright wheat and sweet corn. The body is medium light and there's a fairly lush feel from the frothy carbonation, but it hints at a bit of a watery quality at times. The taste really is a minor let down after the attractive smell that introduced it. But it's certainly a good brew. There's some apple and pineapple ideas here and I guess I have to identify some clove, some general spiciness and pumpernickel bread. It seems to get better as it warms up. Nice brew but there are others I like better for this style.","Durge","Jul 10, 2013"

Tastes are a nice balance of sweetness, bitterness, and complexity; fresh grapefruity citrus shines through the caramely and biscuity malt. Fruity and spicy notes come through with the Belgian yeast, finishes bitter with some pine and astringency. Thinner body, but ample carbonation.

This strikes me more as a straightforward IPA with some floral notes at the end, which I suppose is the Belgian aspect. A nicely enjoyable blending of styles which I enjoyed.

The taste brings in more of the same, but with a good amount more grapefruit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish.

It had good drinkability, it was pretty smooth and refreshing, I could drink a pint or two but that would be my limit. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the drinkability, this beer looked really good and was much more drinkable then I thought. What I liked the least about this beer was that the flavors seemed just a little muted and not as intense as they should be, it might be a little old but with no canning date I can't be sure so I'm holding that against them. I would buy this beer again, I would like to try it fresh and I would recommend giving it a try if you are into this style. All in all this is another solid beer from Brewery Vivant, it seems to me that all their beers are pretty solid at the least and that is really reflected in their three year round beers, I would say this is my second favorite, with Solitude being my favorite and Farmhand being my least favorite.

Good amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, and yeast spices. Great balance of hop flavors, bitterness, and Belgian character; with a hop character being a little more pronounced. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel.

The opening overture to any symphony that may or may not proceed, but you will never get it from a bottle. I am simply astounded by the way that each of them has produced a thick, dense layer (anywhere between a finger to two or more fingers) of head and even more so by its sustainability. ""Beer Drinkers Get More Head", so reads a patch on one of my many jackets and if you are drinking a Brewery Vivant beer from a CAN, truer words were never spoken. Then the lacing ... This World, and Then, the Fireworks, or in this case, the elegant, delicate lacing that makes me want to drop to my knees and lick every succulent inch. Whoops! I have been warned against such digressions and so we return to the beer. A deep orangish-amber in color with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Is it hot in here, or is it just me? The nose was absolutely floral, like being in a hops field, but underlain by a light mustiness. This is the equivalent of one of my neo-hippie redheaded girlfriends distilled into a glass! I have known you many times, my darling, and you are always unwavering in your intensity. The mouthfeel was full and big-bodied and I could name names, but I won't. The spice of the hops intermingled well with the sweetness of the malt and suddenly I was in the back seat of an Oldsmobile the night before a deployment in 1993. I remember you well and I hope that you have the same fondness for my memory. The finish was dry, bitter and lingering, the same way that each of my redheaded relationships have ended. I need merely to lick my lips to conjure up a memory of each and every one of them, but to what avail? A slap across the face, perhaps spit upon like a llama being told what to do, or worse, a knee to the groin. C'mon, baby, I love you, but your intensity is sometimes too much even for me. As to the cooler, me and my redheads NEVER went to the beach. We were all big on movies, especially screened movies, which is one of the things I do miss about California - the ability to buy beer at the cinema or to sneak it in and not have anyone care. A movie marathon, a CAN of beer and thou, or words to that effect. Oh my.","woodychandler","Jul 31, 2011"

4.15,9.2,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability: I could have a few of these. It's the best one I've had from Brewery Vivant so far.","bigdaddyeric301","Jul 24, 2011"
3.85,1.3,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall a very low-key, very balanced Belgian IPA that earns high marks for dinkability (and container portability).","Another6Pack","Jul 10, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"The appearance is a nice Golden Clear color with wonderful white head retention that seems to be lacing. The smell is frothe with pine and citrus undertones. The taste begins with nice cirtus start hints of grapefruit that then pass to lean more towards apricot. The taste does not linger long comes off the pallete quick. The mouthfeel is awesome and could session this one! Its nice.","WoodBrew","Jul 01, 2011"
4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"I'm glad I picked this up and am looking forward to the other Brewery Vivant singles I unexpectedly found on this trip. I'll grab some more on my next trip to Michigan.","ssimpson89","Jun 25, 2011"
3.5,-7.9,4,4,3,4,3.5,"A quality beer, subtle for an IPA, without the quirkyness of the Belgian versions.","brc","Jun 22, 2011"

3.63,-4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D: Tasty, light and thin. I'd be alright ordering another. I probably won't buy again. Bummer cause I was psyched about the idea of a Belgian inspired brewery canning tallboys in the vicinity!","dfillius","Jun 07, 2011"
3.65,-3.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall- very good and well repped Belgian IPA.","GrandCruDrew","Jun 03, 2011"
4.34,14.2,4,5,4,4,4.5,"O - I would have to say they nailed the style with ease. A wonderful brew. I would have to think this brew is quite underrated. Thank you for sharing Another6Pack.","chugalug06","May 31, 2011"

4.12,8.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. If I lived within 3 hours of this brewery I'd be making a trip there this weekend to try some of this, and their other beers on tap, and also take some more home with me. Having only one can of this is just a tease!","indiapaleale","May 16, 2011"
4.24,11.6,4,5,4,4,4,"Overall, this brew is fantastic. Perhaps even better than the tap version I can compare it to. It manages to project a cleanliness and flavor that are just superb. I will definitely be putting another quad pack of this in my fridge soon, which is a statement I don't make all that often given the sea of quality we craft brew enthusiasts swim in these days. I am excited about this brewery. Solid drank.","SupaCelt","May 14, 2011"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O- Overall, I really enjoyed this. With the can packaging, this is going to be an epic summer beer out on the boat.","david131","May 12, 2011"
3.75,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"O- It's a solid beer. It could be a little more bold, but I'd definitely buy it again as an easy drinker. It seems like it could be a good multi-purpose beer. It was really nice on this warm spring day. Potentially good paired with food.","GRPunk","May 08, 2011"
3.2,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"This is drinkable but feels a bit light for the style.","TCgoalie","Feb 17, 2011"
