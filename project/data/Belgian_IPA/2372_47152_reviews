"O - this is an easy drinking beer considering how big it is. I normally don't like really big beers, (defined by me as above 8%) but this one is a notable exception."
""
""
"O - Really good beer that hides the high ABV very well. Easy beer to drink. Only knock is would like more hop bitterness. Would like to try a fresher bottle."

"I was surprised at how good this was. Typical Belgian tripel taste all the way with good hop bite. Almost ideal for its type. Masterfully made and I would expect it would be sure to please any lover of such. The high ABV is well covered. So good it makes the name seem ironic."
"deceptively smooth, a really nice blend for my taste, I don't love some belgians (usually too sweet) but this cuts the difference with hops ... and who can argue with that? a very americanized beer in a good way"

"Pretty good."
""
""

"O: No idea how to properly rate this one. On one hand, there’s little to no hop presence, on the other hand, it’s much closer to the Belgian trippel than many of the other American renditions of the style. So, it loses points with me for the former, but this is actually pretty decent with the latter."
"Medium body."
""
""
""
"O - The bottle says that it is a combination of a tripel and an ipa. I think the tripel won. It is a pretty tasty beer. Very different from others in this style."
""
""
""
""
"3.66/5.00"
""
""
"M - Medium body. Creamy. Dry. Light carbonation."
"Overall, a good beer, but I think I'm going to need to try another. I enjoy Terrapin beers, especially the Rye and the Big Hoppy Monster, so will give this one another shot when the weather cools down a bit to see if I feel any differently about it."
""
""
""

""
"This one's not in the league with the others. I gambled with this four-pack, and I lost a small stack. I don't want to dwell on it, but this beer did not meet my expectations. Just another obvious ""miss", even though it ain't half-bad as a bolder and more exotic American Red Ale."
""
"Overall, a decent Belgian IPA but it all fees a bit muddy. I would like a little more hop character and less alcohol taste. Nonetheless one to pick up should you come across it."

"Overall – It starts out very Triple like and then advances to being much more hop bittered. A little more bitter at the end then is quite complementing of the sweeter triple flavors, but interesting and quite drinkable none the less. Not bad and worth a try."

"They were aiming for a tripel malt bill with an American hopped IPA bill, right? It was a good attempt, and it's a tasty beer, but the drinkability wasn't too great - I dunno if I could have more than one of these. Sweetness is nice at first, but tiresome by the end. Not bad, but not great."
"This beer is much more Belgian than IPA. Smooth and sweet with a mild hop tone to things; and I do mean mild. A slight touch of a burn from alcohol, which seems minimal in comparison to the 9.6% abv. Very smooth feel and very easy to drink. Nice brew. American brewers strike again with an excellent interpretation of a Belgian style."

"O: Interesting, but not exceptionally so. Recommended, but I wish it were more Belgian-y and less IPA-y."
""
"Overall- Well executed but fairly typical for the style- nothing new, surprising, or particularly complex. Worth trying, although a bit on the heavy side, a six pack would last me a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"My only problem is the high abv. It would prevent me from having to many and this beer screams out for more."
""
""
"overall i thought this was a perfect beer for its style."
"Huge floral nose. Thought the yeast added a great deal to this brew in terms of both aroma and flavor. Have never had any complaints about this hopped up belgian and hope I never will. Will continue to drink this beer at home and in bars when presented with the (all too rare) opportunity. Thanks Terrapin and keep on truckin'!!!"
"D: needs a lot of refinement. just a big sweet mess with a touch of metal. hardly any hoppiness in my opinion. pass from a brewery that has a lot of other solid offerings."
""
"Mouthfeel I personally wasn't digging, but I think it was a decent representation of the style. The carbonation level was ok. Light bodied working its way to medium. Fairly aggressive bites and bitterness from the alcohol and probably the hops as well, not completely balanced. Overall seems to be a decent representation of the style. Happy to have tried it, Terrapin knows how to brew a good beer."
""
"I was intrigued by this, and was wowed by the look and aroma when poured. Nice clear golden orange color with a big fluffy head on top. Aroma was sweet honey, some yeast, grapefruit, pineapple. Unfortunately, the flavor did not live up. Very little hint of any tripel dryness and yeast, and overly sweet. Not a bad beer, but I think this combo has more potential. Terrapin should try this again with some tweaking, and maybe a regular ipa rather than a double."

"O – This beer is very interesting. As far as positives, it looks great and hides the moderately high ABV extraordinarily well. Unfortunately, the more important parts of the beer – aroma and taste – are so-so. They fit the supposed mold of a Belgian IPA, but the beer just doesn’t smell or taste particularly good in my opinion. This is not a bad beer, but I won’t be searching it out again. I’m interested to see how other Belgian IPAs taste to compare to this one. Maybe I’m just not a fan of the style."
"Overall: this one is much not earthy ad herbal than others I have head. Very Belgian, this is a very nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"O: 2010 was one of my favorites, '11 was forgettable and this '12 is back on track. Excellent, complex and well put together Belgian IPA, comparable to an Allagash Hugh Malone."
""
""
"I rather enjoyed this beer. It was a bit more complex than I had anticipated. The flavors were well balanced, and I thought it had a strong hop presence. I'll definitely pick this up again."
""
""
""
""
"A tough style to do really well. Since Terrapin is a brew I can't get normally, I'll seek out their other brews in the future."
""
""
""
"Not as I remember, beers change ... palates change. Regardless this brew is flavorful but a controlled mess at the same time. Bitterness seems to be pulled away from the flavor and strikes quick and then pulls back and the alcohol character is a bit out of whack. Still a fun brew to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is aromaticly and tastefully satisfying. I am a huge fan of this mix of styles. I want more and if I get more I'm not sure I will share."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know about this one."
"It's readily apparent why it's no longer a side project, it's a well-done tripel-sorta style with a lotta hops. It's consistently the same, Belgiany sort of spritzer-like zing with a nice hoppy (genuine IPA-style) batch of hops. It's delish! The feel is a little flighty, as the bubblies flatten to a finish rather than tickle the cheeks (it IS a beer). Haven't I seen this in Cabernet barrels? Now there's a side-side project (in a bottle) I could go for! Why not release that in a series with Substance Abuse (WnB in JD barrels)? That'd be awesome."
""
"O - The aroma was less than desirable although I didnt blow it up on my rating because I can appreciate the style, its just not something I'm into. Thankfully the flavor of the brew had more going on than the nose would indicate and the yeast allowed really nice citrusy hops to come through. Really kind of surprised how much I enjoy this one, one of the most enjoyable Belgian IPA's I have had"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer can be considered as a Belgian Double/Imperial IPA and hides its alcohol very well from the taste."
""
""
""
"O - A good beer with high drinkablility. The ABV is masked well but I feel there is much that could be improved."
""
""
"taste: Not up to the nose but still nice. The refreshing sweet fruits don't quite deliver."
"Drinkability: Oh, so good, good job Athens, from a GT alum."
"O: In the Belgian IPA style it is pretty good. I would definitely recommend this beer. No off flavors, very crisp and clean with natural Belgian flavors."
""
""
""
"O: Good, one of the better Belgian IPAs in my opinion."
""
"I actually think a little time would do this beer a lot of good. The hops are a little prevalent just yet but I'm guessing that in a couple of months, this will be a nice brew..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty Belgian style IPA with initially subdued hops and a very well-hidden, high ABV."
"O - I love this for a change of pace IPA. The fruits, spice and somewhat restrained hops are meld together well. No clue what happened the first time I reviewed it but this bottle is spot on!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, will definitely have a second or third of these if I ever come by it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would totally consider getting it again if I could find a four pack but it was totally worth the 3 dollars I paid."
""
""
"O: I can see why people would not like this, it's sweet as heck with a lot of going on, but I absolutely love this sweet nectar. This is something I will buy at least once a year."
"O: Great blend of a double ipa and trippel. Not overwhelming with hops and rather smooth and easy to drink. Highly recommend this beer."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a crisp hop bite up front that gives off hints of pine and citrus peel. Not very dry or bitter, however, because of the estery light fruit and alcohol sweetness. Hints of zesty pepper and coriander followed by a grass/straw presence as well as some apple and pear before a boozy dry finish. Nicely balanced, flavorful and easy to drink. Not the best looking beer and could us a bit more body but it's a pretty solid IPA/Belgian Ale hybrid."

"Hazy, pale golden color. The beer has a soapy, shallow, white head. The aroma is more fruity than hoppy... apricot, citrus, fig, and pear. There is a little pale malt and some herbal hops in the aroma as well, but he fruit dominates. Moderate in carbonation, this beer has a spritzy feel, but not the carbonic bite of a lot of other Belgian style brews. The taste is solid, and the best aspect of this brew. Some sweetness up front, balanced with a huge hop flavor and lots of back-of-the-tongue bitterness. It's a warming, aggressively flavorful brew. I enjoyed this one."

"O: This isn't my first Belgian IPA but I've only had one other so I'm not totally an expert on style. That said, since I do know beer in general...this is a good one."
"My second Terrapin beer and it lives up to the brewery's high accolades and respect. I think they've crafted an outstanding Belgian IPA with this one. I'm going to savor the rest of my glass and look forward to the next time I'm able to enjoy some fine beer by Terrapin."
"Meh, typical american made belgian style brew. Not sure why most American brewers can't figure these styles out. The flavors are too heavy handed, not delicate. Boozy."
"They recommend aging for up to 3 years and I think I'm gonna see where a few bottles of this goes with some more age."
"O - Not what I was hoping for when I ordered the only Belgian-sounding thing on the menu. It seems more like an American Pale Ale with some Belgian characteristics than anything. However, it is an enjoyable beer even for a die-hard Belgian fan like me. I'd prefer the emphasis to be on malt and yeast, but this is a good beer."
"A very unique beer that I really enjoyed. This is a good beer to mix up your normal rotation with."
"O- this is what I want from a cross over style. Terrapin, this may be my number one BIPA out there. I need more!"
"Nice lasting head with great lace. Smells of clove hit hard. Tastes great with alot of fruit yeast and hop flavor. As it warms the aroma transforms from clove to a strong unmistakeable banana aroma, interersting. Reminded me of a hopped up hefe more than a hopped up triple, which I thought I was getting. I enjoyed every sip of this. Felt creamy and smooth with a hop bite that was weaker than i expected. Overall I enjoyed it and will pick up a 4 pack just for me next time."
"Good beer, I like it a lot for a change of pace on the tastebuds."
"O: A wonderful beer. True, there is a bit of a burn on the back end, but I could drink a few of these. I like Terrapin in general, but I believe this is my favorite of their brews. Highly recommended for anyone into an interesting flavor that isn't afraid to try something a bit off-center."
"O: Overall its not bad, just not as hoppy as I would have liked it."
"Overall is real good. A solid Terrapin offering."
"This beer a golden orangey color with minimal head and minimal lacing. Pretty clear as well. The aroma is reminiscent of both a belgian pale ale and, oddly enough, apple juice. Quite fruity nose. The beer is very light and again fruity with a bit of apple that is overwhelmed by more citrus forward hops. Not much bitterness at all, but an interesting marriage of belgian yeast and citrus. Mouthfeel is pretty light and maybe a bit undercarbonated. Good beer. It is deceptively drinkable especially for a 10% beer."
"Pours a nice dark copper with a small white head. Aroma of sweet malts, earthy piney hops, and some fruity notes. Taste is sweet caramel malt earthy piney hops and a nice earthy resin flavor with some yeast. Palate is full bodied with good carbonation and a resin earthy mouth feel. Finish is sweet caramel malts with some good biiter hops for balance,and some yeast ending with a nice nutty and spicy fruity flavor. Overall a nicely balanced DIPA."
"Overall: I enjoyed the hops and the fruit notes, but the alcohol was a bit too much given the other flavors. Still a good beer."
"Pours a translucent copper with about a half inch of bubbly, white head. It fades quickly, and leaves little to no lacing. This one smells of some earthy, piney hops, lemon, apple, and some tart pear, and some floral, faintly yeasty notes. A really interesting nose here. Taste begins with some of the fruits and citrus, moves to some bitter, resiny hops, but finishes with an almost sour funk. Really odd; not unpleasant, just unexpected. Mouth is smooth and refreshing, but feels a bit thin and undercarbonated. Overall, a decent brew, but not one I'd seek out again. The blending of these styles just doesn't do it for me in this one."
"Pours a light copper color with a stingy white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of candied dark fruit, slightly earthy with a hint of Belgian yeast esters. IPA? Hops? What? Very little in the way of hops find their way into my nostrils. Tastes is sweet with dark fruits and candy sugar. There I found some hops and a bit of ethanol. Earthy and resinous hops come through but are quickly drowned out by a bit of alcohol burn. Fairly dry finish with lingering lighter fluid and sugary fruit. Medium body and carbonation level, sweet syrupy mouthfeel. Decent brew, wasn't at all what I was expecting. The heat is a bit harsh and the hops a bit muted, but tasty nonetheless."
"A nice melding of styles. Wish more of the hops showed on the nose, but they definitely are there on the taste."
"O: pretty good beer - at about $11 per 4 pack, I might not get it again soon, but it was good to have and get me acquainted more with the style."
"Overall - Pretty tasty for a big beer. Lot sof flavor, pretty smooth, but a tad too boozy. Still Good to drink and pretty right on for the style."
"o: my first belgian ipa and i love it. big thanks to nashvillian for including this as an extra. not at all what i expected and i wish i had more."
"This is a good beer overall and a good representation of its class. Unfortunately, the class as a whole falls short for me and always leaves me wishing I had chosen either an IPA or a Belgian. I will venture on and continue to try beers out of this class, but I may never be a fan."
"I have some high ABV brews with some fine smoothness but the spiceyness is a bit forward. The complexity is there and makes this one a good sipper."
"Overall: I think that this beer passed it prime along time ago. Or I must have gotten a bad beer. Terrapin is a great brewery and this is not the true representation of the quality beer that Terrapin makes. Will have to try this fresh and update the review in spring."
"O- This was a very tasty beer in my opinion, crisp and refreshing, however, it did not meet many of the criteria for its category, therefore I had to give it low marks."
"Sampled from a bottle, 2011 vintage. Light, copper orange in color with a slight haze. Poured with a thick, frosty, belgian head that slowly reduced to a healthy white cap that left a few sticky lacings on the glass. Belgian yeast and citrus hops are the dominant aromas, with hints of spice, banana and biscuit malt. On the lighter side of medium bodied with a slightly resinous feel. Belgian yeast, citrus orange and pink grapfruit flavors in the beginning, with a spicy, tangy taste and feel jumping into the middle. Banana and biscuit malt flavors show up from the middle through to the end. Hop flavors go from bitter and tangy to sweet at the finish. Alcoholic heat is very apparent from the middle to the finish. Lots of interesting flavors.This style is growing on me."
"It was so strong in fact, that this almost felt like a Barleywine. There's not as much grain here but I had to slow myself down while enjoying this because I found feel the booziness of this beer. That being said, this was wonderful to behold and a great marriage of styles. It's worth savoring for quite a few reasons and fans of extreme beers will not be disappointed here."
"O- I'm starting to really like this style but thought of this more of a Tripel than an IPA. There wasn't a lot of citrus hop character and 9.6 ABV was easily noticeable. A good beer to try though."
"D: I nice brew, but I would like a lot more flavor when I am committing to this many calories. All the right notes are there, but they just don't jive. Nonetheless, this brew is enjoyable, innovative, and should be given a shot."
"Many thanks to BPreston for the chance to taste this one. Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a dark orange/red color, just a little head that quickly recedes, very little retention. Smell- a little acetone, some wine-ish (maybe sauvignon blanc grapes) flavors, a little bit of banana. This smells pretty harsh, it doesn't work that well. Taste- definite hop bitterness, but more acetone. Harsh Harsh Harsh. no real malt sweetness to speak of. This is a mess. Mouthfeel- avg. Drinkability- I'll have to choke this one down, but its pretty close to a drainpour."
"12 oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Poured a clear gold with a finger of off white head. A little boozy in the aroma, some banana and a little Belgian spice. Medium bodied. Pretty hot with alcohol. Fair amount of malt sweetness. Some hops in the finish, but not enough to balance the sweetness. A bit of Belgian yeast spice, but mostly banana. This didn't do a whole lot for me."
"Overall this was a huge disappointment for me. This is such an invigorating style when done well."
"O - i feel like adding banana flavored flintstone gummiebears to an ipa does not make it a ""belgian"" ipa and for that terrapin you fail, the yeasty characters are absoulutely wondering the halls on drugs without a hall pass, only to find a gah damn sno-cone stand serving nothing but banana. don't buy it more than once."
"O: Not the best BIPA I've had so I marked it down a bit, but a solid offering. Definitely worth a few pints."
"Overall a complex and interesting blend of flavors. A little confusing to the pallat, but a good sipper."
"o - nicely done overall though the head dissipation was disappointing. not quite on stone cali-belgi level but still good."
"Overall, this has some good qualities but I feel this is a miss. This guy satisfies a hop craving but lacks some overall depth and cleanliness."
"M: Smooth medium bodied with a mild amount of carbonation."
"One of the first of Terrapin's beers I've tried and am pretty happy with it and will likely try some of their other brews in the future. Bought two and will likely cellar one for a year or two and give it another review."
"O: Pretty good, would have preferred it to have a little more hop up front, but I guess the belgian drinkers who bought this would prefer it this way."
"The look of this beer I found to be very impressive the color and head looked very nice. There was even some pretty good lacing too. The smell of the beer has some sweet grains on the nose with a bit of hops in there. The taste of the beer was hoppyat first then it settled into a light wheat style aftertaste. It was a little yeasty I thought. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad, it kept me interested. Overall it wasn't a bad brew, pretty good for a one off brew."
"O: A very good (not exceptional). This is an IPA that traces its roots back to to Belgian-style Tripel."
"Pours somewhere between gold and amber. Very thin head, minimal lacing. Smell is odd to me for an IPA. I get a grapey, kinda cheap champagne smell above everything else on the nose. Same thing on the taste. Kinda sour. Hops are not on top to my taste. Sweet/sour with an alcohol bite. I'll avoid this one in the future."
"12 ounce bottles newly released I'm guessing due to the new Terrapin green caps with the turtle bursting through. This label shows a horse back riding, leute playing terrapin. Aroma has strong tropical accents with citrus hops shining bright, a bit of alcohol present and spicy Belgian yeast notes. Flavor is a clash between American hops alcohol and Beligan yeast a bit of a cluster you know what I'm trying to say. Mouthfeel can be cloying because of the same tug of war I'm talking about, hot alcohol in the finish a bit of resinous hops and spices that coat the palate. Even carbonation medium bodied but I wouldn't call the experience smooth, overall I'm surprised they chose to mass produce this beer I'm still waiting for another Imperial Pils...btw their new limited release 22 oz bottles is a pun on Indian Jones."
"Overall a pretty good Belgian IPA. Not quite hoppy enough for me but it's good."
"Overall, nothing spectacular in this beer. Wouldn't reach for it again, as there's plenty of better options out there."
"Monk's Revenge has a medium body, but the attenuation is all off (as I suspected from the appearance). No lush mouthfeel. It's not quite flat, but it approaches flat. Overall, this is not a good example of the style at all. It's a melange of American and Belgian flavors that doesn't develop into anything cohesive or even tasty."
"Another one from Red Dog Wine and Spirits in Franklin, TN. Poured a medium reddish/orange color with a healthy four finger yellowish white head when poured vigorously into a shaker pint glass. Primary aroma is of bananas and peppery notes. Some other complexities are noticable, but not discernable to my nose. Taste is more bitter with banana again present, some spice as well. Feel is very crisp, spicy, and has a medium carbonation level. Not much oiliness, and light bodied. Very enjoyable beer, a little different from some of the other Belgian IPA's I have had, but very enjoyable still. This offering from Terrapin stands up well in comparison."
"O-for me, its another miss from Terrapin, but i'll keep giving them chances. as far as belgian IPAs go, this is just way too unbalanced. the belgian malts seems to be fake. its not easy drinking either. really nothing too great going on here."
"Taste is fairly sweet, balances the hops quite nicely. A bit of spice, mixed with a tiny bit of malt, highlight is the light sugar on the palate. Body is medium, and goes down smoothly with little carbonation. Overall a unique and good brew."
"This beer was an exceptional brew. I smelled it in the bottle when I first took off the cap and I got some belgian spice. Then when I poured it into a pint glass I got a distinct double IPA smell. It was very interesting how the smells changed. The taste itself is of a double IPA with some belgian spice and it is extremely tasty. I am drinking this straight out of the fridge so I can only assume it will get better as it warms. The mouthfeel is great and overall this is a terrific beer and it is highly recommended."
"Light to medium mouthfeel with only a hint of alcohol presence. Not entirely sure it fits to style, but a solid brew overall."
"Overall: This is a great example of the style; both styles are equally represented and balanced very well. Could definatly drink another."
"Clear golden in body with marshmallow head on top that leaves lacing. Aromatic: bubblegum, citrus, belgian candy, floral. Full flavor: citrus with the skin, bubblegum, mango, kiwi, belgian candy, booze and tang, slight hop resin leads back into sweet hop tang to finish the drink. Medium body with light carbonation. A slow sipper. Powerful, elegant, sweet in the best possible way."
"D: If I'm going strictly by style, this isn't close. Other Belgian IPAs are more of a hoppy characteristic. That being said, I rather enjoyed this beer. Would call it a hoppy triple, similar to Pretty Things Fluffy White Rabbits. Glad to have finally tried it"
"D - Very nice beer all the way around... Not the most well balanced Belgian IPA as this one slants much more toward IPA territory, but enjoyable none the less... I have a couple more bottles and may see how this one mellows with a bit of age on it... Very is to give this one ""4"s across the board... A job well done by Terrapin and this may be my second favorite beer from them (behind Wake-n-Bake)..."
"O – Really solid all together. The ABV is felt but not overpowering. Good drinking brew here. Well worth a try and I will again."
"This is a lighter colored belgian ale. Very hoppy and full of alcohol. The hops tame the alcohol and make this beer and extremely easy drinking brew for being a 9.6%ABV. I was over welmed at how easy this beer was to drink considering how the hops practically jump out of the bottle. I actually enjoyed this beer the night that it was announced Osama Bin Laden had been killed. This will always be a special beer for me. I would order this brew or pick up a 4-pack anytime. This beer is a must for the hop heads and for anyone who loves a great brew."
"Overall, I can't stand the taste of this beer. Everything but the taste is good, but I suppose that's why you buy beer..."
"Nice light body on this one. The carbonation seems to be a little bit low, I wouldn't mind it to be a bit more lively. Beh, a little dissapointed with this one. Seems to lack IPA qualities. Such as a hop presence in the flavor. Not a bad tasting beer, but it didn't deliver what I hoped it would."
"Poured ontap into a snifter, orangish gold in color with a white head and some lacing. Aroma of belgian yeast, floral hops, citrus. Taste is pretty straight forward, belgian yeast lending a peppery note. Some earthy hops adds flavors of pine, rind and a residual bitterness. White pepper and a dry coriander spice. Medium bodied feel, nice and clean. Overall a solid Belgian/American brew."
"O: It was a pretty good beer I have a couple more in my fridge to drink on some warm nights. I am not going to drive all over NC looking for them but if I went to a bar and saw it on tap I would order another one."
"Poured into a goblet. The color is clear amber/copper. Not a lot of head and much in terms of lacing. The aroma is slightly winey. There are esthers of dried fruits. The flavor follows in with the taste. The alcohol is not over powering, but it certainly is noticeable. The body is on the thinner side as compared to our American style. The hops give off more of a drying effect than anythig else. Not bad for the style and probably more in the mold of what I want a Belgian IPA to taste like, but probably a style I need to experiment more with."
"Overall - It's tasty. Quite tasty, in fact. Distinctly Belgian in flavor, but I hesitate to call it an IPA. Maybe just a strong Belgian pale ale."
"This beer definitely packs a punch and you can feel it after just a few drinks. I like what they were going for with the hops but the abv makes it too much to handle. Glad to say that I've tried it but I think one is enough for me."
"O- Though the score isn't bad for this beer with all the reviews, I did see quite a few recent ones of people really hating on this beer. I thought it was really great. I liked the balance of flavors from the two styles; but they could have been a little more pronounced. Overall, I would drink this again, but I hope some northern people enjoy this at DLD when I share a few bottles"
"Overall a pleasant take on the Belgian IPA style though this particular bottle might be suffering from some age which seems evident by a faded hop character."
"O: Overall, a pretty good Belgian IPA. I wish the hop flavors were a bit more pronounced, but it at least avoids the metallic flavors in many American versions of the style."
"O--If I had not known this was a Belgian IPA, I would have assumed it was some other style of Belgian beer. I don't detect the hops enough to consider it an IPA. I have drank 2 of the 4-pack at this point, but I think I'm going to throw the other two into the cellar and see what some age does to this beer. Right now I think it's a little uneven."
"Got a nice 1 finger head on the pour but the coloring of the body is fairly weak. Very light orange almost the shade of a pilsner which is not a good look for an IPA. Smell is very juicy sweet pineapple with the expected belgian yeast twang of clove and banana. Also slightly peppery. Nice sharp bitterness upfront. Muddled with a twist of pineapple but any other flavor is kind of muted. Has a peppery aftertaste. Carbonation works nicely and not overdone. Despite rating taste average I do enjoy this beer all around. Hopefully it will open up more when it warms. I prefer Raging Bitch."
"O: Pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content and its presence in both taste and smell. I'm setting one aside to cellar for a year or so to see if it'll mellow out a bit. If you're looking for a Belgian style IPA, Monk's Revenge would be a good one to seek out."
"O- Good interesting style from a great brewer. Nothing bad from here."
"D - Pretty good for such a high ABV beer. I could put down 2 and feel damn good about it. I 1st had this beer at the brewery back in 09 when it was released as a side project. It quickly became a favorite of mine and I go to the store the 1st day it is released each year to pick up a 4 pack of this awesome brew. A rite of spring...Monk's Revenge!"
"O: I've been disappointed with the last few Terrapin beers that I've tasted. However, when they're on, they're REALLY on! Tasty stuff..."
"D - Another graceful dive into the IPA realm for Terrapin with this one. I really enjoy the uniqueness of the Belgian variant (not my first Belgian IPA but I have them infrequently enough to make me forget about them from time to time). I really enjoyed Monk's Revenge. Big thanks to gford217 for sending this guy my way!"
"This is perhaps by favorite Belgian IPA. It's not super hop-forward, but I feel like it puts together a pretty nice blend of flavors. I wish the alcohol was masked a bit better -- but I guess it's acceptable for a nearly 10% beer. While it's a pleasure to drink, it's also absolutely gorgeous to look at in the glass."
"D- Medium carbonation, some sweetness, but a nice balanced beer. Very drinkable."
"O: Meh. Definitely not a favorite in either style or combined styles. Good attempt I guess. I won't be looking to try another anytime soon even though I have one in the fridge."
"The mouth feel is medium; not too bubbly, thick or thin. Overall, not terrible but not great either. A more hoppy presence would have helped me along here."
"I believe Terrapin achieved exactly what they were aiming for: sweet, malty notes of a tripple with a nice hop balance of an IPA. which brings me to my dilemma: they achieved desired results but I don't really care for the mix. oh well, glad i tried it."
"and this is the first to really push me to review. I Loved it"
"Drinkability is ok. Definitely an interesting beer. Not the best I've had of the style but not the worst. Probably a one and done. Not a beer I would seek out again unless it was really fresh."
"Very easy to drink considering the alcohol content. I liked the 2nd glass better. It's not as good as the Hercules, but it's worthy, a good drinker."
"D - No thanks but I applaud the effort."
"I enjoyed this beer but I'm not sure if the two styles present in it every really married."
"The 12 oz bottle produced a two finger worth of billowy white head sitting on top of a hazy amber orange brew. I got some Belgian yeast coming from the nose with a nice hop aroma. Sweet citrus and pine sums it up the nose well. The flavor is more of the nose being sweet and bitter it is really well balanced. The mouthfeel is medium with ample carbonation for the style. The only drawback was a slight alcohol heat that would keep this from being something I would drink mass quantities of other than that I enjoyed the brew and would gladly drink it again"
"Drink: This improves as it warms and, while not especially good, is decent. Maybe this is older, who can tell without bottle dating, but for a DIPA/Tripel, there is some missing elements here."
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable. I was expecting a completely different beer that what I got, but it's fairly drinkable for what it turned out to be. I'd probably drink a lot more of this beer if it was distributed locally, and that's saying enough right there."
"D: Good. I would definitely get this again, though it may not be might top choice. Well rounded though I would like there to be a little more emphasis on the belgian side."
"D: Overall this is the best BIPA I've ever tried. If they all tasted like this I would have a lot more love for the style."
"Overall, I'm starting to feel that Terrapin just isn't my bag. As Principal Skinner once said...""Prove me wrong children. Prove me wrong!"""
"Like others have said, this came a bit more like a DIPA/Tripel hybrid than a traditional Belgian IPA. While it lacked some complexity, this still stayed fairly interesting and drank VERY nicely for the size of it. Another solid Terrapin entry."
"Pours yellow-orange with a nice white head. Nose is nice with a lot of spice and a bit of fruit. Really good amount of floral, citrus, and herbal hops. The taste is hoppy but not too bitter with a good deal of spice. Medium feel with some alcohol. A nice example of a (luckily) increasingly-common style."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber, with a descent head. Smells of flowery hops and that unmistakable belgian funk. Taste is very satisfying. Tastes like a mediocre tripel, with an interesting, and distinct hops finish. The hops firm up and define the broadly, beglian base, giving it a crisp finish. The finish is helped by a bubbly carbonation that helps to make this otherwise heavy beer lighter and more drinkable. Not bad at all. Maybe not quite as good as La Chouffe's Beglian IPA, but well worth a purchase."
"There is nothing in the taste of this beer that would lead you to think it was 9.6%abv. Remarkably drinkable with a light, crisp body, though slightly undercarbonated."
"This one didn't do too much for me, I just found the taste to bee too messy and piney. Sad, as the nose really showed promise."
"This is an excellent blend of two great styles."
"Notes: One of my first Terrapins and one of the few ""Imperial"" Belgium IPA I've tried. As a brew it is quality, as a take on BIPAs... I dunno, the tripel side is more accentuated here with the malty range instead of being hop prone, which is fine, but may not be that close to my preferences. Others tasting next to me, and with quite a different palate, are liking it, although they complain about the forward alcoholic sense..."
"Very nice original taste. Definitely closer to a Tripel than just a regular Belgian IPA."
"(D)- An interesting combo. An IPA, yet a tripel at the same time. It tries to be both at the same time, but it just does not quite mesh together completely somehow."
"D - This american version leaned more towards the Belgian side but it did have a nice addition of hops at the end...I like seeing Terrapin taking their side projects and making them seasonal 12oz. releases"
"D: This is the kind of revenge I will always look forward to."
"Poured aggressively into the tulip, only yielding about a finger and a bit of bright white head. Solid layer of retention on here, no lace. Aroma is a blast of bright citrus hops, more on the tropical spectrum with some pine involved. Pineapple/peach predominantly and potentially some green apple, with a bit of Belgian yeast faintly and alcohol as it warms. Bitter and citrusy upfront, different fruit comes out here, of a more lemon/orange scope but fades into a wash of alcohol and the Belgian yeast again. As another reviewer wrote, it comes across like a hybrid DIPA and tripel which I think comes close to this. A bit fuller in the mouthfeel, with medium-high carbonation. More of a sipper I thought this one was, but quite nice when warmed up some more."
"D: Kind of a strange brew. Not something I'm likely to pickup again but interesting none the less."
"D - Not particularly great, not a bad beer, but not something to open up if you're thirsty."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a small dry yeasty and Belgian like sugar and a grapefruity citrus hop. In the taste, grapefruity hops and a thin malt backing. A small bite and medium to light mouthfeel, with a semi dry citrus aftertaste. Nice big hops, Belgian like, but a bit thin."
"D - For a nearly 10% beer, I'm supposed to say Low, but I could have these until I blacked out. A real possibility with this beverage I'm afraid."
"I hadn't reviewed a Belgian IPA in a while, this really reminded me why I like the style so much. The nose is pretty awesome, that play of hops & Belgian yeast really does it for me. A bit overwhelming at first from alcohol, fortunately it simmered down a bit. Tasty brew."
"SkÅL!"
"-this beer is weird, but i dont dislike it. definitely has an identity crisis, but i wouldnt turn down more"
"I got to try this recently thanks to a friend and it was interesting. Not quite spicy or funky but definitely belgian. It was orange and had a smell of hops but also something I could not lay my finger on. The taste was the same way. It was neither belgian, belgian-style, IPA, or DIPA, it was weird. It was however good as I find most Terrapin beers to be solid."
"I don't like the look on that turtle's face... This brew pours a slightly hazy golden amber topped by a finger or so of off-white foam. The nose is loaded with pine resin and grapefruit, hops galore. A dark honey hides in the background. The taste follows closely, heavier on the honey, but with plenty of hoppy pine and grapefruit to go around. Some banana, clove, and flowers are swirled around in the maelstrom as well. The body is a light medium, with an active carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a solid brew, an interesting mix of DIPA and tripel."
"D: Good. I would definitely get this again, though it may not be might top choice. Well rounded though I would like there to be a little more emphasis on the belgian side."
"Pours hazy golden with a slight, tight head. Aroma is light and phenolic, with a little fruity apricot. Flavor is phenolic and bitter, with pear, apricot, bitter apple and a whiff of butterscotch. The finish is cidery and bitter with a little sour. Mouthfeel is prickly."
"D: Smoother than some of the other American-built Belgian IPAs (see Raging Bitch and Cali-Belgique), and I think it works a little better to have a bigger malt presence. Nice job Terrapin."
"What an odd critter this is; certainly an interesting amalgamation of styles. In some ways it reminds me of Captain Lawrence Xtra Gold more than, say, Piraat. It drinks well considering the abv."
"likely my favorite terrapin to date - and happy to see no evidence of the earthy hops used in terrapin gamma ray."
"While I believe I might prefer either a traditional Belgian or a tradition American style DIPA, Monk's Revenge is an interesting experiment in flavor combinations. I can't say I found it overly drinkable, however I am glad I tried it and it makes an excellent sipper as you puzzle out the flavors which are either hit you in the face strong or quite subtly elusive."
"Wow. Very surprised to see this is 9.6%. Also surprised to see it is an IPA. While the hops were there to begin with, they faded quickly. My first thoughts were IPA when I smelled it out of the bottle, but changed that as soon as I started smelling and tasting the beer."
"Drinkability: Its a good tasting beer, but more on the Belgian side, and less on the IPA side. Maybe its a little too old (but it cant be more than 7 months-- not sure when it came out), but the hops seem muted. Overall a good beer. I like Belgians, I like IPAs-- cant go wrong."
"Drinkability -- I don't know if I would say that this is one of my favorites of the style, but it was certainly a pleasant experience. If you can come by it, there's really no reason not to give this a try. Your mileage may vary."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable for a heady brew that clocks in at just below 10% abv. I like that the tripel shines a bit more than the DIPA here, a sweeter and spicier version, very likable. Won't make me forget my all-time favorite 'Belgian IPA' (that would be Achouffe's 'Houblon Chouffe'), but this is plenty good and worthy of a recommendation. Thanks again, Jeff."
"D: Wow. I have to say that I have enjoyed this belgian IPA. To this point, I haven't had a bad beer from Terrapin."
"D - I'd need a few more to really say. It's got a lot going on and I'm still a bit up in the air on this one."
"Notes: Good beer in general, but don't expect the hops to dazzle you."
"D - A tasty IPA and the belgian yeast is a bit more dominant than the hops, but flavors are well developed. The taste has a low alcohol influence in the taste, but at 9.6% it is a beer that is good for sharing"
"Drinkability: I was expecting a bit more flavor with this one, especially with the high ABV. It's a decent tasting brew, don't get me wrong...but there are some better ones out there. I'd say it's worth a try if you can snag it, but don't bust a nut trying to score a bottle."
"M/D - very easy to drink, nicely carbonated, very tasty with just a bit of hop bitterness"
"Overall, a decent belgian ipa but nothing special. I wouldn't turn down, but not one to seek out."
"Drinakability: Plenty of the Belgian traits I love so much here."
"Overall, very drinkable for the style. My pour didn't last too long. Glad I could try this one. A very nice blend of flavors."
"As I said before this isn't the most complex or interesting Belgian IPA out there but it's a nice beer with some good American hop qualities. I like the citrus with the Belgian yeast strain, which imparts some good qualities without dominating the beer. A nice beer from Terrapin, which rarely disappoints my palate."
"Notes: This is a solid beer. Definitely an american creation in the field of Belgian IPA's. I've had a few Belgian versions and there are much more subtle, this however shows the power of american hops. Terrapin is never afraid to use a heavy hand when it comes to hops and this is no exception. While it isn't the best I've had it certainly holds its own."
"D - Good, somewhat as advertised; a hybrid BIPA/DIPA."
"M/D - Medium body with a semi-dry and tart finish. Volumes of carbonation where they should be for this style and no hint of the high alcohol. Very nice sweet aftertaste makes it an easy drinker and the transition of flavors give it a good drinkability."
"This is good, good stuff. One of my favorite beers by these southern bad boys."
"Hides the abv very well. I get a faint alcohol burn midway through the glass. Dangerous, since there is no real indication this one clocks in as high as it does."
"D-this is a nicely balanced belgian ipa with a strong hefe presence. not hugely hoppy but definitely makes a presence and hides the huge abv very well."
"Beer is strong and sweet up front with a nicely bitter and not dry finish. Its pretty smooth in the mouth but overall there's something about the hops that aren't working for me. All the flavors are there they just are merged into a single thought. Overall its a pretty good beer and Belgian IPAs are usually a mixed bag. This was is above average."
"D: Drinkable, but not what I'd call the best example of a Belgian IPA."
"Cloudy orange in color. Aroma is banana & clove yeastiness and perhaps the slightest hint of hops. First impression on the flavor is that despite the aroma, the flavor skews ridiculously bitter and boozy. Very hot. The bitterness overwhelms the rest of the flavors. As it warmed, it became a little more balanced, but it was still a bit of a palate burner. I think it needs a year or two to mellow. Not totally sure how I feel about this one."
"All in all this is OK, but I feel like the various elements are fighting with one another and its finishes with a strange unsettling aftertaste... not really a huge fan."
"D: As far as flavor goes this is a tasty beer, although I am sure after 2 or 3 you will lose the taste of it (or anything for that matter) due to its high ABV. This beer is best drank in moderation."
"This beer is now being offered as a regular series instead of a side project here in Atl. What can I say....I haven't met a terrapin that I Haven't likes and this beer is no different. I got to try this beer on tap at a local beer festival and was overjoyed at the hoppiness of this IPA. Great taste...great feel...great drinkability...what more can I say...I'll be stocking my fridge with some."
"Drinkability is moderate. It is a tasty beer with a nice feel, but that 9%+ ABV isn't hiding anywhere."
"Downright drinkable, despite its hefty alcohol content, which is virtually undetectable. Well-balanced, full of flavor yet infinitely easy-drinking, this has got to be one of Terrapin's greatest offerings. No wonder they brought it into regular rotation. This is too good to remain a one-off."
"This is a pretty strong beer and I would stop at one."
"I'd recommend this, which is now available in four packs"
"D - Despite the high alcohol content, I really enjoyed sipping this beer. Very well balanced in flavor and body and you get the best of all worlds of bold citrus hops and fruity Belgian yeast and spicy alcohol."
"O: I think that this is a good belgian beer. Very drinkable and I love the creamy texture, but I believe it to be lacking in the IPA part to consider it a Belgian IPA. My only suggestion would be to add to the hop aroma and flavor to bump it up. If these areas were improved, I would bump my rating up to the 4 range."
"A really good beer."
"Drinkability? The abv is not hidden all that well but it's drinkable enough for a 12oz serving. This is a pretty good effort."
"Drinkability is good although the high alcohol content adds some limits. Wouldn't be my first choice to quell hop head cravings but the mix of flavors really works well and makes this a very enjoyable drink."
"Drinks more like a Belgian Tripel than an IPA. No major American IPA flavors are detectable. Overall a good beer though and the rating would be higher if this wasn't marketed as an IPA."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, I really enjoyed the melding of the flavors. They did a very nice job of really integrating and balancing all the flavors. I would say the flavors lean more towards the Belgian side but the hoppy flavors came through nicely in the taste as well."
"Got this one in the bottle as well. Terrapin is one of my all time favorite brewerys and they continue to amaze here. I am a recent convert to IPA style brews, and have been a long time Belgian lover. So one can imagine me initial excitement over this. The color is a deep rich golden brown. Almost like a good quality honey. The smell is lacking a bit, but that may be because it is only hop...NOTHING else. However, as soon as you taste 'er the smell will seem like nothing. I good hop flavor like a common IPA, but the after taste is the winner. This one gives you that sweet Belgian pop there at the end. There is a little heat to it, but that's just how you know its good."
"D- I'd say this one is one hell of a drinker with IPA flavors but a smooth Belgian influence. Have a few you will too, be under the influence as well. Cheers!!!"
"Overall, this isn't a palate wrecker by any means, but rather a beautifully integrated beer that really goes beyond both ""genres", avoiding the cliches that happen with many of this style. One of the best Belgian IPA's I've had."
"Pours a mostly clear medium orange with thin offwhite head, spotty lace. Smell: I'm getting a whole lot of sweet pale malt with a little must and some subdued melon and herbal hop. I'd like a more 'crisp' hop presence. Taste: hops make more impact here: herbal, with a lemony edge. A hint of cantaloupe, sweet pale malt, and again a little mustiness. Some kick from the abv. Dry, sweet finish. I think it's reasonably true to the idea of a tripel + ipa combo, for an American craft take at least, but it's not particularly exciting."
"M/D: Medium bodied, medium carb. Easily quaffable, an enjoyable brew solo or with a meal."
"Poured into my DFH Signature glass. Pours a nice looking red-orange, with a large white head that quickly shrinks, but does not disappear, leaving behind plenty of lacing. The smell is a wonderfull combination of belgian spice/sweetness and piney hops. Taste mirrors the nose, but is a bit heavy on the hop bitterness. The beer is nicely carbonated, and has a nice fullness to it. I enjoyed this batch of Monk's Revenge, but enjoyed the original batch with a few months of age on it even more."
"T: The hops are a little less apparent in the taste, but they are definitely there. The Belgian side stands out more in the taste. The front of the sip shows the hops, but it quickly converts to a sweet malt presence. This is a nice balance between an American style and a Belgian style. The mouthfeel is balanced perfectly for this hybrid style."
"So drinkable, so delicious, Terrapin is really cranking out some great beers."
"Overall I'm not sure this flavor profile would have worked as well in any other medium than a cask. Definitely different than the SP profile, I'll be interested to see how the bottles/taps of this version turn out."
"Overall, one of my favorite brews from Terrepin so far."
"Overall not my favorite version of the style I have ever had, but I think it works. I would have no issue with trying this one again, especially with a little bit of age put on it. Might bring it into the great category."
"Drinks very well- a light malt caramel keeps the hops smooth- and no bite."
"Monk's Revenge is one of Terrapin's best beers to date and surely one of the best Belgian IPAs I've had. Recommended."
"Nice medium body is thick but not quite chewy... almost though. The small amount of head is not indicatve of the carbonation level... this thing is creamy smooth with loads of fine bubbles. Very nice and easily drinkable. Although this is a beer where I honestly would say ""One is enough."" There is a lot going on in this one, and the ABV is over 9%... So maybe one of these... followed by a nice sessionable >4% brew... Or, in tonight's case, one of these, followed by bedtime."
"Drinkability is low overall, decent for the style. The alcohol taste is too strong IMO. Definitely would not session these."
"Overall, a solid brew. Not world class, but certainly worth a try."
"Overall it started very nice, beautiful aroma, and the taste was pretty good. They kept the hops lower and really nice on the nose. However, the sweetness and boozy taste is way to high. Just for a Belgian Pale its more like a tripel with some light hops, and as the nose was perfect with hops the taste was a little lacking. The really late finishing dry hops add a really nice touch. If only the booze wasn't so high."
"Has a rich, fruity, hoppy aroma that demands at least a taste. It pours a light clear coppery orange with a fairly thick and fluffy buttery off-white head. Flavor is quite hoppy yet minimally bitter, and has a firm fruity overtone, mainly apple with hints of banana and grapefruit. Texture is edgy, fizzy and lively, nipping at the tongue. Another winner from Terrapin!"
"Bottle pours a nice amber / orange color with a crisp white 1/4 inch head and some light lacing. The aroma is a mix of citrusy and earthy hops crossed with what seams like a very saison style yeast (dupont?). Fruity flavors up front with a nice malty body. A well balanced tasting beer. The fruity flavors are followed by some hop bitterness and then finish with more bitter hops and a little astringency actually. For the style, for me, could be a bit maltier to balance the hops and strong yeast flavor and aroma. But the carbonation is good and has a medium to medium full mouth feel. I am very happy to have tasted this beer and enjoyed it a good bit. It is to bad terrapin is tough to come by up here, I'd buy their beers for sure!"
"This is a perfect session beer @ 9.6abv!!!! Perfect lake beer in GA."
"Poured a light gold with good carbonation and a nice white head. Nose is fruit, hops, belgian yeast. Taste is more of a dubbel than a IPA to me. Lots of apples, and other fruiits, light dose of hops, tinge of booze. Drinkable indeed but needed a bit more hops to it for it to be an IPA."
"single from Sam's, Durham"
"The flavor rips into my tongue. The hop profile in this is amazingly tasty, all the things I love but the sourdough funk in the malt is much bigger in the flavor rather than the nose. This being said it's not too overwhelming as the hops do much to balance these flavors. Overall even more hops, IMO, would improve this beer, but that being said this is a tasty a different brew that's easy to drink despite is ABV and I really want this on tap."
"Very smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable for nearly 10 percent!"
"Decent stuff overall, not amazing but enjoyable. Drinkability is good."
"12oz bottle from the new Monster Tour release pours a nice copper color, with a thin white head that doesn't retain particularly well. The aroma has some citrusy American hops upfront, followed by some belgian yeast type fruitiness, candy sugar and fusel alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with piney and citrusy hops initially, followed by a yeasty and fruity taste, some cane sugar, and a nice dose of fusel alcohol. The mouthfeel is full and oily, and drinkability is really limited by the alcohol presence. Decent attempt at a Belgian IPA, but pales in comparison to Raging Bitch."
"Drinkability is alright as well. This isn't a bad Belgian IPA, just a mediocre one."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer that would be better without the fusel alcohol; the balance works well"
"Monk's Revenge Belgian Style Double India Pale Ale (Vol. 5) is a little better than Gamma Ray Wheat Wine (Vol. 3) and is much better than either RoggenRauchBier (Vol. 2) or Dos Cocoas Chocolate Porter (Vol. 4). I'm still waiting for the Side Project beer that will blow the doors off the joint, but this one is worth a purchase if you can find it. Thank you to Rbald42 for the bomber."
"4/3.5/3.5/4/4"
"Bruisin' Ales bomber. Pours lasting white head onto medium yellow body. Carbonation bubbles. Fresh yeast aroma. A Belgian ale, backed by sufficient hops to keep it from going to the sweet side. Very drinkable.Above average mouthfeel.Good balnce, alcholol well hidden."
"D - While I think I should have consumed this a few months back, the hop character remained well represented in this Belgian-style DIPA, resulting in a fine example of the style."
"Drinkability: An interesting stab at the style, though lacking many of that style's (one of my favorites) hallmarks. That is, it has most of the elements of a Belgian IPA, a few extra that probably shouldn't be here (though the American hop addition was a nice touch, and I suppose in a style as eclectic and Chimeric as this, what really shouldn't belong?), an unfortunate chemical alcohol note, and a few notes that are a little too hollow. It also gave me one hell of a hangover, though I wrote this review long before that, heh. Again, worth a try, but not worth much more."
"Body and carbonation are medium. ABV is slightly noticeable in the finish, inducing a bit of a recoil. Not nearly as enjoyable as Cali-Belgique."
"Not really my favorite from these guys but its a nice beer."
"Final Note: I had this at about 9 months after it's release date and while it may have lost some of the hop blast it once had it was an overall very tasty beer that I totally enjoyed."
"Thanks Casey!"
"Drinkability - wow, 9.8%? I don't taste it, but I do feel it. Great campfire beer."
"Moderate to high carbonation, a little filling once it goes down but has a clean and refreshing finish."
"Good drinkability. Glad to have had a chance to try it. Wouldn't seek it out though."
"Drinkability: Thanks to Terrapin, I know what a DIPA would more than likely taste like if it originated in Belgium and not sunny SoCal. If you you ever want to try a IPA with a unique twist to it, then grab a bottle of Volume 5."
"Monk's Revenge is a solid, good Belgian IPA. It's not good enough to compete with the elites of the style, but it's in the thick of the second tier. It'd be a little better if a couple of abv points were shaved. I think that would tone down some warmth and the medicinal flavors. It might also allow the Belgian yeast flavor to shine more. Nice release from Terrapin nonetheless. Definitely worth checking out. Thanks, Dan."
"D-Really nice. A well done Belgian IPA. For a style that has quickly become one of my favorites this one certainly stands out."
"drinkability: awesome beer and one of Terrapins best. Wish this was a regular or atleast makes a repeat."
"Just a hair less for drinkability. For me, it was just a tad too floral. Not as much as a Fraoch, where you expect it... but this was just more than I wanted."
"The taste is sharp at first and the high abv does linger for a bit. It's got a decent amount of bitterness although it's not too strong. The Belgian Tripel side of this is really coming thorough. Very sold for the style."
"Drinkability: At 9.8% (not listed on the bottle, almost surprised when I saw the ABV) it was pretty drinkable, but almost too sweet to really enjoy much more than I had. Still, a very interesting and fun IPA for the evening and a cool take on a relatively unpopular style."
"I had this beer very shortly after it came out, and it was good but a little boozy and overly bitter. I have to say that it's really reaching its peak now. Too bad there's not much left anywhere (the one bottle I have left is the only one I know how to find)."
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow. Good lord the smell. Oranges and hops. Overpowering and almost unpleasant when I bring my nose to the top of the glass. The taste is about how it smells. I'm splitting a bomber with other BA's and they are going apeshit for it. I really don't see it. The orange and hops seem to ofset each other in a bad way. Overall it reminds me of a more drinkable version of past-date orange juice. A fantastic extra in trade though and I'm glad I got to try it. One of these days I know Terrapin will have something that I enjoy. I can't grade this too low because it is not really an unpleasant. Just a little overpowering."
"This is a combination of two of my favorite styles and it is excellent. All the good tastes of a Belgian with the hops of an IPA. I love it."
"M/D - Fantastic, couldn't improve it. That is all."
"M/D - Medium bodied with average carbonation. Very easy drinking. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming."
"HV"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated, dry, and astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. The beer commences a brutal assault on the palate. HOLY MOLY. This is cross between a Belgian Pale and DIPA. This has a ton going for it. I don't what else to say, except WOW!"
"smells sweet and floral. Hops, bread, orange, honey, sugar, spice, and fruits. tastes sweet. very bready and candy like. contrasting sweet malts and bitterness. so many levels of different tastes mixed together into an awesome beer. medium body with decent carbonation. very enjoyable beer. More then happy to put out an above ""rAvg"" score for this beer."
"Overall - A disappointing beer, there are better Belgian IPAs out there IMO. Try Green Flash's Le Freak."
"I must be getting sick of reviewing beer or I must like this one quite a bit, 'cause I don't feel like babbling about it anymore - I just want to drink it and enjoy it, 'cause it's good. This is another synergy beer - the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. Whatever you call it...drinkability or ""overall impression," it's very good stuff."
"As for overall drinkability, this is great. With a high abv and a belgian/white/ipa flavor, this is perfect for sundown and beyond during the autumn. After a long hike, while you light the fire, pour one of these for yourself and enjoy."
"Overall its an interesting mix of US hoppy IPA with Belgian Tripel, the hops are balanced with the sweet malts and yeasts. A little less complex and interesting than I had hoped but its a really nice warm weather refreshing beer but with a wallop."
"The more I drank this beer the more I liked it and I would lend my voice to others calling for Terrapin to release this brew on a regular basis."
"Pours and almost clear golden red with some pink hues around the edges. A little over one finger of dirty white head slowly wisps away and leaves a few broken lines of lace behind. Subtle floral hops are accentuated with some sweet malts and bread; thus the ""Belgian Style"" I suppose. An estery essence works itself into the aromas, adding complexity, and putting a pleasant finish to the aromatic experience. Tastes of citrusy hops which are immediately subdued by a mixture of sweet malts and phenols. A good alcohol heat hits the back of the throat and a another bite of bitterness is also felt. Goes down fairly smooth, although the lingering alcohol heat might detract somewhat, but doesn't bother initially, although eventually, after finishing the first glass, makes you understand who's the boss. Mouth-feel is medium to heavy in nature, and there's a decent amount of carbonation. This is a very nice change from the American hop bombs we're all so used to."
"The beer had a medium to full body, perhaps a little too thick for my taste, but still good. The beer had a nice bitter dry aftertaste and was well carbonated. The beer was fairly easy to drink give the ABV, but after the 22oz, I was pretty well done. Overall, a good beer and probably the first one of the side projects that I think the brewery should consider brewing on a regular basis."
"Not really my favorite from these guys but its a nice beer."
"Definitely an enjoyable brew, of course I seem to have developed quite a taste for a solid mix of Belgian yeast derived flavors and aggressive hops. I could definitely see this as being a touch harsh in its mix of phenolics and hops for some people, but I can't get enough."
"Thanks to psycohops for sharing this one. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into a pair of standard shaker glasses. Appears a hazed, muted straw yellow color with a very thin layer of quickly fading bone white foam. Nose and flavor consist of candi sugar, grapefruit, bread, bubblegum, sweet and tart, a bit spicy, crisp apples. A notch better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Thanks for the chance to try this Bob."
"M + D: It's got a surprisingly full body... big, almost a little too thick, honestly, but good. A nice carbonation keeps it from being sticky or overbearing. A nice, easy sipper and certainly good when split with others."
"Decent enough beer. Like the friend you really like but he just talks too damn much, or has that distracting third eye on his cheek. Eventually it kills the relationship."
"Pours a hazy golden pale amber color with a full finger wispy white head that fades quickly. A reasonable amount of Belgian lacing present. The smell is good but on the subtle side; earthy Belgian yeast. lemon and harvest fruit aromas...like a nice strong pale ale Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, creamy and tangy with hops. Full flavored, earthy Belgian yeast, harvest fruits and hints of lemon. The experience cleans up quickly, on the dry side. Very drinkable yet Big on ABV; integrated nicely. Well done, had tons of fun with this one!"
"Nicely drinkable. A pretty refreshing beer. Does not reach greatness, but a good effort from Terrapin. They always do a nice job."
"Terrapin makes some good beer, I've sampled a couple of these Side Projects and they seemed to miss slightly in each case. Don't get me wrong, they're still good, just a little off base. Thanks for the generosity, Rusty!"
"D - This is a very good Belgian IPA. I hope to find more Terrapin brews in the near future."
"Doesn't measure up to the better Belgian IPAs, but an interesting effort."
"D- This was an extremely interesting brew to wrap your head around. It definitely isn't an everyday beer but if you are looking to enjoy something new and different pick up a bottle and you won't be disappointed."
"OK drinkability. This one just didn't impress me all that much."
"Drinkability is ok while its not bad its not something i would run out and repurchase. Not a great triple or a great IPA but hell worth a try. Thanks got to merlin48 for sharing this one with me."
"Appears a cloudy amber with a short white head. The aroma is a mix of Belgian fruit esters and hoppy citrus. There's a bit of bitter bite and pine hop at the finish with a bigger grapefruit hop flavor, pepper, vanilla candy, and dark bread crust taste. It's a great mix of flavors, but the beer is missing the deep, subtle complexities of a great Belgian. I will give it credit that for it's strength, this beer is very, very drinkable."
"Poured in to my DFH Snifter and poured a clear gold amber. The head really took some elbow grease to work it up at all. The head forming so small reduced the strength of the aroma allot, which is sad as the aroma was lovely. The smell came mainly of fruits and then hops in the background. Was a very nice mix. The taste was something interesting as I felt it changed between Hefe and a Belgian IPA. The fruits are very strong like a hefe but the bitterness follows threw. Great mix and every now and then it mixes the order up. Mouth feel was ok but felt the warmth of the alcohol go down as I drank this particular brew. Drinkability is good but one bomber and you pretty much done. Great limited brew would pick up if I saw it again."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp and mildly bubbly. Great for a DIPA. Now the flavor on this is quite a conundrum. Right away I could taste a nice bitter hoppiness, but really that was on the first sip alone. After that this becomes a Belgian Pale Ale. That's it. I can't pull any hops from this at all. This is really a double?! Wow. What happened to the hop presence? Nothing. This is interesting, but not at all what I expected. Too Belgian, not enough DIPA."
"Aromas of floral hops, yeasty, and fruitiness. Tastes of the same fruitiness, yeast, floral hops, and lightly earthy. Some spiciness in there as well. On the sweeter side with the alcohol content pretyy much hidden."
"It's pretty drinkable and overall a fairly good beer. A little more carbonation and it would be very good. A bit more carbonation would likely also make the flavors pop a bit more."
"D- this beer is unlike any that ive had before. at first i didnt like it too much, but the flavor grew on me. this is something that i wish i could pick up again now that i know what to expect. one bomber was enough, and i didnt feel like sharing it. thanks again for the opportunity."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is low. Drinkability is good on this one. The 9.80% is felt, but it's such a balanced beer, it's easy to drink. Nothing really smacks you in the face, but it's very well done overall."
"Big thanks go out to JCB for hooking me up with this one as an extra! Pours a golden orange color with a small white head that was gone in a flash and no lacing. Aroma is light fruit and candy aroma, a bit of pineapple and floral hops, a bit of yeastiness. definite sweetness to it. I must say this has interesting mix of flavors. It's more on the Tripel side than the IPA side of things. Some hop flavor is present, mostly the floral variety, but not much in the way of bitterness. There's a solid, cracker like pale malt backbone and a nice Belgian yeastiness to it, and plenty of warm booziness. Mouthfeel is a tad thin without enough bubbly effervescence to keep things interesting. This is an interesting take on the style, but if they're going to call it an IPA, I need some more hops. Not bad though. Thanks again Jason!"
"Terrapin has just been off the mark for me so far with the side projects. With that said, I will keep giving them a shot since I like all their regular and seasonal brews."
"D: I liked it. Nice mix of Belgium and American IPA. Sweet fruit and bitter citrus."
"Pretty easy to drink if you are in to IPAs but if you are looking for something with more esters and fruit flavors you may need to let this one sit a little or look elsewhere. It is far more IPA than Belgian."
"D- Overall, this is another great Side Project beer. Keep on churning them out Terrapin, I can't wait for the next SP!"
"Very flavorful profile, probably the biggest-tasting of Terrapin's side projects yet, slightly outing their Gamma Ray wheatwine. Starts with a nice spicy Belgian yeast note that quickly gives way to raw, leafy hops and chewy Belgian malts. Finishes with a lingering booziness and hoppy bitterness. Body is relatively thick and harsh, even for a Belgian IPA, somewhat limiting the drinkability. However, the uppity carbonation level and complex finish make for an interesting drink. Terrapin's Side Projects seldom disappoint, and Monk's Revenge carries that torch well."
"D- I'm sorry I only traded for two of these and might need more soon."
"Mouthfeel is ok, the sweet/peppery aspects of the beer leave an odd feel in the mouth. Sort of like drinking orange juice after brusing your teeth, but nowhere near that bad or unpleasant. Just odd. It's still refreshing, and worth a try."
"Poured this bomber into a Duvel tulip. Clear apple juice in appearance with a solid three fingers of white frothy head. Very nice to look at in the glass...great clarity. Aroma of grapefruit peel, spearmint. Banana and clove hit on the nose. Then a good dose of hop flavor ensues. Dry and citric bitter mouthfeel. Bitter finish with lingering chalky bitterness."
"Drinkability: A sipper, partly because of the high carbonation, and partly because I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to make of this beer. I think the flavors of the hops clash a little too much with the 'belgian' flavors that make up most of the beer. Still, I'm glad I tried it."
"I picked up this bottle in Greenville SC a few weeks ago. The beer is dark yellow orange color, a little hazy, with a thin head. This has more of a spicy tripel aroma than IPA. I've had several beers of this tripel/IPA blend variety and haven't really been taken by any of them. This is turning out to be much of the same, with less IPA and more tripel in the smell and taste. Well done for what it is I guess, but not something I'd search for again."
"Pours out a deep copper color, with incredible clarity. I love watching the bubbles rise up through this one, and the head is sort of thin, about a cm, but its clingy and very pretty. A good looking beer. The smell is pleasant, but it doesn't make the style evident. There's a faint bready maltiness, with whiffs of powdery pale malts and a bit of sweetness. There's just a hint, barely a hint of earthy, spicy hops, like tobacco. Doesn't smell much like a Tripel or an IPA. The taste is very nice. I love the malty flavors, there are raisins, and sticky, very sticky bready flavors. Then the hoppy spicy flavor kicks in. I like it, there's even a hint of fruitiness in the back. But let me explain it a bit more, off the bat there's an orange flavor, like a fresh sweet Valencia orange, maybe a Clementine, this an earthy, leafy, almost like compost flavor, something like tobacco, finishes with a very spicy, like coriander, clove, citrus peel, even a bit of flower resins. The bubblegum flavor is quite nice in there too. This one is very complex, and I'm quite interested, this doesn't seem much like a combination of a Tripel and a DIPA, but like layers of both mixed in together. I really love the flavors in this. It is very full and enjoyable. Just like sticky and bready from the start, with the hop resins keeping it a little dry and clingy. But the bubblegum flavor slows me down in drinking it. It's definitely a sipper, slow drinking, but not too sweet or too dry, really fascinating and recommended. Definitely worth a shot."
"i cannot detect any alcohol at all, but i can feel it in my stomach. Two thumbs up to Terrapin. This is an amazing beer, i don't know why i like it so much but its not harsh at all full of flavour and not overtaking and warms the tummy up. mmm mmm mmm"
"The mouthfeel is decent. A little thin. I think this beer has some real potential. Perhaps six months from now it will have come together a bit more and jelled. Currently, this beer is definitely young and needs to grow up."
"All in all, a solid stab, but just not enough there to make me keep coming back."
"Pours a light golden color. There's a bit of haziness to it. Smell is peppery and spicy, with just a touch of hops and belgian yeast. Taste is even more of the spice, very well balanced with the hops. Very smooth and easy drinking. Quite surprised on how well this drank and just how balanced and smooth it was. A little bit of citrus in the finish. A very good offering from Terrapin, glad I had the chance."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Nice interpretation of what's quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. This one seems a bit yeastier than others I've tried. Carbonated well, great mouthfeel, highly drinkable. I'm loving this Side Project series..."
"A nice, relatively clear and crisp looking golden ale, a bit of bubbly head but fades. Pale malt and a dry musty hop profile, faint fumes of alcohol. A decent crisp flavor to this one, a nice dry finish, and lively on the palate, but the alcohol seems to come through a bit to much and is kind of distracting. I'm not usually too sensitive to that but it's not really working here - not really enough hop flavor in this to cover it up. Almost a wanna-be Duvel or something but more like a weak Belgian Pale than an IPA. Decent though, but I much prefer some of Terrapin's other brews."
"Mouthfeel is fuller than expected, and probably the best part of the beer. Overall not very drinkable. I'll have to try this one on tap if I see it, but for now I'm basing it off this one bottle and it is my least favorite of the series."
"Sampled through the efforts of Bentk56 and Secret Bunny 09 BIF."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with almost 2 fingers of white head. OK retention leaves some nice little lacing rings. Smells of fruits, Belgian candy, peppery spices, banana, pale malt, and white grapes. Tastes of fruits like pineapple, tangerine, melon, lemon, apple, and banana followed by some honey, sweet pale malts, and Belgian candy with a peppery spice, hoppy resin, and alcohol warmth in the finish. Medium in body with effervescent carbonation. Sweet and fruity with a nice dry bitter finish, slick with a touch of alcohol burn."
"22oz bomber into a Duvel glass at Flying Saucer. Pours a crisp pale orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice fragrant blend of fresh hops, burnt caramel and mild yeast ans spice. The taste is a nice amount of Earthy hops, sweet malt and Belgian spice. The beer is somewhat heavy with slight sticky alcohol. This one is very enjoyable, one of the best American brewed Belgian IPAs I've had yet."
"D= This was a damned interesting beer. I think I prefer the Chouffe DIPA Triple to this example, but it is still a good beer in its own right. I wish the carbonation was a bit more effervescent, and that the ""Belgian"" qualities were turned up just a bit more (or the DIPA toned down a bit) but its drinkable and worthy for sure."
"Bomber. Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a small white head, very little lacing. Aroma is a little estery with bananas and then a good amount of pine (slight resin) and citrus (grapefruit) hops. Flavor is abound with hops. There is a little bit of banana, some sweet malts, and finishes with citrus and resiny hop flavor. Mouthfeel has a tingle to it, pretty good body and a nice bitter finish. Overall a very good beer. Yet another solid Side Project from Terrapin, so far I would call this my favorite."
"I prefer pineapple/floral/pine hop notes to grapefruit, so while I think this is a good mix of Belgian and IPA, it's not the best kind of IPA for me. This is my first Belgian IPA. Color me intrigued."
"I have had only a few of beers of this style and havent been overly impressed with them,this seems to go along that line.Poured into a large tulip glass a mix og deep golden and burnt orange with a thin white head that is gone quickly leaving no lace behind as it settled very quickly.Belgian yeast aroams stand out most in the nose,slightly smokey and quite spicey with some overripe pineapple,just a hint of resiny American hop.Flavors are also more like a tripel in my mind than a dipa but its is pretty darn good.Phenolic spice flavors with some grilled pineapple flavors meld into a bit of citric hop but it never really comes thru to strong.If your a fan of say a hopped up tripel than you will be all about this,me I think its good but not anything to seek out for my taste."
"D: Good. While I would be hard pressed to put down more than a glass or two of this in a night I would have no trouble revisiting it a few times a week."
"Poured into a pint glass and split three ways. Pours a frothy amber/yellow color. Lotta lacing on the glass. Lots of booze in the nose. Both aroma and taste are alcoholic, citrusy, and slightly bready. Overall, a decent brew. Alcohol is a little pronounced, which affects drinkability. Not bad in my opinion."
"Notes: Overall I was pretty impressed with my first Belgian IPA, and I'm glad I got a chance to try it. I have little faith that Terrapin will make this a regular beer in their lineup or even a seasonal, but if they did I'd definitely buy it again - and that's the highest form a praise a beer can get. It is, overall, more mild than Hopslam or other Imperial IPA's, but if you're looking for something that fits that description than make sure to try Monk's Revenge before it's gone."
"A very good offering from Terrapin and glad to see them reach successfully beyond the norm."
"Drinkability: Why, it's a veritable hoot! Reminiscent of Stone's Cali-Belgique. The writing of this review paired well with the Murray Head song ""One Night in Bangkok"" playing on the TV behind me. Ah, Murry Head, we hardly knew ye."
"This is another decent brew in the Side Project series from Terrapin. Nothing groundbreaking, but a very drinkable IPA with plenty of Belgian character in the taste."
"D - Pretty nice overall, but a bit weak on the hops. More like a slightly Americanized tripple than a Belgian IPA."
"D: Well this is a drinkable brew. My only squabble is that this is far more DIPA than Belgian. There just isn't that balance I was looking for. If this beer is cold, that DIPA quality really comes out big time. Closer to room temperature, you get more Belgian qualities. I must be fair in that respect, but this is a very hop-centric brew. I just feel like they took the IPA side a bit further than the Belgian side. Still both are represented. Still I am love of all things Terrapin. If Terrapin were a band, I would be a groupie (like a hardcore groupie). I am going to take this experience as if they put on a show where I wasn't completely satisfied. Maybe the set list didn't have my favorite song, but I still had a good time. I may have contemplated whether or not I'd go back stage on this night, but I still went and made the best of it."
"When I saw that Terrapin's Side Project Release 5 was a Belgian DIPA, I had to pick up two bottles, and not just my usual one. The second I popped the cap, the hops hit me from an arms length while the beer was still in the bomber and I was not attempting to smell it. After poring into a Duvel Tulip, the beer looked clear, orange golden, and bubbly, but the head was tiny and remained that way. The smell from the glass was dominated by floral and citrus hops, and was true to the DIPA side of this hybrid style. The taste was mellow and hoppy and probably closer to a milder Belgian Pale Ale like Duvel than some of the other highly yeast driven beers from there. The spices showed up much more clearly after the beer warmed and the beer turned less hop centric. Decent body, but a little under carbonated for either style in my opinion. Not as bold as I was hoping, but very enjoyable anyway."
"D - Easy drinker here, sweet and smooth."
"Nice addition to the Sideproject lineup. I'm not sure the hopped up Belgians are always my favorite style, but this one is nicely balanced and not too prickly. Pours medium golden with an okay head that fades to a thin swirl. Smells sweet and citrusy to start, with a nice undertone of lemon and then some Belgian sweetness and more earthy hops. Taste is somewhat similar- anice blend of citrusy hops that pack just enough punch to make a statement, but restrained enough to not completely overwhelm the sweet malt and fruity Belgian esters. Smooth, citrusy, and slightly sweet in the mouth- refreshing. Very nice, I can see drinking this a number of times."
