Popping the top I get a huge citrus waft of lemon, orange and grapefruit oils with a nice sweetness in the background.  Pours into my trusty SAPP to a slightly cloudy watery bright yellow with a massive white pillowy head that stands for what seems like forever,  On the taste this brew has a nice citrus hop bite that is well balanced with a citrusy sweetness.  The taste transitions to a more bitter middle with sweet and bitter finish that is mostly clean.  Mouthfeel is light but insignificant due to overall flavor.  Head holds up all the way through the brew, a nice light drinker with a good flavor kick, definitely a keeper.","mooseisloose","Dec 14, 2014"

Taste: about as much character as your typical mall store chain. Seriously. Every single time I go back to New Belgium cuz I want to give a good bicycle- and environment-advocating company some shouts, I am always so disappointed and angry that I wasted cash and calories. Where is the wheat? I can barely taste it but it takes closing my eyes and searching for the wheat. Bitterness is present, but has no character (not grassy, not floral, not esterly, so ... just, bitter?). The carbonation is good and fizzy; the body is solid and not thin.

4,8.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Accumulation brewed by New Belgium Brewing, with an ABV of 6.20% This brew pours out a nice cloudy amber color with a nice white head.  Accumulation is a unfiltered brew. This brew is cloudy you can not see thought it.  The smell is citrus, with some grains and malts.  There is nothing bad so far.  Now for the taste, it is rich with citrus and hops.  You pick upon some grains at the end of this brew.  New Belgium Brewing did a nice job with this one. Accumulation has a nice balance to it there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  The mouthfeel is bold and clean.  At first it is citrus with some bitterness ,then it is smooth. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. Thank You New Belgium Brewing.","nicholas2121","Nov 26, 2014"

3.83,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a nonic. A hazy pale lemon yellow with a thin layer of foamy white bubbles on top and leaving concentric rings of lace on the sides of the glass. Bright and fresh aroma of lemon and pineapple, grass, something else faintly tropical or gummy candy-like, coriander seed, a ghost of pine needles. Palate is refreshing, citric, subtly sweet ... I get more of a session IPA vibe than the expected witbier base, at least initially, although there is a solid undercurrent of Belgian seed spice and dry phenols. Grapefruit, lime, and some mango complement the lemon on the nose. The combination of Belgian yeast and citrus hops recalls ginger root, in a way. Body on the low end of medium with moderate carbonation. Finishes rather dry, with lingering citrus rind, clove, and coriander notes. I stand by my earlier "session" assessment, flavorsome yet light and drinkable. Good balance between American hop and Belgian flavors, with the former front and center and the latter playing a competent supporting role.","CalgaryFMC","Nov 23, 2014"

The hop flavor is bright and juicy, balanced nicely against a very light, crisp malt body. Maybe the only thing I find "off" about this release is that it's a winter seasonal, when it's refreshing crispness just screams "SUMMER!"","Redneckwine","Nov 04, 2014"

The nose comprises coriander, pine needles, light biscuit, and grapefruit zest.  The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine takes on a bit of a minty character on the edges.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a wet feel.  Overall, a decent "white IPA", but nothing close to special.  Next.","TMoney2591","Aug 26, 2014"

Nose is very light with big hints of pineapple, funky yeast, and light sweet malt. Taste is very bready, which seems to be a tendency with several New Belgium brews, and, it’s worth admitting, is not a flavor profile I enjoy all that much in my beer. Also present are light grassy hints, very mild lemon citrus, light toasted cereal grains, generic sweetness, and french fries. The hop presence is there in terms of light bittering, but not in any larger sense of flavor. Finish is mildly bitter, toasted wheat, and subtle sweet citrus. Mouthfeel is light and somewhat slick with low carbonation. All in all, this just doesn't do much for me, which is about par for the course in terms of how I feel about New Belgium products in general. As a white IPA, I was also expecting a bit more in terms of both a fuller hop presence and some Belgian yeast notes, such as coriander, neither of which is present. As it stands, this reminds me of a clumsy wheat beer and not something I’ll be drinking again anytime soon.","8stringfan","May 10, 2014"

Almost like fruit that has rolled around on the wet ground. Clean bittering hops like Magnum could've worked better.

On the nose, very nice (almost sweet) floral piney scent dominates, with hints of lemon, grapefruit, grass, and melon. On the palate, the hops appear, but are well balanced by citrus tones of orange, lemon, and grapefruit. Really like how crisp this one drinks, which makes it imminently quaffable. No heavy malts or alcohol are apparent. Mouthfeel is good, if a little thin, but that's OK. This is a very good IPA to sip before trying something hearty. Probably great during summertime as well.

Flavor is citrus and dry grassy hops, pale malt, grapefruit and lemon citrus, finishing with astringent grassy hops with mild, pleasant stone fruit hovering at the edges, but not helping the finish. Light to medium bodied. Possibly the most grassy hop presence I've experienced in a beer, as I'd imagine a beer made with hay would taste. Not much Belgian presence.

3.83,3.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and a nice example of an IPA, as a Wheat Ale it's not that great and as hybrid of both which is what the brewer intended, it's just ok, the two style aren't as balanced as they could be and it comes off pretty IPA like and not that recognizable as a White Ale. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, crisp, clean, not filling, and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these without getting bored or tired of it. What I like the most about this beer is the aroma and appearance, I thought they were both pretty good and worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the the White Ale aspect wasn't more apparent, if it was more noticeable I think it would balance out some of hops and make it more of truer hybrid of an IPA and a White Ale. I would buy this beer again, I already got a 12 pack so I don't know if i'll buy anymore this season but I wouldn't rule it out and if they choose to release it again next year I;m sure I will buy at least a six pack. I recommend this anybody who likes hoppy beers. All in all I was happy with this beer, I wasn't flawless, but it still had enough aspects that made this a good beer.

After a few more sips, the bitterness lingered and got worse. This is WHY I don't like I.P.A. types of beer and actually bought this by mistake.

4.12,11.4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 2/2/2014. Pours fairly hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, wheat, pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, pine, wheat, and floral earthiness. Moderate amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, pineapple, passion fruit, tangerine, grapefruit, floral, grass, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a fair amount of malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wheat IPA! All around great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

3.91,5.7,3.75,4,4,3.75,3.75,"This a Winter offering from New Belgium. I normally drink thick Belgians, Trappists, Porters, and stouts in colder weather rather than hoppy beers. This white IPA is a surprise though. The label says fruit and citrus, but when first poured the nose is very pine and spruce and the flavor backs this up nicely. When I think "Winter," I think cold, crisp, air and the aroma of evergreens. So to me this ale is like Winter, or Christmas even, in a glass. A good beer to drink while "decking the halls." This clear, white ale has a white head that lasts and there is lacing on the glass. As it sits, more of the citrus aromas come through.","thehooksman","Nov 05, 2013"

4.06,9.7,3.75,4,4.25,3.75,4,"	Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste, and just how dang refreshing it was. Our first thought was that it reminded us of the Three Floyds pale ale series. It was not at all close to the same level of quality and freshness that they are able to capture, but it had the same vibe to it, as if they were attempting to recreate that type of profile. To that end, this was a highly pleasurable beer to drink. We also felt that it did the style justice, despite the recent bashing of the hybrid “white IPAs” across the forums here. It wasn’t so much of a blend of the two, but rather a sweetly hoppy IPA, with some transient features of more wheaty varietals found here and there. While we haven’t always been please with New Belgium’s selection as a whole, this beer confirms that they know how to select and incorporate hops across a range of different styles.","TheBrewo","Nov 01, 2013"

3.83,3.5,3.75,3.75,4,3.5,3.75,"Taste is lemon zest, hazelnuts, grainy malt and an underlying grassy hop. It is more simplistic than both Snow Day and 2 Below, and I fear I dont like it as much as either. The hop profile is pretty good, but it lacks depth...not surprising with the pale malts used. Its not a bad beer by any means...in fact, tasty enough for me to buy another sixer at least. But I miss my 2 Below something fierce.","twiggamortis420","Oct 10, 2013"

The smell was awesome - citrusy, strong, and crisp. This IPA wasn't as carbonated as the last one I had, but it's tasted wasn't as good either. Overall, it was pretty decent - not necessarily the first IPA I would reach for, but decent to partake.","jjamadorphd","Oct 05, 2013"

3.66,-1.1,3,3.25,4,3.5,3.75,"This is a very light IPA. I agree with others that it seems more like a wheat beer, but it has the citrusy qualities of a good IPA. It's very refreshing. I'm not sure why it's a winter seasonal; it seems like a great summer beer to me (thankfully I'm in Florida where summer extends on into October). I think it's a pretty great find!","Preston","Sep 25, 2013"

3.98,7.6,3.25,4,4.25,3.75,3.75,"O: Labeled a White IPA (a new style for me), I would put in the category of a Pale Wheat Ale. Great fruity hop aroma, hops balanced by good wheat and malts. Balanced and easy drinking, creamy mouthfeel my only drawback. Labeled a Winter Seasonal, I could drink this one year-round though. Nice work New Belgium.","ChrisCBeets","Sep 22, 2013"
