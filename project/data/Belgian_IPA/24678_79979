Clear amber color, with a billowing inch-plus of white head, which sank to a thick ringlet, and laced the glass nicely. In the nose, fruity yeast, soapy, some sugar sweetness, notes of citrus. Vaguely Belgian-IPA-ish. Thinned-out taste somewhat reflected the aroma, estery sweetness, light citrus twang, clovey spice, bready yeast, metallic undertones, crackery malts, neutral alcohol, leaving a bland finish. Overall came off more like an off-flavored DIPA than anything else. Light-medium body, average carbonation. Worth a couple sips, but not something that I would purchase.","Rifugium","Nov 15, 2013"

I prefer less citrus and was not disappointed as the citrus was not the dominant flavor. Not too bitter. I had one glass prior to eating and one glass with my meal of tomato based jambalaya and the flavor of the beer did become sweeter with the meal.

Pours slightly hazy deep orange amber color with a 2-3 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of tangerine, orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, banana, clove, pepper, caramel, candi sugar, floral, grass, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop, yeast ester, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, lemon zest, grapefruit, banana, clove, caramel, candi sugar, floral, grass, pepper, light pine, light bubblegum, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, banana, clove, candi sugar, caramel, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop, malt, and yeast ester notes; with hops over the yeast character, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a fairly slick, creamy, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Belgian DIPA! All around great complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and malt notes; and dangerously smooth to sip on for 9.3%. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 19, 2013"

There is sweetness, crispiness, freshness, and agedness, in particular afforded by the inoculated Belgian yeast strain that, at times, comes across as a borderline tart zestiness that conjures up thoughts of Flanders red ales. This comes across only slightly in flavoring, but the yeast does give an exotic, bittering punch to the otherwise syrupy, sweet, and caramel-laden DIPA base laid before it. We do, however, wish the hops were a little more pronounced, which would help add freshness throughout the flavoring and lingering aftertaste. This is a fantastic local brew, pulling influence from outside the state and country, for an admixture that truly, and authentically, hits the spot.","TheBrewo","Aug 16, 2013"

This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, not filling, fairly refreshing and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these without getting worn out or bored with this beer, the flavor keeps me coming back for more, it's a little dangerous how smooth this is for a 9.7% beer. What I liked the most about this beer was pretty much everything, there wasn't anything that I disliked or would change about this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that it's not in Brewery Vivant's regular lineup, I would love to be able to buy this beer year round. I would for sure buy this beer again, in fact I've already went back and got a couple more and I will buy a couple more cans if it's still around, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Belgian IPA's. All in all i was very impressed with this beer, since it was from Brewery Vivant I expected it to be good, but they really wowed me with the hop profile, complexity and balance of this beer. Good work guys, this an awesome beer and it's up there as one of the better Brewery Vivant beers I have had.","StoutHunter","Aug 07, 2013"

3.49,-13.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"The Crack released a spurt of beer that initially surprised me before I got things under CANtrol. The Glug produced anywhere between one to two fingers of light-tan head with decent retention. This was a rare occasion in which I shared a CAN with two other people. Color was solidly amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was not as intensely hoppy as the previous DIPA, but there were still plenty of hops in evidence. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thin, especially for the style. Taste was bitter and very hoppy, but not much beyond that. I do not mind unbalanced, but this simply did not stand up in comparison to the previous beer. Finish was citrusy, more toward lemon than grapefruit. Great name, so-so beer.","woodychandler","Aug 04, 2013"

Seek this out if you like hops and well crafted beer, can't really say anything bad about this one. Might be to early to proclaim, but this easily may become one of my favorites.","Roman5150","Jul 26, 2013"

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"It poured a dark cloudy amber with thin head, left plenty of lace around the snifter. The smell? Hops in the face. Floral, citrus, not noticeably Belgian. I had forgotten it would be a Belgian ale, so the yeast flavor in the taste was a pleasant surprise for me. Citrus, pineapple, bitter hops, sugar, and a little alcohol. Medium, well-carbonated, and really pleasant. It's very hoppy and high alcohol, so not one to guzzle. Really nice, I hope to try this one again.","sophisticated","May 06, 2012"

4.12,2.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall, this gets some love. I have to say that I notice that BV perhaps serves some of their beers a bit too cold off the tap. Things often start out really bland and just explode into beauty by the end. This is always expected, but a few degrees warmer would do them justice on brews like this one. It seems to take an undue amount of time for the beer to make you fall in love. Some selections can afford to be served more cold, but most of these nuanced selection need less cold. Just my opinion nobody needs, but first impressions are everything. This beer didnt become phenomenal until it was half gone and much more warm. It was served at about a 3.0 star flavor and finished at 4.0 stars. The most important thing is, it became phenomenal. Bravo...","SupaCelt","Apr 01, 2012"
