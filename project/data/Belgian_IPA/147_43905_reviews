"With the only difference being the yeast supposedly, there are some major differences. Unlike the Stone IPA (IPA) being a hazy gold color, the Cali-Belgique (CB) is crystal clear. The smell is also drastically different, the aroma is overwhelmed by spicy, belgian yeast aromas with only hints of the pine and citrus. The taste reflects this exactly, tastes like the IPA but overwhelmed by the flavors created by the Belgian Yeast. Overall an ok beer, but I definitely prefer the regular stone IPA. I feel the belgian yeast hinders the IPA flavor instead of improving it."

""
""
"This is a very, very good Belgian IPA, which happens to be a style about which I am not particularly fond. But this is an excellent, fruity, hop-forward example."
"I am normally not the biggest fan of Belgian style ales/pale ales/IPAs, but make an exception for this. Quality 6.9% IPA with minimal after taste and full flavor"
""
"Overall: Started out bitter like an IPA but then added nice citrus and spicy Belgian yeasty flavors. Smooth yet crisp and overall a good IPA."
"What a strange brew. Pours a gold with a two finger head. Smells like wheat with hint of citrus. Initially tastes like a Belgian but then finishes almost with a bubblegum after taste. So strange but I like it."
""
""
"Peppery Belgian yeast. Reads more like a saison than an IPA, though the hop finish asserts as the latter. #confusing"
""
""
"Another great beer from stone however the Belgian IPA mix might not work for some. I think it's interesting but not sure I'd have it for more than a novelty."
"Did not like at all. Don't think ipa's and Belgian's should ever mix."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance 4.5, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 3.5, Palate 4, Overall 4"
""
"O - Definitely more interesting than their traditional IPA, but still carries much of its profile. Why go back?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone does amazing IPAs, and this is no different. The only thing is with this beer is that it is very light. Much like a light IPA. I didn't get that strong IPA kick while I drank this one.  Great for someone who's just starting out on IPAs or for someone looking for something light with a little IPA taste"
""
""
""
""
"Good IPA, probably my favorite IPA from Stone."
"Judging by aroma and taste, this is stones standard ipa with Belgian yeast added for a sweeter candy-like background. Not as good as other brews from stone but still very good and enjoyable."
""
"Ive never had a Belgian IPA before. I must say it is very different in my opinion, not saying its a bad taste but not at all what you'd expect from a usual IPA. The hop smell is there, the taste is typical Belgian flavors on the front, and hoppy on the back end. Overall pretty good."
""
""
""
"Haven't had many Belgian IPAs, but Flying Dog Raging Bitch is what I would recommend if you want one.  For stone I will stick to their other great IPAs if I want some hops"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter, grapefruity, peppery, a little banana on nose. Nice feel, clean"
"In my personal opinion this is the one of the worst beers that i have ever tasted, and i am a hug Stone Brewery fan."

""
""
"O - 3.75 - This is an alright IPA. This is what I called a food pairing, lawn mower and shower beer. Very sessionable and easy to throw back. If you're an absolute die hard fan of the Belgian IPA style, then you might want to seek this one our, otherwise, it isn't anything crazy special."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am big Stone fan but did not enjoy this mix, which is partially my preference against Belgians but also a striking metal flavor that limited my rating significantly."
""
"Great belgian beer frm cali!"
""
"The smell gets better as it warms: more Stone IPA-like and less yeasty. It's a unique taste but I prefer Stone's more traditional beers."
"Overall: Great addition to Stone's 12-pack, very nice IPA hoppiness and spicy yeast belgian flavors, good combination. I like this beer a lot."
""
""
""
"Pours a light tangerine color with a two finger rocky white head.  Aroma is yeast, bubblegum, and spice.  Taste is balanced with mild hops, yeasty spice, faint bubblegum, and a bit of a bready or biscuity quality.  Mouthfeel is medium.  Overall a nice twist on the regular stone ipa, worth checking out for fans of ipa's and belgians."
""
"The Verdict: Pretty good. Well balanced between a yeasty Belgian brew and an IPA, it's missing the usual Stone hop bitterness overload. Nice brew for an occasional something different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Bitter, spicy, yeasty, fruity — definitely on the Belgian tip, this hopped-up ale brings a bitter, tangy counterpoint to the complex Belgian yeast content. A solid and faithful collision of classic Belgian and American IPA. Enjoyable, and one I’d enjoy again, no problem."
""
""
""
""
""
"From the Stone Mixed IPA 12 pack that included the Ruination, Delicious IPA, Arrogant Bastard and he Cali-Belgique. Great sample pack from Stone. I really enjoyed this Belgian IPA."
""
""
""
"Pours with very little head. Smells more Belgian than Ipa with some bready and sweet tones to it dont expect any smell of hops in this bad boy. Excellent malty taste with a good clean creamy finish. The hops were ever subtle but added to the overall great tasting experience. Overall a good solid 9 out of 10 Great Brew from the ever astounding Stone Brewing CO.  This is a hybrid worth buying!"

"Pours nicely into a tulip glass with some traces of lace. Color is like bright piny finished furniture. Aroma is quite appealing. Taste is uniquely Beguim, fruity and malty. Its a smooth feel with pleasant aftertaste. Overall, this brew is one to enjoy. Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours clear, golden.  Smells like a Belgian ale.  Malt taste, citrahop.  Creamy finish.  More a Belgian than an IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Got about 6 of these FREE. Drinkable. I've had arogant bastard and y'all are crazy this is way better. Stone is completely overfrickinrated"
""
"Style wasn't for me. I should give this another try."
"Taste not like a Belgian saison than anything. Mild hop. Presence in the beer."
"Overall: This was different than what I was expecting. Stone decided not to go overboard with the hops? Either way, all of the components went together well to create flavorful IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't understand some the reviews. It has Belgian yeast. It says it on the bottle! This is a good value at 4-5 a bomber."
""
""
""
"BA says I have to submit a review due to a statistical outlier."
""
"Pours a very attractive hazy gold color with a moderate head that dissipates rather quickly. Tiny bit of sediment floating around. Smells fruity and hoppy, the yeast adds a pleasant note. Taste is impressive, a very flavorful mix of sweet fruit, citrus, and rather bold hoppyness. It is also slightly grassy, and the sweet aspect falls off in the finish to leave a satisfying bite. Medium body, active carbonation. A very pleasant, enjoyable spin on an IPA. I'll probably pick up another bottle in the near future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Stone IPA + Belgian yeast = Awesomeness. Moderately hazy, golden  with foamy white head. Nice lacing that stays put. Bready aromas, slight fruitiness. A nice mellow hopiness flavor with that subtle hint of banana bread from the yeast. Pulls together nicely. Lightly carbonated with subtle stickiness that works."
""
"Delish good for IPA fans and a good for those who don't like IPAs"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I know this beer is rated well but it's not for me. I need more of the classic american ipa flavors. Too much ""European"" influence for my taste. Sorry Stone, but this is the first one of your beers that I will not be trying again."

"Tasty Brew! Love the flavors of this IPA. Head is so thick i could stand on it. It does not give up either. Remains strong and sticky for the duration of the beer. Waiting time on the head is long, but a good thing. I love observing the beer as long as i can. Carbonation is healthy. Nice sweet taste on a flat tongue. Brings out a lot of flavor. Pleasant sweet malts with a tinge of bitterness. The hops bring up the back and remain with the nose. Love how clean tasting this is. Really easy to drink. Great after a hard day work. Aromas from the beer keep you focused and interested. Watching the beer descend in the glass is a show. Presentation is outstanding. I will continue to enjoy this for the winter. Definitely recommend this. Cheers!"
"Overall - A well crafted Belgian IPA. The belgian yeast works well to complement the bitterness from grapefruit peel."

"Stone brew new to Alberta number two, bomber poured into a tulip. Nice looking brew, light bronze amber with a fluffy, resilient off-white head rather like meringue. Leaves nice concentric rings of lace around the glass. Aroma of fresh grapefruit, burlap sack, cloves, a little orange as well, light caramel. Ample rustic Belgian yeast and sturdy citrus and pepper hops. Palate is quite wonderful, one of the better compromises between yeast and hops I've observed in this rather murkily defined style. Impressive resinous green bitterness coupled with grapefruit, lower key orange and pineapple, green banana, medicinal phenols to a surprising degree. Moderate body with some heft and similarly robust carbonation. Finishes intensely bitter and dry, decent pucker power that recalls more citrus rind (lemon with no juice to sweeten things), floral tobacco, herbal tincture and flinty minerals. I am enjoying this brew's bucolic intensity and unapologetic spicy edge. Smooth mouth feel despite these traits. Stone may be old news down south but this ought to make waves up here."

"Pours an amber-yellow pretty clear color with an average head and minimal lacing. Aroma hits hard at first and then mellows a bit. Aroma is first of pine resin and grapefruit and then mellows out some. Taste is hoppy with a nice bitterness, some citrus rind and just a touch of sweetness to balance it. Leaves a hoppy-citrus peel aftertaste which is pleasant"

"Overall - The beer is 2/3 California IPA and 1/3 Belgian sour. The result is one fine ale! Stone is to be commended for combining these diverse elements into one bottle."

"One of my favorite beers of all-time that also happens to be readily available, and relatively affordable. Can't beat that."

"More Belgian than IPA, most of the facets of this brew lean towards Belgium. Starts with a funky, yeasty aroma, lightly hazy golden body and small, thin silky head. Taste brings on the yeast again, but the Stone hops come in to bite at the end. Finish reminds me of some French cheese. Interesting!"

"Over all its not a bad beer I would be interested in tasting this when it is extremely fresh. I also think it tastes better at a slightly warmer temperature like a belgian instead of a ipa temperature."

"O - An interesting Belgian IPA. Great for the price and great if you want something different from most IPAs, especially with how dry this is."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D - Quite complex and drinkable. I imagine this would be much better fresh, but it's still quite tasty and has a nice mix of the Belgian influence and IPA character. This is one I've been waiting to try for a while and it was the wait. Well done."

"This will forever be remembered as the beer I was drinking when the winning USA goal went in against Ghana, so forgive me if I was a bit distracted from how it tasted. Slightly hoppy, but not too much. Some floral notes as well. Some IPAs will beat you over the head, but not this one. Another great Stone offering."
""
"Research leans toward Belgian yeast & saisson styling and who am I to argue?"

""
""
""
"D: Not a huge fan of this one. It’s not necessarily flawed but is a bit disjointed with too much going on for my liking. The 22oz was a bit of a chore and I don’t like doing chores without some type of reward."

"Overall 4.0: Great beer. Unique tastes in this beer and certainly not what I was expecting by reading the label and skipping through the (now) typical idiotic drivel that Stone feels compelled to waste valuable paint printing on each bomber-size bottle of their beers. Seriously, who writes this garbage? Regardless, this beer is not focused on what I would associate with Belgian beers, but instead is focused on a more funky yeast strain that -nonethless-- works with Stone's excellent IPA recipe. Definitely worth a try for fans of Flanders-style beers, lambics, geuze and bretts. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Moar liek Cali-Failgique, amirite? I really, REALLY hope Stone's saison is about thirty times better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A different beer. Don't expect a strongly hopped IPA or you will be disappointed. Don't take me wrong, the hop is definitely there but saves room for the yeast. One can definitely taste a Duvel type yeast. (dry finish and pear like flavor) I really like the Chinook, it gives a really dry type of flavor (similar to the the APA by schlafly, almost like sucking mint leaves: almost hairy in some ways). The dryness of the hop flavor and of the body (the beer is well attenuated) really complements the Duvel yeast well. A different beer but that worked well for me."

"As a big fan of Belgium ales and an even bigger fan of Stone ipas, I was very excited to sample this hybrid. This ale pours a gorgeous golden color with a thick long lasting white head. Very European in appearance. The aroma is quite sweet with tons of Belgium yeast and malty notes. Though there is definitely and underlying aroma of west coast hops. This one has a lighter body than I expected. The flavor of this ale is more European influenced than I expected with a lot of sweet yeast flavors and Malt. Yet there is a definite American ipa influence. A very decent amount of hops that would not be found in a typical belgium ale. This is not my favorite Stone offering or my favorite belgium ipa but it is a very good well crafted ale blending two of the best styles if beer ever created."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful crystalline golden color. Smells fresh and grape-y. The beer is very effervescent and foams in the mouth; it's almost a little too distracting. Warm and bready like a Belgian but with a much more pronounced hops character, and I think I taste more grapes in the back. I've been thinking about Stone's Enjoy By series a lot recently and in my eyes this could have never lived up to that, but it's solid."
""
""
"Good take on the style that proves you don't always need in-your-face to get tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Thought would be better. The smell was good, but not thick and fragrant like a Belgo-IPA should be. The two worlds of Belgian brew & IPA were mild in scents and taste. Good for the style, but I didn't get too excited drinking. Just sipped nonchalantly. Good to slightly great beer, but not classic like a Stone brew should be."

"Poured a nice orange-hued amber, cloudy, thin white but creamy head with good lacing. Aroma dominated by hops- pine, rosemary, funk, dirty socks, slightly yeasty. Bitter upfront on the palate, receding to resinous hops, lighter caramel malts, subtle yeast flavor, slight soapiness. Lingering bitterness, dry, tingling mouthfeel."

" Loving these American/Belgian-style brews, Big American hops and complex Belgian yeast are just a wonderful thing."

""
""

""
"O- Its been said so many times, its almost not worth saying. Stone knows what the hell they are doing. If you haven't jumped on board, you're insane. This was a super complex, super balanced, beer. I'm almost dumbfounded by what just happened. Happens pretty regularly with a Stone brew."
""
"Overall: Fantastic brew. Holds up to Stone's standards very well."
""
""
"This is a very good example of how American breweries do the style. The craftsmanship is there. This is a style that I love. There's still a few other examples of the styles I prefer, but this is always a nice experience when consumed fresh."
""

"A really great beer. The hops and yeast compliment each other very nicely and make for a tasty, easy drinking, yet complex beer."
""
"It does flow nicely, and it has a pleasant soft smoothness built on a velvety-feeling carbonation that also adds a little crispness. The body is a good medium. It finishes out semi-dry as some alcohol and a little leaf edge in."
"Might be worth a re-taste a year or so down the line, but for now, I will probably not be buying it again anytime soon."

"Very pleased with this. It avoids the overt hoppiness of other Stone offerings."

""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice one finger head. Enjoy By 9/2/13, enjoyed a month early. Aroma is unmistakeable Belgian yeast, dry, with a hint of fruity hops, mango, pear, apple. Flavor is dry yeast and light apple and pear flavors. Tiny bit of grass from the hops. This seems really more like a dry Tripel with nearly no influence from the IPA portion. High carbonation and light mouthfeel. Overall not bad but was hoping for more IPA influence."

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a deep golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of yeast, a bit fruity. Taste is citrus, yeast, hoppy but not bitter, more fruits, complex and tasty, well done. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this beer is worth a try."

"The beer poured a golden color with a fluffy white head. The Belgian yeast made its presence known in the aroma with hints of clove and bubblegum. The taste was very dynamic. You could taste the Stone IPA base with its hoppy profile and bitterness. The Belgian Yeast gave it a subtle tang that boosted the flavor without being overwhelming. The Cali-Belgique was a nice twist on the Stone IPA and one of the best Belgian Style IPAs I have tried as the yeast was a nice compliment to the beer rather than overpowering it. This was another well crafted brew from the brewers at Stone."
""
""
""
""
"This is a tremendous IPA from Stone. it's not feather light but the malt is soft and graceful. The fruits are just so many and so splendid int he drink. It's complex and it's complex in the finish. Not too many beers can say that. Smooth, creamy and completely delicious. You could drink this one every day."

"This wasn't that strong either, even though there was enough alcohol in this to be felt. Thankfully, this was different than anything I've had before while still retaining the West Coast hops and body that one would expect from a Stone beer. Add in an easygoing nature and a nice amount of yeast and this beer's a winner. I can't wait to go it another go!"

"DATE TASTED: July 27, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel snifter... OCCASION: post-Cinders dinner drink while viewing The King's Speech... APPEARANCE: beastly swirling tornado of effervescence ripples up to a snow-white two-finger head that frames a burnt-orange body--a beautiful glass to behold... AROMA: sugary, candied fragrance sits atop the classic Stone hops head bang--worth the price of admission just to soak in its aura... PALATE: soft, mildly hopped yet beguilingly medium-bodied; warming in the throat but not intrusive; a paradox that seems to bare out the uniqueness of the beer's namesake...TASTE: provocatively complex tart--grapefruit and pepper indelibly cascade with each swallow; balanced and substantial,, but in a way that invites a second bottle... OVERALL: Playing off the film, I will say this beer does not possess a stutter-inducing ABV, but the flavor, frame and aroma, this beer has a lot going for it...the over-babble on the bottle label could be severely edited, but no mistaking the beer is one I will recommend to friends, give as a gift and seek out when disposable income is more readily available..."

"It's really in the finish do the hops really pack a wallop, with a big, piny bitterness. The mouth feel is syrupy and full, for a beer of a relatively lower ABV. It's somewhat warming after each swallow. Although this is a little unusual for a Belgian IPA, it's complex, which I love and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it and purchase it again."

"Taste starts with pine, then moves to orange with a bit of lemon and grapefruit. Has a nice bready finish with both pine and orange, and a bit more of nondescript fruit. A little funky/yeasty. Has a light body and high carbonation for an IPA, although they are probably both average for a Belgium."

"O Great beer. Would recommend and will certainly have again. Really enjoy the unique tastes associated with Stone fermenting their IPA wort with this belgian yeast strain. Makes for a great warm weather brew! One of my favorite things about Stone is their ability/willingness to brew great beer for a great price. Their bombers are usually $2-$4 less than the majority of other craft bombers without any compromise in quality."

"The taste is bother Belgian mellow with a hopped up bitterness. What I mean is that I get the roasted pale malts, nectarine and pear, warming subtle sweetness with a full hoppy and dry finale. I liked this ""hybrid"" for lack of a better word. It is one of the more interesting and unique IPA's I have tried."
"It's refined, and I'm sure it would appeal to people who don't enjoy beers with higher ABVs."

"I've read other reviews of this beer in which folks declared themselves as Belgian Ale lovers who enjoyed this IPA in spite of themselves; and as a hophead who doesn't generally enjoy Belgians, I would describe this as a Belgian Ale which I can easily drink. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone who likes either hops or Belgian yeast."

"O-Leave it to stone to make the best Belgian IPA. There's a really great balance between Belgian yeast and hoppy bitterness."

"-This is a good beer. A very easy to drink good beer, that happens to pair nicely with almost anything else you can put in your mouth."
"It's a wonderful marriage of Stone IPA and Belgian-style IPA. It's sweet, hoppy, wild, and dry, and I'm falling madly for it. Quite drinkably, passes the gullet with the greatest of ease. Each new sip leaves me loving this, and marveling at the mastery of it's creation. Mmm, mmm."

"O- great beer it's a unique hybrid that stands in a class of its own. It has the standard west coast IPA flavor that Stone does damn well. Then they throw in the Belgian yeast that seriously puts this beer in an awesome spot in my book. I think this beer can appeal to both the IPA drinker and the Belgian ale drinker. I'm more of a Belgian guy myself and this beer is super refreshing to me for the warmer California months I know and love."

"Overall - The merging of styles detracted rather than enhanced it for me. Some of the aroma and flavor character struck me as unpleasant. I'd take a conventionally made Stone IPA over this one."

"O - I'm not a belgian IPA guy, this has a lot of spice and character in this brew, that I'm sure would get some people excited, but its the sour belgian quality that doesnt sit right with me. Not awful, but not my thing."

"I was pleasantly surprised at the aroma of tonight's ""Cali-Belgique"". I dare say it had a ""floral bouquet"" scent about it. After tasting it a few times (drinking ""through"" the beautiful, foamy, 1/2 inch head) , I'd say the floral aroma was true, but with a citrus twist to it (limon/orange). Hops were definitely in the mix of flavors, but not overwhelmingly. The only ""gig"" I'd give it was the lingering yeast taste that stuck on my palate, which made me take another drink, one after the other. Overall, a great beer!"

"O: It's great for a niche beer. I don't know if I could drink these every day, but I think it might come down to taste acquisition. Really unlike anything I've had before. A good example for home brewers to see what a big difference a yeast makes."

"Light and golden in color almost crystal clear transparency and lots of effervescing bubbles. Fine head with some good retention. Smells fruity and yeasty with mild hops.

Very well rounded beer, lots of great flavors and great if you're looking for something new and unique."

"Overall (4/5): Cali-Belgique is what you expect out of Stone Brewing Co.: solid. This experiment with using Belgian yeast to modify the classic Stone IPA works well. While it isn't quite as good as the original, it is a nice departure from the norm and a worthy entry in Stone's lineup of year-round beers. Try it out if you're like me and a little bored with the garden variety IPA. I think you'll enjoy it."

"Pours amber to orange with a good amount of cloudiness. Finger thick head on an 8 oz pour dorm this 22 oz bottle. Nice spotted lacing on the glass through consumption. Smells of a strong piney hop and similar to the regular Stone IPA. Flavor is also nicely bitter and sweet with the hops - I want to say the Belgian yeast makes this slightly less hoppy in taste and more balanced than the regular version. Very enjoyable brew."

"O- This is a hoppy and spicy IPA and very nice for this brewery."

"The usual Stone IPA traits with a nice hint of Belgian yeast. A little spicy and phenolic but still let's the base beer through. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"A decent interpretation of the style; the Belgian yeast character certainly shines through. Not overly IPA-like; the hops don't come across all that well (and certainly not by Stone standards). Impressively yeasty aroma and flavour, with a nice bitter finish to round it off. I reckon this could have done with a greater addition of hops but it remains a well-crafted effort. Although I'm not a fan of Belgian IPAs I find this pretty good, and better than some others that I've tried as it achieves a degree of balance between the yeast and hop notes. In general the style has a muddled character that leaves you unsatisfied. Worth trying, even if I probably won't pick one up again."

"O - This is a nice enjoyable IPA for sure! I wish the oily nature was a bit subdued but otherwise this is fantastic."

"O: Cali-Belgique is a workmanlike Belgian-style ale that I wouldn't necessarily peg as a Stone beer. The hops are pretty toned down by their standards, and what you've got here is a reasonably priced, accessible entry for those new to the Belgian IPA style."

"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-low carbonation, creating a generally smooth, creamy, and well-flowing. Closes quite dry, as expected from the Belgian yeast and abundant hops."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best by 7/18/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a good 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, clove, pepper, banana, orange, grapefruit, herbal, grass, honey, earth, and yeast spices. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good complexity. Taste of big lemon, orange rind, pepper, clove, banana, grapefruit, honey, bread, herbal, floral, pine, earth, and yeast spices. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, banana, clove, pepper, herbal, pine, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Great flavor balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a very nice crisp and lightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is an excellent Belgian IPA. Great balance of hop and yeast character; and extremely smooth to drink. Very well done."
"Pours out a dark golden yellow hue with a thick offwhite head that leaves s. ome good lacing and retention. The beer has a very pleasant yeast, bread, fruity, and peppery aroma. The taste starts out with some yeast followed by some pine and citrus hops and finishes off with some fruity sweet malts. The flavors are very well balance in a creamy but slightly dry mouth feel that makes this an IPA to enjoy when wanting something that is different than other IPAs, but still from a reliable brewery."

"It's an interesting tasting. Initially I thought I would really dig this but as I got into it, it wasn't as impressive as expected. The appearance is a beautiful golden; the smell is a sweet malty, yeasty mix. The taste is hoppy with a fruitty malty mix. Didn't quite get the wit taste that I've heard about but the IPA definitely stood out. At the middle and end of tasting it was kinda strange. I could drink this again but will not go out of the way for it."
""
""
"Since then, I've tried a couple others which tasted better and more balanced. Still not big on it, but make this one look even worse in hindsight."
""
""
""
"O: I do not hate many beers. I HATED this beer! Half was miserably drank with the rest dumped. Based on some of the other positive reviews, I wonder if I had a bad bottle. I am not willing to risk it on this one to try again. I love Stone IPAs and figured this was a guaranteed hit. I guess I was wrong."

"Color is orange-gold; the pearl white head is huge with plenty of lacing on the glass. Citrus scents are wonderful, but a bit weak. The taste is an exquisite blend of citrus - tart grapefruit and apple, lemon and orange. There is also a slight clove and banana flavor that is a bit reminiscent of a hefeweizen - this is what makes it different from the standard Stone IPA. Both are absolutely delicious, and among my all-time favorites."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. A latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, herbal hops, and Belgian yeast. Taste is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and herbal hops up front with the Belgian yeast flavors coming through on the finish. There is a mild amount of citrus zest bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great flavor and high drinkability."

"The only way I can put this beer is if you mixed a Stone IPA with a Saison. Thats really it; its got Belgian in its feel, with a nice crisp finish that hints of spices with the citrusy hop bite of Stone's IPA. And if that sounds appealing to you, go for it. But to me, its pretty much on par with their regular IPA. I will say it does hit the spot better for the summer weather, hence a slight edge in its favor comparably."

"Served from a 22oz Bomber into a tulip. The color is that of a fresh apricot, deep golden orange with a slight haze and 2-3cm of fluffy head. Leaves a mild lacing on the glass. The nose is very sweet with lots of fruity esters and the ever-present hops of all Stone beers. Good balance on the nose that continues into the taste. There is the usual citrus hop profile of grapefruit and lemons, but it blooms into a white bread and estery sweet fruit of the Belgian yeast. Very interesting taste. The mouthfeel is light on carbonation, very full with a long bitter finish that reminds you that you are drinking a Stone. Overall, this is a quite tasty beer. Lots of sweet belgian yeast and good hop profile. Good beer."
""
"A great twist on Stone's famous American IPA. I will most certainly seek this one out again."

"This is exactly what a Belgian IPA should taste like. All the complexities of a Belgian brew with an aggressive hop bitterness, a dry, crisp finish and a well balanced drinkability."

"Overall: This beer isn't exactly a classic but it is close. Tasty and full what else can you ask for, drink up this bottle will not be your last. Salud!"
""
"Overall - The back of the bottle describes this perfectly; that is this is the Stone IPA with a Belgian yeast strain. The malt and hop profile is their IPA to a T, but that Belgian yeast kick adds a whole 'nother layer of complexity. It's a delicious beer, but I think it's more interesting in the context of experimentation, in just how big an influence a yeast strain can have on the final outcome of of a beer. Most people tend to think of the yeast as an afterthought... I know I have. It's been ""hops this and malts that"". This beer serves as a flagship as to just how important yeast can be!"

"overall - alright, but a bit too much of the Belgian yeast flavors for me."

"From a 750 ml bottle, this beer is crystal clear and pale-golden in color. The head is brilliantly white, and moderately stable. An interestingly fruity aroma is very pleasant and inviting...apple, grape (grape-skins), and a spicy hop background. Some malt, yeast, and some sugary sweet-smelling notes. The taste is very balanced...sweetness up front, and a delicate, very well-proportioned bitter hop tone. Smoother in body than expected. Long, lingering, spicy hop finish."
"Overall it's worthy of the Stone name."
""
"An OK beer, but nothing special. I will say that it had the “Stone” feel to it, but I just wasn’t into it from the start."
"O: I really like this beer, the malt gets somewhat lost in the background, but is a good distraction from all the IPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
"O- An ambitious effort, quite a duet. But, for me, the Belgian yeast becomes too much. It rolls over the IPA. A pint of this once or twice a year would be enough for me."

"Medium body with a nice burst of high carbonation. Nice beer on a warm day, I really like this."

"at 4.99 a bottle, its the best deal around."

"Overall, a very solid Belgian IPA. The hops stay nicely restrained allowing the Belgian characteristics to take center stage. Another impressive beer from Stone."
""
"O - This is one of my new favorite Belgian IPA. It favors the Belgian side of the style, but the flavors are complex with just enough hop bite to give it balance. Stone makes some of my favorite beers and I will add this one to the list."
"O: This beer is pretty well balanced with nice amounts of complexity. There is a very enjoyable flavor/smell and the beer is very easy to drink, I could easily have more than one of these but it might be a little strong to be sessionable. I found this pretty refreshing and will likely have it again."
""
"Had a typical hoppy ipa taste with what I call the mint chewing gum belgian yeast taste. Very Very good. Poured an amber with thick white head which left quite a bit of lacing. Nice floral/citrus IPA aroma."
""
""
""
"nice take on a belgian ipa, quite different from say new belgium's belgo. pours light golden and bright, clear through with a one inch white head that hangs out the whole time. smells like belgian yeast, west coast aggressive hops, and light crystal and pale malts in equal proportions. flavor is very well balanced between the fruity lively yeast and the hops, which taste less intense than they smell. some citric hops in here, and some fruit, maybe nelson sauvin? malt profile is very light. feel is okay, but not entirely well suited to this beer. the body is light to medium, which i find a bit thin for the style. carbonation os robust though, and its easy drinking and delicious. overall yet another nice beer from stone."

Nice residual sweetness balanced against aggressive dry hopping all making for a nice brew."

"crustal clear golden yellow pour, 2 fingers white fluffy head, excellent lacing. smells of pepper, coriander, orange peel, piney hop smell. initial piney taste, with a sweet caramel orange flavor in the backbone, tastes more like a belgian than an IPA and is surprisingly not bitter (weird coming from Stone!!). medium bodied with a slight spicyness to it that makes it very refreshing, moderate carbonation, slight creaminess. overall, a great warm weather thirst quencher with a decent abv% that isn't overwhelming. very tasty and very refreshing - it's a shame it's so hard to get in my area."

"O- This is an interesting mash up and I admire the brewer's adventurous spirit. It is enjoyable once you get beyond expectations of what it is supposed to taste like. It certainly defies any attempt to pigeon hole it. For my taste, I would prefer it to be either an IPA or a Belgian Ale. There is a bit of a clash between the IPA level hops and the Belgian yeast."

"This was really interesting and very polarizing, I'd guess. The yeast was very americanized, in that it wasn't very robust in flavor. It was mildly spicy and funky, but I didn't get anything in the middle of the spectrum. This combined with the typical Stone ""in your face"" hop profile made it a beer of extremes. The malt was not the central point, although it complimented the beer when necessary. I like the aspects it showcased, but felt it was a bit thin in the flavor profile, leaning too much on the extremes of taste and smell."
""
"On tap at Stone prior to enjoying a fantastic dinner. The beer arrives a yellowish golden color with a nice 2 finger creamy white head. Decent retention and some lacing. The nose is a mix of orange fruitiness together with a granny smith sweetness, together with the bubble gum yeast character. A faint hint of peppery spices. Nice aroma. The flavor follows suit: Citrus upfront, orange, grapefruit together with some apple and pear flavors. The spiciness found in the nose follows, though mellow. Medium bitterness. Very smooth. Finishes with a lingering bubble gum fruitiness. Nice. Lighter bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Dry. Overall, one of the better Belgian IPA's I've had. I'd recommend."

"OVERALL: Really enjoyed this one. One of the better Stone beers I’ve had, and one of the better Belgian influenced IPA’s I’ve come across as well. Still all that hoppy goodness that Stone IPA delivers, and the Belgian yeast contributes a nice spicy element that works really well. Quality stuff I’d definitely drink again. Recommended."

"O: Man, this is a pretty average beer all around. I was really looking forward to this one as I love a good Belgian IPA and this one just felt so safe. I feel like Stone could have taken a few shots with this one and just didn't. I won't be seeking this one out again."
"O: This is a nice A- to A beer for me. I don't think that I have had a BAD Stone beer. This certainly doesn't disappoint. I like the creative approach to brewing that they have. Expanding on their regular solid line, but not straying too far."
"O - This is one of my favorite IPAs and it's even more fantastic fresh on tap. The flavors are more subtle and for someone who is new to IPAs (like I was back when I had this), it's a great place to start."
""
""
""
""
"M: Great feel- medium carbonation with a light to medium body that makes for a very refreshing brew."
"O: A nice example of the style, nothing earth-shaking, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall an interesting version of Stone IPA, thanks to the Belgian yeast. It's softer and mellower than the original. I may prefer Belgian IPAs like Houblon Chouffe - as those are Belgian first, IPA second whereas this is IPA first, Belgian second - but it's a good beer nonetheless."
""

""
""
"O: I re-iterate, similar in spirit to the Belgo IPA from New Belgium, but certainly bares the marks of its brewery. Lacked the hoppy freshness a lot of other Stone brews have."
""
""
"overall: will focus on other beers in the stone offering. FYI: this was my wife's favorite beer of the bunch."
""
"During the time it took for us to work on this bottle of Cali-Belgie, we also had a few customers inquire about our half-full glasses. One guy was originally going to buy Bud Light but wanted to try something new. After just a couple sips of the Cali-Belgie he was converted. There are few things more satisfying than converting a Bud Light drinker to serious craft beer!"
"O - This is a very interesting and unique beer for sure. It's hard to believe this is the same Stone IPA, but brewed using a Belgian yeast strain. It really does change the taste quite a bit, and while I did enjoy it, I am still partial to Stone IPA. This beer's biggest strengths were the aroma and mouthfeel, which were quite nice. I will certainly try this brew again sometime, and hope that I can try other offerings that experiment with different yeast strains much like this one."
"I'm not really too super keen on the beers that are overly ""Belgian"" So... this one is a nice balance for me. It's really great."

"I'm new to the Belgian IPA style, so I don't yet have points of reference, but really enjoyed this beer. The phenols and esters really added to what is otherwise the malt and hop profile of Stone's IPA."
""
"I looked through numerous reviews to see if anyone else picked up on the Welch's taste as did I and found none, so perhaps it me."

""
"Overall – There was this one odd taste to the beer but it was only subtle. While I've had other beers within this style that were better, this one was still above average and quite drinkable. Stone rarely disappoints."
""
"Overall, what we found to be the best thing about this brew was the straight flavoring, with echoes of the elements promised in the nose. There is a great blend of spice and yeast, effectively and beautifully mixing with the bittering hoppy components. We would have like to see a stronger, fuller head on top for the style, but otherwise this offering holds up nicely to its competitors."

"Overall; I really feel like I'm trashing this beer unfortunately, however I am being honest with my impressions. I feel like Cali-Belgique does two things half as well as a beer that does one thing pretty well... Kind of brings the saying ""jack of all trades, master of none"" to my mind. Perhaps this is simply a style I am incapable of appreciating and I'll likely revisit this one at some point a couple more times at varying intervals to give it (and any changes my palate goes through) another shot."

"An interesting twist on Stones IPA, very drinkable and worth checking out!"
""
"Really enjoying this brew."
""

"O- Not surprisingly, this is a very good beer and the best of its style that I have tried but Im not crazy about Belgium IPA's. This one is very good and may get again, just not over stones other IPA's."

"This looks like a tasty beer, it got a dark gold body that’s just a little bit hazy, medium carbonation and it’s topped with a nice thick white head that slowly dissipated into a semi-thick covering and supported by some decent lacing. Strong hops, spices and citrus, mostly grapefruit, come through in the aroma. It’s got a medium mouth feel and is really crisp on the tongue. Over all flavor is just a bit bitter, spices are well detectable. The aftertaste gets a little more bitter but is just as complicated as the taste itself."

"Overall this is a great and very well balanced crossover IPA with Belgian Yeast from the folks at Stone."
"Great effort at a crossover style brew. I let the bottle warm some out of the fridge. Then I poured a large, billowy, frothy, fluffy, off-white head with some lace. Color is a clear amber with no bubble trails. Aroma is a tad mild and with crackers, bread dough, yeast, malt, hint of hop. Flavor is like nose but the hops leap to the fore, followed by sweet/tang, yeast bitter, and other stuff. Body is good, but carbonation seems a shade flat. Finish is like flavor, still maintains complete hop profile, adds a touch of banana and is overall, nice. But not too nice. Maybe more like - engaging."
"Overall this is an easy drinking, high quality and very enjoyable Belgian IPA. The smell is very straight-forward in that you get exactly from the taste what the aroma advertises. Recommended for IPA or Belgian beer fans."
"O: This is definitely an interesting style. This brew definitely succeeds at what it aimed to do. The problem with this was that I really don't a Belgian, yes this includes a Duvel. A Belgian feels to light for my taste. Balancing a beer is nice, but I simply enjoy stronger flavors to emerge."
"O: This was a very interesting experience for me. Ultimately though, I think I'll stick to normal IPAs. Definitely something to check out, but not really for me."
"I think there's two ways something like this has to be judged: accuracy of style, and simple beer-as-beer. Stone's stated intention (it's right on the bottle) is California-meets-Belgium, and on that I think they could've used a touch more west coast g-funk. On beer-as-beer merits, it still works though. I averaged the two."
"The Accidental Highway to Hell Tour continues! This stop pours a clear amber-tinted gold topped by a finger of light cream-white micro-foam. The nose comprises dank pine needles, wet grass, lime, light lemon zest, light-ish toffee, and pineapple. The taste holds notes of nutmeg, clove, black pepper, rich toffee, light pretzel, banana, pineapple, light pine resin in the back, and some very light balsa even further in the back. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a silky smooth feel. Overall, a very nice BIPA, one that goes down way the hell too easily..."
"palate: the hops dominate the taste at first, but there is a hint of the yeasty/fruity flavor of belgian styles. i would say that the taste comes out as bitter with citrus aftertaste. it really feels like i just bit the tip off of a douglas fir"
"O: I would recommend this beer. It is a nice variation on the standard IPA."
"$4.99 bottle"
"O - This is an interesting and very solid beer. If you like IPAs and you like Belgian beers like I do, it is a no brainer."
"Dry peppery and can't believe this is 6.9 for an Abv. A lovely example that I would be happy to belly up to again and again. Just so I can pad the would count from one of my favourite chalices for tastings the Schiltz American Abbey series. Nice residual sweetness balanced against aggressive dry hopping all making for a nice brew."
"I'm gonna buy this again, from a different store, and give this beer review another go."
"A very enjoyable beer so full of flavor it's sipable without the extreme ABV."
"O - Overall good beer, typical piney bitterness of an IPA. Stone did a good job of combining multiple styles to come up with a very enjoyable beer."
"Overall Drinkability -There's no real style or frame of reference by which to grade this. They apparentlycall it an IPA but it's not like any I've had. I'll have to simply rate it on sheer enjoyment factor, and there it does well."
"Poured in a Dogfish Head tulip glass, pours a golden straw color, the smell lets you know that this is very much so a Stone IPA with a citrus, and a floral aroma. Taste is hop forward very similar to a fresh Stone IPA but with a fruity character from the yeast. Very drinkable, the best of both worlds- California hops and Belgian yeast."
"O - Overall a very clean and straightforward beer, one of the best of the style."
"Much more Belgian (or at least anti-Stone) than even the spunky label could lead one to believe. Cali-Belgique goes a long way to illustrate the effect of yeast on any beer's impression, i.e. there's a Stone IPA under there, but it is ensconced in DNA-rewriting, Euro-lowlands mind shiftiness. Bottom line: still tasty, but the hoppier, bitter beast that you have hitherto known has been co-opted by a surprisingly agreeable, um, (I know) Belgian character. Bigend of Blue Ant, represent!"
"O: This is certainly a unique brew that helped open my eyes to what a different yeast strain could do to change the flavor of a beer. I'm not acclimated to Belgian styles, and this was educational to say the least. I enjoyed to experience but I'm not sure I'm ready for funky beers, at least not any funkier than this one."
"The Cali-Belgique definitely lives up to its name...features of a west coast IPA and a Belgian beer are both present and blend together nicely. If you like both styles, give this one a try. Another great and distinctive offering from Stone!"
"Stone has done a great job again. I like many other people may be partial on the judging but I love Stone brewing. They are one of the only outside outstanding brews that we can get in the state of MT so I but it up when I can."
"Ok. Here's the deal: if you are a Belgian fan, and you also like a good IPA, you have got to give this a try. There are a few hopped Belgians out there now, and this is a good one. Pours well, lacy head, kind of a goldenrod color. It starts like a funky Belgian on the tongue, then the IPA character comes through, and the finish is smooth. Overall, a nice balanced beer. One of my favorites because it is very drinkable, and unique."
"Overall if I ever get a chance to try this with no yeast on the bottom (or with a best by date) I will re-review it. It still was a very solid offering and surprisingly hoppy and balanced."
"Overall: This IPA took me by surprise. The fruit notes in the smell and the taste are awesome. This a great all around IPA. Cheers!"
"Pours a translucent peach blonde with creamy white fluffy head that sticks all over the glass. The aroma is dominant Belgian esters, some sweeter fruity notes, slightly phenolic (getting a little band aid scent here). The hops don't really shine through like they would in the regular IPA (I believe this is the same beer but fermented with a Belgian strain), very masked and hidden in the aroma. Slugging this thing down, the taste at first comes as Belgian candi sugar, very nice but not too overpowering. The sweetness doesn't linger for too long, and a light bitterness follows through to the finish. Body's on the light to medium side, with a smooth, dry finish. Not sure how much of a fan I am of the style -I'm either in a Belgian mood or a hoppy mood, so this one doesn't really satisfy either BUT an excellent beer nonetheless."
"Overall a much better experience than the exploding Chouffee IPA, and I'd recommend this to anybody wanting to try a Belgian style IPA."
"Overall, it's not bad, but rather one dimensional. Not an IPA I'd look to get again."
"This brew poured out as a nice lightly hazy yellowish gold color. The head doesn't stick around too long really and the lacing is very minimal. The smell of the beer had lots of Belgian yeast aromas coming off of it and plenty of hops on the nose. The taste of this brew is really nice and soft feeling with some bubbles in there to give it a slight edge. The hops go really well in this brew also. The mouthfeel is pretty light but still had enough going for it to keep it alive. Overall this brew is really nicely done. Big fan of this one."
"The taste was good. I certainly can taste the Belgian influence int his beer that helps balance out the bitterness that we all like to see in an IPA. I certainly can taste the alcohol kicking through, and for some it might be a good thing. For me, though, I think it would be better if it was masked better."
"Overall, This beer might be my favorite offering from Stone. While it falls more on the American IPA side than an actual Belgian IPA like La Chouffe Houblon, it's just an amazing interpretation of the style. As it warms the Belgian side opens up a little more. My new favorite from stone. World class."
"Had the chance to try this again on tap at the Alamo Draft House. Belgian aspects were way more prevalent than in the bottle, and it was beautifully balanced between spicy tripel and hoppy IPA. This was damn enjoyable to drink. All of the qualities I picked up on in my previous review were there, but they were much more harmonious this time around."
"Overall: A very solid take on this style. Flavors are very forward and well balanced."
"O: great brew. Belgian twist makes it mellower than the OG Stone IPA maybe I even prefer it!"
"Overall: A well done Belgian IPA."
"pale golden orange colour, 1.5 fingers of sticky white head, some lace around the top of the glass. Smellis spicy belgian yeast, lemon and orange, citrus, fairly big malty presence behind all the hops here, fairly lively and quite nice. Taste is where most of the American influence is, big juicy hops, grapefruit and mango, lots of citrus, belgian yeast, bitter finish that is dry and spicy. Medium prickly carbonation, dry feeling, med-full body. Very nice belgian style IPA with a nice american twist, would revist gladly."
"I love it. Notice it has some flavors apparent which I also enjoy in Avery's hog heaven barleywine. Well done Stone, well done"
"Clean, well balanced characteristics make this hybrid a nice drink: complex yet easy."
"This tingly well balanced elixir is tasty and refreshing. The high quality ingredients are well balanced. A great American Belgian IPA by Stone."
"This beer is about the taste and smoothness. It is nicely hopped, but not overly so. The taste is strong, but not so much that it hangs around on your palate long after the last sip is gone. It did not pour with much head, which was unexpected. But the extremely smooth taste is worth it. I'm going to pour another."
"Full finger white head a bit rocky, fairly quick dissipation with some lacing. Clear Orangish deep gold, multiple streams of carbonation. Belgian yeast quite prevalent in the nose, a small bit of caramel and some bready malts, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, mouthfeel medium, good effervescence leading to a very dry finish. Damn close to style, well done."
"Boy, this is spot-on for what they were going for here - a West Coast IPA with the Belgian yeasty quality to give it some extra body."
"O- 22.6 oz of goodness. A interesting blend, will have to try again."
"Overall this is yet another outstanding beer by Stone. This bomber is on its last leg and I'm pretty upset I don't have another to open up. Pick one up if you see it. This bad boy is delicious"
"Two inches of off white head - some spotty lacing. Hazy copper/orange body. Very clean aroma. Smells of Belgian yeast, spices, cloves, meyer lemon. Mild cereal grain. Taste is hop dominant, but not overpowering. Some malty sweetness and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is refreshing, but a little thin. overall a solid beer i could see myself going back to again and again."
"O: An excellent brew, complex and interesting, but very well balanced, especially for a Stone brew."
"O -Did i just finish the bomber before the review? I have been eagerly waiting for this beer to come back around, although stone says its annual we here only see it toward the back end of summer i guess, {insert anger} I love this beer and it is in my top 3 for the style. eyelovethisbrewjustlikeEYEremember. give me the feel good drag, drink it and just jump..."
"Pours a bright, cloudy, golden-orange color with a small white head that disappears quickly. Scent hoppy with some Belgian yeast and a bit of citrus. Taste is quite delicious. Very different kind of Belgian style IPA. It drinks like a delicious Belgian strong pale ale with a hop backbone. Lovely Belgian yeast flavors, green apples, citrus, pine, butter, and a hint of meat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with buttery crisp finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a lovely Belgian-style IPA."
"Since I've been refining my review over the course of the bomber, I can reduce (what is clearly my longest) review to the following 1-1/2 words: Hoppy-Tripel Ale ...go get some!"
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a thin white head. Aromas of lime peel, orange and a bit of piney hops. Some breadiness and a bit of spice from the yeast. A kind of butteriness on the palate along with some citrus and a really nice long finish. This ber is light to medium bodied this beer went nicely with the pork chop I had at the brewery."
"If you always wanted to experience something like a Delirium Tremens but with extra Citric hopping added to it, than this is the beer for you."
"O: The beer has a good balance between the citrus and spicy flavors and is rather easy to drink because the bitterness isn’t overpowering. No traces of alcohol are detectable."
"Pours a golden copper color with a big two finger frothy head which leaves gobs of lace up and down the glass and shows visible carbonation. The aroma is of belgian candy yeast at the front end. A big bubble gum flavor followed by a citrus hop smell and a slight piney hop smell. The taste has a big bubble gum candied yest presence sweet and inviting. 8in the middle to the back end you get a nice citrus and piney hope bite to balance out the flaovr. A good blend a very inviting taste. The mouthfeel 8is velvety with moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer nice aroma to invite you in and a big nice taste to keep you wanting more."
"M: Appropriate to a middle of the road American IPA but a little heavy for a Belgian."
"Overall-Expecting more harshness from a stone IPA. This is very smooth and extremely drinkable. Great representation of the style."
"Drink- I can say it has probably been two years since I had this beer and at the time my palate couldnt pick out flavors or profiles. This is very well balanced and tame when it needs to be. The yeast and hops are well tempered against eachother and make for a slightly tart, fruity, hoppy drink. Quite nice."
"O: I am a huge IPA fan and this was just what I was looking for, something a bit different. Funky Belgian yeast accompanied by citrus hops make this interesting to say the least. Not world class in my opinion but very good!"
"This is an excellent beer by an excellent brewer."
"overall: nice example of a Belgian IPA, well-hopped and has the best of both worlds, decent abv as well."
"Overall: An exciting twist on an IPA. This is a brew that someone who doesn't necessarily like IPAs could enjoy. The tropical fruit hop profile was a welcomed change from the citrusy/piney hops that I'm accustomed to in American IPAs. Definitely recommended!"
"Poured a yellow/burnt orange with a big amount of fluffy white head which dissipated quickly down to nothing but a ring. The aroma is a combination of orange and lemon/lime citrus with a spicy/fruity, slightly sour, Belgian yeast. Any malt character is subdued by the big yeast aroma. Flavor is fruity orange and mango but countered with a peppery spice of yeast. Malts are present more now than in the nose giving the hops a caramel/toffee backing. The spicy, clove, character dies down for the finish leaving only fruity hops and a bitter bite. Yeast subdues a massive hop character which goes well over a light and creamy body."
"No substantial notice of the alcohol in this one. Drinkable for sure. One of the better experimental brews I've had and it works."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. While I don't think it's as good as Stone IPA, it's still a very good beer. I like what they did here and I recommend giving it a try."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice golden hue, with only a slight head, and not much in terms of lacing. Nose has plenty going on though. malt, hops, spice, and citrus. Flavor is a nice balance of grains annd spice with a subtly sweet note. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Notes: A great marriage of the Belgian and IPA styles. Maintains a great balance of flavors, showcasing both aspects, but not letting one trump the other. A noteworthy beer."
"Overall, this is a pretty great IPA, if it didn't cost almost twice as much as the regular Stone IPA, I'd get it quite often. Very good."
"Bombers now available at...what Albertsons!? Pours slight hazy gold with white head. Sweet belgian aroma of spice, banana and grapefruit. MInimal bitterness and hop aroma. Flavor is mainly Belgian Golden Ale, with nice citrus notes, maybe grapefruit, with mild hop flavor. Slight hop bitterness."
"O: If it wasn’t for that sourness on the back end this would be a go-to. As it stands, not quite right. Look for the Schneider Hopfen Weissen if you want a seamless melding of old world and new."
"O- Surprised by this one, very refreshing and fruity, really easy drinkability and well balanced overall, will definitely drink this one again."
"Overall: If you like Stone's hoppy end beers, I can think of any reason why you won't like this one. It is a great way to see how a Belgian yeast can alter the flavor of an IPA. Nice contrast to the Stone line of IPAs."
"O: A weird drink, but a good beer. I don't think I'd have it have again, because it's too odd-sour and dry. Try it maybe, I guess."
"Mouthfeel is quite dry, very smooth, and very drinkable. I will definitely have another one of these as soon as possible."
"O: Very good."
"Pours a pretty gold and looks very much like Stone IPA. An inch of head and nice lacing. I get mango and bright citrus and pine on the nose. Taste is spectacularly bright and sticky, as I expected. Slightly sweet on the front with notes of pineapple, mango and juniper. As it warms, the maltiness comes out. Effervescence is great and the finish is dry. Very drinkable. A lot like Stone's regular IPA but a bit more fruity. Delicious and very drinkable."
""
"This is an awesome beer! It has great balance and incredibly well-rounded aroma and flavor. I can't believe I've gone so long without trying this again."
"Overall a very nice interpretation of the Belgian IPA. I somewhat prefer Lagunitas Little Sumpin' Wild over this one."
"D: I like it and I might order again and maybe order a second. I would not buy a bottle again though."
"D - IMO very well balanced, the belgin style really comes out in this one as the Name says that it should. Not my first choice when it comes to a beer or my first choice when it comes to Stone's beer but worthy of trying."
"O-I wouldn't say that this is my favorite Stone offering but I appreciate the effort."
"D - With the light-medium body, ""low"" ABV, and the Belgian funk Stone's Cail-Belgique is very easy to consume, especially on those hot summer days."
"This beer is really enjoyable. It's interesting that Stone uses the same recipe that it does for its IPA, but just changes the yeast. It is amazing to tatse how much the yeast affects the flavour of the final product."
"This is a nice variation of a traditional AIPA."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, slight yeast, citrus hops, pine hops, and slight spice. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, pine hops, slight citrus hops, hint of alcohol, and slight spice. Overall, good aroma, blend, and body."
"Cali-Belgique is overall a bit more Cali in the hops and flavor than Belgique in the flavor and yeast. But the balance is admirable and, overall, accomplished with dexterity. Not easy to pull off, Stone has managed to do so with a fine combination of flavor-packed hops and fine yeasty strains to yield a terrific, accessible, and smooth beer. Very well done."
"Overall, I enjoyed this and next time will not wait a year to drink it."
"Nice beer high carbonation and easily drinkable. Don't notice the abv. This beer is hard to beat fresh."
"O: I like this beer. It has a different taste than the usual IPAs that I'm used too. I thought it was going to be too sweet, but was pleasantly surprised with the complex flavors. I'm glad Stone finally made their way to Missouri and I'll definitely try this one again."
"Poured a clear golden glow in my glass with an impressive 2 finger head. Smell is all about the hops, citrus and floral. I don't really smell the Belgique part of this one but it still smells delicious. The taste is a first for me. Very hop forward then finishes with the the spicy Belgian yeast. I really enjoyed this one because it was not like anything I have had. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with the good carbonation and overall very enjoyable."
"Overall a decent IPA, but not really outstanding."
"This is one of my favorite beers, regardless of style. I love dark porters and stouts, and this is anything but. However, I also appreciate IPAs and fruit beers and this satisfies those likes very, very well. Good stuff."
"Overall this is one to convert people to pale ales, quite refined."
"Pours bright, yellowish orange with foamy off-white head. Great head retention with lots of fine carbonation. Slightly hazy. A definite floral aroma from the Belgian yeast, nice and estery but well balanced with citric and grapefruit hop notes. Not quite as ""in your face"" hoppy as other Stone selections though. The flavor is also well balanced between a subtle but definite Belgian yeast character and smooth citrus hops. Pleasantly bitter and dry. Smooth mouthfeel. This is the model of what a good Belgian IPA can and should strive to be."
"Overall, a great representation of the style. Nice hops that mesh well with the spice and Belgian flavor. Wasn't crazy about the after-taste, but like I said, it's pretty subtle and doesn't take away from the beer too much. I would definitely pick this up again."
"O: good IPA overall, but not that complex. Not that it should be, but the hops completely dominate, and not in a way that's as good as Smuttynose"
"An excellent example of the style, stone once again rocks this one!"
"Finish: coriander on the palate and hops in the cheeks"
"Poured 22oz bomber in tulip glass; light amber color with nice tall head that does not last long but nice lacing; lighter than expected from a Stone IPA oily and flat with long astringent finish; too flowery in the aroma with smell of hay; bitter flowery taste to with strong alchohol; pretty dissapointing for a Stone brew!"
"Really a great beer, very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Nice -- very nice.. get two bottles."
"O: A real treat to have on-tap -- superior to the bottle in every way."
"This is a very good Friday night beer."
"O: A really easy to drink very good tasting beer. Still get tripped out by the style. When you get the two distinct character of two distinct styles becoming one."
"O- The first Belgian IPA I have tried, and certainly good enough that I will go back for more of this and others of the breed."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is grassy hops, Belgian yeast and some lemons. You can get a lot of Belgian character in the aroma but you can tell the base beer is an IPA. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of Belgian yeast notes as well as some orange citrus and grassy hops. Low to medium bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. The only thing I dislike about the beer is the carbonation, which is very high and prickly. Still, a nice Belgian IPA."
"(D)- A good take on a newer style. The belgian yeast takes center stage yet somewhat enhances the IPA characteristics fairly well."
"Ive been looking forwards to this brew for a while anyways it pours a dark honey,light orange hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger that slowly recedes to leave a slim layer of frothy head and lacing here and there,the smell is straight out belgian with aromas of pepperoni,salami,bready caramel malts and pungent floral hops,it has a nice medium bodied mouthfeel which is well carbonated and makes for easy quaffing and suprisingly on taste its exactly what the label says it is a nice cross of belgium and US with hints of bready belgian malts,piney american hops,hungarian salami and nicely rounded out with a whole pine cone hoppy bitterness and overall its a pleasure to taste a brew like this as fresh as it is cheers."
"Stone is finally making waves in Minnesota! Only took, what, like 8 years? But its here, at last!"
"This is not a beer that I would be quick to come back to, but I love Stone brewing, and this is a nice offering in the style."
"O - After a bomber of this, I have absolutely no complaints other than I wish I had more. Seriously, it’s so laidback for its style it almost doesn’t seem like a Stone brew, but it’s just as high-class as any other beer in their repertories. This re-affirms my high esteem for Belgian IPAs."
"Addition of Belgian yeast adds a unique twist to a typically good Stone IPA style. I'll revisit it."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 4.5/5; Taste 3.5/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"I must note my wife loved it."
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finishes extremely dry, and there is a strong presence of hop oils. I will definitely buy this again."
"O: This was an interesting adventure for me. I'm not really a fan of I.P.A.'s but I can definitely appreciate them, and this one is perhaps a bit more ""up my alley"" than some of the other offerings I've had. As usual, lots of hops, but not an overwhelming amount, and an interesting ""Belgian yeast"" characteristic which lends the brew a unique characteristic. Solid, but not exceptional."
"First off, I will say that the IPA is probably my least favorite style of beer. That being said, this one is a pretty good beer overall. There is a pronounced hops flavor to this, but not to the point of being overwhelming. The other flavors help balance it out, making this one of the better IPAs I have tried."
"Nice drink overall. Not one to dive into another, but a worthwhile foray."
"Overall quite sweet, medicinal, and generally mild. Hops take a back seat to the vague yeasty funk."
"This is great, great marriage of two styles that seem like they would clash, yet they compliment each other very well."
"O: A very nice Belgian IPA, but not the most interesting beer in this style at all."
"overall - very underwhelmed - i might revisit this one later but after this first impression i would not recommend it"
"Not my favorite style but an assertive hoppy well done Belgian IPA"
"Drinkability: Doesn't jive as well as I had hoped. Maybe Stone should have done more than simply take their standard IPA and add Belgian yeast. More finesse and thought was needed."
"O - This one isn't a bad beer at all. But with other great choices from Stone I'd go for other belgian ales first."
"22oz bomber into a pint glass. Pours a completely clear golden/darker oragne with nice fluffy white head. The head has nice retention and leaves some pretty good lacing down the glass. The aroma right away reminds me of a nice Belgian style beer. Spicy, fruity, lots of yeast aroma. And of course their are hops there as well. Mainly citrus hops. The taste like the smell reminds me of a Belgian beer right away but unlike the smell the hops stand out more in the taste. Citrus, spices, nice hop bite at the end. Pretty balanced not over hopped but enough to give it a nice bitterness. The aftertaste leaves a nice spicy and yeasty taste in the mouth with a hint of hops. The mouthfeel is good pretty medium bodied. Overall this is good. Not a high ABV so finishing the bomber isn't a problem. I'll probably pick this one up again in the future."
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, it's firmly carbonated and a bit light on the mouth, and the drinkability suffers just a little bit from the Belgian dominance. Overall, still not my favourite style. I wish there was more of a focus on the IPA side of the ""Belgian IPA"" equation."
"O - Very delicious beer with great Cali hop notes."
"Another beer I finally get to try with Stone in Minnesota. I know the Belgian IPA style is a little weird to start with, but this beer didn't quite hit the mark with me. It's like they took a middle-of-the-road Belgian ale and added more hops than usual."
"M & D - good balance of sweet and dry, hops and honey, with the yeastiness of a Belgian pale ale. Very good all around."
"This is a very enjoyable, easy drinking IPA. Sweet, mild, yet nicely bitter, I definitely recommend you give this a try."
"O: Overall, a pretty decent beer. The slight metallic taste and weak body hold it back, but it's still a fairly enjoyable beer."
"Rust colored with a bone-colored head that leave very nice lacings. It is very clear and vibrant. The aroma is an intriguiging balance of citrus and yeast. The taste is drinkable with a nice balance of sweet malt and acidic hops. Sourdough, banana, tangerine notes. A bright lively mouthfeel with lively carbonation, settles into a smooth and drinkable IPA. Overall, a beautiful looking, good tasting Belgian IPA."
"Notes: This moderate to medium-bodied brew has a creamy mouthfeel and a killer finish that rivals some of the best. Flavorful, and full of structure. This beer goes a long way. It's one that I will be buying again multiple times."
"A nice beer, but I am a little let down by the taste. The nose really hinted at greatness, but the taste was just a little too bitter and not sweet enough to hold up."
"Very clear gold color brew. Very nice sized, pillowy white head. Very sticky. Belgian candy scent, nice light malts. The taste can be summed up as Stone's take on a belgian IPA. Delicious, candy, pretty malty. Various fruits. Very well-blended hops. Pretty full-bodied, very sharp on the tongue. Well done."
"D: if you told me this was their IPA I'd be inclined to believe you. Alternatively if you told me that this was a dry hopped mead I'd also be inclined to believe that as well."
"Bottle. YES! Stone is now available in MN, happy day! Poured into a DFH tulip glass a hazy amber honey color with a 1 1/2 finger white head that slowly recedes and leaves lace as it does. Fruity aroma right off the bat and as I inhale deeper I get a nice hops aroma. Medium mouthfeel. Fruit like notes up front which I can only really describe as Fruity Pebbles, a mixture of orange, grape, and cherry. The hops fight back with a flare in the end with a long drawn out bitterness. No real hints at the alcohol in the nose nor the taste. The bitterness is nice but lingers on just a little too long for me."
"O- overall a nice belgian ipa its crisp tart has a nice hop bite with some nice belgian spice and fruit..its good but by no means is it a great representation of the style"
"I like it. There's a good IPA in there, but it has the Belgian twist that spices things up when an IPA seems too typical for the occasion. If you like Belgians, it's probably too bitter, sad for you."
"O - I was really impressed that this is as different from anything else that I have tasted. Stone has not disappointed me with a beer yet!"
"O: A tasty Belgian IPA, definitely worth trying if you're a fan of the style."
"22 oz. bottle, served in a tulip glass. Pours a clear, golden color with a frothy white head. Aroma is pale malts, citrus, pine, yeast, and a bit of spiciness (from the yeast and also maybe a hint of coriander). Flavor is pale malts, citrus, and fruity with a yeasty spice. Mouthfeel is light (a little watery), nice carbonation, bitter and a bit dry at the finish. Very drinkable beer, but not overwhelming."
"This beer is well carbonated on the toongue upfront, then finishes a little resiny. Nicely done."
"Pours a pale amber with a thick foamy head that slowly dissipates. The nose is complex with a characteristic Belgian phenol note, but it's subtly cut with a pleasant hop bitterness, a subtle hint of lighter fruits like apricot or mango. The flavor is more similar to an IPA than the aroma is, but there is still a distinct Belgian character to the front of the taste profile. The flavor lingers pleasantly in the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, perfect for a warm evening. Overall, this is a solid session beer."
"I really like this IPA. This is a very well-rounded IPA. Hops are very present (as with most things Stone puts out and as would be expected with an IPA) but they aren't offensive. The drinkability of this beer is very good. It's crisp bite and moderate carbonation make it a very good meal-drinking beer. I would recommend this for anyone new to trying Stone."
"On a hot summer Louisiana Day, this went down way too fast, great brew. Can't wait to try this on draft"
"A fun and relatively successful experiment, but this beer does too many things simply well, as opposed to doing anything perfectly. Good, but not great."
"Clear golden orange with a fine, creamy head. Bright, sharp, fruity Belgian-esque aromas. Sweet and spicy...lemon rind, pear, flowers, soap, and yeast. Smooth sweet hoppy bitterness blending smoothly into pale malt and peppery Belgian yeast. Orange citrus and mild pine needles, fruity esters, tea, bubblegum, slight medicinal clove notes. Medium bodied, snappy mouthfeel. I quite like this..."
"I was generally unimpressed with this beer. Although I like many of Stone's other offerings, this seemed to fall quite short. It was too sour and bitter to be overly drinkable, and while I enjoy a hoppy, bitter beer, these hops seemed to give it more of an ""off"" taste. If you're looking for a Belgian IPA, stick to La Chouffe or Le Freak."
"Drinkable yes in tart applications. The 6.9% keeps it manageable with a meal yet worthy of your beer time effort."
"Drinkabilty - A different twist on a ipa, belgium style. A nice combo of two styles. Its low enough in alcohol but really not something id drink daily. A nice change but ill stick with one of the other. A nice treat well done, another great drew form stone."
"MF: Drinks a lot like a white, but I think the bitterness (in this context) is off putting"
"D- Great drinkability. Interesting and easy to drink. Go Stone !"
"M - Smooth with a medium-light body."
"Overall- Another Belgian IPA, another slight disappointment for myself. I have yet to be impressed with any beer of this style, though this one was one of the better examples I have tried."
"Bitter orange peel and earthy hops are pronounced followed by a surprisingly suble yeast influence and a nice amount of burnt caramel. Overall it's a easy drinker but I have not been overwhelmed by it's flavor. There was a faint chalky taste but I don't attribute that to the beer."
"Easy to drink with almost a saison feel to it."
"From a bomber into a goblet. Golden apple clear with vigorous precipitating carbonation streams. Thin, clingy white head. Nose of hops and spicy coriander with a hint of mustard. Tastes of strong citrus/piney hops and coriander, like a hoppy saison. Sweetish malt with a light bitter finish. Mouth is crisp and watery, on the thin side but quenching, complementary of the beer. Drinkability is very good, pretty smooth and tasty; definitely sessionable."
"not easy to find, if you see it and haven't tried one -- pick it up."
"Not a good representative of the style. Pours a clear golden body with a big white head. The smell is a little hoppy with a sweetness and citrus twang to it. Hops seem subdued in the flavor as the citrus takes over. The middle contains a sour sensation right before a very mild Belgian yeast flavor takes over and finishes on a smooth note. There are better examples out there."
"Very light, frothy mouthfeel is misleading to the flavor of this beer. Definitely torn between the Belgian styling (whatever that means) and the hoppiness that I bought this beer for. I'm a fan of the Stone IPA, no doubt which is what led me to a bottle of this. From what I understand, that is what provides the malt for the Cali-Belg. No doubt it was enjoyable, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Very nice, I wish Stone would produce this in a sixer as I could go for a few more."
"I remember enjoying this much more previously. Perhaps it was mishandled since it was best before 4/22/11. Overwhelmingly saltiness makes for a more basic, strong IPA with only minor yeast qualities. I'm going to have to search for a fresh one on this as it didn't compare to Le Freak."
"d-drinkable, but not one of the best of the night"
"On tap at the Mellow here in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass a peach infused medium golden with a thinner white head atop,medicinal and citric aromas mainly.Flavors have a slight medicinal quality and deep fruity esters,a citric pine hop component comes into a lingering finish.Not a bad beer but Iam not a fan of the medicinal yeasty quality it has to it."
"Overall: As much as I hate the idea of the Belgian IPA (and I really don't like most Belgian IPA's that I try), this is a pretty good beer. It's not one I drink often because there are invariably better beers on the menu, but this is not bad at all."
"D- Once this gets to the right temperature, it become very good and very easy to drink. The taste up really reminds me paler Belgian beers and the finish is something you would expect from Stone. Definitely will pick this up again!"
"Overall, a pleasant surprise for me. I really enjoyed the interplay of the two flavors. Definitely something I will pick up more than once."
"D: Good. Not my favorite Stone, the mish-mash taste of fruit is overwhelming."
"D: Not much to say here, this is a good brew that goes down fairly easily. Nothing amazing, not really anything unpleasant either. Pretty standard for a Belgian style pale ale."
"Drinkability is good. Very pleasant and easy to drink."
"D: Its okay, but nothing special."
"D: A good beer, even if I wasn't a huge fan of the aroma/taste. Not sure I would pick this one up again for a while, and by the end of the glass I wasn't particularly interested in it, but definitely one to try."
"D: It's an interesting take on a classic beer style. Very drinkable."
"Great beer; was very happy to find it in one of the local stores. Would love to try this on tap."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with plenty of body. Overall a pleasant and certainly hoppy Belgian style ale."
"D: Very enjoyable beer - I could definitely knock down another one or two bombers in a sitting."
"Nicely done from the folks at Stone... They did a hell of a job blending the two styles where neither one seems to dominate..."
"Wow. Poured from a bomber into my 4 oz tasting glass. Nice coppery tint with mild lacing and mild head. Pleanty of carbonation going on. Smell the magic of hops and belgian yeast. Taste is plentiful hopaliscious with the piney citrusy bonus I hoped for. Not really getting too much Belgique but who's complaining. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability is limited due to the high ABV but will definitely seek out more!"
"Overall- i was skeptical of this brew cuz i've only had one belgian ipa hybrid and i rememeber not caring for it. but leave it to the people at stone to do a superb job. if you're a hophead or an ipa fan like myself i would recommend anyone to give this one a try."
"D: Very enjoyable. The addition of the Belgian yeast provides a nice twist to a typical IPA. Very very tasty brew here."
"Medium body and carbonation. Good stuff, but I've had better for the style."
"Cellaring a bit perhaps has made the yeast fall away,so we get an understated IPA, a nice bitterness: lemoney, very drinkable. I could drink this often, just short of astringency. Liked it, though not overally complex or extraordinary IPA. Lasting significant head."
"D: Very easy to drink. Light, smooth, and tasty. It had been a while since I've had this and I'm glad I picked it up."
"The mouthfeel is soft and mildly carbonated. The body is light to medium and very smooth. There is a middle of the road bitterness that is a total compliment to the flavors and never goes over the top. A really nice beer but I'd rather see it in smaller bottles. Frankly the 22 oz bottle gets boring to me halfway through."
"D: At nearly 7% ABV, this is a quaffable monster! Smooth, light, citrusy, west coast IPA hospitality smashed together with the delicate, spicy, herbal, sweetness of Belgian IPA yeasts. It's a match made in heaven for hop heads and ius a bomber I'd seek out in the future."
"Pours a medium gold color with a two finger head that quickly goes away. Lots of carbonation happening in this one. The smell surprised me- very nice! Caught the malt first, then on to grapefruit and passion fruit. A nice balanced smell of tart and sweet. I lose a little of the malt on the taste, but this is one nicely balanced beer that's very drinkable. Great lacing. At 6.9%, you can also have a 22oz bomber and not be completely buzzed afterwords. A nice beer from Stone- they have yet to disappoint me!"
"22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottle etching says enjoy by 3/24/11. Pours a very clear and bright golden/banana yellow with two fingers of frothy foam and good carbonation. Great lacing! The nose is rich and complex. A well balanced malt strikes first with classic Belgian ale notes of coriander and banana but there is an extra crisp element to it. It doesn't come across like a classic IPA would but I can definitely detect an element of hoppiness to go along with it. Medium bodied. Coats the entire palate but not in a heavy manner. Carbonation seems a bit low. The palate is very interesting. It comes across as more half Belgian golden ale and half IPA than does the nose. The hops stay with you the entire way but don't dominate at all. They give only a very mild resiny quality but manage to be bright and crisp without being overwhelmingly bitter. You still get enough coriander and malty sweetness to remind you of the Belgian influence. The finish is fairly clean and smooth. Very drinkable. This is a neat beer. Unique but not overly impressive. I'm not disappointed but I was expecting a bit more."
"O: I like that Stone has done something different here. I can say with sincereity that I prefer their standard IPA, though I'm certainly glad I picked this up. I don't know if I'll return to this one."
"Not overly frothy, which I'm glad of. Pretty drinkable, but it did get slightly boring after a bit."
"Cheers!"
"D: This is not my favorite style, yet it's still quite enjoyable."
"I generally don't like IPAs but I love Belgian beers so I was interested to try this one. I found it took the best qualities of each to create a truly unique beer. If you struggle to find IPAs you enjoy, like I do, you should give this one a go. Unless you hate Belgium."
"A mishmash of American and Belgian aromas that comes together quite nicely: orange zest, grapefruit, yeast, lemon, cloves, bubblegum, floral. A hearty dose of piney bitterness eventually allows sweeter elements back into play midswallow. This beer tastes quite fresh and fruity, but also with a defined clove and white pepper spiciness. A bit grassy as well. A very 'busy' beer, but it works very well. Goes down with alarming ease."
"D- Goes down easy and the spices make you come back for more"
"The beer pours a hazy yellow gold color with surprising good head retention and lacing. The nose was attractive and spice filled, showing light clove, honey, sandlewood and pepper. The flavor profile generally replicated the nose in this well hopped, very dry Belgian IPA. The beer comes across as a bit lean and light on the palate, though it certainly doesn't lack for flavor. Mouthfeel was fairly soft and full (from the cask conditioning one assumes), with a long, dry, bitterly hoppy finish. Drinkability was pretty good, and I have to say I was surprised by how good this beer was on cask. I think I probably enjoyed this more out of the firkin than I did on draft or out of the bottle. Impressive."
"Medium bodied with a nice balance of crisp light fruit and bitter/sweet citrus hops. Hints of pale malt and a weird bubblegum flavor make this taste like a hoppy Belgian golden ale. Very weird. Hints of apple, grape and pear blended with sweet citrus peel, pale malt and subtle alcohol sweetness. A bit too bitter to be a Belgian ale and to sweet to be an IPA. Dry finish."
"On tap at WL DT. Comes in a pint glass. Clear golden body with one finger white head that melts into solid cap of lace with sticky halo. Absolutely zero carbonation visible in body. Aroma is blend of candi sugar, menthol, and CA style bittering hops. Flavor is very similar. Belgian bubbles, fine and plentiful, distribute hoppy burn everywhere. Very flavorful. Candycane minty & sweet. Yum."
"Cheers!"
"I would love to try this one on tap"
"Pours a light golden pal amber with a two finger foamy white head. Nose is primairly citrus hops, grapefruit, slight pine. Taste is rich with piney/citrus hops upfront, good balance of malts in the back. Belgian yeast adds a remarkable piney/bready taste in the finish. Bitterness lingers into a dry, chalky mouthfeel. Tastes great and seems very drinakable. Perefct ABV."
"I get where they were going with this, hoppy-then-sweet-then-spicy, but it wasn't a genius idea. Then again, no one said it was. Overall good buy for hop heads. There's something about Stone thats their own. Anger? Possibly. If so, Its not a bad thing, just different. The hops used create a very, very, fresh taste, but then turns sweet and citrusy. Good buy in that ""Experimenting"" way. One of the best, fusions if you will, on the market."
"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery. The beer poured with a honey-gold color, with a tall, frothy, bright white head. The beer looked like it had a heavy, almost syrupy feel to it. Citrus, Belgian spice, and resiny bitter-sweet aromas on the nose. The smell is very vibrant and full. The beer itself is bitter-sweet, with heavy malted and spiced flavors forming a backbone for the dry, pepper spiced hops profiles. The beer has a sweet and sour balanced aftertaste, with some bitter hops giving the beer a dry finish. The beer is sweeter than most IPAs, and the Belgian funk makes this one difficult to drink lots of, for my personal tastes, at least."
"All in all, I'm a definite fan of this beer. I love their IPA and I'm a fan of Belgians, and this marries the two quite well."
"The flavor strikes the tongue with it's tart lemon notes, but opens up nicely into a floral bouquet of flavors. The alcohol is masked by it's heavy carbonation and tartness - overall it goes down without an ounce of aggression."
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. Didn't know exactly what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised that it was once a again, a great offering from the fellows at Stone."
"D: Not bad, but I'd certainly drink more if the belgian yeast didn't have an overwhelming effect on the beer. I guess that was the point of this one though"
"Bomber, no problem. Good BIPA, worthy of re-visitation."
"Cali-Belgique pours a nice golden color with a massive rocky head that leaves stubborn lacing all the way down. Smell is of Belgian yeast, and citrusy hops. Taste is of grapefruit and lemony zest with a belgian yeast background. Mouthfeel is fresh and crisp, excellent carbonation. Drinkability is very high, almost too high. I could sip on this masterpiece till the sun rises. Love Stone!!!"
"D - complex but well executed Belgian IPA."
"D - Slightly alcoholic tasting, considering only 6.9%, that's a bummer for me."
"Accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: combine the styles of a Belgian and West Coast IPA. Hop profile is distinct on the front and back end while maintaining a palpable mouthfeel and overall flavor profile. Hides the alcohol extremely well; one of the more drinkable IPAs in my opinion. It seems that this beer led Stone in the direction of brewing techniques outside the US (Saison du Buff and their 14th Anniversary) not to mention their prospective brewing collaboration with a Belgian brewery. While the beers that followed were met with much more mixed reviews (I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed the 14th Anniversary), it is safe to say that this brew is approachable for all types of BAs."
"D: great for the abv. no bite at all."
"D: While beers of this style are fairly plentiful, this one from Stone is distinguished by its loyalty to the West Coast IPA flavor profile. Belgian yeast notes are incorporated with a practically seamless touch, frequently detectable but never crossing the line to aggressive. This beer also deserves a nod for being of typical IPA strength, unlike so many others of the style that end up as less approachable double IPAs."
"D: I'm not the biggest Stone fan in the world, but I know a good beer when I taste one. I appreciate the Brewery's disciple, attention to detail in sticking to style, and for flat out making a wonderful tasting brew!"
"i was disappointed by this. not an outstanding effot from Stone and doesn't compare well to other BIPAs. maybe my bottle was bad. had this on tap at the Ruck in Troy, NY and it was much much better, fresher."
"Pours a nice pale yellow color with a big fluffy white head with good retention, that left good lacing as it fell. The smell is nice and hoppy, and there are also citrus notes such as lemon and orange zest. The taste is a nice bitter citrus hop flavor. the hops are the star of the show, but it is nicely balanced. The taste of this is really nice. The mouthfeel is good. It has a medium body with very good carbonation. It goes down really easy, and it also feels a bit creamy. Drinkablility is good as well. These are very easy to drink. They go down smooth, and leave you wanting more. I would definitely drink this beer again. Good job stone. Cheers."
"Overall, this wasn't the best Stone offering that I have tried. I like Belgian IPA's, but this one seemed alright, nothing really special, which caught me off guard for a Stone. Can't say it was bad, but I don't think I'll get this one again."
"Amber with golden highlights, lively carbonation and solid one finger head. Smells like belgium yeast and fruity hops. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, hops and carmel. Bitter finish. Doesn't taste bad but just not what I was hoping from this beer. Its like the beer doesn't know what it wants to be."
"This is a nice drinking ale, I like the cali-belgiqueness of it."
"D: One of the, if not the best Belgian IPA I have tried. Which isn't saying much since I haven't had many. Still, I don't think this style is prevalent in Belgium as much as it is here; American beer drinkers love their hops, in any style of beer. Still, this one is the most easily drinkable and balanced one of this particular style that I've had."
"Very nice malty aroma to it, about a one finger head.Very surprised at the carbonation when I first poured it. When I tasted the first thing that hit me was the sweetness of the malts but then kicked right in with the hops and left a nice fresh hoppy after taste. Bottom line? Loved it. Stone does not disappoint."
"A belgian ipa with a stones twist, making it hoppy as all hell but while having that belgian taste most people familiar with belgians will recognize. Smell is sweet with a finish of hopp. Pours gold with a thin white head and tastes really hoppy. This is one of their better brews."
"D- this is a good one. When done properly, I really can enjoy a good Belgian IPA...and this one is done properly, as you'd expect from Stone"
"Very good beer."
"Felt medium, well carbonated with a creamy finish. Bit of a pine taste after swallowing. Very tasty beer."
"D: Great all around Stone brew, a nice version of west coast IPA and Belgian influences. I find this flavorful brew to be a nice and easy drinking BIPA and deep earthy flavors are welcoming."
"D: Really solid Belga-ipa. Excellent fresh, I'll have to get my hands on it while it's still fresh as it is."
"Overall I absolutly love this beer and it is my mission to spread its wonder to all"
"The aroma is mild with some up-front floral hops and belgian yeast character. The flavor is a nice merger of styles. The bitter and floral hop flavor is strong and leads the flavor, but it gives way smoothly to a slight malt flavor and clean Belgian yeast. A little bit of green apple tartness shows up as it warms. Mouthfeel is dry crisp and clean. Very balanced and drinkable."
"Drinkability- Oh, stone... why are you so drinkable? 4"
"Hops and citrus start it off and it ends with a nice bitterness."
"I have (and hope) an inkling this bottle may be infected or light-struck as this beer is just a complete disaster. Almost undrinkable due to the flavor imbalance."
"I can't see drinking too many of these either. It's just too thick and the taste is enjoyable but nothing to force you back to the glass for another sip over and over again."
"overall, great beer, expensive though, worth a try, prolly not with the price though when you can just get Stone's normal IPA"
"This was a good belgian ipa, with good balanced flavor, very refreshing and easy to drink."
"This is a beer that looks marvelous in a glass and is an complex melange of flavors that keeps the whole bomber an interesting experience."
"D- Very pleasant, modest abv, and good for any occasion."
"This is a fine brew, a complex combination of sweet and bitter that just sings to the mouth and the spirit of beer. Highly delicious and highly drinkable. Get it if you can, hopheads, to expand your appreciation of what uninhibited yeast can do to hoppy bitterness."
"Taste, wow. This is a perfect blend of IPA and belgian ale. I have no idea how they did it. The fruit/spice is up front, with the hops kicking in later. Stone, you've done it again. I will definitely be trying this again soon."
"Pours a very hazy yellowish color with some orange tinged and a big foamy 3 finger head with the best lacing. Aroma is big time piney grapefruit with fruity esters coming through. Has a floral component that keeps this fresh and very lemony. Big lemon pone flavors with a fruity belgian ester that is nice. Balanced malts but hop forward with some citrus freshness. Very nice. The mouthfeel is silky smooth although you know it's got great carbonation. Really this is a great food pairing beer. It's got a freshness that plays well with lots of fish and chicken dishes."
"This beer is quite good, though not as good as other Belgian/IPAs I've had (... Chouffe) i would drink this again."
"D: I like this beer the more I drink it. Although I would tire of it after two bottles or so."
"A great IPA!"
"Excellent drinkability, especially for a hot Summer day. Absolutely made my list to try again."
"Very crisp, medium bodied."
"Very slightly hazy golden straw color with a slight hint of orange. I had a finger of very light tan head after a fairly relaxed pour. The hops smell stood out more when I smelled it in the bottle. Once in the glass, the hops took a backseat to funky banana, caramel, bubblegum, and clove. The hops come across as a fruity mango/pineapple like aroma. There's a hint of funky earthiness in the taste that reminds me of a saison. Pepper notes make there presence known as well. Goes down pretty easy, but there is a grassy bitterness in the finish that hangs on a little too long. This is pretty good, but as far as this style goes, I have a man-crush on Raging Bitch."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, very refreshing. Might make a good session beer, but would likely fatigue the tastebuds after a while."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Split the 22 oz bomber but could have easily enjoyed the entire bottle myself."
"My friend showed up with a fresh Growler from stone. Poured a yellow amber color with white head. I hadn't had this beer in a while, but the smell took me right back. Strong earthy and floral hop aromas. Taste the same with a bit of spiciness and a good dose of fruit/citrus. Good mouthfeel any very drinkable. The alcohol is very well hidden in this. I enjoy this one over raging bitch anyday. Ill usually buy this whenever I can. Good shit."
"Drinkability: pretty tasty and it has some refreshing character. I would have this again."
"A++ would buy again."
"pours a clear golden color with a good sized white head. Nice strong lacing. At first smell I pick up a ton of hops but after while they become overpowered by the belgian yeast. Once I pull away and go back to it I get a blend of both. It's citrusy and piney, almost like someone poured a tripel into an IPA. The taste is vastly different from the smell. It's unlike anything I've had. At first I'm a little confused then strong grapefruit breaks through and an almost grassy undertone. Mouthfeel is much thinner than I would have expected or wanted. It's also a little flatter than I would have liked as well. Drinkability is decent. This is a different beer and I'm glad I tried it. It's only my second in the style and has me intrigued enough to try others, but I don't know how much I'll be going back to this one."
"Overall this is a miss for me. Perhaps freshness was an issue, given the sensitivity of highly hopped beers. Maybe this is a world class example of the style or maybe it just isn't for me."
"A well-constructed beer, and a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, a great beer and one of the best Belgian IPA's. Really enjoyed the Stone creativity here. Dangerously drinkable. Highly recommend. Available here in TX. Rotation - this will make the hop rotation for sure [R;Y]"
"D- Wow. I almost forgot how much I love Stone's creativity. I had no problem drinking the entire 22oz. bottle by itself. Needs no food, shines on it's own."
"an american distinctly. pours clear with a yellow/orange hue and a head of two fingers. american foam. not tight. not much lace either. nose of belgian sugar and pineapple. palate of something along those lines but the sugar has a plastic resin quality with the hops. grit hush quality and apricot. hoppy but muted by a abnormal sweet that doesn't add but disorients the palate. i love this style. i am sympathizing that maybe the bottle was infected. but it was complete average. worst stone i've had."
"D - another solid IPA by Stone. This was a good idea with even better execution. If I could get Stone on a regular basis, this one would be a constant in my fridge."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow with a giant white foamy head. Large head that leaves great lacing. The smell is strong with citrus,bread yeast,and sweet malt. The taste is very refreshing with a crisp bitter hop flavor along with bread yeast,citrus flavors,and some sweetness,malt? The m/f is light with the plentiful flavors mixing well. This is another great beer from Stone."
"Decent beer, though I was hoping for a little more influence from Belgian yeast."
"Nice golden color with a creamy head. Good spiderweb lace. Steady flow of carb bubbles coming off the bottom. Smell is an interesting mix of citrus and spice. The pepper comes through strongly. Taste follows the smell. The pepper spice is the most prominent but there somehow remains a citrus backbone. Good full body. Another strong brew from stone. They never dissapoint."
"Decent brew for a Belgian style IPA. Nothing spectacular, but typical high quality from Stone."
"Poured from a bottle with a wonderful rocky off white head and had a beautiful copper amber color. Smell was grassy and herbal hops with a funky earthy fruity belgian yeast. Taste is very unique, definatey not your typical stone IPA but there is an amazing balance of hops with the belgian yeast. Very different and unique beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety very much like a belgian saison. This is a very nice and smooth beer very drinkable."
"I thought it seemed somewhat close to the Stone/Victory/Dogfish Head collaboration, Saison du BUFF."
"Drinkability: A very good beer and a very well-balanced IPA. If I didn't know this was brewed by Stone, I would have guessed that it had come from a Belgian brewer. Yet another very good beer from stone."
"Pours a pale golden colour with a finger of white head and some lacing. Smells of lots of citrus and pine hops with some amount of the Belgian yeast. There is less of a Belgian type flavour to this one as other Belgian IPA's, more of regular IPA to my taste. Carbonation level is good."
"D- Very easy to drink. I drank on 22oz bottle as I wrote this review, and could definitely go for another."
"D - The ABV makes this one sessionable...I was able to enjoy a pint and could of had more but wanted to try something else...I love the hops in this one (expected from Stone)...the flavors lean more towards the IPA side but the Belgian style is not absent in this beer"
"D - Very drinkable, but at 6.9 ABV, not too dangerous. I split a bomber with my girlfriend but could have easily killed the 22oz by myself. A wonderful melding of the best of Stone and the best of Belgium!"
"D: I enjoyed this beer. It's light but flavorful and very easy to drink. There is a great balance between its sweet Belgian side and its bitter west coast IPA side. The body could have been a little more substantial, but this takes little away from the beer."
"Not sure what I was expecting with this. I was pleasantly surprised. Thanx DK. Poured into a St. Bernadus Goblet,clear Honey colored pour with a foamy ivory head that leaves significant lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose is...interesting, earthy, some Belgian yeast character, spicy hops, Grapefruit rind. Nice bitter sweet flavors, a hint of belgian yeast, caramel, grapefruit and pine. Fruity bitter finish. Active carbonation. Delicious beer. Drinks very well."
"But that aftertaste will be expressed in the mouthfeel rather than the taste. Since it is the feel in the mouth after the quaff that I don't appreciate. But I do return for another taste, willing to suffer the pith in order to once again experience the melody of this brew."
"D - While I like this beer, it's not something I want to have very often. One of these a month would be plenty."
"It has a aroma of a typical Belgium ale, it has the scent of banana and bubble gum. The taste has a good flowerily hop taste and luckily, the Belgium yeast does not completely carry through into the taste. Overall, a cool variation on the American IPA."
"D- I love IPA's and I like Belgian Trippel's, however, I cannot explain my discontent for blending the two I find them not enjoyable at all..."
"D: I found this to a rather enjoyable IPA for someone who doesn't necessarily like IPAs. In the end, this beer is what it is--a hop-forward beer. But the addition of Belgian yeast has given it an additional element other than the malt alone to balance out the bite and bitterness. I congratulate Stone on making an IPA that I would look forward to drinking again."
"Drinkability - good IPA, barely notice the alcohol, although this is a little lighter in ABV than what I've had or like to enjoy anymore. Anyway, well balanced, good take on belgian influence, but maybe a touch dry on the finish. Still, this is one I'd have again - Stone is truly royalty when it comes to specialty ales."
"Nice nose on this one, a little of the yeasty character creeps out from under the massive juicy hops. I take issue with the Cali-heavy approach, but it definitely doesn't make this a bad beer even if I would be hard-pressed to differentiate this from some of the other IPAs from Stone. Would definitely put this above Raging Bitch, too much wheat in that one for me, and looking forward to see how it compares to the Houblon Chouffe chilling in my fridge."
"Served from tap into a tulip. Pours golden yellow with a one finger white head. Maintains phenomanol lacing throughout. The aroma is of fruit and malt with a slight hint of hops. The flavor is of malt, grapefruit and subtle hops. It had a light with mdeium carbonation. Overall this was very nice and smooth. The grapefruit flavor combined with the malt balanced this brew very nicely giving it great drinkability. I will be drinking this again given the opportunity."
"would highly recommend."
"Pours a hazy, amber color. 2 finger, white head which laces the walls. Aroma is very good. Citrus, piney, slight orange and yeast aroma. From the smell, I cannot wait to taste it and it does not dissappoint. Smooth feel in the mouth with lots of carbonation. It's a little sweet up front in the mouth , goes down fairly smooth, then the hops kick in with a little bitterness, but not overpowering. Very well balanced.It's very drinkable too. Excellent beer. I wish that I got more than one bottle!"
"I could have several of these over the course of a day and be happy. I can't believe how much I liked this brew. Stone is clearly no joke in the brewing world."
"D: Pretty good. I prefer AIPAs but this is a nice change from hop bombs. If you want an AIPA this is not for you. If you want something delicious and different then seek this out."
"Not a bad beer... but it's not particularly exciting either. I expected more hop character. Orval or Westmalle Triple provide more hop interest."
"D: Goes down easily, nicely blended, not too filling, and has a nice kick to it."
"Quite drinkable, but not as a session beer."
"D: This is a fantastic brew. Nice belgian flavor, and I big hop kick that you would expect from Stone. For 6.9% ABV, the alcohol seems non-exsistent. Another great offering from Stone."
"The citrus and biscuit dance well together and the spice does well with both. Coriander and some sweet gum. A bit of a butterscotch finish, but I think that was the tap."
"Stone Cali-Belgie shows off the complexity yeast adds to a beer. With that one change, Stone has taken their IPA and turned it into a whole other animal. The Belgian yeast does a beautiful job smoothing out the hops. Like a typical Belgian IPA, the lip smacking quality of a hoppy brew is put in check. The hop flavors are allowed to shine, while the bitterness is kept well under control. Props to Stone for creating another tasty offering."
"Drinkability: Better drinkability than Raging Bitch, another American BIPA, it's tastes don't wear you down nearly as much."
"Interesting IPA with some fruity complexity."
"Found at Whole Foods in Sacramento off Arden."
"D - Great drinkability from this one, I'm a little peeved I waited so long to finally pick up a bottle, but it's still worth it. Very excellent."
"D: An eminently drinkable Belgian IPA."
"Verdict: Cali-Belgique is a tasty beer, and the best Belgian IPA I've tried yet. The combination of Belgian yeast and west-coast hops is interesting and pleasant, though I have to say I personally prefer the ""normal"" Stone IPA."
"Overall- Really a terrific beer in my opinion. Belgian yeast really plays well off of the American hops. Stone I hope you make this at the very least a perennial seasonal release, if not a year round."
"Overall, an interesting, if a bit unbalanced, offering from the boys at Stone."
"Thanks to the auspices of Mr. Ohoove for this treat, the color of this goodie is clear golden amber with a nice thick white foam and chunky lacing. The aroma is a clovey yeast and herbal hop, firm and ""tasty"". The flavor at room temperature offers orange citrus bite and malty clove. There's some thick cereal grain and deep prune in a medium-plus bodied brew. It's a bit viscous with signs of alcohol in the flavor. Sharp grapefruit rind, and a dry rye effect, all very complex with modest drinkability. Very nice."
"taste -when u go in a take a slip its like fruits! citrus bursting before u even drink it!! Super smooooth!! no alcohol can be found! even at 5.6% abv. flavorful! awesome beer! if u dont like IPAs this is the IPA to taste! its a cali- belgian style idk what that mean but the bottle says its a California style beer Stone with hints of belgian flavor guessing Hefes where the fruit citrus come in to play..."
"D- Overall, Stone Cali-Belgique is a solid beer that is definitely worth a repeat purchase. Hightly recommended!  "
"This is only my second experience with a Belgian style IPA. The other was Flying Dog's Raging Bitch, which I loved. Stone's version is less aggressive. I am beginning to love this beer style."
"Quite an enjoyable beer with many of the traditional aspects of this style and those it comes from. Certainly worth a try, it is great to enjoy on a summer evening."
"YUM"
"D-really impressed with this beer; to be honest, I find it a little more drinkable than the belgian versions of belgian ipas, maybe its the lower alcohol, but its really good; a 22 oz bomber is easy to finish"
"Stone's only (?) ale brewed with a different yeast (a Belgian one!) --- this is otherwise the standard IPA."
"This beer was amazing and unexpected. I am used to being shocked by Stone, but this beer was a very pleasant surprise. A traditional looking IPA except that it is a little light in color. Clear. Tall rocky head that left sculpted concentric rings. Amazingly the yeast aroma really battle with the hops in the nose. On first sniff I was confused. My curiosity aroused. Very spicy as well dominated by cloves. I have never had a beer with such overt clove aroma. Is it the Belgian yeast that does this? The taste was all Stone IPA but more. The brew tasted like a blend of caramel malts, citrusy hops and a fruity taste. The fruit was pineapple-mango-peach-tangerine. Very intriguing. Then the hops wrestled the aftertaste away again. A fresh grassy sort of hops. Very fresh like a wet-hopped beer. The body was medium light with average carbonation. Call the texture soft to oily. Overall a great and refreshingly different beer. It's not your traditional IPA. I give Stone top marks for attempting this unique hybrid and pulling it off."
"One of my favorite beers of all time. I first had this beer about two years ago and I am just now finally reviewing it. Belgian IPA's are one of the newest, yet best styles of beer around today. Cali Belgique does not only set the standard for this style it almost makes it impossible to replicate. From a bottle it pours a nice and golden with a two inch white head. This beer not only satisfies the quench of belgian beer fans but hop heads as well. The aroma is complete with a belgian/pine combination. I started out as a novice beer drinker, soley focused on Belgian styles but once my pallet for IPA's devopled this beer was able to my beer needs from all angles. Drink this beer and appreciate all it represents. Dare to try another Belgian IPA once other Brewers attempt such a style. Cheers."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the finish is medium full. This is a unique beer. I like the flavor of the beer."
"Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Clear, bright yellow pour with nice fluffy white head and decent lacing. All Belgian in the nose. Lots of spice, lemon, grass and hints of banana and bready yeast. The taste is much the same with a great balance between the bitter hops and sweet malt. Exactly what I expected, with the best characteristics of a Belgian, expertly infused with that classic Stone IPA flavor. Highly drinkable with a nice, crisp, clean, dry finish. I live an hour from Belgium, and have to say that the US craft brewers are giving the Belgians a run for their money. A great American interpretation of the style!"
"Mouthfeel is medium full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"the Belgian-ness of this beer is even more hidden in the taste. obviously hop-forward but very very balanced. the esters provide sweetness to keep your palate in check, but it all works. in comparison to WildDevil or Le Freak, this is my favorite Belgian/west coast IPA combo. i would think this is a perfect ""cross-over"" bottle for those looking to bring in non-beer drinkers. flavorful, light, exceedingly drinkable. i am very thankful that my parents brought this one to share with me, but next time i'll buy one all for myself."
"but the flavor is good. Strong hop presence that cuts through followed by agood amount of spice and bready presence."
"Drinks very easy, a nice take on the style"
"D - love the style, just like this one. a bit too fruity (especially heavy on the lemon/citrus) and thin...not bad at all but there are better Belgian IPA's out there."
"This is a good beer. I like the concept, and IPA combined with a farmhouse style ale, american style. Pour is nice, a good amount of carbonation and bubbly on top. Once the foam subsided, giving the beer a taste, you definitely catch the hops, immediately, I would expect nothing less from Stone. Strong taste, good amount of bitterness following up the fruity/hoppy mixture. Good amount of fruit/lemon flavor, and you get that light almost vanilla flavor present in a farmhouse ale. All in all a good combination, I think it was balanced well so all flavors come through equally. I think they did it right, I wouldn't change anything with this combo, overall a very solid beer and concept. It's probably been done before but its the first time I've seen it."
"Very interesing brew that stone has offered us here, letting this one warm up a little really helps balance the belgian into the ipa. I can see myself dinking this again in the future."
"I was very nicely surprised by this beer. I don't drink a ton of Belgian beer so I can't speak to that directly but I loved this variation of an IPA. Aromatically it held my attention very well with lots of fruit and hops. I got a bit of apple right through to the taste followed by just enough bitterness to keep it in balance. I am very happy when a beer leaves me thinking about the next time I will taste it."
"Cali-Beligique/Belgie is nice experiment, one that I am glad to have tried. Good beer. I wouldn't buy this very much if it were available to me but I can think of some dishes to pair this beer with that would be pretty kick-ass."
"D- An interesting beer; easy drinking like a good IPA with a little Belgian funk in there."
"D: Very enjoyable, complex and balanced; there's a lot going on this beer that sems to work pretty well - moderate abv too. Just get a little full (and taste-bud-shock)."
"D: Moderately drinkable, the bitterness was good, but left me wanting more. It almost is like a stone IPA with a Belgian attitude. I would almost rather it be a Ruination with the Belgian attitude. Very delicious nevertheless."
"D- wow, what a difference changing the yeast can make. this seems to have very little in common with the regular stone IPA. one of the better examples of a belgian IPA, this one is also on the lower end of the spectrum as far as ABV goes. check this one out."
"Houblon Chouffe on tap redeemed the concept of the Belgian IPA for me, which had dropped off over the past year. Raging Bitch was, ultimately, a sweet mess, local brewpubs followed suit, and the other random attempts I'd tried (save the wholly different Wild Devil, which is awesome, but simply an IPA with brett in it) fell flat. Cali-Belgique is the beer that originally got me excited about the style, and finally returning to it again (and fresh!), I can see why. It's a better IPA than our recent east coast darling, Larry, and the Belgian influence just makes it deeper and tastier. The brewers at Stone are geniuses."
"Don't get me wrong, it's a good beer, but I think Raging Bitch married the Belgian pale and American IPA elements a little better. Not a bad beer, but I was hoping for more."
"mouthfeel is luscious. too drinkable. i can only wonder what it tastes like 'fresh' !"
"Drinkability: The balance of flavors here really does it for me. Not a complete bitter bomb, but a well crafted, creative IPA. Count me as a fan."
"Drinkability: As I mentioned earlier this beer is well balanced and therefore I could drink about two bombers of this fine brew. Many of the IPA's that I have tried are not well balanced and therefore lose their enjoyment about one glass in."
"Nice combination of IPA characteristics and Belgian yeast. A real nice brew."
"Was looking for something else, they didn't have it, got this instead and it turned out to be a nice surprise. I must admit this is only my second foray into this style and I continue to be intrigued. Pours a bright and slightly hazy straw color. Decent sized white head that recedes slowly leaving some nice lacing behind. Nose is true to the label, a distinctly Belgian scent with some hops mixed in. Taste follows suit, Belgian yeast up front with a nice hoppy bitterness in the finish. I wasn't blown away but definitely a good drinkable brew, I'd be pouring another one if I had a second bomber."
"D - I'm pretty much torn on this one as I like Stone and Belgian IPAs but the taste doesn't make me love it like other Belgian IPAs don't get me wrong its a good beer but not as good as an authentic version worth a try though if you see it"
"Pours a clear gold with a thin white head, big clumps of lace. Smell: floral, spicy, lemon zest, a little musty grain, soft pear and a hint of pepper. Taste: spicy and lightly tropical, peppery + background clove, citrus peel, a little cantaloupe in the back of the finish. Everyone seems to be making west coast hopped Belgian IPAs, but this is a good one. Best by 7/10."
"D: Very good."
"Had this cask version made with palisades hops when visiting Stone. Nice head retention and lacing off the pour top a nice pale gold. The nose had a nice hay character to complement the fresh fir notes from the hops, even some faint horse blanket notes. This version finishes really clean. My gf had the std. cali-belgique off the tap and this one had a much cleaner hop character and mouthfeel. If I had any qualms, I'd say the mouthfeel was a little thin, even for being on cask."
"The taste is unique. The beer is rather dry up front but finishes rather wet. Taste is malty and hops and oh yes, lots of spice. Overall, a very unique beer and quite tasty."
"Final thoughts. This is a miss for me. The only other beer I've had of the style was Allagash Hugh Malone, which I had on tap and thoroughly enjoyed. Perhaps freshness is an issue, given the sensitivity of highly hopped beers -- I did buy it unrefrigerated. But of course, until we have bottle dating on every bottle, we'll never know (and so on and so forth). Or, maybe this is a world class example of the style, and maybe it just isn't for me."
"Overall a good beer from stone that represents the two styles well."
"Raise an IPA in Belgium and this is what you get, makes sense."
"D - Another interesting and tasty offering from Stone. Their IPA being one of my favorites, it was nice to try it with a twist. I think I still prefer the original, but I'm glad I tried this and would try it again."
"Overall: A unique brew, but definitely paying tribute to traditional Belgium IPAs."
"D: I could drink this all night. It makes me wish I had bought more at the Greenlife in Asheville. Big ups to Asheville!"
"Very tasty and easy drinking and pulls off a very nice combo of styles in this relatively newly established hybrid slot."
"Strong aroma is hoppy and evergreen with a firm, sour citrus overtone, a mixture of lemon and orange with just a whisper of lime. It pours an average golden amber with a decent off-white head, but appearance is this beer's weakest suit. Flavor is fairly hoppy, but pleasantly sour citrus dominates with orange and lemon and a little bit of lime. Texture is exceptionally smooth, yet tingly and fizzy enough for a beer. Recommended to all hop-heads."
"Mouthfeel, very complex, you get bits of honey, grass, sweet, but hops is still at the forefront. F'n yum. Price is ouch. What'd I pay $10 for a pint/imperial pint? Worth it? You know it."
"Another winner from Stone, and I really liked that they didn't feel the need to have a huge ABV to provide a huge flavor. It was very drinkable and enjoyable, and I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall this is a very good representation of the style. I like the fact that the ABV is a bit lower than some of the other prominent representatives. That means I can have more than one of a very enjoyable, balanced, and complex brew."
"-Oelergud"
"D: A good beer, but not one of Stone's best. A little light on the hops and, from my perspective, quite tame for a Stone beer. However, very drinkable. Neither hopped-up as most California IPA's or as funky as most Belgians."
"What's wierd is that I tasted this a couple of times in 2009 and liked it -- I wonder if this bottle is a little bacterial. Came from a store cooler in San Diego."
"D) A well crafted hybrid. I'd have another."
"This is a fun one to drink. The taste volleys between Belgian and IPA, unable to settle on one or the other."
"D: just as high with any other ipa I enjoyed this one alot and will get it again when I see it."
"This beer is pretty bomb. I wish it wasn't so expensive."
"Overall a very good version of the style. Tons of flavor, very broad spectrum of tastes."
"Certainly a throw-down to the Belgian brewers making IPAs - Stone one-upped them here, using the Belgian yeast in addition to the customary in-your-face hops. The fruity, candy-sugar notes from the yeast played nicely against the assertive hops. Although a little under 7% abv is nothing to sneeze at, this beer seems even bigger."
"Notes: Nice approach to a Belgium IPA, almost close to setting a trend to what some standard interpretations of this style may turn to in the States. For instance this one feels very close to the Raging Bitch from Flying Dog, which is another great offering."
"This was definitely a unique brew. I'm pretty sure it's my first Belgian IPA, so I didn't really know what I was in for. Thanks again, Toby, much appreciated!"
"This is very enjoyable. Simple, and not over the top. Something that I would recommend."
"D - Tasty. A nicely balanced version of the style."
"sampled at Rustico, Alexandria, VA"
"Overall this is one of my favorite Belgian IPAs and certainly one that has everything you would expect from Stone. Another solid beer from Stone. Recommended."
"Drinkability - This is a very quaffable Cali/Belgian ale and proof that Stone can offer subtle quality when needed. This one grew on me as I went."
"D - This beer is very drinkable at 6.9% ABV I can see this one sneaking up on you if I had more than 1 bomber in the cellar."
"When reading the name ""Cali-Belgique IPA", Cali hints at a California IPA and Belgique says that it has an undeniable Belgium influence. In this case both are correct, a carefully selected Belgium yeast strains differentiates this brew from the standard Stone IPA. This brew pours a golden amber color with large fluffy white head that likes to stick to the glass. The nose is definitely is reminiscent of the Stone IPA with a slight hint of a Belgium sour. Big hop notes lead to floral aromas with a slight hint of citrus. As you would expect the palate is loaded with hops, however, the Belgium yeast cuts some of the bitterness away and adds some lemon citrus notes rather than grapefruit. This is an excellent twist on a big IPA, one that hop heads will really enjoy"
"D: Went through my glass fairly quickly, but I don't know how much I could drink. Realistically, probably no more than the bomber, but I was satisfied after my one glass."
"This style is relatively new to me, but I'm loving the interplay of Belgian yeast & American hops. Not my favorite example of the style, but still really enjoyable."
"* Note: Haven't (but will) reviewed the 2010 bottling yet, but have tasted & it doesn't approach the '09."
"Mouthfeel was rich and crisp. No hint of alcohol. Drinkability was good as well. Goes down easy, taste is ok. Nice and smooth. I would like to try this fresh and see if there was more spark from the hops."
"Poured into a duvel tulip had a Nice orange color with white head and OK lacing. Faint yeast smell in the background of the seriously citrusy hops. Way more hoppy than most Belgian ipas but i like it. The more it warms the more yeasty it gets on the nose and palate. I quite like this brew and would gladly buy it again."
"D- interesting and pleasant for a hop head. I expected more Belgian influence. It's so hoppy that I might not have noticed the Belgian yeast."
"Golden yellowy colour with a medium foamy off-white head, and a decent level of carbonation. The aroma has a strong acidic yeast verging on cat pee, with lemony citrus, and hint of grain. The taste is instantly recognizable as Belgian yeast, with lots of citric acid, a subtle wheatiness and a bit of soap. The hops are more apparent towards the end, producing a grassy bitterness and more dry summery lemony flavours. Light to medium in the body with a active carbonic feel. An intersting take on the normal Stone IPA. The Belgian yeast strain is very clear in the aromas and flavours, adding a much more acidic edge to the beer."
"D - This is a very good Belgian IPA. It is very tasty and easy drinking."
"Drinkability: I'm really glad they didnt overshoot and make this ""imperial"" sized. 6.9 percent is just right here. This is an excellent Belgian IPA which mixes the best of both."
"All in all this is probably my favorite beer from Stone, and one I'd highly recommend to anyone who happens to come across it."
"Pours a good golden amber color, with a nice foamy head some lacing. So far it looks like an IPA. The smell is a bit hoppy, but the majority of the smell is of the spiciness of the Belgian Yeast. Frankly, I would expect more hops on the nose. The same on the taste. There is a good hop citrus flavor, but it is quickly squashed by the spice of the yeast. Its surprisingly drinkable and very good beer, just a bit disappointed with the diminished hop flavor."
"D: Hops are huge but I felt I could probably finish quite a bit more. Good stuff."
"D: Hops are huge but I felt I could probably finish quite a bit more. Given the Belgian style, the yeast gives it a great spice, and the malt is still bold. Great stuff."
"A nice stab at the style by Stone. As I said, not as hoppy as expected from these guys, but good nonetheless."
"This is a really nice beer. I could do with less bitterness for sure, but even at this degree, it's still quite drinkable."
"Pours a hazy apricot a pretty nice white head. The initial whiff is of floral hops, followed by some Belgian yeast characteristics. The taste is quite similar, with the addition of a little bit of sweetness. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy, but very nice. A bit of dryness in the aftertaste. Quite drinkable in small quantities, but not something I'd quaff 22's of too regularly."
"22oz. bomber: This one poured a hazy, orange tinged golden yellow. There was a small white head onit that left some lacing. Nice aroma. Lots of pine with some citrus hops in the background, but not overpowering. The taste is quite good also. Somewhat bitter, with some pine and a lesser amount of citrus. The malts are nicely balanced here, and there is a bit of a Belgian breadiness to it also. There is pretty much no residual sweetness, though."
"Pours a hazy pale golden amber color with better than two fingers stiff white head that decomposes in 3d leaving sheets of Belgian lacing in its wake. The smell is aggressive bright hoppy and tropical...lemon zest rich pineapple orange...sweet and fruity. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel has a creamy medium body that compliments the flavors nicely. Full flavored, the sweet earthy tropical candied fruit characteristics of the nose are mirrored well. One heck of a nice drinker, at 6.8% ABV you could drink these all afternoon. Makes me want to seek out 080808 which I avoided because I thought that i read that it was a tripel."
"It's easy to see how this graduated from experiment to full timer. The drinkability is huge, the hops ring out, and there's enough nuance here to reward frequent revisits."
"Feel is ok, drinkability decent."
"Overall, I love this beer it is complex and delicious as I previously noted. I have had a Belgian ipa once before and it was very tart and dry which made it difficult to drink, but this beer is smooth and delicious."
"This is a very drinkable brew. The back of the bottle explains it best ""identical twin to a Stone IPA that was raised in a Belgium culture"". It has the hop IPA character, with the Belgium yeast flare. Very good brew."
"Pale and hazed dim golden body. Big frothy white head that has great retention. Nose is fruity, estery, yeasty, doughy and spicy. What a nice aroma. Great flavor. This one is done right. The belgian yeast gives the beer some nice fruitiness and doughy yeastiness and a little spice. The hops give the beer a nice quenching and vibrant feel. Citrus with orange and lemon zest. Nice clean bitterness. Medium bodied and agressively carbonated, though not gaseous in the least. This would have to be my favorite Belgian IPA so far. This is outstanding."
"drinkability: good"
"An easy to drink and even easier to enjoy Cali-Belgian from Stone. I'll definitely have again."
"On tap at Lord Hobo. Served in a bulbous Belgian style glass. Orange colored body, and a beautiful bright shine. Nice white head and good carbonation. Smell was hoppy, but not overpowering. Taste was a palate opener, for sure. Really nice hop profile, but there was a hint of Belgian sugar sweetness right after you swallow that gave this beer a nice finish. Good balance overall. I usually do not order many IPAs when I am out. But the last two Belgian IPAs I have had really changed my mind about this new hybrid style. I like the Belgian twist on the IPA and I feel that it makes this style much more drinkable."
"D: I could drink a lot of this."
"Drinkability is good. I enjoyed this as always!"
"Overall a good beer. But the two crossing style flavors didnt mesh in my book."
"Overall this was pretty good, it was more on the Belgian side of the spectrum than the American IPA. If you like Belgians and hops you would probably like this one."
"Nice beer."
"Excellent sipper, but one was enough."
"D - At 6.9%, a little high to be sessionable, but the taste makes it so tempting to sit back and have a few of these. Very enjoyable IPA...definitely not like your average IPA. Very interesting character and well worth seeking out. First time I've had one of these in about 6 months...really wondering why I haven't bought more..."
"I'd take this stuff over Arrogant Bastard any day of the week. It's puts a smile on my face when my local beer guy has this in stock."
"Poured from the bottle into a rounded tumbler nice golden color with a thick, sticky, barely offwhite lacy head that really sticks to the glass. Great aromas of hops initially but transitions to a more typical Belgian spicy-malty aroma after some time. Definite crisp piney flavors to go along with the unique Belgian spiciness in the taste as well. Crisp, light bodied feel with a dry aftertaste that lingers. Unique flavors and wonderful aromas, combined with the light feel and relatively low alcohol content lend a hand to make this a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. A lot of great hop and yeast flavors, and the bitterness is just right. I could drink this one all night long..."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. The feel is decidedly IPA, and even has a bit of an oily texture. Alcohol is not detectable. I like Stone's regular IPA better, but Cali-Belgique is still quite good. This one falls short of Green Flash LeFreak...I'd like to see a bit more Belgique to match the Cali. But, you're still talking about two 4+ beers."
"Overall while not being the most complex thing in the world, it worked, and worked well. I would have no issue putting another one down."
"Beer is medium to low body, slightly metallic in flavor. I'm not getting hops as much as I'm getting the Belgian again. Second taste, there is a slight bitterness at the back of the mouth. I'm definitely getting a good strong pale ale vibe from this beer. So what do I do? Do I penalize it because it off style or rate it well because I like it. I'll give high drinkability because its one of my styles, but I'll knock it for a lack of hop flavor."
"D= Very drinkable, though not as refreshing as an IPA, and not as substantial as a Belgian. I guess that makes it just right for the style."
"Another nice Stone IPA."
"Found this on tap at the Big Hunt on Connecticut Avenue, in Washington, D.C. It was my first time trying it. Poured a nice rich amber color -- at least in the light of the bar -- and had a balanced mouthfeel. I found the taste exceptional -- a perfect balance between hops and Belgian backbone. Sweet and tart, like a good apple. Warming enough to drink in the DC winters, but crisp enough that I could imagine quaffing it in August, too. A real winner in my book."
"Easy drinking, nothing dramatic here just a nice remix of a classic that makes sure not to throw anything off balance. All the essentials are still here, the belgian ""essence"" is subtler than I was expecting and offers a nice, gentle addition to a set of flavors that I hold quite dear to my heart as one of my all time favorite beers. If the choice was between another glass of this or of a regular stone IPA, I'd probably take the IPA. That said, I'd gladly drink this anytime, and I will most definitely be having more of these in the future."
"A: The color of a light yellow straw, somewhat frothy and cottony head that sticks around, some spotty lacing down the side of the glass - 4.00, S: Quintessentially Belgian aromas, some clove and fruity esters, also a touch of sugar free bubblegum, the nose also showcases a range of hops that I can't necessarily decipher but I do get citrus and tropical fruits such as papaya, a very light and floral aroma all-around - 4.25, T: Obvious elements of the a Belgian yeast and an IPA - a solid hop bite which becomes even more evident as the glass warms, like the nose there is lots of tropical fruit, I also taste candied sugars, the beer is also quite dry - 3.50, M: Smooth and medium-bodied - 3.50, D: A very drinkable beer though a touch too edgy for my likings, I'm a big fan of the style of beer and Stone but this one just falls a shade short of what they generally produce - 3.50"
"Pours a deep golden color with a generous white head that leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is of citrus - orange and strawberries, with pine notes and a hint of vanilla. Taste is marvelously balanced, with the citrus and vanilla qualities muting the hops at first, but finishing bitter after all. Extremely complex beer!"
"Note: These notes are from memory, had this wonderful brew earlier today at the brewery."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into an imperial pint glass. Color was a slightly orange amber with very small amounts of carbonation rising from the bottom. Very thin white froth head on top. Aroma was slightly sweet, small touches of citrus, with a fair amount of hops. Taste was very fruity, almost like an imitation orange flavor. Felt ok in the mouth. Coated well, but felt like it was over carbonated. The over carbonation was the detrimental part to the drinkability. Otherwise it was a fairly balanced and pleasant to drink beer."
"D - The Stone Cali-Belgique is quite the tasty Belgian IPA, not the best, but up there with some of the best examples of the style-easy to drink like an American IPA w/ lots of hop flavor and nice w/ yeasty Belgian influence - I recommend this highly"
"D - Compared to other examples I've had, the alcohol content is fairly low, allowing you to drink this all night. However, this is no slammer - the complexity begs to be sipped."
"Drinkability: This is my first try at a California IPA/Belgian hybrid. And I liked it! I really enjoyed the belgain influence on the IPA-ness. You get some really nice hop notes but it's not as heavy handed as a lot of IPA's I've tried. I don't know what the availability of this beer is but if you have a chance, it's definitely worth a pint. Or two."
"The name for this beer, Cali-Belgique, is hyphenated and so is everything else about it, too. It has the sunny radiance of California's southern beaches but the warming, wholesome heartiness of Belgium's antiquated, candlelit inns. Bitterness and sweetness dual to a draw. A beer with this kind of intense, satiating flavouring but infinite, perpetual drinkability doubles as both the connoisseur's crown and the layman's quaff."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Soft and moderately carbonated, this beer gets easier to drink as the session moves forward. Its texture thins as the head disppears, releasing its effervescent properties into the beer itself. A terrific experiment that proves two different yeast variations can vastly change a West Coast IPA's demeanor, while creating a winning recipe in both cases."
"Overall, not a horrible beer, but I've had better Belgian IPAs."
" D- This beer has an amazing aroma like when I'm harvesting hops, the flavor however does not follow through. There isn't much yeasty characteristics or malt support in the flavor. The text on the bottle is impossible to read in the color scheme but I suspect it wasn't improtant to the beer inside."
"Drinkability is high... I am glad I got this one, and while I don't see it in bottles around here I was glad to get to have it on tap. I'll get it again for sure. Prob. one of my favorite Stone beers."
"M/D: Medium bodied, a bit velvet like on the tongue, carbonation is pleasing. Drinkability is very good. Excellent beer."
"Awesome mix if American/Belgian. The plentiful American hops are a great combo with the funky Belgian yeast. Recommended."
"Very drinkable; pleasant, crisp and refreshing"
"One of the overall worst beers released by a craft brewery in the past few years. Awful."
"Drinkability: I finished the bomber in a heartbeat.... left me craving more... but that's the objective, right?.... Always leave the wanting more... I will seek this out again."
"D: Not my favorite IPA."
"The beer poured a clear, honey-amber with a thin, white rocky head into a chalice. The aroma was the unmistakable Belgian yeast profile - banana/clove, with a slight swee/sour apple component as well. The flavor was a bit tart, with more of the banana/clove, and a pretty big hop bite at the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, with low carbonation and nice lacing all the way down the goblet. A very drinkable Belgian - a bit low on the ABV scale, but a very nicely balanced and clean beer."
"Bitterness mixed with slight bubblegum which fortunately doesn't linger too long."
"D - It's good and somewhat easy to drink, but not exceptionally so. Moderate alcohol creeps up on you."
"Bold beer at such a low abv. Very powerful and chocked full of flavor. Very piney and bitter with malt showing up in the beginning and fading towards the finish. This one is drinkable and tasty although it didn't have the Belgian mouthfeel I'm used to. Still a great ride."
"Drinkability: So Damn easy to drink! If this brew were easier to obtain in my area I could become more of an alchy. Get it if you can!"
"salud!"
"Drinkability is good. I really enjoyed this beer, but the bitterness could get a bit boring to others, but not for me."
"M/D: Though they are subtle, the hops provide a syrupy resinous texture. Moderate carbonation is just about perfect. Light enough to handle a whole bomber on your own, but a little bit too much for more than that. This beer is a very interesting offering, and I can't wait to try it on tap next week."
"Lets put it this way, I have maybe 5 stores a patronize semi-regularly. If I see a bottle of this, I buy it. I say that's drinkable."
"D - This beer is dangerous. I could drink it all day long. I will certainly have many, many, more."
"Excellent!"
"Poured from 1L growler a couple of days after it was filled. Poured into tulip with great two finger head. Deep gold in color, good retention and lacing. At first the citrusy west-coast hops hit me but then I noticed a yeasty, hefe-like nose. Spice, banana and some sweet fruit all present. A definite bready and yeasty taste along with a pleastant bitter hopiness. A little more of a bitter hop kick than a citric hop kick. Some sweetness, some malt, and some grain as well. A very unique blend of flavors. Good, medium mouthfeel with slightly oil, chewy aftertaste. Overall a great beer and unique for stone. Tastes a bit like the 8-8-8 epic I thought, but thats not a bad thing at all."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a clear amber color with a good inch or so of fluffy of white foam. The head leaves a slight lace in its wake. nose and flavor are of pine, fruits such as grapefruit, tangerines, lemon, some caramel, bubblegum, yeast, pepper, toasted cereal grain. A few notches better than medium bodied with ample carbonation. Finish is dry and mildly bitter with a lingering sweetness."
"It looks exactly like standard stone IPA, but maybe a little bit of cloud that isn't normally there. The head is still very ""Stone"" and west coast hoppy in character. The hops still punch the nose, but there is an underlying sweetness in that Belgian yeast. Different from that sweetness that you get on the other side of those hops. This is a more round and broad sweetness that come only from Belgium (or areas very close to...) There is bubblegum hidden in the glass too. I love how much the yeast changes everything. The smell, the structure, the flavor, the mouthfeel, and the overall drinking experience. It's like your tongue wants to taste Stone IPA, but the yeast makes you forget what it tasted like. The American Ale yeast normally used in this beer works differently with the hops. It normally acts as strong object for the hops to lean on and use to exert themselves. But the Belgian yeast almost embraces the hops and wraps them up in a buffer. You can still taste the specifically bitter aspect that these hops are traditionally meant to have, but there is so much else going on before you get there, that is doesn't have the same effect. What an interesting beer. Good job Stone. ZOMG!!1"
"D: if i can find it i will get another, great brew be even better with a meal instead of as a snack."
"might be a little over-carbonated, but then again, it does have a light-medium body. drinkability is good, but i would much rather have a regular stone ipa or ruination."
"D - very good well rounded Belgian IPA... would love another"
"The feel was on the lighter end of medium with a smooth and very slightly bitter feel. A good amount of carb. I'm surprised this held up so well in the keg as im assuming it's not super fresh. Im thinking the hops may have fallen off a bit in storage but as it is this was great to drink. The alcohol is low as hell to which improves things."
"This is a very drinkable beer, could be a nice session beer, if you can find it."
"Drinkability: An absolutely outstanding IPA, I can put it no other way. I wish I grabbed more than just one bomber."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber with a two finger head with good retention. The aroma was hops citrus. The taste was more IPA than Belgian, it wasn't so loaded with carbonation that you could taste nothing else. Mostly citrus but I got just a hint of banana too. Nice blend of bitter and sweet. Feel is light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good. Sorry, but I didn't see this as anything more than a tricked out IPA, good though."
"Even with the slightly higher gravity of this beer it's drinkability is good, a little hop to keep you interested and bored."
"M&D - lively and effervescent, very dry on my tongue, will be enjoyed by hop lovers"
"This is a nice copper colored beer with a very malty smell. However it doesn't taste malty at all, very hoppy instead. The head stays for a while and leaves a nice lace on the glass. Definetly grapefruit and some spice on the front but finishes clean. Great effervecence and leaves you wanting another. By an by this is a great purchace. I am writing this review based on a 22oz. bomboer but I was also lucky enough to try this on tap at the brewery several monthes ago and it is definetly superior on tap but very worthy in the bottle."
"This one pours a moderate gold with a bit of creamy white head. There's a decent amount of lacing associated with it too. Smell's a little weak considering that this is a Stone IPA, but there's some hoppy grapefruit and a bit of yeastiness. You can tell that there's some Belgian influence here, although I'm not sure how much. It tastes very hoppy and bitter with a decent yeasty finish. It doesn't have some of the spice notes that I like in Belgians, and I think that that could be interesting in this brew. It's not bad, however, just a less aromatic, yeasted-up, watered-down version of Ruination IMO. A bit creamy with a slight dry finish. Herbal aftertaste. A good drink, but not my favorite IPA by far."
"Drink is good a solid IPA. This is decent but I liked it better out of a keg into my growler."
"Drinkability: An interesting style, but not sure it is worhty of an entirely new category. It seems like an IPA with a little more prevalent malt body. Good, sure. But not ground breaking or mind blowing."
"Bright golden color with a long-lasting white head. Spices dominate the nose with a slight citrus aroma. Spices and citrus again on the palate with maybe some lemon rind and/or orange peel. The hopping is definitely noticeable and comes through nicely to stand together with the fruity and spicy flavors. Very well blended overall but losing half a point for perhaps pushing the spice out front a little too much in my opinion. The variety of flavors really reaches every corner of the palate and creates a sensory whirlwind. Great carbonation that's lively and not overpowering. Very drinkable all in all but I would have liked the spices to be a bit more subdued. Nonetheless, this is an excellent beer."
"Drinkability is pretty high. While this is in no way my favorite Belgian IPA to date (Houblon Chouffe, I'm looking at you), it's a really tasty brew. If Stone were to offer it in sixers, I would definitely grab one from time to time to spice things up a bit (no pun intended... ok, maybe a little bit)."
"Drinkability is very good. Nice and refreshing with no signs of ABV."
"Not a bad beer, but certainly not a great Belgian IPA."
"D: Very easy to drink, and has a little something for everyone. Two almost completely opposite styles that work well together and should be a good starter for someone looking to expand into either IPAs or Tripels."
"This beer pours an amber color with a medium head that hangs around for a while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has the Belgian spices upfront followed by a citrus hop character on the back end. Interesting. The flavor has the yeast and malts playing backup to the strong citrus hop flavors and lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium and drying. The drinkability is ok, but the hops dominate."
"A solid Belgian IPA from Stone. The aroma had me concerned at first, but the taste and great feeling body more than made up for it. I'd love to try this on tap to see if that aroma would pull up any."
"nice fine carbonation. creamy, soft mouthfeel. very nice in this department. light to medium body. very drinkable, a well made beer for the style. however at the same time, not much different than most other belgian ipas around."
"D-Totally, a well done Belgian IPA. Plenty of flavour and easy to drink with the grapefruit citrus zing I love."
"Off the tap at American Flatbread this beer was a bright copper color and very clear. The head was two fingers of egg-shell white foam that retained nicely and laced well too. The aroma was a little fruity from the Belgian yeast and it had a nice floral hop element as well. Refreshing, floral and balanced; a good bouquet. The flavors were equally well balanced and pleasantly complex displaying an excellent balance of yeast and hops. Spicy, fruity and herbal all at once. The bready malt seemed slightly shy (especially for this brewer) but otherwise it was very well thought out. The finish was just a little bitter, but not unpleasantly so. The mouthfeel was good, the body full and the carbonation medium/high. Quite drinkable especially because the alcohol was well hidden though not quite as good as some of their other offerings."
"Eric"
"D - A wonderful Belgian IPA, but one that is a level removed from the best of style... A sipper with style... Enjoyable all the way around... Would gladly welcome in the future and invest my own money in buying additional bottles..."
"Found one bottle of this gem on a shelf in a local beer shop today. A lucky find indeed. A well made Belgian ale that has impregnated an ultra hoppy Stone IPA to conceive a deliciously complex sweet, bitter nearly perfect beer. Really, this everything I look for in a beer - not sure how readily available this brew is, but if you find a bottle, grab it and gives this bad boy a shot. Highest recommendation."
"At a *relatively* low ABV, this is very drinkable. It would be nice if it was easier to come by down here in South Florida."
"The Belgian IPA has become one of my favorite styles, but like many other Belgian beers, they're never as good on-tap as they are bottle conditioned. This one, however, on-tap at Flying Saucer, is even better than the bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a crisp pale orange with a decent off-white head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice blend of spice and citrus hops. The taste is a wonderful blend of spices, citrus hops and sweet malts that leaves a nice blend of spice and hops on the tongue. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation and just a touch of sticky alcohol. This is likely one of the best Belgian style beers I've had on-tap."
"Second time around for this one. Pours a golden yellow, slightly orange with a one and a half finger head that leaves light lacing on my pint glass. Head dissipates after a few minutes into a nice creamy coating on the beer, a bit too bubbly though. Smells of hops, piney floral and citrus and a good malt presence in the nose too, the Belgian yeast adds to a good nose in this beer. Tastes of citrus, pine/wood, more hops, some sweetness, belgian yeast and a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is kind of fizzy for me but is light-medium with a good malt aftertaste coating on the tongue. Drinkability is high here, a fairly light beer, no alcohol taste or other bad tastes, the hops would get tiring if doing a session of this one though, great stuff from Stone once again."
"Appearance is a light golden orange with a medium sized head. A crazy amount of carbonation is visible for a little while until it disperses after a minute or two. Smell is hoppy, floral notes, I'm enjoying this a lot. Taste is also hoppy, malty finish. Good amount of floral hops. Mouthfeel is a bit slippery for my liking. Good brew overall."
"Well-crafted. A neat experimental by Stone, but it's not for me."
"Very easy to drink, a little malt, more hops and citrus notes. A little sweet. Good mouthfeel. Not sure if Belgian yeast melds well with a ton-o-hops though. Interesting experiement and would like to try again on draft. Dry finish."
"Overall this is a very good beer and a neat departure for Stone from their normal hoppy brews."
"Really good, but I'm not sure it is worth the trouble for those of us here in the Midwest."
"Consider this the product of a one-night stand with Stone IPA somehow ending up with a beautiful Belgian Ale!"
"Very solid beer. I will definitely purchase again."
"Pours a orange golden hue with a thick effervescent off white head, forming thick and rising well above my glass. Sporadic chunky lacing simply clings to the sides of my Gordon Biersch Imperial pint glass. I know not exactly the choice for many Belgian style ales, however this one retains enough American hops to fit smoothly into this style of glass. Big grapefruit and citrus tones simply crash down on my senses, excellent American hop profile...in fact it's one I don't think that I've enjoyed since early on in Stone's uprising. A bit of Candied sugar and sweet biscuit or cracker sweetened malts lay open to a load of citrus hops, and since that's the case that is all I can recall from recent Stone Cali-Belgique examples. Sweet sugary hops and malts with spicy Beglian malts not as much of a train wreck as some of the Belgian style ales, I just hope that Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale makes it out to southeastern Ohio more often. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with soft effervescent carbonation from your atypical Stone creation, I thought I was going to hate the American hops with Belgian yeast but this version worked for me and I hope to see more of it in greater Pittsburgh area. Btw, I snagged this bottle from the Piggly Wiggly at Market Common in Myrtle Beach."
"bitter and hoppy, but not what i come to expect from stone. not enough bite. i loved ruination and ipa, but this is a bit to weak. obviously its a belgain ipa, but i wanted a more refined taste. still, good. light body. pretty easy to drink."
"for it's strength (which is well masked) this beer is pretty easy to drink provided the spice is up your alley."
"Drinkable? yes. This is a beer that goes down easy and is worthy of another sip."
"O - Awesome beer. Maybe not the best California IPA/ Belgian beer, but darn good."
"The mouthfeel is good. A bit effervescent with a nice dry, almost mouth-puckering finish. The dryness enhances the drinkability, however I won't reach for this one all too often. Overall a good beer, but Stone has plenty better."
"Poured into a Sam's Perfect Pint glass. Pours a dark yellow, not quite orange, close to a golden color with some cloudiness to it. Gets clearer as it warms up still a bit hazy, very little lacing on the glass. Smell is good. It's initially hoppy, then you can smell the Belgian characteristics to it. Taste is interesting, but gets better as it warms up again. Has the Belgian yeast but the initial taste the hops again, mostly citrus, maybe some slight pine at the end. Noticeable hops but not a very strong taste. Mouthfeel is pretty good, has a slight bite with a dry finish from the hops, but not bad. I found the beer to be pretty drinkable. I feel this is a beer that you really have to be careful if your drinking it with a meal, not a whole lot of options to have it with , maybe something lite."
"Very drinkable beer. I could drink it all day."
"This is a very nice beer. Nothing to light your world on fire, but a pleasant, slightly more balanced drinker from Stone. Good times."
"A nice Americanized twist on a Belgian IPA.  Not sure if it bests Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel, but its still an interesting and tasty Belgian IPA. If you can find a bottle, give it a try - the hops might be faded, but the funk from the Belgian yeast strain definitely makes up for that."
"Drinkability: Decent, I wouldn't want to have much more than a bomber of this just due to the style not being my favorite, but still a pleasant brew that is not a game changer, not too bitter nor hoppy and a nice example to introduce a friend to what the difference between a Belgian and an American style is."
"Final thoughts: An interesting beer that combines two great beers, as many have done before it, that don't usually blend well. Even with stone doing it, it doesn't blend perfectly but they do a pretty decent job of it. It doesn't have many qualities of either Belgian tripel or Cali style IPA, but slight parts of each rounded pretty well. Its not something to drink every day but occasionally it's an interesting change."
"D - Smooth going down."
"Very drinkable IPA. I would have liked to seen a bit more Belgian Character and a little less bitterness; but those are just nit picks to an otherwise fine beer."
"sticky: a standard stone offering in that respect and not enough help is provided from the visible bubbles. ultimately, not very belgianish. very STONEd"
"D- good, California IPA meets Belgian ale yeast. this is fusion gone right for a change."
"D. A rare treat that is as delicious as it is rare in these parts. One of the best IPAs Ive come accross. Exceptional."
"Maybe not my particular cup of tea, but well done."
"The beer is easy to drink, and it's appropriate for just about any occasion. Thing is, it'd have to taste better to go to it more consistently."
"The mouthfeel is just light enough to be quite thirst quenching and the drinkability is top freaking notch. Another excellent offering from Stone."
"Well done Stone!"
"Overall: This beer is great. All the conflicting aromas and flavors make this one, surprisingly, a winner."
"D - The flowers and mint dominated this beer, which was really too much for my personal tastes. Crafting a good Belg-IPA is such a fine art."
"Had this one the other day after work. Poured a golden orange color with white head that faded quick and left good lacing. Smelled of yeast, fruit, hops and malt. Tasted yeasty, with fruit and a light hops kick. Fairly smooth. Some interesting flavors here, but the combination doesn't suit me very well."
"- Very drinkable... just don't think I would make a session out of it..."
"Overall the combination works quite well, and fans of both West Coast IPAs and Belgian golden ales should find it quite tasty and very drinkable."
"D: Not my favorite offering from Stone, but a nice change of pace for them."
"Notes - Very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"This is one of a number of failed attempts to make a combined belgian/california double india pale ale. Like the others, it takes two great styles and assumes the flavors can be mixed in a sittuatio that really doesn't work. You should try but i'll be surprised if you don't feel the same way."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with good carbonation."
"Glowing orange body with white fluff head. Funk, citrus, citrus rind, and sweets in the nose. Flavors of citrus, alcoholic booze, hops, brett funk. Medium bodied and easily drinkable. Easy on the stomach but packs some interesting flavors on the palate."
"Some really interesting tastes going on. Almost gave it a 4.5 on taste."
"D- I am only good for one of these before I pick up another bottle and try something new. Not a bad beer at all....just not a everyday drinker."
"Drinkability is good malty fruity nose light hops and flip for taste lots of hops and spice light fruity malt in flavor. More Belgian in the nose defiantly more IPA in the taste."
"Overall I really like this. Riding the wave of hoppy Belgian beers is a good thing. I will keep buying this one."
"Stone Cali-Belgique was absolutely the perfect beer to drink, on the deck, after a long, hot summer day."
"Pours a smooth and lovely golden orange with a nice but modest foam and good lacing. Nose is big on citrus, hops, and some caramel with a bit of spicy Belgian essence. Great body with a lot of big fruit and citrus flavor with that characteristic Stone whoop-ass feeling. Good hop flavor and pretty bitter, but at first on the way down, you notice a lot more of the Belgian yeast flavor and some pretty chewy notes. Finishes nice and bitter with that wonderful spicy Belgian taste. Wow. This is an incredibly creative beer, and my mouth is watering over my subsequent sips. Bravo."
"Bottle. Pours a hazy deep orange with a small ring of white head. Aroma of melon, sweet citrus and other sweet fruits, and a touch of grassy hops. Flavor has a decidedly hoppy presence with some Belgian yeast, clove, and melon notes also present in the finish. This was actually a successful effort at a true Belgian-IPA blend! Nice beer."
"This is a very interesting and well done beer, but it's definitely a sipper."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, really good, will be drinking it again, Stone has always done a great job and I am not surprised that this one is awesome."
"Notes: I'd drink this more often but for the price I'm thinking of passing on the beer industry all together."
"If it weren't for the hop bitterness this would be a really great beer. I know Stone is all about the hops, but it's kind of funky in this one."
"Overall, something different, but nothing great."
"D- A good beer that seems to fall in line with (if not edge out) most of the other, what I would call, 'hybrid beers'...worth a try, but probably won't knock your socks off..."
"D - Very delicious though I was unsure at first how it would grow on me. Would definately reccommend though probably wouldn't drink it on a regular basis."
"The taste is neither here nor there. The beer is sweet and has some characteristic Belgianesque sweetness, some Belgian yeasty spices, some overly sweet malts from the candied sugars. The beer gets sweeter as it warms. The hop is not overly bittering, slightly more leafy than anything else, but with some very slight orange burst, some candied sweetness too. The beer is a tad thin, the carbonation is modest, the aftertaste is on the mild side, the consistency is light to medium bodied. The hop devolves into more bittering leafy notes, more than the oily or overly sweet florals. This is a decent beer but not my favorite by a long shot."
"Didn't know what to expect from a Belgian IPA with California balls, but I gotta say, this beer kicks ass. It's like drinking a spicy pilsner, but in the style of an IPA. It looked great on tap at Stone, smelt slightly clovey-belgian-y and tasted awesome. Really quite balanced, and actually, when compared to the house IPA at stone, very clean. In fact, the sag you get out of a worn out California yeast compared to this is strikingly noticeable. I'd recommend this to anyone as an interesting beer to try out. Really drinkable too!"
"Drinkability: An excellent sipping beer; very flavorful"
"Gald I bought the last one of these from a store in columbus, ohio. The first thing that comes to mind is grapefruit which seems to be a stone thing. It reminds me a lot of the regular Stone IPA but with the citrus notes a little on the extreme side. I loved it. Pours a hazy golden color with decent but not spectacular head retention. No lacing, just a little when you take a sip but it quickly goes down the side of the glass. As I take another sip I want to add honey to the list of subtle tastes. Overall I loved this beer. It is drinkable, complex, exciting and all around a great brew. Can't wait to get my hands on another bottle."
"D- An enjoyable beer that I hope to see around more often. This became more enjoyable as it warmed and opened up."
"Drinkibility is decent, in that it's a crisp, refreshing beer. Sessionable? No way. Regardless of the 6.9% ABV, this beer will numb the palate after more than one. If you can't taste the beer, what's the point?"
"The body is thinner than even a regular IPA and if it wasn't for that clove taste would be non-existent. I did not find this to be a very drinkable, or enjoyable, beer. I think this kind of a bastard style to begin with, with that said there are better examples of the style, go find them. Stone IPA is among my favorite IPAs and I love Belgian beers so this was a big disappointment for me."
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some pretty good lacing. Aroma of slightly bitter hops with a light fruity yeast. Taste is also dominated by some light fruity ester with some dry hoppy notes and some neutral malt in the background. Body is full for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done thought there is some better example for this style with better balance between yeast and hops."
"Drinkability - pushes the upper limits of sessionability for an IPA, Belgian or otherwise."
"Pours clear light orange in color, there is a little head that takes a minute to fall. It's moderately carbonated. The aroma is of a IPA or 2X IPA and super citrusy, I think there's a note of caramel on the nose too. This tastes rounded, sweet, Belgian and 2X IPA with intense bitterness and finish. The finish carries on your tongue and sticks to it. A wicked beer, if you don't mind rolling the dice and are up to something different."
"Cool experiment, and it's successful. This certainly proves that beer raised in different culture can indeed be influenced."
"D: This is a great brew. A wonderful take on the style, and so undeniably Stone."
"Numbing, herbal hoppiness up front. Some pine in there as well. Nice wallop of sticky tropical fruit sweetness follows, with a distinct pineapple and cocktail juice ring to it. Sweetness is tempered by the constant hop bitterness, but also by a funky, hay-like, saison-ish twang (thanks to the yeast?). I like it. Dry finish with lingering bitterness and wee notes of aspirin and pine resin. Some fruity malt hangs in there too. Medium-full body with a nice creamy feel. I really like this one."
"D: Decent. An interesting brew from Stone, and definitely top-quality. I think a more conscious effort by Stone to brew a Belgian IPA could prove more effective, however."
"D-This ones a sipper for me. It is a nice experience, but definitely not a session brew."
"The taste also definitely has both American/West Coast IPA and Belgian traits but it's a bit thin and bland. It is mostly dry with whiffs of sweetness and light hints of bitterness and is rather low in both sweetness and bitterness. It is somewhat yeasty with pear, plum skin, spiciness, and hints of banana and leafy-resiny-grapefruity hop. It has a light, lingering spiciness. It's good, fairly easy to drink, quite crisp, but a bit too dry and thin."
"D: IPAs aren't my favorite, but I could stick with this one for quite a while."
"D - Don't know if I would keep drinking these but is good as ABV is low a good sipper."
"D - great mix of a Californian IPA and Belgian IPA, more Californian than Belgian though however not a hop bomb either, will enjoy all 22 oz"
"drinkability is good. well balanced. the aroma is quite belgian and the taste leans more american, but overall it's tasty and enjoyable."
"Medium body. Carbonation seems low. Alcohol well hidden. This was interesting."
"I keep trying ""Belgian IPAs", and this one definitely sticks out as the hoppiest in my book. I think my favorite part about drinking this style is comparing the notes from the beers that actual Belgians are making to a beer like this."
"To sum it up: A banana bread with lot hops in it!"
"Drinkability= Abv. is not present, the flavor is good, a genuine quaffer."
"All in all, this marries two of the greatest things about beer: Stone and Belgian yeast. This is delightful and should not be missed. (Kudos to Stone for recognizing both the Dutch- and French-speaking cultures within Belgium, printing exactly half of the bottles ""Cali-België"" and the other half ""Cali-Belgique."")"
"d - highly drinkable and a delicious beer."
"A beer that really goes well with most foods and with a long grapefruit hop finish."
"GOOD STUFF!"
"Pours a one finger white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose. Flavor is grapefruit, malts are in the background, lingering bitter aftertaste that won't go away. Overpriced at $7.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Bottled is of the half that are labeled ""Cali-België"""
"I actually enjoyed this one more that Ruination, or the regualar Stone IPA. This is the perfect marraige of style for someone like myself who is a hop=head, but also loves a good belgian. Kudos to Stone and American craft breweries for their willingness to experiment and take chances."
"This was good,but not really ""wow"" good. It is a little forgettable."
"D- Overall this is a great beer that is different from all of the other brews Stone puts out."
"D: this is a tasty beer and I recommend it to those interested in giving the palate a workout. What do ya know, another solid Stone"
"D- Overall a solid brew that wasn't as hoppy as I had expected but still very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is light and airy, a tiny bit filmy. Very drinkable."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"D: This was pretty interesting, another good one from Stone. I made sure to have their IPA directly afterwards to note the differences, which are definitely in its fruity sweetness. Worth checking out."
"Overall, it is interesting and unusual. I didn't really care for the soapy bubble gum and bitter blend. It was a little reminiscent of a British nitro ale."
"On the plus side, the mouthfeel is actually quite decent, but the overwhelming bitterness negates all of the other flavors. Seeing as how it's getting a lot of good reviews, HOWEVER, I may try Cali-Belgique again out of fairness. Perhaps my palate was affected by something else that day."
"Not really a session ale, but not supposed to be. I could see drinking a couple because it's so good, but for most, one will satisfy, if not sit heavy."
"D - Very intriguing and enjoyable. I'll definitely look for this one again."
"D: Pretty darn good, but I was hoping for a little more Cali than Belgique."
"Very drinkable."
"What an interesting beer. Like I was saying in the description. It's sort of an American IPA with Belgian influences, rather than DeRanke or others that are Belgian's with American touches. Cool beer, way to go stone."
"Notes: A really unique beer that captures both styles really well. Probably best when fresh. Thanks Michael for getting this beer into Vermont!"
"Beer poured a light orange with a white long lasting head. Nose is belgian yeast, citrus hops, and hints of belgian candy. Taste is light malts, a bit of sweet candied sugar, white pepper finishing with a blast of west coast hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, lively from the carbonation and semi-smooth when gliding on the palate. Drinkability is pretty good, definitely a fun twist on their wonderful IPA. It may benefit from more of a malt backbone to even the hop volume. Nice effort, recommended for hopheads to try."
"The taste was pretty peppery with a soft malt backbone. In the mouth it was lively and highly carbonated. Overall an interesting effort."
"M/D: Beer was smooth, refreshing and very easy to drink. Nice carbonation to it and a medium body feel. This is a solid beer, one that I may pick up again in the future, but more than likely will stick to the straight IPA."
"this beer pours a very pretty golden color with a frothy white head that recedes to lacing. the aroma is really nice with the belgian yeast works well with the hops... a nice balance. the taste loses me a little bit, the sweet malt and belgian flavors fall behind the hop bitterness. the mouthfeel is a little light, the co2 is a bit much for it. could have been better, but it's still a damn good beer."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aromam is great. It has a refreshing hop and Belgian yeast aroma. It's bitter with a solid malt base. It goes down easy and finishes nice and fruity. The taste is decent. It has a very bitter hop taste with a thin malt flavor and a dry fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a tastey beer, but it's too bitter and lacks malt character."
"Slightly hazy dark gold with a thin whitish cap of fine bubbles. Quite a bit of streaky lacing, good head retention for what's present. Big citrus hop presence in the nose, grapefruit and pine, a bit powdery, but with some pineapple/tropical character, bubblegum, and faint spice as well. Same in the flavour, coming together in a sweettart-like fruitiness, but with a solid bitterness. Mild sweetness was mostly fruity, with a hint of strawberry, rather than malty. Closer to light than medium bodied and fairly dry, moderate carbonation, a bit on the rough side. I liked it. The difference in yeast added more complexity than I expected, but a slightly modified malt bill would probably improve the texture and create something truly impressive."
"There's some powdery floral hops and chewy resin in here. astringent lemon peel and some slices like white pepper and clove. It's just an IPA, big chewy and bitter...with some metallic funk. Drinkablility isn't really there, it's just too one-dimensional for me to enjoy in large quantities...i got bored by the bottom of my 22. You want a really good belgian ipa, go with choffe...same price, yet delicious."
"This poured a clear gold with white head. It smelled like rose and lemon and wild yeast, with a bit of honey. It tasted like wild yeast and lemon, with some honey and floral rose hops. It was watery with no carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very well done Belgian IPA, but unfortunately that isn't my favorite style of beer. It was clean and pretty easy to drink, and it had decent body. I might have missed some of the subtlety to the flavor, since this had such a delicate character, but I wasn't in love with the taste. It was very nicely crafted, and it helped me appreciate Stone more as a brewery, even if this beer isn't quite my style."
"Drinkability is high. Another excellent Stone offering. Very complex without being to heavy or overly strong. I enjoyed this one quite a bit, and I wish I had bought more than one at the brewery."
"I buy this stuff by the case, it's my favorite style and, well, stone is a good brewery. It's well done and cheap. Good daily night ender."
"Overall impression: Nice twist on a great IPA - plenty of great hop flavors with an interesting yeast note .. this one is pretty drinkable, I'd love to see it in 6 packs."
"I didn't expect to be a huge fan of this beer but I am very surprised. This would be a perfect hoppy summer beer for me, I'd get my hop fix while still having something relatively light to drink. The hops are all over the board in terms of flavor, in a good way, and there are lots of layers to delve into, more so than in most other belgian ipa's i've had. Very nice."
"Not bad at all. I like this example of the style. It has a definite Stone feel to it. My only problem is that Belgian part of this beer seems lost. Regardless, you cannot go wrong with giving this a shot."
"Picked this up at the brewery - was worth a shot."
"Picked this one up from the factory. Split this one with a buddy and I found it to be more pleasant than I was expecting. The mouth feel is smoother than you would expect from stones IPA tag. I like this as much as the Vertical Epic Ale which is a tough comparison for some. Overall this a heck of a beer. A must try for any Stone fan."
"Drinkability: Definitely worth trying at least once, and I could sure go for another."
"D: Overall good drinkability easy enough to consume but somehow was expecting more from this. Good, but only moderatly enjoyable. Drinks much bigger then its advertised 6.9% abv."
"Feel and Drinkability: This one has a medium-full body with just the right amount of carbonation. Carbonation is lower overall, but this beer is packed with so much flavor that any more carbonation would be devastating to it. There is nothing I would change about the way this beer feels. This is one that I'm definitely going to pick up again, after all this isn't the first time I've had this beer, the first time I've really studied it...yes. I'm not sure if I'd call this a Belgian IPA, its more like exactly in between and Belgain Tripel/BSPA and an American IPA. It seems to me that Belgian IPAs such as Chouffee's Belgian IPA and Piraat, are a bit different. To me this seems to be different than either of those."
"Alcohol warming on the slightly dry finish."
"D - Not a bad beer by any stretch and quite a novel idea. Just not for me."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"D: This was more to satisfy my curiosity than anything else. I thought it was good, but not great, and I don't think I'd really seek it out again."
"Very, very drinkable chuggable in fact. This is very good high quality beer."
"Overall: I split this with a friend and I'm glad I did. I don't think I would've finished the whole bomber. It certainly is interesting, but I'm generally not a huge fan of the Duvel style Belgians and this was too much of that for me. I'm trying to be fair in my grade as this was something I wanted to try, but the style is not for me."
"D - This is definitely an interesting brew from Stone. I wish it was a bit heavier on the IPA, but it still drank easily and displayed some nice complexities."
"According to the label, about half say Cali-Belgie (Flemish) and the other half (the one I have) is as it is listed here (French). Cool that they thought of both Belgian cultures."
"D- Not my favorite of the Stone offering the flavors are all over the place. I really don't think that this strain of yeast works all that well with the aggressiveness of the Stone IPA."
"D-First time I've had this one, and I am a fan."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little more carbonated than the standard Stone IPA. Overall it goes down smooth and easily. I'm still not sold on the Belgian IPA myself and it seems to clash a bit to my taste buds. This was nice but I'd rather have the regular IPA or Ruination."
"Taste is quite bitter throughout, but especially on the back palate and finish. First flavour is again kind of tangy with quite a refreshing bent, and descends quickly (maybe a bit too quickly) into that very hoppy finish with a slight lemon squash flavour to go along with it. Mouthfeel is light and frothy, like toothpaste. But yeah, really pleasant and drinkable, main palate is a bit short but otherwise very nice."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Well done and I wouldn't mind picking up a few more bottles."
"I'm usually a huge fan of this style, but was not super impressed by this offering which I find strange since Stone makes such good IPA's. Not a bad beer, just nothing special. Pours and orangish brown with a tan head. The nose has Belgian yeasts and fruity hops over candy malts. Taste is light on the Belgian spice and on the bitter hops. Medium to full body is well carbonated."
"Moutfeel is alright. Drinkable enough, but I might want something else over the course of an evening."
"D-Surprisingly well done....why? I didn't think that such dissimilar styles could be combined to such a good effect. The sum is definately worth more than the parts. Tomorrow, I head out to but more to stockpile before the stores run out. Nuff said."
"I've had this on tap a few times, but this is the first time in the bottle. I found it to be much better on tap; in the bottle is it just a decent Belgian-style IPA. Definitely worth trying, but I recommend it on tap."
"Very good and something that I would drink often."
"D - Interesting and drinkable. The aroma is excellent, but the flavor doesn't live up to it. There is a lack of Belgian character in the flavor even though the nose exhibits lots of yeasty goodness. In the end it comes off as mostly IPA and just a little bit Belgian."
"D: 6.9% ABV is well masked. A few of these in the summer heat would sneak up on me."
"I have to admit, I'm a sucker for a good stone. I like the hops and I love belgian beer. This is a really good beer. I can't comment too much on the appearance, it was dark in the room I was drinking this. It was light in color and had a nice head. Great smell, a combination of the malty sweetness of a tripel overlayed with a good hop freshness. The taste mimicked this scent but with a little stronger hops flavor bordering on citrus. I drank this with some moderately spicy thai food and it complimented the panang curry squid nicely. I could drink a lot of this. If you like stone, belgian or anything with hops, give this one a try."
"It poured a very nice Dark amber color, the aromas were very much like the name suggests very true to a belgian spciy and citrusy,floral with hints of honey, then you get the aroma of the hops which added to the citrus gave it an almost blood orange scent. Taste was just outstanding typical belgian triple flavors spicy and slightly yeasty but with a nice blast of hops which gave it a nice grapefruit/ citrus like finish.In my opinion the best beer I have had in a long time... This is a perfect food beer. I had it with sauteed red snapper with a lemon butter sauce and it went perfect!! I can't wait to get some more!!"
"D: A very good experiment by Stone. I really enjoyed this one."
"Pours out hazy orange into tulip glass. Small white head that disolves quickly. Great lacing all the way down. The smell is very Belgium-like. Almost smells like a good wit. Lots of spiced scents. The taste was much the same. The hoppy bit of an IPA with the orange spice of a belgium wit. This made for a absolutly great compliment to the Grilled Tuna I had with this beer. The carbonation was just right for a great mouthfeel and overall a very drinkable beer."
"d: I thought this was quite easy going down, despite combining two rather intensely-flavored beer profiles."
"My first bIPA, and a good beer for sure. Would like to see more yeasty balance, but coming from Stone its no surprise the hops are the focus."
"D: All in all not too bad. Not quite to style but that is fine with me. I find the Americans really miss this style sometimes. Worth trying though."
"Pours a nice golden color with a 2"" white head and good lacing. It definitely smells like a Belgian, floral and hoppy. Wow! Tastes like hops and more hops fading to a pleasant grapefruit tang. This is a nice beer for a warm day. Very refreshing."
"Probably wouldn't get this one again, but it was nice to try this once."
"Poured an amber to golden color with a quater inch white head on top. The head laces nicely along the glass. A splash of spicy sweetness with a yeasty bread frgrances. The bready yeastiness hits the palate at the front, blending to a mild grapefruit bitterness, with a touch of grassiness at the end. a light feel at the front, it crisply dances across the palate, leaving a mild dryness on the back of the palate. This maybe one of the most well balanced belgian IPA. It is not overly hoppy, though bringing some hop strength with it, along with a strong yeasty twang. This is a very strong beer from a very unique style."
"Poured into a wine glass for a nice opaque orange body with bubbly carbonation (one-finger white head) and it looks like little yeast floaties (doubt it), plus a ring of lace. A floral hop smell is what I notice first (so typical of Stone) and then also picked some citric and lemon-zest smells. Also some orange and/or heavy fruit in the smell along with that Belgian smell of yeast and sweet/caramel malts. The taste is similiar with this being a medium-bodied beer that is balanced between both styles. Has some caramel and sweet malts and bread to make it a little chewey and sweet, while the hops are clearly evident in both passing (citric, floral taste) and on the backbite (crisp and dry). Also minor fruit notes include orange and a tad of grape and tartness - has a VERY minor champagne like quality (could also be from carbonation). Warms a little as you sip but with a lower than usual ABV from Stone and my affinity towards them I wish they would make this a permanent offering."
"D- This is a great offering from stone. Its no Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen IPA Tripel but is still a darn tasty beer that is very drinkable and delicious. Good American interpretation of the style and a great beer overall."
"Going down like a charm...as it warms up, I'm liking it even more."
"Drinkability: Tasty and fairly light like Stone IPA, but with a strong sourness that masks the hops to some extent. Nice and refreshing - hopefully I can try this one again."
"D: There is really no alcohol burn at all which is not surprising with the ABV. It is pretty balanced with the finish just slightly bitter. It goes down pretty smoothly for an IPA."
"D: I like this much more than the Stone Collaboration Ale. The abv is lower and less boozy and the flavor profile is very intriguing."
"My sister picked this up in NYC for me and I am very happy with the results. Duvel was one of my first Belgium/craft beers(and is still a favorite of mine) that helped push me into this 'scene' and because of my newfound beer hobby I have also taken a likeing to IPA's. To me this a great combination of the two beer realms. I love the clove/hop combination that this beer brings and I am going to explore further into the Belgium IPA style. My only negative is that even though Stone is offered in NC I cannot find this anywhere."
"D- Easy to drink, but I think I would rather have my Belgians taste like Belgians and my IPAs taste like IPAs."
"Other than the fact that this seems sligtly more attenuated than Stone IPA, I'm not really seeing much of a difference. Not a bad beer, but I'm not getting it."
"Nose is as touted - sweet fruity Belgian qualities intermingling with a solid hop presence. Taste is dry fruits and flowery hops. Simple but effective. Mouthfeel could be better, but it's still good. Same for drinkability."
"Overall I will have this again. It is a very good brew. I will especially get it if I see it on cask or tap."
"Had a hard time scoring this one b/c it is so easily enjoyed. Tried to back off the ratings a bit b/c the Le Freak I remember being more impressive on the palate but this is a very strong contender."
"This is a very good, not great Belgian IPA. It's very smooth and has good flavor, but I wish that flavor were amped up just a decibel or so. It's very well balanced, however, and certainly quite enjoyable. It's also incredibly drinkable. Definitely recommended if you can still find it."
"Overall, this is an interesting brew that is mostly IPA with a hint of Belgian."
"Mouthfeel was more understated than I expected. Somewhat on the thin side. Mild carbonation."
"Great ale, to be recommended with all but the very finest (I think that Houblon and Hopsinjoor are more drinkable) Belgian IPAs. Get thee to a brewery!"
"Pours clear amber with a fluffy white head. Very interesting nose, actiually like a combination of Belgium and Cali with yeast and flowers mingling with pine and grapefruitTaste is very smooth, with a lot of sweet malts up front and a light bitter finish. The strong hop aroma did not translate into the taste, although it was quite drinkable. Medium carbonation and body. An interesting and tasty beer."
"A very nice beer that I'm enjoying drinking. Stone has really caught my eye with some of the Belgian styles coming out of the brewery. This one certainly shows that promise."
"nice american hopping to a belgian blonde, although it might cut down on drinking more than one."
"Drinkability is low for me, I just didn't care for this too much."
"Solid medium body with active carbonation. Aftertaste has just as much yeast as hops. Not overly bitter by any means. I wish this one would have shown up in MD. I would absolutely buy this again. Good job, Stone."
"Pours a transparent golden orange color with a large white head that leaves some sticking. Nice hop aroma in the nose paired with a strong yeast character. Pineapple, apricot, banana and peach fruit notes. Nice big bright Cali hop flavor, excellent malt balance and a very distinct yeast note. Very true to its style, it really shows the best of both worlds. Medium bodied, and at only 6.9% i could drink this all day."
"M/D - Medium bodied with an excellent level of bitterness. Drinkability is high. An excellent experiment by the Stone guys yet again."
"Goes down nicely but I'm not sure I like the melding of what to me are two distinct styles. I'll have to try others and see if its the style or the beer that doesn't quite work for me."
"Drinkability is pretty good here. It is just a strange combination for sure."
"Overall, really shocking. I think I've found the first Belgian-yeast beer that I can find tolerable to sit through. Is it the best beer Stone's ever made? Definitely not. But it opens a window of hope for that Belgian beer that I was getting so bored of."
"D- kinda of a sipper, kinda of stone IPA mixed with some Belgian yeast, i like where stone went with creation, look forward to more of these"
"Drinkability: this one is a nice slow sipper and gets better as it warms. Worth picking this up if available."
"Poured into my Stone Ruination pint glass a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white fizzy head, with some small islands and sticky lacing left around. The nose is hoppy, malty, yeasty, with some spice, citrus. The taste is hoppy, malty/yeasty, a little citrus slips in, and some spice. Medium body, the finish is slightly bitter. Drinkable, you can definitely taste the beligian influence on this brew."
"Very good beer. I'm usually go for an IPA or stout but I really enjoyed this. Try it if you can get it especially on limited production."
"As I stated above, it took me a few sips to try and figure out what they were trying to do here. Once that happened, I liked it. It's not great, but a decent offering and a style that is growing on me."
"Not a bad effort, not sure if these styles match though. The strong piney hoppiness clashes a little with the sweet belgian yeast flavor, takes a little getting used too. Very different than other belgian IPAs, but a decent brew."
"Cheers"
"More of a Belgian Ale in appearance, light in color with a white head which sticks around for a while. The ABV and hops are more consistent with a toned down American Pale Ale than a revved up British version. Stone, as per usual, puts forward a refreshing brew that is very drinkable. Though expected hints of fruit in this IPA aren't all that present, the sweetness of a Belgian Ale is there. This is a good combination ale but I do prefer Stone's individual efforts in regard to these two styles individually."
"I have to say I really enjoyed this beer...different yet familiar in two different ways."
"D - pretty damn good. I've had more intensely hoppy Belgian IPA's, and at first I was sort of underwhelmed by this. However, once I spent some time with it I realized how nice it is, and I'd definitely drink this again (and will finish the bomber oh yes). Good work, Stone!"
"Very drinkable for a Stone beer. Not a whole lot of flavor or heaviness to weigh you down, and enough carbonation to make you feel refreshed, not groggy."
"This is easily one of my favorite hybrid styles, and perhaps this is one of the top American examples, if not the top. It's not flawless, but it is bold and adventurous, and it comes across as fun and nicely blended. The manageable ABV and understated complexity give it a solidly drinkable character. It's a nice benchmark for a damned intriguing international union."
"Poured in to my Duvel tulip; reddish golden rust color, incredibly clear to look through, small head with minimal lacing. Smelled of grapefruit, and hops. Taste was nice and hoppy but not so bitter as most STone beers (which I love). Working through the glass the hop bitterness and flavor seemed to diminsh. Mouthfeel was average; nothing great or bad. Drinkability was good, as the flavor was fairly mild. I would say, although a good beer, a little tame compared to Stone's other, remarkable beers. Probably will pass when i next see this in the store, but glad I tried it."
"D: This beer is quite tasty. The aroma and look are a bit weaker than I thought they would be, but the taste makes up for it. This beer is easy to drink and it would make a fine hot weather day. This beer will quench any thirst and the ABV is low enough so you can easily kill a couple bombers. Just well rounded and enjoyable. Hopefully this brew come around again."
"Overall, a good beer. Don't know if I would get another one, but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
"This beer pours an extremly clear amber with a 1 fingered white head and decent lacing. The smell is kind of muted but what I get from it is some malt tones. The taste is nice and complex, some nice malt flavors, a decent hop after taste (citrus) mixed with the belgian yeast... gives it kind of a bread/banana flavor. The mouthfeel is nice qwith a decent carbonation level and a slight dry aftertaste. A highly drinkable brew, just wish it was a little cheaper so I could drink a few, 7.50 a bomber is a little over my drink on a normal basis"
"D - Stone's touch on the style is extremely drinkable."
"D - A tad too sweet for my taste but a very nice beer overall."
"I'm a little bit disappointed by this beer. It's a good Belgian IPA, but it just doesn't have the flavor intensity of some of the best ones. The color is a wonderful bright gold with an pretty good beige head. The nose is yeasty and hoppy. It's much more yeasty than I was expecting and not quite enough hop intensity. The same goes for the flavor, but lack of stronger hops kind of frustrates me. It might just be that they should have upped the malt and alcohol, so that the hops pronounced more flavor than just grapefruit rind bitterness and light astringency. The mouthfeel also doesn't quite work for me. The hops really want to be fruity, but the aftertaste is more astringent than bitter, nearly unpleasantly so. It's a fairly drinkable beer. I'm probably being a little too harsh. It's good beer, definitely enjoyable. My criticism is sort of nit-picky. I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"Pours a pretty golden orange color, great clarity. The head is disappointing; short lived and settled into almost nothingness. The aroma is very sweet, tropical fruit and candied apricots, some peppery spice, and a light grassy hop. Interesting mix of the sweetness and the hops in the flavor. The flavors hit a different times yet kind of mix nicely. Noticable Belgian flavors from the yeast, pale malt, sweet though not sure from candi sugar, some honeysuckle, and a nice balancing hop. The hops are more pronounced then the European hops typically used in Belgian made BIPAs. The feel is quite light, prickly carbonation, finishes sweet and slightly sticky. Definitely an American made BIPA, there is always an odd sweetness with these, perhaps the strong tropical fruit flavor. The hops are in perfect balance, they don't overpower allowing the Belgian yeast to shine through. Seems boozier than the 6.9ABV."
"Bottle from Bottle Barn in Santa Rosa. Pours a nice clean orange to red with a puffy one inch head that settles down into a creamy looking film. Very bright and clean looking, quite pretty. Nose reminds me of another Belgian style IPA i've had, Kuhnhenn's Aldebaran. Fruity and yeasty nose, with definite pear and floral notes, very inviting and reminiscent of the Kuhnhenn beer (which is an exciting prospect to me). Flavor is quite nice. Kind of sweet and fruity, like a pear/apricot jolly rancher, but with a nice floral hop complement and a solid malt base thats syrupy, but not too much so. A dry bitterness on the finish that isn't altogether welcome, but a solid, tasty flavor nonetheless. I like it more as i get further along (isn't that always the case? urp!) Medium bodied, even a little cream-like feel, not think but still milkshake like in texture somehow. Drinks well...hey, i guess i really like everything about this one. Not as good as that Aldebaran, but itll do in a pinch!"
"This beer certainly lived up to my expectations for the style. A very interesting hybrid, and one that I'll enjoy again for sure."
"Picked this up at Green's, as I am drawn to just about anything from Stone. Poured from a bomber into a couple of tulips to split with my wife since she is the Belgian fan and I am the IPA fan. Pours a thick foamy white head on top of a golden, highly carbonated looking ale. Definitely takes on the appearance of a Belgian golden ale. The aroma is lacking much distinct character, definitely some citrus hints and maybe what I would call a ""crisp"" aroma, nothing much in the way of hops though. Taste is light and tart, due to the previously mentioned carbonation. I do enjoy the balance between what the Belgian yeast did to the West coast IPA style. It is a light ale, and the carbonation takes a bit away from the mouthfeel in my opinion. I realize its not an IPA, but this one lacks a bit too much in the character department for me to seek out, but it is certainly an enjoyable try."
"D- This beer is very drinkable. This is the first Belgian IPA that I've tried and I'm impressed with it. I hope that this newer styled beer takes off because it is really good."
"D - Delicious stuff I'll buy again so yea - it's drinkable!"
"An interesting variation, kind of startling how far away this beer is from the standard IPA. Yeast changed the whole character of the beer - unfortunately, I feel like the beer loses some major character from the transfer. The malt and hops notes just kind of get tangled up in the yeast, and the result is a beer that's just very yeast-dominated in the end. A nice enjoyable beer, but not the masterpiece the IPA is."
"22 oz/$6.99/Wine Specialist"
"Not a bad sipper but I don't think I'd buy a lot of it."
"The style is interesting, and Stone's is a pretty interpretation."
"Overall- Sweet and creamy. A real tasty BIPA. No harsh alc. and plenty of flavors popping out at you!"
"Extremely drinkable despite 6.9% abv, the alcohol is well hidden in this IPA. Another great offering from Stone! I wouldn't mind having a few of these in a night, as long I can get somebody else to cart my ass around..."
"Pretty standard IPA appearance, with a clear, orange-golden body, a two finger thick head, and lively carbonation streamers. The smell was floral hoppy with some spiciness imparted by the Belgian yeast. The taste was nicely balanced between the Belgian fruity version of the Pale Ale style and the drier American IPA variant. The hops were present but subdued, and some Brett type funk was evident as well. The finish started dry and bitter at first but ended on a sweeter candi sugar and some spice. This was a marriage of the lighter versions of the two styles, so the body was not too thick. I ended up wishing they had matched up the ingredients of a DIPA and BSPA instead."
"All the BIPAs I have tried have come from Belgium. This is a pretty good American version of a Belgian style which is an interpretation of an American style that's originally an English style. Recommended."
"This beer loses on drinkability for me. I had a couple glasses of water before drinking this beer but as soon as I finished the first half I felt completely dried out. I don't know if it's the hops or the malt or just me but I am extremely parched after drinking this beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head over the clear burnished golden brew. Head lingers nicely, with average to good lasting lace. Aroma is sweet, with a lightly spicy hoppiness. Taste is also sweet with spices, and the lightest touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Everything comes together nicely, and while its not in your face, I don't believe that was the intention."
"An interesting experiment, but one that unfortunately did not create a great beer, IMO. Definitely worth checking out to sate the curiosity. At roughly $5, why not, you get a buzz out of the deal. However, this will not be a beer I will seek out again."
"I enjoyed it, but I'm not completely sold. Worth a try for sure."
"Taste: Although this American depiction might fall a few feet short of other classic Belgian examples such as Dobbelen Chouffe, this is an excellent depiction of a classic European style done in the American tradition..."
"D - Fairly easy drinker here.. pretty smooth brew and a great mix of malt and hops."
"Clear amber with a two finger cream color head. Still a small layer of head at the half way point and very nice fine lacings. Aroma is mostly ripe pear with a hint of citrus. Taste is bitter citrus hops with a rich malt backing. Carbonation is just right and the finish is bitter and dry with a bit of fruitiness in the background. Drinkability is limited only by price and the 6.9% abv. The Belgian yeast gives it a bit of a tang that makes this IPA more interesting than most."
"Drinkability: As tasty and supremely drinkable as the original, though I dare say it's just a skosh bit better than the standard Stone IPA."
"Overall: My favorite India Pale Ale ever released by the Stone brewery. Distinct taste, smell, and presence. Would buy again!"
"Sticky golden pour with a billowy white head. Delicious hop aroma with a pleasing sweetness. Reminds me of my beloved Houblon. Taste is awesome. Fresh, hoppy, and sweet. A Belgian IPA seems to me a mix of a Tripel and an intense IPA. This one is especially delicious. Mouthfeel is also smooth, with no alcohol bite. So long as you are down with the sweet sticky hop goodness, you'll have no problem putting a couple of these away. A repeat purchase for certain."
"D. I really like this one! This bomber is going to go down way too easily for sure."
"This one drinks very well - enjoyability is on par with the tap experience. I'd definitely like to see more of this stuff around."
"Cloudy yellow-orange color with white head. Nice lacing. Sweet, sweet pale malt aroma, with a citrusy hop presence, orange peel. Palate is filled with malt, very very sweet, perhaps too sweet. Citrusy hops really come out in the finish. Bitter and dry. This beer for me is best described as a beer that starts like a triple and ends like an IPA. This beer seems to have two distinct phases. I would like to feel as though everything blended together for a more consistently balanced taste throughout. Contrary to other reviews, I did not think this was closer to the IPA end of the spectrum. I could have used some more hops. The beer is a bit too sweet upfront."
"poured glass, nice pale color yellow orange. very clear. smell was weak hops and clove a little to simple for an ipa or a trippel. taste was kinda a mess the hop bitterness battled the sweet maltyness. its odd. le freak worked for me while this didnt. meh its a perfectly ok beer just not something i would go out of the way for. interesting concept less then impressive execution."
"Overall this is a tasty offering from Stone, and one that is worth a shot."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is yet another excellent beer from Stone, it is definitely worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Drinkability: definitely could have a few of these...this beer leaves you wanting more."
"D: Pretty drinkable with a manageable ABV. The left over spice and bitterness is pretty strong but not too much."
"D- This one went down very easy and was enjoyable. Not quite a hop bomb but has a great balance to it."
"Impressed, surprised, happy. I'm not a huge fan of Stone IPA, but the Belgian yeasts makes this one deliciously different. Ultimately delicious and enjoyable. I definitely plan of snagging a few more bottles of these."
"Well, this looks identical to Stone IPA. Light orange, almost yellow with a white head. The smell is immediately different, still very hoppy, bubblegum, and belgian yeast, spicy. The taste is bitter hops and not much else.The belgian influence is very subdued. This was interesting and I'll always give a new Stone beer a fair shake but I won't be returning to this. I could see if using Belgian yeast with the Stone IPA recipe made for a good beer but this just feels like a cheap gimmick."
"D - This is a standout brew that was better than my expectations."
"Future outlook: Good stuff. I can see getting this again. Quite a nice drink."
"Pours an amber orange color body. Small creamy snow white head, diminishing. Fruity hoppy aroma. Fruity, grapefruity taste. Some hoppy dryness on the aftertaste. Some carbonation. Some fruity bitterness. Nice taste, Belgiany and hoppy. Light fruit taste, maybe pear or something. Creamy palate."
"D: I could easily throw back one too many of these."
"this is a great beer, though some of the supporting acts are not that great, ie the appearance. the taste however is very good, and id recommend"
"Drinkability is pretty good. I'm most impressed with their restraint in the ABV, it's plenty big enough to warm your cheeks without being gratuitous, as many west coast IPAs are, especially Stone. On the other hand, this was so limited, that I suppose getting a bit extra punch out of my only bottle wouldn't have hurt, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted to sacrifice the cleaner alcoholic taste. If you love Stone's IPA, you will love this, and while I like the more overt west coast influence, it's still not my favorite."
"A relatively sweet hoppy beer, that proves to be the right amount of bitterness and flavor to allow the facilitation of multiple pints. I had this beer on tap at the Stone Brewery and was very pleased with the fresh hop aroma followed by a sweet malty finish. Great IPA! Service at the brewery was mediocre."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with almost an inch white head. Head retention is good, and there is a lot of lacing. The aroma is citrusy hops (grapefruit), orange, ginger, Belgian yeast and a bit of piney hops. It tastes like bready malt, pine and citrusy hops (grapefruit and orange peel), Belgian yeast, peppery spice and ginger. There's good balance in this beer, it's not too sweet and not too bitter. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. With the relatively low ABV it wouldn't be hard to drink a couple bombers of this at all. It reminds me a little of the Vertical Epic 08/08/08 I just drank, but I think this is a bit better. If you get the chance to try this beer, you should."
"D: I love Stone and this is another reason why. Buy, drink, repeat."
"Bright/light mouth feel and fairly light body. Fantastic drinkability. I enjoy this one quite a bit."
"d: more drinkable than i expected"
"Notes: Glad that I tried this. It was better than I thought. Another good offering from Stone."
"think this is a fine combination of the 08.08.08 and the stone IPA."
"I tend to dislike Belgian IPAs, but this one was by far my favorite one to date. I really love west coast IPAs, but sometimes I just tend to get burned out on drinking them. On the other hand I really don't care for Belgian IPAs because they seem too reserved. This one fits right in the middle. A perfect blend of both characteristics."
"This was more of a belgium pale ale than a BIPA. Way overpriced. Stone missed the mark on this one."
"Pours clear orange-gold with a big pillowy white head. Bubble gum, clove, orange peel, and peaches in the aroma. Strange (but good) taste up front. Like a very bitter trippel; more bubblegum and spice, but dry white pepper and pine are right there with it. The beer sweetens as it warms and your palate adjusts. More pine and spicy hops come out and mix well with the Belgian sweetness. Much better than Le Chouffe or one of the other Belgian IPAs."
"Lovely all around. I heart stone and this is no exception."
"Stone's got a winner here. I don't like it quite as much as their IPA, but this is well done. Given, I believe the look here could be improved a little. Perhaps by not looking so...filtered. A tad more hop bitterness might improve the flavor, as well. Otherwise, this is extremely impressive and Stone's IPA recipe works very well with Belgian yeast. Highly recommended if you have the opportunity."
"Thanks, cannabanaceae, for the opportunity"
"A dry brew with a high amount of hop. The aftertaste is long-lasting bitter hop. Relatively thin body with an above average level of carbonation. Lip puckeringly astringent."
"Pours a completely clear orange amber with a thin creme head. Nose is perfume and floral tones. Flavor comes off as the skins of some fruit to me. Grapefruits I think. I don't like to eat grapefruit skins, and I don't really want to drink them. There's also a bitter acidic bite from too much hops, I am guessing. Earthy dirt aftertaste a bit. Carbonation is slightly aggressive and the liquid is smooth. Overall this is a below par Belgian IPA IMO. The hops are too prevalent to let the Belgian Ale side shine and it doesn't have the balance I would seek out from this style."
"the drinkability is solid, is doesn't bowl you over with bitterness like it could, it's actually pretty balanced. the smooth sweet complex taste is a new take on the recent belgian IPA trend, and while i'm a big fan of the style, it's already nice to see a little something different than a hoppy tripel, which this is not. well worth a try, i would be happy to see this one return next year."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable beers I have had. Makes you want to guzzle it. Going to buy another one or two on my way home for SD tomorrow."
"D: Jammed this with some Jimmy Durante and it seemed to couple very nicely. I liked this one a lot. Reminded me just a tad of the 08.08.08. Overall, a very nice beer. Comes with the usual Stone reading material on the back of the bottle. Even at $6.99 it was worth a whirl."
"The IPA 'portion' is definitely flavorful, but the Belgian yeast and sweetness hamper these highlights. Glad that I tried this offering, but next time I'll order a Ruination instead."
"D - Drinkability is good. This brew is clean and goes down pretty easy. Seems very well done for the style and I wouldn't have any problems having a couple more pints of the Cali-Belgique. The mouthfeel is a tad off but not enough to mess up the beer as a whole. Another good brew from Stone. Glad I got the chance to try it."
"I bought the first bottle I saw in OH, $6.99 at Whole Foods. The beer is yellow as corn but clear as water, thick white foamy head that laces dry onto the glass. The smell is a near-perfect coupling of west coast hops with Belgian yeast, the citrus from the hops and the esters from the yeast. The taste is likewise representative of both styles, much better suited to my tastes than the Belgian IPA's I've tried in the past (Urthel Hop-It, Chouffe tripel IPA, etc). Lots of grapefruit with spiciness and cloves, very tasty. A real winner from Stone."
"Finish is toasty/biscuity also, with again more fruit."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has medium body with moderate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer was ruined for me due to an astringent minty flavor. This beer is simply not brewed to my taste."
"This beer poured a clear copper color and formed an off white foamy head that left latticed lace as is subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and Belgian yeasts. The flavor was of hops, citrus, pine and hints of the yeast as well. The body is medium light and the finish is sprite and peppery. Another nice experiment from Stone."
"The mouthfeel is exactly what I would want out of a Belgian IPA. Lively, medium bodied and with great carbonation. The drinkability is very high here. Everything is in perfect balance and the ABV is almost at a sessionable level. I would love to drink these all night long. Really an amazing beer."
"This is an interesting take on a Belgian IPA and one where the aroma belied the amount of hop bitterness in the taste. An original and tasty beer from Stone."
"Medium body with active carbonation, yet I feel something lacking in the mouthfeel. Perhaps it's the lack of time that it spends in your mouth, I'm not quite sure. Overall tasty and easy too drink with the alcohol lurking somewhere...pretty good brew."
"D: nice brew and well worth getting. A typically good brew from a good brewery. I love this style."
"Mostly clear, bright golden with a slight haze. Lots of bubbles and a tall, soapy cream-white head that sticks to the glass nicely. The aroma is the highlight of this beer, distinctly Belgian yeast with floral hops and fruit, namely grapefruit and pear. Taste starts with yeast and an almost sweet tart flavor and a smooth mouthfeel. The finish hits you with a bold hop bitterness that lingers for a while then slowly dies off, leaving you with a hint of sweet fruit. A great variation of one of the classic IPAs."
"Overall, the combo of IPA and Belgian yeast didn't really make a perfect, complex blend. This combo was just good. But the beer was good by itself and I liked it for that. I would have again if it was brewed again and I could find it."
"If Cali-Belgique IPA is an experiment, then it's a successful experiment. By virtue of one simple change, Greg and the boys at Stone have managed to create an IPA that tastes nothing like the original, yet is just as good. If the suggestion box is open, here's a vote for continued production. Distribution to Iowa is probably a pipe dream, but then that's why I look forward to traveling back to Ohio several times each year."
"As this warms up over an hour, it's quite remarkable how the balance shifts in this beer from being hop-driven to yeast-driven. All told, it's still delicious,"
"One of my favorite emerging styles. The beer has a lot of Chimay Tripel character, but sweeter, with a more caramel, cotton candy-like confection. A bit darker (copper-golden) than most tripels, but this one also gives a light toasty-toffee note that balances the fruity esters and spicy phenols well. The strong hop flavors compliment the peppery, clovey, yeasty spices very well with a sharp citrus, chai-tea herbalness that never wavers from the other complex 'Tripel-like' notes. Evaporative feel to the mouth from the dry hops, minty alcohols, and efforvescent carbonation. The beer just lifts off of the toung and dries out in the finish for superb drinking enjoyment Finishes spicy, citrusy, and with a mild phenolic-soapy note that I pick out in most all hoppy Belgians. Not quite a Houblon Chouffe, but very close in quality."
"Drinkability: Nice, and really does add a whole new element to the Stone IPA. And everything works really well, in my opinion, with the exception of that dry hopping, which just sort of seems ... well, off. The alcohol is, like the Stone IPA, just fine, well hidden and of a reasonable level. The aroma is out of this world ... the rest is just a little bit of a letdown. Still, a great beer, and one I'm glad I got a chance to try. Maybe tweaking the regular Stone IPA recipe a little for its Belgification would yield a slightly improved taste?"
"M + D: A nice shimmering carbonation, giving to it the bit of a foamy mouthfeel that I appreciate. A solid brew... the standard Stone IPA would be more likely to be a regular offering in my fridge, but this one is a nice treat."
"22 oz bomber from South Bay Drugs. Pours a fairly standard golden orange, but with a nice head thatsticks around as a cap. It's amazing what the adddition of a different yeast will do. I like Stone IPA quite a bit, and I like this as well, but the addition of Belgian yeast to the IPA has yielded an entirely different beer. This beer smells and tastes bready and meaty- almost of bacon. There are the standard Stone IPA hop flavors of citrus and lingering piney bitterness, but this bacony breadiness with some tangy notes overlies that. Unusual, and takes a bit of getting used to, but I like it."
"Pretty drinkable even though flavor is it's weak point. Not that it tastes bad at it is just light dry and refresh, not complex. Pretty much I beer I will try every year it comes out."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a two inch white fluffy head. Smells of sweet grapefruit and Belgian yeast. The taste is similar to the smell. Very citrusy with grapefruit and a clean finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, has a light body with lots of carbonation and is a little chewy. Drinkability is very good, I had no problem finishing this bomber. Overall a great beer from Stone."
"All in all this was a decent attempt for Stone at what is at least partially a Belgian beer. Considering the disappointment of most of the Vertical Epic series, this was actually almost a step up. Worth a try, but don't expect it to be anything close to a Choffe Houblon..."
"This is definitely not my style. That being said if you like strongly spiced beers you'll enjoy this one. I would attempt to describe the spice but I dislike this one so much I don't care to try."
"Tasty..Of the three recent hoppy Belgians from Stone, this one is the the biggest all around. The VE '08 is the most subdued with the hops, followed by the Collaboration, and then this one."
"on tap at the BA Belgian fest yesterday, and reviewed based on notes, pours lighter amber, clear under an initially fluffy and dense off white head. I got resiny hops, some lime in the nose. Fruity, hoppy, yeast going on here. Complex, tasty offering. I love the regular Stone IPA, love the Belgian addition..so enjoying this one is a no brainer...I'd love to see this one in bottles locally sometime soon"
"D: A good fall brew. The spice is making me think of the coming holidays(where did the year go??)."
"Dug it. Thanks, Greg & Co., I will be buying again. It may not be up my particular alley, but I recognize the artistry in the mixing of styles."
"M/D- The beer is on the lighter side overall, which is nice. Nothing too overwhelming in texture even at almost 7%. Still, this isn't my favorite type of beer, as the Belgian yeast character takes some getting use to along with a huge hop presence. Quite good still. Something different when us West Coasters want to go for something a bit different."
"Overall: just try it"
"D: Very good beer; I'll have this one again."
"Poured a very bright orange color with a white head. Smells like citrus and yeast. The taste is a bit more balanced, but still very yeasty with a citrus kick. I thought it was a little tart at the end. Drinkability is low. Just strange but good."
"This beer was really good and I was lucky to get it on tap. I thought stone was slipping as of late, but this gives me hope that every once in a while a brewery just goofs. Very good beer."
"(The French at the end of the blurb on the back is grammatically incorrect.)"
"A unique & interesting brew. Glad I had the opportunity to try."
"Very impressed with this brew on at SD Toronado. Like it's labeled, very CA and Belg. Big dose of pine resin / sap. Hops are nice and the mid doens't go so belgium aged hop sweet but still has a hint of it and the great texture. Would this possibly age?? Complex nose and maybe the carbination was a bit high? Nice complexity and mission accomplished as it felt 50/50 CA and Belg."
"Sorry- I appreciate experimentation, and give them credit for that, but as a beer to drink and enjoy, I just couldn't do it. In the end, I did toss about 1/3 of the bottle. Such a waste..."
"D- This is a tasty beer that's very easy to drink. The 6.9% isn't even a factor in this category."
"Purchase: 22oz Bottle from South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"D: An interesting beer, but in the end I wasn't a huge fan of it, I didn't think the flavours blended well enough together and the hop character got unappetizingly bitter after a while. A nice experiment, I could see myself trying it again, but wont be a go to beer from Stone."
"Interesting variation on the formula, but not a beer I would nominate for continued production."
"Decent mouthfeel, nothing too much to say about this really."
"D- I can't say that thhis is my favorite special release from Stone, but this si certainly drinkable. But, this tastes more like a blended beer that sits side by side wih itself in your glass."
"Cheers on another great beer Stone!"
"Pours a clear orange, nice looking, chunky but thin white head forms, settles down to a ring around the glass, touch of lace. Smell is neat, bubblegum, bananas, honey, light floral character, bready yeast, grass, light spice, refreshing aroma. Taste is honey and that bubblegum, banana, floral, nice bit of light fruits, pretty standard fare but well done, the spicy bitter finish is quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation, goes down easy, not too bad. I'd drink this one again."
"Overall: Yummy beer."
"Note: This is not the collaboration brew that was produced with Alesmith and Mikeller, which is a Belgian Tripel IPA."
"Taste: Smooth, fruity, you can taste the hops and the Belgian yeast flavors but they are nice and balanced."
"On tap at Stone Bistro during RBSG 08. Opaque orange color with a wet white head. Sheets of lacing. Nose is strong tropical fruit, primarily mango with some grapefruit. Flavor is yeasty with a less intense mango note. Really interesting hop flavors but not very much bitterness. Also some clove spiciness. Dry medium finish, smooth mouthfeel."
"Love Stone IPA, so I was expecting something big from this and was not disappointed, reminded me of hoppy Belgian pale until it warmed and I could really taste the piney hops, will drink again, recommended"
"Note: These notes are from memory, had this wonderful brew earlier today at the brewery."
"Not my fave."
"Edit: Looking back at this review, a 4.0 for taste was too generous."
