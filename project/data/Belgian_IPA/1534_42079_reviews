"Lovely IPA from Belgium.  Alcohol well hidden and the frothiest head that I have ever seen on an IPA"
""
"A very good Belgian IPA, I would like to have this one again."
""
"Overall: My first encounter with the Belgian IPA style and I suspect that it won't be my last. Not as insanely hoppy as American IPAs but then again this certainly doesn't drink like an 8% beer. As I type this, the current BA score is 91 (outstanding) and I'm finding little to disagree with - definitely worth seeking out."

"O- I think the hops have faded on this one, but it really had a lot of depth and character. Tastes more like a Belgian Pale. I'd like to try it again fresh."

""

"Overall a nicely balanced beer. Fruitiness topped off with a hoppy finish. Not the best beer, but a solid one."

"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/21/2013. Pours slightly cloudy golden orange color with a 3 finger dense and rocky white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, clove, black, pepper, floral, grass, herbal, honey, bread, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, honey, biscuit, black pepper, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy bitterness/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, white grape, apricot, light banana, honey, biscuit, clove, black pepper, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, hops, and pale malt flavors; with a great sweetness/spice/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, moderately crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Belgian IPA style. All around great complexity and balance of yeast, hops, and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Belgian strong Ale."
"O: had this a few times in the past week... stands out... the biting, leafy bitterness has me coming back again and again"

"33cl bottle (19/9/2015) into a goblet. Slightly hazy pale golden yellow with one finger white head that left a thin foam after settling down. Smell has malts and hops with a hint of apples. Crisp moderately sweet malty taste with a dry hop aftertaste with a note of grapefruit. Fruitier when colder and more hoppy as it warmed up. Very nicely balanced. Warms the tongue a bit but no apparent alcohol taste. Medium body and high carbonation. Very drinkable."

"Prost!"

"Would have again; worth trying if you ever come across it."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a foamy (4/5) and slightly smooth (1/5) mouthfeel. Ethanol mildly felt in the nostrils as heat and on the palate and throat as a light burning sensation. Closes dryly, with moderate stickiness clining to the palate and lips."

"Pours a three finger cream head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Hazy amber color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Light caramel nose, flavor is mellow caramel with light grapefruit hop background. Nice mellow BIPA. Part of 4-pack 330ml bottles $18.99 from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."
"A very pleasant beer from a brewery that seems to produce plenty of good beers."

"a really special brew here, best Belgian ipa ive had in memory, just a total gem. blonde and cloudy on the pout, with a permanent and thick white head over three inches tall, this is so lively and robust, as foamy as you make it, lacey and grandiose. the nose is tart and funky like a saison, hoppy, but german and Czech style, not so American and oily, but still plenty dank, not like ganga, but like a wet basement in a good a way as possible. yeast heavy too, Belgian unfiltered goodness. pils type malts, but there is more depth that that here. epic carbonation, one of the best mouthfeels of all time on this one, this beers best feature amongst many. I love the expansive decadent richness, but the lightness and sessionability too. this is everything one could hope for in a Belgian ipa and more, complex, drinkable, refreshing, special. well hopped and gorgeous in feel. a must."
""
""
""
"Hops are relatively light but present enough to leave a nice slight bitterness throughout the taste. Otherwise, pleasant Belgian yeast taste with some fruity esters, including a bit of banana. These flavors seem like they should clash more than they do, but overall this is a pleasant beer, and after a few days in Belgium, the hop bitterness is much appreciated."

"A very unique and hoppy beer with intensive flavors but not heavily bitter. A mix of Tripel and IPA. Worth it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste largely follows although it has more flavor and more yeast than the nose suggests. Despite the name the hops do not dominate but are in good balance with the other flavor components."
""
""
"O-This is an enjoyable, drinkable IPA with lots of complexity and balance. It is unique among Belgians, I think, for the citrusy, almost tropical hop profile. Flavors are big, but the bitterness is very mild. It also earns high marks for the great head and waves of sticky, thick lacing."
""
""
""
""
""
"MF - A delicate medium bodied beer. A champagne-like feel with a dry finish."
""
"Overall: I have not had many Belgian IPAs, so I was not quite sure what to expect here, but it turned out to be absolutely delicious! and is certainly a beer I will be buying again."
""
"All in all, a great Belgian IPA."
""
"The taste is plenty sweet and plenty malty with a citrus fruit and a low to moderate lingering bitterness. A lot sweeter than I might have liked but delightful in its own way."
""
""
""
"O: A bitter beer with a fair amount of hops flavor and aroma, this bottle seems like it might be a bit older but far from flat, old hops character. Additionally this would probably still be an excellent beer even if it had been aged I'd just be approaching it more like a triple than an IPA style."
"O: Damn, this is good stuff. It's exactly what I expected it to be: a rock-solid BSPA with an extra helping of hops. This could have the potential to be amazing fresh."
""
"Overall Impression: A very quaffable Belgian IPA whose body and flavor belie its 8.0% ABV. Playful hop and yeast character contribute to make an overall great ale."
""
""
"that said, it looks awesome after pour, smells very nice, tastes pretty good (even when considering my uncertain feelings) and is worth having again. i'd like to try the rest of their line up...."
"O: Excellent brew – Big Head – Great Flavors – and Excellent aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"The fizziness with the strong bitter beginning make this an aggressive ale. Enjoyable but be ready for it."
"Overall: Pretty solid Belgian IPA and the alcohol is not even noticeable too. Nice completion of their whole lineup."
"Overall – A pretty decent Belgian IPA that is rather drinkable and enjoyable."
"overall if you like hops!"
"A pretty mediocre beer."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Authentic Belgian IPA. Recommended"
""
""
"Very good combined with French cheese (Calvados Brie). Both cheese and beer lose a bit of theit bitterness if combined."
""
"Aftertaste: The aftertaste is where the hops really come forward. It's not all that bitter, but what bitterness is there hang on and gets more pronounced as you swallow. I actually like the aftertaste so much, I don't want to take another drink! But I will, because the flavor here is good. When we were in Belgium, I had a couple of beers from Het Anker. Our next trip will be during Belgian Beer Weekend, and we will just chug beers like this. We have an extra week of vacation this year… maybe we will go to Belgium!"
""
"Definitely one of the better beers Ive had recently. A really solid take on the BIPA style with plenty of juicey hops, pretty mild bitterness, and a nice overall feel to it. Really tasty. Try it out."
""
""

""
""
"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy tan head small cap on top of the beer. Small patches of foam form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, fruits, and some hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a malty finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."

"I thought to myself what the heck is Gouden doing making an IPA? Their lineup is so solid, but this excellent brew reminds us to keep an open mind. Great creative people always see something new and exciting just over the horizon. This is a beautifully crafted beer. Initial taste (great spices, properly infused), look (on the wheat beer side), smell and finish (clean and crisp) and makes for an oh so interesting pleasure. Good surprise find and more than well worth a try."
""
""
"The spice and floral, nectary hops go together like love and marriage, PB and J, well... you get the point. This is just a well crafted Belgian IPA that isn't over the top. Cheers!"

"O - An enjoyable brew from our Belgian friends at Brouwerij. I feel as if this is a bit off of my particular tastes although for a bitter hop explosion on a Belgian base, this is an exquisite brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was actually the fist time I've ever had this one, and it definitely won't be the last!"
""
""
"O - maybe not a game changer but easily a solid go to if ou can find it. There are an increasing amount of new takes on the BIPA style, but this is a classic example. Quality beer from a solid brewery."
"Overall this is a great beer in terms of taste (and thats what counts!) It's light yet complex which is something that I've rarely seen made doable. I think no matter who you are you will like this beer."
""
""
""
"O: On the whole, a well made, drinkable beer. Very solid."
""
"330ml bottle. Gouden Carolus Chalice glass. Enjoyed on jun´12. Pale yellow color, foggy appearance. White froth, creamy, copious & rocky crown. Sugar, alcohol & spices to the nose, bready & yeasty touches. Taste is ripe fruits & sweet malts with spiced & clean bitterness. Creamy palate. Medium body, moderate carbonation. ABV well masked. Delightful. Smooth bitter finish."
""
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the perfume, with some orange citrus and bread malt notes thrown in. The flavor is similar, with the floral notes really standing out initially. There is also some bread and grass, as well as some Belgian yeast and a low amount of bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"A splendid example of a prototypical Belgian IPA, nice to run into so shortly after exposure to a local-ish New World emulator."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"O: Will have to revisit this one. Smells great, tastes great initially but a lingering spice or tartness in the aftertaste ruined it for me. Perhaps an old or infected bottle, I am unsure - never had an ""off"" flavor like this one."
""
""
""
""
"Glad I've got more than one of this one! Cheers all. A must try if you like hops!"
"Overall: A really nice Belgian IPA, with a good balance of hops, light malts and a nice strain of Belgian yeast. I like this a lot and would happily buy more again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - wonderfully easy to enjoy."
""
"O: All I can say is: wow! A big surprise from a brewery that I haven't been particularly impressed with in the past (excluding Gulden Draak). Has all of the best qualities of the style and very little defects. Well worth seeking out."
""
""
"Classic Belgian golden ale, well done."
""
""
""
"O: A decent beer, but nothing special. The strongly oxidized aroma is a bit of a turn-off, but it still tastes pretty decent."

"Overall: Tastes like an american IPA. Belgian funkiness missing. i still like it."
"O - Very good BIPA that I would recommend if you can get your hands on it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is good. Not totally a dry crisp beer. I wouldn't call it a Belgian IPA but its still a good drink."
"Very smooth and drinkable for an 8% beer, nevertheless, this one offers a bit too much sweetness without the fruity complexity. Head retention and appearance overall are also just not up to stuff. Solid, but all things considered, pretty average for the style."
"O - A great surprise! I was not expecting this from this delightful hidden brew! I'm shocked this brew is my first from GC... YUM!"
"OK, so I just happened to notice this variety 4 pack from Belgium that looked interesting. Trying the Belgian IPA first. Well, things didn't start out too well, what with about 90% of my tulip glass being filled up with foam. Once I worked it out, it looks pretty nice, with the more acceptable head on top of a light, VERY hazy body. I dig the smell. Kind of hard to describe, but it has a tangy, yeasty hops smell. Pretty strong aroma. I like the taste. Hops, but with that crisp, light taste that I associate with European brews. The mouthfeel is ok. Seems very carbonoted, whether it is or not. Looking forward to trying the other styles."
"Beer pours a cloudy golden with a huge dense head. Aroma is tropical fruit and a sugary sweetness which does not manifest itself in the flavor. This bottle has been in my fridge for a few months, so it does not really have a huge hop nose like a fresh example would. The strong point of this beer is the ultra-dry mouthfeel, which leaves an impression very much like a saison. This is a lovely beer, not the best that Het Anker has to offer, but quite good."
"Overall, big let down.. on both taste and the wallet."
"O: One of the better Belgian IPAs I've had. It tastes much better than their Tripel, and has true Belgian character (which a lot of the American breweries' versions of Belgian IPAs don't seem to be able to pull off yet)."
"Overall I'am a bit disappointed by this since the nose is so fantastic. Unfortunately the beer just did not pull it off."
"jd"
"It has merits in the aroma and visuals, too. Golden and capped with white foam, in its gilded cup it was a site to behold. The smell showed off the scents of typical Belgian pale beers, and some European Saaz hops."
"Carbonation seems a bit high."
"This is a Belgian hop bomb, and I enjoyed it very much. If the alcohol weren't so apparent, Hopsinjoor would rate higher."
"O - A tasty Belgian IPA, and offering up some unique flavours. The high ABV was well hidden, making it easily drinkable. I would buy this again."
"O – A nice light beer, very drinkable, but underwhelming with no outstanding characteristics. I won't be trying it again. 3.5"
"Pours a slightly-hazy golden-yellow color with a good white head and quite a bit of ringy lacing on the way down. The nose brings some light floral character and peppers plus a bit of brad. Hops are in the front, though there's definitely some yeast and malt. The flavor brings a nice, light white pepper character plus some faint earth and some floral. hops. A bit bready as well. Medium body with a good bitterness in the finish and average carbonation. A really solid brew."
"D: Delightfully delicious and deceptively dangerous. Very hoppy and quite bitter (but not harsh), just not in the usual citrus and pine west coast style. Raggin Bitch this ain’t. Far more refined and drinkable. More balanced but still with some definite kick. A sort of very hoppy (and strong) pale with some tripel kick and even some saison-esque character."
"Sokay, nothing special to write home about."
"This IPA pours out as a cloudy yellowish gold color. The smell has a little bit of farmhouse funk and some earthy hop aromas on the nose. The taste has a hoppy start with a light Medicinal flavor in the background. The mouthfeel is a little heavy with some very minimal carbonation. The overall that I get from this beer is that I wasn't too impressed by it. It was average to me. I don't think I'd have to try it again."
"Medium body with healthy carbonation, very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Like how it stays so fresh and so clean. Dry at all times. Not bitter."
"Diverse flavor and enjoyable all the way through. Poured a cloudy, unfiltered yellow, with a nice white head that retained well throughout. Strong yeasty aroma, with citrus and herbs apparent. Similar taste, with heavy bready yeasts, and various bursts of citrus, herbs, cloves, hop bitterness, and just a touch of alcohol. Very complex and nice. Medium mouthfeel, and a very educational drink to the palate."
"Quite nice to look at, great aroma - a really full-flavored unfiltered Begian delight. Overall, a great feeling 8% ABV whose strong character and complexity would be perfect for food pairing."
"A thing I like about Belgian beer is that in Belgium, ""hoppy"" doesn't mean the same thing that it often does in America. It means a beer that may be sharp but it's also soft, especially when balanced nicely with a good wad of malt. It doesn't mean you'll be assaulted by a crate of sophomoric brewers with a fixation on arid bottles of grapefruit-juicy beer. Carolus is a good example of Belgium in a bottle: not too squishy, not very sharp but pointy enough to give a decent, refreshing sting. A good, nicely priced bottle of beer."
"On the palette it is soft and powdery with subtle fruit followed by a nice bracing bitter backbone and a clean lingering finish of soft yeast, bitter hops and a pleasant subtle tartness."
"D: Very nice and light, and something that I would be more than willing to have just one of. Across the board this brew stands out."
"Smell of pear and peach with a dash of pepper and clove. Taste of pitted fruit, unripe peach, sharp with layers of malty sweetness mingled with more sour fruity notes. Hoppy presence with cleansing mouthfeel, alternate sweet and sour with hops added makles for an interesting glass of contrasts. Decent Belgian, always welcome in my home."
"Murky golden-orange in colour, the gentlest of pours results in an inches worth of dense white foam on top. Great retention and lots of fine lace. Lots of little white floaties settled on the bottom of the glass. Love the look. An intense floral aroma gives way to baking bread and pepper. Strong lemon & leaf hop flavour and bitterness, malt gives it some mild sweetness (balance!), while the yeast brings a nice peppery flavour, a little bit of peachy fruit, and a hint of clove to the table. Light to medium bodied, with a fair amount of very fine bubbles. Feels light, but velvety and smooth. Lovely."
"Overall- All in all a very good brew, really hides the higher ABV very well, very sexy looking beer that translates into a very good drinking beer. Would definitely buy this one again."
"I've definitely never tried anything like this before. It's pretty good stuff but I don't think I'll be getting it again; Belgian pilsner isn't something I ever find myself craving. Not exactly my thing but definitely worth checking out."
"A nice offering, but not the best Gouden Carolus by any means."
"o-I'm going back to get more of this stuff. I really liked it."
"It's important to understand Hopsinjoor as a homage to American IPAs, not as a carbon-copy. I appreciate the beer a whole lot more having come to peace with that. Let's just call a spade a spade, this isn't something to reach for in the heat of a hop withdrawal - it's something better slowly savored with a fine meal. But under the guise of a strong Belgian pale ale, this is every bit the quality offering you can expect from Het Anker."
"O: An improved mouthfeel would certainly increase the overall score and I'd venture to say that my opinion would be different if this were the bottled beer. An excellent Belgian IPA nonetheless and I'll be on the lookout for a bottle for comparison."
"Really pleasant drinker, well made and the hopping in this is very well integrated while still being dominant - a rarity in the style."
"Having to deal with the carbonation explosion and the long pour made me grade this beer a little lower than I would like to have. A definite buy when on sale."
"This is a solid brew that I'd never refuse, but I wish it stood out more."
"Overall - This beer was very well balanced and probably the best Belgian IPA I've ever had. The alcohol was well hidden and the drinkability was through the roof. This is a fantastic beer that is a must try; I'll be sure to stock up on it."
"D - Very drinkable - maybe a bit too much!"
"Pretty fine brew. Alcohol crept up on me though. Will pick up another bottle or two for the cellar."
"Poured from a 750ML into a Golden Draak tulip glass. Large foamy head, not tight bubbles but rother large ones. The color is slightly hazy and bright golden. The carbonation is steady and medium. Teh aroma is of grassy, earthy hops; the European varities are what you smell and taste. The flavor to me is a little too much on the grassy side. The hops dominate the flavor throughout, a little bit of bandaide taste comes to mind. The spicy hops have no malt to give a counter balance. Unlike an American IPA this Belgian version does not coat your mouth with hop oils. Better in theory, IMO."
"Drinkability is just above average. It goes down quickly but you might not be reach for another immediately."
"The flavor starts with a surprising malt base that I didn't detect in the smell. The yeast is subdued until the swallow, but the hop is intense--very bitter with lots of grapefruit. Mild sourness in the aftertaste. Superb complexity...lots of variation in the flavors. The body is typical for the style while the carbonation is mildly prickly."
"Hops are strong enough, either the nose or mouth. Spicy fragrances like pepper, green and resinous hops enough but really does not increase the freshness of the beverage as in eg XX Bitter. The bitterness is sharp but not optimal because the coarse side and grassy hops takes over the top and the other flavors including citrus little that can be detected."
"The only real flaw for me is how much head results from the pour. Otherwise there's nothing to complain about here."
"To be honest I wasn't expecting much here, but was pleasantly surprised. The hops didn't overpower the beer yet added a substantial bitter and spicy punch that nicely complemented the spiciness from the yeast."
" right on."
"Drinkability is quite high. Alcohol is present but not overly so, and the taste is quite refreshing. Definitely a nice beer. Glad the LCBO brought this one in."
"D: From a flavour point of view, I thought this was very good; however the absurd foaminess made it a bit of a chore to pour."
"Pours a golden yellow colour with huge, pillowy white head. Lots of lacing down the glass. Smells of grassy hops with spicy Belgian yeast. Flavour has a mild sweetness to it. Aftertaste is leave some peach and spices. Pretty big carbonation for the style. A fairly nice Belgian IPA, but not one of my favourites either."
"D - This was a good beer but a little disappointing. Tasted like a typical strong Belgian Ale/Pale Ale to me and I expected more from the hops. Still good for what it was, but not what I was expecting for the style."
"Mild aroma that reminds me of any typical Belgian white beer. The taste is also more ""traditional white"" than I'd expected, given the ""Hopsinjoor"" name and ""IPA"" classification. There is a bitterness to the finish which is pleasant, but no sign of hops (to my west coast hop tastes) over the majority of the palate. A lot of fruit & yeast flavours, and would be a pleasant warm weather ale."
"D - Delicious. I'll be getting more of this for sure. Refreshing. No alcohol noticable. Dangerously drinkable."
"Pours a very hazy golden yellow colour with a ridiculous amount of puffy white head. Took me awhile just to be able to pour the entire beer. Very nice appearence though. Has a slight banana taste to add to the european hop bitterness. Quite drinkable and I kinda wish I was having this later on in the summer as it would be perfect for that weather. Very refreshing beer overall."
"Pours a hazy golden orange colour, Thick fluffy white head, Nice lace on the glass. Smell is of yeast, banana, green fruit, hop, citrus, slight malt and spicy fresh scents. Taste is of yeast, banana, citrus, hops, bready, slight alcohol, nice firm bitterness and a lightly sweet finish. Medium mouthfeel, nice aggressive carbonation, thin at times but still firm. Drinks well, ABV is hidden for the most part and is really quite satisfying to sip on. Solid belgian brew here."
"drinkability - very decent beer, i found the alcohol wasnt well hidden, but the beer was very good."
"Pours an opaque golden tangerine, lots of yeast in suspension with several fingers of soapy and lofty white head. Great dense retention and phenomenal lacing (walls of it!) Nose holds some banana, pear, light spiciness and spicy and floral hops. Sweet and dry it seems. Taste starts off dominated by the pale malt, dry and the carbonation falling on the tongue and palate is evident immediately. After a second, the pear and light fruits come through mid-palate. Finish is quite dry, with a small kick of the spicy and floral hops (Hopsinjoor uses Golding, Spalt, Hallertau and Saaz). Moderately warming notes from the alcohol, which become more pronounced with warming. High and active carbonation, and a reasonable drink. Good for an after dinner beer, just as I enjoyed it."
"D: The beer is quite quaffable considering the alcohol content (which is well masked) and strong amount of bitterness (the hop flavors are well balanced by the underlying malts)."
"Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor was orange-yellow in color and very cloudy. It had a large rocky white head with very good retention and lots of lacing. The smell was euro hops, yeast, and some light malt. The taste was hop forward with floral and earthy notes as well as malt, yeast flavors, and peppery spices. The finish was long and dry with some bitterness. The mouthfeel was good with a medium plus body and about medium carbonation, a bit creamy. The drinkability was outstanding and the alcohol well hidden. This is a very good beer. Highly Recommended."
"D: Quite drinkable, but not everyday fare. Nevertheless, easy drinkable and recommended for all."
"Glad to have these on the european market"
"This beer is awesome. If you don't like Belgian beer because of its sweetness this beer is for you. It carries itself with the exquisite craftsmanship of a Belgian brew with hints of hops well suited for an American palate."
"A nice Belgian IPA thats easy to drink, but not my favorite."
"This is a good brew. Plenty of flavor up front turns into a quick bitter finish. The balance is quite nice."
"D: A good beer from Het Anker but not their best by a long shot. Not all that different than other moderately hoppy Belgian pale ales."
"Yummy. I always love a Gouden Carolus and this one is no exception. Try it."
"D: can I have another please"
"This style is new to me as well as most Beligum made American style beers and since I have just the one bottle I'll have to do some further research on this topic."
"Pleasant, full, well structured."
"D. The hopsinjoor was a real treat indeed. A complex Belgian Ale but very easy to drink. More and more flavours became more evident with every sip. A beer that should be enjoyed with patience. At 8% you should have no problem sipping and savoring this tasty Belgian IPA / Pale Blonde to the very last sip. Highly Reccomended!"
"Drinkability: refreshing and tasty, this is still a big-flavored beer. I would love to have it again, but I wouldn't session this bad boy."
"D- this is pretty easy to drink for the percentage, i could definitely have a couple. nice."
"fairly easy to drink, worth a try, but there are better more readily available belgian ipas out there."
"drinkability - the more i sipped on this the more i enjoyed it - this would be the perfect beer the next time i eat sushi"
"D: This was a very tasty and complex beer with bitter and sour elements balanced with a bit of sweetness. It had a delicate scent and taste, with nice body. The alcohol was noticeable, but it was still fairly easy to drink. A solid Belgian IPA, though I personally would have preferred a bit more hops (especially tropical American ones, rather than the earthy Euro hops)."
"This one is just not for me. The whole throat coating is too distracting to enjoy the rest of the beer's attributes. Too bad, because I really like everything else I've had from this brewery."
"Mouth feel is very nice with carbonation and some wetness on the tongue. This beer is very fresh tasting, slightly warming and way drinkable. A very fine example of the style and could easily be a session beer, except the strength would make it a short session."
"D: A pleasant, interestingly complex Belgian IPA. I would have liked it to be a little hoppier - it's definitely more measured than I might have been expecting. That said, it's got a deep, subtle yeasty character that works pretty nicely. It's a good beer - just a little underpowered."
"A hint of warming alcohol. Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"poured from a 330ml bottle to a large 2 finger head slightly hazed dark golden color with sticky lacing,,smell is hoppy with spice, herbs,clove and earthy musty smells..taste is crisp hops and a musty flavor filled with yeast clove and fruit,,crisp hops are balanced with some malts,,mouth feel is medium with a crisp dry carbonation that is mixed with the fruit and hops...it is a very enjoyable well made delicious BIPA"
"Pours a golden body with huge head on top of a yeasty/orangish body with some other plush fruits as well as citric and spice with a minimum of malt. Light-to-medium body that is smooth and taste maintains the aroma as it is hoppy, citrusy, some spice and orange notes as a little ABV bite with some sweet sugary caramel malt. Not the greatest belgian ale but it is balanced and a good drink to have and has a little bit of everything."
"So...this beer is named for a hoppy puppet? Whatever. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises clove, pepper, rye bread, banana, light mandarin oranges, grapefruit, and a healthy load o' hoppy florals. The taste holds notes of ruby red grapefruit, sharp pine, hardcore flowers, cloves, and yeasty goodness. Are they sure there are hops in this? The body is a heavy light, with an active carbonation and a crisp, semi-dry finish. Overall, a nice, hoppy Belgian, though it's questionable whether or not I can rock very many of these in one sitting."
"This Belgian ""intensely hopped"" beer was average at best. Pleasant but nothing special, but not that there's anything wrong with that. Worth ordering/tasting if you've never sampled before. With so many poor examples of this style out there, this is a good all around drink."
"T: Dry taste, lots of malt and herbs, which highlights final widespread bitterness and flavored, alcohol perception is significant."
"Drinkability isn't to high, just a bitter, phenolic Belgian blonde. While I don't think think most native BIPAs travel well here, this one strikes me as a particularly bad example."
"Pours a hazy, golden yellow color with a big white head. In the aroma, coriander, yeasty, and dry. In the taste, coriander, a bit hoppy and a dry yeastiness. A small bitterness and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small hop and pinch of coriander in the aftertaste. Nice flavor and mellow hops, quite easy to drink."
"This beer pours a very cloudy pale yellow and has a super light and fluffy bright white head. The head has great staying power and leaves delicate lace as I savor this beer. The aroma is sweet with plenty of banana and green apple, as well as spicy herbal hops and a slight tartness. The flavor of this beer is quite surprising. For one thing, the 8 ABV really shows through, but it works for this beer and is actually a good thing. This beer is quite hoppy with plenty of herbal, grassy, lemony and spicy hops dominating the flavor. There is a definite sweet malt presence as well, but it seems like the hops and the Belgian yeast are the stars. I also get a bit of banana and green apple, maybe a bit of bubble gum. This beer sort of reminds me of a cross between an English IPA, a saison and a wit. The mouthfeel is on the light side of medium, and is very smooth with a nice slightly tart finish. This beer would be more drinkable if it had a lower ABV, but it still goes down pretty easily. A great find for a random buy beer."
"Drinkability: None of the flavors are too overwhelming, and thus the beer, despite it's ABV, could almost be considered sessionable, like a good IPA"
"Medium bodied with soft carbonation up front followed by crisp light fruit notes, alcohol warmth and pilsner malt all balanced by a decent earthy hop profile. Nicely balanced with hints of apple and pear, a slightly creamy body and a bitter dry finish."
"D - Pretty tasty. Could have a few."
"The beer had a medium body to it, great carbonation with the alcohol well hidden. The beer was extremely refreshing and extremely easy to drink. Overall, perhaps one of the best Belgian IPAs."
"This is so refreshing after all the over the top domestic IPA's. This beer pours a cloudy pale golden color with an extremely white foamy head. On the nose you definitely pick up the hops with aromas of grapefruit, banana, orange and corriander. The palate is medium bodied with a good sense of hops in which the bitterness is toned down some sweetness with flavors of grapefruit, orange, honey and toffee"
"Overall a total surprise and not a bad one at all. Hopsinjoor is more hoppy than I ever thought a Belgian beer could be."
"Drinkability: Fairly enjoyable. A quality, nicely complex Belgian brew with a dialed up hop character and bitterness."
"Great beer. Makes me wonder why I've gotten away from the Belgian styles that I used to drink almost exclusively."
"Very drinkable beer, really is a good example of a Belgian style IPA, one that combines a Belgian blond ale style and the fruity triple style with Belgian yeasts and a strong dose of hops."
"a good beer I'll have again, but there are many more I'd have first."
"Mouthfeel is full with the carbonation giving a very smooth and creamy feel."
"A style Iam just now starting to go to,there are some things I like,and dont like of the style.Poured into a large tulip glass a light hazed blond color with a huge blooming white head,to much so I think.A mix of leafy-lemony hop,slight funk,and yeasty spice in the nose.A lighter but creamy feel in the mouth,very nice,almost airy in a good way.Flavors are medicinal and herbal from the onset,some phenols come in as well.Well its not the American hopped Raging Bitch,but I respect the beer,just not enough of the hop oomph I look for."
"Oh my gosh, is this good beer! Lawd gawdamighty. Didn't take much to pour a huge finely frothed off white head and some lace. Color is a cloudy amber. Aroma is spicey, hoppy, malty, very yeasty, and a hint of phenol. Flavor's about the same. Great body and supreme carbonation. Great bitter finish. Make a good apertif. No apparent alcohol. Killer burps."
"From 750 ml bottle into a Unibroue tulip. Pillowey white head, one inch above a golden/straw body. Aroma is of some lemony citrus, a bit of funk, and some wispy tartness. Taste to me personally is a bit more towards the saison side of the spectrum than an IPA, I'm sure the yeast has everything to do with that. No matter, the beer is delicious and refreshing."
"Overall very good. Hop loves will like this beer. However the hops are not aromatic, so it is not like a DIPA in anyway. But it is a good example of a classic Belgian style with the hops turned up a bit. A great food beer to go with some robust end of winter meals!"
"I was expecting a little hoppiness, and instead I got a Belgian pale ale. Not that this is a bad beer, but you won't be getting that little extra sumpthin' in the way of those little green flowers."
"Notes: European hops used are apparent as it doesn't have the same fruitiness from hops as American IPAs and DIPAs, so if you are expecting something similar to one of these, you may be disappointed. I enjoyed it though, as it was was like a BSPA with the added complexity of the multiple hops."
"Drinkability... well if you like those previously mentioned attributes then this beer could be amazingly drinkable. I don't believe in drain pours.... and this beer is very lucky I don't."
"Drinkability- It's quite nice, especially if you swirl the beer around after you've poured it and let some of the carbonation escape. (Don't do it in the bottle, since this beer is bottle-conditions)."
"Lots of carbonation in the mouth. Almost a tripel feel to this beer with a spicy biting alcoholic note to it. The overall feel of the beer is medium bodied, drinkability is fine. Bitterness grows as you drink. I'm not sure I'd classify it as an IPA but its a good beer."
"D: Oh yeah, I'd have this beer again. I couldn't even really tell that it was 8% ABV... which is why I'd have to be careful about controlling my intake."
"Reviewed from my notes. Served in a tulip glass. The beer has an interesting yellow color; it is cloudy and translucent. There is a thick head of white foam. It leaves impressive lacing. There is carbonation rising in the glass, as well as a number of small bubbles attached to the side of the glass. It has a warm hoppy aroma and some earthy yeast. The beer tastes a bit sweet at first. There is a gentle hop bitterness and a slight peppery bite in the finish. The menu description claims there is a citrus flavor as well, and I think I can taste it, but it may be entirely through the power of suggestion [as I type this up the day after taking the notes, I can still clearly recall the pepper aspects; that doesn't usually happen to me]. It has a light body with a bit of mouthcoating. There's plenty of carbonation and a bit of a peppery burn, but nothing like the feeling of a chili beer. I find this beer to be fairly drinkable. To me, it should be enjoyed at a moderate pace; not too fast, but it doesn't need to be sipped over an hour either. It's a quality beer, but I don't think I'd order more than one in an evening."
"Notes: My third Gouden Carolus beer (Had the Noel and the Tripel prior to this) and I have been happy with every one of them. Next up is the Carolus d'Or (Grand Cru of the Emperor)."
"D- I could certainly drink a 750 of this with ease. but at the price, I might reach for a more affordable American version next time."
"O: great more subdued hop presence than belgian IPA's using american oriented hop, alc rougher with warmth, lots of pear/candy, very nice belgian hop presence"
"The body is a hazy dark straw colour with a big creamy white head and lots of carbonation. The nose is very fruity, there is lots of citrus, alongside a subtle toffee and a clear yeastiness. The taste is fresh and crisp with more fruity citrus but with a slight dry edge. There is more Belgian yeast in the taste with a slight biscuity taste towards the end alongside a floral bitterness. The flavours are very dry and crisp, which makes this a brilliant summer beer. The Belgian IPA style is growing on me and this is one of the better ones."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a VERY thick white head. Aroma is crisp, strong and malty with a fruity hint, more like a high-grade lager. Flavor is hoppy and sharp, only a little bitter, with a fruity undertone and a bit of a tinny taste. Texture is fizzy and smooth, leaving a hoppy and fruity finish."
"D: Like all beers with Charles V on a horse, excellent, i liked the way that hides the abv in the smell, taste and feel."
"This has toppled McChouffe/Houblon Chouffe as my fave Belgian Blonde. This is the capstone of the Pyramid imho."
"A little bitter for my taste, but still a very good beer."
" It is not as complex as many of the Belgians I have tried but it is very fine beer. It is drinkable and could be paired with cheese and fish or chicken dishes or enjoyed alone, or with friends or with a nice salad... or maybe tuna or linguine, or tuna AND linguine, or some type of quiche, maybe a tuna and linguine quiche. No not that. Stick with the chicken, some kind of white sauce and Parmesan or the like."
"Taste is lightly winey throughout, with light sweet fruitiness, some bread throughout. It has definite hoppiness that builds to a hoppy, lightly bitter finish with leaves, hay, grassy-peppery spiciness, all lingering in the aftertaste. It is a bit too winey, though, and a bit too thin in feel and body."
"Wine Specialist/$8.99/750 ml"
"Orange body with a big fluffy head. Smell is primarily of oranges with a generous dose of hops. Taste is orangey and slightly sweet. Not cloying or oppressively phenolic like some Belgians, though. Maybe it's because the hop bitterness balances it out. Mouthfeel is a bit diappointing, rather thin. Overall, though, Het Anker knocked this one out of the park."
"D=definitely enjoyable and drinkable, watch the ABV, though not extreme."
"D - This is a really really good beer... Undeniable Belgian... Insanely drinkable... The 8% ABV is well hidden... I would gladly welcome the chance to revisit in the future..."
"One of the most intense, complex tastings that doesn't loose its deft balance of flavors. Truly impressive!"
"I appear to be in a minority on this one. Poured a cloudy yellow with a huge head that displayed pretty good retention. The aroma was kind of a euro lager skunky. I couldn't taste much of the hops bitter, the carbonation tended to disguise everything. I'm not a fan of the Belgian IPA idea, just way too much carbonation. As it warmed, I did get some bitter aftertaste. The feel was light bodied with tons of carbonation. Drinkability was OK. Not terrible, just not my cup of tea, or stein of beer, or goblet of beer...whatever."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and nice. All around good drink."
"Overall - An excellent beer !! Highly recommended !! Pretty unusual for a Belgian..."
"Tasty but at the same time not something I'm going to be going back to all that often. It is a tough beer for drinkability as you need time to contemplate it at the ABV certainly means that it isn't a chugger."
"Soft and creamy with mild-moderate bitter hop - kind of Noble/European soft and herbal. Soft malt attack. Almost wheaty. Notes of alcohol - well hidden. Spicy hops juxtaposition the soft malt nicely. Ample bitterness. Nice tartness. Soft musk/watermelon. Finishes slightly dry with mild herbal bitterness. Tastes good. Feels good. Very good drinkability."
"A fragrant and exciting drop, bursting with character. It lacks a bit of sweetness and body on the palate, but otherwise very fine indeed."
"D - Overall Hopsinjoor was an enjoyable beer and certainly an interesting experience. However, 750ml is a bit much in a sitting, and I found myself growing weary of the big medicinal notes coupled with moderate bitterness after a couple of glasses. Given my limited experience with Belgian IPAs, this is probably the best I've had so far."
"Drinkability: soooo smooth. I wish I can find this where I live. I can become a drunkaholic."
"It is every person's dream right? A strong, elegant Belgian pale ale twisted with an IPA, gotta love the Belgian IPA. I really love this beer, a classic."
"SLightly tart and finishes super clean and dry. A very easy beer to drink. Another really nice Belgian IPA."
"A very drinkable belgian IPA that i was fortunate enough to try from draught. Will definitely pick up a few bottles of this to my next trip to belgium."
"Drinkability: 330 mL definitely wasn't enough - should have gone for the 750! No alcohol burn at all, a solid base beer, and a really thorough, clean, bright hop addition make for a really enjoyable drink. I wouldn't quite put this on top of the Chouffe BIPA, and I do admittedly have a bit of a bias for this style (it's in my top 3), but I can honestly say this is an enjoyable beer, appropriate for the season, stylistically true, and damn tasty to boot. Recommended."
"One hell of a beer. I would personally have liked it more if it had been a tad less hoppy, but I wouldn't hold my personal tastes against the quality of the beer. This is a winner all around."
"This isn't just about dumping hops in, the hop complexities are wonderful, with just the right touch of malt to round it out. A wonderful, strong, Belgian IPA. Another winner from this great brewery!"
"Good beer. Tough to drink more than one though."
"M&D- Not getting the same bitterness as some have said so I guess the hops have faded but there is just a touch of ummph to this on the tounge to suffice. Hopsinjoor is smooth and medium bodied with a good amount of carb as witnessed by the huge amount of rising bubbles. Drinkability, well let's just say that I should of bought a bigger bottle."
"Drinkability - Couldn't drink too many of these, big sweet beer with a good amount of alcohol."
"Great beer and the main fallback is that this wasn't offered as a magnum or jeraboam as I wanted to be sipping it all afternoon long."
"It is interesting to see more Belgian breweries experimenting with hoppier, drier, more bitter beers. Personally I think it can only be a good thing, as on my recent (Jan '09) visit to Belgium I found that far too many beers were under hopped and oversweet. While this Belgian IPA isn't quite up to the standard of the Trappist ales, it is still a very good beer and should appeal to the American hop heads."
"This beer looks great. The color is a glowing straw yellow with an enormous head that leaves craggy clumps of foam on the sides of the glass. On the other hand, pretty much all of the top Belgian IPA's look great, so it's hard to give full marks. The aroma is of juicy tangerines and interesting dry and earthy Belgian yeast. The flavor is like a light and hoppy tripel. There's a great sweet malt backbone, some phenolic character, sour apples, hops like a bite of a very ripe apricot and a refined, complex Belgian yeast. The feel is creamy and light for the alcohol content. It's quite drinkable. The malt sweetness is balanced by an excellent hop bite."
"Overall, a very tasty beer and one I was glad to try. Drinks very easily with a nice hoppy, dry finish."
"D: Extremely sippable. I really enjoyed this brew. Then again, all of the Het Anker brews that I've tried so far (Gouden Carolus, and Cuvee van de Keizer red and blue) have never struck a wrong chord."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable Belgian IPA right on par with what you would expect."
"M&D: soft on the palate, which is marvellously carbonated as witness to successful bottle-conditioning, while the light body helps elevate the weight of 8%abv. effortlessly. Compared with my recent encounters with three other ""Belgian IPAs", this one keeps the original Gouden Carolus beer base loyally, as hops are not incorporated in a rather unconventional, American way; rather, hops are felt most explicitly in the level of higher-than-normal bitterness, but overall the impact is deeply intertwined with a very clean palate that the yeasty Belgian ales are renowned for. All in all, this is a very enticing hoppy ale, even thirst-quenching, thanks to the overall balance."
"nice, and very interesting, not something you could drink every day though."
"Pours a pale yellow orange color with a very large white head. A tight nose bellows from the meringue, another BA sampling with us notes that this batch may be in 'shock' from recent shipment to the US, a very good point, mainly a mild Belgian yeast and fresh piney/peppery hop aroma that subtly intensifies as the beer warms. Sharp, well carbonated and assertive in character, bitter on the back end, some minty wintergreen, some crackery malt sweetness, subtle peppery spice and little alcohol presence. I havent tried the Duvel Tripel Hop yet but i imagine it to be something like this, although i expected this one to be way more hoppy than it is. Fizzy, but very drinkable none the less, a damn fine beer and definitely a more balanced interpretation of the style."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good beer with some complexity and is worth drinking for a long time."
"Served in a Gouden Carolus goblet. Poured a hazy, pale orange; clarity was somewhat hazy. Head quickly dissipated into a heavy skim with tiny ringlets. Nose was very muted - all I picked up was some citrus. Flavor profile was very muted as well; citrus, maybe some wheat, and a hops presence that was very much in the background; however, some bitterness lingered between quaffs. Mouthfeel was light and effervescent and finished dry. My first Belgian IPA - I liked it, but I didn't love it. I was expecting a little more of a hops presence, but it was fairly drinkable."
"A delight."
"Got a small bottle for $7 at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Poured into a large snifter, the beer is a bit of a foamer and really needs to warm up before it comes to life. Even then the hops aren't that big, though flowery hops dominate the taste. There's a light bready flavor in the background and behind the more citrusy hops in the aroma. Of course, as a good Belgian, the boy is drinkable, relatively light for its strength, and complimented by typical, sweet Belgian spice."
"A real pleasure. Belgian IPA's are complex and interesting, and don't fry your tastebuds like many of their American counterparts."
"D - for such a big beer, the relatively light body and amazing taste make it dangerous at 8% the alcohol is apparent, yet it is really hard for me to put it down."
"This is the first belgian IPA I've had and it was good but not what I had expected. I anticipated a belgian pale with more hops. Overall a good beer and worthy of a try."
"On tap at Leon's in Decatur. Pours to a hazy yellow-straw color with a thick white pillowy head (like a good Belgian Strong Ale) that lingers well and leaves good lacing. Strong pleasant nose of spices, wheat dough, apples and citrus fruit, along with a hint of alcohol as beer warmed slightly. Mouthfeel tingly and slightly hoppy, and the taste follows the lead of the nose. Rounds to a nice pleasant finish."
"A hint of warming alcohol. Medium body, with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is a little over-carbonated for me, and it wasn't something I personally found super drinkable, but I would definitely look for this again--I feel like this is a style I'll have to ease into and am maybe not ready to fully appreciate at present."
"I love this style because of the different interpretations that brewers have of the idea of a hoppy Belgian. The balance between Belgian twang/funk and hop bitterness that Hopsinjoor achieves is remarkable."
"light to medium body. starts smooth, then touch of astringent resins and faint acidic note in the finish before fading. crisp, prickly carbonation is lively but not overdone and gives moments of fluffiness."
"had it again about a year later and it wasn't as broad hop wise as before. in a evening of drinking in brussels... it was too one dimensional. better in bigger bottle too."
"On the palate the carbonation carries through wonderfully with balanced hops with sugary sweet malt in the background. In some ways this is like a hoppy witbier, with some of the candied flavors coming through (and appearance)."
"Pours a hazy straw yellow/gold, huge fluffy white head forms, big bubbles, drops some big lace spirals on its slow journey down to a thick ring, great retention. Smell is neat, very spicy and herbal, some floral, bit of caramel and biscuity malt, sugary, light grapefruit, malty, pretty neat noble hoppiness. Taste is sweet and malty at first, some sugar and biscuit, floral hops, spicy and herbal, some fruit in the finish, strawberries and apricot, touch of wheat, very dry in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation, pretty cool stuff. I like the big hoppy beers with noble hops, real nice juxtaposition of the US hop monsters. Thanks Derek!"
"Overall this is defenitely one of the better examples of belgian style IPA out there. Anyone looking to learn about the style should defenitely be picking this one up. This style of brew is quickly growing on me, and its really nice to see both solid originals like this one, and new school melded examples on this side of the pond (Wrath, Le Freak, Saturn, etc). Great beer."
"drinkability is good. nicely balanced. smooth, interesting, and very enjoyable. the use of noble rather than american hops gives this belgian ipa - typically a US-belgian combo - a neat slant."
"11.2 oz bottles poured into a La Fin tulip, very slowly which didn't see to matter as a ginormous rocky Belgian head sprung to life which was kept afloat on top of the golden body for a ridiculous amount of time from the fine, streaming carbonation bubbles. This look wonderful! Excellent alcoholic hoppy aroma coming from this beer. Loads of Euro noble hops, Belgian yeast, a touch of mint and other spices, light apples, and a nice booziness. It almost smells like Duvel with triple the hops. Flavor is great. Though I'm not a huge fan of noble hops, this has a great bitterness to it. It well balanced, somewhat sweet at first, but becomes dry and crisp on the finish. Effervescent mouthfeel, lots of strong carbonation, crisp, and very drinkable. Yeah.... I like this beer. Belgian IPAs are one of favorite styles and this one did not disappoint."
"D- Drinkable for an 8%, and I find the high level of carbonation pleasant."
"I got grassy, hoppy aroma and the taste matched up exactly with that what I was smelling. There was also a definite wheat taste to it as well. Almost like a cookie dough before you add the sugar. I enjoyed this one."
"Pours a cloudy pale light amber color with a HUGE stiff white head that fades to lacing, some of it 3D. Visible sediment on the bottom of the bottle. Highly effervescent, pours actively fizzy. The smell is all about the earthy Belgian yeast, apple and pears with tart notes. Highly carbonated, the mouth feel light and the flavor is as tart as suggested in the nose. A real sipper; a little too lively for me. I also find that the 8% ABV is pretty evident by a dull burn on the way down."
"The first impression of this beer was when opened, the beer pretty much exploded out of the bottle with enormous amount if foam, a bad 1st impression. The foam...well what can I say, there was a lot of it - it was very light wheat, clung to the glass bigtime. The color was light golden wheat which had a hazy color like a wheat beer and somewhat honey hue. Taste had a very wheat overtone with little hops feel. Mouthfeel -smooth, not impressed. Drinkability - If it wasn't for the foam, it might have a good session."
"D- This beer had some nice yeasty wheat flavors but the hops were very soft and not at all in the aroma. This made the overall beer a bit bland."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and full, with a light body that feels bigger than it is because of the spot-on carbonation."
"D - Not something I'd drink heaps of but worth trying for sure. I'd LOVE to try it fresh."
"This beer is very drinkable. I appreciate the balance of Houblon but I appreciate the greater hop flavor of the Hopsinjoor. I could be very happy for a very long time trying to determine which of these two that I prefer."
"Had this on-tap at the Stable poured into correct goblet, slightly chilled. The pour had a half centimeter head over nicely colored unfilter brew. Smell of floral hops, belgian yeast. Taste begins almost as belgian tripel with hops coming to the front quickly and remaining present to a slightly bitter finish though pleasing throughout. Not too much alcohol feel though this is beginning to shift to the realm of heavy beers at 8%ABV. Floral, slight honey notes, yeast and hoppiness make this quite enjoyable...nothing over the top though it's quite good. I've got a strong affinity for this brewery."
"Thanks to Marikka's Bierstube for carrying the beer."
"Taste is true Belgian with a light fruity yeast and a bready and biscuity malt profile. The good thing about this beer is that it holds on to the Belgian beer tradition, which means that the beer is above average bitter, but seems to retain most of it's balance. The hop has some lemony notes and seems like a proven Styrian - Saaz combination. Not comparable with any other IPA, this is like a hopped up blonde, still good."
"D - A bit one dimensional overall for belgian IPA's that sucks the mouth of any moisture. The beer is very astringent IMO, maybe not the best bottle or just beyond its prime. I may try it again, but not likely"
"EDIT: Having had it several more times, it's one of my favorites of the style. Lots more bright citrus & apple in the taste than I'd had before. Maybe I just wasn't in the right setting the first time or something, but I really like it now. I boosted the taste by 1.5 points, the mouthfeel by 1 point, & the drinkability by 1.5 points."
"This would be good for a ""just finished a term paper"" occasion. I'd give this one another go anytime."
"Moral of the story...where are the hops?"
"Good mouthfeel and overall this is a great brew. Can't wait to find some guaranteed fresh ones."
"This is fantastic. Hopsinjoor is one that both Belgian beer geeks and novices would enjoy equally. I didn't really forget how great Belgian beer can be, but being issued this reminder was a wonderful way to rediscover what many of us have known for a long time. On the first day of spring, no less. Cheers!"
"More like a hoppy tripel. (and not even that hoppy.)"
"A decent take on the style but I could do without the sour mouthfeel. It detracts from the style, unless they used some form of wild yeast. Otherwise, it's worth a try, especially if you like the style."
"Definitely an interesting style, and one that I'm curious to explore further. Thanks Derek for the opportunity to try this!"
"D: This beer drinks dangerously easy and displays a balance and complexity that defines what a Belgian IPA should be. First class all the way."
"D- This is another very good Belgian IPA. I am finding myself partial to this style-and this is my favorite of the Gouden Carolus offerings. A wonderful beer and good tasting experience. Reinds me of the first Fantome Saison that I had."
"D- This is a great beer, something I definitely wouldn't mind purchasing again. Recommended!"
"It was good enough to buy a bottle to take home and do it again."
"D: Very drinkable considering what a flavour punch it packs. The strong flavours are balanced enough that they don't become tiring - I think I could keep drinking this one all night."
"Bottle: Poured a bright pale yellow color ale with a super huge foamy head with perfect retention and perfect lacing. Aroma of dry European hops with typical Belgian malt base. Taste is a nice mix between some typical Belgian malt with great notes of European dry hops with some subtle floral notes. Easily drinkable with a full body and perfect carbonation with no hints of alcohol. Very well done and a bit more hops would have been even better. Quality brew from a quality brewer."
"the tasty was quite nice. I am digging some of the recent belgian beers who are hopping it up a bit. it had a nice malty base with a beautiful well balanced hop blanket sitting on top. had a nice medium body but left a distinct layer of stickiness in the mouth. a good drinkable beer."
"The drinkability also goes to that summer deck sort of thing. It feels really good and it is very easy to sip. Not too hoppy. Probably wouldn't hurt from just a tiny hint more of citrus-type hops. I will be drinking more of this."
"D-A wonderfully complex and eminently drinkable, fruity, spicy, sweet brew. A nice combination of flavours with enough hop pop to make sure you know you are enjoying an IPA."
"This is a very drinkable beer and my expectations where met."
"Drinkability: this is a nice version of a Belgian IPA that is easy to drink over a period of time."
"Overall, i like this one, very enjoyable, probably quite good on a hot afternoon, but not one of my absolute favorites."
"Pours a cloudy, golden yellow color. 5/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, some slight fruit, and hops. Fits the style of a Belgian IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with high carbonation levels present. Tastes of slight alcohol up front, sweet malt, fruit (banana), and hops strongly in the finish. There's also an associated dryness that is not too strong, but leaves you wanting more! Overall, a really good full tasting beer - worth a try."
"Truly a unique, phenomenal brew."
"D - This was quite unimpressive compared to other Belgian Ipa's I have had. The over carbonation did not help."
"D: A nice beer overall. Beware of the kick on this one, as the alcohol hides out of sight."
"Pours with a thin, pure-white head that goes away quickly; the color of the beer is like a pale tangerine, and quite cloudy. The smell is beeswax and honey, meyer lemon, maybe some mink oil. The taste is honey, lemon, cedar, leather, with a long, bitter hop finish. It's mildly carbonated, with a full, robust feel. One to drink slowly, but not just a sipper. Great beer."
"A very elegant example of this style."
"Even though I prefer the tropical fruitiness of American hops, European hops can be equally great in the right hands. Brouwerij Het Anker definitely has the right hands. They aren't my favorite Belgian brewery for nothing. Everything that I've had from BHA has been excellent to spectacular. Hopsinjoor is the latter, without question. Two thumbs waaaay up."
"My first Belgium IPA, wasn't exactly sure what to expect but it was great, I now want to explore the style."
"Poured a cloudy, pale yellow with a huge, volatile head. Smelled dry, bitter (hoppy), with a serious hint of pineapple. Flavor is powerful and sharp but not heavy... hops and alcohol dominate. It's challenging drink, but in a good way. Alcohol, sweetness, and carbonation dominate the mouth... sweetness lingers."
"D - Pretty solid Belgian pale ale with plenty of fruity hop bitterness and a spicy palate, albeit a slightly weird-tasting finish that is difficult to describe. Glad to have had the opportunity to try this rarity."
"D: Very tasty, a fine example of this emerging style. Combines a medley of fine European hops with the unmistakable sweet/spicy Belgian yeast. A bit 'big' at 8%, but a reasonable sipping ale. Glad that this is now available in Portland; hope it's here to stay."
"The beer pours a hazy pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale malt scent along with a dry and earthy yeast aroma. It's mildly bitter, but the yeast character hides most of it. The taste is good as well. It has an interesting flavor that boasts of pale malts and Belgian yeast. These too elements created about 80% of the taste, with the hops finishing it off. It goes down bone dry with considerable bitterness up front and in the finish. It does have much in the way of ""hop"" taste, but the bitterness is undeniable. The yeast character is incredible. It seems to work well with hops to create a unique experience. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. I like this beer, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I was hoping for an American IPA with a Belgian twist. This is the total opposite; just a hopped up Belgian ale. Still good."
"A nice melding of styles that seems to happen a lot more frequently recently as the Belgians seem to have taken on some of the fascination about hops American Craft Brewers have held for quite a while."
"D, notes: Very nice bitterness that is well complimented by the perfume character."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured hazy golden with a thin white head but great lacing. Smells a touch grainy, with some sweet tripel tropical fruit aromas followed by some earthy hops. The taste is similar. Begins as a somewhat sweet tripel with tropical fruit notes, clove, and candi sugar but transitions into a flavor of quite bitter herbaceous hops that linger. The hops astringency dominates the finish in the mouthfeel, but overall I like this combination. Sweeter than some of the Belgian IPAs out there, and more bitterly hopped than many of them as well, the flavors play nicely off of each other, especially with the tripel tasting base."
"D: At 8%, this is a slow-going ale. The flavors are so dominant though that tastebud fatigue can easily set in."
"D: This really is an easy drinker. It is a great tripel but I think it needs more hops for a Belgian IPA. I like tripels so maybe I am a bit biased. This is still a good beer. However I would recommend the Houblon for those wishing to explore the style as IMO it still sets the benchmark. This is something definitely worth trying though."
"Then again, it could be that, with such Belgian effervescence, my palate is trained to expect something sweet, yet something else emerges. I'm pretty sure I like Hopsinjoor, but I'm just as sure that like is as far as I'll go to express my fondness for it. A good, distinct beer, Hopsinjoor is worth the try, and hopefully your palate makes heads or tails out of it better than I could."
"Poured from a 750ml caged and corked bottle and served in a tulip. This beer poured a cloudy pale golden color with a big, off-white, meringue head. Very slow to settle, leaving behind heavy, bubbly lacing. The aroma was made up of a huge dose of grassy hops, light lemon, citrus, pale malt, and just a bit of graham cracker. The flavor included soft, grassy hops, mellow citrus, a hint of honey, slightly sweet pale malts, and more herbal, earthy hops. Huge hop presence, but not overly bitter. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and lush. Ample carbonation, yet very soft on the tongue. Mostly dry at the finish. Dangerously drinkable! One of the best hoppy Belgians I have tried. The herbal Euro hop profile is a welcome change of pace. Quite tasty!"
"But the bittering is not too strong, it's just nice... interesting... refreshing... in any words, it's just perfect"
"Drinks average, this just seemed so disjointed"
"Overall, this is a good beer. I don't know how much of it I could drink at a sitting, but I can definitely enjoy it on occasion."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, despite rather high alcohol content, reminiscent of a Westmalle Triple but more ""accessible"" as an appetizer drink"
"beneath the whole thing lies a suitable light malt backbone."
"Great looking beer. A nice golden color with a thick and lacy beige head. The nose has subtle hops over candy malts and Belgian yeasts. The taste has again quiet floral hops over cramy malts and peppery yeast. Crisp body with delicate carbonation. Another great beer from Het Anker."
"Pours a cloudy honey gold color with a thin off white head that lasts with light lacing throughout that fades back to the head. Sweet fruity aromas of belgian yeast, vanilla, lemon, banana and cloves. Sweet malt and honey flavor up front with lemon, grapefruit, and floral hops, banana & bubblegum in the middle with a slightly bitter finish and a lingering sweetness. Light body, medium carbonation, very smooth and crisp beer with a dry finish. Great drinkability, the balance of bitterness and sweetness is excellent."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"Poured into a Duvel tulip. Cloudy, yellowish-amber appearance. Lots of tropical fruit and earthy, spicy tones in the nose. Hard to contain this one with the crazy Belgian head, which forms a giant pearlescent pillow atop this tasty brew. Huge peppery spiciness on the tongue, presumably a product of the masterful mingling of four different hop varieties, along with tropical fruit flavors. Just awesome. Nice, substantial mouthfeel with lively carbonation. At 8.00% it can get tricky to have more than a few glasses. But boy, are those few good."
"Drinkability is nice. ABV is up a bit but two of these would be a pleasant drink."
"D - This is a very nice Belgian IPA. Love the floral and citrusy qualitites."
"Deep yellow-gold body with a slight haze and lemony edges. Big, rocky, marshmallow of a soft-white head. Terrific lacing. Nose of cotton candy malts, yeast, tropical fruit, pepper, and big spicy sea-air funk hops. Nice. Starts out with a tantalizing mix of sweetish malts and spicy hop bitterness. Soft candy and tropical fruit sweetness swells mid-palate, before big spicy, peppery, herbal, minty, funky, medicinal hop bitterness takes over. Yum. Bitterness and hop flavors carry into the finish with lingering fruit malt and powdered sugar sweetness. Full-bodied with a very active, rollickingly carbonated feel. Maybe a little too bubbly! Otherwise, very well done."
"Smell is also reminiscent of Duvel. Candy citrus hoppiness is prevalent, smells like a Trappist trippel! Taste is complete with a range of flavors from sweet fruit to the bitter rinds. 8% abv is obvious but not bad. A definite kick to this one. It's my first Belgian IPA, and my take on it is more Belgian than IPA. But overall it's awesome, I'll definitely get this again."
"Drinkability: My first experience in this style. Not at all what I expected but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. Pretty much a perfect juxtaposition of a Belgian strong ale and a ""typical"" IPA."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability..Very similar in taste progression, to other belgian IPAs I have had before. Boozier than DeRanke XX Bitter, but not as much as Chouffe Houblon. One goes a long way, then back to my IPAs :P"
"It was real nice"
"I'm addicted to the fruitiness of Het Anker's beers, but I had no idea that throwing a bunch of noble hops into the mix would work so well. Very well executed. Great beer. I'll be getting this again."
"750mL corked and caged bottle into a Duvel snifter. Pours a hazy pale orange with an abundant frothy slowly diminishing head. Aroma is some Earthy floral hops and slight Belgian yeast. The taste is a nice amount of hops just slightly overpowering the sweet malts and Belgian spice, good balance for the style. The beer is medium bodied with some slight sticky alcohol. This is certainly an enjoyable beer, but not up to the standard of Houblon Chouffe."
"Drinkability is good here. Would like to drink a lot of these in a row."
"A European hop smell, a great mouthfeel of white foam on light yellow that cushions the mouth and makes this Belgian IPA quite palatable. Dangerously drinkable. The aroma is somewhat musty and strange from a North American perspective because of the hops used:Golding, Spalt, Hallertau and Saaz."
"Drinkability - This would undoubtedly have to be the best drink on the planet coming out of a cask. From the bottle it is only slightly short of perfect. It is high-quality Belgian brewing at its best. I'm a big fan of this brewery to begin with but this definitely put me in the ""sold"" column."
"D - Drinkability is good. This one stays somewhat light and refreshing throughout. The complexity in the flavor keeps it pretty interesting. Given the bottle size and abv, the limit is one. Het Anker has a very solid beer with the Hopsinjoor. Glad I got to try it."
"Overall, it's an okay beer. For the price I would definatley go to many other beers, such as Orval, Duvel, Poperings Hommelbier, Le Freak, etc. I will pass on this one in the future."
"Overall, tastes like an imperial pilsner. It's not well balanced, fiarly flawed, and doesn't really appeal to me."
"D- Despite being a bit harsh in the finish, this remains just incredibly easy to drink"
"drinkability is fairly good, though this isn't quite as dry as some examples, and the alcohol is a little on the hot side."
"Thanks to RblWthACoz for hooking this up."
"Hopsinjoor wouldn't be the first Belgian IPA I would recommend to a newcomer, but if you've got a nose for these kinds of beers, absolutely pick up a bottle. Unfortunately I doubt I'll be back, as Green Flash Le Freak is about 1/3 the price."
"Out of a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Pours a hazy golden pale orange color with a huge soapy pure white head that left some chunk lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of Belgian pale malt, spicy Belgian yeast, candi sugar and a stale metallic hop towards the end. Not very strong in the hop department. The taste is your typical BSPA, sweet candi sugar, flowery, honey, some champagne grapes. Then there is a stale grassy hop that hits towards the end. Nothing special but enough to balance out the sweetness. Well carbonated may be an understatement, very champagne like. It could use some softer carbonation to help the flavors stand out. There is a nice balance to this beer. Starts off sweet but is neutralized by the bitter end. A very good BIPA but not my favorite. It hits spot on the BSPA flavors but could use a bit more of a fresher or stronger hop presence."
"Mouthfeel is nice - good soft bubble but the alcohol is a little strong. I'd like to taste this fresh. Next time I'm in Belgium..."
"HV"
"Purchased: Liquor Max; Loveland CO"
"I prefer the other offerings from this brewery but it was a nice beer."
"I'd say that this would be a great Triple, even without the hops. The hops certainly give it a good twist, a little more complexity, and a familiar flavor. Recommended."
"Finally caught up with a bottle of this stuff, thanks Biscodoll for the info and heads up...Belgian bomber, caged/corked w/o freshness info. Pours super cloudy, medium apricot, near white head, hugely heady, moderately retentive, marainge producing, leaving TONS of wild and crazy lace and sheeting. The nose is heavily citric and generally tropical fruity and minty. I'm a sucker for the style so I was excited to try this stuff. No disappointments here, plenty of biting hops up front, Belgian yeasts and peppery spice all over the mouth and a bright, flavorful finish to seal the deal. Nice beer. Belgian lovers rejoice and go get some of this stuff."
"Overall a solid Belgian IPA, but not complex enough to make it a must-taste. However, if you have the chance to partake in one of these, it's certainly worth a shot."
"Bottom line: An excellent example of a Belgian IPA, I think, as the only others I've had of the style were De Ranke XX and Houblon Chouffe and I loved them. I say, see it? Buy it!! Thanks again, Joe!!"
"Notes: Need to get a fresher bottle."
"D - The alcohol is there but supports the body of this ale so well it practically whispers. This is one of the finest ales I've ever tasted, but aside from steamed mussels or fish & chips I'm not confident this is the most food friendly. It's simply too complex and delicious - drink it solo."
"I didn't initially take to this beer. I liked it, but it seemed almost like an odd man out to my taste buds. However, I quickly adjusted, and ended up finding it delicious, as well as very drinkable."
"Perfect appearance. A light orange colored beer with a massive head that could only come from Belgium. Frothy, fully developed, huge head that forms great shapes, laces and lasts very well. Nose is alarmingly vibrant and full of hop (spice, peach, lemon) and nice yeast derived smells (farmhouse, leather.) Flavor is devastatingly complex and utterly amazing. Was expecting something good after reading Ernest's and Jeff's reviews, but this is beyond good. Starts off dry, peppery, spicy and all hop accented, then settles into an amazingly well extracted vinous-like range of flavors, which leads into the finish that lasts for at least 10 seconds. Wasn't expecting to be blown away by a beer tonight, but was."
"Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor is a Belgian hop bomb, and a darned fine one! The potent flavors and aromas of the drink command the drinker's undivided attention, but do so without overpowering the palate. Great feel and carbonation with superb drinkability, but be forewarned, if hops aren't your thing, skip this baby... she's big, bold, and bitter... or as I like to say upon encountering such a brew, ""Just Right."""
"Great beer. Plenty lively and full of character. Highly drinkable without becoming boring."
"On-tap at none other than the KULMINATOR, Antwerpen. Straw gold body, lots of hop presence in the nose, grassy notes, pale malt, a true Belgian IPA. Good carbonation in the palate, hop character comes out here too, perhaps a bit too light given abv but great bitterness to round out the finish. Relentlessly easy drinking."
"Carbonation is predictably high. On one hand, that helps to really stick the flavor to the taste buds, but on the other hand it hurts the drinkability. A very burpy beer, but a pretty good one as well."
"Hats off to Het Anker. Seek out!"
"D: One of the best beers I've had in a while, definitely the best of August '08 so far, definitely this and Houblon Chouffe are 1 and 1a in this new style for me so far."
"Pretty good. I was a little put off by the taste after the super nice aroma."
"A little rough around the edges perhaps, I would think with the hops they used this would be more ""noble"" tasting, but it's a real citrusy beast. It's the most outright hoppy beer I think I've had from Belgium."
"Pours a cloudy, very light golden color with a massive brilliantly white head and plumes of carbonation jetting up. Aroma is distinctively Belgian with plenty of fruity esters combined with a floral and citrus hop background. Throughout all these Belgian IPAs I try, I have a hard time really distinguishing hop aromas from yeast notes; however they are very complimentary and pleasant. On the palate, things continue to open up as massive carbonation delivers waves of flavor starting with bright citrusy fruits followed by a really definitive hop flavor and an assertive bitterness (something really missing from all other BIPAs). There's certainly a nice malt breadiness to this beer as well really rounding it out well. It's extremely balanced, flavorful and well done, better than any other BIPA out there. Certainly one to seek out."
"750ml brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a murky golden-yellow body with a couple inches of off-white rocky head that slowly dissipates leaving some nice lacing. Smells hoppy - grassy and citrussy, spicy, hints of apple, pepper... Tastes citrussy, pithy, spicy, with some grassy hops. Fairly subdued and quite dry. Light bodied with ample carbonation, combined with lack of alcohol presence makes this one dangerously drinkable. Very tasty and very good. Probably the best Belgian IPA I've had."
"Just an excellent beer..."
"Overall, another damn fine beer from Het Anker. I find this quite a bit more interesting that the similar beer produced by Chouffe, although you've got to dig for the flavor and complexity here. As far as I'm concerned, this is world class, and well worth picking up for $9. Highly recommended."
"D - This is a magnificent blonde ale. Would love to taste on tap sometime."
"Pours cloudy gold with a thick creme head. Nose is dough and spices. Real smooth noticeable hops in there too. Nice even spicy tones with dough and a smooth sweet edge on the flavor profile. There's also a slight bitter edge. Feel is smooth. This is great to drink. An excellent Belgian IPA that should definitely be tried."
"Surprisingly refreshing, considering the alcohol content and the variety and intensity of the flavors. Yet the heat in the finish encourages moderation, and after this small bottle my palate is just a bit numb. The hop character seemed low for a Belgian IPA. I can think of several examples with higher bitterness or a more distinctive hop aroma. That said, it is still a flavorful brew with a fine mouthfeel."
"Another awesome beer from Het Anker!"
"A good Belgian, but I'd grab a Duvel first."
"nice one, Golden Charlie!"
"The taste had a strong taste of grapefruit, piney, with a slight sweetness and citrus. Slight peppery taste. Overall a rather smooth beer with a creamy taste. After awhile, the higher abv comes through. Filing. Very interesting and worth a check out."
"Conclusion: a rather unpretentious Strong Pale Ale. It has a lot in common with Duvel which can hardly be coincidental. Definitely not a bad brew though not quite as original & unique as most other offerings from this brewer. Give this a try if you come across it, but -with Duvel being so readily available everywhere- don't bother to go searching for it."
