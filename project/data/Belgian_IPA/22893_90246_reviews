"Had this on Nitro while in L.A.  Overall, the beer was extremely easy to drink.  It appeared a hazy, darker orange color that had a really nice, well retained, thick and dense white head.  Lighter aroma than expected, slight citrus hop.  The taste is about what you would expect from the style, malty with some citrus hop.  The beer had a really nice feel to it, extremely smooth and very easy to drink."
"Nice fruity notes of citrus. Hop balanced with light bodied base. Clean finish with mild hop bitterness."

"While this is a pretty nice beer, it fails to capture the true greatness that mark several (mostly Belgian-brewed) exemplars of the style.  Balance is largely missing from this one, as is the sweet essence of Belgian yeast which can sometimes distinguish the style from a typical American IPA.  Still, this brew is worth a try."
"Pretty good IPA. Resembles Hop Stoopid. Another favorite of mine. Smoother than some other IPA's. Doesn't have the bite of Ruination. However Ruination is my favorite by the way. I will definitely be getting this again...very soon."
"Good golden color, almost perfectly clear. OK head and really nice clingy lacing that hangs on for dear life. Aroma is piney with a good amount of pineapple and some orange. Malt sweetness and hops balance pretty well but this beer is a little more subdued than I would have expected. Just researched and realized that this beer has been in the bottle for 4 months. Still a good IPA, but I would guess that it has lost a little during its time in the bottle."

"Overall - very good representation of this style and very enjoyable on a hot day!"

"O - Contrary to it's name, Brainless IPA is quite thought-out indeed, showcasing Belgian yeast first and foremost making this American brew a Belgian-style beer first and an IPA second but the combination is a fantastic one! Fruity and spicy yeast esters meld wonderfully with the hops' juicy fruitiness for a match made in heaven!"

"This beats all 80 of the previous beers I have rated on this site. Almost perfectly balanced hops, yeast and Malts. A real pleasure and sad to know that it is not available year round. I found this bomber at Whole Foods in Seattle and hope I can find some more before Seattle runs out!"
"quite a pleasant surprise. The Belgium yeast doesn't overpower the fact that this is an ipa. Instead it balances nicely for a truly unique flavor. theres no mistaking the hops finish. This could make a great year round brew. Unfortunately the availability is sparse."

"Overall this is OK. Needs more depth."
"O- I don't sense the Belgian presence in this but, either way, it's a sweet yet earthy IPA that goes down pretty easily. My first beer from this brewery and I'm somewhat intrigued."
""
"O- I enjoyed this beer. I wish there were more Belgian characteristics, but just as an IPA, it is really good. I would have again."

"Yet another very good beer by epic. Great thick foamy head. Tight bubles that last, not the quarter inch type that fade away in 30 seconds. Held to the light, its not haxy, just dark gold in appearance. Aroma is good,, if a little mild. Mouthfeel is outstanding.. carbonation has good balance. The hop selection is interesting. Some pine finishing with a hint of citrus. Not overly bitter, a tad more than i would normally like but no complaints here. I think the slight aftertaste may be from the yeast. Not bad at all just different. The belgian characteristics are mild and most evident in the yeast flavors. Very good and will buy again. This is a beer to savor and enjoy, not one for nonchalant drinking nights. Would make an interesting pairing with a sharp cheese and possibly italian pasta - i can really see this complimenting the flavors of garlic and oregano. Not as good as their spiral jetty (imho) but a fine beer that deserves a good try."

"Overall: I would not have known this was a BIPA had the label not said so. This has been in the bottle for 100 days or so but it actually has held up quite well. I would have preferred a bit stronger in the Belgian department."
"Excited to try some other styles from Epic."

"A very tasty, very easy drinking Belgian IPA. Lots of flavor complexities all wrapped up in a nicely balanced body. Everything melds together just right."

"O Good. I liked this quite a bit. Theres definitely better tropical/citrusy IPAs, but there's, also, many that are not as good. I'd have it again."

"O: very enjoyable, a great session! it's complex without having to think about it. smooth with a ton of pine and earth! 88"
"like all epic beers from this series and beyond, the use of hops in this beer is expert. it pours a fantastic bright golden color with some darker orange hues and a massive fluff white head. the nose on it is distinctly Belgian yeast, floral and supercharged, complimenting the ripe citrus hop profile of this beer. the flavor is much like the nose, with the hop presence carrying throughout the whole beer, moving from lemony to bitter very quickly, and the summer yeast keeping everything dancing. the grain bill is light, but has a graham crackery honey sweetness to it that works well with the other players. the feel is outstanding too, with electric carbonation prickling the palate, and a drinkably medium body working. the finish is bitter and yeasty, as it should be in a Belgian ipa. this to me is another genre definer from epic, everything you want in the style and nothing you don't. it should be in a museum somewhere for that reason. too many lousy versions out there, this one struck a chord with me."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; release #3, bottled on 2/2/2013. Pours very hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pine, pear, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast spiciness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and yeast notes. Taste of lemon zest, grapefruit, orange zest, pear, floral, grass, pepper, pine, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pear, floral, pepper, pine, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors with spicy esters; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly sticky and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Belgian IPA. Good balance of hop and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"for the most part i think i have liked Epic's beers more than most.Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed burnt orange with a large fluffy white crown that left two broken rings of lace behind as it settled very slowly into a frothy mass.Aromas of overripe tropical fruits and light phenols,there is a little herbal and resinous note that get bigger as I drink more as well.Flavors of the before mentioned tropical fruits with some toasted grain and some mildly spicy phenols.Not an overly complex beer but the flavors are not bad."

"From the 22 oz bottle bought at Bottleworks in San Diego, where they have a nice selection of Epic beers."
"This is a really nice, fruity, citrusy, Belgian IPA. I was very impressed. It's got a great hop character and overall flavor as well as great drinkability. This is definitely a beer worth trying."
"Pours a murky honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with yeast and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but I don't think that a cask presentation is optimal for this beer."
"Medium bodied with a blast of dry, sticky hop bitterness that lingers over the sweeter notes, Belgian yeast and pale malts into a bone dry finish. Earthy, resinous and bitter with lots of dry hop flavor followed by subtle sweetness with some grapefruit and orange peel, however, the citrus/tropical fruit character isn't as strong as the nose suggests. The Belgian yeast flavors are stronger than they were in the aroma with hints of bread, apple, pear and bubblegum. Sweet malt backbone balances things out with some caramel and toffee sweetness along with bread, biscuit and graham cracker. Subtle heat in the finish but it doesn't affect the drinkability. Overall, this beer isnt anything out of the ordinary but is a pretty solid offering from Epic. The hop flavors are decent but are slightly one dimensional and overpower the Belgian yeast notes a but too much for me. Still, I enjoyed drinking this and got through the bomber pretty quickly."

"O/D - Easy drinking beer for the belgian IPA style. Really well done. A bit filling. Certainly hefty on its Belgian spiciness."

"Overall, really tasty. Well worth a try."
" aftertaste is slightly boozy. I would definitely buy this again. I suppose I was a little harsh."
