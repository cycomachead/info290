This one had head coming out of the bottle as soon as I popped the top. Aromas of bread, honey, yeast cake, esters, and some berry highlights. Smells are light, but tasty. Flavors are light and crisp, with a buttery, cracker, and floral blend on the forward tongue, with some more honey rich notes in the backbone. Smooth, light bodied, with a softness throughout. The aftertaste is more of the Belgian yeast strand, with fruity notes and funk. The finish is smooth and clean, with a subtle spice linger.","GarthDanielson","Feb 21, 2014"

The taste of the beer doesn't scream Belgian to me really, it's got a lot of american style hops in it that kind of kill off any of the Belgian flavors that it might have in there somewhere.

In the flavor, mainly grapefruit hops with some pith, zest and rind action with a substantial bitterness. For a "Belgian Style" IPA this misses the mark and is clearly in the American IPA style, with the belgo yeast only making itself known in its spiciness. Mouthfeel is good with a crisp carbonation and hop bite. Overall, a nice IPA style beer, but not enough Belgian influence to be true to style.","Stinkypuss","0"
3.89,3.2,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Despite using Belgian yeast, beyond some aspects of the flavor, this is a domestic style through and through. Still, Coronado knows what to do with hops - so this is worth seeking out.","augustgarage","Jun 07, 2011"
3.52,-6.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O - I could tell from the first smell that this bottle was probably toast, there's no way Coronado would brew a Belgian style IPA with this kind of tang because they're a talented bunch of folks which tells me it's the bottle. I'll definitely give this one another go around and adjust my review as such. I really like the beers from Coronado. However, if I weren't expecting more Belgian flare in the aroma and taste, and this were classified more as a big IPA, I might enjoy it more. The pungent acidity reminds me more of what I experienced with a Mikkeller "I Beat yoU", and that was done in a good way. This is too, but I don't think it's what the brewer was shooting for, if so, call it something else to eliminate the Belgian expectation because it's just not there. Like I said, I'll DEFINITELY give this one another try. The bottle is on the downside, and I still give solid a "B", only because I do like pungency and spice in my hops, just doesn't work with this style. Can't wait to try a fresh one!","jzeilinger","Jun 07, 2011"
4.5,19.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mad Mex featuring Hoppy Daze IPA on tap right now intense array of citrus hops brings out Beligan spices as well. The moderate carbonation and the smooth drinking body goes hand and hand, one of those beers that drain themselves than you find at that Mad Mex is charging nine bucks a glass for this masterpiece. An excellent product but so limited that Mad Mex is selling it for a set price of nine dollars a pour but it only charges 4.50 during happy hora M-F that's why they can get away with the inflated pricing. Even the Brown ale from Coronado was nine bucks fuck Wilson Mcginnley and Fuck Mad Mex for 9 dollar pints. This beer was excellent too bad I couldn't drink another serving without spending 18 dollars did I mention they want to serve this in 12 ounce pours. Citrus, floral, and earthy hops stand tall against the barrage of West Coast hops but the alcohol is well hidden and the malts are plentiful enough to create some balance. Drinkability overall is quality but the price leaves this one on the experimental backburner.","WVbeergeek","May 26, 2011"

4.2,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours hazy golden with a large white head. The initial aroma is very hoppy, with both grassy and citrusy orange hops.

4.12,9.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A 22 ounce bomber bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $6. Poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed bright yellow color with about two fingers of fluffy off white foam.

Pretty tasty overall.","ClockworkOrange","Nov 30, 2009"

3.7,-1.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Talk about day and night, I so enjoyed this from a bottle, but from tap the sweetness comes pounding through....too much so. The hops and yeast are nice, but the sweetness needs to be dialed down a bit. I left disappointed. Shame too.","Kadonny","Sep 25, 2009"
4.29,13.8,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Split a bottle at Tap and Table in Emmaus, PA. Poured into a tulip, the beer was a hazy yellow with a sticky white head. The aroma was a big nose full of of sweet piney resin with a mild earthy note. I'm really impressed by how clear and rich the smell is, damn. The flavor diverges surprisingly, with a much grassier, citrus rind flavor - likely the Belgian element kicking in. Like most really good beers, it could still be more complex, but this is a beer worth seeking out. Thanks to Plunkett for introducing me to this fine beer.","tempest","Sep 06, 2009"

4.3,14.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is just a down right enjoyable brew; it has such a ripe hoppiness to it that I can't really even find fault that the hops drown out the Belgian yeast character to a large degree. Letting the beer warm up certainly helps (the phenols in the finish become more noticeable and a herbal, slightly vegetal and grassy character is accentuated as well), but ultimately this is all about the hops (as it should be). This is dangerously drinkable for a beer of this of this strength, which is definitely requisite in my book for anything with IPA on the label. This definitely hits the spot for this oft-times hop head, and even has a bit of yeast character to keep the funky freak in me at least slightly interested.","Gueuzedude","Dec 30, 2008"

Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with grassy hops, citrus and light malt flavors. Slight spice and yeast are present as well. The finish is hoppy and leaves a mild spice and hops aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Dogbrick","0"
3.82,1.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This is a decent and very drinkable Belgian IPA, though I really think it would be better fresh as the hops have faded a bit. As it is, this is a light and fruity sweet take on a Belgian IPA.","gford217","Aug 07, 2008"
3.7,-1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Bottle, 4/08. Pours clear gold with a huge white head. Strong yeasty aroma with a lot of banana and clove. It nearly drowns out the floral hops. Taste is the same. Bubblegum and clove abound, then the grassy, pine hops come in at the end. The closest thing to this is the Urthel Triple Hop IPA. This one is sweeter, but I don't know which is better.","magictrokini","Jul 05, 2008"

Nevertheless, I didn't expect Hoppy Daze to blow me out of the water like it has. This unique, delightful elixir deserves a lot more love than it gets.

3.65,-3.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Odd actually. A little off balance. Hoppy and bitter on the finish with a biscuit bready middle leaning into caramel on the finish. Hints of citrus and peach with even more in the way of pine and bits of earth. Middle seems to be somewhat lost for just a second and than it all comes back full throttle on the finish. Ahh well after reading the bottle I see that this brew is femented with a belgian yeast strain. That would explain the lack of a middle. A good DIPA but just can't get past the middle.","mcallister","May 08, 2008"

3.37,-10.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,"On tap at the CBC. Pours a red, slightly hazy color with a nice thick head. The head leaves a huge lacing as it drains. Aroma is completely hops - with lots of sticky pine smells. Huge amounts of bitterness, and a very hoppy finish. This one could have used more of a malt base to back up the hops - I love big hoppy beers, but this suffered on drinkability without the malt base.","rowew","Mar 06, 2004"
3.67,-2.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy amber colour with a thin lace of white head. Good retention for the meager amount of foam off the pour. Light malty flavour sits underneath a combination of citrus and resinous hops. Highly resinous bitterness with a citrusy hop flavour. Light sweetness most of the way through, finishing on the dry, resinous side. Medium body and carbonation. Dry, resinous texture. Overall, the hops really overpower the malt base, but it's still a nice beer.","DrJay","Nov 05, 2003"
4,6.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Reminds me of the Hopmaniac IPA at OnTap in La Jolla. Certainly not as bitter or powerful or in-your-fave as Stone ales. I swear that it was listed as a Double IPA on the board above the bar. It fits the regular IPA category pretty well. Very well done IPA.","oggg","Beers"
3.85,2.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A lighter amber-colored offering than the Four Brothers Pale Ale, this brew provided much more of a hop experience. The body, as noted, was light amber and clear with a decent white head and good lacing. Very malty and hoppy nose with more presence than the pale ale. Decent flavor with nicely subdued hop presence yet clearly a well-hopped offering, but refined and restrained. Good feel and finish. Easily a session beer.","AtLagerHeads","0"
