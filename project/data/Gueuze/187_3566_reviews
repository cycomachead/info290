"O - if you like the sourness of this beer style, this beer is one of the best.  Not overpowering in sourness, the slight sweetness in the flavour makes the difference."

"O: This is a decent gueuze. It's nothing to write songs about, but it does the job quite well."
""
"O - An OK gueuze, but for me it has two main faults: way too sweet and way too one dimensional. Would get the Cuvée instead of this every time."

"This is a tasty and extremely light beer. While I don't like it as much as the fruit lambics (specifically the Kriek), it gives you a great, easy-going Brett experience. I'd definitely drink it again, although I'd prefer to lean toward the fruit lambics."
"Overall, a pretty good find here. Doesn't have the strong sour characters of some of the Belgians that I've had, but then again that's ok - a subdued and refreshing find. Nothing but good things to say."

"M&D: loose on the carbonation on the verge of being flat, medium bodied but really it feels like the added candy sugar dominates the balance, this is not a good example of blended lambic in my honest opinion, having tried myself a dozen or so much better oude geuze where no added sugar is applied. In this case, it feels like the sugary elements have “split” the beer down the middle: clear-cut sweetness vis-à-vis weak funky fruitiness. Personally, I would never want to revisit this beer, unless the brewery reverted to the oude geuze style by abandoning the overpowering candy sugar which really has killed off many more pleasant flavours one would expect from a glass of classic tart funky malt juice…"

"What I liked less was the appearance. It is not that special. A minimal white head."
""
"Overall: I really have no idea what Lindeman’s is trying to do with this beer, but it is the sorriest excuse for a lambic that I have ever encountered! I will certainly never ever buy it again!"
""
""
""
"Its not bad, but not amazing. It seems to be a good entry to the style but not anywhere near the grand daddy of cantillon."

"O: Good drinkability. A very easy Gueuze. Much more sweet and less tarty than the classic Gueuzes but still a pleasant Belgian beer"
""
""

"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with minimal to no wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is moderate, so this foams slightly on the palate, leading to a fairly smooth mouthfeel. Closes out dry, slightly astringent, and with only the slightest hit of sweetness around the edges of the mouth."

"The beer is amber/orange in color with a short lived white head. Not a very good nose to this. Quite a bit of grass and maybe even some butter. There’s some light lemon notes in the background. The flavor is a bit better. It’s got a decent tartness to it, but it’s somewhat vinegary. A little apple and grass in there, too. Medium bodied with somewhat low carbonation. This one really was a let down; Cuvee Rene is much better."
""
"O: Okay beer, but nothing special here. Off taste for the style and just plain (not too much going on). I would not seek this out again as there are plenty of other gueuzes that I enjoy more."

"O- Something in the middle between a gueuze and a flanders red ale, age has probably a role in this. Very drinkable and quite refreshing, but not as complex as other spontaneous fermentation beers i have tried"
"An easily accessible geuze, a beginners choice - but not bad as a refreshment."
"This 25 cl bottle revealed a dark amber colored brew with a wispy head of foam. The aroma is a mixture of fruity sourness and some sugary notes. The flavor is sour and tart, although tartness more than sourness defines the profile. The fruitiness borders on sugary and is a deficit in this brew. It is not as cracklingly crisp as some other gueuze I have had, but it still snaps on the way, a little like champagne."
"Overall a very pleasant drop. Sourness keeps your palate honest but does not overpower. Down a bit on drinkability due to hign tap price @ Taphouse."
"even though I love bitter brews (the old Pilsner Urquell or Jever) paired with sourness is too much for my taste ...."
"Glad to try this beer although I did'nt find it to be quite a traditional tasting Gueuze. More of a hybrid between a Flanders ale, a Gueuze and a sweet Belgian amber ale."
"Beer is thin and dry with a mild sweetness, mostly there is a lactic acid sourness but even that is a little weak. It tastes a little cidery, but it's not as sweet as I feared it would be. Overall probably not a repeat, there are much much much better gueuzes out there but it wasn't a regret."
"Good Gueuze offering but if your after a style defining example, perhaps look elsewhere."
"Drinkability: After a few sips, the sweetness really starts to get to me; in and of itself, the beer is not bad, it is just the accumulated effect of the sweetness that causes the problem"
"D - One of the lighter Gueuzes you'll find and worth a try as an intro to Lambics."
"Overall: unique and pleasant."
"Maybe a bit expensive and hard to get for me, because I had to drive all the way over to France to get myself a good selection of Belgian beers, but well worth it."
"D: well I found this Geueze to be a little too sweet in comparison to others. It is a well crafted beer but falls short of excellence."
"Hazy deep gold body, minimal visible carbonation, almost non-existent head, just a thin ring around edge of glass. Nose is pretty fruity, a bit of peach and some meyer lemon, little if any hop odors. The taste is sour, not much else going on other than some oak character, lacking in any sweetness, quite a bit of saltiness in the finish. Pretty good effervescent mouthfeel. Even as I develop my palate for lambics, not sure I could finish an entire bottle of this, though certainly worth a try for sour/lambic fans."
"Tastes very nice! Heavy tartness and some serious lack of sugar, which makes this beer pretty cool. Nothing that is like a normal Belgian but more than that."
"A decent balance between sweet and sour, and my tooth enamel stays fully intact..."
"M/D - Light and crisp. Very lively carbonation. A little too sweet for my liking but still a passable beer."
"This was my first lambic and I liked it. I'll have to chase down some more."
"Pours orange with a white head. The aroma is tart citurs and not as much funk as I was expecting. The flavor is tartness with a good bit of sweetness to balance things out. Good citrus notes and not much funk. Not a very sour gueuze. Thin mouthfeel and high carbonation. Not bad, but not as good as Cuvee Rene."
"A totally unbeer like beer. Really sweet and sour with no distinguishable malt or yeast characteristics. Now only if this could replace soft drinks and fruit juices in my life I'd be set. Really a refreshing and enjoyable beer and at 4% you could have it and not feel too bad."
"Overall- Slight tartness and smooth. Easy drinking dessert beer."
"D - quite unique for the style, to me the more sour the better and this just falls a bit short. enjoyable sipper."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Light bodied, low carbonation but easy to drink. A little bit dry at the end. My wife does love it."
"Overall I found this to be a pretty good and easy drinking ale. It may not be my first choice, but I would reach for it again."
"Pours a murky golden color with plenty of yeast flakes floating about. Tight off white head that settles into a solid ring. The aroma is sweet and fruity with a lemon tartness. The taste is of sugary white grape juice, granny smith apples, light honey and some subtle spices. The feel is light to moderate, tingly carbonation, and sweet overall. Not as sweet and fruity as their fruit lambics but still rather sweet. The nice feel makes this quite drinkable."
"Flavor was slightly tart and a fellow taster compared it to Apple Strudel for diabetics. There's some sweetness there, but it in an artifical Nutrasweet kinda way. Aroma is of green apples and light notes of ginger spice. The sourness is moderate and would seemingly pair well with a hot summer day. But, in absence of this setting, I would put my money down on something else."
"A very gentle gueuze, good for those who are new to the style. Agree with those who say it is more of a faro."
"Overall, not very good Geuze, but one of Lindemans better beers. Could be suitable for those trying Geuze for the first time as it is very mild."
"Poored into a standard pint glass with a huge flat head down to nothing but a cap within no time wonderfull light amber/yellow color smells of apples green apples maybe just a little grain taste once again green apples slightly sour but not bad not quite like a cider but almost feel about what is to be expected given the flavors and smell would drink it again it is easy drinking"
"I think this would be great to introduce someone to the style, since it's nice, yet not too extreme."
"Pours a deep amber, no head, light spotted lacing. Aroma is weak, hints of oak and faint acid. Initially syrupy sweet; mollasses, brown sugar, candy apples, maple syrup. Suggestions of oak tied together with classic gueze acidity. Rather tame on the funky notes and unfortunately sweet; covering up the tang. Lindemans seems to produce these exotic treats for the masses, taming the wild characteristics. These ales shouldn't be so user friendly."
"Pours a golden amber body in color, with red banding, no head, white. Has an aroma of slight alcohol, grapes, tart, but it's weak. Has a weak taste, watery palate with some raisins, fizziness, some alcohol, dry, a lot like champagne. Has a musky aftertaste."
"Notes: This beer really stands on its own I believe and may very well be a gateway beer to Gueuzes."
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Overall: This beer is very dry and has a bit of a sour note. The mouthfeel is astringent and the finish. iThe finish is very sour, bitter and very very dry."
"The drinkability is low here because I can't take so much of the sweet."
"Disappointing. Lively mouthfeel, though."
"Keeping in mind the fact that my knowledge of the gueuze style could fit on the head of a pin with room to spare, I'm pretty sure that Lindemans Gueuze Lambic is well outside the realm of acceptable, given the addition of so much sugar. That, in combination with the fact that it's a pretty decent little sipper, makes it incredibly hard to score."
"My first Gueuze. I don't know what to make of it. This is something I enjoy, but don't know how to rate quite yet. I have some Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René that I am going to try next so I can compare. A complex style, and I want to revisit this beer."
"D. I am a little bit let down with this one. I wanted a sour beer and this one is not it. Too sweet, but smells nice and very complex."
"375ml bottle, nice red-orange color. It doesn't smell as funky as the cuvee rene but still has a vinegar-like and a hint of a musty basement, oldness. Apple-cider vinegar flavor but also sweet and syrupy. Oddly, this still isn't really sour and the syrup-like aspect is a detractor. The cuvee rene is much, much better."
"D - Like most beers in this style this isn't someything I'd drink on a regular basis but this would be a good introduction to the style. It's got the characteristics that you'd expect but not too overpowering like some others."
"easily my favorite offering from these guys. i'd like to try some more like this that are rated higher than this one."
"In the end I can't get past the candied apple character, it drowns out everything else and is overly sweet. This doesn't taste horrible, it doesn't have serious flavor flaws, it just is overly simplistic in its sweetness and not very good. This just isn't my cup of tea."
"My only previous experience with Lindemans is the fruit flavored lambis they brew, so this one is a bit different. It pours a clear light copper with a thin but lingering head. The aroma is fruity, maybe slightly cidery and sweet. The flavor is sweet upfront, with a kind of fruity quality. The fruitiness leads into nice tart and slightly sour flavors. There is a nice earthy funky flavor which combined with the tartness, lingers in my mouth. I am not too familiar with the style, but it is certainly an interesting beer, and not bad overall."
"From a 12 oz bottle. Dark Golden apple juice appearance. Head lasted briefly, but the beautiful carbonation keeps rising. Woody, sweet smell. Very light apple taste with a little tart aftertaste. Nice feel and very easy to drink. Not something for me to buy repeatedly, but nice to drink nonetheless."
"D: A solid example by style, nothing fancy, just a well brewed beer that was refreshing leaving you wanting more."
"Rather sweet and one-dimensional for a standard gueuze. Actually pretty drinkable aside from the cork taint, but, as with many Lindeman's beers, this is rather one-dimensional and sweet for its style."
"I am reviewing a bottle of the Lindemans Gueuze Foudroyante. The beer poured a clear golden color with a medium thickness head that runs away quickly and gives way to a little ring on the edge. Slight tart aroma, a bit funky but not too much. The taste is somewhat tart but a bit sweet as well. Sweeter that you usually get in a gueuze but drinkable and approachable for those not used to the style."
"D- Not a favorite. My girlfriend liked it, but maybe because she loves Riesling wine."
"Pours a virtually clear golden brown with a light tan head. Nose is an expected musty yeast with a sweet tone blanketing it. Flavor is sweeter than I expected with slight apple qualities as well. The sweet barely leans towards a tart edge...barely. Feel is decent. Nice carbonation. Drinkable, sure. I wont be pouring it down the drain, but for gueuze, Ill be going elsewhere in the future. Even with my limited experience on the style, I can tell that this one is not as ""mature"" or full in character as others are and can be."
"The experience makes me wish I was drinking Cuvee Rene, as this was dull and underwhelming like plain yogurt. This ""regular"" Lindemans Gueuze is not so easy to find in Chicago, but not really worth drinking again, at $6/12 oz. bottle. Give me the Cantillon I crave for a dollar more."
"Drinkability : une version de gueuze correcte mais sans plus"
"I have a feeling this has been produced for the mass market and is a not a Gueuze in the true sence of the style, drinkable without a doubt, but a long way from the sour, bitter old style Gueuze I like to think I can remember."
"Pours a relatively clear dark golden with just a slight head and no lacing to speak of. The nose is slightly sour with notes of grape must, lemon, and tangerine. A slight hit of sweetness on the end. Really quite sweet- much more so than the nose would suggest, approaching Faro territory. Sweet sour interplay, rather simple, with candi sugar, lemon and tangerine. Just the barest hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly slick. Just okay, too sweet for the style and lacks complexity."
"Drinkability would be higher if it weren't quite so sweet, this bottle went down quickly, but for the price I want something with this level of sophistication in the palate but without such a glaring weakness. That said, I'd love to have this around more often."
"Overall, I was sort of dissapointed in this, because I was hoping that it was not sweetened. It's not really my cup of tea... or Beer."
"D - This is scary. I could live on this stuff! I think that it would go well with anything from salads, chicken, steak, chocolate....this is one of the better food beers out there. I could down bottle after bottle of this stuff, but I'd be broke at these prices (I paid $4.99 for a 355ml bottle). If only I were a rich man...Sadly, price is a factor and the cost of this stuff will prevent me from buying it very often but I won't detract from the score just because I'm po'. Actually, this is so drinkable that I wish it had some characteristic that made me want to drink more slowly because at five bucks for this little bottle, I'm paying a dollar a minute at this rate."
"Overall: Like I said I like the beer, too bad its not a traditional gueuze. If you want gueuze go elsewhere. If you want a nice sweet treat with a touch of funk give this one a try."
"Easy-drinking gueuze, and an excellent intro into the style - definitely on the sweeter side of the style. That said, it goes down swimmingly, as does the other examples of the style I've tried. Hell, I'm tempted to never drink a white wine again. I wish more examples of gueuze were widely available over here!"
""
"At the end, we agreed that there was little point in serving wine when this is available. I didn't find the ""funky"" flavors that I was expecting from a lambic, so I am curious what I'll think once trying others."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye: Poured a cloudy dark beige color lambic with a bunch of particle floating around and a medium foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of oak is more prominent then expected with some light tart note also noticeable. The barnyard factor is lighter then in the Cuvée René and is sorely miss. Taste is sweeter then I would have expected from a gueuze but it still provides a good deal of refreshment. Body is above average with low filtration and good carbonation. While being far from the real thing, this gueuze is still enjoyable on a hot summer day if maybe a tad too sweet."
"Dark amber colour, reminds me of some sherry generous oaked wines. Nice shades when you hold it to the light. Good head with a silky lace. Aroma is pungent and sour, barnyard, ripe fruits. something in it reminds of a blue cheese. Very complex, some fruits on it too, and champagne like. Tart flavor, mouth is dry and sour, some fruits, roasted almonds or hazelnuts, some barnyard too."
"12 oz. green champagne bottle. It pours into my flute glass orangey/bronze, with light carbonation and a thin, whitish head that leaves light lacing. Quite aromatic, with mouth-watering tart and acidic notes, along with tangy wheat and a light musty character. On the palate, it is tart and lightly sweet, with a crisp fruitiness (melon/apple?/grape?) a lemony bite, mild cork and oak, a dash of hops, salt?, and some wild/funky notes. The body is medium with light carbonation, smooth yet dry, and it has a sweet, lingering finish. Overall a quite drinkable, but mild gueuze - one packed with flavor, but it's not quite tart or wild enough to fully stimulate my senses."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a bright, somewhat murky copper amber, a light white head recedes to a thin, sparse film, delicate lacing in streaks. The aroma is tart, sweet, and sour, but a bit sparse. Maybe interesting, but it doesn't come out much. The taste is much more expressive, lots of tart fruits, drying from the start for the mouth, some obvious Belgian yeastiness, lots of carbonation all adding to this effect of lambic-y goodness. I personally haven't had that many sour Belgians, but I'm definitely exploring it now, and am finding (surprisingly) that I like em, and this one isn't an exception, a pretty good beer."
"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into the most suitable glass I could find (a Hennepin glass). Appearance is good, not great, but good. I like the ruby-tinted honey color, and the head was a good two fingers at first, receding to a nice sheet. No lacing. The smell is decent, with a good bit of wheat, some candi sugar and that classic wild tartness. The taste is not quite what I had hoped for. It has a bit of the real lambic 'bite' to it, but not enough for my taste, and it is further negated by an overbearing sweetness of apples and orange juice. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, and again a bit overly cloying with the sweets. It is pretty drinkable, aside from the (guess what) sweet. Overall good, not great."
"Drinkability: my first gueuze, i liked it and will search out others."
"Not bad at all. I'm not overly familiar with the style, but this was pretty good. I haven't had any of the more traditional gueuzes, so I don't know how this one stacks up. The flavor reminded me a lot of Duchesse de Bourgogne. I'd recommend it to fans of that beer and as a decent intro to sour beers."
"Mouthfeel was sparkling and medium/full bodied."
"Drinkability: This is a very appealing geuze (it doesn't smell like farts like others i've tried). I'd try this on tap, and imagine it's much better aged even."
"drinkability: great overall balance making it pretty drinkable."
"Feels light and drinks OK."
"While I enjoy Lindemans' flavoured lambics, most of them seem little more to me than flavoured soda for adults. Because of this, I was unsure of how ""true to the style"" their gueuze would be. I was delightfully surprised with it. Its colour was a bit darker than I was expecting, pouring and orange copper with a very slight haze to it. The head was slightly off-white and loosely knit. It faded away rather quickly leaving behind a ring of lace around the edges and an abstract patch work of frost over the surface. CO2 streamed quickly upward, and for quite some time, actually. Smell seemed very typical for the most part, with special attention paid to the ""sour"" element that always seems to be present. Taste, too, seemed particularly sour, and delightfully sweet. Not bad. I'm sure there are much better examples of this style out there, but this is decent. Thanks to Ding for bringing me this."
"Drinkability: I was a bit nervous, as this is the first gueuze I've had. Much more drinkable than the other lambics I've had. I'll have to explore this style in more depth when the opportunity arises... I'm sure there are better ones out there, but this served as a good introduction for me and left me with a favorable impression of the style."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear golden honey color with a creamy head that quickly diminishes to a ring. The smell is a combination of citrusy fruit combined with an earthy, hay aroma. The taste is a pleasant balance of sour/acidic (green apple) and mildly sweet (honey). The Lindeman's Gueuze is light bodied but the carbonation is a little low for this style, giving it a slightly thicker mouthfeel. The finish is dry with an enjoyable tartness that lingers between sips. Overall a good beer that is very drinkable, but not one you're going to have a lot of in one sitting. I think it would go well with a light shellfish meal."
"Been wanting to try this style. Bought at a Whole Foods Store. Light Amber in Color not wat i was expecting. Light head. Smells like most Lambics I have ever had. Begins light and sweet, finishs with a heavier grapefruit like sourness. Very light carbonation. Very easy to drink."
"Not as funky as I expected, but very sweet and tart. Very nice funky smell. It was worth the 5 bucks I paid for it."
"Drinkability is pretty low. I can't think of a food I'd want to pair this with except maybe ice cream. If I wanted a soda, I'd drink one. If I wanted an alcopop (which this tastes quite a bit like) I'd have my head examined. If I want a lambic, I'd buy something else."
"Pours a brilliant coppered amber with a wonderful white lacing and thin head that clings to the glass. Aroma wreaks strongly of brie cheese and mildly of battery acid and candied sugar. Not nearly as funky as most Geuze. Taste is very sweet and faro like, almost like I would imagine a lemon faro would be. Candied sugar and citrus are dominant. Funk is so mild. Very tasty and nice but not terribly gauze like. Not funky and nasty enough for me. Mouthfeel is creamy and sweet rather than dirty and sour. Back of the palate gets hit with carbonation and some pleasant sourness. Overall, very enjoyable but not too exciting nor authentic. Also, too costly."
"Now on to the beer. As with many Belgian beers, I'm torn when I get to the ""Drinkability"" part. I would absolutely not drink a ton of these, despite the low abv%. But it's crisp, pleasant, very complex, well-made, and relatively easy to find. I'd get it again for sure."
"The flavors are much more friendly to the palate than some of the harsher, more sour gueuzes I've tried. There's an excellent balance of sweetness and sourness, with just a touch of that sweaty yeastiness that helps define the style. Nothing overly acidic, but nothing overly saccharine either. Along with a wonderfully creamy mouthfeel, I would most definitely pick this up again. I did rank it a bit low on the drinkability meter, as I find these hard to drink any more frequently than every now and then, no matter how good the flavor (and this particular offering delivers well on that front)."
"Drinkability: The maltiness balances well with the acidic bite, and the low abv makes it a refreshing hot-day brew."
"Not as strong as other beers in the style, making it a good introduction for someone new to the style."
"Pours a dark amber with worm high lights just beneath the head, which slowly dissipates. I was expecting Champagne like effervescence, which this does not produce. The smell is pleasant, slight sent of grapes, like fermented cider, citrus and apple skins. The sent also has a minor metallic note, however this is not over powering or displeasing. The taste seems more tame than other lambics I've had. The others I've had seem more vinegary, or kombucha like, which I am told is desirable. Maybe my taste is just under developed, but this is more my speed at this time. I've also been told that this lambic is made particulary to be sold to wider commercial market. All and all this is a pleasant beer light and pleasing. I would buy this again."
"Very warm and smooth mouthfeel. Somewhat creamy, yet very sharp at the same time. High carbonation and easily drinkable. I think I'm the newest convert to lambics. Would definitely recommend this to any beer drinker. It's different, but good."
"This ones a good sipper, but nothing too amazing."
"Body is rather light and thin, with a bubbly, prickly texture and slick, wet mouthfeel."
"Bottle corked and capped, foil wrapped. Pours a clean copper orange color with very little, if any, yeast particles visible. Big white head that lasts ... fine lacing in the goblet I've poured into. Nose is complex and strange, but in a good way. Definitely a musty (read: old damp room) smell, that actually works for this style. Sweet as well ... bittersweet fruits and straw. Palate is sweet and sour, but maybe the sweet wins out here. Slight Vinegar-like character which causes the mouth to water ... something I actually love in a Lambic. Fruity and quite smooth through the vinegar acidity. Warms to a smoother malt backbone. Finishes quite dry and lively with aggressive carbonation levels. Not being an expert in the Gueuze style, I can't say how it stacks up to it's competition, but I do know I like this on it's own merits. Best Lindeman's product I've had, by far. Makes me want more and that's got to be a good thing. If you're not familiar with a Gueuze, this is probably a good, safe place to start the journey."
"The flavor is very clean for a lambic as there is very little lactic sourness but it is still very complex. It begins with a sharp sour bite that segues into an applelike flavor and then a light sweetness blends into the barnyard flavor and the beer finishes clean with a touch of the green apple flavor. The finish is very sharp and lends a clean finish. This is a very mild lambic but it is still a good lambic as it allows an approchable introduction to the style."
"Drinkability/notes: A fine example of the style, certainly not to be missed.."
"Always looking to try classic Belgian beer styles. This Gueuze is very drinkable and characterful, when compared to others. The beer shows a firmer malt base that is not entirely soured. This gives a bit of sweetness that balances out the sourness. Leaves the beer less sour and astringent than most. The faint malt flavor do, however, begin to take on cola-like flavors that I did not particularly like. But the sweetness from that, makes the beer much more drinkable than expected, and giving the beer a more caramelized color. The beer remains vineous, musky, woodsy, and lightly pungent well into the finish with cleanliness and crispness. Well worth the try."
"I don't have a lot of experience with gueuze as a style, so it's hard to compare, but I'm guessing there are a lot better ones than this."
"Right before I tried Lindeman's, I had an Oud Gueze Beersel and thought it would take me some time before I can adapt to this style. However, this one just was a lot milder in all aspects, especially the sourness factor. Much easier to drink than the former, it still has the tart, hopless taste. Paired okay with some different cheese."
"The color is a hazy golden orage with moderatw carbonation. Head is ultra white and on the small side. Aroma is sweet with a tart berry-fruit smell. Sip starts with a tart combination of citris and berry flavors. Yeast flavors provide an interesting edge of flavor. A lightly sweet malt base is nice and becomes grainier in the finish. A touch of wheat is also noted. Drinkability is very high."
"A nice though somewhat sticky sweetness. Sour and sweet. Attractive soapy bubblehead and good lace on an orange body. Fruit and malt aroma. Easy mouthfeel and drinkability from maltiness more than acidity. Medium mouthfeel. Sampled at Cole's Belgian fest."
"Mouthfeel is light, mild and clean, only slightly puckering. This isn't the palate-raper like the more authentic lambics I like, but it gets the job done. A little too user friendly, but will do in a pinch."
"Pours a clear orange color, making this look exactly like a liquid orange sucker. Minimal, spotty lacing, and a thin, frothy head. Some floaties to deal with. Smells musty and sweet with a background of wheat. Smells a bit ""malty"" for a geuze. Has a cidery sweetness without much funk character. Tastes as if this was a geuze mixed with some other beer. Mouthfeel is light, and smooth but a bit syrupy sweet. I could definately see this being a refreshing beer in warmer months, but there's no way in hell I'd buy this again, honestly. The quality does not match up with the price tag. Ounce per dollar, the Cuvee Renee is a way better beer and way better deal."
"poured a nice deep orangey gold color with a nice creamy white head. the head decreases to almost a thin film. very fruity aroma, slightly yeasty; and it almost smells sour sort of like a semi-sweet wine. very sweet and tart, the taste actually reminds me more of a sparkling wine than a beer."
"375 ml capped and corked bottle, as Gueuze Foudroyante, bought in France. ABV is 4.0%. Hazy dark amber colour, large to moderate off-white head. Sweet and sourish aroma, reminiscent of some cheap white wines, hints of oak, cider apples, rotting berries and barnyard too. Flavour is very sweet, sweeter than any other gueuze Ive had (not that Ive had very many), strong notes of rotting fruits and berries, sourish but not astringent. Short sourish-sweet aftertaste. Worth a try, but wont buy again."
"Medium carbonation, lacking the overcarbonation I've come to expect from belgian beers. For the masses, but still pretty good."
"D - Delicious. Great drinkability. Awesome!"
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable, balanced and easy on the palate. You dont have to reach for this one, it comes to you. A good introduction to the more hard core lambic beers."
"Overall a very drinkable beer I enjoyed."
"Doesn't begin to compare with unsweetened, traditional lambics, but it's tasty in its way."
"This was the first Gueuze Lambic that I have ever tasted. This beer poured a golden color with little to no head, it was very carbonated. the aroma was sweet and slightly sour. I found the flavor to be bizar and complex, it was very sour and sweet with the flavor of apples and possibly pears, it also slightly bitter. The finish was rather musty or earthy, and I found this rather unpleasant. it was a facinating beer to try but the sourness and the unpleasant aftertaste lowered its drinkability in my opinion."
"Poured this 12 oz corked bottle into a Lindemans Flute. It is a clear deep straw color with a heavy lasting 1 to 1 ½ inch head with nice lacing. The smell is a tart and smells like medicine. It has a very sharp, light, clean, and fizzy mouthfeel. The flavor is sweet and sour but very smooth; tasting like honey, wood (oak/hickory), and citrus. A good beer draws fruit flies and this was no exception (Had several unfortunate casualties). I am very skeptical in my early stages of trying Lambics and this one surprised me. It is quite a good beer. It has a nice blend of sweet and tart due to its mixture (Gueuze)."
"Flavor is decent. Apple dominates everywhere. Some lemon. Overall it is good, but there are better gueuze styles out there."
"."
"Opinion: This is no Cuvee Renee! This Gueuze would be one for someone just exploring the world of sour beers. It isnt bad tasting, but it is very mild and reserved compared to most beers in this style. There is a tad of tartness, and a bit of the earthy flavor/aroma, but it remains pretty much balanced the entire time. If you dont know what a Gueuze istry this one before shelling out $20+ for a bottle of Cantillon. If you already like Gueuze, I would buy something elselike a Girardin, or an Oud Beersel or some such. This is like a pretend Gueuze."
"The aroma was of apples more than anything, followed by wheat and sour fruits. The flavor was the same; mostly a tart cider with yeast and sweet/sour hints. It had a lot of carbonation to start but as the glass warmed and the flavors became more intense, the carbonation died down. I feel that the sweetness became slightly sourer towards the end, but it still finished crisp and refreshing. Definitely a must try for lambic fans everywhere."
"peachy smell, almost like the Peche, but a little more understated. very sour, but only a 7 or so on the sour scale when I think about a Flemish. peachy and yeasty and dry. very appetizing. there's a nice spritz in the middle of the medium body. drinkability is pretty high. wow this is enjoyable."
"Clear deep gold with a solid ring of bubbles and plenty of carbonation, the light was hitting it just right. Nose had an ever so slight funkiness, I thought maybe the beer was too cold. This beer is simply too sweet and too fruity. There is no tartness or barnyard to balance it. This is a gueuze that my spouse would enjoy, which, I believe, eliminates it from being a part of the lambic family. The Lindemans' brews are like Belgian version malternatives. Of course, this is drinkable. There is nothing remotely threatening about this beer but the fear of the novice mispronouncing the name. This should be a complex melding of flavors, not an excellent choice to accompany your cake and ice cream."
"All in all, this is what I would consider a beginner lambic, probably doctored to make it suitable for more palates."
"Taste is where it goes downhill. Sweet, really sweet and fruity. Sour apples. Compared to the complex aroma the taste is too basic and overly sweet. Mouth is crisp up front but becomes sticky sweet, just overwhelming. Very tough to get through this one, just overly sweetened."
"Asiago does not go well, overpowers the subtle flavors of the beer. The other two work, help cut the sourness a bit."
"A lightly sour bite starts things off with the sweeter peachy flavors following close behind. Not very tart at all with a slightly saccharine aftertaste and a very light body. The carbonation makes it feel all the more ethereal. I wish it were more tart."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty good beer. I don't know how much funk I should be expecting from the style. I expected a lot, but didn't receive anything I thought was particularly funky. My first outing with some flemish reds was a much bigger shock. This is very approachable and I recommend it as a starter (from one newcomer of the style to another)."
"Overall, better than I expected but not as good as their Gueuze Cuvee Rene. I like this style to be a bit more on the sour and funky side vice the fruity/sweet. Nevertheless, a decent version of the style."
"A copper colored lambic with a mild amount of carbonation. This beer smells like your typical funky lambic (yeast, wet hay, cork, etc.), but in a very mellow way. It tastes fruity and sour, with notes of lemon, apple, peach, but all of these flavors are quite subdued. I prefer lambics with a bit more of an assertive sourness. However, this one is still pretty good."
"Has a clean amber color with a BIG beige head and a nice lace effect. The aroma is very fruity (almost apple) and sour, but in a mouthwatering way. The floavor is a light fruity sweetness with hints of apples and cherries. The finish is sour and dry yet not ""suck your cheeks in"" sour. Refreshing."
"small bottle, caped and corked. Pours a dull orangy amber, white head, quickly morphs to a thin film and leaves just a tad of lacing. Nose is very crisp, sour and fruity. this is a sour style of beer, not for the faint of heart and not for all beer lovers. Its an acquired taste and these beers tend to grow on you as you try them more. This one is fruity, refreshing,complex and moderatly sour from start to finish. Went well with a waldorf salad, and would be right for all sorts of lighter fare. salads, dessert, fish etc."
"Pours a nice fizzy red. The smell is wonderful and full of apples and bananas. The taste is very sharp, crisp and clean, and again full of apples. Strong flavored, much like how a good wine should taste. The mouthfeel is a little too thin, but the drinkability is through the roof."
"Pours a nice hazy golden color with good carbonation and a nice white head. I can smell a skunky hop aroma before I near the brew..upon closer sniffing a nice efferevesensce hits my my nose full of apple type acidic fruityness. Taste is definitely heavy on the apples up front, then dries into a nice sour fruity taste, only to finish with a cardboard type aftertaste that really detracts. Excellent dry mouthfeel with good carbonation make this quite a drinkable brew. I fear my tummy will fight back against this acidic brew though, so drinkability is decreased...a nice change up"
"From a capped and corked 12 ounce bottle, it pours a slightly hazy gold with a persistent white head that seems to remain at 1/4 inch no matter how long it sits. The smell is on the tart side but with some sweetness in the background. Unfortunately, the taste is surprisingly sweet and seemingly artificially so. It almost seems like a high-class and tart malt beverage. The mouthfeel is on the thick side. It's a bit disappointing."
"Beer is good. Happy goooze beering."
"The taste was very tart, yet slightly sweet, with a bit of cherry fruitiness evident. Overall a pretty good beer, and one that I could drink several of if it were less expensive."
"Pours a dark golden, semi-cloudy color with a huge head that slowly collapses. Aroma has some sweetness floating around a much stronger sour/tart sharpness. Decent aroma. Flavor is sharp and tart, with a sour-apple candy sensation. Fruit sensation is not strong. Has gueuze flavor profile, but is the sweetest gueuze I have tried to date. This has the odd effect of raising drinkability for uninitiated Americans like me, but takes it away from its traditions. Ah, this style still works on me- I am beginning to appreciate the ""classics", but it is a lot of work..."
"Drinkability  This is a good Gueze that can nicely introduce the style. It is not overly carbonated or sour and is an easy-drinker."
"Beer pours a clear golden color with less than a finger of head that leaves the beer quickly. The nose is tart with apple almost like a cider and rather dry. Wow, this is sour, but good. There are heavy apple characters with a sweetness that balances the tart. I like it. This is my first gueuze, so I don't have much to compare to, but it has the same sour character I associate he other lambics I've had. The beer is light to moderately in my mouth with a nice bubble carbonation. This would be a nice beer to present to someone that likes a sparkling wine to try and expand their horizons. I would drink it again, but you don't want too much, just like with wines."
"Longbeach is right. As a hard cider this is excellent. As a ""Gueuze"" it has issues. Clearly unpasteurized with lots of gamy, chewy, spicy, nutty flesh - it verges on cloying at the same time. Sour, peppery and sweet. I wonder how this would be mulled with clove and a cinnamon stick?"
"37.5cl bottle: (Under the Foudroyante alias). The beer pours a slightly opaque orangish color. There was a big head that died down quickly. The aroma is very sweet, yet slightly sour aroma also. Mainly apples to the nose. Somewhat apple and lemony to the taste. Somewhat dry and tart, yet still sweet. Nice, but not the best."
"Drinkability - interesting beer, but I probably won't seek it out. Glad I tried it though."
"Carefully decanted from the lees, it's a clear copper color with golden and orange highlights; and just a few solid particles in suspension. Tiny bubbles race to the surface, adding to its full, creamy white head. The retention is excellent and it leaves wide, creamy walls of lace. The nose is surprisingly sweet for the style with a touch of sour fruitiness over the traditional lambic characteristics (must, leather, barnyard, etc.). The body is thin, and it's crisp and zesty in the mouth due to it's natural carbonation; but it's also slightly drying and borderline astringent due to it's acidity. Its sweet and sour flavor hints at fruitiness upfront but warms to reveal a wheat-like maltiness and some subtle nutty character beneath. It finishes dry but with some sticky malt and short-lingering brett character. Overall, this is a fairly basic, restrained gueuze that should appeal to the masses. It's an excellent introduction to the style, and it offers immense drinkability to the initiated. Well worth trying or re-visiting."
"A hazy deep orange-copper color with a bubbly white head. Scents of green apples and sourdough bread are upfront, along with an earthy-grass aroma. Starts with a tart fruittiness that makes your mouth pucker. Sweetness follows and gets a bit cloying. Finishes dry and crisp. Thin and spritzy on the tounge. Drinkablity losses a bit due to the residual sugars that linger behind. Not bad at all, but I prefer their Framboise."
"As an aside, I had my wife give this a try - she does not like hoppy beer, and likes wine, so I thought this might appeal to her. Wrong. Her reaction was ""how can you drink this - are you sure it isn't spoiled?"" She ended up deciding that I had finally fried my tastebuds beyond redemption."
"My first Gueuze. Finally got a hold of one after a year of trying to get my distributor to order them for me. Poured a orangish tan with a nice foamy white head. The smell is all over, from champagne type yeastiness, to sourdough bread starter, cider, lemon. Taste was a nice combination of all of these with a winey cidery flavour dominating with the sourdough coming in at the mid and a citric bit of dryness at the end. Nice sour tart taste through out .The carbonation was nice and led to a good clean mouthfeel. Drinkabilty was above average. I dont think I could put away more than a couple of these, but It was definately a nice flavour. I know this takes some heat as not a real gueuze, but It was a good starting point. And if this is on the lower end of the spectrum I cannot wait to find some better ones to try."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is good. It has a very tart smell that is quite intense. I really can't make out anything else. The taste is great. It is light with a slight malt flavor. It's mostly hidden by the beer's sour nature. It goes down smooth and is very refreshing. I love lambic beers. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good sessions beer. It's not the best Lindeman's produces, but it's pretty damn good nonetheless."
"It poured a beautiful cloudy gold with plenty of sediment and carbonation visible. It had 1 finger of white head that quickly became a nice lace. It's smell was fruity and spicy. The taste was of malt and yeast almost gingery with a hint of a mix of Champagne and berries. It is wet and oily, but has a Champagne like tinge of tart dryness in the finish. What a great beer, the complex tastes made it a real feast. My only real issue was that it disappeared way to quickly."
"12 oz bottle, corked and capped. Pours into a goblet a hazy burnt orange with a signigicant amount of sediment particles swirling around with the small bubbles from high carbonation. Short lasting white head which left considerable sheets of lacing. Aroma is dominated by sour green apple fruitiness, tart acidity, and some notes of wet dog blanket. Mouthfeel is fizzy and tart. Taste has some mustiness, some wheat grain, and plenty of sour green apple flavors. This was my first Geuze, and I can't wait to try some others."
"pale amber color with a slight hazyness and decent white head. tart acidic aroma slightly fruity with some citrus and woody notes. surprisingly this has a slightly sweet taste in the beginning that I wasn't expecting. that's followed by a very good amount of carbonation and a little tarty sourness that dries out the mouth after you swallow. this is my first gueze so I don't really know what it should taste like but I gotta say this is fantstic to me."
" Very crisp with tingly carbonation. Initially a blast of tart fruits jumps into my mouth. I then get the same fruits, but they are now a bit sweet. It gets tart again for the finish. This is my first ever Geuze, so I really have nothing to compare it to, and I am pretty sure that once I crack open a vintage Oude (3 Fonteinen), my opinion will change. It was very drinkable, and I would imagine that I could sit down all night with some of these, and some tap Framboise of course."
"this is some pricey stuff. but ive never had a gueuze and being a fan of other lindemans offerings i sprung for it. it pours a nice deep orange and resembles champagne the way it sits in its glass. the smell was tart and grainy, fair warning of whats to come. this brew is tart, its dry, its puckering, and i like it. grainy and a touch lemony, always crisp. very refrshing. overall i really enjoyed this, i was astonished but i was pleasantly suprised. thumbs up."
"Clear copper/amber color with a rocky white head. Nice appearance, but not overly stunning. Aroma features only hints of what a gueuze should smell like -- minor brettanomyces and grass with a waff of sweetness coming through. Taste is quite disappointing. Starts off mildly tart and gueuze-like with additional hints of green apple, but the mid-palate features notes of sweetness and sugar that aren't fitting. Finishes thin and watery with that residual sugar leaving a trail of sweetness behind. Mouthfeel is far from great, as the watery dimension is just too prevalent. Fairly drinkable just the same, but far from a favorite. This could be a good introduction to those new to gueuze as it's not overpowering, but why bother? Go with Lindemans Gueuze Cuvee Rene instead if you're looking for the real deal."
"There's a part of me that wants to say this beer is fruity and thus not worthy of a review, but there's this other part that says it's exceptionally delicious and worthy of my praise. It's tart, fizzy, and altogether addicting. I'm no gueuze expert, but it's almost as if you took the other Lindemans and cut out the cherries and raspberries and whatnot. Nothin' but meat and potatoes in this summbitch, I tell you what. Good Stuff."
"A good beginner's geueze."
"This was a fun beer to drink and to try. It was rather simple though with tangy acidity and just enough sweet. The old sweet tart thing was going strong here. Poured a deep golden and had plenty of chunky sediment, and the head was plentiful. Ample carbonation and high acid ,to me, means get out the fried food! Paired well with home made frites and a freshly smoked, then grilled sausage."
"It drinks well but I have some reservations because of the wine flavor. The carbonation is a bit sparkly and poppy for me. Because of its complexity I do wish to try more of these types and maybe even this one again. A well crafted ale that has peaked my curiosity about Belgian ales."
"This was my first ever gueuze, a style I was looking forward to trying, and I surely was not disappointed! Lambics are such a pleasant little treat, and surely a wonderful and unique beer experience."
"Poured a hazy amber color. Slight, thin head and moderate carbonation. The nose is a mix of fruit (green apple, and citrus) and cider. Taste is composed of a minor sweetness up front and a cider-vinegar underbelly. Finish is tart and grainy. At once its subtle, complex, and intense. Not my favorite style, but its a load of fun to drink."
"The gueze is a unique lambic from the Lindemans line in that it's a non-fruit lambic. It poured a hazy orange color and left a fine lace in the glass. To me the smell was almost sweet and sour at the same time, grassy barnyard undertones and it seemed I almost got a whiff of apple. The taste was dry and a bit tart but finished very clean giivng it a decent drinkability. Not a regular choice for me but I will drink it occasionally in the future."
"The beer pours a hazy amber to orange color with the head largish in size, the texture semi-creamy and the color a bright white as it slowly dissipates, a fine sheet of lace forms to obscure the glass. Nose is sweet, citrus, malt laden and pleasing to the sniffer. Front is malt sweet, the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is tart, portly on the carbonation, the hops present, but mild with a sweet and sour dry aftertaste, a quite drinkable Lambic and worth the effort to sample."
"If it is to be Lindemans Gueuze for me in future; it will only be the stunning Cuvee-Rene."
"Hazy medium-brown with moderate slick white head. Aroma is acidic, wine-grapey, some undeterminate estery fruitiness. Flavor is remiscent of one of the tarter apple varieties. Nice malt and yeast flavors upfront with a refreshing sweetness followed by a short, sour finish. Leaves the palate quickly."
"Looks like it could be a single malt scotch in the glass. Smells sour, almost like green apples. Tart with a slightly sweet and possibly a bit bitter finish. Not at good as their fruit beers, however tt went fairly well with honeydew and procsuitto."
"This is my first experience with a non fruit lambic. This is interesting to say the least. Wine like characterstics with a very tart, dry finish. Even though this is not a fruit lambic, I did detect some raspberry flavors. Every sip was different than the last. I think lambics are one of those things where you don't really like it at first but the more you drink, the more you get used to it."
"Notes: A decent Gueuze, I have had better but this is good drinking none the less. Is it worth the $4-6 a bottle, that is up to you but for me I could not see dropping that much again with better brews out there."
"Unlike the other lambics made by Lindemans, this one is not flavored with fruit. Instead, it is a blend of different vintages of lambic. Brownish gold in color with a rich, vinous nose and winy palate. Faintly sweet, smooth, and well rounded with a mature dry finish. Great as a dry sherry substitute."
"a very simple but good gueuze, refreshing, and tasty, slightly sweet though for a gueuze, i like it more sour, but this isn't bad."
"Deep orange with a quality lace. Musty and earthy nose puts you in a dank European cellar. Sweet, dry and ultra tart. Light bodied and tasty. Pair with sharp cheese and fruit."
