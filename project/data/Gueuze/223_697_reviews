"Smell of apple vinegar, some pale malts. Taste is rather acidic, commonly bleak and malty, abit of apples and pears, dry and winy mouthfeel. Low carbonation, boring lambic."

"It goes a bit too fast from sour to sweet and back again, and has some bad malty notes. Otherwise, decent for its price."
"Drinks Belgian but tastes like a bottle shop owner has hung onto it a bit too much. Decent but a bit too stale compared with how it should taste."

"not as intense and bright as some beers in this genre, but not a bad version. the pour is really flat, like a glass of chardonnay, with no head or visible carbonation at all and a shiny white grape color. the nose is sour indeed, not so puckery or bacterial, but fruity and tart, again like a wine. the taste is pretty relaxed actually, and this beer is not nearly as complex and layered ad the usual gueuze, if there is such a thing... its sour but dry too, a little sleepy. the feel kills it for me, the light body is fine, but there is literally zero carbonation happening. its like a glass of flat pear cider or something, only sour. the rouge is a splendid beer, this one not so much when considered on the whole. cool to try it on tap at the monk on Colfax though, but I wont pay 9 bucks for one of these ever again."

"A drinkable and refreshing beer. However, it is actually a lager blended with a blend of old lambics. This is an odd-ball beer, like the Del Borgo Duchessic, which is a blend of saison and lambics. This is definitely a novelty beer--I can only wonder why someone would add lambic to a lager? Like any lager, I could drink a pint of it on a warm day and the lambic adds an interesting sour taste."
"Poured a hazy golden brown with a quickly receding white head. Slightly sweet aroma with some tartness in the background. A sour beer to the tongue surely, yet on the thin side. Grainy and nectar sweetness coming through. Much too light-bodied for this style. Somewhat acrid aftertaste, and not what I'd call a very drinkable beer. Approach with caution."
"This has a much better flavor than the aroma suggested, in fact the aroma was distracting enough that it took me a while to realize the flavor wasn't complete bunk. This is still a poor example of a Gueuze."
"Brouwerij Bockor makes a fantastic, textbook Flander Red Ale, but this attempt at a gueuze is just sad. It was not an enjoyable beer - and I had it overlooking Antwerp's beautiful main square alongside some delicious cheese croquettes, so that's got to tell you something. Indeed, this wouldn't be at all memorable were it not for where I had it and how disappointed I was with it."
"This brew poured all but no head. What little head it had was made up of large clear bubbles. It has a transparent amber body with some bubbles clinging to the side of the mug. I that an aroma of apple juice with a flat taste that contains some tartness. Not a really good brew, but not a drain pour either. I would not buy it again."
"Clear with no head... looks quite a bit like filtered apple juice.  Somewhat thin mouthfeel with little carbonation.  Very sweet aroma and flavor, with some notes of fruit.  Not very impressed by this one, especially considering the cost.  About $4 for an 8oz bottle."
"A sweeter gueuze,  and i suspect sweetened, very sweet nose, but has a bit of earthiness and tartness, but, it was a bit too sweet on the palate, i think this is obviously targeted at a wider audience. Not for hardcore beer fans, but theres enough in there to make it OK, slight sour tart flavour, but as i said too sweet."
"Notes: Lacks complexity and depth that the usual Gueuze expresses. This beer did not move me in anyway."
