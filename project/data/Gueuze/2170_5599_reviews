"Bottle: Poured a hazy dirty yellow color lambic with a nice off-white foamy head. Aroma of funky ester with some green apple tart notes is pretty enjoyable. Taste is a balanced mix between funky ester with some barnyard notes and green apple tartness. Body is full enough for style with good carbonation for an 8 year old bottle. Good balanced between complex flavours and good drinkability with limited acidity level which I appreciated."

"Mouth is lighter bod but typical, big acidic bite, nice carb for the age."

"Overall- artful.  a joy to drink."

"Overall: Really good geuze. Similar funk to 3F only less sour. Worth picking up if you can find it. It's one of the better geuzes out there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent without being all that dynamic. Missing some of the sour and malt characteristics that would allow this to transcend other gueuzes."

"Beer is medium-light to light in body, with carbonation of high intensity, resulting in a mouthfeel that is at first Closes dry and slightly puckering, with light stickiness coating the palate and lips."

"O- A really nice gueuze, I would certainly drink this regularly if it was easier to find in the US."

"O - this Gueuze is less extreme than Cantillon or 3F. Similar to Tilquin, but with less lacto. Not complaints. Easy to drink with moderate acidity for the style. It tastes different than the three mentioned. More reserved, less funky, has a maltier aroma and has a nicely balanced, elegant flavor."
"Overall, a really pleasant Oude Geuze to drink, light and airy, yet subtly complex. The whole beer is so well integrated in taste, body, and carbonation--nothing is out of place and the flavors sit on a mousse of carbonation, another example of a geuze as good as some fine champagne."
"Bright orange colour, fairly generous white head, good lace as well. Smell is sour and funky, earthy and grassy, tart lemony citrus, a bit of balsamic but very vibrant, lots of tart fruity notes, green apple, quite nice. Taste is sour and quite tart, cider and apple, fruity with some lemon, drying finish and well executed. Med-high drying carbonation, medium bodied. Awesome stuff here, drinks like a dream would welcome this gladly anytime."
""
"O: A pleasant, drinkable lambic. However, it isn't of the best in its category. Its balance is hampered by not enough acidity and too much yeastiness. Comparable to Lindemands."
"Translucent golden yellow with a white head, good retention and light lace. Nose of light sour citrus, wet hay/grass, some earthy tones, and horse manure in the peripheral. All that I want in a gueuze is found here. Taste has more hay, grass and light tart lemon. Earthy and dirt-y. Medium body, light/medium tartness. Hella refreshing, an amazing gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The mineral character and and the presence of some pleasant malt sweetness make this geuze unique, and it's eminently drinkable. I would have liked a bit more funk but besides that this is a delicious geuze. I wish we had better access to this in the US."
""
"Has a crisp tingly carbonation. The light bodied brew washes away fast. Dry. Like a champagne."
""
""
""
""
"O: A tasty beer. I like champagne, lambics, sours, and I liked drinking this geuze. The low alcohol makes it fairly session-able and the flavors are approachable. I think this would taste good with a flat bread pizza, fish, chicken, or light pasta dish. Would be good with fruit and cheese plate as well."
""
"OVERALL: Definitely on the more acidic and vinegary side of the spectrum, but not as much so as the Tilquin gueuze. This one had lots of tart, fruity esters and white wine notes worked well with the acidic component. This was probably my top choice out of the lineup, and I'd most likely really enoy a bottle myself. I used a little bit of this in my Tilquin - Cantillon blend, which worked out really nicely as well."
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great gueuze; it's super funky which I love. Tons of funk and cheese to it, especially in the nose...one of the funkiest smelling gueuzes I've had. Would love to have it again."
""
"This IS one hell of a Gueuze! De Cam beers are awesome!"
""
"Thanks again, Jeffo."
""
"Tis one pours a light bodied bright polished gold in color with no head but visible carbonation. The nose is super funky, with a bunch of hay, horse piss, sharp a acidity, and wet grass. It has some stank. The flavors are very sour, acidic, earthy, with loads of barnyard and horse blanket. The mouthfeel is light, probably mostly due to age, which makes this drink like an unblinded or draft lambic. Great flavor and far too easy to drink. This one was a gem."
""
"Classy gueuze with a near perfect nose and a much more raw flavour profile. The green capsicum character virtually imprints itself on the cerebral cortex. Similar to, but better than Mamouche in my view."
"O: Really nice gueuze, had no problem downing this bottle. Great level of tartness, not overly sour (even though I love them sour), but very balanced."
"O - I have to say, very impressive. Being over 10 years old, this is drinking perfectly at the moment. If anyone has a bottle with this kind of age on it, I'd suggest drinking it now. Recommend."
"O: Very interesting to try a gueuze so different from the other's I've encountered. Personally, I'd place it above Cantillon and below 3F."
""
"375 ml bottle. 2009 Vintage. The cork shot out as soon as the cage was released. Pours a hazy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a strong mineral note. There is also quite a bit of funk, lemon, light apricot, and some pear. The taste is apricot, pear, some light lemon, a bit mineral, and a light tartness. The finish has a distinct mineral note. Light bodied with medium-high carbonation."
"O: Smells better than it tastes. Maybe it needs age, but just average at this point."
""
"This has been the first bottle I have opened so far where the cork shoots out with the cage intact after I only have loosened the cage itself. Pours a clear golden yellow with a massive 4 inch fizzy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Lots of tiny bubbles are active in the beer itself after the pour. Small dots and chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. When I stick my nose into the glass and take a whiff I am met with an intense blast of funk that tingled and burned my nose and made the hair on my face stand on end. I am also getting very sour, tart, woody, and earthy aromas. Definitely one of the funkiest gueuzes I have ever smelled. Taste is of funk, lemony sourness/tartness, grain, and some slightly woody flavors. There is an acidic tingle on the palate with each sip. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with an extremely crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great gueuze and probably the best one I have tried thus far in my beer tasting journey."
"O - Very tasty geuze. After the initial sour burst, a nice balance of sour and funky."
"Overall: My first De Cam. Very impressive."

"Solid citrus flavor with an interesting, more lactic funk than other gueuzes. Glad I finally got to try this one, had to actually order it from one of the Belgian sites. Might have to get some more of it in my next order, it's pretty different."
"Overall A incredibly unique gueze that would only continue to mature with age. Top notch at this juncture and one of the best guezes I've had.Â "
"Overall: This is just a great example of a sour gueuze. Very enjoyable."
"overall, this is one excellent gueuze, wish i had more."
"This beer is FANTASTIC! It is very crisp and dry with lively carbonation. The beer is a little sweet at first, but the funky develops to give off lots and lots of bretty barnyard (combo of musty straw and horse pee). There is a lot of puckering lemon and bright orange zest. I immensely enjoyed this beer and would say this is one of the best examples of Gueuze I've ever had."
"This one was shared by beeruser with funkydelic, StayWhatYouAre2, 67couple, others, and myself at a recent tasting graciously hosted by beeruser! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Duvel Parra tulip. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle sour, funk, and bell pepper. The flavor was of sweet malt, bell pepper, funk, and slight sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Bell pepper, eh!? That is a new one for me in a beer... However, it really wasn't that bad in this one and actually helped bring out the subtle sourness I picked up on. This brew was very easy drinking and enjoyable. I would love to try one of these with a good bit of age on it to see how it develops over time. A definite must try, even if it is just to try and taste the bell pepper notes I got on it."
"Really enjoyable. Not necessarily better than the options available stateside, but worth a hearty tick!"
"Good light body with lively carbonation here. Pretty solid gueze here. One I'd love to have more of."
"My pour looks great, much to the surprise of the other gents, who had a quite different experience. Golden hued, with a finger of off white head that stuck around for a few minutes, before leaving some sparse lacing on the glass. The aroma offers wonderful barnyard funk, hay, light citrus, and oak. Great flavor, bringing everything I found in the aroma together quite nicely. The body is fairly thin, with low carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer. I seem to have enjoyed this quite a bit more than my counterparts. I would definitely have this again."
"into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel"
"Phenomenal throughout, this geuze hits on all cylinders. Very well-rounded and clean, this ranks up there with some of my favorites in the style."
"This is medium to light bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. The alcohol presents itself with a slight warmth down the back of the throat. Such a nice arrangement of enjoyable flavors and aromas, this was a fantastic brew to sip on. I need more. As a second glass is poured, more character of cheese comes out in aroma and flavor with a nice woodsy dryness that was not evident before. The finish gets more drying as it comes up to room temperature. Previously hidden notes of grass and light bubblegum come forward adding a strange twist to this brew. Fantastic stuff."
"Cheers!"
"I had heard reports of potato notes as well as red peppers but I tasted none of that. This was a 375ml of the 2009 vintage. The head on this was amazing, so huge and unyielding, bigger than any gueuze I've seen. The aroma was sour citrus and mild funk. The flavor was good, sour lemons, very refreshing. Overall this was a great gueuze. Its really a shame that we can't buy this in the U.S. because I'd drop some cash on it. As it is I really can't because shipping from Belgium is just too much. This reminded me more of a 3F than say Cantillon."
"beer is thin and bright on the palate with a mildly dry finish. overall it is a decent gueuze, the sourness comes through on the palate well and the feeling is really nice. I enjoyed it and I would have it again but I wished for a carbonated beverage."
"Pours a clear golden color with very head and zero lacing. A good swirl or two brings nothing back up, and subsequent hard pours didn't fare much better. The nose brought plenty of earthy barnyard and funk with some oak in the background. The flavor layered the funk quite well. Nice hay and earth and a dry finish that was quite smooth. Light body and very little carbonation. A pretty good example of the style."
"overall: great"
"Overall: A nice geuze, a bit too watery for my liking though. Is also missing the balance that is so clearly present in Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen geuzes. Still very very worth trying."
"O/D - Smoother than a lambic. A feature I quite like about Geuzes. Nice and grapey. Not a bad one."
"Bottled in 2009. Pours a clear orange gold with a medium head that settles into a thin cap. Nose is lush, juicy, kind of a very brett-forward, melon type nose or something. Definitely more brett heavy than most Belgian lambics I believe. Quite sour upfront, really high carbonation, which I enjoy. Still really bretty throughout, kind of eggy, sweaty brett. Citrus fruits, light fruits, a touch of white grape perhaps. In fact, it reminds me of Cuvee de Castleton a *little* bit, which is odd as I rarely compare genuine Belgian lambics to American sours. Acidity creeps up a bit in the finish. I can see how the components of this might play a role in the 3 Fonteinen blends but I'm not sure the really high carbonation works well with the overly brett-forward elements of this. I prefer the drier, more mineral-forward 3 Fonteinen blends. This is somewhat like Girardin Black but the funk and yeast in the Girardin is tighter, and to me this just doesn't *pop* how I wanted."
"D-insanely balanced with great fruity sweetness and juicy but awesome funk to it making it extremely complex."
"O: Good lambic all around, but could have used a little bit more of each of its traits."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found that each sip followed the last one easily and almost without thought. By the time lunch was served Iâd finished well over half of it. It also turned out to be a surprising good companion to the beef stew I was having. Iâll certainly be happy to have this again and I wouldnât mind seeing what a few years of age do with this beer. My overall impression is that this is a very good beer. Very different than the Cantillon but very good in its own right. This beer demonstrated to me that when it comes to lambics and geuze it is the wild yeast and their companion bacteria that make up the terroir of the beer."
"Tart puckering medium body with lots of sour barnyard funk without beng acetc or acdic at all. Intensely puckering but clean with lots of earthy funk and sourness without being harsh or abrasive. Slight light fruit presence with hints of apple and pear and a nice vinegar/vinaigrette flavor at the end of the swallow that leaves me drooling for more. I can't believe that this beer can be so complex, funky and drinkable all at the same time. Some sours/lambics/gueuze can become a bit much after a while but I could drink this beer all night. Amazing!"
"The beer had a lot of carbonation, it fizzed on my tongue like pop but with a silkier body. Very easy to finish the bottle, it was gone in no time, as was the meal."
"Overall this is another high class beer coming from the fields of Belgium, however my rating is slightly lower than it should be because of rating to style."
"D - I don't know if this is rare or what, I have never seen it save for today in the possession of (an awesome and generous) totally random bar patron. I want more!"
"D: A sure-fire stand out that makes a good argument for being the best ""standard"" gueuze."
"Drinkability: Glad we shared it, probably one of my least favorite gueuze"
"Right up there with Cantillon as a classic example of traditional Lambic/Gueuze. Unique in it's own right, with pronounced dry oak and citrusy fruit notes."
"Maybe the best geuze I've ever had."
"It's been almost a year since I had this last, but it's still my favorite of all the gueuze blenders."
"Yum. Face-meltingly sour, this geuze is. I'm getting kind of sweaty just remembering the hurt laid out on my palate. Brutal, but in a good way. Lots of tannic wood and funky Earth pulls through as it warms. Mouthfeel is frothy in its carbonation, while the thin body dries the tongue with each sip. For me, Gueze de Cam stole the sour category at our tasting, even with the likes of Blauw, DDG, and Bullfrog Magic Beans in attendance. A beer to savor. Thanks again for sharing this one Mike!"
"I'd forgotten how sour this beer is. Bracingly so, with a strong lemon and grapefruit pith sourness, there's plenty of citric and some lactic acid (definitely some yogurt), at a level where it hinders drinkability and the complexity of the nose. The funk is rather obliterated by the sourness. On the bright side, so is the sulfur. Bitter grapefruit pith on the finish, this beer is highly carbonated and is a demonstration in sourness. Moderate wood tannins with vanilla and wet oak are present. Solid stuff, but too sour to make a session gueuze (like, say, Girardin or Drie Fonteinen) 4/3.5/4"
"The taste opens with a sharp lemon-like flavor, both bitter rind and sour juice. Woody and earthy/funky flavors come out more as it breathes. Lactic sourness is dominant with only a trace of acetic acid. Finishes tannic and oaky with some lactic slickness sticking to the tongue. Very enjoyable, but not quite stellar. The beer improved as it sat in the glass and warmed."
"Finally cracked open a bottle I bought last year in Ghent. I also finally noticed the bottle date was from 2000, so I wasn't sure what to expect here. I think the beer was a little past it's prime, as it wasn't bursting with complexity. Instead, it had smoothed out a bit. Frankly, this just helped me drink more of it, so I'm not complaining. A lot of great gueuze will be bursting with flavor, but the sourness really hurts drinkability. So with this more subtle (for the style) tartness, the beer is still full of the trademark tangy lemon, citrus rind, and farmhouse character - it just doesn't beat you over the head with any of them. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking this beer again."
"Drinkability: Mouthfeel hurts it a bit and the flavor profile isn't to my liking, but this one is still pretty drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was prickly with a medium body. Finishes a bit deflated. Overall, very good!"
"Ultra Dry, Petroly tasting Geuze sampled at the Delerium CafÃ© on 8-18-08. 375 ml bottle dated Jan 2006. Plenty of funky horse hair aromas, gasoline, grapefruit, dust, etc... Flatish body is forgiven as the wildness of it all more than makes up for it. Citric flavor with touches of barnyard piss and soap. Mmmmm.... A treat. One of the best beers and biggest surprises of my stay in Belgium. Drinkable by the liter."
"375ml corked & caged, dated Jan 2006. No signs of carbonation, golden apricot in color. Smells, sharp apple-y, and a touch medicinal. Taste is very dry, with a nice finish. Tastes of dried fruit, with a malty note and a nice blended flavor that doesn't do anything too suddennly. The mouthfeel is pleasantly slick but utterly without carbonation. Drinkability is good, due to the nice balance/blending of flavors. A good gueueze, all in all."
"D - My wife and I drank the 750ml bottle with no problems - the ABV is low, the carbonation is right on, and the taste is terrific. The aftertaste gets a little palate-busting, but that's a minor complaint."
"Drinkability: Some may consider it somewhat tame, but it's still a very tasty, very satisfying brew."
"A sour lemony aroma with only a hint of mustiness to it. There is a definite sharp acidity to it, that I would say is on the hard side for the traditional geuze blenders. The carbonation is lively and seems to enhance the acidity."
"Taste: Low end carbonation pushes the acidity to good levels but without getting too astringent or ""burning", the funky flavor tastes a bit more corky than woody, it again reminded me of a dry cider, especially in the finish, it's drying and tart but oh-so easy to drink and makes you drink more and more! I'm glad I finally got to find one of these rare beauties!"
"While I had difficulty finding this one, and little success in describing it, I can say one thing for sure - I enjoyed it. Oh did I ever..."
"M&D: superb on the mouthfeel, that it's softly spritzy as a good Geuze should be; the texture sits on top of a profound body of wheat-malts and is prolonged by the phenomenal dryness and oaky aroma on the tongue. All in all, this is one of the best Old Geuze I've tasted, even better than 3 Fonteinen 2002 vintage even though this bottle is much younger. It's not outstanding because of stunning complexity, but the incredible depth, length, body, and balance all in one go. A sublime beer to kick off a special occasion like tonight, X'mas Eve. 8-)"
"Drinkability: The sourness necessitates that this is a sipper."
"Draft at Bruxellensis (9/9/06), my first beer in Belgium. 6% ABV."
"Best Geuze I have drunk so far. Congratulations for saving this unique beer."
"Big white foam covers the cloudy gold, sunny colored body. Typical aroma, straightforward fresh hay, cobwebs, cheesy hops, not as assertive as I expected from the kriek. Yeasty white wine, grapey, champaign reminiscent with concentrated dust and old books notes. It sounds better than it is if I may say so, it is just too light and thin-feeling an aroma to be world-class. This changes dramatically in mouth though, it is aggressively acid, very tart, cidery. Pinneaple notes, lasting apricot aftertaste. Many types of acidity, gently citrusy with grapefruit notes. Assertive, but nevertheless very drinkable. A labyrinth of musty flavours and one that is easy to finish. Foamy palate, authentic in soul, spritzy carbonation. Excellent stuff, delicate and well finished."
"The man in the bar was right: I have never drunk anything that was even close to this stuff. Did I enjoy it? Yes, however more like an oddity than something that would beat a good English bitter or ESB."
"Stinky, sour and dry, dirty nappies and cheese, puckery, lemony. Hardcore lambic pretty much at its best, the palate however, was a lot softer and less harshly acidic than something like Cantillon, or even Beersel, which i actually welcomed. i don't what i can really say other than there is simply nothing wrong with this gueze, all i wanted to do when i finished it, was have another one(Bottle- GBBF 03')"
"A very dry, sharp tasting, sour Gueuze. Oak is detectable in the aftertaste. The newest of the Gueuze blenders, the Bottle was dated 1998 and sampled in the De Cam Stekerij at Easter 2002. The Gueuze was extremely effervescent when de-corked. Excellent example of the style, a truly traditional Gueuze, will definitely become a favourite amongst Gueuze Monsters in years to come as the Vintages develop character, and may well mount a challenge for King Cantillons crown. The 1998 Vintage is one of the first batches to leave the Stekerij and hence the oldest. Review is for the 1998 Bottle. Note: Newer examples that I have tried (2000) lack the dryness and can be somewhat 'flat' when served. I believe that time will better this Gueuze in the years to come. Superb!!"
