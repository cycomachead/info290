I am sure that my expectations made this more shocking than it had to be, but since the packaging was so traditional with a heavy glass bottle and a Belgian style cork and cage I figured it would be real gueuze. It is not however, and though I try not to hold that fact against it, I am disappointed by the lifeless sweetened fizz in my glass. I wouldn't buy this again, but if you like sweetened pasteurized gueuze by all means give it a shot!

3.46,-0.3,2,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Mort Subite pours a pleasant amber color with a nice frothy head. The beer is quite clear, which is essentially impossible to do with the traditional approach, sending off warning flags. The nose has a vinegar-like acidity, with a cider character, minimal symptoms of Brettomyces. Flavor has an apparent, though one-dimensional acidity, and, like most ""new"" gueuzes, is corrupted by the sweetness of sugar. But, unlike most ""new"" gueuzes, the sweetness does not lead to failure here; it actually adds a nice cider/apple character, with similarity to the Rodenbach Gran Cru and is actually pretty well balanced by the acidity. Ultimately this this gives it a realistic and refreshing fruitiness. I don't hate this gueuze, but I will not drink it again.","gyllstromk","Apr 11, 2010"

There's also a bit of fruit in the flavor with white grape and lemon. The appearance is a deep, clear gold and a touch of lacing.

Popping off the wire-encased Champagne-style cork, I got a good whiff of a nice sour-fruit aroma wafting out of the bottle, and was happy that the beer didn't come spewing out at the same time. In the glass, this Lambic appeared a light golden colour with a reddish tint, and produced a few fingers of puffy white head. The smell was very tart fruit, like cherry or kiwi, accompanied by a mellow sweetness. The taste, likewise, was well balanced between the tart fruit and the light malty sweetness, although the carbonation was a bit on the high side. The first few sips were quite intense, but after breaking in the taste buds, the remainder of the bottle went down quite smoothly. Not something I'd want to have in a large quantity over the course of an evening, but quite interesting and flavourful (if you like sour fruit) for a round or two.","biboergosum","Jan 26, 2008"

3.4,-2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Popping the cork on this gueuze gives a nice, subtle hint of cherries and light fruit, perhaps mandarin orange and nectarine. Mort Subite pours into my glass a pale, somewhat hazy peach colour--quite attractive with these plus 30 heat waves in Alberta right now. The aroma is subtle as well: nothing is full-on here. What we get is some light fruit notes, the slightest of some tart yeasty esters, and a dryish, airy nose. Nothing terribly out of the ordinary, but rating in style, this is a very refreshing and appetising aroma. The taste is much the same, but even less tart or sweet than the aroma leads you to expect. Very light cherries or peaches, and a little light malting, plus a satisfying tartness which is quite subtle. Again, the beer is tasty and refreshing--there simply isn't much to describe about it. It works well, and has a light refreshing body and plenty of drinkability. I can't complain. It fits the style, and satisfied my thirst for a subtle, tart, lambic.","Cwrw","Jul 23, 2007"

The mouth was well-carbonated and light despite the tartness. Strong raspberry flavor joined by some bready malt. No hopes were noticeable. The aftertaste was short and tart.
