"Nice cork pop, no gusher, big, thin head that goes away somewhat quickly. Nose is immediate lemon, wood and funk. Taste is funky, tart, cheese, pickle juice and some red fruit. Quite bubbly on the mouth and thin, very dry. Overall, a decent brew and shared w/ my brother who had never had anything like it."
"This is excellence! So beatiful and great taste! Just love it!"
"Super drinkability, I sure this would be interesting with some age on it.  Taste delivered, didn't quite deliver in other areas"
""
"Pours a burnt orange into my tulip. Thin white head lingers for a while. Smells of hay, lactic acid, some lemons, and slight acetone spew out of the glass. The first sip is an explosion of tart funk all over the mouth. Some lemons and lactic acid linger before vanishing. The finish is pretty clean. There is a muted tartness that can be perceived but the finish is quite quick. Prickly on the tongue and a little thin."
"I might not favor this to the same extent that fans of the style do, but this was tasty. Worth trying as a reference point for gueuze beers."
"Dont waste your time hunting LPG. This might be better and much easier to find"

"Overall solid, a great example of the style. Balanced and nicely funky."

"Pours a golden hue with a fair amount of head.  Smells funky, sour, musty, and earthy.  Taste is sour and acidic reminescient of yogurt.  Notes of tartness, maybe lemon, oak, and vinegar.  Mouthful is light and very carbonated.  Overall, an awesome sour that will clean a palate."
"Barnyard funk and pleasantly tart. Mmm."

"D: This was a slight gusher and began with too much carbonation. The nose and flavors are complex and delicious. Over time the carbonation settled making this beer extremely drinkable and probably the best gueuze I have had. Flavors take you on a roller coaster ride of bright and earthy, sweet and tart."

"O: Magnificent. There aren't many beers with this sort of depth. It looks fantastic, while the aroma and flavour are incredible. Sour, funky and dry, with hints of yeast and grain. Excellent body. Challenging but rewarding; this is the pinnicle of Belgian brewing and possibly the best lambic I've had yet. The balance is superb - this is a world-class brew that deserves to be added to your must-try list."

"A well balanced lambic as none of the flavor notes are overpowering.  Each takes its turn on your palate and you're left with a refreshing beverage."
"A very solid representation of what I understand the style to be.  This pour was a tad expensive, so have to consider that for future purchases, but this should stay on my radar, since I see bottles at my local shops."

"Colour yellow, cloudy. White head but delicate, light, coral. Beer aroma, slightly fruity. The taste of cucumber, apple, lemon, some bitter and sour, tart, heavily saturated. Not for everybody. Super."

"taste: more of the same. No way I can explain a Geueze and make it sound it good, but this is so tasty. Much like the nose, mostly dry and damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Begins slightly sour with a notable fruitiness of lemon rind and unripe peach, also musty yeast which helps to keeo the beer in balance. Then sour, dry acidity becomes more and more detectable. It hits the palate in an intense, but refreshing way. The sourness in this Gueuze goes through different stages on the palate. At first, defined by a subtle fruitiness, then with slick yeast and soft yogurt notes, to finish with a dry, tart aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is great -lots of wild yeast flavor with a somewhat lemony taste with slight hint of wood in the back-end which brings a subtle tannic or spice to the flavor with mild malt which seems dry on the palate with herbal element and sour flavor the most dominant into the smooth relatively dry finish. Overall I really enjoyed this both on draft at Moeder and this bottle which had 2012/2013 on the neck label -very vibrant and a joy to drink!"

"Overall: It's a very good Gueuze that already tastes like it has a good deal of age on it. While it's possible to drink it fresh, It has a ""best before"" date of 08/01/2024 on the bottle. I will revisit this beer somewhere down the line when it has aged out some more. That ""popcorn"" flavor and aroma is very strange. It doesn't taste bad, it just tastes odd. Un-aged I would not drink another bottle."
""
""
""
"O – I very rarely get to drink gueuze, so to find a renowned example and have the whole bottle to myself was pretty exciting.  This is a beer that a lot of people would try and say “this is beer?”  I let a couple people sip this and that was the exact reaction I got.  It’s very brisk, refreshing, and seems simple and complex at the same time.  Each taste felt new.  I don’t LOVE it, but I think it’s a fantastic beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Really good stuff. There is a grapefruit pith type flavour that keeps its tart and refreshing.  Maybe not a whole lot of complexity but still an interesting beer to drink.  One of the better gueuzes I've had."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: 4.5 - This is a very tame yet complex lambic. A definite classic flavor profile but a little too smooth and clean. I couldn't wait to drink this but that's most likely my problem. It will definitely improve with age but a must have without to truly get a feel for this amazing lambic. A definite must try."

"Rating is based on Batch 1 from 2010/2011.  Also had 2012/2013 side-by-side which was also nice, but not quite as good as the older iteration.  Both poured from bottle into gueuze glass at Monk's in Philadelphia."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Nice vibrant and hazy golden, aromas of sweat, blue cheese funk, mild black pepper, and a strong tartness.  High carbonation, juicy flavors and moderately drying.  Very nice."

"Overall: This is pretty fantastic gueuze. It's right up there with Cantillon and 3F. If this had just a bit more funk or complex notes, it would put this gueuze over the top. Maybe one day they'll stock this on the shelves in Texas so I can buy it all."

"O: 4.5 A lot of classic gueuze flavors going on in this beer and overall done very well. It could be a bit more sour in my opinion, but I’ll age one for a while and see how it develops."

"O: A very layered and complex gueuze that I wish I could try next to some of the other well known lambic blenders. This seemed less acidic and bright than the Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Overall recommended and worth cellaring to see what time will bring. Brings a wide variety of weird funky and sour flavors to the table."
""
""
"O-An intense Gueuze. Packed more punch that I anticipated. I was happy with this; I was expecting something less authentic, so this was nice."
""
""
"Poured into teku. Perfect blend of sourness, creamy mouth, and low heat. Wonderfully drinkable and not too tart. Still the sourness does come through and doesn't disappoint. A nice lingering sour aftertaste as well. Doesn't seem overly dry to me. Instead, it has a crispness to it. If anything, any dryness is subtle. Excellent representation of this style. Never disappoints."
""
""
"O: Definite 9 out of 10 from me. Excellent on all accounts. To know Boon and Cantillon’s lambics amongst other great breweries’ are in this, makes me appreciate it all the more. I found this in Whole Foods, Birmingham AL, and am drinking it in Hopkinsville, KY."
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent complex and balanced gueuze. I'm sure Tilquin will soon be in the ranks of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen."

"O: nice sour, balanced between sour and fruitiness"
""
""
""
""

"Brilliant golden color, with almost no head. Aroma is lactic, acetic, and earthy, with a toasted oak character. There's almost a blue cheese sharp funk to it. Flavor reveals sour cherry notes, along with a clean, acetic and lactic character that dries nicely in the finish and becomes slightly barnyard/phenolic. Very impressive in the sourness that erupts and fades, cleansing the palate perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little over exuberant on the sourness. Lots of complexity of both bright and mellow flavors, but you really have to work to get through all that tanginess."

"Hazy amber golden pour with quickly reducing bubbly white head. Pungent aroma of barnyard funk, grass and hay, sweet peach and grape, lemon peel. Aromas carry through to the taste; coats the tongue with malty sweetness and fruit flavor (peach, orange, bright lemon peel) mixed with earthy funk and lactic acidity that dries out towards the end in oaky tannins. The finish has a nice lemon peel pop I like in a Geueze but the finish is marred by some astringent bitterness like biting into a pill. I opened up a 2012/13 when it fresher and it wasn't quite ready yet; It's now coming together nicely and may benefit from a little more time. This is a great gueuze that is easier to find but not quite as good as 3F or Cantillon."

"The body is medium and there's a certain creaminess to it even with the dryness. It is also, though, very crisp and bright. It's extremely refreshing, acidic without being harshly astringent, with a powdery and clean finish even as the puckering sourness makes it a little juicy, and carbonation is nearly perfect."

""

""

""

"This is a good Gueuze, but I don't feel it ranks up near Cantillon or 3F Golden Blend for pure overall taste and experience. Nothing Tilquin does here is poor, but only the mouthfeel stands out as truly superb. Worth a try."

"Overall sophistication. Putting this in my chambers. More of a wild ale session but all in all quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Gueuzes typically exhibit a rounded profile of tartness, funk, oak and barnyard character. Even with two years of age, this beer was a bitter, pithy, sour bomb. It reminded me more of an over-hopped American wild ale than any type of gueuze I have ever sampled."

"Nice to still be able to (at least occasionally) find a good Gueuze, and this is definitely a good one. The popularity of sours in this country has soared, making beers like this harder and harder to fine. Pours a dark straw color with a fine white head that thins and then settles to a ring. Nice tart aromas of green apples and a vinegar tang, as well as some light hay and the tiniest bit of barnyard funk. Much less than in some others. Thankfully, no band-aid. The taste is a bit more complex with all of the elements found in the nose present along with a vinous quality and some nice minerality. Still not a lot of funk, but long, complex sour flavors with a touch of bitterness and a slightly soft finish. Very nice indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't drink cider and I certainly don't drink old sour dry cider that a vinegar fly has got into: it reminded me of that."
""
""
"O - I like this beer. Taste is pretty malty, especially when the sourness passes. Very easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall worth a try. Glad I checked it off my list."
""
""
""
"Tilquin blends a good gueuze. It really showcases my favorite aspects of the style, minerality and bright lemon acidity. It's tart and puckering, complex and easy drinking. It's great to be able to grab a gueuze of this quality whenever you feel like it."
""

"A bottle of the 2011-2012 at 750 ml. A big spritzy head that stays but doesn't leave much on the side of my glass. Beer stays covered all the way through. Cloudy golden amber with a visible amount of carbonation going on. Nose is superb and hits all the notes in the scale of greatness. Wine, hay, grass, vinegar, oak, funk, pale malt, faint honey, and the list can continue. Taste is ridiculous. Supremely balanced with lots of tart acidic notes that follow a surprisingly malty front. Oak is big but not overwhelming as it seems to bind the malt and vinous elements together into an amazing whole. The honey from the nose flows ever so gently underneath it all carrying the flavors to a firm but not overpoweringly sour and dry finish. Oh there is quite a pucker, but one that takes you back to the glass for more and more. It's almost addictively good. Feel is silky, and vigorously creamy in its carbonation. The weight is perfectly balanced and combined with the other seductive qualities of this beer I found myself seasoning what should have been a sipper. Sipping this one is an act of incredible self restraint. I had this with amy favorite cheese and my wife who is not a big fan of sours joined me in the hearty consumption of this stellar brew."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/20/2022. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, grass, leather, pepper, white vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, oak, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, leather, light bread, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/funk yeast oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp, smooth, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Gueuze! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."
"Overall I thought thought this was a very nice beer and even with my very limited experience with this style I'm still pretty sure that this is a good example of the style. I liked that the sourness was almost at the edge of being too sour but it wasn't super acidic and that made it easier to drink than I expected. This beer had nice drinkability, I sipped on it faster than I i expected, it was fairly smooth, clean, crisp, not too acidic, not to filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention but I think one of these 375ml bottles would be my limit, I think it would start to wear one me if I had more than that. What I liked the most about this beer was that it wasn't overly sour and overly acidic, I think both were at a good level. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, I just wish there was some decent head and lacing. I would get this beer again, it's a little expensive, but I think it's nice to have for special occasions and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sour beers. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I didn't fully know what to expect from this beer, but it turned out to be something I enjoyed and I'm glad I took a chance on it, it made for a nice beer to have for my 800th review. I'm for sure interested in trying more beers from this brewery and more Gueuze's. Great job guys, this was a very nice and memorable beer, keep up the great work."

"O- Each sip changes the complexity of the flavors. At first I was getting some fruity flavors and sourness, then almost an earthy funk flavor, then sweetarts, then unripe fruit. It just bounced around, making each sip unique. A really interesting beer. The bottle says the ingredients are simply: water, malt, yeast, hops. Pretty amazing to see how diverse 4 simple ingredients can be."

"Poured bottle into steamed wine glass. Smell is a lot of funk, grassy, some onion. Taste is full of lemon and other citrus, plenty of funk, earthy, oak, nice subtle malt. The carbonation is really nice. Overall I really liked this, I'm not very experienced with gueuze styles but I'm glad the guy at the shop recommended this"

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours a deep hazy orange color with only a small ring of fizzy white head. Aroma of sour vinegar, some minty effervescence, orange peel, apricots, cherry, green apple. This smells glorious. Flavor is big green apple, sour vinegar, some candy sugar. Effervescent but not as much carb as I expected, easy drinking, mouth puckering. Overall I like this a lot, even more so than Drie Fontenin's Oude Gueze. Nice beer."

"This was a highly anticipated tasting for me, a Gueuze ""coming from worts brewed by Boon, Lindemans, Girardin and Cantillon breweries..."" It was enjoyed at the fine establishment called 'The Blind Tiger' in NYC. Aesthetically, this beer is right on the mark when it comes to the style, with its pale straw color, slight haze, and thin ring of white over top. After a few deep inhalations of the nose, I picked up a certain powdery cue, something like powdered sugar, or closer still, actual baby powder. Other than that, assorted bittersweet fruit esters. Flavor wise, it's much more sour than I would have guessed, almost pucker-inducing, which is just fine by me! Also a tad earthy, which blends well with the overall flavor. A bit grassy, with rinds of citrus fruits coming to mind. Overall, this has that good balance of acidity and funkiness that the best examples of this style demonstrate. Very much worth the price."

"Wow, this stuff is damn good. And what's even better - it's relatively available and moderately priced for the style. This stuff could certainly stand up to some of the greats, and I believe this beer can be overlooked by many (yeah, yeah, the rating is high... but still, this is a very impressive brew). Sourheads rejoice, funkheads rejoice, gueuze lovers celebrate... Go get yourself some Tilquin and thank me later."

"There may not be many, but Tilquin à L'Ancienne is definitely one of the best Gueuze out there. Anyone in possession of a bottle should treasure it like a precious and priceless family heirloom. Anyone planning to age one would be wise to invest in a safety deposit box. All hyperbole aside, it is honestly one of the finest beers I've ever had (and could have again and again)."

"Overall: Solid beer thats a nice offering, but it didnt blow me away. Good entry level gueuze, but I recommend that you just pay the extra money and get something with more complexity for a beer from the Gueuze beer style. Examples like Drie Fountienen Oude Gueuze or Golden Blend."
""
""
"Overall: Like a good champagne. Not particularly funky or sour, but comes with a nice refreshing carbonation and good acidity. It's good on a hot day. I prefer 3F or Cantillon's regular geuzes, but this is a lot more easily obtainable where I am. So I recommend trying this at least once, if it hits your spot, great. If not, well keep on looking for that delicious and easily+reasonably obtainable geuze.. if there is a such thing."

"Pours a pale, orange-shaded gold color. Quite cloudy. Small white head, lots of little bubbles. Aroma has lots of earth, sour lemons and a pleasant mineral tone. Lots of musty fruit - apples, berries, grapes. Medium vinegar and oak. Taste is sour lemons upfront, then some fruity malt flavor and back to more sourness that follows through into a long-lasting finish. Fairly dry. Solid pucker. Nice tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is a light sparkle on top of a relatively full body for a lambic."

"Pours a hazy golden orange color. A bit darker than most other gueuzes (3F, Cantillon). The head is an off white color that hangs out for a little while with an aggressive pour. The aroma is bright and pronounced. Lemon brettiness. Moldy funk. Really wonderful. Flavor follows suit with a more pronounced funk and sour profile. Finishes dry with a great sweetness reminiscent of underripe peaches and lemon juice. Dry, complex, and delicious."

"Overall: This is an excellent, and probably a bit under appreciated, gueuze. This is extremely well balanced and can certainly hang with some of the more well known producers of the style. Definitely worth picking up if you see it on a shelf."

"EDIT: changed a few scores after my second bottle. This one a 375mL with a best before of 02/03/2021. The aspirin quality that was distracting in the first bottle wasn't present in this one. A little less carbonation too. A pleasure to drink."

"O: This is definitely a top 10 Gueuze for me. The mouth watering quality is just out of this world, its ridiculously refreshing and the head stuck around for the entire time I enjoyed this brew. I will definitely buy again. 4.75"
"Think blue cheese and quince paste, but with the extremes of salt and sugar replaced with sourness. A lovely gueuze."
""
""
""
""

"Mostly clear orange with a low, fluffy head on top that settles to a creamy ring. Tart, lactic aromas of funky lemon, granny smith apples, grass, sour citrus, berries, and a light sweetness. Sour, woody flavors...earthy lemon, leather, damp hay, and mustiness. Crisp, light, and super dry. Excellent! The draught version is a little brighter and more outright refreshing, but this has deeper complexity. Both are noticeably lemony and not over the top with acidity and you really can't go wrong with either."
"Overall a crisp, bright, drinkable, well-made beer."

""
""

"This beer has a golden amber glow to it and a white bubbly head on top. Retention is mediocre. Deep and bright aroma. Dark fruity berries, wild flowers, rooty plants, stinky stinky stinky. Flavor is tangy and delightful. Fermented fruit, dark and smokey and very bitter. Mouthfeel is great. Overall an excellent choice."
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as gueuzes you can pretty much find at anytime go, this is the one to get. I don't think it quite matches the intensity/mastery of some other Belgian brewers but certainly close."
""
""
"This poured out as a bright hazy orange color with a foamy white head on top. Pretty standard for the style. The retention is pretty solid but no noticeable lacing. The smell of the beer is acidic, sour and tart smelling. There is a subtle sweetness as well. The taste of the beer is tart like a lemon or other citrus fruits, with a pretty good pucker to it. The malts come in lightly in the finish. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a solid carbonation. Overall it's a good representation of the style, worth checking out for sure!"

"O: Very delicious. Thoroughly enjoyed this one and will definitely be setting some aside for storage."

"Overall- Really impressed with this, and I'll definitely be seeking out some more. Perfect for this beautiful Sunday afternoon"
"Poured a clearish golden body with giant head thanks to great carbonation on top of an aroma that I can really only describe as both sweet and sour. These tart cherries and splash of funk hit me along with sour apple or grap smells, and then I get this yeasty, woody aroma that has a touch of sugariness in it. Light to medium body and goes down easy, extreme sour and funky notes that are like sour apple/pear and have a veggie-like graininess to them, as well as a good amount of tartness to it as well. Enjoyable sipper, the yeast and oakiness help smooth it out and it has a touch of sweet fruit notes on the backend to make a very good beer."
"The beer pours a golden orange with copper highlights. It also pours with a healthy finger’s width head of pebble like, creamy white bubbles that are constantly fed by a maelstrom of bubbles racing up throughout the glass. The head leaves a lacing of fat dry bubbles that clump into sheets on the glass. In body, the beer is properly hazy, though the other side of the glass is slightly discernable. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully funky with big cherry leather scents and pineapple with light spicy notes and distinct lingering horse sweat. There is even some slight cheesy notes tending towards a blue or parmesan cheese. On the tongue, the beer tastes acidic and sweet with just a touch of herbal bitters and some nice rounding salty notes. In flavors, the beer begins with spicy pepper but moves quickly into sweet and funky pineapple and cherry leather flavors with sweaty nuances and a touch of cheese. The pepper returns on the finish with a faint touch of wheat and a lot of sweet funk and acidic pineapple. The aftertaste moves into lingering cherry leather flavors with a funky spice accenting it. This beer tastes very nicely funky. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, perhaps a touch below medium, with a thick carbonation that peppers and then caresses the taste-buds, allowing for the sweetness of the funk to do its thing, but also for the beer to note get cloying in nature. The mouth is left gushing with acid neutralizing saliva, and begging for more beer. Overall, this is a tremendous gueuze that I will regularly return to. Of the gueuzes I can regularly find, I believe this has become my new favorite. Rich and complex funk really shows itself in this beer, but the sweet and acidic components are nicely balanced, perhaps with just a touch too much acidity. This is a great beer, and wonderful for summer sipping. If you like funk then you will like this beer."

"2011 vintage. this pours a darker than average brassy color, dull and cloudy, with some floating yeast and a huge white head several inches high with good retention. the nose is a little funky, but not nearly as blatantly sour as I am used to in the style. it is evident that there is a lot more malt in here than usual. the flavor confirms that, its got a gentle caramel sweetness to it that really softens the most acidic edges of the gueuze, a characteristic that is not particularly becoming in this context. there is some lemon acidity, but not as fresh or as pungent as it could be, and a lot of the yeast intricacies feel somehow muted to me. I want this style to snap my head back and dry my mouth out, this one doesn't do that at all. it is not unpleasant, and may be a good introductory beer to the style, but its a far cry from some of the best in the business. fuller body, still with excellent carbonation. I really don't dislike this beer at all, I just feel like its not the best example of the genre. still, a good bottle that is fairly widely available."

"Thanks to KingKong for the generous extra. 375ml corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash Coolship glass. 2011-2012 indicated on the front label; best before 21/03/2022 indicated on the back label. Pours a hazy, golden-orange with a loose, bright white head the quickly sizzles and pops as it collapses into sudsy slick that eventually disappears completely - no lacing on this one. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution. Nose expresses citric acid, rind and is quite sharp. There's also a slight medicinal quality present as well. Taste is quite tart, with the characteristics present in the nose also present in the flavor profile, minus the medicinal character. There's also a suggestion of cork. Mouthfeel is light and bright with quite a bit of acidity and a lively, almost prickly carbonation. Overall, a solid gueuze; however, a bit young. Definitely would like to see how this beer develops with some time."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a pleasantly soft, gentle foaming that mixes well with the notable acidity of the beer. Closes quite dry, with minor stickiness lingering across the palate."

"In my opinion, this surpasses the draft version for upholding the yeasty texture that makes this beer really one of a kind in the world of oude gueuzes. I could seriously drink this every day if I had the budget and patience to do so, as it's refreshing, complex, yet ridiculously balanced overall given the variety of flavors it provides. Pleasant to drink. World class for sure!"

"O- Finally! A gueuze I can really get down with! After having the overly intense Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze, I was hesitant to drop another $12-$15 on a little 12.7 oz. bottle of something I thought I might dislike. But I'm glad I took the risk as this is a very enjoyable beer. Not too sour, not too harsh. A great example of the style IMO."

"Instant hartburn. I don't think i can finish this beer. considering the only beer i dumped in the last couple years had shards of broken glass in it, that's saying alot. by far one of the worst 'great' beers i have had in a while. starting to wonder if every beer is c+ or better on beer advocate."

"O - All kinds of funk, citrus flavors smooth this one out."
"T: Opens with a nice vinegar snap of tartness. Green apple and sour white grapes followed by a slight hint of grain and a very tart, lingering, slightly dry finish that leaves you wanting a lot more. Lemon comes in on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is light and the carbonation is pretty lively without being overwhelming. A pretty fantastic gueuze."
""
"O: Pretty much what you would expect from a gueuze. The blending of the different worts definitely works, and provides some nice complexity and balance. Fairly averagely priced, too. Worth a try"

"The beer pours a cloudy orange-yellow with an effervescent white head that settles down into a thin blanketing. The nose is sweet and sour with a touch of tangy citrus. Its taste presents an initial sweetness which soon transitions into a potent, saliva inducing sourness, and finishes with a slightly herbal, champagne-like dryness. The herbal characteristic is so subtle I'm wondering if it's just my imagination... The beer is light bodied and drinkable with ample carbonation and sweetness to counter its immense sourness. Honestly, this beer gives cantillon and 3F a serious run for their money and for the price it is definitely worth trying."
"O: The beer initially makes your mouth water then dries it out. This is a well balanced Gueuze that is refreshing and tart."

"Clear orangeish, with a light white head, film of retention and some lacing. Nose of dill, lemons, green apples, grains, barnyard, sweaty socks and butthole (srs, but a clean one). Some earthy tones as well and light barrel. Taste has more lemons, apples, barn-y funk, acetic but sweeter malt character. Not as sour as I expected, and it's awesome for this. Medium high carbonation, and excellent balance. Awesome."

""
""
"Overall- This is incredible. Damn near perfect gueze."
"O - Very drinkable gueuze. Solid, true to form, and accessible."
"2011 bottle. Pours a pale, orange-shaded gold color. Quite cloudy. Small white head, lots of little bubbles. Aroma has lots of earth, sour lemons and a pleasant mineral tone. Lots of musty fruit - apples, berries, grapes. Medium vinegar and oak. Taste is sour lemons upfront, then some fruity malt flavor and back to more sourness that follows through into a long-lasting finish. Fairly dry. Solid pucker. Nice tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is a light sparkle on top of a relatively full body for a lambic. This is an excellent beer, and it's wonderful to have another traditional lambic brewer available in local stores. I hope to see more lambics available from Tilquin in the future."
""
""
""
"Taste is juicy citric character, but not too tart or sour but almost, some grassy herb bitterness, lightly tart/bitter fruit skins. It needs more rustic earthiness, though, to be truly great in my book. It has a nice, engaging and lively feel."

""
""
""

"O: It's a nice sour ale. I wouldn't call it beginner friendly at all, though, due to the tartness. I would point fans of Flanders sours to this one, however. Shame it had compete against the two titans of the style - even though it came in third in the gueuze showdown, I reckon it would be superior to any other gueuze on the market (not from Cantiloon or 3F, that is)."
""
"OVERALL: This was a good and challenging gueuze, thought the vinegar and acidity was perhaps a touch too much to really make it an enjoyable drink. A full bottle might be rough. That said, this was one of my favorites of the evening, and is definitely more my style. It also mixed really well with the Cantillon once I started belnding myself. Well worth checking out. Recommended."

It tells me my appraisal is probably accurate and my approach to this style seems to be developing my palate in the proper way. I'm glad this beer was suggested to me. It's easy to find where I live, so I anticipate buying a bit more of it. The quality of this beer cannot be denied."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a huge bubbly white head that held on for over a half hour while I made dinner! Wonderful tart and fruity and funky aroma. Smells of lemons, sour oranges and sour apples, pepper and yeast esters, a bit of funk and a hint of acetic. The flavor is a nice mix of funk and tart with peppery and yeasty funk up front followed by some light tart fruits, plastic phenols, and finishing with a long lingering lactic and lemon finish. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart funky lightly puckering mouthfeel. I can see what all the fuss is about here this is a damn fine example of the style if not a hint on the bold side of things. I really enjoyed this, if only they sold it local to me."

"Bought at the butcher shop downtown. Uncaged the bottle, set it on the counter and then cork just shot out of it. Didn't know I wanted a geuze mark on the ceiling, but I like it! Poured into my coolship Allagash glass to a nice hazy yellow with a decent and lingering head. Wonderful aroma, definite farmhouse funk that is very reminiscent of the cantillon geuze. Pretty decent mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. Taste is tart and refreshing that vanishes well, leaving you wanting more."

"Ranks among the best off-the-shelf sours available in America."

"A tasty gueuze, not amazing, but nicely sour and distinctly dry. Flavor has decent depth, but it's a little on the dry-thin side."
"O - More on the crisp/refreshing side than the earthy/funky side at this point, though there is a nice funkiness. Looking forward to seeing how this develops. Hopefully the flavor will be equal to the aroma someday. Still, a very enjoyable gueuze."
"Overall, fantastic. A really excellent gueuze. Wish I had bought more!"

"Bottle poured into snifter. Appearance is hazy orange with dense creamy white head, great retention, some lacing. The nose has a lot going on...notes of sourdough, lactic acid, and oak come through the biggest. Some delicate waves of lemon and funk come through as well. The taste incredibly tart and fruity. Note of white wine, oak, and loads of lactic acid are present. There is some underlying funk that is at the perfect level for my taste. The front is puckering tart which develops into a balance with some moderate sweetness. This one is delicious. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this is one of my new favorite gueuzes. Great range of flavors and delicious balance. Very tart and definitely worth seeking out."
"O : Not as complex as I expected but balanced and enjoyable. Very approachable for the style."

"O- A really awesome gueuze, the aroma on its own sets this beer apart. Has nice complexity and is highly drinkable."

"An approachable enough, if that's a real thing, gueuze. The sour and tart notes are there, for sure, and the funk is restrained to a bit part, so no one should be all that overwhelmed - a single extreme flavour at a time, and all that. As for me, I found this to be nicely in my face at first, and then forgiving as I acclimatized, and then rode out happily to the end."
"Pretty enjoyable. Probably not as good as most Cantillon stuff, but lots of complex flavors and subtles."
"O: Bright, acidic - not the most complex but really tasty and well-done."

"I've heard this is one of the less sour gueuzes around, and I in fact did not find it real sour. I think for that reason, I was able to truly enjoy this."

"Wow, excellent brew! Poured cold with a large, off-white, foamy, frothy, thick head that lasts a while and lots of lace. Color is a slightly hazy amber with a load of tiny bubble trails. Aroma is yeast, sour, bread dough, malt - a fresh and clean quality. Flavor's like nose, fresh and clean, very dry with bitter and carbonic working very well with each other. Back of the tongue is left with an astringent feel. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, with a slight dry champagne flavor and again very clean. Outstanding."

"375 ml bottle. Label is 2010-2011. Pours a clear golden amber with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. Aroma is funky brett, some light lemon, and a light earthiness. Not terribly complex, but not bad. The taste has a light initial sweetness with some barnyard funk, light lemon, and a decent tartness. The finish has a funky earthiness. Medium body. Light carbonation. Not bad, but not nearly as complex as the best gueuzes. I'll be curious if the 3-year blend is a big improvement over this 2-year blend."

"Nice tones throughout on this beer, though it doesn't really ""blow me away"" in any particular way. It's just ""good."" Nice character, nice feel, nice all the way around.

I think I may get several of these and let them rest for a while."

"had this at city beer store in San Francisco. Pours a light, hazy yellow. Tastes nicely sour with some tartness. Fruits like green apples and some lemon come through on the taste. The sourness wasn't overpowering. Drank down really smooth. This style is really opening my eyes to these type of beers. very tasty."
""

"Light-bodied with lively carbonation. Very dry, clean drinking and refreshing. Paired extremely well with some locally-made goat cheese and crackers while spending the weekend in wine country on Long Island. A bit on the expensive side or I’d buy a whole lot more of this."

"Given what went into this blend, there's no surprise that the end product is world class. Definitely a winner and a must try in the ""easier-to-procure"" gueuze category."
"O - Well that's very interesting. It's certainly not what I'd reach for when I want a beer. But it's a really nice other category of beverage, and pretty refined. Flavorful, pressing a few buttons, yet tastefully restrained and classy. I could see serving this at a nice dinner party, whether just for the people who aren't into beer or for everyone. More people should know about this category. I love that the expiration date for a 2011 beer is 2021."
"Thanks once again to the fantastic trader, yeahnatenelson!"
"This is not the best gueuze I've ever had, but it might be one of the most sour. The sour, tart, and the funk is remarkable. Cheers to all of the strains of bacteria that make this so weird."
"Overall: Nice depth of flavor and a good blend of wood and tartness. Easy drinking for the style, but still carries enough tartness to be worth it."
"Compared to the draft, bottle is a bit brighter, very light funk level to this, still. This is rather fresh, citrusy and hoppy notes are present. Faint sourness in the finish. Light cob web funk. The nose is about the same as draft and not as bright as the flavor in this one. Going to be develope well imo."

"O: This is a fine example of the style—it has a nice amount of funkiness and sourness—but neither of these is over the top, making this very drinkable."
"There is a substantial mouth coating tannic character on the palate, which may contribute to a fuller feeling mouthfeel. Carbonation level is appropriately high. Overall, an enjoyable gueuze that is probably a notch below the elite versions."

"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
"I liked this bottle and will be ordering another bottle next month. Perhaps I will get 2 and age one."
"Great gueuze. Aroma is exquisite, likely the standout quality for this beer. However it's a little lacking in the barnyard qualities - they are too soft - but the other aroma complexities make up for that shortcoming. Also, the aftertaste is quite acetic, actually taking away from the balance.  If the rating system had .25s, I'd likely use them across the board, as I had a difficult time rating this one."

"Bottle: Poured a clear bright golden color lambic with a super huge foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of light sour notes with light funky ester. Taste is also a mix between some sour and tart notes with light acidic undertones and some light funky ester. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well put together lambic mix except it may be a bit too balanced toward sour and acidic notes for my liking. I would have preferred more green apple and barnyard notes personally."
"Verdict: Exceptional gueuze from the Gueuzerie Tilquin. The flavors are exceptionally complex, the body is spot on, and it has just enough to sourness to satisfy any sour lover while being accessible to anyone looking to try a great gueuze."

"Pours a cloudy, straw yellow/light orange color with a bright white one-finger head. Goes quickly. Aroma of lemon zest, orange peel, sour apple a bit of barnyard funk and nice tart cherry and berry notes. Flavor begins with a nice amount of tart citrus. Lemon peel, green apples, tart berries and lesser sour cherry notes. Grass and slight earthiness in the middle before a middling funky, musty ending. Bubbly, light crisp mouthfeel. Overall, good flavor, not too tart, not too funky, great combination of the flavors that changes from sip to sip."

"O - This is a very tasty gueuze. Again, rather accessable for me. Love the green apple tartness. Very crisp and clean."
"O- a very nice gueze, however the oak notes can be a bit strange at times, hoping this one will improve a little with some age, although it is very pleasant to begin with. The only thing that stopped me from marking this higher was the strange oak bite."
""
"Overall, a really worthwhile and enjoyable gueuze. The fruit notes definitely what sets this apart from others. Drinking very nicely right now and definitely should age with the best of them. Definitely one I would pick up often at the price."
""
"Very well done, I'm very excited to see what new projects come our way from Tilquin."
""
""
"Overall - A great gueuze if not quite living up to its most impressive competitors. I'm glad I have a couple of bottles stashed away so I can partake of this whenever I want."
"This is a damn good Gueuze already, I can’t wait to have one that is a proper blend of 3, 2 and 1 year old Lambics. This definitely has me excited as this particular blend shows a lot of potential; it could use a more muted oak profile and the acidity might be a bit more rounded, but I really like the fruitiness and the funkiness, and even the oak and acidity. I can’t wait to get more vintages of this."

"o- i love this beer. i wish i could make myself pay around $11 bucks every couple of days for 12 oz of this beer. i can't, but i would love to buy again soon-ish."
""
"O - This is a very good gueuze. I may have to get some more."
"O - I have had this one three times now and it is really growing on me. It has quite a bit of flavor yet it remains easy to drink. I will have to stock up on this one when I see it."
"D: This was an excellent gueuze. Maybe I just haven't had one in a while, so I forgot how great they are. But this is hugely complex and delicate and bold. Great scent and taste, with refreshing and fitting body. Definitely needs to be sipped, but the finish is nice and clean. Age forever or drink whenever. Recommended."
"A terrific gueuze. I hope I can find this in a shop near me soon."

"This beer pours a light bodied and highly carbonated honey gold in color with slight turbidity and constant bubbling. The nose is on the funkier side even for a geueze. It has plenty of wild yeast, Brett going on as well as an ever so slight sweetness on the backed. The flavors are right up my alley. There are boatloads of very dry Brett, lemon, barnyard, sour apple, dehydrated fruit and it has moderate acidity. I'm a pretty big fan. It drinks light with plenty of carbonation and finishes dry with a slight pucker. This is a really nice Geueze. I'd place it behind only Cantillon's Classic Geueze and Hanssens Oude Geueze."

"The one thing I did very like was it was very crisp. Much more than any other beer I have tasted. As I mentioned above, about sparkling wine, it presented itself almost champagne like."
""
""
"O: I really solid beer all around! Pretty sure this was from a fresh batch, but I can't wait to age it a bit. I think it will surely hold up quite well over time. Very nice for sure!"
"Drink- Another one of those beers I always wanted to try and poof there it was at this tasting. Bobby thanks for sharing. Appreciate it very much. I would really like to sit and savor on a bottle of this one."
""
"Pours a murky light yellow with a white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sour citrus, funk, and some earthy aromas. Taste is very much the same. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and acidic mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good gueuze and I'm glad I got a chance to try this one."
"The beer pours a dark straw, orange color with minimal foam. Looks like a Gueuze. The aroma is a nice mixture of tart unripe green apples, lemon and vinegar. A little funk manages to penetrate as well. The flavor is very tart with apples, acidic and sour like a lemon, and dry as bone. The earthy funk, a combination of must and oak, raises its head toward the end, but it really plays second fiddle to the tartness and citrus. A nice blended Gueuze."
""

"O- Really impressive, nice and sour, funky, nice fruity notes, would definitely drink again."
""
"Overall this is a decent gueuze but not the best I have had. There isn't enough funk and it doesn't finish quite dry enough. It isn't bad though and I probably would get it again."
"Overall, this was a really nice beer. Very enjoyable and drinkable. Fits the style well."
""
""
"O: A very well balanced Gueuze - moderate amounts of sourness, oak, funk - everything works together to create a great flavor. Not as complex as some others, but it's certainly up there in my favorites."
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The only thing I would pick out to be improved is the finish. I could use more dryness. Light and refreshing, I would definitely have another."
"O: Ive had both in bottle and on draft, bottle is better in my opinion. Draft wasn't funky enough."
"Overall a good beer, better when I was in Brussels at a bar (but what beer isn't?). I am hesitant to purchase again given the price tag. Maybe grab a bottle and do a good sized gueuze tasting here in a few. Maybe a couple for the cellar, see how they mature."
""
""
""
"Overall: A great gueuze and one I will certainly have again! I wonder how the Lou Pepe Gueuze that I am drinking tomorrow will compare."
""
""
"This is very tasty. I will look for more."
"One of the best gueuzes out there. I have had the luck of tasting many greats, and this is their equal. Highest recommendation."
""
""
"O - This really is one of my favorite gueuzes. Cantillon tends to be bracingly sour and Drie Fonteinen is super funky. This beer fits neatly in the middle. Great balance and high level of drinkability. Excellent vintage."
""

"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, balances towards the acidic end but not overly in the vinegar world. Really nice brew!"
"Medium body with nice carbonation. Beautifully blended with great flavors. Definitely a fave for me."
""
""
""
"Smell is very enticing: sour wild yeast - acidic to the nose. Exciting aromatics, I like it. Thin layer of frothy head, with surprising head retention. Looks like a wheat beer with a good haze and yellow-orange hue. Flavor wise, you can't ask for much more in a traditional Gueuze. I can't believe I've never seen, or heard of this beer before as it is truly outstanding. Bright lemon citrus brettanomyces character - tart and puckering. Lingering subtle yeast flavors in the after taste. Mellow oakiness. Pleasant raw wheat body. Decent ABV for a lambic. Will certainly keep an eye out for this one in the future."
""
""
"This beer pours a nice straw yellow color with a thin white head that recedes rather quickly. the smell is tart lemony with hints of apple and a nice funk. the flavor starts off with a light funk, followed by a crisp tartness. the mouthfeel is light and well carbed, overall a superbly balanced gueuze"
"Taste is very nice. Starts off with a large wave of sour, which rounds out to show a good amount of sweet and sour lemon. Finishes tart and dry, with some great notes of brett in the background. Very well made gueuze. Too expensive, though."
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm enjoying the experience. It's a taste I can expect when I open a bottle."
"D - I preferred the draft version but this is good also."
"A bit more sour with a nice horsey funk throughout the beer. Great blend for a first commercial release, and I expect to see funkier ones as they begin to use older lambics. You can definitely taste the Cantillon lambic in this."
"Although this beer pours an impressive dense head and has a nice opaque golden hue the lack of lacing deminishes it slightly. Very good head retention though, especially for a gueuze. Leather, wet straw and lemon peels, not much more to say about the aroma. Its nice enough, actually rather nice, just not to complex. Wheat-y, slightly funky, some good old oak presence, big lemon citrus and grass character. Nice tart-sour finish. Pretty well balanced. Kinda of a puffy mouthfeel thanks to the good carbonation with a drying finish. Nice, I'd revisit this."
""
"D - Great stuff; one of the better Gueuze's out of Belgium; highly recommended to other Gueuze-lovers"

""
""
"into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish"

"Bright lemon flavors, orange undertones, moderatly sour, super flavorful and complex. Each sip is to be savored...nice effort here on a style that not easy to get right"
"Overall fantastic and solid."
"Medium bodied with a tart, puckering mouthfeel and a decent amount of sour funk and acidity. Lingering lactic funk with some sharp citrus acidity but it never becomes too harsh. Hints of oak, lemon/citrus peel and lingering acetic vinegar. A bit young at this stage but still delicate and flavorful."

"I'd love to aquire a bottle of this and let it ride for 10-15 years just to see how it develops. Definitely recommended."
""
"nice ambery-orangish with a white head that fades to a collar and leaves a little lace. nose is lemons, grape nerds, fruit loops, sweet tarts, citrus rind, must, funk and cobweb. taste is a fine balance of cheesy, goaty, funk with grapefruit rind and lemon. the sweet cereal and candy that i get in the nose is blended with the sour extremely well to create a really nice flavor. medium body. silky to me and just sharp enough. good finish with no improper aftertastes. just delicious, and for a first effort, what pierre tilquin shows us is straight yum. extra points for being so new to the game and creating a gueuze that will stand up to the best. can't wait to see what the future holds!"
"Overall a very good gueuze, great flavors and complexity."
"Poured a corked and caged 375ml into my Boulevard goblet. This beer pours a hazy golden straw with a rather surprisingly large head of a gueuze. A little bit of lacing was left down the sides of the glass. The aroma is bright citrus up front. Reminds me of lemon and grapefruit rind and pith. Grass with a bit of old lady closet. Fairly heavy on the must. The flavor is much the same with heavy citrus up front. Lots of lemon rind and cut grass. Just a hint of vinegar. Lots of must and damp earth. The mouthfeel is nice. Finishes dry but not as dry as some Gueuzes I've had. Overall, I'm pretty excited to have another blender in business. Especially if it means I'll have a traditional gueuze selection on my local shelves."
"The palate opens sharp and sour, with a blend of grapefruit, lemon and lactic sourness. There's a sharpness present that makes me think green apples as well. The mid-palate has a pretty solid grainy and wheat husk tannin character, drying out the palate and focusing the sourness. The funk is moderate, slightly whelmed by the sourness. Earthy on the finish with some dried mushrooms, there's a long lasting grapefruit pith sourness blended with some lactic sourness. Light in body but with a noticeable grainy heft that lends no sweetness and keeps this from being watery, this beer does feel a little full even. Highly carbonated (a little too much for my liking) and has a very tasty finish, and an hour in, when the carbonation dies down, the tannins do begin to take over, along with the Boon lambic. This is an excellent gueuze, and one I will drink more of. And when put in the context of it being Pierre's first commercial release that he had to ""rush out", it's even more impressive. Highly recommended."

"O: A very impressive gueuze. Not as dry as some of its more famous cousins, which I welcome, but well-crafted and well-rounded. Very flavorful and easy to drink. I'd probably offer this as a sort of ""gateway gueuze"" to the unfamiliar."

"Overall: A very unoffensive Gueuze. Not a bad place to start for a beginer to the Gueuze world."

"Overall an excellent oude gueuze!"

"Overall: A good gueuze. Very drinkable. Good funk."
"O: Top notch, for sure. 22 bucks for the 750, I think, but worthwhile for something whose complexity trumps even high-quality wines. An exemplar."

"Tilquin Gueuze has the look of olympic gold, with some yellow highlights. Not the clearest liquid so you cant see through it. A nice amount of active bubbles on top dyting quickly. Smell is barnyard written all over it, musk, hay, grass, and some earthy hop aroma. Scents of horseblanket come up, nice for a young from the bottle gueuze. Taste is weird, in a good sour funky way. Tart apple, pear, with mineral taste, hay, horseblanket and the like. Pretty funky. The feel is at a step up from light with active carb going for it. Spritzy on the mouth. I could do a whole bottle of this in a second. Im going to have to find a bottle of this to lay down for 10 years or so."
""
""
"Pours a straw yellow color, slightly hazy with a bone white crackling head and active carbonation evident. Aroma of musty. wet hay and sour lemon funk. In the taste, tart biting acidity upfront, with rind, mild bitterness and vinious qualities. Some lemon, grapefruit peel, wheat malt and brett notes. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, almost puckering, yet dry and mild. Overall, this is a finely blended gueuze, and a lively one at that."

"Overall a steal at the price and availability these days especially with no Cantillon. Excellent and recommended."
"O: I'm blown away. I love sours, and this just took me to another realm that I hadn't been to, and I'm much better for it."
"o - Overall a really great gueuze. Nose and taste are quite funky and has a good amount of citrus. Liked the taste a little more than the nose as I found it a little more funky, but both were great. Easy to drink the whole bottle of and will certainly have it again. Pretty on par with the draught verion; would order either anytime."
"375ml bottle Best Before 10/02/2021 which I guess means February 2nd 2021. Cloudy, hazy orange, wispy head with a surprising amount of lace. Smells like rotten oranges, citrus, wheat, straight gueuze! Taste is a little rough around the edges, sour, citrus, a bit of plastic, still delicious. I probably should have waited a couple months until this had been in the bottle a year but oh well. Impressive for a a new gueuze blender and one I'll be happy to add to my collection at any time."
"Overall: Impressive, especially as a first offering."
"Pours an opaque and fizzled sunglow orange. Spriteful carbonation is lively as the sudsy head fizzles away. Smells of citrus, earthy musk, and slight sourness - not super impressed with the nose, but it is inviting. Initial taste - woah - extreme bitterness and acidity shoot out of the gates, make their mark, and are quickly thereafter accompanied by orange and lemon zest, musky gym shirts, and shock tarts. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and the pleasantness of the flavor fades rather quickly. A very tasty beer however and is yet another gueuze offering that has impressed me with the style. Looking forward to getting more experience with the this unique craft."
"Very well balanced, possiibly a bit young."
"O- I love this Gueuze and can't wait to get more. As soon as the aroma hit me I knew I was in for a treat, and it did not disappoint!"
"very young but good. i am curious what age does to this. i can see it drying out a bit, maybe some more oak coming out."
"Hazy orange with a big, white head and plenty of lacing. Similar nose to the Girardin black label, though perhaps just a notch less. The flavor is of authentic Belgian gueuze lambic, though perhaps more raw and aggressive than is customary. Sharp and acetic , though not quite harsh. Lots of oak. Citrus notes are there as well. Acetic finish, light burn. Overall, a really enjoyable beer."
"Notes: I think this is a little more structured than the draft version that I had at Monk's Cafe a couple weeks ago. Hard to say which is better though... :) EDIT: Ok, according to my ratings...this version is better..."
"Taste is tart and light, lots of Brett, a nice slightly sweet finish. It's very easy drinking and has a crisp finish."
"Definitely very true to form and quite enjoyable. I'd love to grab a few more of these and see what age does to it."
"D - A worthy gueuze that I suspect I will be drinking plenty more of in the future. Future blends should only improve, with the addition of older lambic and more experience blending. It's quite easy to drink a 375ml on your own, although the acidity could prove challenging with larger serving sizes."
"This beer has reminded me why sour is the best 'style' of beer. It is so balanced while still maintaining a harsh, aggressive personality. Delicious and worth drinking every so often, regardless of the price. Probably one of the best gueuzes I've ever had. I can't wait to share this beer with others."
"O - Yumy Gueuze. Very refreshing and has some good subtle favors for a sour ale. Simple and delicious."
"Not as complex as Cantillon or 3F, but standing tall right now for a first batch. Time should also do this beer quite well."
"Medium body with appropriate carbonation (maybe leaning in the too-heavy direction at this young age), though it feels a bit chalky. Nice acidity. A very enjoyable blend. Like most, I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages."
"This really hit the spot. Satisfys the craving and then some. Top tier stuff worth stocking up on."
"D - this is a really solid Gueuze. Lots of really good flavors intertwined together - everything is balanced really well, not overly sour or too much funk. Highly recommended!"
"Pretty nice overall, I'll be picking up a few more bottles to cellar."
"I was looking forward to trying this, but it exceeded my expectations. The world is a better place with this new gueuze in it!"
"One of the better ones in our line up. I'd certainly like to have some more of this. Since its new this beer's full aging potential hasn't been explored, but its really nice when its relatively young."
"I'm excited to taste this gueuze in eight years - looking forward to trying the other work of this gueuzerie."
"This competes with the very best of them. Loved it."
"O - I must say, enjoyable. Restrained level of sour at first, more as it warms. Very good blend."
"Nice nose on this gueuze, horse blanket and funk, a little apple too. Very tart bite, more sour than others had led me to believe. Some citrus juice character, this evokes memories of Cantillon and 3F, very satisfying."
"O: Had this on tap earlier, basically the only differences are that this was a bit more funky, and carbonated a lot better. Both are very good."
"Drinkability: So begins my dedicate foray into the world of sours. My tongue feels like I just ate a bag of candy and has sever little bumps, my stomach is little upset, and yet I am please. Refreshing and interesting drink for certain. I bought two of these and the other one is disappearing into my cave for a few years."
"Overall -- Better than anticipated! In my mind, this is the mid-point between Cantillon Dre Fonteinen gueuzes. I would put Cantillon above it, but not by much."
"Very enjoyable gueuze, glad I picked up a bottle of this."
"Pours a cloudy yellow with a tad orange. A mostly white head crowns the beer and is slow to recede. When it does it leave behind a healthy dose of lacing. Smells of beautiful funk – mostly wild yeast dominate with a nice lemon citrus note adding to a wonderful nose. It is heavy enough to increase my anticipation. First sip is puckering sour that simultaneously hits in the front and middle of the mouth. Though it is fairly dry, there is just enough sweetness to think more age might increase the sourness. But I must say the sourness is quite desirable right now. Nice sour lemon and green apple flavors highlight this fine beer. Light carbonation tickles the tongue creating a very good mouthfeel. This is a great lambic and is worthy of being sought out by sour freaks."
"Overall a really nice gueuze. Typing this up I realize I'm not good at describing the flavors in this style. That said I really like this and think it compares favorably to others in the style. nice mix of funk and sour. I'll be interested to see how this ages but I have no problem drinking it as is."
"Very nice, I got to drink 3 of these (shared with others of course) in a 24 hour period. One big bottle left to share sometime years down the road. Should appeal to anyone who likes Cantillon's Classic Gueuze."
"Overall: A solid gueuze."
"Overall, a solid first effort from a promising new Gueuze blender. Not only does Tilquin carry an impressive resume, having worked at 3F & Cantillon, but also the only blender allowed to buy wort from Cantillon. Here's to a successful future for Gueuzerie Tilquin."
"Overall, a decent oude gueze, and a nice example of gueuzerie blending."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The 6% abv is integrated quite well. This brew is easy drinking and quite refreshing. It boasts a broad array of funky and sour character that was easily approachable. I look forward to opening another one of these with some age on it. My only gripe is that this offering was a bit more bitter than I am use to in the style. Regardless it was enjoyable."
"O-Very nice. Tastes young. Could be very interesting in a few years."
"One of my friends told me that this was good, so I figured I'd try it! 12.7 ounce caged and corked bottle, best before date of 15/02/2021, $9.99 a bottle. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like hay, lemon peel, sweet and tart apples, and some oak and funk. The tartness is noticable but not strong in the aroma. Luckily, the tartness really comes out in the flavor of this brew. It tastes like tart apples, lemon peel, hay, oak, and funk. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's dry and has decent carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I'll have to buy another bottle of this and age it for a while."
"Poured a nice straw color with a good white head that is a bit fizzy. A bit of lacing, though not a ton. The nose brings forward a good dosing of citrus. Not nearly as cheesy as the draft version. Good citrus flavor and light funk. Bright acidity. Light body and a dry, lightly-puckering finish. Really great for the first run, and something I was very glad to try."
"I went back and forth several times concerning which one I liked the best, this or the jonge lambic. The jonge was quite bright and acetic, this was probably more acidic overall and more oaky / funky in the back. This probably wins in the long run, a great little gueuze, very nice to try. I'd have it again."
"O - A little young but damn good, this beer'll be fantastic when it matures, picking up more nuances and subtlety as it goes. Candidly, it's hard to go wrong with a) a sour and b) a gueuze. Tilquin is gonna blow up like Hollywood with a beer this well-done young. Get it now while it lasts."
"O- Excellent balanced Gueuze with extreme dryness that doesnt throw off the brew and still maintains its balance."
"O: Nothing about this beer is overwhelming. Every element is complimentary to every other element. This is an expertly blended Gueze. I hauled it all the back from Belgium, and given another opportunity to do so, I’d fill up a whole suitcase with this godly nectar. 4.5"
"O: Shows good promise, subtle, unique, chalky"
"If you like funk this is a great one for it. Enjoyable as most good gueuzes I haves tried."
"O: This is a really nice gueuze. I would be happy to have this again."
"Thanks again, Bill!"
"O: I liked this. I’d put its flavor profile somewhere between Girardin and Cantillon, and while it could use more complexity, I think subsequent batches (or some age) will treat this well. Hopefully it comes into the US market at a good price... cause I’d gladly toss this into my normal line up with Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, De Cam, and Girardin."
"I sampled this next to a Girardin that was bottled within 6 months of the Tilquin, and the Girardin was the clear winner. I think it would be nice to do a side by side with all 4 of the lambics he uses to really get a feel."
"Leathery dry brettiness upfront in the taste. The sourness hits the back sides of my tongue and sort of lingers there after the finish. It's sharp and lemony. That being said I feel this is quite young. It needs the maturity of the 3 year old to create a stronger connection between the funk and the sour. Right now it's nothing remarkable and slightly better than middle of the road for me.. I will look forward to future batches."
"Overall: I am happy to see a new geuze blender in Beglium! It is even the first one in the French speaking part of Belgium. Their beer however, still lacks the complexity of Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen. Also I like the geuze more sour. A nice geuze to drink though"
