"Also it's a great deal around here. Underrated in my opinion - I won't say that about their other offerings."

"Overall meh, it has some decent gueuze characteristics, but that added syrup, sweetness, and lack of real nice funk and very nice lambic characters makes this a few steps down from any of the good Belgian gueuzes, as expected from what I had while at the brew pub."

"Pours darker than I expected, nice foamy white head, decent lacing. Smells and tastes much sweeter than I am used to for the style. Moderate amount of funk and a rather large amount of sourness. It is kinda flat and pretty sour, making it hard to consume more than a little bit at a time. The combo of sweet and sour just didn't work here for me. I enjoyed it for what it is but I wouldn't expect anything earth shattering here."

"Overall. A decent gueuze with some nice light flavour. Not on par with some of the better offerings out there but I would happily drink this often if it was inexpensive. I would prefer a little more carbonation as well."
"Cheers!"

"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lambic with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some good retention. Aroma consists of tart green apple with light lingering sweetness and minimal barnyard notes. Taste is also a mix of green apple and tart notes with light lingering sweetness; barnyard notes are pretty light. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad though lacking some complexity â€“ a definitive notch under their oude kriek."
"O: A respectable offering that is clearly the star of the Mort Subite line-up."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I must confess while I finished off this beer it was more out of a motivation to give it a fighting chance as it warmed up than out of enjoyment of the beer.. The honey and vanilla are more than a bit overdone here and it would be nice to have some more prominent lemon zest, etc. The sourness is also a bit overdone when the whole profile of the beer is considered. My overall impression of this beer is that while it was more or less ok, it falls short of the mark in a few ways."
"Notes: Based on the color, I expected this to have more caramel malt sweetness, but it's clean and citrusy. Definitely a surprise based on the ratings currently on here. If you see this, check it out!"
"This beer poured a clear, amber color with creamy, tall, white foam that persisted and settled slowly and clung to the glass. Good bubbles. The aroma was tart and acidic with some malt beneath. Tickles the nose. The flavor was mildly tart and sour with usual geuze flavor with a touch of fruit (lime). The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and moderate carbonation feel. The tart flavors lingered lightly on the palate. This was a good geuze."
"Well wortwhile, but by no means the best example out there."
"The palate opens a lot sourer than I was expecting. Big lactic sourness right up front, this is surprising, I can't think of too many gueuzes I've had that have leant this heavily on a lactic sourness. The sweetness that is mildly honey like does bring to mind granny smith apples and white grapes, making this in some ways resemble a berlinerweiss (particularly the New Glarus and Southampton versions). Citrus sourness is low, though there's a bit of lemon peel present. Funk is low, there's not really much discernible here. Finishing dry with a little tannin character, there's a noticeable sourness lingering on. The alcohol is pretty well hidden. As with the nose, there's a sharp, acetone-like character that grows as the beer warms, in some ways reminding me of some of Lost Abbeys more recent (and weaker) offerings. Medium-light in body with high carbonation, this beer is drying on the finish. While simple, this is quite enjoyable, though that acetone character does detract from the drinability. A 12.7oz bottle of that just might be a bit much."
"Bright and clear golden color. Smell has a strong belgian yeast characteristic which threw me off guard with the heavy lactic acid flavor. High carbonation with an average head. An enjoyable gueuze but the lactic acid over powers the flavor so it's not really complex."
"Drinkability is high if you can handle the heavy acidity. I love it, and thought it was a great gueuze. One of my favorites of my Belgian trip."
"This is pretty decent; there is something about the complexity, or lack thereof, that is a bit wanting, but I like that this is pretty decently sour."
"Taste is acidic and at first the beer makes a slight sweet impression. No, this is really acidic, can't get it down. A bit of farmhouse and flowers. A sharp sour that has something medicinal. Sorry, this is going down the drain after 2 sips."
"Overall - An excellent gueuze.... one of my favourites... Very refreshing and definitely worth a try if you can get it..."
"Awesome, I'll drink it again if I ever see it."
