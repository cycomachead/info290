Aroma is hay, funk, apple vinegar, and a bit of lemon. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, it's nice and tart and funky.

Enormously complex, as it warms it comes across with a light wheat or herbal like quality and just the tiniest amount of spice prickling the nose. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes of sour and biting vinegar flavor coming across on it right away. Light grapes and even a touch of wheat coming through mid palate, especially as it starts to warm. Mellow grassy flavors are mingling very well within the flavor now. \","mikesgroove","May 24, 2011"

Poured yellow-orange with a minimal slightly off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, funk, and cherries. The flavor was of swet malt, wood, funk, slight tart, very subtle mothballs, and cherries. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I wish I would have been able to read the last digit on the date to get an idea on the age of this one. Seemed fairly fresh though based on the flavors.

This is a reasonable gueuze but if you have a selection, opt for the Cantillon or Girardin.","gyllstromk","Jun 21, 2010"
4,1.3,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Flavor is decent, but not the best gueuze out there. Full of sharp tartness and citrus notes. Funk is great, but the whole flavor seems a little watered down or something. There's also an earhty, fresh cut grass characteristic that resides heavely in the aftertaste. The oak aging is also very noticable as there's definite wood notes. Light and crisp mouthfeel and high carbonation. Again, a nice gueuze, not the best.","ShadesOfGray","May 31, 2010"

The taste is moderately sour, but quite balanced. It's not the pucker-your-lips, eye-squintingly sour that I expected....it's very well balanced and quite drinkable.

Aroma is mostly citrus peel and lemony sour with an orangey sweetness to it. Huge citric acid. Flavor is not nearly as sour as the aroma. Some of the lemony tartness is definitely still there, but bretty funk is at least even with sourness/acidity in the overall profile. Earthy and saison-like at times. Nice dry finish. Kind of like a part-gueuze part-Orval blend. Interesting and tasty, could be a good intro-to-sours beer.","illidurit","Dec 18, 2008"

The taste intensifies the character of this Gueuze. On the palate, strong funk, earth, and bits of leather come to mind. It is pleasantly sour and very drinkable. Wonderful beer in my opinion.

The smell was acidic with loads of barnyard horse blanket due to the wondrous handiwork of the wild yeast and bacteria. The taste was cidery, tart, oaky, bone dry, and not quite as funky as the other Geuzes I've tasted before. Very refreshing, and a touch thicker than most blended lambics.

My frist 2 pouring attempts ended up with all head and no beer, so once the third chance came, I knew to pour more slowly. Still builds a massive head on the pour (and it actually keeps on growing even after a minute or so of setting the glass down). Bubbles are really fat in the head and it clings to the glass. Leaves great lacing. Acidity and funk are all there, but they aren't so forceful as to conceal the cracker-like wheat and the pale malts. Taste is tart to sour upfront while an odd, but pleasing, astringency washes over the rest of the tongue. Very dry, but, compared to some other geuzes, this has a good bit of residual sweetness. Not as harsh as I'd hoped this one to be. Mouthfeel is light, but it seems all the carbonation went to the head instead of staying in the body for a spritzier mouthfeel. Although maybe not as interesting as some others, the relative mellow character of this really lends itself well to high drinkabiliy. Overall, a fine lambic.","goochpunch","Apr 17, 2007"

The head is big and rocky and sustains well. Geuze smells are almost more impressive as the flavors and Boon's offers some nice fruity nose with sadly minimal funk....think very fresh and toned down Tallegio cheese and apples. The mouthfeel is great if not a bit too carbonated, you could put a few of these away fast...very little sweetness, intense sour or pungent funk like you might expect. This one isn't essential in any way IMO other than it's inobtrusive drinkability. I don't want my geuze to wash down light....I want it to kick my ass and this one doesn't. It's good, balanced and pleasant but it's not outstanding. The only unique element is a tad more hop flavor which is generally minimal in these dry-hopped beers. The Oud Beersel, Girardin and Drei Founteinen offer a lot more flavor and complex addicting taste. I respect the traditional and non cloying flavors of Boon's Kriek but this geuze is just too simple. I will admit I drank this after the Girardin which is mind-numblingly godly. This is a good summer geuze I reckon but serve it warm and let it open or the flavor will sneak past you before you can count your $5. I guess this brewer is also responsible for the recent Oud Beersel products which are the Marianne to Boon's Ginger.","ChampionJaguar","Oct 21, 2005"

This one's actually a little bit sweet, but it does have a nice vinous tartness and oakiness more towards the finish. Kind of fruity, like the skins of a Bosq pear. Not bad at all, especially if your looking for a gueuze that's not going to turn your tongue into the Sahara.

I bet the final gravity isn't above 1.005. Probably less. Very acidic and sour but with a pleasant sweet-like horsey/woody aftertaste that lingers under your tongue. Of course it is very very lightly sweet. Just barely perciptible. But after all the sourness it seems as if whatever sugar is in there is going to be noticeable. This beer is really complex and I like how the sourness makes the tiny bit of sweetness stand out...very subtle but delightful. A little to potent to have more than one unfortunately.

The aroma is tart and rather vinous with maybe a touch of tart apple fruitiness. The flavor also is, at once, very tart. The tartness overwhelms on the first sip, and is almost sour. Although not quite as harsh on subsequent sips, the tartness is present from start to finish. There is a very slight sweetness in the start, but it doesnt stand out for very long. Beyond the start, the sweetness becomes a very slight underlying hint of apple fruitiness. An oaky/woody nature seems to sneak out somewhere around the middle along with some slight vinous notes. There is a good amount of carbonation that is much like champagne. The mouthfeel is light-medium and is fairly dry throughout. The finish has a bit of a citric lemony note. I had this gueuze all by itself with nothing to accompany it, so the tart/sour nature of it was a bit harsh at times. This seems like a beer that should not be drunk on its own, but paired with food, so its drinkablility is hampered a bit.

Never fail, the palate is bombarded with a mildly astringent, sour flavor with a good bit of acidity. Never cloying, however, and notes of Granny Smith apples are evident along with a mildly spicy finish. Very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very lively, spritzy and carbonted, not dissimilar to champagne. An easily drinkable beverage, for sure, but not necessarily as solid as Cantillon's wonderful offering.

You have to be ready for this type of beer, for it's unlike anything else in the world. The wild yeast, the spontaneous fermentation. No wonder the lambic brewers are most successful when they introduce fruits to this incredibly demanding brew. Citrusy, sour, dry, medicinal, herbal, even a little vinegary. Texture is full, salty, body is medium, finish is quite lasting. Definitely takes some getting used to, but a solid, thirst quenching, even delectable beer.","feloniousmonk","Jan 22, 2003"

4.67,18.2,4.5,5,5,4,4,"This poured with a towering off-white head, over hazy gold liquid with some amber hightlights. Nose is intense, with notes of yeast, sour apples. Taste is very unique, almost Champagne-like in it's mouthfeel and flavors, with dry fruitiness, tartness and a refreshing sour quality that makes it wonderful to quaff. Finishes bone dry and very quenching...a beautiful thing!","beerluvr","Jan 01, 2003"

3.61,-8.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Opaque mustard brown color, early big champagne head that settles down quickly.  Sour aromas with some decided skunk-musk oil smells.  Characteristic sour notes with elements of raisins and cinnamon.  Not so astringent that you don't notice these secondary flavors.  Dries to a white wine-like finish at the back.  True enough to style, my rating hinges on the fact that its not as flamboyant in profile as Cantillon, nor as puckering.","ADR","Oct 04, 2002"
4.64,17.5,4,5,5,4,4,"Cloudy golden coloring with a thick white head that hangs in there. Smell is very fruity; the nose definitely indicates the tartness of the brew. Taste is quite tart, with characteristics of a dry white wine. This is, I think, the second gueuze I've had, and I was impressed. Certainly something to have when you feel like having something different.","doerickson","Sep 22, 2002"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A slightly sweeter gueuze. But still dry enough, refreshing tart qualties, obviously not as good as their Mariage Parfait Gueuze, but its pretty solid, this will appeal to a wider range of people.","rastaman","Jul 11, 2002"

4.34,9.9,3,4,5,4,4,"Sorry Brewguru but this is what the style is suppose to be. Highly carbonated and bracingly sour. The only bad thing you can say about it is that it doesn’t have quite the wild complexity of a Cantillion or a Hansons but still a knockout Gueuze.","mattmaples","Sep 12, 2001"
