"I know there are better, but it has no meaning, it is delicious. Recommend"

"Pale ale body with thin white head that doesn't quit.  Smell: big lambic funk, musty old house.  Meaty.  Flavor: cider, wheat, citrus, completely dry and bracingly acidic.  Light crisp, easy going carbonation and mouthfeel.  Amazing."
""
""
""
"One of only a few lambics that my palate cannot handle."
""

"Beautiful beer.  Stark white huge head, slightly murky golden.  Small bubbled lace.  Smell is sharp and funky.  Taste is close to perfect.  Sharp, fresh, clean, making you want another sip.  Mouthfeel is medium to light, good carb, great balance.  Overall, a beer I would have again and again."

"Beer poured from a 750ml, 7-8 year old bottle that I left at my sisters house and found Thanksgiving.  This was such a treat, just textbook execution of what a world class Belgium geuze should smell and taste like.  I had the chance to try a fresh bottle last month and it was like 2 different beers still nice but not world class.  I can not say enough about the older batch just stellar stuff."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 10/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, white vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, white vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding gueuze style! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Probably the worst beer(if you can call it ""beer"") I have ever had! Sour, no redeeming palate taste. I have had more beers than I could count and, even when they do not measure up, they are never a waste. This one was!"
""
"Poured a cloudy orange with a half finger frothy white head that quickly receded. It looks like most other Geuzes I've sampled, pretty nice. Scents of lemon juice, abundant sour yeast funk, bright acidity, straw hay, oak, sour green apple, white grape, low levels of grapefruit and indeterminate citrus, and a low level of what seems to be alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic Geuze aroma profile, with many of the regular aromas on display. A bit funkier and sour-dominated compared to other examples, which hurts the balance with the oak and fruit a bit. Dry in aroma overall, since malt and honey aromas are absent and fruit tends towards a sour variety. Still nice and appealing. Flavor begins highly sour with a funky, wild yeast character, straw, a bit of tangy wheat, a light bitterness from the hops, and a bit of lemon juice. Middle continues to be sour and acidic with lemon juice, oak, and sour yeasty funk being the principle flavors. A mild hop bitterness is also present. Finish is still sour and acidic and dry, with a very strong presence of sour, barnyard yeast funk, straw, a moderate level of oak, a mild lemon juice character and light hop bitterness. Aftertaste is tangy yeast, lemon juice, very light honey and wild, funky yeast. Overall impression of taste is of a highly sour Geuze that is very heavy towards the funky, yeasty, lemon and oak flavors. Other fruits are absent, as is honey, which hurts the overall flavor profile. It is a decent Geuze, but lacks the balance and depth of better examples. Hop bitterness is also a bit more discernible than in other examples, though hop flavor is absent, keeping to style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, with light carbonation and a drying, acidic feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is fairly true to style for a Geuze, though the carbonation is far to low, perhaps due to an older bottle. Overall this is a decent Geuze that is fairly refreshing and nicely sour in aroma and flavor. Perhaps a bit too sour however, a sourness overwhelms the flavor. The aroma fairs better, but could still use a bit more balance. Mouthfeel is good overall though and this isn't a bad Geuze, there are just far better examples."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A good gueuze with a darker body and lower carbonation than others.  What sets this apart from others in the style is a unique bretty ""savory"" note that appears in the aroma and taste.  Not bad, but unique.  Also sweeter and not as refreshing.  Still, I'll be buying this to try again, though it's not my number one choice."
""

"First Lambic style beer. Very unique flavor. Would liken to a sour champagne of sorts. Nice deep golden apricot color, nice foamy head upon pour. Very much enjoyed drinking this. Nice departure from the normal range of ale/ipa/lager/stout that one normally buys at the beer store ."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden straw color with an inch or so of foamy white head that dissipates quickly. Visible lacing lightly represented around the glass. Smells of Brett, barnyard, dry grass, hay. A slight detection of fruit is present as well. Tastes very tart, sour, slightly bitter on the finish. Although it's bitter on the finish it is a pleasant bitterness that compliments the tartness. Pretty awesome tasting gueuze, drinkable at 6%, and readily available. Makes this a home run!"
""
""
"Lightly hazy golden, moderate carb, slightly vegetal, juicy, plenty of nice citrus."
""
""
""
""
""
"Shining gold color with a loose collection of large bubbles for a head that fizzles away quickly.  Aroma opens with a funky acidity and musty wood, leading to some apple and earthiness.  Wet hay, organics, cherry, barnyard.  Flavor brings a bracing sourness, acetic wood, lemon acidity, apples, and dust.  Medium bodied, acidic, and puckering.  Great lingering gum-sucking sourness.  Tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent, straightforward sour, tending just to the ""tart"" side of ""sour"" (per my own scale).  The beer doesn't have too much depth, but that's not necessarily the point of a sour, in my mind.  Given that it's an import and a sour, I'd have to consider cost, but this is a definite once-in-a-while beer."
""
"Outstanding gueuze with a delicate, oily body; light but fluffy head that lingers for a bit before dissipating; and a zesty flavor profile of savory and slightly sweet, lemon-like flavors."

"Pours a hazy, copper/gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong sourness, strong yeast, hint of pale malt, hint of alcohol, hint of floral notes, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of a gueuze. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with a high carbonation level. There is also a strong tartness and sourness. Tastes of sourness, hint of pale malt, hint of alcohol, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good appearance, body, mouth feel, blend, and aroma."
""
"Pours a golden amber hue with a creamy ever present two finger head and lacing here and there, the smell is horse blanket, granny smith apples, a touch of vinegar and Brett, the feel is creamy, moderately carbonated and smooth with sour tastes of apples, grapes, musty funk and finished with a Brett funkiness and overall a great interpretation of the style that id buy again in a heartbeat."

"Overall: Someone unfamiliar with lambics will find this too abrasive - like if someone poured paint thinner into a very tart shandy. But lambic fans will love it - it hits all the notes, brings a bomb of sour flavor, and comes in that cool bottle."

"O: excellent sour, flavor is prominent, true to the style"
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a cloudy, golden amber color with a foamy head. The aroma is slightly sweet and yeasty. The taste is sweet with lots of sugar, slightly tart, and leaves a lingering bitter taste. This is very tasty and a decent lambic for the price. With a good full texture this a lambic that delivers."

"O: fantastic gueuze - just what I wanted - just what I dream of (for the most part)"
""
"O- big puckering notes on the aroma and taste, very good overall"
""
""
""
"Taste is candied lemon up front (like a lemonhead) with some lemon rind and other fruits including apple and grape. There is a funky base of earth, grass and oak but not as much as the smell would suggest. There is also a slightly metallic aftertaste. Very sour - the Hanssens seems to contain a higher amount of acetic acid than Cantillon or 3F Gueuze. It has a very vinegary taste and sensation I can feel in the back of my throat. I felt the same way about the Hanssens Oude Kriek; however, the gueuze is more drinkable than the kriek. There is a cloying sweetness, which in combination with the vinegar and the moderate, prickly carbonation made for a beer that is less drinkable than I was hoping. I love gueuze and this is not a bad beer for your gueuze fix. However, both 3F and Cantillon are much better."
"O - A great Geuze and well worth a try"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure of the vintage. Hazy, golden-orange pour, with a thin layer of white bubbles for a head, minimal lacing. In the nose, citrus and horseblankety Brett funk. In the taste, sour fruits, grassy funk, horseblanket, toasted grain, Champagne, with a crisp, dry finish. Gueuzey! Light-medium body, prickly carbonation. An enjoyable drink."
""
""
""
""
"O - Hanssens Oude Gueuze is one of the most varying beers I've encountered, ranging from absolutely stellar to pretty good with this particular bottle landing right in the middle. A great Gueuze with fantastic drinkability for a sour beer, this funky golden ale quenches both thirst and thirst for sour power!"

""
""
""

""

""
"This is a bold sour beer, one of the spiciest and sour I had. A must for sour heads."
""
"T: There isn't much carbonation, but it doesn't really seem to be a problem. Loads of funk and lemon acidity right away. Nice lingering tartness and funk throughout. Never really gets too sour, but this is a pleasant gueuze."
"O: it's a very sour beer. i am not a big fan but it works"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an okay gueuze. I can think of at least two off the top of my head that are better, easier to get and cheaper. And they come in the same single-serve bottle, so no need to buy in 750 mL bulk. Give me more of that Experimental Cassis over this one any day."

"Overall: super tasty, tart and refreshing. One of the sourest beers I've ever had, and it works to great effect here. Kudos!"
"overall this beer, is the STAPLE of what a gueuze should taste like"
""
"O: A nice flavorful geuze. I'm surprised that it's took me so long to finally review it."
""
"Overall - I really dig this and would love to have more to share."
""
""
""
""
"D) Exceptional balance and boasting great flavor. In contention for my favorite. Recommended."
""
"Color me impressed... While I do not believe this is a world-beater level gueuze (which, in all fairness, is one of the hardest leaderboards to climb), it's still pretty damn good, and it's even more appealing due to its (relatively) reasonable price-point and superb availability. Sometime to tide over your gueuze yearning after you drink your last Cantillon... don't pass this one up like I did."
""
""
"Softer carbonation and a fuller body for a gueuze."
""
""
""
"A very good shelf geuze that reminds me of a less intense Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Its not the most intensely flavourful geuze like 3F Oude Geuze, nor is it funky like Cantillon Classic. But it is readily available at a price point that is hard to argue with. I think I would prefer Tilquin's version at the same price point. However, if that isn't available, then this one is the one I would turn to."
"Overall: Quite enjoyable, although the appearance was a tad off-putting. Flavorful and fun, but with slightly too much sourness--other flavors could have come out, creating a rounder taste."
""
"A nice gueuze, but a bit one dimensional and not quite dry and carbonated enough."
""
""
""
"This was a fairly young bottle. I'd be really interested to see what it does with some age."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my perfect Gueuze. The yeast profile in this is beer great. Its funky. Its like sheep and hay in a bottle. Its smells like the farmland of Belgium. It takes you there with your nose and tongue. its perfectly lactic and sour; great light fruit flavors; sour apple, white grapes...similar to a fine white wine or champagne. Its a perfect palette cleanser with something rich (beef tenderloin, hooks 15 year cheddar, and this are my deathbed meal) or just great to drink with anything. anytime. in excess...if I could...mmm. if not this, then Giradin 1882 or boon marriage parfait...mmm"

"A delicious and very complex geuze, not the best I've ever had but certainly one of the most interesting and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a well crafted beer. The flavor fails to match the well balanced complexity of its' aroma, but still very good. A great bargain, this one is worth every penny."
""
"Overall: Just a wonderful brew. This is a style I really look forward to digging more into and really growing to love. The complexity found with this brew is absolutely elite. The tartness of this beer is perfectly done, this beer did not take very long to drink."

""

"D= This hits all of the right notes for an outstanding Geueze, but for some reason I found it lacking. I think the acetic/vinegar sourness was just a bit out of balance with the rest of the flavors. Still an outstanding beer, but this vintage was not as great as others I have had..."

"A delightful pop from the cork and this poured out sunshine golden straw color. Light and a bit cloudy. A voluptuous head of white foam that settled to a thin cap and collar and champagne effervescence. It’s heaven to look at. The nose is strong and delicious with yeast, brett funk, barnyard and hay, musty wood a bit of vinegar and sweet hint of white grape and citrus. Taste is mouth watering, juicy and sour. Lemon, plenty of earthy funk, sour with some pear and green apple. Malt is light grain. It’s simplicity on the palate and each sip has you asking for more. Nice dry finish and a little oak and vanilla in the aftertaste. This was a wild and refreshing gueuze."
""
""
""
"O-This is a great gueuze. The flavors are sweeter and less funky than some beers of this style and the feel is softer and more robust, all of which combine to make this beer a bit less harsh-feeling than some other gueuze, which helps the drinkability. That being said, this beer still has complexity and tartness that make this style so enjoyable."
""
"O: Sour beers are all supposed to taste the same, right? I mean, shouldn’t that intense lactic acidity just push everything to the same end? As it stands, this is the Belgian style in which I’ve seen the most variation: with tastes from heavy to crisp, bitter to sweet, and fruity to herbal, there seems to be an array of possibilities here. All I can hope is that they all turn out as good as this."
""
""
""
"a nice gueuze, but certainly not the best one out there, and I think this is probably a little overrated here on BA. it pours a faded orange color, well cloudy, and not holding onto much of its bubbly white head. the nose is sour and vinegar forward, with some straw-like malt and a spunky yeast character. the acidic sour element is the strongest part of the flavor, as it should be in a good gueuze, but I also pick up some light fruit here, tart berries or something, which gives the beer a little sweetness and a little weight beyond its middle of the road malt bill. the finish is very acidic, now more vinegar than conventional sour, which clashes with the sweetness. not as effervescently carbonated as I like for the style, but satisfying enough. also a little thicker than some, but that doesn't bother me with all the complexity here. overall this is a very well made version of the style, but it lacks some of the memorable features of the best ones, it also drags slightly in feel, which is supposed to be so bright here. probably not worth the money they charge for this, but a must have obviously for any gueuze-heads."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of the best sours I've ever had. I slightly prefer drie fonteinen but this one is right up there."
""
"The beer pours a clear golden color with a white head that fades quickly without lacing. The nose is a tad skunky at first, but mellows out and becomes a slightly sweet, funky, tartly gueuzey. The taste is quite potent with great grain, yeast, bacteria, and a touch of sweetness. Is definitely a gueuze that packs it in flavor and exceeds expectations. The mouthfeel is sweet and sour upfront with a lingering dryness that's slowly washed away by my quickly responding saliva (I wouldn't want tooth decay with all this acidity). This is a great beer with excellent price and availability."
""
""
""
""
"The body is bone dry allowing the sourness to come out. Some yeast into the finish cuts the finish. Some off yeast notes linger into the finish. Would have liked a bit more carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer. Love the big sour notes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like it. A little more apple cider than I really like, but certainly enjoyable. Tasty sour."
""
""
""
""
"A solid gueze, maybe not as good as 3fon or cantillion but pretty close. Buy this if you can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would really like to drink this beer again."
""
""
""
"O: There is a decent amount of complexity to the smell and the taste of this beer that only increases as the beer warms up. This beer is not too sour for the style so is pretty approachable even for folks new to the style. Just enough funkiness to keep it interesting. Relatively easy to drink, especially for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easydrinking beer. Great Gueuze specimen. Recommended"
"Overall- This is a damn fine geuze. I would get it more often, but it is slightly more expensive than Tilquin or even 3 Fontenine. This will be a nice treat every now and then."
""
""
""
"I could drink this every day."
""
"What a good experience!"
""
""
""

"Overall: A very nice Geuze, for those who like the style"
""
""
"O- A very nice gueuze, the flavors and especially the aroma are really great, this is probably one of the better readily-available gueuzes that we get here in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: light and airy."
""

"My first of this style so I am not sure what they are supposed to be like. However, I enjoyed this."

"Goes good with good music. Recommend saxophonist Mark Whitecage with this brew."
""
"O-delicious gueze with great flavor and balance"
"Perfect for a nice summer evening."
"Overall. A very fine gueuze. Really enjoying this one."
"All in all, stop reading this review! Go out and purchase this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A little pricey, but a nice gueuze for sure. Nice blend of fruit/sour/must. Would drink it again."
""
"Drinkability is high, it's a delicious beer. Classic gueuze, made to be highly drinkable and quenching, yet still offering depth of flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"750ml bottle. Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a frothy, off-white head, good lacing. Aroma is vinegar, wood, musty and grapefruit. Flavor is sour, acidic, vinegar, wood, earthy and citrus (grapefruit). Mouthfeel is light, sour, flat and a bit watery. Good beer."
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with a one and half finger bright white fizzy head. Superb retention and some splotchy lacing is left behind as the brew is consumed. The aroma has hard cider and champagne notes. Perfect level of tart and sour, fruit notes that resemble apple and pear peel as well very light citrus accents and grassy notes. Finishes dry and lip puckeringly sour. An elite top tier gueuze."
""
""
"M: Effervescent and dry as a bone, whets your palate for more"
""
""
"By far the funkiest aroma I have ever smelled from a beer. Bright tangy sourness with a serious musky funk. The acidity almost burns the throat. This was a joy to drink."
"O: Such a delicious sour beer; so seemingly simple and yet there is a beautiful complexity underneath"
"A solid Gueuze, but could be a touch more sour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good. Decently light but it still has some good flavors and a good fruitiness."
"Hanssens Oude Gueuze may not be the funkiest or most complex gueuze on the market, but it is still an enjoyable treat. This is an ideal beer to enjoy on a hot summer night."
""
""
"O: I am not very well versed in the style, in fact I believe this is only my second Gueuze (the other one being Girardin 1882), but look out wallet, I think Ive found something here!  This could be the start of a new obsession.  I love the huge tart/sour characteristics, which is what I also look for in Saisons and Wild Ales.  With only having tried a couple, the jury is still out, but if this beer is representative of gueuze's then they could quickly become one of my favorite styles.  "
"Mouthfeel is dry and smooth. Overall, I think it's pretty good. I like the Lindeman's Cuvee Rene better, though."
"It's tasty. Not all that complex, as the Brettanomyces doesn't hold up to the sourness here. But tasty. I'd never turn down a bottle of this gueuze, but I prefer a funkier beer."
""
"O- A solid gueuze that I will pick up again. Very sour."
"O- This was a good geuze, but not as good as some of the better sours I've had. It had a nice amount of sour, funk, and tart lemony flavor with a good feel. Not nearly as good as the Beatification that I had last night though. Overall not a bad beer, that I recommend picking out if you like geuzes. Not bad for the price + availability."
"Enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall I was not all the impressed with my first Gueuze. There was just not complexity for a beer that has been aging for so long."
"750 ml bottle. No date, but I suspect it was bottled fairly recently. Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves close to no lacing on the glass. The aroma has a strong minerally note, a slight sulfur note, and some light lemon. The initial taste has some sweetness with lemon, mineral, brett, and some light apple. The finish is tart with some brett. Medium body. Low carbonation. This was drank with 3F Oude Geuze and Cantillon Classic Geuze. This was the worst of the three, but was still enjoyable. It isn't quite as complex and has a bit more sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Most of time I like my sour beers with fruit, but I prefer this beer over Hanssens Oude Kriek. This beer is so solid it does not need the fruit which I really enjoy in sour beers. This is a really elegant gueuze! Not to mention its a great shelf beer. I would even put this on the same level as Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with moderately high carbonation that foams this up quickly on the palate. Resultant mouthfeel very quickly becomes smooth and somewhat creamy. Close is dry with a slight stickiness around the edges of the lips and a lingering acid burn in the throat that can actually be a bit unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
"I thought this was a decent gueuze but somewhat lacking in the funk/barnyard area. The sourness is quite puckering but I would have liked more funk. I would drink it again, though."
""
""
""
"O - The best of the bunch for sure. Where the Kriek and Raspberry fail, this one excels. Tone down the overly aggressive sourness and this one could be great. As it stands now, a solid gueuze that is definitely worth the lower than average price tag."
""
"Pours a murky honey orange with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. There is a small amount of sediment that is floating around in the glass after the pour. Small chunks of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely tart, sour, and funky with lots of wild, earthy, and woody aromas. Taste is much like the smell with some fruity flavors that I can't quite put my finger on. There is definitely a lemon-like presence I am picking up. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is the best Hanssens beer I have had so far and also the first one to have noticeable carbonation."
""
"Flavour: Tart- very tart. Reminds me quite a bit of crab apples. With such a little head as was present, could be mistaken for a tart cider rather than a beer. There is no discernible flavor of hops and little of malt; the lambic nature shines through without subtlety. Certainly a one-bottle and done variety or, were one open to suggestions, a superior digestif."
""
""
""
""
"O- I really enjoy this beer and it has always been one of my go-to gueuze that I can always find at a decent price."
""
""
"O: After reviewing 3F Oude Geuze a couple days ago, this seems to be on the opposite end of the spectrum. Very sour and not terribly complex. Certainly not bad, but not great."
""
""
"This is a fine gueuze that is easy to drink without a ton of funk or sourness to overwhelm. Solid on all fronts."
""
""
""
""
"Quite an excellent beer though I prefer the more funkified takes on this style. Definitely recommend."
""
""
""
"Remarkable clarity with a light orange color. Thin white head around rim on glass. Decent carbonation going. Smells softer than other examples of Oude Gueuze I've had. Very floral with hints of fruit from yeast and bacteria. Slight grass or hay quality as well. Very pleasant and appealing smell. Taste and mouthfeels is quite mild for Hanssens standards. Not to downplay it, I really like it. Solid wild microbe character. Oakiness blends in nicely. Light bitterness is suiting. Tart, thin body from thorough fermentation. Lingering acidity. Flavors really change as I sip on as my palates adjusts. Eventually some wheat flavors stand out. Highly drinkable sour beer."
""
""
"O - Just a great beer overall. Great flavor profile."
""
"Overall: Not the most complex gueuze out there, but man did it hit the spot after a long hot day! I am hard pressed to think of a beer that I have had that has been more satisfying than this! Delicious and refreshing, I will have to get another bottle or two!"

"O: A pretty decent gueuze, though a bit on the acetic side for me. I think I would prefer it out of the bottle with carbonation, though."
"At least that's what happened with me. I thought it was pretty good."
""
""
"Pours a deep orange color, with a nice one finger off white head. The head lasts forever on this beer. Very hazy and murky in appearance. The nose is flippin' amazing! So much funk, it's ridiculously good. Funk, apple, peach, and quite a bit of acidity out front here. Wow. Taste is very sharp, with lots of acidity, tartness, funk and bruised fruit. Big time peach in the taste. Feel is very tart and acidic, with great carbonation and a tart/dry finish. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Perfect for sharing. I will definitely buy this again. Cheers!"

"Very solid gueuze. Clean flavors and distinct sourness left my mouth puckering and dry."

"Overall: I wonder if I just got this one at a weird time in its life. No bottling data, so I don't know. Sort of sharp, and not integrated like some of the better ones. Gets your sour fix though."

"O: The only thing that takes away from this brew is the odd burnt characteristic. Not my favorite Belgian sour by a mile, but it's highly available, ergo high five."
""
""
"It's just fine, just not even sniffin close to the Cantillon Gueuze."
""
""
"Overall - It's a gueuze, so it's still good stuff. Not the best, but as it's one of the only lambics available to me, I'm going to drink it."
""
"This beer is a bright golden color. No head at all. Can't see any carbonation in the glass. Aroma is extremely funky with some sour acetic tartness, lemon rind and cobwebs. The taste is nice and funky with a great balance of vinegar sour and acetic sour. Lemons and apples and funk dominate the taste which is fine with me. Very light. Slightly undercarbonated, but otherwise great. Overall this is a damn good example of the style. Love this beer."

"I opened up my bottle of Hanssenn;s Oude Gueuze a few months ago to share with friends and never really got around to reviewing it. What I have been doing in the mean time is hunting down a local store where I can get another 750mL bottle. As far as Gueuzes go, this is my favorite. The flavors are just so complex and mouth puckering and the smell is really like no other type of beer. As far as price goes, it more expensive than something like a Lindemans Cuvee Renee but the quality is just so much much better and I'd much rather spend the extra $6-7 for this. So far this is my favorite Gueuze but I'm constantly on the hunt for more."

"O: Overall a deliciously more-tart-than-normal kind of gueuze. What it lacks in complexity, it makes up for in boldness and authenticity. Really glad I picked this up."
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is definitely a sipping beer, not because of the ABV, but because more that a sip at once makes one feel that the flavors may be overwhelming. This is a one glass a night beer because of the intensity of flavors. My overall impression is that this is definitely a world class beer with lots of complexity in the flavor and aroma and that rivals any of the best gueuze I’ve tried to date. I’ll definitely be having more of it."

"O - A great lambic. Funky and vinegary. Love its subtle grape tartness and honey sweet backbone. Will probably drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really impressive. The kriek on Firkin scared me away for a while, but this is a good gueuze!"

"Overall – I’ve passed over this at the store because of knowing this brand normally is not the “best”. I will pick a couple up now to age."
"A really tasty gueuze I'd be happy to drink again any day."
"Worthwhile; always."
"Overall: Not a Cantillon or 3F, but definitely a solid substitute. Lots of complexity in the aroma and flavor. Definitely scratched my sour itch-- I recommend you give it a shot!"
"Flavor offers a nice and lingering fruity tartness, crisp and with a long finish. Medium body and with a light but balanced carbonation. Not bad but not great, yet this brew easily beats out Oude Beersel and Doesjel for the crown tonight."
"The aroma is amazing: citrus, sourness, tartness and tons of earthy tones. There is funk here too. The waves of aroma foretell complexity and invite the drinker in. It evolves into a little more cellar funk as it warms. Leather, cherry, cellar and lemon all explosively mix to produce funky goodness on the palate. The intensity of this brew would shock even the most lethargic palate to life. Fruit, tart and sour again and again. The acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it alive, begging for more. Sour cherry and green apple mix with funky undertones to produce a really impressive beer. The palate is dry and refreshed. There is lots of complexity and depth here. A wondrous thing."
"O: It was pleasant, but not on the same level of other Gueuze I had in the past. I really think the age might have been the problem here, even though I know most gueuze age well, but maybe not in the cask."
"A more fruity and tart gueuze with highlights of green apple. Some interesting funk on the tongue. A solid gueuze. It's sharp acidic flavors make it a good candidate to replace Cantillon Classic Gueuze in this Cantillon drought we are having right now."
"O: Damn that's good! If only the appearance was better! I really enjoyed this and could drink it any day of the week."
"A minimal white head upon pouring that dissipates quickly. A deep golden color with the slightest haze. No bubble activity but still inviting. A strong aroma of fruit and funk. The flavor follows with an intense tart and sour kick. It hits hard and lingers nicely. The carbonation was quite low and it had a silky smooth feel. This is a very interesting beer with a lot of character and a burst of flavor."
"O: This was the first gueuze that really hit me hard. And wow, did I like it. Its amazing how tart it is. Allow the beer to warm a bit to get a dryer, funkier taste that is a bit more balanced than when it's cold."
"Overall, this beer was very, very cool. I love Pinot Noir, so this beer, in some weird way, kind of reminded me of that. It was the stunning and super food-friendly acidity and bright cherry aroma. Really awesome, but something that requires food and would be best on a special occasion!"
"This one grips the tongue and palate, grabs hold, delivers what is an unusual deliciousness, a long, and quite refreshing finish, and a flavor experience not found anywhere else in the world of beer."
"Drinking this beer, it really feels to be on the farm :-)"
"D - Pretty solid Gueuze here. It has a unique character to it with a bit of vinegar in it. It is sour but not as sour as others i have tried (think Cantillon or 3F). Definitely worth a shot, though, especially to give a new perspective on the style."
"Overall: Despite the unique flavor and aroma, the mouthfeel really detracts from the beer. A lot of liveliness is lost in the long run, and really makes drinking the beer less enjoyable. Still, it's a solid take on the style and definitely worth trying."
"Overall with cask like and feel and total lambic goodness, this is one gueze that feels like drinking some really good red wine vinegar. This one is real powerful."
"D: give me more. More, I say! A fantastic brew start to finish, and my favorite sour to date. <3 Hanssens!"
"Overall on of my favorite lambics available and if it werent so expensive I would drink it regularly."
"25oz corked and caged. Opens with a fierce pop. Pours a pale golden color with a good deal of white foam. Lace is left down the glass. Aroma is musty, funky, barnyard like and a little sour smelling. In the taste, a very nice sour wild yeast flavor, biting lemon peel, sharp acidity and a lingering sour finish leaving a dry pucker. Full citrusy lactic sour, some oaky tannins are present too making for a very complex Gueuze. Medium to light bodied feel, semi dry. Overall, drinking this beer is an experience not to be missed. An excellent example of the style."
"O-This is what I think of when I crave a gueuze. A great example of the style that is available pretty much all the time."
"O – This is a perfect example of the style I think. Although this is beer is rather young, purchased last week, its still a very tasty and refreshing beer. I think I will pick up a few more and age them and open one up every year till they are all gone. At $10 a pop I can afford to do that."
"O - This is a very acidic and intense gueze. Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen both bring the funk, but they do so in a much classier and elegant way. Perhaps its due to its freshness, but this is extremely tart and acidic at this point. Load of sour apple and lemons. I'm sure with some more age it smooths out a bit into something that can compete with the big guys. A fantastic beer."
"Incredibly refreshing overall, and just a superb example of the style."
"Pours golden orange with a super small white head that doesn't stick around long. Has kind of a sulfer smell up front with a small amount of earthy funk coming through. Taste is sour but not overwhelming silght fruit and funk coming in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel and carbonation are pretty spot on for the style. Overall a good beer for the price but no cantillon."
"O - Delicious and refreshing, perfect for a summer day on the back porch. I could drink several of these and still not get tired of the sour attack and the complexity behind it."
"Overall: Never has something this puckering and sour before. it's like biting into a lemon."
"O- One of the best Gueuzes out there, PERIOD."
"Overall this was an awesome beer, and I hope to score some soon. I know it is usually cheap but it's not seen around Ohio all that often."
"The aroma was strong, pungent and very sour. Ahh the lovely aroma of Brett in full force here. Pungent aromas of grapes just all over this one. A nice fruity vibe as it warms, with hints of peaches, and apples, light fruit in general were all lying deep underneath, however the real story was the gorgeous amounts of sour notes that were all over this one. Really quite beautiful. The flavor followed along perfectly. With a light airy body, this was an ideal beer for the evening."
"O- Definitely good. Only thing that lacked for me was carbonation, but that could have been my glassware choice. Don't normally see this around the stores I frequent, so if I had a chance to purchase again, I DEFINITELY would."
"O: Very impressed with this one. For 10 bucks, this is a wonderful Gueuze to have every so often and I'll be sure to grab some more."
"Overall, this was my favorite of a number of excellent beers last night. I really wanted another glass, but I also wanted to try other things. I plan to crack a bottle of this in the cellar for comparison."
"An extremely good gueuze, but the very high acidity makes this one an aggressive gueuze. I'm really glad I finally got to try this. And for $16.99 a bottle I think this is a fair deal, especially when compared to its Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen counterparts."
"Overall, this is a very nice and sour gueuze. Nice dry finish. Quite enjoyable."
"O: A good offering. Vinegar, funk and fruit dominate."
"O: very tart, this is helping me to like gueuzes more."
"D - Did I mention this is sour? Awesome stuff; not bad for my first dabble into Gueuze style beers; if most of them are like these I can't wait to try another; just thinking of this makes my mouth feel like i ate a bunch of sour patch kids candies; those with a weak tolerance to very sour and active profiled beers, you are being warned!"
"What more can be said about these beers. Time-tested and (in my opinion) one of the best styles of beer on the planet. Good stuff."
"s a blend of wet hay and barnyard. The palate opens with a surprising vinegar bite, bright, fruity and acidity with wet hay wet dog and a moderate lactic, juicy character. A little too intense, with a bit more acetic char than i'd like, and more acetic character than most gueuzes should (and do) have. Decent. Medium light in body mildly carbonated with a vinegary, oaky finish, this was a rare treat, albeit not the experience I was hoping for."
"O- I think this is one beer that doesn't benefit from being on cask. The sour character is to sharp in the aftertaste an the alcohol burn on enhances that. There is no a lot of depth of flavors but the cheese rind brett notes are really pronounced."
"Overall Impression- Gueuze! Wow! What a treat. I don't care how much this one costs, I'm looking for this one high and low. Such a great sour, it reminds of my first Gueuze with my cousin Mark but much, much better and now I can really appreciate this style. While it is tougher to drink because of the goaty/barnyard tastes, it is enjoyed sip by sip. Would love to push someone onto this style, but may be tough for some to understand how this could actually be a beer!"
"Overall: I really enjoyed this one, especially out on the deck on a summer day. Refreshing and has a nice balance."
"Truly a Gueuze for connoisseur's and probably one of my favorite sours."
"Bottle poured into a large tulip. This is an extremely fizzy and cloudy golden orange liquid. Smell is full of blue cheese-like funkiness, with lots of lemon and sour citrus. Taste is bitingly sour and tart with strong astringent lemon flavors. Very tasty and drinkable, but maybe not the most intense gueuze I've tried. Still, very good."
"Bottle. Opens with a nice little pop and poured into a tulip glass. Clear, medium amber orange color with a white collared head. Lemon, grape, slight funk in the aroma. Starts with a white wine grape sweetness that then transitions to a lemon zest like note. Building sourness. Ends wtih a slightly funky finish. Light mouthfeel. Nice carbonation. Overall, decent but not sure it is worth the price."
"O- well its super interesting and wild as all get out but so damn funky and rotty that you lose some of the subtle complexity of the bottled version."
"I thought this one would go down easier, I stepped myself up and was ready for this after having a berliner weisse to start off the day, then a lambic. I thought I was ready to tackle this one but it left me humbled and reaching for water to quench my thirst. I had this brew from a bottle before and this cask experience was a completely new beast. Color me impressed but at the same time quite confused. It could have benefited a bit from even a slight amount of carbonation but that was completely absent. Regardless, not bad and worth a try."
"Pours a clean and clear, near headless golden oranage, one of the darker tints ive seen from the style. Scent is musty baryard, damp wood and muddy earth forward, sour notes and a suprisingly bold fresh grain/malt presence. Taste is earthy, without being overly funky, muddy earth and damp wood present in quantity, lightly sour and puckering at serving temperature (cask remember) and stronger as it approached full room temp - really becomes a puckering being later on. The grain profile is heavier then many in the style. Limited cask carbonation here, beer comes across as medium and the sourness lingers on the palate. A nice find in cask, maybe not my prefered method to serve the style, but a good beer."
"Overall, this beer flattened me on the nose and backed off just enough to be a bit better than good in the mouth. Really a remarkable sourness lingering here. Earlier tonight I had a Kuhnhenn 4D and I can't imagine two brews more different. I guess that illustrates how versatile these few ingredients can be."
"O - I have to admit it has become difficult to guzzle the second half of this pint, due to the oft-mentioned sourness (and the fact that I just had a few glasses of LP Kriek); it is a very delicious brew, however."
"The appearance and mouthfeel are just okay, but this beer really excels in terms of aroma and flavor. Smells fantastic, tastes fantastic, what more can you ask for?"
"Almost a drain pour, but I did finish it. The flavors weren't bad, just not ample enough for me."
"O/D - What I consider a great Gueuze. Really refreshing and a nice fruity taste. The sourness is there to punch as well."
"O - This has great drinkability. It is crisp, smooth, and it tastes awesome. Overall, I thought this was an awesome beer. It is my first gueuze, but I am looking forward to having many more. I recommend giving this a shot. I would buy it again."
"Overall I’m not sure that I prefer styles such as this out of a cask as much as I would out of the bottle, but I’ll sure keep trying to see whether I can pin that opinion down or not. A solid beer that’s worth a shot."
"750ml bottle poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Nice light golden color with minimal off-white head. Looks like a Gueuze. Smells very funky and a musky, but in a very good way. Very tart and sour in the nose. Taste is not very sour or tart and that is a bit disappointing, but the flavor is great. Funky with bits of horseblanket (no, I do not use this term legitimately). Classic Gueuze in flavor and I am certainly enjoying it. Mouthfeel is a little thick with lower carbonation. Recommended."
"Pours a very hazy, golden-orange color with a very small white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is...DEAR GOD...that's some funk right there. I could smell it the second i popped the cork. When nose i held up to glass, I get a TON of lemon and zesty aromas with some heavy oak and faint hoppiness. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is just as great. At first I get tart lemon flavors that are quickly followed by hops and oak. Some lovely oak and peach flavors in this beer. Nice funky aftertaste. Damn tasty beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and dry. Not the most dry gueuze I've head, but nicely dry and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome beer. I need to definitely go pick some more of this up to age. On a side note, this beer reminds me of a much less hoppy Le Terrior from New Belgium."
"The beer is hazy and light orange hued, with an inch of white head that fades to nothing after a few moments. The aroma is of authentic Belgian gueuze: funk, straw, farmyard, light citrus. The taste is very pleasant, with a subtle biting sharpness in the finish. The acetic feel in the back end is more prominent here than in some of my favorite gueuzes. Overall, a solid example of the style, and definitely worth a try."
"This beer was my official public introduction to old gueuze in Belgium, much to the surprise of my local owner/bartender. It looked fantastic, poured out of an old bottle with mold on the label, I knew it was going to be an experience. The smell was citris and age, and once I poured it into my mouth the first thing I said when I slammed down the glass on the split wood bar was, ""holy sh*t!"" which I can imagine even the Belgians know since all their television shows have English subtitles. The sourness hits you like a truck, and it's all uphill from there. Nice citrus and a cloying (not even sure I know what that term means) feeling that is unique. Not my particular cup of tea, but a great experience I'll remember forever. Try it!"
"D: Sets the standard for gueuze. Had no idea that they offered this on cask until a bartender told me about it a week prior to tapping. Awesome stuff, definitely recommended"
"O: This is one of the best gueuzes around. World class and worth seeking out."
"O: This was one of my few gueze experiences, but it was a great one. I had this in bottle format not 3 nights later and it was still an amazing brew."
"Overall great, great fruit and sour flavors, nice wild funk, dry finish, keeps you coming back for more."
"This is an effort that was well worth the three years of labor needed to reach this state. A great, not over the top gueuze that is bound to turn some heads."
"D - I had two glasses, and other than the fact that my stomach was melting by the end I would have had more. Too expensive in the US for drinking all night, but if this was at a Belgian bar for a few euros I'd definitely indulge."
"Dry, very well balanced sourness and funk. This is very well done overall, and a great geuze to boot, especially for one that seems to be fairly readily available. It comes very close to some the 3F geuzes that I have tasted in terms of complexity and well-roundedness, and I would gladly revisit it again."
"O - This is a very tasty gueuze. What it lacked in appearance, it delivered big time in aroma and flavor."
"This first gueuze experience (Drie Fonteinen Doesjel ) wasn't so great so I'm hoping this is better. This beer pours a cloudy bright copper in color with a light, white lacing around the glass. It smells of fermented peaches, has some funk but what I would describe as a lot, and also features a mild tartness, and light alcohol. The flavors are much better than in my first gueuze experience. You actually get some fruit. It instantly bites your tongue with peach skin like tartness. It's almost the perfect amount of sour. It has light funk and wasn't heavy on sediment whatsoever. Perhaps the biggest difference is the mouthfeel. It has a nice crisp bite to it. I really like it. I'm glad I tried this so it gives me better prospective on the style. Now, on to the next one."
"orange and amber color, slightly golden. light carbonation almost disappears by the end of the glass. smell is funky, like blue cheese and feet. sort of unpleasant but dead on for the style. clean and refreshing flavor. crisp, dry and very sour. mouthwatering with little mouthcoat. overall, a very good gueuze and one of my new favorites."
"-Cheers"
"Mouthfeel is crisp but not as dry as some. Overall, an excellent queuze that comes across as a bit more well balanced than many others."
"D-overall, this is a weak gueuze, but not a terrible one. it isn't a pain to finish, but its not something i'm likely to purchase again. it'll fill any temporary sour desires though."
"Sourness clenches your jaw but it doesn't come off as very sour. Lemony vinegar component with a dry bretty finish of leather and hay, maybe even some tobacco. It's not a bitter brett finish though. The acidity wipes your palate. It hits on your salt sensors. Carbonation is fairly light. This is probably the easiest Hanssens lambics to take down by yourself. Lots of raw funk, not an over powering acidity."
"Overall: Excellent taste with a good level of sourness. I will buy this one again."
"D: a nice gueuze sipper. i mostly get sour, tart flavors from this one but i am still very new to this style. bring on the funky shit!"
"O: Another fantastic representation of the style. Full on sour power in this one."
"D: not my favorite Gueze experience so far, and though I've definitely had more drinkable Guezes, or at least ones I prefer, I'm also new to this style I feel it's important to hold off passing judgement until I've accustomed my palate to these beers. What I will say though is that this beer gave me heartburn."
"This was my first foray into Geuze and I did not know what to expect. The smell almost scared me but it tastes damn fine. Very happy to have tried this and looking forward to more."
"Unsure of the ABV, but I'm sure it's reasonable."
"Edit: I had this beer again recently beside 3F, tilquin, cantillon, and Oude Beersel and hanssens was my hands down favorite. I plan on acquiring more bottles of as many gueuzes as possible and do a blind tasting with friends to see if that had anything to do with it."
"D - Really good, but it's not quite at that ""craveable"" level that I get from some of the top-tier Gueuzes like Cantillion 100% Lambic and Girardin 1882. Still quite tasty, I'd never turn this one down."
"A very nice beer."
"Simply put, this is a MUST TRY!"
"I'm not particularly experienced with sours, as this is the first authentic gueuze I've had (the other being Lindeman's regular gueuze). It's very good, but I'm having trouble picking out certain flavors; this beer seems a bit lacking in complexity. Also, I don't really know how well it stacks up against other examples of the style. Still, I can tell how much I like this beer, and that is quite a bit. Recommended, especially for fans of the style."
"An excellent Gueuze that is a perfect showcase for the rounded tartness of lactic acid. No harsh acetic acid and very little funky brett notes. Very balanced."
"D: One of the best widely available geyser that I've come across, this one is well worth the price. Super funky, tart, and complex. Will likely age gracefully for years to come. Worth picking up a few bottles to cellar."
"This is a gueuze I've never heard hyped, but I think it's one of the best I've had. Great surprise, need to track down some more of these..."
"Drinkability - Moderate, due to sourness/acidity. Nice sour, but I think I prefer the Cuvee Rene..."
"This is one of my favorites! Near perfection."
"Sour apple. Pretty sour. Makes you salivate. Followed by earthy funk and barnyard spiciness. Still sour. This is the one Hanssens beer I have sampled that had carbonation. Thank god. I really enjoy it, but it's on the end of almost being too sour for me. Mouth puckering. Complex. Nearing a vinegar aftertaste. I got a bit of heartburn after drinking it."
"D- Tasty very balanced Gueuze."
"this was good, quite good. really great flavor through out. i plan on buying a bunch more."
"Really very good."
"D: a solid gueuze that was very tasty and drank better than expected. Great offering from the hanssen blenders."
"Very crisp, no real body, great finish. For the style, very approachable. Could be used as a great intro into the style. Great."
"D- high drinkability with the amount of sourness and acidic notes but that is why i liked it... this is a great gueuze"
"I'm not really sure I can elaborate any better than the couple hundred folks who've gone before me.. I've had some awesome beers lately and this damn near the top.. Funky as hell and delicious, its probably the best gueuze I've had yet..."
"D- Good drinkability. Splitting a 375 was about right. Could have soloed it, but might have gotten tired of the powerful tart. A solid gueuze."
"D - High, for something this vinegary and funky. Dryness is keeping it from being 5/5. This also stays on your palate for awhile."
"Opened the bottle and there was a subtle whoosh not the pop I was expecting. It pours a beautiful straw color with a small white head. Retention is decent for the head being so small. There is a tiny bit of lacing. Wafts of yeast, funk (barnyard), and tart fruit hit the nose. Great. The taste is very tart and dry with some apple and citrus sourness that lingers on and on. It just beckons you to take another sip, extremely inviting. The mouthfeel is a little thin due to the lack of carbonation, but it still holds up well. Overall I think this is an excellent example of the style, refreshing and satisfying."
"Drinkability: Not going to lie, there is no way I could come close to drinking this all night. Smells/flavors are just too intense. However, I found it tasty in a mouth puckering way. I would love to try more of this style. I don't think there any way I will ever be a sour lover, but it's a decent start."
"Piquant, refreshing and flavorful, this is a very interesting beer."
"Wow. An excellent example of the style. It took my taste buds ona ride they surely won't forget. Worth a try."
"Bang-for-buck, Hanssen's artissinal smokes Cantillon any day of the week. Sorry."
"d- moderately drinkable, very complex, i wish i was more experienced with this style, but i know this one is quality."
"This gueuze packs quite the kick. As usual with Hanssens, acidity and funk are sharp and intense on the nose; it's leathery, dusty, a bit mineral. There's a touch of oak on the palate, but it's overwhelmed by sharp lactic acidity. It's faintly metallic, very funky and musty, with a berry-like fruitiness. Lemon-like acidity lingers in the finish. A very solid gueuze."
"The carbonation really helps on this one, and it's very drinkable for the style. Excellent stuff. Always a go-to for me."
"Thanks to my brother Andy for sharing this one with me. Poured into a chalice. The body is a light slightly hazy golden color with just a thin layer of bubbly white head and lots of visible carbonation. No real retention and just a thin ring of lace. The smell is tart apples, barnyard, yeast and slight vinegar. The taste is tart and slightly sweet apples with a bit of must and vinegar to the tart finish. The mouthfeel is light with ample carbonation and the drinkability is great on this light easy drinking beer."
"drinkability: good"
"True, this isn't a beer for wimps or neophytes, but it is one of the great ones."
"Drinkability -- Quite enjoyable. Great depth, very engaging, but still very balanced and approachable. Not to imply this an entry-level gueuze (such a thing exists?), but this would be a pretty sensible place to start for someone interested in the style. Must-try."
"edit: older vintages have much better head, retention and lace and become very grapefruity funky. grapefruit hits the back of the palate and tastes more like real grapefruit than any taste i've ever tasted in beer. awesome. bumping my appearance score to 5 because the last bottle i poured just had the best head/lace of any geuze i've poured. and bumping taste because i now see how epic this one is with some age on it, and because it truly is exceptional."
"A style that I love, but this is a bit of a let down for me. There is a huge acidic sourness, and not much else. I really do love the sour, but a great Gueuze has so much more depth that helps balanced out the sourness. This does not have that depth. Still, something that I think is worth a try. It just does not stack up with the big boys IMO."
"Pours a bright yellow with a towering white head and a good amount of lacing. Nose is incredibly funky, near the most funk and earth that I've ever encountered. No need for sourness when there's this much barnyard going on. The taste is a bit overwhelming, even though I love this stuff. Just super raw and pungent. Nice dry mouthfeel with good carbonation. Drinkability is a bit toward the low end given the sheer magnitude of the flavor and the fact that it's fairly one dimensional."
"D - Very sour, but also refreshing. This is a nice lambic, but it also doesn't strike me as terribly unique."
"I'm not too familiar with the style so based on popular opinion I'm going to believe it's good."
"Overall, this is a world class beer and even more proof (in my opinion) that gueuze is the pinnacle of beer. I would put this right up there in the conversation with any other classic."
"D: While this isn't something I'd would drink on a regular basis, it is an interesting and flavorful experience. Drinkable."
"Very very good. Need more of this for aging and just plain enjoying."
"Cheers!"
"D: The beer is very drinkable for the style because the sourness is not very overpowering."
"Loved it. I hope to try this again sometime in the coming months."
"D: Very easy to drink, but at 9.99 a bottle it gets a little expensive."
"This particular example has 20+ years of aging and may have lost its carbonation and the cork could have imparted much more flavor than the brewer intends. It'll be nice to compare a new one to see."
"D: A delicious beer, easy drinking, I definitely wanted some runny soft cheese while I was drinking it. A shame this is $8.50 for a small bottle, but well worth it. If you're going to charge that much, I better get a 5 on taste, and this beer delivers. Hanssens is a classic, I'm glad to see them back on the shelves in the Southland, now only if we could get Cantillon back, we'd be in business."
"D-solid beer and probably doesn't get the credit it deserves, it lacks the balance and complexity of some of the better gueuze but is still a tasty beer that is easily enjoyed."
"(D)- A fantastic gueuze. A great balance; not overly sour or funky, but is fittingly potent. Crisp, with a good acidity level. While this is great, this one bottle is plenty for one sitting by myself; it took me almost an hour to consume. Nontheless, a great example of the style."
"d - very nice and complex sipper."
"Opaque maple syrup color with yellow orange hues slightly opaque. Smell has white grape, peaches, green apple and lemon, all of the aforementioned are sour smelling but there's other lighter sweeter smelling fruits like strawberries and black raspberries that are also present. Taste has an intense sourness to it, lemon, white grape, and apple are dominant here, with a certain belgian funk present, along with oak, throughout that accentuates the fruit. Mouthfeel is oily, viscous, slightly smooth but still watery. 1 750ml will do for me this evening a bit too sour for me to have a few of, this is my first Gueuze ever I will be trying a few more."
"Wow! What a beer, sampled at the Goose Island Clybourn April 2010 tasting. Cidery, vinegary nose, with peppery notes. Flavor is precursed by a sweetness on the tongue, followed by the tart, sour apple flavor explosion. A unique brew by a great brewer. Silky smooth, with a subtle mouthfeel, very drinkable, with a lingering complexity. This is one for the ages, hopefully they keep on making it."
"Notes: Perhaps the best and most drinkable straight gueuze I've had to date."
"375 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a dark gold/amber color with pretty much no head at all. No lacing either. Great aroma, the brew smells like funk, vinegar, lemon zest and tart cherries and apples. The beer tastes like tart apples/cherries/pears, vinegar, and funk. There's also a bit of fruity sweetness noticable too, but the lingering finish is tart. For the most part the taste is similar to the aroma. The sour/tartness is very noticable, but not overpowering. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and dry with low carbonation. Drinkability is good. I don't know if I could drink more than one bottle of this at a time, but also I don't have any problems finishing the bottle I just drank. I think this is a good overall brew. If I was in the mood for a gueuze, I wouldn't have any problem buying this one again."
"D: Not the most drinkable gueuze I've ever had, but very refreshing and finishes balanced enough to not leave your mouth feeling beat up after every sip."
"D- I love these styles of beer but only like to have a maximum of two glasses, mainly because if I drink them too late at night they give me a little heart burn. Regardless give this one a try if you like the style and you won't be disappointed."
"The mouthfeel is good as well. A medium body, though it is certainly undercarbonated. The drinkability is great."
"D: A very nice gueuze. I think the sourness and the predominantly lemon flavor eventually slows this one down. A good example of the style for sure."
"The mouthfeel has low carbonation but is still lively on the palate. Drinkability suffers a little bit because of the extreme sourness, so this needs to be a special treat."
"Absolutely delicious with great harmony between malt, sourness and hops. Low bitterness and no woody character. Noticeably sweet, great drinkabiliity, and well crafted. Truly a refreshing beer."
"Poured a corked and caged 375ml into my Hennepin globe glass. This bee pours a peachy tangerine with a 2 inch head the quickly fades into just a lily pad on top of the beer. Subtle lacing is found around the glass. The nose is, well, gueuzey. Bright lemon tartness, slight must, a bit of salt, and just a hint of ammonia. The flavor starts off the bat with freshly zested lemon. Grapefruit tartness hits the back of the jaw mellowing into musty barnyard. The mouthfeel is moderately dry leaving just a hint of residual sweetness. This is a great gueuze. Not much more to say then that."
"Im glad I opted for the small bottle cause a whole bottle of this would of literally killed me, or seriously F'ed up my inside linings. I can drink some types of sours all day, but I seem to take it easy with Gueuze's, this particular one started eating away at my insides with just a few ounces. That means it's doing it's job. This beer rocks, it's just not meant for a large amount for a man of my stature. Im popping some tums before bed tonight."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and rather light body, the tart aspect is great and the moderate ABV would allow for a couple of these to get sipped on over the course of an evening. A great summer beer, but I would take it anytime."
"What a nice beer, and a great value! Pours a nice hazy golden color with some white head. Smell is refreshing, nice tart and sour notes--lemons, apples, a hint of funk, bit of mustiness. Very nice. Taste delivers more of the same, puckeringly tart with some really nice lemon notes. Apple and oak sneak in there too. Very nice. MF is light with some good carbonation, astringent finish. Great drinkability, tremendous beer for the price. An $11.99 750 mL gueuze of this quality is pretty tough to find."
"D- I am not sure I can put it into words, but I am going to try. I wish I had a kidney size swimming pool of this brew to swim in but alas I would most likely drink it all out of the pool and end up in the ER with alcohol poisoning. It would be worth it. I love this Beer."
"Great gueuze! One of the more lemony/sour ones I have tried, great mouthfeel and a mouthwatering flavor!"
"The beer is lightly carbonated, not sure how long it was aged in barrels or in the bottle. Very dry finish, only 6% ABV as it should be, extremely drinkable to me. But I like lambics/gueuzes/wild ales, if you don't like them sour don't get this."
"D- Worth tasting. But the intense acidity makes it difficult to consider a second bottle in a sitting."
"Beer is thin with great carbonation in the mouth. Drinkability is high. Lots of citric not so much acetic its really really great. I love this beer."
"d - A very enjoyable lambic if you like tart and funk. Feels like champagne almost with a kick. Would try again."
"The flavor is instantly tart and musky. The tartness shows up in apples and lemons, with a white wine flavor that's very present as well. The muskiness comes in a very effervescent way, reminded me of leather in the middle of the profile with something very similar to hay and basement. The mouth feel is enticing as it feels both heavy on flavor, but it's as if the beer evaporates on your tongue it slides down so easy. An interesting and enticing sipper for sure."
"M: Despite the low carbonation the acidity keeps the beer sharp and light."
"D - I can't hide that I simply love this beer. I would be happy to drink one anytime."
"O: I would like less acetic acid, but still good"
"Review from notes taken on: 12/12/09."
"D: There's only so much of this stuff you can drink before it burns a hole in your stomach, but even then, I'd probably keep drinking it. One of the better Gueuzes I've had, and at the price, you can't beat it."
"(Bottle into a tulip glass) This is my first sample in this style and I loved it! Poured a deep amber/orange color with only a trace of white head. Lacing was minimal, but some hung on the glass until the end. The nose...well all I can describe it as is ""earthy""... there is no discernible aroma but the smell was of a muddy creek after a rain, or of that nice wet hay smell on the farm -- very pleasant. When I tasted, I was shocked at first at how sour this was, as the aromas gave no hint of that. Very lively carbonation pops a strong lemon on the tongue and complimented my sharp cheddar burger beautifully!"
"Pours a nice pale orange with a very small amount of haze for a gueuze. Nose is lemon, melon, sour and a very nice and deep bouquet of earthy, musky funk. Flavor is a fruit blast: pineapple, lemon, kiwi, with a tart, tangy, and peppery finish that leaves a beautiful exhale. Very vinous with a pinot grigio quality. At once both sharp and refreshing. An excellent example of the style and one of my new favorites."
"At under $14 for a 750ml, I don't know that this beer can be beat. Excellent stuff."
"This geuze is more sour than many of the other Belgian versions I've had. It looks to bowl you over with the sourness and then impress you with the subtle complexities underneat - beautifully done. Hanssens as I understand it is only a blender rather than a creator but who cares - this beer is delicious! Next time I'll be serving it in the proper glassware but... it probably won't be as fun!"
"Really nice guezuze, and at a good price. While I wouldn't put this up there with Canillon it is one of the finer sours I've come across. Hurrah for Hanssens!"
"Overall, this beer was tough to get through. I wish I knew what year it was."
"Overall a very nice ale at a decent price with the smaller bottle. I'll likely work this into my rotation in an effort to stop drinking so many expensive 750ml bottles of American Wild Ale when I need my sour fix."
"Becomes noticeably fruitier with the addition of some yeast from the bottle. Seems to be a good gueuze, but again I lack experience with this style so I can't say how it compares to many others. Even so, this was quite enjoyable; if I had another, I very well may have poured it into a pint glass and gulped it down."
"This bottle has lasted quite some time and will continue to entertain me for the balance of the evening. Sit and slowly enjoy this beer."
"this beer finishes with a lingering lasting sour tang and a vigirous carbonation that makes the tongue tingle after the beer is gone. this is a nice earth version of the gueuze and a real treat."
"This beer is very complex and while it has a good bit of barnyard tart funkiness it is not acidic at all as has a lot of complexity, integrating sweet estery light fruit notes, resulting in one of the most drinkable sours I've had yet. Highly recommended!"
"D: Good. Very refreshing and fairly complex."
"Overall, pretty good, though not quite at the level as the other gueuze I've had recently. Definitely recommend it though."
"12.7 ounce bottle purchased at Beverage Warehouse a few years back for around eight dollars, drank a few nights ago after a Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze and also from my Drie Fonteinen lambic glass, reviewed from notes, color is a golden orange color with some lighter tones, 1/2 inch creamy white head, very good retention with some lacing, aroma consits of horse blanket, oranges, funk, lemons, oak, eathiness, and peacges, flavor starts off with grapefruit which is odd because I could not detect any in the aroma before, earthy flavors mixed with peaches and oranges in the middle, finish is rather dry with a good amount of oak and funk, dry, earthy, and funky mouthfeel, medium to full bodied for the style, high level of carbonation, taste lingers well, drankl this bottle no problem, light and inviting, no alcohol present, not too tart or sweet, this gueuze may not be expensive as all the other ones out there but that does not mean it lacks in quality, one of the best sours you can get for your money, will drink this again, recommended"
"Oh, and pair this with a triple-cream cheese. The contrasts and compliments between them will be striking, and strikingly delicious."
"This is a wonderful beer which is certainly an acquired taste. On my introduction to the Gueuze style I was astonished, shocked even at the radical departure from conventional beer. The only place I would score lower than top is drinkability; it is not something you knock back, but really sip and savour. From the satisfying pop of the little champagne style cork, through the nice soft foamy pouring into the glass, the complex, musty, slightly pungent aroma, through the searing, withering, puckering tartness, it is really something to ponder. I particularly love the tart apple merging with nutty, earthy notes. I have to thank a chance meeting with a beer geek at Hop Leaf for this awakening."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a large white head that had great retention before settling to a thick cap. Levels of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Has an aroma of sour apples, funkiness, and earthy. Smells acidic. Lip puckering sourness off the bat. Moderate funky flavor up front before leveling off into fruity flavors of apples and lemons. Finishes crisp and clean. Light and airy body perfect for a sour beer. It does not get any better than this. A nicely crafted beer that has a nice wide spectrum of flavor. Refreshing and a nice change of pace."
"D: not bad--lots of vinegar-like sourness in the gueze. would be interested in trying this in a kriek to seeif the balance is better; for me this one is a bit too far to the sour side to call great...although very good. enjoyed this with some trappist cheese."
"D: This is refreshing, much like a tall glass of lemonade on a hot day. Unlike lemonade, it gets better as it warms. I'm still not a huge fan of the sour beers, but this one is pretty good overall."
"It tastes like sour wood. YUck."
"Overall impression is that this is a very well-constructed Gueuze that is true to its style. Warmth helps soften the acidity a great deal to where it becomes much less harsh and the huskier barnyard/horse blanket aromas emerge. Still a bit more acidic than other Gueuze examples I recall, but a very good effort nonetheless."
"375ml corked and caged bottle served in my small Allagash tulip. Poured a hazy, tawny orange with a one inch bubbly bright white head that gradually recedes into a thin cap. Nose reveals citrus, must, cork and wet, coarse wool. Bold, tart, sour and citrusy upfront with a residual clinging character of the barnyard that peaks out at the back. Moutthfeel is light-bodied and very astringent - the acidity slightly masks the carbonation presence. I have very little experience with sours, but was craving something different and I really enjoyed this. Looking forward to trying some others."
"I hadn't had a gueuze lambic in a while, so I ordered this one from the two-page belgian beer menu at the bar. I had never heard of this particular beer before and I was in a celebration mood, so the above-average price was fine with me. I love the sourness and would most certainly order this beer again."
"This is an exceptionally good gueuze, full of funk, acidity and character, but staying crisp and drinkable. Probably not an ""entry level"" gueuze, due to the high degree of funk and acidity, but a great one if you're looking for the top end of the scale."
"This beer pours as a bright and hazy golden color with a thick and white soapy head. The aroma is tart, like lemon juice, with a lot of barnyard and horse sweat funk. There is a touch of yeast and some very pale, grainy malt. The taste is moderately sour, with a citric and earthy flavor. Solidly good. The texture is very nice...the combination of sourness and astringency, layered with the carbonation is very pleasing. Refreshing and very inviting. This is a very nice Gueuze."
"75cl bottle. Pours a clear ruddy gold with a nice bubbly white head. Strong smell; leathery, cheesy, musty, and tart. Taste is sour and musty, with an unexpectedly sweet fruitiness--notes of citrus and cherry. Like in the oude kriek, this sweetness tastes artificial and is a bit off-putting. Ends up dry, at least. Medium body with high carbonation."
"Glad to have this anytime, among the best in it's style. Cheers!"
"A ridiculously refreshing beer that I rate very high for the style in drinkability. Just so good. Invigorating, each sip is like plunging your tatse buds into a cold stream."
"Had a bottle in Ghent and was quite pleased. Poured a hazy amber gold and thick white head. The big character here is the toasted oak barrel flavor. After that is more of typical (of great oude guezes) ripping sour tang that hits the back of your cheekbones with lemon, lime, and earthy spice. Delicious. I'll have another."
"Drinkability: this bottle was shared with a friend which provided just enough enjoyment over a slow sipping period. This is not a beer to quaff all night long."
"Both prove to be true - Hannsens is pleasingly sour and acidic without diving too hard into the vinegar spectrum, although it's present too. Strong citric presence, alcohol is muted. The body is just fine, pretty thin overall but smooth enough. Carbonation makes some elements of the sip seem like carbonated water. Great sour beer, exactly what a gueuze should act like."
"Rare cask serving at Map Room, 10 oz. pour into a Sam Smith glass. Bright orange with a light haze, a surprising puffy head that rises above the rim for a few minutes. Miniscule traces of carbonation rise to the surface. Mildly pungent and sharp, wet wood, with a vegetal note like wildflower and lemon peel compost. Tastes much the same, a moderately citric lemon sourness: 6/10 scale, very soft and supple feel with little carbonation. The woody element seems to dominate, with some bitter tannin in the aftertaste. A few of these would be really great, but I had to limit myself to one. The novelty of the cask serving made me daydream of what it must be like to drink in the rare Lambic cafes found in Belgium. Also, thanks to quinnsi who shared a bottle recently at Sheffields!"
"This was one of the most enjoyable sour beers I've ever had."
"Poured a beautiful cloudy orange color with no real head. Aroma is very tart filled with the smell of green apple, funk, and dry tartness. Taste is awesome nice tart funk flavor fills the mouth but fades rather quickly. The mouthfeel is smooth but filled with carbonation. Drinkability is definitely due to the fact that it reminds me of more expensive RR sours even though it's a gueze. Overall a great beer and a great substitute when you're craving the above mentioned sours. A pleasure to drink!"
"4 M&4.5 D: medium-bodied, the carbonation feels slightly sharp upfront, yet turning softer as it breathes; the focused flavour profile is perhaps the strongest point in this beer. It could've been more complex if given some more time to mature, I guess, but the beer as of now is already delicious and full of joy. I still wonder why no freshness info. is printed on the label..."
"D - For a style that I nearly always find marginally undrinkable, Hannssens is quite drinkable. The main factor here is the lack of abosutely caustic sourness and acidity that I've experienced in other beers. Here, the sourness is much more restrained and the brett/wild character is accentuated. Great stuff."
"Opinion: This is a pretty damn good Gueuze. I like the balance it has, and would actually be a pretty good one for someone who was new to this style. As wild as their Mead the Gueuze was, I was expecting something more assertive. As it is, this is a nice blend. Of course I would drink this beer again, but I prefer like a Girardin Black Label or some such. Either way a good beer to try."
"Drinkability is definitely low just due to the complexity and tartness, but this was one of the most spectacular drinks I've had."
"Taste is that of the most dry, sour white wine that I have ever had. It hit me like a ton of lemon flavored bricks. My brother liked it, he was gulping it down, but he had already ingested a few IPAs as well as half a bottle of Hennepin. Oh and a margarita. But anyhow, this was just too much sourness for me, it took me off guard and perhaps next time I try a Geuze I will be more prepared. I expected a sweeter wine profile, maybe that is what a lambic tastes like as opposed to a geuze...I don't know."
"I accidentally paired it with curry chicken and it was a very pleasant surprise (by ""accidentally"" I mean I popped it open and 10 minutes later my wife says ""ready for curry chicken!?""). They both have distinct and strong flavors but didn't fight at all in fact they seemed to keep each other at bay."
"D - This is a great drinking beer. Probably not something you want to pound a lot of, but definitely on the high end if you are in the mood for a geueze."
"D - Not something I'd drink heaps of but I'd definately drink this again."
"D_I need to pair this with food, preferably cheese and/or bread (I reviewed this with Oude en Jonge Goude cheeses). If you do enjoy the flavor, then the drinkability is quite high; the beer does not hit you with any hard alcohol taste or impact, so it can be enjoyed over and over again"
"D: What a way to start thanksgiving. I scared my father with this beer."
"A fairly extreme Gueze but very well balanced. Love it!"
"4.0/5"
"D: Not overly sour, a nice tartness mixed with a good complexity. An absolute pleasure to drink. I wish it were a hot summer day because this beer is brilliant. A great beer if you want to work your way into the sourer beers. Marvelous."
"375ml bottle $6.99. beautiful orange with a short foam atop, then not even one bubble. It smells like the slightest hint of funky cheese, lemons, dusty cardboard boxes. It tastes sour, citrus, lemons, good gueuze. The mouthfeel seemed a little thin at first, but overall it was adequate."
"Drinkability is how much good sour you can stand."
"Review from tasting notes. Pale orange, hazy. Aroma is slighty vegetal, spicy, and sour to say the least. Horse blanket and dirty feet funkyness. Not all that appealing. Flavor follows suit, but not as strong as the nose. Very sour and tart, some fruitiness, slightly medicinal. Low carbonation, very slick on the tongue. I like the funk and the sour, but this is a bit much for my personal taste. I'm sure there are many who appreciate it for the style, and more power to them. Just can't see myself seeking more of this out. Drinking more than one at a time would be overwhelming for me. I like sour beers very much, but there are other sour styles I would rather partake in."
"this brew poured up a straight yellow color...the aroma was sour!....also smelled a little of urine...the taste was super duper sour...im in limbo right now about this beer...do i have another one to give it a second shot or do i let it ride on down the stream past me?..."
"A powerhouse gueuze for sure! Near the end of it, I took a slice of creamy Chimay cheese from my fridge and ate it with it. It made a great pairing!"
"Crystal clear gold, small thin egg shell white head. Recedes really fast and a foamy ring lingers the rest of the way. The barn and old leather type aromas come through easily at first. As for the taste, it's hard to say much other than ""sour."" It's obviously got that earthy component that is found in the aroma, it just comes through a bit different in the taste. Not as intensely sour as I thought it would be. The most recent gueze I've had was Beatification a few days ago, and that seemed to be more intense. Still very good, Hanssens has lived up to everything I had heard about them."
"Poured a cloudy orange body with good carobonation that gives a large head that leaves a lace sheath. I am not a huge fan of tart citric drinks but this is different. While it is extremely tart and carbonated in a medium body, it contains a good amount of fruit in the taste like apple, grape, some sour citrus and has a dry backbite that kicks your ass. While there's no malts I can put my finger on, there's a very mild sweetness that shields this beer from being overly bitter. I didn't drink this for a special occasion; it is not necessary. I recommend this to any adventorous beer drinker."
"Golden amber color with a quickly fading fizzy head. Sweaty, smelly feet is all I get. This is really too much. I had to let this thing warm up for about a half hour before that smell died down a bit. Ok, lemon, hay and some apples. The feet aroma is still there. This is not a subtle stinky feet aroma, this is a big fat sweaty guy sticking his toes in your nose stink."
"Served from a 750ml bottle and pours a orange cloudy beer. A nice foamy head that quickly settles to a light lace on top of the beer. The smell is a little bitter with an aroma of bananas, dry cider and also I detect some pear. The taste is bitter at the nose and throughout, their is also a hint of vinegar taste. You can definitely taste some fruits before the champagne dryness comes through. This is extremely tart and not my style but I have to judge it on the style and it fits it to a tie even though it could have a little bit more of a fruit taste to it. The beer is carbonated like a glass of champagne and likewise does not have that much drinkability, even for the style I think it is to tart to drink a lot."
"refreshingly acidic and dry. could use a tad more esters or malt sweetness."
"Overall: This beer is not for everyone, in fact I would venture to say that the few people that do like this are at least a little bit crazy. Its sour, overwhelming, intense and it makes you feel like you just bit into an old gym sock stuffed with sour apples. And I loved every second of it"
"Mouthfeel was effervescent immediately but faded toward the end. Medium to light bodied."
"D - Used to be my favorite Gueuze until i have tried many others but still top notch. Very easy to drink for the sour acidity."
"Bottle bought at City Wide in South Bend. Pours a clear straw color with a bubbly dusting of a head. Looks quite effervescent. Smells massively sour, also has a horseiness and overripe citrus in the nose. Taste is a sinus clearing sourness at first. Nice clean malt backbone comes through fast afterwards. Sourness becomes a stable/hay flavor and is less intense after a couple of sips. Delicate but complex flavor with pineapple and grapefruit notes. very tasty. Medium bodied and clean feel, not as bubbly in the mouth as it looks. Top notch. very clean and tasty while also feeling earthy and old-world."
"Very nice beer, I enjoyed this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Microbubbles that smooth out further into the swallow, it's easy and a great beer to start things off. One of my all time favorite aperitif choices, and always a conversation starter at gatherings."
"Drinkability- I always believe these things are going to be way tarter than they really are and I always find myself enjoying them, extremely. I actually liked this Gueuze much better than the Girardin Gueuze 1882 Black Label (Unfiltered). I thought it was much less sour and way easier drinking."
"D- Hard to finish this one. Even for a geuze, it's too much. Nothing subtle. I wonder why the bottle is so big?"
"Try as I might to be fair about this style, it was simply an awful experience but one I felt I must try, since I never shy away from tasting something new. This was my first experience with the Gueuze style. Clearly it takes someone with a niche palate and a strong control of the gag reflex to appreciate this stuff. I am not wussy enough to avoid it and will try to find something that is more palatable in the future, but glossing it over with charming adjectives isn't gonna work. The words ""chicken coop shit"" came to mind the minute it was presented and I took a wiff at a very special bar in Brookline, Mass called Publick House and Monk's Cell. The barnyard nastiness continued in the taste but it was exacerbated by the blended sour brew that was part of the blend of this beer. The Belgian sour in and of itself takes a great deal to get used to. If you've never experienced a ""rauchbier"" then you're in for a double wammy when you taste this concoction. ""Funky"" is being kind. Avoid this style if you want to avoid losing your dinner or if you've never come close to similiar flavors in your Belgian experience before. Like I said, I'll explore the Gueze style again but I will proceed with extreme caution before doing so. Nasty, nasty stuff."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent that is completely soured; very nice. It's so tart it makes my toes curl. The taste is awesome! This is the most sour beer I've ever tried. The recipe is basic:pale malt and lambic yeast. There is no hop character at all. It has a woody component to it that really comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a kick ass beer. It makes my face pucker after even the tiniest sip. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: A sipper."
"Great beer for a hot summer day. So simple and delicate yet complex and perfectly balanced. Great example of the style."
"Notes: An amazing style. This one lives up to its billing. Even more amazing is the modest price, all things considered a winner."
"Pours a hazy orange with a head that fades to a thin cap. Smells pretty typical for a well-made gueuze, sour, acetic, metallic, and funky. Taste is similar, with a quick sourness in the mouth, followed by a slightly herbal flavor, some non-hop bitterness and some ripe cheese at the end. Horseblanket undercurrents. Mouthfeel is crisp,slightly slick, and full. Not as tannic as some. Extremely refreshing and interesting as usualfor the style."
"Poured from a 750 ml corked bottle for New Years into a gueuze glass. Poured a golden orange color with off white champagne head. Smell is sour vingear aroma followed by a strong barnyward and dirty sock funk. Taste is quite sour with citrus lemon coming through mixed with a tart green apple flavor, a slight bile taste, with slate minerals following. Mouthfeel is dry and very puckering sharp, almost like licking a battery with you tongue. While not the most drinkable gueuze because of the high acidic flavor it is one of the best sipping gueuze. I have been drinking for years and at 8.99 a bottle in my opinion a better value than an other gueuze on the market."
"d: My first gueuze but certainly not my last. It will be awhile before I try another one however."
"D_durian if that makes any sense. The smell reminds me of a certain type of fecal matter but the taste is great. As they say smells like chit, tastes like heaven."
"I love extremely sour beers, and this is one of the most intense guezes I have had. Thumbs up."
"Drinkability is very high for a sour. I could probably drink a whole 750 but I think it would be a sin to hoard such a wonderful beer experience (beer-sperience?). If you see any old style bottles with rusty cages and torn up labels, pick them up because this is an awesome beer. I hope to be able to keep my paws off of the last two bottles for some time to see how this one ages even longer."
"Large green Belgian style bottle, caged and corked. Pours semi cloudy, medium apricot amber, minor and short lived, medium tan head. Morphs down to a thin film and leaves next to no lacing. Tart, green apple nose. Sourness is the story here. Horse blanket, barnyard funk in all its artisinal glory. Funk quite prominent and showing its puckering muscles. Surely not a crowd pleaser, but sour beer lovers will be all over this one."
"kick ass geuze. a little midler than cantillon for reference."
"Crystal clear and deept gold with an off-white cap of medium-sized bubbles. Good head retention with little lacing. The aroma was on the tart side, earthy with notes of strawberry, socks, straw, kind of funky. The flavour was tart and sour throughout with a sweet background. Earthy funk and mild spice, along with mild fruitiness, filled out the middle. Tart raspberries lingered in the finish. Light bodied with a little residual sugar. Medium/high carbonation, spritzy and refreshing. The texture was a little creamy after the carbonation subsided. Dry sourness. Pretty good and I would imagine a little more accessible than some gueuzes. Nicely balanced."
"Poured in to a wine glass a cool orange, with good heading and a spritzy carbonation. Smells of green apples, lemons, and a bit of funk permeate the nose. Taste is extremely dry, tasting of champaign and tart green apple. Body of this beer is light and highly carbonated. If you're in to sour beers, this Gueuze should be extremely easy to drink. What a beer, perfect for a warm summer day. One bottle is not enough."
"hugely sour when i taste it, as well. the vinegar aspect is a bit visceral, as well as in the aroma. it's a little unpleasant, actually but i'll chalk it up to less than excellent keeping, which i have accused before of the establishment where i bought this."
"very nice geuze, taste is complex, but subtle compared to some others of the style. well crafted and a good representation of the geuze. definitely get this if your love belgian lambic beers."
"This beer is a nice representation of a Gueuze. Tons of flavor, matched with a sourness found in only the best. It is very Champagne like in character and oh so enjoyable. I would love to toast with this on a special occasion or pop a few open with some friends paired with some goat cheese and crusty bread."
"This is a classic example of a nice Gueuze. It doesn't stray much from what you'd expect, it's got the perfect sourness and it keeps you drinking it to the last drop. Highly recommended..."
"D - Ok, I would have this again for sure...but it's not a session brew by any means. I like this as a slow sipping beer...as long as I just take tiny sips I could drink this all night, but I couldn't drink it fast enough to call it a session. I'll be revisiting this one for sure!"
"Poured out of a 12.7oz corked bottle. Appearance is pretty average, nothing special (I find it's very uncommon that a beer's appearance stands out from the pack anyway) with a slight chill haze and plenty of bubbles stuck to the side of the glass. Color is darkish straw, and head rapidly retreats to a small ring. The smell is full of the wonderful puckering tartness that makes this style just so wonderfully wonderful, and is balanced with a nice mustardy spicey malt. The taste of this just what the smell would lend me to expect. Full of lip-cringing tartness that rides all the way along the roof of your mouth, tingling your senses and revealing levels of that dry white wine essence, with fruits and esthers and other unknown flavors. This beer remains very mysterious to me, although I have to admit, I really just want to drink more of it. Mouthfeel is dry, well carbonated and drinkable. What else can I say? I just want to stop writing this review and drink some more of this"
"A white sticky head sits a top a yellow body that provides nice carbonation. The nose is full of barnyard smells with a faint hint of lemon and grass. Also very apparent in the nose and taste is notes of vinegar, which I've never noticed as bluntly in a Gueuze before. The taste is also full of tart sour notes. As you drink this beer your cheeks pucker and it has a very refreshing feel to it, a very nice beer that would lend itself to a hot summer day."
"D - Matched well with the Belgian style mussels that I had it with, but not a beer I would drink in large quantities by itself."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a small corked and caged bottle into a slender cylinder glass. Beautiful golden orange-ish straw color with some noticeable bubbly carbonation. Only a small amount of fizzy head appears around the edges. Smells like extra funky apple cider champagne. All sorts of weird and wild barnyard aromas too such as straw, mud, dirty floor. Crispy and fresh mouthfeel, again, champagne-like. This tastes like delicious sour, tart apples and green grapes. Kind of like a nice semi-dry/sweet bubbly white wine but with some light, dry malt and grain presence at the end. This is my new champagne! Very drinkable as well. I would recommend this be enjoyed with some artisan cheese and a nice fresh, crispy baguette."
"This is my first Gueze so you may want to take this review with a grain of salt. The smell is very different and somewhat offputting, but I heard that is typical for the style so I gave an average rating. The taste was okay; a bit rancid, full of tart lemon peel. The one thing I do like about this is the tartness and the sourness. I have been wanting to try something different and tart and this one certainly fit the bill. Glad I tried it. Maybe I will grow to like this style better; I have four more bottles in the fridge."
"D: This was really what I was looking for. The coffee I had earlier really dried me out. This was refreshing and hit the spot."
"Very interesting. And recommended for those times when you're looking for something different."
"Drinkability: Sour and funky, but delicious."
"Mouthfeel is medium, I hesitate to call it ""clean"" although there are no identifiable defects or anything un-gueuze-like. A bit of an acidic bite, sort of aspirin-y, a little chardonnay. Not as extreme as others (there are better examples of the style) but quite drinkable."
"its an okie dokie not great one for me.. I either want more fruit tones or more puckerness"
"Poured out a reddish brown into my glass with a decent white head. Nose gives off sour cherry, raisins, and sherry. Taste is mucht the same, but the sourness is way shrper. On the palate, I get sour cherry, strawberry, curry, prune, date, and believe it or not, a flavor that reminds me of buffalo chickrn. Has a sharp mouthfeel, but a clean finish. Not my favorite in the style, but still anout of a dirty sock to make fans happy.."
"I have heard that Hanssens is the mildest and most accessible of the gueuzes. I tend to agree."
"Additional info: I'm sure this is spot on for the style, but this was my first try at the style. I didn't seem to care for Oud Bruin's the first time I tried them, but I love them now. So even though this won't be given high scores from me, I definately think it's worth trying and I will be trying it again, hopefully enjoying then."
"750 ml corked and bailed bottle."
"Drinkability- One bottle is tough to do by yourself, but I will be picking up another if I find one. The 6% abv sneaks up on you."
"D - This was gone very quickly. Difficult to put the glass down. Excellent beer."
"Poured from a small corked bottle. Pours a very clean orangey color with a moderate head that goes down to a film. Smell is a combo of sweet malt and lambic barnyard funk. The taste is very good, the first to hit you is the sweetness of the wheat malt, accented by lively carbination followed by a great puckering sourness. A dry finish, but not as dry as some other gueuzes. The mouthfeel is really good, with the carbination bubbling on the tounge as the mouth puckers around it. If you like gueuze this is very drinkable, dynamic beer, I recommend it."
"Taste is dry, crispy mouthfeel. Very complex, with farm like flavors that come out, apples are very present with notes of cidre followed by shy spice and pepper with a shy hoppy presence."
"I would have more after having some more experience with the more sour styles...I could appreciate it much more."
"Clear light copper in colour with practically no carbonation. Mild aromas of very sour granny smith apples, mozzarella cheese, and a bit of barnyard. Sharp, but not overwhelming acidity. A bit more sour apple in the mouth, along with a note of pear, and wet hay. There was also a bit of a woody note that revealed itself as the beer warmed up. Very drinkable, but lacking a bit of complexity."
"strong tartness that sticks to your teeth. fiercely sour and slightly drying in the finish. the barest hints of apple sweetness and cheesy funkiness. very drinkable, and a very good gueuze."
"Poured a clouded, copper orange with light ruby hue. Lots of tiny bubbles attach the to the side of my tulip stem glass. Great lively carbonation. Aroma filled the room with smell of over ripened fruit and slight 'outdoorsy funk' - as if sitting in an orchard at fall time. A mutli-layered finish: first very weet, then tart, finally just plain sour. A clearly cut 3 level mouthfeel. Aroma of rotting fruit (though more pleasant than it sounds!) I would say most closely resembled apricot, pear, and apple. Very complete mouthfeel. A sugary round-a-bout finish. Carbonation high, but very controlled. Leaves a sticky feeling on your teeth. A wine-like flavour, carbonation makes it sweet, reminiscent of champagne. Flavour (slightly void, and yeasty) diminishes quickly and youre left with not much else but over-ripe tartness. Really, not much taste, but tons of tartness. Lick your lips you get a sour sensation, as if you had eaten lots of candy. Sorta burns a hole in the back of your throat as the sourness floats around your gums. Adapted a cider-like complex as it warmed. Pretty fun!"
"A good brew, I'm shocked."
"This is a fine gueuze, full of funk. Very highly recommended, especially if youre a gueuze head."
"An experience in a bottle and much more about how it makes your mouth and nose feel then its particular taste or aroma. To drink a gueze like this is to remind oneself to fill their life with vitality and ardor."
"Am I missing something? Perhaps our bottle was not representational of the universally-known greatness of this beer? I would like to try this again, but only because others seem to have enjoyed it so much."
"Orange. Diminishing head. Deep aroma of peach cobbler, salmon, wet wood, grapefruit, red apple, flies, mold, cheese and horseblanket. Devastatingly horsey, funky and just plain sour. Harsh as hell. A definate teeth cleaner. Flavor seems to lean towards the grapefruit/lemon side of things but it is fairly complex and definately enjoyable."
"I know this is an acquired taste, but I thought my palate was getting pretty mature. I could handle, even kind of like those first two - but I just can't see why rotting produce, horse blankets, and vomit are appealing characteristics. Maybe I'll revisit this style, but I need to give my mouth some time to regain faith in beer...and humanity. Every tongue has its breaking point, it just so turns out that mine is gueuze. You win this time Belgium - but you haven't heard the last of me."
" This is not as harshly sour as some of the Cantillon lambics I've had. Or perhaps it is the sweetness that balances this beer. Maybe it is age, as there is no date on this beer. Patches of dirt and funk. Carbonation fades quickly, and this is relatively mild in its sourness. This is way too balanced to not be drinkable."
"Ya gotta getta Geuze ! Seriously."
"Pale golden appearance, slightly hazy but uniform and bright. Middling head, flat and pale, spreads out in an open chalice. Minimal lacing, some small marks and dots. Very tart aroma, quite astringent without the cheesiness of some. Light body and plenty of active fizziness. Good puckering flavor qualities, slicing acidity and sourness. Moderate sense of Brett for me, I kind of missed a bit more yeastiness in this bottle. Still, no sweet pretender to the style, nice and in-your-face overall."
"Hmmm, so this is gueuze (and the first real lambic I've had). 375 mL bottle, corked and caged with no freshness date, but it's aged for three years before they even distribute it, so not sure how much it matters. Pours a fairly clear gold with 1 inch of off white head that tries to lace the flute. Smells of various plants and animals, dung, leather, rotting fruit?, mustiness, and other qualities I can't name. Just from the aroma you can visualize the fields and musty barns that must be near the brewery. It has a medium body that is quite dry and tingly, staying carbonated forever. The flavor is sour, musty, tart, with an acidic bitterness and some of the aroma's scents coming through, but none of the sweetness that it may have hinted at, and few, if any, hops. An interesting style, but the pronounced sourness lowers the drinkability for me, though I would imagine it's more drinkable when balanced by sweetness as in fruit lambics. I will, however, keep looking for other examples of the style."
"This brew pours a hazy red color with orange hues. The head is vey small and recedes within seconds. There is little lacing. The aroma is sour and tart with cherries peaking through. The taste is tart, then sour, then tart again. The aftertaste is very pleasing, and pleasant. It is tart and flavorful, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, juicy, and has low carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer. I would most certainly drink this again."
"The cork pops out in a snap and the beer overflows. The pour is a hazy peach tinged amber. There was a 1/4 inch white head for about five seconds. This review is brought to you by the word ""Funk."" Massive aroma of vinegar, lemon, barnyard, and cider. In your face sourness and tartness fill the palate and I swear I found malty sweetness in here at some point. I've only had one other lambic so I don't really have a point of comparison, but this tastes pretty damn good."
"Overall: My first gueuze, and I'm ready to try some more! I'm knocking it down on drinkability because there's no way I could finish more than one of these in a night, but it's a great change-up from the stouts and pale ales I've been drinking."
"33 cL punted green bottle, corked and caged. Golden amber orange with a sticky, fluffy head that soon becomes a thin cap. Aroma is of tart apples, horse barn grass -- somewhat reminiscent of a dry white wine. The taste is dry, ""farmy," and acidic. A very dry fruitiness, like Granny Smith apples mixed with, unbelievably, caju -- the Brazilian fruit cashews come from. The juice from one of these things will give you the most intense cotton mouth ever. It's insane, but this beer totally has this back of the palate dessicating effect going on that is only comparable to caju juice. Refreshing and mouth-puckering. Excellent stuff. I will definitely seek this out again."
"It's definitely an acquired taste. I enjoy it and even I won't drink it just any time. You need certain conditions to enjoy it fully - maybe a special occasion. I am keeping it in my cellar for those moments when I crave something sour. Life is not all sweet, and neither should be beer. It's a wonderful brew!"
"Appearance is a nice copper with some head that fades slowly. Nose smells strongly of chemicals and plastic. I didn't expect that. Definitely some vinegar in there too. There is a definitely funky urine smell as well. Very interesting. Taste starts with some residual sugar sweetness. Interesting. I haven't had a gueuze quite this sweet yet. Perhaps because the yeast used didn't consume most of the sugar present, this gueuze is also much less tart than the others I've had. It's taste is a little muddled as well. Can't seem to find focus between the tart and a mild malty flavor. Mouthfeel is nice and effervescent, does its job. I finished most of a 750 by myself so drinkability isn't too bad."
"this is so light and effervescent. How charming to meet you. A dry sense of humor that edges to caustic and socially inappropriate. This lady manages herself well, however, and makes great company. She's lively with a bubbly personality. Yes, though armed with a stick and not afraid to lash out, she's a picture of amiability. She's a woman for all seasons. She's as inviting as a blossoming orchard after a spring rain; as dry as bitter chicory gone to bloom; as complimentary as rusty leaves and wild apples; as warm as an overyly ripe cheese. This beer is engaging to the senses, but not overwhelmingly assertive. She speaks her mind, but we were able to carry on a pleasant conversation, and afterwards she wasn't too restrained to pee behind the barn."
"This beer is a required taste and not my type of Geuze. The Boone type was OK and New Belgiums La... whatever was great."
"Highly drinkable for a gueuze."
"Not for the queasy but definitely worth a try."
"I brought a case of this home with me after a trip to Baarle Hartog. What a good choice. Lovely colour, nice foamy head, not too much effervescence, authentic gueuze smell and taste.... what more might you ask for? I can drink this stuff all day. Warmly reccommended."
"I've been craving gueuze the last few days. At last I went into the closet today and got the 750 ML bottle of Hanssens Oude Gueuze that I've been saving. This beer has a slightly hazy apricot color. The head is initially large, but subsides after a few minutes. I spent at least that long sniffing the beer before I even took a sip. I love the funky, musty, acidic vinegar aroma. Am I the only man who gets a perverse pleasure from watching his friends smell this beer? The flavor is as good as the aroma. Sweet at first, but only for an instant before the sour kicks in. Flavors of grapes, straw, citrus, funk, and honey. Funky, but not the funkiest of gueuzes. Certainly among the most sour. For anyone who ever finds himself in a beer drinking rut where all beers seem boring, I would recommend drinking a gueuze. Hanssens is a great example of the style."
"Last swigs: Attractive beading dandelions and lemons. Reminds me of Boon Gueuze. Second pour became more metallic."
"Dark orange with a white foamy head. Funky musty smell that fills you with dread if you aren't expecting it (I'm judging from my spouse's expression). Tart tannic tastes that varies from sharp to astringent througout the mouth. Some sweetness and carbonic bite. What a ride for the taste buds. Mouthfeel is minimal due to the nearly complete focus on the tongue but the finish is long lasting. If you like unblended lambics or sour ales then you will find this emmanently drinkable. My wife popped a sparkling wine for comparison. It was like Dick & Jane vs. Tolstoy when it came to complexity. The latter of course being analagous to the gueuze."
"A harsh style to share, though the mouthfeel impact was muted. Smelled like vinegar and cider, and barnyard as well, so not pleasing to novices. Acidic, sour, with yeast mildly playing on the taste buds. Didn't work that well for me, even with food."
"No dating on 75 cl cork and caged bottle. Pours a pale bronze color with a lively white head. Some farmhousey gueuze qualities in the aroma like sour apple, flint and gunsmoke, wet dog and other subtle nuances that would describe funkiness (Bootsy Collins not included). Intriguing taste. Sourness is aggressive upfront and a residual sweetness shows up well after the swallow. Light cheese and lemony notes. Beautifully crafted and balanced, which equates to a fully enjoyable and highly drinkable gueuze. I like this one a lot."
"Not sure I'll ever be able to give a hardcore gueuze anything higher than a 3 in the drinkability field. Unfortuntely..."
"This is the real deal. Ideal for style. I wouldn't change a thing with this one. Excellent drinkability."
"Cloudy golden-orange. Gentle white ring. Gueuzes aroma can be smelled from far. Probably the most expressive cheese aromas Ive experienced. Incredibly funky, horsey, sweaty, leathery, plastic-like even. Cider, basement, cobwebs notes etc. Superb yeast development. Fairly adequate malt base reminds of honey hence its not all about sourness. Truly a top echelon gueuze that does everything right and more. One Id keep a stash of, this and cuvée rené. Dry oaky palate with loads of yeast complexities. Cider like dryness develops toward the acidic funky finish. FUNKY. I love it. Medium to full body, low-medium carbonation. How can you not admire a product that presents all those flavors that would be considered of in basically almost any other style with such gracious eccentricity and agility is something I cant understand. Underated."
"I used this beer as my packing companion for my first ""it's all about the beer trip", my 2004 Belgium trip for the Belgian Beer Paradise in Brussels. What a sendoff!!!!"
"Taste: Good carbonation and acidity, but lacks a little of the punch I've had in other examples of the style, the finish seemed a bit more watery. It was however quite refreshing and easy to drink (as far as Gueuzes go, I suppose)."
"The first thing that I notice is it explodes in your mouth. Extremely smooth and complex. So many flavors keep coming at you. Again, more apple as well as citrus. Not as dry in the end as I expected. Not as in your face as the Cantillion gueuze if I remember correctly. Both seem very different to me. I can't wait to travel to Belgium to sample more Gueuze just like this."
"I actually had my entire house try this one before I had even tried it. ""It tastes like it's gone bad"" and ""This is really disgusting"" were the general consensus. So it goes. However, on my first sip, I was like, whoa! The pour is orange-ish with a little head, The smell is sour, but not vinegary. It was enough to intrigue my friends. The taste. Hmmm.... It has this lactic acid thing going on coupled with that sourness that isn't quite sour, as it goes kind of round before finishing off to a slightly bitter slight sour aftertaste. Gueze is definitely an acquired taste, but to me it's like fruit but with the sourness instead of the sweetness. Mouthfeel is good. Not too much carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but I'm not sure I could drink it all night. One bottle is definitely fine for me..."
"This is beyond foul. So much so, that a sense of endearment develops."
"Poured a hazy, cloudy orange with a white head that quickly vanished (probably to get away from the smell). Smelled strongly of nature and quite sour. Tasted sweet and fruity with a heavy sour component. Enjoyable feel and easy to drink. I would share this one again wtih good company."
"It pours a hazy orange with a white fizzy carbonation that dissipates fast. There is a strong musty aroma with some horse blanket smells. The taste starts with barnyard and horse blanket it has an almost mouth-puckering sourness. It is funky and acidic with a touch of woodiness and fruit, though no sweetness. It finishes with a musty quality, but it is refreshing nonetheless. A wonderful beer that I could drink very often."
"Sampled 12/13/03"
"Corked and caged heavy glass bottle. Unknown vintage. The cage is removed and the cork forcefully exits the bottle. The liquid is a light golden colour with a small fizzy head of white foam. The aromas are less complex than most other guezes I have sampled, and unfortunately the taste follows suit. It's all just a bit sweet and bland to me with no real gueze ""oomph"". The mouthfeel is spritzy and the drinkability is nice."
"The tartness is so strong that I drink again and again to see if it's still strong. It is!!! A lot goes on in my mouth each time I try so, what can I say?...the mouthfeel is extremely fun. It's a beer version of poptarts and I mean that in a good way. I will drink this again and consider it quite drinkable. I wouldn't drink anything beforehand though. It's so tart that it deserves to be tried first to avoid any preconceptions of the evenings tastes. I urge you to think unique when you prepare to drink it. It's gueuze not beer...the distinction is big. Anyone thinking that it will be an ale will be confused."
"To say this beer is drinkable would be an understatement. Refreshing in its citrus and acidic qualities, this is a great example of what a good bottle of gueuze becomes after some deliberate ageing. Really great stuff."
"This beer is a large reason why. Search it out, and try it. And, if you fear Gueuze, or don't think that Belgian styles are all that grand...well, get yourself a bottle of this, and...HELL YEAH!"
"First time I ever try a gueuze. Pourred a light beige/brown brew with a nice head. I can already smell the sourness coming out of my glass. Taste is very sour with a light sweet aftertaste. Alcohol is very subtle with a medium body. Very different from what I had experienced before but still very enjoyable."
"Not a bad brew. When poured, it had a bit of a champagne like color, but the aroma was of the barnyard variety: apples and horses. Luckily, I like both. It's amazing how the beer doesn't taste like it smells, it's better. I found it dry, with some sweetness in the aftertaste. I also enjoyed the mouthfeel, I thought it had good, sharp but small carbonation. Not a bad brew, but I can see where it could be off-putting to some. pat"
"Okay, so this is a really good solid gueuze. It poured a nice light coppery color and was cloudy, but not completely dense looking. It had a nice head but not all that big upon the pouring. There was the very clearly gueuze smell which was present. The funky yeasty barnyardiness was there. The flavor was nice and tart as it should be. It had very small champagne like bubbles. They were rather gentle feeling. This was quite tasty with a nice mild yeastiness to it. If you like this one and can still find Oude Bersel's Oude Ville Gueuze (I hope I remembered that right), go out and try that one too before it is gone!!!"
"So this is what a gueuze is? My first. I can say that I liked it but I don't really know if it's my style. Smell is, uh, sourkraut? Tastes a lot like champagne but with more of an earthy, yeasty flavor to it. Very tart and somewhat sour, but it seems like the sour flavor is held back a little and can't quite come out all the way. Finish is super dry. A good beer to have, but only on certain occassions."
"Clear golden color. Fluffy white meringue light head with good retention. Aroma is lemongrass, acetic acid, horse blanket and must. This one's got some acidity to it. A little more harsh and less sweet than their Kriek. It still doesn't compare to the mouth puckering ability of Cantillon though. I like the lemon grass quality and barnyard aspects. Vinegar like stinging leaves a dry lingering aftertaste. Carbonation is lively and body about medium. Yeah, this is a solid gueuze."
"Drinkability: a world class gueze. my favorite is still Drie Fonteinen but this one is a classic nontheless."
"Hazy golden/orange with a good initial head that vanishes fairly quickly to a wine-like appearance.Aromas are nice and citrusy and very cheesy, with a dose of old wood. If you like funky chese you'll like this no doubt. The taste is refreshing and much like drinking pure grapefruit juice-nice and sour with ample bitter-it grows on you as you sip it, nice one to have while preparing dinner. A tasty sour for any tart!"
"Overall drinkability on this beer is excellent. As I stated before this is my first gueuze experience, and I can see how some people would be turned off by the sourness and tart flavor but all I can say is I really want to try more gueuze style brews ASAP to see if something else might be even better!"
"Mouthfeel: light bodied, citric"
"Consistently the most balanced of the Gueuzes. Has a wonderful subtle (for a gueuze) citrusy acidity. Quite complex, with changing notes of barnyard, oak, and a funky mushroom type flavor. The beer is quite dry, but still has a subtle sweetness that adds to the overall aroma. Musty and sour, with hints of enteric. At first it is sourly citrusy, then the mustiness and enteric comes through. There is almost a hint of orange in the taste. It finishes with a bit of astringency (think of black tea)."
"This is total sour candy. One of my all-time faves for sure."
"Really could use a bit more carbonation to lighten the initial palate and provide some more balance and even more length. Very drinkable. My personal choice is still Cantillon, but this comes close. Thanks to Hanssens for continuing to produce this gem!"
"Honey orange color. Aroma is Vinous, barnyard-ish with a touch of cheese. A medium bodied gueuze, sour and tart while also fruity and sweet. It initially very sour and tart, but gives way to a sour fruitiness (apples, peaches and cherries). Vinous and barnyardy. Nice gueuze. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is very dry. Aftertaste is tart."
"Cork smells of wild lemon zest with some sweetness. Gold yellow look with some haze and a fluffy white sticky head on the pour out of the green glass. Active bubbles in the goblet. Weet old gym bag smell with some bitterness (acidic) in the sinus. Very good lookin' in the goblet. Feel the explosion (sting) of taste on your first sip. Upfront taste of fruity wild yeasts surround your tongue this is then kicked up a notch by lemon bitterness. There is a slight mellow sweetness in the finish. As you continue to sip the the inital sting dissapates and your tongue snuggles up to it like your two year old just daughter just before bed time. Musty, fruity, sweet, and rounded. Very dry, tart, white grape tinted. Softish medium lively mouth. A crafted beer. I could not drink this beer all night due to its dry nature."
"I must admit that this was my first non-fruity lambic. Thanks to Kluk for this bottle. Poured a hazy orange/golden. This beer simply looks sour. Smell is funky and reminds me of old gym socks and my old summer job at the horse ranch. Interesting. Taste is over the top sour. After I got used to it, I really liked it. Lemony sour, but also appley and very acidic. Methinks this is a good introduction to this untamed style of beer."
"***Highly Recommended***"
"750 ml gree bottle with SB 07 on cork. Pours a golden yellow with a good head, that recedes quickly to a fine line. Very fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is of over ripe grapes and apples, sour and musty. The taste is like whoa! Sour apple pucker factor, saliva glands kick into overdrive. Knees start to buckle, eyes cross, and just when you think please no more, some cloying sweetness creeps in for the finish, almost but not quite like drinking champagne. Very enjoyable."
"Hanssens has really been impressing me ever since I tried their Oudbeitje strawberry lambic. Very champagne-like both in appearance and mouthfeel. Poured a golden orange color with a lot of fine bubbles. Leaves a trace of tartness on the lips as it enters the mouth. Nice sweet undertones help take the harshness off the sour acidity. Had a hint of what could have been grass. Very dry."
"pours out an apple juice gold, bronze notes in the light. pretty foamy, large and lively head. mega musty aromas, tart fruits...lots of green apple notes. flavors of fruit tarts.....in your face puckering and mouth watering. you can faintly make out the barley malt base, but with the queen of tarts running roughshod all over your tongue, it's hard to make out any real malt flavors. fruit flavors run rampant. finishes dry as a bone. clean and crisp. damn snappy. i have limited experience with lambics or gueze lambics, but i found this really tasty and enlivening. refreshingly tart. i'm thinking this would be a great warm weather treat. fiancee liked it a lot too."
"This lambic poured a nice golden color with thin white foam and good carbonation. The aroma was tart: sour green apples, come citrus. The taste was very tart, almost sour: apples and musty grapes dominated. The mouthfeel was very tart (almost too tart for my tastes, though it did grow on me). There was good carbonation, and a decent lingering flavor. The drinkability was OK. I am still not a big fan of Gueze lambics, but I am getting to like them a little more each time. I think this one would drink better in warmer weather."
"One of the more beautiful beers I've ever seen. The body is a clear amber with a peachy-pink tint. The head is easy forming but not impossible to keep under control. It lasts amazingingly well and sheets the glass beautifully. The aroma is not overly funky. I pick up more fresh fruit than horse blanket, but there's enough there to make me think of being outside while eating peaches and smelling the earthiness from my parent's garden on one side and a different type of earthiness from the horse pasture on the other. A little rotting wood (actually not a bad smell, it's omnipresent during any walk through the woods). The flavor is bright and very tart. Their's juicy fruit gum backed by an apricot smoothie and organges - clementines maybe. The tartness makes this refreshing but at the same time slows you down while drinking. It's almost like it's forcing you to relax and enjoy it."
"It comes in a 375 ml bottle with a cage and cork. It pours a somewhat hazy gold with a hint of peach. The smell is sour and acidic and will curl the nose hairs. The Gueuze deal is growing on me. The tase is absolutely mouth-puckering. Tart fruit, apple or lemon-soaked pear (huh?) sticks to the lips and tongue. Musty flavors are also in the mix. Next time I need to pair this with some cheese to make the experience even better."
"Hazy peach orange hue, topped by an initially thick head that steadily settles into a thin layer of loose froth. Tart, acidic fruit upfront in aroma gives way to a pungent waft of musty hay and damp horse blanket. Mellow hints of oak and cheesy, aged hops are present as an undertone. Trace note of meaty and sweaty, enteric fermented organic nitrogen. Assertive, nearly pucker inducing lactic tartness seizes the palate at first, then loosens slightly to allow expectedly tart notes of unripe kiwi as well pseudosweet balsamic laced acetic tartness to emerge. Mild woodiness and hints of grainy wheat emerge mid palate, adding depth to the overwhelmed malt character. Light in body, with a spritzy, lively mouthfeel. As CO2 dissapates, the mouthfeel becomes slightly creamier, revealing token residual dextrins. Finishes dry yet long, with a grainy, bready, and slightly chalky dryness fading into a lingering, but clean acidic tartness. Oude Gueuze is tremendously refreshing, tart and assertive overall in character. The complex tinge of mixed acid fermentation from enteric bacteria doesn't go unnoticed. While further aging won't tame the tartness, it may bring out the subdued woodiness that added richness. Delicious."
"Yes indeedy, one bottle of this caused me to wake up with a headache this morning. I had to change the drinkability score from 4.5 down to 3.5"
"Lovely!!!!!! True lambic, balsamic earthy nose, very smelly, but in a good way. Palate was complex, sour, earthy, balsamic, and kind of reminded me of a really good salad dressing. refreshing aswell. Slightly mouth puckering, but well balanced and for the most part dry, despite a hint of tart sweetness, god damn lovely. True hardcore lambic."
"Now my sinuses are clear. I wonder how the Horseradish eaters among us might like this great beer?"
"Pours a clear, deep golden orangish color with a huge bubbly, champagne like head that settles down eventually.  Smells of some slight grass clippings, musty basements and the inside of a barn.  I swear if you close your eyes you would think you were in the cobweb strewn basement where this is fermented.  Extreme dryness and some cheek puckering tartness.  The only taste that can even be said to be near it would be some extremely tart apple cider.  Light on the tongue and very refreshing.  There is also some more of that musty basement in the flavor.  Excellently bitter and tart.  Extremely easy to drink and extremely tasty.  I cannot say enough about this brew.  They say you either love gueuze or hate it, count me as one of the first group.  This is one amazingly complex and awesomely tasty brew.  A big thanks to thelongbeachbum for his inspiring gueuze articles and his excellent recommendations."
"Huge on the rustic barnyard nose with a hint of butterscotch,and this might sound crazy but slight cheese on the nose.Very  tart pineapple taste with sour finish,good representation."
"This is not real beer!! However, excellent appearance for a Belgian. Nice relatively clear brew. Apple cider-like flavor with a subtle whiskey-like, and yeasty after-taste."
"Notes: A most delicious gueuze, and a fine replacement for any champagne or something to enjoy on a special occasion. I just love beer and its infinite diversity!"
"Fruity and tart with a complex dryness, throughly enjoyed this brew with a cheese and bread snack in Brugge."
