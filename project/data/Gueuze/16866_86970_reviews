"O: Very nice, this is tasting great on this 90 degree day afternoon, thirst quenching, a balanced beer with a nice sour tart funk goodness up front, some nice fruity flavors in the middle and finishes really good with a slight oak flavor and nice dry finish, good beer but at $20 a bottle I might need to reserve this beer for special occasion."
"O. This has all the same characteristics of a traditional Belgian geuze . A very good sour. I certainly recommend this beer to sour fans."
""
""
"Beautiful execution. Color is golden with a hint of brown (assuming oak). Smells of lemon and grape fruit with a hint of oak. T:Again citrus at the start, following with oak and ending in tart goodness. Light body and carbonation is just right, makes it very fresh."
""
""
""
""
"This was a nice surprise."

"Mouthfeel: it  tastes a lot fuller than it looks. it almost looks a little watery after sitting in my glass a while.  but the mouthfeel is medium bodied IMO.  Definitely could drink a few of these on a hot day."
"Overall this is a very good sour beer.  I would def buy this again but not regularly.  I am not sure how much everyone else paid but I paid $20 for 1 bottle.  It's a bit steep in price but very good.  A once a year purchase when you can find it."
"Mouthfeel is very dry, somewhat gritty. Overall, pretty good."

""
""
"I will admit, I'm definitely a sour beer drinker, and I picked this one up on a whim. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I have had other sours with this baking soda like flavor, which I'm not a fan of, but the other flavors of this beer are actually pretty good. I pair this with chicken Picatta. It gets an 85 from me which is great for a sour!"

"A lot of grass / hay on the nose along with the expected stinging citric and a very distant tart vinegar, taste is strong on the dry citrus, doesn't pop upfront with the tart /sourness...it is present, but not overwhelming.  Mostly lemon tart.  Finishes with some latent acidity, similar to Duchess but not as lingering."

"Overall, a pretty good beer and worth having at least once. The beer is a bit tarty and may not be for everyone, but this is definitely a must have for tart fans. I've never had a gueuze before the style seems to be pretty good and I'm glad The Bruery is taking chances with old and rare styles such as this."
""
""
""
"Flavor is very citric and lactic, pretty tart!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my top five sours!"
"Cloudy orange-yellow, thin bubbly head. Aroma of acidic lemon, sourdough, dirty funk. Taste followed the nose pretty much, lemon, grapefruit rind, yogurt, malt vinegar, oak, Sprite, moderately sour, but more in an acetic way. I don't know, just kind of messy and unbalanced."

"Loved this....nice and tart. First time trying this style of beer and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Can't wait to try more."

"Another amazing sour from Bruery . Even though gueuze is listed in the description , it's not very salty . Great tartness , carbonation and mouthfeel"

"bracingly tart offering from the bruery. rueuze provides a blend of barnyard hay and lemon on the nose, with pleasantly sharp acidity as the brew hits the tongue. carbonation is light, and what bubbles there are tiny and vinous.no head what so all.  long finish that brings out more of the rustic side and the oak of this blended sour ale. would pair nicely with offensively pungent washed rind cheeses like epoisses or ardrahan."

"Pour at a tasting. Light straw body. Sourdough aroma. Taste sort of like a granny smith apple. Just starting to like these tart beers.  This one was pretty good."

"750 ml bottle, 2013 Edition, looks like the bottling date is 09/10/13.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with an inch off-white head.  Head retention is decent, and there's a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like apricots, funk, vinegar, green apples, hay and some lemon peel.  The taste is nice too, with apricot, funk, green apple, bready/grainy malt, hay, vinegar, lemon peel, and earthy flavors all noticeable.  It's nice and tart!  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's refreshing and has a good amount of carbonation.  I liked this brew, certainly wouldn't mind buying more of this in the future."

"Taste:  Yeast, pineapple, some green apple, and plenty of tart."

"Overall, very nice blond sour, should I say gueuze, sessionable at 6% ABV."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/10/2013. Pours slightly hazy bright gold color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, leather, musty funk, oak, pepper, cracker, light wheat, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, musty funk, leather, oak, pepper, cracker, wheat, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of fruity/vinegar acidic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon peel, green apple, white wine, vinegar, wet hay, herbal, straw, grass, musty funk, leather, oak, pepper, wheat, cracker, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great crisp malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately acidic, and slightly bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome gueuze style. All around great complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Overall - Not very good. Nothing resembling a gueuze. I realize it's their ""take," but I was hoping for some of the positive characteristics."
""
""
""
"EDIT: As if this review wasn't long enough, I just wanted to say I'm bumping the taste and overall rating by a quarter point. This beer truly is phenomenal, and one I could drink until my tongue dries out. I just can't get enough of it. Every sip is as good as the first. I'll likely be back to adjust some scores as I drink more from the style, but right now, this beer is tasting absolutely unbelievably awesome."
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable because there is a moderate to significant amount of complexity to the flavor of this beer. Not so tart that it is hard to drink but certainly not a beer that you would drink real quickly, one to be savored and enjoyed. Definitely worth grabbing, not as funky as some of the others in the style but a very nice drinking beer."
""
""
"Poured a wonderful cloudy golden color with a half finger of white head. It looked fantastic and very true to style. Scents of sour barnyard funk, green apple, apple cider vinegar, sour cherry, sour citrus and citrus peel and light aromas of oak and faint vanilla. A with wonderfully layered aroma with a true to style bouquet that is appealing and wild. Flavor begins delightfully sour with notes of sour, wild Brett, lemon juice, sour raspberry and sour green apple. This moves into a sour middle of sour green apple and sour barnyard funk. Finish is dry and sour with a wonderful flavor of oak, sour green apple, sour raspberry, sour Brett funk, and lemon juice. Aftertaste is sour with notes of raspberry, sour green apple and oak. A wonderful flavor profile that is dry, sour, fruity and complex. A fine geuze. Mouthfeel is light bodied with effervescent carbonation and a puckering, drying feel. A good, refreshing mouthfeel. Overall this is a fine geuze. It is sour, fruity and complex in aroma and taste and combines with a refreshing mouthfeel to make a fine geuze lambic. Quite nice and highly recommended."

"Hazy, golden pour with head reducing to slight lacing. Aroma is primarily sour lemon with some funk and sweet malt. Taste is bright sour fruits (primarily lemon and apple), oak, grass and a bit of subdued funk. Quite tart and fairly acetic in a similar manner to Hannsenns oude gueuze. Finishes with a lemony zing which is very gueuze-like but there is a malty sweetness that is un-gueuze-like. Active, creamy effervescent carbonation lends a nice mouthfeel to this light-bodied beer. Overall this is a very nicely done american sour ale that has held up well with almost a year since bottling. Refreshing, tasty and very sour! Recommended."

"Pour is transparent golden amber with a small amount of tight white head. Nose has a good bit of hay, light wheat notes, hints of lemon, lacto, notes of vinegar, and some off plastic notes. Taste has a bit more vinegar and a decent bit of lemon, faint wheat notes, fair amount of lactic acid, not the burn I was expecting from them. Moderate carbonation, lighter body, lingering musk."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Wow is all I can say. I love The Bruery and was expecting this to be awesome, but it absolutely blew me away and exceeded every expectation I had. Honestly, my taste buds are telling me that this is a nearly perfect representation of the Gueuze style. MUST try for all sour/gueuze/wild fans."

"Overall: This is an absolutely fantastic beer. I would recommend this to any of my friends who enjoy sours, though perhaps not to those who do not. I'll be brewing a sour blonde in a few weeks, and I think I'm going to shoot for something like this."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a copper color with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma is full on sour complimented by soft grains. In the taste, sour traits and a great blend to add depth and complexity. Hard to discern between some of the better Gueze (or Gueuze) I've had. Well defined flavors of candi sugar, fresh lemon peel, oak, and healthy wild yeast tartness. Barrel aged brew with a soft dryness. Medium bodied, good sustain. Overall, this is as good as some imports, and the three batch blend gives it that authentic taste. Great beer!"

"This was a bit expensive for a lower ABV beer but wow it's a wild ride!"

"An impressive beer. Almost hard to believe this comes from America. But really not for the beginner sour drinker. Worth getting a few for the cellar."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a great take on the style and one I would pick up on the regular if Bruery distributed to my neck of the woods. That said, there are a couple other gueuze style ales that do distribute to my area that will likely continue to fulfill my sour fix."

"Maybe not traditional in style, and not as complex nor funky as expected, Rueuze is yet a tasty beverage in and of itself."
""
""
"O: This is *NOT* a proper gueuze, but to be fair, it's not trying to be a proper gueuze. As a regular sour ale, it's good if not world class. At the price I bought it for, there are other sours I'd go after first (even from the same bruery)."
"Read full review @ http://blogs.lowellsun.com/beer/2014/02/08/the-bruery-rueuze/"
"Pours a staw colored hue, slightly murky, with lots of effervescing bubbles. Thin, champagne-like head. Smell is very sour, with some grape funk. Taste is very tart, mostly lemon, lime, green apple and some funk. Mild fruity sweetness. Feel is light, very crisp, some astringency, highly carbonated. Very refreshing and champagne like in texture. Overall, an amazing tasting beer if you enjoy sours. I think this is my first Gueuze so I cannot comment how true to style it is, but overall, very enjoyable."

"Found two bottles of this cellared with a 5/6 case of mixed Jester King stuff. Lacks the bizarre funk of many wild sours – overall quite drinkable and, for me, a flavor-packed introduction to The Bruery"
""
""
"Cloudy golden-orange glow topped with only a slim ring of a head. Quality funky aromas of sour lime, lemon, apricot, wet hay, mineral notes, and general Gueuze-y stinkiness. Loads of really satisfying Lambic flavor...sour lemon, stone fruit, light woody funk, mineral. Acidic, but not too sharp or lactic. Easily drinkable, dry, puckering, lip-smacking goodness. I expect good things from The Bruery, but this really surprised me. On a night full of funky goodness at Sourfest, this was my favorite of the night and the only beer I needed a refill. I haven't tried this from the bottle yet, but I'd be less hesitant to fork over $20 now. Excellent!"

"Cloudy golden body – clear bubbly head, minimal lace. Very tart – a touch metallic, oak, chardonnay, sugars, lemon rind. Like a lemon warhead – wildly sour and much better than I was anticipating actually. Puckering tartness."

"O - With descriptors like damp sweat sock, barnyard, and pool toys, to the uninitiated, The Bruery's Rueuze might sound like an experiment gone horribly wrong but it's just the contrary! Like Champagne to the wine world, beer cannot be called Gueuze outside certain areas of Belgium but The Bruery has, in Rueuze, created one of the closest American Wild Ale clones of this classic and highly sought after style. From it's bright golden color to the invitingly funky aroma, this sour power beer has all of it's bases covered with exceptional grace and the best part is, this is one Bruery beer that makes it out into distribution! Hooray!"
""
""
""
""
"Excellent! Poured at a good temperature with a modest, foamy, cream-colored head that soon settled to an island and ring with a bit of lace. Color is a clear gold amber with lots of large bubble trails. Aroma at first is a very heady blend of many things including acidic fruit, fresh sawn lumber, olives, yeast, malt. Then a lot of that quiets down. Flavor’s much like nose, tart stands out but has just enough sweet to balance; almost no bitter, oak is in there. Body/carbonation are perfect. Finish is like flavor, is unusually drinkable for a gueuze, strangely a tad boozy too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a solid gueuze, not spectacular, but decent flavors and tartness"
"This beer was served in a taster size snifter and shared. Nice golden appearance. An aggressive pour yields little head that dissipates into a thin film. Some but not a lot of carbonation. Smell is amazing, like a nice champagne or chardonnay. Taste a first is nice but it dissipates quickly leaving nothing but a slight acid bit on the tongue. It's slightly funky and slightly sour. Not sure I would buy this again for the price. There are better beers more available for the price."
"The Bruery's take on a Gueuze, which is traditionally a blend of a 1 year, 2 year and 3 year old spontaneously fermented sour ales. The Bruery doesn't have make a spontaneously fermented sour ale, so instead their ""Rueuze"" is a blend of their 1-3 year old sour blonde ale. The added aging really allows some of apricot heavy, matured Brettanomyces character to really shine in lock step with the assertive, but not grating tartness. My only real qualm with this sour is that it finishes slightly watery."
"The Bruery Rueuze ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has nice complexities in the taste and is relatively easy to drink compared to other beers in the style because it isn't that funky."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Imho with the straight, aggressive sourness the beer drinks more like an American Wild than a Sour Belgian Blonde, but it's stellar in either case."
""
"Poured a golden orange with large head that dies at good pace and left lace patches. Aroma is mostly sour, funky and tart, but to be specific there seems to be a tart citric hop edge and/or some sour tropical fruits (something akin to pear or apricot or mango). I get some of this sour apple/pear and apricot/mango fruit feel and then also this sharp, crisp acidic citrusy sourness and a whole bunch of funk. Easy drinking, light bodied, has good amount of carbonation that leads to sharp finish. Pretty taste beer and a little sweeter than average gueze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A great take on the style. Not at complex as some but for what it is it's really good. Kinda of pricey but worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A really great beer. If I didn't know better I would think this came from Belgium. Great sweetness mixed with dry champagne-like body and feel. Worth the price tag."
""
"O - Not really familiar with this type of ale or how it's intended to taste, but I'm not overly impressed by this ale."
""
"O: an elegant drink, very tart and bright, heavy wet citrus and dry oak wood create a graceful and drinkable brew - if you can dig on a sour ale, and you dig on barrel-aging sour ales, then this should be right up your alley, provided you don't mind spending $20+ to buy a bottle."

"On a positive note, I have stopped buying limited releases for the sake of being limited, and focused more on proven quality beers."
"Overall: Not a true gueuze and there's no mistaking it for one, but still a good sour blonde ale. At $20 per 750ml though, if you're looking for a gueuze, you're better off going for the real deal."
"This gueuze lambic features complex layers upon layers of moderate sourness. The depth to this beer is impressive and each sip unveils new notes and subtleties. Citrus leads to slight spiciness leads to straw leads to honey. All of these blend into a warm oily slick that coats your tongue with a buttery finish. Fantastic. 86/100"
"O: This is definitely getting at the flavors of an authentic gueuze, but everything is a little too meek and restrained to really match the real stuff, or even better American blends like Resurgam."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent American take on a geuze, it's not really something I'd recommend trying more than once. Any good Belgian geuze would probably wipe the floor with it especially at its price point; just consider that you can find a 750ml of 3F Oude Geuze for cheaper and you understand my feelings on this subject."
""
""
"overall just a great american representation of a gueueze...i thoroughly enjoyed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not an authentic gueuze, but whatever it is, it's outstanding ale that I will be doing again."
""

"Another crazy sour bomb from The Bruery. I don't know how they manage to make beers this sour that are still palatable. It has no objectionable characteristics, but if I have to rate this as a Gueuze, then I must say it lacks some of the balance and musty complexity that the best beers of that style have. Nevertheless, for the combination of intense acidity and drinkability, it's hard do much better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
"7/10 sourness. Very good sour. The cherry notes surprised me. Got this in trade but think I will grab a couple around me."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with a small white head. In the aroma, dry and tart peaches, with some funky cheese. In the taste, dry and tart peaces, with a small lemon presence in the end. A small tart bite, but mainly smooth, with a lightly dry tart peach flavor in the aftertaste. Not much oak, just lots of dry tart peaches."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rounded, almost crackery and sweet malt up front and around the edges. Slight lemon sweetness before the tart and funk take over. Nice grapefruit and lime acidity and tartness. A little vinegar. Moderate earthy, funky notes as well. Sourness almost seems to peak in the finish, making for a very appetizing beer. Lingering lemon tartness, but there's also a hint of sweetness too. Moderate body with a lightly prickly, bottle-conditioned feel. Very drinkable!"

"Overall, very good. One of the best gueuzes I've had."

""

""

""
""
"(O)- I really dig this. Possibly one of my most favorite sours from the Bruery to date. A great sourness to it combined with a well balanced and rounded oakiness makes this a winner for me. Definitely makes me wish I grabbed more than one bottle."
""
"D: This was a great sour ale. Tough to beat the traditional Belgians of the style, but this was a good attempt. Delicate but bold scent and taste. The body could have been a bit livelier. The finish was clean but strong, so it must be sipped. Yum."

"Great piece of work. The oak contributes a nice roundness and softens the rough edges typically associated with sours."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a pleasant interpretation of a gueuze for an American brewery. I enjoyed the tropical aspects but pretty much hated the brine and vinegar notes that are unfortunately present in not only this but nearly all sours from the Bruery."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another solid beer from The Bruery. Their sours can be overly sour to some people but this one seems to be as expected for the style without being overwhelming. Very good and can stand up with Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze"

"O - Definitely more of a sour blonde then a gueuze. I had low expectations as I expected it to be a complete sour bomb, but I left surprised by it's clean aftertaste inviting you to take another sip. If more funk can be added in on future batches, this might become incredible."
"D - Nice gueuze. Well balanced with good complexity."
"O: Overall, this is a nice sessionable Gueuze that I think shows that the Bruery is making strides towards making a Gueuze that can be world class. Well done."

"O- not in love with this one. Pretty subtle flavors, not very loud, seems a little plain despite the ton of work that went into it"

"Picked up a 750ml of this despite the $22 price tag and my feelings about The Bruery because I just had to know how it stacks up against real gueuze. I suspected it would not and I was right. Appearance is orange, clear (let it settle for two months and poured it like a gueuze), and looks almost identical to Cantillon gueuze. Aroma is interesting, has a mustiness and a slight touch of minerals and copper that immediately makes me think of Cuvee Rene. Slight touch of body odor (no lie, sweaty), cereal and then ass (eww). The aroma is good at first but its not gueuze. I can deal with sweat and body odor but not ass. Super fruity flavor, sour, tart, tastes good but this is definitely going to stand out in a blind tasting as not being authentic gueuze, it lacks funk in the flavor and has a sweetness to it. I caught a sweetness in Duck Duck Gooze as well and I've never caught that in the real stuff. Overall I would not buy this again, its not fooling anyone as a gueuze but as a wild ale it was a good offering. Probably one of the better beers I've had from The Bruery (I usually avoid them)."

"o - Overall a very nice beer and cool blended American Wild. not as funky as Belgian gueuzes but the funk in the nose is very nice, and some very nice sour fruits. Glad to have a few bottles of this."
""
"Pours a cloudy golden color with just a hint of amber. There isn't much head on this beer. Lots of sour lemon and vinegar along with a bunch of oaky notes in the nose. There is a mild funk in the smell that doesn't show up in the taste. The taste is extremely sour, but it isn't funky. This is a very clean sour with notes of lemon juice and vinegar. The body is medium with a very dry finish."

"O: Extremely refreshing beer. I like tart things and this definitely hit that note. Did not seem to have a lot of complexity going on and was mainly focused on the tart. Was disappointed with the appearance as it was pretty average. Not an expert on Lambics/Gueuze but it is probably a average - above average take on the style."
"O- This isn't a bad beer at all, but it isn't a gueuze by a long shot. The sourness focuses so heavily on the vinegar aspect, and there really isn't much funk either. It doesn't taste bad in general though, and I finished a 750ml very easily, but as far as style and pricing go I would probably pass on this one."
""
""
"This beer is not bad but its certainly outclassed when defined as a gueuze. Its average in every way. Too bad when I pay $25+ for a beer, I expect it to be a bit better than average. I won't be revisiting this one nor any other Bruery ""Gueuze"" in the future."

"Overall great, great sour and tart fruit flavors and aromas, nice apricot and fruit middle that adds a great touch, little light on the funk for now but will probably pick up as it ages."
"O - Overall I was floored by this beer. Such a great flavor profile here with light sour apricot and faint barrel notes. Incredibly well done"
""
""
""
"This is a good example for the style."
"Appearance is murky yellow in color with minimal lacing as the carbonation is nearly non-existent. Strike one for a ""gueuze-style ale"". Little to no head and zero lacing. Aroma has a bit of citrus, in the form of lemon/lime but this is quickly squashed by the abundance of acetic acid and its dominance on the nose. Taste follows suit. It’s quite tart but not in a complex, funky, traditional gueuze style way, more in a ""oops I just squirted vinegar in my mouth"" kinda way. Mouthfeel has an unusual oily papery feel. That’s the best way I can describe it. Nothing about this is ""gueuze-style"" in any way other than it was a blend of 3 different barrels. This was a drain pour. One of very few in the past several years (the last one was also a Bruery beer). Overall, I was less than impressed with this beer or the price tag it demanded. This is yet another overrated, sad failure of a beer from Bruery. They, as of this writing, will no longer be getting any of my business."

"O - Very tart and citrusy, very nice and enjoyable."
"O-if you gave me this with out telling me what it was, i would tell you that it's a fine example of gueuze from Belgium. I'm surprised an american brewery, even The Bruery was able to get it spot on. Truthfully this beer is mouth watering. I could drink this so quickly and so easily."
""
"Overall: I feel like this beer would sit better with me if it were a bit sweeter, but it's not bad. Glad I got to try it but I probably won't buy again."

"Drank at Layne's UFC ppv (Dos Santos/Velasquez)."

"Considering this is like the fifth bottle of this I've opened since its release, I figure I should finally review it. Pours a hazy, golden straw color. Small white head...not necessarily head...more like A LOT of bubbles. Scent is musky and mineral-forward at first. A bit of vitamin mineral aromas with some nice funk and tropical fruit aromas. Sour stone fruits...apricots, peaches, and even some green apples come through in the nose. I also get some grape skin aromas. Smells like it's gonna be pretty sour. Taste is not as sour as I was expecting (this ain't no Mother Funker). I was hoping for something like Mother Funker, but with more carbonation. This one has the carbonation, just not as much as most traditional Gueuze have. Taste is quite acidic, with peaches and nectarine flavors. Slight tropical flavors with mango and pineapple. Funky, but not ""traditional gueuze funky"". Still very tasty. Mouthfeel is liking a bit. It could use a bit more carbonation... other than that, the tannic, sticky feel works well with this beer. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a decent attempt at an American Gueuze. However, it falls short of some of The Bruery's best sour beers."
"Gueuzes give me a warm, fuzzy feeling (and it's certainly not the alcohol). This is a good gueuze, but there is certainly room for improvement. It's nicely sour, tart, and funky, but it lacks the crispness that I seek in this style. Still, worth a try."
"A good beer. The weird vegetable flavor reminds me of Hottenroth and gets a bit distracting at times. Nicely tart, but still young and lacking the depth I would like to see with the style. Good, not great."

"i loved this, and surprised other didnt. as about as authentic as the style gets here in the usa. pours a washed out white hued yellow corn color, pale and cloudy, fine grained sediment floating, and a robust flashy white head two inches high. the nose is really sour. funky as hell, lemon and acid, wheat malt base. the flavor is also quite puckery, tastes old in a good way, mature i should say. very oaky as it warms, especially in the finish. maybe even more oaky than some of the authentic belgian versions, which i think cuts through the acid nicely while preserving the really sour character. easily one of the better american sour beers ive had, up there with the russian river stuff. effervescent carbonation is just right for the style, but maybe the acid is a touch high. i like that its lower abv so i can drink the whole bottle without a problem. i drank this in isolation, but i could see almost endless culinary possibilities. a truly divine brew. the bruery can do no wrong these days!"

"Big thanks goes out to the new guy who shared this during a recent Random Sunday Tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, brine, earth, citrus, and apricot. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, tart, sour, apricot, and brine. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I fully understand what the Bruery was going for with this one and I think they nailed it pretty well. This brew had all of the traditional characteristics of a Gueuze, but just not to the intense nature as some of them. The kiss of apricot was a nice welcomed addition to cut some of the acidic nature of the beer to make it more enjoyable. All in all a pretty well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again the future or aging to see how it develops."

"M: Medium but would be light with more carbonation."

"Shared by GT2. Thanks bro. The beer is golden hued and mildly hazy. The aroma brings classic gueuze scents. Barnyard, lemon rind, funk, oak. The flavor is nice. A bit sharp and acetic. Definitely American and not Belgian. Lactic and sour. Lingering fruity funk. Good stuff."
""
"O - Another decent sour from the Bruery. Not really a gueuze, drinks more like the blended american wild that it is. Either way, it held its own against some of the other highly rated sours we were drinking on the night."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a smallish bone white head that displays moderate retention and lace. Aromas of light citrus fruit with a bit of sweetness, think sweet oranges and lemons with apricots. A restrained sour and funky nose, but you can tell there's something lurking in the glass. The flavor is a bit more tart than the aroma suggested. Lemons, grapefruit, and sour oranges alongside pineapples, hay and a hint of light sugar. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart piercing mouthfeel. Wow that's a pretty good sour right there, I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid American take on Gueuze. I'd like to see the Bruery get the cost (19.99) down on this one, as I can find several imported Guezes at a lower price. In all, a solid take on the style."
""
"Interesting gueuze, one that is fairly true to the style, but perhaps a bit more on the savory side than a traditional one. Pours a vivid yellow with zero head, but luckily there is some carbonation. Very tart aroma, with some of those savory, almost salty notes, and a touch of peach. Not sweet at all. The taste, if anything, is even more savory- there is a pleasant brininess here, some peach and apricot, and a lot of tartness. Once again, fruity, but not sweet. Very smooth, almost lactic, not bracingly sour. Definitely a different interpretation, and quite successful."
"D - As a blended American Wild Ale this is a good beer. It's not really much of a gueuze though, as it lacks the appropriate flavor profile and feel to it. Still, a few of us had no problem finishing off a 750ml bottle. Would drink again if appropriately priced."
""
""
""

"Medium body, well carbonated, bubbly and dry on the palate. I found this a little sweet and plain for my tastes, plus it doesn't help that this was opened along with about 20+ other sours/wild ales. I also can't help but compare American attempts at the gueuze to Belgian varieties, which may not be fair, but this pales in comparison to something from Cantillon, Tilquin or 3F."

"O: very well done gueuze that had me wanting more. very well worth the try and glad to have had it multiple times now."

"B+"
""
""
""
"D/O: This wild ale features some authentic lambic qualities, mostly centered around the smell. The flavor profile starts out in agreeable fashion, but flails ineffectively by the midpoint. It seems a little young, and time to condition fully may alleviate the textural issues."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Improves as it warms,a good beer. Not worth the price tag for a bottle, but still a good beer."
""
""
"There's a nice level of sourness on the palate. Largely lactic, reminiscent of sour cream, with a touch of white wine vinegar, citus and unripe stonefruit. Carbonation is at a lower-medium level; could be a bit higher. Finishes with a strong lacto note that drops off quickly with little barrel or tannins."
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad American attempt at a Gueuze. A bit on the sour side, but I like a bit of pucker. A well made brew, but in the end, I'm not sure it's worth the price of admission."
""
""
""
"soft murky white with fizzy head that fizzled away fast with streaky lacing. smells funky. apples, pears, lemon, lime and grassiness. tastes like sweet tart crossed with lemon and apples. puckering. dry finish. overall really nice, but a bit heavy handed on grass and sourness for my tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was very disappointing and I am glad that I wasn't the one to purchase this and only had 8 oz to attempt to consume. I obviously was not expecting an authentic Belgian gueuze but this is pretty bad. It was rough to consume and I can't imagine this improving and I could see this become undrinkable in about a year."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and slightly funky and is of apricot and peach with an acidic aroma. Taste is much the same with a fruity and acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: another great bruery sour... If you like gueze or any sour for that matter, thisnisna must try, as are all the other bruery sours I've had to date, so derrricious, loft tart and refreshing, deffiantly grab this one if you can."
"3.0 D: This is another acetic Bruery sour. That's what it is. I predicted that before I opened it and, of course, I was right. Good enough."
""
"Paired nicely with a farmstead goats' milk cheese, Tumalo Pondhopper."
"Very nice beer. More like a Cascade style sour (American) than a true gueuze, but still a very enjoyable beer as long as you aren't expecting a Cantillon or 3F clone."
"O: An excellent attempt at a true gueuze (as far as I've tried from the Bruery) and a beer I’ll try to keep on-hand. Really nice."
""
""
""
"Mouth- A"
""
"O: A really good 'gueuze' style ale. The acid does not get to vinegary which I've found in a lot of The Bruery sours. Well worth a try. I liked this quite a bit."
"Overall: I wasn't a real fan of GFAR, (I thought the flavor profile was good but muted) but I am a fan of this one. Good beer."
