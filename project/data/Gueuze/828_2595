While it is a touch milder/sweeter than some of the others I've had that also has a nice balancing effect on the tart sourness and the funk.  So this would be a good one to share with those new to the style.  That said, I think it might have scored a bit higher were it not for the fact that my expectations have been shaped by having had several other Gueuze's before this one (e.g., the Tilquin, Cantillon, Hanssens, DeCam, etc.)","drtth","Mar 22, 2015"

It is interesting how the bready sweet malts make that lemon lime flavor add a slight orange flavor to the beer.  I want more sourness and funk with less sweetness from my gueuze. It was a good beer to try once and it makes you appreciate how well that Drie Fontienen, Cantillion, and Brouwerij Girardin brew and/or blend thier respective gueuze.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Jan 18, 2015"

Smell is funky, a bit lactic, fruity with notes of green apple, acidic notes similar to fresh lemon juice, a bit of barnyard, smells like it is going to be quite sour. Taste is a mix of funky and fruity, musty basement, lemony citric acid flavours, tart towards the finish, mildly sour in comparison to what the nose sugested, dry throughout and into the finish. Medium dry carbonation, medium bodied. Probably one of the easier drinking geuze I have had perhaps owing largely to the freshness of the bottle, I'm sure with time this will become funkier but it is quite nice so young already.","peensteen","May 22, 2014"

Scent is sour, with heavy lemon juice and barnyard funk with a very slight bit of bubblegum. Good, what a geuze usually has, but with a slight hint of some saison traits. Taste follows, sour, lactic and lemon mostly with some slight grassy flavors and some sour green apple in the background. Good and sour, like a geuze should be. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall this is the best of the three geuzes I've tried. It's more sour and dryer than Lindeman's Cuvee Rene and it has more character than St. Louis' Geuze Fond Tradition.","Auraan","Sep 26, 2013"

Aromas of big sour apple, pear, lemon, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, grass, leather, funk, white vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of estery/funky yeast notes with barrel character. Taste of tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, grass, leather, light vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Moderate fruity/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, hay, oak, grass, leather, light vinegar, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/funky ester flavors with moderate barrel character; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very crisp, dry, moderately prickly, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Gueuze. All around nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with high carbonation. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 23, 2013"

It pours the color of pale canteloupe flesh with a shade of soil to it. It lets very little light pass through at all and has a very uniform haze. There's a good amount of fizzy head that leaves no lacing on the glass. The smell is good. It has that expected farmland funk to it, but no so overbearing as to destroy all the other scents. There's definite sour cherry and some champagne flavor on the nose. The taste is pretty sour which is very good, even to a hop head like me. It's tasty and puckering and very active on the tongue. Very fizzy. The taste is sweet too, like a fresh peach with a sour cherry pucker to it too. Very good beer overall.","estlinska","Mar 20, 2013"

There's lots of complexity and sour depth. It's a very nice gueuze aroma on the lower end of the funk spectrum, not that there's anything wrong with funk. Taste is a bit less complex but still quite good. It's dry and sour with a tannin finish. Oak and mild funk throughout. Mouthfeel is softly effervescent and mildly bracing from the tannin and sour.

Nice and tart with a degree of brett that is a little over powering for me with a chalky and bicarbonate addition. There is a bit of hay and soil with a lemon zest and acetic and lactic acids. I'm surprised how subdued the sour is in this one. Thin bodied with hi carb and dry finish - standard. This is not a great gueuze for me. Not tart enough and a little too much brett.

Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that surged out of the top of the glass and eventually subsided to two finger VERY slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon zest, lemon rine, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, lemon rine, earth, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I bought this one on simple fact that it was one of the top rated of the style on BA. I figured if I want to call myself a true fan of the style, I need to try as many of these as I can to be able to gauge my review. This one definitely did not disappoint. All of the right flavors and aromas were there with a nice touch of different lemon components to add another layer of complexity to an already solid style. Really well done and I would highly recommend it to anyone who calls themselves a fan of Gueuzes/Geuzes.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

It did not fare well with a few of us who did a blind tasting of gueuze last year. In fact, we all agreed that the considerably-cheaper (and often not-as-well regarded) Cuvee Renee was better. And we're not exactly inexperienced lambic drinkers... We all correctly recognized each of the 5 or so gueuzes at the blind tasting by the smell. Anyway, it's also a big step down in complexity and general enjoyability from Cantillon, 3F, or Tilquin. So, if you have a choice, those three are definitely worth the extra cash.","shleepy","May 10, 2012"

The funk is nice and I swear the brett is powerful in this. It's overly carbonated so drinks light and fizzy. You would have thought that this wine glass is laser etched. The flavor is a little short lived. It's sour but it doesn't resonate and is somewhat quick to fade. The beer is pretty light and drinks quickly.

The taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like tart apple, white grapes, lemon peel, and some funk and wood.

The taste also starts with a bit of funkiness underscored by a sharp and slightly acetic taste that mellows through the finish. Tart in the mouth, and although it mellows through the finish it never becomes soft. On the other hand, it's not piercingly sour like some either. I suppose it depends what you're looking for.

The taste has most of the same characteristics as the smell. Pretty sour upfront, lemony, small hints of orange peel, with a strong tart finish.

Taste: like shoving a big wedge of lemon in your mouth, a tad vinegary, vinous, musty and slightly spicy. A little more than light bodied, aggressive carbonation.

If not for these latter notes, this would be world class and elite. As it is it's a great geuze and wonderful in its sourness. At $7.99/12.7oz. bottle it's waaay pricey, so try it if you see it, but the price brings down the drinkability for me. Excellent.","SolomonGrundy","Sep 25, 2010"

Aroma is mainly lemony acidic sourness with a faint smattering of tropical fruit and a clear oak presence. Brett is subtle but comes through as a slightly chlorinic note. Flavor really isn't that sour for a geuze but there's a solid unripe citrus character that finishes rather watery. Dry and woody towards the back of the palate.

The nose is quite nicely oriented toward lambic fruitiness with both citrus and cherry/cranberry notes, as opposed to the funkier orientation of other gueuzes. Flavor is less tart than typical lambics, thinly bodied, with a dryness that accentuates a comparatively bitter finish that evokes grapefruit and citrus zest. Either fresher hops or a lot of barrel time is at work here.

The beer is light-to-medium in body, with a spritzy carbonation. Nice, and incredibly easy drinking!","Suds","Feb 15, 2009"

Can't have the best of both worlds, alas, as the aroma at the same time turns duller without the clear and pleasant structure when fresh. Maybe this bottle is still young? But all in all this old geuze is truly impressive, one of the best I've tried, with good potentials to age.","wl0307","Feb 02, 2009"

The taste is very light on the sourness compared to most others gueuzes with more lemon zest and slight acidic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light body with a perfect carbonation level. This is a very drinkable gueuze and would be a great beginner gueuze to introduce someone without giving them the overpowering funk that might turn off a first time taster.

Presents itself as a medium golden honey color with a slightly rocky, cream-colored head that is not very deep. Retains well, however, and leaves rings of lace in the inner rim of the vessel. The nose is all gueuze - wet hay, grass, musk, and a subtle fruitiness intermingled with earthy spice notes. Quite pungeant, especially when given a swirl in the glass. You really need to stick your nose in this one. The palate follows suit, offering a very sweet/tart beginning, with the taste rounding out to accentuate notes of white grape, candy sugar, honey, and balsamic vinegar to name justa few. This beer turns very dry, very fast. Incredibly complex, as a gueuze should be. Mouthfeel is medium, with terrific carbonation levels and good control of acidity. Lingering tartness finishes this beer exceedingly dry, like a good dry white wine. A fine example of the style, and one I'll return to again.

Smells of leather, cheese, bread, feet, under-ripe fruit. This bottle may be a bit off because there is a strong note of cardboard in the taste. Otherwise, tart lemonade and cereal grain dominate the flavor, along with metal, hard water, grass, musty cheese, salty prezel, and perfume. Tartness is undenyable, but tastefully restrained. Finishes dry, as anticipated. By now, the carbonation has lost it's vigor and the beer seems old and flat, and the skunked taste isn't helping. I will get a fresher bottle and compare them.

4.23,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Taste: This beer has a world of flavor. As it was cool, the flavor was a bit one dimensional toward the lemony citrus, so it went down a bit like fizzy Lemonade. As it warmed, all of the flavors are coming out. It would be impossible to pick out any one sense that is getting bombarded by this beer more. It is remarkably balanced, and somehow leaves the palate feeling sweet and sour at the same time. You have to take your time with this beer, but it is worth the wait.","SkeeterHawk","Jul 22, 2005"

Almost an orangey lemon tart as well. The flavor is nice. The tart sour is up front, but moves quickly to a slight sweet and light graineyness. Very refreshing. The feel is moderate with an active carbonation. Overall, a very nice beer. Another fine beer from our friend that speaks with the ferments.","kmpitz2","Jun 22, 2005"

Pours a nice copper underneath a 1 finger white head with a furry of champagne like bubbles. Nose was a little more subdued than I was expecting. Sure there was a nice acidic bite and a small amount of funk but it's not nearly as aggressive as some of the other gueuzes that I have enjoyed.

Lactic, sour smells mixed with a bit of greenhouse and old leather. Tastes a bit similar to Boon gueuze in the fact that it's a bit sweet, more fruity and honeyed, for a gueuze. There's a small amount of horse blanket farmhouse funk to it, just enough to tie it all together, but I was expecting a bit more for some reason. I wanted my tastebuds to be assaulted. A nice subtle, cheesy hop flavor finished off a lightly tart and mostly malty gueuze. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, I just wished I'd been assaulted with salivary gland dryness.

And not the lambic type of sour. Rather, the unappealing sour of a rotten apple. Not vinegar sour, but veggie-like sour. This beer's not good. What a shame.

4.04,0.2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Cloudy amber (I may have decanted some of the yeast, but I thought I was careful). The head is thin and fleeting. The first burst of the aroma is the smell you get after having just bitten into a green apple. Under that is cheeze and hay that has sat in storage for too long. The apples carry into the flavor, but instead of the green apples, it changes more like a cider apple. Very fruity, but theres not the harsh sour punch I was expecting of something like Cantillon. The tartness here is a part of a balanced, but complex, flavor instead of the dominating characteristic. A very drinkable gueuze.","aracauna","Jun 23, 2004"
4.26,5.7,5,4,4,5,4.5,"Cheers Matta for the trade Appearance first strikes as displaying an intense carbonation which feeds a huge foamy white head, very rocky, perfect white and amazingly long-lasting for a sour beer. The body is a cloudy yellow, darker the more yeast is in the glass, champaign alike in terms of bubbling. Bursting and evolving aroma with excentric nuances of old basement, barnyard, dust and lots of bret character. As it warms up, I start to notice more and more a blue cheese character which is very appealing. Not unlike a white wine, white grapes bouquet bursts and at times will even display peaks of pears and orange. In mouth, it is rather cidery with tart apples and brett funk. The finish is very dry, extremely white wine alike, moderately astringent. Mouthfeel is superb, uniquely airy with an incredibly soft carbonation, intense all the way through, but perfectly regular with gentle fine bubbles like a champaign, creamy and superbly pleasant. As stated so many times before, its a shame that such a good beer, a classic perhaps, will undoubtedly be bound to disappear from the face of earth in the next couple of years. The texture is legendary.","Rastacouere","May 23, 2004"

Starts out sour and tart then kind of blends together and fades away. Complex but still smooth. I am shocked at how easy drinking this is. I don't know where I am getting this from but something almost bitter hits you in the middle. I have had the other beer from this brewery (Kriek?) and I think I prefer that one to this.

Poured into a Chimay chalice, the gueuze was a murky and glowing yellow-orange color and was topped by a thick, persistant, and fine off-white head that left blanket-like lacing. Vigouous carbonation was observed through the sides of the glass. The nose was moderately sour and lightly wooden, with notes of fermented apple cider and esters of granny smith apple. The taste spoke of a mature and wizened mellow oaky tartness, which held numerous deep and intriguing subtlties. Suggestions of must, oak, earth, sour apples, prevaded throughout...wonderful. It finished dry and quenching, with lingering sour apple peel notes. This beer was very fluffy and bouyant, which paired very well with the flavor profile.

Smells sour, woody, slightly of urea, lemony, with some musty mushroom character. The first impression of this Geuze is one of sourness with a hint of sweetness. Quite sharp tasting, it cuts through everything. Tastes of tannin and of hay fields (if that makes sense). The body is quite light and refreshing. As my mouth gets used to the acidity the taste softens, I get notes of citrus and slight alcohol, and lot of funky geuzeness.

The taste was tart but not overly sour. Flavors of musty grapes, apples, oak, and a hint of hops came through. The body was medium-light, and the mouthfeel was clean, crisp, and a bit puckering, with moderate carbonation feel. This was a nicely drinkable geuze -- light and refreshing like a champagne.

Big tart fruitiness is everywhere in this bier, rather tasty but not quite as tart and acidic as I would ideally prefer. The tartness makes this brew have a great crispness that goes very well with the medium-light body.
