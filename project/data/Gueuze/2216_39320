The beer is almost completely still- just the barest wisp of carbonation. For a style like this, that doesn't bother me. Complex flavors here. Tart, bitter, lots of umami notes that go one and on- mushrooms, loam, pine needles. Slightly metallic and woody at the finish. Very smooth, no slickness at all, which is nice because of the low carbonation. Delicious and complex- a cerebral sipper.","Georgiabeer","Aug 02, 2014"

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sour, it smells like funk, lemon, tart apples, wood and some earthy/mustiness. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some hay/grass. The tartness isn't quite as strong in the flavor as compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I liked this, but maybe I should have aged it longer before drinking it.","bluejacket74","Mar 30, 2013"

Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, wood, tart, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, wood, fruit, and lemon rine. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like how this one is doing with this much age on it. There is still a ton of nice things going on here and it appears that the funk aspect is developing. I could honestly see this one developing for quite some time. Glad I have quite a few of these stockpiled in my personal cellar to try out their aging potential.","thagr81us","Jun 29, 2012"

A slight haze to a orange colored beer. Gueuze' aren't exactly supposed to look pretty. Even with low carbonation the smell is quite intense. An appealing mix of oak and Brett yeast character. Really appealing. Taste is similar to smell. Heavy presence of oak and ending with bright sour yeast flavor. Ph. is piercing and exciting to the palate. I like the lip puckering quality. The lack of carbonation makes it surprisingly smooth and quite drinkable. Body is thin as expected. I'm really impressed with the range in the mouthfeel. Soft wheat start -> oaky and sour kick -> lingering peppery Brettanomyces. I find this bottle to be perfectly aged for my palate.

Hazy, orange-ish amber. The aroma is comprised of some lemon, citrus rind, and dusty cellar, horse blanket. What I am looking for isn't there, nose stinging sour high acidic notes. Nice taste, not outstanding. Lemon, sour citrus peel, and a good dose of funk. Some additional dusty cellar, in the end this is a one dimensional gueuze. A full body for a sour, and wheat-y. I swear I had this several years ago and it was labeled an un-blended lambic, I think it would have faired better as such.

Poured into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish.

It sat still, lifeless in my snifter. The aromas aren't quite what I expected. It is very sour, and very dry. That's about it. It kind of smells like a very dry cider and is kind of musty. The flavor is kind of hard to explain. It's sour and doesn't really give hint to what fruit or what flavor of lambic that this comes from. It's kind of bland. And when I say sour, I mean probably the most sour beer I've ever had. Being a five year old bottle, I expected it to lose most of the carbonation but this has absolutely none. It's kind of flat. Being my first gueuze, I'm not sure if this is desired or expected. It had the mouthfeel of a light white wine. This beer had good sourness but perhaps I should've looked for a younger bottle because it wasn't complex whatsoever. It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it. This particular gueuze just wasn't for me.","aasher","0"

A very tart, somewhat sour flavor to begin with, definitely some lemon, citrus, some acetic acid makes its way to the palate as well. Has a bit of an acidic burn as it hits the back of the throat, nice earthy and smooth aftertaste to mellow things out. Very light on the carbonation, dry in character, and fairly light bodied. This is my first tasting of the style, and in my opinion, it grows on you. At first I was a bit surprised at how tart and sour it was up front, but there really is a whole lot going on once you get past the initial characteristics.

Moderately tannic on the finish, there's a blend of grapefruit juice, lemons, vanilla and oak along with a funky bouquet. Medium-light in body with the blend of juicy acidity and tannins lending heft and structure to the palate, this beer is mildly carbonated.

Lots of sour apple, followed by over-ripe dark fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is over-slick. this thing just dies in your mouth.

Orange peel, earth, wood. The body is almost still, and it's very smooth and easy to drink. Tons of flavor given the overall lightness, and frankly I wish the bottle was larger.

Pours a deep golden color with no head and no cloudiness. The smell is strong. Pick up sour pears,lemons,orange peel, horse blanket,funky cheese,and wet band aid. The Brett does little to hide its flavor. Up front you get a strong acidic orange peel taste,competing with just a dash of semi-sweet pears, followed by the funkiness of Brett doing its job by imparting cheese and vine to the flavor. Finishs very dry with sour lemons and funkified wheat. Not nearly as acidic as some I have had, but enjoyed overall. Will buy again for sure.","rivertrance420","Nov 05, 2009"

3.23,-20.8,2,4,3,2.5,3.5,"For me, this beer was something of a mixed bag. From a 375 ml bottle, it pours a cloudy burnt-gold color. The beer is completely still...zero head. The aroma is interesting, though. Lots of horse blanket and funk. Brett and a little malt. Not a tart smelling brew, though. The taste also ins't as tart as I expected. It's got some slightly acidic notes, but it falls way short of being sour. This actually makes the beer quite drinkable, but the lack of sourness seems to leave the brew a little hollow. The mouthfeel is really compromised by the lack of any carbonation, leaving the beer with a flabby body. In the end, I wasn't really impressed with this one.","Suds","May 16, 2009"

On hitting the tongue you immediately feel the tart/sour flavor biting in, yet it is not unpleasant in the least. The mid palate brings to mind a very self preserved flavor, reminiscent of slightly pickled vegetables, citruses, and, strangely enough, sea water. As opposed to other reviewers, this is not a beer that I personally would find to be well suited to having multiple servings, it is one better appreciated over a while, and I couldn't drink it too fast. To each his own though, I suppose. The tart/bitter flavor became a bit overwhelming if I tried to consume too much in one drink, or multiple drinks in a row.","volanova","Jan 07, 2009"

My pour showed a sedate lack of CO2. It was warm golden color with no head or lace and a taste like tart, unripe fruit - sour but not puckering.
