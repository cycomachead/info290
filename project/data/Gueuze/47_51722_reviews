"Overall this was a great collaboration between eight lambic makers in Belgium, exceeded my expectations, will probably get better and better with age, my bottle had a best by date of 2026, so eleven more years will probably turn this into a whale for a true sour beer lover"

"Very nice geuze with a heavy influence of oak. Fun to see all the breweries blended together. Expensive bottle though."

"The nose is funky, a little cheese, sour, wood pulp.   Citrus and lemon.  The flavor follows the nose, more lemon, citrus, goat cheese, floral hops.  It is very tart, lots of funk, bitter.  The finish is very active, poprocks down your throat.  Very good beer."

"All those different inputs, as originally opined, must have some kind of middling, blending, and in the end, neutering effect, a concept which is evidently on full display here. Distinctly drinkable and approachable for the style (mere price taggery aside), this 'Gueze [sic] Tour' is exactly that - an introduction to the whole shebang, all at once, in a mildly dumbed-down, touristy incarnation. Doesn't mean it doesn't taste good, IMHO."

"A great Gueuze that may not be better than some of it's individual components. Yet it surely delivers on many of the facets you expect from the best examples of the style. Super funky, bright, and a good level of complexity. Maybe a bit too aggressive with the lemon on the palate. Very nice nonetheless."

"Overall: A really nice gueuze. Nothing to go crazy over trying to obtain, but definitely worth a try if you can get it relatively easily."

"OVERALL: This is a solid gueuze that perhaps doesn't get enough credit. What was surprising actually was that all the vintages were relatively similar. The '09 was perhaps the best, but there's no reason to believe that the '11 and '13 won't be there in time. Very consistent. Glad to have been able to try this set at once. Cheers gents!"

"No problems taking down the big bottle solo and that's not common for me among sours. I paid the same price for A&T so all things considered I doubt I'd stock up if I had the chance but I'm happy to have tried it"

"Full bodied with soft carbonation and tart, puckering sourness that lingers over the barnyard/ lactic funk flavors, oaky tannins, light fruit and citrus acidity into a tart, dry finish.  Very nice sour element by not harsh or overly acetic.  Crisp citrus/lemon juice acidity countered by earthy oak and lactic cheesiness.  Sweaty with dry, funky bugs, lemon spritz and a lingering soft acetic flavor that makes me drool for more.  Very refreshing and easy to drink considering the complexity and level of sourness."

"4.0 D: Solid all around. A bit pricey, but such is the style. Definitely worth a try and a not a bad beer to stock up on either."
"O: A very nice, balanced geuze - not too unique, but very tasty and refreshing."

"Overall I enjoyed this Gueuze but it by no means is the best I have ever had. I am not sure of the price but I can't imagine it was cheap. For a style I don't gravitate to or often seek out, I can say that there are better examples which I hope to eventually have again, but this is not one of them,"
"Flamboyant and complex, with the odd harsh aspect, but great overall."
"O - Top class Geuze that is balanced and offers plenty. The body and carbonation are the highlight."

"Pours into the glass a murky amber color a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of sour and tart fruits, a bit of caramel and vinegar with a solid does of must and funk. The flavor is a hint of caramel sweetness up front that is quickly devoured by tart cherries and lemons. Lots of acid and a hint of vinegar with a mild amount of funky flavor. Crispy bubbly mouthfeel with a light to medium body and a solid shot of carbonation. Very nice geuze, quite complex, I wish I had a bottle or two to hold onto for a while."
"O: This beer was outstanding. If you can find this beer drink it."
""
"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some woody and slightly fruity aromas. Taste is much the same and has an acidic quality on the finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some solid aromas and flavors that make it easy to drink."

"Bottle shared at the May 2012 iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Golden color with a white froth. Lemons and stone fruit, citric earthy without too much sourness. Smooth and drinkable -- definitely not an enamel-melter -- mild by gueuze standards but still very well put together. Oaky bretty finish, hefty body."
""
""

"Pour is pale yellow, lively carbonation and white bubbly head.The nose is very funky, tons of cob web with a nice rind like aroma. Hints of sweet lemon but very light. The flavor adds more balance and much more sweetness. The webby funk is decent, more sweetness with a light peppery spice. Peaches and a touch of lemon with a fairly sour spike to it. The mody is creamy and syrupy, decent carbonation and fairly dry. Very nice stuff."

"2011 vintage. 750 ml bottle poured into small tulip. Cloudy straw, gold in color, small white head. Earthy, funky, horse blanket aroma. Some sweetness in aroma along with almost a salt aroma. Taste is puckering, tightening on the jowls. Not as sour as expected. Sticks to the back of the tongue. Interesting and tasty blend."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. It had a ton of complex flavors and the desired dry finish. All in all a very enjoyable gueuze. Thanks for sharing this one Kramer."
"Sharp, lactic hay, straw, lemon zest, citric bitterness, just a simple nature. It's bright, its jumpy, its lingering sharp."
""
" the taste is very acidic at first but gets tropical and has light and mellow lemond rind in the background I get a mild wood tinge in the taste which adds to the complexity of flavor. The wild yeast does contribute significantly with light sour elements and more of a dry herbal element throughout. Overall I liked this - a huge gueuze with tons of complexity and has a very drying finish with plenty of funky character."
""
"The palate opens with a pretty huge sourness, very grapefruit-like with some lime character as well. There is also a moderate amount of tannins here, along a rather strong lactic note. There is also flavor reminiscent of acetic acid/acetone, but not quite. The upshot is that the sourness is harsh, and lacks the finesse of some of the better gueuzes out there. Not as musty as the nose would suggest, the funk is mostly a blend of hay, and some mushrooms. The wheaty, cereal sweetness does appear in the mid-palate, strongly reminding me of the Lindemans Cuvee Rene. The mouthfeel is a bit confusing - it's mildly slimy (like a baker's egg wash), but highly carbonated, sweet yet dry, and also a little alcoholic, and a little too tannic for my palate. The tannins enhance the sourness and the harsh qualities of this gueuze. The high ABV makes this a little hard to drink as well. Not bad, but not going out of your way to try IMO, and drinking an entire bottle only emphasizes its flaws."

"Not a bad gueuze, but not worth the price."
"Quite amazing, every well balanced. If you see it, get it. Lots of fun to fun."
"Bottle. Pours a cloudy apricot color with a nice fluffy white dense head. Nice lace. Peachy, fruity aroma, slightly white wine like. Starts with a nive sourness that then builds to a slight bitterness note. Light mouthfeel. Overall, I was surprised a little at this one, on one hand it is pretty tasty and easy drinking but on the other I find it lacks a certain depth seen in other Lambic. I like it but wish it hand just a little more something to it."
"Tastes good but again, fairly simple. Lemon, tannic oak, slight grassiness. Bit of maltiness, too, though it's largely dry. Pretty spritzy mouthfeel, light, mildly tannic finish. Certainly enjoyable, but it didn't leave a strong impression. You'd expect more depth from a lambic blended from so many different sources."
"An incredible blend. I'm so glad I got to try this."
"Had this side by side with the Cantillon Classic Gueuze and I'd have to say that I prefer this to the fresh gueuze. Funkier and with a more complex flavor profile. Feel ties everything together nicely too. Would love a bottle of this to age for a couple years."
"O - Definitely not as sour as the 2009, but has more balance and will be a better candidate for aging. It seems like Armand played a big part in this blend because it was very similar to the 2010' DF geuze we opened next to it."
"Overall: Very nice refreshing geuze, will develop into an even better one over time for sure."
"Very refreshing. Quite drinkable."
"O: A decent gueuze, but not really amazing, especially for the price/difficulty of acquisition."
"Shared this one with the NC guys during the 'We Want The Funk!' tasting graciously hosted by beermeX2! Big thanks goes out to cwguy5 for picking this one up for me while he was in Belgium! 2009 Vintage! Bottle #11382! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a golden yellow orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sour, funk, tart, wood, and slight must. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great beer. It was a really big hit at the tasting and was a few peoples surprise of the night considering the company of beers present this was saying something. Both the flavor and aroma were screaming with notes that were quite appealing and pleasing to every sense that could pick them. My only gripe would be that it wasn't the prettiest beer I've ever seen for the style, but what can you do??? A definite must try for anyone out there if you have not. So good I am going to be looking for a few more bottles of this along with the 2011 to put in my cellar for awhile."
"Overall while not my favorite sour I have ever had, it is up there."
"Overall, a nice gueuze that surprised me. It was pretty tasty and easy to drink. I'd recommend this one."
"750ml bottle thanks to grownfool. More orange than yellow with a good foamy head. Smell was slightly sour, dusty citrus, good. The taste was also very good but did not have a lot of horseblanket or barnyard, mostly sour citrus with a slight bit of phenol and rubber on the backend. This was so damn easy to drink, quite good. I had read that this gueuze was not so great but I disagree, this was a very good gueuze."
"D - We crushed the 750ml bottle quite easily. It gets extremely dry and tannic, but otherwise it's quite easy drinking. I might need to get another one of these for the cellar, as I can see it holding up for the listed 20 years."
"I was excited for this one, and it didn't let me down. As other reviewers have noted, age helps this round out."
"Overall -- HORALs proves that Americans aren't the only ones who can make a lackluster collaboration beer. Nothing particularly spectacular about this gueuze, and the over-carbonation is horrendous. The top lambic makers of Belgium put their heads together and came up with this?"
"Pours a moderate golden-yellow color with some visible carbonation. Pretty good white head with a touch of lacing. The nose is mega funky with a really nice barnyard presence and a bit of hay. Really strong in everything. Mild diaper and rubber in the background, in a good way. The flavor continues along the same route with quite a bit of complex funk. Light to medium body with a very dry finish. Quite a good brew. Thanks again, Matt."
"d - A nice tart gueuze; I liked the smell a lot. Would like to have again."
"It lives up to the aroma. Beer is bright and light on the palate. The sourness hits you almost immediately and carries through to the tart finish of the beer, oh so wonderful. The finish isn't too dry but it is dry. Would I drink it again...ummmm...yeah."
"D: Not a bad sour, but not earth shattering."
"D: A fine example of a gueuze. I look forward to acquiring some of this delicious beer for the cellar."
"D - A real sipper for me, but this was a great beer I'd love to drink regularly."
"This is really good and worth trying."
"A pretty solid gueuze blend, not better than all its components, but maybe about the average of them."
"Cheers!"
"Big thanks to Dave for sharing. Much more cohesive with more depth, it tasted like Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. Bright citrus up front, sour but well balanced, pleasant dry woodiness on the back end. Great stuff."
"Light straw colored clear body, good carbonation, small amount of quickly dissipating head, not much lacing. Nose is pretty funky with a bit of stone fruit, a bit acidic, complex, and nicely balanced, no noticeable hops.. The taste is insanely complex due to the 'mega' blending, I had a hard time picking the different components, but overall some leather, a bit of horseblanket, face puckering sourness, a bit of tartness, good dose of salty goodness, and a lot of wooden character from the aging vessel, no hops to speak of. Fairly full mouthfeel for style, real good effervescence. Real tasty, though I wonder if this 'mad experiment' would taste completely different the next time."
"Overall, great brew and a pleasure to have sampled!"
"D: A nice gueuze. My only real gripe is the price to quality ratio. The regular offerings from Cantillon, Girardin, and Drie Fonteinen are superior in nearly every facet."
"Flavor is bretty up front and has an oaky vanilla sweetness building up to a lactic sour aftertaste. Not completely dry, I can see the brett developing this beer into something really great in a couple of years. The taste is not as complex as the aroma yet but the carbonation is lively on your tongue. Carbonation might be getting in the way of this one."
"Drinkability: While not outstanding, this is very, very good and would pair well with food. Great blend."
"Drinkability: Going down fairly easily. This one isn't bad by any means but it needs more time to develop for sure."
"An extraordinary bottle shared by emaineiacman at SMBDC meet-up in May, brought back from Belgium. One of the most exquisite & unusual blends of 8 of Belgium's best lambic brewers. Dry, woody, great aroma of mustiness, deep orangey color, long-lasting tart finish, respectable head. Has been on my life-list for awhile, and can say it is very much worth the effort to procure if gueuze is your passion."
"Stone makes frequent references to fizzy yellow beer, and this one fits the bill. And at 12.50, it doesn't even have the benefit of being cheap."
"Bottle: Poured a slightly hazy golden color gueuze with a huge foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of light acidity with some oak and lots of tart notes. Taste is not as complex as I would have hoped but some very nice notes of oak with some well balance acidity and sourness makes this a very refreshing drink. I thought it lack some of the green apple notes and barnyard aroma of gueuze. I will not necessarily seek this one out again but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Definitely liking this gueuze, got this one for free in a LIF which makes it even better!"
"D: Good. Would guess this one would age gracefully."
"Really stinky sour cheese scent. Incredibly funky, with some unbelievable tart lemon. There is an incredible cherry scent that I have been picking up a lot lately in some of the better wild yeast fermented beers I have had. I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass. The taste mirrors the scent perfectly and is incredibly tart. This really blended together well. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated but a little bit too sharp which works against the mouthfeel slightly. All in all, an excellent offering."
"I am so glad that my bottle has been cleaned of all the diacetyl that has been troubling some peoples bottles. Pediococcus is a prodigious diacetyl producer and Lambics definitely need time to reduce it back out. I am so glad that this turned out to be quite tasty. Man this is quite good, about as tart / sour as I could want with just enough funkiness to keep things interesting. This is a fantastic example of a Gueuze, at least this particular bottle is; if you are too worried just hold on to these for a 6 months or so (perhaps the international shipping helped my bottles)."
