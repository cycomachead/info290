"Not one of the hyped gueuzes but it hits the points of the style and is really drinkable. I guess I would knock the boldness and complexity which are lacking but def worth a try for lambic drinkers and it's usually on the cheaper side."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a fairly foamy (3/5) and slightly smooth (2/5) mouthfeel. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness remaining on the palate and lips."

"Cheers!"
"Overall: Needs more intensity in funk, sour and flavor"
"Pours a somewhat-darkened golden color with a good white head and just a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose has some restrained funk and some earthiness. Acidity is light-to-moderate. A bit of citrus, but not too much, a la Tilquin or Cantillon. Flavor is similar. Body is light and carbonation is a bit low. Not enough funk or acidity; it's a bit lacking in character. An interesting gueuze to try, but not among the best."
"O: A very drinkable Gueuze, perfect for a non-initiate for instance. Well done in this extent but lacks a bit of personality."

"The beer is hazy and light apricot hued. Hay, funk, citrus, oak. The delectable aroma translates to the flavor. A really tasty beer. Well balanced and easy to drink. Pleasant tartness and a really fantastic oak character. Relatively high carbonation. Overall, really solid. I hope to have this again. Thanks Matt!"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy slightly dirty orangey color lambic with a nice foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light green apple with some light barnyard notes and some light tartness. Taste is easily drinkable with notes of green pale and light acidity with some tartness and very light oak notes. Acidity and barnyard notes are well balanced and not at any important level. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Well made with great drinkability factor thought not as much character as some of the heavy-hitter."
"A damn good gueze. Surprised and impressed with how balanced it is."
"O: A subdued gueuze, but quite drinkable despite not being especially complex."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a really enjoyable beer with its clean refreshing aromas and flavors and the background of musty (funky). I enjoyed drinking it and would be quite happy to have another bottle. Indeed, I think that this would be a fine Gueuze for the table and enjoyment with a meal and good friends. My overall impression is of a well-made, enjoyable beer that is of good quality but which may not be the best example of its style to show off the style in a tasting or competition. Given that the best by date is 18 years into the future Iâ€™m harboring a slight guilty feeling that I may have just had this beer much too young."
"Doesn't live up to the aroma unfortunately. Beer is thin and heavily carbonated on the palate, there is almost nothing initially except for some carbonic burning and then a lemony tartness followed by the mild acetic and lactic ness. The last little bit is some oak and a minor funk. It was good and got better as it warmed up, I really enjoyed it but it could have had more pronounced flavors given the awesomeness of the aroma."
"Very glad I got to try this beer."
"D-seems a slightly oxidized and the flavor profile doesn't seem all there. the funk was present but the balance was lacking and it was so dry and hay like."
"D: Easy drinking and fairly refreshing. Not as complex as the best representatives of the style, but by no means would I hesitate to try again."
"Perfect golden hue with a fluffy white head. I can tell this has high carbonation. Aroma is bretty and lactic. A little too straightforward for a geuze. Taste is light with a mild acidity but holds a heavy brett flavor. This geuze is very carbonated which makes it quite refreshing and drinkable. This may hinder its flavor a bit as it tastes somewhat one dimensional for the style."
"Drinkability is ok, but it's not really my taste, the soapiness really is what detracts, although I do love the smell."
"D: A very nice example of the style."
"This is a solid example of the style; it definitely could use more Brettanomyces & other wild character and it needs more carbonation, but it is quite an enjoyable brew."
"Overall a decent example of the style. Nothing special here though, moving on to the next gueuze..."
"In the end, good."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a sweet gueuze."
"Not bad at all."
