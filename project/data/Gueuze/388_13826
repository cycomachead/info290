Pours a golden-orange hue with a frothy, bright white head that dissipates into a sudsy slick.  Clarity is semi-hazy.  Nose is musty and expresses citrus zest and cork.  The taste on this beer is very good, but not mind-blowing given the ratings.  I get cork, citrus rind and citric acid; however, nothing really stands out.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a pleasant astringency.  Overall, a solid gueuze but not my favorite Cantillon.  Perhaps a little more time in the cellar was needed?","Jwale73","Jan 17, 2015"

As of late, this, Zomer, and Duck Duck Gooze are my favorite among the "style". Could drink this all day, everyday. Mid-palate is full of complexity while the finish is a lot cleaner.

4.94,9.8,4.75,5,5,5,4.75,"750ml corked and capped. The belt and suspenders approach. A 2010 vintage. Normally I'd talk appearance first but the moment you open the bottle there is this fantastic vinegar wood sugar smell. Pouring it into the glass I get more candi sugar, lemons, apricots. Nice, nice, nice. The pour is a hazy gold with a very active head that settles into a nice creamy layer and then leaves just a hint of lacing. Taste is absolutely incredible. It starts with an orange lemon citrus flavor, then a nice chewy sour followed by a woody dryness. There is a LOT going on in this beer. The aftertaste is almost vanilla and very pleasant. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and then almost sticky. Very nice and adds to the overall feeling of substantialness. Overall, what can I say, this is definitely one of the best gueuzes I've ever had, hands down.","roblowther","May 30, 2014"

From the basket, it pours a hazy, glowing, light orange with a fizzy white head dwindling down quickly from the acid. Aroma is massive white grapefruit, blood orange, sweet orange sorbet, peach, subtle funk. Very fresh and rich blood orange dominant. As it warms you are rewarded with mace and wet cinnamon stick. Taste is dried grapefruit, pomelo, lemon tart, lactic fattiness. Bitter white grapefruit and pomelo come in to balance the sourness, but there is just nowhere near the balance and freshness I get from 2005 Iris or Russian River Beatification. Palate is uber mouth watering, so lactic sour that it is near lacerative (I had to drink most of the bottle myself unfortunately). But in small quantities the palate is fresh, fruity, and soft. Really so beautiful. Bound to age extremely well.","tarheels86","Sep 18, 2013"

Aroma was fairly mild, notes of funk, horseblanket, and minor touches of acetic/lactic acid. About the same in the taste, mellowed-out with a few years of aging, fairly oaky, funk, hay, lemon, apples skins, cobwebs, wheaty malts, again, minor acidic notes, but nothing too tart or overbearing. Light-medium body, and decently drinkable, I just really don't like the oak/wood quality in this beer; I think it clashes with the other flavors too much. After having the Classic Gueuze first, I definitely liked this one better than that. I've had the Classic before, but it was nice to be able to compare these two back to back.","Rifugium","Nov 02, 2012"

Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, lemon zest, funk, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, citrus, sour, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. The Lou Pepe treatment really added a nice touch to this brew. There was a nice citrus/lemon aspect going on in this one in both the aroma and flavor. This made it really easy to drink and balanced out the sour and tart characters going on. Definitely worth trying if you have not done so.","thagr81us","May 26, 2012"

A nice cap of bright white foam that leaves some small streaks on the glass that glide down not fully sticking. Whoa, the musk on this one is undeniably old Gueuze. Big scents of oak from the longer time in the barrels, wood, lemon zest, hay, barnyard funk and sour bugs. It's really bold and that's what counts. Taste is off the charts, a deep sour that is large yet not tounge reducing. Swishing this around the mouth really does wonders. Tastes of old wet wood/oak with a blast of earthy tastes from the barn including hay. Citrus is on the lemon side with trace orange. Malted barley makes a appearence at times but don't look for it to save you from the sour attack that grandpappy is. Feel is light bodied like most gueuze, highly carbonated, fizzy and a bit scorching on the tounge after a few sips. Puckering is a understatement, a bit acetic on the end.

I can taste some light citrus flavors, maybe lemon or something similar. I don't get much from the oak barrels, maybe the wild yeast just dominate the beer too much for these nuances to come through. Overwhelmingly good, this is top shelf with no flaws that I can find.

The cap had done its job, and the beer was effervescent, clear, and Champagne like. The smell was very mature and ripe, and the aging seemed to have taken a lot of the funky edges off. The smell reminded me of fresh squeezed lemon juice or a cider made from green apples. Taste was very dry and sour with no hint of any sweetness that might have ever been present. A little bit of hay and cheddar were apparent in the taste as well. Despite all this acidity and complexity, it was smooth and refreshing, and not harsh at all.

4.77,6,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is a review of the 2000 Lou Pepe Gueze, which I had a few days ago. This bottle looked fine from the outside, but under the foil was the scariest cap I have ever seen- completely rusted through. It showered by counter with black and rust-red metallic dust and debris when I popped the cap and just crumbled completeely. The cork underneath was a grayish black. I feared the worst but decided to clean the top and carefully pull the cork. Luckily, it was only the top of the cork that was discolored, the remaining 4/5ths of the cork was perfectly fine and sealed the beer very well. There was a popping sound when I uncorked the beer and some not excessive foam. The beer was fine! It poured a nice somewhat cloudy dark golden into a chalice, with a surprisingly good head for its age that settled to a ring and stuck around for the duration of the beer. Just okay lacing. The smell was a little faint by now, but exhibited typical barnyard aromas, a whiff of lemon, and a hint of brie cheese. There was also an underlying acidic apple smell, sorta like a scrumpy. Not acetic, but mild and pleasant. The flavors were just wonderful. Perfectly balanced tartness (not acetic), barnyard flavors, perfectly ripe cheese, a touch of wood. Everything was seamlessly integrated and oh so smooth and subtle. This beer has been considerably mellowed by aging, not in your face at all. Extremely enjoyable. The mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, and refreshing. I could drink this all day. Wonderful to see that its still holding up.","Georgiabeer","Nov 24, 2006"
4.65,3.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"The cork is dated 2004, so I'm guessing they aged this at the brewery? Clear, pale peach. Respectable collar of tight, white foamage. Incredibly fine bubbled. Actually laces on the glass pretty well, which I find unusual for a lambic. Nice and funky aroma. Pungent crabapple, stilton and aged swiss cheese, and bottom-of-the-haybale funkiness. Very acidic, with a citrus tint. The flavor opens with softened, silky carbonation. Really, really nice. The beer just glides along on microscopic bubbles. Almost immediately tart, with little to no sweetness. Mostly a cheesy kind of funk, with heaps of lemon juice and wild crabapple. Definite bleu cheese going on here. Moldy and dank. Just about everything including the kitchen sink going on in here. Almost gamey at times, then a bit of sweetness can be detected. Lots going on here. So dry it could be called arid, stripping my palate of any and all moisture. Very sharp, though in a more refined way than the regular Cantillon Gueuze. Nicely aged, with a very elegant, urbane feel. If you believe any wine can compete with this kind of complexity, I've got a bridge I'll sell to you for a real bargain!","UnionMade","Nov 04, 2006"

4.05,-10,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The sticker on the bottle says 2002. The cork is too mangled to really tell what that last number is. Hmmm. The first thing I notice about this beer as opposed to Cantillon's flagship gueuze is less carbonation. Pours a bright, vibrant orange, with no head to speak off, but little gatherings of bubbles. Smells rather typical for Cantillon. All the usual suspects are there. Big and funky, lots of Brett out front here. Citrusy, zesty, dusty. Taste is more subdued than much of the Cantillon line, which I like. Definitely tart and sour, plenty of granny smith apple and lemon rind, but it's mellowed a bit here. I'd really like try one that's even older and more curmudgeony. You can't really taste much sweetness, but I can pick up on the difference between this beer and their normal Gueuze which has a younger lambic in the blend. This one is much softer, in a word. There's something to be said for the younger and wilder punch that the regular gueze has, but this one allows for more complex tastes to shine through. Lots of must, dust, and mold, almost as if you could smell the cellar and the barrell(s) this beer was aged in. It does sweeten and round out a bit as it warms. More funk as well. The softness on the palate combined with the acidic bite really makes this beer come together. Takes a little while to drink this one, but that doesn't exactly translate into a "low drinkability" for me. It's something that should be appreciated at whatever pace suits it best. An impressive beer for sure, from the experts of lambic.","twelvsies","Nov 06, 2005"

It has been stashed in my "cellar" since then. Now that I'm in England (and getting seriously bored with English ales), I decided to dig this one up again. I'm both glad and disappointed that I did. Glad because this is just a fantastic beer; disappointed because it is the only bottle I had. Oh well! That's the problem with beer, I guess, you end up drinking it.

Because of that, I think this is a little bit more mellow than the normal traditional gueuze. It pours a clear gold with a slight orange tinit and a spitzy head that dissipates fast. The aroma is musty with some horse blanket, a sourness, and floral and honey notes. It is sour almost mouth puckering, with an almost vinegar like acidity and slight taste of apples , yeast, and some barnyard and dirt.

This is quite lemony and not as funky as some Lambic derivations. The brettanomyces character is pretty subdued, but there are definite musty-leathery notes here. A bit of vinegar adds to the acidity. The beer finishes with a slight tannic astringency, which seems fairly typical. My only complaint is that perhaps this bottle could have used a bit more complexity. The good/ variable thing about Lambic is that the next bottle is likely to be quite a bit different, so perhaps my complexity is hidden in the next bottle.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

This gueuze is a dark golden colour with a lovely effervecence and quite a head of white foam. The aromas are of dead skunk, funky drunk, horny monk, scared skunk, a hostel bunk, and some junk in my trunk. The taste follows through with a blast of traditional gueuze lambic tartness and all the traditional farmyard flavors. Their is a dry fruitiness that makes this gueuze very fruity, without having any fruit in it. The mouthfeel is quite acidic, tart and sharp, just as a good gueuze should be. The only flaw this lambic has, IMO, is its softness. Compared to an unaged or aged sample of Cantillons 100% gueuze lambic, this lou pepe gueuze just isn't as sharp, tart, or enamel stripping as Cantillons flagship is. Still, this is a a classic gueuze with a wonderful drinkability!","francisweizen","0"
