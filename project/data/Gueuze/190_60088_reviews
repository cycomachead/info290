"Notes from 2013: Sampled one of these again from 1999 - probably overrated this one a bit but didn’t take proper notes so I will leave the score for what it is. Still not a bad one esp. compared to the new stuff."

"So! full of character. It was a bit overwhelming and a good beer to split. Would gladly enjoy again. "
"This is really my type of Gueuze; bracing sourness, extremely funky, so complex, yet so light and spritzy. This beer captures quite well in its character why I love Lambic so much. Surprisingly, this blows the 3 Fonteinen that a friend is drinking out of the water."
