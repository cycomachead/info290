"Heerlijk zurig met een zweem bitter."
"After having waited for this for a while, I'm a bit disappointed in the result. This beer is too sweet and the funky, oaky, woody tartness is almost completely missing. I'd revisit an older vintage just to make sure there's nothing here but otherwise, the black label is strictly better."

"Bottle 375ml. Clear golden pour with decent white head. Aroma is (too) light barnyard and leather, hay but mostly green apples. Light tartness and wood, sweet apples and leaf. Nice carbonation. Lacks authenticity.but still enjoyable. A shadow of the Black label."
""
"Deep orange colour, fairly dense ring of white head, some lace. Smell is of cheese, quite funky, a bit of blasmaic and wine, quite acidic witha bit of lemon to it as well. Taste is funky with a sour/balsamic flavour, tart apple skins, lemon with a dry acidity, malt flavours with a dry acidity. Medium carbonation, medium bodied. A fairly nice gueuze, the nose is a bit off putting initially but overall it's quite drinkable."
""
"Hazy reddish brown, voluminous white head. Great lace and light retention. Nose of old cheese, woody, earthy, malty vinegar and white wine. Taste of tart apple juice, lemons, dark bread, malty and although still cheesy, is less so than the nose. Denser and maltier than I had anticipated, tartness is medium. Cheesier than I would've liked, but still interesting to try."
""
"O: Definitely not my favorite, and a disappointment compared to black label. Drinkable, but not pleasant."
"OVERALL: Very different than the others in the style. The added sweetness really didn't do this any good, as the resulting ginger is quite off-putting. Not something I ever want to lay eyes on again. Easily the worst of the lineup. Was glad to introduce this to drain."
"Dark orange and transparent with a big creamy white head that rises above the liquid about two inches. Scattered lacing. The aroma is of lemon, barnyard, and a light mustiness. It's really toned down from the Black Label. There's a little oak. The flavor possesses a simple lactic sourness with a mellow tartness. Lightly oaky and citric with a little leather and barnyard, but the filtering seems to have stripped this beer of positive attributes and turned it into Gueuze light. The beer is lower medium body with high carbonation. An okay beer in its own right, but pales in comparison to the Black Label."

"Thanks Eric for the opportunity to try this!"

"Overall this beer can be best described as simple and good but not great."

"Overall: Not my style but on the better end of it."
"Light body with crisp carbonation and mild acidity. Decent enough, but nowhere near what the black label is."
"O: So THIS is what a real gueuze (albeit filtered) tastes like! A very “mature” step-up for me in my gueuze education, that’s for sure. Not crazy sour like the Cantillon Bio. Definitely something I see myself breaking out on special occasions. Would definitely work well as a before or after dinner drink… or even during dinner drink, who am I kidding. Can't wait to try the black label to see the difference."
"O: pity one; weakest geuze I know."
"Finish is bright green spice, sour lemon/lemonade and undertones of funky honey. Nice beer over all and a great flavor profile for food."
"Overall: The filtration didn’t improve the beer, the refermentation process in the bottle (making the beer more acidic) clearly is missing here. Still a very decent geuze."
"O: An odd ball. Not likely to revisit for a while, especially given the superior Girardin Black."
"The palate opens quite sharp, quite unlike anything I was expecting given the nose. Super sharp, very sweet lime-like, almost artificially so with some grass. In this regard, it's unique - I've had grapefruit or lemon forward gueuzes, but this sweet lime flavor is the first that I remember. A little sour cider is present as well. Again, there's quite a strong cheesiness, but the fact that this is filtered takes away from the complexity, making this aspect stand rather alone without really lingering. Light in body, this finish crisp, along with a little aspirin, a little floral character, particularly, some rose. Solid stuff."
"This is a very approachable gueuze that I wouldn't be afraid to give to a lambic virgin."
"Overall, it is a pretty good gueuze. Nice drinkability on this one. Similar to the black label, but it had distinguishable differences. I am glad I got to try this one."
"This is not a hard or aggressive Lambic, but neither is the Black Label, the acidity is quite refreshing (though may be a bit challenging for the Lambic initiate), and the funkiness is fairly restrained compared to some. This makes for a ""clean"" Gueueze that still seems to be chock full of traditional Lambic flavors. An interesting beer, some of the character was quite unexpected (the dark color, the ham in the aroma and the oxidation overall); I would guess this is directly attributable to the filtration and non-bottle conditioning, but am not 100% sure. This is certainly a far cry from the excellence achieved by the Black Label Gueuze, though it is certainly still enjoyable. I am quite happy to finally be drinking this bottle, it is something I have wanted to try for quite some time, but have lacked the necessary motivation to actually try and track down. I will likely never get one of these again, especially if any other decent Gueuze is available."
"This beer was really smooth, incredibly for the style, and would be easy to get quite a few down in a night as it is not overly acidic."
"Thanks Kevin. Poured quite a dark, clear amber. No yeast in the bottom as this is filtered unlike the Black. Nose was sweet and sour, some toffee that I initially characterized as butterscotch. Sweet notes were held in check well by all the funky, sour elements. Sour in the mouth but with a sweet quality that most of the other sours we sampled did not have. Sweetness came of as toffee mostly. More malt than a traditional lambic. Medium low carbonation, thin body. Cider-like at times."
"This filtered gueuze appears a clear, orange hue with a white, foamy head that has great staying power and leaves an ample amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of sour and funk, though more muted than in a 3F or Cantillon gueuze. The beer is fruity and has a very present sweet flavor to it. This is quite unexpected. The beer is very bright, with a balancing act of sour and sweet. The funky barn flavor is there, but it only has a co-starring role. There is a pleasant sour green apple flavor to this beer. The feel is decent, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. The finish doesn't make me pucker the way I was expecting (and hoping). This is a good offering, and certainly a bit of a departure from the norm."
"The beer is super bright on the palate, tons of carbonation in the mouth. There is some tartness / sourness to it but its also sweet. In the juxtaposition between the two Girardin beers, that's what stood out the most to me. Its quite good, my wife loved it, a great novelty, but the black wins in my book. I would definitely drink this beer again in the future and I have more of it so I am looking forward to that. A very nice and interesting gueuze but be aware that this one is sweeter than you'll expect. Kind of like a baby faro, not nearly that sweet though."
"D-very sweet with some issues, one dimensional and a little cidar like. had next to some tasty gueuze and was the least complex of the group and just was too sweet."
"D - Tried this one in a line up of other sours, and I wasn't too upset when my glass was finished and we moved on to the next. Still a very good beer."
"Pours into a basic bar tumble a crystal clear gold that leans toward yellow with a white, airy head. Retention is decent but it eventually settles to a pretty lacing. Aroma is quite bready with plenty of green apple, touches of gym socks, and a lemony finish. Quite crisp and refreshing with moderate tartness and sourness that doesn't nearly reach that of the Black Label. Flavor follows the aroma closely with small amounts of barnyard, apple cider vinegar, and a bit of grapefruit at the end. Quite pleasant and drinkable, though I prefer the intensity of the Black Label."
"D: Not a bad gueuze. Clean and refreshing, easy to drink. Not as demanding or assertive as some gueuzes, not as sweet as others."
"Had a bottle at the Troll Cellar in Ghent. This is very different from the Black label and well worth dirnking side by side. But the black is a more typical ripping gueze. This is totally different and a big change of pace with low tartness and more bready, cheesey flavors instead of sour fruit. Definitely worth a try."
"Taste is super puckering with more of that cheesiness. Woody. Super balance in this once, there's a nice maltiness keeping it in check a bit. Carbonation is zippy and it's extremely dry. This is a superb beer, and probably the best example of the style I've had yet. Exquisite."
"Pours a clear orange, brown highlights, thin white head, tons of lacing, settles to a nice layer. Smell is sour and funky, socks/horseblanket, wheat, some fruits, bit of grass, nice. Taste is sour, sugary touch, fruits, grass, some lemon, bread, nice sweet funky finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth. I really dig these Girardins, not as good as the Black Label but still pretty tasty. Thanks again Jan!"
"drinkability is good. the aroma is great, and the simple taste just didn't quite live up to it."
"Drinkability: Crisp and sour, but nice."
"Bottle: Poured a clear orangey/yellow color lambic with a huge pure white foamy head with perfect retention. Aroma of sourness, oak, some funkyness and green apples. Taste has some sweetness to balance the sourness and the oak characteristic. Mix between green apples, light acidity and the funkyness is pretty close to perfection. The fact that this version is supposed to be inferior to the unfiltered version make me crave (the black label) even more."
"A fine geuze, long lasting head, easy mouthfeel. Went well with dinner. Light colour. Barnyard aroma. Apple juice, grassiness, eno salt carbonation. Some sour bitterness in finish, but overall balanced with the fruit sugar in a drying aftertaste. Thanks Madsberg, the last of a fine trade."
"Cork Marking: 0705... Explosive bottle poured a dark golden color with a small white head and left spotty lacing on the glass. Light barnyard, lots of oak, dusty malt aroma. Intensive sourness is balanced nicely by the sweetness. A quality gueuze, need to find more of this! Thanks Mads."
"I didnt try the black, when i went back to bierkoning i forgot to get a bottle which i regret because i'm sure its even better than this filtered white label which is fantastic"
"Straw yellow, extremely clear, nice pure white cover of sticky foam. and frankly.... hypocrite appearance since the beer is terrific! Aroma reminds me of blue cheese. Its horsey and barnyardy like any gueuze that respects itself. A good dose of hay and old books alike mustiness claims its seriousness. The addition of fruity undertones (which I couldnt name besides the cidery apples), old socks and leather makes it a contender against the big boys. Admirable clean dryness. Just enough acidity. Incredibly soft malt base, rediculously soft carbonation. As lovely as a flower that smells the wet horse can be. Give me some of that black label, will you? Thanks Martin."
"Well, after having this, i thought it really couldn't get much better in terms of gueuze lambic. That was until i had the Black Label unfiltered version. This is still world class lambic. All the lambic stinkyness is there, and the acidity, but it falls short in terms of complexity in comparison to the black label. Still bloody good, and i'd take this ale any day of the week. Juicy, earthy, grassy, simply wonderful!!!!"
"White-Label is a unique Gueuze in the lambic world, a commercial Gueuze from a traditional producer. If you ever get chance to try the White-Label I would do so. But even better, if you can drink it alongside the Black-Label offering - this is *highly* recommended. For you will surely learn a hell of a lot more about traditional Gueuze by doing this, than reading all the Gueuze Beer Reviews on this Site. After all, experience is everything when drinking lambics."
