"O: the earthy-heavy flavor profile on this continues to be unique among the many gueuzes I've tried... that said, I feel like I've only tried relatively recent bottlings of this (though, this one was bottled in 2013)... still one of my favorites, if not the favorite"

"Berries, funky washed rind cheese, goldenrod, and wet horseblanket on the nose. Pours gold with a slight haze under 1”, whispy white foam cap that fairly rapidly dissipates but leave thin lace. A marvelously fine carbonation supports dry, crisp lemony, citrusy tart flavors with a slight bitterness on the end. Incredible creamy texture, light body. A super refreshing beer."
""
""
"Leathery, musty funk with a hint of cheese. Apple, hay, apricot, strawberry, white pepper, Muscat grapes. Plenty of vanilla oak to balance out tartness, not as citric and sharp as a Cantillon but plenty of complexity. Long semi-dry finish and enough abv to warm up after a bit. Nice and different, I need to lay one down for at least a few years"

"I love a gueze with some funkiness. 2010 bottle (375ml - bottle-conditioned). Poured into flute - hazy, golden color with fine carbonation. Smells of classic gueze funk with apple/pear. Funky taste is like an aged cheese with black peppercorn, with a crisp, dry, bitter finish. Wonderful champagne-like feel. This one is a winner!"

"O: A pretty tame gueuze which I find great. Not too tart or bitter. Altogether very nice."
"Tart, Dry - Sour Candy. Yummy!!! 2010 aged."
""
"Tart, lemony, hazy yellow. Like the citrus"
""
""
"overall: delicious, a work of art."
""
"Beautiful golden and bubbly. Smell is fantastic, some pear, white wine, and awesome funk. Taste follows the smell I get a nice earthy funk and very light funky cheese type flavor in the back keeping things interesting. This is a great beer"
""
""
""
""
"Great ""shelf gueuze."" A bit sweeter and dryer than I prefer and the higher ABV  provides a little heat on the aftertaste.  However, great balance of lemon, funk, slight vinegar, earth, apple, pear, and white wine. Will be buying this again."

"Pours hazy yellow orange with a bit of fizzy head. Smells pretty musty and cheesy, lots of acid underneath, lemon pulp and white wine. Taste is similar, cheese and must that turns into bright lemon and white wine flavors, a bit more on the mineral end. A little bit of citrus sweetness to balance things. Not very effervescent, but smooth and very enjoyable. Nice and warming due to high abv, which I'm enjoying much more than I thought I would. I'm gonna go out and get the kriek mariage parfait tomorrow; I'm pretty much sold on boon. Excellent beer."

"This is an excellent gueuze, and far superior to Boon's other offerings, in my limited experience. The Mariage Parfait series has not yet disappointed me."

"O: I'm not a wine drinker so maybe I can't appreciate this style it's just over carbonated vinegary sourness. it is refreshing but I do not look for these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable and complex, but the higher gravity makes it a little less quaffable. Not my go-to lambic producer, but still very nice."
""
""
""
""
"O- You can see why they call it mariage parfait. This beer is an amazingly balanced geuze. Very approachable because of how nicely balanced it is but also still amazing and delicious for people who love sour bombs or are more experienced with geuzes."

"I'd already given this beer a glowing review, but after trying several other gueuzes (including Tilquin, Cuvee Renee, and Oude Beersel), this one stands out as the best to me. I'd imagine its age has something to do with it, but still. Wow. I'm definitely going back to the store and buying them out of 375s and 750s in preparation of my ""perfect marriage."" :)"

"O: A very good gueuze, especially for the price (~$8-9/375mL here) and availability. I'm curious to see how this one ages and I expect it to do very well. It's considerably better and more complex than the normal gueuze,  but I'm not sure that's it's almost twice as good."
"Cloudy orange gold pour with a one-finger white head. Big sour fruit aroma. Delicious mild sour lemon taste upfront backed with a slight fruity sweetness. Also has a very nice oak character and light spice flavor in the medium body. Really well done beer that isn’t overly sour or tart and drinks very easy for the body and slightly high ABV."
""
""
"O: Complex, tart and a nice funky and oak undertone. At a reasonable price this was a nice geuze. I'd pick this up again if I see it."
""
""

"This beer is intense. The coming together of powerful earth and a bright bit of uplifted sweetness. The shyness of the musty earth after it rains and the greeness that lies in wait for when the sun comes to shine again. The fruit is the culmination of this beer and is taken whole in it’s every aspect from sweet peel to the tartness of it’s flesh , right through to it’s final incarnation - sour and like vinegar in decay. This beer is truly a perfect wedding of elements."
""
""
""
"Edit:2010 date."
"Overall this a delicious and well made geuze. While it's not as refined as the best in class it's interesting, fairly well balanced and very drinkable. It's not for the faint of heart or those opposed to the funk. Its also available on the shelf once in a while which is a big plus."

" The taste is great -very tangy with lemony and light sweet flavor with a subtle funkiness and gentle alcohol considering it is 8% it is pretty faint with slight woody accent and mild tannin with more lemony juicy taste like sparkling sour lemonade with a nice dry alcohol augmented finish with light lactic acid continuing on after the dry tangy finish. Overall a wonderful gueuze with a little more sourness than most and alcohol yet that is not apparent in the taste I really loved having this on the last day of our Anniversary trip to Belgium"
""
""
"A nice affordable, readily available gueze."
""
""
"Definitely the best Boon geuze I've had."
""

"A different rake on the style. Bright fruits (mainly citrus) really lightens things up. Not quite sour but plenty of tartness to combat the sweet. Funk is minimal but the odd sesame seed spice really throws a twist on things. Not sure if it's the combination of yeast and the 8% abv or if I can't nail down an ingrediant. I enjoyed exploring this beer."
""
""
""
"Tastes much like the smell- rich tart, acidic flavor. You should not drink this if you don't like sour beers- if you do this should but really high on your list of must grabs. Well carbonated, light body, definitely very tart. It's great if you love sours like I do."
"See, gueuze can still be good without being .rar. Hazy, golden-bronze color, with a tall, foamy, off-white head; good retention and strands of lacing on the glass. In the nose, funk and yeast, cobwebs, composed citrus rind, some floral notes. The taste was similar, bready yeast, grassy funk, horseblanket and cobwebs, subtle citrus and floral notes, oak, candi sugar. This was a smooth drinker, mellow and lightly sour, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Very good overall. I ended up picking up a bottle for myself at the shop; maybe I'll see what a few more years does to it."
""
"OVERALL- This is one of those instances where reviewing the beer almost took the fun out of drinking it. Such a cohesive and harmonious product that you just kinda want to throw it back without thinking about it, which would be very easy to do. Fans of the ""funk"" may be rather disappointed as this is exceptionally bright and clean. The floral and citrus dimensions are almost on par with any us IPA out there. This is like the greatest glass of lemonade ever."

"Burnt orange hues with a slight white head. Cloudy. Very nice nose of wildflowers, cheese, wood, sour lemon, apples, and leaves. Nice blend of fruit and funk. Quite pronounced tartness, yet not exceedingly sharp as to offend the palate. Delicious and quite pleasing. Goes well with an earthy brie cheese."

"O - been drinking a lot of sours recently, and this does not hold its own in category. Zero pucker."
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this one but it wasn't worth what I had to pay for it. I could have gotten a Tilquin for a few dollars cheaper and I would have been just as happy, if not happier. I wouldn't turn down another but I doubt I would buy any more unless the price is right."
""
"A rough, aggresive beer, not exactly for beginners in its style, but a classic for pros."
""
""
"Overall- This reminds me of a lightly tart saison. I scaled the taste down (though it's not because I didn't like it) it's because It doesn't remind me of a geuze. Solid and refreshing never the less."
"Glowing orange-amber color with a fleeting head of crackling foam. Smells of dusty green apple, lime, and lemon...damp and musty with some mineral notes and a hit of woody spice. Big, funky, tart flavor. Right away it's apparent that this is stronger than your average Gueuze. Lemon and lime, acetic dryness, earth, peppercorn, and plenty of wood. A bit more sweetness than others within the style that I've tried, but also perhaps more straight-up sourness. Medium bodied, tart, and puckering. Next time I come across one of these, I'll grab another so I can put one away for a few more years to see what happens."
"Dirty gold amber in color with a modest white head. Aroma is bright, fruity, woody, and pleasantly stinky. Apples, cranberries, pear, melon perhaps... Very clean and a little apple pie. Taste is sharply sour and tangy with. Fruit, leaves, and earthiness. Very refreshing. Fermented apples with grapefruit rind. Very drying on the palate and mouthwatering with its tartness. Implosive mouthfeel and chalky dryness. Warming somewhat as well after the finish."
"2008 Vintage poured in December, 2012. Pours cloudy gold color with the perfectly sized head that recedes moderately fast. Pears, apples, alcohol, lemon zest, yeast funk on the aroma. Bit of tart smell. Flavor is like biting into a fresh green apple with some extra lemon tartness. Somewhat effervescent with a dry finish, but wish the fruit flavor followed it down the throat a bit. Dryness takes over on the back end. Light to medium mouthfeel. My first lambic, so I’ll have to venture out a bit from here. Solid brew and a nicr change up."

"A good beginner gueuze..."

"7/10 sourness. Very nice geuze. Has nice citrus, sour and slight dark fruit notes."

"O: I usually prefer the funkier version of this style, but this hits a lot of great, complex notes. Would easily buy this again."
"O: An very tart beer that's a little off balance but very enjoyable. This one is so tart it make me worried it might hurt my tooth enamel but totally worth the risk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A really wonderful beer, the funk is certainly the main focus, but it isn't over done."
"Overall a great tart-filled complexity and flavor profile makes this beer a real winner in my book. The 4 year old vintage definitely helped in that regard, i'd like to try a 2013 one and compare. I'll look for one in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this gueuze a lot. It's more champagne-like than most, which says something for the style."
"Quite a different gueuze - not my favorite, but probably the best one to introduce people to who are foreign to the style. Would pair amazingly well with food, and works as a casual, crisp, funky experience as any good saison. Ahead of the pack in terms of the oak blending going on here, but definitely not as extreme. Recommended to fans of gueuzes looking to complete their list of all the traditional Lambic breweries."
"poured a very clean copper tone with 3 fingers of white foamy head which quickly dissipated. aroma of wine barrels strikes first.. lots of wine grapes, oak, flower petals, funky cheese-like aroma. very tart and sour up front but after each sip you can develop more flavors.. oak, grapes, a charred like bitterness (barrel), cherries. medium (though light) body with a high amount of carbonation. a very nice gueuze for sure, very glad i picked this up. if i could do without one thing it's the slight bitterness.. but i think i can live with it."
"Overall- Not my favorite as far as gueuze goes, but not bad. Would be much better without the metallic edge on the finish."
"Pours hazed gold with a rim of whites. Smells of funk, hay, yogurt, lemons, metal and some black olive juice. Flavor carries that nice mouth watering tart I like, then some bicarconate/chalk tones with some lemon peels, some metal, some acetic quality and a good yeast character in the background. Light on thin bodied with hi carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice geuze that was pleasant to drink. It's sour as hell, but also has a bit of sweetness to balance it out. The oak is very well present, and of course the funkiness is there. As a beginner to Belgian sours, I have to say that this could very well be a good beginner geuze. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real easy drinking solid geuze with hints of simplicity, but not much diversity, complexity or extremes either."
""
""
""
""
"O- I think it deserves higher than the 92 it has right now. Im aging some from 2007 and its drinking sooo nice. Be sure to drink it at 55-65*. I think it gets worse as it gets colder."
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent geuze, but not a great one."
""
""
"O/D-Pretty neat. If I am going to have this style, I want it to be offensively puckering. This is more subdued; especially at its ABV."
""
"2007 vintage with a best by date of 2030!!! Nice, deep orange color with a decent fluffy white head. Sharp and tart aroma-grassy and apple like. Very tart flavor with a nice apple/pear flavor-almost cider like. Spicy and peppery. Very smooth mouthfeel-the tartness and effervescence is rather subdued I am suprised. Nice grain like quality. A great beer for sure. Had my first geuze 20 odd years ago and certainly didnt ""get it"" then. This is just a great beer and a great experience."
"2009 vintage. I popped this bottle with a friend of mine who's soon to tie the knot, a sort of toast to good tidings and good futures. It pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild mandarin orange, white wine grapes (pretty close to Chardonnay), light vanilla, and a smattering of very light cobweb. The taste brings in more of the same, with a good amount of the inherent funk seeping into the mandarin orange character. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice gueuze, hopefully a glass of healthy portents for my buddy and his lady."
"2009 vintage. this beer is outstanding, thanks to my rare beer club for hooking this up. a real treat. it pours a radiant orangey yellow color, hazy, but not nearly as much as some others. the head is over two inches tall, and leaves excellent lacing. the nose is sour and punchy, just how I like it. not as complex as some, but still a lot going on with a lemony acid profile and a floral sort of yeast that goes well with the souring agents. the flavor is just like the nose, very straightforward gueuze. im picking up a little more oak in this than I usually do, which I think helps the sour set in and make a little bigger impression. its very refreshing, and it hides its strength incredibly well. im surprised at its elegance, being as big as it is. I think the age has mellowed it just a bit, as the carbonation isn't quite as effervescent as it probably was. but the relaxed feel really works for me, and the light body helps it stay drinkable. overall an excellent example of the style, it has that perfect sour funk profile that is just right for this time of year. this one is a winner, worthy of seeking out. could see giving it another 10 years or so too..."
""
""
"Overall, a nice gueuze, but not the best. The flavor is very pleasant and well-balanced, but others seem to have more complexity than this one. I may want to visit this one again after I've had a few more. This is still a new style to me and I'm trying to decide what I do and do not like."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A nice example of style. A solid geuze. Very refreshing and extremely easy to drink (the 8% is nearly imperceptible)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: it seems like I could taste cork very tart, long lasting background mustiness, 8% alcohol barely noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I will certainly be picking up a few more of these. About as far on the tart side as I would think sours can get. A little lacking in some complexity with fruitiness and whatnot but nonetheless a must try for anyone seeking the extreme."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent beer. Wished I could get more of this easily. Loads of sour tartness while remaining drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice gueuze that would probably just get better with more age. With that, I may buy a bottle the next time I see it to put away for a while."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light, crip mouthfeel. High carbonation. Slight warming alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Executed, fantastically. I loved this beer, my only complaint would be that the nose is a little lackluster...don't judge a book by its nose however, this brew is tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by this. Big, wet, funky, cheesy notes make this one a gueuze-head's gueuze. Could use a bit more liveliness in the feel and there's a very slight, mellow alcohol taste that I could do without. Still all things considered, I gotta go back and get the rest of the remaining bottles of these."

"2007 Vintage. This pours a murky copper orange color with a white foamy head. The aroma is fairly acidic with lemons and apples in the mix with other earthy tones. The flavor is quite tart and full in volume. Taste is a very well blended with a combination of tart fruits and oak. It finishes kind of dry and chalky. Very well done, only is Belgium!"
"OVERALL: Liked this one way, way better than their regular offering. Less musty and mouldy flavors and no added sweetness means this one allows the tart green fruits and light acidity to play a more central roll. More my style at least. Enjoyed this one and would gladly drink agian."

"375 ml caged and corked bottle, 2007 vintage. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy dark gold color with about an inch off-white head that fizzled away quickly. No lacing. The brew smells like musty funk, hay, white grapes, tart apples, and some lemon. It tastes like bready malt, musty funk, light peppery spice, wood, and a bit of pear and tart apple. Not very tart at all. I think it tastes more earthy and musty than sour. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with good, soft carbonation. The alcohol in this brew is well hidden, it sure doesn't seem like it's 8% ABV. In the end, I liked this brew. It wasn't as tart as I thought it was going to be, but it's still tasty."
"O: Decent gueuze. The strong musky odor is the biggest knock, and the funk is high in the flavor without enough tartness compared to your typical gueuze. Great beer, but fell short compared to the others in the lineup."
"Pours a bright apricot color into a snifter glass. Large frothy white head that dissolves to a thin 1/4 inch head. Smells like sour apples, vinegar, and a skunky-funkiness. The sour smell alone makes your mouth water. Tastes... sour! Very vinegar like and lingers well after swallowing. Even minutes later I have a sour-apple, lemony taste in my mouth. Very intense carbonation keeps the beer pretty exciting over a 30 min session. Overall a really solid gueuze; would definitely buy again."
"M: Medium bodied. Lots of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait pours a very hazy golden color with a finger of head. The aroma is very nice, it's got tart fruits, sour yeasts, and oak. The taste is very oaky, but it blends very well with the sharp fruit tartness and full sourness. The yeast aspect rules the roost after a few seconds, and then the oak and a bit of pepper ride out the finish. The mouthfeel is lighter, very dry, and highly carbonated. The drinkability is great, there isn't a hint of the ABV. Overall, a solid and well-balanced gueuze. The oak aging really helps round everything out."
""
"One of the best Geuze I have ever had!! 2007 vintage. I plan on grabbing more bottles for age!!"
""
""
""
"Overall, a big winner. A beer that make you asks why you don't drink this style more. Very good."
""
"O- a really nice example of the style. Not as complex as some but tasty and tart in the best ways."
"Overall: I had this with some mussels, and it was perfect. So smooth and very easy to drink. I never would have guessed that it's 8 percent."
"In the past, I have criticized beers with too much oak. Fortunately, there are other issues with this Gueuze as well. It's a little too boozy, with not enough sourness. The mouthfeel leaves a lot to be desired. Still, a decent effort."
""
"Drink- Wow, was very let down by this. Average gueuze at best. Hope my 04 750 ages a bit better till I open in 2 years for 10 year anny."
""
""
""
""
"2008 bottle: Cloudy Orange pour with a light fizzy head that lasted a little while but not the entire beer. Aroma is of grapefruit, metal, barnyard, and some nuttiness that I thought did not belong there. Taste was astringent citrus (mostly grapefruit), horse blanket, field of hay, more metal (ugh) and that nutty flavor at the end. Palate is light and refreshing. Not as good as other bottles I have had."
""
""
"Cost: $14.99 for a 750 ml bottle."
""
""
"Overall: A damp, dry, musty gueuze. Lacks some of the sharper and more nuanced complexities I expect from the style."
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some grain and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with an earthy and funky flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great aroma that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy drinking beer, you cannot feel the 8% here. Classic Belgian Gueuze in all the aspects. Excellent beer"
"Overall: Really solid sour beer! Cool bonus that I got to drink the last bottle of this beer at the Malthouse in Madison and it an old beer from 2007! Probably the oldest sour i have drank to date, but its still tastes really nice!"
"2008 vintage. Bought a corked bottle of this from the Tobu department store in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Poured into a Rochefort glass goblet. Beautifully enticing bottle with an easy-to-open wire and cork system. Immediate sour scents of apple, grape, lemon, and grapefruit come wafting out of the bottle and especially off the top of the glass once I pour it. Cloudy wheat hue with a thick petri-dish white Belgian head on it. The taste is sour and intense, and you have to have an open mind when you drink it. However, if you do, the blended citrus and sweet fruit mixed with the sourness of aged lambic makes this an amazing brew. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Would go well with a white fish dish."
"This beer is great and like any other geuze it tends to grow on you when emptying the bottle."
"Beer is highly drinkable for a sour. The head actually effects the mouthfeel which I find is a rarity with sours. They always seem to not have or hold head very well. Also A.B.V. is quite respectable @ 8%. I highly recommend to anyone lookin for a good sour."
"There's a reason these 750ml bottles are ~$12. I'd strongly prefer a 375ml Tilquin Gueuze instead of this every time."
""
""
""
""
"Really nice Gueuze, really starting to enjoy this style. The aroma in particular on this one is probably my favorite aspect, but the flavor is really nice too with the interplay between the little bit of sweetness and the sourness. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: My favorite Gueuze so far."
""
"O - A different kind of geueze. Very earthy and funky with less mouth puckeringly sour fruit than I'm used to. Very delicious!"
""
""
""
""
"O- A great gueuze, very good complexity and drinkability, I'm gonna have to go pick up some more of this immediately."
""
"D - overall, I would say this is a very approachable gueuze for people new to the style. It isn't over sourly but has the classic flavors (citrus, funk, etc) that goes with the style. Not bad."
""
""
""
"O - No, this is not Cantillon but damn enjoyable regardless. If it werent for moving on to a different place I would likely have had more. There is something about relaxing in Brussels with a fantastic Geuze that makes me smile inside and out. If I cant have a Cantillon, this will do nicely."
"It doesn't get much drier than this. Acidity seems to have faded over the years, making the flavours more subtle and graceful."
""
""
"O- I'm really glad I stumbled upon this Geuze. Very pleasant and a great summer brew. Highly recommend it"
"Overall, an excellent, excellent beer!"
""
""
""
""
"I've haven't had a gueze in ages. Not sure why, but probably monetary reasons. I'm really glad I picked up this bottle tonight."
"Very happy to have tried this."
""
"O: A pretty good gueuze, but not my favorite. I like them a little more sour with a little less funk, but would be happy to drink this one again."
""
"Pure white head, small bubbles, fairly quick dissipation with minimal lacing over hazy straw gold body, a few lazy bubbles rising to surface. Big dose of funk in the nose, light musty horseblanket, some citrus notes, lemon, floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, quite complex and funky, a bit of hay to offset the horseblanket, lemony esters for balance. Mouthfeel is just on the light side of medium, really good effervescence. A real revelation, certainly one of the better Gueuze I've had, sure enough funky, yummy."
"4.5, 2, 1, 3, 1"
"Overall - An outstanding gueuze - one of the best i've tried... i must get me some more..."
""
"Overall – A mild Gueuze. Not my favorite at all. I will not be getting this again."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a really nice gueuze. I thought the nose was fantastic, bordering on a 5, and was really funky. Split the bottle with my brother but could have easily drank it all myself; look forward to getting more of it. I liked it a ton better then the normal Boon Gueuze, but not quite as much as the Boon Oude Kriek Mariage Parfait."
"O - An excellent Gueuze, definitely worth waiting for!"
""
""
""
"Overall: A really tasty geuze that explores the sweaty, funky aspects of the Brett, rather than folding to the whims of the bacteria. Tasty and unique."
"After removing the label and picking my jaw up off the floor I dive back in to my glass. 2007 Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait. Your killing me, Alewatcher! Great beer!!!"

"Overall, I was really looking forward to this, being my first aged beer. Personally love the flavor, although it starts off funky I like the change and the finish a lot. Definitely a great beer to enjoy in replacement of champagne, but wouldn't drink on any day."
""
""
"Golden yellow hue with a modest white head. Great sour and funky nose. Plenty of used straw, dusty attic and moldy basement. Flavors are sour and funky as well. The lactic sour stings with each sip. Lots of moldy wood and old library books. Light body with a solid amount of carbonation. A very nice gueuze for my my money."
""
""
"O - I really enjoyed this brew. This was recommended by the bartender and it didn't disappoint. A nice complex Belgian geuze that delivers."
"I love me some Gueuze, and this one is no exception. Although it doesn't rank with the best-style, it hit the spot tonight."

"Last pour and the beer is now decidedly cloudy with just a wee bit of sediment from the bottom of the glass. I think this is a must try for the lovers of the style."

"O: A beautifully aged and blended beer. Not overly sour, but definitely puckering and tart. An awesome beer if you can find it, highly recommended."

"D - This is a great drink and will compliment the garlic-laced salmon I'm having tonight; great smell, well-balanced sour yeast and citrus flavor and great mouthfeel; definitely one of the best Gueuze I've ever had"

"D - a sipper, too be sure but a nice one. A very accessible geuze: not too sour or complex."
"Pours a golden orange w/ a one finger white head that quickly disappears. Good carbonation, and very clear in appearance. The nose is great for the style- funk, hay, dirt, and maybe some underlying lemon. Really balanced and fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose profile, w/ some berries being added to the mix. This is bitter, but it's pretty smooth overall. Very drinkable as well. Nice Brett finish. Aftertaste adds fruit and oak into the mix. Feel is really smooth. Overall, this was a great beer- glad I got to try this one! Cheers."
"O - Very nice and not very sour if that sort of thing deters you. I'd have liked to see the envelope pushed a little further, and am not sure in this case if the age helped or hurt that aspect of the beer. It would pair excellently with bleu cheese though, ours was eaten with aged cheddar and some other unnamed funky European cheeses."
"Notes: Not at all what I thought this was going to be. Smells like a lambic, tastes like a lambic, but doesn't feel like a lambic. Maybe it's the high alcohol content that messes with it?"
"D - Would make a decent substitute for Drie Fonteinen, depending on availability and budget. Crushed the 375ml bottle on my own, even with the higher ABV. Will definitely have this again down the road - curious to see how other vintages compare."
"Tastes tart and funky. Lots of nice light citrusy or lemony fruit. Great mouthfeel. Overall super enjoyable and refreshing. Something i would have time and time again"
"D-A very complex yet drinkable beer with considerable ABV that isn't detectable at all. A very interesting beer and one I'd love to get the chance to try again."
"Super nice “Pop” on open. Pours a cloudy orange/red with a frothy white head obviously well carbonated. Smells of brett, funk, oak, lemon citrus, slight green apple. First sip is not as sour, funky, or as puckering as the nose indicates. Mouthfeel is amazing as the beer just dances on your tongue. ABV of 8% is well hidden. Very nice indeed."
"O: I can see why this beer is regarded as a classic. Great aromas, great flavor profile, great mouthfeel, great balance...I will definitely purchase this again."
"The body was light to medium in density with modest carbonation. Very solid and a bellwether for the style."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I thought this one quite drinkable in that it has a great deal of complexity and is a challenge to figure out the flavors and aromas that seem to be present. I think it may need a bit more maturity in the bottle to come closer to its full potential (a pretty safe statement given that its best by date is about 19 years in the future ☺. Overall, I’m pleased to have tried one and I think it is clearly worth having on the shopping list. While at the end of the day I might prefer a different Geuze over this one, this would make a worth while and interesting alternative."
"O- A very balanced beer. Excellent in many ways. Probably underrated. Sour but traditional as well."
"O: There is some alcohol burn and this could be slightly more flavorful, but this is a very solid gueuze. It's quite enjoyable."
"This is a solid beer, but not my favorite gueuze."
" farmhouse funk. Ohh so inviting this was tremendously tart and sour. . Lots of grape and apple tones all over this one, really pushing the senses to the limits of what they could possible endure, but you know in a good way. A wonderful rich tart, sour, funky, explosion of flavor, picking up right where the aroma left off. Deep sour apple and grape flavors are all over this one, really pushing this forward on you. The finish was dry, and very long lingering, leaving you desperately craving another"
"Overall: After 7 years in the bottle and with 8% alcohol, I would have expected this to be blisteringly sour, but that was not the case. This was one of more mild gueuzes I have had."
"Pale orange in color with no head on the pour. Perhaps the age has taken the wind out of the head. Fruity and tart in the nose, like the aroma of sweettarts. That's something I like. The beer tastes like it was made awhile back; it's very low in carbonation, the acidity is greatly faded, and overall the flavor is mellower. Perhaps I enjoy the pucker of a fresh gueuze greater than the mellowness of an aged one, but I had higher hopes for this 8 year old Mariage Parfait."
"O- Lovely. ABsolutely lovely. I have the entire bottle to myself and Im quite pleased about that. THis is the only vintage Ive had but I will definately be seeking out more after this one. Great Geuze, not like over powering sour but very well balanced and complex. Cheers to Brouwerij Boon, another top notch Geuze."
"A decent and certainly a good gueuze. And I cannot say this definitively, because I wasn't lucky enough to have a fresh bottle, but I think this bottle has faded and would have been far better years ago."
"O- Disappointing. What flavors do come out are flat and unappealing. The aroma had some good qualities that made me look forward to the taste, but none of that came through."
"Pours golden yellow with a good sized white head good lacing. Smells of fresh lemon with a good amount of barnyard funk. Taste is not really as sour as expected actually not that sour at all, it tastes like a sugar lemon with a big presence of lactic funk very refershing. Mouthfeel is a typical gueuze carbonation seems a bit high for a 7 year old beer. Overall refreshing beer pretty good."
"Intensity seems to be the name of the game with this beer. And the mouthfeel is no exception. Seemingly enamel stripping from the acidic tartness and sourness. But the beer has a short lived initial creaminess that makes a quick transition into a very refreshing tartness, medium astringency, citrus and hop bitterness, and a powdery-dry finish late. But then it slams shut, providing a lemony brine flavor with an exhale; then we're ready for another sip."
"Overall, this isn't bad, but certainly not worth the price tag to me. I am more than happy to have more sour gueuzes with less fruit and funk, but that's just me. This is certainly not a bad beer, but not my favorite take on the style."
"Overall an drink. I prefer the Oude Geuze though, as it is less musky. It has some quite skunky characteristics."
"Also, I would like to note that kkipple said that when he saw the pic of this beer when I was drinking it, that it was the first time there was a photo with a Geuze and an AR-15 in the same shot. Just thought I should point that out..."
"O: Unfortunately, this isn't living up to the promise of the aroma for me. It's a little more flavorful as it warms up and the carbonation dies down, but the bitter, metallic finish remains. Nowhere near the top of the gueuze world, IMO."
"Update: I got a chance to share a 750ml bottle of the 04 vintage at a recent tasting. Thanks to (IIRC) Knifestyles for putting his Lambic basket to use on this brew. From notes: Standard, nicely carbonated appearance. Very dry, chalky, herbal, grassy, leafy aroma. Tastes quite nice, with good balance between grassiness, barnyard funk, and sour fruit. Super dry, slightly astringent finish. Prickly, lively feel. Decidedly better than the 06 bottle I reviewed above, but still nowhere near the top echelon of Geuzes. 4/4/4/4/4"
"O: This beer embodied the musty, earthy, aged characteristics sought out in gueuzes. This contrasts well with the qualities of a Drie Fonteinen Gueuze of which were much fresher and more citrus focused. It would be very interesting to blend the two together!"
"O: Quality beer but wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. Bit too malty/sweet for my money and I'd like more pucker in the taste. Non-sour drinkers may well enjoy this. 3.5"
"Overall: It is a solid Gueuze, smells better than it tastes, but it is still good. Just seems to be missing something crucial in the taste."
"Dr: A good Sunday morning beer, but far from a great fruit beer. Certainly worth a go for any beer fanatic, but it's not easy on the wallet - at least not in Dublin - at 6.20 quid. Good for gueuze, and I need to revisit it to go into more detail once I'm more familiar with the style."
"O/D - Nice. Not amazing but good stuff. I always like how Geuze has an element of sweetness to balance against the lambic's sourness. This came close to being great, but lacked as alot of the aroma didn't come through to the taste. A good beer."
"Very good, very complex, not so demanding. Updated from a beer tasting at the De Klomp of the 2005 vintage."
"Not quite a mind-blowing beer, pleasantly flavoured and fermented though for enjoyable drinking."
"O - Good drinkability for the absent alcohol and profile of this beer, I could have easily put this down alone. I need to get some more of this one (and possibly for the head table of my wedding!) Unique and balanced."
"An interesting Gueuze, and perhaps one of the more funky and unusual ones I've tried. The blending gives such wonderful scope for complexity and experimentation, and I have to say I approve of this one."
"Beer is bright with carbonation, thin body, and an acetic bite. I like this beer more than I thought I would. I had the PM Kriek earlier and was underwhelmed but this gueuze is great. THe lactic acid gives the beer a swimming creaminess and has a great finish."
"O - I loved this one and it eclipses the standard geuze for me, because its so well balanced. Well worth a try."
"D: It was good but was missing something. I think some more lactic acid would bring this to the better examples of this style. Still quite enjoyable and one of the most approachable examples of the style out there. Goes down super easy and it refreshing with enough complexity to keep you coming back."
"Overall, a very tasty brew, and a pleasant experience. I'm glad to have another bottle in the cellar. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, a touch of acetic character. Not a bad gueuze but lacks complexity."
"A serious geuze, probably not for lambic virgins, but rewarding for the beer geek."
"The Mariage Parfait combines the soft, approachable acid of Hannsens with the bitter citrus of Girardin Black Label and an elevated alcohol content I have never experienced before. The reult is a damn fine Gueuze. Balanced, complex, ageworthy."
"D: didn't have all that much, seemed a bit weird but tasty and complex enough, could have easily enjoyed more"
"D - Might be a touch over carbonated. Having had Boon Gueuze right before this this one is only a touch more complex in taste and similar in aroma."
"(D)- A great gueuze. Milder than some in the sour category, but carries a superb balance of flavors. Crisp and refreshing. Not the best, but still top notch."
"This is a golden beer, mostly clear, except for notable suspended sediment. The rises quickly, but falls within minutes to a soapy film. Great aroma...sour and barnyard...funky and a little fruity. It's not an overpowering aroma..but is very well subtle and nice. A little perfume and malt are also there. Nice lambic smells. The taste is great...not as sour as expected. A little bitter, funky, sharp, and musty. Lingering bitterness and some wood-characteristics. Moderately dry, but not nearly as dry as I anticipated. Medium in body with some carbonation spritziness. This is a very good Geuze, being both approachable and rewarding. I had it with some fruit, aged Parmigiano-Reggiano, and thick balsamic vinegar."
"2004 Vintage and it pours a golden honey,orange hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head and no lacing,the smell is very typical of a Gueuze with aromas of apple cider,vinegar,musty barnyard funk and some white wine,it has a nice light-medium bodied mouthfeel which is perfectly carbonated and feels almost like a nice white wine but then the flavour lets you know you are drinking a Gueuze with tastes of apple cider,vinegar,hay,white grapes and it finishes with a musty sourness that makes you come back for another sip and overall i really like it and would buy again without doubt cheers."
"This is champagne like with enough carbonation to go very well with rich food. I am going to buy some to cellar and some to enjoy this summer"
"D: I can't drink much of this beer at all (had to share the bottle). Experiences like this are leading me to believe that gueze just isn't for me. I can't recommend it."
"DB- Funk domination in both aroma and flavor. Overall it reminds me of a hay barn with some fruit in it. Different from all gueuze I have sampled."
"A little too farmy at first but opens up nicely when it warms. It is still pretty barnyard-forward though."
"A 2004 bottle. Nice golden bronze color with a bit of haze. Pours with a loose white head initially. This beer is shocking in its mildness. This beer has little resemblance to a Cantillon geuze. Even Cuvée René is more sour. Nonetheless, this beer has an assertive tartness, balanced with a subtle sweetness. Its flavor lacks the barnyard funk of its aroma. It finishes in a broad, woody, yeasty dryness mixed. This beer has a medium body, kept light with a refreshing, generous effervescence. This 8% beer tastes more like 4%. Phenomenal."
"one of the most funky geuzes i have had yet. not overpowering but definitely the main flavor here. very good stuff. i could only imagine this getting even more funky however not too sure about the sourness. its fairly light and quite approachable."
"D-A tasty, approachable gueuze that would make a great introduction to the style."
"Note: 2004 vintage"
"Very approachable Geuze."
"2003 bottle purchased at Vintner's in Charlotte. Pours an orange color with a small head and some lace. The aroma is barnyardy with some lemon and fruit rind with a bit of fresh hay. The tiniest bit of dirty laundry sneaks in about halfway through the bottle. The flavor is tart and dry with some nice zestiness akin to a champagne or a cava. There is a mild fruitiness with some lemon rind and new oak. The beer seems to be sour right in the back and as the bottle progresses this becomes more pronounced. Quite the departure from the very sour Geuze made the standard (in my mind at least) by 3 Fonteinen & Cantillon, but well nuanced and enjoyable none the less."
"D: This gueuze is one that I hope to revisit in the very near future. If you see this on the shelf, grab it."
"D: Purchased 3 of these and drank them all in one sitting."
"What an awesome brew. pale golden color with good carbonation. smells like grapes and funk. tastes like white grapes and brett. real crisp clean taste. Gave it to some champagne drinkers and they loved it. nice light body very refreshing. feels great in my mouth. highly drinkable, i could put back a 750 of this no problem"
"Brett forward all around. Damp earth and hay with slight lemon acidity. Bone dry and just a predominately funky. Very easy to drink a 750 by yourself since the acidity is not overpowering at all."
"A full flavoured, rich and inviting Gueuze. The sourness is present but doesn't dominate and on the whole this is very easy to drink. A top class Gueuze."
"D: A tasty funky gueuze. Has some minor imperfections that keep it from the top tier, but a gueuze I wouldn't mind stocking in my cellar."
"D- something id love to drink another bottle of later down the line. a very nice balanced sour, and thats something thats rarely pulled off well. my other bottle will go the distance. ill report back in 2027, heh."
"Easy to drink. Dry finish. The coating is dry as well. Light body with lots of carbonation."
"Overall, a fine lambic from Boon that I can't wait to see develop a little bit more with age."
"Overall, I liked this. It's a bit thin and subdued in the flavor but I like what's there."
"D-this is pretty poor, tons of burnt sugars and seems to have oxidized. lots of scotch and sherry notes, much like a harsh liquor."
"D - A subtle yet tasty beer. If you see it buy it. Buy lots. 8% ABV is hardly there."
"A great geuze that I wish to find a fresh bottle to compare one day. I don't think I could do a bottle to the head, but this remains drinkable, though not memorable."
"D- this is one tasty gueuze. Complex and deep but very drinkable. I love it."
"The mouthfeel is good, but standard for a high quality gueuze. Drinkability is good but I don't think I would put this alongside the titans of the style. Overall this beer is extremely high quality and worth the purchase. Glad to have the opportunity to drink it!"
"D: This one may not yet have reached its prime, or may yet to be there. A good gueuze, but not the best on I've had."
"A 2005 vintage. Pours cloudy orange, with not much carbonation. Aromas of strawberry, pineapple, and apple juice. Flavors of orange with a nice sourness and slight astringency -- the astringency reminds me of their regular old gueuze, but it isn't as detracting. Overall, way better than their normal oude gueuze."
"I loved this. Its my kind of beer and I could drink it all day long. I had no idea it was 8%, as it hides the alcohol so well in an intensely funky and intense gueuze experience."
"drinkability: good"
"Overall I thought this was a very crisp and not overly tart beer for the style - one of the few that I could sip on. While it's nothing special it's worth a shot."
"2003 vintage courtesy of RomanW70. Pours a hazy, orange-gold with a quarter inch head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim. Nose reveals grapefruit, cork and vinegar. Taste follows nose, with a hint of oak in the mix. Mouthfeel was light and sparkling without being overly effervescent. A palate cleansing and easy drinking gueuze."
"This beer pours a gold to orange in color, kinda unexpected for a geuze. Puffy white head, no lacing. Aroma citrus, lemon, grassy, white our cider vinegry scent, and sour apple, real nice. Wheaty flavor, sour acetic acid, sour apple, lemon flavor. Light hop bite towards the end. Nice bubbly and lively mouthfeel that makes your jowels jump up and say hey! I find a geuze to be a really sessionable style so I could put this stuff back for hours thats all that needs to be said. Good body, carb n very tasty."
"D: quite smooth and the complexity definitely kept me coming back for more. Stand up job from Boon; can't believe this was my first beer from them."
"Easy to drink for a gueuze: vinegar is in check, and everything is fruity and enticing. Much better than my other Boon experiences. If this one is sitting around your local liquor store, might as well grab one."
"$11.99 for the caged/corked green bomber, best before 5-16-28! Pours cloudy medium tangarine amber, under a larger, puffy head slowly receeding and morhping to loose meraingue, medium tan in color. Leaves some large blobs of lacing. Cirtus, horse blanket, and must in the subtle nose. Moderatly tart gueuze, more lemon/lime notes, mustyness, barnyard and sour beer goodness, Zesty, palate clearing and efreshing brew. If you dont like this type of beer, you have not drunk enough of it...complex, tasty and thoroughly enjoyable. Seek out and enjoy"
"2003 vintage. best before 1-2-27 - good thing I got to it when when I did... on bottle menu @ Churchill's in San Marcos, at $23 a little pricey, but what the heck. poured with minimal carbonation and no head into a duvel goblet. golden, a little cloudy. nose is a little musty, apricots and vinegar. taste is a bit tart, but not substantially so. pretty easy drinking. a touch of brett, maybe some granny smith apples. not exceedingly dry on the finish. a lingering bitterness. pleasant. nice mouth feel, a bit thin. glad I bought it. if I saw it on draft I'd try it again just to see how it differs."
"This wasn't quite what I had in mind when I opened the bottle but the people at Boon know gueuze a lot better than me."
"Can't wait till I turn 50 to try the other one I bought!"
"D - This is easy for me to drink. It's actually too easy; I was expecting more of a challenge. While a tasty gueuze, I think I prefer the regular Boon or Oud Beersel versions. Of course, that preference in no way precludes a good rating, as it *is* supremely easy to drink, especially given its alcohol level. Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent beer, one that I would be happy to drink again - it's just that I was expecting an overall 4.5-5.0 beer."
"D - Very good geuze overall. A touch harsh on the bitter side, if I have to pick a fault(?), at least to my tastes. This only mildly detracts from the drinkability though. Glad to get to try this. I see more bottles of this one in my future."
"Drinkability - the hardcore gueuze fans ding it for it's lack of intensity on the sour scale, but that makes it all the more appealing to us sweet-DNA types. I like this one and can only guess what another decade will do to it. A great one to share, lots of flavor for everyone!"
"All in all, worth repeating."
"A traditional bottle-conditioned gueuze, spontaneously fermented, and a step above the regular Boon gueuze, which is most likely sweetened and not conditioned. Cloudy golden with little head. Aroma of barnyard mustiness. Citrus flavors with moderate sourness and a dry, bitter finish. Ages well."
"This is a decent gueuze that has more complexity in the flavor than the nose, with the funky starting to show itself. I imagine it'll get even bigger over time. It's very drinkable and the funky and sourness is not overpowering."
"P.S. I just went to my desk 24 hours later and found that the bottle was open and still on the desk with about 3 inches left. I tried it...it was still carbonated, although a bit reduced, and with all of the above characteristics, although perhaps a bit less intense."
"The flavor tasted a bit past its prime, with a funky yeast body and a sour, metallic finish that has a vinous greenery to it. Someone at the tasting remarked that it reminded them of gunpowder. Uber-dry, acidic back with a light mouthfeel and lighter carbonation. Can't say I'd ever buy this for myself, but it was definitely an interesting beer to try."
"After having sampled some of the best Gueuzes and Lambics last night at Ebenezers, I decidided, ""why stop there?"" During the lecture that I attended, this beer was mentioned more than once. It pours a hazy golden color, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Musty basement smells kick things off, followed by a combination of funk and lactic acid. Light citrus fruit melds really well together here with the funkiness. Taste begins very dry, like champagne, and really coats the mouth all the way. More subtle tart notes come in midway through, and leave things as they begun, dry and very similar to a champagne or cider. Carbonation makes it a refreshing beverage, and despite the 8% alcohol count, it comes off as an easy drinker. Our lecturer last night told us that what he looks for in a good Gueuze is a nice balanced profile, and I think that is what we have here. White wine and champagne lovers should give drinks like these a chance. As expected, Boon has a blended beer here of exceptional quality."
"D: A good gueuze. It has lots of character, but the flavors can't keep up with the fantastic aromas in the smell. The flavor is a little too much on the fruity side and there is something in the finish that bothers me - it's hard to put my finger on it, but something seems off. But it's very interesting to see that a gueuze can handle such a high ABV without it even getting noticeable."
"overall a very nice beer from a off style...would recommend and would have again and again"
"i think i've heard that the 750ml bottles are better... or maybe this just needs age so that the yeast can coax out more flavor?"
"D= I liked this beer a lot, but will freely admit it was my first gueuze so I have little frame of reference. Still, it was pretty easy to drink, the sourness was there but not overpowering, the ABV stayed very well hidden, and it was quite refreshing. An excellent beer!"
"Comparisons to champagne are right on. Not overly tart, very refreshing and drinkable."
"Drinkability: Light and tart, but it is missing something. Entirely average, I really just shrugged the shoulders and moved on."
"D- Overall, very well balanced for the style. I really enjoyed it, and think it's definitely worth a try...Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This goes down fast for a gueuze and I'd like another please!"
"Definitely a very nice beer and worth trying. I would rate this slightly lower than some other gueuzes (e.g. Cantillon classic) which seem to be more expressive with regards to funk and tartness."
"Medium body, with low carbonation. Very well balanced. Outstanding."
"I wouldn't pass this beer up if you find it on tap. I've yet to come across a bottle of it, but when I do I will pick it up."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a really nice geuze. The first sip, I didn't love those metal notes, but I quickly got on board and really enjoyed it by the end. Still, an enamel stripper, and not super cheap, you're not gonna drink a lot of these at once."
"I found this to be quite a nice treat and much more impressive than their standard release. Pours a glowing straw color with a silky tan head. The nose has manure, rotting wood, horse blanket, tart citrus fruits, musty wet soil and sweet candy malts. Taste is well balanced and equally complex. Tart and funky up front with a sweet and fruity finish. Crisp body is a bit thin, but well carbonated with a dry finish. Great example of the style."
"Somewhat listless although the appearance warned me of this. Definitely a sipper; the person I went out with took a sip and quipped, ""I'd need to pair this with food."" I feel exactly the opposite, as this shares everything in common with great Italian aperitifs. It whets your appetite, makes your stomach rumbles and gets your taste buds salivating. Enjoyed at the Long Room."
"Mf-is decent, u can definitely feel the bubbles as well as a bit of tartness"
"Shared a few five and six-year-old bottles with friends at Den Trollekelder in Gent. What a treat. It seemed fairly similar to the Girardin 1882 Black Label for the dry oaky flavor that permeated the beer. Additionally there were thin, tart lemon notes while mouth puckering sour tang finished the beer. I wish I'd kept better notes on this beer, it was damn good."
"375ml bottle $9.49 at liquormax in Loveland. Hazy golden-orange color with a quite frothy white head. It smells like citrus and very briefly like manure. The taste is band-aid and rotting citrus fruit with mold. This wasn't a bad beer but it wasn't my cup of tea as far as gueuze goes."
"Extremely drinkable, light mouthfeel with only a little bit of that clinging sour."
"D: Oh so nice. This beer is all around good times. This beer does't set heavy whatsoever and that slight dryness really keeps you drinking. Lovely. Sure, the aroma really threw me off, but it makes up for it in every other category. That feel really brings all this together, and the flavors are damned good. Really starting to jump into these Geuze styles and this is damned good. Get some, love some."
"This is an all around solid gueuze from Boon and one I wouldn't hesitate to pick up again. It's not bracingly sour or hugely complex but makes for an enjoyable sipper and approachable gueuze."
"next time i should have it a bit warmer. as it does mellow out and have a more... pollen finish."
"I will pick up more of this."
"Overall, it's a ""big bark with a little bite""or the nose was huge and the flavor was moderate. Very nice!"
"D: The 8% alcohol is well-hidden behind the oak and wild buggers. If I could find more of this, I'd snap it up."
"Drinkability: This was a sipper. I shared a bottle with the other patrons, and it took us a bit to get through the whole thing. That was to be expected, though."
"drinkability...well this is a 5 year old bottle of beer that has an extra 3 years added on that, so rarity comes into play but its such a refreshing mark of quality among so many 'wanna be' sours, that i gave it a five. such a great brew."
"4 M&4 D: an interesting step forward from the sharper but more tasty Boon's Old Geuze. I guess it does take some more time for this beer to release its concealed complexity, but this beer as young as it is has already shown a mellow body not easy to achieve for the style. I'll certainly re-visit this nice beer, maybe with a ten-year-old sample next time~~"
"Overall a very nice geueze. Not as sour as most might expect, but make no mistake, this is a sour lambic. Awesome flavor profile, and I like the little extra carbo boost. A fine lambic, and one I am excited to put some more age on."
"Good mouthfeel on a bad beer. I feel so guilty recommending this to someone, I confused it with another brew."
"Notes from 9/21/08"
"Pours hazy gold with a foamy white head. Sour apples, peaches, and soem vinegar in the aroma. Sharp, funky taste up front. Sweeter, peach taste towards the back with a mascarpone finish. It always throws me when the brett in these sour beers is able to flip from sour to cheese/butter sweet in the finish. Light, tart, and enjoyable."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Bottle shared via fisherman34, nice to finally try this gueze. Pours a slightly hazed golden straw, one finger white head. Nose- nice pungent sour fruits, vinegar, earthy. Taste- not quite as sour as expected given the sharp smell to the beer, but still had a nice citrus /apple tartness. Thin mouthfeel with a dry earthy quality to the finish. Very easy drinking and high carbonation. Alcohol is hidden for size the of this gueze."
"Bottled sample. Dark gold in colour with a few floaties and spritzy carbonation. Very potent sour aromas of lemon and orange with undertones of dried wood. Way more mellow in the mouth than expected. The sour fruits are upfront again, but without being overly tart or sour. Mild wood and funk are present as well. Rounded mouthfeel without the heavy acidic attack of a Cantillon or Girardin, but still quite dry. Good stuff, but my preference would be for a more sour gueuze."
"D - For a big, sour beer this isn't too hard to drink. It's difficult to judge these beers because I've had very few. I think I prefered the regular Boon Geuze better."
"I wanted to open this after having a small taste of it on Saturday courtesy of chefscott79, I was not very impressed the first time I tried it but tonight it was better, an above average gueuze that did not blow me away or anything, but worth my money, would drink again, recommended"
"Poured into a wine glass. Hazy dark gold with a small white head of fine carbonation. Aroma is semi-sour, with lemon, apple skin, and chardonnay. Flavor is a little acetic, a little citric, and a little lactic all at once. Not arrestingly sour. Musty lemon with mild phenol, cherry, and nutty yeast. Mouthfeel is sublime. Very soft and pleasant. Finish is dry and tart. Nice carbonation. A good intro to gueuze."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied. Very crisp and refreshing. The tartness might make it a tough one on the drinkability scale."
"The three Fontienen is much more of a session beer and I would buy it first if it were redily available."
"D: I craved something sour and this is a bit of a disappointment. I doubt I'll pick it up again"
"Nice, fine champagne like carbonation, the taste is rich yet amazingly subtle, well balanced, tart but less than the average, oaky and fruity, with a very dry finish. Very well balanced, not excessively tart or acidic, no alcohol to be noticed, easy to drink a lot given the high ABV."
"I have a neutral label, not a pink one, from State Line Liquors. A wonderful geuze. Wonderful aroma for the style. What fruit was naturally imparted? This is a bit aged, but still good for another two decades. Funky bold, a white head on creamy yellow with active bubbles. By itself. Oal, sour, very drinkable and satsifying. Good carbontion."
"D: Decent for the style."
"It didn't blow me away in any one area but it just felt like a real solid Gueuze, a style I'm trying to become more familiar with."
"D: A nice tasty lambic from Boon, another winner, just wish it wasn't so pricey."
"Good, but not mind-blowing. Personally, I think they overdid it on the alcohol, which leads to the waxy taste and texture."
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a huge foamy white head that left latticed lace as it slowly subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, yeast, lemon and barnyard/mustiness. The flavor was of citrus, pepper, some of the yeast and barnyard elements also are present. The body is medium light and finish has the tartness one expects from the style. A nice beer."
"Truly a perfect marriage of the old and new lambics!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a tight white head that sticks around as a cap. Nice spicy and herbal notes in the aroma, with black pepper, coriander, and lemon. Tastes very Saison-like with some crisp, clean, lemony sourness, black pepper, coriander, and the barest hint of funkiness at the finish. The funkiness increases somewhat as the beer warms. Slightly bitter herbalness at the end. The mouthfeel is quenching, refreshing, and complex. Great beer, and even a bit challenging while completely refreshing."
"Drinkability: Exceptional. Bone dry, less acidic than most, and overall mild. Chugable."
"Maybe a nice aperitif with some fruit, especially outdoors on a warm day. I'd treat it like a bottle of champagne, but it has more tartness and mustiness than a champagne would. I enjoy all these characteristics separately, and they mesh very well here."
"Thanks Ben, Wow what a day. 6 wonderful brew sampled."
"Tastes tart, funky and grassy. Also has a hit of acidic fruits. The more I drink this beer the more I am able to appreciate it."
"D: One is enough for me. This beer is interesting, and i wish i could get a fresher bottle to compare it, even though the expiration date is 16yrs in the future I think some light got to this one. Not a bad beer, but not one of my favorites."
"Has a golden color that makes it look almost lit from within. It is extremely active, building up, surpisingly, almost no head but leaving a great lacing. Genuinely one of the most interesting looking beers I've ever seen. The smell is apricots, bananas, sour cherries, and pepper. The taste is predominately dry, with some fruit, then a crisp finish. This a fantastic gueuze,;very, very balanced. The mouthfeel is soft & buttery. The drinkability is good but, as with almost all gueueze for me, the sourness limits this. All in all one of the very best of the style I've had. Of course, your friends that don't like beer will still hate it :)"
"Pale yellowish, watery honey like pour with a small offwhite head. Smell is fruity and funky. Sharp bubbly mouthfeel that is a bit too carbonated actually. Taste is tart, acidic, and bland with no sweetness. Nothing appealing to me. Couldn't finish my sample size."
"I paired the second glass with three cheeses: Humboldt Fog goat cheese, Dubliner, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. The Humboldt Fog was a perfect match. The Dubliner was also an excellent match. The Parmesan pairs well, but not outstandingly so."
"The beer poured a golden copper body, clear, with a strong streem of bubbles running to the top of my glass. The head was rather thick but collapsed rather quickly. A solid ring was left behind. The nose was funky and had a bit of citrus. The taste was woody, funky and had notes of vanilla. The taste was also sour, a bit tart but very pleasing to the senses. Overall a well balanced and smooth beer."
"Stopped by the Thirsty Monk in Ashville and had a bottle of this beauty. I told the bartender I wanted the Most sour beer he had (for some reason, I was in the mood for a super sour beer) and this is what he brought out. Pours into a cylindrical a pale straw color with a stark white head, plenty of lacing, and the head retention is amazing. Definitely sour in the taste. A tart and tangy feel with a little bit of saltiness. I really liked this one and will probably have it againg next time I am in the Thirsty Monk."
"This is a real winner. Cleaner than other great gueuzes but still chock full of complexity and uber dryness. Very delicious, I will definitely seek this out again."
"Hazy gold, white head with excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is grassy, lemon zest, funk, and some nice sourness. Taste is sour and inviting. There are some nice funky flavors going on, but this bottle has a little bit of a metallic finish, causing me to lower the score. High carbonation and light body, bone dry finish. It's really good stuff, but the metallicness in this bottle lowers the score; if future bottles don't have the metallic finish, my score will be higher."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Sour from the start, with subtle oak and white vinegar. Lemon and grapefruit flavors are most prevalent, both juice and rind, with an underlying funkiness tying it all together. The finish is dry, leaving a light tartness on the palate. Champagne-like carbonation lends a light, airy mouthfeel."
"Poured from 375 ml bottle ( best before 25.01.2026 ) into Cantillon geuze glass. Poured a hazy golden orange color with a foamy champagne head. Smells of a moldy lemon, wet wheat, and a slight barnyard funk. Taste is sharp acidic citrus with a mild dryness are mellowed by the slight oak undertone. Mouthfeel is light body with a dryness that is well balanced with champagne like carbonation. Its a smooth tasting geuze and would a great thirst quencher on summer day."
"I may have just gotten an old bottle, but I was not nearly as impressed with this one as I have been other lambics."
"."
"A great, refreshing beer. ""Perfect marriage"" indeed. Malty character keeps the funky gueuze (spelled ""geuze"" by this brewery) fairly mild for the style, but allowing enough of it to come through. A great, unique brew. Try pairing with a creamy cheese."
"Recommended. A nice gueuze - I'd take Girardin any day over this, but this is solid."
"Dry, tart, hay and citrus flavors up front. Sour, vague fruits over honeyish malt mid-palate. Metallic notes near the finish, which grows increasingly sour and shows hints of bitterness. Moderate barnyard funk throughout. Very refreshing, and not overly sour. Moderate-bodied with a lively feel. Nice."
"After drinking this, one wonders why something like Sam Adams's Cherry Lambic is allowed to be called a lambic..."
"Fairly astringent, crisp mouthfeel. Thin but spritzy, with champagne-like carbonation. A good intro to Gueuze, very drinkable and approachable, but it's not quite as good as their unblended lambic."
"Overall - an exceptionally complex yet very drinkable beer, even if a tad on the expensive side. ($6.99 for the bottle)"
"Thanks Phatz, for the sours."
"Drinkability: I didn't even realize how much alcohol was in this beer until this review. I could have a few of these just to ponder the complexity of it. This is also a beer with great capability to be paired with spicy, asian food or some sharp cheeses."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: the champagne like carbonation was fizzy. Liked it."
"Drinkability- It was worth dropping $10 to try. About the best per style I have had. Ultimate thirst quencher."
"D: I'm not sure I'd buy this offering again. It was mostly for eheff, who apparently didn't like it. Not a bad brew in my opinion, just not one I'd buy right off the bat again. With that said, I'm glad I got the chance to try it as it had been hyped by a co-worker. It's an interesting style and one worthy of exploring."
"The verdict is out on whether I actually like it. I appreciate its taste and complexity of flavors, but I'm still not 100% sure about it."
"The body is creamy and full, which is fairly odd for the style, but it still has that crisp dry acidity with a tart finish. Very good. Quite drinkable given both the style and ABV. I would highly recommend it to anybody looking to get their feet wet with the often overwhelming gueuze style."
"Another exceptional gueuze from Boon, this being the most complex that I've had from them so far. It is aggressive and harsh yet light and so drinkable, this is one i'll definatly chase down again"
"Drinkability: Crisp and refreshing, very drinkable despite or perhaps because of the sourness."
"Poured out a light straw color with a thin off white head and no lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was acidic with all sorts of funk, barnyard smells, wet horse, stinky leather, and acrid manure. Ok, maybe there wasn't manure. Why do I like this? The taste was straight up tart, but not overly. It is also not too sour as well. A bit more sedated/mellowed than I was expecting, but good nonetheless. This stuff goes down very easy."
"D-This was quite an experience it really surprised me at first, definitely the driest sourest beer I've had to date. The taste became addicting and left me wanting more, and really warmed up to me as it warmed. Surely a brew that should be not be enjoyed too cold. Not sure if I was ready for this but I surely enjoyed it and look forward to trying others in this style. Would like to try pairing with lychee ,cheesecake or crem-brulee"
"a less than good drinkability, but not bad by any means. sip and enjoy."
"I was looking foward to a high octane gueuze.. oh well.."
"Very dry, super complex, ultra great. Very drinkable but you may have to settle in to it a bit."
"Dangerous drinkablity due to the expertly-conceiled alcohol. The most well rounded lambic I've ever had, delicious enough to convert lambic-bashers, and sophisticated enough for the snobbiest of tastes. So far in my gueuze adventures, this one, 3 Fronteinen Oude Gueuze and Cantillon Organic Gueuze are the cream of the crop. Can't wait to try more!"
"12.7 ounce corked and bailed bottle. Best before 26.01.2025. Cork marked SB 40."
"i'm sold. too bad a gueze addiction is more expensive than a smack habit"
"Opinion: Oh my, how do I classify this beer? These beers are always hard for me as they are all uniquely different, and uniquely outstanding. Is it possible for a Gueuze to be too clean? This one is squeaky clean, and only has a few flavors and aromas to pick out. Even as the beer warms, it stays clean. I like the alcoholic warming that you get from this beer as it is completely masked in the flavor. This is my first beer of the evening, and I am already getting happy. Regardless, this is a beer that I really like, and I would absolutely like to drink it again."
"When finished, I wondered how this could be 8%, Just doesn't seem like it."
"Blows my socks off!!!!"
"Beautiful glowing copper in color with creamy white head. Smelling this beer I was first hit with expected barnyard (oh, yeah), but now I am noticing more sour fruits than anything else. Taste is noticeably dry and tart. Carbonation tingles the tongue. This beer is quite light. Very enjoyable and drinkable for when you are in the mood for geuze."
"Taste is very different from the aroma, at least in balance. Very dry up front. An even balance of the green apple fruitiness, the barnyard funk, the light sweetness of the malt and the puckering tartness. Then it finishes nice and dry again. Crisp, clean and dry mouth. Exquisite on the tongue. Very nice. Every now anf then you are struck by a brew that is simply subtle, balanced and well crafted. This is one for me. Been wanting to try this for years and it did not dissappoint. Time to get more."
"Let me state for the records that I don't like lambics, I find them to be tongue searing and stomach churning sour, except this one isn't. An excellent alternative to Chardonnay wine and a good choice for entry in to exploring the world of lambic type sour beers; this is about the only non-sweet lambic I can recommend."
"Drinkability: Not bad at all for a gueuze, but maybe a bit too dry. Could also be a bit more complex."
"Drinkability  It was pushing the limit but just did stay on this side of the sour danger zone. It went down well for such a tart, carbonated ale."
"While I find Lambics, even the hard ones quite drinkable, this one is definitely on the drinkable side. The acidity, for a Lambic, is not that prominent and the seriously funky entero-bacterial notes are quite muted, if not non-existent in the taste. This beer is seriously drinkable despite the 8% alcohol label on the beer. While I could certainly wish for more complexity, this is a perfectly drinkable Gueuze, one which I am happy to be the new owner of 6 bottles. This is also a big step above the Boon Fruit Lambics, though I must admit that, oddly enough, the last batch of Oude Geuze Boon seemed a touch more complex than this bottle. Given this one sample size so far, I would say that on average this is one of the more complex Boon products."
"sour freaks will be a little put-off by the way that the uriney flavors and moldy notes don't take hold in this beer, maybe they will after time (seems like a newer bottle i have here). it's certainly a refreshing change and i dig it. perfect example of why boon is the man.. would love to see his beautiful restraint team up with the russian river crew for some spectacular blending."
"Drinkability: An acquired taste but quite enjoyable"
"Overall: Great stuff indeed. Allegedly the Mariage Parfait is solely comprised of a blend of just three year old lambic, though I am not really sure if it ever gets to the listed 8% ABV, or even how it could get to that kind of strength being a traditional lambic, nonetheless, this is well worth the Benjamins. Recommended."
"A nicely balanced and satisfying geuze. Might be a bit high on the sour funk for the uninitiated."
"Very traditional and fruity but the lack of body and complexity effect the lambic in many ways. Still though, this is a traditional unsweetened lambic which says a lot and definately worth sampling. There are just so many better examples of the style."
"Notes: even after 5 years of cellaring, the 8% is easily detected. Its not hot or solventy, but I would have assumed it would be more subtle then what I taste. The body is thing and very dry. Definitely an interesting beer, not quite as funky as a fresher gueuze."
"Just excellent. I tried and tested a bottle of this alongside of the 'regular' Oude Geuze and candidly there's not a lot of difference. The smell is a little more pungent, the body a little thicker, but it's a tough call to tell them apart. And of course it's a bit stronger and a lot more expensive. Having said that, it's great beer."
"Cloudy deep golden body. Honest 1cm foam. Very dry nose, horseblankety, funky notes of blue cheese, barnyard, hay and brand new leather jacket. Extremely sour, biting acidity. Sharp cidery mouthfeel, highly carbonated, pleasantly full bodied. Big notes of pears, horse sweat. Remarkably dry finish, very puckering. Ultimately not as graceful, approachable or complex as a girardin."
"Tastes of black tea with lemon, not overly sour. Floral and citrus. Drank next to the Blitheringidiot, he said he tasted dandylions, and damned if I couldn't tast and smell both -yeah, I can remember chomping on them in my youth! Leaves a slightly dry, tealike feeling in your mouth. Overall very nice, if not one you could sit back with for hours on end."
"Bottle: Poured a yellow hazy colored beer with a nice bubbly head with standard retention. Aroma is quite sour with some citrus notes also noticeable. Taste is quite refreshing with again some citrus notes and a quite powerful sour taste. The acidity level is just perfect and doesnt unbalance this great beer. I was quite surprise with the high level of ABV for a gueuze but since it hard to notice taste-wise I didnt mind. Overall, a great gueuze with good balance and complexity."
"1995 vintage sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerp. This brew was a lovely golden colour with a nice white head. The aromas are of barnyard funk, horse blanket junk, stumbling monk, some guy shooting crunk, a drunk skunk, and a dirty monk. The taste is an excitingly tart gueuze flavor. This stuff will strip the enaml off of your teeth. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and very lively in the mouth. The drinkability is classic!"
"Overall Impression: This was easily my favorite from the evening, though the Oude Geuze De Cam and the Oude Geuze Mort Subite were also near the top of the list. It's a good geuze if you aren't a huge fan of overwhelming ""lambic character"" (to put it diplomatically)."
"Simply awesome. Very stinky earthy smell. Very earthy flavour, very sour, very citric, slightly bitter, and tart, very complex and a slight woody barrel flavour. Don't hesitate if you see this, you won't regret it."
