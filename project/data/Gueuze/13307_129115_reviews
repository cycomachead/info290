"Pours light golden in color with a thin white head. Smell has funky aromas of brett, hints of grainy malt and some barnyard aromas. Taste is very tart with brett flavors of barnyard hay and funk. Very crisp light and refreshing with some stickiness from the sour."

"Pours a golden hue with a fluffy white two finger head and sporadic lacing, smell is oak, funk and white grapes all the usual suspects I expect, feel is medium bodied with lively spritzy carbonation with tastes of white grapes, sour meyer lemons but not too sour, oak and finished with a dry funkiness and overall another well executed brew by the man cheers."

"Overall pretty nice, with a distinct lambic flavor.  Very nice."

"Overall: Really nice sour ale, though if it wasn't printed on the label, I wouldn't have guessed that it was spontaneously fermented. Also, I don't believe they followed the grain bill for a lambic, or that this is a blend of young and old beer, so I'm not sure the classification as a gueuze is all that accurate."

"On the high side of the sour range with a lot of green apple and white grape fruit character paired with oak and some heavy funk. The acidity sort ends up being dominant to most of the other flavors."

"Light bodied throughout, dryness is celebrated from start to finish as its sheer acidity strips the thirst from the palate and ushers in a highly refreshing taste. Leaving the mouth with sharp astringency and the ironside taste of sea brine."

"Hues is allllmost great. The initial pour and aroma are superb, deep, complex funk, lemons and bright peach notes. On the palate this is just a hair sweet, which gives this a slightly flat sweet/sour dynamic. It's excellent and very drinkable, with hints of oak and cognac, but a bit more depth and complexity would be welcome. I'm hopeful enough I plan to pick up a few more bottles to set aside."
