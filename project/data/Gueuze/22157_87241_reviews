"First beer from the brewery I wasn't impressed with. More like nail polish remover."
"Smelled awful, tasted like nail polish, low carb, just not what a true Gueuze should be."
"Horrid. Straight band aid flavored vinegar that has been fished out of the toilet"
"Straight nail polish remover.  A 2.5 was a gift. BAD!"
""
"Very impressed with this one. Can hang with the big boys for sure."
"The mouthfeel is very dry and obviously, completely flat. Overally, I think this could be a decent brew if it was properly carbonated, but unfortunately something was not handled properly. I'll revisit again if this is corrected."

"O: A very nice example (especially one made in the US) of the style - enough sourness to keep sour lovers interested but definitely not overpowering. Very enjoyable."

"Overall, this beer is an underrated gem. I never had a fresh sample but I have to believe 3-4 years is the sweet spot. There is incredible depth and one would never guess this beer came from a brewery in an industrial park north of Cincinnati. This is up there with many Belgian examples of the style. Absolutely outstanding."

"This beer is SO underrated. It is a superb representation of how a gueuse should taste - and the barrel adds complexity and flavor. I can compare this to the better know gueuzes and American wild ales."

"Taste has a juicy, lemony citrus quality and bursts with citric acid and musty wet wood. Dry woody finish, gripping and tannic with a pleasant lingering aftertaste. Soft carbonation, it's barely there and ebbs over time, but it's not completely flat. The 3-year-old lambic really adds some complexity and authenticity here, it's vaguely reminiscent of Cantillon Classic Gueuze with less body, funk, and bubbles."
"Overall, I'm fairly disappointed in this beer. Carbonation is no where close to where it should be, so it can't help cover up the lack of a strong sour flavor profile. The fruit flavors are nice, but they never really make the transition into a unique gueuze flavor."
"Overall - Decent sour. Not very exciting."

"D) Overall, it's a bit on the bright side but I think it's fair enough."

"O - It started out rather bland, but the tartness grew. I am partial to it since it is from my home state, and I had to drink Cincinnati beer for the Wild Card game tonight."

"O: Very nice. a pleasant easy drinker. i would have liked a little more complexity and a little more carbonation. /85"

"Pours with no carbonation, okay minimal white head glowing orange golden body clouded to apricot tones. I'm over the carbonation issue aroma is cider like tart yogurt like zing with mellow citrus earthy funk laden wild yeast notes. Tart white grapes citrus peel like zing with long lasting waves of sour lactic notes however its really enjoyable and easy to drink that's if you enjoy sours. I'm shocked how this Cincinnati based brewer is churning out sours, this is dated 2011 I also have a lambic dated 2012. Such a nice change of pace their regular offerings are mediocre but this shows promise, although I may be chasing this with a Pepcid. Medium bodied almost absent carbonation finishes bone dry like some white wines or ciders. I have nothing but good things to say about this gueze pretty damn authentic flavor someone has been inspired by Belgian brewing traditions!"

"750ml bottle that I received from one of you fine people sometime last year. Bright yellow color. Aroma was nicer than the Rivertown lambic, no cider just lemons and hints of sourness. Flavor was good and wild and occasionally made me pucker. Fruity but still not quite an authentic gueuze. Much like the Lambic from Rivertown this is a fine wild ale but not quite a match for authentic lambic. I hope they keep at it though and I respect them for going down that road."
"Seems like Rivertown is hit or miss on the sours. Ojos Negros, Sour Cherry Porter, and Lambic are all excellent. This gueuze is not. It isn't at the level of Pestilence, but it was disappointing. My biggest complaint with this beer was that it had absolutely NO carbonation. It was as flat a beer as I have ever seen come out of a bottle (excluding some of my early day homebrew). As far as I am aware, a gueuze is supposed to have extremely high carbonation, almost champagne-like. The aroma and flavor were right on par with many beers in the same style. Very sour with notes of lemon and sour grapes as well as some must. Dry and tart. It was just very dull and bland. The lack of carbonation really hurts this beer. I would pick it up if I saw it from a new batch just to see how it is with carbonation."

"O-I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, reminds me a bit of the Bear Republic's Tartare. I would buy this again. Thanks Bowling Green, KY."
"3.25 D: I have no doubts that this was a good beer when it went into the bottle. Too bad the technical aspects fucked it up. The reason for this not having the proper carbonation doesn't matter. This is how I bought it so this is how it is reviewed. I haven't heard about this being much of a problem, so pick it up if you see it."

"Pretty good beer and glad someone in the midwest is making good sours on a consistant basis. Probably my favorite of Rivertown's offerings so far."
"Overall nice but not great. The blending and barrel round out the sour funk well, but overall just a bit too thin."
"O - Overall not a bad beer just watery. Wish the mouthfeel was better as that really affects the overall enjoyability."

"Where the beer carries a more somber and moderate stride of intensity, the complete ensemble of flavor profiles of gueuze are all alive, well portrayed, and properly balanced- there seems to be a sense that the beer is dialed down with regard to intensity in taste, sourness, strength, dryness, and overall rusticity. It's a fascinating beer that graduates up from the syrupy fruited versions and into the authentic world of sour."

"Overall: This was a very nice beer. The fact that it wasn't super sour made it interesting in my mind. I enjoyed the funky notes. I would have more given the chance."
"The beer is golden yellowish orange and fairly hazy with a small white head. The aroma offers funk, citrus, hay, oak. Nice flavor. Smooth on the palate with some funky citrus. Acetic character disappears rapidly in the finish. Pretty good."

"I don't review often, but I felt with the lack of reviews on this beer I should go ahead and do it. This is an enjoyable beer and can easily be split between two people. This is also a terrible gueuze. It lacks complexity, carbonation, and clarity. A gueuze is the champagne of beer and on most accounts this beer lacks all the qualities one associates with a gueuze. If this beer was branded as an Ohio sour, I would have given it a 3 star rating, but since they are attaching the name gueuze to the beer, it leads to a let down of expectations."

"O: This is a fine example of the style that has nice sour aromas and flavors but isn't overpowering. The cedar adds to the complexity."
"This beer is a great tragedy. I enjoyed the flavor very much, but am forced to penalize it because of the complete lack of effervescence that is expected in this style. Sadly, I cannot recommend this beer (unless you have the ability to carbonate it yourself)."

"750 ml bottle. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with no head at all. No lacing, either. Aroma is nice but subtle, the brew smells like tart lemons, and a bit of musty funk. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's a bit of a cidery flavor too. It's nice and tart, it's not a strong tartness although it does get better as the beer warms up some. There's also a lingering tart finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, it has low carbonation and it's very easy to drink. I think it's a solid brew overall. Definitely worth a try. $11.99 a bottle."
"This is truely a unique brew. 13$ a bottle. If I handn't had a sample I would never had spent that much on an unknow brew."
