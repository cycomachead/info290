4.12,7.6,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Food match: Sour beers are interesting to match for as they create a mouth watering sensation that must be met with equally mouth watering food. Filet mignon wrapped with bacon, stewed mushrooms, celeriac mash and a side of roasted broccolini... damn I'm hungry.","doktorhops","Mar 22, 2012"

3.85,0.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Bronze with a small white head. Good nose of earthy funk, lemon, apples that hints at the sourness to come. The first sip is mouth puckeringly sour but a couple of sips in and you're fine. Kind of cidery and also champagne-like at the same time in flavour with a nice acidic balance to it. Flavour is mouth filling and pleasant. The complexity is interesting and I'm enjoying the beer but I probably need to pick my gueuze moments more carefully.","juju7","Jul 08, 2007"
3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"12.7 ounce bottle, poured into a tulip glass, either a 1988 or 1998 bottle, could not read the date fully as it has faded, golden yellowish orange color, 1/2 inch bubbly white head, some retention, not much lacing, cardboard, lemons, funk, wild yeast, orange peel, oak, and champagne, starts off with mellow tartiness, mostly citrus in the middle, finish is dry but not near as sour as I had hoped, this if a funkier gueuze rather than a mouth puckering one, actually even sweetens up by the end, dry, somewhat acidic, and slightly sweet mouthfeel, thin bodied, overly carbonated and definitely gushed when it was popped, aftertaste did not last long, easy to drink and very light overall, no alcohol in the flavor","Floydster","May 30, 2007"
3.65,-4.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Always a winner, maybe I'll re-review with a fresher sample at a later date.","revdrjbob","Jan 12, 2007"
3.97,3.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is highly drinkable actually. I was expecting it to be much more sour and tarty. A style I'll be looking out for more of.","brendan13","May 12, 2006"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Crisp & light, long sour touch with light body.","vancurly","Mar 27, 2006"
3.72,-2.9,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"good light mouthfeel. goes down nicely, but for me, its definitely a sipper. not something im going to drink much of, but enjoyable on occasion.","joecast","Sep 30, 2005"
4.2,9.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured an odd yellow with a large head which went away within a few moments. Smell was very odd, almsot had a chardonnay aroma to it that I have never seen in a beer. Taste was also very odd, but in a good way. Never have I tasted a brew that was so tart yet sweet at the same time. Again, white wine flavors were dominant with some vanilla and oak tastes coming through too. Mouthfeel was light bodied, which made it a very easy beer to drink. I could certainly see myself drinking a few on a hot day. Final Comments: A beer that everybody should try at least once. The fact that it has so many interesting complexities makes it totally worth it.","jamie2dope","Beers"
4.12,7.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A drinkable gueuze but just too sweet to be anything outstanding or particularly memorable","cypressbob","0"

4.54,18.5,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a really nice gueuze with a great farmy profile of funky yeasts and bacteria, especially in the aroma, and a substantial and delicious fruity sourness without being abrasively tart.","Stopper","Oct 11, 2002"
3.5,-8.6,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Only average at vest. The appearance and smell were good and then it was downhill from there.","Popsinc","Beers"
3.72,-2.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Actually really quite nice, sweeter and thinnner than some of the better gueuzes and more assertive ones. Sweetish start, sour finish, light, refreshing, grassy and citric, i quite like it, more of a session gueuze.","rastaman","0"
