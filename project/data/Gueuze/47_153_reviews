"hazy orange, very mild aroma and a clean taste with a light vegetal character.  Mildly drying finish, moderate carbonation.  Allowed to warm, aromas of lemon zest emerge.  Overall, good but simple and lacking the complexity of many other gueuzes, but reasonable in its price range."

"O- Great beer, dry and easy to drink. I will try it again."
""
"Not too familiar with many geueze lambics, but if the flavor characteristics for this style are funky and sour, then they hit the mark. This is a very tart, dry beer that is also very refreshing. Almost like a sour grapefruit without the sweet. No hop bitterness whatsoever. Definitely has that aged, oaky dry finish. Will seek out more of this style, but sparingly. Can get pretty pricey for just one bottle"

"Definitly an acquired taste. Having not too long ago discovered this style, I find it to not be very available where I live. I expect to try again at some point when possible."

"Definitely a nice gueuze considering the availability. Don't expect the quality and taste of Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, or even Russian River, but this is certainly a decent gueuze given the fact that it's readily available at your local beer store for 6-7$. Better than Lindenman's Cuvee Rene in my opinion. A good ""beginner"" gueuze to get your friends into funky beers."
""
"O-While I say this is not my favorite sour beer, my local grocery store carries it at a VERY reasonable price, so I can imagine it being a default summer drink at home beer, and it is definitely growing on me!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is light, which works well for this one, with as constant a crispness as the carbonation would lead one to expect. It's also as dry as one might expect."

""

""
""
"O-This is an interesting beer that seems to be a cross between a light ale and champagne. A style that I would like to explore a little bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Perfectly fine geuze and widely available. Nothing to write home about but very enjoyable with a steak."
""
"It's missing something."

"O - I know this is a famously awesome beer, and even though I can't describe it well, I am a big fan. Possibly my entrance into the world of the sours."
""
"A really good geuze. Brings the funk and style that one would want from a geuze."
""
"Overall: My first Gueuze on my 22nd birthday so it was pretty awesome. Not like a beer at all…different but refreshing and very good. Not too sour at all. My friend who doesn't even drink beer liked it so much and called me a week later asking where he can get some of that ""Booze Gooze."""
""
""
""
""
"O: Smooth. There is a woody quality that shows up a bit in the finish. Not a huge fan of the musty taste in the beginning, but it fades and the rest of the taste is quite nice. 4"
""
"Overall: A bit strange for me, I've never had such a sweet lambic before. I need to research the actual date of the body to better understand how this beer may have matured. I'd be willing to try it again, but would like to find a very fresh bottle as a comparison. Cantillon is still my top geuze..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is well balanced with a light sour and very earthy slightly vegetal flavor. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated lightly for a smooth Mouthfeel."

"The beer appears hazy and rusty orange hued with a half inch of white head. The aroma is decent, with notes of hay, funk, oak. The flavor is earthy and oaky, and much sweeter than I expected. Not as delicate or smooth on the palate as I was hoping. Sharpness in the finish. Half the bottle remained the next day, which is a tell tale sign, since my house is like a gueuze vacuum. I'd be willing to try it again, hopeful of a different result."
"o - Overall a decent gueuze, but not one of my favorites. Seemed a little old and oxidized, but surprised it hadn't held up well. Nose was nice and funky, and would be willing to try again, maybe as a fresher bottle."
"As you let it sit and sip it, it transforms into something even better (kind of like the truck transforming into Optimus Prime). The funky flavors come out without adding sourness."
"While I don't have much of a basis for comparison as this is the first gueuze I have ever had, this seems to be an excellent example of the style in addition to being extremely tasty. I'm sure I will be drinking more of this in the future."
"Overall: Great example of the style"
"12 ounce bottle, but my bottle says 6.5% ABV. I think the stamp on the back label means best before 06.08.2027. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy golden color with about a 2 inch frothy white head. The head sticks around for a long time, but there isn't much lacing left behind on the glass. Aroma is hay, funk, apple vinegar, and a bit of lemon. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, it's nice and tart and funky. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's well carbonated and also has a dry finish. I think it's a good overall brew, I'd buy this one again."
"The aroma was a bit lighter then I was expecting, but still tremendously good. Rich nose of tart apple vinegar, sour grapes and a touch of wet hay. Enormously complex, as it warms it comes across with a light wheat or herbal like quality and just the tiniest amount of spice prickling the nose. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes of sour and biting vinegar flavor coming across on it right away. Light grapes and even a touch of wheat coming through mid palate, especially as it starts to warm. Mellow grassy flavors are mingling very well within the flavor now. \"
"O: A nice introductory geuze, not outstanding, but very good. It was a nice pairing with dessert."
"Best Before: 12.12.2025 or 12.12.2021 (couldn't make out the last number). Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal slightly off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, funk, and cherries. The flavor was of swet malt, wood, funk, slight tart, very subtle mothballs, and cherries. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. I wish I would have been able to read the last digit on the date to get an idea on the age of this one. Seemed fairly fresh though based on the flavors. I could however see this one evolving very nicely over time. Great aroma and good flavor going on here. A definite must try."
"D: A very nice example of the style... delicious. Went extremely well with some fresh goat cheese."
"I plan on trying more of this style. This is a good segway into sour adn tart beers."
"Notes: Boon makes a pretty solid Gueuze. It's a light-bodied brew, and very refreshing. Definitely better than other offerings from this brewery."
"Balanced from start to finish. Another excellent gueuze!"
"D: As horrible as all the descriptors I've used are, I can see how this could be an acquired taste. Not entirely unpleasant, I guess it isn't all THAT bad. Since this is my first geuze, I have no idea if this is a bad bottle or if it is indeed supposed to taste like this. *shrug* I'd try it again, preferably in the company of a geuze guru."
"Unless the bottles vary widely and are occasionally amazing, I see no reason to ever buy this when you can get better geuezes or other wild ales for comparable or lower prices. It really was a mess. The lack of sourness or tartness really highlighted the fact that the majority of what was happening in the taste was brett as dirt and surprising bitterness. The most boring wild ale I've ever had."
"Pours a nice hazy golden yellow with a bit of white wispy head. Wonderful funky and floral nose, citric and delicious. Taste isn't quite as tart as I was hoping for, it seems a bit restrained. Still, very clean and good as far as the flavor profile goes. A bit of funk, some nice crisp lemon edge to it, some malt poking through over a long dry finish. Mouthfeel was prickly and light, pretty standard for a good geueze. Good drinkability, it was a nice beer to have with my dinner, I was glad to have gotten to try it."
"D- To tell you the truth I could of downed this whole bottle in one swoop, this was surprisingly incredibly easy to drink and my stomach was not buggin after a few ounces or so. Great stuff at a great price, at least at WF's."
"Pours relatively clear golden with a light head. Aromas are tropical with some pineapple and cantaloupe. Flavor is a blend of diet Orangina/Sprite and Jolly Rancher. Crisp and refreshing, though not terribly complex for a gueueze. A sour finish with a slight tea-like astringency. This is a reasonable gueuze but if you have a selection, opt for the Cantillon or Girardin."
"Flavor is decent, but not the best gueuze out there. Full of sharp tartness and citrus notes. Funk is great, but the whole flavor seems a little watered down or something. There's also an earhty, fresh cut grass characteristic that resides heavely in the aftertaste. The oak aging is also very noticable as there's definite wood notes. Light and crisp mouthfeel and high carbonation. Again, a nice gueuze, not the best."
"Drinkability: Nice example of a Gueuze at an affordable price. Not as high level as Cantillon, but a very enjoyable drinker. I see more of these in my future. Aging some to see what happens."
"On a spectrum from Cantillon to Lindemans, (sour to sweet), Boon would fall one quarter past the latter towards the former. The intense sourness is there, but the extreme puckering dryness is not. That is by no means supposed to be a knock, just a point of reference. This was a very enjoyable gueuze."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that I would have again, but I won't be seeking out more any time soon."
"Overall, this is one heck of a strong representation of this style. I have a hard time finding any faults with it, and it just seems to improve as it passes cellar temperature and approaches the ambient air temperature. A good one to share, as are most old lambics, due to the acidic sourness."
"Easy drinking, this would work well with a oil and vinegar ceasar salad. This beer is a little pricey, but it is true to the authentic style. Not amazing, but certainly a classic."
"Thin mouthfeel with a champagne like consistency and strong carbonation."
"Overall not the best of the Gueuze category but solid."
"D – Very luxurious, pairs exceptionally well, a very nice example of the style."
"Overall, this is ok. Probably a good geuze for a beginner. It gives you a little funk but allows it to be very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A very good and tasty gueuze. I could have two or three. I like the dry apple taste."
"D: A very well rounded geueze, which was enjoyed to the fullest extent."
"Will get more of this tasty beer for later and cellering."
"This is my first brew of this style, and it's a nice introduction to sour beers. It's fairly approachable and goes down nicely."
"interesting that this is their regular gueuze (not the ""oude"" version), yet seems to follow the traditional/""oude"" style and doesn't appear to be sweetened. i suppose that deserves some credit."
"M/D - Light body with dry, tart aftertaste. This style of beer I always find incredibly drinkable, and this is a great example of one!"
"Notes: Outstanding, a very good example of the style."
"drinkability: was slow for me. I need to get used to it. I'll retry when I appreciate the style more later."
" It certainly has no complxity because it has almost no flavour profile at all. It's ok and I can see why someone who enjoys just having tartness or sourness might like it, but I get almost no funky yeasty character or anything else and I see no point in ever drinking anything that has so little taste. I might as well drink tap water."
"Pours a somewhat hazy straw-yellow with a thick and not persistent white head - not very inspiring, but this is the beer's weakest point. Aroma is quite strong, yeasty with malty and fruity undertones. Flavor is rich and crisp, malty with a good sour-apple component and a touch of hops. Texture is edgy and fizzy, leaving a pleasantly sour aftertaste."
"Wishing I would have picked up quite a few more at clear-out prices."
"Very carbonated. Big white head. Hazy golden orange/yellow in color. Has a bit of a hay and barnyard smell. Intense funky lemon sourness in the taste. This was my very first gueze and I loved it."
"From a 750 ml bottle, this brew poured a hazy straw color with a towering white head. Beautiful lace and a yeasty-cloudy character to the liquid. The aroma is at first barn-yard like, but also sweet and fruity (apple and pear). The barn-yard, horse-like funk is good, but could be a little more intense. The taste is moderately sour, but quite balanced. It's not the pucker-your-lips, eye-squintingly sour that I expected....it's very well balanced and quite drinkable. Wheat, yeast, and fruit flavors dominate the flavor. Spritzy and light in body. Despite the fact that I first found it a little shy (for a lambic), this is a very nice Geuze."
"I could not drink this beer regularly, but when paired with food, the possibilities really open up."
"D - this is the second gueze I've ever had. I think that Cuvee Renee was much better. This one lacked a diverse flavor profile."
"Bought in Orlando at Knightly Spirits and drank in Austin. Sturdy White head, very nice lacing. A hazy orange color. Sour apple aroma. Some sweetness. Stinky cheese, awesome. Yummy tart flavor, with a touch of sweetness. Zesty, drying. Very refreshing. I could sit back and sip this all day."
"""Oh, but you didn't, mother. I came looking for you. Every night. I found you, months ago. And I realized I'm happier here. I'll watch you when you least expect it, but I'm never coming back."""
"A good beer, probably the most sour one i've had so far. That being said, its got depth beyond the sourness that produces a nice crisp beverage. Not really my bag of tea, but i appreciate the effort."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Dark cloudy goldenrod with a humungous off-white head, more than 4 fingers tall. Excellent retention and absurd chunks of lacing. Aroma is mostly citrus peel and lemony sour with an orangey sweetness to it. Huge citric acid. Flavor is not nearly as sour as the aroma. Some of the lemony tartness is definitely still there, but bretty funk is at least even with sourness/acidity in the overall profile. Earthy and saison-like at times. Nice dry finish. Kind of like a part-gueuze part-Orval blend. Interesting and tasty, could be a good intro-to-sours beer."
"Pours an impressive golden color with an even more impressive big, white, thick, fluffy head that refuses to go away. Immediately, the aroma cues my senses and I get that sour, puckering reaction like when you anticipate eating a Warhead. It is super funky and has hints of citrus and leather. The taste intensifies the character of this Gueuze. On the palate, strong funk, earth, and bits of leather come to mind. It is pleasantly sour and very drinkable. Wonderful beer in my opinion. I love the sourness and I will definitely buy this again."
"Good stuff. My first geuze. Definitely won't be my last."
"Pours a clear cedar color with a fizzy head and no lacing. The nose has tart fruits, cabdy malts and some subtle oaky funk. The taste has a bit more of the sour citrus component which is well balanced by the malts and again a very subtle musky wood presence. Light body is well carbonated. Not the most complex, but a fine example of the style. A steal at $5 a bottle. Should age well for many years to come."
"Unique. Pairs well with brie, I recommend you do the same."
"D - Tried it with pan seared pheasant with a brandy and apple reduction. The carbonation detracted so we switched to wine. Oh, well."
"Drinkability is good here but not as nice as the Marraige Parfait."
"D - For such a far-removed style from the majority of beers available, this is very drinkable. It's not quite session material due to the intensity of foreign flavors, but it certainly isn't over the top."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a very easy drinking gueze, although not my favorite, as I prefer more lacto. Still, damn good, I've got more in the cellar and look forward to letting them age."
"375ml bottle 6.5% abv best by date of 2/12/2025. Nice soft orange color with a super fluffy white head. It smells like dusty lemons, sour fruit, really nice. A little light on flavor, not too sour, kinda watery but bubbly at the same time. I wish the flavor was a strong as the aroma..."
"D: a very easy drinker and a great intro to sour beers, as many in my party would attest. A great pairing with the moules and frites I had. Pure heaven."
"Any opportunity to sip a beer out of a Champagne Flute...I'm on it. Dark glow of amber orange. Aromas of white grapes and vinegar. These treats are so mysterious...and I'm all about awe. Sour wood provides a habitat for moss. Fungi grow from bitter rinds. A dew of vinegar keeps the air damp and ties in the scenery. Lay off the Kombucha; substitute a Gueze to tone the organs and create an aura of well-being. Namaste."
"Drinkability: this was the first Gueuze I ever had and I was not very imperssed. I might buy another bottle later in life, but for now I'll stick with the fruit lambics."
"D: A great gueuze, tasty and drinkable, just wish they weren't so expensive, the bottle cost me 8 bucks."
"Poured into a Chimay goblet with a bit of yeast it is a nice and lively looking cloudy golden amber with a quickly dissipating pure white head. The aroma is pleasantly sour with bits of lemon rind and sour grapes. The taste is bitingly sour, sour apple sour grape and lemon but with a very snappy and refreshingly crisp mouthfeel. I am having a rough time trying to think of other things to say about this beer as its the first of the style that I've tried but it is very tasty even for such a sour beer, great for a hot day. Highly recommended."
"D- This was a killer beer. It had the perfect balance of sour and sweet with a wonderful complexity and mouthfeel. This is how it is done, folks."
"All in all a great traditional Lambic and one that I would drink again and recommend!"
"Good pucker, mildly earthy. Fine balance. Well done."
"D: I would have to say one and done, but the one is very nice."
"Pours a light golden with a big white fluffy head that recedes moderately fast. Not really sure how to describe this other than sour. But it's also light and refreshing with a nice prickly carbonation. I really enjoyed this sour beer and although I've had a bunch of other types of sours, this was actually my first Gueuze."
"I will say that this is my first review of a gueuze lambic, and I am not too terribly experienced with traditional lamics. Pours a very carbonated yellow/orange, clear, with good carbonation and nice fizzy white head that dissipates pretty quickly. Nose is of tart vinous flavors. Taste follows, nice and tart, but not a sour as some I have had recently (drie fonteinen in particular. Nice sour wine like notes and good carbonation. mouthfeel seems to be as good as most of the gueuze I have tried. drinkability is good considering the style. Good brew. I am just getting into this style and am more intrigued after this one. Looking forward to drinking the other one in the cellar in 2020 or so."
" I could not quaf something this intense, but had no problem killing a small bottle in under 1/2 an hour."
"The green, 12 oz., corked and caged bottle was picked up at Green's, and warmed up to cellar temperature before opening. The cork came out readily while I was trying to insert the corkscrew, and the pour was bubbly and restrained. The body was pale yellow with a lot of haze. The smell was acidic with loads of barnyard horse blanket due to the wondrous handiwork of the wild yeast and bacteria. The taste was cidery, tart, oaky, bone dry, and not quite as funky as the other Geuzes I've tasted before. Very refreshing, and a touch thicker than most blended lambics. Very easy to drink and a lot more approachable, due to the lack of mouth puckering acidity, when compared to Cantillon."
"Verdict: A beer that lives up to its' style. A slow sipper that doesn't skimp on the funk. I like it for what it is."
"D = Interesting question as to drinkability. This is the first true gueuze I've had. It is a very sour beer, but not nearly as sour as a true sour beer (think Duchesse du Bourgogne). It is a very enjoyable beer in my opinion, I would definitely recommend it and will definitely drink it again but only after I've had more of the class for valid comparison."
"Drinkability is very high with this one. If i wasn't such a fan of Cantillion i would say this is an excellent Geuze but there are more extreme versions out there so i will just say this is very good."
"Poured into la chouffe belgian flute. Head faded fast with no brussels lace. Salty, tart bretty lambic barnyard funk. First sip tasted like a dry apple juice. Not as dry as champagne but had a dry aftertaste. No hops present and only a small malt backbone. A far tamer version than the marriage parfait."
"D- sweet geuze"
"Taste/texture: Lemon, sour apples, white wine vinegar. Tart but not overly acidic. The finish is sour and dry but fairly clean. Extremely crisp on the tongue and very refreshing. A good gueueze with high drinkability."
"This is a world-class example of the style. Nice balance and subtle complexities. I recommend it both to beginners and veterans of the style. Nice!"
"Overall, no hops, no malt, all lambic and really good. As funky and fantastic as it gets. Pick one up."
"Drinkability - Whenever I splurge on a gueuze, I always marvel at how much I like them....I'm quite sure that just one short year ago, I'd probably have hated this because my beer palate was not developed enough. I would have dismissed it as too champagne-like. I'm not a fan of champagne, but I am a big fan of this and others like it. Complex, enjoyable, easy to drink. Very nice."
"This beer pours a pale orange color. The head is massive, billowy, and bright white with an orane tint. The aroma is of lemons, orange rind, hay, and ha a nice sourness, and acidity to it. The taste is of less sour, and acidic than the aroma, and more earthy. Hay and barnyard flavors run riot, with some zesty orange and lemon rind in there too. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with nice, high, tingly carbonation. Overall, this is a fine gueuze, and I would certainly have it again."
"Seems like a good solid gueuze. I wouldn't turn it down on a hot summer day, but I wouldn't seek this one out either."
"Apparently this and the oude geuze are the same, as it is a combination of young and old lambic.Smell of yeast, and alcohol. This is dry, sparkling, with a retaining crowning head of gold onto apple juice colour. Taste has characteristics of apple juice and much better deeper in the meal, and not as interesting outiside of geuze geeks before. Not too dry nor sweet. This has been likened to champagne."
"Interesting, different, well-crafted brew but certainly not outstanding. The salty taste at the end, although adding complexity limits the amount one can have."
"Pours out a copper color and looks about identical to an APA with tons of carbonation in the body. My frist 2 pouring attempts ended up with all head and no beer, so once the third chance came, I knew to pour more slowly. Still builds a massive head on the pour (and it actually keeps on growing even after a minute or so of setting the glass down). Bubbles are really fat in the head and it clings to the glass. Leaves great lacing. Acidity and funk are all there, but they aren't so forceful as to conceal the cracker-like wheat and the pale malts. Taste is tart to sour upfront while an odd, but pleasing, astringency washes over the rest of the tongue. Very dry, but, compared to some other geuzes, this has a good bit of residual sweetness. Not as harsh as I'd hoped this one to be. Mouthfeel is light, but it seems all the carbonation went to the head instead of staying in the body for a spritzier mouthfeel. Although maybe not as interesting as some others, the relative mellow character of this really lends itself well to high drinkabiliy. Overall, a fine lambic."
"Nice carbonation on the tongue. Drinkability is above-average: the sourness prevents it from going down particularly quickly."
"Pours a hazy golden, small white head forms, disappears rather quickly, sits along the edges of the glass, some lace spots. Smell is super funk, lots of citrus, hay, yeast, barnyard, acidic/vinegar, caramel, very funky, I like. Wow, very acidic, apple juicy, caramel, cidery, funky citrus in the finish, sour fruits, very coating. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high carbonation, warming sensation, feels nice in the mouth. Lacking in character for the style, not too impressed with it, but neat nonetheless."
"Drinkability: For the style, this beer excells in this area. Not too high on the abv and plenty of flavor. If you can get, and afford, alot of this, go ahead and get a bunch. Would make a good night."
"Drinkability: I must say this is better than i expected as this is my first Geuze. I was a bit itimidated with the general description of the style found around the web and books. I dove in and was rewarded , im really lovin the flavor , and wishing it wasn't so pricey , but its definatly worth it for the care taken to make and age this treat. Recommended , and i can't wait to try some of the more intense versions of the style!"
"Cheers!"
"If you like this type of beer more power to you but my pallet may not be developed enough for this one yet. I will have to work on that. Drinkable but it took some getting used too. Overall this is a decent beer offering that is quite unique and very flavorful. This one is certainly not for everyone out there, but if you are looking to expand your pallet certainly give this one a try."
"The first Geuze I tried a year back just turned me off. Maybe it was all the other great ones I was trying as well or maybe it was such a different experience. I was hesitant coming back to it, but am now pleased I picked opened it up last night. Pours a nice head that retains itself til the end. Smells of citrus fruit, chardonnay, oak barrels. A bit on the sour-Belgian style side. The wild yeast is something I'm still trying to grasp. A bit acidic. Will get used to it and try the style again"
"This beer assaults the tastebuds at first, and then becomes more and more enjoyable as your tastbuds adjust. Better than average drinkability."
"Drink one or two, mix and match with other Gueuze examples..."
"Could be much more drinkable, but it's definitely not a heartburn beer. It's a smooth tartness. Sour and acidic without being vinegary. In the future, I'll probably pass though. Six dollars for 12 oz bottle is steep when I can find a better gueuze in the same price range."
"I've never really liked this style of beer, but I like to judge beers based on their style, not against all other beers in existence. For the style, this is a decent gueze. Worthy a try, but far from the best."
"I believe this one was past it's prime but it was enjoyable. I will try other gueuzes before returning to this one, but I hope to return."
"A complex and multidimensional Geuze that is quite enjoyable."
"Considerably milder and less offensive than most Geuze. Lots of bubbles. More so than is typical. Typical feet and battery acid smell and taste only lighter. Lots of rotten lemons. I like it a lot but it is just way more mellow than most. Lots of yeast creates a particulate feel. Light, dirty yellow body. Spritzy. Very clean. All the elements are there. They are just smaller than normal. This would be a good starting geuze."
"Very crispy and refreshing. Tart and clean. The sourness is not overbearing, even for those not yet accustomed to the style. Easy drinking. I enjoyed this ale very much. These guys have found a nice balance between the challanging sour/barnyard/earth flavors and something fun and simple that's easy to enjoy. Cheers!"
"D: This beer and style are not going to be for everyone. Of the few lambic & gueuze examples I've tried, this is a very good one. Strong flavors that open the senses. Very good smell & tatse - I'll enjoy this again."
"Pale, hazy gold with strong bubbly carbonation helping to maintain a nice head. Aroma of tart apple and vinegar. Not real strong in potency, but enough to give you an idea. The taste has a medium tartness, with notes of sour peach and apple. Finish is rather crisp, and the flavors are fleeting. Light body, strong on bubbles. Very tasty, only an average amount of sourness, but this may make it easier to drink. Not so much for complexity, but well done..."
"I actually think I like this better than the MP. It's lower alcohol (not sure I really beleive the 8% on the other), but it is a really good drinker on a lazy day."
"The drinkability is o.k. but not great because it is such an overwhelming flavor. It is great in small doses."
"Drinkability: I'd be lying if I said I didn't find the sourness in this beer a little overpowering, so for me the drinkability score is less than average, even though it is fairly tasty and refreshing. I can only handle this in smaller volumes. A great beer to pair with fruit or brie (or both), though. I'd say, serve this at a brunch... hell, it would probably make a pretty awesome mimosa."
"Emmenently quaffable and a bottle I would never, ever turn down!"
"Opinion: This is an excellent beer, and one that I will definitely be drinking again. I think that it is a touch mild when compared to some other Gueuze beers, but it is still excellent. I am a bit more partial to the more assertive beers like Cantillon, or Girardin...but this is an excellent brew. I would definitely pick one of these up again if given the opportunity."
"I'd heard a lot about this blend of old and new unfruited lambic and had to try it. It was rather tart but still refreshing. It has a slight haze and straw color. The head formed large and settled to a manageable one finger width in a couple of miuntes. It was highly carbonated with a grainy, acidic, somewhat mellow aroma. As the beer warmed the tart acidity laid down a little bit but was still the predominant character. The hops do not make much of an appearance with this beer. I'd drink it again. but would probably recommend a fruited lambic to all but the real adventuresome."
"dont get me wrong, i like havoc.. especially in wild beers. this is sure drinkable due to its light, champagney nature and lack of imposing tartness.. and it holds up as a nice, bubbly, crisp beer. but the flavor isn't where i would like it to be, especially from a master blender and lambic seller. ok, but for $6 a small bottle, somewhat of a letdown."
"Geuze Boon sits in the glass a hazy light brown. The aroma... hmm... your typical funkiness, and... cheese? The flavor profile is marked by a mustiness, along with ""horse"" and those other barnyard descriptors. I know Boon is one of the more notable producers of authentic Lambics, but even the beer snob in me can't force an endorsement of this. I will say that this nothing in this beer is offensive, and it's just interesting enough to be above average."
"taste has a similar balance. a touch of apple sweetness with the nice champagne-like feel and the tartness. high carbonation but with a refreshing feel. balanced and drinkable."
"Poured an orange blossom honey color with a solid finger of very fine and creamy head, like a merangue. The smell was of a pungent hay bale bordering on a bitter honey mustard dipping sauce. Tasted like tart and sour dry minerally green unripe apples. I think i'll have to review this one again as i get more into the style."
"Mind your eyes when you remove the crown, the cork exploded into the ceiling after a full night in the 'fridge. This pours a perfect golden hazy fizzy bliss like you expect from the style. I poured this into a goblet because I wanted it to warm faster and I love the smell of geuze as it opens. The head is big and rocky and sustains well. Geuze smells are almost more impressive as the flavors and Boon's offers some nice fruity nose with sadly minimal funk....think very fresh and toned down Tallegio cheese and apples. The mouthfeel is great if not a bit too carbonated, you could put a few of these away fast...very little sweetness, intense sour or pungent funk like you might expect. This one isn't essential in any way IMO other than it's inobtrusive drinkability. I don't want my geuze to wash down light....I want it to kick my ass and this one doesn't. It's good, balanced and pleasant but it's not outstanding. The only unique element is a tad more hop flavor which is generally minimal in these dry-hopped beers. The Oud Beersel, Girardin and Drei Founteinen offer a lot more flavor and complex addicting taste. I respect the traditional and non cloying flavors of Boon's Kriek but this geuze is just too simple. I will admit I drank this after the Girardin which is mind-numblingly godly. This is a good summer geuze I reckon but serve it warm and let it open or the flavor will sneak past you before you can count your $5. I guess this brewer is also responsible for the recent Oud Beersel products which are the Marianne to Boon's Ginger."
"Drinkability- I'm liking it! Pretty tasty and one of the more drinkable ones I've come accross. Recommended."
"Personally, I strongly prefer the flavored lambics like cassis, framboise, or peche. There's so little sweetness here that I'm struggling to complete the tasting."
"Produced a huge meringue-like 3-finger head which lasted quite a bit of time. Below was a cloudy deep orange tinged beer with streams of bubbles emanating from the bottom. Aromas of banana, clove, plums and sweet dark cherries were detected. Taste was sour, acidic and reminiscent of dry champagne. An aftertaste of dark chocolate was noted as well. A good mouthfeel, but a bit too tingly. I think I need to explore this style of beer a bit more before I make a solid judgement on this one."
"A really wonderful gueuze, dry as a bone and very drinkable"
"sampled @ Le Mondail 2005. Dark goldenrod with a small head of almost clear foam that fizzles and leaves only the slightest of residue on my glass. Aromas of barnhouse funk and classic tart bretty lambic funkiness with some slightly biscuity malts backing it all up. Taste is funky and skunky with a nice does of funk thrown in for good measure. Leathery as all get out with some significant cidery/apple flavors as well, almost juciy in the middle before the finish is bone crushingly dry and slightly quinine bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with super duper rushes of carbonation and drinkability is quite good. 4.0 on the lambic scale, closer to a 4.5 on the regular beer scale. Rated to style there are many better, but this is still a damn good gueuze!"
"Overall - An excellent gueuze. Very refreshing and very drinkable... probably not to everyones taste though..."
"Drinkability and Overall: You want a garbage geueze? Here it is. Looks great, smells even better, but tastes just about as fake as a spontaneously fermented beer can get. Blah.... As my girlfriend put it, ""Fuck this!"" I agree, baby."
"Pours a very nice, slightly darkened gold color. Huge head atop-get a spoon to go thru this one. Peppery and spicy aroma. Somewhat earthy and dirt like. Sour and very dry flavor. Sort of black pepper like. Hops? No way. Good body-a real pucker upper. A good beer but I dont see being able to consume a lot of this. Nice to try but just not my thing."
"This beer is more like a champagne than anything, but whatever. It is good. It pours a hazy yellow color and has a fat white head and violent carbonation. It has a very intense sour aroma and a wild yeasty aroma that are nothing short of spectacular. It's flavor is intensely sour and has a grape/champagne like body and flavor that gives way to an intense sour finish. This is a young lambic as it's expiration date is 12/20/2022, but it is already intense in it's flavor profile. If they get better than this I am in for a flavorful experience because I want to try them all."
"Pours with a fierce bubbly forming a huge 5"" head over an orangey gold color. Shares alot of the characteristics of a champagne, constant bubbly, great head retention (gobs and gobs of lace), a strong musky vinous aroma. Medium bodied, dry mouthfeel, and despite the very active carbonation, it is very gentle on the tongue. Mature taste to start, a bit of subdued cereal flavor.. some grapey elements, then a notably sour puckering finish. This is a good beer for when you just want A beer."
"this is one serious ride for a beer, crazy! I dont think more than one is recommended but accompanied with sharp cheese this would rule !"
"The head is a towering, crusty, white meringue that builds thick foamy walls on the inside of the glass. Waves of fine carbonation fill the hazy, orange-gold beer. Aroma is musty, cheesy, fruity and surprisingly sweet. Front! Is! Sour! Tongue-scorching when cold, mustier warm. Cheese and spice mark the fizzy middle, which is just a little fishy. Huge bitterness in the end. Tangy, sour grapefruit and apples. This is a good, sour, fruity, cheesy beer. Delicious."
"Picked up at Jungle Jim's in Cincy. Gueuze seems to be the style that I'm currently most interested in, although I admit that Cantillon has set the bar a little high for comparisons. Appearance starts off well enough a nice cloud-like head atop a burnt orange body. Aroma is obviously tart with hints of cider and a slight funkiness. Taste is more of the same. However, the funkiness hides in the finish along with a slight metallic twang. I'll revist boon in the near future, Hopefully with a slightly older bottle."
"Drinkability  This was a good offering from Boon although a bit unbalanced for my tastes."
"While drinking the quality is evident for one's liking."
"A slightly hazey dark orange colored ale with a big off white head and some lace. The aroma is sour fruit. Most predominate was a sour apple aroma. The taste is VERY sour and Very dry kind of oaky with a bitter apple peel after taste. I could not determine the Bottling year of my bottle. But I did note the the bottle claims 6.5% ABV."
"Champagne like carbonation, in this cloudy copper colored beer. A sour aroma followed by sweaty horse blanket, not as intense as the kriek I just had. The flavor is balanced, but definitely sour. There is some sweetness, and bitterness holding the sourness in check until the barnyard flavor sneaks in and is washed away by the very acidic finish, like a chewable vitamin C tablet. There is some body here, but the mouthfeel is more noticably bubbly, almost like alka seltzer. I surprisingly found this better than the kriek I just had."
"Cost $5.99, but it was well worth it. Highly Recommended!"
"12 oz. corked and caged bottle. Cork popped with some force behind it. Pours out a clear deep golden pils color with a big, fluffy light beige head. Acidic, woody, barnyardy smells and a slight bit of honey-sweet malts come through in the nose. Not quite as tart and acidic as I've experience in other gueuzes. This one's actually a little bit sweet, but it does have a nice vinous tartness and oakiness more towards the finish. Kind of fruity, like the skins of a Bosq pear. Not bad at all, especially if your looking for a gueuze that's not going to turn your tongue into the Sahara. But with a freshness dating of 2/11/2022, I'm sure the sweetness would be cut to nil by that time, and I'll be and old man."
"Brisk on the palete. Immediately acidic & very dry from start to finish. A pleasant undercurrent of apple througout. Interesting hints of oak & lemon. Eathy & herbal with a quick finish that invites another draught. Light bodied w/ lively carbonation. Stunning."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Tartness dominates both the aroma and flavor of this beer. A bit lemony in flavor with a champagne like flavor and body. There's just a hint of malt struggling to make itself noticed throughout the sip, but that hint does a lot to add to the beer's depth. Effervescent in the mouth with a very dry finish. Drinkable, indeed."
"Bottle: Poured a light yellow colored beer with a huge thick head that had super strong retention. Aroma was sour with some subtle sweet notes. Taste was sour to begin with and more sweet as it goes through my palate. Yeast was quite subtle and body quite light. Very good gueuze, maybe not as complex as the marriage parfait, and very refreshing overall. You can really go wrong with Boon products."
"Overall, Cantillion Gueuze is still my pick for an end-of-the-night nitecap and I might order the Boon again, but not if Cantillon is there."
"All things said, this is a killer lambic. I like it almost as well as Cantillon. All the complex elements of a lambic are there but take a backseat to the lactic sour character, which hits big the second you taste the beer, stays solid through the ""mid-palate"" and finally slowly evaporates in the aftertaste. There are lambics that are more sour and just a bit drier, but few ""come together"" like Boon Gueze into an all-around classic lambic."
"It feels cleansing in the mouth until the sourness really hits, which puckers the mouth a little. I finished the 355 ml bottle, but I wasn't ready to run out and get another. I will try this or other geuze brews again, though."
"This beer poured a light gold color and formed nice pillowy white head that left circular lace when it finally decided to die down. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. A heavy aroma cider and apples dominates. A slight flavor of malt, with an overiding character of apples, yeast/bread. The finish of course is quite sour and astrigent, but not as dry as a couple others I have had."
"This is definetly a very easy drinking and enjoyable lambic."
"This was my first sampling of the style, and if this is an acquired taste then I acquired it quickly. The sweet and sour parlay, with a nod to the sour, lends sensory stimulation to a unique flavor profile. The manageable alcohol level and lip-smacking tastiness combine to make the next one a nicely anticipated pleasure. This may not be the style I'd choose for my session beers, but it will indeed, one day soon, pass these lips again."
"I respect this beer a great deal. I respect the genre of geuze lambics in general. (The bottle spells it geuze). But the concept is quite alien to my tastes and I'm very hesitant in offering praise to something I'm not sure I fully understand. I was not overly enthusiastic about this unique specialty beer. But by the time I finished it, I could see how it might grow on you over time."
"Wow. My first experience with Gueuze. Very attractive looking beer. Nice head, nice color. The smell was fascinating. Definately reminded me of a barnyard, straw, dry mold etc. (is this horsiness??). Also get a bit of sour fruit and oak?? type smell, but dominated by the horse. Taste was very very dry. I bet the final gravity isn't above 1.005. Probably less. Very acidic and sour but with a pleasant sweet-like horsey/woody aftertaste that lingers under your tongue. Of course it is very very lightly sweet. Just barely perciptible. But after all the sourness it seems as if whatever sugar is in there is going to be noticeable. This beer is really complex and I like how the sourness makes the tiny bit of sweetness stand out...very subtle but delightful. A little to potent to have more than one unfortunately. Even this one is starting to give me a sour stomach...but I have a weak stomach so go figure."
"After removing the cage, a quick pull and the cork jumped right out. Poured a clear golden straw color with soda like carbonation. Smell was grapefruity, tart but not overly sour, which i was a bit surprised at. Initial taste was VERY light and effervescent. Throughout drinking, it always felt too light, kind of like eating a whole cup of the foamy top on a Macchiato. Taste was lightly sour, pleasant, but not as upfront as other guezes. An excellent, traditional gueuze that I wouldn't pass up, but if given the choice between Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, or Boon, this would have to be my last choice."
"This beer comes in a champange styles bottle and pours a large white head. A long lasting head. The taste is very sour and tastes of sour apples. It smells of sour apples too. This was the first geuze i have tried. I was sceptical at first, i thought it was to sour. But it is definitely a beer style i will try again."
"This rates as a pretty tart flavored lambic, though I've had others that make my cheeks pucker a little more. Flavor is reminiscent of a very sweet white wine. Finishes a bit dry, though reading the other reviews, it is much less dry than I expected. This is pretty decent, though nothing remotely mindblowing."
"Screw that bubbly wine stuff."
"Boon Gueuze pours with a very fizzy head. The color is golden amber with a slight haze. The bubbly head recedes about half way down rather quickly then stalls for a time. The head eventually deflates to a nice full, thin lace that lasts for the entire glass. The aroma is tart and rather vinous with maybe a touch of tart apple fruitiness. The flavor also is, at once, very tart. The tartness overwhelms on the first sip, and is almost sour. Although not quite as harsh on subsequent sips, the tartness is present from start to finish. There is a very slight sweetness in the start, but it doesnt stand out for very long. Beyond the start, the sweetness becomes a very slight underlying hint of apple fruitiness. An oaky/woody nature seems to sneak out somewhere around the middle along with some slight vinous notes. There is a good amount of carbonation that is much like champagne. The mouthfeel is light-medium and is fairly dry throughout. The finish has a bit of a citric lemony note. I had this gueuze all by itself with nothing to accompany it, so the tart/sour nature of it was a bit harsh at times. This seems like a beer that should not be drunk on its own, but paired with food, so its drinkablility is hampered a bit. Over all, okay, but hard to compare to others since the only other gueuze Ive had is Lindemans Gueuze which is quite sweet compared to Boon Gueuze."
"When poured, this beer had a large sized ivory head with fine-small sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was cloudy with carbonation observed and the hue was brown. The nose was fruity and sweet with a sweet flavor to it. The mouthfeel was smooth, thin, watery and light bodied. There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer."
"Medium gold color. Large head. Aroma is sour, apples, and a touch of barnyard. A medium bodied geuze. Tart and sour, balanced by some applish sweetness. Hints of wood. It very dry. The dryness sort of takes over every other aspect of this beer. All in all, it still a drinkable geuze. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is dry and tart. Aftertaste is bitter and tart."
"Lightly sour aroma with a bit of funkiness to it. Does not taste all that sour, one of the more mellow sour Geuzes. Does not have the fullness and balance of the better made ones (Hanssens for instance), though still quite good. The sourness reminds me of grapefruit, and there is a bit of fruitiness in the beer which accentuates this perception as well."
"Well, I’ve met my match. I’ll get it again, but I’ll have to pair it to the perfect food to get all that I can get out of it."
"This brew pours a large head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and an transparent ligh amber brown body. It had a strong citrousy fruity aroma. The flavor was strong and bubbly with notes of citrus. It has a very tart initial mouthfeel that left my mouth feeling bubbly. There was a slight bite in the finish."
"I sampled a 355ml caged cork bottle. Upon removing the cage, the cork burst sans coaxing, almost putting a hole in my ceiling. Regardless, this traditional gueuze pours a beautiful apricot color with a condensed bubbly head. Excellent retention. The smell is quite musty, funky, and one's tastebuds get more than a hint that some sour acidity is on its way. Never fail, the palate is bombarded with a mildly astringent, sour flavor with a good bit of acidity. Never cloying, however, and notes of Granny Smith apples are evident along with a mildly spicy finish. Very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very lively, spritzy and carbonted, not dissimilar to champagne. An easily drinkable beverage, for sure, but not necessarily as solid as Cantillon's wonderful offering. Even though, this is an excellent gueuze and is better suited for a seasoned palate. Not for the faint of heart."
"Head of white and orange body. Unsettling aroma of forgotten fruit left in a lunch bag for three days too long. Sour and earthy, like overripe french cheese. Zing-zap pow on the palate. I poured this for four of my friends, and we all poured it out. I cannot see the hops, unless that is was tastes like rotting leather (or what I imagine that might taste like). This is not as bad as I make it sound, but not much better. This is fabulously interesting, but anything but enjoyable."
"Suprisingly unbelievably good, this is truely a unique beer. Now trying it for the second time, the sheer shock value of the first time around is no longer there but now I am barely beginning to appreciate the complexity contained in this brewing masterpiece. While the appearance is somewhat shifty, reminding myself of a cloudy homebrew disaster the sheer drinkability is absolutely phenomonal."
"This one is a very nice deep orange color with a tiny, bubblly head. It has a very tradtional lambic aroma with lemons and toasted malt. It is silky on the tongue with tart flavors all around, malt in the middle and finishes dry and sour. It has a solid but light body that's very refreshing, with light woody notes. Highly recomended for the lambic explorer."
"Good foam for a geuze, high and compact. Colourbright, hazy golden. Pungent smell, with leather, and unripe citrus fruits. At the taste it is rough at the first sip, but then it becomes more encouragng and sweet, with sourness more evident in the aftertaste. Tobacco. Old hops. Persistent aftertaste."
"The beer pours a translucent deep golden amber color, the head mountainous, the texture spumescent, off white in color and as it desiccates the lace left behind a nice sealing sheet. Nose is tart, hints of pineapple, crisp and clean a nice treat for the senses. The brew starts with a lemon like tartness, top is slim in its feel to the palate, the finish ferine in its acidity with the tartness carrying all the way to the very dry aftertaste, I just never really know what to think of Gueuze lambics, but quite drinkable nonetheless."
"Enjoy!"
"Color: a hazy orange. Head: a tad off-white. Aroma: utterly unique, and not for the uninitiated. You have to be ready for this type of beer, for it's unlike anything else in the world. The wild yeast, the spontaneous fermentation. No wonder the lambic brewers are most successful when they introduce fruits to this incredibly demanding brew. Citrusy, sour, dry, medicinal, herbal, even a little vinegary. Texture is full, salty, body is medium, finish is quite lasting. Definitely takes some getting used to, but a solid, thirst quenching, even delectable beer."
"Drinkability: Very refreshing, like a cider. The 6.5% abv is masked very well."
"This poured with a towering off-white head, over hazy gold liquid with some amber hightlights. Nose is intense, with notes of yeast, sour apples. Taste is very unique, almost Champagne-like in it's mouthfeel and flavors, with dry fruitiness, tartness and a refreshing sour quality that makes it wonderful to quaff. Finishes bone dry and very quenching...a beautiful thing!"
"I am a gueuze virgin no more."
"Absolutely my favorite style."
"Opaque mustard brown color, early big champagne head that settles down quickly.  Sour aromas with some decided skunk-musk oil smells.  Characteristic sour notes with elements of raisins and cinnamon.  Not so astringent that you don't notice these secondary flavors.  Dries to a white wine-like finish at the back.  True enough to style, my rating hinges on the fact that its not as flamboyant in profile as Cantillon, nor as puckering."
"Cloudy golden coloring with a thick white head that hangs in there. Smell is very fruity; the nose definitely indicates the tartness of the brew. Taste is quite tart, with characteristics of a dry white wine. This is, I think, the second gueuze I've had, and I was impressed. Certainly something to have when you feel like having something different."
"A slightly sweeter gueuze. But still dry enough, refreshing tart qualties, obviously not as good as their Mariage Parfait Gueuze, but its pretty solid, this will appeal to a wider range of people."
"This was a really good gueuze, had it in Brussels at Beer Circus with a plate of cheese and bread."
"Sorry Brewguru but this is what the style is suppose to be. Highly carbonated and bracingly sour. The only bad thing you can say about it is that it doesn’t have quite the wild complexity of a Cantillion or a Hansons but still a knockout Gueuze."
