"Just an outstanding coolship beer."
"Hay, grass, wood, apples and grapes - not as acidic as the Cantillon Geuzes, lacks a little depth, but has a fantastic balance. Soft lively carbonation, adding to the refreshing character."

"Great aroma, but a little too tanic/acetic for me.  Very good but not great"
""
"This is a great take on a wild ale. Out of all the allagash wild ales this is near the top. Nice funk while not overly sour. I have one left and will be saving this for a while."

"This beer replicates the classic Belgian gueuzes extremely well and is one of the best attempts at the style on this side of the Atlantic."

"O: other than maybe a little more sour bite, or a twist in the end taste, I feel this beer probably can't do much better to increase my enjoyment."

"Flavor: Fruity and complex taste starts sweet and sour but turns tart and bitter by the finish. Quite tart mid-taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: What an excellent beer this is after aging it in my cellar for three years; hits on all the right notes"
""
""
""
"I have to remind myself to get a few bottles next time. I was somewhat strapped for cash when I got this bottle but this is at least on-par with the great Gueuze I have had. Tons of flavor and complexity with a great sourness."

"O - Unique flavors, but very welcoming and nice."

"not sure if this blend is technically a gueuze or not, but what does it matter? a genius blend of young and old blonde sour beers ages in oak, and the result could not be any more wonderful, not could this series of beers from allagash. murky but really pale blonde color, white hues to it, under a very white and light as a cloud inch of head. it smells incredible, that oaky sourness with a ton of lacto derived acidity that we usually associate with the sours of old world belgium. its that authentic, mix of farmy musty yeastiness and exuberant carbonation that tickles my nose. the flavor is everything you would expect from the style, but with a few special twists. the first is in the finish, which has an almost white grapey flavor to it that balances the acidity, that would otherwise be gargantuan. maybe more of a white cranberry, as it is still tart, but its not what i usually get in lambic types, yet is is extraordinary successful, where ever it comes from. the second little surprise here is the feel. its so well carbonated. sometimes the belgian examples come flat, but i love this level of effervescence in a lambic style, and both coolship series beers ive tried have had it so far. missing nothing, this blended sour is both elegant and extreme, and rivals beers like rueuze for the best made in its category in the united states. i cant remember better."

"Poured into a Coolship glass, surprising clarity, Champagne-like bubbles feeding a cap of foamy white head that started at about an inch and sank to a thin layer; minor dots of lacing on the glass. Got cloudy as some of the bottom-dwelling yeast made its way into the glass in the second half of the pour. Fruity aroma, citrus and stone fruits, light acid, grassy funk, candi sugar. In the taste, candied grapefruit, wet grass, earth, oak, mild moldy horseblanket, light acidic tartness, and some bready yeast. Maybe a little less tart and a little more sweet than your typical, authentic, Belgian gueuze, but it worked well nonetheless. Drinking very good for 3 years old. Light-medium body, easy drinkability, with a crisp mouthfeel. Nice overall."

"Overall: This beer is soooo seriously funky that I think this maybe the funkiest beer that I have drank yet to date. It reminds me alot of Cantillion Classic Gueuze. It might even be significantly funkier than the Cantillion Classic Gueuze. Phenominal mouthfeel on this gueuze! It seems that Allgash has some serious finesse with thier coolship! Gotta be a funk lover to appreciate this brew! I am a huge fan of the gueuze. This was no exception."

"Thanks to my friend Sean for the gift of this brewery-only release!"

"O/D-A delectable treat. Holds up to most any Gueuze I have had from its birthplace. Lucky to have tried a rather elusive brew."

"Poured a hazy yellow into the glass with some light white head swirling around the top of the beer. Tart nose with some lemony esters. This beer tasted like Cantillon Gueuze with pure lemon juice added. Tart like no other beer I've ever experienced. Even some of the veteran sour drinkers at my tasting were puckered by this one. This was not a hit for me. I couldn't imagine drinking a bottle. It's a well made beer, but it was just too one note for me. If you're still learning and exploring sours, do not attempt to tame this beast."
"Pours a slightly hazy light yellow color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates to swirls of foam on top. Aromas of lemony tartness and barnyard funk. The flavor is quite tart with huge tooth enamel dissolving properties. Lemons and earthy funk make up most of the flavor here. The finish is fairly dry but leaves a lingering tartness on the palette. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. Tart lightly funky brew thats light and refreshing like lemonade on a hot day. I enjoyed it, I'm glad I got to try it."
"O- This is a great coolship style beer and easily one of the best sours coming out of the US however I don't think it quite compares to some of the best Belgian gueuzes and lambics. Definitely worth trying if you like funky beers and I'm very glad I have relatively easy access to this beer as its only available at the brewery in Portland, Maine."

"Notes from mid. 2012. Got a full De Ranke tasting glass of this one, during the finish of the first day of the Italian Beer Festival // 37.5 ml bottle bottled on 25/5/2011 // making it slightly over 1 yr old // pours a hazy golden with a sizable head for the style that has some nice lacing going on // aroma is instantly gauze, I didn’t know what to expect from a real American geuze, honestly & peraps nationalistically, I expected it to be ok but weaker than the best Belgian counterparts because I believed that the factory had to become saturated y the critters over a long period of time, man was I wrong, smell is delicious, strongly tart, I am getting lots of horse blanket here, brett, touch lambic yeast & hint of pungent citrus // strong farmhouse, barnyard, tartness going on here in the beginning, touch wood, citrus, strongly tart lemon peel, touch heavier in the finish coming into play, hint of wood, quite horse blanket heavy I a lovely way, going into definitely more acidic territory in the back than Belgian counterparts, the initial flavours get complimenting, resulting in a nice complexity with strong acidity & a dash of what is getting already quite close to vinegar, maybe dash of apple vinegar, not so much the fruit but a mellowness that encompasses the vinegar, just as with apple vinegar compared to regular one, heavily acidic, brief moment in the end of bitterness, quite interesting, makes me think a bit of a small instance of bitter herbal / farmhouse hops // touch dry & lightly fizzy, touch 3F style in that department, easy going, makes you want to drink more // outstanding, lots of interesting flavours & component, some touch newer to me, on part with the stuff that we make here which may not be that special anymore if the states are filled with this kind of stuff."

"I wish the Allagash Coolship series was a little more attainable - props to them for bringing open-air spontaneous fermentation to the US. Not sure if this is a textbook gueuze but it does at least maintain the spirit of blending old and new. VERY oak-forward, deep layers of tart funk - cheese, must and tons of very active bugs."
""
""
""
"A great American geuze. It certainly rivals the Belgian geuzes in terms of the complexity of the nose and flavour as well as the excellent carbonation and mouthfeel. Allagash sours are probably the closest you can get to the Belgian styles of sours in America, and this beer reflects that fact."
""
"Very good gueuze, especially for an American-made. Good funk and reasonable level of sour acidity was appreciated."

"Well done allagash, keep them coming. It's great how the white pays for such great beers as this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this was delicious!!!Extremely cheesy, as if it has been aged for 10 yrs. ...Incredible balance between sour and funk. Probably the best American Geuze i have ever had... Very similar to belgian geuze..."
""
"O: This is really nice. Certainly my favorite American spontaneous blend so far, much far ahead of Beatification and Sour Reserve."
""
""
"Overall- wish I didn't drive 6 hours south or had somebody else to buy another 4 bottles as that's what the limit was. Would feel like a 19 year old again asking other people to buy me beer!!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a really great American sour. Definitely comparable to many of the Belgian gueuze available. The balance of funk and sour is really impressive. I've had a couple different batches of this beer now and none fail to impress."

"Overall: Complex and beautiful. I can't help but wonder how this will age. There is a strong head flowing after the pour and this is highly effervesant with beautiful acidity and vibrant fruit and earth-driven flavors. Outstanding!!!! Almost Classic."

"Served in an Allagash tumbler. Nose is pretty cheesy and funky. Light acidity. Mild skunk. Quite authentic. Super dry. One of the best American sours. Bit too skunky. This was extremely promising, and I really am looking forward to seeing what Allagash can do with this beer going into the future. I have very high hopes for what batches 10 and beyond could be..."
""
""
"Beer is light and dry quite funky, mildly sour, mostly funky though. It is interesting though, a nice beer for sure. I'd have it again. Simple but good."
""
""
"375ml bottle: This one pours a hazy, dark golden color. There was a small, fizzy head that didn’t linger long. No lacing either. Interesting nose. Definitely funky! Seems to be sour apple and lemon are the main components. Maybe some wheat, but it’s hard to tell. The taste is definitely a bit sour. Wheat, lemon and apple notes. Not much carbonation at all. There is a smoothness to go along with the tartness. Very Good!"
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this, but I've enjoyed others more. It is a must try, but it probably won't blow you away."
"The beer appears light golden colored with a thin, wispy head that leaves faint traces of lacing on the glass. The aroma brings some nice funk, along with earth, grass, hay, straw, outdoors, mineral water. Smells very enticing - nicely done. The flavor is clean and refreshing, with a subtle and elegant lactic presence followed by a mildly acetic finish. Not on par with the elite gueuzes from Belgium, but a very nice beer, and undoubtedly one of the better attempts from an American brewery. Light bodied and easy drinking. Overall, this was solid and enjoyable. I would have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall - As good as any American sour I've had. Not as good as the best Belgian counterparts, but fantastic for an American brewery to produce something so authentic tasting."
"Enjoyable beer, but fails to live up the standards of the Belgian lambic makers. I enjoy sourness, but this one was a touch over the top."
""
""
""
""
"(FWIW, if this were classified as an ""American Wild Ale"" I'd probably rate it a half-point higher. However, as a Gueuze, I think it misses the style a bit.)"
""
""
""
""

""

"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is super dank with notes of foot (in a sandle), a slight citrusy/lemony bitterness and funk. The taste is a sweet upfront with a great tangerine, grapefruit rind bitterness and tartness that follows. The beer is relatively sweet, medium bodied, but drinkable with a tart, dry finish that lingers. The beer was nearly repulsive with a sample size @ BCTC, but utterly phenomenal with a healthy sample size...get some."
"o - great sour, puckers my mouth...definitely prefer the 7/27 over the 5/25 (4.5)"
"(185th)"

"Tart, citrusy, pretty acidic but not overly sour. Funky farmhouse yeast, mild bitterness, citrus. Closer to the Belgian gueuze style than most American blenders get. Totally respectable, quite tasty; this is one of the few American sours I think the Belgian blendmasters would actually appreciate."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy gold color with a white head. Really just a decent aroma. A surprising cork note along with moderate funk qualities (mostly feet and grass). A decent bit of oak and actually a bit of sweet wheat smell. The flavor has a more pronounced funk to it. Lots of must, sweat, and grass. Prominent oak flavors with only a light tartness and lemon peel."
""
""
"O: This was very enjoyable but it doesn’t hold a candle to its Belgian counterparts. Thanks again, Michael!"
""
""
""
""
""
"D - This was definitely the Coolship that was most authentic and lambic-like. It compared quite favorably to Cantillon Classic Gueuze, which, unfortunately, isn't my favorite gueuze to begin with). Still, an impressive achievement in historical authenticity and blending skill. I suspect subsequent releases will improve rapidly as Allagash has more barrels from which to select."
"Really impressive overall. It doesn't touch some of the better gueuze blends from Belgium, and it's not on the same level as Beatification at this point, but it's better than almost any American attempt at the style."
"This is very delicious. Tastes authentic enough to me."
"O - So overall this beer, both bottlings of it, are just delicious. Whether with subtle grapefruit or lime, each sip is a spectacular harmonic dance of oak, funk, and almost mouth puckering sour/tartness. So incredibly worth the money."
""
"O - One of my favorite Coolships, right up there with the Red. I would definitely go after another one of these to see how it ages. Really cool how it stood up against the Cantillon counterpart. Good stuff."
"O: This beer is up there with some of the best geuzes I've had. Well done Allagash."
""
""
""
""
"Taste has a nice sour tartness that tickles the sides of the tongue, a funk starts to work its way in the flavor profile before the sourness regains its foothold in my mouth, moderately soft carbonation, slightly earthy undertones."
"A leafy/green funk flavor. Definitely dirty/earthy. Lemon acidity and apple tartness. Wonderful american representation of a traditional beer. It isn't quite the same. This bottled release was earthier than what I've had before."
""
"M: Light and tight all the way. Extremely drinkable and leaves a wet-dry finish that balances so well with the tart aftertaste."
"O - This might be the most impressive coolship yet. Allagash is really on to something and beer lovers are reaping the rewards."
""
"Overall amazing, tasty, nice sour and tart flavors, nice funk and bready malts."
""
"TASTE: Tart, acidic, lemon juice, herbal, phenols, dry, earthy, musty grain, vegetal, wood, tangy rhubarb"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a pretty good American gueuze and really glad I got to try it. Very funky which I enjoyed; would love to have it again."
"As I wrote these notes and reading over them now, I am struck by how this beer, while being a geuze, differs in a number of ways from Belgian geuzes. Its difficult to rate it to style, since it is an American geuze, and there isn't much history for this style in this country (hence my ratings are much lower than BrewedAwakening's, even though we both enjoyed the beer to a similar degree and shared the same bottle). I do hope that Allagash keeps up with this product line and makes it more easily available, for this is a fine beer and deserves to be tried by beer lovers far and wide."
"D: this is an excellent gateway beer for those who want to experience a sour, but don't want the highly acidic qualities. overall, I feel this was an extremely impressive representation of Allagash's interpretation of this style with use of the natural airborn wild yeasts found in the Great State of Maine."
