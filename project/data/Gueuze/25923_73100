4.42,2.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25," The flavor is pretty intense with a dry tart tangy and puckering sour yet refined flavor with wood and lemony lactic element yet malt is slightly balancing as it evolves with a mild sweet/fruity combination of wild yeast in the flavor. The taste has a subtle earthy funk in the background adding to the complexity of flavor with a mineral dryess perhaps from the high carbonation as it finishes tart. The flavor is great and so is the drinkability- I never had the bottle, but now that I have had the draft version I would like to try it. This is a wondeful Gueuze with subtle and drinkable qualities in every way.","Slatetank","Jul 29, 2014"

The nose is very floral, charred wood and lemon are imminently present. The taste is surprising, not as tart as I'd hoped and very dry, lot's of wood there. Interesting how much pepper is present. Very nice beer that fell short of my expectations. But I'll definitely give it another shot down the road.","Mantooth","Apr 19, 2014"

The nose is nice, huge ridy chessy funk, light mineral note, sweet peach and some lemon with a touch of citrusy hop. The taste is less bright, notes of mineral and some lighter rindy funk. Light spice to it with a fair bit of sweetness in the back, light lemon and very subtle sourness. The body is light and airy, a bit active on the back of the tongue, not very dry and strong carbonation. Well rounded and tasty, a touch flabby, not as expresssive as 3F but decen funk.

A somewhat sour, funky aroma, I pick up pears, grape skin and touch of citric (hop bitterness?) in aroma and very little malt base. Light bodied with a good sour funkiness, this beer isn't overpowering with its sour peak but instead mixes sourness with tart fruit and a little bit of oakiness and finishes with some sweetness (relatively speaking). Casual sipper that I really enjoyed w/ light dinner..","clayrock81","Jan 22, 2012"

Moderate carbonation, wheat like twang leads to a puckering finish. Lemon is the main note in this tart citrus taste. Touches of bread and honey mid palate but sour start to finish with the finish being very dry and puckering. This is a great gueuze, not metallic notes that some give off.

Poured a hazy yellow orange with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon, orange peel, funk, slight tart, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, funk, citrus, and lemon. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I have been lucky enough to try this both on draught and out of the bottle. I know they are listed separately here on BA which was confusing to me at first. However, after trying this it is quite clear why. Both taste completely different to me and seem to be completely different brews. I enjoy the bottle version better for the record by the way. Worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Dec 04, 2011"

The initial taste is lemon, going into a bit of funky oak, some light grapefruit, and some hay. A brett funkiness on the finish with a light tartness. Light mouthfeel with low carbonation. You can definitely tell this is younger lambic than most gueuzes. I'll be curious to try Tilquin gueuzes made from 3 year lambic.

The palate is similarly bright and refreshing, with a clean, lemony sourness, a mild funk and a little bit of oak. Medium-light in body, this beer has a great, refreshing finish, zippy and lemony and thoroughly enjoyable. The funk isn't as fully developed here, but I guess that was the point of this blend.
