"Notes from 2011: 375 ml. Bottle@Waagstuk: tastes really sweet, so sweet even that labelling this a faro would be a much better indication of how it tastes especially since this seems to have nothing in the way of a gueuze, taste is that of candy sugar (lots & lots of it) with juice & chlorine, which is not something that I wish to taste."

"Pour is a pale yellow with a thin white bubbly head. The nose has a faint note of dust and some light apple juice, maybe some golden fruit. Taste is the same, almost no funk, apple juice, golden grapes, a bit syrupy and fairly sour. Medium to full body, syrupy and coating, a bit viscous with a dry finish."

"D: This beer brings shame to the name of Gueuze. Stay away from this."
"While I could drink this if someone made me, it is definitely the worst travesty I have ever experienced from a bottle labeled Gueuze; though I must admit that I have a bottle of Chapeau Christmas Gueuze (with added flavor, what ever that means) still coming up. These fake De Troch Lambics are made that much more interesting by the fact that they can make a good, traditional Lambic when they put there mind to it; I really hope they make more of the traditional products as I have been able to try some very good examples from this brewery."
"Pours cloudy copper, almost still. By design, or is my bottle too young in the bottle? Carbonation issues aside, the beer is nice. Nose is a blend of pineapple and elderflower with some citrus and mild funkiness. Flavor is orange, apple, strawberry, with a pucker-inducing sour finish. Certainly one of the most sour and fruitiest gueuzes I've had. If you had blindfolded me I would have guessed a framboise or kriek lambic."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty beige/orangey color lambic with a small bubbly head with no retention and no lacing. Aroma of funk is more dominant then expected with some light lingering sweet notes. Taste is also more funky and tart then expected though sweet notes are not too interesting. Body is full with limited filtration and low carbonation. More interesting then I would have expected though lacking some green apples notes and some acidity."
"This is only my second attempt at a Gueuze Lambic. Not bad, although miles behind the first. Definitely drinkable, but there was a distinct funkiness, that make it taste more like a Faro. Something old or rotten underneath the obvious tartness and sweetness, but not overpowering. Definitely drinkable, although if another lambic was available, I'd probably choose it."
"Notes: Don't buy beer from Embassy in Roseville unless you want this experience. Holy shit. This is the fifth and last time I'm gonna try and support their business when they clearly don't care about their stock/customers."
"Overall Impression: It grew on me. Not the Lambic to end all Lambics, but not a bad beer."
"Well, not much good to say about this brew. A listless, dull and altogether boring example of the style. Avoid."
"Pours a semi hazy golden color but where the hell is the head. Almost no carbonation. Not many bubbles in this beer either. Aroma is of splenda and white grape juice. Not my cup of tea. Taste is light, almost watery with no dominating characteristics except for the saccarin-like flavor I'm getting and a little apple in there. Tartness and vinegar come out a bit as it warms but I'm really searching here and can't find much. Finish goes away quickly and I forget about this beer seconds after the swallow. This reminds me of apple juice. Might be good for someone who has never tried a lambic and wouldn't be ready for the sour/tart/acidic qualities most lambics offer. Otherwise, not recommended."
"Taste: Big effervescence, somewhat tart, but really watery, and no particular flavour at all. It was like lemon metamucil with alka-seltzer. I've actually tasted a lambic worse than this, but I've tasted so many better that I would pass on this one without a second thought. The worst Beer I had during my whole trip to Belgium. Even Jupiler is better than this."
"Sweetish, soft sourness, soft tartness, very smooth and light, no sharp bite, it just fades away. Bit of and oak barrell character, strange and interesting, worth a go, but won't have again."
