Soft carbonation, it's barely there and ebbs over time, but it's not completely flat. The 3-year-old lambic really adds some complexity and authenticity here, it's vaguely reminiscent of Cantillon Classic Gueuze with less body, funk, and bubbles.","emerge077","Nov 11, 2013"

I'm over the carbonation issue aroma is cider like tart yogurt like zing with mellow citrus earthy funk laden wild yeast notes. Tart white grapes citrus peel like zing with long lasting waves of sour lactic notes however its really enjoyable and easy to drink that's if you enjoy sours. I'm shocked how this Cincinnati based brewer is churning out sours, this is dated 2011 I also have a lambic dated 2012. Such a nice change of pace their regular offerings are mediocre but this shows promise, although I may be chasing this with a Pepcid. Medium bodied almost absent carbonation finishes bone dry like some white wines or ciders. I have nothing but good things to say about this gueze pretty damn authentic flavor someone has been inspired by Belgian brewing traditions!","WVbeergeek","Aug 05, 2013"

3.68,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"750ml bottle that I received from one of you fine people sometime last year. Bright yellow color. Aroma was nicer than the Rivertown lambic, no cider just lemons and hints of sourness. Flavor was good and wild and occasionally made me pucker. Fruity but still not quite an authentic gueuze. Much like the Lambic from Rivertown this is a fine wild ale but not quite a match for authentic lambic. I hope they keep at it though and I respect them for going down that road.","ArrogantB","May 30, 2013"
3.19,-15.8,2.5,3.5,3.5,2,3,"Seems like Rivertown is hit or miss on the sours. Ojos Negros, Sour Cherry Porter, and Lambic are all excellent. This gueuze is not. It isn't at the level of Pestilence, but it was disappointing. My biggest complaint with this beer was that it had absolutely NO carbonation. It was as flat a beer as I have ever seen come out of a bottle (excluding some of my early day homebrew). As far as I am aware, a gueuze is supposed to have extremely high carbonation, almost champagne-like. The aroma and flavor were right on par with many beers in the same style. Very sour with notes of lemon and sour grapes as well as some must. Dry and tart. It was just very dull and bland. The lack of carbonation really hurts this beer. I would pick it up if I saw it from a new batch just to see how it is with carbonation.","Bonis","May 14, 2013"

This is also a terrible gueuze. It lacks complexity, carbonation, and clarity. A gueuze is the champagne of beer and on most accounts this beer lacks all the qualities one associates with a gueuze. If this beer was branded as an Ohio sour, I would have given it a 3 star rating, but since they are attaching the name gueuze to the beer, it leads to a let down of expectations.","OrgasmicChemist","Dec 23, 2012"

It's nice and tart, it's not a strong tartness although it does get better as the beer warms up some. There's also a lingering tart finish.
