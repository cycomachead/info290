"Pour is amber orange with a small amount of tight white head.  Nose has a light brett, assertive notes of pear, grape, slight dusty musk, fairly bright tangerine.  Taste is similar, lots of grape, faint brett presence, somewhat bright tangerine note.  A little simple.  Body  is a touch syrupy, light to medium, soft carb."
"Okay but not getting a lot of oak out of it."

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours deep golden with a bit of orange and a small fizzy head on top. Aroma of big time sour funk, acid, oak, some sweet fruits like peaches and apples. Mmmm. Taste is bold and has plenty of malt sweetness, light fruits add depth, and there is plenty of sour funk to go around. Nice dry oaky tannins. Body is on the heavier side for the style, with plenty of lively, prickly carbonation, and a dry finish. This is really nice, and maybe it would be best side by side with the regular version. Overall I think I liked the regular version a bit better. Perhaps a little more age would funk this up, dry it out, and lighten things up a bit. But nevertheless, this is yummy."
"Yellow and clear, odor very similar to the products which we have Tilquin cheese, pickled cucumbers, cabbage (no kidding), with the exception that all kind of more intense. Taste is also intense for at Oude (Gueuze Tilquin) Â² is more expressive. Beer moderately saturated, but one gets the impression that you are drinking sparkling wine"

"Just outstanding. I can't say to have any expertise on the actual aging potential of gueuzes, but this seems primed to have a lengthy and excellent lifespan. Aroma is outstanding, full of sweaty horseblanket and stone fruit notes with a touch of vanilla. It's got a deep mustiness already. On the palate this is revealed to largely be a product of the big oak flavors, revealing a slightly sweet and deeply tannic profile. As the brett works over time and dries this out I have hopes of true magnificence. But if it never does anything but get progressively older, I'll still enjoy this, a fair bit more than the regular."

"A decent head that falls moderately quickly. Hints of a pastel yellow in the lace. Body is slightly cloudy and a gorgeous pale orange color. Aroma is strong and filled with tart lemon and a little sweetness to it. Not any funkiness but maybe a little dry dust and a slight burn. Taste is not what I remember from the last bottle I had. A weird sour bitterness that I pick up on the back of my tongue. More lemon and a little orange peel. Some green apple, tons of oak, and the alcohol is there in the background. Mouth is a little light bodied but carb is good. Overall, I enjoy it but miss the funkiness of other Gueuze. This is more citrus rind than musty goodness."

"The palate opens with a big, juicy sourness, earthy, lemony, grapefruity and with faint melon characteristics. The mid palate brings out the barrel character with deep, woody tannins, mildly woodsy, mild vanillin and a mild pear preserve note. Layered and structured, the finish brings out some salty and mushroomy flavors before the tannins take over, leaving a long, drying finish, sour with preserved lemons, grapefruit, a mild vinegar character. The strong oak tannins on the finish remind me of some unblended lambics (Broucsella and maybe the Boon Mariage Parfait?). Alcohol is reasonably well hidden, this beer is light in body, moderately carbonated and and fantastic on the palate. Excellent. I'm not sure this should be cellared, drink it fresh if you have it on hand."

"Better than Cantillon. Give it a blind tasting with virtually any from their line and prepare to be surprised. Could easily age for another decade. If it is anything like Drie Fonteinen Vintage, what a drink it will be then."
""
"Final score: 4.49"
""
"Verdict: A very nice beer, though I did find myself noticing the alcohol, sometimes on the palate, other times at the finish, which I didn't enjoy so much. It's not as bright or as delicate as it's mathematical root beer, but it's still an extremely well blended gueuze."

"With the soft underpinnings of wheat, a delicate bread character bounces against the highly piquant textures, alcohols and wood spice to give the ale a tepid sense of balance. Still, its peppery and vinous character crispens the taste and dries the palate with utter ease. Its a wild taste and meant for the most serious of connoisseur. Its simply a drinker's beer."

"Overall: Really good stuff. The extended aging definitely adds lots of additional funk and oak character. Worth picking up if you find it."

"cool story on this one, thanks to my brother for scoring this one! i liked it even better than the base gueuze, which obviously is one of the pace cars for the style. this one has a lot more wood on it, a lot more bubbles, and is frankly way more sour and acidic, without sacrificing any of its funk. maybe the extended time with high carbonation has added that usually unwelcome carbonic acid to the mix, its not an off flavor or feel here, it cuts the coarse wheat malt and ancient oak, very cool on the palate with the lacto sourness to and a citrus quality i dont remember in the base beer. the abv is higher, but i still dont taste it. what i taste is a maturity, despite its lively carbonation, its decadent, one to let warm up and open, and highly tannic like an acidic white wine. the oak flavor is raw to me, unsweetened, not charred, not vanilla, just wood. a very developed yeast profile is what i get in the finish, and its not like other belgian blended sours, its sharp and old at the same time, like a guy turning 100 years old who wields a cane not as a crutch but as a weapon, and who is as mentally sharp as he ever was. this has that spry longevity to it, and i super dig it. i hope it comes back around!!!"

"Bitter pink grapefruit, firmly sour, dry tannic oak in the aftertaste. A touch more intense than the Oude Gueuze, a bit oakier for sure. Smooth and crisp, the firm tannic bitterness lingers. Overall it's very similar but slightly different than the Oude Gueuze, definitely worth a try."

"4.06/5: Not the most sour, but who cares? The brett notes are fantastic!"

"Glowing golden yellow capped with a slender, creamy ring.  Complex, funky aromas of flowers, general barnyard, cheese, apple, lemon, and dried apricot. Flavor keeps the funk up with flowers, earth, and mustiness.  Fruity Sweet Tarts, acetic wood, and lemon.  Perfectly dry and tart, attacking the gumline and making it hard to pace myself.  For a strong Gueuze, this stays insanely light and drinkable.  Very happy I found a bottle of this."

"Another excellent one Tilquin. I may prefer the original, but this is still great!"
""
"Overall just a great gueuze."

"This might be one of the best base gueuzes that I've ever come across. Get it while you can before others catch on!"

"Immensely drinkable. Amazing gueuze."

"pours a hazy orange with a slight head if poured correctly. smell of acidic goodness that is quite reminiscent of regular tilquin. taste is very similar as well but dare i say a tad better. body is fuller and the flavors are more pronounced. big acidity but thats what you get from the OG version too. booziness not detectable. IMO a slight improvement to an already terrific gueuze. this in my eyes is one of the best gueuzes you can buy in the USA and one you should snag off the shelves before it becomes too popular. great job!"
