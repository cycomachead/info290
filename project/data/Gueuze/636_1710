4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled in 10/2013. Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge sour lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, white vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, white vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, lime, green apple, white grape, vinegar, hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, pepper, musty funk, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding gueuze style! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and pale malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 22, 2014"

3.75,-11.8,,,,,,"Poured a cloudy orange with a half finger frothy white head that quickly receded. It looks like most other Geuzes I've sampled, pretty nice. Scents of lemon juice, abundant sour yeast funk, bright acidity, straw hay, oak, sour green apple, white grape, low levels of grapefruit and indeterminate citrus, and a low level of what seems to be alcohol. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic Geuze aroma profile, with many of the regular aromas on display. A bit funkier and sour-dominated compared to other examples, which hurts the balance with the oak and fruit a bit. Dry in aroma overall, since malt and honey aromas are absent and fruit tends towards a sour variety. Still nice and appealing. Flavor begins highly sour with a funky, wild yeast character, straw, a bit of tangy wheat, a light bitterness from the hops, and a bit of lemon juice. Middle continues to be sour and acidic with lemon juice, oak, and sour yeasty funk being the principle flavors. A mild hop bitterness is also present. Finish is still sour and acidic and dry, with a very strong presence of sour, barnyard yeast funk, straw, a moderate level of oak, a mild lemon juice character and light hop bitterness. Aftertaste is tangy yeast, lemon juice, very light honey and wild, funky yeast. Overall impression of taste is of a highly sour Geuze that is very heavy towards the funky, yeasty, lemon and oak flavors. Other fruits are absent, as is honey, which hurts the overall flavor profile. It is a decent Geuze, but lacks the balance and depth of better examples. Hop bitterness is also a bit more discernible than in other examples, though hop flavor is absent, keeping to style. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, with light carbonation and a drying, acidic feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is fairly true to style for a Geuze, though the carbonation is far to low, perhaps due to an older bottle. Overall this is a decent Geuze that is fairly refreshing and nicely sour in aroma and flavor. Perhaps a bit too sour however, a sourness overwhelms the flavor. The aroma fairs better, but could still use a bit more balance. Mouthfeel is good overall though and this isn't a bad Geuze, there are just far better examples.","Auraan","Oct 12, 2014"

What sets this apart from others in the style is a unique bretty ""savory"" note that appears in the aroma and taste.  Not bad, but unique.  Also sweeter and not as refreshing.  Still, I'll be buying this to try again, though it's not my number one choice.","CowsandBeer","Sep 30, 2014"

There is a funky base of earth, grass and oak but not as much as the smell would suggest. There is also a slightly metallic aftertaste. Very sour - the Hanssens seems to contain a higher amount of acetic acid than Cantillon or 3F Gueuze. It has a very vinegary taste and sensation I can feel in the back of my throat. I felt the same way about the Hanssens Oude Kriek; however, the gueuze is more drinkable than the kriek. There is a cloying sweetness, which in combination with the vinegar and the moderate, prickly carbonation made for a beer that is less drinkable than I was hoping. I love gueuze and this is not a bad beer for your gueuze fix. However, both 3F and Cantillon are much better.","brianmandell","Mar 29, 2014"

A voluptuous head of white foam that settled to a thin cap and collar and champagne effervescence. It’s heaven to look at. The nose is strong and delicious with yeast, brett funk, barnyard and hay, musty wood a bit of vinegar and sweet hint of white grape and citrus. Taste is mouth watering, juicy and sour. Lemon, plenty of earthy funk, sour with some pear and green apple. Malt is light grain. It’s simplicity on the palate and each sip has you asking for more. Nice dry finish and a little oak and vanilla in the aftertaste. This was a wild and refreshing gueuze.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

As it stands, this is the Belgian style in which I’ve seen the most variation: with tastes from heavy to crisp, bitter to sweet, and fruity to herbal, there seems to be an array of possibilities here.

3.99,-6.1,3.75,4,4,4,4,"a nice gueuze, but certainly not the best one out there, and I think this is probably a little overrated here on BA. it pours a faded orange color, well cloudy, and not holding onto much of its bubbly white head. the nose is sour and vinegar forward, with some straw-like malt and a spunky yeast character. the acidic sour element is the strongest part of the flavor, as it should be in a good gueuze, but I also pick up some light fruit here, tart berries or something, which gives the beer a little sweetness and a little weight beyond its middle of the road malt bill. the finish is very acidic, now more vinegar than conventional sour, which clashes with the sweetness. not as effervescently carbonated as I like for the style, but satisfying enough. also a little thicker than some, but that doesn't bother me with all the complexity here. overall this is a very well made version of the style, but it lacks some of the memorable features of the best ones, it also drags slightly in feel, which is supposed to be so bright here. probably not worth the money they charge for this, but a must have obviously for any gueuze-heads.","StonedTrippin","May 22, 2013"

The nose is a tad skunky at first, but mellows out and becomes a slightly sweet, funky, tartly gueuzey. The taste is quite potent with great grain, yeast, bacteria, and a touch of sweetness. Is definitely a gueuze that packs it in flavor and exceeds expectations. The mouthfeel is sweet and sour upfront with a lingering dryness that's slowly washed away by my quickly responding saliva (I wouldn't want tooth decay with all this acidity).

There is a small amount of sediment that is floating around in the glass after the pour. Small chunks of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is extremely tart, sour, and funky with lots of wild, earthy, and woody aromas. Taste is much like the smell with some fruity flavors that I can't quite put my finger on. There is definitely a lemon-like presence I am picking up. There is a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is the best Hanssens beer I have had so far and also the first one to have noticeable carbonation.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 28, 2012"

Not to downplay it, I really like it. Solid wild microbe character. Oakiness blends in nicely. Light bitterness is suiting. Tart, thin body from thorough fermentation. Lingering acidity.

The flavors are just so complex and mouth puckering and the smell is really like no other type of beer. As far as price goes, it more expensive than something like a Lindemans Cuvee Renee but the quality is just so much much better and I'd much rather spend the extra $6-7 for this.

A little too intense, with a bit more acetic char than i'd like, and more acetic character than most gueuzes should (and do) have. Decent. Medium light in body mildly carbonated with a vinegary, oaky finish, this was a rare treat, albeit not the experience I was hoping for.","DefenCorps","Jun 24, 2011"

4.22,-0.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clean and clear, near headless golden oranage, one of the darker tints ive seen from the style. Scent is musty baryard, damp wood and muddy earth forward, sour notes and a suprisingly bold fresh grain/malt presence. Taste is earthy, without being overly funky, muddy earth and damp wood present in quantity, lightly sour and puckering at serving temperature (cask remember) and stronger as it approached full room temp - really becomes a puckering being later on. The grain profile is heavier then many in the style. Limited cask carbonation here, beer comes across as medium and the sourness lingers on the palate. A nice find in cask, maybe not my prefered method to serve the style, but a good beer.","rfgetz","Jun 06, 2011"

Very tart and sour in the nose. Taste is not very sour or tart and that is a bit disappointing, but the flavor is great. Funky with bits of horseblanket (no, I do not use this term legitimately).

I could smell it the second i popped the cork. When nose i held up to glass, I get a TON of lemon and zesty aromas with some heavy oak and faint hoppiness. This is a great smelling beer. Taste is just as great. At first I get tart lemon flavors that are quickly followed by hops and oak. Some lovely oak and peach flavors in this beer. Nice funky aftertaste. Damn tasty beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and dry. Not the most dry gueuze I've head, but nicely dry and crisp. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an awesome beer.

4,-5.9,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer was my official public introduction to old gueuze in Belgium, much to the surprise of my local owner/bartender. It looked fantastic, poured out of an old bottle with mold on the label, I knew it was going to be an experience. The smell was citris and age, and once I poured it into my mouth the first thing I said when I slammed down the glass on the split wood bar was, ""holy sh*t!"" which I can imagine even the Belgians know since all their television shows have English subtitles. The sourness hits you like a truck, and it's all uphill from there. Nice citrus and a cloying (not even sure I know what that term means) feeling that is unique. Not my particular cup of tea, but a great experience I'll remember forever. Try it!","Wegomlegging","May 13, 2011"

It smells of fermented peaches, has some funk but what I would describe as a lot, and also features a mild tartness, and light alcohol. The flavors are much better than in my first gueuze experience. You actually get some fruit. It instantly bites your tongue with peach skin like tartness. It's almost the perfect amount of sour. It has light funk and wasn't heavy on sediment whatsoever. Perhaps the biggest difference is the mouthfeel. It has a nice crisp bite to it. I really like it. I'm glad I tried this so it gives me better prospective on the style.

There's also a bit of fruity sweetness noticable too, but the lingering finish is tart. For the most part the taste is similar to the aroma. The sour/tartness is very noticable, but not overpowering.

From the satisfying pop of the little champagne style cork, through the nice soft foamy pouring into the glass, the complex, musty, slightly pungent aroma, through the searing, withering, puckering tartness, it is really something to ponder.

Strong citric presence, alcohol is muted. The body is just fine, pretty thin overall but smooth enough. Carbonation makes some elements of the sip seem like carbonated water. Great sour beer, exactly what a gueuze should act like.","BretSikkink","Mar 27, 2009"

Miniscule traces of carbonation rise to the surface. Mildly pungent and sharp, wet wood, with a vegetal note like wildflower and lemon peel compost. Tastes much the same, a moderately citric lemon sourness: 6/10 scale, very soft and supple feel with little carbonation. The woody element seems to dominate, with some bitter tannin in the aftertaste. A few of these would be really great, but I had to limit myself to one. The novelty of the cask serving made me daydream of what it must be like to drink in the rare Lambic cafes found in Belgium.

But anyhow, this was just too much sourness for me, it took me off guard and perhaps next time I try a Geuze I will be more prepared.

Flavor follows suit, but not as strong as the nose. Very sour and tart, some fruitiness, slightly medicinal. Low carbonation, very slick on the tongue. I like the funk and the sour, but this is a bit much for my personal taste. I'm sure there are many who appreciate it for the style, and more power to them.

While it is extremely tart and carbonated in a medium body, it contains a good amount of fruit in the taste like apple, grape, some sour citrus and has a dry backbite that kicks your ass. While there's no malts I can put my finger on, there's a very mild sweetness that shields this beer from being overly bitter. I didn't drink this for a special occasion; it is not necessary.

You can definitely taste some fruits before the champagne dryness comes through. This is extremely tart and not my style but I have to judge it on the style and it fits it to a tie even though it could have a little bit more of a fruit taste to it.

Sourness becomes a stable/hay flavor and is less intense after a couple of sips. Delicate but complex flavor with pineapple and grapefruit notes. very tasty.

This was my first experience with the Gueuze style. Clearly it takes someone with a niche palate and a strong control of the gag reflex to appreciate this stuff. I am not wussy enough to avoid it and will try to find something that is more palatable in the future, but glossing it over with charming adjectives isn't gonna work. The words ""chicken coop shit"" came to mind the minute it was presented and I took a wiff at a very special bar in Brookline, Mass called Publick House and Monk's Cell. The barnyard nastiness continued in the taste but it was exacerbated by the blended sour brew that was part of the blend of this beer. The Belgian sour in and of itself takes a great deal to get used to. If you've never experienced a ""rauchbier"" then you're in for a double wammy when you taste this concoction. ""Funky"" is being kind. Avoid this style if you want to avoid losing your dinner or if you've never come close to similiar flavors in your Belgian experience before. Like I said, I'll explore the Gueze style again but I will proceed with extreme caution before doing so. Nasty, nasty stuff.","jim102864","Feb 29, 2008"

The taste is very good, the first to hit you is the sweetness of the wheat malt, accented by lively carbination followed by a great puckering sourness. A dry finish, but not as dry as some other gueuzes. The mouthfeel is really good, with the carbination bubbling on the tounge as the mouth puckers around it.

A mutli-layered finish: first very weet, then tart, finally just plain sour. A clearly cut 3 level mouthfeel. Aroma of rotting fruit (though more pleasant than it sounds!) I would say most closely resembled apricot, pear, and apple. Very complete mouthfeel. A sugary round-a-bout finish. Carbonation high, but very controlled. Leaves a sticky feeling on your teeth. A wine-like flavour, carbonation makes it sweet, reminiscent of champagne. Flavour (slightly void, and yeasty) diminishes quickly and youre left with not much else but over-ripe tartness. Really, not much taste, but tons of tartness. Lick your lips you get a sour sensation, as if you had eaten lots of candy. Sorta burns a hole in the back of your throat as the sourness floats around your gums. Adapted a cider-like complex as it warmed. Pretty fun!","biegaman","May 12, 2006"

Pours a fairly clear gold with 1 inch of off white head that tries to lace the flute. Smells of various plants and animals, dung, leather, rotting fruit?, mustiness, and other qualities I can't name. Just from the aroma you can visualize the fields and musty barns that must be near the brewery. It has a medium body that is quite dry and tingly, staying carbonated forever. The flavor is sour, musty, tart, with an acidic bitterness and some of the aroma's scents coming through, but none of the sweetness that it may have hinted at, and few, if any, hops. An interesting style, but the pronounced sourness lowers the drinkability for me, though I would imagine it's more drinkable when balanced by sweetness as in fruit lambics. I will, however, keep looking for other examples of the style.","mmmbeer","Dec 12, 2005"

A very dry fruitiness, like Granny Smith apples mixed with, unbelievably, caju -- the Brazilian fruit cashews come from. The juice from one of these things will give you the most intense cotton mouth ever. It's insane, but this beer totally has this back of the palate dessicating effect going on that is only comparable to caju juice. Refreshing and mouth-puckering. Excellent stuff.

Perhaps because the yeast used didn't consume most of the sugar present, this gueuze is also much less tart than the others I've had. It's taste is a little muddled as well.

She's a woman for all seasons.

This beer has a slightly hazy apricot color. The head is initially large, but subsides after a few minutes. I spent at least that long sniffing the beer before I even took a sip. I love the funky, musty, acidic vinegar aroma. Am I the only man who gets a perverse pleasure from watching his friends smell this beer? The flavor is as good as the aroma. Sweet at first, but only for an instant before the sour kicks in. Flavors of grapes, straw, citrus, funk, and honey. Funky, but not the funkiest of gueuzes. Certainly among the most sour. For anyone who ever finds himself in a beer drinking rut where all beers seem boring, I would recommend drinking a gueuze. Hanssens is a great example of the style.","beveragecaptain","Mar 29, 2005"

Tart tannic tastes that varies from sharp to astringent througout the mouth. Some sweetness and carbonic bite. What a ride for the taste buds. Mouthfeel is minimal due to the nearly complete focus on the tongue but the finish is long lasting. If you like unblended lambics or sour ales then you will find this emmanently drinkable.

Fairly adequate malt base reminds of honey hence its not all about sourness. Truly a top echelon gueuze that does everything right and more. One Id keep a stash of, this and cuvée rené. Dry oaky palate with loads of yeast complexities. Cider like dryness develops toward the acidic funky finish. FUNKY. I love it. Medium to full body, low-medium carbonation.

4.35,2.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I must admit that this was my first non-fruity lambic. Thanks to Kluk for this bottle. Poured a hazy orange/golden. This beer simply looks sour. Smell is funky and reminds me of old gym socks and my old summer job at the horse ranch. Interesting. Taste is over the top sour. After I got used to it, I really liked it. Lemony sour, but also appley and very acidic. Methinks this is a good introduction to this untamed style of beer.","alexgash","Aug 16, 2003"

4.35,2.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"750 ml gree bottle with SB 07 on cork. Pours a golden yellow with a good head, that recedes quickly to a fine line. Very fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is of over ripe grapes and apples, sour and musty. The taste is like whoa! Sour apple pucker factor, saliva glands kick into overdrive. Knees start to buckle, eyes cross, and just when you think please no more, some cloying sweetness creeps in for the finish, almost but not quite like drinking champagne. Very enjoyable.","Indybeer","Jun 18, 2003"
4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hanssens has really been impressing me ever since I tried their Oudbeitje strawberry lambic. Very champagne-like both in appearance and mouthfeel. Poured a golden orange color with a lot of fine bubbles. Leaves a trace of tartness on the lips as it enters the mouth. Nice sweet undertones help take the harshness off the sour acidity. Had a hint of what could have been grass. Very dry.","jreitman","Apr 13, 2003"
4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"pours out an apple juice gold, bronze notes in the light. pretty foamy, large and lively head. mega musty aromas, tart fruits...lots of green apple notes. flavors of fruit tarts.....in your face puckering and mouth watering. you can faintly make out the barley malt base, but with the queen of tarts running roughshod all over your tongue, it's hard to make out any real malt flavors. fruit flavors run rampant. finishes dry as a bone. clean and crisp. damn snappy. i have limited experience with lambics or gueze lambics, but i found this really tasty and enlivening. refreshingly tart. i'm thinking this would be a great warm weather treat. fiancee liked it a lot too.","budgood1","Mar 25, 2003"
3.85,-9.4,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This lambic poured a nice golden color with thin white foam and good carbonation. The aroma was tart: sour green apples, come citrus. The taste was very tart, almost sour: apples and musty grapes dominated. The mouthfeel was very tart (almost too tart for my tastes, though it did grow on me). There was good carbonation, and a decent lingering flavor. The drinkability was OK. I am still not a big fan of Gueze lambics, but I am getting to like them a little more each time. I think this one would drink better in warmer weather.","UncleJimbo","Mar 16, 2003"
4.18,-1.6,5,4.5,4,4,4,"One of the more beautiful beers I've ever seen. The body is a clear amber with a peachy-pink tint. The head is easy forming but not impossible to keep under control. It lasts amazingingly well and sheets the glass beautifully. The aroma is not overly funky. I pick up more fresh fruit than horse blanket, but there's enough there to make me think of being outside while eating peaches and smelling the earthiness from my parent's garden on one side and a different type of earthiness from the horse pasture on the other. A little rotting wood (actually not a bad smell, it's omnipresent during any walk through the woods). The flavor is bright and very tart. Their's juicy fruit gum backed by an apricot smoothie and organges - clementines maybe. The tartness makes this refreshing but at the same time slows you down while drinking. It's almost like it's forcing you to relax and enjoy it.","aracauna","Mar 02, 2003"
4.32,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"It comes in a 375 ml bottle with a cage and cork. It pours a somewhat hazy gold with a hint of peach. The smell is sour and acidic and will curl the nose hairs. The Gueuze deal is growing on me. The tase is absolutely mouth-puckering. Tart fruit, apple or lemon-soaked pear (huh?) sticks to the lips and tongue. Musty flavors are also in the mix. Next time I need to pair this with some cheese to make the experience even better.","mickeymac","Feb 04, 2003"
4.27,0.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Hazy peach orange hue, topped by an initially thick head that steadily settles into a thin layer of loose froth. Tart, acidic fruit upfront in aroma gives way to a pungent waft of musty hay and damp horse blanket. Mellow hints of oak and cheesy, aged hops are present as an undertone. Trace note of meaty and sweaty, enteric fermented organic nitrogen. Assertive, nearly pucker inducing lactic tartness seizes the palate at first, then loosens slightly to allow expectedly tart notes of unripe kiwi as well pseudosweet balsamic laced acetic tartness to emerge. Mild woodiness and hints of grainy wheat emerge mid palate, adding depth to the overwhelmed malt character. Light in body, with a spritzy, lively mouthfeel. As CO2 dissapates, the mouthfeel becomes slightly creamier, revealing token residual dextrins. Finishes dry yet long, with a grainy, bready, and slightly chalky dryness fading into a lingering, but clean acidic tartness. Oude Gueuze is tremendously refreshing, tart and assertive overall in character. The complex tinge of mixed acid fermentation from enteric bacteria doesn't go unnoticed. While further aging won't tame the tartness, it may bring out the subdued woodiness that added richness. Delicious.","marc77","Feb 04, 2003"

4.5,5.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Lovely!!!!!! True lambic, balsamic earthy nose, very smelly, but in a good way. Palate was complex, sour, earthy, balsamic, and kind of reminded me of a really good salad dressing. refreshing aswell. Slightly mouth puckering, but well balanced and for the most part dry, despite a hint of tart sweetness, god damn lovely. True hardcore lambic.","rastaman","Dec 26, 2002"

4.77,12.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear, deep golden orangish color with a huge bubbly, champagne like head that settles down eventually.  Smells of some slight grass clippings, musty basements and the inside of a barn.  I swear if you close your eyes you would think you were in the cobweb strewn basement where this is fermented.  Extreme dryness and some cheek puckering tartness.  The only taste that can even be said to be near it would be some extremely tart apple cider.  Light on the tongue and very refreshing.  There is also some more of that musty basement in the flavor.  Excellently bitter and tart.  Extremely easy to drink and extremely tasty.  I cannot say enough about this brew.  They say you either love gueuze or hate it, count me as one of the first group.  This is one amazingly complex and awesomely tasty brew.  A big thanks to thelongbeachbum for his inspiring gueuze articles and his excellent recommendations.","Murph","Sep 27, 2002"
