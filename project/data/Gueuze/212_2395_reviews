"Hazy golden colour. Smells better than it tastes. Coriander, apples, white fruit. Too sweet for gueuze, low sourness. Pretty bad."

"A perfect lambic.  A sweet beer with the right touch of sour to make it very drinkable.  Enjoyed this beer very much."

"Quite a bit of sweetness for a Gueuze. Has only a mild sourness. Still pretty enjoyable and recommended for those trying to get into Sours."

"Nice aroma: fruity and tart with tones of hay and horse. Sweet, moderately tart with stockyard characteristics and fruit tones. By far, no hops at all. Light, not very fizzy and well-balanced beer."

"Overall: This beer isn't terrible overall, but it's an awful gueuze. I'm never going to have it again."
"Crisp, refreshing and a really easy drinker. Overall a good brew."
"Lots and lots of carbonation, which could explain the lack if head and lace. Golden and a bit hazy. Muted aroma, sour cherries and dog. Curious flavor. Nice start, sour fruit, chardonnay, very subtle bitterness. An odd iodine flavor on the finish (glassware issue?). Light body. All I could think of was the carbonation. Near overwhelming."

"o: one of my first gueuzes, enjoyable, but nothing amazing"

"Medium body and carbonation. Overall a pretty dumbed down Gueuze. Not bad, just nothing really special."

"Overall...interesting, but a big swing and a miss for me."
"The aroma was a bit lighter then I was expecting, but still tremendously good. Rich nose of tart apple vinegar, sour grapes and a touch of wet hay, as it warms it comes across with a light wheat or herbal like quality and just the tiniest amount of spice prickling the nose. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes of sour and biting vinegar flavor coming across on it right away. Light grapes and even a touch of wheat coming through mid palate, especially as it starts to warm"

"O - Simple geuze, containing the wild tart factor for sure. This one seemed a bit more toward the sour side."
"Overall - The beer had an interesting taste and and a nice look in the glass. It may not be as exciting as some of the other beers in its category/style, but I'm still happy I tried it. I don't think I'd buy it again however."
"Beer is medium in body but overall really light on the palate. It is mild all around, not really a gueuze ultimately but it's not horrid. Easy drinking lightish, mildly sour, kind of sweet beer."
"D - I am surprised this has such a low score, I thought it was a pretty decent gueze and would def drink it again. That said it wasn't crazy good and I think I prefer their fond traditional"
"Orange-brown. Strong smell of bananas without this fruit in the composition of the Gueuze. Mouth but a bit too watery despite a strange smell of bananas (a bit like the fruit sauces because they are feeling a little fiber and it is still quite soft in the mouth). The finish is subtly but quite low acid flavors. Little sugar, which is already better than nothing, but the body is too low compared to other lambic."
"Interesting but not as much as I'd hope from this style."
"I believe this is the first gueuze I've ever had, though I've had other lambics. Purchased at the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a pale orange colour with big white head. Nice retention and lacing covers about 1/4 of the glass. Smells of apples, lemon, quite tart. Flavour is both sour and sweet. Nice carbonation level. This reminds me of the Sour Patch Kids candy that I used to eat while I was younger. It tastes nice, but not something that I would drink everyday."
"Overall not bad, the metallic taste IMO really hurt this one. Each sip was just okay. Won't purchase again unfortunately."
"I had seen the reviews before I tried this, but had high hopes when I poured it. Although surprisingly clear, it had a nice head atop the deep golden liquid. Lacing was substantial too. The aroma off the beer was tart, though dominated by apple aromas. Sadly the taste was just apples with not nearly enough tartness at first, although over time it was getting sour. A nice bite with moderate carbonation, but not a beer I would seek out to drink ever again."
"Nothing really exciting here. It might be smooth, but the excessive sweetness means I would probably switch to something else after a glass or two."
"This is worse than the Faro to me b/c it really shouldn't be sweet. Judged as a Faro, I like this better than the three Faros that I just tried, but as a Gueuze this simply sucks; it is certainly not bad or objectionable tasting, just not a Gueuze."
"Tha beer was light gold colored with a thin white foam that dissipated quickly to a film. The aroma was slightly tart, more like an apple than like vinegar. The sweetness in the taste was also more indicative of apples than anything else. Very pleasant and easy to drink, with a minimum of funky sour bite. A great gateway to the style, not gonna be everyone's favorite but I liked it. Maybe it was the atmosphere..."
"Gueuze is a bit of an acquired taste; bad gueuze, such as this, goes far beyond that. Counterfeits like St Louis Gueuze prove that brewing is not a medium in which one can lie successfully. Industry and machines are no substitute for human touch and the sum of hundreds of years of tried and tested development, nurturing and tradition."
"Nice strongly carbonated mouthfeel, a very refreshing and drinkable beer. My first Gueuze and somewhat impressed."
"Overall, a nicely subdued version of the style, compared to others that I've tried recently - my teeth are not tingling after every sip!"
"Unfortunately, I'm a little sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners so the acesulfame-potassium leaves a slightly off taste for me in the crisp finish."
"375ml bottle. Part of the LCBO's Spring 2010 Beer Release. Cider golden yellow with amber hues, a ring of white head, and dots of lacing on the stange. Sour candy, horse blanket, and barnyard aromas suggest the use of Brett. I also get some flower pedals. Taste is sweet, fruity malts, citrus, and a lemony, sour tartness that quickly fades away. More funk (woody, herbal) and hints of vinegar in the aftertaste. Not as sugary as I thought it would be, which is a good thing. Light-bodied mouthfeel is spritzy, spiced, and astringent. Decent enough, but I don't actually enjoy it. Meh."
"This being my first Gueuze, I didn't know what to expect, but this left me satisfied. If the sweetness of this derived from real fruits rather than artifical sweeteners, I think it would be a completely different beer. At a slightly higher price tag for a somewhat average beer, I won't be buying this too often, but this one does leave me looking forward to my next gueuze."
"Drinkable if too sweet, but certainly nothing I will ever come back to and not a great first impression of the style."
"Since this is my first gueuze (or first brew labeled as such), I'm not sure if St Louis is doing the style justice. It's a drinkable beer, certainly a slow sipper, yet not one I'm liable to pick up in the future. Might cellar a bottle for a while, see what it does."
"Do to the sourness i couldn't drink much more then a glass or two but this was a very tasty gueuze."
"D= Refreshing and easy to drink. Not the best sour ale I have had but surely a worthy one. Could make a great session beer."
"D: This is a solid gueuze, not as complex for sure as others I've had, but the lactic acid is there and it's not a brew that's been dumbed down for the masses, traditional flavours, I just expect more funk and complexity in this style, this was almost Berliner Weisse like in its characteristics."
"Picked up a small bottle at a Brussels beer shop to drink in the hotel. Pours into a small wine glass a ripe gold color with a shin off white head that quickly dissolves to thin lace. Aroma contains tart, almost candy like apple notes, hints of vinegar, and a generic Belgian pale fruity yeastiness. The taste is mildly tart and sour on the front of the palate but quickly turns sweet and almost sugary with apple flavors and pale malts making up the bulk of the flavor. Hops seem to be absent entirely. Body is crisp and smooth with moderate carbonation. Easy to drink but not my favorite of the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a really nice sour Belgian beer that isn't as harsh as others of its kind and is worth drinking for a long time."
"Overall, a fun beer to try with a heightened experience since it was a gift flown over from the source. Thank you Roger!"
"Taste: sickly sweet, oh my God. The aroma was a trick! It's like apple juice without the depth of flavour. The sour note is there, hanging in the background, and a bit of a brett aftertaste, but it's like the added a bunch of sugar to mask what could have been an alright sour beer. Mouthfeel is light and airy with a soft carbonation. It would be refreshing is the beer wasn't so dreadful in the flavour department. No way would I want another."
"Pours a golden apple colour, one finger white head that quickly dissipates. Nose- sweet apple juice, very slight wood. Taste- very sweet, flat and ugly. Grainy, musky, thick syrupy mess. A beer you would give someone if you really didn't enjoy hanging out with said person. A total drain pour. The only ""gueze"" available in Manitoba and what a gem it is. Figures, thanks MLCC for another piss poor choice. Keep them coming"
"A white head with some lacing that stuck around. the colour was a bit more amber than apple juice, fairly clear liquid. Carbonation in evidence, slow and lazy. I happened to have this right after a session in the hot tub and the fruity nose was quite welcome, lemon lime fruit zest and all. The taste was similarly citrus fruit, a bit snappy, with a sour dough bread feel. Some green apples presence; not sugary at all, thanks for that. Overall, I found this refreshing and uplifting although not overly complicated, not bad for the first day of June after spending time in the garden and unwinding in the tub."
"A ""for the masses"" lambic that would be useful to open friends eyes to what beer can be, not your ""wild ale sour-heads"" dream beer though."
"I tried this beer on March 3, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent orangy-red colour with a generous white bubbly head which quickly disappeared. The aroma was faintly sour apples. not as strong as others have suggested. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, almost creamy, and highly carbonated. The flavour wasn't all that sweet...very reminiscent of the crabapples I used to eat as a child on the way to school. Not a lot of malty flavours or hoppy tones in this one."
"D- I could probably have a few of these if they were very cold. I do believe that the sweetness would start to bother me very quickly otherwise."
"Tastes blends with the nose, fruits, sugars, a bit of funk and more than enough carbonation. A decent drinker but I cant see myself buying this again."
"jh"
"D - Not great, but easy drinking. I would drink it again, but I wouldn't buy it."
"It's drinkable. Not challenging, I agree with others, a good introduction to the style for non-geeks. I don't loath it like some."
"No reason to discount this as a serious lambic blend...but it is best suited to turning on your wife or friends to this style."
"Drinkability : une gueuez correcte mais sans plus (je préfére la st louis gueuze fond tradition)"
"However, I definitely wouldn't recommend paying the import price for it if you're a real lambic-head, and purists will hate it."
"citrusy sweetness and some slight grapefruit sour. light and sharply carbonated, perhaps a bit too light. finishes with a cleansing tartness, but slightly empty and weak. enjoyable but forgettable."
"Smooth geuze, its the corn and sugar making it an easy drink after a lot of work. Popular with my mates, and a nudge to transition them away from macros. Not a quality geuze but I have had worse and less drinkable. Light body. The cork was a good quality."
"It's not bad...I'd drink it again, but I doubt I'll be seeking it out."
"It's ok, dog."
"Reddish gold. Papery aromas smell hospitally alongside typical Gueuze rancid apple aromas. Bizzarre. There is an assertive neutrality to the flavor. Metal, neutral and sweet alcohol, apply fruit and chalk crowd the perimeter. Globs of incoherent gas point to nothing. Watery and sweet. Why did they waste natural cork on this bottle? If bland, tasteless beer is desired, drink North American macro-style. Save a cork tree. Wine needs it."
"What a waste of 3.75."
"375 mL green bottle, corked, best before date stamped on the rear label."
"Pretty light weight tame for a geuze."
"Bottle: Poured a medium clear amber color ale with a huge white foamy head with good retention. Faint barnyard aroma can be detected as well as subtle sourness. Taste is sweeter then regular gueuze with some sweetness but no acidity. Complexity is quite low and I guess this would be more of a beginner gueuze then anything else."
"Very lightly sour and pretty sweet. I can hardly imagine this to be a gueuze as sweet and friendly as this is. Whereas gueuze normally tastes like how a unclean barnyard smells, this is bright and cheerful, zesty and clean. Very enjoyable."
"Well for me, this was always going to be too sweet to be any good. Theres some light earthy notes, with some tartness and light sourness. But the sweetness i think dominates this, i think this needs more stink and more sour and has to be a lot dryer, an average mainstream gueuze."
