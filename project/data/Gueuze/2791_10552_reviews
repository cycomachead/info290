"Overall, a very nice and enjoyable beer - would be especially good when the weather is warm."
"Overall, this is a hot summer night beer, made for drinking not thinking. The price belies that, as does style category. FAIL, but still drinkable."

"There's not much to say except that this doesn't really work. Disappointingly artificial and sweet."
"O: a complete misfigure. A yellow gueuze that doesn't earn this name."
"An OK gueuze but not the best example I've ever tried. The sugary sweetness doesn't sit all that well, and doesn't meld properly with the acidic character. Not too sure about the addition of apples either, this adds a flavour that feels like it doesn't belong. I also found the excessive floating yeast to be a flaw that is visually unappealing. Still, the elements of lambic are present and it would probably make a decent 'starter' for someone new to the style."
"This is not a gueuze but a faro, even though they make a faro and this clearly says gueuze on the label I find that hard to believe. It's thin and grainy and sugary sweet. I drank my share unlike the others who just poured it out. Huge disappointment, like I said."
"Pour yields a slightly-hazy golden brew with a thin white head and not much in the way of retention of lacing. The nose immediately indicates that this is not going to be a very good beer, and certainly not going to be a good gueuze. There is quite a bit of sweetness along with too much fruit. No funk at all. The flavor and palate come together with way too much sweetness. Not quite cloying for beer in general, though certainly so for something calling itself a gueuze. Just gross. Drainpour."
"Best before: Sept 24 2011"
"D: very drinkable. It's nice and refreshing."
"d) 5.3% apple juice, hey ? Interesting 'tradition'... makes for a tasty summer drink, yet is light years away from other Gueuzes.... No funk, no gameyness, no smelly socks or stinky cheese rind..."
"It is a very tasty beer, just not a tasty gueuze."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style Gueuze traditional."
"There is really not a whole lot going on in this beer, it is fairly tart (though certainly not on the hard side for a Lambic) though, so it is a bit puzzling that this beer is so clean. It really could use some characteristic funkiness; even a little bit of Brettanomyces character would go a long way here."
"Delicous beer that is perfect for a hot summer day."
"I can't understand why a beer of this tradition can be spoiled in this way."
"Sparkling golden colour, small white head and some lacing. Sweaty and sour aroma. Very intense and funky smell. Tastes lemony, sour and acidic with some suggestions of dry white wine. Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. A complex, sour and intense beer."
