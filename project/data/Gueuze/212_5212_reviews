"Had on tap a few days prior. It had an interesting slightly tart and salty flavor without becoming cloying. Very refreshing."
"Pour is hazed deep orangish amber with a good bit of white head.  Nose is burnt sulfur, almost like the cooked ash of a firework.  Taste is pretty rough, overly sweet and sugar with tons of burnt sufur and burnt out sparkler.  Just bad, don't drink."
""
""
""
"Has a lemony tart nose. It pours hazy gold with a head that looks like the foam on the sea shore after a big storm – it’s big, fluffy and persistent. The palate is a balance of lemony tartness and light sweetness. It is somewhat unexciting but perhaps a good starter for those looking for a less intimidating Gueuze."
"Overall: Quite an enjoyable gueuze, pure yeast ester flavors left unmolested by hops or excessive malt. I will repeat this one."
""
""
""
"Not the best I've in a sour. I feel like the sour really over powers the flavors. Good"
"overall: not the best Gueuze but very nice."
""

""
"just wanted more funk to it"
""
"Just okay.  Nothing wrong with this beer, but it lacks complexity.  Taste is very strongly sour, almost vinegar like.  Hints of citrus.  I would not buy it again, but I am glad I tried it."
""
""
"not blended well.  stale bread.  harsh"
"On tap at Beachwood BBQ poured into footed tumbler. Appearance is orange-gold with some cloudiness, a thin ring of bubbles, and a few spots of lacing. Aroma is tart citrus, barnyard funk, cider vinegar, and some green apple sweetness. Taste is briefly sweet citrus, quickly replaced by tart vinegar and lemon sourness. The funkiness is there, too, but less than the nose indicated. Medium body, thin texture, active carbonation, crisp, drying, puckering finish."
"O: Always interesting to try a beer with a bit of age but I think I would have enjoyed this better fresher and will try to find a younger bottle. If you like sour, this definitely delivers and is worth a try"

"Final Grade: 3.93, a B+. As someone with very little experience in the field of lambics, all I can really offer here is a subjective opinion: I find St. Louis Gueuze Fond Tradition to be pretty good value for the price, but it still doesn't strike me as the best that this style has to offer. Recommended as an accessible, affordable introduction to the world of sours; I'll grab another bottle and hold onto it for a few years to see if there are any new developments, but for now I'll just call this a pretty good lambic and leave it at that."

"Not the best representation of the style, but a good buy when you have limited other options."

"Poured into a tulip a hazy/cloudy dark golden color with one finger of bright white head. No lacing but a good ring around the top. The nose is strong. A musky aroma. Sour apple, white grape, lemon and oak seem to be the most obvious but a little wheat and a little bit of bread. The taste is a wonderful sour and sweetness.  Tart big lemon and sour apple. White wine and a burst of sweetness. Very dry finish. Perfect amount of dryness for the style. The mouthfeel was light, crisp and had champagne carbonation that give an added bite. Overall a very nice lambic with good sour notes and a dry finish. Good price for the style too."
"Some serious off-flavor from the bottle... plastic almost. It doesn't suck but it's off-putting."
"On draft. Some rubber and plastic in taste that is really unfortunate. Smells like and really should be a decent budget gueuze but the off flavors make it marginally bad. Never had from bottle, hopefully a lot better in bottle."

"Newbie to reviewing but I love this"
"Pours an opaque but radiant dark orange, with dense white head settling to a thin ring, with trailing streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: cherry, limeade, hay, barnyard note, oaky, overripe apricot. Taste: sour cherry, lemon segment, soured overripe peach, herbal, oaky, with vanilla, acetic, and hay notes. Medium bodied, sugary beneath the sour and mild funk, then finishing dry with oak and grape skin. Bottled 1/2014. Really nice, balanced approach and flavorful."

"Short bitterness. Great gueuze overall"
""
""
"O- Love the finish to this beer, and the overall feel. However, I think this lacks depth in flavor compared to others. It's tangy, it's sweet, but not a lot more. Could be primarily a young lambic in the blend? Still wonderful."

"Hazed golden orange colour, a finger of white head with no lace to speak of. Smell is funky and musty barnyard, green apple and lemon, oaky, lactic and cheese rind, as it warms get a bit of caramel as well. Taste is tart and lemony, acidic with a mid palate puckering sour, fruity toward the finish, subtle lactic notes, oak in the beginning and aftertaste, drying aftertaste. Medium-high carbonation, medium dry oaky body. Really good, was more than impressed with this offering especially at around $4 a bottle."
""
""
"Overall I loved this beer.  Very refreshing would get it again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: small sips recommended, and you may even want to split the small bottle with a friend - this is intensely tart as per the style, lemony, simple, and refreshing"
"3.48/5: Want to jump into the style? Here's your beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I got a lot of traditional Gueuze notes, but many lacked the depth and impact to really make this a memorable brew.  The dryness is there, but doesn't consume the drinker.  The tartness is there, but sort of gets lost in the woody notes.  A fun brew but the elite ones are a few notches ahead."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours out a light orange with a thin, bone white head.  Smells of wheat, crackery grain, bretty funk, and typical sweaty lambic.  Taste is a bit sweeter than some other traditional geuzes I've had.  I get some fruitiness from the yeast.  Very sour.  Finishes dry.  I pick up some brett and general bug funk.  Slight cheesiness.  Carbonation is sharp on the tongue, but it isn't excessive.  This is a good but not excellent example of a geuze."

"Overall - a fine introductory beer for the style, and while I'd don't have the capability to determine how this stacks up with other representatives from this style, I can tell you that it was and intriguing beer that I enjoyed quite a bit and would consider purchasing again."
""
""
"Overall - A very solid gueuze. I had a Cantillon bio gueuze the other day and while that was way more complex, this is is right up there in overall quality. Lots of great sour flavour to sip on and I will pick up some more to cellar to see how it develops."

"(4.0) D: This was very good lambic with all great qualities of the style coming through. While the taste was very good the aroma really stood out for me."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/18/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of sour green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, light pepper, and yeast/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, grass, leather, oak, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, leather, oak, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, dry, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very nice gueuze style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours a nice amber yellow with a decent hit. Good carbonation. Bottle indicates brewed in 2012. Smells like a typical lambic. Taste is typical sour but surprisingly without any hint of sweetness. Nice clean refreshing beer with a sour finish. Not a lot of substance. Lots of unfiltered goodies at the bottom of the bottle."

"Overall: Pretty nice gueuze. It doesn't measure up to Cantillon, 3F and some others, but considering the low price point (I think I got this for $3.99 per bottle) this is a great budget gueuze."

"Bright, acidic, and funky character that blends well with the yeasty malts. This beer has has a strong presence of soured fruit. A nice example of my favorite style of beer."
""
"Pours a orangish brown with minimal head and immediately dissipating lace. Aroma of damp hay, grape must, bready yeasts. Sourness is actually quite pleasant, theres an earthy dankness I can't quite get around, something like mushrooms having absorbed to much moisture. This taste gains in strength as the beer sits a little while. The crispness is refreshing, this beer is quite dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the most acidic gueuze I’ve ever had, a very high pucker factor."

"Pours a hazy gold with a thin layer of white head, nice lacing and well carbed. Definitely some peach in the nose - bit sweeter smelling than I expected. The flavor has the sour funk I expected, though I really wanted a bit more out of it. It's a very solid brew that I'll certainly have again."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice beer and quite interesting. The extra fruitiness is different than other Geuzes and makes this one unique. Not my favorite but it is an enjoyable drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is hazy golden with a small white head. Aromas of hay, grass, barn funk, typical gueuze scents, perhaps a sprinkling of black pepper. Similar flavor, with earth tones and a mild grainy aspect. pretty tasty. Crisp with a dry finish. For a ubiquitous gueuze, this isn't bad at all."
""
""
"Hazy golden straw color with a finger and a half of head that dissipates quickly. The nose has some artificial fruit aromas, like cherry kool-aid and grape kool-aid, clean pale malts, a slight vinous quality and some barnyard funk. I get wheat and bread yeast on the front of the tongue with a sharp sour attack on the way down, then a lemony finish and nice bready aftertaste. Drinkable, light, and highly carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good beer, not overly sour has a good fruity tart mix going on. I prefer a dryer less fruity gueuze than what this offers. a little too much like a sour plum wine for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Murky golden color with head reducing to ring of clumpy lacing. Light floral, fruity and bready malt aromas with some sourness. Taste is some bright fruit with moderate sourness. Some bready malt (oxidation?) which lingers unpleasantly on the aftertaste. Relatively thin and light mouthfeel with fizzy carbonation. Not very complex but refreshing and drinkable despite the aftertaste. Not a bad beer but not a great gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A good beer that I'm glad I got to try on tap, nowhere near the complexity of some other gueuze's, but would make a good into to the style"
""
""
"Overly sour where no sweetness is present (unlike the smell). Lip smacking tartness which makes for a lingering aftertaste. Watery with a below average carbonation level."
""
""
"Poured a golden orange body with well-carbonated fizzy head that leaves little lace. Mostly a sour, tart, funky smell that reminded me a bit of an oaky white wine with sour apple/white grape skin aroma. The beer is light bodied, very sharp and crisp, mostly tart and funky taste notes (again along with sour fruit flavors). A great sipper for a simple gueze."

"This is my first gueuze so I’m hardly a connoisseur. Poured a cloudy, gold color (3-7 SRM). Didn't generate much of a head. Aroma was sour and earthy. Initial taste lit my mouth on fire with high carbonation. Picked up tart sour apple flavor and some other off flavor I couldn’t recognize or put a label on. Rather dry. Absolutely no hop aroma, flavor or bitterness. The lace dropped like a rock, leaving no evidence of a head at all. These beers are known for their complexity and this one lived up to their rep. As for this particular one...been there, done that. Not bad but I’ll be exploring other gueuzes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good tasty beer that will introduce anyone to the still. Not too much puckering and not too sour make it a pretty drinkable one"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability renders FondnTradtion something I will return to. Cheers."
"The body was light, crisp, and smooth, with a very dry, tart finish. Drinkability was very good, the beer was gone quickly, and I would have had another, had I possessed another. Overall, a very nice brew. Not overpowering, and quite enjoyable. Certainly worth trying if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the flavor, and especially the aroma, are the outstanding qualities of this beer. I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer for the style, but am not really keen on Lambic beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent gueuze. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"A little bit under the level of complexity of some of the other gueuzes out there, but very enjoyable and the price point is excellent."
"Overall a very good, clean, straightforward gueuze."
""
"O- Great. Love it. Even though it is almost half the price of others it was really a great beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
"Gueuze Fond Tradition is a superb version of the style. Its dry and earthen character is quintessential of the style and that is delivered with ease. Yet still, the ale deserves even drier character, even deeper earthiness and intangibles like almond pithiness and peps of cinnamon that could really set it apart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear light copper with only a half finger of off-white head. Relatively subtle aroma is comprised of lemon and light funk. Definitely not the most complex aroma, but pleasant enough. Similarly, the taste is somewhat light and very refreshing, with lemon again leading the way, along with some very mild funk. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a semi-dry finish. Overall, a very refreshing gueuze, though nowhere near the complexity of the better blends. Still, I would have this again when in the mood for a lighter version of the style, and the price point is good as well."
"O- I'm glad I got to try this beer, thanks to the bottle shop I scored it in down in Missoula. Good all around, but I'm sure Cantillon has better examples of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good for the style although not great."
""
""

""
"O: not one of my favorite gueuze's but pretty good once you get past the initial vinegar notes"
""
""
"Drinkability is pretty good, the nose is fantastic, but the quick finish is a little disappointing. Seems to have lost some complexity with time, contrary to my expectations."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: They say that if it looks like a pig, acts like a pig, and tastes like a pig. This looks good, smells good, but to me doesn't taste good. So I'm guessing this style just isn't for me. I can't taste anything wrong with it, just don't like it. Bear in mind that while I've been drinking beer a little while, I'm new to reviewing and this is my first of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a bright gold with a fingers worth of head into a tulip. Slight haze present which is expected since it is an unfiltered lambic. Tart, sour with a slight pale malt present in the nose. Quite inviting and not overly sour nose. Palate starts out quite tart with raspberries and lemon there as well. Medium bodied with a slight dry finish quite tart. Overall, this is a very nice Lambic. I'm reasonably new to whites of this style and i have only had a couple but I am beginning to appreciate this style a lot. I love how this takes a much more sour/tart approach without the fruit assault present in most other lambics I have tasted. Really nice. Cheers."
"mf: high carbonation, pretty full bodied, it works."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dramatics aside, this beer is immensely tart, and if you can love that, than you'll absolutely love this beer"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a cloudy orange with a thin white head that left no lacing. Scents of brett funk, barnyard like scents and some slight fruit. Flavor begins with sour notes reminiscent of lemon, there's also a dry white wine like flavor underneath the sour. It finishes on a dry note with a very grainy flavor that carries into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. It's a good geuze, though not as complex as the other I've tried. Worth trying, but not what I'd call my favorite for the style."
""
""
"Overall - A very complex and refreshing beer. The balance between malt character and yeast derived aroma/flavor works wonderfully and gives the beer dual purpose as both an afternoon thirst quencher and a mealtime accompaniment. RE: lack of musty, barnyard character - Possibly blend with more of the older, more developed lambic to pronounce the earthy character of the Senne River Valley. Otherwise, a wonderful gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Small head but excellent lacing on my out on a slightly hazy golden with orange hue body. Flavor is very fruity, somewhat spicey with hints if grain and club soda. Flavor has a nice tart and sour citrus throughout with a wild and funky presence and nice yeast flavoring. Light to medium body and moderate carbonation. Definitely sharper and more flavorful than others I have had in the style. Excellent wild and sour presence."
""
""
""
""
"O - Refreshing in the only way a sour can, a little like a shanty."
""
""
"This was crisp and tart, and had the perfect amount of carbonation. I noticed a high amount of floating yeast but this does not bother me- it is unfiltered after all. Enjoyed super cold from a tulip glass. Overall, this is an above average sour at a reasonable price. Paid $9.00 for 12.7 oz."
""
""
""
""
"o: a very nice gueuze, complex bacterial character really makes this one"
"O: extra tart and dry with limited funk (excepting the nose)."
""
""
""
""
"O - overal , a medium sour. Liked it."
""
"The beer pours like liquid copper with a nice white head that sits as a half finger’s width above the glass. The beer’s body is murky like swamp water with a great torrent of carbonation constantly flowing to replenish the head. It’s not the most beautiful thing to look at in the glass, but it isn’t the ugliest either. The beer’s lacing is light and splotchy on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells properly funky with a big sweet cherry fruit leather and a touch of musty barnyard. The wheat malts are light here, but surprisingly I can pick up a bit of a cereal breadiness in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes properly acidic with big interplay of sweet funk and sweet cereal malt on the back. The beer begins with acidic sweet water which opens quickly into cherry fruit leather with touches of barnyard before rushing into a finish of thick wheat cereal malts that start syrupy, blending with the cherry flavors before turning dry and powdery. The aftertaste is long, ringing lightly with funk and acid. On the mouth the beer feels medium light in body, and leaves the tongue tingling and a little dry. The beer’s carbonation is high, prickling the tongue nicely, though not as strongly as some gueuze. Overall, this is a tasty beer with some nice complexity, but a bit short of a full gueuze flavor for me. It’s delicious and quite easy to drink, but really mellow on the back of the palate, and the taste of wheat in such strength is surprising for the style. I like this beer, I just don’t think it is quite a gueuze. This beer is worth a try."
""
"Overall this one is one is just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good representative of the gueuze style and a good substitute for the classic Cantillon gueuze (best of the style, imho), which is much harder to get, at least here in Kansas City. It's also very reasonably priced. I think I'll need to buy a bottle to age and see how it develops. It's very good fresh."
"O: Love it. Would go well with sharp cheese. After first sip I thought I wouldn’t want the whole bottle but its complex, and leaves me wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first gueuze, and I am very interested in trying more following this one."
""
""
"o - Overall a decent gueuze. Not my favorite as the sourness and funk is very light, and it is a little too sweet for me, but better than no gueuze on tap. Could see someone trying to get into the style liking this one as a gateway gueuze. Would have it again sometime."
""
""
""
"Overall: A Great example of a classic gueuze; Not the most complex take on the style, but definitely a fantastic introduction to the diverse world of sours."
""
"Beautiful amber color. While I'm relatively new to Gueuzes, this strikes me as a solid offering and a good value for the money (about $6 USD). I'll be back for more."
""
""
""
"Gueuze is hard to come by and for this being readily available and at $6 a pop you can't go wrong. Or you can dish out 3 times as much for delicious 3 Fonteinen!"
""
"O - A decent enough gueuze. Not at the top of my list for the style but it is still solid and definitely worth the lower than average price."
"Overall, I'd say this is a decent gueuze. Not the best I've had, but still enjoyable. Would have it again if I wasn't able to get my hands on some, say, Lindeman's gueuze cuve rene, and I had a taste for some gueuze. But there are some better options available out there (usually)."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the sourness through the nose. It was nicely drying, helping to box out any overt residual sugars, all while retaining the big sourness and tartness so perfect to the style. The taste did follow nicely, with sourdough breadiness, and that same hearty sourness and funk. There was less fruity sweetness than expected, so expect for this one to be a bit more serious on the palate. The grain, too, was a bit chalky and seemed out of place, but things otherwise stayed pretty juicy, despite the wild bitterness of yeast."
"Filtered orange, with a white head. Light lace and medium retention. Nose is earthy, tart lemon, light mushroom and some herbal character. Taste is tart upfront, lemon, light earth, with a grainy/cereally pale malt. Neutral, not notably sour in the end. Light bite to the carbonation, medium high carb. OK, but the malt finish was off-putting."
""
""
""
""
""
"Happy to discover a $6.50/375mL gueuze that's actually reasonably good."
""
"A excellent gueuze here, and definitely good to find around these parts while I still wait for Cantillon to show up someday. Definitely not as exaggerated as their Lambics though, and this is a really good one for beginners getting into the gueuze style. This balanced enough, which makes it easy to drink, yet complex enough to attract wowed reactions from beer fans of all kinds, particularly sours. Hoorah!"
""
"O- Never tasted anything like this before. Then again, this is only the second true gueuze I've ever had and the first (Lindeman's Cuvee Rene) was too sour for me. I like this one's balance and restrained tartness. I picked it out because I love St. Louis framboise and figured I'd try something else by them. So glad I did, even if it was a little steep at $8 for a 12.7 oz bottle."
"Pours a hazy, orange color/maize color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of a hint of pale malt, hint of alcohol, strong tartness, strong sourness, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of a Gueuze. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of tartness, strong sour notes, slight pale malt, and slight citrus. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend."
"Another tasty gueuze that I hope evades the attention of Minnesotans for years to come."
"A little young and uneven this one."
""
"O- A very nice gueuze, definitely worth picking up. It would improve considerably if the funkiness carried through more strongly in the flavor, regardless finding a six-year-old gueuze for less than $7 a bottle is a steal."
"O: Having this relatively plentiful and available is a blessing. Will certainly have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm impressed. I didn't get a lot of vinegar like some others had, thank goodness! Would definitely pour again!"
""
""
""
"O: A very nice Gueuze with a refreshing tartness and a light touch of fruitiness. It's has balance and I'd defiantly buy this again given the chance. Gueuzes are a rare treat for me so I'd best enjoy this on it's own and shared with some friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Light to medium bodied. Good carbonation."
"O: Good, but inferior to some other commercially available gueuzes in my opinion."
"O: Didn't quite hit the spot for me - came across a bit weak in the taste. Maybe a little too heavy on the young lambic in the blend?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a good gueuze, but drinkable. Very sour and vinegary without the characteristics I love about the style."
""
"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a two finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus rine, funk, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus rine, funk, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I have had this so many times out of the bottle it is seriously not even funny. So when I saw this on-tap I had no choice but try this one. With it being on tap it actually enhanced the citrus aspect of this one for me. I was really happy that this was the case rather than just drinking the same beer over and over. Drink this one rather it is in a bottle or on-tap. You won’t regret it."
""
""
""
"High B-"
""
"The feel of this beer is smooth and pretty drinkable with a nice medium body that is feels like sour silk, smooth with a little crisp dry finish."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light bodied, with a moderate amount of wateriness around the edges, which isn't particularly desirable, and again makes me think more of a heavier lemonade than a gueuze. Carbonation is at the medium level, which foams this up nicely on the palate, resulting in a smooth mouthfeel initially, before the beer kind-of-falls-apart-into-wateriness. Closes out dryly, with a lingering bitterness."

"a majorly tart sour beer. pours a champaign-like bubbly pale yellow with a bit of haze and an excited white head. smells like brett, but not entirely. there is some other sour element here, not particularly fruity, i cant quite place it. flavor is of course very puckery, starting out sour and a little lemony, escalating to an almost sour warhead candy intense soure for just a second, then backing off into a manageable dry musty finish. mouthfeel is nice, ultra light on the body, with extremely intense carbonation. easy drinking, but an intense experience really. a beer like none ive ever had, i really enjoyed this one. a great introduction to the gueuze style."

"This looks much darker than any gueuze I can ever recall. It's a brownish orange. Flavor is a punch in the mouth of typical sour gueuzeness. If you use that word from here on out, I'll expect a quarter in royalties. I get a lot of lacto on this one. Overall it hits the mouth and makes the mouth contract and contort; as you'd expect for the style. Not too shabby, especially considering the style."

"Appears an apricot glowing haziness, minimal head retention and lacing but the looks is quite nice an off white foaming head. Aroma has barnyard funkiness to it with tart fruits including, peach apricot earthiness. Tart acidic lemons, with lactic yogurt notes as well. Flavor is refreshing tart and has lemon peel upfront with acidic notes of mild vinegarette. Or a tart plain yogurt, extremely tasty with fruit undertones, this is real lambic and more assertive than the overtly sugar filled Lindeman's. Mouthfeel finishes bone dry light to medium bodied with ample soft carbonation, goes down way too easily. Overall one of the better traditional guezue lambics I've come across."
"This beer pours a light bodied dull orangish gold in color with a one finger bright white head that turned to a lacing in a minute or so. The nose is full of dried peaches, acetic sour, hay, funk, Brett, with a slight citrus sweetness. Pretty solid nose. The flavors are dry and funky. There is a moderate amount of hay and barnyard to pair with an acidic and somewhat citrusy sour finish. The flavors don't disappoint. It's light and easy to drink. It does gave slightly more carbonation than a lot of Gueuze though. Overall this is a pretty decent Gueuze. It definitely doesn't disappoint. I would definitely take this over Oud Beersel or Boon any day."

"This has all of the great elements of a quality gueuze, and at an affordable price. Some astringencies/burn in the feel, but lasting flavor that finishes clean. Better than the money paid for."
"O: A nice beer, and a bit different then what I was expecting from a gueuze. Some of the flavors were a bit confusing to find in a beer for a newbie, but the nice body and carbonation help smooth things out. Formed an excellent pairing with the dinner as well. Cheers!"

"O: a great beer, that I will reach for again"
"T: There's definitely nothing bad about this beer, but it lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. Lots of lemon tartness and some faint pale malt. Not much funk to speak of here, and that's what I was kind of hoping for. Still, not a bad beer at all."
"Overall I enjoyed this. Would not drink this all the time but a nice change. This is my first of this style so forgive my ignorance."
"Overall, this is a very nice beer. Not my favorite style, but this didn't last long in my glass"
"Golden-amber colored beer with a fizzy white head. The beer has a barnyard, horse funk that's really enjoyable. Grass, fresh earth, and hay. After the initially intense sourness, the beer shows its balance...lots of flavor, along with under-ripe fruit (apples, apricots, pears) and refreshing sourness. Dry, although not as bone-dry as many lambics. Enjoyable brew."

"Overall: This is a good gueuze, but could be great if the flavors were a tad more assertive. I would definitely have this again, but there are other lambics I would drink ahead of this one if given the option. Still, its price tag is less than many of its style so it can definitely fullfil a craving for funk when on a budget. Definitely a worthy offering."
"Pours a clear light golden color with plenty of visible carbonation. Initial foamy white heady quickly recedes to half an inch and has some good staying power. Light lacing and a thin cap throughout. The nose is mostly acidic with a bit of lemon. Not too much funk, and the same goes for the flavor. Nothing off really, just balanced in a different direction than I would go. Light, crisp body with a fairly-heavy lemon-like acidity through the finish, which is quite dry. A decent gueuze, especially for the price."
""
""
"Light body finishes clean, with a crisp twang near the end. Sourness is the only thing that lingers, but not for very long."
""
"Overall great, but there are better gueuze beers from Belgium. However, this is an awesome beer and for the price and availability a great option compared to Drie Fonteinen or Cantillon. This is a true lambic and not a super sweet fake version either, so def worth a shot for all the sour fans out there."
""
"This was my first Gueuze. I was hesitant to try one because of the Lambic nature I've read about. I equate Lambics with Framboise and peach beers that have sugar added. I took the plunge and found out that this is not the case. I really enjoyed the sweetness of this beer because it wasn't over the top. It was really balanced, I'm guessing due to the nature of the older Lambic it was mixed with. I am happy I tried this Gueuze first, as it turned me on to the style."
""
"Overall, a pretty good gueuze with a nice tart bite. Fills my sour fix for sure. Very solid for the price point."
"Pours a murky orange with a 1 inch fizzy bone colored head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Some floating sediment is present in the glass. Smell is funky and tart but there is a particular sweet smell too. A bit of a skunky aroma came from the green bottle when it was opened but is not present after the beer is poured. Taste is also tart and funky but it gives way after each sip with a slightly sweet aftertaste. This beer has a higher level of carbonation with a very crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good gueuze with a better smell than taste but still a good beer to try."
"MF- Moderate body, but the carbonation levels make it feel a little lighter."
""
""
"Overall: I have to admit that I am new to lambics in general and also to the Gueuze style, but i know they are supposed to be intense and fruity...and this one has not failed my expectations at all...I quite enjoy it!"
"O-when i pick a random sour, i'm usually nervous, but i'm quite pleased with this one all around. it absolutely will satisfy your sour craving. there's not much complexity to it, but it is definitely a good beer and it disappeared rather quickly"

"light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine. I could see why it is rated so high, as it is quite different then anything I had tried in the past."

"Poured a cloudy almost murky golden yellow, with a thin cap of white head. Aroma was pretty light actually: tart with notes of lemon zest and apple skin, and a bit of barnyard funk. Taste was very nice, balance of tart and sweet, apples and lemon zest, wet grass, spicy yeast, and maybe just a drop of berry juice. Medium mouthfeel, nice and crisp and zesty. Drinkable, not too overbearing or sour, and quite good, even if not totally exemplary of the style."
"O: I don't have a lot of experience with gueuzes, but this is enjoyable. I'm not sure if I'd get this again, but it makes me want to try more from this style."
"Overall: a very good gueuze. Not very complex and not overly sour, but a good solid base and very drinkable."
"Nice beer! Liked the appearance, taste, smell, mouthfeel everything. Not overly complex or crazy sour, but a very nice session gueuze that really hit the spot. Not overly pricey either. Would try again!"
"Pours a hazy golden with a rocky white head. Smells initially of sour apple, followed by an onslaught of funky barnyard. Taste is initially warhead candy acid, followed by some green apple cider, a bit of grainy wheat, and finishing with an aged cheese flavor. Mouthfeel was smooth, average carbonation. Overall interesting, although quite tart and sour. The funky smell was just at about the limit for me, though I was glad I got to try this beer."
"Overall: Packs a tart/sour punch, but that's about it. Nice green apple flavor keeps things interesting, but it's not rewarding. A decent middle of the road gueuze in every way."
"I enjoyed the beer, but am still getting used to the style. I enjoyed how the citrus intermingled with the sourness, and wasn't completely overpowered."
"O: I won't buy this one another time. There's no reason to do that."
"Overall not bad but I enjoy Boon Geuze a bit more."
" Despite what this past paragraph says, I actually liked this beer a lot."
"O- Not as intense as im used to from this style. Might good for the intiate to the style. Overall solid offering but nothing amazing."
"O- good lambic to try out as a first. Overall a good beer I wouldn't mind trying again. Not bad for 7.99. Great to relax and sip on."
"Drink- Eh, it wasn’t that good and it wasn’t that bad. Just a bit thick for the style. Didn’t satisfy as I would have liked it to."
"$9 on tap at naja's"
"A somewhat sweet and lemony version of a gueuze. I would have preferred less sweetness and far more biting sour tartness."
"D - I really liked this beer; went well with my mussels at Brasserie Beck (DC).; worked well with fine cheeses and fish entree; I would highly recommend to others"
"Overall: A fine example of the lambic tradition"
"D: This was a very nice gueuze that was balanced between tart and funky, with some sweetness so it wasn't overpowering. The body was fitting, and it had a very smooth finish, so it was surprisingly easy to drink. Good example of the style for those learning to appreciate sours. I'm sure it could age for a long time, but it was still quite enjoyable (relatively) fresh."
"Pours a nice golden orange color. Aroma is sweet, sour, funky and cidery. Follows through to the taste, with a pronounced acidic sour note. Lemon peel, tart sour apple candy and a mellow funk all grace the palate. Great effervescence, though a bit more mellowed ontap versus the bottle. Finishes light, airy, dry and crisp. The bugs really did their job on this one, a nice sour and a smooth, sophisticated one at that."
"Drinkability: 4"
"O: Another good beer, but I'm still kinda left wondering what all the hype is about. Not wanting to spend big money on the rare ones to find out (Yet!). Will definitely keep exploring this style. Just enough to keep me intrigued."
"Narrative: 47 years of service. Francine Manzana gave that caramel apple pop company the best years of her life and she was terminated “for cause” for reading a Patricia Cornwell novel when she wasn’t clocked out. Francine wasn’t going to take this lying down. She knew the secret behind the tartness in those pops, and she had full intention on taking this issue public. With her box of belongings from her desk she strode over to the quality control center only to find that Loretta was out. “I will make them feel the tart bitterness of abandonment, just like they showed me.” With a few calibrations she reset the dials and the mixture began running an entirely new batch of Caramel Apple pops through the line. She stared at her spiteful reflection in the bubbling pool of acidic green glucose. The wafts of the additional citric acid stung her eyes and nostrils. Francine smiled and tossed her mystery novel into the simmering goo, for she had an unemployment officer to speak to."

"O: This one is pretty hardcore, not really balanced, but that's the goodness for me. Really sour."
"O: This is a good beer would enjoy another one anytime I came across it. But would not go out of my way to find it."
"This is a great gueuze. The flavors are balanced very well and provide an explosion of flavor with a fairly quick decay."
"O - This is well balanced in all the right areas. This was also priced pretty well at $7. A great entry level gueze to try along with a cuvee rene. I've been drinking more and more lambics now through, and I'm just really craving the funky brett notes."
"Big froth of head rises upwards rapidly. Apple juice hues and champagne bubbles. Aromas are very dirty and earthy, with an extra funky barny aroma. Tangy apples and lemony tartness in the flavor--much cleaner (and less earthy) than the aroma would have led me to believe. Thin mouthfeel, no complaints about the carbonation. I'm ok with the thin mouthfeel as long as there's a full flavor. This gueuze fails to stick its sour flavors to my taste buds for very long. Bitterness lingers, and my mouth is watering ... but there's just a little bit missing. Tiny cap of froth and some layers of lace stick around."
"I tried this beer on May 19, 2011 at ""Smokeless Joe"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy pinkish-orange with a thin white head, one which was easily replenshed. The aroma was tart fruit, grains, and yeast. The mouthfeel was weak bodied and highly carbonated. The flavour was tart fruit, and more tart fruit."
"Overall: This was a fun little gueuze. It does not compare to some of the epic monsters of the style, but it is a nice, refreshing beer."
"Overall - a good example of the style, not as complex as I might of hoped for"
"This has a nice amount of musty funk and sour to it. not going overboard but not layin low either. Mostly apples as I recall, and this went pretty well with a house salad."
"O: A really exciting beer that is far outside of the norm for the beers I typically drink. Crisp and refreshing, with a light “green” flavor that lingered on quite pleasantly. 4.0"
"O: tart and sour, these gueuzes are going further to bring me into liking sour beers more."
"EDIT: as this warmed up I found it more and more like apple cider. The numbers have been edited to reflect this-- although I still think this is a decent sour for the pricetag... It certainly is far from being an A-rated gueuze."
"D: On the whole, with a few defects, this is a well done, drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp but not quite dry with a rather heavy feel for 5% beer. Overall, a solid Gueuze for any sour lover to try."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sugary to sour white grapes. In the taste, dry sourness, fruity, especially white grapes. A sour bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry white grape tartness in the aftertaste. Nice sour, quite sweet in the nose, but dry in the taste, I can dig it!"
"Mouthfeel is lively due the tartness and high level of carbonation."
"(O) Very well done gueuze. This is up there with what a great gueuze should taste like. I'm looking forward to picking up a few more of these. Really liked this."
"-Cheers"
"D - this is a pretty solid beer. Only my second dive into the Gueze style, but it has left me wanting more. Not bad for the price I paid for it either. I'll have to revisit."
"This was really my first gueze experience. I had tried other lambics before such as Lindeman's, Boons, and a few others but all had been fruit beers. When I first tried Gueze Fond Tradition, I was amazed at how different it tasted. I loved the taste and feeling on the tongue as it was very crisp and didn't linger for too long. There is a very strong acidity to this beer and a few friends commented on it and the tartness. The lambics are certainly a unique and great types of beers and I hope to sample a lot more in the near future!"
"O: Nice mid range gueuze. Gets the job done for my money."
"The beer dances on the palate with plenty of carbonation. The flavors pack a sour punch. The lemon tartness forms the backbone for the vinegar, yeast and barnyard flavors. Earthy notes are subdued compared to the lemon sourness, but it lurks underneath reminding us this brew is indeed a Belgian brew."
"O- overall this is a good, classic gueze. This style is really starting to grow on me and this is an enjoyable brew. The 375 ml serving is plenty due to the high acidity in the mouthfeel."
"Not overly complex, but has no faults, is inexpensive for the style, and has good drinkability. Would serve well as a gateway to the style. I would pick this up again."
"D - This is a very nice gueuze. Love those sour ales."
"D - It's not over-the-top at all, instead it's a very good gueuze with good drinkability (although the acid combined with the last brew is starting to churn in my stomach)."
"Goes down smoothly. Leaves some creaminess in the mouth. A good gueuze, especially for its price."
"D: Due to my lack of experience with sours, I rate this at a fairly low drinkability, even with the moderate alcohol level."
"D - While I had no problem finishing this one, I won't get it again. The price may be right (at $7.50), but I'd rather pay a couple bucks more for a World-Beater Gueuze (Cantillon or Boon), not this pale imitation."
"Pours a slightly hazy, orangish gold color with a small white head that quickly thins out and disappears. Scent is VERY nice! Very funky and sour smelling with some nice, funky cheese aromas. The taste, however, is not as nice as it smells. The scent implies this beer is going to be a super funky, cheesy, complex, barnyard sour adventure. Although the taste is sour with some nice lemon flavors, it is not nearly as complex of funky as I was hoping. This does not mean the beer tastes bad, there are just so many better examples of a Gueuze out there. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but not to thin...maybe a bit watery. Drinkability is still fairly high as it is a very refreshing beer."
"D: This is a great gueuze if you are able to find it. I wasn't too hopeful going in to it, given that their other ""lambics"" are pasteurized and sweetened beyond recognition. Overall, this had all the flavors I expected to find, but not a whole lot more, especially in the way of complexity. Nonetheless, with the limited availability of gueuzes in America, I can confidently recommend this as a good gueuze."
"Drinkability: Good but not the best. Pretty good price."
"Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Has a syrupy feel on the teeth. Not terribly acidic, finishes quite dry..."
"D- was good but the sour fruit taste and wet musky taste were faint..this was an ok tasting gueuze for the price..but i would spend a few more $$ for cantillon,3F,or cuvee rene(same price) then this one"
"Bottle. Picked up at Dennis Bros. Poured into an Allagash tulip glass a clear apple juice colored orange color with some small floaties making their way around the glass. Slight white head that collars around the glass. Fruity sour aroma in the nose along with some wheat and funk but nothing too major. Light mouthfeel. Not sure how old this is but it has a nice sourness to it that is balancedout with some fruit type sweetness. Some funk kicks in in the middle. Pretty decent drinking beer. Ends with some lingering sweetness."
"Nice sparkling mouthfeel. Very appropriate. This is a nice example of the style. If I have a hankering for a sour ale, I won't be disappointed in this one."
"very good stuff, and quite interesting."
"Mellow, slightly subdued, but flavorful gueuze..."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed trying this one but not my favorite gueuze. Beter than I expected, and thankfully not sweet/fake/etc. Needs more funk and heft! Not Cantillon or 3F but will do in a pinch!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink compared to others in the style."
"(D)- I really could drink this one all day if it was not so sour, but I would not mind trying! This is a fantastic Gueuze definitely fitting for when you need that sour fix. Up there with some of the best."
"Pours a golden color with a medium head and some good lace. The aroma is a bit cidery with some barnyard aroma and a good bit of sweat. The flavor is very dry and very sour with a little cider note slipping in and a spiciness that I am not accustomed to in Gueuze, but I like it quite a bit."
"Overall this is a light and refreshing beer with a nice complexity and a hint of sweetness to balance all the sourness. I would drink this again."
"Nut brown color; cloudy throughout. No head or lacing, appears mostly flat. Fruity aroma of apple, raisins and a hint of dark cherry; earthy and powerful nose. Flavor of raisin and cherry at first with a bit of tartness, turning to an earthy, heavy-bodied taste with a bit of funk underlying the rest. Finishes quite sour with a mouth-puckering, fruity aftertaste. Overall, more fruity and tart than funky or earthy. Still a nice, balanced gueuze."
"Overall, these are only so drinkable. Well balanced and tasty for the style."
"Taste is nice as well, but the funk that was slightly noticeable in the aroma isn't there. Medium sour, with some lemon and lime citrus. Nice and light bodied. High carbonation that is nice for the style. Solid brew, very enjoyable."
"Golden with a bit of red, slight carbonation. Sour all the way through. Sour fruit nose. Good acidity up front with a bit of bite. Acidity mild, but noticeable. Tart middle and finish. Light mouthfeel. Very drinkable, the balance between the tartness and fruitiness make this a very enjoyable drink."
"Overall, I'm not surprised that my best friend has been getting heavily into this style of beer lately, but I think I'll stick with my IPAs, ryes and saisons."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer if this was something that was easier to get I be drinking this semi regularly this beer is worth finding to try"
"Solid gueuze. sharp on the tongue and interesting."
"D: A thorough pleasant gueuze. Certainly doesn't have the complexity and depth of the better gueuzes, but there are no off flavors or characteristics that might make a beer unenjoyable."
"Poured a hazy tan with a big head which died down pretty quickly. Personally I don't taste the sour lemon or other fruit flavors other reviewers stated. Instead what the smell and taste both remind me of is way undercooked hamburger. Seriously. I don't doubt this is probably an excellent example of a Gueuze Lambic, but it just doesn't do it for me."
"D - Very refreshing and drinkable, and quite refreshing if sours are your thing. Other than the cider, though, there's nothing in the smell or taste to make this stand out as any other than a good, classic lambic."
"i must say the balanced quality of this gueze was exceptional. a darker pour of cloudy orange. some nice head that stuck around for a bit. this was a milder sour gueze. a nice sour backed with oak that gives it an earthy blend. earth is backed wtih a pollen floral and a honey mild. that isn't over powering sweet but mellowing. very nice dimension. great form."
"D - Very drinkable. As a fan of sourness the pleasant dryness of this geueze leaves me craving the next sip."
"A very nice surprise."
"D: highly drinkable, especially for the ABV"
"almost too sour, so can't have a super high drinkability, but its a very nice example of the style."
"Really trying to get into sours, figured this would be an approach. But not to crap on this just because it's style, I will base this on the style. It poures a deep orange, with a sparsely bubbly head. Taste was pretty much on the money with the large sourness flavor, lemonheads but no sweetness, prety mouth puckering. Actually found this to be pretty drinkable, but just not for me."
"Drinkability -- Overall, not bad. A bit par for the course, but still quite refreshing."
"Don't drink and review."
"I'm drinking this bottle at Grinder's, a restaurant in Kansas City. I ordered a Cantillon Guezue off of their beer menu. I was brought this bottle, which wasn't on the menu, instead. I hadn't tried it before or even seen it on store shelves in the area, so I decided to say nothing to my server and drink it. While it pales in comparison to the astounding offering from Cantillon, this is a damn good guezue on its own right. Definitely try it."
"D= Very drinkable, very refreshing gueuze here. I could easily drink multiple glasses of this in a sitting."
"12.7 FL. OZ. bottle served in my Allagash chalice at 50 degrees. Poured an exquisite muted golden-orange with a fizzy, two inch cream-colored head that sizzled and popped and quickly receded into a quarter inch cap. Copious tiny bubbles effervesced in solution and adhered to the sides of the glass; no lacing. Nose reveals tart citrus, a hint of cork, and some light fruit. Taste follows nose; however, the tartness and citrus somewhat cancels out the light fruity esters. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a lively carbonation and a fairly dry finish. A very solid gueuze. Not overly tart; however, having just had this on-draft, I think it is far superior in the bottle."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice sour beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D- A very tart but enjoyable beer to sip on."
"D - very much enjoyed this one. nice and tart/sour fruit and lacto balance with just a kiss of Brett funk. will seek it out again for sure to meet my sour cravings."
"D: Takes a bit to acclimate to the tartness (at least for those just getting in to lambics, geueze's and wild's) but once you do, it is rather tasty, refreshing and worked nicely for a warm New England day."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color gueuze with a large frothy head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light acidic green apples with some subtle oak notes is better then I had anticipated. Taste is overall quite tart with a nice touch of granny smith acidity which provide a great refreshing factor. Oak is somewhat subtle with limited amount of funky ester. Body is quite full for style with great carbonation. I was expecting a sweeter version of gueuze based on what I tasted previously from this brewer but I must admit to being pleasantly surprised."
"Draft at Toronado. Nice dark amber color with a small white cap, a few shades darker than the average gueuze. The aroma is interesting, big apple cider character along with a bit of orange juice, vinegar and pale malt. Very little bretty funk. Pretty similar on the palate, very cidery and acetic, oranges and pears, light tannins and a hint of malt. Decently complex but quite acetic for a gueuze, almost just tastes like a stale apple cider. Not terrible, but I can't say that I'm a fan."
"Overall, the sour is great, aroma very intense, good carbonation. I'll get this again at George Keeley's If it's still there on my next visit."
"I could use a bit more carbonation, but just a bit. Other than that it was a nice sour that really hit the spot tonight."
"Overall Impression: A real tart, thirst quencher. It stays Funkaliscious from beginning to end. This is an acquired taste, one that I have acquired :D"
"D - I really enjoyed this and I find the drinkability high for the style. However, the style itself carries a below average drinkability in my opinion."
"Pours a clear peach color with a moderately dissipating thick chunk o' white foamy head. The nose is quite sour, with generous amounts of funk, lemon, cardamom, and lime. The taste follows pretty closely, but leans more toward the lemony/limey side of citrus. Indeed, healthy doses of lemon zest, cardamom, and green apple, along with a very subtle hint of wheat. The moderate body and carbonation and light bubbly feel make for a fairly drinkable brew."
"D: A decent gueuze that's easy to find, but nothing all that special. I would stick with Cantillon, Hanssens, or Girardin over this one."
"The mouthfeel is light, and effervescent. Overall, a balanced beer with some excellent qualities to it. The only thing that I didn't really like was the metal or something at the back-end of the taste. A good example of the style."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Alive and prickly, the aggressively effervescent texture keeps the intensely dry, tart character moving. Of the Castle Brewery offerings I've sampled thus far, I crown this beer king."
"Opinion: Well, this may sound a bit silly, but this is actually a pretty ""tame"" lambic by definition. Though it has the acidity, the rest of the beer subtly plays with your senses rather than picking them and smacking them around. If you are not sure if you would like a lambic beer, I would give this one a shot to see if you are compatible. If you feel yourself (like I do) wishing that your palate took a bit more punishment, I would go for the Cantillon. If you think that this is a bit much, you may want to stick to the Lindemans. Either way, this is a respectable beer and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
"Drinkability: A very good medium level sour. I like the apple/lemon flavor. I could drink all day and had a few on tap at Julian's Providence."
"Poured a corked and caged 12.7oz bottle into my oversized Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a traditional burnt orange with a two inch off white creamy head that leaves little to no lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is traditional gueuze. There is a nice lactic twang in the nose with tannic oak, green apple skins and good old fashion funk. Coming from the brewery that produces all the crap that St. Louis does, I expect much more sweetness out of the nose. While there is a hint of malt sweetness, I'm very surprised. The flavor is much the same with a traditional lactic quality that lends itself to grapefruit pith, grape skins, green apples, and lemon zest. There is just a hint of residual sweetness that follows and it really isn't as flavorful as I thought it was going to be. The mouthfeel is not as dry as I would have liked. The small amount of residual sugars makes it just a bit too sweet. I like my gueuze's bone dry. Over all, I'm really surprised with the quality of this beer. I really bought it because I thought it was going to be a horrible example of the style by a brewery that is known for bastardizing Belgian styles but they did a pretty good job."
"The palate opens witha combination of citrus sweet and sour flavors with a definite balsalmic vinegar character, Some sweetness is noticeable too, the mid-palate is mildly water, but the finish is long, drying and has a lemony tartness. The funk character is quite low, this light-bodied beer has a medium-high level of carbonation. Quite drinkable, this is a good, cheap gueuze."
"91+/100 points"
"drinkability is nice. seems pretty well balanced, not overly acidic or sour but fairly representative of the style. the metallic and higher alcohol characters definitely take away from it, and i'd have liked a little more depth, but not bad overall."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, pretty satisfying and easy to drink. Much better than the usual swill St. Louis is responsible for. A pretty solid and relatively cheap gueuze."
"This is a definite funk lover's dream, it isn't too bad but not amazing, some aspects of it are a bit too rough and unrefined, it isn't as smooth or drinkable as some of the others in the category."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body with ultra-fine carbonation."
"Slightly puckering up front with a subtle barnyard funk character that is not too overpowering or acidic. Very light with a lot of crisp golden fruit, especially apple and pear and slight earthy tartness. Not overly sour and very quaffable. This is well balanced with a nice blend of lambics making it pretty easy to put down. I drank this very quickly and while it was very refreshing I wished that it was a bit funkier and a lot more sour."
"I had low expectations and this exceeded them. Drinkable and recommended for those interested in gueuzes but fear the shock of unbridled acidity and funk. Clean and refreshing. Nothing spectacular, but well done."
"This beer is a little bit of a one note wonder, but it does it so well. This is a great session beer for sure. It is sour and tart, finishes cleanly, a complete palate cleansing beer. No aftertaste, mouthfeel is between low and medium body, beer goes down quick and simply. Drinkability really high. I enjoyed the simplicity and flavor of this beer."
"D- Not so bad. It tastes good... and it's quite sessionable, but the lack of finish makes it less interesting for me."
"D: F all those who don't like it, I think it is a great Gueuze."
"TASTE: Never before have I sipped something so mouth-rackingly tart and tangy! An out of control puckering assault that's totally fun! Not so much funkiness, just sweet and wonderful full, rounded tanginess. Clean, fruity acidity."
"D - Easy to drink, average gueze."
"The ""Gatorade of Beer"" according to one of the tasting's panelists. Very refreshing for sure, like something you'd want to drink while playing half-assed backyard football. Not something I want to sit down and enjoy if I have other options, but I can't deny that the taste is still with me nearly two weeks after drinking, and it's a pleasant mirage."
"D: A nice gueuze, it doesn't have the complexity akin to a Cantillon or Boon, but it's a traditional version and a good stab at the style."
"drinkability is good. mellow and mildly sour with a wonderfully tart finish. a decent gueuze with a concentrated profile. cheers!"
"Mputhfeel/drinkability; medium bodied with a nice cleansing carbonation that works well with the tartness of the beer. With the slightly higher sweetness the drinkability is really good."
"For those who prefer a more straightforward gueuze, this is for you. It has a pale orange color, and a pleasant nose with an intense sourness. The taste, meanwhile, is mostly dominant by a soapy tasting vinegar sourness with canned pears syrup. Notes of apples skins and tart pears appear, though this gueuze doesn't transform itself into a brand new level of flavors, as say, a Cantillon. Still good to drink though, and a pleasant enough contrast with my BBQ brisket."
"Overall: solid authentic lambic. Not the best ever, but a good crisp natural tart flavor. The way they should be."
"Mouth is wet and bubbly, champagne like. Highly drinkable if you enjoy sours, but I imagine it can be grating after a glass or two."
"A very drinkable brew, but not anything I see myself craving, particularly when I'm looking for a bold gueuze. That said, it's a great introduction to the style (although if memory serves I actually preferred the equally accessible Lindemans Gueuze, although that was sweeter)."
"I will look forward to the opportunity to have this again. Very impressed."
"On tap at the Publick House on Brookline. Served in a small Corsendonk Xmas glass. Bright yellow color with a thin white head. Medium amount of carbonation. Smell was quite floral and peppery. Very tart taste, which was what I was expecting. Not very complex, but it was a straight forward fine gueuze. Since it was so tart, this is not a beer I'd drink all night, but it went fine with the cuisine at the Publick House."
"D: Yes, this was especially drinkable, especially in Hopleaf's beer garden."
"Taste is nice mix of sweet and sour, a nice tasty Gueze."
"HV"
"Aroma is sharp and bitter and sour, as hoped for. Flavor follows suit, with green apples, vinegary salad dressing, and all the wonderful oddities that make a gueuze/lambic such a wonderful surprise. Not nearly as out there sharp/harsh as Cantillon, so it's a little more accessible. Not nearly as balanced as my favorite Oud Beersel, but still a decent gueuze, and when it's the only one I can easily get, it's a decent choice!"
"D- Low in alcohol and high in taste. It's a gueuze so it is not the most sessionable brew out there(with all the acidity, a few of these would do damage to the stomach) but I could down a few of these easily, if I had some tums nearby. Glad I got to try this on tap after passing it up in the bottle for years."
"It's pretty humid out today this beer is really hitting the spot. I'll probably grab another after this and move on to something else before I leave."
"This is certainly a nice treat on a hot summer day. Grab a hunk of fatty soft ripened cheese and go at it."
"D- Definitely a sipper, though the dry finish makes it pretty quaffable."
"Overall this is a beer that's on the sweet side of gueuzes but without adding too much sweetness. Definitely worth a shot."
"375ml bottle thanks to Ding. Crown but no cork. Hazy orange color and a ring of bubbles around the perimeter. Smells like gueze, sour, wheat, fruity pebbles. Taste is fleetingly sour, weird, lemony, ok but not my favorite gueuze. There is just something odd about this one that I can't put my finger on."
"I enjoy the occasional sour ale and this is definitely an acquired taste. It's still quite easy to drink and if you can get past the funkiness of it, you should be able to enjoy it."
"Drinkability- I found this pretty darn drinkable for the style. It's not a style that I drink a lot of of, but I could really enjoy a couple glasses of this in the summer when it gets hotter."
"Notes: A great introduction to what gueuze should taste like. Not the most textured example, but a really tasty beer for the price. Needs food and beginners should prepare themselves for how sour this beer is."
"""Have to wait a bit. I just met her. And besides, I've broken enough hearts and mine already..."""
"D: An almost sessionable sour. Very good taste and classic presentation. I would find this a nice second or third step into sour beer for those just getting started. Or seasoned sour beer drinkers may find this one as a welcomed change of pace from some of today's extreme sour offering. Overall, a nice beer, but nothing to rant and rave about. Good stuff. Glad I got to try it."
"D = This is an easy drinking geueze, could easily drink another of these even with the sour quotient."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style traditional Gueuze."
"I really liked this one. It looks like slightly dark champagne, some head, some lacing, yellow-golden liquid. The smell is very much like a white wine with vinous and acidic qualities. There are also some sweet lemon notes in the nose. The flavor is complex and wonderful. It is tart, faintly yogurty with a dry, oaky finish. There are also notes of green apple and lime. It has a full feel with a nice pucker. A delicious beer."
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"I enjoy this style but one is enough per sitting. I found this to be quite enjoyable and I would definitely seek it out again."
"D: This comes fairly close to being a hit. It looks fine, smells alright, and feels great... but there's just something a little off in the taste - at least to my palate - and that's where it really counts. It DOES seem to improve with a little time out of the bottle. Good effort, nonetheless, and I'd be happy to try it again."
"Pours a pale, hazy, golden with a fairly faint head that settles to a ring. Smells acetic and funky with some lemon, sour orange, barnyard, and some hay notes at the end. The taste is still quite sour, but a bit simpler, mostly losing the funky notes and concentrating on lemon, clean hay, and a bit of medicinal, almost band-aid flavor, but luckily not quite that far. Decent. Sharp in the mouth at first, but it lightens up and even becomes a bit creamy at the end. At least this beer tastes real and isn't loaded with sugar like so many of their beers. Not bad at all."
"A good and refreshing lambic. A little pricey to drink regularly, unfortunately."
"A bit pricey, but good."
"Not much of the funk, but quite tart and impressive. Good gueueze."
"2009: Trying this again at home, there's a definite acetic flavor in this, reminiscent of horseradish mustard, the seeded kind, not the yellow hot dog stuff. Huge puffy head. Almost a barnacled sea plank saltiness too...strange. Not so puckering, a manageable introductory Gueuze."
"This beer is well-carbonated but not roughly so. Finish is pretty dry, leaving just a bit of stickiness as the mouth attempts to recover from the acidity. Drinkability is pretty high but overall it lacks some complexity."
"not the most complex, but certainly drinkable. price was cheaper than several of the other gueuzes. overall score bumped up a half point since the taste score should be a tad higher than 3.5."
"33cL green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an amber-red body with about an inch of off-white head. Smells slightly fruity (banana?) with a fair bit of sour/acidity thrown in. Tastes somewhat fruity (lemon?) balanced with a fair bit of sourness. Not particularly complex, but subtle and balanced. Not a bad beer, but not what I'll be going to for a sour fix."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy yellow orange with stark white head that lingers around the edges for some time. Nose is geueze, horse blankety funk and some tart. suprise suprise taste follows. A ton of horse blanket and lovely tart flavor. A good unique taste that I can't quite describe through the middle, that I have not found in other geueze. Mouthfeel is excellent, and drinkability is quite good for the style. One I would revisit, but I will take some others before this. Defenitely a good one tho."
"Not a style I have learned to appreciate yet (hence my ""average"" drinkability rating), but there's no denying that this is a well-crafted beer that probably turned out exactly as intended."
"This was a suprisingly good gueuze, and it paired my beer mussels amazingly well."
"This is actually much better than I was expecting, I was expecting something that was at least leaning towards sweet (it has some residual sweetness (but only a faint hint, when compared to a perhaps more traditional Gueuze) &/or fake. This could certainly use a bit more funkiness as it is a bit on the soft side in this department."
"Recommended (though Im told there are much better examples of the style)"
"Drinkability: Impressive from the outset! Very distinctive and enjoyable."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden amber brew. Head lasts nicely, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is tart, slight but apparent funk. Taste is dominantly tart, with light fruitiness, and enough undercurrent of malt to cut the sour a bit. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is quite good. Makes a nice palate-cleanser to me as well. Good stuff."
"I long for more bubbles"
"Mouthfeel is of sour chery, mouthpuckering wildness in a slick medium body."
"Poured a clear, pale gold, straw-like color. Thin head with good carbonation. Aroma was mostly sour/tart and acidic with some apple-like fruitiness. Taste followed smell very closely, with tart, acidic flavor upfront with some mild sweetness. Dry and acidic mouthfeel and light-bodied. Very drinkable."
"37.5 cl, corked and bailed bottle. Purchased at OUAV in Richmond for $6."
"The carbonation is velvety. Highly enjoyable."
"Tried at Oud Arsenal in Antwerp. Appearance: very clear, orange color, big head, which fades rapidly. Aroma: Very sour, not much almondy or bret aromas which are usually present in Gueuze. Flavor: Bret is much more noticeable in flavor, very sweet, but also quite tart. Finish: Finish is very harsh, with lots of bret. Leaves an odd aftertaste, which mars the drinkability."
"If I can find another of these, I'll have to try it again to see if the unusually low carbonation was an anomoly or not."
"Pretty good lambic, sour, tart and dry as they should be, but it is not too overwhelming and is a little less complicated than the better examples. There standard gueuze was way to sweet, this was nicely dry with some traditional lambic stinkyness and grassy citrus and wood flavours, close to the real thing i think, very appetising."
