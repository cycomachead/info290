"There is even greater depth in the flavor. Bright lemon mixes with a mineral background. Again restrained funk, but full flavored tart acidity. Lactic acid mostly, with a very mild and restrained hint of acetic. Light effervescent mouthfeel. Very well done."

"330ml bottle poured into tulip during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood Seal Beach. Yellow-orange hazy body with tall fizzy white head that settles to a film. Aroma is tart grapes, sour apple, wet grass, barnyard, wood, and a touch of tropical/citrus sweetness. Taste is moderately tart with the green apple and sour grapes carrying the way. There is a good level of funky yeast and a touch of both woody bitterness and powdered sugar sweetness. Light body, thin texture, high carbonation, tart dry finish."

"Overall: For a special occasion, this beer is very rewarding. I'd drink this every day with lunch if I were a rich man!"

"Gotta try a different kind. Definetly!"

"A little to tart for my liking but a wonderful gueze"

"From a bottle, date of April 2010. Enjoyable beer, just not my style. One of the better sours I've had."

""
""
""
""
"This is what gueuze is at its finest. Blended to perfection and still kickin' after all this time. More earthy than I would have expected, but a very pleasant drinker. Here's to 2015!"
"A really good expression of the style.  Excellent."
""
"Just not my kind of beer.  Way too sour for my taste."
""
"Bottle from 2012, pours clear yellow with white head. aroma is funky hay and grass with a light sharpness.  Taste is mineral funky and sharp tart finish, excellent"

"O: 4.5 This is such a bright, flavorful beer with a lot going on. It’s actually quite exciting drinking this as it seems like each sip brings a new flavor. The age from the older beer in the blend also really comes through, tasting old and funky in the best possible way."

"T - Much more dry than sour. This is probably the closest thing to classic Cantillon I've had. It's similar to the aroma. Sweet and dry apples seem to be the forefront. Followed by a grainy lemon tartness."

"Overall - Super refreshing and a lot of citrus sourness going on.  Not as much lactic flavour as some of the other in the style and there is a lot of vibrant citric acid.  A beer worthy of its acclaim."

""
"I am pretty sure this is my favorite beer on the planet."

"Golden blonde colour, 1.5 fingers of white head, little in the way of lace. Smell is funky, acidic fruits, lemon and green apple, musty citrus underlying, oaky barnyard closer. Taste is sour upfront with a bit of lactic-cheese flavour like in the girardin white label though not as strong, funky musty fruits, lemony with a dry oak finish. Medium carbonation, dry, medium feel. Solid stuff, tasty and worthy of being a top tier offering of the style."
"TOTAL - 43/50"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D: overall a really fantastic gueuze. I can see why this is considered a benchmark for the style. that very classic, big barn yard aroma and flavor is all over this one and I like it."

"Glass fills with foam, loads of beads of carbonation stuck in a nice gold body, very effervescent. Smell is tannic, apples and herbs. Nice mix of sweet and tart in the flavor, apple peelings and sour apples also. Very much enjoyed this treat."
"O: This is one of the easiest to drink beers in the style and is extremely enjoyable - probably one of the best ones I have had the opportunity to experience. Good flavors/aromas and sourness/tartness without being overpowering."

"Overall: This is a really great beer that I am glad I gave a 1.5 years in the bottle. It is right up there in the top two or three guezes I have tasted. Very complex and makes it very difficult pick out individual flavors."

"I had this blind against Tilquin and this clearly won for its zesty fruit qualities and complexity with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful Aroma coming off the top. Let the beer do its thing and then shortly after poured into a snifter. Tart cherries, barnyard, hay, and spicy yeast on the nose. Taste of spicy yeast and horse blanket. Nice dry finish that really leaves your palate unscathed."
"Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is very smooth with very little viscosity. The beer moves from puckering to mouthwatering to tart very smoothly."
""
"Overall: AMAZING beer. far better than Tilquin and Boon's Geuzes."
""
"O- one of the best Gueuze that I've had, it's packed with puckering flavor and keeps you wanting more"

"This is far more funky and earthy than the Golden Blend I tried the other day, and it hurts the brew. It's a very good Lambic overall, but simply not as special, and not as good. Off of one bottle, I have to say this rates with a typical Geuze or Gose, instead of standing out as something particularly special."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all top stuff, top gueze.... Maybe I just need to do a massive a - b taste comparison to start understanding the subtleties that set this apart from, say, Cantillon. Maybe less sour? Hmmm"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"GREAT!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Gosh, do I enjoy this more than Cantillon gueuze? I think I might."
""
""
"Pounded light orange with a big bubbly white three finger head that lingers for quite a while. Smell is funky, barnyard, some lemon, earthy. Taste starts with a nice citrus note, sour up front that fades to some slight sweetness, dry, dirty, some apple, some vedgtable notes, oak. This is fantastic, lot of carbonation but still great texture, just the right amount of funk and sourness. I can see why this is a gold standard."

"Again, just not my cup of tea (generally), but even so, this was pretty tasty and impressive. Thanks Brendan!"

"O: Really delicious stuf. Not among my all time favorite sours, but perhaps my favorite gueuze."
""
""
"O - Overall, a very tasty beer. Love the funk on the nose and all the tartness on the palate. The dryness reminds me of big cabs and i love it. Would recommend more years in the cellar though. The store i got it from has a bunch more so i think i am going to get four or five and age them for a while. But good now too if you're wondering."

"Not that easy to find in Australia, especially in regional areas, so a rare treat."
"Overall either this bottle is bad or these things taste like shit fresh. I'll try and get another to lie down for a few years to find out, but this experience wasn't worth anything near the $13 I paid for it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium to light bodied with a fine carbonation. This one exceeded my expectations!"
""
""
""
"O: As my first true lambic/Gueuze this is incredible. The smells and flavors of this beer are big and tart but at the same time have a wonderful drinkability. There is a lot of flavors that round out the tartness and really make this a wonderful beer."
"O: For whatever reason, this bottle was flat. I've had this beer many times and never found it to be like this. My score reflects the undesirable quality in this sample, but I'll say that this is easily one of my favorite sours under normal circumstances. Some of the other more highly rated geuzes out there are far more sharp and sour. This one showcases a perfect balance between funk, sour, and malt sweetness, with a touch of oak thrown in for good measure. Tannins are there, but play more softly on the palate than most do. A must-try beer."

"Pours a hazy grapefruit orange color with a fair amount of egg shell head that faded fairly quickly. No legs and light lacing. Good thin collar. Aroma is very much like when I would march in my highschool homecoming parade and the floats were all covered in straw. I also pick up some lemon and grapefruit. The flavor provile is very citrusy tart up front, then some dry grass. Nice silty mouthfeel, very dry, and that tartness stings the tongue. Very glad I got to try this, but I wouldn't put it in my top 5, maybe not in the top 10."

"Basically, this held up quite well against the Seasons, although this is obviously not on the same level as Zomer. I might actually enjoy this more than Winter, though. It's crisp, refreshing, lemony with some funk but not so much that it dominates the beer. For the price-quantity-rarity triangle, I can agree that this is the best value although its worth going after the Seasons to try at least once. Stock up on this, drink some and age some- it's probably the best shelf geuze out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer smelled great, but it was not nearly as potent as the seasons. Nose and flavor was a tad funky and had the nice Drie Fonteinen citrus notes that I love. A lot of fun to drink, and exponentially improved as it warmed. To be sure, this is an affordable and relatively accessible beer, making it a contender for the ""everyday gueuze"" category. However, when it was compared with the big boys, this really fell short. Although I would have never realized this if I were not doing a side by side, this beer is better than Golden Blend IMO. An excellent all around beer, and a notch above the Cantillon Classic."

"Sour Sunday here we go. Have been enjoying, lately, big sours watching Sunday football games on TV. This Oude Geuze does not disappoint. Not as sour as I was thinking it might have been. Extremely drinkable and a pleasure to sip on. Class act!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is really good. Well worth the trade, I'm glad I could get some of this. I'd love to compare it to the other world class Gueuzes, I still haven't had Cantillon's for example."
""
""
"definitely worth checking out, and definitely going to remember to order more next time!"
""
"A perfect rough gueuze, (almost) immaculate 5."
""
"Overall - I am not really a geuze kind of guy, but I can recognize a beer that is well done. This is well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A funky party. This one is bolder than Cantillon, while the latter is more elegant. So depends on what mood you are on, but it may be a notch above the other."

"O this is a tart beer. The sweetness on the back really made this beer for me. The tart flavors were enjoyable but the sweet finish helped to balance it out nicely."

"M - Medium body. Dry. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""

"Prost!"

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy gold with three fingers of fluffy white head that grew higher as it sat. Quite nice. Scents of sour green apple, lemon juice, barnyard funk, white wine, lactic sour, hints of pear, very faint hints of bubblegum, touches of oak, slight yeasty funk, funk-notes become more assertive as the beer warms, and as it warms further a bit of honey comes through. Very nice, deep, complex, sour and appetizing with a range of scents. Flavor begins with a massive hit of sour, lemon juice, crab apple, a bit of funky musty flavors, some vinegar notes, some slight hits of lemon rind, quite acidic, a tiny hit of herbal bitterness and oak as the sip finishes, extremely dry finish. The beer showcases sourness over all else, the fruit on the nose is not all that present in the taste. It's certainly a very, very sour beer, well blended with an excellent character for those who love sours. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate level of carbonation, a very drying finish and a puckering sourness. Refreshing, tart, and drying, making you want to take sip after sip. Overall this is an excellent geuze. It's a bit single note, not incredibly complex in it's flavor, but the flavor is good. A nice lively sour that puckers the mouth and works with the mouthfeel to make a wonderfully refreshing beer. Highly recommended."

""
""
"O) One hell of a beer. Very enjoyable and tart, and ultimately a highly recommended beer for anyone a fan of sours."
""
""
""
""
"O-Definitely need to let this beer warm up to room temperature. Maybe age will move more of the funk from the nose to the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"- Overall this beer is top notch. Lactic sour funk that is well balanced and leaves you wanting more, my glass was empty in no time."

"375 ml Bottle from Tipples. Pours a light orange yellow, slightly hazy, with a big fluffy bubbly white head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom like champagne. Aroma is a very dry sour, green apple, vinegar, oak, earthy grass. Big sour up front with lots of dry oak and champagne like flavor, some green apple, lemon, maybe even a hint of super tart cherry. Then a second wave of pucker. Definite dry lingering must on the back end. Light and bubbly dancing in your mouth."
""
"O: It lives up to the hype. Great geuze. Recommended!"
"I am rating the 1999 ed mainly because I like to score a beer the highest mark that I have ever given it, even if I have had multiple samples that are inferior. I feel it is unfair to average out all of my scores for special lambics like this. I've had dozens of normal 3F Geuze bottles, but the 1999 is by far the best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is dry but thick. Overall, quite good, but probably won't spend the money again."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much everything I'd want from the style. terrific beer. consumed the glass over the course of an hour or so, and have enjoyed it changing with the temperature. will be buying again."
""
""
""
"It's taken me way the hell too long to finally get a crack at this stuff. Just sayin'. It pours a slightly murky gold topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white froth. The nose comprises lemon zest, lime zest, apricot, light sour pineapple, very light cracked wheat, and a more-than-healthy helping of Brett-like funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tarter fruit notes covered o'er by a thick pall of musty funk (or is it funky must?), creating a deeply-layered liquid cake of complexity. At any given moment, you can get some sour lemon, some Swiss-esque cheese, some straight cobweb funky magic, or grass-flowers. Sometimes, all of it will come at you at once; those are the great times. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine gueuze, one that deserves the reputation it commands."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very good to great beer but I think I'd have to go with Tilquin or Cantillon overall. I might, however, choose this one for the ease of drink. It is certainly worth a try."
""
""
"O: A classic in every sense. Hard to find any faults, and I’m going to enjoy the development of this particular vintage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have a couple of cases of this and look forward to trying another next year."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Worth the $20 750ml. I drank this beer very young. I may need to grab another and throw her in the cellar. Just a very earthy, natural medley of flavors."
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Pucker up! this one is sour."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, sour and honestly a good example, if not one of the top Geuzes readily available in my area. Will buy again an recommend to any one who is curious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Once again I'm extremely joyous to be drinking a Drie Fonteinen. And though this may have developed some off flavors due to the room temp aging, surprisingly they don't take away from the beer but add more cheesy funk which is quite welcome. It's the beauty of lambics, enjoying their longevity and the transformations that occur in it's duration."

"On an unusually cool July day, this is perfect. The scent is barnyard funky. Taste is tart and bright with an incredibly dry finish. I know that most think of this as an ideal summer beer, but for me it's the perfect Autumn drink. Highly recommended for a lazy Sunday wishing that football had already started."

"A: Extreme head off a mild pour – looks like sea foam as it settles, no lacing, light golden in color with a hint of peach, a little hazy – 4.00, S: Extremely tart nose with signs of lemon and vinegar, I also smell what reminds me of paint thinner and grapefruit zest, dead-on for the style – 4.50, T: Sourness plus that skirts on the side of puckering, quite medicinal and with tons of vinegar, other flavor remind me of green apples and grass, quite funky all-around – 4.25, M: Light and crisp mouthfeel – 4.00, D: I can’t claim to be an expert of the style, but from what I do know about Gueze this hits the bulls eye, very drinkable – 4.25"
""
"Overall, terrific."

"Overall it's a great beer! The aroma and the taste contrast each other in this beer. What I smelled didn't exactly seem to match what the beer tasted like - as opposed to for example the smell and taste of an apple coming together. They both were completely different experiences in this beer. Awesome beer, it was great to share and talk about with a friend. I recommend it and definitely share with someone. Hope to try this again someday."

"Served in a snifter. Pours a slightly hazy, dark golden with a quickly dissipating white head. Aroma of funk and lemon zest. Very sour taste, not much sweetness. Finishes dry. Gets more complex as it warms in the glass. Light mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted geuze."

"Appearance is hazy golden orange with bright white foam that dissipates rapidly. Smell is of lemon and funk. Diaper funk. A touch metallic. Not overpowering in the aroma department. Flavor is delicious funk, a little bit of sweetness, and moderate acidity. Some lemon rind and nectarine. The sour lingers more than the Tilquin that im drinking side by side. Would like some more bubbles but the lower level of carb is probably true to style. A delicious gueuze."

"This one was bottled 18 months ago. Cork comes easy with a huge plop! Lots of carbonation creates a unstable white foam and a clear orange body. Smells is funk and horse blanket, citric, apricot. Taste is sourness, funk, leathery, some fruitiness. Very spritzy and light on the tongue. Nice and refreshing. I had this before and liked it, but this time it really knocked it out of the ballpark. The age has done it really well. Really not too sour and this great carbonation. I consider myself lucky to pick up something like this any time I want."

"O - I don't know how much bottles of this go for in the States, but I'd pick it up again for sure."

"A bottle at a small watering hole in Bruges. This beer is dark yellow in color with lots of lively carbonation. Aroma and taste is similar. Typical Belgian geuze. Funky, leathery, tobacco leaf with a very dry finish. Easy to drink. Sour. Just a notch below Cantillon's version for overall funk and sour complexity."
""

"O: an absolutely fantastic Geuze. good sourness, decent complexity and the wild fermentation has done a number on this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent, readily available gueuze. The level of sourness really hits the spot, but the barrel character is very light."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really good gueuze. This is one of the classics for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"After having many, many more bottles of this, the variation is lovely. Sometimes it's much funkier, sometimes it's much more tart, but it's always delicious. I still think I prefer Cantillon's original gueuze to this one, but hey - I can still find this stuff on the shelves occasionally... win!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: my first gueuze, so I'm trying to play it cool here, but based on what I've heard and read, this is a pretty damn good example of the style - I have been leery of the sour beer for quite some time now, but this was delightful."
""
""
"Overall: A top-notch gueuze. Much more of a refined citrus and balanced malt profile than some of the funkier lambics. Something you could drink for hours and keep discovering something new about it."
""
"Overall this is an incredibly complex beer and I personally think it takes a whole 330ml bottle to fully process its complexity. A fantastic guezue."
""
""
"O: THE classic sour beer. This is definately a starting off point for someone who wants to try what a sour should be. I enjoy this beer frequently."

"O: Enjoyable and refreshing but hard to find at a decent price. I'm glad I tryed it but no where near as complex as I was hoping. It was nice to have a Geuze that was devoid of the dreaded acetone/nail polish remover flavor(I'm looking at you Experimental Cassis)."
""
"O: Good beer. Worth trying at least once."
""
"O - Really a great Gueuze that is tart yet has a lot amount of earthy funk.it reminds me of a tarter and funkier version of Orval, which is a good thing. Lots of carbonation as well. Curious to see what aging does to this."

"A rather drinkable instance of the style, with a still healthy nod to the sassy elements that define the style - acid, funk, and um, jazz? Anyways, complex, sure, as the individual, often suspect flavours do well to come together and please a doubting palate. However, if you're looking for a wallop of that ol' acid and/or funk, maybe head on over to the Cantillon section, eh?"

"Solid geuze."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Probably my favorite gueuze that I have tried recently. Havent drank too many beers from this style, but I have been drinking my fair share of this beer style lately and this beer is the most memorable so far! I am becoming more of a fan of this style with every beer that I try."
""
"This is an excellent beer. I love sours and this is one of the better ones I've had. Thanks again to Douglasjamjak for this awesome extra!"
"Overall, it is clear why 3F and Cantillon are the heavyweights of the Belgian sour category. This is a terrific example of the style. I had this one fairly fresh and have another in the cellar. I'm very interested to see how this develops over the next decade or so."
"Thanks to a buddy for picking this up for me. 12 oz bottle pours a hazy golden orange with lots of head. Taste isn't overpowering sour, but just the right amount. Some lemon and apple go with the tart finish. Every mouthful, my tongue screams for me. So easy to drink. A delicious beer. Wish I had more access to these style of beers."
""
"Overall- Damn good gueze, but I like Tilquin better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice beer, better as it warms up."
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely very tasty, but this is a big, funky, sour beer. And not for the faint on heart or palate. Glad I have another one waiting."
"I still feel as if this is a new style to me. I have been sitting on several bottles of this particular beer from 3 different bottlings but, given its reputation, I wanted to try a few others first in order to educate my palate. I can see why this one is so highly regarded. The way the brewer makes such a sour beer so pleasant to drink is something of a magic trick."
""
"3F is at the top of the game. I know some prefer the intense sourness of Cantillon but this stuff is really, really good and nicely balanced on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a narrow second place finisher - and a damn close finish at that - but at the same token, this is the only one where I'd attempt to finish an entire large-format bottle solo. Refreshing, easy to drink, and challenging all at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another very good gueze. Taste is a little different from the mainline, but very interesting and drinkable nonetheless. I think this guy would stand out more on his own, but compared to his peers, he's just another tasty gueuze."
""
""
"O- My girlfriend described this as a ""chemically soaked warhead"" and I'm inclined to agree. I've had many sours before that I enjoy such as Rodenbach, Duchesse, Monk's Cafe Flemish and St. Louis Fond Tradition but this is way too much. And I thought Jolly Pumpkin's beers were insane... I understand that these beers are supposed to taste like this but the reason I give it such a low score is because of the ridiculous price tag of $13.99 for a 12.7 oz bottle which I understand to be not uncommon."
"Mouthfeel- Not searingly acidic nor bone dry. Medium-light body with lively carbonation. Sweet and sour finish. medium-low tannin plays a big role in this beer. Long funky aftertaste."
""
""
"O - I had a Cantillon Geuze side-by-side with this beer, and in my opinion, the Cantillion blew it away. I wish this beer was a bit more sour, funky, and carbonated. But, I would certainly like to get another to cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Try as I might, this style of brewing/bottling and blending still leaves me unimpressed somewhat. I want to embrace the idea of Lambic beers and Geuze but struggle to feel the wonderous excitment other 'beer geeks' get from having beers from this stable or other Lambic breweries."
""
""
"O: Such a great, balanced gueuze. The acidity is very mellow (at least in this vintage) compared to beers like Cantillon Classic or Tilquin, but it lets some great mineral and wheat character out."
""
""
""
""
"Its a Fonteinen-Geuze. My first Geuze, I believe. Ive often contemplated picking a bottle of this up, glad I finally got to try it."
""
"O: This is just an amazing beer. Pretty pricey for how small the bottle is, but the flavor really makes up for that. Very delicious"
""
""
"O- Best Geuze I have ever had. Have never had a Cantillon but I got one aging so who knows. But this is by far the best I have had to date."
"everything a gueuze should be. it pours a pale pale straw color, hazy, with an average white head with decent retention. the nose is stright lemon juice from concentrate, like the little green bottle in the fridge that i sometimes put on steamed spinach. it is acidic and tart, and light in both malt and hops. it taste equally fruity as the nose, with lemon being the predominant flavor. lots of acid, this is pretty puckery. no sweetness at all, like a raw lemonade or something. the feel is great, dry in the mouth, effervescent carbonation, and a lighter body. this is a sharing bottle though because of the acid content. its through the roof. still, a brilliant example of the style."
"Overall, wonderful beer. Nice qualities all around and a good example of the style. Enjoyed this immensely."
""
"O-a nice gueuze with great flavor and body"
""
"O: Overall, good but not great. Its not as sour as some other gueuze's I have had, it also didn't have the degree of flavor complexity that others do. I think the lack of carbonation hurt this one. That being said, I still really enjoyed it. I just wouldnt rush to purchase it again. One more thing, I really didnt get any of the funk/barnyard characters that others have said were so prominent in this beer. I am not docking it points on that though, as I tend to prefer the sour notes to the funk ones, just thought Id mention it though."
"O-This has served as my favorite standard gueuze for awhile now. It is the perfect balance between bright lactic acidity and funk. Cant wait to let these 750’s sit in a dark corner of the cellar for a couple years."
"I'm pretty stoked I still have a Golden Blend in the fridge, I want to learn more about funky brews and 3F is a great place to start"
"O - Wonderfully crisp and tart."
""
"Mouthfeel - smooth and easy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Damn it! Where the hell did that fruit fly come from? Get out of my beer!!!"
"Overall I think this was an absolute treat to have and I wish I could find it again. I'm sure this would continue to be great, if not improve, with more aging. If American Wilds, Flanders Reds, or Gueuzes have even slightly peaked your interest and you can get your hands on this, give it a try! I also have to say, damn it's nice to have a flavorful and complex beer that doesn't start to get me drunk after roughly 12oz."

"1000th review! 375 ml bottle with black foil into tulip glass, bottled 12/12/2009. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of huge tart apple, lemon, pear, grass, hay, leather, pepper, earth, oak, funk, and yeast spices. Amazing aromas with huge complexity and balance. Taste of big tart lemon, apple, grass, hay, pear, pepper, earth, oak, funk, and yeast spices. Fair amount of tartness and sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, grass, hay, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of flavors, with an excellent balance of sourness and sweetness. Fairly dry on the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly acidic, and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding gueuze! Awesome flavor complexity and balance; and nicely smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. Fantastic stuff."
""
"Managed to smell great in spite of lack of head, and definitely a well-blended geuze."
""
""
"O: Very disappointed with this beer. Too bad. I will stick with Cantillon, Lindeman's for my go-to gueuzes. 3/2/2/3.5/2 - 2.2"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As soon as i pulled back the cage around the cork without even touching the cork this pops like no other just like a champagne botle and it gushes out everywhere and when poured its a hazed golden hue which leaves a creamy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is sweaty socks,wet soil,lemon zest and freshly cut grass,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and rather creamy and on taste it tastes just abit young for a Gueuze so be good to age and i get hints of lemon zest,sunrise limes,mandarin,barnyard funk and finished with a herbal apple candy sourness and overall its nice but like i stated previously this is one to age cheers."
""
""
""
"O- I liked this, but it was only mediocre compared to some of the other geuzes that I've had. The Cantillon Classic Geuze I had right before this one definitely had less carbonation but a lot more flavor. I would try this again, but there are other geuzes that I'd take over this. Would love to try it with more age on it."
""
""
"Overall: Just an excellent gueuze. Maybe a bit more approachable for some as it is a combination of many clean, recognizable flavors rather than bizarre funkiness, however, its really tart."
"O: a very nice gueze, displaying a very nice blend that balances notes of oak and sour funk beautifully, really enjoy this one. Not overly sour, kinda just right, maybe a touch more tartness and I'd be in love."
"Edited Because I have now Tried more Spontaneous Geuze, and this one just absolutely Dwarves the others I have tried so far."
"Slightly hazy golden color with a huge fluffy bubbly white head that takes a while to fall. Huge lemon and tart fruit nose with lots of funk to fill in the ends. Bubbly tart fruity flavor with lemons and sour cherries coming to mind. Phenolic and funk in spades counter the sweet and tart fruit form every sip. Medium to light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sour tart bubbly mouthfeel. Very nice gueze with light tart fruit and lots of funk."
""
"Overall this is the definition of Gueuze. Better and better with each year of age. As with many I prefer the aroma to the overall flavor profile, but that is not saying it wasn't fantastic. Definitely worth seeking out and hiding from yourself for as long as humanly possible."
""
""
""
""
"All in all, this is a fine, beer, and better than many other gueuzes. The fact that it's widely available nowadays is a miracle of modern beer advocacy. That being said, is it still a mere shadow of Cantillon's wonder? Yup."
""
""
"M: Bone dry, crisp, dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Really fantastic and I enjoy it more then the Cantillon Oude Gueuze."
"Overall: It's a winner."
"O: All around a very solid and enjoyable beer! Armand does it again."
""
"A work in progress to appreciate the incredible complexity of geuze. Not sure why it’s called the champagne of Belgians, because fizz is the one thing missing. Otherwise, there’s a cornucopia of flavors in here that recombine in surprising ways to make me want to say silly things like a lemon and wine sauce for mussels. My awe includes a bit of confusion, but there’s no denying it’s a deep beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, the sweetness makes it more approachable than others, but I prefer much more pucker. I gotta say, regardless of how heralded a blender they are, it's not the most impressive geuze."
"a most barnyardy beer indeed. surprisingly high level of champagne-like carbonation on this straw colored gueuze. a little tingly as it goes down. my buddy david nailed it when he said horse blanket on the nose. funky, wild yeasty scents mingle with a bit of breadiness. tart and dry on the finish. goes great with epoisses."
""
"O: Very good"
"This is like drinking a barn at first. It's full of hay and sweat. Then other flavors and aromas come out. It's so complex. I'd say it's probably the most complex beer I've ever had. I described rye, acid, allspice, nuts, wheat, fruit. I mean, what else can come out of this thing? It was quite a ride and a treat. A special occasion beer if there ever was one."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is pretty soft, even with all of that visible carbonation. It smoothly delivers the waves of flavor here. Overall, this is a masterfully-blended bottle of gueuze. I still very much prefer Cantillon Classic Gueuze, but this is excellent."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Perfect Geuze!"
""
"The drinkability on this is crazy. It's very tasty, and not so sour that it becomes painful to drink. A great summer beer. On the whole I prefer the cantillon gueuze, but this is still excellent."
"O: Easily the best I've had of the style. Nearly perfect."
"375 ml bottle bottled 18 nov 2010. Pours a clear light amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is earthy with a mineral note. There is also lemon, apple, apricot, and a light mushroom note. The initial taste has a light sweetness with some lemon, earthy bretty funk, some apple, and hint of mushroom. The finish is dry and tart. Light body. medium carbonation. Quite dry overall."
"O- wow, this is fantastic stuff. Aged or not, this is fantastic"
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 04-26-2011)"
""
""
"O: One of my favorite beers of 2012, so far. This beer is so easy to find and is reasonably priced, which make it that much better. I've had several of the Armand 4, Boon, and Cantillon gueuzes, and to be honest, I think the Drie Fonteinen is probably the best for the money. Cantillon is better, but with it becoming so hard to find, 3F is definitely where it's at."
"O: Excellent Gueuze. I'm still learning on this style but excellent none the less."
"Very carbonated and fizzy, very earthy (soil) smelling. Tart, sharp, clean and quick. Extremely dry with muted and mellow flavors (not as vibrant and bright). Musty earthy potting soil dominates in a good way. Very very drinkable, a special treat, but I think I prefer this beer with less than 12 years of age on it."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with very high carbonation that foams this up immediately on the palate. Resultant mouthfeel is slightly prickly at first, then very quickly smooth and creamy. Finish is dry, from residual sugars, and also a slight bit sticky."
""
""
""
"It's hard to explain in words how perfectly executed this is. A perfect balance of everything that I typically look for in a geuze. I'm not sure what else to say... this beer is nearly perfect."
""
""
"Cost: $20 for a 750 ml bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"I am just starting to get into the gueuze style, and this is one of the best I've had yet."
"O: Another great gueuze, but I like it with a more more acidity to it. Would never pass it up though."
"O- A very nice gueuze, probably one of the best you can get in the US, this beer is very approachable and would make a nice intro the the style for anyone interested in sours. I might have scored this slightly higher, but drinking it alongside the Golden Blend really highlighted how much more complex the Golden Blend is. This is an excellent gueuze, but if you try this one and like it you really need to try the Golden Blend as well."
""
""
"A great geuze. I've yet to have one of the vintage or season geuzes, but this is always a winner."
"O: It just doesn't get much better than this. One of the best gueuzes in the world. Extremely drinkable."
""
"O: A very good gueuze overall. It has just the right amount of tart and sour characters--very present, but in small enough amounts that it's very refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"Of course one of the true standards is a great beer. 3F mouthfeel is always spot on. I generally prefer a little more sour and less bleu cheese, but this one is still great and glad I can occasionally find it on the shelves."
""
"OVERALL: As a sour newbie, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. Not overly sour by any means, so it is still very approachable for someone like myself. Beyond that, there is plenty of character and complexity here for any beer fan to appreciate. This was probably my favorite gueuze of the day. Thanks again for the christening gents. Good times!"
"I've had Guezes before this one and was aware what to look for, and thus far this beer is the best as far as getting the funkiness down. Good focus here."
""
"O: happy, but a bit surprised by this beer as it was more subtle than I would have imagined (for whatever reason), delicious, but I think I'll let my second bottle age a bit more, would definitely purchase again"
"O: This beer is really incredible. I have had it a few times before, but sitting down and reviewing it has really made me appreciate it much more. Essentially flawless, subtle, and complex. Not overly sour, not overly anything really. I need to pick up some more."
""
"Outstanding! Well balanced in all aspects. The aftertaste is prominent, long lasting mouth puckering tartness that is a perfect grand finale for such an exquisite beer. Also, the mouthfeel puts this beer over the top for me."
"Pours a beautiful light gold color with a tad of haze. A mostly white one finger head tops the beer and very quickly dissipates. Heavenly smells of tartness, sourness, and oak comprise a great nose. First sip for a second is kind of sweet, then like an avalanche a wave of puckering sourness hits. There is a great mix of flavor with the oak adding a balancing dimension. Still some slight sweetness through out. The tart finish stands out. Mouthfeel is top notch too as it is near perfectly carbonated. Damn good. Damn good."
""
""
"Overall: What a great beer. I've heard this beer talked up quite a bit and it did not disappoint. I was blown away by this beer and will have to track down more for sure."
"I wish the carbonation issues weren't present, I feel like this beer is only lacking in that one area. I will seek this out again for a new take."
""
""
""
""
"O - Excellent geuze. Must/funk presence is nice, and much more subtle than something like Hanssenns Oude Geuze (which I also really enjoy), leading to a more refreshing drinking experience than some other geuzes."
""
"Bottle to oversized snifter. Looks good; orange and opaque. Smells great; Very fruity with oak notes present. Tastes good too; a lighter, dry gueuze that is quite unique. Mouthfeel is good as well. Overall, a tasty gueuze - but pricy (as they generally are)."
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a good gueuze. I felt the nose was a bit lacking and could do without the strong yeast finish, but that crisp dry finish is a great quality. Stuff is really enjoyable, but, not my favourite."
"Overall, a very flavorful geuze."
"Classic benchmark quality gueuze."
""
""
"Overall: I will seek this beer out. A new favorite. Definitely want to try it with a lamb dish or seafood pasta. It drinks like a pinot noir when it's room temp, or like a gewurztraminer when chilled. YUM!"
""
"This was the second beer I tried from 3F and I was thoroughly impressed with this after trying their 2009 Kriek which was beyond godly."
"O: 4."

""
""
""
""
"All in all - was very impressed with this and pleased that is was in no way similar to the cantillon geuze i had the week prior."

"O: this is a fantastic geuze, tons of tartness with just the right amount of funk to pair with it"

"4, 5, 4.5, 5, 4.5"
"A top notch beer. I just wish I had semi-regular access to it for special occasions and such."

"Bottle dated May 2008."
""
"Overall: Solid overall, with a great depth. Looking for a little more tartness. Oak is a bit overpowering in the long run. Still, it's damn tasty."
""
"O - very interesting, tart and tasty"
"O: Great gueuze, wish I could drink this more often."
"This is unlike any Gueuze that I have encountered. It's a great sour, and it's pretty unique. This particular bottle seemed to be lacking carbonation, but it was still good."
""
"O: Overall it's a very nice geuze that's readily available and affordable. I would recommend it to someone who hasn't had it."
""
""
"This is my first chance to enjoy a real Belgain Geuze. It is pretty much what I wxpwcted and hope for. Funk and vinegar light fruit in the nose, like apricot and grapefruit. The brut style carbonation was spot on, like a good dry champange. Taste was solid, but not mind blowing. Russian River sours carry more complexity, which is really what we are looking for right? Great mouthfeel, it help counteract any distaste for the vinegar taste. Overall I would like top climb up the ladder of this brewery and try some Armand and the Kreik."

"Enjoyed a 2009 bottle into a Drie Fonteinen lambic glass. Looks dark gold to copper, head is white and medium, fizzy. Aroma is great earthy funk, peach, pear, sour and tart. The flavor follows suit with lots of citrus acid, fruity but dry, brett, oak. Grassy, field like, and super balanced geuze here. Reminds me of the Girardin a bit, super balanced and crisp, ridiculously drinkable."
""
"This is a wonderfully complex beer. It is layered, flavorful, refreshing , balanced and very drinkable."
"O - So much funk even George Clinton would be jealous, but the balance makes this exceptional. A great introductory geuze and it's easy to see why it's a favorite among lambic connoisseurs as well."
"Overal: I really enjoyed this beer. The taste is really tart from the get go but it levels off nicely. The carbonation is spot on."
""
""
"Opens with a nice pop and pours with a huge white billowy head. It recedes to about a centimeter of denser head. There is some foam that remains on the side of the glass, but not much. Bright and clear straw color. The carbonation is quite visible, lots of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is bitter lemon rind, and tart green apple, a bit of musty, mild oak, but not much. Flavor is really nice, light, refreshing, tart, apple, citrus rind, mildly horsey. Mouthfeel is extremely light, almost champagne like. Refreshing, light, dry, and effervescent. Overall this beer is outstanding. I really enjoy this gueuze, on par with if not better than cantillon."
""
"O: Absolutely impressed with this beer. Outstanding from start to finish. Glad I got to try it and will definitely grab more if possible."
""
""
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy, and has a really nice flavor to it. I could easily have a few glasses of this in a night. Overall, I thought it was a really nice beer, and a good empale of the style. I really enjoyed the funkiness and dryness that came in towards the back end of the flavor. I recommend trying this one out. I would buy it again."
""
""
"This beer was a treat to enjoy! Very crisp and refreshing beer with lots of great flavor. Can't wait to see how my other bottle evolves over time."
"O - For a sour it ain't so bad, it is just not my style. Maybe I will be a believer after tasting enough of these."
"O-Great beer, very well balanced. Truthfully, don't believe this is an amazing beer but believe it is perfectly balanced for how it should be. Do wish it was a bit cheaper though so I can drink more. Definitely worth the try"
"O - Been looking forward to trying this one for a while and it didn't disappoint. Seems like every aspect of this beer is near perfect. The folks at Fonteinen and convinced me to make the effort to seek out others in their line up. Highly recommended."
"o - overall, the smell is the show on this one and delights me. as i sipped the brew, i found myself digging the other aspects more, but the dryness is a bit much for me. i love the smooth middle tart before the dryness settles in. i look forward to exploring more in the style and nod my head to you drabmuh for the intro!"

"The beer pours a hazy golden color with two fingers of dense white foam. Minimal lacing. Smells of barnyard funk, lemon peel and wet hay. Taste starts out tart with big lemon notes. Musty wet horse blanket and oak round out the flavor profile. The finish is dry with a lingering tartness. The beer is medium bodied leaning toward full with a prickly level of carbonation. This has become one of my absolute favorites. Great tart, funky characteristics and an exquisitely dry finish. Recommended."

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a pleasure to drink and one sip follows another quite easily as one tries to sort out the complex components of the flavor. Its also quite nice to just pick up the glass and take a sniff or two of the aroma to try and sort it out as well. An appropriate combination of two words to describe this beer is “complex subtlety.” My overall impression of this beer is that this is clearly among the best. I’m certainly glad I’ve already had several other first rate guezes as I don’t think what I have learned from them helps me better appreciate the outstanding qualities of this beer."

"Verdict: Outstanding geuze. Wonderfully tart without being overly vinegary, bubbly like champagne and nice complex fruit and wood flavors. A must try."
""
"O: Though I miss the palate-gripping tartness of the Hanssens, and could definitely do with a little less dryness, this gueuze is a keeper. Good variety of classic flavors and aromas, as well as a nearly perfect body excluding the aforementioned dryness. Well worth seeking out."

"To me, this contains similar yeasty and bitter texture to Orval but has a lambic recipe that makes it far more different. It's not as sour as other gueuzes (see: Cantillon) but it is definitely a standout in sours in terms of balance and quality. This manages to have different shades of sourness, sweetness, bitterness and spiciness all at the same time! A wonderful beer – I will seek out more from this brewery in the future."

"overall - satisfactory."

"O: I was more excited and pleased by this beer at the outset than I was toward the end, especially considering my ill-advised final pour from the bottom of the bottle. Still, having had fruit lambics but never a gueuze, this was a cool experience. Whoever drank such a beer for the first time (long ago no doubt!) really wanted to cop a buzz. That could be taken wrong, but I just appreciate the wild, untamed, spoiled nature of this beer. Glad i got it. This is apparently about as young as you can get this stuff, so I inevitably will consider this sort of a baseline re: future lambic and gueuze explorations."

"Pours a honey color with a one finger white head. Very cloudy in appearance, with minimal lacing and carbonation. The smell is pretty amazing! Barnyard funk, spices, citrus, hay. Very complex, and very aromatic. Taste has the same profile as the nose, and is equally amazing. Amazing funk taste! Feel is tart, with great carbonation. Overall, an amazing beer!"

"Conclusion: As expected, this is an outstanding gueuze. I still favor Girardin 1884 Black label over this, and want to try them side by side at some point. I doubt I will ever be able to fully appreciate the complexity of this style, but I hope to deepen my understanding by drinking a lot more of it throughout my life!"
"A very tasty but not overwhelming Gueuze. Great for people who are trying to get into this style."

"O - I really like this one, I just think it was still a bit too young. I enjoyed how fruity it tasted but I prefer my gueuze to be a bit funkier. Still a great beer none the less."

"O: Easily the best Geuze that I've had. Everything blends nicely and nothing takes from the other. Truly amazing."
"Fantastic."
"O: Delicious gueuze. I'm glad I was able to find this at a local store and pick it up. Great combination of tart, sour and funk with just a hint of sweetness. Would like to have again."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, sour, yeasty, and somewhat fruity. In the taste, sour and tart, with a small sweet fruitiness that lingers all the way through. A sour bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry sweet tart like aftertaste. Sweet and sour, light body, quite fantastic."
"Poured from a 375 ml bottle dated Nov. 18, 2010 into my Stone IRS tulip. Got about of finger and a half of Champagne-esque head that dies quickly, but the ever-present bubbles remain. Golden hued body. Tart fruit on the nose, especially apple. Granny Smith in the house. Funky, but not full on barnyard. Probably drinking it a little young. Maybe some sour feet on the nose too. The hairs in my nose prickle. I'm in love. More of that tart unripe Granny Smith apple stuff going on on the palate. A funky bitter hop finish, along with some citrus peel bitterness. Very dry and Champagne-like as far the the mouthfeel goes. Little bubbles. Very little bubbles. Fan-effing-tastic. Love love love."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with prickly carbonation. Pretty good here. Overall, a great gueuze. Very sour, puckering and refreshing. Had this directly following a '04 Lou Pepe Gueuze, and definitely preferred this beer."
"O- really nice worth it if you are looking for the reald deal and style not many can do it better than this."
"O: This was good, but not as good as the Gueuze Tilquin. Balanced, but not as tasty. I was very surprised by the carbonation thing, and wanted a bit bigger flavor."
"O - Nice and refreshing. Highly drinkable. Enjoyed this one very much."
"Overall: This is just a splendid gueuze. With the flashes of flavor and elegant complexity, this is a beer I could enjoy over and over."
"This is an excellent geuze."
"O - To be honest, I was a bit disappointed by this given all the hype around this brewer. It's good- don't get me wrong- but just nowhere near as refreshing as others (namely Boon's two Oude Geuze varieties). At this price point, I would much rather have the Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait."
"O: A-. I really like this one, but maybe I just like a little more fruit backing to the tartness. Delicious work though."
"This is the gueuze that every other offering in the style should be measured against. Very complex, funky, and amply tart in the taste and smell with a classic gueuze mouthfeel. Incredibly ageable. Lacks a touch in the appearance though."
"M: great, very drinkable, easy on the tongue but has subdued gueuze finish, very mellow all-around"
"About like sipping a champagne, with the flavor of a white wine, and the body of a beer. Just good all-round."
"Pours a pale golden color with a decent size foam that dies down quickly but does provide some Belgian lace. Aroma is openly sour, white wine vinegar and pleasant barnyard funkyness. In the taste, sour, very nice lactic brett notes playing out well into the aftertaste. Nice sour character and a small presence of oak. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied and effervescent. Overall, a fine Geueze and worth seeking out."
"I would say this is up there with the best I've tried, I am looking to revisit this baby with some time in my cellar."
"Minimal sediment in the 2009 was staying at one corner of the bottom of the bottle. The 2004 had a significant amount of loose sediment that made it into the glass - didn't have a proper pitcher to filter it out - but I did end up drinking the warm dregs like a hounding hobo kitten lickin' at an empty-stinky cream dish acrosst' kitchen floor."
"Overall, an indulgent experience, the airy and prickly bubbles make for an excellent rooftop drink on a cool summer night."
"A wonderful gueuze."
"O - One of my favorite guezes. I'm reviewing a fairly fresh bottle here, and I know that every batch is unique in some ways; but I've vintages going back to 2004 that were just phenomenal."
" This is one for the records. A super awesome beer. One of the most complex and balanced Gueuze I've ever had."
"Overall - An amazing beer. The most balanced gueuze that I ever experienced. Barnyard and sour flavors play off each other, complementing each other throughout the entire palate. A very awesome experience."
"Overall - Complex and playful. I would drink this over nearly any gueuze out there. The more I drink it, the more I appreciate its quality."
"O: I think this would be a great ""early stage"" brew when turning newbie craft beer peeps onto sours. Not too sour, just delicious."
"O: One of the premier Belgian guezes and an excellent example of the fine art of blending aged lambics. So good. 4.5"
"O: Quite a delicious geuze, one of the best I have had."
"D/O - Drinkability is high. Probably the most 'quaffable' gueuze I've had by far. Each and every sip of this was a joy and the funk definitely did not overshadow any of the subtle complexities of the aged lambic. After sipping from the glass that had the beginning and end of the bottle, it's easily much different than what I had in my drinking glass, which I guess does lend itself to the belief that it should be consumed separately (or not at all according to some brewers, but I won't go that far.) This separate glass was a bit more bitter, didn't have as much fruit zest in it, and was a bit more heavier."
"O - Really great example of the style...fairly available as well - great combo! I've resisted buying most 3F beers due to price, but bit the bullet on this small 375ml bottle. Definitely glad I did - no disappointment at all - I'd put this in my top 3 gueuzes overall. Love great beer that is pretty easily obtainable!"
"Can’t believe I ain’t ticked this yet. Oh well, looks like I’ll be filling a big hole here (that’s what she said). 375ml bottle vintage 2009 from K&L Redwood City. The beer pours hazy golden color with a one-finger white head and good lacing. The aroma is very funky. More funky than sour, which I like. Barnyard and sweet maltiness. The flavor has a very slight sweetness to it as well as a medium level of sourness. Pale malt and funk, oak and earth. I’m not going to go into the delicious yet disgusting farm descriptors, but they worked well. Nice palate, lively yet not overly acidic, with medium body. Rather refreshing when cold. A damn solid gueuze overall."
"O: A very good, lighter/drier sour. Not a beer to power through due to the explosion of fizz with each sip. Good but not the best sour I've ever had."
"The best sour I've had."
"We've been putting this one off for a while after our first attempt at drinking a geuze a year ago or so. While my taste buds have clearly matured to the point that I can appreciate this more than my last taste of this style, I still find it to be a little too funky and sour for my tastes. My wife, however, has absolutely no use for this beer; give her a sweet lambic, and she's fine, but forget this sour stuff! Still, it seems to be a well-brewed beer, one which withstood a couple years in our cellar just fine. Maybe I'll give this style another year or so, and try again!"
"T: I was a little spooked by the smell, but the taste isn't bad. Lots of tartness with some apple cider vinegar, a good dose of funk and a bit of musty wood."
"O- What a great beer. Perfect for a summer night and paired wonderfully with my leftover hummus from the Stone brewery trip only a few hours before. The beer is worth every penny."
"Overall: refreshing"
"D: This was a very nice gueuze. The scent and body were spot on, and the taste was very nice too. It wasn't overpowering, but there was still lots of wild funk and tartness. So it was easy to drink, but worth sipping. Age forever for enjoy fresh. Definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel and Taste: Tingley, ample carbonation and a medium body highlight the musty sourness. It is tart, but not sharp. The sourness is smooth with lemon rind flavours, chalk, and overripe fruit. It is quite vinous with a tannic, bitter sour grapefruit finish."
"Overall pretty enjoyable, and certainly not over the top. Nice for something different."
"I really liked this beer. I paired it with some habanero pepperjack cheese and it was outstanding. I think I have enjoyed this more than I enjoyed the two Cantillon offerings I've had to this point (Iris & Classic Geuze). Very glad I'm finding a liking to this style."
"Overall- I have reviewed this Cantillon and Girardin all to the exact same score. Subtle differences amongst all three, but they are all excellent in their own right. You cant go wrong with either of them."
"I much preferred this one to Cantillon's Gueuze as I felt the flavor profile was much more diverse and intense. The traditional elements are all here and seem carefully blended. A truly outstanding Gueuze in its own right."
"Overall: As many have said, this style is not for everyone, but if you like sours as I do it is a superb example and one I would highly recommend."
"Overall: I thought this beer was very refreshing. A good amount of sourness. The lemon notes were very welcome. I would have this one again."
"An excellent geuze. I would probably like it even more with age, but not even a year in the bottle, and there's tons of complexity."
"Warning: I almost died when I unfastened the metal. The cork shoot to the ceiling and ,when returning, just missed me. Many Champagne wines would be jalous about this force!"
"Medium body, nice carbonation level, dry and lasting on the tongue, wraps around and holds tight. Pretty much an ideal, relatively easy to find gueuze, although I'll give the edge to Cantillon classic."
"Overall, an outstanding gueuze for it's availability. Something I try to turn people onto whenever possible. Sharp citric notes with plenty of funk. Endlessly complex and subtle. Truly world class and something every beer drinker should try atleast once in their lives."
"O: A solid offering, although it is less funky than I would have imagined."
"D - this is a really solid gueze, one of the best I have had the pleasure of trying. As stated many times above, very sour and yet very delicious. Good thing I have 3 more of these sitting in the cellar!"
"O: gueuzes are ever growing on me, this is a little bit less funky than the others I've had and think it be a good starter.-"
"Mouthfeel is perfectly crisp, leaving a nice, brisk dryness to the cheeks and tongue. Great amount of tiny bubbling overall in the mouth. Definitely champagne-esque. Incredible beer– even if it is one of the few types of gueuzes I've ever had. Armand is a genius!"
"O - Great beer, can drink this all the time and will when I get the chance."
"D - Good drink, easy sour flavor really feels and taste great on the tongue; probably one of the better Gueuze drinks out there; fantastic after-meal drink"
"O: Delicious, Tart, and beautiful. I'd love to grab a few more bottles and see how they age."
"O: Quite an enjoyable Lambic. Pick it up if you can. The only problem is that once you have tasted it, it might be difficult to age a second bottle. I love the fact that you can drink a lot of this, thanks to the low abv."
"O: This is a fantastic Geuze. Blended from 3 years of lambic. A fantastic representation of this style. This would be a great segway beer into this style."
"O: A Geueze is Geueze - I still havn't had a bad one. This one is no exception."
"D: Good drinkability and just awesome beer overall."
"O - Very good brew. I still find Gueuze's a bit on the intense side but I have been moving close to enjoying them more. The beer does have a nice sweet sugary middle to it almost like a green apple."
"-Cheers"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation. Very pleasing brew that boasts quite a bit of salivation factor to it. As more sips are taken it gets increasingly drying on the tongue which makes this brew nearly poundable. The 6% alcohol hits home with a warmth that is expected and well integrated. Every once in awhile I get a thrist that only a geuze can quence and this was a plesant treat."
"Overall: Good tasting, refreshing beer. The sour integrate well with the flavor profile. I would have preferred a bit more carbonation but I can live with it as is. I will buy this one again."
"The best geuze I've ever had."
"Bottle date Feb 2, 2007 (bottle originally from Port Brewing Bottle shop)1st beer in Summer tasting w/ Vistica. Pours a slightly hazed gold. Pear and apple cider aroma with a little funk. Flavor is oaked sour apple with some wet horse blanket. Surprising hop character to make for a nice balance. Super smooth finish wish there was more."
"EDIT: I was lucky enough to go on a second trip to Belgium, and got to drink the 1999 vintage of this beer. While I didn't take detailed notes, I just want to point out that it was right up there with Lente for the best Geuze I've ever had in my life. It was almost tragically close to perfection, and since I drank it at Bier Circus I don't have to worry about the romance of the brewery setting having possibly clouded my judgement. I'll keep hunting down new vintages of this beer, but I really can't imagine that any of them will come close to the '99. Here's hoping my imagination is just a little bit too limited..."
"O: Refreshing. Tart but highly drinkable. Definitely a little too pricy to drink casually, but worth trying."
"O: I'm disappointed that the brettanomyces isn't a bit more pronounced. With that said, I love this beer and knew coming in that it would rate well. Highly recommended. "
"O - this is one fine gueuze. bit steep price wise but definitely worth it in my opinion."
"Fuller bodied than the '98 and a bit more funky with an earthy, musty character and subtle acidity that lingers into a sweet, puckering vinegary finish. Well balanced and complex, remaining mouth-puckering and sour without and harshness or acidic burn. Soft and clean with a chewier mouthfeel. Lots of citrus flavor, especially lemon peel. Excellent!"
"O: A refreshing drink with some great characteristics and some unusual notes. Sadly, the taste fails to deliver in a way that could keep me interested and intrigue me into picking this up again. Should the flavor move out from its shy hiding one day I'd love to have this again."
"O: This is a magical fairy tale beer of awesome. It's part Rumplestiltskin gold and part Snow White apple, and it turned me into a newt. The sour is nice and tart like I enjoy, without tasting like ""bile," and the sour apple taste is really refreshing. Yummers."
"O: Very nice stuff. This one will be back in my stock soon."
"Light body, refreshing carbonation. Very easy to drink. A great beer."
"O: This is very very good gueuze. If the taste would have followed the nose, it would have been one of the best beer I ever had. Any way, still highly enjoyable and recommended to anyone that wants to try a gueuze."
"B-"
"Overall: Wow, I am really impressed. I wish this was more readily available. Very enjoyable and a must have if you are getting into or fully into sours."
"Seems to be available pretty regularly at a decent, not great price, I think it deserves a little bump in the overall."
"O: Very funky and earthy. Crisp and dry. Manageable ABV for drinkability."
"This is a very smooth gueuze that doesn't smack you with sourness. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it makes this one very easy to drink."
"O/D - A great Gueuze. No complaints at all. Very tasty and complex. I enjoyed this alot and found it to be a better example of the style."
"The overall may have been a 5 if I had not already had Canitllon's geuze, but this one runs a real close second to it and is cheaper. Right now, in my area, it's also easier to come by."
"O-Great stuff. A close second to Cantillon gueuze."
"There is too little going on here besides the powerful vinegar taste to really be impressive. There are plenty of Flemish red ales that have an even bigger vinegar burn, but they are balanced by other flavors or sugar. This lambic is naked. What is impressive is that it does manage to be drinkable and interesting."
"O: Very funky and earthy gueuze, nice and crisp with good drinkability."
"i drink this bottle as i bottled my very own homebrewed saison with which a gallon of it will sit on the dregs of the oude gueze for a few months. this beer has a very nice, solid funk to it and i only can hope mine turns out even somewhat close."
"I wonder if I had this one when it was too young. I liked how different it was from what I usually drink, but I wouldn't seek this out again."
"Overall: It is a very good beer, don't get me wrong, but I was wanting more sour and funk to the beer, I thought it was a bit too sweet for the style."
"O - A good one overall, this has been a more pleasant experience than my first try of it. Still though, the extreme carbonation and acidity don't lend well to drinkability."
"O; good geueze bitterness,sourness and the woodtaste stays in balance."
"Huge noise off of the cork. Extremely high level of carbonation. White frothy head that is actually holding, something I have noticed most lambics do not have is head retention. Crystal clear pale amber color. Impressive looking beer. It could be acquired, but I absolutely love that smell. Intense Brettanomyces aroma. As usual, the body is very thin, highly acid Ph, very sour flavor. Taste like a good representation of a Gueuze. I feel awful saying something like this but it is almost kind of bland. I like a bit more funk and complexity in my sour beers. On the other hand this is a very accessible Lambic style for people looking to try it. Highly drinkable sour beer."
"It is definitely drinkable and with only 6% you can enjoy multiples. The head retention is phenomenal and the aromas can be noticed across the room. The flavor is delicious, but not as sour, nor as dry as I would prefer from this style. The carbonation is explosive, but not necessarily in a bad way."
"overall this is an enjoyable, well made gueuze and more approachable than many."
"O: I think I like Cantillon just a touch more. The depth of the funk here is really intriguing, but the clean sourness of the Cantillon is something I enjoy just a little bit more. That is to say I think Cantillon is great but this world class Geuze is ""merely"" very good. 4/5"
"This is a really nice Gueuze. Brings all the right elements together into a well made package."
"Overall -- Undoubtedly well-crafted, but somehow this one didn't thrill me like many other Gueuzes. Perhaps it was the milder lactic sourness and the overtly dry malt character. Somehow this didn't hit my gueuze 'sweet spot.' Nonetheless, this is an incredibly well-made beer and I look forward to revisiting this in the future."
"Pours a hazy honey color with a very bubbly 2 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small particles of lace after each sip that sink down into the remainder of the beer. Smell is very mouth watering. Notes of vinegar, funk, and must blast the nose. Slight scent of an earthy wood smell is present too. Taste follows the smell with sour vinegar, funk, must, and some wood notes. Very, very tasty but not as sour as I would have imagined. This beer is very carbonated but it works very well in making for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. I haven't had too many beers of the gueuze style, but this is a great beer for anyone interested in sour beers."
"Holy crap, I'm amazed at how many people dig these types of beers. I give this beer props though, I understand what they are going for here and I understand why people seek these out. I'm not really a fan of these Gueuze Lambics but I'm trying to be fair here. This puppy was poured out by a guy sitting next to me at the Bethlehem Speakeasy who was loving every bit of it. I asked what he was having so he gave me a taste. It was unbelievable the sour aroma spewing out of the glass. It almost smelled unhealthy to even consume this thing. I drank my sample and I was blown away by how sour and acidic this beer was. This straight up reminded me of tasting stomach acid after a bad night of drinking. For anyone who enjoys these I praise you, I just couldn't ever drink a whole bottle of this one."
"This seems to be a great example of the style, I would suspect. I haven't had TOO many gueuzes, but this is the most intense so far. I just wish I hadn't burned the roof of my mouth earlier on that bratwurst. It's stinging with every sip."
"O: Solid. I'd recommend this gueuze."
"O- This is good, not overly sour and interesting aromas. I'm glad I finally tried this style. A little on the pricey end for this, but you do get quality. I would've liked to have some wood in the taste but the tartness dominated my taste buds."
"O (D) - better than most sours I've had"
"D: This went down pretty easily, but I wasn't stoked to take my next sip like I am with my favorite beers. Quite enjoyable nonetheless, I'll try to pick it up again even with the high price point in place."
"O: I'm relatively new to drinking Gueuzes, but I enjoyed this immensely. Plenty of sourness in the flavor, but not overly so. Lots of good balance and surprisingly refreshing. Definitely lives up to the hype."
"Overall this is pretty exciting but I have to be in the right mood for it. Boy this would really pair well with grilled fish on the bbq, or even just simple grilled shellfish. I am not so sure I would want to dive into this just to drink on its own, but I really dig this."
"I've had this before, so I knew what to expect, but it has been a while, so either experience or the bottles age has changed things. I expected good, but this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It's sad to know it'll never be brewed in this fashion again(though I hope it remains exactly the same). Cheers."
"Pours a slightly murky yellowish orange. A bit of white head. Smells funky and tart. There is a nice fruitiness. Some yeasty hints and very well balanced. Tastes very tart with some nice light fruits. A few floral citrusy tastes. Vry nicely balanced and well carbonated. Drinks very cleanly"
"D-decent with a good sour aftertaste"
"This is good, but not great. Probably a touch to young, and didn't come close to the Vintage series. Still worth trying."
"D: Extremely high drinkability, especially at 6%. The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 is the price (which is actually reasonable considering how much time it takes to make and the availability here in the states) and the sourness, which would probably get to me eventually"
"D-Very nice and not as funky or sour as some other Gueuze I've had, but a very nice example."
"Except for that last sentence, there is no reason why you should not partake in the experience that this beer provides. Just be prepared to feel like you just ate a moldy shoe after drinking this!"
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and crisp with a dry finish. Overall, a great geuze that I'm glad I had the chance to try."
"Drinkability: very high, but I really want to enjoy every sip of the beer."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability, as with all sours for me is somewhat limited, just do to the palate wrecking nature of the beers. Overall, I thought this was one heck of a good brew. Not too sweet, not too sour. Just a great blend of the two. Would definiatly have again. Skal."
"Overall - No better gueuze available in the US, IMHO. This is my birthday bottle, so I'm happy to say that I don't need to finish this by writing ""I could drink a 750," as in fact I will drink a 750. Cheers!"
"Taste is just as crazy, lots of super tart funkiness. There's some dandilion and citrus as well. Mouthfeel is light, super dry and well carbonated. Awesome beer."
"Notes: Really impressed with this brew. Would love to see it with a few years on it, but it's wonderfully refreshing right now!"
"Refreshing, and good with mature cheddar, a rather small body, maybe sampled too young."
"Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, finishes dry and tart. A very nice Gueuze, which is a style I am liking more and more all the time."
"**Update. After having this numerous times now, I am bumping its score up from what I originally had. Overall, I think this absolutely top notch and could see myself drinking it everyday if I could."
"Drink- I think one is enough for me. Working my way to appreciating the outer styles is hard on the palate."
"Pours a very murky golden (little bit of orange) color with a medium white head. Scent is EXTREMELY funky with a lot of barnyard and some horse blanket. I also get a lot of lemon and funky cheese. I now truly know what it's like to have cheese as a descriptive term for beer. Taste is exactly like it smells, and very delicious. You get the funky cheese flavors blended well with the lemon/vinegar flavors and subtle horse blanket. The lemony and barnyard notes make this one unforgettable gueuze! Mouthfeel is very full-bodied with a mouth-puckering dry finish. Drinkability is very high. This is one amazing beer!"
"Overall a very enjoyable Geuze. I love Drie Fonteinen's beers. I think the vinegary-ness was a little more than I like in a geuze taste-wise, but otherwise it was very well made and super complex. I feel like I am finally beginning to be able to appreciate sours a little more and taste what's underneath all that - well - sourness..."
"Overall one of the best Geuze's out there. Get it if you want a perfect example of what it is suppose to be like."
"Medium to medium-light bodied, creamy in the mouth at first, but with a good bit of carbonation mid-palate. Dry and lightly tannic finish implores you on. Honestly, if I lived in Belgium, this would be my daily drink after a long day."
"d- i've been waiting a long while to try this, and finally opened my bottle, and it lived up to every hype i've heard about it. i have one more on hand, and am planning on running to the store after i dig out of this snowstorm to pick up whatever else they have on the shelf. delicious, really really drinkable, i'm loving this. i can't wait to try this with some age on it.."
"Once again, my old reviews blow. Not that the newer ones are much better. Basically the 1999 vintage was a special year for this geuze, I've had it since and it's very good though possibly a tad overrated by some. Even at a couple years this geuze is wondrous. It destroyed a bunch of really highly regarded American sours at a small tasting recently, just such full, expressive funk, always that great lemon, hay bit."
"375 mL green champagne bottle with cork, cage and foil presentation; bottled February 1, 2008. Brewed with 60% barley and 40% unmalted wheat. Pours a clear toasted amber hue, quite effervescent, with a huge, crackly head that nearly escapes the glass. It settles to a clingy half inch that doesn't quite grab on to the glass strongly enough to deposit any lace. Its surprisingly mild aroma contributes lemons, malt and a dash of funk. Prominent acids and esters on the palate, with a lactic acid twang, cherry, lemons, earth and an oak presence. The body is nearly full at times, with loads of carbonation, an oaky dryness and a sour finish. This one seems to focus more on the sourness than the funk, but it is well-balanced and very easy to drink."
"DB- Cheek puckering sour gueuze with a lot of funk. More straight forward than the other two. Will probably have it again in the future or try vintages."
"I really enjoyed this beer, but probably could not have more than one in a sitting. I hope to try more geuzes in the near future to see how they compare to this one."
"Out of the gueuze's we tried this was easily the palate killer. I enjoyed the abrasiveness but it seemed a little one-note for me, no specific flavors stood out except for pure sour funk."
"Not as sour as some of the other gueuzes that I've tried, but better balance of flavors that may have been the brewer's goal with the blend. A nice gueuze to introduce to someone new to the style as the tartness is brief and not lingering."
"d - A very nice gueuze, with a great tart/sour smell to it. Would love to have again."
"12.7 ounce bottle, bottled on March 10th, 2008. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch frothy off-white head. Head retention is pretty good, with a decent amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is tart apples, barnyard funk, and some oak and lemon peel. Wow, this beer is even more tart and funky tasting than I expected it to be. The taste is just like the aroma, it's tart, musty and earthy. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and has a lot of soft carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very enjoyable! I think this is a good overall brew, I'd definitely buy this again in the future."
"Geuze's are unique. This one is a tad bitter for a geuze. The oak and bitterness finish last with the sourness up front."
"Gueuzes don't get much more pretty than this in my experiance. Straw golden and effervecent, rocky white head. Lots of lemon, barnyard, straw, funk and a small amount of sour on the nose. This gueuze has a great flavor of lemon, straw, wheat, barnyard funk these are predominanat than a wave of sour acidicness. More of the funk than sour. Mouthfeel is as it should be. The only thing is I detect a faint acrid flavor on the finish. The caveat is that I am congested, so I'll re-review when feeling better."
"Poured from a 375ml bottle. Fluffy white head that dissipated quickly. Hazy golden color. Aroma of barnyard and tartness. Lively carbonation. Sour apple taste with slight hay/barnhard finishing with mouth puckering acidity. Very clean finish. I enjoyed this beer. The perceived sourness fades as you take more sips. There is a lot going on here."
"D= A great brew. I could drink this forever. This is the best gueze I've ever had by are and worth any hype it receives. A tasty brew."
"Makes a difference"
"D - One of the better Gueuzes that you'll find"
"Graciously split by a college friend of mine on New Years Eve. Bottled April 26, 2010. Served from bottle into a goblet. Poured a hazy yellow orange with a half finger pure white head that subsided to none very quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, slight sour, and decent funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely a lot of funk going on in this one. It actually overpowered my buddy's palate some with all of the funk, but I found it to be balanced with a slight edge given to the funk. Definitely a good aroma going on here. Wish this one had a little more age on it so allow it to develop. This is a must try for any fan of the style without a doubt though."
"I poured my bottle into a snifter that was too small. There was incredible carbonation with a huge head. Smelled very delicious, rotting wood, musty attics, sour infections. This tastes delicious as with all gueuze but is a little sweet. I was expecting a greater sour punch from this but I feel like it would need a little more time to balance out. Would I seek this out again? Definitely!"
"Corked and caged 375ml poured into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a hazy bruised orange with a massive 3 inch cap that leaves sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. A good 1/2 inch head sticks around the the entirety of the pour. The aroma is fantastic. At first whiff fresh oak comes through with citric fruit tanginess and just a bit of barnyard funk. Surprisingly just a hint of vanilla comes through at the very tail of the nose. I can only imagine it comes from the oak. The flavor is very balanced. Citric tartness hits the back of the jaw, reminding me of fresh grapefruit mixed with pineapple sweetness. Musty barnyard combined with fresh oak. The mouthfeel is much creamier then most gueuzes but it finishes dryly like any good gueuze. Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze is quite a bit different then most gueuzes I've had. While different, its still extremely tasty."
"Got this one from Andy for Christmas. 12.7 ounce bottle bottled on December 10th, 2009 and poured into a tulip. The body is a hazy straw color with surprisingly big white fluffy head. Not the most complex aroma in the world on this one but it's exactly what it needs to be; simply sour with woody notes. Fantastic. The taste follows the aroma nicely. Tart and sour through and through with a woody finish and sour white grape taste. Near perfect mouthfeel. I think with the style I'd like a bit less carbonation but otherwise wonderful."
"Recommended as a sipper and a very nice gueze."
"750 ml bottled on march 2008..corked,caged and foiled..it poured a hazy glowing amber/peach color with a small head ..its a beautiful looking and unique color ...smell was sour .tart with nice fruit and lemon tartness some wheat and barley nothing overwhelmed...taste was outstanding with a stellar sour and slight vinegar taste mixed with fruit tartness some hops and malt and wheat profile all with some oak and wood flavors ..very well blended..mouth feel is tart with a great balance of b4 mentioned tastes..such a beautiful blended gueuze..so drinkable... the taste is exceptional"
"I am in funky bliss. Gueze and chowder may well turn into a minor tradition around my home. Merry Christmas."
"Sour and refreshing, nice funky beer."
"D- Like other sours I am have had I would not like to drink a lot at once, but it is easy to drink and enjoy a bottle. I really like this beer, but feel it could be a little better if it was a little more sour and a little less funky."
"2004 bottle, Pours blond with a big fat head, with big fat bubbles. The aroma is outstanding, lemony, peppery, funky with good floral and bubblegum notes that I have never seen in a Gueuze! I also love that ever-present horse blanket aroma lingering in the background. The flavor is earthy with some lemon rind, some nice but mild sourness, dry white oaky notes, plenty funky but not over the top, insanely drinkable."
"Truly a delightful brew."
"I don't know. I've had some tasty gueuzes, and some ones that had such a mellow and refined complexity to them. To be honest, I feel this missed the mark a little bit. There's no doubting the skill that went into it, but I've certainly had better."
"Side by side, the Doesjel is woodier, less grassy, less bright citrus, less sweet/floral character. Both are excellent beers, but I have to tip my hat to the Oude Gueuze. It's an exceptionally crafted beer."
"Fantastic Gueuze. The smell may have been the best I've experience to date, the taste is sublimely smooth, complex and balanced and it finishes nice and dry..."
"Grabbed a 375 of this tonight at Redstone. Pours out a hazy golden color, with just a small amount of white lacing. Dry champagne comes in first, followed by some sharp citrus, hay and funk. Pithy tartness hits you immediately upon tasting with the above mentioned flavors gaining even more complexity as the beer warms. Body is light, spritzy, and well carbonated. Drinkability is lovely. It is actually kind of sad when the experience ends. This paired remarkably well with a hunk of Jarlsberg cheese. Beers like this remind me why I love Gueuze so much."
"I enjoyed the Drie Fonteinen Gueuze very much. I am no expert, but I found the other classic examples of the style (Girardin, Hanssens, etc.) smoother than this particular Oude Gueuze."
"B: 50, 5, 15, 18, 9 = 97"
"I gather most reviewers age this beer. I may get another one at some future point and cellar it for a few years."
"Uncorked a bottle labeled April 2003, cellared since it came into my hands as a gift ~3-4 years ago, and portioned into water tumblers (a decent approximation of a standard lambic glass, actually). Tight-bubbled head abounded, a bit less frothy than memories of younger bottles. Less lees than expected. The color gave another hint of its age, with a touch more dark copper glinting through the hay hue of a younger version. The nose was surprisingly less lambic-funky, with a cleaner citrus zest and grass aroma. The taste and mouthfeel remain, foremost, highly acidic. The tang is turned down slightly from a fresher version. The flavors jumping out at me were of peach and other yellow fruits, with a cleansing herb-y note that felt more than tasted of coriander. I'm surprised to say that I wish (almost) that I'd given it a couple more years to see if it would mellow out further. You can see the theme all through this that it didn't evolve as much as I expected, and had further to go. With Drie Fonteinen switching from blender to brewer, it's all the more important to maintain and preserve those old bottles (and yes to drink them, not archive them)."
"Love this beer. Always a treat and highly recommended."
"Slightly hazy, golden pour with a big, frothy, white head. The aroma is oaky white grapes with notes of black pepper, bright citrus, honey, grass and brett. Sour white grape flavor with hints of lemon, pepper, wheat, and oak. Medium body with lots of effervescent carbonation and a dry tart finish."
"Overall - A very drinkable Gueze with a crisp, refreshing tartness, nice carbonation and a pleasant mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: I'm not too familiar with gueuzes, so my review might not be that helpful. This resembled a spiked, imperial saison in my opinion though. Very complex, funky, and interesting. Not that smooth, but enjoyable. Worth a try."
"Drinkability - I'm taking this slow, but will have not a problem finishing it up. Very enjoyable and refreshing. Would pick this up again if I had the chance."
"T: Like expected, very sour. Unripe apples, grape seeds, white wine, some citrus. An orange sherbet note? Insane complexity here but still very drinkable. After the initial shock it starts opening up and you get a pleasant appley finish amidst a slightly musty character. Sour sugar is in the aftertaste... like the feeling you get after eating a sour candy."
"I'm not sure I can recommend this highly enough, but in any case it probably doesn't matter as 1997 is pretty old and I'm sure becoming rare. But later vintages will likely be nice too. I brought a 2002 home with me from Belgium, also a 2006 for a friend. Maybe we'll try them both side-by-side together."
"sour all around with good hop bitterness to finish. oak and lemon zest. touch of estery sweetness. i'd say more complex than your average gueze. lovely!"
"Overall, it shows age, but it is still a decent beer. I am really glad I got to try this one."
"Among the cream of the crop when talking gueuze, this deserves its high rating."
"12.7 oz. corked and caged bottle served in my Allagash chalice. Bottled on 10 March 2008 indicated on the label. Bottle opens with a pop and beer effervesced out of the neck. Pours a translucent golden orange with a loose, off-white head the consumed half the glass, reducing it's size by three quarters within less than a minute before settling into a solid, fluffy quarter inch cap. Thick clouds of lacing are present during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose is tart, acidic and expresses a hint of cork and wood. Taste consistent with nose - lots of citric acid from the start to middle, with the earthy/cork quality coming out towards the back. Mouthfeel is light and extremely lively, almost prickly - acidity stimulates the salivary glands and finish is extremely dry and palate-cleansing. A solid Gueuze, but perhaps still a little young. The correct elements are there, but not much complexity at this point."
"Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze is subtle, complex, and a hell of a beer. The price tag is high, but the quality is also pretty excellent. Definitely a sipper."
"(D)- Highly drinkable, it is a shame that Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen is now defunct due to their catastrophe. I do not use that word lightly, but it is, since this will no longer be available. Need to stock up ASAP!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it has some great sour and funky flavors. The acidicness was kept in moderation which really helped the drinkability for me. Overall an excellent beer and an excellent version of the style."
"O - The only thing standing in the way of this being an every day beer for me is the price. $10 for a 375ml is a bit high, although it is an import. I wish they'd make something like this in the US."
"D: A very good lambic beer, well made. At $11 a bottle, I'd rather have Boon or Cantillon at a lesser price point, nevertheless, great beer."
"An excellent gueuze. Puckering and tasty."
"The pour is golden with a very mild cloudy and a white head of about a finger. Nose is out of this world as for a quality of sour. There is tart. A leathery sour that is on the brink of unnatural in the beer world. Smoke of burnt coriander, rosemary, and burnt rubber. Wild ash to the point that it smelled like an ashtray. Palate was astringent like grass tart but woody oak and leathery. Astringent like blue cheese. And malt character of mild sweet pollen. Lily floral and a bitter that is ash and turbid sesame oil. A new look at lambics after this one. A most."
"Overall, a really good example of the style. Nothing jumped out at me as particularly exciting, but everything about it was solid."
"UPDATE: 10.05.2011. Will leave the original review but must say that over the years this has become one of my absolute favorite beers and it's a huge bonus that it's fairly readily available. The funk with slight sourness comes from what is, as far as I'm concerned, the best blending out there."
"D - incredibly sour, funky, pretty, lively, and refreshing. one of the better beers i have been blessed to try, and possibly my favorite of the style."
"A very solid drink, my first gueuzer actually. I love sours so I knew I'd be a fan of this style."
"Poured a slightly hazy light amber color with tall, white foam that persisted. A very nice, geuze aroma with mild acid and wild, woody notes. The taste was sharp and mildly acidic, lactic and acetic, with woody notes and faint herbal notes. Very nice. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp but ""soft"" for a geuze. Medium light body and modest carbonation feel. The flavors linger lightly on the palate. This was an excellent bottle of geuze."
"D - Nice, refreshing, fun to drink."
"D: As said above, it reminds me of the homemade wine I grew up sneaking. I could drink this forever."
"D: Incredibly drinkable for a gueuze, the tartness is strong but well-controlled."
"750 ml bottle, May 5, 2008 vintage. Poured into a small snifter. Hazy golden body. Aroma of sour apple and straight up funk intensity. Taste is somewhat dry and funkadelic. Soured granny smith apple dominates. Wispy and quite delicious. Paired beautifully with a horshradish white cheddar cheese."
"This gueuze has a very hazy, yellow appearance. There is a small, white, fizzy head that gradually fades, leaving no lacing. Aromas consist of funky straw or hay, lemons (subtle), wild yeast. This smells like a traditional gueuze - heavenly. The flavor is wonderful. The beer has a healthy amount of tartness, with no astringency. The finish is acetic, but not so much so that I wouldn't consume a bottle of this nectar by myself. It's always a treat to drink this great beer. I will revisit this delicacy as long as Armand continues brewing it."
"D: This beer is extremely easy to drink for the style and doesn't have any funky smells or sour tastes that overpower the senses."
"D- Very crisp, not too sour and a low ABV. If you like funk (3 Fonteinen does it very well) then this beer is a must have."
"D This is a middle of the road geuze, it will offend the the uninitiated, but is a good geuze and worth trying."
"Bubbly on the tongue with a prickly sour finish, this is a dry beer that truly reminded me of champagne. I finished most of the bottle (my wife didn't care for it as much as I) but our 450ml? bottle was enough for me."
"D -- Definitely a solid representation of the style, approachable for those a bit more bold than your typical light lager drinker, yet complex enough to interest any seasoned beer geek."
"Bronze color and a nose that exudes good lambic invigorating. On the palate, the beer is quite vinous and more or less acidic. The fruit is suggested by the tannins like apricot and a good dose of oak without being intrusive gives strength and sturdiness to the body. We taste here and there touches of white wine. Hints bitter (perhaps tannins individuals), not so acid, are felt in the finish and endure a great length of palate that allows the lambic to unfold in its full flavor."
"D- Sweetness makes this a little harder to put down and a little trying after some time, but still a good beer. For my first gueuze it wasn't bad, but I think I will revisit this review after trying a couple others."
"D - Extremely well balanced. Great beer and one that I could easily drink several bottles of in one sitting."
"Drinks: I may not know from gueuze, but I know what I like. Oude Gueuze has a lot of flavor packed into that little 375ml bottle, and you can taste the effort and time that went into crafting it. This six-year-old bottle was an unexpected surprise and a rare treat."
"Clean in the mouth, a bit drying on the finish, light and refreshing. Great drinkability, I love this style, but I think the Lindemans Cuvee Rene might be of similar quality for less money."
"Bright citrus, intense sour, balancedin its own way. Gueuze isn't for everyone, but for those twho enjoy it, this is top shelf stuff."
"The cork popped off of this one with no effort at all. Hazy gold hue with a very foamy head that eventually settles down to a small, tight head on the surface. Farm-y/funky acidic notes hit the nose...vinegar, wood, must, tart apple...generally funky with a subtle powdery sweetness. Juicy, tart flavors of apple and lemon. Sour and earthy, some sweetness attempting to counter the sour. Gentle despite the overall sourness. Very smooth and ""floaty"" with moderate carbonation. Somewhat puckering, leaving the inside of my mouth dry. I like it..."
"A dense white head floats on top of this slightly hazy, golden colored gueuze. Taste and aroma achieves perfection. Never had I had a more balanced experience with this style. Especially with a vintage this old. The Brett never overpowers the acidity and there's no evidence of acetic acid. There are bold gueuze characteristics attacking your taste buds in perfect unity. It finishes clean and refreshingly dry. Age has been very kind to this beer. It's truly sublime at this point."
"Tasted from 12.7oz bottle at Lush Roscoe, bottle date is Feb. 1, 2008. Pours cloudy golden with a thick, bubbly white head that recedes to thick lace. Nose is sour citrus and vinegar funk with some nice yeasty bread aromas as well. Flavors are sour with lemon and lime acidity and light bitterness. There are also some yeast, bread, and hay notes. The body is fairly light with sparkling carbonation and a long sour and bitter finish."
"D - Love this beer. Can't seem to put it down. Glad I have a few more of these in my cellar."
"Other than the minor issue of the carbonation, a great beer that I would have again in a second. Worth noting that I drank this over about 90 minutes...from cold straight from the fridge to nearly room temperature. The flavor profile seemed to begin to shade more earthy/grassy as it warmed, and was very pleasant. I've heard this before with guezes, but this is the first one that I took my time with. Well worth it :D"
"bottled may 2008. Awesome. Pours burnt gold with some peachy hues and a white head that pops and crackles while it does it's thing. Nose is living wood, earth, mushroom, barn, wet barn, lemon, preserved lemon (sweet lemon) and some peppery spice... like I said, awesome. everything a gueze should be without being off or overwhelming or out of whack. very nice balance here. in the taste, the sour funky seems to be rounded out and contained by the flavors of the wood. pure art. it really paints a picture in my mind of fuzzy, dank cellars and cool belgian countrysides. soft as velvet and spritzed up by the living yeast, this beer not only speaks to me, it makes me want more. thank you drie fontienen. sorry to hear about you recent problems with the brewery. no matter what happens, keep 'em coming and I'll keep supporting!! cheers."
"D - This would destroy a sour noob. I've enjoyed it though and would pick this one up again... however I prefer fruit lambics. And this certainly isn't as sour as Cantillon Kriek or La Folie. Really a solid brew however, my only problem is the boatloads of carbonation."
"This is one of the better gueuzes out there it is a shock at first but mellows."
"Oude Geuze is unlike anything I've tried thus far, especially in terms of how the flavors progressed. I'm still acclimating myself to sours but I really like how the dryness works in conjunction with the prominent oak characteristics. I'm looking forward to more forays into the style."
"Pours light copper with a vigorous head. Tropical aromas of pineapple, kiwi, and strawberry, with hints grassiness, and a slight maltiness. Flavor has a clean, bright sourness, with some astringency. Well carbonated with a wet feel. Very tasty, indeed."
"D: Smooth, refined yet exhibiting a breadth of flavours."
"D- This is an awsesome beer overall and pretty much what I think of when I think of a great classic gueze. I see why this is the example to compare the rest of the style too. I am looking forward to having this again!"
"Overall superb. I can't wait to try more of this style. I could drink this everyday."
"Overall a 4.65 by the BA system."
"D - Though it is tasty and not particularly flawed, I think this is not as good as many of the widely available Gueuzes like Cantillon Classic, Girardin, Boon, Hanssen's or Oud Beersel."
"D- Haven't tried many beers of this style, so I have little to compare to, but I really enjoyed this beer. The tart/sour component make it a sipper."
"4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"'99 vintage...Pours a lovely dulled gold color, very clean with moderate head of little white bubbles, nice sheets of lacing. Scent is a tremendously big yet unaggreassive whiff of musty wood, leaves and damp earth (like a walk outside after a day of rain) backed by nice big tart and sour notes that awaken the senses after the comforting mustyness. Taste follws scent almost to the t - dont ask me how i know what earthy, wood and leaves taste like, but this is it. The tart and sourness is also present in a big bold way, but somehow compliments the earthyness rather than covering it up. Medium in body, perfect carbonation, bone dry - gone before it hits the tongue at times. A wonderful beer that was quite the experience."
"Had the 99 Vintage to compare with the 50th Anniversary and the blauw. Flavors were slightly muted, especially compared to the two others mentioned. Much less funky than a typically Oude geuze, minerally and earthy with lighter fruit aspects of pear, peach, and citrus and notes of dry barrel."
"I am really enjoying this on a hot Texas evening. The perfect amount of acidic sourness, dryness, and refreshment. Fairly simple, but highly recommended."
"D: It's too bad these guys won't be brewing anymore, but I'm glad they'll still be blending and giving us some great gueuzes."
"Great Beer. Wonderful hazy appearance. The funk goes straight through the nostrils to my heart, a deep breathe of heaven. Great tasting, a little weak in the funk for my flavor, but was still good. Felt great simmering on my tongue for a second before the gulp. Wish I could throw back a half-dozen, but I could probably only handle 2-3 and definitely couldnt afford too many more than that."
"D: a must have for any lambic lover. This is one of the best examples I have come across. Unfortunately, a limited number of bottles remain. Hurry up and snag one before they're gone."
"Of the gueuze I've tried, this is one of my favorites. Something about the intensity of the aroma and the distinct cheese-like notes sets this one apart for me."
"J"
"Notes: Best before 03/03/18. Nice fruity and lightly sweet Gueuze. Mix of sour and sweet, but the sweet is subdued. A lot of lemon, apple, grapefruit, and other fruit. Well balanced, and complex. Really enjoyable sour that is worth trying. Right on the border of world class."
"this was a good gueuze. the lemon notes really made this enjoyable. i plan on buying more."
"D: Love gueuzes but again wasn't as good I thought it would be. Decent gueuze though."
"I couldn't get really excited about the taste, although I still enjoyed drinking it."
"Overall, a truly great example of the style. This beer has all the elements of a true gueuze and is exceptional for its subtle complexity. I loved this beer and will certainly be picking up more of it."
"Notes - goes well with chocolate covered strawberries, German tilsit cheese, and guacamole."
"Overall - An outstanding gueuze... definitely recommended..."
"Very drinkable, I could drink this all day long. Terrific example of the style."
"Overall, an enjoyable and complex beer. Lots of sour notes and funk here that add a nice richness while the mouthfeel keeps it light and refreshing. Definitely a unique, refreshing beer."
"Notes - Truly a palate expanding experience."
"drinkability: high for the style"
"Mouthfeel is champagne like. Nicely carbonated and a little dry."
"This is a fantastic beer. Very deep and layered yet well balanced and drinkable, definitely a blueprint for how the style should be done."
"This is a great gueuze, not as tart and sour as Cantillon, but still very complex. Would definitely have again."
"Overall this didn't disappoinnt. It wasn't overpoweringly tart like some others I've had yet managed to be absurdly complex. Well worth a shot while it's still available."
"Light body, very tingly feel. Dry finish. Supremely easy drinker. Outstanding gueuze. With a lot of sour beers I've had in the past, I thought that a 375mL bottle would be a chore to finish alone, but a 750mL of Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze would be an absolute joy."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable; this is good but not a standout."
"D: Would definitely have this again, no question."
"Overall, this is a very well done gueuze and one that will unfortunately become harder to come by (brewery is shifting to a full time distillery). I hope to try it again in the future and would recommend it to anyone interested in the style."
"A puckering mouthfeel with medium body. While funky and odd, this beer was not overly so. Rather it was pretty complex and an interesting experience. I'm rather new to lambics and brett beers but this was a good primer on the gueuze style for me. I'd like to pick up a couple more of these to put in the cellar and see what happens to this in a few more years."
"My first gueuze and boy was it great. First from Drie Fonteinen."
"Beer is sour up front with a slight sulfur that shows up in the back of the mouth. There is a tartness, slight, in the corners. More acetic in the mouth with some citric, less lactic now. Beer is thin and finishes pretty cleanly. I think drinkability is high and mouthfeel is good."
"Really nice developed funk in the aroma. Cat piss and sweaty balls. Acidic, tart fruits. Musty bales of straw and granny smith apples. The flavor mirrors this with a moderately puckering bite. Some lemony tartness and fruits are present. Nice spritzery mouthfeel with a dry and somewhat chalky finish, moderate-high carbonation. Very drinkable and the perfect serving to split a 750mL with two other people. I'm glad I cracked this because now I can go back to the store and buy more for $18 a bottle. A great gueuze!!"
"D- Goes down smooth. Delicious. But this style of beer in general I find challenging with overall drinkability... this is one of the better ones though..."
"D - Pretty drinkable, not too palette destroying like some others of the style, but definitely has a sour kick. Don't know if I'd drop 18 bucks on it regularly."
"overall i am impressed with this...its solid from all angles and maintains the sourness without being offensive..ive had beers that were more sour but i think this is a bit of control in a bottle..."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. Really great sour!"
"750ml bottle: I've got a real relic here. It is Oude Geuze 1999. The best by date on it is 31-12-2010, and the ABV is 6.5%. I traded for this maybe 6 years ago, and it has been hiding in the back of the fridge since then. It opened with a strong ""pop"". It pours an orangish-amber color. There was a small head on it, but it dropped away rather quickly. What an aroma. I really don't know where to start on this one. Bunches of sour fruits, and definitely a bit funky. There is some sourness in the aroma. The taste is superb. All kinds of sour fruits in here, that have blended together over the years. A bit of spiciness also, with some earthiness in the background. Kind of hard to explain, but there is a fullness as well as a lightness to the body at the same time. What a nice treat for the new year!"
"2003 vintage. Pours a dirty brownish yellow with a small white head. The aroma is funky, with lots of brett resulting in a horse blanket aroma. Flavor is tart and funky. Lots of lemons and some wood aging characteristics. Extremely drinkable, light body and medium-high carbonation. A complex, tasty guezue. 3 Fonteinen didn't disappoint."
"D - I could drink sours all night long, unlike most, but this might be the most balanced sour I've ever had. I've never had a beer that has all elements of sours: funky, sour, with a slight hint of aged hops. Perfect Champagne for NYE."
"750 ml bottle dated December 1997, no label, consumed on 19 December 2009. More animals in the aroma. Much more dry and complex, longer finish. An amazing brew. Bumps taste & aroma up a notch."
"Give this one to you wine snob friends and what what happens."
"Drinkability: Very woody for an old beer. I would have thought that this flavor would have dropped out by now. A superb beer, can't wait to see what it's like in another ten years."
"Thanks Bo!"
"Overall an ultra classic and fantastic gueuze. Certainly one im glad to have in the cellar, and one i'd be happy to drink any time. One of the greats."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is subject, this is quite a beast of a beer that only experienced beer drinkers should try, but if your palate is well attuned, them it is a great drink"
"drinkability is great. a solid gueuze with a great sharpness and a funk that is understated but dignified. not for those getting into sours, but a very drinkable gueuze for sour beer lovers. cheers!"
"12.7 ounce bottle purchased a year or so ago from Hi-Times in Costa Mesa, think it was around ten dollars then, drank a few nights ago from my Drie Fonteinen glass, reviewed from notes, color is a cloudy golden orange color, one inch bubbly white head, great retention, some lacing at first too, aroma consits of tart citrus, funkiness, sour green apples, oak, and yeast, flavor starts off with tart green apples, lemon dominates the middle, more citrus in the finish with oak rounding out the aftertaste, tart, dry, and funky mouthfeel, medium bodied, appropriate amount of carbonation for the style, taste lingers, thirst quenching, perfect beer for summer time, not overly tart and refreshing more than super sour, have to say that this is an outstanding gueuze and I am happy that is readily available in stores around me, will be drinking this again, recommended"
"It would be a damn shame if 3F has to cease production over a faulty thermostat..."
"Dry and intensely sour, bitter, harsh and caressing, thin and full, lightly fluffy, lingering in my head, in my dreams, as a fierce screech rends the sky, the black wings are seen wheeling high above the haze, they swoop down again, they can smell the blood, I shudder as I hear the winds tearing through their thin flaps of flesh, swooping ever closer..."
"There are some better gueuze's out there, but this one is narrowly behind the top of the pack.."
"A complex gueze that was a nice treat. Not sure I'd get this again as it was a bit pricey but would recommend this to anyone that enjoys beers made with wild yeast or even those interested in barrel aged beers wanting to try something new."
"M&D- The feel on this gueuze is extremely thin with not a lot of puckering capability, some carb is present though helping things out. The drinkability is high as the abv is low as is the sourness of this beer. Im thinking I drank this to young, it can easily go for about another 25 years in the bottle, so hopefully it will funk up in the future."
"D: This is quite a nice brew. Even though it is only 6% ABV , there is a peppery warmth that makes it a easy going sipper more than anything. Good stuff, and recommended."
"D-I love this beer. Could drink this everyday."
"Overall this is a great gueuze. It's not overly complex, but is solidly drinkable and refreshing, while deliving some awesome sourness. No off-flavors present whatsoever, making this a very clean and enjoyable sour brew."
"M- medium body the sour makes it seam more carbonated than it is"
"Poured from the bottle into a tulip. Pours a fairly bright orange with an active white head. This puppy is carbonated. Wonderful musty, funky aroma (if musty can be wonderful). Very strong aroma at first, it mellows as the beer sits. Flavors of sour apple skins, sour citrus fruits, some vinegar, but it ends up a bit sweet and dry on the palate. Tons of carbonation makes for a lively mouthfeel. Flavor is a bit cloying, staying sharp and bitter on the roof of my mouth. Wonderful geuze."
"it pours up a murky rust color with a big frothy off white head. the nose is funky, musty, light fruits, and good diarrhea (when you smell it, you'll see what I'm talking about). the taste is the same as the nose, super sour, oaky, smooth, medium bodied, medium carbo, delicious"
"Awesome gueuze that's a must-try for anyone who likes sour ales. Crazy complexity that my description just can't do justice."
"Overall, not super sour or tart. Thin to medium-thin mouthfeel with a bit of effervesence. A solid gueze in any book. Good stuff, and quite the surprise in the flavor for me."
"I curve this one high, shame about that huge take being damaged at their brewery by a faulty thermometer. Great Gueuze."
"drinkability: i could see where the second one would almost seem unnecessary or wasteful. but i love i would love to sit around all night and drink yours with you."
"drinkability: if u love this style, u can drink this beer all night."
"Very little carbonation in this one. The beer is a rich copper color with a very faint, wispy head. The aroma has a horse and barnyard funk, mixed with some sweet apple scents. Not a sour-bomb, but a slightly sweetened moderately sour funk. (Sweeted after the fermentation?) There is certainly a little sweetness in the front of the brew. It also has a firm bitterness that runs throughout. Refreshing, although I would have preferred it a little less sweet."
"Since we have almost no sours in the Dallas market Bobby was more than obliged to pop this one open and one of my first experiences drinking a true sour beer was a great one. I loved this and recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a sour as it will defy conventions as to what you know as beer."
"As with most of the Belgian sours I've had, I'm still working to get my taste buds prepped for the acidic onslaught that inevitably ensues when I try them. That said, I enjoyed this beer and it is very good for the style."
"Nice tart taste that is as balanced as it smells. Nice and sour, although not overly so. Very drinkable and refreshing. Would love to enjoy on a nice warm day. An excellent example of the style, and I would love to try an older vintage to see if the brett can get to work a little more."
"Light bodied with medium carbonation and a dry mouthfeel."
"Bottled on date of Feb. 1, 2008. Beer poured into a Duvel tulip quickly forms a four finger head. Bubbles vibrantly race to feed the head. Beer is a honey colored haze and it looks great. Smell is musty hay and lemons. Wow, this beer is sour. . .lemons come through in the taste as well. No hops, no sweetness. Beer is very lively on toungue. A refreshing beer but quite different than anything I've had before and you'll need to like a sour taste. It grew on me as I drank it though."
"D = Easy drinking for a sour, goes down very well and makes me keep wanting more."
"D: Why can't I drink this every day? This is a jewel. I love the style and they are experts. I wanted to savor this but my glass just kept getting empty. I know it is a low ABV beer but god damn. I would kill you for a never ending keg of this at my house."
"Enjoyed a bottle of this at the Kulminator in Antwerp. Pours a light glowing orange apple juice color. Very lively. Smells sour and of apples. Incredibly complex fruit and citrus flavors, with a beautiful balance. Mouthfeel is pretty similar to champagne, lively carbonation and nice dry finish. For how sour this beer is, because of its flavor and complexity it is much easier to drink. My introduction into the lambic world and I will definitely try another."
"Paid 6,4  x 37,4cc , too much I'm afraid for the curiosity."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Not as sour as I normally like, but well balanced and refreshing. Also may be the funkiest beer I've really enjoyed. Not my favorite Gueuze, but quite tasty. Worth a shot if you can fit it in the budget."
"This is my first beer of this style, and my first 'sour' beer. Something unusual to have"
"Bottle marked ""1999"". Poured a hazy golden-marmalade beneath a creamy white head. Aromas of mineral, granite, wet leather, basement mustiness, citrus, and tropical fruit. The flavor is brash and tart, displaying notes of wood, cheese, fruit, leather, straw, ripped tin, and suggestions of blood, citrus and shit. Quite the stunner!!! For fans of geuze this one should not be missed. For the uninitiated, please stay away (leaving more for us!)... try something with a bit of fruit first."
"Overall, I opened this beer after reading that this was a good beer to act as a gateway into sours and lambics because it wasn't extremely sour. I definitely have to agree. This was a very refreshing and pleasant experience that makes me want to experiment more with this style of beer."
"Very impressive; now I need a few bottles to age."
"I've come to the sad realization that I'm just not a fan of sour beers. I really want to like them, but I found this beer to be too sour/dry/tart/vinegary. White grape rinds and acetic acid lended the flavor a good deal of pungency, and the light body was exceedingly dry, well-carbonated, crisp, and mouth-puckeringly tart. The 4 oz. I had of this shared bottle were almost more than I could handle. Although sour beers aren't for me, I did enjoy Cantillon's Lou Pepe significantly more than this Gueuze."
"This is a standout for style beer."
"The aroma is sour with tart fruit, lactic bacteria, yeast, urine, wood, and sugar. The appearance is cloudy and copper with a small head. The flavor is tangy is like the aroma. The palate is average. Overall not something I want again despite being complex and highly ranked here."
"Re-rated with a 1999 vintage tasted in January '07 and the second time around with the older vintage, I enjoy quite a bit more."
"Poured into my Gouden Carolus chalice a very nice hazy golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, funky, very slight licorice, spicy. The taste is malty, yeasty/funky, with some sourness, some licorice notes, and spice. Medium body, the finish is dry. Very drinkable, this is a tasty brew, thanks Joe."
"Drinkability was quite good for the style. The beer was tasty, complex and appetite whetting. Definitely worth trying if you are into lambics."
"750ml bottle dated 02/2007. I've been waiting to give this one a shot, hope its funky. beautiful orange color with a good head at first, then scarce bubbles. The smell is real nice, candy, fruit, peaches, a little basement. Nice and sour, juicy like apples and pears. It feels like very tiny bubbles as far as mouthfeel goes."
"This is very, very well made. Not overwhelming, and with nothing out of balance. I still have that lingering feeling there could be more, but I'm not going to complain. This might be a good entry into the world of sour beers for someone, as it isn't too sour to get one's tastebuds around, yet it's enough that they'll know they're drinking something radically different than anything they've had before. Strongly recommended."
"Overall: makin my way, the only way I know how, but that's just a little bit more than the law will allow"
"D: Amazing gueze, I love drinking this, however, there is so much sourness and tart that lingers in the finish and complexity in the body that this is something best enjoyed slowly and on special occasions."
"D: Very drinkable for the style."
"A stellar offering for a style that's a challenge for drinkability. Very enjoyable."
"I'm enjoying my second glass of this with Cypress Grove Pepper Chevre, which is a very nice pairing if you're so inclined."
"Drinkability: Not for everybody, obviously, and like many a lambic, something to be savored in the right setting, but a real achievement in the class"
"Bottle at Cambrinus in Brugge. Best before 10/01/07. Apple juice yellow, clear, warm amber core, no head. A few bubbles here and there. Spicy nose, lots and lots of funk. Green apple. Palate is chalky, mature, small hop presence but noted, moderate pucker. Yeasty bitterness, alcohol very moderated. Wonderful to drink."
"Tart, acidic citrus flavors right off the bat. Lemon and grapefruit juice (unsweetened) stay central on the palate. Earthy notes of grass, musty hay, and horse blanket on the edges. Toasted wheat as well. Melon, Granny Smith apple, and honey in the finish, with strong lingering citric tartness and acidity. Bubbly, effervescent feel in a medium body. Very refreshing and would make a great aperitif. Intense and puckering, but delicious."
"Vintage 2000- bottle shared courtesy of fisherman34- nice looking stuff- golden hay colour and good carbonation. Nose- wood, citrus, leather. Taste- nice citrus zing, some green apple, very dry and woody. Goes down easy.. Finish and mouthfeel is more dry than puckering. Very solid"
"T/M/D - this is a deliciously dry, sour gueuze with a bit of a grapefruit/orange taste hiding in its depths. The citrusy taste is apparent in the aftertaste too, and it sticks to the roof of the mouth a bit. Very well done!"
"Also an incredible body. The carbonation is superb and adds to the overall refreshingness of the beer and the smoothness somehow compliments and contrasts with tartness and subtle sweetness. A truly well-crafted guezue. I could drink this beer all day and still not completely understand it."
"D: Pucker up, a real eye squinter here. A bomber may be a struggle for the novice or even intermediate lambic drinker, so beware. Best shared with a friend. After the first couple of sips the beer does become moderately easier to handle but does pack a punch to it."
"This is a very impressive beer and worthy of the many accolades it receives. It's packed full of flavor and is very complex. Easily one of the best gueuzes out there. Highly recommended."
"Pours a fizzy clear brownish color, good head, white, foamy, good lacing. Dark fruity bitter smell. Maybe a moldy cheese aroma? Sharp taste, same cheesy taste. A sour soda taste. Effervescent. Not for the weak. A sour rotten taste. As it warms, and as the alcohol kicks in, it's more palatable."
"a great gueuze. some more funk in the nose, and this would rank amongst my top 10 or so favorite beers."
"Hazy golden orange color with a quick fading head. Gueuze aromas of lemon, grapefruit and a small amount of funk. Dry and sour with some sweetness. I'm drinking pink grapefruit juice. This is seriously good stuff, very addicting. My new favorite gueuze?"
"Drinks really easy but the tartness would get to me after a while. Great example of the style & a nice change of pace"
"My last Gueuze was the Cantillon which nearly puckered my mouth beyond recognition, so I was rather apprehensive when I decided to tackle an entire bottle of this by myself. I poured it into a Dogfish Head oversized wine goblet from the 750mL corked and caged bottle. The color emerges as a hazy orange with a foamy off white head. The foam fizzles down to a ring and wisps across the top leaving some lace down the sides. The aroma is dominated by pears and tart apples but has hints of spicy farmhouse ale characteristics. The taste is where this beer truly shines. Certainly tart pear and apples up front, but for all of the tartness that exists here, there is an equal amount of sweetness in balance. There is a bit of hay/barnyard type of flavors in the finish as well. The body is light-medium with full effervescent carbonation that adds to the body. It is amazing how drinkable this beer is. You really get a nice tartness but it is wonderfully refreshing and not overpowering. Instead of fearing the tartness of the next drink, your palate feels refreshed and eager for another taste. This has to be my favorite Gueuze at the moment (I think my count is 4) and I would readily pay the money for this one again."
"drinkability: again, as my first in this style, this is tough. I don't see myself drinking this again in the near future. It isn't that it's bad, only foreign to me in so many ways. I will probably seek out others in the same style, revisiting this one once I have a better handle on the style."
"the drinkability is pretty good. it's powerfully sour, but retains a degree of refreshing palate cleansing, and puckering good flavor."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. the lack of carbonation might even improve the drinkability, since it helps ease the acidic feel. love the depth of the funk."
"Amazing example of a vintage gueze - Guido (the brother who is in charge of the kitchen at Drie Fonteinen) says that 1997 is their best vintage. I believe that a comparison to a newer vintage may be unfair, since back then I think they were blending guezes from other lambic brewers before they more recently began brewing their own lambics for blending. Magnificent, and only 11 Euros (I think) at the brewpub!"
"Poured from a 12.7oz caged and corked bottle (dated Nov. 30, 2005) and served in a tumbler. This beer poured a hazy, glowing orange with a two-finger thick head of tight, beige fizz that slowly faded away into a thin, lasting cap. Not much lace to speak of. The aroma of the beer was made up of oak, grass, oranges, along with loads of funk. The flavor was very woody and earthy. Lots of wet wood, mildly tart acidity, sourdough, and a light citrus sweetness. Extremely funky, but not overly sour. The mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied and a bit crisp with modest carbonation. Insanely drinkable and thirst-quenching. Lovely stuff!"
"A hazy cedar color with a silky tan head. A beautifull gueze. The nose has tart citrus fruit, musky funk, some oak and some subtle candy malts. The flavor is immensely complex yet perfectly balanced. Lots of sour fruits, earthy funk, herbs, vanilla, oak and a complex malt profile. Pefect body. Full yet crisp and delicate. Nice dry finish. I could drink this all night. Ages very well."
"D- Very enjoyable with a nice woody quality to it that I couldn't put my finger on."
"Bottom line: If you like weird beer, this one is great. It's a perfect example of the Oude Gueze style and will give you plenty to think about."
"A delicious, but pricey, offering of a belgian gueuze with the sour/puckering of Lacto followed with the barnyard aromas and horse-blanket Brett character. A nice blend of old and new gueuze to create a drinkable product. I could see cellaring this beer to meld the flavors even more. Can't wait to try the kriek version."
"D: Slightly more drinkable than most guezes."
"D - the smell took some away from the taste but overall this drank quite nice for a 4 year oude geuze."
"I'm new to this style, but I like it."
"Pours golden with no head. Smell is musty, funky, and fairly standard, I thought. Generally unappealing to me. Taste is tart but less so than the Cantillon Classic Geuze. Somewhat musty, dirty, but with a sharp oaky sourness."
"Thank you kmpitz2 for blessing me with this little midnight snack. :)"
"The carbonation was spritzy the mouthfeel was reasonably crisp. Slightly fuller bodied and sweeter than Cantillon gueuzes, which took away from the drinkability IMO."
"Drinkability : a very good beer, complex and refreshing in the traditional gueuze style."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a very low carbonation, with a good drinkability. I had this beer a couple of years ago and did not care for it, or really any geuze really, at that time. I recently tried a Geuze at a beer tasting, adn was surprised how I njoyed. I decided I had o give this another shot, and I'm glad I did."
"Overall easily one of the best beers, regardless of style that i have ever had the pleasure of drinking. There isn ot a bad word that could be said about this, it was literally the epitome of the style for me and I would love to get another of these. Amazingly complex beer, and something I think everyone should get to try at some point."
"Taste - Wonderfully funky and sour, but not over the top in either character. Tart, unripe fruit is at the forefront here, with earthy undertones of oak and hay. A touch of vanilla is present in the background, leaving the faintest hint of sweetness on the tongue. Fairly low acidity makes this a very drinkable gueuze. My only gripe is that the finish could use a bit more oak; otherwise, this is top notch."
"One of the more complex geuzes I've sampled, but not sure how much is due to age as I've yet to try a fresh sample."
"Wow, what a treat. If I'm feeling like a gueuze, this will be the one I grab for sure. I'd love to try a fresher version of this to compare to the 2+ year old one I had tonight."
"Overall:	One of the best, if not the best, gueuze I've ever had. The acidity is calmer than most and the tartness doesn't linger. The vanilla and oak are more prominent than in other lambics I've tried, which is very pleasant. The fruit, grass and spice notes combine very nicely. I find it interesting that they use a 60:40 ratio of barley to wheat as opposed to the usual 65:35, and that the alcohol is high for the style. I'd love to try an older example."
"This beer poured a cloudy orange color and formed a nice off white foamy head the left lattticed lace as it subsided. A medium amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of citrus, yeast and that musty aroma of gueze styles. The flavor was of citrus and bread. The body was medium light and the finish quite tart, but typical of the style. A nice beer."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. The sour in this beer can be overwhelming, but the flavor is quite nice. Definitely share the bottle, I drank the bulk of the bottle, but I did share a few glasses of this 750 and it was difficult at the end to finish. My taste buds were shot for the rest of the night."
"Bottom line: A very tasty and enjoyable sipping example of the style that I can only recommend but I'd also recommend trying before buying(if at all possible) because sour ales aren't everyone's cup of tea. ;^)"
"Could use a bit more carbonation. Mouthfeel is a bit flat ... I like more of a champagne rather than a white wine feel. Still, very good."
"The flavors of this beer have blinded me. Looks are not important at this point. After a bit of vinegar smell, I should have been ready, but I wasn't. taste is sour vinegar. Not much else. Just pure sour. Mouthfeel is thin, drinkability is poor. I finished the bottle, but man was it rough. My stomach felt extremely warm once I finished. Not my idea of a good time."
"Poured from 750ml bottle into a Drie Fonteinen gueuze glass. Poured a hazy orange color with a slight dirty blonde hue. Nice champagne like head that left little after a minute. The smell was a mixture of sour fresh musty citrus, a bit of brett and barnyard funk finish. Taste is pleasantly sour kind of like a lemon teaish flavor with a slight acidic vingear present and the drynish that on the finish mixed with the champagne like carbonation makes this a great example of gueuze."
"The cork came out of the bottle without any pressure. It poured a clear orange color with no head at all. The aroma is dry and sour with hints of sour apples and some barnyard character. The flavor isn't overly sour it is flat though and it makes it very boring to drink. Thin mouthfeel, I would like to try an older version."
"T: Very refreshing and pleasurable to drink. Excellent."
"Appearance was an attractive hazy straw color with two fingers of fluffy white head. Aroma was a mix of light champagne character, acetic vinegar-ness, and a bit of fresh-cut apple fruitiness. This beer also seemed a bit light-struck. Flavor was rather sour, but didn't totally make me pucker. There was also some light apple and champagne notes. Mouthfeel was fairly light and bubble-y and appropriate. I did enjoy this beer and would recommend it."
"D: A funky-beer lover's wet dream. Absolutely wonderful and worth whatever it takes to get some."
"bottle picked up at City Wide Liquors in South Bend, although the bottle was smaller and looked like the ""vintage 2002"" version. This one was bottles Nov. 30, 2005. Poured bubbly and red to orange brown on the pour with a puffy white head. The head disappeared almost immediately and the beer really calmed down a lot. Odor is extremely tart smelling...cherries, strawberries, dank-ness. Hugely sour at first gulp...lemon juice sour. whoo! Then some bretty-barnyard-ness on the finish. Second sip is much more subdued once all my tastebuds have been smached to bits. Dry, tart cherries in vanilla and oak flavor. Rich and effervescent. Towards the end of the glass, the horsey flavor and fruits meld nicely and its a real pleasure. Medium bodied and well balanced. Very nice. Im not too experienced with the style, but i enjoyed it and would have it again."
"It's obviously really sour, but the spiciness is unique enough to make you come back. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I do like this item and might revisit it if the price is right."
"D: The moderate abv is great, allowing for a full-bodied and flavorful ale with a 10% abv pricetag. I am not a 100% convert to this style but I'm working on it"
"D- This beer has a nice full pucker and tartness but it as some good subtle qualities that keep developing with each sip. The smell and flavors were big and bold but I didn't feel like they were punishingly large."
""
"Not much carbonation after an aggressive pour into a tulip glass. Head seems composed of air bubbles instead of CO2 bubbles. I'm worried this might be oxidized. Smell is of sour citrus, musty yeast, and hay. Taste is of lemon, apple skin, a faint sugary sweetness, a hint of champagney grape. Very sour and a little dirty on the mouthfeel. Quite drinkable for the amount of sourness however."
"For my complaints (lack of carbonation, initial sour burst being a bit much), this beer is immensely drinkable. Tart with notes of sour cherry, a bit of oak tannin... I'd love to retry closer to the source, and would gladly join anyone in a glass... on their dime. At this price, to be holding up this poorly, sucks."
"Pours a hazy orange color, head settled fairly quickly. Smell is huge, the expected sour aroma is prevalent, along with some faint malty aroma. Taste is sour citrus, particularly lemon. Some wheat flavor as well. Mouthfeel is effervescent and smooth. Drinkability is quite good, especially for fans of the style. Some may be put off by the sour taste and aroma, but it's surprisingly good."
"750ml caged & corked dated 18/2/05. Pours a clear, effervescent amber with a very thick, rocky head that undulates and heaves like I'm writting a letter to an entirely different kind of web site. The smell is musty, sour, sharp and sweet. Yes, all of those. Medicinal esters add their note as well. The taste is dry and crisp, then decidedly sour. Very delicate and champagne-like up front with a sour lambic wallop that hits you hard. The mouthfeel is really light and airy, but surprisingly substantial. Does not come off as watery at all, which is remarkable given its light body and crisp, bubbly texture. The drinkability is very good, although the sour finish will put some off. Of course, it will probably put off those who wouldn't be interested in a geuze to begin with and that's not me so I'm not worried."
"D - Highly drinkable for all the tartness going on. I will need to try an older vintage and see what time does to it."
"A faint pop of the cork reveals that there isn't much carbonation with this one. Pours a glowing gold with a thin layer of foam that coats the surface and slowly disappears over the next 5-10 minutes. The aroma is awesome. Mister Ed meets Parliament. I'm in for a treat. The initial taste puckers my mouth like no other. I can feel it all the way back at the top of my jaw. Yum. There is a slight bitterness buried underneath all the sharp acidity, but this is all about the sour funk. Great beer, but it could use a little more carbonation."
"I could drink this on occasion but not every occasion. Still a great sour beer. I think I like the Kriek De Ranke better."
"Overall, a very pungent but surprisingly refreshing beer that I wish I had some more of!"
"Pours out like a white wine all fizzy yet holds a head. Color is brownish gold and crystal clear. Smell is sour with some clear notes of horse blanket and citrus fruit. Taste is sour and there's a lot of sour lemon flavor. This doesn't give me a sour face. Mouthfeel is really great the carbonation is smooth and soft on the palate. Overall I think this is my best geuze ever. I would like to get lots more of this."
"This is a tasty sipper with a great woody character."
"This is an infinitely complex Gueuze. This is a beer to slip slowly to savour the developing nuances. Incredible stuff."
"A very nice Oude Gueze."
"Serious carbonation, a really impressively light and springy beer. Mouthfeel is just about right for the style, very good in fact. Sharpness on the tongue, some spicing, finishes quite dry. Drinkability hurts just because of the extreme sourness in the flavor. For fans of sour Belgians."
"D: This was good but wasnt my favorite gueze. Highly recommended to sour lovers though."
"Drinkability: Unique flavor that continues to go down pleasantly. Becomes very tasty by mid-bottle once one's palate adjusts to the pungent tartness. Very nice."
"Depending on your individual tastes, this is a drinkable gueze. It is certainly an acquired taste but if you're looking for something different, this is it."
"Revisited on June 27, 2009. Thanks Khaismus!"
"It is a romantic experience. I am moved by this beer in ways which few beers have moved me. It is delicate, suprisingly sweet in its finish, and oh so tender. A once-in-a-lifetime-experience to be savoured."
"Bottled February 28, 2004. Pours an orange tinged cloudy golden color with a healthy tight bubbled pure white head that diminishes but never really dissipates. The smell is acetic and lightly bitter, but not from hops.A little funkiness, but very little barnyard aromas. I think more time in the bottle might develop those smells. The taste is fairly complex. The flavor starts out with balanced sour and bitter flavors and then slowly develops some more funkiness. Not too barnyardy, but definitely some ripe cheese flavors.There is a lactic sharpness at the end that is pretty refreshing. A fairly light body and pretty crisp as well. Very drinkable stuff and interesting enough to hold your interest."
"Not as acidic as I expected, and for sure a good beer, but not something I will buy frequently in the future."
"Mouthfeel is zingy with a light body. Notes of tart apple, star fruit, & persimmons are lively along the palate. Not bad."
"Originally reviewed on November 29, 2006. 22 January 2004. Bright freshly ground white pepper and plenty of bold oaky phenols and lots of funky cheese, mostly blue. Faint hexanes. Strong golden-orange pour, with a slick of whitish and extremely perfusive and thin carbonation. Flavor is composed of a strong, sharp, piquant sourneess, with dishes of reduced apple juice and a fine sherry vinegar. Lots of horses, and dry, oaky cherry pits. A smidge of oak creeps up in the background. Leather smack! Long tart balsamic tartness in the smack. Palate has a twinge of carbonative percolating, bristling the tounge and lighting up all the characters. Well dried."
"This is a benchmark of the style to me, even though currently my favorite Gueuze is Girardin Black Label 1882."
"Fantastic."
"Bottled on 28 Feb 2004. The cork got away from me. Damn near put a hole in my buddys ceiling. And a gusher to boot. But all was well. Hazy straw gold color pourd into an Orval glass. Lush white head. The aroma is full of horse blanket, sweat socks and oak. Nice. Very tart, and I thought it developed some sweetness as it warmed. Not as dry as the other one I tried. I think Ill buy another bottle and sit on it for a bit."
"Overall this beer is an experience, I look forward to sampling more."
"Bottled on January 22, 2004. Appears hazy, and the color seems to alternate between a bright orange and yellow. The carbonation is subtle, while a nice ring of foam lingers about the edges. The aroma is beautifully sour, with notes of lemon, and peach, plus an oaked vinegar spice. Behind the tart fruity esters there is the faintest hint of cherry sweetness coming through in the background. The intitial taste is a blast of sour, woody funk. The sourness is pretty intense but does soften some after a few sips. The finish fades somewhat with a dry cheese-like touch. Nice flavor, but lacking the mix of fruits evident in the aroma. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, with semi-sharp carbonation. This is a very nice Gueze and one of my favorites, not that I have tried many. I particularly enjoyed the nose on this one, and if it were available in my area I might get a few bottles and cellar them..."
"750 ml. From the first cork pop to the last sip, this geuze has an aroma that tickles the nose and a flavor palate that dances on the tongue. Hazy golden color with a big head and good lacing. Sour apples, green apples and a little bit of apple cider vinegar flavors. Tartness makes it highly refreshing."
"Pours a cider like amber with bright reddish highlights. Musty, sharply citric nose of lemons, hay, and light colored dirt. Sweet and sour lemons hit the tongue first off, leaving pin pricks of bitterness toward the front of the palate. The bitterness in the palate moves toward the back of the tongue with time, before finishing very dryly. Mouthfeel is, as one would expect, very acidic, with smooth carbonation. Overall, a highly dynamic, prototypical gueuze."
"Overall: An excellent Gueuze. It's sour and funky but has a nice underlying sweetness."
"Given the above, its easy to see how many would not like this style of beer. I, however, think its great. This one was spot on for a gueuze and the flavors were just what i was looking for. A super dry mouthfeel and puckering taste that was quite pleasing. I would have liked just a touch more carbonation, otherwise a very well done, albiet a little expensive beer."
"Pours a clear amber/orange, huge thick white head forms, looks awesome and refuses to go away, one of the most solid heads I've ever seen. Smell is wicked, orange peels, spice, tart/sour, hay, barnyard, lemons. Wow, tart citrus, spices, and funk smack me in the face, acidity through middle, vanilla/toffee, more funk, more citrus, this is big. Real nice oakiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, super smooth, really goes down nice. Fantastic gueuze, looks amazing, perfect carbonation, superfunk, I wish I had more."
"My only complaints were that it could stand more carbonation. It got a bit thick towards the end. Excellent gueuze."
"Tastes of fresh coconut shavings, dry almond macaroons, raw peanuts, crabapples, gooseberries, rhubarb. Very dry, like licking oak planks sanded smooth. So little residual sugar; just a touch of green honeydew melon, and not quite ripe at that! Kaffir lime, lemon thyme, wild oregano... Herbal aftertastes abound, and leave pebbles under my tongue. Very dry pebbles. More then puckering, I'm thirsty, but wary lest I challenge my constitution too aggressively. I feel I have to allow this beer to encounter my body like two strange dogs meeting for the first time. I may not move for an hour. As I sip this I feel as though I were passing a comfrey leaf across my tongue. The sourness builds like licking a lime, over and over. This geueze plays the trumpet!"
"M&D: very smoothly-carbonated and light-bodied, ideal for an Oude Geuze and outperforms quite a few competitors. This ""2004 Vintage"" doesn't disappoint at all, yet it shows a slightly different profile than the four-year-old 2002 Vintage I've tasted for more than four times this year. Memories are hazy, I guess I must seize the moment to open another bottle of 2002 tomorrow to compare!! A fine Geuze anyway!"
"Notes: 2 years old and still has some time to go as it comes across a bit on the raw side. Not a knock at all as it was magnificent I just think it needs a few more years. Wish I could find this more often and lay a few down but I couldn't wait to try this."
"Drinkability: I would definitely pair this with some stilton, and I think it would be superb, this beer is excellent on it's own, however. I have not had better in the style."
"The smell is good. A light lactic sourness blends with a nice oakiness and smooth malt aromas. The taste is incredible. Has a nice sour apple lactic flavor along with some complex woodiness. Not too acidic. One of the few really sour beers that doesn't seem to give me heartburn (even though I never get it from food). I can't begin to explain the complexities, or even why I like it as much as I do when I don't like other Gueuzes I've had. I can only suggest that you try it for yourself."
"D - Refined and well balanced, although somehow I was expecting more. Nevertheless, definitely worth trying."
"An amazing gueuze, probably the best i've had to date. A truly epic mother of a beer"
"Drinkability & Notes  Despite the fact that this bottle suffered from lack of carbonation, this is probably the best geuze that I have had. I will have to find another bottle because it doesn't seem as if other reviewers mention the lack of carbonation."
"A real winner."
"Worth the $13 I dropped on this."
"Sharp funky/sour aroma smells of tart Chinese baby corn. Orange body holds a lazy dime thin white head that diminishes slowly. Tart and acidic with lots of funk laden fruit flavors in the fore. Some overripe citrus and pear in the middle and a mouth puckering sourness in the finish. This has to be the most uncomerical style of beer in the world. There is a very nice balance of sour, fruit sweetness, tart and bitter with none truly dominating and all getting a little stage time."
"high carbonation and a light-medium, refreshing mouthfeel. initial lemony, citrusy sweetness gives way to a drying, astringent, puckering tartness that makes the mouth water. hints of dry cider, grapefruit rinds, and belgian yeast. an intense finish that takes the drinkability down and would likely make this a bad gueuze for an introduction to the style, but a very well-crafted brew."
"Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It is really clean and absolutely refreshing. There is an amazing depth of flavor to this beer, and it just gets deeper as the beer warms up. As I was drinking it, I was comparing it to Cuvee Renee in my mind, but this isn't a good comparison. The Lindemans is quite a bit sweeter like most of their beers, and this one has a bit drier and refreshing palate. You could drink this beer like a lawnmower beer if it weren't for the high carbonation. I would definitely drink this beer again any chance I got!"
"Update: 1997 vintage consumed at the brewery on 8-18-08. The bottle quite literally had a spider on the webbed cork when it came to the table. :) It was every bit as good as the newer vintages and then some. This one CAN handle age very well. Buttery with full lemon notes."
"The flavor was NOT what I expected. The tartness was apparent, but by no means as dominant as in the nose. This beer is dry dry dry. I was more thirsty after finishing than when I started. A sweet and sour flavor, hints of apples maybe. A hop bitterness seemed to appear in the swallow. Very good."
"Rustic peach skin in color, with a signature, gigantic 3F froth. The nose is at its best when you let the enormous head fall, to about 2 inches (and what a falling, I might add.) Its very expressive at that point, compared to a full huge froth, which doesnt reveal much, or a small, filmy head, which is still pretty vibrant, but not quite as expressive. It releases a very fruit filled aroma with hints of apples, orange and grapefruit along with an unbelievably woody scent which hints of freshly cut, burnt and white wine stained wood and a touch of leather. The flavor is so fruit filled, almost like a platter of full, gummy fruits or a packet of fruit snacks, with easily detectable notes of peach, nectarine, and grapefruit and perhaps a light hint of apple. All supported by a very firm maltiness, a clean, yet approachable tartness and an extraordinary wood barrel character. Wow, what artful balance. Armand is the man. Its amazing he can choose a blend between Girardin, Oud Beersel, Hanssens...etc...and come up with a blend like this. While I find some gueuze unexciting (Frank Boons Oud Beersel and Franks Boons lambics in general), some a bit harsh (A few of Cantillons offerings; Fou Foune, Gueuze, although I do love some) and some a bit plain (Hanssens), I find Drie Fonteinen unbelievable almost each time. Its all about his balance. This lambic reminded me of how much I love Gueuze."
" Taste is huge! Extreme barnyard at first, quickly followed by intense sourness, and a sweet finish. Malt is observed as well. I'm going to pair this with rare filet mignon, hold on a minute... Fu#k yeah! The tastes of the meat and the beer are both big, and both stand up to the other quite nicely. Mouthfeel is still bubbly after the years, drinkability is outstanding."
"sampled on cask at the brewery's restaurant. a nice orange color with the most impressive head I've ever seen: absolutely solid. formed a hole to drink through, like ice fishing, but the rest stayed throughout; when the beer was gone the head sat on the bottom of the glass. smells of funky complexities -- I finally know what people mean by ""barnyard"" in a beer; also slightly sweet and yeasty. taste is everything it should be. dry mouthfeel. refreshing and so easy to drink that we couldn't believe how quickly a liter disappeared."
"Drinkability- With the lower tartness, the great flavor and the drying mouthfeel leaving you wanting more, this beer becomes one of the most drinkable I have had. Terrific brew!"
"Hazy caramel yellow with a rocky, off-white head. Plenty of lacing. The aroma was fruity and acidic with white wine grape character. Dry, acidic flavour. Lots of puckering sourness, but this was balanced masterfully with fruit. Full of flavour. Light body with some tingling on the palate in the finish. A great beer! Thanks northyorksammy."
"Darker than most gueze's with big soap, white head. Very thick soapy belgian lace. Aroma is pure funkiness, horse crap, lemon, a little cinnamon. This is a verey drinkable lambic, not over the top. Sour/lemon with a light body"
"2003.Malt and vinegar. Very smooth. Enormous head. Creamy in mouth. Great for its style, which I am trying the highest rated for the experience. Vinegar in aroma. Tough to finish a bottle, mostly by myself, as my mates, though beer drinkers, were not keen on it."
"Pours a solid hazy dark orange with tan highlites. A billowing head kept it from being poured in one nice motion, but it recedes rather quickly. Nose is very sour and tart, almost burning my nostrils. Seems to be a bit of harsh grape rind in the background along with lemon and solid wheaty notes. Very nice. Flavor is much more subdued than the nose. It initially gives the impression that its going to kick my ass with sour and tart, but it starts to pucker my mouth and then pulls back. Nice zesty lemon sourness and acidity hangs on a little into the finish and then it finishes very wheaty and grainey. Tasty brew. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, and incredibly drinkable brew. The nose is so powerful, that the flavor almost seems to be a touch light, but it really isn't. I'll definately drink this one again."
"2001 Vintage. Pours a cloudy orange color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is extremely sour. There is definately a fruity character, but I can't tell what it is behind the sourness. Hoo-Ha. The flavor doesn't have the sour kick that the nose foretold. The flavor is blended excessively well, but it still has the sourness and the strong fruity character - just not at a shocking level. Very smooth. The body is moderate and the drinkability is very good compared to other Gueuze beers that I've had."
"I'm not the biggest fan of this style, the overall acidity doesn't really blow my skirt up, but I find this a truly enjoyable and drinkable example of what can be done when it's done properly, given that all the elements going into the making of it cooperate. And things most certainly seemed to have fallen into place this time around. Thanks to Phyl21ca for the trade."
"Pours a perfect shade of cloudy apricot and creates a fluffy white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is full of barnyard and sharp cheese, slight vinegar sourness. Flavor is hugely complex, acidic, sharp and sour citrus fruit, funky cheese and something indescribeable that I have never experienced in any other beer. Smooth on the palate, finishes very dry. This gueuze has such a unique character, it is a real shame that I only have one bottle. Quite nice."
"This is a truly outstanding beer and I am really impressed!"
"1999... Upon removing the cork, I got a very small pop, and I was even able to put the cork back into the bottle! Poured a slightly hazy golden color with a medium sized white creamy head with nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of herbs, brett, vinegar, stinky socks and wood. The taste was very sour, but also included lots of oak, cinnamon, some apple, watermelon, grapefruit, and lemon peel. While it was very sour, it seemed to lack the depth I like to find in a world class gueuze."
"750 ml bottle. 02 April 2001 on label. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA for $17."
"Bottle: Poured a clear orangey color lambic with a huge slightly off-white head with excellent retention. Aroma of barnyard and sourness is quite evident. Taste is so well balance between sourness, tart, little bit of acidity, green apple with some nice funky yeast also thrown in. Probably one of the finest Lambic that I had the chance to try and the fact that the acidity is lower then Cantillon makes it easier to drink larger quantity."
"The mouthfeel was very tart yet rounded and very firm. Flavours of fruit (mentioned above in the aromas) and caramelly sweetness dominated through a spritzy and quenching effervescence. Tart finish accented by a fresh bitterness made this beer somewhat less drinkable than a hefeweizen but still very pleasant if you are a fan of gueuze. I shall order many bottles of this brew when I have a chance. The smell was just too much."
"April 2009 update: Popped open another of the 2002 bottles. Mellowed out even more. The acidity is VERY subdued. Clarity is really good. I don't detect the peachy notes anymore, but it is still a bit fruity with cork, sourdough, and buttery notes. The distinct flavors described in the original review have mellowed to the point that you can't really discern them anymore. Still a brilliant geuze! And I am sad to say that this is one of only 4 remaining in my ""cellar""."
"Update  I popped an 04 vintage in 2006 and it is right on track with my initial review of this gem. The carbonation is huge and tight, the stank blooming from the get go, and the farmy flavors are not to be messed with."
"April 2001 Vintage. Wow what a noisy beer. I chose a champagne flute and it was the right choice to channel the creamy and noisy head. The bubbles just kept rising so I could only pour half the flute. This is not over the top in lambic funkiness or tartness but the nose does give you fair warning that this is not cider. The taste is wonderful and close second to my favorite cantillon gueuze. There are a complex set of flavors - blue cheese, honey, apple, melon and pear cider. The one drawback is price which i think was $18.00 at Plumpjack."
"750 ml, April 2001 bottle. Had the option of 1999, 2000, 2001, or 2002, and chose this one. Hazy golden, with a perfect white head. good barnyard and blue cheese thing going on in the aroma. Flavor has a slightly soured blue cheese thing going on as well. Malty smooth palate. Rich in funky flavor, man. Really cheesey. Now I get cheddar, very sharp cheddar, in the finish. I guess I can just sit here and twist all of the flavors and aromas into different things and maybe even write a book. Must get back to my source (top secret) and snag other vintages for sampling."
"Don't know if I put this revieuw right since the one I sampled had only 5% alcohol. Botlingdate 12-02-2003"
"Most drinkable Gueuze I've ever had. The really clean sourness that lingers makes this beer quite enjoyable."
"Taste: Obviously quite sour, but with a lingering yet mild sweetness that creates an excellent balance. A very drinkable brew that I enjoyed very much."
"Bottled 12/11/2000. Bottle lists ABV at 5.0%. Pours a slightly murky golden peach color with a pillowy, volumnous white head. Poured carefully into a traditional gueuze tumbler, Boon to be exact. The aroma is outstanding. I'm sensing a lot of depth in this beer. Lots of funkiness ranging from cheese to mushroom to mildew. Citrus rind, cilantro, earthy, like a field of grain, old gym sock, gunpowder, wet wood, a bagful of pennies, and sour all can describe nuances of this beer's aroma. Upon suggestion of the first sip, my initial assumation that the beer is complex is confirmed. It is not bone-jarringly dry, yet retains a mellow residual sweetness underneath the complex layers of tastes that assault the palate. It's rather unique in a way I'm not sure I can describe. It is sour, in a way that comes across as metallic as well as barnyardy, earthy and floral. Very, very nice beer altogether, and just about the best gueuze I've tried to date."
"An earthier lambic than many, this gueuze has a special apples-rotting-on-the-pavement sort of tartness. A bit bitter through the finish, lemon makes a strong appearance here in all its forms -- mild lemon acidity and flavor early on and very slight citric and plant bitterness at the end. Either I'm getting better at plucking nuance out of a potent style, or this simply has a lot of unique, subtle characteristics. I'm guessing the latter."
"Shining amber. Thin white head. Big horseblanket nose, acidic hay, must, salt... Creamy lactic acidity. Gentle tart attack. Hints of sweet honey melon makes it a quaffer. Huge farmy character, blue cheese and horseblanket like. Terrific cleanliness and honesty. Very easy to drink gueuze, if only it were cheaper... or just available here in Canada. Awesome product of course, but as close to the top 50 as this is, I was expecting a bit more distinctive qualities. Undeniable refreshing qualities are helped by the medium-high carbonation which supports a big medium body. Once again thanks to this pleasure provider named hopsrus. This was a 99 bottle. Review of the 01 will follow."
"4.5, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0 : Total - 4.9"
"1999 Vintage - It pours a dark gold with some orange tint, but it is a bit too hazy to look nice. Of course the look of this beer is by far the worst characteristic. The big head even seems to dissipate too fast. The aroma is musty, barnyard, apple, and lemon zest. I am salivating already. The sourness is big and up front, then the horseblanket coats my tongue before the honey and floral notes that fade to a dry yeasty finish. An excellent gueuze. I can't wait to try the other vintages that I have stashed away."
"1999 vintage. 750ml bottle, drank in the comfort of me own home. A nice golden brew, that borders on orange. A huge white head that settles down to a skim on the perimeter of the brew. The aromas are sweet, reminiscent of gueuze, and yet also mead at the same time. Ever have mead the gueuze? Well, this smells like that should smell. Similar, yet with much more going on. The taste is awesome! A nice blend of pure lambic funk and sweet honey-like tones. The acid is ahrp and biting, but whisked away on wings of honey. The mouthfeel is sharp and acidic, but not ""biting"" and the drinkability is excellent!"
"Very nicely done"
"Bought the 2001 bottling based on how damn delicious the 1999 was that My Shelton rep. Ron introduced me to. The cork shot out of this bottle like a rocket and traveled a good 15 yards before settling to earth-a nice carry! The pour was more than ambitious and proffered up a very energetic, and bouncy head that lasted just long enough for the eye and subsided quickly enough for the tongue to take over. Aromas were perfectly sour with saddle leather and old wood, and a lingering twang that begged to be tasted. In the mouth this beer expanded like a rocket with each sip filling the mouth with light and vibrant foam. The flavors were deep and complex, all the while being airy, light and highly refreshing-much like a fine Champagne. Sour as hell but smooth as silk and balanced like a champ-this was a delight to taste, and I'll be tasting another as soon as I can muster up the cash. Don't miss it!"
"The color before decanting a limpid golden orange and after decanting a bemused golden orange with the head a majestic crown upon that vaporous golden orange body which is spumous in texture and a somewhat off white color, and the resultant lace a silky veil to hide the glass from prying eyes. The first aroma that of peaches, sweet and sour, almost astringent, crisp and pleasing to both the ocular and olfactory senses, start is modestly sweet, dry, hints of lemon with the top light but pleasingly so. Finish is amaroidal, but once again pleasingly so, an integral part of the style, a bit of the hops I think shows through at the back of the palate, so very tart it puckers the mouth, but its just part of the majesty of the style, what a treat, and this may be sacrilegious, but I like this Lambic much more than any Ive ever sampled including but not limited to Cantillon."
"Bottled 1999. Murky amber hue. Lean, but well retained cream white head leaves loose, meandering lace. The aroma is comprised of pungently overripe, moldy peach along with bile acid tones. Softens steadily as it breathes, with softer citric, sour lemon notes and earthy, humus tones providing delicate contrast. In flavor, Brett wastes no time, and envelops the palate with damp horseblanket and dirty hay. Barbed, acetic, sherry wine vinegar pierces through, and the stubborn wild yeast relinquishes its hold. Fruit, of an obviously tart underripe nature, ensues in the form of cranberry juice and nappy crabapple. Gentle, buttermilk like lactic notes manage to eek in as well and provide a gentle curdled skim milk impression. Very well attenuated, yet with a softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Trace, bitter lemon rind notes surface late along with simply tart, malic acid hints. Do lambics undergo malolactic conversion? If so, this fine brew should become unbelievably smooth with additional cellaring. Finishes with a snap of pear like sweetness, but otherwise with a puckering, parching kumquat like citric acidity. A dynamic, truly delicious brew of which I enjoyed every ml. Superb enough in drinkability... I could easily go for 1500 ml. My willpower caved in. I was planning on aging this. It's a tough life..."
" This was my first Oude Geuze, and I think I started off on the right page. This is a marvelous beer."
"Drinkability: World class beer. An outstanding example of a gueze. Simply one of the BEST BEERS i've EVER HAD."
"Very drinkable. Good."
"1995 bottle samped at Drie Fonteinen in 2001. Probably my favorite Gueuze. Appearence: Big, rocky head, orange color, vigorous carbonation, slight cloudiness. Aroma: Balanced. Tartly refreshing, hint of nuttiness. Flavor: Subtle, exciting, sharp and nutty. Finish: Sharp, nutty, quenching finish."
"The taste - mouth puckering in its sour tartness, and yet so lovely to the palate. As the palate adjust it becomes deeper and richer than just the tart nature; there is real body and earthiness here. The feel starts as if a bit thin, but then adds in its champaign-like overtones and the feel begins to move beyond acidity to a higher level of complexity. Drinkable only in small, well-savored portions, this is not to be taken lightly nor casually."
"After I had ordered the Gueuze the waitress went to the bar and requested a one. The barkeep then pulled out the traditional bottle of Lambic lying at a 15-degree angle in a wicker basket. The bottle was carefully opened and poured without disturbing the yeast. The beer when it was set down in front of me displayed a lively carbonation, a gold color, slightly hazy and a thick creamy head. Even from a distance the aroma was evident; displaying notes of fruit including citrus. When brought closer for an extended sniff it smelled quite sour with an evident Brett character. The taste was just about perfect. It was not as sour as Oud Beersel's Gueuze and was incredibly complex, with notes of wood, mustiness, a slight bitterness and almost a hint of what I can only describe as wild mushroom. This was definitely the best Gueuze I had ever had."
"This beer has a golden hue that glows orange. A very healthy and slightly bubbly white head tops it off. Retention amazing. Streams of carbonation jet to the surface. The aroma is wonderful. Musty. Lemony. Grassy. Citric. Horse Blanket. Just a little bubblegum. Damn fine. The body is light and the mouthfeel is airy. A little fizzy. This taste can be likened to the outer layer a sour gobstopper. It is acidic beyond belief. Citrus flavors and lemongrass make their presence know. Some cider. On scale of 1-10, this would get a 9 maybe 9.5 for its mouthpuckering ability. Tart as all get out. Just a little of the horseblanket on the buds. Just what you'd expect from a well made lambic (Gueuze)."
"The ne plus ultra de Lambic indeed. Unforgiving, unapologetic, this beer is The One."
"Café Visit: 24th Nov. 2002"
"Hazy orange appearance, you just know its going to be sour when you take your fisrt smell. Very stinky, earthy smell aswell. This had a very loooooong flavour, covered every part of your tongue, tremendoudly sour, tart acidity, one of my favourite gueuzes, lemony, grassy, earthy, dry, if your a fan of gueuze you must seek this out!!!!!!!"
