"older than the golden doesjel, this is a different brew, our bottle has a 2006 date on it, how fun! still flat, golden and thin looking with just a few splotchy bubbles around the edges of my wine glass. the nose is cool, very old, moderately oxidized, but with a cool fleshy sourness and a green pepper kick to it. the flavor is much of the same with the green pepper coming more up front and it easing into intensely acidic sour lambic type beer. i think age has done this well, its thinness in body makes me miss the carbonation less, and i like that better than the other one, but its still weird to have flat lambic. oaky and funky too, its got an almost marker taste to it in the finish, oxidation with lacto i assume, but i still like the flavor on the whole. this may have been aged a little past its prime, but the beer is also a weird one, somewhat accidental from the brewery if i remember right. fun bottle to share if there are still some around..."

"Pours a deep orange with no head, slightly hazy. Smells tartly acetic with some notes of the forest floor and some light wheat aromas. The beer is almost completely still- just the barest wisp of carbonation. For a style like this, that doesn't bother me. Complex flavors here. Tart, bitter, lots of umami notes that go one and on- mushrooms, loam, pine needles. Slightly metallic and woody at the finish. Very smooth, no slickness at all, which is nice because of the low carbonation. Delicious and complex- a cerebral sipper."

"Overall: Another superb lambic from 3F and one of my new favourites. I am going to have to track down quite a few more bottles!"

"O - Mild, interesting variation to a more typical gueze style."
""
"Completely out of dormancy, this aged ale is alive once again with all the whimsical and elder characteristics from extensive aging; but sparing on the tongue-gripping sourness that often proves too much for the uninitiated. Its simply a gem of an oude lambic as much as it is a gueuze and should be seen as such."

"O: I apparently felt this beer was much better than many. I really thought this beer was more than a one trick pony which had a great base flavor of apples and lemon zest."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While this is not my favourite style, it was quite clean, dry and refreshing."
""
"Overall. Phenomenal. Unique among gueuzes and very delicious. Thanks again Phil!!"

"Overall: While I was excited to try this, I figured it might not be in the best shape after sitting on the shelf for so long. Surprisingly it was a pleasantly sour, complex beer. A great nose that smelled like an old barn. The complete lack of carbonation took some getting used to as I'm not very familiar with this style but overall worth the $8."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall exactly what I want in an oude gueuze, almost perfected, amazing blend of the old and young lambics with great balance, great sourness and acidic tartness, good overall funk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, acidic, and lemon-like aromas. Taste is much the same with fruity and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors."
""
""
"Overall - Nothing compared to Oude Geuze, but a great lambic."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle, 2010 vintage bottled 1 December 2010. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a clear gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and sour, it smells like funk, lemon, tart apples, wood and some earthy/mustiness. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some hay/grass. The tartness isn't quite as strong in the flavor as compared to the aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I liked this, but maybe I should have aged it longer before drinking it."
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty solid all around and was a good interpretation of a geuze."
""
""
""
"O: An interesting blend - only mildly sour with a nicely funky nose. Not exactly sure how the lack of bottle re-fermentation affects it, but oh well."
"Cloudy copper pour, with a small ringlet of bubbles for a head, and even this petered out fairly quickly. Lots of funk in the aroma, wet grass and hay, woody, with citric/acidic notes. The acidic bite came through in the taste, though not too strongly, flavors of a classic, fairly intense gueuze--funk, horse, slightly ""cheesy""--notes of lemon and wood that's been sitting outside for a while. About medium in body, with very low carbonation, a nice drinker, and pretty good for the style, if on the more mellow side overall."

"Overall: I still enjoyed this beer enough, but I think I would have preferred some carbonation. I don't know that I need more in the future."
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice gueuze, but I prefer the Oude gueuze to this although it does have a nice distinct flavor profile"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is less than medium with a step up from being completely still. The slight hit of carb really steps up the flavor and makes for a more enjoyable gueuze. I wonder if this is the same exact gueuze that is in the small bottles. Anyway, while I could probably drink a bottle to the dome, this is one for sharing with like minded friends."
""
"Drink- I was so excited to try this and say I had something from the year of my daughters birth. Good beer shared amongst some new friends and I would love another bottle."
"Interesting one. I’ve only had a few Gueuzes and this is a fair bit different than the others. Completely still, and a lot more funky and woody than what I’ve experienced. OK, but not my favorite..."
""
"O: Very interesting beer. Tough to love off the bat, but wears well through the course of the bottle. I'd probably be inclined to stick to the Oude Gueze most of the time (especially as the Doesjel is 50% more expensive), but this is a nice alternative."
"This one was a part of cmrillo’s 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! Shared by BRoss242! 2006 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3 Fountains’ gueuze glass. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, wood, tart, and subtle funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, wood, fruit, and lemon rine. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I really like how this one is doing with this much age on it. There is still a ton of nice things going on here and it appears that the funk aspect is developing. I could honestly see this one developing for quite some time. Glad I have quite a few of these stockpiled in my personal cellar to try out their aging potential."
""
""
""
"O - More mild and muted, very easy to drink. A great funky nose."
""
"Beer is light to medium-light in body, with no carbonation, leaving this feel a bit watery around the edges. Resultant mouthfeel starts off smooth and medium-light, then fades to a semi-watery light feeling. Finish is dry and also slightly sticky. Again, this would be fine for a lambic, but if we're considering this a gueuze, then the lack of carbonation and somewhat watery body are less acceptable."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Wow... Complexity to the maximum! I've never had a Gueuze that has been aged for over 5 years until this one and am I grateful! This is going to be put down as one of my top 5 favorite Gueuze beers from here on out. Hopefully I can pick up a bottle of some of this or any of their others soon? (Shelton Brothers not distributing this)..."
""
""
"pours a hazy golden orange with a tight white head. The nose is more subtle than the Armand 4's. It Is dominated by funk, light cheese and mushroom, rather dusty, notes of oak and vanilla, hints of mineral and light fruit note. The taste follows the nose, solid funk of mushroom and cellar dust. Light cheese, oak and vanilla with light fruit finish and moderate sourness. The body is light, assertive carbonation and drinkable lasting finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this one a bit more than my rating would indicate. I really think the lack of even the smallest bit of carbonation really brought this one down a notch. I look forward to giving this one another go in the future."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: Tasty beer, but I think it needs more power. Of course, this is a fairly ""young"" gueuze, so we shall see what the cellar does to this."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent bone white head that displays fair retention and lace. Smells of barnyard funk, light pomme fruits and a hint of cherry. Taste is tart and crisp with light fruits, a bit funky and hay like with a surprising bit of residual sugar. Medium to light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a tart slick mouthfeel. Nice beer to ring in the new year."
""
"O: very solid take on the style. Not the best but far from the worst. The price tag is a bit much, I think I paid $27 for the 750 at discount in Milwaukee. So wouldn't buy again for that price, but wouldn't't turn it down if offered. Good beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great balance and funkiness with a smooth, delicious backing. Typing my reviews like this always makes me think of you're average Joe reading them thinking the description sounds disgusting. Dear average Joe, this beer is awesome!"
""
"Overall just another classic beer from this brewery. Love the fireplace ash angle."
""
""
"This may not be my favorite gueuze, but it's a damn nice one. I'm not sure it's worth the high price tag and I'd rather get the Cantillon Oude Gueuze 100% Lambic for about the same price...when you can find it."
""
""
"If you're hankering to tick all 3F beers I can definitely recommend this one, but if you just want to try a good gueuze save your money for the standard offerings."

"Rather interesting what a side by side tasting will tell you..."
"Feb. 23 2006, 375 ml. long cellared - synthetic cork. Pours almost completely still, which I am under the impression is traditional for the style. A slight haze to a orange colored beer. Gueuze' aren't exactly supposed to look pretty. Even with low carbonation the smell is quite intense. An appealing mix of oak and Brett yeast character. Really appealing. Taste is similar to smell. Heavy presence of oak and ending with bright sour yeast flavor. Ph. is piercing and exciting to the palate. I like the lip puckering quality. The lack of carbonation makes it surprisingly smooth and quite drinkable. Body is thin as expected. I'm really impressed with the range in the mouthfeel. Soft wheat start -> oaky and sour kick -> lingering peppery Brettanomyces. I find this bottle to be perfectly aged for my palate. One of the best lambics I've had the pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability – Not bad, but I’ve had better gueuze. I have another bottle of this that I acquired at a different store, so I'll re-review this when I open that in case this wasn't a good bottle."
"very complex and delicious. has lots of unblended lambic to it, more so than gueuze."
"Overall, a really nice, funky gueze with one flaw, a lack of carbonation. Really nice balance of funk and sour. I hope the large format bottle I have has better carbonation. This version is still very good though."
"A delicious gueuze, though not quite as good as the classic."
"Rather enjoyable Gueuze. Assertive tart flavor complimented by an appropriate amount of funk. Very easy to drink, quite enjoyable. I do wish there was some carbonation. While I can appreciate the beer with out, I feel it may have benefited by its presence."
"Overall: I have limited experience with gueuzes so far; however, this is how I pictured them. Acidic and funky."
"Cheers!"
"O - A very good gueze flavor with an interesting twist, the still body. I must say that this is a really delicious beer."
"O - Pretty enjoyable with good taste. Slightly different take with the citrus being such a dominant component of the Gueuze, but it was a good beer."
"It is tart and acidic, and quite pleasant, with some fruitiness, but perhaps this one was aged too long, if there is such thing for a lambic, but in comparison to gueuzedude's notes, mine is lacking aggressiveness. Need to get a fresh bottle for comparison."
"December 2006 vintage shared amongst friends. I thought this was suppose to be an unblended lambic, oh well. Pours with a fair head, white, one finger. Hazy, orange-ish amber. The aroma is comprised of some lemon, citrus rind, and dusty cellar, horse blanket. What I am looking for isn't there, nose stinging sour high acidic notes. Nice taste, not outstanding. Lemon, sour citrus peel, and a good dose of funk. Some additional dusty cellar, in the end this is a one dimensional gueuze. A full body for a sour, and wheat-y. I swear I had this several years ago and it was labeled an un-blended lambic, I think it would have faired better as such. In the end though this beer is very good worth a re-visit for sure."
"Light and crisp on the body with active carbonation. Overall an enjoyable geurze. A little pricy when there are other more affordable examples of the style."
"I remember this being completely flat when I had it a year ago. This older bottle is quite carbonated and I'm sure more appealing to the masses."
"O - A somewhat different gueuze in my experience. It is pretty interesting and pretty enjoyable. It falls short of other examples in my book however. All of the flavor components of the style seem to be there, but the relative strengths are different than I'm used to seeing. A worthwhile beer to try and glad I tried it."
"O: this is a really nice beer. the only thing missing is carb."
"Doesjel is quite a good gueuze, and I will grab another bottle or two for when I'm in the mood for some sour, gueuzey goodness."
"Overall: Although not my favorite, again a nice beer from 3 fonteinen."
"Popped the cork and it let out a nice pop and audible hiss, so this one was defiantly still alive. Poured into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine."
"o - Overall another really nice beer from 3F. No carbonation as expected, and lots of oak and funk. Not my favorite 3F beer but something I'd have again."
"O/D - Tastes good but a little tame. Nice little Gueuze. Good but not great."
"Really nice one and reasonably priced. Would definitely get it again."
"O - Not the best Gueuze, but overall it is still pretty good in the grand scheme of things."
"O: An interesting offering that is worth the occasional exploration."
"Overall, this drinks pretty well. I think it is miscategorized, but I still enjoyed it. I would prefer a genuine carbonated gueuze, but I'd happily drink this again."
"pours and orange/amber color with almost no carbonation and no head. aroma is really funky, with a power ""horseblanket"" smell which is actually the first time i've picked that up in any beer. flavor is similar, but the funk is more offputting than pleasant. pucker. coats the mouth and is dead from lack of carbonation. This was not a very good gueze overall and I expected more, given 3 Fonteinen's reputation."
"Pours a moderate yellow color with a very thin, bubbly white head that went away pretty quickly. The nose is quite funky with a bit of burnt rubber. Really quite similar to 3F's Oude Gueuze. The flavor blends funk with a bit of acid and hay. Mild oak character there as well. Really complex. Light body and really dry finish. Burnt rubber isn't as strong as in the nose. Really enjoyable overall."
"D: More funk than sour. Which is interesting but not really what I look for in a gueuze. Glad I had a chance to try it."
"D- The only thing I can really knock this beer for is a lack of carbonation and I can't knock it for that because that is how the style is supposed to be so it is more just a personal preference. Other than that you find some classic gueuze staples with a dry tail end that will have you wanting another."
"A very soft and easy gueuze, good for beginners, yet sophisticated for more accomplished drinkers."
"Super drinkable for a gueuze and decent. Interesting still lambic (intentionally still, ergo ""Doesjel"")."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly in line where I expect a still beer to be. Because of the reduced perception of sourness it it very drinkable and actually approachable to many beer fans regardless of carbonation level. I'm just starting to get into still lambic and have a handful. I really love the style and this one stands out as one of my favorites."
"This bottle was bottled in February of 2006, so it's just short of five years old. It poured an auburn, burnt apricot in color with no head or carbonation at all. It sat still, lifeless in my snifter. The aromas aren't quite what I expected. It is very sour, and very dry. That's about it. It kind of smells like a very dry cider and is kind of musty. The flavor is kind of hard to explain. It's sour and doesn't really give hint to what fruit or what flavor of lambic that this comes from. It's kind of bland. And when I say sour, I mean probably the most sour beer I've ever had. Being a five year old bottle, I expected it to lose most of the carbonation but this has absolutely none. It's kind of flat. Being my first gueuze, I'm not sure if this is desired or expected. It had the mouthfeel of a light white wine. This beer had good sourness but perhaps I should've looked for a younger bottle because it wasn't complex whatsoever. It was interesting and I'm glad I tried it. This particular gueuze just wasn't for me."
"Bottle opened with a small pop and some apparent carbonation however upon pouring it was basically still with a nice clear golden color. The aroma is complex and wonderful some fresh cut hay, lots of horse blanket, plenty of lemon rind, lots of farmyard funk. One complex pungent little beer. The flavor has lots of lemon rind that provides a really good bitterness, the beer is very sour with some tart cherry and a good woodiness. This is so damn good that I really need to revisit the regular Gueuze."
"Pours a dark golden color into my glass, a few stray carbs make their way up to the top of the glass, but otherwise its pretty dormant. It has a musty, aged aroma to it that mingles with lemons, slight alcohol remnants, and some random yeastiness that creeps into the nose. A very tart, somewhat sour flavor to begin with, definitely some lemon, citrus, some acetic acid makes its way to the palate as well. Has a bit of an acidic burn as it hits the back of the throat, nice earthy and smooth aftertaste to mellow things out. Very light on the carbonation, dry in character, and fairly light bodied. This is my first tasting of the style, and in my opinion, it grows on you. At first I was a bit surprised at how tart and sour it was up front, but there really is a whole lot going on once you get past the initial characteristics. Overall, its interesting and full of flavor, nice and light and much different than anything I have ever tried before."
"This is an enjoyable, easy-drinking gueuze, especially given the low carbonation. Would have no problem drinking this more often, if possible."
"Above average gueuze that is wonderfully dry and tart in the right ways. This is one that will age nicely, glad to hanging on to a couple more bottles."
"Drinkability -- Great flavor profile, but the lack of any notion of carbonation is hard to get past. Didn't have the depth of tartness that I was hoping for in a four-and-a-half year old bottle of gueuze. Not in love, but still a very worthwhile gueuze."
"Mmmm, so good! Has a dry sourness and it seems like barrel aging has smoothed out the flavor somewhat. It is not the sourest gueuze out there, but it is probably about a 3.5 out of 5 on the puckering scale. This beer has an amazing ability to quench the thirst. Awesome beer, I am loving me some Drie Fonteinen!"
"Bottle dated Feb. 23, 2006 from Lush West Town. Pours a golden brown-orange with no head. Nose is sour green apple with funky rubber, yeast, and white bread. Taste is sour and funky with green apple, a nutty finish, and citrus pith bitterness. Carbonation is very low with a drying, almost tannic, mouthfeel and a long hazelnut finish."
"Overall: A very nice Gueuze. This is damn drinkable, and I don't think the meager 375ml bottle before me will slake my thirst for this snoozer."
"Drinks great. More like a funky white grape juice than a beer. I really like it, even sans carbonation."
"(D)- A great Gueuze that fits the style well. Despite already being over 4 years old, it has tons of time left in it for the future. This one goes down extremely easy, particularly for the style."
"Overall a good gueuze. Suppose I should be seeking out more 3 Fonteinen. Very smooth and easy-drinking - quality beer."
"D - Not my favorite of the Drie Fonteinen line-up, but still damn good."
"We love it."
"Clear appearance with absolutely no head or lacing, exactly as the label indicated. Funky sour aromas with a subtle fruitiness and a little bit of barnyard or farm scents. The taste is very tart, though the acidity is lower than I anticipated, making this a rather drinkable beer. Carbonation is virtually non-existent, and the beer has a watery, smooth feel. Overall, a pretty decent gueuze."
"Overall - Enjoyable sour that shouldn't be served very cold, preferably chilled or perhaps even room temp for maximum sourness. Still, not much complexity aside from a bit of general funk depth. Solid beer, but a bit too pricey IMO."
"Mmmm, yeaahhh, wellll - I guess. I've had other lambics with carbonation. This one poured as they said without head and of course no lace. Color is a slightly hazy medium amber. Aroma is yeast, malt, fruit, sour, fresh sawn wood, funk. Flavor is similar. Body is full and again, flat. Finish is like flavor and long. Not my kind of beer. Going to ditch it. Maybe could cook with it."
"This beer is good, but maybe not their best."
"Taste is VERY tart, over the top almost - it's mouth puckering the whole way down but every sip makes you want more. It's a very slow drinker but every drop is awesome and it gets better as it warms."
"D - Exceedingly awesome. I wish it wasn't so expensive! 5.0"
"I really liked the smell and taste of this beer, however, the complete lack of carbonation really affected my enjoyment of this beer...from the very get go with the still, lifeless pour, to the complete lack of decent mouthfeel, it's just really hard to give this beer high(er) marks..."
"Beer is quite thin, very tart and sour with good acetic notes. I know this is the uncarbonated version but it would be greatly improved in flavor and mouthfeel with some carbonation. Otherwise another great gueuze."
"Bizarre, the stillness robs the beer of its character, and makes this taste like some kind of oak-aged lemonade (now there's an opportunity in the juice stand market). There's so much promise here, but an experience like this makes you realise how much carbonation can make or break a beer. I understand this is supposed to be flat, but it could really do with a bit of zip to elevate it above the level of lemonade. I've reviewed it to its original intention of flatness and given the mouthfeel an average score, but this really wasn't to my liking."
"The lack of carbonation really kills this one, disappointed."
"D: Not my favorite from Drie Fonteinen, but a solid lambic as always. I wonder if this will carbonate/change much with more time on it."
"Oh, that classic Drie Fonteinen funk. Pungent grapefruit, horseblanket, woodsy, earthy, mildly mushroomy, juicy, fruity, pithy, citrusy, all brilliantly done. Moderately tannic as well, this one is just outstanding. The palate opens bright, acidic, mineral-y with grapefruit juice, a moderate funk that's a blend of rotting lemons, pith and loam. Moderately tannic on the finish, there's a blend of grapefruit juice, lemons, vanilla and oak along with a funky bouquet. Medium-light in body with the blend of juicy acidity and tannins lending heft and structure to the palate, this beer is mildly carbonated. If my memory serves me right, this bottling is a hair less tannic than the 17/23 Feb 2006 bottlings, which makes this just a shade watery. Despite that, this beer is quite the masterpiece. Highly recommended. despite the high price. 4.5/4.5/4.25/4.5"
"D-An absolutely excellent blended oak lambic. All that funk melds seamlessly with bright sourness and an amazingly dry oak finish. Exquisite!"
"Overall, this is another nice offering from Drie Fonteinen. Nothing ever really stands out, but there are a lot of nice, subtle, complexities to the beer. Wouldn't mind picking up another bottle if the price were a little cheaper."
"Very drinkable. It's a very contemplative drinking experience. Could easily gulp down the whole bottle."
"Drinkability: High, even with it being flat. Actually might be gulping it, I would rather have this than lemonade on a spring day."
"Rich and complex. I've had sours that were so mouthwatering and quenching I could gulp them; this is not one of those sours. Deep and contemplative, and certainly a sipper."
"Picked up at Granite a few days ago and decided to pop open tonite. Vicious pour into a portsmouth tulip presents a light orange body with a wispy white head. Strong aroma at first of sour apple and tons of barnyard. After a short while the aroma lessens. Tons of sour on the tongue at first, but this mellows. Lots of sour apple, followed by over-ripe dark fruit flavors. Mouthfeel is over-slick. this thing just dies in your mouth. A nice sour beer to share with a few friends, but dont wanna drink this whole bottle."
"Overall, Doesjel was a real treat to drink. It was definitely a ""snoozer"" as the description stated, but do not let that deter you from experiencing this beer. If you are into the style, you will enjoy this. ~"
"Solid drinkability. Overall this is a very good gueuze."
"D- my first beer from this brewery isnt a great experience. i wont be buying this one again. at 10$ a bottle, it came across as overpriced. id much rather get the slightly cheaper cantillon gueuze every time."
"D: Hated it."
" D- This beer has no carbonation at all, a little would help a lot. The astringency is soft and the tartness is pretty mild but not much supporting flavors."
"This is the first thing I've had from this brewery that hasn't blown me away."
"Goes down without being harsh or puckering by any stretch, and calls you back for more."
"D: Fantastic beer, worth seeking out."
"Pours a hazy dark golden brown color with no head whatsoever. Aroma is of citrus - orange, lemons, and grapefruit, with strong funky cheese notes. Taste is mildy sour, with oak notes as well. Finishes relatively dry, with the citrus and fruit notes becoming more prominent to balance the sourness."
"The beer really shines on the palate; it's very sour, woody and earthy; signature Drie Fonteinen. Lemon-like lactic acidity meets strong oaky tannins. Orange peel, earth, wood. The body is almost still, and it's very smooth and easy to drink. Tons of flavor given the overall lightness, and frankly I wish the bottle was larger. It finishes tannic, woody and sharply sour. Very enjoyable, one of the best from 3F."
"Picked this bottle up at small liquor store in Chicago. First time trying this brewery after wanting to for a while. Poured into my Tulip Glass. Pours a deep golden color with no head and no cloudiness. The smell is strong. Pick up sour pears,lemons,orange peel, horse blanket,funky cheese,and wet band aid. The Brett does little to hide its flavor. Up front you get a strong acidic orange peel taste,competing with just a dash of semi-sweet pears, followed by the funkiness of Brett doing its job by imparting cheese and vine to the flavor. Finishs very dry with sour lemons and funkified wheat. Not nearly as acidic as some I have had, but enjoyed overall. Will buy again for sure."
"Very quaffable and easy to drink, especially for the style. A bit watered down and not acidic at all. Slight tart earthy funk flavor that is pretty tame for an authentic gueuze. Dry oaky vinous character with slight sour vinegary presence. Although it isn't as sour as expected it becomes more so as it warms up."
"the finish is a med light body and a strong lingering sourness. this is a nice geueze and definetly worth a go"
"Drinkability: Not the most acidic gueuze by any stretch but acidic enough that I can't score it higher than 4.0 and its only getting a score that high because it is so flat which makes it go down like nothing."
"D: Good, but slightly uninteresting."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with just a mellow tingle of carbonation as it flows down. This ""sleepy"" lambic is pretty tasty and the only other beer I have to compare this to is the Cantillon Loerik I drank a few years ago. Overall, it's fun to drink a beer like this that shows off another aspect of brewing and the variations that can occur. I wonder what 10 or 20 years in the cellar might do to this!"
"overall: i like my sour ales to have at least some carbonation and this was totally flat, my first offering from this brewery and ive had it twice and this one is not impressive, carbonate it and ill come back to it"
"d - the intensity of the tartness and funkiness makes this one a sipper as with most sours, complexity keeps this interesting through the whole bottle, though"
"No head to speak of. Once again, color had a great range from a light-gold to a pressed-cider light brown. This was a gift from TJ's Everyday and I wanted to share it with some friends. Taste ranged from lemon, citrus, straw, hay, astringent tart to light cider, green apple and mild horse blanket. Mouthfeel was medium. Finish was dry, really dry, cleansing the palate and leaving me wanting more. This, again, would be a beer to share, rather than Bogart"
"D: Not for the faint of heart, this one is like its older brother (Oude Gueuze) yet much more potent with more concentrated flavors."
"Taste is more of the lemony sour flavor. Incredibly smooth, but the lack of carbonation makes this feel way too thin. Very smooth, you just want to keep drinking with every sip. I knew going in that it wasn't carbonated by design, but I don't think I'm getting used to it. This would be very good with just a little bit of carbonation. Still good flavor."
"This must be one of the lesser efforts from a normally fine brewery. From the label: ""Doesjel, in Flemish, means, roughly, 'Snoozer'."" Yes, this one is a Snoozer for me as well."
"For me, this beer was something of a mixed bag. From a 375 ml bottle, it pours a cloudy burnt-gold color. The beer is completely still...zero head. The aroma is interesting, though. Lots of horse blanket and funk. Brett and a little malt. Not a tart smelling brew, though. The taste also ins't as tart as I expected. It's got some slightly acidic notes, but it falls way short of being sour. This actually makes the beer quite drinkable, but the lack of sourness seems to leave the brew a little hollow. The mouthfeel is really compromised by the lack of any carbonation, leaving the beer with a flabby body. In the end, I wasn't really impressed with this one."
"D: While the lack of sour is upsetting on most levels it does mean I could drink a case of this. Just a nice refreshing beer. This would be a good example of a beer for someone trying the style for the first time."
"i'm surprised that other BA's aren't liking this as much..."
"Overall this is a decent beer, but I just can't get past the carbonation. Still, it's worth a try to see for yourself."
"D - Drinking this brew was an interesting experience. I wanted to like it, but it just didn't impress me as much as I'd hoped. I would like to try it again with different foods. I think fresh goat cheese, choucroute, roast pork, potatoes, and cow's milk cheeses like Comte would pair very well with this unique brew. On its own, though, this brew didn't quite do it for me."
"Avoid."
"Overall, this one had great flavor qualities but the mouthfeel threw it off for me."
"Brilliant."
"The aroma in the glass reminded me of a flowery home perfume, something like you might find at grandma's house. On hitting the tongue you immediately feel the tart/sour flavor biting in, yet it is not unpleasant in the least. The mid palate brings to mind a very self preserved flavor, reminiscent of slightly pickled vegetables, citruses, and, strangely enough, sea water. As opposed to other reviewers, this is not a beer that I personally would find to be well suited to having multiple servings, it is one better appreciated over a while, and I couldn't drink it too fast. To each his own though, I suppose. The tart/bitter flavor became a bit overwhelming if I tried to consume too much in one drink, or multiple drinks in a row."
"the drinkability is very good. this is one of the most drinkable gueuzes i've ever had; it retains a strong sourness while having a smooth and balanced character without taking away it inherently gueuze-y qualities."
"Pours a fairly dark gold, slightly murky with minimal head and lacing. Nose- lemon, wood, earthy. Taste- tart but not crazy sour. Nicely balanced sour/tartness with earthy leather and wood. Minimal carbonation and dry finish. Drinkability was excellent, I could quaff a lot of this."
"7/4/8/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"Bros. - if you'd like me to send you a bottle, just let me know."
"Notes from and tasted on 5/9/08."
"375ml bottle 02/23/06 bottle date $9.99. The cork was oddly very difficult to remove. Once it popped a whiff of barnyard hit the air. This gueuze is very still, golden in color. Smell is subdued lemons, slightest bit of funky hay or dead grass. The taste is decently sour, citrus, the lack of carbonation makes it feel like a sour juice. I ate some Humboldt Fog and Oregonzola with this and the oregonzola surprisingly matched up better with the beer even though I prefer the fog."
"Bottle: Poured hazy amber/orange color lambic with a medium foamy head with some retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of funk and barnyard note are right on but I would still have appreciated some more granny smith notes. Taste is surprisingly quite watery with a thin body but there are sufficient funky and barnyard notes to keep things interesting. I am a big fan of this brewery but I must admit that I was slightly disappointed with the results of this one."
"Drinkability would be high if I could acquire this all the time."
"D: This is a very good gueuze, which in my mind is drinkable in every way except the cost."
"This was an enjoyable beer, but it lacked some of my favorite qualities in a Gueuze, bright flavors and vigorous carbonation."
"Thanks to xnoxhatex for introducing me to this one..."
"Drinkability is good, a tasty gueze for sure. But also the most expensive of those locally available to me, for 40% less I'll take Cantillion every time. Still, a damn fine gueze, I hated to see that last drop go!"
"No carbonation at all, a touch less than medium bodied. Finish is short and dry from the acidity. Tasty and unique, a treat for a sour lover, but fairly inaccessible."
"Pours a cloudy amber, no head, a few thin bubbles rise occasionally. Smell is neat, intense acidic and sour fruit, hay, barnyardy, funky citrus, some fresh grassy hopping, wood, earth, nice. Taste is hay and grass, very acidic lemons and vinegar, barnyard, bit of maltiness comes through, honey coated crackers, herbal hops, tart woody finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, nice and complex but would be better with some carbonation to it."
"D - Having sampled many Gueuze, this is a great blend of a 1, 2 & 3 year old Gueuze. Blending seems too be a lost art that was not forgotten on this beer."
"Drinkability: Fairly nice and about as refreshing as a gueze can get (for me). I'd say it could use a touch more carbonation, but really it could use any carbonation."
"apple juice cloudy appearance, no head whatsoever.A very mild geuze vinegar aroma. A malted masked taste that fills the mouth over time, with mild fruit and vinegar. Very easy drinking, controlled tartness and refreshing. Lemon and apricot, and no carbonation. Stomach warming."
"As with the Cantillon, Doesjel is a blend of three vintages of lambic ales aged in oak barrels for one, two, and three years, then bottle conditioned. My pour showed a sedate lack of CO2. It was warm golden color with no head or lace and a taste like tart, unripe fruit - sour but not puckering. The nearest thing I would compare it to is apple cider vinegar. A challenge to appreciate and easily defeated by Cantillon Classic or Gueuze Girardin."
"Drinkability: fairly low, I'm afraid. I find it hard to believe anyone could want a second bottle of this, I had a hard enough time finishing the one."
"Bottle samnpled sitting at the bar at Delirium in Brussels. I had previously purchased a bottle of this in Antwerp but have had it cellaring. The beer poured a clear golden body with a medium white head. The nose was a bit funky, earthy and had hits of wood. The taste was more of the same from the nose. The beer was tart, dry and had definite notes of oak and maybe even some smoke. Very interesting beer and another hit from Drie Fonteinen."
"I love a good Lambic & it is so rare that I get one, much less a good one here in the States; this one drinks so nicely. Certainly not an aggressive / hard version (the blend clearly influences that), but I really like the mix of flavors & aromas found here. To be perfect I would request a touch more barnyard funkiness, but this is fabulous as is. A 375ml bottle almost isn't enough as I find this so drinkable that I am having a hard time collecting my thoughts about the beer and am instead just enjoying it (definitely a good sign)."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, with wild yeast, and bacteria making for an interesting brew. It's actually not as tart as I would've expected. Well done."
