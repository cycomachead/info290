4.05,10.1,,,,,,"750 ml bottle, there isn't any date information on the bottle but I know I've had the bottle for at least a year, probably closer to 2.  Served in a Prairie Teku glass, the beer pours a hazy amber/copper color with about an inch off-white head that stuck around a while.  There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is musty and tart, the brew smells like hay, wood, apples, vinegar and earthy mustiness.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some bready malt, stone fruit, and pears.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with high but soft carbonation.  It's easy enough to drink.  I liked this gueuze, and I'd certainly like to try this again in the future!","bluejacket74","Jul 28, 2014"

4.79,30.2,4,5,5,4,4.75,"A big bottle with a big bottle cap. It pours a mostly clear copper with an extremely frothy head. This is one of the most aromatic beers I've ever poured! I can smell it clearly just from the pour, long before I dunk my nose in the glass. It smells of oranges, horse blankets, grass, sugar, and wood. This smells fantastic, I have to say. The taste follows suit and is just wonderfully balanced. It isn't too sweet or too sour, with just enough funk to make you want to put on some disco and get down. There is also a subtle smokiness to the beer that is a nice balance. It's very restrained, which is good for me, I'm not a fan of the smoke, but it adds a nice element to the overall flavor. Really fantastic gueuze, I'd have to say I'd use this as a style example to my friends eager to learn about beer. The mouthfeel is nice and tingly, with a slickness that holds it together. Wow. This may be my favorite gueuze. These guys just really knocked it out of the park. If you're into very strong flavored, very sour beers you'll probably find this a bit bland but I think it perfectly hits the sweet spot between interesting and drinkable. Thumbs WAY up on this one.","roblowther","Mar 15, 2014"

3.98,8.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Medium bodied with a good balance of earthy funk, sweet malt, subtle smoke and acetic vinegar.  Tart and puckering up front with nice funk and sweet acetic acid that lingers over the malt notes into a dry, slightly smokey finish.  Hints of caramel and toffee with rauch characteristics creeping in on the back end.  Very unique and complex.  A bit tough to drink but pretty tasty.","corby112","Feb 21, 2012"
3.95,7.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger slightly off-white head that subsided to half a finger slow. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart cherry, wood, sour, subtle tart, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart, sour, wood, tart cherry, and smoke. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. The smoky aspect on this one really adds a unique touch to this style as it simply adds another layer of complexity to an already complex style. The flavor is very refreshing and keeps you going to see what each sip holds next. The mouthfeel on this one was a little off for what I enjoy in this style as I would have loved the carbonation to be a little higher. Still a really well done brew that I could drink numerous of these. I suggest you do the same, but save a little bit for the others in your area.","thagr81us","Feb 02, 2012"

3.97,7.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Gushed like a fountain upon popping cap making for a minor mess. A super frothy head that took up ¾ of the glass tops the pour that is a very hazy yellow/orange. Smells of Belgian yeast, some spices, and just a tad of tartness. First sip is more sour than the nose indicated. There is a very nice funkyness with the tartness - all due to the wild yeast. There is some bready flavor and citrus notes too but make no mistake it is the sourness that stands out. That sourness hits in the front, middle, and back of the mouth. Not as sour as most but still a pretty damn good effort. Not bad at all.","ATLbeerDog","Nov 25, 2011"

3.5,-4.9,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Thanks to jedwards for sharing this at our tasting. Pours a dull, golden-orange with a loose, half-inch cap that quickly disperses into a band and some thin dollops of foam. Nose reveals light tropical fruit, citric acid and a sweet quality. The taste is completely counter to the nose - starts off smokey (like a rauchbier) and finishes with some citrus sourness. Consistency in the mouth is light-medium with a very harsh and prickly carbonation that leaves a residual burn across the back of the tongue. Didn't really care for this one - weird and lacks and identity.","Jwale73","Jun 02, 2010"

3.57,-3,3.5,4,4,2,3,"I like the beer but the wild yeast carbonation problem needs to be solved. I've rounded each of the last three criteria up by .5 because everything improves after letting the beer to breathe (or bleed) for 5-10 minutes.","clickpush","May 13, 2010"
3.42,-7.1,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a murky yellow color with a white head. The aroma is lots of citrus fruit with some tartness. The flavor is tart citrus with some cheese notes. Somewhat odd and not all that appealing. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","May 08, 2010"

3.88,5.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Quite the gusher. Initial pour leads to a 3/4 glass of head. Takes some time to get to a drinkable glass. Antici...Say it! pation. Nice sweetness, tempered by the funkiness of a geuze, but tempered is the word. Reminds me of a sweeter, funkier, slightly less hoppy Orval. Not much in the aroma department, but delivers in taste and mouthfeel. I would prefer a larger serving of this. Winner winner, chicken dinner. Will buy again.","Onibubba","Apr 14, 2010"
