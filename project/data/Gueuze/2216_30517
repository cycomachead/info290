I probably won't, but it's wonderful to see what excellent wood and the ever fantastic recipe of 3F's oude gueuzes lead up to after years of aging. Unbelievably rich yet super easy to drink, and filled with aromas that take me across different palates overall, this is supremely fabulous stuff. I will hold this memory as closely to me as possible for the rest of my life.","magictacosinus","Aug 27, 2013"

4.67,2.6,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"750mL 2002 yellow label thanks to BrainLayer. Okay. Let’s crack this bad boy once again. Is it really the best beer of all time? Cork pops off with aggression. Pours is hazy, deep orange with beige mousse. Thicker. Quickly settling. Nose is perfect. Mild celery seed gets demolished by overripe peach and red grapfruit which yield to overwhelming fresh birch and cedar with hay and horsey dry funk. Cobwebby old character is juxtaposed with fresh and fleshy overripe peach. An insane experience. Taste is ultra quenching white grapefruit peel with sharper wood shavings. So much old dried citrus peel plays with wood and hay. Palate is perfection. Effervescent and juicy with briny saltwater demanding this be drunk in large, quenching gulps. It’s disappears so quickly from the glass. What can you say? Is the best beer that which demands a slow savor, or that which demands its consumption with boundless temptation and seduction? This is probably the best beer ever made. Like the big brother to Beatification which passed on its power but will never yield the throne. 1/22/2012 10/4/9/5/19=4.7","tarheels86","Sep 15, 2012"

Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger subtle off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, and citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. A beer that I have been wanting to try for quite some time that has been at MANY tastings, but never gotten opened. It finally happened! I am a huge fan of the regular version, but this one takes it to a new level with a more citrus and lemon rine aspect going on than the regular. It was quite drinkable and extremely enjoyable. While being very sour and tart it didn’t make me feel like my teeth were melting which was a nice welcomed change. Definitely worth seeking out and I would love to see how this one ages over the years in a proper cellar.","thagr81us","Jun 17, 2012"

A decent initial tartness, some oak, light lemon, grapefruit, and sweaty socks with a bretty funk finish. Very smooth for the amount of complex flavors happening. Medium body. Soft, chewy mouthfeel.

Cottony wafts, sugars flaunt and a wheat essence plays with persimmon seeds and Passionfruit juice in a soft balance. Fleeting ginger. Pours that clear even gold, headed with mountains of residing billowy foam, lubricious in its delivery. Bubbly and alive. Flavor arrives in resplendent glory, with gentle tannins, refined sweetness and lots of elegant cotton. Pear juice and lemon oils. Tart, puckering and full of the necessary farm yard. This was tasted side by side with the standard Oude Geuze and this was hands down the winner. This maintains complex acidity and brightness, yet holds such refined softness and gentle, pleasing flavors. The young has cheese, wildness, wood and acid, this restrains those a little bit and yields soft spice, grassy fields and sunlight. Awesome stuff.","CharlesDarwin","Oct 25, 2007"

Aroma of green apple with some acid and sour notes and some mild barnyard notes. Taste is less acidic then the aroma was suggesting with some sour notes and a barnyard feel which is quite interesting. There was some distinctive green apple notes which are similar to the Girardin gueuze. Full body with some good carbonation but slightly lower then I was expecting.

I do love a good Lambic, Gueuze especially, and I wish that I had the ability to drink more of these on a regular basis. Almost a bit too refined for my tastes; still rustic though and definitely a finely crafted product, but I think I prefer the regular non-vintage, and the 1995 vintage that I had in 2001.","Gueuzedude","Aug 05, 2006"

There's no getting around it, you are either masochitistly into this, or you try to avoid it like the vile stench of the night that it is. I'm a masochist, let's dive in. This pours like a fine sparkling wine, with a fresca like effervescence. Are you allowed to compare beer to Fresca here? YOU CAN'T STOP ME! There's all sorts of crazyness going on in the nose. Sour, spicy, even bitter notes float up, like cherries and tar, but in a good way.Suck on a lemon, stick some tobacco up our nose, and cover your head with a musty old gym bag. Congrats, you just saved $10. The body is equally complex, but strangely different from the nose. Here you'll find lots of grapefruit and sour apple, cherries, and some used bandaids. It goes down slick, almost oily, but still bubbly and light, with a clean refreshing finish. The sourness lingers longest on the palate, but every sip was a mystery, building on the last.

4.74,4.2,4,5,5,4,4.5,"Pale amber (almost dark gold) in colour with mild sparkling wine-like carbonation. Aromas of lemon, wet hay, barnkyard, paint, black pepper, and mild cherry. All sorts of crazy flavors with this one: lactic acid, horse blanket, wet cedar wood, earth, and mozarella cheese at the end. The palate is quite interesting, as it starts out with medium fullness, but dries VERY quickly. Great sourness and complexity... somewhat Cantillon-like, but a bit more woody. Wow!","fisherman34","May 29, 2006"

4.45,-2.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"M&D: a surprisingly soft body supports the otherwise very dry palate, backed by constantly refreshing fizziness that takes some time to soften on the tongue... The overall flavour profile shows a sourness being well-tamed through four years of ageing. This is the first geuze I've had for more than a year, and I feel really satisfied with the depth and complexity this four-year old geuze has shown. I'm totally convinced that this bottle was reserved at the pub for ME!!","wl0307","0"
