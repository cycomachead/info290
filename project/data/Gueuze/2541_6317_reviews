"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden colored body with a fluffy, quarter finger white head that receded to ring of white leaving little lacing. Effervescent bubbles can be seen in the glass. Quite nice looking and very true to style. Scents of sour, acidic funk, with notes of green apple, raspberry, layered with earthy, yeasty funk, hay, honey, a touch of oak, and mild grapefruit and lemon aromas. Overall impression is of a nicely acidic and sour, funky geuze that is still balanced with fruit and honey aromas that provide depth. A very nice example of the style's aroma. Taste begins moderately sour, with flavors of sour apple, earthy, funky yeast flavors, hay and a bit of oak balanced with a subtle, honey-like sweetness. Sourness is moderate-high on the middle, with notes of earthy, funky wild yeast, grapefruit, hints of oak and lemon. Finish is moderate-high in sourness with notes of grapefruit, oak, lemon and earthy, funky yeast. Aftertaste is grapefruit, lemon, wheat malt and sour, earthy funk. Overall impression is of a moderately sour and acidic flavor profile with balancing fruit, oak and honey flavors contributing depth. A very nice example of a geuze flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied and effervescent with a semi-drying, puckering, acidic feel. Very nice and quite true to style. Overall this is a nice example of a geuze. It is sour and acidic in aroma and flavor, yet balances these qualities with other notes as well. This is aided by the mouthfeel which is light and spritzy, but not watery. A very nice geuze and well worth trying."

"Overall: This is a nice and mild gueuze with plenty of complexity.  I would put this into the same caliber as a 3F gueuze which is my favorite standard gueuze.  I would say that I like this slightly more than cantillion classic because the funk profile of Girardin Gueuze is much better suited to my tastes; it is much more well rounded and balanced than Cantillion classic gueuze."

"Bottle poured at Tipples Rare and Barrel Aged Beer Tasting on July 13, 2014. Pours light yellowish gold with a small rim of white head on top. Aroma of candi sugar and mint leaves, dry, dusty, light citrus. Flavor is funky like my gym socks. Whoah. Some lemon notes, dry oakiness, and some vanilla as well here. More chewy body than other gueuzes in the class that I've had, and low plus carbonation. Nice brew overall, and a bit of a change-up from the LP Gueuze earlier in the night. Recommended."

"Pours a pretty clear light gold body with spidery lacing stretching out. Very tart aroma but surprisingly refreshing. Flavor is dry and tart, bit of sweet vinegar, rustic and some herbs around the edges. Quite nice."
""

""
"The thing l love about lambics is their variability, and this is further proof of the highly distinguishable differences among the standards like boon, 3F, Cantillon, Tilquin, Hansenns, etc. This to me lies just behind 3F, Mariage Parfait, and Cantillon Classic as far as best ""standard"" gueuzes go. Rustic, fruity, dry, quaffable..."
""
""
"Overall 4.0: Excellent beer. Fans of bretts will really love this one. It is funky, weird, sour but ultimately delicious and satisfying. I was joking with my wife that if I had brewed this and was trying for an ale or something and then it tasted like a gueuze, I might pour it all out and start over. However, once you have become acquainted with this style and the ""brett taste"" in general, I think you will become a life-long fan and take it as a blessing if ""The Brett fairy"" ever visits a fermenter of your home-brew. I would recommend this beer to any and all."

"Overall: A good gueuze though not one of my favorites. It's worth a try, but there are better gueuze options out there."
"Overall- Very nice shelf geueze, good complexity and a bit of funk. Would like more funk, but this is not too far from Tilquin in my opinion."
""
""
"Overall- Really, good beer and pretty much deserving of its ranking. It does retail about the same as those three other gueuzes I keep mentioning so I would probably grab one of those over this beer. Tilquin is pretty much always available. Definitely worth a try- even for someone who has difficulty with sours."

"D) Nice and nippy without being overbearing."
"Overall: This is a classic example of the Gueuze. I was lucky enough to try some Cantillon beers on tap at Russian River last weekend, and this is making me want more Belgian Lambics and Gueuzes! Job well done."
"Overall this an upper echelon gueuze. Average sourness but the flavor is top notch. Very much recommended."
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Awesome drink; none of the flavors are overpowering; smooth; I highly recommend to everyone who wants to get into Gueuze style beers"
""

"Pours a apple cider color with a minimal amount of haziness. Smell is green apples and lemons with a decent amount of funkiness. Taste is moderately tart with some of the apple and lemon, and is fairly dry. Medium amount of carbonation. Overall it very enjoyable and very good especially at price around $10"
"Very, very nice gueuze, here. What's more is that you can typically pick this stuff up off the shelf, too. At least, you should be able to. It seems like most places near me don't carry it anymore, but if you look around, you should be able to get it. And once you find it, I recommend buying as much of it as you can. It's some truly delicious stuff, and any lover of gueuze will certainly appreciate this blend."

"Bottle on New Year’s Eve 2012, Bottle drunk after a couple of top Champagnes and I have to say this beat them both. Pours cloudy golden orange amber, white head. Nose is green appley, cooking apples, strong sour yeasty, toasted French bread, farmyard, grain husk, burnt caramel, urine . Taste is very green appley, Bramley apples, sour yeast , very light and citrous acidic, vinegary, grassy, toasted white bread. Outstanding beer."

"Overall, very good, but I am sure it gets better with some age. Look forward to trying it again in some time. Anyway, still a really nice gueuze at this stage!"
"M: Lighter side of medium."
"T: Starts a touch sweet, almost like a lemon hard candy. Then hits with a good punch of sourness, funk and vinegar. Finish brings some vanilla, lemon curd and green apple. The flavors are really well balanced and, despite the smell, this is far less funky than a lot of gueuzes out there. Really tasty stuff."

"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow-amber with a thin, loose white head that dissipates down into a white halo without lacing. There appears to be ample carbonation without much visible sediment. The nose is mildly sour, non-skunky, with a very slight fruitiness reminiscent of tart cherries. The taste is just as mild mannered and drinkable as the nose packing in an initial malty, grainy sweetness, some back-end funk, and finishes with a semi-dry, tart, bitterness. This is certainly one of the most drinkable gueuzes I've had, and I'm liking how approachable and balanced this is compared to some of the funk-bomb gueuzes I'm used to drinking. Its mouthfeel is initially sweet, well carbonated, slightly funky and bitter in the finish. As the beer warms it packs in a bit more bitterness in the finish, which contributes to the beer's crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. I'm impressed with this $10/375mL shelf-gueuze over Hanssens and Tilquin alternatives and due to its superior drinkability. However, I'm not sure I'll try too hard to acquire more bottles (i.e. trade for more). If it were available in my area I'd gladly indulge."

"The beer pours a dark and hazy copper color with golden yellow highlights. The beer pours with a quarter-of-a-finger’s-width, creamy white head of tiny compact bubbles, and is replenished by a steady stream of bubbles coming from throughout the glass. The beer’s body is a cloudy haze of proteins and such, and the other side of the glass can only just barely be seen. On the nose, the beer smells properly barn-yardy, with touches of cherry fruit leather and salt. The funk is nice and dominant in the nose, and provides a nice spiced feeling to the nose, perhaps briefly suggesting peppers. Beneath the salty funk lies a nice citric smell, somewhere between lemons and grapefruits with a touch of pineapple thrown in. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet up front, and then quickly dries into bitter and savory flavors with a medium strength acidity washing through the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as salty fruity, almost like a pineapple. The fruit flavors grow in the mouth and introduce barnyard, cherry fruit leather, and some nice herbal grassy flavors in the finish and aftertaste. The finish moves towards a funky lemon flavor and has a nice long length. The lemon lasts into the aftertaste, blending with the grassy herbal flavors to leave a pleasant taste in the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body and crisp with a nice snappy and rough carbonation that scrubs the tongue free of any of the more cloying funk flavors. The mouth is left clean except for a nice pool of acid neutralizing saliva. Overall, this is a great gueuze with proper depth and complexity. If anything, I would call it a bit subdued in flavor though. It has all of the right components, but is too muted. The grassy bitters are also a little too strong and hold back some of the other flavors in the beer. This beer is a nice solid gueuze overall, though, and definitely worthy of a try."
""
""
""
"O- I wanted to rate this one higher, but the lack of carbonation made me take points off the mouthfeel although I felt it was otherwise nicely balanced. And the flavor was also complex and well-balanced but the aftertaste kind of ruined it. I had to eat a slice of havarti cheese to tone down the intensity which I highly recommend because it was a nice pairing."

"O - Easily the best gueuze I've had yet, although my pool of experience is admittedly still quite shallow. Before this one, I didn't really see what all the hype around sours and gueuzes was all about. Now I really want to explore the landscape a lot more. A very enjoyable and horizon-broadening experience."
"O: Despite being very light this is still quite a very tasty and sour gueuze. I would like to taste one that has been aged for awhile to see if it developes more but with the low alcohol content I would not expect a whole lot. That being said this beer is definitely worth a try and could be a great starter sour."
"O - nicely balanced Gueuze, but it's not quite as tasty as Drie Fonteinen."
""
""
""
""
"now that's a gueuze! damn this is yummy. it pours a pale straw color, hazy but I wouldn't call it cloudy, as the yeast sediment is very fine, rather than coagulated floaties. just a half inch of white lace on top. the nose is real sour, lemon rind and champagne assault the nostrils, very acidic, very unique. the flavor isn't nearly as pucker as the nose, until the finish that is, when the sour just expands and takes over the mouth. it starts more malty, wheaty, farmy, oaky, chardonnay and orchard fruit. the sour slowly eases in, amping up to a very intense degree by the time the beer is swallowed. the sour and the acid leave the tastebuds in a blissful state of ruin. don't follow this beer with anything you want to taste nuances in, trust me. light fizzy body, heavily acidic, piquant, lovely. gueuze is something ive been getting into recently, and I think this is up there with some of the heavy hitters in the field. this is a fairly priced treat."

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass; REF 8x2011 printed on the cork. Pours fairly cloudy golden amber color with a 2 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass, with some streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart apple, grape, lemon, pepper, grass, hay, leather, oak, clove, white wine vinegar, earth, funk, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and nice balance of fruity and spicy notes; a bit more spicy/earthy than most. Taste of big tart apple, grape, cherry, lemon, grass, hay, pepper, clove, oak, leather, white wine vinegar, earth, funk, and yeast spiciness. Fair amount of earthy and fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, grass, hay, pepper, clove, oak, leather, earth, funk, light vinegar, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity, spicy, and wild yeast notes; near perfect balance of all flavors; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Acidity is also extremely well balanced and not overwhelming at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy, acidic, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Gueuze! Huge complexity and balance of all flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. An highly outstanding offering."

"Great value and readily available geuze. Can't find Drie Fonteinen or Cantillon anymore? Meet Girardin 1882. At least while you still can..."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A very nice, classic style queuze. I could drink this all day but sadly only have this 375. Will buy again the next time I see it."
""
""
"O - Very nice geueze. Perfect funk vs. citrus."
""
"From notes, 6/22/11. A wonderful gueuze. I’m currently drinking a fresh bottle, and it’s comparable to any of the vaunted examples of the style. Pours a yellowish orange with small white head that dissipates quickly. Hazy. The aroma is subtle and complex. There are notes of green apples, lemons, barnyard funk, hay, sourdough, sour cherries and grass. The taste still has some light malt sweetness, but it finishes light, dry and medium sour. The aftertaste is sour and funky. It’s a very easy beer to drink, but you’ll want to savor it. Delicious."

"OVERALL: This one was pretty rough going. Far too much sewage and mouldy, musty, dank dewllings on this one. Not my style of gueuze what-so-ever. Choked down three ounces and dumped the rest."
"A nice change from the lambics I normally choose though more of a niche offering to my palate. I prefer a faro or a framboise to be honest."
""
""
""
"Overall this was a super solid gueuze but not amazing or mind blowing. Not a style I seek out but I can appreciate when the flavor profile is stellar and really has that pop. Worth while to seek out for fans of ths style for sure."
""
""
"O: Off in the color department, but interesting in its own right. Very good gueuze. The color on this one makes it jump out apart from the others in the tasting. Otherwise, it is competitive with all of them."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable. Extremely smooth and easy drinking Gueuze. In the same level of a Drie Fonteinen or a Cantillon. Mandatory to wild beer lovers"
"O-I have limited gueuze experience, but this beer was a real pleasure. Complex, drinkable, and pleasing with a great mixture of fruit, yeast, funk, and body that left me wanting to drink more."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: An absolute delight to drink. One I'm so glad I got to have and one I would gladly buy in quantity."
""
""
""
""
"O- well done gueuze it up their as a top in the style right behind 3F,Cantillion, would buy this any time i see it"
""
""
"Overall an excellent showing of my favorate style and i've got a few to save."
""
""
""
"Fantastic - this has matured nicely since I got my mitts on it. Sour, dry and fruity; delicious. Good balance, the acidity isn't overpowering and the taste is clean and bright. A must-try lambic - grab one and age it for a while."
""
""
""
"O: Okay, but not great. Needs some age."
"O: A good entry gueuze. This exhibits all the standards things you'd find, but isn't to sour or funky."
""
"O: Overall, very good.  As I said above, not as puckeringly sour as I remember, and that level of sour was what I was hoping for, but very good nonetheless.  Glad I was able to get ahold of a bottle from one of the reportedly only 7 cases to hit the entire state of SC (not sure if it's true but that's the rumor I heard).  Definitely worth seeking out.  "
""
""
"Overall this is very enjoyable, perhaps not as good as some, but definitely a high quality gueuze none the less."
"375ml, 2011. This gueuze pours a medium bodied, hazy sunset orange in color with a soapy and bright white one finger head. The nose is mellow and citrusy. It smells more like a Fantome saison than most gueuze out there. It's strange for a gueuze to lack acidity like this does but it has a great nose nonetheless. Uh oh, this is über sessionable. The flavors are light and citrusy. There is a lot of freshly squeezed orange, plenty of rhind, and light acidic tartness. It drinks perfectly. The funk levels in this one are minimal. This drinks perfectly for the style. It is light and very smooth. The drinkability on this one is through the roof! I could drink this by the liter. This instantly jumps into my top few gueuze status. Great beer!"
""
"Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a two and half pillowy white head. Apple, pear, citrus,and vinegar with oak accents on the nose. An opening salvo of tartness fills the mouth. Luscious citrus and other fruit tones, sourdough-like yeasty esters and funk dominate the midpalate, finishes tart and dry. Perfect level of carbonation, smooth and clean mouthfeel. This gueze reaches a level most others fall well short of. Among the very best."
""
"Overall – I haven't had much experience with this style of beer, but it seemed to be more complex tasting than some of the others Gueuze's I've had. It wasn't simply just a blast of citric/vinegar.. it had subtle nuances to it. Very good stuff, thanks again Phyl21ca!"
"D - Sort of a dark horse that I really knew nothing of beforehand. I like the lightness of the funk with the cleanliness of the drink. Makes for something easily drinkable for just one person."
""
""
"O- A pretty damn good gueuze, very tasty and incredibly drinkable."
""
""
""
"Pours a murky orange with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some lemon-like aromas. Taste is much the same with some sour apple peel flavors. There is an acidic finish with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good gueuze with some great aromas and flavors."
""
"O: this is an incredibly refreshing gueuze with tons of character and complexity. It does a great job balancing palate numbing tartness with a bit of funk."
""
""
""
"o-quality beer, that I would buy more of. Good presentation of the style to a buddy of mine that shared this beer with me."
"Overall: I'm a fan of this beer. I would have been alright if the tart levels were a tad higher, but I still enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"O: A nice gueuze. Was pleasantly surprised when it was revealed that this was 1882. Would certainly get this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome beer, I will look for an older one."
"O: Very enjoyable and refreshing in a funky sort of way. I really found this one to be easy to drink and definitely one to enjoy again."
""
"A different take on the gueuze style that I'd happily give a small role in my regular rotation."
"Excellent gueuze, it has made me forgive its less than dry finish and less than desired funk with a brisk tartness and bold taste. I recommend it, enjoy!"
""
""
""
"O- One of the best of my favorite style :)"
""
""
""
"Medium to medium-light bodied with perfectly suited, moderately noticeable carbonation that generates a rather smooth and flowing mouthfeel. Finish is quite dry."
"My first non-American ""wild"". Cork says, ""2011"". Pours a bright orange with a touch of pink. Thick fluffy white head that recedes to a solid ring. Smell is definite brett funk, woody, musty, moldy but in a ""clean"" way if that makes sense. I also get an aroma like that of the closet that holds the bin that holds my daughter's diapers, not in a bad way, but kind of in the way that you like to smell your own fart. Some bright citric fruits behind the funk, lemon, lime, sour apple. Taste is sour, but not overpoweringly so, a nice soft lactic sourness...which is starting to turn a bit more acetic as it warms up. Just a touch of bitterness to balance it out. The funk on the palate is somewhat subdued as compared to the nose but it is still good. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, exactly what I would expect. Overall this is a complex brew that evolves in the glass, nothing absolutely blows my mind but a great beer, worth seeking out and not too difficult to find."
""
""
"Kiddwhiz highly recommended this brew. Cork reads 2011. Poured to tulip. The beer pours a slightly hazy rich golden color with orange edges in the light. Nice big 2.5 finger slightly off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Looks very good.The aroma is a mix of a mild sour note with a pleasant malty sweetness underneath. Hints of fruit, apples, as well. The flavor presents itself with a more acidic note than anticipated based on the nose. Mildly bitter with some biscuity-malt character compliments the slight citrus sour flavor. Mouthfeel is lighter and crisp. Overall, this is a very good Gueze. I appreciate that the sour doesn't just dominate your face, instead it's presence really presents itself well. Enjoyed and recommended."
""
"This is my new favorite gueuze. It is perfectly balanced with the citrus, funk, and sourness all in balance. While I tend to like extremely funky brews it is nice to experience a good balance. A top notch brew."
"O - Not my favorite gueuze but still very good. Just not enough sweetness in flavor and too much funk."
""
"Again, I feel a little ashamed that I walk by these all the time in the search for something new and exotic. In terms of gueuzes, this is excellent, and certainly one of the top few beers regularly on shelf here. Will not be passing by this as frequently...."
""
""
""
"M-very nice mouthfeel with a lot of drinkability except may be a bit sour to drink more than one. Nice creamy head."
""
""
"Cork on the bottle says 2011, so I think this is a 2009 bottle? Pours into the glass a clear rust orange color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is farm year, mineral, horse sweat, peach. Not all that funky, and has a touch of something sweet in there, but very crisp and refined. The flavor follows the aroma, peach fruits, pears, not a lot of citrus. A hint of sweet, almost vanilla flavor, and of course alot of horsey, farmy, sour minerals. This one is really nice but not as good as the Drei Fonteinen to me."
""
""
"i have noticed minor variations over the years/vintages. this review is for the batch that has 2012 on the cork. pours a light amber with a white head that pops and fizzes, but actually gets some decent life before shrinking to a collar. leaves a little lace as well. nose is divine. citrus, pith, and wood stand out most to me, but there is a heavy undercurrent of funk and something like a live mineral static thing going on as well. it just jumps in to my senses. awesome. taste is crisp, clean, defined, and sour. not crazy sour. medium body that is slick and almost prickly at the same time. clean, refreshing finish. just a beautiful beer that has it's own personality. more of a reserved character than some of it's counterparts, but somehow seems more classy. winner every time."
"The Reveal: Gueuze Girardin 1882 Black Label. This is about spot on from the last time I had this beer. Thanks Alewatcher! I am glad to have tried this beer blind and it is neat that my assessment is about the same. This seems like one Micah helped provide intel on."
""
""
"Overall: Supremely confusing. Very dynamic flavor that is largely foreign. Hints of un-popped popcorn kernels and mold. Very alive (or very dead) tasting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: The flavours may not be horribly complex, but they're spot on for what they're trying to do. Very nicely constructed with the style in mind. Any fan of the style should try this. Not the best gueuze I've had, but a pretty good one."
""
""
"In short: A good Gueuze that's not overly sour/acidic, reminding me of Berliner Weisse."
""
"This poured out as a clear yellowish gold color without much head on top at all. It looks pretty flat actually more like a white wine. The smell of the beer was funky, very strong on the nose of wild fermentation. The taste was tart and dry much like most Gueuze Lambic's. The mouthfeel was smooth, not highly caronated at all and quite dry. Overall it's getting a little easier for me to drink these brews but they're still not my cup of tea really. I can't say I'd order it again but I'm happy to have at least tried it."

"Big thanks goes out to the BA (don't have spreadsheet in front of me) who traded this one with me in-person a long time back! 2005 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained very minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour apples, vinegar, funk, earth, and subtle tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, big funk, earth, tart, and very subtle fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really happy with how well this one held up with time. The funk was QUITE forward, but not in an invasive way. A really well done brew that I plan to buy many more of for my cellar. I suggest you do the same!"
""
""
"I can see where they were aiming, and they hit it. They went for straight barnyard funk and sour apple vinegar. It could improve with a little bit more lasting flavors and a touch of cirtic tartness. But i nit pick. One hell of a beer and a good replacement if Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen isnt around."
""
"O: As an American hop head, this is the kind of beer I never thought I'd be seeking out, but once you get a taste of a good sour.. your life will change. Every sip is to be cherished with a beer this good."
""
"O - I am learning to love this style and this is one of the better examples. It has a very nice fruity character and the funk isn't overpowering. Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
""

"Great funk and fruit, both displaying balance. An outstanding gueuze for the availability. On par or maybe even exceeding Drie Fonteinen."

"A very good gueuze with a particularly great aroma, though I've had much better tasting ones within the style."
"O: This beer is really quite funky. It is sweet for a gueuze, but balanced by significant sourness. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, a terrific beer well deserving of its high rating."
"This isn't the best gueuze I've had, but was still fun to try. Looked very appealing, nice bright copper color. Smell was pleasantly funky and sour. It started off nice and sour with lots of lemon and apples, but the finish was rather sweet for my liking. Very champagne like in finish and mouthfeel. Interesting beer, not my favorite gueuze."
"Drinkability – This is a nice gueuze. One of the better tart beers I’ve had."
"Overall: A quintessential example of its style, the Girardin Gueuze 1882 is an experience not to be missed. Intense to the unaccustomed, but a worthwhile endeavor for the connoisseur. Treat yourself to a bottle, and discover a piece of beer folklore."
"Overall - I'm pegging this one down in the overall because it's very tart-centric. I craved some horse blanket and was somewhat let down. I do think that it accentuates the flavors it has so well, though, that it's still an excellent beer. I found myself increasing the ratings as I drank the beer and wrote this review."
"O - I love this stuff it has a very good tartness to it but its not over bearing like a lot of American wilds so the heart burn doesn't kick in after every sip if you like sours this is a must try classic example"
"Dry, brown ales will always hold a special place in my heart, but damn, this might be my new go-to dink. Goes great with food - particularly salads or stir-fries - and works well as a refreshing beverage on its own. Cheers!"
"I don't have much experience in gueuzes and after the smell was a bit worried, but the tartness more than balanced out the funk and it ended up being a very enjoyable beer."
"O: I'd definitely recommend this as a beer with food. By itself, the finish is a bit too much. However, together with food, it's delightful and palate cleansing. I'd grab this again if I had a chance."
"750ml bottle served in a Flute glass.Enjoyed on mar´11.Pours light golden copper in color.Foggy.Fading,medium bubble, 0,5cm frothy head.Foam is yellowish white in color.Wet earth & wet grass aromas on nose,rounded by granny smith apple & citric hues.Dry tartar mouthfeel not crispy but vivant.Citrics attack on the aftertaste while leaving such an smooth sour taste.Carbonic is well balanced.Not founded as refreshing as expected but ligth body makes it very drinkable."
"Overall: A true classic!"
"Highly carbonated, which impacts the front of the tongue, followed by the sourness and astringency. Feels substantial for a lambic."
"O: Good stuff. I'm really happy about this one. I really dig the balance on the nose, additionally the flavor profile is really satisfying. Man, I wish this genre were more accessible and less expensive.."
"Overall- The sour comes out swinging then falls off fairly quick; this is great, but I can only imagine what few years would do to this by rounding itself out and probably drying out more. Going to have to grab a handful for the cellar."
"O- Very nice gueuze drink here. Its a good sour to have as it isn't overly sour. Easier to drink I think. Thanks for sharing Scott, glad I got to try this!"
"O- Believe this is the first geuze I have had and right now it's not really my thing. Probably scored lower due to personal taste rather than the actual quality of the beer. I am a big fan of sours and lambik's, but this just didn't do much for me. Although, I will revisit the style again I am sure."
"O: Solid gueuze, not the best that I have had but very delicious and refreshing none the less."
"O - A wonderful gueuze. Not as soft or as complex a 3F, but I'm enjoying the aggressive sourness immensely. At the price, it will be hard to purchase as frequently as other gueuzes, but if you have not had this you must seek it out."
"Very, very good. All so supple and melded, and tasting more balanced and mellow than many others. Gorgeous."
"O: Much better than the first in this style that I had. Not as funky as a taste. Much mellower. Allows you to really taste the fruity sourness."
"Appearance 4, Aroma 4, Taste 4, Mouthfeel 5, Overall 4"
"Amazing balance. It retains the lambic sourness but in such a good way that it is now one of the benchmarks I have to go off of. I wish I could find this a lot more often. When I find it again though, I have dibs on a case. Spectacular sour balance, even with the sourness being completely over the top. Among my favourite beers ever."
"M/D - creamy texture and dry. I could drink it everyday."
"O - Not the best gueze I've had. This is a fresh bottle so I may grab another bottle to sit on for a year or so."
"Overall: A great and widely available geuze beer."
"D - really solid gueze here. Lots of citrusy, mouth puckering sourness, but not over the top with it. Good balance between the funk and the sour. I am going to have to seek some more of these out and lay them down."
"Overall it's fine, but is probably not one of my favorites for this style. Doesn't seem as big a fruit profile, and missing some of the real arid dry character I like. Drinkable for what it is I'll give it that for sure, it would be neat to do a side by side comparison with some others, but I just am not feeling this one as much, and that's being totally honest with myself. Not feeling it."
"Overall: Gueuze: Favorite beer style? YES, well assuming all the beers are this good. I thoroughly enjoyed this. It is most certainly a beer I will have again."
"Pours a hazed golden amber, active head with good retention and lacing. Scent dominated by the funkyness and sourness from the brett - earthy damp wood and mud, fresh dried grain malt profile. Taste follows scent, put together nicely, a mild blend compared to some others in the style, the brett never over powers the palate and it doesnt become puckering, quite refreshing. Lighter side of medium bodied, bone dry. A nice gueuze that doesnt push any of the strong notes over the top."
"Overall-- very nice. A solid gueuze for the price and even more so considering the fact it's on shelves!"
"This is a nice gueuze. The initial flavor is a nice sour fruit and it erupts into a deep bitter finish."
"The reveal: Girardin Gueuze 1882 (Black Label). Awesome! I definitely read about this one being a classic example of a gueuze, but haven't seen it anywhere around me. Really glad I got to try this one, thanks a ton Khaz!"
"Overall: Not the best but one of the better gueuzes out there"
"Pleasant sourness and mostly a great example of the style. Lacking in effervescence and lack of head formation/retention are points for improvement. Flavor and aroma could use additional complexity but this is one still one to be savored."
"Taste is tart and sharp, very crisp and clean and much less funky and horse blanket-y than the likes of anything 3F. Mouthfeel is light and smooth with a good bitter & sour bite that really rounds it out. I wasn't sure what to expect but this did not disappoint."
"O - When I can't find cantillon classic geuze, i go for black label and it never dissapoints. It's sour and tart without overwhelming, but is still a beast in its' own right."
"Overall its good, but the taste is nothing special."
"d- really nice, i've been waiting to try this bad boy forever, and finally decided to seize the day and crack this one open. wonderful, refreshing, stellar gueuze. this is amongst the best that i've had, i would gladly drink this again."
"O: I now understand the love for this brew. This is readily available in downtown DC... and, I plan on getting a few more bottles."
"O- All the components are there for a great gueuze and with a few years on it, this baby will really shine. I wonder who I know has a few bottles from around 2005? The generosity of beerwolf77 never ends."
"The Girardin Gueuze was ultimately the more pleasant of the two. It begins dry and sweet, crisp with a great refreshment both from the light gravity and the awesome effervescence. The close and the aftertaste, however, are a total upheaval of everything you notice at the beginning. A yeasty, throat drying ripple grows from the back of your mouth and makes you feel like your throat is the culture for the brewer's next batch. I've never used ""medicinal"" in a positive way, but it's a useful way to describe such a unique, drying sensation. This particular beer was pretty costly at $12 for a ~300ml bottle. All the same, it was an awesome first for the style and an awesome beer overall. Would love to try this both a day after and a few years after bottling."
"This beer showcases a nice, medium straw yellow, nice white head formation and thin lacing. Excellent and intriguing smell, lots of citric fruits, oranges, lemon and lime. Distinct pepper and bready yeast as well. Taste is very tart, focusing on lemon and lime sourness with grapes and pear. There is a slight biscuity quality mixed in with the yeast. Slight candy sweetness that is mainly muted by the sour. Crisp and light feel to it. Overall a nice gueuze and I will be definitely drinking more of these whenever I can get it."
"O- this is a great gueuze and clearly a stand out for the style. Up against the excellent briney oysters this was a pairing made in heaven."
"amber/orange color with a slight hint of carbonation, showing almost no head whatsoever. fruity, funky and dry aroma. the taste is sour and mouthwatering, with a zingy mouthfeel. very crisp and refreshing. overall, solid gueuze, we did this on a gueuze tasting night and this one came out on top."
"Had this beer after the Girardin Kriek. Pours cloudy yellow brown with a nice big quickly fading head. Aroma is sour with a funky wet horse blanket, hay, yeast, with strong tart citrus undertones. Flavor is snappy cheek puckering sour. Lemon, wet hay, horse hair, and white vinegar. They all take turns and really shine together. Palate is dry and tart. A complex and super tasty brew."
"M/D: Very well balanced, a great looking smelling and tasting beer. I was expecting a little more sourness on the tongue. Great, smooth Gueuze."
"Drink- The tart acidity and sweet strike a good balance. Gueuze's are really starting to grow on me after having a few of the top in style. I will be sure to come back to this one."
"1882 Black Label is quite simply a spectacular, world class beer. Buy it, drink it, go to bed happy."
"Girardin Gueuze pops out with a straw yellow look with some slight faded bronze in color. A stealth pour yeilded a small white cap, eventually nothing, no lace. Im liking the nose on this, smelling like a typical gueuze but more well rounded. Not so much dank basement, more of a mix between musk, hay and some fruit. Taste blew me away, first sips were marvelous. A nice hit of sour apple, with some barnyard notes, lime, and some earthy hops in the fresh bottle. Quite sour on the tounge and swishing it around makes for best results. The sour stays a bit than fades, the feel is light bodied and the carb is spritzy. I like this Gueuze, a winner in my eyes."
"D: A well balanced sour @ only 5%. Refreshing, easy to drink."
"D: I can't imagine a traditional sour being any easier to drink. Normally ""refreshing"" isn't a term I'd use to describe a sour, but this actually was surprisingly refreshing. Overall this is a really good beer, but I don't think it's good enough to purchase at the current price point."
"D-very drinkable."
"D. Delicious - ""I'd put this on par with supplication"" (a reminder to myself about how good it was - not a note on similarity, which I managed to forget since the sour tasting) I do recall this doing surprisingly well at the tasting"
"Very drinkable. Would prefer this in the summertime. Good thirst quencher. Love me some sours."
"You may not think so, but this is an awesome beer for food pairing. Particular dishes can really bring out a whole other side to the Gueuze, and vise-versa. Try it with caprese for instance. The creaminess and milky flavor of the fresh mozzarella will play well with the acidity and sour tang of the beer. Also, the tomatoes and basil share similar flavors with the beer. Mussels and fries, grilled vegetables, and richly sauced cuts of meat will be nice pairings too. As for cheese, try Girardin Gueuze with Delice de Bourgogne. This is a triple-cream cow's milk cheese from the Burgundy region of France. The creaminess will go well with the sour acidity of the beer, much like how an acidic wine can cut through the fat of a creamy cheese."
"D - It's a nicely drinkable sour beer with a good flavor but the carbonation is a little low for this style I feel. Otherwise a very nice Gueuze."
"It is an interesting one. I have an older vintage in the cellar which i will give a long age and then try this one again."
"D-Very pleasing and highly drinkable compared to my other experience with Gueuze. I was not expecting the level of bitterness though, but it's not a negative characteristic."
"for me, the drinkability is off the charts. I highly reccomend this beer for both Gueuze fans and newcomers to the style. easily one of my new favorites"
"D- Moderately high. This is a very tasty gueuze. Very lemony."
"D: I love Gueuzes and this fine beverage measures up to the style in magnificent fashion. Cheers."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow with some pure white foam that settles into a nice ring. The smell is not particularly strong and is definitely focused more on the musty, chalky, minerally, funky, at times cheesy aspects as opposed to straight in your face acidity. Slight amounts of green apple and lemon poking through but not fruit forward. The taste brings more tartness into the profile while maintaining a really good funky mustiness. Definite mineral component reminiscent of wet stone. Light acedic acid, definitely not overpowering, more cider like. Has almost a yeasty taste that I associate with saisons. Mild underripe green fruitiness that's slightly bitter, almost a stem-like or peel quality instead of a fleshy burst of flavor. Mouthfeel is a little flat for me but this beer is insanely drinkable, I could drink liters of it. Very refreshing and complex enough to keep it interesting but not overpoweringly sour. This bottle went quite quickly."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The head is big and foamy white. The color is a dull golden, very hazy and lots of carbonation rising to the top. Lacing is strong. The aroma is fruity, grassy, and old back of the closet dust. The taste is tart throughout. Hits the back of the tongue and makes you tweek a bit. Fresh yogurt comes to mind. Not as tart as some Cantillons I have had but strong. The body is light, but with heavy carbonation it made me feel fuller. A great example to enjoy a bottle at a time."
"D - Excellent drinkablity, this is right in my comfort zone. An exceptional Gueuze, I'll continue to seek this out whenever I can."
"Pours an almost clear golden, with a small persistent head. Bubbles continuously flowing up from the bottom of the tulip glass, nice looking beer. Smell is full of dusty funk, brett, and tartness. Taste is very bright and citrusy. Lemons and sour apples. A good amount of lactic sour, without a lot of acetic character. Excellent lambic. Mouthfeel is lively, slightly puckering, and finishes dry. Taking style into account on drinkability, this one goes down pretty easy. It's sour, but not ripping my mouth apart, so I could drink it easily. But a lambic of this quality should be enjoyed over a good amount of time. Overall, an excellent gueuze that is easy to get a hold of."
"D: highly drinkable"
"This beer is really creamy. Great amount of carbonation. I think I need to go buy some mussels and fries."
"certainly one of the best gueze still being produced."
"Conclusion: I think this is one of the best beers I have tasted. Truly exceptional in almost every way. What an interesting style of beer this is, I feel you could drink it for years and still not fully comprehend the flavors and aromas- something that cannot be said for most American styles of beer. It is one of my goals as a home brewer to brew something that is akin to this style."
"this was good, great flavor. i cannot wait to see what my other bottle does with some time on it."
"The CPJ"
"D: Well this is as drinkable as it gets for my money. Wonderful in every category. If I had ready access to this beer I would swear off all other beers and drink this exclusively."
"D - Really great example of what a gueuze should be. Seems like it would be a great introduction to the style fr anyone just getting into sour ales. Will seek this one out again to see what some age does to it."
"375ml bottles, 2009 batch I believe. Pours mostly clear hay gold with a snowy head. (Raising my rating for this thanks to a couple bottles at our lambic tasting over the weekend. No notes on this, but each bottle was exceedingly better than my virgin bottle). Nice lemon, funk, sour, and dry flavors. Very expressive and balanced. Good stuff, one of the best standard geuzes from what we enjoyed."
"D- Simply put: there need to be more 5% beers that taste like this. the tastes seem to slowly become less and less special as the beer goes on but they still taste wonderful. i think i'll always be able to buy this beer and enjoy it at any time. i really hope i get this beer again, as well as explore more in to the style."
"Poured a hazy golden yellow color with a big white head that diminishes quickly. Very loud bubbling as well. Scent EXTREMELY funky and sour. I definitely get a farmhouse/horse blanket aroma from this particular beer. I also pick up cheese aromas and lemon. Very interesting and delightful smelling beer. Taste is SUPER SOUR! I love it! Initially I get funky yeast flavors followed by lemon and cheese notes. The mouth-puckering sourness doesn't stop the amazing flavors from coming through this beer. Some grassy notes as well. Mouthfeel is very dry and very crisp. Full-bodied and puckering. Drinkability is high for me on this one. I've realized that I'm really becoming a huge fan of lambics, wild ales, and gueuzes. This is an outstanding beer!"
"This is probably the most sour beer I've tried. Excellent gueuze."
"D - This is a bit too sour for me. I enjoy sours, but this one is a bit too one-sided. Not very balanced in my opinion. The low ABV makes it drinkable, but i think i will finish this one and not need to buy another for a while."
"The finish is bone dry, as it should be. Accompanied by a lively spritzy body, the feel is phenomenal. The sourness is intense and shocks the palate a bit. Extremely easy to drink...refreshing and satisfying. This is a really good beer that I will definitely be revisiting."
"D- Very easy to drink, I wish it was cheaper so I could buy more. This really stands out as the best Gueuze I have had. What I really love about this beer is the perfect balance between sour and funk in my opinion."
"drinkability: a fantastic sour ale. Will drink again..."
"(D)- A standard for the style for sure. My bottle is extremely fresh, so I can only see this getting better over time. A smooth example without being a palate melting sour bomb. Ridiculously drinkable."
"Drinkability - One and done, but very enjoyable to have with some gouda cheese. Will definitely pick up another one or two to cellar."
"D- I sampled this at the wine shop today and was disappointed. Doesn't compare to Drie Fonteinen, Hannsens, or Cantillon. If I had paid to drink this I would have regretted it."
"There is a strange smell that goes with this beer. I can't define it. Pretty sour taste, or better said much too sour. I am cured for a while!"
"D- Low alcohol but this is a sipper."
"A golden hazy pour with a bit of head. Tart and funky smell that has both sour and funk characteristics. Tastes like a nice balance between the two. Definitely sour, but complex and funky. Well carbonated. A smooth sippable beer that I would definitely drink again"
"A personal favorite!"
"Freaking love this beer. A remarkably flavorful Gueuze, but without the heartburn that accompanies some of its more acidic brethren. More than deserving of its lofty BA ranking."
"A rare beer that is both refreshing and complex. Love the gueuze."
"This would go awesome with some sharp cheeses and old funky meats... I liked this one a lot..."
"Absurdly effervecent beer, the tight head never let down the whole time I sipped this beer. Some clinging spotty lacing. Nice hazy amber gold color. Pungent aroma of lemon, brett (the wet hay varity), pinapple, and oak. Lots of citrus up front and through the mid palate. Oaky with some good sourness, but not lip-puckering. Rather a dry experiance. I pick up a tad of tobacco, more oak, plenty of tart apple. Underlying wheat flavor is pie crust like. The mouthfeel is zingy and lively. This geuze dances over the tongue. Oh yeah I could have plenty of these."
"A very good pretty well balanced gueuze."
"DB- A well rounded lambic on the easy and drinkable side of things. Not too sour or funky but a lot of good fruit and yeast influence going on."
"D- Very Tasty, and drinkable. Great balance of sourness and flavor. An all around excellent gueuze."
"Definitely a great gueuze. Complex, easy to drink. Lots of flavors coming out, a good balance with nothing really taking over anything else. I will definitely hunt down a couple more of these."
"I can understand why this is better than most gueuzes and I'll rate it as such but this style is not for me."
"5.0 D: Definitely a solid gueuze. This is definitely there to help you get a sour fix. Well balanced flavor profile, great taste, and everything else is pleasant. By the end of the bottle I wanted more."
"Poured a moderately cloudy amber/tan like apple cider. Lemony aroma. First sip is a jaw-clenching tartness of lemon juice and green apple. Once the initial shock wears off, tart white wine and fresh oak notes emerge. Tartness moderates well throughout, with a bit of barnyard funkyness at the end. Toward the very end some overripe, almost spoiled, orchard fruit notes march past."
"D: I think this bottle is not as the brewer intended to be seeing as how there is no carbonation, and previous reviews ( and the style) would suggest there should be much more."
"Bottle. Pours a slighlty hazy amber orange color with a light wispy head. Sour tart aroma with slight acetone notes. Some funky barnyard notes as well with lemon zest. Tart, slightly mouthpuckering...oh yeah, this is tasty. Tart grape flavors. Light mouthfeel. Some lingering barnyard funkiness at the end. Overall a very, very tasty beer."
"Light yet powerful! So surprised by the 5."
"D: Awesome."
"Drinkability -- This one is quite sour and very dry; a pleasant experience, but one glass is enough. While it certainly didn't fall short of my expectations I'm not sure if I'm willing to say it's the best gueuze I've had just yet. Absolutely worth trying and clearly a shining example of the style that cannot be missed."
"Overall, a very good gueze. Lots of great flavors and I wish this one was around MN. Very drinkable for how sour it is."
"D - Unlike a lot of really tart/sour beers, this actually gets more drinkable as you go, as the sourness kind of fades as it sits out. Very good beer."
"Overall, probably the best gueze I have ever had. Balanced, flavorful, and perfectly blended while still managing to be crisp and refreshing. Delicious and complex. Highly recommended."
"D: Holly cow this one was fun. Super refreshing and a welcome wake up for my taste buds. I could easily drink this beer again and again."
"Pours a cloudy dark honey color, no head. Astringent smell of oak, sweet tarts, and the dying remnants of malt sweetness. After a few sips to acclimatize my palate to the bracing sour pucker I detect a flavor profile that while not the best, does the trick. Oaky tannins, souir grape, lactic, citric acid with a slight tannic pucker at the very back of the tongue after the liquid passes through. This is quite dry, yet leaves the mouth watering for another sip. The tannic back bite reminds me of when you eat the strongly bitter pith of a citrus fruit, minus the bittersweet reward of the sweet fruit. I wish there was more opening up in this glass, but almost sadly not. ""Almost"" because this is a satisfying drink while still remaining on the periphery of what I am seeking out in it."
"Notes: Very good gueuze. Not quite as sour/tart as others, but it still showcases those flavors. Overall a very good beer that could be a good introduction into sours for someone."
"The carbonation was zippy and tight. The body was medium but never heavy. So easy to drink."
"D: This beer is very drinkable for the style and the complexity of the sour flavors will bring me back to having another one of these in the future."
"This gueuze is quite drinkable and has a decent amount of sour, but not overwhelming. Oak comes through nicely. A refreshing gueuze, but lacking a little bit in the complexity department. However, with a couple years of age this could turn into an excellent beer. Looks like I'll be picking up a few more for the cellar. Worth checking out if you like the style."
"This one certainly lived up to the hype. Good stuff."
"Bottle thanks to probstk. Massive gusher, half my living room floor is coated with gueuze. Apple and peach aromas, beautiful gueuze aromas. Taste is a beautiful balance of moderate sourness and natural sweetness, lots of apples and tropical fruits. Very good gueuze, I prefer this one over the Cantillon's."
"shared this with some friends over the weekend. lots of funk in the aroma, almost horseshit like but i wouldn't have it any other way. there was some tart fruit aromas as well. the taste was sour and tart like green apples. i'm not very familiar with gueuzes but this met my expectations."
"D - This is all just one note, SOUR. Just overwhelming and not pleasant to drink for me. Maybe I am not a gueuze fan."
"D - It seems that every time I try one of the classic Belgian examples of this style, I am impressed. At least in my area, these are not at all rare - very easy to get. I find myself wondering why I ever spend time and effort to get some of the rarer American versions of the style that seem to cost an arm and a leg in trade - granted they are good, but with fine examples of the style like this readily available, it doesn't make sense. This is truly an amazing gueuze, one that I will certainly have again and again."
"D: Light enough to be refreshing, complex enough to be interesting. Perhaps the perfect summer beer for the beer geek."
"Looks good, two fingers of head, clear straw colored body. just a solid looking beer that looks like you'd expect....but whats awesome is even from a foot away looking at it the aroma reaches out and grabs you and pulls you in, just forces you closer. Not as funky as expected but it's there, along with some lemon and sourdough. The flavors seem kinda thin, while it is a really dry beer, i would hope for more of a fullness, but all the flavors are attractive and inticing, mosty a huge amount of lemons leading the way, but some funky wet straw, a light vinegarette, and green apple. the mouthfeel is very good, its overall quite a dry beer, but not at all bitting and bitter until the end, it doesnt start off right away, you have to wait for it. only knock is i would like just a bit more carbination."
"Pours a dark but clearish gold with huge head from intense carbonation and dies very slow. A powerfully tart and funky aroma greets my nose with hints of tart cherry or grape as well as applle or pear - sourness is strong as well. Real smooth and creamy medium body surprised me as there is a nice mild sweet fruit taste along with sour, tart fruit tastes such as grape, apple. Passes slick but there is a a slight woodiness to this beer one expects from this style and the finish is very crisp and pleasant thanks to the carbonation. A very, very good sipper."
"Great drinkability for the style - nothing offensive or ""off"" about this one that makes you hesitate to grab another mouthful."
"d - A pretty good gueuze. This beer is very funky and tarty, and if you like that, you'll probably like this beer a lot. Would have again."
"Wow, this is definitely a solid, top candidate gueuze. Loads of funkiness and tart...just like it should be. Very smooth, somewhat late fruit notes...medium body...atleast for a gueuze. The oak and wood aspect is perfect! Well rounded, nice carbonation, and a great drinker. Well done!"
"12.7 fl. oz. caged and corked bottle served in my Allagash chalice at 53 degrees. No idea how to read the dating, but there was a 2010 on the cork. Poured a semi-translucent tawny, orange-gold with a rocky, two inch bright white head that slowly receded, leaving cloud-like strands of lacing as it dissipated into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Wonderful nose - a hint of cork upfront, followed by some green apple skins, a suggestion of grapefruit and a faint, grassy/earthy quality. The smell alone has started my salivary glands. Taste follows nose; however, the grapefruit and acidity really comes out and masks the green apple suggested by the nose. Some cork and wood expresses itself at the finish. Moutfeel is light, with a carbonation level that falls just short of sparkling. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks and finishes semi-dry. A delicious and refreshing beer on a warm humid day. Not as sour as some Gueuze's that I've tried; however, delicious and extremely easy-drinking. Glad I finally got the opportunity to try this."
"50-55deg, fluted glass"
"Holly crap this is good stuff. This is a must for all the sour heads out there. Though this is incredibly complex as well. Just amazing. A world class beer. Get it if you see it."
"Probably the most drinkable sample of the style I have had."
"D: love my sour beers and this is no exception. Great offering from the girardin brewery."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is good, light and tart without slapping the tongue. This is a very drinkable Gueuze that is a credit to its style."
"Pours a cloudy golden with about an inch of head. There is lots of sediment visible around the base of the glass. The aroma is faintly citrusy with a huge amount of funk. The taste is incredibly sour while refreshing at the same time. The taste is almost the equivalent of taking a shot of tequila and then chasing it with a half and half mixture of lime juice and mountain dew. It's actually a very pleasant taste."
"The mouthfeel is nice and light. Good carbonation. Extremely dry and puckering finish keeps me coming back for more. What an amazingly drinkable and easily accessible sour. I will be revisiting this one more than a few times over the hot summer months."
"Drinkability: Well, a great gueuze brings you back in with each sip, though a sessionable beer this is not, despite the low ABV. A beer to be slowly sipped and enjoyed"
"D: This was quite fantastic. I'm getting into lambic more, and $9 for this bottle was a worthwhile purchase. But I think I'd stick with Cantillon Classic in the future -- I'll have to get it again soon and remind myself what the difference is."
"D-this is very tasty but it is so tart and sour. The flavors are very good and blend together very nicely. Nothing is too strong to keep a nice complex balance."
"D - The only thing preventing me from drinking more of this is the price (~$10 for a 375ml bottle), and the danger of sour stomach. This is a wonderful gueuze that is highly overlooked (or as overlooked as a Top 100 beer can be) due to its relatively wide availability. A lot of the rare beers that are drooled over aren't nearly as good as this stuff."
"Drinkability was by no means something to significantly mark down on, but it felt heavier in my stomach than other gueuzes or sours with a similar (pretty low) ABV."
"D- This is an awesome gueze. The sourness is there and its pretty big but its kept in check by the complexity and other characters in the brew. Wonderfully put together and a great beer overall."
"Green bottle with a cork ref cx2010. Opens with a loud pop and fizz. Pours a light orange color with a white head that receeds to a thin lace on top of the beer with spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is both funky and tart with musty yeasty notes and some citrus zip in the back of the aroma. Taste includes some puckering tartness upfront that blends through a very lemon-like citrusy body that finishes sour. As it warms, there are more notes of mustiness and funk. Faint lingerting taste of subtle fruit almost like apricots blended in with the funk and tartness. Light body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable as my mouth salivates to take the next sip. The tartness of this gueze is potent enough to burn the back of the nose and throat yet strangely smooth for a gueze. Very subtle earthiness about this that suggests oak without coming straight forward or bold with the oak characteristics. Very good."
"Orange-gold pour with a big, rocky, white head. Loads of sour funk in the aroma with some hints of chardonnay, oak, green apple, lemon zest, grass, grain, leather, and a little sweetness that i can't quite describe. The acidity and sourness immediately hits the tongue first but then cherry, strawberry, and lemon hints start to develop. The malt flavors are grassy, dry grains. Again the flavor has a little sweetness to it that I'm not sure how to describe. Medium body with lots of carbonation that finishes very dry and clean. This is definitely a well crafted gueuze and the complexity and quality reflect that."
"Girardin Gueuze 1882 is basically the mac daddy of gueuze. Pours with a huge and thick white head, this one is cloudy yellow-gold and as the tide of foam recedes there is a thick carpet of delicate lace left in its wake. The aroma is lemony, floral and sweet but funky and sour at the same time. Tastes lemony, funky, floral, and rosey even. Light to medium bodied with a full but not quite bubbly feel. One of the best. There are so many sours one can trade their proverbial left nut for, but this one is still going to be better than 99% of them."
"Very well carbonated and quite prickly on the tongue. Crisp and refreshing while at the same time being quite astringent, kind of an oxymoron and kind of confusing, but enjoyable..."
"All in all... I've concluded that it is one of my favorite lambics to date."
"The beer pours a hazy brownish-orange color with a white head. The aroma is tartness with some sugar and not much funk. The flavor is tart lemon, oak, vanilla with some citrus and little to no funk. The beer is very, very dry and very juicy tasting. It finishes very tart. Low-medium carbonation and a thin mouthfeel."
"Highly recommended."
"Drinks really well, it's not too mouth puckeringly sour. Well, maybe at first it is a bit, but I adjusted pretty quickly. This is a style I need to get into a bit more, I'm digging it."
"D-One of the more drinkable of the unsweetened gueuzes. I always forget how world class this beer is. Doesn't get the play of a Cantilon or Dries Fontaine but this should be up there as a top gueuze."
"D: Really a hidden gem among all the highly hyped and sought after sours, this humble little beer has got to be one of the best of the bunch. Great balanced flavor with the feel to pull it all together, I hope I get to revisit this one again and again. Despite the nose, which could use a little work, this is simply an exceptional beer."
"Cheers!"
"Overall an excelent example of a gueuze that I was glad I could find."
"will have to revisit, cause i am too blown away"
"This is the first beer of this style that I can honestly say I have enjoyed. Perhaps it is my tastes developing, but this beer needs to get some credit for it."
"Drinkability is good, a well made gueuze with great tartness, but not my favorite."
"D- Well definitely enjoyed having one 375ML bottle but I don't think I would want more then that. Definitely a sipper for me. This is a good beer when I want a change from any of the mainstream, heavily consumed beers."
"I gave a sip of this beer to a friend who has never had a guezue and she described it as piss flavored candy. Its a great beer though. Bright, sour, finishes tart, slightly dry but doesn't dry the mouth out. A slight funk on the backend, medium to low bodied. An overall really good gueuze and a good beer."
"Pours a hazy honey yellow color with white head that fades to a nice lace on top of the brew. OK lacing too. Smell is largely tart lemon peel, some wood, crisp green apple, maybe a hint of funk. Taste follows suit, though adding in some vingegar notes. Sour apple and lemon zest dominate. Some yeastiness too. Lots of flavor, dry on the finish, but definitely causes the salivary glands to do some work. Very drinkable, a real treat for sure."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy gold/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is tart/sour apples, vinegar, lemon peel and some funk. The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like tart green apples, lemon, funk, and a bit of yeast and peaches. Nice lingering tart finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has good carbonation and finishes dry. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable to drink. Overall I think this is a very good gueuze, I'll definitely pick this up again the next time I find a bottle."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with above average carbonation. Overall, I don't have much experience with sours yet, but from what I have had of the style this is a very good one. It has almost a candy like sweet tartness to it that makes it very tasty and drinkable."
"Overall, this is great. Easily the best and most drinkable gueze out there."
"I drank this after drinking DDG earlier, and I must say, they're pretty darn close. $$$-wise, this is a bargain compared to DDG."
"D: This is a delicious complex beverage that needs to be experienced. Once of the best lambics I've ever had."
"D – This is very nice, though it is more of a rare treat than it is a regular option."
"D - Well, for a gueuze I suppose this is more drinkable than the few others I've sampled. I think I'll actually finish this bottle, but I still don't think I'd consider this a ""pleasant"" experience. Gueuzes aren't my thing, but I do like to try one ever so often. Maybe the style is *slightly* growing on me, or maybe 1882 is a milder, more drinkable brew in an already challenging style."
"D - this is the best 10 gueze I think I've ever had. Being relatively easily available, I look forward to returning to it regularly"
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"D- Highly drinkable gueuze. Most are this low in alcohol, but some have such high acidity that they can't be handled in large quantities. I wouldn't mind trying a large quantity of this."
"This one has a nice pour, a clear copper color with a two finger head that dissolves down to a fine film that leaves a touch of lacing. Surprisingly clear for an unfiltered brew. Nose is drying funky sourness up front, then some champagne, lots of fruitiness (apricots?). Cracker-y breadiness (if that makes sense) shows up just a bit. Huge flavor to this one. Flavor is likewise - obviously stronger on the funky sourness, and a little milder on the fruits. A touch of cheese and white wine. Tasty brew, if you're feeling like a sour one. Body is busy with strong carbonation that highlights the tartness well. Overall, a very nice brew, although I'm not sure if I could drink more than one."
"D - Very drinkable with a good level of acidity and nice complexity. I particularly enjoy the peach character of the flavor, it is a somewhat unusual flavor to find in a lambic and quite pleasant."
"Drinkability is not bad for sure, but one is definitely plenty for a sitting in my opinion. I'd much prefer drinking a lambic that isn't one of the best I've had over drinking just an okay beer of most other styles. So I can't [/shouldn't] complain too much..."
"Upon buying this, I didn't know that this was a sour beer. As for sour beers...I still don't like them. Pours a very clear gold with relatively no haze. All the sediment settled in the bottom. Very tart, sort of dry, with a hint of cheese. On the palate, dry, tart and a little bit of currant. I wish that I had some food that you eat with wines to go along with this. This was not a good brewday beer. Not a good beer for me, but for people that enjoy lambic sours."
"Taste is tart, citric, with dry apricot, light tangy funky yeast character, light fruity sweetness and faint sweet white wine underneath, and a bit more hard to pin down. It has aftertaste of funky yeasty dough and dry apricot."
"I have tried to score for the style, not my personnal view, otherwise it would have got a few minus numbers!"
"I think this is one of the better examples of gueuze I've had; this is very, very good. The complexity, feel, and quenching nature of this beer add up to outstanding drinkability. And while it is certainly sour, it isn't so sour that it makes my stomach churn."
"Either I got a bad bottle of this., or I am really swimming against the tide. I've enjoyed other lambics I've had, but this was terrible (maybe it's just the gueze style I don't like). This poured a champagne color with little head and some carbonation. Unfortunately, both the nose and taste were a rancid mixture of very sour apples and vinegar. Early on, I kept thinking maybe the sour would be followed by a sweet sensation, a la Flemish Sours, but instead, it just kept getting more sour and acidic. Ended up cleaning the drain."
"Pours a slightly hazy, slightly reddish gold, with a nice bubbly head. Nose is lemony citrus with a nice balanced funk, and the tartness almost puckers the mouth before even tasting it. Flavor is lemon curd or marmalade with strong acidity creating a sublime tart finish. The heavy carbonation contributes a welcome champagne character. At 5% I could drink this all night. Most certainly not a drink for everyone; but if lambic is your thing, you will truly love this. It is one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability off the charts for a sour, would gladly visit this one again!"
"This is a excellent gueuze, and extremely drinkable for the style. The sourness is prominent, but never so powerful that it hinders the drinkability. I found myself liking it more as time went by, and its with some sadness that I finished my glass. Oh well, kriek de ranke up next..."
"D: I love wild beers, and this one certainly lived up to my expectations. It's unfortunate we have to pay so much for these great beers here in the US, because I would love to drink them more often."
"Pours a nice, surprisingly clear orange color, very nice looking, with a massive head, 2 inches, fluffy, cloudy and white. Really a great looking beer. The smell is sweet-tarts and garbage, apple and grape skins, sour tart, old moldy bread. A little bit of spice, some lemon peel, really nice. Though I doubt if I could distinguish it from some others in smell alone. The taste is much richer and more delicious than just sweet tarts, the sour candy like sweetness comes in first, but there's a big powerful bottom af bready, dry malt. There's a note of flowers, some lemon, spice, pepper, nice and yeasty too. I think the taste of the malt is the most distinctive factor, but I also taste strawberries (old ones), tart apple skins, and the dry sting of carbonation is very pleasant. The body is very light, as you would expect, and quite good. The drinkability is much better than you would expect from a wild ale. It keeps me going back forf mlore because its not all tart, dry, sour taste, low on the vinegary acidic tastes, there's something to be said for a malt presence and a nice fruitiness."
"D- easy to finish this bottle and its at a strength that makes it sessionable. however, the acid in this one would rip my stomach apart. a 375 is about perfect for a person."
"O: Unique and complex, refreshing, smooth, very good"
"This is one sour beer. Lip puckering lemony sourness. Flavor is of grapes, pepper, and citrus. Bubbly on the tongue with a medium body. Very clean finish."
"The CX2010 bottling.Drinking this immediately after a Beatification, and a week after a Doesjel, I'm reminded how special this beer is. It is everything a gueuze should be. Soft, delicate, citrusy and bright, with a delicate funk, earthy, mushroomy, less tannic than a 3Font, cleaner and more balanced in sourness with a better blend of citric and lactic acids, softer with a wheaty, dextrinous fullness that tempers the sourness and lends a sweetness. Soft tannins. Juicy. Yum. 4.5/4.75/4.75"
"D: This beer is something special and I'm glad that I had a chance to try this after wanting to try it for so long. The depth, texture and general awesomeness of this beer makes it nearly impossible to put down."
"D = This is a very good gueuze, not sure I can really call it highly drinkable it has such funkiness, but on the other hand, it has a nice dryness that whets the tastebuds and makes me want more."
"Drinkability: I guess this is almost a wash. Definitely a mood beer, that's for sure. Oaky, funky, dry, and sour all at once, and can definitely hit the spot on the right night. Would certainly have again in the future, and a perfect example of what a gueuze should be."
"D - Very drinkable, not at all overly sour. This may be the best gueuze I've ever had."
"D-Absolutely! Super nice, strong and tart without getting ""crazy"". A beautiful brew that is well deserved of it's high ranking."
"Has a very light body, almost delicate. Goes down smooth, but leaves the mouth dry due to the sourness. Overall, a very nice beer."
"Glad I tried it. And it's one of the more inexpensive sours I can get my hands on. Bonus!"
"D - Good stuff, but one is enough."
"J"
"Overall, very nice relatively affordable and easy to find gueuze. Give it a shot if you see it."
"Pours a pale yellow gold with a nice white head. The immediate aroma is an earthy funkiness, barnyard, and quite a bit of acidic tartness. The taste follows in the same direction, with a bit of citrus, and a moutherpuckering sour flavor. A little bit of pale malt eventually comes through toward the end, but this one is sour through and through. Falling only behind Duck Duck Gooze and La Folie in terms of sour drinkability for me."
"D: easy drinking sour beer, fairly good pucker power and a really nice, light flavor. This is so light that almost evaporates in your mouth. Excellent. Highly recommended."
"D - Refreshing and easy to drink. Low alcohol (5%) gives you the option of drinking a couple and feeling fine."
"Overall this is a very good gueuze, I really enjoyed this beer."
"A sessionable Gueuze for those that appreciate the style."
"Nice drinkability for what many would consider an unusual ale. Great for Summer."
"If I hadn't had beers like La Folie or Consecration, this would be really hard to handle. Luckily, my sour cherry has been popped, so to speak, so I can enjoy this. However, I'm glad it comes in this little bottle because I couldn't handle much more than this one serving."
"Thanks jyounger30!"
"The taste is even better i think. Up front very acidic,again like rotten lemons, but the funk in the back is way more complex than the nose suggest. Its barnyard as so many have said, but its more than that, its musky, its moldy, its got a touch of sweetness, this is the most challenging beer i have ever had, but its also one of the most enjoyable. I only wish i had bought more than one bottle."
"Very interesting. May have to return to this beer again some time."
"Low abv and the fact that it is not too tart making it a good drinkable beer, striking a good balance between the tart sourness of the funk and the malty beer backbone."
"My local store just started having this on a regular basis and I am a fan. The translucent golden orange filled the glass with an excellent show of soapy white head. The Brett is prevalent in this beer. Some horse blanket, funk and B.O. are also obvious. The taste is different than the smell. Some tart sour lemon, fresh cut grass, and faint hops dominate this beer. The dry white wine texture hits the front of the tongue. But it does have a nice clean bubbly finish even if it is a little chaulky at first. When I want a good ""go to"" sour, this is it. I have a feeling I'll be buying quite a bit."
"Drinking this beer conjures up childhood memories of playing under the plum tree in my backyard. Great Stuff."
"D- This is a very easy drinkable beer. Perhaps the best gueze I have ever had. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. I just got to go to the shop and pick more up before they run out of it."
"Since Girardin Gueuze 1882 is only the fifth gueuze that I've ever reviewed, I have no idea if it's the best version in the world or not. Consider the impressions of other reviewers on that point, not mine. Nevertheless, this is a fantastic experience that I wholeheartedly recommend for anyone who loves craft beer... whatever your style preferences."
"D: A high quality gueuze. Complex and sophisticated, yet with plenty of that unique spontaneous edginess. It's delightfully sour (it could even give some of the beers from Cantillon a go regarding levels of acidity) but it never goes out of hand. I would also like to especially emphasize how great the finish in this one is, really magnificent."
"Glad I bought 3 pounds of cheese this stuff made my weekend."
"This is an outstanding gueuze. Easily the best that I have had and one of the best sours overall. I was very pleased to come across this one, as I have never seen it anywhere else. I only find myself wishing I had bought the other bottle they had. Oh well, some other lucky person will enjoy the hell out of it hopefully."
"D: Very light with a clean but sour aftertaste. Easy and drinkable, a good change of pace from a heavy RIS."
"Light to medium body with high carbonation on the mouthfeel. Nice example for its' style."
"Light bodied with a high level of carbonation and a very dry mouthfeel. This is a fantastic beer."
"Sour flavors are bright and have highnotes with a pleasant bitter/sour character. Some sours can make you pucker and can be hard to get down; more chore than fun. This one is all quite delicious. A very friendly and inviting sour beer."
"Come back for the finale of the Third Unorganized Invitational (T.U.I.) tomorrow, and afterwards we'll announce the winner."
"Refreshing beverage for summertime. Will drink again. I wish this wasn't 10 bucks a bottle."
"I decided tonight would be a good night to have something sour. Girardin 1882 Gueuze has a glowing orange color to it, along with a small and fizzy white head that does not last very long. Smell is wonderfully funky and sour, with traces of fresh lemon juice, white wine, and some dry earth tones. Flavor really attacks the palate as soon as it enters with a big dose of sourness. Lemon is the dominant flavor, and unlike many gueuzes that end in sort of a dry way, this one stays juicy throughout. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, making it a very refreshing beer that would be ideal for a hot summer day. The sour flavors do not linger for too long, and it does not destroy the palate, so I don't see why one can't put back a few bottles of this in a sitting (I know I would like to). This is a wow beer for me; One of the best beers I have had in a very long time, possibly ever. If the cash was there, I would be purchasing a case of this elixir without hesitation. Cheers"
"D - Drinkability is pretty good. Tons of ""in your face"" flavor make this one more of a sipper that you'd want to take your time on. This is a very nice example of the style that I wouldn't hesitate to try again. The only real flaw that is worth mentioning is the head or lack thereof. If that is the biggest problem a beer has then said beer is pretty well off in my opinion."
"Great drinkabilty, and a great pairing to a variety of foods."
"D: This was my first foray into the world of Gueuzes and I continue to enjoy it as I've developed my palate and appreciation for the style.. i found this beer to be easy to consume despite the overall tart and sour nature of the beer. A good place to start for those looking to explore the style."
"Very nice example of a gueuze, would definitely have again."
"375 ml bottle- pours an orange golden with very good clarity and moderate head. Very delicate lacing. Nose- lemon, must, oak, hay. Taste- juicy sourness, dry green apple, lemon zest and dry oak finish. Medium carbonation, and actually has a smooth texture. Drinkable as all hell."
"375ml bottle. Gold-orange color with small carbonation and a creamy off-white head. Honey, lemon, wet wood, a floral aroma. Sour and acidic, with a little musty woodiness. Starts with a little sweetness, and then dry and tart. Has enough malt body to balance the tartness, and that is really the kicker for me. Light body and champagne-like carbonation. The balance and complexity are amazing. I didn't really like gueuze before this, but the balance and drinkability of this beer has completely turned me around."
"Overall, this one really shocked me. I love sours and this one definitely ranks at the top. It reminded me a lot of RR Beatification, even a bit better. I'm definitely going to look for a few more bottles."
"Pours a murky, cloudy, hazy gold in color with a nice pillowy white head on top of the beer. Man this is funky. Among the strongest funk smells I have ever gotten from a beer. Lots of barnyard, some musty notes and a little bit of sourness. Taste is an abundance of tart sourness. A little bit of a acidic quality to boot. Very complex and sour. The taste is incredible. As it warms up it really gets better. Incredibly full and creamy on the mouthfeel. I've been looking for this beer for sometime and it is well worth the wait. If I keep up at this pace, my entire cellar is going to be nothing but sours."
"Drinkability - A showstopper of a gueuze! Very light and refreshing while maintaining a puckering sourness with a sweet touch. Easy to sip on and enjoy during the spring or a summer afternoon."
"D: This is a pretty interesting beer. As a person who is just getting into sours I find it quite tolerable and very enjoyable. It's definitely something different, but can be appreciated by a sour lover or a person looking to expand their horizons."
"D: Split with FtownThrowDown and Roymunson and my sample was plenty."
"Shared a couple bottles at Den Trollkelder in Gent. What a beer. I had this next to the Marriage Parfait and and filtered (white label) 1882, and while it was fairly similar to the Boon, there was little resemblance to the white label. This had more oak barrel character - tasting like I was drinking from a wooden mug - along with lemon/lime fruit, bit sour tartness, and underlying farmhouse funk. Heck of a beer, give it a try."
"Maybe my favorite gueuze."
"D - This is my favorite spring/summer beer. It's refreshing without getting boring. Most definitely a session beer - I could drink this all night long. I love to pair this beer with food - the flavors mesh very well with all different types of food. Try it with seafood, cheese, or a hearty burger."
"""This is like carbonated vinegar."""
"EDIT: Definitely gets more sour in an abrasive, vinegary way as it gets warmer."
"A great choice. This one should best be enjoyed by itself. A great funky tartness. If sour beers are not your thing, stay away; otherwise, hunt this one down."
"Pricy but i can see why. I could drink this all day due to the smoothness. this beer deserves a fat pat on the back."
"notes: really tasty gueuze i think it was a little to vinegary but this is still really good one"
"D: Nice beer, one bottle is good for my, stomach starts to feel a little sour, which takes away from its drinkability for me."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color covered by one finger of off white head. Clove and green apple aromas and quite a bit of sour. A vinegar taste is present, but it's subtle. Green apple there as well. Sour as hell. Nice maltiness, a little bitter. It's carbonation is too high in my opinion, but it has a really good body to it. Overall, a little too sour, but still drinkable."
"This is a pretty great beer. I love this style, especially since I love champagne and stinky cheese and these beers seem to combine those experiences. Plus this one had lime-ade to boot!"
"This beer pours a cloudy amber with a 2 fingered white head and some lacing. The smell is sour, very sour. The taste has a nice malt base to it with a nice sour finish, nicely balanced, I think I could enjoy a little more sour though. The mouthfeel is nice with a good carbonation level. Nicely drinkable brew but for the pricetag its probably just a one time taster."
"Good drinkability, but definitely a sipper because the sourness starts to get a little intense. Great beer overall though."
"This is a great beer that I will be having again in the near future."
"I would take this over a good champagne any day. Absolutely fantastic. What a feeling it is to try the 'best' of something (anything) and find that it truly lives up to the hype."
"pour is bit darker than most. with a nice head with retention. white. color is very light amber with a murk that brings it out more. the sour scent is there and a bit more oaky and smokey that others. the taste is great. light oak. light vanilla, light meaty which with the smokiness is bacon apple like. apple. on the more sour side which is astounding for the palate range... fantastic for grilled food..."
"Overall this is a very funky, very sour beer, but that's not all it is. The citrus fruits manage to give this another dimension and take an edge off. Definitely worth a shot."
"Pours a cloudy bright gold/orange that is simply beautiful to look at. Smells of sourness, funk and wild yeast dominate the nose. First sip is mouth puckering that is just right with musty cider notes that are not too sour and not over the top funky. There is an amazing mouthfeel here as the bubbles dance joyfully on the tongue. Very nice indeed!"
"M/D - Dry and puckering are the two words that come to mind on this one. Very crisp and refreashing sipper. Excellent carbonation on this one."
"Taste is excellent sour fruity (apples, lemon) with dry and light sweetish finish. Mouthfeel is rather light with very high carbonation and light warming feeling. Overall, the beer is excellent."
"Very good refreshing citrus brew."
"Of course, Lambic making isn't a science - it's an art. It involves blending, a proud sense of tradition and hand-me-down knowledge of an ancient brewing technique. I'd strongly recommend a trip to Brussels for anyone who has an appreciation for the dying art of true lambic. Go to see the cobwebs and spiders, the open air coolships, rows of exploding barrels and the racks of aging corked bottles. Oh, and be sure to drink plenty!"
"8/4/8/5/18/4.3"
"I was suprised by this beer. I went into not expecting to care for it much, but was wrong. Pours golden orange, hazy, with a 1 finger creamy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is funky, some real sour apple with some yeast and a floral kick to it. Taste is somewhat simple I thought. It was sour. It was funky. Some yeast. I really cant say I noticed this, and noticed that, just overall it was nice and sour. Dry mouthfeel with a bit of a lemony aftertaste, fair amount of carbonation. Overall a nice beer and very drinkable. Serve it a little warmer and sip away, one of these should last you a while!"
"Mouthfeel was clean and crisp with a nice sharp carbonation. This is a great way cleanse or wake up the palate and maybe drink two glasses but not a whole lot more."
"Thoroughly enjoyable."
"D: This brew is damned impressiv and really satisfies. It is a bit confusing as some of the flavor remind you of lambics then champagne. I will have to seek a somewhat local retailer of this goodness and make this happen on a fairly regular basis. Great balance of sweet flavors and sour, funky goodness. Just damned good."
"Mouthfeel is tart, medium bodied, peppery, mildly sweet and spicy in the forefront, leading to a tart, lemony bite at the end."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"D. Low, but exceptional all the same. A few ounces of Girardin will wake your tastebuds up. A great choice to break out in the middle of a heavy beer tasting to shock palates into overdrive."
"Overall, a good but not great beer. Glad I tried it as I can knock it off my top 100 quest but I was really disappointed with it. After ready the reviews and having a lot of sour beers lately, I was expecting more. Gonna have to try another bottle sometime to make sure I get a good sample or valid my review. Do recommend as it is a unique style but don't rush to get it. As is, it's not top 100 for me. One and done (except for re-reviewing)."
"One of the gems of the Lambic world, and one of the best sours I've had to date. Delicious!"
"Pours hazy bronze with a 1 cm tall white head. Pleasant aroma of bitter crabapples, yeast, and musk. Wicked bitter bite. Very sour and acidic, with a mostly apple flavor and some metal. This bitterness continues throughout, but at the very end the beer takes a mellow, sweeter turn. A buttery, biscuit-like flavor burns thorugh. Sometimes it leans into a cheese/mascarpone flavor. Delicious sipper of a beer."
"M/D - This is fantastic drink and is to be savoured and enjoyed! I could have a few - but over about 3 hours!"
"if you like Petrus aged Pale, you should also really dig this beer"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Why is this not available around here. Stellar. Almost like a Russian River. A really great sour beer. The price is high but worth tracking down at least once."
"It is certainly very good, and the balance leads to a sublime drinkability, but I love the Cantillon. If I am springing for a world-class lambic, that is the direction I'd recommend."
"I have never plowed through a Gueze like I have through this one. Incredible effort. Must find more!"
"D: Gueuzes are NOT everyday drinkers for most of us. But if I had to have one every day, this might be it: just tart enough, vaguely sweet and with a good finish of grain. This one I'll highly recommend and plan to have again."
"Overall: only if it's your thing"
"Really glad I had this one for my #300; I've had this before but had not been able to sit down and review it."
"This is a superb combination of a beer that is light enough to be had in a hot day; low enough alcohol to be a session beer, and enough flavor packed to even be a sipper. Funk all the way, sour, with asweet oakiness somewhere in the middle; bone dry finish. Lots of fruits somewhere in the middle."
"It's like biting into a lemon sliced on top of a horse-blanket, and despite that imagery, it's a grand delivery on an audacious promise. Once my cheeks re-inflated, I realized just how refreshing and spirited this beer really is. If you like the style, it goes down smooth, easy, and happily. So not only do I like the style, I love the way this once represents the best of what it strives to be."
"Notes: It's exactly what I had anticipated and hoped, and for the price, it's a really solid gueuze. One I'd definitely pick up if I wanted to introduce someone to the style."
"Drinkability is a strange question for a sour I finished the bottle, but Do you want to do more than one sour at a sitting? I enjoyed the brew and would gladly drink it again. Truly a great brew and deserves to be tried by every sour fan"
"D: This is my first Gueze and I believe I spoiled myself with a very nice selection. Its exactly what I was expecting. An overly sour lambic style taste sans any fruit. Very nice!"
"I'd rate this higher in drinkability if it were cheaper. It's a wonderful beer however, especially for this time year."
"I could drink these all day..."
"Very refreshing. Truly the champagne of beer. A new favourite. How I wish I could get this back in Canada."
"Pours a golden amber with a head that starts out thick but quickly fades to just a thin layer that lasts for a few minutes. Oaky with grapefruit and funky aromas. The flavors are all perfectly balanced which I think makes this gueuze more complex than any others I've had."
"D: 4.5"
"fantastic gueuze, smells great, mildy sour, fantastic flavors, world class."
"Good drinkability, although this is too sour for me to want more than one. This would be great with a rich cheesy dish -- I'm thinking French onion soup with lots of goopy melted cheese on top!"
"Notably tarter than 3 Fonteinen or Oud Beersel, Girardin has a sharp acidity that inspires the appetite. After an exuberant uncorking the beer pours out virtually uncarbonated in hazed honey gold. A sharp and irascible ale that's not overly sour but has a honed acidic punch. Quite enjoyable."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a taste that takes some getting used to but you tell it's very well-made."
"D - Every base covered here. Looks/smells/tastes great and very easy to sip. The real deal."
"d: Gueuzes are expensive, but I'll certainly revisit this one. This will probably be the one I buy several of for aging purposes. I'm loving my foray into the world of sour beers so far."
"Drinkable? I certainly want more, but the flavor of this beer is intense. I love it, but 375 ml is enough in one sitting."
"Drinkability was quite good for such an intensely sour beer. It was well balanced, light and quite refreshing. I simply cannot think of a beer that would make for a better aperitif. This is truly a world-class gueuze."
"When I finally managed to get it in the glass, it produces mostly a huge white head. It eventually turned in to a yellow-orange beer with a lot of bubbles. I suppose the aroma is pretty much the same for all gueuze. Cob webs, dusty, oak barrel, 'horse blanket'. Not really sure what else to say about it. Over the top tart. Very much like orange juice concentrate. Not a bad flavor, be very aggressive. Medium body. Highly effervescent. Dry, but not as dry as expected. I wish I would have shared this with somebody. I like it, but its a bit much for me."
"The body is full yet crisp and delicate. An outstanding beer that I strive to be able to replicate some day."
"This is my first Gueuze and it's been an experience. This is a very good beer. I'll admit that this is not ever going to be one of my favorite styles. It's just a little sour for my taste. But, this is definitely a beer to check out."
"Notes: Really enjoyed this, one of my favorite gueuzes to date."
"Pours a hazy light amber color with 1 inch of sparkling off-white/pinkish orange head. Good retention and a thin ring of spotty lacing. Smells of green apples, sour cherries, apple cider vinegar, barnyard funk, raisins, and lemon. Tastes of sour apples, funk and musty basement, light malt, with a dry lemon and sour cherry finish. Medium in body with lots of carbonation that fizzes on your mouth scattering the sourness all over and leaving the dry finish to hold on, leaving a lasting taste. Sour, tart, sweet, and funky, low in alcohol, and easy to drink for the sour fruit lover. A great example of a gueuze."
"The sediment is extremely tart. I'd decant carefully."
"An excellent gueuze. Top notch. This would be a go-to sour beer for me if I could get it readily."
"Pours orangish colored with a wispy white head. Smell is lighty funky sour barnyard. Taste is balanced sweet and sourness. Begins very lightly sweet and then finishes tart and dry. Bubbly, fizzy active carbonation and a nice moutfeel that I haven't gotten in some guezes. This was really nice and easily one of my favorites of the style"
"D:Very approachable type of beer. It was good. Certainly not ovdf powering."
"D - i really liked this gueuze. a great beer to start the day with. i wouldn't suggest more than one, but it's something i'd definitely keep gonig back to."
"This beer is not for everyone. It is a mix of 1000 green apples and a dark musty cellar. This is one of my favorite beers. The look of this beer is a beautiful color of amber. It smells musty and sour. Mmmmm. It pours nicely into my glass with very little head when poured gently and with respect for this amazing beer. The mouthfeel is refreshing and a pleasure to the pallet. I highly suggest trying this beer."
"Bottle courtesy of purfock: Poured a orangey color lambic with a huge foamy head with excellent retention and some good lacing. Aroma of green apple and tart is really great. Taste is a complex mix between some green apple, some sour and tart notes with some light funky barnyard notes. Full body with great carbonation. I appreciated that the level of acidity is manageable and doesn't totally overrun the complexities."
"Excellent beer. Lacks the intense funkiness of a Cantillon, but this helps make it very refreshing, drinkable, and more accessible than some other examples of the style."
"This is one forward, funky brew. A great example of a classic gueuze."
"Awesome beer...one of the best - if not the best - sour ale I've tried. I wish I could get this at my local store, because it would be a weekly indulgence. Well worth seeking a bottle out."
"I like lambics and I am really enjoying this traditional gueuze. Makes me want to start planning a trip to Belgium right away."
"I sprang for a bottle of the 2004 batch on a whim. A bit of a gusher on opening, filled the room with a lemony, yeasty aroma. Once in a glass, the head calmed down and there was a very pleasant level of effervescence with every sip. Which is the point here, sipping is the way to drink this one. The taste is slightly salty and straw-like up front, with lemon undertones and the finish is dominated by a surprisingly strong wood character. Really interesting, and a refreshing drink as light in body as it is. Call me crazy, but I think this would be great with pizza, good pizza."
"Great beer."
"D- This is a sipper for sure because it is so intensely sour. While saying that, I think while this would take a long time to drink a lot of, I could sip on it all night."
"Overall, definately an interesting beer. Kinda like a berliner weisse mixed with some belgian funk. Glad I tried this beer, but I don't know that I will seek it out. I don't know if this is my kind of beer. I will have to try others in the style and see. Thanks again to mikesgroove for this one."
"Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this rare example."
"D: Refreshing and palate cleansing. Excellent."
"Pours a nice golden amberish color that has a decent whitish head that rises and falls fairly quickly. Nose is bringing the funk. Minor antiseptic tones are mixed with a more dominatingly sweet character. Flavor is great. Nice sour tang. Wonderful level of funk. Well done. Very smooth feel. This is so easy to drink. Does it come in gallons??"
"Had to keep myself from gulping down."
"D: I have to admit, I couldn't finish the whole bottle. Each time I've had a sour beer it's been a little more drinkable, but I feel that the depth of flavor gets somewhat lost due to the tartness. Maybe I'm missing something. I just feel like it needs something to balance the flavor that's not there."
"First beer in this style, first from this brewery, certainly got my attention, did not know much about this before drinking but was very content with the surprise in the end, wow this was something special, the fact that this is unfiltered is impressive also, will definitely buy again in the future, highly recommended to others"
"Bone dry and refreshing, with great carbonation. One of the easier to drink gueuzes I've had."
"Overall Impression: Tart, but drinkable. Enjoyed it, so see it being a great summer sipper."
"Great afternoon drink."
"D- A little to much lemon in this for me. Still a good gueuze but wouldn't say one of the best."
"good drinkability, it maintains a good balance of sourness to drinkability. it avoids being severely puckering, leaving an empty glass quickly."
"is tangy, malty, slightly sweet, lots of lemon, slight yeast, floral, and some spices. The taste is slightly sweet, then the tangy/bitter kick in big time, getting some yeast notes, and spicyness. The finish is dry, bitter, and tangy. Medium body. Drinkable, not bad at all, much better than I thought it would be. Might just seek out other Gueuze. Recommended, thanks again Bill for a chance to try something different."
"This was defiantly an interesting brew for me. I am never sure what I am going to get when I open something like this, but there is only one way to find out. Popped the cork and it let out a nice pop and audible hiss, so this one was defiantly still alive. Poured into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine. I could see why it is rated so high, as it is quite different then anything I had tried in the past. This was very much a great brew and something I would look forward to sipping on again. Highly recommend this one."
"drinkability is good. the sourness is strong, but not overpowering. the backing malt and light citrus sweetness balances it fairly well."
"D- This beer has a nice depth but it is a bit overpowered by the tartness. That leads me to take another sip to try and unravel this beer. I would like to try some different ages on this beer to see how it matures."
"Pours a good head from a beer that is flowing with carbonation very quickly. The most of the head goes away, but there's a thin layer that stays behind. The color is a nice orangey-brown-tan color that's cloudy. The smell is deep farmhouse sour flavors from horse blanket ;) to lemon and grapefruit. The taste is pretty mellow for a gueuze, a good blend. Not overpowering with sourness, but not mellow enough to let you forget you're drinking a gueuze. The mouthfeel is acidic, carbonated, and dry. It's like drinking champaign lemon juice."
"Opinion: Boy, you just don't come across a beer like this too often, and this is the reason why I like the Gueuze styles so much. There are so many flavors in here, I barely do it justice by comparing it to lemonade, but that is where my mind goes when drinking this beer. It is light and refreshing with lots of citrus and carbonation. It goes down really smooth, but I imagine that the acidity would get the best of you if you drank a whole lot of this beer."
"D: This one has me totally rethinking my outlook on beer. Being my first Gueuze, I really don't know what to say. I wouldn't call this incredibly ""drinkable," as it's definitely a challenging beer to consume. At the same time, it's unlike anything I've had, so I can't really knock it either. The best I can do is note its characteristics and give my take. So there you have it."
"Pours a sunset orange hue with a fluffy one finger head that dies down to a nice layer that lasts. Stickiness is pretty good, nothing spectacular. Smell is big in acidity with a whole bunch of granny smith apples and sour cherries. Some yeasty goodness and fresh mowed grass tickle the nose as well. Taste is sour grapefruit up front with a bitter hop bite that has a grainy earth flavor. Bready yeast flavors emerge midway through and leave a similar aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is very light bodied with a boat load of carbonation. My first beer of this style, but I find it quite drinkable. So light and fluffy and easy to put down. Definitely glad I had the opportunity to try this one. You the man Greg!"
"D - A great geuze that starts very tart and mellows as you drink it."
"Poured out of a 37,5 cl bottle in to a cantillon gueuze glass. It poured a really bubble head that disapated to a small thin lacy head within one min. . Murky golden orange color with lively carbonation. Smell light barnyard funk with a mild blue cheese aroma. Nice balance of dry vs tartness in the taste. Green apples acidity matched with a light lemon vingear backing. Mouth feel is dry but with a pretty light body. Its a very lovely gueuze because of its very balanced structure which helps this gueuze to be one of the more drinkable gueuze."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, forming a 1/2"" eggshell head over the cloudy golden amber brew. Head fades gradually but slowly, with plenty of coating, slow-falling lace. Aroma is tart, with undercurrents of smokiness and light funk. Taste is also dominantly tart, but with fruity undertones, and somehow is not as acidic as some of the more intense gueuzes get (read: Cantillon). Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy for the style, and quite drinkable. Has that thirst-quenchingness going on as well. Nice well-rounded brew."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. I like the sour flavor and aroma quite a bit."
"Drinkability- Personally I could only drink one of these little guys but I can see why this beer is loved. I'm not really one for sour beers but this does so in a very approachable way. Sour enough for the die hard yet not so extreme that a noob ass like myself can't enjoy. Very glad I tried and thanks again to tpd975!!"
"Bottom line: This is my first experience with a Gueuze and if I get a chance, I'll try some more of the style. It's right up my alley. You have to try this if you see it locally!!!"
"Overall, a good beer, but not one of the better sours I've had. I don't care for the champagne and apples. It almost seems like a cross between champagne and cider. It's not as complex as I was expecting."
"One of the top ten beers in the world as far as I'm concerned."
"Sourness is subdued in the feel, at least by geuze standards and the flavor is a more balanced and refined funk than Im used to. Plenty of citrus, mostly lemon and a lot of wet straw and must. Highly acidic and absolutely assertive carbonation. Very dry. Exceptionally balanced. Highly drinkable."
"Wonderful. I wish the price tag wasn't so steep or this would be a surefire repeat buy for me. As it is, I know I'll still stop and think about it every time I pass it on the shelf."
"very refreshing beer, and good drinkability. if your looking for a sour beer with lemony-citrus flavor and some good ole funkiness, this is what you need."
"A world-class Gueuze that's a new favorite. Highly recommended."
"D- pretty good, have to like sour beers as its still"
"Pours a glowing gold with a pretty nice sized head. Solid carbonation with this one. The aroma is funky, as expected. Very similar to Cantillon, but maybe a bit mellower. The taste is awesome. Not as sour as the 3 Fonteinen or Cantillon's I've tried, but there seems to be a bit more depth here. Nice batch. Excellent carbonation and overall mouthfeel. I could drink this all day. Highly recommended."
"This had a cloudy amber orangish body with TONS of head. The aroma was very tart and had the classic gueuze smell. The flavor was even more sour than the aroma and made the glands in my neck tingle. Probably one of the best gueuzes in terms of the sourness. It reminded me slightly of La Terroir in sourness level. Light bodied with very good drinkability."
"Overall: Love it, Love, it, Love it. Did I mention that I am in love. This could be a session brew for me. In these hot summer months of Florida I have fallen for the Gueuze. I have found others, but none surpass the black label. Still searching out better, but for now I have my hands on the holy grail."
"If I could find this easily, I would session this one. Good stuff."
"Thanks to goochpunch for the warning about opening this baby. I didn't have an explosion but the bottle would have foamed over the neck had I not had a glass handy. Very effervescent, big frothy head and a golden, cloudy color that seems to be lit from within. The fruit in the nose is pronounced, with that trademark gueuze sourness foremost. The taste puckers your mouth. Sharp & acidic up front, a hint of fruit that darts past the tastebuds faster than you can identify it, then a sour that hits hard and stays late. Wow. Gueuze squared. I really like it but the sourness is so overpowering its hard to get past. The mouthfeel is sour. No wait, that's taste. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a softness to it that is really nice. The drinkability? Sorry, the sourness just puts the brakes on more than one of these. I love gueze, and this is a great one. I just have to leave it at one. Hurts so good."
"Pours out looking like hazy, unpasteurized apple cider you get in the jugs. Head remains a thin sheet over the body. This is definitely one of the funkier geuzes I've had in terms of aromas. The citric acidity is most prevalent, while Spanish moss, straw, and faint sharp cheese serve as more underlying themes. The acidity comes up front in the flavor as well, shooting up to the nostrils and reminding me of sour Pop Rocks. I'm pretty surprised by the amount of mellow vanilla from the wood despite the funk. Finishes rather astringent, with a tangerine flavor that lingers on. I would prefer this to be a little more active on the tongue. The body is just fine: not too light bodied. This one strikes me as very traditional, and I love it."
"Very nice. The smell is what does it for me the most. Extremely sipable for the style."
"D: Probably one of the most balanced guezes on the market. Incredibly sour but the other flavors are so harmonious that it doesnt hinder the drinkability."
"Overall a tart, fruity, refreshing, yet complex beer. Excellent during the hot summer months."
"D - The style makes for an acquired taste. It's not really for me, but I can sip this one as well as any of the other top-notch tongue twisting styles."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange, with a huge fuzzy white head that retains and laces very well, off to a good start. Aroma was a musty green apple and almost foresty earthiness. Taste was sour lime, grapes, more green apple, sour but more balance and favour variety than any other Gueuze I have tried. Juicy yet dry and astrigent, makes one's mouth water. This a wonderfully drinkable Gueuze, and a great finish to a night of drinking."
"A solid gueuze, but one to be enjoyed one flute at a time."
"Drinkable for what it is, but not drinkable."
"Overall: This ones a good example of style vs. personal taste. If I were judging purely on style, this beer would rate a whole lot higher. But then if I were judging on personal taste, it would rate much lower. Im just not a fan of sour Flemish ales/guezes/lambics. That said, Ive still tried them, and this is one of the best. Hopefully that will provide some guidance to my fellow beer advocates."
"Cheers!"
"Ah, heavenly gueuze, return sweetly to my lips. A shallow pour, elicits furtive and bright carbonation, gassing the most piquant and lively tones of musky grape skins, cob-webbed attic planks, long grassy warm days and a sweeping sharp bite of acidic splendor. Faint washed-rind cheese lactic blend with lightly soured apple juice and a passionfruit. Nice. In the glass, a lightly hazed orange-tinted gold, with a soft, soapy head of white. On the tongue, its alive with bold, bowling acidity, bright, clear and clean. Quiet tones of wheat sugars whisper through the veil of bold soured candies. Musty pig barns and scattered straw elicit a note of farms and apples. Out among the earthy glow is a vibrant bowl of fresh wet cranberries, puckering the corners of my mouth. So, fresh and delicate. A wisp of flowery perfume fills the humors, percolating the dying hop dryness. Beautiful all around."
"Drank really easy, just enough tartness to draw you in. I'd be happy with 1 of these & then time to move on. Especially at $8 a bottle. When ever I was in Belgium I tried not to drink the same beer twice in one sitting, too many others to enjoy!"
"Overrall, a great Gueuze."
"This isn't really my favorite beerstyle, but I reviewed the beer the way I think it meets the Gueuze specifications."
"It's only my second gueuze, but it's easily the more complex of the two. I would like to try other interpretations before trying this again, though."
"D: Different and challenging, this one is definitely not for the novice beer drinker. Very good and worth seeking out. I'll be curious to try this one again after I have a few more in the style."
"All its attributes seem to be right on for the style; I really enjoyed this one."
"Appearance was OK, straw colored with very light head. The aroma and flavor was sour and acidy, tasty if you know what to expect and like that kind of thing (I do). Tart mouthfeel and lasting musty and funky flavor. Good, but not worth etching my floor."
"D: The 5% abv is great, making several beers reasonable. And that pucker sourness, it is well balanced between nonexistent and crazy."
"Mouthfeel is bold, puckering with a dry finish and moderate acidity. It makes you slow down and appreciate the privilege of drinking this in the US. Have one or two, even more if you're a glutton for delicious sour punishment."
"A fantastic gueuze, the filtered is a more refined version with a bit less flavour but this is the nuts here, brilliant"
"Do they sell this in bigger bottles??"
"Orange/tan color with plenty of haze, not much head, just a lightly fizzy ring. The aroma is intense. Bright oak-like vinegar and sour fruit tartness, very inviting. There are strong tart flavors in the taste also. It is lightly acidic, with more woody vinegar notes and aged funk. The finish is dry and puckering, yet so enjoyable. The body is thin, almost wine-like, but with tight/sharp bubbles. This Gueze is excellent. With its perfect lingering sourness, I definitely want more of this beer... Thanks to OldSock for the bottle..."
"Drinkability: I am a once in a while lambic drinker but this one has a lot going for it; glad I tried it"
"overall though not my favorite style, I foun this to be an fun and interesting beer to taste."
"Very drinkable. One of the best out there. The complex flavors and refreshing notes make you come back for more. Absolutely delicious."
"This beer poured a clear, deep gold with a gigantic, fluffy, white head. Clumpy lace clung to the glass as the foam receded. Nice funky aroma, with notes of lemony citrus, hay, and spice, with an underlying musty quality. Acidic tartness is dominant throughout, with a balancing sweetness and lemon/grapefruit citrus flavour. It's quite fruity too - grapes, kind of like white wine. There's some earthy funk here too, but it's not as prominant as in the aroma. Drying tartness lingers forever in the finish and there's a bit of a medicinal/herbal flavour that hits after it's been swallowed. Medium bodied with generous, spritzy carbonation. Very dry. This is great - I really enjoyed this beer. The character was superb and really made an impression."
"Nothing out of the ordinary, just a solid, well-rounded example of the style. Worth seeking out for lambic fans. Cheers!"
"Pours a hazy golden orange, small tan head forms, goes fast but settles to a ring, some lacing. Smell is sweet, citrus, lots of funk, grains, little bit of alcohol, sour. Taste is sweet and sour, grains, lots of citrus, very tart drying finish, taste linger, like eating a lemon. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Gets better as it warms, the grains really come out. Very enjoyable tartness, great gueuze."
"Drinkability: I like the style, and want to explore it further. This beer is big in flavor and very satisfying."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer has a light body. The beer is well carbonated. This beer is very dry. This beer is oddly refreshing. This was a dam fine beer drink and I will have this one soon."
"A simple traditional Geuze, but quality throughout."
"Drinkability: I'd say this is a little too extreme to be really refreshing, but it definitely holds your attention."
"Mouthfeel is light and extremely arid with a mezmerizing flow of tight bubbled carbonation. Dances across the palate and brings a sense of creaminess. A wonderful gueuze to be had here, not to be missed if you're a fan of the style. A true work of the brewer's art that this sour beer lover would sit down to anytime...this one can be held up to the best of 'em."
"This beer pours a rusty orange with a white head that holds nicely without a lot of lace. The smell is quite sour to the nose with the presence of some yeast. There is also a bit of some white wine aromas perhaps somewhat similar to a pinot gris. The taste also hits you immediately with the sourness but also is very similar to the aroma with the yeasty and wine like characteristics. The mouthfeel is dry and well carbonated with a nice thickness to it. Overall it is drinkable in the aspect that it is quite new and exciting to me, this being my first gueuze but at the same time the agressive sourness of the flavor would hold me back from grabbing another bottle."
"I love this stuff, I can (and have) drink it all day. It's got that authentic farmyard smell, the mouth-puckering astringency, the lovely orange hue, the sheer complexity of the taste and after-taste the makes it a top-class gueuze. I really must try drinking real cider again, now I'm used to the Gueuze experience I am probably ready for it."
"Overall - An outstanding gueuze - one of the best i've tried... i must get me some more..."
"initial apple sweetness immediately gives way to a finish like a mouthful of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. intense flavor. fairly light mouthfeel with just a touch of carbonation. quite drinkable given the intensity. an incredibly good gueuze."
"For the abv, this is immensely drinkable. Session beer for the conniosseur. Very complex, light, and incredibly dry. Great stuff."
" No sweetness in the taste, it tastes like licking the ground of a dirty ass barn with a Brett colony on it. Mouthfeel is smooth, and not nearly as carbonated as the appearance might lead you to believe. I wish this bottle was a 750, and I wish I had my own."
"Overall, i need to be more experienced in gueuzes, but i really enjoyed this one. very nice."
"Clumps of bubbles rise up from the center of this hazy, luminous orange brew. The initial head is quite sizeable, on account of its lively carbonation, but things soon calm down. The aroma is light and airy, showing tart fruits along with that signature Gueuze funkiness. It's not as heavily musty as some other examples, really, instead going for a sharper, fresher profile. Big-time sourness instantly grips the palate and begins to pucker the tongue and pretty much the whole mouth. The eyelids spasm and shut instinctively. Flavors of tart fruit, cider, and yeasty funkiness are also in the mix. The intense sour acidity of Gueuze Girardin seems to either subside in time or one becomes aclimated to it. By mid-glass, the drinking experience has hit another level. I really like this beer."
"This is a huge beer. Not exactly my cup of tea, but definitely something that I can appreciate for its flavors and complexity."
"Dryer than dry, this still somehow manages to be thirst-quenching. An amazing beer - a great reminder of good times in Belgian if you've been, and a terrific enticement and hint of what's to come if you haven't!"
"Mostly clear, coppery orange body with a champagne-like effervescent head of spittly off-white that lasts all night. Nose is spritzy club soda sweetness that gets lost quickly in a tart, tangy, sour funk of lemon juice, acid, horse blankets, brett, armpits, but mostly sour citrus. Im awake now! Taste is wow. Very tart; puckeringly sour. Lemon juice and grapefruit acid. But waittheres more to this after the bracing sourness. Floral and light fruit notes, along with wisps of wheat malt slip in. Light barnyard funkiness, but mostly sour grapefruit acidity into the dry finish. Did I mention this was sour and dry and refreshing? A very nice beer."
"The beer after removing the wire basket and cork from the green 375ml green bottle sets in my glass a beclouded amber color with a voluminous creamy light tan head that lingers long, leaving a thick covering of lace to surround the glass. Nose has a distinct somewhat sweet wet moldy straw aroma, underpinned by a staunch tartness, musty, but still appealing to me; start is first a bit sweet, followed by a massive sourness, with the body light to moderate in feel. Finish has a tongue biting acidity, with the sourness clinging to the palate like Jack Benny to a dime. What a magnificent brew, one Ive wanted to sample for many years, trust me it was certainly worth the wait."
"Incredibly sour yet sooo enjoyable and drinkable although I couldn't see drinking more than 2 of these in a sitting as it chips away at your remaining taste buds with every pull. This is frickin' puckering typ sour, think lambic times 10. For a 5% brew the alcohol is warming, maybe it doesn't have to fight with the big malted,hopped brews so much and shines through the cutting fruitiness easier. Now if I could only get a solid Gueuze made locally I'd be all over it. For now I'm more than happy to pay a bit extra for the best I've had to date."
"Nose has lots of grassy/musty notes and is very concentrated, there is also a bit overripe sour oranges. Hazy orange in color with a beautiful creamy white head. Flavor is quite sour in the fore then musty with hints of the cork it was capped and then lots of sweet citrus fruits plus apple and pear. The finish is again musty and funky, but dry and slightly acidic. It walks through such an amazingly distinct range of flavors that even if you dont like what you taste it is hard not to be impressed. That amount of distinct flavor ranges in a beer is rare. I started drinking it too cold and the flavors become more intense and varied as it warms. Worthy of the praise."
"D: Don't know that I'd be able to drink more than a glass seeing as how the sourness is pretty strong and kinda upsets my stomach. Otherwise not a bad beer."
"37.5 cl green, corked and bailed bottle. Purchased at Whole Foods in Vienna, VA."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had in 15+ years of drinking lambic. The almost greenish/gold color is the only thing remotely off-putting about this beer. I wouldn't care if it was bright purple...it's one of the best, if not the best lambic I've had. Poured into a goblet and the whole room smells like band-aid, baby skin, sandlewood, girl-parts, faint clove-honey and not a single trace of hop. The mouthfeel is wine like and low carbonation almost like the unblended Cantillon. You don't need to be paying attention to get bowled over by a rush of floral sour but a attentive drinker will thrill to the most complex aftertaste I know that develops on your tongue for well over a minute. Pears strained through suede, green grapes, sweet rice, tallegio cheese are the main tastes I can verbalize. This is a lambic poseur-disposer as the high funk and tart factors will repel the uninitiated. I ate dates wrapped in bacon with this and it balances with the salty sweetness so well I almost wept. Those that find most fruit lambics cloying and crave the most complex - this is it. This is an elite beer for an experienced lambic drinker and once you've had this...only the top flight geuze will scratch your lambic itches. Track it down...share it only with those in the know and don't feel too freaky if you also don't mind it spraying all over your face. One of the top 5 beers I know and essential if you like geuze."
"37.5cL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a medium orange color with one finger of head. A little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is funk funk funk. Lots of that classic barnyard funk. A little bit of white grape aroma as well. The taste is more and more funky. The flavors are fantastic, tart, yet a little sweet. No offensive flavors whatsoever. Lots of great horse flavors! Yummy. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is great for a Gueuze. Thanks a lot to Kev for this beer!"
"Pours a brilliant golden color with a very modest coating of head. Very clear. The nose is sour and tart. Nice Brett character. Smells like a gueuze should. Very crisp and inticing. Flavor is so good. Intense funky sour hits first, but fades just as quick as the punch. The finish is very mellow wheaty. Very little sticky spit hangs on with the finish. Divine. The feel is moderate with a very fine carbonation. Drinkability is outstanding. The sourness is not offensive, as I found the Cuvee Rene. It doesn't cling to my mouth or hang on. Very crisp and refreshing. Not offensive. I truely enjoy this brew. Sour beers are quickly becoming like crack to me, so this is a true treat."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sour and acidic with some fruity hints. The flavor is very sour, but very tasty. Very sour. Extremely tasty, but the sour isn't really my thing - but I can respect it. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good, if you can respect the style."
"Surprisingly dark golden yellow pour, moderately hazy, almost orangey. Amazingly balanced aroma. Huge sweet malt kiss complements the character loaded brettanomyces that come out horsey, cheesy and sweaty. Funky and clean at the same time, but above all elegant and farmy. Apparently sweet which have me anticipating a dessert gueuze. Notes of vanilla, cask wood, sand, earth. Indeed very sweet for a gueuze, this is not really what I was anticipating, but I can appreciate greatness when I taste it and this is just as good as Cuvée René with incredible nostalgic character. Pie crust and bread. Not very acid at all, just a balancing tartness. Honeyed maltiness gets overwhelmed by wood juice, powdery glue-like flavors. I dont really feels the taste was as good as the incredible aroma, but it does grow on me as it warms. It just has this terrific sandy dry-out effect that asks to be let on the table taking some air and breathing like fine wines. Gentle astringency, fitting low carbonation. Medium-full bodied and smooth on the tongue. One of the best in its kind and worthy of every bit of praise it gathers. Complex beyond imagination all while being insanely drinkable. Thanks again Per. <br> A further sampling confirms to me that the real girardin gueuze outclasses cuvée rené by a fair margin as my favorite gueuze. Highly drinkable yet very assertive. It just does everything as I want it and for now stands as the best Ive had, though some of those rare drie fonteinen look like they could stand up to its level."
"Not as interesting as I had hoped. I enjoyed it, but it doesnt stand out as special to me in this category. Worth a try to find out for yourself."
"Drinkability... pretty damn good. Although I would not want two in a row, I could go for two in a session, broken up by perhaps a wheat beer or something light and not too hoppy."
"Cork Marking: 0103: Poured a bubbly pinkish, yellow, orange color with a small cream tan head and a little lacing on the glass. Tart acidic, sour, horseblanket aroma. Tart citrus (lemon peel and apples), oaky, and woody, with a crisp, dry finish. My bottle did not explode."
"side note: i am glad i had the opportunity to try this AFTER many standard-to-above average gueuzes, otherwise my appreciation would be limited. if you can get it, fine.. fridge it and get some others to try first. the results will be amazing."
"Drinkability- My first gueuze, and certainly not my last. This one was a good one to start with."
"This beer is damn drinkable. My 12.7oz bottle is not enough. I purchased my bottle in Iowa City, IA. I was surprised to see it and I hope there is more when I return. I really loved every aspect of it. Not only is it incredibly flavorsome and extremely complex it is exceedingly refreshing! What a great summery beer. It is low in alcohol as well. But dont misunderstand me; this beer would be great anytime, anywhere. If you want a great Guezue I suggest Girardin. Damn near total perfection. Highly Recommended."
"As I gather myself to sample -- soooo souour. My tongue is chasing creme fraiche over fresh cut apple wood, across boards in a roquefort aging room, over buttermilk spills, and across river rock, and then I let it rest in a squeezed out lime half. This must be what a dog feels when licking his privates after a day of chasing livestock. This is a bewitching fermented food."
"Right up there with some of Cantillon's jewels for best-in-class."
"Hazy apricot. Large white head. Sour lemon aroma with the funk in the background. The taste is sour. Very sour. Fruity, but unlike any single fruit I've had. I guess grapes is the closest. A little spicy too. I've heard War Heads candy used to describe the taste of a gueuze before, but it never seemed quite right until I tried this gueuze. This definitely makes the cheeks pucker a bit. But as others have described, it's quite drinkable. I find it very difficult to put my glass down. I would have liked the mouthfeel to be a little fuller. This beer doesn't coat the mouth and leave behind a barnyard flavor the way some other gueuzes. On the other hand, unlike some gueuzes, I wish I could drink this every day. This is a great beer."
"Mouthfeel is moderate. I can definitely drink this one. But to be honest, not my most favorite."
"Pours a dark hazy yellow. Very pungent smell almost like grapefruit juice and champagne. The taste is overwhelming. At first I thought something was wrong because it was so sour, but the bartender explained to me that its how it should be. Definitely not a beer you can drink fast, only sip slow. I can see the craft in it, but as for something that I would have on a regular basis I don't know... I guess that any fan of beer who wants to try something totally new would be into this."
"33 ml. bottle. Extremely cloudy yellow-orange, with retaining thin head around the rim, and noticeable lace. Aroma of cider and bleach. Initial taste of rounded softened apple juice sourness. Cannot be drunk quickly, only sipped. Sour vinegar and acid leads to tongue freezing, mouth puckering, and jaw fatigue that was tolerable and long lasting. Aftertaste was a medicinal drying,unresolved for hours by water. Medium in texture on the mouth. Thanks Clarkevv. This is not my preferred style, and I am striving to rate it within its style."
"Pours a somewhat hazy deep orange color with amber hues and a beautiful light white head that just leaves a tickle of a lace. Aromas are a mix of spiced tart apples along with some black pepper and some fun loving barnyard and earthy grass tones. Initially this brew starts off with tart apple and pear notes with a zinging carbonation that dances all around on my pallate. Following there are hints of spices, specifically pepper, with some strong acidic and citric notes. The finish is nicely sour and tart, with firm catty tones are a slightly dry end. Overall this is definetly one of the kings of gueuzes and I will definetly be seeking out more of this whenever I can."
"Overall: This is my first gueuze, and I'm rather impressed. I couldn't drink this every day, but rather I'd save it for special occasions."
"Easily the best gueuze Ive had. The beer pours a beautiful pinkish amber verging on copper with a moderate, but dense, white head. The aroma is very fruity -- underripe peaches and apricots, horse blanket musty. The flavor is definitely sour, it comes across as salty by somehow activating those sensors on the tongue, but the saltiness turns into a puckering tartness on the back of the tongue. The tartness doesnt overwhelm the rest of the beer, though as gree peach/apricot fruit mingles with a slight bit of sweetened toast malt. All of these flavors meld wonderfully into a complex and tasty lambic. Easier to drink than I expected, actually."
"This is a refreshing, smooth-drinking beer that cleanses the palate. Off to try other gueuze beers. :)"
"Overall: WOW, just wow. I had been putting off trying a geuze for a long time because I've read the reviews and was kind of put off by the supposed ""funkiness"" of the style. I'm kind of kicking myself now for not trying more of them sooner. This is a style that I could see myself drinking much more than I probably should. I never believed in love at first sight, until now..."
"Drinkability: This stuff can't be good for my digestive system, but I guess that's why we have Tums. If you're looking for an authentic gueuze, this is probably one of the best ones to seek out."
"This is lovely. Orange/peach hazed beer with a big, lacey head that fades back very quickly. Strong aromatics, of course -- orange, lactic acid, household cleaner -- maybe some grass. Intensely sour but lacking the lactic punch of Cantillon. A strong leafy bitterness mingles with the tartness. Dry as a bone. Lacks a little something."
"Taste: Sharp acidity and bitterness, but with great effervescence. Totally strange the way it refreshes and dries you out at the same time. A very good Gueuze."
"Halfway in, the sour attack on the tongue is not as harsh, and it slips ever easier down, feeling even thicker on the palate. I pass the night with a few of these, no problem. Pretty snappy gueuze they got goin' on..."
"I love Gueuze, and I hate the fact that its unavailable in Ontario (or Ridiculously expensive). This is truly the best style of beer in the world."
"Nice surprise to have this one pop up at the tasting party at the General Lafayatte!"
"Strong, dry and superb. Grapefruit in the backround throughout which leads to orange and then a strong, lingering and spicy finish. This was a lovely tasting Gueuze. Superb."
"Drinkability: Let's be honest. This is a great beer -- but one for special occasions. Plus, it is so acidic, I can barelt get through one."
"Comments  I cant begin to express my appreciation to TheBum for popping this at the 2004 AleOha First Annual Derby Party Celebration. He brought this out after a rather long day of drinking, but damed if this didnt revive the taste buds. What a treat!"
"Really.. top notch stuff. This is well balanced, tasty, and yet amazingly approachable. (In other words while this brew has a lot of the same characteristics of other great gueuzes, the acidity and enteric bacteria qualities are restrained for a more drinkable brew.)"
"Huge carbonated on the pour and in the bottle. Very pale white head. Huge sweet white grapes and caramel smell to the brew. Wonderful nose. Initial sweet caramel and grape juice taste. This is then followed by a sour dry blueberry finish. Sparkely lively mooth mouthfeel. It is very refreshing and smooths and soothes... Velvet finish. Wish I could get this at home..."
"Overall Impression: A good geuze, but the bitterness was initially a bit too much for my taste. However, about halfway through the serving, I had gotten used to the bitterness and it was actually quite nice. A world-class geuze for sure and a must for anyone exploring this style."
"I had this again at the Brugge Bear the other week. It still kicks ass and is one of the best gueuzes around. I wish that this one made it to the states though...paging Dan Shelton...hello Mr. Shelton!"
"Smells quite musty not that sour smelling, a bit of oakiness as well. This beer is quite clear in appearance. Tastes sour with an astringent oakiness to it as well. Definitely going to have to try this one again."
"This brew pours a very envigorated large head of small bubbles that was mostly diminishing. Its body was a hazy light orange brown color. The aroma was very bubbly and fruity. It had a dry complex flavor and it was not much of a flavor I cared for. It fruity citrusy flavor was dry from start to finish."
"I want people to drink this at my funeral."
"My favourie gueuze without a doubt. This exhibits the most complex and juicy flavours of any gueuze i've tried. Some very smelly barnyard characters, couple with a lemony, grassy acidity towards the end. Very round palate. A very juicy mouthfeel. And the aroma is simply mouthwatering. Its so refreshing that beers like this exist, something rare, completely different and simply a pleasure to drink. In comparison to the filtered White Label version, this shows a bit more complexity, a bit more juicy sourness, simply amazing.........."
