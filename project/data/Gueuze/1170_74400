In the nose, lacto-lemon, apple skin, hints of sulfur and crackery malts. Pretty darn sour on the palate, lacto, lemon and apple acidity, moderate notes of sulfur, yogurt, cobwebs, some acetic puckeriness, oak, dried leaves, and distant crackery malts in the background. Medium body, dry and acidic mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Interesting to call this a gueuze, but I guess the brewing/blending process makes it that. Regardless, a solid and enjoyable sour overall. I'd like to try it with a few years on it.","Rifugium","May 10, 2014"

The nose comprises tart lemon zest, light vinegar, light funk, and orange juice. The taste brings in more of the same, with some hefty sourness and a few veins of slightly-sweeter red wine vinegar every now and again. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn fine sour, one that brings the tartness with a vengeance.

Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured bright orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, peach, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, orange peel, orange, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This was the last beer of the evening and we definitely saved the best for last in my opinion. Loads of complexity to be found here while still being refreshing and intriguing. It was completely different from the fruit lambics by them, so don’t go into this one expecting them to be similar. Just a heads up. Definitely worth seeking out whether it be Batch 1 or 2.","thagr81us","Jun 15, 2012"

Pineapple and lemon fruitiness lends some depth. Fair bit of oak hits the palate up front, but doesn't linger into the finish. The finish is quite brief actually, very lactic and somewhat yogurt-y. The acidity is felt going down, which makes it somewhat of a chore to drink after a while, though it's a pretty decent beer in small quantities.

Dry and great beer as suspected. This tastes old, spritzy, and fantastic. Hopefully the bottle variation isn't as nuts as their other releases.

It smells of a concoction of Uplands lambics and is heavy on Persimmon and Kiwi especially, which is fine, their two best in my opinion. It is very fruit forward before going into a nice and clean lactic sour. The flavor is fruit forward too and again heavy on Persimmon and Kiwi with some slight butter, ala California Chardonnay. It drinks light and effervescent (sp?) and is pretty clean with a light and subtly dry finish. Overall I'd say its Upland's finest, behind their Persimmon lambic.","aasher","0"
