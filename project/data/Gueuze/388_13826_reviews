"2010 bottle, pours pale.   Aroma is light dough malt and big oak and barnyard funk.  Taste is soft and funky, sawdust, light tart, excellent beer."

"2010 vintage. Some barnyard funk in the aroma, taste was very funky but easy to drink. Would like to try it fresh."

"2001 vintage. Great representation of the style"
""
"OVERALL: Good stuff all around. Found this to be much fruitier and slightly acidic compared to the dank and musty regular gueuze, which is a big plus in my book. Something I could easily polish off over an evening and one I hope to enjoy again in the near future."

"Huge thanks to Thirtybird for this one.  2010 vintage served in a Hill Farmstead taster.  Pours a golden-orange hue with a frothy, bright white head that dissipates into a sudsy slick.  Clarity is semi-hazy.  Nose is musty and expresses citrus zest and cork.  The taste on this beer is very good, but not mind-blowing given the ratings.  I get cork, citrus rind and citric acid; however, nothing really stands out.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively carbonation and a pleasant astringency.  Overall, a solid gueuze but not my favorite Cantillon.  Perhaps a little more time in the cellar was needed?"

"Overall: a solid geuze no doubt. the taste is very nice but its fairly mellow. I think it could really use a bit more sour strength or funkiness. I'd be interested in tasting a few vintages together to really get a feel for this one."

"O: This is a big-time sour, sour. Not for the faint (non sour) hearted.  This is worth the price/hassle/patience - really. Lots of stuff going on with the bacteria and wild Belgium yeast makes this top-shelf.  I did get a strong vinegar smell and taste, but that comes with the territory."

"This beer is mainly a gueuze, yet it has been flavored. It is hard to pinpoint flavors, but sour apples are present. It does not deviate much from a gueuze though. Pours a reddish beer, just like a Lou Pepe, but it does look a bit lighter as it pours. Little foam. Smell is funky. It is a light yet syrupy beer. Not very sour like other gueuzes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright lemons, green apple are the tart flavors as a barnyard funk hits the middle. A mild honeyed sweetness at the end balances the beer out and cuts away from the upfront tart."

"A must try gueuze."
"O: Very tasty and exceedingly drinkable at 5% and with such light tartness. Among the LP versions, I think the Kriek is my favorite. This is about as good as 3F OG. Off the top of my head, I canâ€™t distinguish this and Classic Gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my favorite of the Lou Pepe Series! Fram and Kriek are also amazing, but a gueuze is the perfect style for cantillion funk. I think this is far superior to cantillion classic gueuze. This beer is in my top 5 gueuze that I have tried. Cantillion LPG is not quite as good as, but gets close to 3F Lente, 3F Golden Blend, and Bullfrog Vertiable gueuze."
""
"O - Stellar. Outstanding flavor profile with a near-perfect mouthfeel. The best example of the style I've had."
""
""
"Pours clear golden colored with a small white fluffy head. Aroma is of the lemon peel and mint leaf kind that I get from a lot of gueuze, some dry dusty oak, funky yeast, very nice. Flavor is pretty funky lacto sour with lemon peels, super dusty dryness, oak, some other citrus notes, hay. Excellent. Like this better than the Classic Gueuze version. Body is very light, with medium plus carbonation and super easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the finest I've had from Cantillon and the three years age has added a good amount of funk, quite perfect at the moment (or is it this hot weather?) As of late, this, Zomer, and Duck Duck Gooze are my favorite among the ""style"". Could drink this all day, everyday. Mid-palate is full of complexity while the finish is a lot cleaner. It's that clean finish that makes this so drinkable. Look forward to re-visiting this soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The softer acidity and high complexity make this one that I'd love to drink regularly, but as a difficult-to-land, special occasion gueuze, it doesn't necessarily bring the fireworks."

"750ml corked and capped. The belt and suspenders approach. A 2010 vintage. Normally I'd talk appearance first but the moment you open the bottle there is this fantastic vinegar wood sugar smell. Pouring it into the glass I get more candi sugar, lemons, apricots. Nice, nice, nice. The pour is a hazy gold with a very active head that settles into a nice creamy layer and then leaves just a hint of lacing. Taste is absolutely incredible. It starts with an orange lemon citrus flavor, then a nice chewy sour followed by a woody dryness. There is a LOT going on in this beer. The aftertaste is almost vanilla and very pleasant. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and then almost sticky. Very nice and adds to the overall feeling of substantialness. Overall, what can I say, this is definitely one of the best gueuzes I've ever had, hands down."

"Light amber in color with a bit of haziness. A minuscule layer of off white foam covers the majority of the top of the beer. Aroma of pineapple and green apples is very compelling. The body is moderately carbonated,crisp,and dry. The front of the palate is sharp with a champagne like taste that quickly tuns to pineapple and green apple with a quick dry finish. Very refreshing."

"this is of course, wonderful gueuze, but given the hype surrounding it, and in the context of a number of other comparable versions more readily available on the market, it just didn't wow me like i expected it to. thanks as usual, to drlovemd87 for procuring this and choosing to share it with me. its pale blonde to straw in color, and i can see bubbles but it never amasses any head. this is a 2009 vintage by the way, and its got a great nose of funky oak, lacto, and white wheat malt that has stood the test of time. the funk is there, and so is the sour, and the oak adds a lot more than usual, i mean, this is really oak dominated, woody in taste, semisweet, and clean finishing. not nearly as sour as it is funky, more of a must than a funk really, old and dank, mature might be the right word. its just not coming at me in waves, and it almost seems like a simple beer, lacking the complexity of others, maybe in a good way, maybe not. either way, it tastes almost familiar, and if this is the standard by which the style is measured, there are a lot of good copy cats out there. still, i love the yeast, and i love the softer feel to this, just a tickle of carbonation and a very easy drinking medium body. fun and special beer, but not a drink of the gods as some say, just great gueuze."

"Very interesting take on the geuze style. I don't think this is supposed to be a classical geuze style, but rather more of a blend of 2-year old lambics. It shows here- more complex but less effervescent and refreshing than Classic Geuze. Worth trying at least once, but I would suggest that your resources are better off going towards the Lou Pepe Kriek or Framboise."

"750mL 2005 black foil thanks to Manuele at Ma Che Siete. From the basket, it pours a hazy, glowing, light orange with a fizzy white head dwindling down quickly from the acid. Aroma is massive white grapefruit, blood orange, sweet orange sorbet, peach, subtle funk. Very fresh and rich blood orange dominant. As it warms you are rewarded with mace and wet cinnamon stick. Taste is dried grapefruit, pomelo, lemon tart, lactic fattiness. Bitter white grapefruit and pomelo come in to balance the sourness, but there is just nowhere near the balance and freshness I get from 2005 Iris or Russian River Beatification. Palate is uber mouth watering, so lactic sour that it is near lacerative (I had to drink most of the bottle myself unfortunately). But in small quantities the palate is fresh, fruity, and soft. Really so beautiful. Bound to age extremely well."

"O - a real find in terms of drinkability. Reading the website after confrims the idea of subtle in this style and it works a treat."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm a huge Cantillon fan and their regular gueuze is one of my favorites, so I had very high expectations coming into this. With that being said, I was definitely disappointed in this one. It's a good gueuze for sure, but doesn't live up to it's hype or up to the standard of other Cantillon beers."
""
""
""
"Pale and very clear - gueuze tumbler. Definitely a bigger layer of flavor and more sour finish than the standard gueuze. Barnyard funk, hay, citrus zest, a touch acidic, white grape skin, brett. Liked this very much - it was rainin Lou Pepe's in Brussels!"

"Good funk on the nose and a nice lactic sourness with moderate levels of funk on the palate. I'll be honest, I expected more out of this bottle. It has nice characteristics but nothing I haven't gotten out of a regular bottle of aged Cantillon Geueuze. The flavor may have been a little better in some of those tbh. Although, it is a good beer. I just wanted this to be a touch better."

"This is such an off-putting beer to the uninitiated. I've had many beers of this style that I like, so I'm happy to sit here, drink and enjoy, but the fact is there's nothing special to really recommend this, so I almost feel like the sourness has an arrogance to it, like ""if people don't like this then they're wrong and fuck them"" whereas there should be more offered for 'lay' people to enjoy rather than just pure 'off', funky acidity."

"Slightly hazy. Aromas of hay, mild lemon, and a touch of sulfur. Lightly sweet with moderate tartness and lot of minerality. Medium carbonation and medium-light body. This has been a long-term want and I'm glad to have finally gotten to try it, but overall it was a bit of a disappointment and didn't stand up to most of the rest of the Cantillon line-up, in my opinion."

"2002 sticker 750 ml bottle generously shared by cpferris. Big thanks to Chad. Pours a clear amber with a small white head that settles to a ring. The aroma is super funky. Lots of must. Grapefruit, mushroom, forest floor. The taste is quite tart and funky. There is grapefruit, lemon, and apricot. The Finish is very tart and funky with some oak and a bit of astringency. Medium body. Low carbonation. Quite great. Possibly the funkiest beer I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours near flat, clear and golden. Reminds me of iced tea or close to it. The nose/taste is very funky as expected with scents of earth, soil, stone fruits, un-ripened berries and slight green apples. Despite looking near flat there is plenty of fine carbonation on the palate. Fuzzy mouthfeel,good dose of acid. Reminds me of sweet tarts. Solid all-around. Thanks again Chad."

"Golden-colored, surprisingly and utterly clear, Champagne-like bubbles rose to a small foamy white head that receded to a thin layer within a few seconds; no real lacing to speak of. Aroma was fairly mild, notes of funk, horseblanket, and minor touches of acetic/lactic acid. About the same in the taste, mellowed-out with a few years of aging, fairly oaky, funk, hay, lemon, apples skins, cobwebs, wheaty malts, again, minor acidic notes, but nothing too tart or overbearing. Light-medium body, and decently drinkable, I just really don't like the oak/wood quality in this beer; I think it clashes with the other flavors too much. After having the Classic Gueuze first, I definitely liked this one better than that. I've had the Classic before, but it was nice to be able to compare these two back to back."
""
"This is medium bodied with a modest amount of lively carbonation. It is complex, refreshing and easy drinking with seemingly no alcohol impact. I am going to venture a guess and say this is about the 4th or 5th time I have had lou pepe geuze between the 05 and 08 vintage. I shit you not, this beer tastes wildly different with every experience. This is perhaps the most fruited and zesty iteration of any cantillon I have had. I hope my other bottles are like this!"

"Until today, I'd only had Classic Gueuze, and this completely blows it away. Awesome aroma with much more complexity and depth of flavor than the regular gueuze. Stronger puckering sourness too. All in all, a much more mature lambic (in more ways than one) that I wish was more easily available."
"Overall, excellent. A very nice beer. No problem finishing this bottle solo."
"A massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 Beers* @ 40 Birthday Bash! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a golden yellow with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, lemon zest, funk, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, citrus, sour, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. The Lou Pepe treatment really added a nice touch to this brew. There was a nice citrus/lemon aspect going on in this one in both the aroma and flavor. This made it really easy to drink and balanced out the sour and tart characters going on. Definitely worth trying if you have not done so."
""
"Recommend."
""
""
""
""
"Cantillon Lou Pepe Gueuze is one of the best spontaneously fermented beers to have ever passed my lips. Although it may not be super complex, it is immensely flavorful and astonishingly drinkable. I wish I had purchased more of these when I had the chance to do so."

"Really gorgeous beer. In fact, very near sublime. It's so smooth, and yet with all the refined haughtiness of the best gueuzes. I love that the acidity is so restrained. It makes for a less raw and powerful, but more sophisticated brew. Really, the skill that has gone into its preparation is astonishing."
""
"o - Overall this is a fantastic gueuze and an improvement on the Classic Gueuze, which is one of my all time favorites. Another winner in the Lou Pepe series, I think I would rank this very slightly behind the LP Kriek and in front of the LP Framboise. Super funky and cheesey, would love to get some bottles of this one."
""
"Pours a murky honey yellow with an off-white head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is just all over the place with sour, funk, tart, and barnyard aromas. Taste is exactly the same as the smell with an acidic bite to it. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good gueuze with some extreme aromas and flavors."
"2007. 750 ml bottle into, in de verzekering tegen de grotto dorst lambic/gueuze glass. Huge, active, fluffy, soapy head with high retention and lacing. Aroma of green apple, horse blanket and light sweetness. Taste refreshingly sour, tongue coating, jaw stretching and puckering. Very very tasty.Â "
"Good mouthfeel, nice and salty and sour."
"2008 vintage; bottled 4/11/11. Pours yellow in color with a soft, white head on it that settles to form a nice rim around the glass. The nose is sweet citrus, hay, lemon. Taste starts with lots of sweet sugars up front that move into more citric flavors. A little funk gets added to the mix and then tartness overtakes it. This is super sweet and sugary, which works well in the size I tasted. I think a whole bottle would induce diabetes in a normal person, however I highly recommend splitting amongst others! Another winner from the LP series."
""
"O: Smoother and less initial in your face sour than a recent standard release Cantillon gueuze. Nice last beer to end my short trip to Belgium."
""
"O - fantastic beer very interesting and very enjoyable. Very complex flavor that i'm sure I didn't do justice in this review"
""
""
""
""
"Meh, over priced gueuze that's nothing special for at least 5 years. Who has the time and money for that?"
""
"Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. Taste and feel is a bit thin in the middle but overall is quite typical of a Gueuze..."
""
"O- This beer is superb, I have yet to be let down by Cantillon, Really nice, well balanced, easy drinking, with a perfect amount of sourness and funk, I could drink this all day."
"Overall, this was a lot like classic. Very drinkable and very flavorful. Amazing beer. I could drink a lot of this."
""
""
"O - Wow, very nice. Now I see what the fuss is about."
""
"The tart sourness of this beer is upfront all the way through, but just behind it is a complex barny horsey funkyness that seems to evolve with every sip."
""
""
"Lastly I don't understand why this is classified as a gueuze as it is only two year old lambic - no blending!"
""
""
"Golden amber hue with a rather small amount of off white head. Surprisingly modest lactic sour. More funk than sour. The mold and wet wood are very prominent. Wet straw and lemons. Flavors are much more sour. The lactic is bitingly tart with plenty of moldy wood and dirty basement. A touch of black pepper in the finish. Lightish body with mild carbonation. Overall a great gueuze. Although I was hoping for a tongue ripping sour."
""
""
"This is the 2008 vintage and yeah i know its a little early to be cracking it but after today i thought i deserve it plus i always like comparing beers when fresh compared to aged and it pours a hazy apricot hue which leaves a wispy one finger head that doesnt stay long and not much lacing either,the smell is parmesan cheese,white grapes,vinegar and wet hay,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,zesty and bone dry and has nice tastes of Sav Blanc grapes,lemon zest,a touch of tangerines and finished with a funky sour dryness that makes you want another sip straight away and overal without doubt this has to be one of the top versions of this style fresh or aged as this brew will definately hold for the 20years it says it will on the back label and thoroughly recommend you try cheers."

"Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is light with moderate carbonation; very light and refreshing. Overall a very good gueuze. Would have liked to see it a touch more sour, as it was more balanced between the unripe fruits vs. funk and lactic sourness."
"Though I hate to say it, I almost wished for more heartburning acidity from this bottle. The tart, enamel-melting funk I hoped for never quite came through, and though this is still a fine gueuze, I expected more."
"Overall - a tasty treat, but sadly, not as good as it's easier to find brothers, Framboise and Kriek."
"Overall: The age on this beer has clearly added to the robustness of the flavor. Unfortunately, the flavor is a little lighter than I would want from a gueuze."
"Overall: This was so smooth my wife enjoyed it, and she hates sour beer. Just awesome."
"O - Best Geuze that I have had to date. The balance between the flavours is just magic and I could drink it all day long."
"Interesting stuff and I understand why this beers so sought after, at 25$ a bottle that says something. I'm having a good time learning about funky stuff can't wait until I can afford some more to see how it ages"
"This is a great beer , again the balance is just perfect. Often times I like the tarter gueuzes, but with a meal or taking down a 75 solo, this geueze is perfect."
"750ml bottle â€“ thanks to Troy for sharing. Pours a hazy gold with little head. Aromas of funky, horse blanket and straw. Loads of lemon zest and mellowed vinegar. Flavor is a nice balance of citrus and funk, with leather and earthy notes. Not a super sour beer, but rather a nice gueuze overall and a perfect summer brew. Flavors last long on the finish and end refreshingly nice. Well done."
"This beer pours a bit darker than most gueuzes I have had. it is a reddish color no doubt from the wine barrels it was aged in. the smell is acetic funky and definite red wine notes. the flavor is sour again nice flavors from the red wine barrels, and a decent amount of funk. the mouthfeel is light puckering and well carbonated. A truly Excellent example of a Gueuze"
"M: Light, oily and smooth in the mouth, but light carbonation detracts a bit from the experience for me"
"Grandfather Gueuze looks the part with a deep gold color with some bronze and orange highlights towards the sides. A nice cap of bright white foam that leaves some small streaks on the glass that glide down not fully sticking. Whoa, the musk on this one is undeniably old Gueuze. Big scents of oak from the longer time in the barrels, wood, lemon zest, hay, barnyard funk and sour bugs. It's really bold and that's what counts. Taste is off the charts, a deep sour that is large yet not tounge reducing. Swishing this around the mouth really does wonders. Tastes of old wet wood/oak with a blast of earthy tastes from the barn including hay. Citrus is on the lemon side with trace orange. Malted barley makes a appearence at times but don't look for it to save you from the sour attack that grandpappy is. Feel is light bodied like most gueuze, highly carbonated, fizzy and a bit scorching on the tounge after a few sips. Puckering is a understatement, a bit acetic on the end. This one is a shocker and I only wish I could find some bottles to lay down, but that ain't happening anytime soon."
"D. Great. Soft and subtle with nice tartness and good body."
"Pours a very murky hazy yellowish. Almost no head. Pours fairly thick. Smells funky and floral. Tastes fruity (peachy) and floral. Sme nice tart sour funk. Thick on the tongue. Overall very interesting. The thick lightly carbonated mouthfeel is very nice"
"8.2/10"
"Cheers!"
"2005 Vintage. Poured very cloudy, much more so than the classic gueuze. Not overly carbonated, not much head. Very strong aroma of grapefruit acidity. Taste is much of the same, so much sweet grapefruit acidity. Very very sour, but still drinkable. Excellent beer."
"(D)- I like this gueuze. It has a happy marriage of dry earthy funk and a mellow fruity acidity. The beauty of this one really is in its balance, complex profile, and restrained potency. This is a great drinking gueuze that would be great to have around to have with meals and perhaps a snack of artisan cheeses."
"Lambics are a very interesting style of beer. Not something I drink on a regular basis but something I enjoy when I want something radically different."
"Dry, light, and easy to drink despite the strong acidic sourness, this tasting has proven to be quite a case study in the peculiarities and spontaneity of natural fermentation. This is far different from the other great lambics of the tasting, and it still manages to hold its own. The more still mouthfeel and resulting body really does help this beer out. Another great offering from Cantillon."
"I do like the sour, but not just for the mere sake of it. That said, this has it in spades, but with the caveat of a nicely supportive dose of malt, fruit and yeast, which are deftly balanced when taken as a whole. Generally dry and somewhat acerbic - sure - but genuinely tasty all on its own, or I imagine, with some appropriate food - pommes frites, anyone?"
"A light body with low carbonation. Very well melded creating a ""sum is greater than the parts""effect. Less sour but more subdued and mellow than I expected. An awesome gueuse. Opens up as it warms. I could drink this all night. A great last beer of the night. Nothing can top this."
"D: What is surprising about this beer is the stark contrast between the 2000 and 2001 vintages. 2001 was, in my opinion, far and away, a superior beer with more funk, more tartness, and simply more character. Still, regardless of the vintage, seek this one out and sit on it. A gem of a beer."
"Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it, this is one of those beers definitey trying at least once, and even more than that if you can afford it. An incredible example of craftsmanship when it comes to blending lambics."
"Poured a murky golden orange in color with pale yellow highlights that had no head and left hardly and lacing sticking to the glass. The nose had the signature cantillon barnyard wethorse blanket bretty funk with huge oak notes some citrus and sour acidic character. A nice blast of mouthpuckering sour citrusy acidic flavors punch the palate but had some nice bretty funky oaky barrel accents. The brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, oaky, barnyard funky, sour, and mild dry finish that lingered on the taste buds. It iis really one of the best gueuzes from cantillon and one of the best overall that I've try so far. It was really tasty and drank pretty good."
"If this wasn't so much, I would drink it every day for the rest of my life. It was really quite a treat to drink. I enjoyed every sip."
"This 2007 vintage is drinking excellently and is worth every cent. Cantillon excels at producing highly drinkable lambics of outstanding quality, abd this is no different."
"Real nice horsey funk with a bit of gym socks thrown in, light citrus (oranges and lemon), hint of apple, woody and earthy, hint of straw, light vinous quality. A bit of a heftier malt bill than many geuzes, gives it a softer mouthfeel, a bit chewier. Balanced acidity unlike some of the other Lou Pepe series, relatively drinkable (split the bottle in 2). A really nice offering."
"B: 50, 5, 13, 18, 8 = 94"
"Pours a copper with a huge head (the cork gave a huge pop). Aromas are deep citrus/orange with nice tropical notes of pineapple and a bit of characteristic lambic. The palette evokes more pineapple with a faint astringency. The high carbonation hits simultaneously with the acidity to give a crisp, refreshing pop to the finish."
"Drinkability: As with most Cantillons, they make for pretty great examples of the style. The funk, the smell, the taste, the look . . . Cantillon's got it down. I would gladly have again, only, if only, it were more available. Bravo. Belgium trip, if only you could arrive sooner!"
"Liquer-like mouthfeel with no real hint of carbonation. Lets you know you are sipping something fine and should not overindulge, as does the vinergary burn in the back of your throat. I will have trouble finishing this 750 alone, but will feel blessed to have done so. So good."
"D: Extremely drinkable. It would be quite easy to throw back several glasses."
"Pours a slightly hazed straw color with a white head and bits of lacing. Nose brigs forward a moderate amount of funk, thogh not what I generally expect from Cantillon. There does seem to be a lot going on with some hay, leather, and a bit of citrus zest. The taste doesn't quite live up as this is not nearly as multidimensional as what you typically get from Cantillon. Feel is nice and integrated. Drinks well but not as special as I had hoped."
"Beer is thin and moderately carbonated in the mouth. Its mildly acidic, mildly citric and lactic is the winner here. This is some oakiness and funk to it. Its not as good as the classic gueuze, which I suppose I should be happy about since this beer is more expensive and harder to get but I was just expecting more. The comparison of the Lou Pepe Kriek and the 100% Kriek lambic is nearly universally agreed that the Lou Pepe is much much better. This beer, in my opinion, does not improve from the base. Still, its a good gueuze and another good beer from Cantillon."
"2001 bottle. Cork comes out without a pop, little fragment left strewn about. Pours a clear gold with a thin head that recedes to naught. Very sour, lemony nose, especially after the old Drie Fonteinen and De Cam offerings we devoured previously. Pungent, sour flavor, very musty and funky. Maybe a touch of white wine vinegar. This is quite dry and intense. Reminded me a bit of Cantillon LH12, but blended with their standard gueuze. Had a lot of that earthy, pungent bite to it at this age."
"D-good balance of acidity, the funk is there but it fades a little in the taste, the citrus profile is nice and the tartness is moderate and enjoyable."
"A singular gueuze -- one of the greats."
"D: Like the other Lou Pepe beers, this one is really easy to drink. Not insanely sour but well balanced and nice to sit down and drink."
"D: Quite the Gueuze. Even more age should treat this beer favorably. Can't wait to crack my 2000 vintage."
"Not the most complex gueuze I've had, but still impressive. Bold flavors, challenging in a good way, & not too strong ABV-wise, which is always a plus. Not one you could drink one after the other, granted, but pretty rewarding."
"Price = $23.00 at Whole Foods Bowery"
"Another fantastic lambic from Cantillon. Super refreshing and less funky and more sweet than I was expecting."
"Notes: 2007 Gueuze, bottle on 12 October 2009. This is a fairly mellow sour with the flavors much more in an equal balance with the fruitiness. This still is a sour beer, no question. Good easy to drink sour that has a good mix of flavors and won't kill your palate or overload you with tart/sour/acidic flavors. Definitely worth a try."
"Great mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. As always, amazingly unique and interesting."
"mouthfeel is light and airy, and it is very refreshing, making the drinkability great."
"D - This was really easy-drinking. If it weren't so expensive I'd have it more often. Fairly balanced in the flavor dimensions associated with gueuze - sour, sweet, funky, and tart. Not sure if I prefer to Classic Gueuze, but it's on the same level for sure."
"Notes: To enjoy this beer is to experience a true lambic from the world's foremost producer of the style."
"Feel and Drinkability: The beer finishes bone dry, like I'm parched in the desert. Oakiness really compliments the dryness as does the tartness which leads to dryness then gives way to massive oak character and an unparalleled dry quality. This is one unique beer, and I'll happily finish it. I'm definitely going to enjoy the rest of this one. However, its a bit pricey, or well just plain expensive at about $24 for this 750. I've really got to be in the mood for this type of beer, this isn't just an anytime beer. It'd take a certain mood for me to go after this again. Definitely worth a try and an awesome experience. Don't pass it up, it'll broaden your horizons...its done so for me."
"Drinkability: Drank the entire bottle myself and when it was finished, I wished I had another bottle."
"D - Extremely pungent and tart with enough barnyard notes to make even the cows perk up and take notice. This is definitely over the top but still retains some semblance of drinkability in the process."
"D - Complex and drinkable, this is a classic gueuze. The funk is complex and the sourness is substantial, but smooth enough that it doesn't crush the palate. The malt character is noticeable and there are some complex spicy notes that make this stand out from other examples of the style. The aroma in particular is very nice, with a complex blend of musty acids that keep me raising the glass to my nose between sips just to enjoy the smell again. This is a very expensive beer, but if any beer can live up to this kind of price tag, this one does."
"750mL bottle, corked and capped, 2006 vintage (with 2008 printed on the cork). The beer is light copper orange color with just a thin layer of foam, clear on the first few pours but becoming cloudier in the later ones. The aroma is unbelievable, horseblanket funk and mustiness, the nose has the promise of strong sour tartness. The taste comes through with all these flavors but isn't puckeringly sour. I can taste some light citrus flavors, maybe lemon or something similar. I don't get much from the oak barrels, maybe the wild yeast just dominate the beer too much for these nuances to come through. Overwhelmingly good, this is top shelf with no flaws that I can find. It might seem expensive ($24 in Columbus), but really it's a good value if you compare it with wild ales from Russian River or Lost Abbey."
"High marks on drinkability - pulls you back for more. So many cool things going on - makes it both interesting and enjoyable."
"Overall, I had very high hopes but I was pretty disappointed. Its good, not elite, you can probably find something more comparable for half the price."
"The funk in the flavor is a bit more restrained. It's lemon with earthiness, low lactic sourness, and a moderate tannic quality. Brett provides mustiness and subtle barnyard notes. The finish is tart lemon peel with a drying tannic quality and a low level of acetic character. Overall, the flavor is soft and well rounded. Sheer quality from Cantillon."
"Overall this is yet another winner from Cantillon and Lou Pepe. A refreshing and tasty queuze that totally defines the style. I am excited to see how my other bottles do in a decade or so. A fine beer."
"D: I think with this beer I finally understood and appreciated Cantillon."
"D - I could have drank the entire bottle myself and was sad when it was over."
"Drinkability: I must say, this is my least favorite of the Lou Pepe series."
"A great sour that isn't all about the sour."
"D: Very good. A complex and very funky gueuze. Not very acidic considering the brewery behind it. It's actually almost too easy to drink - it seems like it looses character after a while, as if the acidity mellows out."
"what a great beer and with this much age on it, it is just divine"
"D - Better than the regular Cantillon gueuze. Can't pinpoint why exactly, maybe it's a little better balanced and smoother."
"Glad I finally tried this one. Great Geuze. There's a lot more going on than just sour and funk which I like. Expensive, but definitely worth the price every now and again."
"Overall, another classic Cantillon. Very fortunate to have a steady supply of these beers, especially considering I don't have access to RR and LA."
"Probably the most drinkable gueuze I've ever had, since it is so smooth and light. Personally, I prefer a tart bomb, but I'm impressed with the delicacy that they achieved with this one."
"Bottle: Poured a dark golden orange color lambic with a quite large bubbly head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of sour notes with some distinctive oak and not much acidity which kind of surprised me. Taste was very refreshing with some sour notes and some oak; I was expecting more acidity and some barnyard notes but those were almost completely absent. Well done but considering the price difference I would stick with the regular gueuze."
"Really, an exceptional gueuze. Complex and fantastically flavorful, but at the same time very drinkable and not overwhelming or harsh in any way - really, what ever beer should try to be."
"Wow, as I am progressing through this bottle I am really starting to like this beer a lot. Stands out from any other gueuze I've tried. Will definitely seek this out again, despite its cost."
"I'm really enjoying this, and the sourness is well balanced."
"UPDATE 6/14/10: Had a bottle from 2005. The tartness was a little more smooth, but it was no less divine to drink."
"Very nice gueze from Cantillon. Pours a light cedar with a silky tan head. The nose has tart fruits, musty funk, oak, manure, wet soil and white wine making grapes. Taste has sour citrus up front followed by the musky funk and a sweet candy malt presence. Oak and wine grapes again finish it off. Crisp body with delicate carbonation and a dry acidic finish. Great stuff from Cantillon."
"The nose is beautiful, bright lemony sourness, with low tannins, low earthy funk, a more delicate and restrained gueuze. The sourness is interesting in that it has only a lemony character without the grapefruit presence. The palate is similar - all-round, there's a great lemony sourness, nice brightness, nice grassy and hay character. Nice lemon rind character. Great finish, this is a refreshing gueuze. Mellow stuff. 4.5/4.5/4.5/5/5"
"This is a standout beer."
"Fucking fantastic"
"This was shared with ATLbeerDog and Pullen. Thanks, Dan, for sharing this one with us."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Lemony and tart, but surprisingly soft on the acidity. Flavors of green apple skin, cider vinegar, dry white wine and even a touch of tannic red wine (presumably from the barrel). Complex and well balanced, a definite sipper but very easy to drink. Gentle carbonation, enough to give it a bubbly mouthfeel but not much more. Delicious stuff, one of the best around."
"d: I was hesitant to buy 750ml of a beer that I was sure would give me acid reflux. I love 'em but they are painful. This was far from mild, but it was tame enough that I could have easily tackled the whole bottle myself. I am glad that I shared this one though. Definitely recommended as a gateway into sour beer."
"Flavor is similar to the aroma, with a bit more sourness coming through. It's definitely not heavy on the vinegar, which I liked, and the dryness is manageable. Citrus notes of orange peel and oak linger on the finish. Body is crisp, surprisingly refreshing, and light. Overall, a fantastic brew, but I'm glad my friend footed the hefty price tag for this one ($25.99!)."
"D- I find this fairly drinkable overall, and quite drinkable for the style. I'm still trying to get used to the style to some extent as I don't have many opportunities to try sours. But I can certainly recognize that this a great beer in this style."
"Overall while not my favorite sour I have ever had, it is up there. This is about as solid as they come, and priced right along with the upper echelon of beers. I would have no issue trying this again, and to be honest would be curious to see how it holds up in the even earlier vintages."
"This was a birthday present, so i'll be savoring the 750 all to myself ;D"
"If you're accustomed to sour offerings, it's easy to drink. Otherwise, you may want to stick to that bottle of Champagne in the back of your refrigerator instead."
"Great session brew if I could get this all the time. Great!"
"This 2000 vintage beer came in a corked bottle with a crown cap covering it, and it was a good thing too, as the cork appeared to have dried up and shrunk in upright storage. The cap had done its job, and the beer was effervescent, clear, and Champagne like. The smell was very mature and ripe, and the aging seemed to have taken a lot of the funky edges off. The smell reminded me of fresh squeezed lemon juice or a cider made from green apples. Taste was very dry and sour with no hint of any sweetness that might have ever been present. A little bit of hay and cheddar were apparent in the taste as well. Despite all this acidity and complexity, it was smooth and refreshing, and not harsh at all. Airy and slippery with a high level of puckering feel. Easy to drink except for the steep price of admission."
"I can take a geuze, some are sweeter, some more mellow. I was expecting the mellow with complexity, based on what I heard, based on the rating. What I got, and important this was a 2000 Vintage, was an absolutely sour geuze, with some edge taken off. Its lemony with some ginger. From fruit peaks out, but its sour and while I finished 2/3 of a litre, I could not tolerate the entire bomber. Perhaps I did not get off to a great start with mold on top of the cap, and into the initial aroma."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart, effervescent, and lightly sour on the finish."
"M&D: by CantillonÂ’s standard, this one is not sour or harsh at all; this is an ultra-smooth, fragrant, and mature gauze to savour. But I wonder how it has gained so much oaky influence even after so many years of aging in the bottle? ItÂ’s my cup of tea anyway! Fellow BA Greencard once mentioned that this is his all-time favourite geuze; now I can understand why~~"
"This is a review of the 2000 Lou Pepe Gueze, which I had a few days ago. This bottle looked fine from the outside, but under the foil was the scariest cap I have ever seen- completely rusted through. It showered by counter with black and rust-red metallic dust and debris when I popped the cap and just crumbled completeely. The cork underneath was a grayish black. I feared the worst but decided to clean the top and carefully pull the cork. Luckily, it was only the top of the cork that was discolored, the remaining 4/5ths of the cork was perfectly fine and sealed the beer very well. There was a popping sound when I uncorked the beer and some not excessive foam. The beer was fine! It poured a nice somewhat cloudy dark golden into a chalice, with a surprisingly good head for its age that settled to a ring and stuck around for the duration of the beer. Just okay lacing. The smell was a little faint by now, but exhibited typical barnyard aromas, a whiff of lemon, and a hint of brie cheese. There was also an underlying acidic apple smell, sorta like a scrumpy. Not acetic, but mild and pleasant. The flavors were just wonderful. Perfectly balanced tartness (not acetic), barnyard flavors, perfectly ripe cheese, a touch of wood. Everything was seamlessly integrated and oh so smooth and subtle. This beer has been considerably mellowed by aging, not in your face at all. Extremely enjoyable. The mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, and refreshing. I could drink this all day. Wonderful to see that its still holding up."
"The cork is dated 2004, so I'm guessing they aged this at the brewery? Clear, pale peach. Respectable collar of tight, white foamage. Incredibly fine bubbled. Actually laces on the glass pretty well, which I find unusual for a lambic. Nice and funky aroma. Pungent crabapple, stilton and aged swiss cheese, and bottom-of-the-haybale funkiness. Very acidic, with a citrus tint. The flavor opens with softened, silky carbonation. Really, really nice. The beer just glides along on microscopic bubbles. Almost immediately tart, with little to no sweetness. Mostly a cheesy kind of funk, with heaps of lemon juice and wild crabapple. Definite bleu cheese going on here. Moldy and dank. Just about everything including the kitchen sink going on in here. Almost gamey at times, then a bit of sweetness can be detected. Lots going on here. So dry it could be called arid, stripping my palate of any and all moisture. Very sharp, though in a more refined way than the regular Cantillon Gueuze. Nicely aged, with a very elegant, urbane feel. If you believe any wine can compete with this kind of complexity, I've got a bridge I'll sell to you for a real bargain!"
"As an acolyte in this style my impressions are based upon nothing other than what I've read, expectations based upon nothing and impressions of flavors. With all that I'm enjoying this drink. It's not overwhelming me in any manner, but it does leave me wanting for a taste of something to nibble on to contrast (or maybe complement) the flavors as they are striking enough to warrant a distraction. Nicely drinkable, as I had little difficulty finishing off the bottle."
"Notes: Disclaimer, I'm a HUGE gueze fan. This is up there with the finest I've had. Blending in older lambics is the greatest invention ever. You might say what about internet? Mass production? the wheel? Nope, its blending lambics. Yummmm"
"Overall: Very nice, I haven't had a bad Cantillon beer."
"Very clean mouthfeel, not filmy. Very refreshing. Light-bodied, but not watery. Very drinkable. Easy to drink and the ""simple"" tastes involved are actually to it's advantage."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The beer has ample carbonation. This is the least harsh of any Cantillon product I have drank. This beer is oddly refreshing and made me wish for more."
"Not my favorite geuze. ItÂ’s not big enough, ballsy enough, nor sour enough. Still, I feel lucky to have tried it."
"The sticker on the bottle says 2002. The cork is too mangled to really tell what that last number is. Hmmm. The first thing I notice about this beer as opposed to Cantillon's flagship gueuze is less carbonation. Pours a bright, vibrant orange, with no head to speak off, but little gatherings of bubbles. Smells rather typical for Cantillon. All the usual suspects are there. Big and funky, lots of Brett out front here. Citrusy, zesty, dusty. Taste is more subdued than much of the Cantillon line, which I like. Definitely tart and sour, plenty of granny smith apple and lemon rind, but it's mellowed a bit here. I'd really like try one that's even older and more curmudgeony. You can't really taste much sweetness, but I can pick up on the difference between this beer and their normal Gueuze which has a younger lambic in the blend. This one is much softer, in a word. There's something to be said for the younger and wilder punch that the regular gueze has, but this one allows for more complex tastes to shine through. Lots of must, dust, and mold, almost as if you could smell the cellar and the barrell(s) this beer was aged in. It does sweeten and round out a bit as it warms. More funk as well. The softness on the palate combined with the acidic bite really makes this beer come together. Takes a little while to drink this one, but that doesn't exactly translate into a ""low drinkability"" for me. It's something that should be appreciated at whatever pace suits it best. An impressive beer for sure, from the experts of lambic."
" Tastes more sour than it smells, doesn't seem as acidic as some other Gueuzes I've had. Sweet and sour, sour apples, and plenty dirty as well. Mouthfeel is fantastic, lively and coating. I will have no problem finishing this 750, I'm going to pair it with rare, pan-seared, oven finished filet mignon in about forty-five minutes, I'll update my review. I've had success in the past with Cantillon and filet."
"Other comments: Wow! This is a truly amazing geuze! I bought this bottle some time in 2003 (I think) from Cantillon when I was living in Brussels. It has been stashed in my ""cellar"" since then. Now that I'm in England (and getting seriously bored with English ales), I decided to dig this one up again. I'm both glad and disappointed that I did. Glad because this is just a fantastic beer; disappointed because it is the only bottle I had. Oh well! That's the problem with beer, I guess, you end up drinking it. Anyway, Cantillon can sometimes be overpowering, especially to the unitiated, but this is very accessible. Would be a great ""starter geuze", if you are OK with sharing it with someone who might not appreciate it!"
"Taste: Sour and crisp, huge astringency, probably moreso than other offerings from this brewery. However the gains in asperity and aftertaste are at the expense of complexity of flavor. Still an excellent Gueuze that I'd be curious to try again in a few years."
"Shared with a friend. Bottle. Golden and clear in color with a nice thick white head. Slightly sweet aroma. Well balanced and not overpowering. Not to tart. Really nice. Sweet and sour flavor. Nice and refreshing flavor. Smooth palate. Wow. Really nice."
"2001 vintage. Thanks to sheepnutz for bringing this to our tasting. Poured an orange/red color with almost no head and didn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is way funky. Very sour and fruity. The flavor is much the same. Very tart and lemony, but sweet at the same time. Finishes up very dry. Lots of fruity flavors. Well done."
"750mL bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with one finger of head. No lacing on the glass. The smell is fairly tart, with just a hint of that classic Cantillon funk. The taste is tart and sweet, and there's just a little bit of funkiness going on. I really was expecting more of that great funkadelic flavor, like George Clinton jumping out of the bottle at me. Maybe it needed more aging. The mouthfeel was very nice and thick, but had great carbonation. The drinkability was very good. A nice lambic from the team at Cantillon."
"2001 vintage. Thanks to SheepNutz for sharing this gem with us. The beer poured an orange color with a slight ring over top. The nose was awesome. Full of lemoney acidic tones with the tartness and sour grapey notes as well. I had the Cuvee Renee recently, and this Cantillon was much more balanced and subdued. The flavor was much the same. All the sour, acid and tart I want from a gueuze, but without the overpowering pucker. The flavors lingered long as well, but not in a bad way. The feel was moderate with just a slight carbontion. The finish was very dry, sucking the moisture from my mouth. Very easy drinking and smooth. Even though the finish was dry, it was very refreshing. Another fine offering from Cantillon."
"Very good, but still falls way short of Cantillon's 1900 Broucsella, in terms of full lambic flavor."
"Pours to a hazy golden-orange color with a thick white head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is musty and tart, with barnyard-like qualities. The flavor is tart and somewhat fruity with a musty flavor throughout. The finish is souring and tart. This is a tasty gueze, one of the better ones I have had."
"Excellent."
"Superb!! Another winner from the Masters at Cantillon."
"At the first sip, it's noticeably different from other such products. Infinitely cleaner. The natural, yeast-driven fruit flavors are truly obvious -- lemon, apple skin, and a nutty dryness all contribute to a complex beer that's immensely enjoyable before I even get to the best part -- the puckering tartness characteristic to the style. It's almost as though they were able to just mute the sourness enough to let other flavors shine through more vibrantly and then capture that perfect moment. Excellent."
"The fizz is hardly noticable, but sufficient to provide shape and force to the very long flavors. Wow!"
"The label on the bottle says 2000 vintage but the cork says bottled in 2.002, 750 ml bottle This lambic pours like Champagne with a big, soft, soapy head that doesn't last that long. Beautiful gold color, not heavily carbonated. Aroma has lemons with a kind of sugary sweetness. The aroma is very, very nice. A very clean tasting lambic, dry, a little chalky on the back of the throat, not as much sour as one expects but very drinkable I think I got a good deal, $15 at New Beer in NYC. Seen this beer from $25-$30 elsewhere."
"I found this to be very mellow, not like I was expecting. Since it was older, I was expecting it to be much more harsh, dry and sour than the other gueuzes that are blended with young lambic. Just the opposite really. Don't get me wrong: this was dry as hell, but its sourness was subdued quite a bit and it wasn't harsh at all. It was very pleasant to drink, having mainly apple and lemon in the backround and notes of candy and mixed berry yogurt."
"Pours nice and hazy of an amber with slight hints of blond coming through under a slight white head. As with all of Cantillon brews, sour comes on quite strong. But this is not a bad thing. Three years have formed this beer into a well balanced crafted nectar. Full on tongue assult. Cantillon is da bomb my friends."
"1999 Vintage - A slightly different take on the gueuze. Instead of being the blend of an old and a young lambic, it is the blend of two older lambics. Because of that, I think this is a little bit more mellow than the normal traditional gueuze. It pours a clear gold with a slight orange tinit and a spitzy head that dissipates fast. The aroma is musty with some horse blanket, a sourness, and floral and honey notes. It is sour almost mouth puckering, with an almost vinegar like acidity and slight taste of apples , yeast, and some barnyard and dirt. The body is nice and light with a very dry finish."
"Fairly low carbonation for a Gueuze, though strictly speaking this is not one, as it only has three year old Lambic in it. This is quite lemony and not as funky as some Lambic derivations. The brettanomyces character is pretty subdued, but there are definite musty-leathery notes here. A bit of vinegar adds to the acidity. The beer finishes with a slight tannic astringency, which seems fairly typical. My only complaint is that perhaps this bottle could have used a bit more complexity. The good/ variable thing about Lambic is that the next bottle is likely to be quite a bit different, so perhaps my complexity is hidden in the next bottle."
"Cantillon - Lou Pepe Gueuze ""1999 Vintage Real Gueuze"". 2 three year old blends of lambic are blended together yet again to make this semi-rare offering from Cantillon. 750ml green glass bottle, purchased from Steelgarden for about $15+US. This gueuze is a dark golden colour with a lovely effervecence and quite a head of white foam. The aromas are of dead skunk, funky drunk, horny monk, scared skunk, a hostel bunk, and some junk in my trunk. The taste follows through with a blast of traditional gueuze lambic tartness and all the traditional farmyard flavors. Their is a dry fruitiness that makes this gueuze very fruity, without having any fruit in it. The mouthfeel is quite acidic, tart and sharp, just as a good gueuze should be. The only flaw this lambic has, IMO, is its softness. Compared to an unaged or aged sample of Cantillons 100% gueuze lambic, this lou pepe gueuze just isn't as sharp, tart, or enamel stripping as Cantillons flagship is. Still, this is a a classic gueuze with a wonderful drinkability!"
