As someone with very little experience in the field of lambics, all I can really offer here is a subjective opinion: I find St. Louis Gueuze Fond Tradition to be pretty good value for the price, but it still doesn't strike me as the best that this style has to offer. Recommended as an accessible, affordable introduction to the world of sours; I'll grab another bottle and hold onto it for a few years to see if there are any new developments, but for now I'll just call this a pretty good lambic and leave it at that.","thehyperduck","Jan 31, 2015"

Sour apple, white grape, lemon and oak seem to be the most obvious but a little wheat and a little bit of bread. The taste is a wonderful sour and sweetness.  Tart big lemon and sour apple. White wine and a burst of sweetness. Very dry finish. Perfect amount of dryness for the style. The mouthfeel was light, crisp and had champagne carbonation that give an added bite. Overall a very nice lambic with good sour notes and a dry finish. Good price for the style too.","MTLDOG","Beers"

Medium bodied, sugary beneath the sour and mild funk, then finishing dry with oak and grape skin. Bottled 1/2014. Really nice, balanced approach and flavorful.","babaracas","Dec 22, 2014"

3.9,-0.5,4,4,4,4,3.5,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/18/2012. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of sour green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, grass, oak, leather, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, light pepper, and yeast/oaky earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, grass, leather, oak, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, light pepper, and yeast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of green apple, lemon, white grape, wet hay, straw, leather, oak, musty funk, white vinegar, wheat, and oak/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt flavors; with a great malt/acidity balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, dry, and fairly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very nice gueuze style. All around good complexity and balance of fruity/funky/lactic yeast, oak, and light malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink with the balanced acidity. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 31, 2014"

3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours like liquid copper with a nice white head that sits as a half finger’s width above the glass. The beer’s body is murky like swamp water with a great torrent of carbonation constantly flowing to replenish the head. It’s not the most beautiful thing to look at in the glass, but it isn’t the ugliest either. The beer’s lacing is light and splotchy on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells properly funky with a big sweet cherry fruit leather and a touch of musty barnyard. The wheat malts are light here, but surprisingly I can pick up a bit of a cereal breadiness in the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes properly acidic with big interplay of sweet funk and sweet cereal malt on the back. The beer begins with acidic sweet water which opens quickly into cherry fruit leather with touches of barnyard before rushing into a finish of thick wheat cereal malts that start syrupy, blending with the cherry flavors before turning dry and powdery. The aftertaste is long, ringing lightly with funk and acid. On the mouth the beer feels medium light in body, and leaves the tongue tingling and a little dry. The beer’s carbonation is high, prickling the tongue nicely, though not as strongly as some gueuze. Overall, this is a tasty beer with some nice complexity, but a bit short of a full gueuze flavor for me. It’s delicious and quite easy to drink, but really mellow on the back of the palate, and the taste of wheat in such strength is surprising for the style. I like this beer, I just don’t think it is quite a gueuze. This beer is worth a try.","Maxwell","Mar 01, 2013"

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus rine, funk, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus rine, funk, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. I have had this so many times out of the bottle it is seriously not even funny. So when I saw this on-tap I had no choice but try this one. With it being on tap it actually enhanced the citrus aspect of this one for me. I was really happy that this was the case rather than just drinking the same beer over and over. Drink this one rather it is in a bottle or on-tap. You won’t regret it.","thagr81us","Jun 26, 2012"

Flavor is refreshing tart and has lemon peel upfront with acidic notes of mild vinegarette. Or a tart plain yogurt, extremely tasty with fruit undertones, this is real lambic and more assertive than the overtly sugar filled Lindeman's.

There is a moderate amount of hay and barnyard to pair with an acidic and somewhat citrusy sour finish. The flavors don't disappoint. It's light and easy to drink.

A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish.

Francine Manzana gave that caramel apple pop company the best years of her life and she was terminated “for cause” for reading a Patricia Cornwell novel when she wasn’t clocked out. Francine wasn’t going to take this lying down. She knew the secret behind the tartness in those pops, and she had full intention on taking this issue public. With her box of belongings from her desk she strode over to the quality control center only to find that Loretta was out. “I will make them feel the tart bitterness of abandonment, just like they showed me.” With a few calibrations she reset the dials and the mixture began running an entirely new batch of Caramel Apple pops through the line. She stared at her spiteful reflection in the bubbling pool of acidic green glucose. The wafts of the additional citric acid stung her eyes and nostrils. Francine smiled and tossed her mystery novel into the simmering goo, for she had an unemployment officer to speak to.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jul 14, 2011"

Though it has the acidity, the rest of the beer subtly plays with your senses rather than picking them and smacking them around. If you are not sure if you would like a lambic beer, I would give this one a shot to see if you are compatible. If you feel yourself (like I do) wishing that your palate took a bit more punishment, I would go for the Cantillon. If you think that this is a bit much, you may want to stick to the Lindemans. Either way, this is a respectable beer and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","SkeeterHawk","Jan 29, 2010"

This beer pours a traditional burnt orange with a two inch off white creamy head that leaves little to no lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is traditional gueuze. There is a nice lactic twang in the nose with tannic oak, green apple skins and good old fashion funk. Coming from the brewery that produces all the crap that St. Louis does, I expect much more sweetness out of the nose. While there is a hint of malt sweetness, I'm very surprised. The flavor is much the same with a traditional lactic quality that lends itself to grapefruit pith, grape skins, green apples, and lemon zest. There is just a hint of residual sweetness that follows and it really isn't as flavorful as I thought it was going to be. The mouthfeel is not as dry as I would have liked. The small amount of residual sugars makes it just a bit too sweet. I like my gueuze's bone dry. Over all, I'm really surprised with the quality of this beer. I really bought it because I thought it was going to be a horrible example of the style by a brewery that is known for bastardizing Belgian styles but they did a pretty good job.","hwwty4","Jan 17, 2010"
