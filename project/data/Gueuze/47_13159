4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, the more I try this style, the more I start to understand what sets this style apart and as far as I can tell this has just about everything that a good Geuze should have and I enjoyed it.  This beer has good drinkability, it's smooth, not too acidic, very crisp, a little prickly, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, the whole bottle might be a little too much for me so I think one glass is the perfect amount.  What I like the most about this beer is the sourness, it's right where I want it for the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the slight skunky aspect, I wish they wouldn't use green bottles.  I would buy this beer again and I would be nice to keep a bottle or two around in the cellar, I think it would be a nice summer beer and it might even be a little refreshing.  I would recommend this beer, especially if your into the style or sour beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it took me a few yeasrs and a couple tries to warm up to it, but now i can say I enjoy it and I like to seek out more in the style.  This beer made for a good first impression and I would really like to try more beers from this brewery, as far as I can tell it's an above average example of the style.  Good job guys, this is a tasty Geuze. keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Mar 07, 2015"

4.25,7.9,,,,,,"Poured a lovely cloudy golden body with a thin ring of white head. The body looks fantastic, though it could do with more head. Scents of wild, barnyard Brett funk, with notes of hay and lemon juice layered atop aromas of grapefruit peel and indeterminate citrus fruit. mild oak, apple, honey. Overall impression is of a modestly sour Geuze aroma mingling wonderfully with the other aromas common to the style. Quite nice and very true to form. Taste begins modestly sour with notes of sour yeasty funk, lemon, grapefruit. tangy wheat, a light character of oak and a low level of hop bitterness. This moves into a moderately sour middle with notes of lemon, apple, green apple, light honey and a light presence of oak. Finish is medium-dry with notes of honey, lemon, grapefruit, a hint of pale malt and yeasty wild funk. Aftertaste is moderately sour with notes of yeasty wild funk, spicy yeast phenols, mild grainy malt and a bit of grapefruit. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely sour, well-balanced Geuze that is a good showcase of the typical flavors of the style. Quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied, puckering and somewhat drying with high, effervescent carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, spritzy, but not watery feel. Very true to style and quite pleasant. Overall this is a fine Geuze. It is not the best example of the style, but it is true to form, pleasant in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel and as a result is quite pleasant to drink. I recommend it to those wanting to try a fairly good example of a Geuze.","Auraan","Sep 28, 2014"

4.5,14.2,,,,,,"one of the better traditional Belgian examples of the style I think, and one of the primary reasons for that is its balance. not just a lactic acidity sour bomb, this has a ton of flavor and nuance to go with the sour. the malt also seems to be a bit darker than others, less yellow more amber, which gives some meat to it. alcohol is also a bit higher than others, an indication of its dryness and ""doneness"" in the yeast sense. hazy with fish food flakes of brick red yeast floating around and finally settling under an airy white head. the nose smells as woody as it does sour, very mature, with plenty of funky yeast weirdness in addition to the lacto of the lambic. the blend is nice too, a proper mix of old and young with just enough sourness to fit the style but not so much that I don't want to drink my whole bottle. I love the fuller body and all the carbonation. a lot of these come across still, this appears to be bottle conditioned which gives it a lot of life. less traditional to some, but I really do prefer it personally. oak and dusty malt meet where the sourness really kicks in, and it warms up well, driving the sourness up a bit more. on par with any of the blended lambics from Belgium I think, and the price point is awesome.","StonedTrippin","Aug 17, 2014"

The aroma is a lively combination of apple cider, vinegar, and damp earth. The flavor is likewise acidic yet earthy, with components of tart white grape juice, sour green apples, and a light woodiness. The lively, sharp, fine carbonation accents the acidicy, and yet this beer is surprisingly palate-coating. Overall, this beer reminds me more of a tart white wine, but in a most intriguing way.","devilben02","Aug 12, 2014"

It pours cloudy gold with a soapy white head that shows no sign of letting up before I'm ready to go further. It smells of oranges, peppermint, hay, and a barn. A particular one, not just any one. But I will keep the location secret. Just to be that way. The taste is sour cherries, grass, and a nice bready finish. This is a phenomenally balanced flavor. Not too sour, not too sweet, not too dry. It is the goldilocks of geuze. If they start putting that on the label, I get credit. The mouthfeel is soft, slightly tingly, and light. Overall, I really feel this is a fantastic beer. It may be the best I've had. Nice, nice job.","roblowther","Jul 31, 2014"

Nose is nice. Not mind-blowing but not repulsive. I'm warming up quickly to the style. Grapefruit is the dominant player here, with assorted citrus in the mix. Lemons, apples, barnyard funk. Supremely sour on both the nose and the palate, though not as acidic as other brews in this vein. Actually somewhat sweet at the tip of the tongue, with bread and apple candy. The sourness doesn't quite have the flavor or the potency I crave, but it's a nicely rounded beer.","xabyss","Dec 31, 2013"

The taste of the wood with the sour yeast brings a sort of tannic element to the light dry body with an alcohol flavor that is noticeable and becomes almost spicy but not sharp to the extent of not being enjoyable. Enjoyment and flavor converge this is stronger than your average Gueuze but to me does not lack flavor in any sense it is perhaps not as subtle as some but every bit as good and worth seeking out..perhaps a good candidate for cellaring based on the slightly higher abv -either way it is drinkable and very flavorful.","Slatetank","May 15, 2013"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a murky yellow with a huge fluffy white head with varying size bubbles. Lacing was far too slick to really be of note. The beer’s body is cloudy and opaque, and I did find some chunks in the end of the beer (obviously…). On the nose the beer smells spritsy and fierce with lemon grass funk and cherry fruit leather playing with each other in complex layers. As it warms there is more barnyard in the smell with “horse blanket” notes alongside grassier whiffs. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky and fresh, with earthy cheese notes playing beside lemon grass citrus and some lovely barnyard funk which builds further in the mouth as the beer warms. The beer opens with sour lemon, moving into the hugely complex middle with barnyard, light fruit leather cherry, and big lemon grass citrus notes. The barnyard closes with lovely earthy cheese notes, while the aftertaste of sour lemon grass lingers in the mouth for quite a while. This beer tastes properly complex for a gueuze. On the mouth, the beer feels light and spritsy, with a little effervescence coming from the fierce carbonation. The mouth is left rather clean, with the faintest touch of dryness on the back of the tongue. Overall, this is another great gueuze. It takes time for it to warm into big complex flavors, but it brings some lovely citrus notes, and great sprits to the beer. It’s not my favorite in the style, but it is far from my least favorite. I’ll be aging a bottle for a year or so to see how the funk develops in the bottle, as I feel it could grow a little in complexity. This is a great complex beer for a good price point. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Dec 31, 2012"

4.12,4.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Once I managed to get some beer into my glass it appeared a hazy, golden straw yellow with a dense foamy white head. The quarter inch of fluffy head sits comfortably throughout drinking and leaves some streaky lacing behind (as expected). However, the nose is sweeter than expected and reminiscent of white grapes and fruity yeast esters. The nose is also tart and slightly reminiscent of stomach acid. In comparison to a cantillon, this geuze is on the mild side. It drinks very easily with a bit of dank culture that resides on my palate long after each sip. It's semi-dry, vinous and the alcohol is quite well masked. Not much to complain about with this beer, except it needs more funk and sourness.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 27, 2012"

I think higher carbonation would open up the palate a bit more and complement the flavor nicely. Moreover, the sourness seems a bit one-dimensional (fruit). I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but I would like to try a gueuze with a bit more complexity.","deadonhisfeet","Sep 25, 2012"

Pours a light, golden-orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops and quickly disperses within seconds on the pour. Head eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch cap. Some lacing is present, but there's no adhesion. Nose reveals citrus zest, vinegar notes, cork and tart light stone fruit. Taste follows nose; however, considerably less tart and sour than suggested by the nose. There's also a slight cardboard taste in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, palate cleansing carbonation as well as a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a decent and accessible gueuze, but nothing overly spectacular. I'd go with Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René or Hanssens Oude Gueuze over this one.","Jwale73","Jul 14, 2012"

It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. All of the right flavors and aromas for this style were present in this one. This made it a really nice example of the style and definitely kept me on my toes while exploring this one.

The nose and the taste do not compliment each other at all. This being my first sour I was shocked that anyone could appreciate this style. Clearly this is not for me. There was a funky almost putrid aftertaste that was only masked by the beers sour tartness at the beginning of each sip. I experienced a wet mop drenched in blended swamp moss that left me breathless. I will not be diving into this style ever again as I clearly dont have the palate to enjoy such flavor.

Taste follows the scent with more pronounced notes of cracker, and grass on the tongue, the musty oak and barnyard is maybe a touch aggressive and dulls the minimally bright notes of lemon and champagne.

Bottle features a green label with a red sash and reads ""Oude Boon Geuze L'Ancienne."" Pours into a Boon Geuze glass (think basic bar tumbler) a pretty golden orange with a thick and lasting white head. Bottle indicates that this is an 05-06 bottling. We consumed it in August of 2008. Aroma forecasts a very sour beer with loads of lemon-lime citric character and some red fruit along the lines of cranberry sauce or perhaps gooseberry jam. Body is quite sour and slightly bready with a citric hoppy finish. Taste is heavy on the lemon and the horsehair funk. Yum. Corky woodiness, tannic acid, and green grass follow.

3.47,-11.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,2.5,"Overall a very unique and interesting beer. I liked it but kept looking for just a touch of malt to balance out the intense tartness. Not crazy about the unfiltered yeasty wheaty qualities either, but as mentioned this was my first geuze, so maybe I'm just not used to the style.","rhenning","May 11, 2009"
3.9,-1,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall, definitely what I would consider representative of the style, but perhaps a bit more rough on the palate than say something from Cantillon. Definitely worth a look for fans of the style.","Nickls","Apr 29, 2009"
4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: Overall, a solid effort and a solid gueuze. Really holds well to the style, just somehow falls short in a couple aspects.","SaucyA","Apr 25, 2009"
3.98,1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D,this is my first experience with geuze boon although i`ve had this one more then once .this is great i like grape fruit and champagne .. champagne beer!! this it an awesome direction for beer ..","goblet","Mar 13, 2009"
4.05,2.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall a nice geuze, but I believe it needed a bit more bite in the flavor department to rank it among the best in it's style.","JBogan","Mar 03, 2009"

3.4,-13.7,4,4,3,3,3.5,"375ml bottle with a best by date of 02/2028. Nice golden color with an initially thick white head. It smells dusty, funk, must, and a bit of citrus candy. The taste is like a bit of sour lemon juice but the mouthfeel seems a little watery much like the other Boon Gueuze. Decent gueuze but I'd prefer a Cantillon for the same price.","ArrogantB","Oct 05, 2008"
4.13,4.8,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Very delicious - quite sour, but with a depth of complexity. I do like a good gueuze, and this is a good gueuze.","lacqueredmouse","Sep 29, 2008"
3.55,-9.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"The drinkability is somewhat hurt by the aggressive bitterness in the aftertaste, but there's lots to like in this beer. I would definitely enjoy 1 or 2 glasses of this with some blue cheese and biscuits.","hegelec","Aug 11, 2008"
4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Overall, this was a very good beer for the style. Very drinkable. Went nicely with some cheese. Impressive Geuze.","atigerlife","Jul 26, 2008"
3.67,-6.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"D - A very interesting beer. Not something to drink everyday but well worth a try.","brendan13","Jul 22, 2008"
3.75,-4.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"T/M/D - smooth and dry, low on carbonation (for gueuze). A bit less bold than others of its brethren, but more approachable as well.","Jerico","Apr 25, 2008"
3.58,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I will definitely still stock a couple of these in the basement, but next time I will likely pass on the tap on this one (at least when theres such other amazing choices on tap).","ShareANevada","Apr 24, 2008"
4.25,7.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly colored golden brown with a big head that recedes somewhat quickly. Smell is extremely sour with a strong yeast presence. Flavor is not as sour as I would have expected considering this is the first geuze I have ever had and that the nose was so sour toned. This is actually extremely drinkable and I like it quite a bit. It is thinner on the mouth and not very heavy at all.","RblWthACoz","Dec 29, 2007"
3.97,0.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Taste courtesy of piscator34. Light straw colour. Nose is of light funk and citrus. Taste- quite tart with lemon, green apple and some horse blanket. Mouthfeel- High carbonation as expected making for a spritzy dry treat. Very refreshing and tasty gueze","oakbluff","Dec 16, 2007"

4.1,4.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Five years aging hasn't hurt this one bit. Neither did not having time to finish the whole bottle and leaving a little in the fridge over night! I've never tried the Boon Oude Gueze fresh but I'd imagine this extra time has only helped. This was really good - guezy - stuff!","biegaman","Aug 27, 2007"
2.64,-33,4,2.5,2.5,4,2,"D- Awful. I won't have it again.","khiasmus","Jun 06, 2007"
3.52,-10.7,4,4.5,3,3,3.5,"D - Easy to drink relative to other examples of the style because of a strangely subdued flavor profile. The aroma is excellent but the taset did not live up to its promise and I would have prefered a stronger sour character.","nickfl","May 14, 2007"
3.95,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Something I'll buy again, but not my favorite gueuze.","warmstorage","Apr 11, 2007"
2.91,-26.1,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,"There is a lot of carbonation in this beer. The head started at 2 finger and grew to 3 as I write this first couple sentences. The head is quite thick adn an ivory color. The beer is a cloudy apricot. The smelly and taste are quite funky. This is the first Guauze I've had, so I don't have much of a baseline. I can taste and smell the ""horse hair/barnyard"" aspects from the wild yeast. It tastes a lot like some really bad, infected homebrew I once made. I really like belgian beer, but guauze might be streatching it a little.","beakerboy","Jan 22, 2007"
4.47,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A brilliant gueuze, even better than the standard boon offering","cypressbob","Nov 24, 2006"
3.73,-5.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"M&D: overall the mouthfeel is pretty standard, refreshing enough and very mild in carbonation, showing good efforts on bottle-conditioning. And yet the complexity of this bottle seems to be lacking, compared with numerous bottles tasted before... But nothing will stop me from trying this beer over and over again. It's like a good honest session bitter in the world of geuze for me~~","wl0307","Oct 31, 2006"
4.03,2.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D - Good stuff. Doesn't have the puckering sourness of other gueuzes, but is probably a nice introduction to the style. Very sippable.","haz77","Jun 24, 2006"
4.17,5.8,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - An excellent gueuze.... one of my favourites... Very refreshing and definitely worth a try...","mdagnew","Jun 12, 2006"
2.98,-24.4,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Rusted orange. Full foaming, wispy and creamy head. Aromatically vibrant, with horsey, fruit (lemon) and barnyard aromas. Typical lambic aromatics. Flavor is much more approachable, less acidic, less sour, sweeter and generally less flavorful than lambics from say 3F, Girardin, Cantillon, Hanssens. I havent been impressed by Frank Boon thusfar, to be honest.","Crosling","Mar 16, 2006"
3.9,-1,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"In the aftertaste: leather, tannin, sharp. And overall, a good and sharp tartness.","stcules","Jul 25, 2005"

4.57,16,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I'm surprised this beer hasn't been reviewed before. I think it's outstanding. But a warning.... it's a pretty uncompromising gueuze style, and it definately will NOT appeal to drinkers who have not already developed a taste for gueuze via a more approachable route. So if you don't already enjoy Belle Vue or Morte Subite, then come back when you do! Right now it's replaced Duvel as my favourite Belgian tipple. Here in Antwerpen the Berenbak only sells it in 750cc bottles, and that's the review sample here. (It also comes in smaller ones.) Anyway, the top comes off this big bottle and straight away you notice the foam building up, with evidence of solid yeast. Pop some into the beaker and you get a foamy drink which soon settles down to a nice pale colour. It's not perfectly clear by any means, but hell it's a live one, what do you expect? The aroma next.... hard to describe this. Vaguely citrus. Cooking apples. Then the flavour... this stuff is really quite sharp. Did I really pay money for this? I'd better pretend to like it... Once the initial shock has passed you realise you want more. And more. It's quite easy to drink a whole big bottle all by yourself, in fact yesterday afternoon I got through 2 of them. And being only around 7% it's not such a big deal. Highly reccommended.","downes51","Mar 16, 2005"
