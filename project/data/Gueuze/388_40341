Enjoyable for sure, unique and creative, but the cognac is really assertive and for my palate, too sweet and too rich for a gueuze or a lambic. A novel experiment that achieves minor success, but a bit lacking complexity and balance.","kevanb","Dec 13, 2014"

Some wood, but surprisingly little Cognac.  Taste is on par with nose.  Mouthfeel is light with a bright carbonation and a pleasant acidity, light tartness and semi-dry finish.  Solid beer, but not my favorite from this brewer.","Jwale73","Nov 28, 2014"

4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Review #1800!!! Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one during a fair sized Cantillon tasting! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon balloon. Poured fluorescent orange with a minimal white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, fruit, wood, spice, tart, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, BIG sour, acidic, sweet fruit, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really surprised when I heard that this one would be at our tasting that evening. A sour aged in cognac barrels is all it took for me to start drooling over this one before even opening it. After all the time this one has had to age I really wasn’t expecting much of the barrel flavors to be around, however it was still there with a nice sweet fruit aspect that you would get off a good cognac. Really impressive. When I say BIG sour, I really meant it. This one had a whole new level of sour when compared to the other Cantillon brews tasted that night as it almost knocked you off your feet. Really glad I got the chance to try this one and would love to do so again in the future if the opportunity presents itself. I suggest you do the same.","thagr81us","Sep 04, 2012"
4.05,-6.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours murky and still for a lambic --- murky probably because the pour was from the later end of the bottle. Still because... I am not sure. Regardless, the carbonation was just fine on the palate. Smells funky, very hay like. My buddy commented that this beer alone is enough to justify the 'barnyard' adjective, or something along those lines. The acidity is moderate in taste. There's lemon and then some nuttiness which is odd... I guess; but I liked that aspect. While different from other Gueuze and quite tasty, having had many 'loons in small quantities, I can safely say that as far as my tastes go, 3F is where it's at!","tewaris","Aug 30, 2012"

The aroma is funky with the cognac presence obvious and a bit of oak. There is also a light mushroom note. A bit of alcohol is there as well. It's not a lot, but more than any other lambic I've had. The initial taste has a light sweetness with a decent tartness. There is some funky oak, a bit of brandy, and some mushroom. The finish has some brandy and a bit of alcohol. Medium body. Low carbonation. Not bad, but certainly not my favorite Cantillon beer. It could have used a little more carbonation.","jethrodium","Aug 24, 2012"

The nose is full of funk, raw fruit, wood and sweet grapes. The taste is acidic and funky as expected with a bit of sulfur too. Mouth feel is light with a medium carbonation to high carbonation, a dry finish and a warming finish in the throat--probably from the acidity. The finish includes waves of light fruit with brilliant tartness, subtle brandy, and woody vanilla. I did pick up some subtle vinous notes in the smell and taste, but the cognac clearly takes a backseat to all other characteristics of the Gueuze. With that said, it was still incredibly enjoyable.","sarro","Aug 08, 2011"

4.92,13.6,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"2007 Vintage. The cork eases out, perfectly spongy & in tact with a muted pop.. immediately the aroma of funk starts to emanate. Poured into gueuze tumblers with a robust, seafoam-like head with lingering retention. Nose is musty & bretty, reminiscent of a horse stable on a cool summer night. The bacteria has a pronounced and complex flavor, followed by the subtle undertone of cognac. The lambic essence is so deep and rich, the effort is perfectly executed with a touch of warmth on the back end.The barnyard resonance transcends into faint booziness, which could almost be confused as lingering oak from the barrel. If you observe closely, theres really something more here. The small nuances are what really puts this in distant perspective with other Cantillon Gueuze of the same vintage...made from the same loom, but certainly a different fabric. Makes everything else in life fade into nothingness..Truly a world class offering!","gn0sis","Feb 07, 2010"

4.37,0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"2007 cork date consumed in early 2009. Pours a bright golden-copper with orange leaning hues and a thin white head that bubbles and then dies away. Aroma is of dried hay and pears, currants, apples, and lemons that have all been sitting in a big old pot of funk. Mustiness and horse blanket. Taste is more oaky than most Cantillon but still nothing comparable to many over oaked American attempts at this and similar styles. Tannic acid melds with the general fruitiness of the beer to create a chardonnay like vinous quality. Green apple and pears play a roll and at times there are touches of the tropics in here. Grape fruit finishes things off. The mouthfeel is quite sour but not over the top. Instead of a straight pow to the palate, this beer leaves a lasting but mellower sourness on the tongue. Aggressive carbonation keeps things fairly light.","DaPeculierDane","Nov 03, 2009"

The finest touch of this lambic rests on its integrity and a delicate input of cognac barrels, while keeping a smooth yet still reasonably complex profile of the lambic base.

4.3,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy golden with a nice initial head that fades to a ring. This beer is labeled 2007, so it is still a little young. It should integrate a little more and become a bit funkier as time goes on. As is, it is quite nice, but each component still stands apart instead of being well blended into a harmonious whole. Somewhat fubky and acetic up front and with a finish that is both a tiny bit sweet with vanilla from the oak and has a nice ring of cognac in the finish as well. It is a little unusual, especially the hint of sweetness after the laser-like sourness that Cantillon is known for, but it really seems to work. The aromas are a bit more subdued than the taste, but they both work, with the taste being particularly tart and somewhat funky with an earthy minerality in addition to the sour, oak, and cognac. Nice beer, I'll be interested to try this again in a few years.","Georgiabeer","0"
4.23,-2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a fogged gold with a thin creme head. Nose is funky. Kind of a citric acidity there. Flavor is interesting. Noticeable bite from wood aging and cognac. Almost seems to carry a bit of an apple tone to it. Crisp and slightly biting overall. The combination of lambic funk, wood aging, and cognac makes for an interesting combination. Feel is kind of sticky slick on the liquid and the carbonation is fairly low. Overall pretty nice to drink. A bit of a bite to it, but still good.","RblWthACoz","Apr 06, 2008"
4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I am really surprised how mellow the barrel character is here, the cognac must have stripped out a lot of those oak flavors. This is a very well balanced beer; the barrel plays a significant supporting role here, sourness of course takes the lead, but not excessively so (this is not as hard as some Cantillon's) and the funk is definitely a supporting character. I like that this was lightly carbonated, given that this is not a blended beer I was expecting a much flatter experience, but the soft carbonation definitely adds a nice touch to the texture. Quite the tasty beer, I certainly wouldn't mind having a lot more of this in my cellar.","Gueuzedude","Apr 06, 2008"
2.15,-50.3,2.5,2.5,2,2,2,"No head on a yellowish gold pour. Smell is musty, band-aid like, and hoppy. Didn't get anything I would have identified as cognac though. Taste is tart, funky and nicely hoppy. Very light carbonation with a thin body. Sour but not intensely so, and a milder, thinner flavor than expected. Interesting, but not particularly wowing for the style. Just ok...","JDV","Feb 10, 2008"
4.25,-1.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"The taste in the beginning was tart, slightly medicinal along with a hot alcohol, cognac note. As the beer warmed, the citrus and cognac notes intensified and were really pleasing on the tongue. Overall this is a really solid and drinkable beer and another fine example of what Cantillon does.","ggaughan","Jan 22, 2008"

4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Bought at Cantillon. Pours a light amber color with a decent head for the style. Aromas are decidedly tart with hints of oak and cognac-in which the beer is aged-cognac barrels. In the mouth the beer is silky smooth offering an aggressive note of wood and cognac. Damn this is a tasty treat! I'm so glad I brought this beauty home! Next stop for this beer is with a plate of homeade mussels and fries. Ahhh Belgium-ahhh Cantillon-a classic!","moulefrite","Beers"
4.3,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Aroma comes forth as some strong apple sauce in a hazlenut pie. Not particularly unique, however expressive and glowing, with all the wonderful worlds that wild fermentation creates, however finding a little bit of glowing crispness now. Pours with middle deep gold and a touch of haze. Flavor lands amongst fall leave, bright woody grain and a bowl of Mississippi cotton. White grape juice brings up the background of the palate. Breathing, this beer yield the true meaning of the barrel, in that, to me, I cannot really taste the barrel or the cognac in the beer, itself with their respective individual notes or characters. Instead, I can sense, deeply, that the barrel and the cognac has made this a better lambic, my mellowing, melding and bringing a new sense to an old favorite. Masterful and bold. A treat to try and my favorite of the night. Beer parts with a wisp of fresh pink grapefruit and a branch of a cherry tree. Thanks to whomever provided this fantastic beer.","CharlesDarwin","0"
