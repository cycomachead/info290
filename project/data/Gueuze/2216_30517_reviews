"2002 Vintage. Was absolutely divine. Perfect level of carb, great funk, light tartness, and zero oxidation. I got lucky!"

"It might be the greatest beer I have ever had."

"This beer certainly tastes different from the original brew. Whether it is more enjoyable is up for debate."

"Sour grapefruit, lemon pith, bitter woody tannins towards the end. Clean and crisp, very smooth with a bone dry finish. Body is supple and full at the same time. Overall this was nice to try, it seems like a case of emperors new clothes, but it's a classic Drie Fonteinen gueuze all the same."

"Aggressive and formidable gueuze. Not for the faint-hearted and very impressive."
""

"OVERALL: This is really fantastic stuff. The feel needs a few minutes to calm a bit, but the overall quality of this aged gueuze is excellent. Well meshed and balanced flavors highlighting both the funky and acidic sourness sides of the style. A real treat and I'm happy to have had the chance to try this first vintage. Thanks again guys! Was another great sour day."

"As I found myself sipping on the dregs at the very end, I wondered if I'd ever taste something like this again. I probably won't, but it's wonderful to see what excellent wood and the ever fantastic recipe of 3F's oude gueuzes lead up to after years of aging. Unbelievably rich yet super easy to drink, and filled with aromas that take me across different palates overall, this is supremely fabulous stuff. I will hold this memory as closely to me as possible for the rest of my life."

"O: Although this isn't the best geuze from Armand, it certainly has an intensity (especially in the aroma) that not many other blends can match. Very nice."
""
"2003 Vintage - thanks for sharing Eugene! Pours cloudy, bright orange with a nice off white head. The smell twists my nose with funk, sourness and tartness. Taste is Wow! The taste is so well integrated and wonderful - tart, sour and funky. Light bodied with active carbonation. Overall a really great beer."
"its mean, its a vintage and it should be obtained at all costs. Hide your mothers and daughters when this bad boy comes to town, get ready to ride the sour express."

"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a nice white head. Smell is oaky and peppery with a little bit of funk. Flavor is nice, but not as complex as expecting, especially right after the Armand'4s. It's extremely drinkable and refreshing with a nice amount of citrus, oak and black pepper, but isn't all that sour or funky. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and super dry. Overall this is a nice gueuze but not really any more impressive than the regular 3F gueuze."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with malt, yeast, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with quite an earthy flavor and an acidic finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great gueuze, I haven't tried many but this one was almost at the top of what I've tried (probably second only to Lente)."
""
""
""
""
"O- A delicious gueuze, the flavors are complex and well-blended. This is a phenomenal beer and another testament to Armand's masterful skill, this beer only falls short of Armand'4 in terms of the best gueuzes I've ever had."
""
""
""
"O-Had this side by side with Armand & Tommy and I thought it blew Armand & Tommy out of the water. The funk has taken a nice, big hold of this and isn’t letting go. Armand is a magician. One of the best gueuzes I've had to date, trailing only Loerik and Blauw in my opinion. I will actively be seeking more bottles of this."
"750mL 2002 yellow label thanks to BrainLayer. Okay. Let’s crack this bad boy once again. Is it really the best beer of all time? Cork pops off with aggression. Pours is hazy, deep orange with beige mousse. Thicker. Quickly settling. Nose is perfect. Mild celery seed gets demolished by overripe peach and red grapfruit which yield to overwhelming fresh birch and cedar with hay and horsey dry funk. Cobwebby old character is juxtaposed with fresh and fleshy overripe peach. An insane experience. Taste is ultra quenching white grapefruit peel with sharper wood shavings. So much old dried citrus peel plays with wood and hay. Palate is perfection. Effervescent and juicy with briny saltwater demanding this be drunk in large, quenching gulps. It’s disappears so quickly from the glass. What can you say? Is the best beer that which demands a slow savor, or that which demands its consumption with boundless temptation and seduction? This is probably the best beer ever made. Like the big brother to Beatification which passed on its power but will never yield the throne. 1/22/2012 10/4/9/5/19=4.7"
""
"Overall - I don't know if this is better than regular Oude Geuze. I guess I'd need to try them side by side. Armand blends the best gueuzes and this is no exception. Phenomenal."

"2004 vintage, Bottled on 09.04.2004 - Pours cloudy orange with a tiny head. Aroma of tart fruits, peach, some earthy notes and yeast. Taste is quite tart with some fruity notes, hints of peach and some dry earthy notes. Sourness is quite soft and smooth compared to a fresh bottle. Finish is smooth and dry with a lot of tart fruity notes. Well balanced, well aged geuze. Soft and not as aggressive as a fresh bottle, still extremely tasty."

"Big thanks goes out to funkydelic for sharing this one during a recent tasting! Another brew that has long evaded me to try at a tasting! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger subtle off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, fruit, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, funk, sour, tart, and citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. A beer that I have been wanting to try for quite some time that has been at MANY tastings, but never gotten opened. It finally happened! I am a huge fan of the regular version, but this one takes it to a new level with a more citrus and lemon rine aspect going on than the regular. It was quite drinkable and extremely enjoyable. While being very sour and tart it didn’t make me feel like my teeth were melting which was a nice welcomed change. Definitely worth seeking out and I would love to see how this one ages over the years in a proper cellar."
""
"Obviously with 3F on the label, it's going to be good, but it's not one of the best in style I've ever had. Will still have again"
"4.0 D: This is good and I appreciate the funk, but it's a tad bit disappointing, especially given how impressive the nose is. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great gueuze, but I expect a lot from 3F when it comes to them."
"I enjoyed this more than any of the Armand'4 bottles we opened immediately prior. This one aged quite well; wish we had another bottle."
""
"Probably not the most complex brew of the day, but its balance rivaled Lou Pepe Gueuze, and promised good things from aging this style of beer. Happy to try it, thanks again!"
""
"Overall: Not too biting, which was nice. I thought this was a fantastic gueuze. I haven't had this new, but the age seems to have done it well."
"4.5, 4.5, 4.0, 4.0, 4.5"
"Great balance of funk and citrus. A stellar example of a proper blend of gueuze, in the same ballpark as Lente if you ask me. I hope to encounter this one again, but the price and way it's acquired deters me a bit."
"O: Absolutely wonderful, hands down the best Gueuze that I have ever had. I really have nothing else to say about it. Simply perfect."
"O - Very enjoyable. I'm loving the 3F musty funk. Good tart/bitter character with a nice earthiness as well. After an amazing tasting day at 3F, I can't help but be a bit sad thinking about how difficult it is to find nice lambic/geuze in the U.S. But what a day it was..."
""
"2005 vintage 375ml bottle. bright sweaty cheesy funk with a touch of leather and old musty basement. Taste is bright lemons, grapefruit, quite citric. touch of pickle juice. really really good. super dry. awesome citrsuy fruit character. lotta old rustic funk. complex, yet clean. awesome beer :)"
""
""
"O - I have now had nearly all of the gueuze's from drie fonteinen and I can definitely see why people go crazy over them. They are crisp and flavorful while remaining easy to drink. Not my favorite of the bunch but no slouch either."
""
""
"On a side note, I had this February 10, 2005 vintage alongside my girlfriend's April 12, 2005 bottle. I found my bottle to be slightly drier up front and much less pithy and bitter on the finish. It also had a much more plush mouthfeel. That said, I definitely preferred my bottle to hers."
""
"O - I am not a sour beer fan. That is way the scores are this low I guess, but this sour I would love to try it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, they are both good beers, glad I got to do a side by side, its not 'radically' different than the modern, so don't expect that, but there is a notable difference."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, having recently had a ""fresher"" one from 2010, i can begin to understand the current demand for aged sours. really easy drinker and really a wonderful interesting beer. although i doubt i'll ever dig sours more than RIS, it is a style that i am beginning to enjoy exploring."
""
""
"I will certainly buy a lot more of this in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is so nice and more complex than the regular. Much much.more enjoyable."
""
""
"O: A very drinkable gueuze if there ever was one, I just wish it was a little more potent."
"O: I like the flavors quite a bit in the way of sour candy. Not to be savored for a very long time, but worth investigating."

"The taste is dry, funky and earthy and way more so than it is sour. Light on the palette and goes down quite easy. Not all that tart or vinegary. Really tame for a guezue. Overall, I thought this was a very accessible idea of a guezue and I enjoyed it very much."

"The beer is just delicious. Spectacular gueuze that I hope to acquire some bottles for myself..."
"Pours a hazy orange. Nice yellow colour. Light white head. Nice appearance. Smells funky as shit. Amazing. I love the aroma. Tastes Funky. Sour and really dry. Love the flavour profile. Good mouthfeel overall a stellar brew..."
"O - Light, tart, funky, refreshing. So many layers here it is mind boggling."
"This beer defies traditional reviewing. Yes, classic gueuze aromas of hay and barnyard and lemon and a refreshing tartness, but what I really mean to say is: this beer smells and tastes like heaven. With complete seriousness, I think this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Should you find yourself in the presence of this beer, do not pass it up under any circumstances."
"this is just amazing, one of the best from drie fonteinen."
"375 ml. 2005 vintage. Pours a still, clear amber with no head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is majestic. Huge amounts of funk, mushroom, oak, sweaty socks, light lemon, apple, and grapefruit. The taste is tons of funk as well. A decent initial tartness, some oak, light lemon, grapefruit, and sweaty socks with a bretty funk finish. Very smooth for the amount of complex flavors happening. Medium body. Soft, chewy mouthfeel. Close to no carbonation. This beer was simply magnificent. All the complex flavors come together wonderfully. The only thing I could ask for is slightly more carbonation."
"375ml corked and caged bottle generously shared by jedwards. 2004 vintage. Pours a translucent golden orange with a quarter inch bright white head. Nose expresses citric acid and cork. Taste is fairly clean - more acidic notes, cork and a slight peppery quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in consistency (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. All and all, an easy drinking and refreshing geuze that's fairly mellow, despite the the age. I definitely would like to pick up a few of these to throw in the cellar."
"O: This was a very good beer that suffered slightly from lack of carbonation and a smell that was a bit underwhelming. Still, the taste was wonderful and very balanced. Would gladly have again."
"Huge thanks to TOG (the original glazeman) for far and away the best sour I've ever had. This 2006 gem was everything and more that I could have ever expected."
"Vintage 2002. Aroma: Dank funkyness, sharp funk some cheese and citrus layers. This is going to be sharp and sour! Appearance: Dark gold and long lasting white foam. Flavors: Actually, it is not that sour. It is a very balanced rounded citrus sourness. Also, earthy notes and wood brings a nice complexity. Palate: Relatively high carbonation and full bodied. Could have been more dry. Overall: This beer was top shape and very good. Tried the 2007 vintage directly after which I liked a lot. Much sharper, a little more straightforward but equally good."
"Overall: Funky, very complex, and quite enjoyable. As my lambic experience grows, this is definitely one I would like to revisit in order to appreciate more of the complexity that I may have missed. Nonetheless a fantastic beer."
"Cheers!"
"Drink- I couldve drank a whole lot more. I can't imagine what trade value is for an 04, but I sure as shit want to find out."
"(But it's great now, too...)"
"This is a medium bodied brew. Not still but boasts a very light level of carbonation. This experience certainly differs from my previous samples. I cant say it was bad but certainly interesting. I think it might be time to finally bust out some of the older bottles I have been hanging on to."
"Overall: As mentioned before, I had all the available vintages until now, but the 2002 beats them all! the 2002 is a true world class beer!"
"O/D - Good Gueuze. I can't really tell what the extra age has done but the base Gueuze is great stuff as well. Glad I got to try this rarity, it was worth it."
"750ml bottle dated 11/30/2006 thanks to grownfool. I've heard a couple people say this vintage is no good, don't believe them. Hazy orange like a gueuze would. Smells like citrus, hay, barn, phenols. Tastes pretty great, sour citrus with abut of plastic at the end but damn was this easy to knock back! Overall I lived it and wish I had more. It's really too bad gueuze isn't priced more like IPA because I would hawg it down."
"O: As is, the Vintage Oude Gueuze is a very solid representation of the style. However, its brother Armand Oude Gueuze 4 Lente just makes it pale in comparison and the availability is about the same. A solid beer overall but in the end, outclassed by beers made and blended by the same brewer."
"Overall, I had very high expectations for this beer and they were exceeded. With all of it's complexity it is still incredibly quaffable. I absolutely loved this beer and hope to get another bottle sometime."
"overall i can really tell why this is so highly praised, it deserves it. a fantastic beer!"
"D: Quite drinkable and enjoyable. I'm happy that I had the opportunity to taste it. Recommended."
"75 cl bottle, 2002 vintage, picked up at the brewery some years ago. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a small white head. Smell: Sour, funky with oak and hay (grass. The taste is acidic, grassy and notes of wood, tart and dry finish. I have quite regular access to this beer, and I have to say that the 2002 vintage is one on its own, fantastic!!"
"The overall feel is a bone dry sensation. Sprity but not overly so, the earthiness, funk, and briney salt water sensation make this an absolute standout among geuze offerings. This is absolutely phenomenal. Armand is a true craftsman."
"I don't know about this one. It was quite the complex sour experience, but I was expecting something smooth and refined with all the age on it. I enjoyed the standard 3 Fonteinen Gueuze more. Worth a try, it might be your thing."
"O: This is Gueuze done right. By a master. This rivals a vintage Cantillon."
"Thanks to Jason and Alex for helping make this happen. I really appreciate it and it was a fun part of the celebration (although those non-BA's thought we were crazy...haha)."
"In any case, a thoroughly enjoyable experiment that is well worth repeating in the future."
"Thanks to Alex and Sean for contributing to this."
"An elegant and well balanced beer with a clean acidity, sampled at an Drie Fonteinen tasting at De Klomp, Linköping, Sweden."
"An excellent, dirty but refined gueuze. I have to take my time here, which is more self-incrimination than anything else. Off the top of my tongue, I prefer the regular non-vintage version to this, but we'll see how this develops over time. Both are winners."
"Another bottle, this time a 2002 white label from a 750ml bottle. Really earthy on the nose, the funk almost expresses itself as mushroom. Of course rife with lemon, orange. Tons of oak on this, so dry, oak is almost too intense. This is extraordinarily bright and pungent, and it's pretty lovely. I need to drink this next to a Blauw."
"Drinkability is quite good. I love the 3F funk in this bottle and the citrus compliments it well. However, I'm left wondering what a more recent vintage series tastes like. I think if the brett were a little less dominating, then this would be almost perfect. Overall, this is a great offering from 3F and the nose is unreal. Definitely worth seeking out."
"D - Pretty easy to do, this is a great beer, would recommend to anone."
"Overall: A nice Gueuze, but lacks the complexity I'd hoped for, especially in the finish."
"(D)- A great gueuze for sure. Dry and tart with nice fruit character. Makes me look forward to trying the regular non-vintage aged with a decade or more on it."
"Bottle. 2002 vinatage with the red label. Pours a slightly hazed straw color with a nice white head thy is quick to settle. Nice aroma although a little subtle and clean with hints of barnyard and earth. Citrus type aromas like grapefruit. Sour and tart smelling. Very clean tasting with a slight touch of medicinal undertones. Amazing stuff. Grapefruit with touches of tartness. Dry overall. Lemon zest with a slight touch of bitterness like tannins in wine. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation."
"Overall this vintage blend is definitely among the top 4 or 5 bottles of 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze I have drank, which means it is one of the best beers on earth, period."
"Overall, a really nice beer. Reminded me of Millennium, but it had its differences. It was fizzy and I actually didn't mind it. A very nice beer that shows age, but still is awesome. Very drinkable."
"Really solid brewski overall - I could have twoski."
"Small white head with tightly packed bubbles. Golden color, on the darker side. Dry 3F mushroom funk in the nose. This one is right around where I like it. Damp earth and vanilla. Lemon acidity mixed with a nice dirt like brett funk in the taste. Crisp, dry, tart finish with just a hint of malt to add a nice sweetness. Lively carbonation tickles the palate. An excellent 3F gueuze."
"The taste brings on even more funk--it's like the sweat of wet leather that's been in a hay loft for the past four years. Just crazy funky. A bit of oak is present as well. Mouthfeel is nice and light to medium with good carbonation, really bringing the flavors through the full palate. Drinkability is pretty good, although as good as this tasted, I didn't immediately feel like I needed more after I'd finished my pour."
"Beer is light and has a lot of carbon in the mouth. Its tart and sour but leads with the sour palate and the tartness is minimal. The acetic is winning I feel in here with a healthy brettish funk on the back end. There is a strong citric character as well. Its semi-fruity if that makes sense. I love the palate connectivity of this gueuze, I wonder what this would be like in 10 years. Its complex and simple simultaneously and I love this beer. Some were underwhelmed by it but its close to perfect as a gueuze can be IMO. I love this beer."
"Edit on 01/24/12: I've had vintages of '06, '07, and '08 at this point, and multiple bottles of some, and this is one of my favorite sours easily available out there. Very much worth seeking out."
"D: A good lambic, but not quite deserving of the special labeling. As noted above, age might of been a factor. Looking forward to opening a 2005 yellow label 375ml soon."
"Drinkability: Amazing, this is one of the best Gueuzes I have ever tasted."
"07 vintage: Strongly tannic with moderate sourness and funk. I was very impressed with this vintage, and it should continue to improve with age."
"Pours a nice, hazy orange with a vigorous head. Aroma is a tropical blast of pineapple with some Bretty notes; the balance is definitely toward the fruit. Flavor is an evolution across citrus flavors; starts with nice, tart lemon; transitions to orange when a hint of sweetness emerges; finishes with grapefruit as the a bitterness registers. One of the ""cleanest"" geuezes I've had. Crisp and refreshing. Quite nice!"
"I split a bottle of the 2005 vintage with Nathan. IMO, at this time, it the best beer of the bunch. Bright but mellow with fleshy, ripe and sour grapefruit, with a deep, complex funk, moderately earthy and horesey. Ripe and rotten lemons are also present. Exceptional. S/T/M = 5/5/5"
"Not for the faint of heart, this is a very hardcore sour. It tastes old and tart and it'll make your face pucker. There's a lot of that barnyard wet blanket funk to it. It's a super slow sipper but totally worth a try."
"D: This is just another exceptional gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. I'm happy to have tried this and would gladly drink this, or any of their other beers, again."
"Notes: Bottled 02/10/2005. A wonderful gueuze that is very well balanced with the tart/sour/funky flavor and a juicy fruitiness. Easy to drink and a joy to drink as well. Definitely recommend this."
"750mL thanks to Todd! Blind tasted with 3F ""vintage edition"" geuze bottled on the exact same day in 2002! Had three samples. One was doubled up. Same day different blend. This version had a nice fruity and dusty characteristic not present in the ""vintage"" version. Hazy copper pour with light carbonation. Aroma is very nice with hints of leather, horse blanket, white grape and dank basement. Apple, lemon rind, leather, horseblanket, and liggonberries. Dry finish"
"D-very tasty with great balance and complexity. the sweetness works well to offset the funkiness and the oak has just enough of a presence."
"Edit: This was the 2002 Red Label."
"M/D - the carbonation and finish are spot on and have me going back for another sip before I can even sit the beer down. A standard that most gueuze should be held to."
"Drinkability: Makes you want more with each sip due to the slighty dryness."
"After two 375 ml bottles I can say with confidence that yes, this is geuze alright."
"This rating refers to a special version of the 2002 vintage geuze, the same red label as the 50th anniversary geuze. The bottles were sold recently at the brewery. It is a special blend and not the same beer as the regular vintage geuze from 2002. The bottle looks really wonderful, handwritten date on the backside. Cork pops easily from the bottle. Looks good in the glass, very zippy, huge head. Wonderful complex sourish aroma. Starts woody-sourish, shows lemon notes, not too aggressive. Finish is getting milder, but still intense sourish, a bit woody. Prickly aftertaste, lasts long. Wonderful balanced. Extremely drinkable. I'm flashed!"
"O: The best sour I've ever had. smooth and very complex"
"Drinkability is perhaps the highest of any gueuze I've ever had. Fantastic taste, with a satisfying but not overwhelming acidity, wow."
"D - Pretty good, although outclassed by others in the style - certainly is a bit one-dimensional when compared with the better Guezes I've tried."
"April 12, 2002 Vintage. Poured from a 750ml Thanks to Jason. Aroma wicks forth with a flicking tongue of spring essence in a cherry orchard. Blossoms all around. Cottony wafts, sugars flaunt and a wheat essence plays with persimmon seeds and Passionfruit juice in a soft balance. Fleeting ginger. Pours that clear even gold, headed with mountains of residing billowy foam, lubricious in its delivery. Bubbly and alive. Flavor arrives in resplendent glory, with gentle tannins, refined sweetness and lots of elegant cotton. Pear juice and lemon oils. Tart, puckering and full of the necessary farm yard. This was tasted side by side with the standard Oude Geuze and this was hands down the winner. This maintains complex acidity and brightness, yet holds such refined softness and gentle, pleasing flavors. The young has cheese, wildness, wood and acid, this restrains those a little bit and yields soft spice, grassy fields and sunlight. Awesome stuff."
"2002 vintage bottle drank in 2008: Poured a slightly hazy orangey color lambic with a medium white bubbly head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of green apple with some acid and sour notes and some mild barnyard notes. Taste is less acidic then the aroma was suggesting with some sour notes and a barnyard feel which is quite interesting. There was some distinctive green apple notes which are similar to the Girardin gueuze. Full body with some good carbonation but slightly lower then I was expecting. I can't say that I see a huge difference form the regular geueze but IO as impressed nonetheless."
"I could wish for a bit more carbonation here as I like my Gueuzes to be very effervescent, but this is a damn fine example of the art. Very well blended, very well integrated, there is nothing that is dominant here. I do love a good Lambic, Gueuze especially, and I wish that I had the ability to drink more of these on a regular basis. Almost a bit too refined for my tastes; still rustic though and definitely a finely crafted product, but I think I prefer the regular non-vintage, and the 1995 vintage that I had in 2001."
"A love for stinky stuff (beers, cheeses...socks?) helps. As has been said a zillion times before, this style is an acquired taste, but Drie Fonteinen stuff can be counted on to see you through. Enjoyable and unique...I only wish I would've bought at least one more bottle."
"This beer will have you cursing in foreign tongues trying to figure out what it was that you actually just put into your mouth. Some Etheopian slang words are entering my head now just thinking about it. Ok, this is gueuze. There's no getting around it, you are either masochitistly into this, or you try to avoid it like the vile stench of the night that it is. I'm a masochist, let's dive in. This pours like a fine sparkling wine, with a fresca like effervescence. Are you allowed to compare beer to Fresca here? YOU CAN'T STOP ME! There's all sorts of crazyness going on in the nose. Sour, spicy, even bitter notes float up, like cherries and tar, but in a good way.Suck on a lemon, stick some tobacco up our nose, and cover your head with a musty old gym bag. Congrats, you just saved $10. The body is equally complex, but strangely different from the nose. Here you'll find lots of grapefruit and sour apple, cherries, and some used bandaids. It goes down slick, almost oily, but still bubbly and light, with a clean refreshing finish. The sourness lingers longest on the palate, but every sip was a mystery, building on the last. So far, this is now my favorite way to punish myself with a gueuze."
"Pale amber (almost dark gold) in colour with mild sparkling wine-like carbonation. Aromas of lemon, wet hay, barnkyard, paint, black pepper, and mild cherry. All sorts of crazy flavors with this one: lactic acid, horse blanket, wet cedar wood, earth, and mozarella cheese at the end. The palate is quite interesting, as it starts out with medium fullness, but dries VERY quickly. Great sourness and complexity... somewhat Cantillon-like, but a bit more woody. Wow!"
"Highly Recommended."
"M&D: a surprisingly soft body supports the otherwise very dry palate, backed by constantly refreshing fizziness that takes some time to soften on the tongue... The overall flavour profile shows a sourness being well-tamed through four years of ageing. This is the first geuze I've had for more than a year, and I feel really satisfied with the depth and complexity this four-year old geuze has shown. I'm totally convinced that this bottle was reserved at the pub for ME!!"
