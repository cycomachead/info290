3.7,33.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Real question is what did the brewer intend? If brewer wanted traditional - no success; he he/she wanted a sweet and somewhat refreshing relatively low alcohol pleasant drink- then success. You be the judge. I'd drink it cold and as a refreshing sweet ""juice"" drink.","GRG1313","Jul 07, 2012"

On the 100 point scale I'd give it a 75%, C average. I think this is worth a try and a beer to add your holiday season ""to drink list!""","requiem960","Nov 26, 2011"
2.49,-10.4,3,4,2,1.5,2,"O-gueuzes range from gross to beautiful, this is sadly on the lower end of that spectrum. its fresh too, so i know its not a spoiled bottle. it just has too many gross flavors and the mouthfeel is just terrible.","AdamBear","Nov 24, 2011"
1.6,-42.4,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,"(D)- For a gueuze, this really is a mess. For a fruit beer, its still not really even that good. Sorry to say this is an epic fail and do not waste your money on it. Whoever thought this was a gueuze needs to get his/her brain checked.","sweemzander","Jul 26, 2011"

2.08,-25.2,2,1.5,2.5,3,1.5,"Chapeau Winter Gueuze by the label. Pours a clear orange-brown with absolutely zero head. Smell: the nose is very offputting. Yes there are some light fruity notes ala flavored lambic, but no sour gueuze notes and the overwhelming character is something really nasty that I can't quite put my finger on - not quite tobacco, not quite wet newspaper, not quite zoo shit... but just bad. Taste: tobacco, raspberry, sweet with just a little cider vinegar acidic character. Doesn't seem to be in the right style listing. This is going to be a drainpour pretty soon...","babaracas","Beers"
1.98,-28.8,3,2.5,1.5,3,1.5,"D: I don't have too much else to say about this other than the flavor is just completely off-putting. As is any beer with a strong bile component.","womencantsail","0"
2.54,-8.6,4,2.5,2.5,3,2,"There is really not much more to say about this. It is not as horrific as I had feared, but it certainly has some really weird, herbal / tree like notes to it.","Gueuzedude","Dec 18, 2009"
2.21,-20.5,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Pours orange brown with a white head. The aroma is very odd and not too good. This beer smells exactly like French's Yellow Mustard. You also get a little cherry or strawberry. The flavor is similar, only sweeter. Picture a sweet mustard with a little cherry thrown in. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Feb 19, 2009"
2.77,-0.4,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I couldn't work up much of a head but there was a lightly hazy white head floating atop the beer. Nose was sour cherry - kriek. Color was a fairly clear deep amber. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin, taste was somewhat tart, but overall, not much on which to report. Finish was really sweet. I have had MUCH better from Chapeau.","woodychandler","Feb 01, 2009"
2.93,5.4,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a tobacco and rust amber that was still clear. Very quick head, but pretty good bubbling. The aroma has some definite funkiness. Makes me think of a kriek along with cocktail shrimp and cocktail sauce. The taste has a funky and middle of th road kriek flavor. Like some old cherries just a day away from being unedable. utlets not forget the cocktail sauce and shrimp flavor at the end. The palate is tart, but fruity and weirdly funky. Glad I tried this beer. But will never buy again.","scruffwhor","Jan 15, 2009"

3.82,37.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"this brew pours up a nice red amber color with a small off white head. the nose is cherries, candy sugar, light sourness. the taste is sour cherries, a lil cork, subtle oak, medium bodied, low carbo, I like Chapeau...","stumac","Apr 28, 2008"
3.23,16.2,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Chapeau Winter Gueuze (like the rest of the Chapeau lambics) is overpriced, oversweet beer that is too offbeat to be considered a first-rate panty stripper. Better to stick with the Lindemans beers, even though they cost a pretty penny too. On a positive note, they're still cheaper than dinner and a movie.","BuckeyeNation","Mar 20, 2008"

3.3,18.7,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"I have a hard time reviewing these types of beers. They are pretty decent for what they are, but I have a hard time reviewing them alongside beer, because to me they are so different than beer they almost should not even be in the same category. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew that is highly refreshing. The main detracting quality from this beer is its high amount of sweetness that can be cloying. This really is not that horrible as a drink, but it is about the last thing that comes to mind when I think of a beer (malt/wheat and hops).","cjgator3","Jul 15, 2006"
3.52,26.6,4,4.5,3,4,3,"Nothing to recommend it, unless you're already a fan of the Chapeau beers.","allengarvin","May 08, 2005"
3.35,20.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Nose contains a muted sourness which comes across a little bit salty as well. Taste and body are thin and sweet, like a sugar water solution, with fruity flavors of grape, mango, and apple. Just a hint of sourness. Carbonation is very dampened, which I thought did not go well with the thin body and taste. I would think if you're going sweet at least go spritzy. Imperceptible bitterness.","donnebaby","Apr 12, 2005"
