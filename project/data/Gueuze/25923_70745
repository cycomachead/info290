Taste is funky, tart, cheese, pickle juice and some red fruit. Quite bubbly on the mouth and thin, very dry.

The first sip is an explosion of tart funk all over the mouth. Some lemons and lactic acid linger before vanishing. The finish is pretty clean. There is a muted tartness that can be perceived but the finish is quite quick. Prickly on the tongue and a little thin.","PSU_Mike","Mar 28, 2015"

Sour, funky and dry, with hints of yeast and grain. Excellent body. Challenging but rewarding; this is the pinnicle of Belgian brewing and possibly the best lambic I've had yet. The balance is superb - this is a world-class brew that deserves to be added to your must-try list.","jazzyjeff13","Feb 01, 2015"

Then sour, dry acidity becomes more and more detectable. It hits the palate in an intense, but refreshing way. The sourness in this Gueuze goes through different stages on the palate. At first, defined by a subtle fruitiness, then with slick yeast and soft yogurt notes, to finish with a dry, tart aftertaste.","aleigator","Oct 28, 2014"

This is a beer that a lot of people would try and say “this is beer?”  I let a couple people sip this and that was the exact reaction I got.  It’s very brisk, refreshing, and seems simple and complex at the same time.  Each taste felt new.  I don’t LOVE it, but I think it’s a fantastic beer.","infinitebruner","Oct 10, 2014"

4.17,-3.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.25,"Hazy amber golden pour with quickly reducing bubbly white head. Pungent aroma of barnyard funk, grass and hay, sweet peach and grape, lemon peel. Aromas carry through to the taste; coats the tongue with malty sweetness and fruit flavor (peach, orange, bright lemon peel) mixed with earthy funk and lactic acidity that dries out towards the end in oaky tannins. The finish has a nice lemon peel pop I like in a Geueze but the finish is marred by some astringent bitterness like biting into a pill. I opened up a 2012/13 when it fresher and it wasn't quite ready yet; It's now coming together nicely and may benefit from a little more time. This is a great gueuze that is easier to find but not quite as good as 3F or Cantillon.","brianmandell","Jul 04, 2014"

The popularity of sours in this country has soared, making beers like this harder and harder to fine. Pours a dark straw color with a fine white head that thins and then settles to a ring. Nice tart aromas of green apples and a vinegar tang, as well as some light hay and the tiniest bit of barnyard funk. Much less than in some others. Thankfully, no band-aid. The taste is a bit more complex with all of the elements found in the nose present along with a vinous quality and some nice minerality. Still not a lot of funk, but long, complex sour flavors with a touch of bitterness and a slightly soft finish. Very nice indeed.","Georgiabeer","Feb 15, 2014"

4.47,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A bottle of the 2011-2012 at 750 ml. A big spritzy head that stays but doesn't leave much on the side of my glass. Beer stays covered all the way through. Cloudy golden amber with a visible amount of carbonation going on. Nose is superb and hits all the notes in the scale of greatness. Wine, hay, grass, vinegar, oak, funk, pale malt, faint honey, and the list can continue. Taste is ridiculous. Supremely balanced with lots of tart acidic notes that follow a surprisingly malty front. Oak is big but not overwhelming as it seems to bind the malt and vinous elements together into an amazing whole. The honey from the nose flows ever so gently underneath it all carrying the flavors to a firm but not overpoweringly sour and dry finish. Oh there is quite a pucker, but one that takes you back to the glass for more and more. It's almost addictively good. Feel is silky, and vigorously creamy in its carbonation. The weight is perfectly balanced and combined with the other seductive qualities of this beer I found myself seasoning what should have been a sipper. Sipping this one is an act of incredible self restraint. I had this with amy favorite cheese and my wife who is not a big fan of sours joined me in the hearty consumption of this stellar brew.","scootny","Jan 29, 2014"

4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/20/2022. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 2-3 finger foamy and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, grass, leather, pepper, white vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky yeast and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, oak, clove, pepper, hay, straw, grass, leather, light bread, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast earthiness. Moderate earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/funk yeast oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp, smooth, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding Gueuze! All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/funky yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 26, 2014"
4.37,0.7,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Overall I thought thought this was a very nice beer and even with my very limited experience with this style I'm still pretty sure that this is a good example of the style. I liked that the sourness was almost at the edge of being too sour but it wasn't super acidic and that made it easier to drink than I expected. This beer had nice drinkability, I sipped on it faster than I i expected, it was fairly smooth, clean, crisp, not too acidic, not to filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention but I think one of these 375ml bottles would be my limit, I think it would start to wear one me if I had more than that. What I liked the most about this beer was that it wasn't overly sour and overly acidic, I think both were at a good level. What I liked the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad, I just wish there was some decent head and lacing. I would get this beer again, it's a little expensive, but I think it's nice to have for special occasions and I would recommend it to anyone who likes sour beers. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, I didn't fully know what to expect from this beer, but it turned out to be something I enjoyed and I'm glad I took a chance on it, it made for a nice beer to have for my 800th review. I'm for sure interested in trying more beers from this brewery and more Gueuze's. Great job guys, this was a very nice and memorable beer, keep up the great work.","StoutHunter","Jan 25, 2014"

It was enjoyed at the fine establishment called 'The Blind Tiger' in NYC. Aesthetically, this beer is right on the mark when it comes to the style, with its pale straw color, slight haze, and thin ring of white over top. After a few deep inhalations of the nose, I picked up a certain powdery cue, something like powdered sugar, or closer still, actual baby powder. Other than that, assorted bittersweet fruit esters. Flavor wise, it's much more sour than I would have guessed, almost pucker-inducing, which is just fine by me! Also a tad earthy, which blends well with the overall flavor. A bit grassy, with rinds of citrus fruits coming to mind. Overall, this has that good balance of acidity and funkiness that the best examples of this style demonstrate. Very much worth the price.","Neorebel","Oct 14, 2013"

I prefer 3F or Cantillon's regular geuzes, but this is a lot more easily obtainable where I am. So I recommend trying this at least once, if it hits your spot, great.

Lots of musty fruit - apples, berries, grapes. Medium vinegar and oak. Taste is sour lemons upfront, then some fruity malt flavor and back to more sourness that follows through into a long-lasting finish. Fairly dry. Solid pucker. Nice tannic oak flavor.

4.03,-7.1,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Poured a clearish golden body with giant head thanks to great carbonation on top of an aroma that I can really only describe as both sweet and sour. These tart cherries and splash of funk hit me along with sour apple or grap smells, and then I get this yeasty, woody aroma that has a touch of sugariness in it. Light to medium body and goes down easy, extreme sour and funky notes that are like sour apple/pear and have a veggie-like graininess to them, as well as a good amount of tartness to it as well. Enjoyable sipper, the yeast and oakiness help smooth it out and it has a touch of sweet fruit notes on the backend to make a very good beer.","clayrock81","May 04, 2013"
4.34,0,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.5,"The beer pours a golden orange with copper highlights. It also pours with a healthy finger’s width head of pebble like, creamy white bubbles that are constantly fed by a maelstrom of bubbles racing up throughout the glass. The head leaves a lacing of fat dry bubbles that clump into sheets on the glass. In body, the beer is properly hazy, though the other side of the glass is slightly discernable. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully funky with big cherry leather scents and pineapple with light spicy notes and distinct lingering horse sweat. There is even some slight cheesy notes tending towards a blue or parmesan cheese. On the tongue, the beer tastes acidic and sweet with just a touch of herbal bitters and some nice rounding salty notes. In flavors, the beer begins with spicy pepper but moves quickly into sweet and funky pineapple and cherry leather flavors with sweaty nuances and a touch of cheese. The pepper returns on the finish with a faint touch of wheat and a lot of sweet funk and acidic pineapple. The aftertaste moves into lingering cherry leather flavors with a funky spice accenting it. This beer tastes very nicely funky. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, perhaps a touch below medium, with a thick carbonation that peppers and then caresses the taste-buds, allowing for the sweetness of the funk to do its thing, but also for the beer to note get cloying in nature. The mouth is left gushing with acid neutralizing saliva, and begging for more beer. Overall, this is a tremendous gueuze that I will regularly return to. Of the gueuzes I can regularly find, I believe this has become my new favorite. Rich and complex funk really shows itself in this beer, but the sweet and acidic components are nicely balanced, perhaps with just a touch too much acidity. This is a great beer, and wonderful for summer sipping. If you like funk then you will like this beer.","Maxwell","Beers"

I want this style to snap my head back and dry my mouth out, this one doesn't do that at all. it is not unpleasant, and may be a good introductory beer to the style, but its a far cry from some of the best in the business. fuller body, still with excellent carbonation. I really don't dislike this beer at all, I just feel like its not the best example of the genre. still, a good bottle that is fairly widely available.","StonedTrippin","Apr 29, 2013"

Pours a hazy, golden-orange with a loose, bright white head the quickly sizzles and pops as it collapses into sudsy slick that eventually disappears completely - no lacing on this one. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution. Nose expresses citric acid, rind and is quite sharp. There's also a slight medicinal quality present as well. Taste is quite tart, with the characteristics present in the nose also present in the flavor profile, minus the medicinal character. There's also a suggestion of cork. Mouthfeel is light and bright with quite a bit of acidity and a lively, almost prickly carbonation. Overall, a solid gueuze; however, a bit young. Definitely would like to see how this beer develops with some time.","Jwale73","Apr 22, 2013"

The herbal characteristic is so subtle I'm wondering if it's just my imagination... The beer is light bodied and drinkable with ample carbonation and sweetness to counter its immense sourness.

Aroma has lots of earth, sour lemons and a pleasant mineral tone. Lots of musty fruit - apples, berries, grapes. Medium vinegar and oak. Taste is sour lemons upfront, then some fruity malt flavor and back to more sourness that follows through into a long-lasting finish. Fairly dry. Solid pucker. Nice tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is a light sparkle on top of a relatively full body for a lambic. This is an excellent beer, and it's wonderful to have another traditional lambic brewer available in local stores.

The flavor is a nice mix of funk and tart with peppery and yeasty funk up front followed by some light tart fruits, plastic phenols, and finishing with a long lingering lactic and lemon finish.

Fairly heavy on the must. The flavor is much the same with heavy citrus up front. Lots of lemon rind and cut grass. Just a hint of vinegar. Lots of must and damp earth. The mouthfeel is nice. Finishes dry but not as dry as some Gueuzes I've had. Overall, I'm pretty excited to have another blender in business.

4.29,-1.2,4,5,4,3.5,4.5,"The palate opens sharp and sour, with a blend of grapefruit, lemon and lactic sourness. There's a sharpness present that makes me think green apples as well. The mid-palate has a pretty solid grainy and wheat husk tannin character, drying out the palate and focusing the sourness. The funk is moderate, slightly whelmed by the sourness. Earthy on the finish with some dried mushrooms, there's a long lasting grapefruit pith sourness blended with some lactic sourness. Light in body but with a noticeable grainy heft that lends no sweetness and keeps this from being watery, this beer does feel a little full even. Highly carbonated (a little too much for my liking) and has a very tasty finish, and an hour in, when the carbonation dies down, the tannins do begin to take over, along with the Boon lambic. This is an excellent gueuze, and one I will drink more of. And when put in the context of it being Pierre's first commercial release that he had to "rush out", it's even more impressive.

It's quite easy to drink a 375ml on your own, although the acidity could prove challenging with larger serving sizes.","MasterSki","Oct 16, 2011"
4.51,3.9,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This beer has reminded me why sour is the best 'style' of beer. It is so balanced while still maintaining a harsh, aggressive personality. Delicious and worth drinking every so often, regardless of the price. Probably one of the best gueuzes I've ever had. I can't wait to share this beer with others.","Khazadum","Beers"
4.2,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O - Yumy Gueuze. Very refreshing and has some good subtle favors for a sour ale. Simple and delicious.","JoEBoBpr","0"
4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Not as complex as Cantillon or 3F, but standing tall right now for a first batch. Time should also do this beer quite well.","dragonWhale","Oct 14, 2011"
3.92,-9.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Medium body with appropriate carbonation (maybe leaning in the too-heavy direction at this young age), though it feels a bit chalky. Nice acidity. A very enjoyable blend. Like most, I'm looking forward to seeing how this ages.","Verecund","Oct 13, 2011"

4.23,-2.5,4.5,4,4.5,3,4.5,"D - this is a really solid Gueuze. Lots of really good flavors intertwined together - everything is balanced really well, not overly sour or too much funk. Highly recommended!","birchstick","Oct 12, 2011"

4.17,-3.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"One of the better ones in our line up. I'd certainly like to have some more of this. Since its new this beer's full aging potential hasn't been explored, but its really nice when its relatively young.","MbpBugeye","Oct 08, 2011"

4.32,-0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Nice nose on this gueuze, horse blanket and funk, a little apple too. Very tart bite, more sour than others had led me to believe. Some citrus juice character, this evokes memories of Cantillon and 3F, very satisfying.","TurdFurgison","Oct 04, 2011"
4.3,-0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Had this on tap earlier, basically the only differences are that this was a bit more funky, and carbonated a lot better. Both are very good.","russwbeck","Oct 03, 2011"

My tongue feels like I just ate a bag of candy and has sever little bumps, my stomach is little upset, and yet I am please. Refreshing and interesting drink for certain. I bought two of these and the other one is disappearing into my cave for a few years.","beveritt","Oct 01, 2011"
4.03,-7.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall -- Better than anticipated! In my mind, this is the mid-point between Cantillon Dre Fonteinen gueuzes. I would put Cantillon above it, but not by much.","yeahnatenelson","Oct 01, 2011"

4.12,-5.1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a tad orange. A mostly white head crowns the beer and is slow to recede. When it does it leave behind a healthy dose of lacing. Smells of beautiful funk – mostly wild yeast dominate with a nice lemon citrus note adding to a wonderful nose. It is heavy enough to increase my anticipation. First sip is puckering sour that simultaneously hits in the front and middle of the mouth. Though it is fairly dry, there is just enough sweetness to think more age might increase the sourness. But I must say the sourness is quite desirable right now. Nice sour lemon and green apple flavors highlight this fine beer. Light carbonation tickles the tongue creating a very good mouthfeel. This is a great lambic and is worthy of being sought out by sour freaks.","ATLbeerDog","Sep 29, 2011"
4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall a really nice gueuze. Typing this up I realize I'm not good at describing the flavors in this style. That said I really like this and think it compares favorably to others in the style. nice mix of funk and sour. I'll be interested to see how this ages but I have no problem drinking it as is.","jpmclaug","Sep 27, 2011"
4.38,0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very nice, I got to drink 3 of these (shared with others of course) in a 24 hour period. One big bottle left to share sometime years down the road. Should appeal to anyone who likes Cantillon's Classic Gueuze.","Beerandraiderfan","Sep 25, 2011"

4.42,1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, a solid first effort from a promising new Gueuze blender. Not only does Tilquin carry an impressive resume, having worked at 3F & Cantillon, but also the only blender allowed to buy wort from Cantillon. Here's to a successful future for Gueuzerie Tilquin.","emerge077","Sep 19, 2011"

4.05,-6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. The 6% abv is integrated quite well. This brew is easy drinking and quite refreshing. It boasts a broad array of funky and sour character that was easily approachable. I look forward to opening another one of these with some age on it. My only gripe is that this offering was a bit more bitter than I am use to in the style. Regardless it was enjoyable.","stakem","Sep 17, 2011"

4.17,-3.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"One of my friends told me that this was good, so I figured I'd try it! 12.7 ounce caged and corked bottle, best before date of 15/02/2021, $9.99 a bottle. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head that went away quickly. Not much lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like hay, lemon peel, sweet and tart apples, and some oak and funk. The tartness is noticable but not strong in the aroma. Luckily, the tartness really comes out in the flavor of this brew. It tastes like tart apples, lemon peel, hay, oak, and funk. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's dry and has decent carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I'll have to buy another bottle of this and age it for a while.","bluejacket74","Beers"
4.17,-3.9,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Poured a nice straw color with a good white head that is a bit fizzy. A bit of lacing, though not a ton. The nose brings forward a good dosing of citrus. Not nearly as cheesy as the draft version. Good citrus flavor and light funk. Bright acidity. Light body and a dry, lightly-puckering finish. Really great for the first run, and something I was very glad to try.","Thorpe429","0"
4.25,-2.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I went back and forth several times concerning which one I liked the best, this or the jonge lambic. The jonge was quite bright and acetic, this was probably more acidic overall and more oaky / funky in the back. This probably wins in the long run, a great little gueuze, very nice to try. I'd have it again.","drabmuh","Sep 06, 2011"
4.08,-6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"O - A little young but damn good, this beer'll be fantastic when it matures, picking up more nuances and subtlety as it goes. Candidly, it's hard to go wrong with a) a sour and b) a gueuze. Tilquin is gonna blow up like Hollywood with a beer this well-done young. Get it now while it lasts.","BeerFMAndy","Aug 29, 2011"

4.62,6.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Nothing about this beer is overwhelming. Every element is complimentary to every other element. This is an expertly blended Gueze.

4.2,-3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O: I liked this. I’d put its flavor profile somewhere between Girardin and Cantillon, and while it could use more complexity, I think subsequent batches (or some age) will treat this well. Hopefully it comes into the US market at a good price... cause I’d gladly toss this into my normal line up with Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, De Cam, and Girardin.","callmemickey","Jul 05, 2011"
3.85,-11.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I sampled this next to a Girardin that was bottled within 6 months of the Tilquin, and the Girardin was the clear winner. I think it would be nice to do a side by side with all 4 of the lambics he uses to really get a feel.","xpimptastikx","Jul 05, 2011"
3.78,-12.9,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Leathery dry brettiness upfront in the taste. The sourness hits the back sides of my tongue and sort of lingers there after the finish. It's sharp and lemony. That being said I feel this is quite young. It needs the maturity of the 3 year old to create a stronger connection between the funk and the sour. Right now it's nothing remarkable and slightly better than middle of the road for me.. I will look forward to future batches.","BearsOnAcid","Beers"
3.58,-17.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: I am happy to see a new geuze blender in Beglium! It is even the first one in the French speaking part of Belgium. Their beer however, still lacks the complexity of Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen. Also I like the geuze more sour. A nice geuze to drink though","rvdoorn","0"
