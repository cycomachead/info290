Cloudy amber-orange pour, with a nice fluffy white head that settled at a small layer. Funky, lemony aroma, cobwebby, green hops and oak. More of the same in the taste, barnyard funk, earthy, green hop notes, lemon, acetic acid. Light-medium body, awkward mouthfeel. Reminded me a little of Iris, which I really do not like fresh. So I'm interested to see if I like this beer better when it's got some age on it. Hops in lambic just doesn't really do anything for me.","Rifugium","Mar 15, 2015"

Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, it's smells like apricots, hay, funk, citrus peel and some peppery spice.  The brew tastes like citrus (mostly lemon) peel, hay, funk, bready/grainy malt, oak, peppery spice, earthy/floralness, and some white grapes.  There's a nice mix of tartness, fruitiness, and funky/earthiness.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation.  I thought this was good, definitely worth picking up if you come across some!","bluejacket74","Jan 04, 2015"

From what I'm aware of, both this one and Iris are hopped up lambics, but I think I prefer this one a little more, as it's a lighter lighter in body and less bitter. Perhaps the blending that takes place in this one (that I don't believe takes place in the Iris) has smoothed out the rough edges a bit.","LambicPentameter","Oct 13, 2014"

And I certainly enjoy the 2 year old base lambic better than the all pale malt Iris base. The hops seem to shine through more on this as well without the sharper hop bite of Iris.

Aroma of vinegar, oak, hay, sour apples, lemon peel, wet dog, maybe a little mango pineapple tropical thing going on here. Flavor is sour oaky vinegar, dust, juicy tangerines and other tropical fruits, grass. Low to medium body, low carbonation, finishes dry.

Basically, I found this to be significantly better than at 11 months of age. The floral aspects have faded and there is a much more lemon zesty, white vinous quality to the beer. I could be fooled into thinking this had some white grapes, especially accompanied by the oak and mustiness. Clear Cantillon barnyard horseblanket funk that's developed a good bit in the past few months. Really good stuff, especially as the vinous qualities seem to have developed in this beer somehow.","Stevedore","Oct 06, 2013"

Earthy spice and a bit of yeasty funk balance out the fruit and lend some tartness to the mouthfeel. The finish is very dry, and I’m getting some citrus rind bitterness in the aftertaste.

4.42,1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A somewhat dull orange underneath a thin layer of foam. The head was creamy and long lasting, never fully receding. The nose is full of tart apple, leather, tobacco, cider vinegar, and white grape skins. Soft and complex, with equal parts sweet and tart. The tartness leaps onto the palate with a punch of flavor. First, it was a good amount of earthy tones, then white grapes, tobacco, green apples, cider vinegar, sea salt, aged cheese, and a light, old oak flavor burst onto the palate. Holy complexity. Just waves of flavor on top of a bed of sour. Light to medium body, low carbonation with a sharp acidity. This is a damn fine gueuze with a tremendous amount of complexity. It could take days to truly break down everything going on.","ColForbinBC","Oct 19, 2012"
4,-8,4,4,4,4,4,"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one during a fair sized Cantillon tasting! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon balloon. Poured fluorescent orange with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, funk, tart, and herbal. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, funk, wood, sour, spice, and herbal. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The hop character on this one really added a very unique touch to this style that I never would have thought possible. The fruit hoppiness really blended quite well with this brew and kept me interested after each sip. This could be a good gateway for some who like fruity hops and want to get into sours. Will be interesting to see what some age does to this brew as the hops start to fade. But as is, this is still a very solid brew.","thagr81us","Oct 18, 2012"

Nose was prominent as soon as I popped the cork, tons of lemon and sour green apple, a hell of a lot of funk. White vinegar and a load of acetic acid. Love the funk and some semblance of barrel here. Taste wasn't as tart as I had expected, still more raw green apple and pear, Cantiloon funk, a touch of barrel and notable acetic acidity. Some interesting sweetness mid-palate, but a tart bite finishes off the palate. This gets more and more complex with each sip, each revealing the characteristics of this gueuze in a different tone. Quite a light body, with a fairly modest carbonation, not as effervescent and zippy as some others, but still works well for the drinkability.

4.49,3.2,3,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Cuvee des Chamions pours a mildly hazy orange, lightening to tangerine when backlit. There's a thin white head that dissipates quickly into nothing. The nose is a bit delicate, and it's largely a blend of sweet pale fruits (apricots and peaches) and woody oak notes. There's a faint tart aroma present as well. The sour notes noticeably increase in intensity in the taste. The resulting balance between sweetness, barrel notes, and acidity is just about perfect. It's still not nearly as aggressively tart as some of the other Cantillon offerings I've had, but that only allows the other flavors to really shine through. The body is as dry and light as I'd anticipate from a 5% brew that probably has little in the way of residual sugars, but the carbonation is a pleasant surprise. It doesn't really come alive until mid palate, but when it does a torrent of tiny bubbles appear and liven the beer up. Cuvee des Champions maybe isn't as challenging as Cantillon's other beers, in terms of how much the wild yeast and bacteria have taken over, but it's subtle and artfully balanced. I imagine it would be accessible to someone new to sours/wild ales, but at the same time still has more than enough depth to please a seasoned drinker. My favorite sour to date.","axeman9182","May 26, 2011"

The aroma is soft, mixture of hay and straw, horse blanket, grassy hops (surprising), and lemon. Acetic jowl puckering sour that transitions seemlessly into a soft Brett flavor with a nice balance of horse-y-ness. Citrusy sour lemon and grapefruit. Tanic barrel goodness on the back end, any indication of the initial hop aroma is gone in the flavor. Most unblendeds I've had have been Brett bombs, this is nuanced and delicate.

Flavor is a little bit of a letdown from the nose and just general expectations of Cantillon. Flavor is a clean, dry punch of zesty lemon, mild funk, apple and earthy dry hops.

Just a bit cloudy pale yellow with fine carbonation and an earthy bread-like aroma gave way to a lemony scent and a definitely bold lemon crisp first taste. The flavor is exciting with every sip - to me a really distinctive quality. There is a beautiful balance between the hops and the rest of the broad gamut of flavors in this complex aged lambic.

Once this head dies down, the smell is detected: a good amount of funk, wet hay, cobwebs, and a rather tart vineyard of white grapes. I'm not sure what to expect after that whiff. The taste is composed of sour apple, tart white grapes, yeast (you know the taste), bread, lemongrass, and that nice citrus combo of lemon and lime that 50/50 and Squirt managed to mimic so well in the soda world. While puckering somewhat, my mouth determines a light body with an active but small-bubbled carbonation and a dry finish. I'm intrigued, to the point that I want more of these unblended beauties.

4.19,-3.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5," Pouring a hazy orange with a thin white head that recedes too quick, this looks decent. Imo, cantillon beers look better out of the bottle. The last vintage of champions was a screamingly good beer, and this 2010 vintage is close. The dry hop character is immediately noticeable, bright, vibrant, earthy, lemony, quite old world in character. Behind that lies a gentle cantillon funk with the usual suspects- grassy, barnyard and a little stilton cheese. Nothing like a wet dog or horseblanket though. Refreshing. The palate opens bright and vast with moderate acidity, with lemons and a touch more vinegar than i remember this beer having. The hop character is quite pronounced, reminding me of a good, grassy pils. Great balance. Drying and lemony on the finish, this is great stuff. Maybe a touch overcarbonated? I also get a light aspirin character. All told, a beautiful beer. While this might be a weaker vintage, i look forward to meeting jean van roy in a couple of days!","DefenCorps","Jun 05, 2010"

After consuming a disappointing Fantome Noel, this beer turned out to be a real treat. It pours light straw color, clear in the first glass (and progressively hazier with subsequent pours due to sediments), with a thin wet foam. The aroma is classic barnyard funk but with a nice citrus edge (lemons, even moreso than in the Lou Pepe Gueuze I had last night). The taste starts sour and ends with a crisp tart bite and aftertaste of sour lemon juice. Maybe a little grape too. Wow, this is easy to drink (of course you have to like sour beers to agree with this sentiment). I have only seen this for sale once in my area, and bought it immediately.

Sour but not really funky. Flavor is similar. Citric acid, big sourness, vinous/chardonnay notes, and an earthy finish that must be from the dry hopping.

Any more flavor from that department would just make this too challenging. Sour, but more horse-blanket funk than sourness, but some lemon does start everything off. The mouthfeel is smooth and very tannic. The extreme funkiness, band-aid flavor, and sharp tannins make this a bit challenging. You really better like gueuze to enjoy this brew.

Definite wood character to it. Just a pure mix of tart and wood. This is what a lambic is. Feel is as expected on the liquid and ripe with carbonation. Overall very drinkable.

After the pour, this one was pretty still, with no bubbles working out of solution. There was no mistaking what this beer was going to be about when smelling it. Tons of sourness hit hard, with a big acidic sharpness. There was mild donkey urined soaked hay acridness, and I'm not sure if this should follow the last statement, but I thought it was very enticing. Flavor really assulted me with sourness on the first sip, that moved to a more vinegar-like sharpness and acidity. There was an odd sharp sweetness in there as well that I could not correlate to anything I was familiar with. Mouthfeel was moderate with a very light carbonation. It left a good bit of stickey spit in my mouth and was moderately dry on the finish. Overall, this was another winner from Cantillon. Very good taste, with a lot of intense flavors like sour and acidity. Not a lot of complexity there, but it really worked for my taste. Good brew.","kmpitz2","Aug 04, 2006"

It develops a pleasant horsey saltiness as it gains temperature. Its hard to explain how those hops blend in with the rest, but it creates a cheesier character than the yeast alone would I feel. Abundant grapefruit taste. Strong big bubbles, surprising considering the small shape of the head, pretty full bodied as well, I like that. Oldish taste despite the fresh aroma. Sweet and easy drinking proposing a lemon slice here and there that grows into a pungent tartness reminiscent of a straight lambic.

Aromas are all lactic lambic funkiness with a real juicy earthiness abounding in this particular vintage bottling. I get hints of horse blanket in the aromas as well as hints of very acidic fruits, musty juice, and more. Ya know, the normal stuff. The taste is exceptional but very subdued for a Cantillon. This is not nearly as sharp, acrid, or acidic as most of Cantillons other offerings. This is quite juciy in fact, and less dry than most other gueuzes available on the market today. There is also a distinctively bitter aftertaste, that must be from the use of dry hopping. Although this brew is still far from, what i'd call, hoppy. Mouthfeel is champagne like. Spritzy and grand, and the drinkability is absolutely awesome. Wow, what a quaffable, laid back gueuze from the masters of lambic. I need to try the Loerik next. For sure.","francisweizen","Feb 28, 2005"
