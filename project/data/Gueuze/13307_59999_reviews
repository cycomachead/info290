"A very easy drinking geueze with a whole lot of complexity and earthiness in the yeast component, but without the intense sourness that usuakky ges with the style. Counterpoint that with the fact it is not an entry level style, either, no sweetness at all."

"Funky, smelled of ass and barnyard, with feet. Flavor with bitter and resiny/grassy hoppy. Not my favorite."

"amazing, just downright awesome sour ale here, been looking forward to one day trying this for some time now. clay station hooked it up. maybe age has helped this, because its not scored real highly on here, but its drinking like a real champ. laic style sour, hazy blind but with a little pale orange in it and a short but permanent quarter inch of white bubbles that keep popping in the surface but being replace by new ones on the bottom. a wonderful nose, acidic and mouthwatering as they come, but also loaded with musty oak character and lactic tartness, as well as robust wheat malt. hard to beat this smell for me, its everything i look for in the style and nothing i don't. the flavor shows the richness and nuance of gueuze, like a blend that brings it all out, but as far as i know, this is unblended, which makes it that much more impressive. funk before sour on the palate, and its nowhere near as acidic as the nose suggests, but still puckers me up pretty good. drying mid tongue acidity, not sharp though, because the oak here is so enormous. its infused the beer with an earthen unity that carries all the way through. i am so impressed by the depth here, and all the body that i usually wish for in lambic types. it also has way more carbonation than most. short of explosive, but not by much, it remains infinitely drinkably partially due to that, but also in large part due to how darn intriguing it is. far better than so many of its variants with the fruit, which i think in some cases kill the crispness of this, kill its simplistic yet layered nature, wash out the subtleties. not here, bold and robust, but also reserved. i love everything about it, especially the long dry constantly changing finish. this is as good as any wild ale in the game."

"Overall: Good beer, but pretty basic and unremarkable. If you like gueuze you'll enjoy it, but I see no reason to seek it out. Lots of cheaper, tastier and easier to find options out there. Take the money you would have spent on this and buy a Hanssens gueuze."

"O - The first two thoughts I had as I drank this was, this is a great starter sour for non-beer friends and are there champagne grapes in here? This is a well-balanced sour, but very subtle in the sourness. I enjoyed this beer, but more of a sessionable or starter sour. Your wine friends will like this beer and your beer friends will most likely be let down by this beer."

"D: This was a nice gueuze with bold and complex scent and taste. The body was fitting, and the finish was surprisingly smooth. Would age well, but is already good fresh. Not for the faint of heart, but recommended for fans of the style."

"I'm not very excited here. It's okay, but there are so many good options which sell for less than $11.99 for 375ml."
"B-"
"O - I can't see a lot wrong with this beer. It has balnce and sourness that is the equal of a lot of established Lambics. The finish is a little sticky. Maybe a little more carbonation is needed."
""
"D - Very tart and acidic. Nicely balanced and good kick."
"An actually approachable gueuze, in that the acidic nature isn't quite tooth-scrapingly tart, as the fruitiness is weirdly achieved sans guest fruit adjunct. The wood goes far here, at least in the subjugation of the funk, making for an overall pleasant walk in the park for the style. Worthy, and agreeably drinkable."

"Appearance is a very nice looking golden tone with a short off-white head atop. Its` nose contains apples, black pepper, wood and lemon. An interesting aroma, but nothing crazier than some others from the style. It has a taste of grapes, sour qualities, hay and funk. Mouthfeel is light, a very dry finish which leaves you craving some water, but I dig it. This is a well done gueuze and from what I understand, the first ""true gueuze"" that Mikkeller has produced. It is well done and for those who I have a chance to try it, do so !"

"Nice hazy light orange with a decent head that lingers. Wonderful smell, definitely know its a geuze. Thought the carbonation would have been a little better based on the pour, but it helps out the smooth initial taste and mouthfeel. The sour comes in at the end and is in no way overwhelming, just a nice finish. Not a bad first effort for a geuze, as it is in no way an easy style to pull off. Hope the Framboos is just as good!"
"O: a good gueze, although I wish it was a bit more sour and the oak notes weren't so up front, could have been a little bit more well balanced, but then I hold mikkeller to a higher standard then most I suppose."
""
"The pour is a hazy golden color with a white head. Moderately funky with lots of dirt, mushroom, must, and grass. A light pepper aroma in the background. Lemon and lemon zest provide a light tartness. The flavor is a bit more oak forward, though still rather funky. Mildly tart, some grass, and moderate funk. Has a bit of a young homebrew sour flavor."
""
""
"Overall. Decent beer, but the light bitterness isn't really doing it any favours."
"Overall a good take on a Geuze and would drink again!"
"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color beer with a super huge slightly off-white head with perfect retention and some very good lacing. Aroma consists of sour green apple notes with light funky notes also discernable. Taste is a semi-complex mix of green apple notes some light funky notes and subtle barnyard flavours. Body is about average with great carbonation. Well brewed and nicely drinkable and somewhat similar to Girardin with maybe a bit more acidity and less barnyard notes."

"Fresh and spontaneous, but nothing amazing. I look forward to trying the fruit-edged versions of this."
"Actually very well done for a first lambic beer. The balance of tartness with a touch of fruitiness and some funk is very good and makes for an enjoyable beer. This isn't as full on as Cantillon or as complex as Drie Fonteinen."
"First of all this is totally new for i mean Mikkeller doing a Gueuze and i heard its his first attempt and brewed at Cantillion and it pours a murky golden orange hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head that stays and leaves a rim of lacing,the first smell i get which is quite dominant is sour green apples followed by musty funk,ripe bitter lemons and hay,the mouthfeel is light bodied,a tad creamy and very tart which suits perfectly and has tastes of dominant sour green apples,musty funk,sour lemons,a hint of grapefruit and finished with a mouthpuckering sherbet bittersweetness and overall for a first effort its bloody good and thats exactly why i love this brewer he just pushes boundaries and usually comes up trumps my hat goes off to him as i would buy this again cheers."
"Poured an orangeish yellow, translucent with a foamy white head - 2+ fingers in height. Good retention. Nose is lemony, light oak and a light sweetness as well. Some funky notes and hints to some more tart notes that I hope become apparent in the palate. Taste is tart lemon, some breadinesss and a good balancing sweetness to keep the tartness in check . Slight oakiness near the finish. Medium high carbonation, with a moderate puckering to finish each sip. Sweeter than most gueuzes I've had, and very drinkable all around. I could easily revisit this."
"Deep blonde colour, big white head, lots of lace. Smell is funky and citrusy, lots of fruit with nice yeasty and wheaty notes. Taste is quite tart, mildly sour, malty with lots of fruit, citrus and green apple quite present, tart in finish. Big carbonation, full body, good feel. I did enjoy this quite a bit, would gladly revisit this brew."
"Yellow-orange colour, generous andsome topping head. Smells geuzy, with a little funkiness, also fresh. Initial the taste is tart, and then lots of malt, a long finish. Sweet aftertaste. Nicely drinkable. Brett anyone? My bottle from Quebec buying club."
"I don't really know the story behind this beer or how it was made. This really struck me as having a cider flavor and aroma that stood out. I just found similarities in the funkiness and slight apple flavor. Overall the beer either seemed too young or was made to be too subtle in flavor."
"A very fresh and accessible Gueuze. Tasted at a beer sampling at De Klomp, Link√∂ping, Sweden."
"Thanks Bill for the chance to try this one. I believe this was Mikkeller's firt attempt at a true Gueze. Pours a medium tan with a beige head. Nose has tart fruits, oak and some funk. Taste is a bit mellow for the style. Not alot or sourness going on here. Body is crisp and refreshing. Not bad."
"EDIT NOTE: I have had this one since from the bottle and although I did not take notes I think it was superior from the bottle. Probably an A or A-. Will review again, if I get the chance."
"Not the best gueuze I have ever tried, but a very solid example from Mikkeller."
"Overall I thought this was an interesting beer but was not quite as polished as the best beers of this style. Still, it's worth a shot."
"If you are a sour fan or know a lot abouts you will be disappointed so just skip it."
