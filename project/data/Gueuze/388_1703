For a straight ahead Gueuze/ Lambic that does not rely on additional flavoring of spices and fruits, this is a work of art and shows that Cantillon is one of, if not THE best brewery making sours today. Simple in its approach, yet somehow resulting in extreme complexity. I have but no choice to age a few of these little babies.","Agent1","Sep 15, 2014"

The nose is loaded with character. Fresh cut grass and hay come first along with bright lemon zest that cuts through the funk. Speaking of funk, notes of earth and hay linger strongly through out with an obvious tangy ness present as well. Taste starts with huge wave of citric acid, lemon zest, and tartness. The tartness sets the table for the earthy funk. Notes of hay, oak, and cork come through towards the finish with some peppery spice notes. Super complex, different notes come to the front with each sip. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with light body. Overall, a very enjoyable brew. Super funky with a nice dose of tartness as well.","homebrew311","Jul 19, 2014"

A pale straw yellow concoction full of fizzy effervescence, including a meringue-like off-white head that disappears quite quickly, leaving a fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is decidedly tart and funky, apple cider and/or rice vinegar with a subtle brown sugar undercurrent. Wonderful. Tons of acetic/tannic fruit but with a subtle sweetness as well. This gueuze wins on aroma alone but fortunately delivers a top-tier experience on the palate as well. Champagne or wine wine-like, with a moderate amount of horse blanket (not overpowering in this regard) and essentially dominated by sour fruit and tannic flavors ... Lemon, unripe pear, cranberry, white grape, green pineapple. Carbonation remains in the background, such that the sour flavors can really pop, and finishes very dry and almost woody with ample lemon and tart green apple skin. If I can say anything negative at all, its that I was looking for something in addition to the tartness ... Perhaps I was looking in the wrong place. Classic gueuze.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 01, 2014"

Pours clear deep golden color with nearly no head at all into my champagne flute. Aroma of vinegar, apricots, mint leaves, sour fruits. Interesting aroma. Flavor follows closely with a surprisingly juicy fruit flavor, some sour lacto notes but not super acidic at all, sweet fruits like apricots, and very very light oak. The mouthfeel is fuller than most Geuezes I have encountered. Not dry at all like others and the oaky wood presence is extremely subdued here. Low to medium carbonation. While this was a bit different from others of the style, it was excellent with lots of juicy sour fruity flavor. Highly recommended!","BMMillsy","Jun 06, 2014"

Taste is fruity rush up front with lemon, apple grape, slightly sweet, almost like a dry riesling, followed by sour notes (both lactic and mild acetic) which dwindle into a dry oaky tannic bitterness. Mouthfeel is inviting with effervescent carbonation over an ever so slightly viscous beer. The flavors combine into a light, flavorful, complex and wonderful beverage. I expected more funk - perhaps that comes with age? A different experience the 3F OG. A bit more refined and lighter on the brett characteristics. Terrific gueuze worth seeking out.","brianmandell","Feb 10, 2014"

Dry oak/damp wood flavor but not toothpick-like or overwhelming. Some cheesy lactic funk with musty bugs, straw and earthy grass countered by pale malt, bread, ester-y fruit sweetness and citrus acidity. Really well balanced with biscuit-y malt, sourdough bread, sweet apple and tart lemon juice flavor. Lingering acetic vinegar presence in the finish that leaves me salivating for more. No harsh or solvent-like off flavors to be found. Perfectly balanced and extremely easy to drink which is surprising considering this beer's complexity. Just an overall amazing beer.

The aroma and flavour are superbly balanced, and the body is wonderful. The only minor flaw was a slight lack of effervescence, but each bottle is different. Quite simply, a world-class brew that demands to be tried.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 06, 2013"

It's only minimal haze shows that it is lightly carbonated. It shines radiantly! The sweet aroma reminds one of plums, sour apple, cider vinegar, and a slight 'barnyard' funk. The flavor envelops the drinker in stages... right off the bat, tart fruit esters, like sour cherry and the aforementioned plum wash over the palate, quickly giving way to a funky/yeasty middle and a strong grapefruit/citrus aspect. The mouth feel is slightly wine-like, and seriously has something in common with fresh spring water... it's so very refreshing. The finish mostly acidic and, crisply bitter. Overall, this fine beverage is expertly balanced, probably the biggest remarkable aspect here. Additionally, it's not so harsh going down either, it's rather delicate and drinkable. Cantillon's Gueuze is truly an archetype for the style.","Neorebel","Oct 16, 2013"

Has a pronounced tart/sour edge, but there are very noticeable traits of spice, funk, fruit smells like apple and pear and grape skinn, kinda like a white wine, and a touch of sweet fruit or sugary malt. The beer is lively thanks to strong carbonation, has a spice and citric hop zip to it, get some sweet notes and some fruit flavors like the tart apple and grape. Besides being filling the mouthfeel is very smooth, beer passes easy, thanks to oakiness and the finish is so crisp yet sweet. Overall, a little bit of everything is in this beer, although don't be confused because the overriding taste sensation is sourness but the balance is great and this is an incredible beer that if you find you need to pick up.","clayrock81","Sep 15, 2013"

4.72,5.1,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.75,"1998 vintage 750mL thanks to Turdferguson at RBSG 2011 in Philly. The pour is similar looking to Loerik with a clear to hazy neon peach color and scant white head formation. Nose is completely insane. Just nothing comes close to this one: wild amounts of sour peaches, sweet oranges, fresh grapefruit, and soft sour funk that has no spice or vinegar. Only fresh citrus and unreal amounts of it. Perfect aroma. Taste is leathery and sharp with mild sweat and bitter grapefruit. Excellent, soft, leathery palate. What an insanely amazing treat. If you have ever dreamed about what Loerik tastes like, this is it. They are both 1998 batches and have aged very similarly. Thank you Sam! 6/3/2011 10/4/9/5/18=4.6","tarheels86","Jul 18, 2013"

A hint of honey sweetness before a bready bretty yeastiness takes over. Long tart puckering finish begs for a cleanse of the palette which I am all too happy to oblige. Medium body with a tart puckering mouthfeel and a spirited level of carbonation. Great brew, venue, and friends to share the experience with, what more could I ask for.","johnnnniee","Jul 01, 2013"

4.52,0.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/17/2010. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart green apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, leather, hay, grass, straw, funk, white vinegar, wheat, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with a good amount of barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart green apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, straw, leather, wheat, white vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, straw, wheat, white vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a good amount of oak presence and zero cloying acidity on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class Gueuze! All around incredible complexity and balance of flavors and aromas; and extremely smooth to sip on, even with the acidity. Completely amazing stuff as expected.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

Just the right amount of sourness and fruits. Great mouthfeel and very satisfying from beginning to end. In fact, it's so smooth and delicious, it goes down too fast. Which is a bit of a problem considering its high price tag. But if you like this style, it's worth trying at least once. Maybe a sharer in the future as a beer appetizer.

Nose is rich in aromas with sour fruits and barnyard, but barnyard with mostly animal aromas and not so much the stuff that comes out their rear ends that can exist in a barnyard aroma. Palate is decadent with flavor - sour fruits such as peach and lemon, silky smooth carbonation is a joy on the palate too, and more of the barnyard-Brett qualities appearing in an extremely pleasant way. So sour, so tart, and lacking in any substantive flaws. A delight to drink.","yemenmocha","Dec 02, 2012"

Cloudy, dull gold colored body; minimal head and retention; no real lacing to speak of. Lemony sourness and prominent oak dominate the aroma and flavor; green apples, moderate lactic notes and bretty funkiness starting to emerge; hints of hay and barnyard characteristics. Moderate wine-like tannins and other similarites, particularly in the prominence of the chardonnay-level oakiness and white grape flavor. Medium-light bodied, medium, crisp-feeling carbonation; clean and bone-dry despite a gentle sweetness in the initial tasting. Slight teeth-squeaking but hasn’t reached an extreme level at this point. Lots of complexity and just plain tasty. Wish I had a case of these to sit on.","tobelerone","Dec 01, 2012"

Lots of lemon rind in the taste, more bitter than tart, very woody, barnyard funk and horseblanket, moldy cardboard, cobwebs, and stale Champagne; sourness factor was not very high, finish was dry.

4.2,-6.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"this is a delicious and wonderful example of the style. it appears cloudy and lemon juice colored, with a small white head comprised of big round bubbles the rise pretty aggressively on the pour. acidic citrus peel and tart lactic acid are what i smell, almost stings my nose to breathe this in deeply. the flavor is also very tart, and lemon seems to be the predominant flavor, although some wild sour yeast is also doing its part to keep this tart. its wheaty, but not heavy. the mouthfeel is in fact really light, and if it wasnt so intensely acidic, it might come off as quite delicate really. the carbonation is good, but thats the biggest critique i have with this. i like my gueuze effervescently bright, and this one seems a little flat to me. not flat flat, but just less bubbly than i know the style to be. maybe my bottle wasnt the most fresh, but it lacked that sonic carbonation. overall though, this is, as the label says, the classis gueuze. famous for a reason.","StonedTrippin","Oct 15, 2012"

4.5,0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Served from a bottle at the brewery. Poured into a small wine snifter. Smells like the straight lambic with greater depth and stratification of flavor. The depth of cereal grains, cheese, earth, and wild yeast is fantastic, as well as the balance of acids. This is fantastically well done and complex while still being approachable. Not overly sour or harsh, but every bit as wild as it should be. This bears no resemblance to the pasteurized and sweetened gueuze that is too often found of the shelves today. Real, wild, excellent.","allforbetterbeer","Jun 23, 2012"

The aroma is really funky with lots of brett, some horseradish, a light sulfur note, and some earthiness. The taste has a big lactic tartness with lemon, slight horseradish, and lots of funky brett. The finish is tart with earthy brett. Medium body. Low carbonation. Dry throughout. This was drank side by side with a 3F Oude Geuze. I slightly preferred the 3F, but this was still great.

I like Russian River, and drink their stuff regularly, but they do not deserve the hype (heck, I prefer Cascade Barrel House). Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen really do deserve their hype and their wonderful reviews. The Cantillon gueuze is just amazingly balanced. I can see why some people prefer the 3F (and I love that one, as well), but Cantillon keeps its oak flavor in check, thereby creating a beer that is extremely easy to drink and exposing an array of subtle but interesting flavors.","shleepy","Apr 02, 2012"

Acidity vinegary sweetness along with a strong citrus fruit presence. Medium bodied with a tart puckering mouthfeel and dry, tart sourness that lingers throughout into a slightly acidity, sweet vinegary finish. Some oak with a ton of sweet citrus, especially lemon, and a lingering vinegar flavor. A bit too tarty and acidity for me. I can see why this is the tart/sours of all sours.

4.42,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Cantillon Classic pours a remarkably clear orange on the first pour, though subsequent additions introduce some cloudiness. Maybe two fingers of creamy white foam top the beer, and the head lingers around for a little bit. Nothing at all left in the way of lacing though. There's a ton to sift through in the nose. Complex barnyard funk takes the lead. There's also some light white pepper, oak, and a touch of vinegar that serve to keep things lively. The flavor keeps to the spirit of the nose, though the beer's a little bit more tart than the aroma would have let on. The heavy funk, redolent of wet hay, is what leads things off. Oak and pepper then split a mild mid palate flash before the acidity comes in for the finish. The body is supremely dry, and the carbonation is prickly on my tongue, without being overly fizzy. Cantillon Classic is just that, a true classic, and I'm interested to see how one with a bit less age on it compares.","axeman9182","Jan 17, 2012"

4.12,-8.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Had this one during Zwanze Day 2011 while at Holy Grale! Served from tap into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, wood, sour apples, and barnyard. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, wood, and brett. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a solid brew. I have had this brew multiple times out of the bottle, but this was the only chance I've had to have it on tap. I have to be honest... This one actually tasted better out of the bottle to me as the funk really carried through more out of them. This was still quite good in aspects of the way. I would love to have a keg or three of this sitting around my house either way. A definite must experience serving method for this one. Now if only I can find it on cask...","thagr81us","Dec 10, 2011"

The smell is slightly barnyard but not overwhelming. There are hints of lemon and fruit that I cannot quite put my finger on. There is also a nice tartness to the nose. The flavor is wonderful with the funk and a hint of oak up front followed by the nice tartness in the finish. This beer is well carbonated and has a nice light mouthfeel to it. Overall I would have to say that this is a Very good gueuze, but I think cantillon produces better fruited lambics.","rowingbrewer","Dec 07, 2011"

If you get a chance, get your hands on this and let it age. I'm going to be searching far and wide for this and wouldn't mind buying 2 or 3 to enjoy once again and then age the other two! Not one category in this had any flaws... How could this be? Really appreciated the lemon flavors and how real this one was! Highly, HIGHLY recommended! Don't worry about the price on this one, it will be worth your buck.","DCon","Nov 17, 2011"

This beer has a good amount of pressure in the bottle, right after the cap was removed the cork started coming out on it own. With a little help of a cork screw it was poured into a wine glass. It had a bubbly golden color to it, very clean and clear looking. The smell was vibrant with funk aromas that I could smell before it was even placed in front of me. The taste of the beer is nice and tart with some funky flavors going on. The mouthfeel was also pretty nice, very drinkable. Overall I found it to only be harsh on the first sip, after that it got much better and easier to drink. Good stuff for sure.","Knapp85","Jul 26, 2011"

A nice fruity vibe as it warms, with hints of peaches, and apples, light fruit in general were all lying deep underneath, however the real story was the gorgeous amounts of sour notes that were all over this one. Really quite beautiful. The flavor followed along perfectly. With a light airy body, this was an ideal beer for the evening. Lots of carbonation and an increasingly complex profile just really lit it up. There was the undeniable taste of Bret rippling through it, providing me with the great sour taste, but below that lots of peach and pear flavors were increasingly poking their heads around, letting you know there were there as well. A nice light grain flavor made up the base and kept things from getting out of control. There was an nicel ong drawn out finish that really tightened things up nicely and left a good fresh grass and sour grape flavor in your mouth for a good long time.

Pours a mostly clear apricot orange sort of color with a medium head. Less spritzy and a touch darker than the Fonteinen. Nose is immediately more sharp and less minerally than the Fonteinen. More lemon, more funk. Somehow chewier in the nose, as weird as it sounds. Flavor is massively funky, urine, manure, mushroom. Way more flavors going on than the Fonteinen, not all of them pleasant. Despite all the crazy funky oddities of this it works pretty freakin well. On the opposite end of the flavor spectrum from the Fonteinen. Cantillon is way more earth, fungus, digestive like, while Fonteinen is toward the champagne, mineral, lemon end of the spectrum The Fonteinen is actually more dry in my opinion. Both fantastic.

This beer says it was aged in oak barrels but I don't get any woody aspects whatsoever. Very light but pronounced carbonation make for a clean and crisp mouthfeel.

The carbonation wasn't as strong, but the grape flavor was right there. The mild tartness worked interestingly with the grapes. There was a salty background to the taste.

This beer is so wild that you are forced to drink it slowly...which is not a bad thing. I prefer to regulate myself, not be regulated by a beer, but this beer is worth it. Girardin is a bit more approachable up-front...but I am really enjoying the all-out onslaught to the senses that you get with this beer. I would have to say that if you can afford it, and can take it, drink this as regularly as you possibly can. These beers are a beautiful slice of history and you can only keep them around by buying their products and making sure the bills are paid at the Ole Brasserie.

Scent is a lot of lemon with amazing sour fragrances... A bit of floral notes as well with some great funk and oak. Taste is amazingly sour, which I love!!! Initially, I get tartness with great oak flavors, quickly followed by mouth-puckering sourness. Then I just get some great flavors or bread, flowers, and other citrus notes. A little bit of bitterness at the end with more oak. Delicious beer!!! Mouthfeel is almost perfect...very full bodied and crisp. Mouth-puckering sour queuze.

Smell is very typical Cantillon - lots of funk, lemons and bright citrus, pineapple, one of the fruitier smelling lambics I have had. Taste is sour and acidic up front, but as the initial harsh flavors subside there is a lot of fresh lemon and tropical fruit, slightly metallic. Mouthfeel is medium/light body with a light but active carbonation and a dry finish. An excellent Gueuze, one of the best around. I am rarely disappointed with any Cantillon beers.","nkersten","Dec 27, 2010"

4.06,-9.6,5,4,4,4,4,"The taste is a little young. Mouthfeel is a little viscous for the style. Strong lactic sourness clenches the jaw on the first sip. The front of my tongue feels numb for a second after a few more sips. Bleu cheese, leather and a little woody flavor is present. The lactic acid plays off the brett exceptionally well. If anything too well. This Gueuze is drinkably offensive. Lively carbonation lifts this beer off the palate leaving a lingering sourness. This isn't as quite as dry as I'd like it to be yet. I still think the brett has to eat through some more residual sugars. The beer sweetens as it warms and the palate gets fatigued.","BearsOnAcid","Oct 08, 2010"

Even if you don't like unblended lambics, gueuze may be the way to go. I like this beer, and it is a shame that I don't have proper cellaring space- this beer (like champagne) seems great for a celebration, such as a wedding or the new year, etc. When I get some cellaring space, I'll buy a few bottles of this to put away for later.","Mosstrooper","Aug 26, 2010"

That's not to say I didn't like it, I just had trouble initially discerning other flavours from it. Over time, the bitter sourness lets some of the fruitiness come through.

The flavour leaves a dominant impression of fresh lemon juice, funk, wet hay and a warm yeastiness. Its just like a sour and dry white wine.

This is a blend of one, two and three year old lambics that spent upwards of a year at the brewery to fully carbonate. It pours a beautiful, chill-hazed golden orange, with a thin white cap that leaves little lacing - very inviting. Cleaner that I was expecting in the nose, with a little funkiness, oak, cork and an earthy character. Pretty crazy sour on the palate, with oak, cork and a strong acidic note. Little musty as well, with mild malts, cherry pits?, sharp lemon, and a bit of bitterness, oddly enough. It has a light and tingly, very dry body, with teeth-peeling sourness that attacks the back of the throat.

I'm leaning towards that I prefer low carbonation because I tend to keep each sip in my mouth longer in order to fully taste and appreciate the flavors.

Oddly, this feels a little cleaner, as in less barnyard type notes (just a hint in the nose). If you like sour beers, or lemonade, give this a try.","tempest","Feb 13, 2009"

Beer is very clear and transparent golden amber with a healthy amount of carbonation bubbles transpiring toward the top. Head is non existent, though there is a very faint ring around the edge of the glass. Smell is Gueuze like, very mellow, not in your face funk, very subtle. Taste is mellow sour, super easy compared to Cantillon's funkier offerings. Sour with a modest tartness, clean and dry on the tongue. Overall, really easy to drink, I wish this would have been one of my first Cantillon's, would have made the transition to sour's and funk's easier a few years ago. :) Either that or this one has aged to a more mellow sour, just about right for where a Gueuze should be.","ballewblake","Sep 30, 2008"

Apears a nice golden amber color with no head at all, very cloudy. Smell and taste are quite intense to say the least. Super sour tart and tangy with some funky grassy stinkyness. Total absence of any noticable malt or hops. Definitely abrasive but for some reason I kept wanting to take another sip. Mouthfeel is very dry and dusty, yet inviting. I actually had no problems drinking this beer, I finished the glass pretty quickly. I went into this one with an open mind, and I think that helped. I don't know if I liked this beer because I thought I was ""supposed"" to like it because it gets such great ratings here, or if I actually would've liked it if I had never heard of such a thing before. But the bottom line was I did like it. I wouldn't crave this one right after a long day to crack open and relax with like a nice quenching ale but I could see it as being a unique choice once in a while to change things up.

Actively carbonated, lively on the tongue and initially shockingly refreshing and sour at the same time. Manages to be full bodied and devastatingly flavorful while punishing with the sourness and overall funk.

A nice pale golden color supported an instantly disapating white head, leaving only a slight collar around the edge of the glass. Aroma was very intense, instantly filling my room with a musty fruitiness. Nose isn't as funky as I was expecting, but there definately are aromas of tart apples. Taste matches well with the aroma. Initially very dry with strong fruit notes but dissolves into a sourness that wasn't as over the top as I was expecting. A little bit of saison barnyard flavor comes through but it is really subtle. The flavor this leaves on your lips is superb. I was suprised to find this highly drinkable (or sipable). An excellent excellent brew.

4.42,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, peachy-gold in hue with a shinny coppery highlight. The color is gorgeous. From the beginning there was loads of animation racing towards the white head, after a few moments the animation because lazy. Concurrently, the once half finger of bubbly white head slipped to a fizzy collar with pockets of foam in the middle. Subsequent lacing was minimal, spotty, and it didnt cling well to boot. The nose is very lively with an interesting acidic pepperiness, woody too. At the back was an aroma of peppermint. Lemony. Sharp yet distant wheaty hints. There are some horsehair and barnyard aromas too. Old gym socks; plus three-day-old grapefruit rinds with a grassy suggestion. As typical for the style the acidity really carries the nose. Inviting just because it is so funky. I do wish the potency was much louder, regardless I dont have any problems detected the smells. Maybe I am being greedy. Still I am compelled to sip. Again, as expected the palate is very acidic and amazingly juicy. Mouthwatering. Mouth-puckering. Succulent. The straightforward sharp acidity cuts like a knife from start to finish. Very refreshing. In-between bites of acidity are slight woody notes, some peppery flavors as well. Occasionally I detect a minty taste as well as some green apples. White wine. There is a wheaty taste towards the finish, not bright in flavor but noticeable. I adore the huge sourness! Dry finish and quite long. The palate is not as complex as the nose indicated but it is damn tasty. And a bit different then the bouquet led on. The sour/acidity drives the palate and this alone steals the show. All of the other flavors are too secondary. Maybe if I drink gueuze more often I would pick up other flavors better; maybe not as I am not completely uneducated in the style. Still, Im not complaining. It is impressing such a beer can be produced with such a low abv. Medium-light in body, moderate carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant but not spectacular. Amazingly drinkable and super refreshing, this is something I need to drink more of. To bad I can only find it (locally) in Iowa City. That is where I bought my bottle.

Sweat, horsey, wheat, hay, rather complex, apricot, peaches, cider apples, pears.... Bone-dry cider finish, astringent as well. Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation which fits very well. Thanks to Radek for bringing this to the mondial saturday gathering.","Rastacouere","Jun 07, 2004"
4,-10.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Purchased in a 12 oz. green bottle which was adorned with black foil neck wrapping. Uncapping the bottle revealed a cork underneath, which seems to be a standard for Belgian premium beers. The pour into a tumbler was a cloudy peachy orange color with an initial fizz of carbonation that disappeared very quickly. The aroma was very unique. Its hard to put into words what this beer smells like, but Ill try anyway. I could detect wet grass, sour apples, green onions, and pickled vegetables. As weird as it may sound, the smells actually got my mouth watering. The taste is also extremely unique. The beer exhibits a mouth puckering vinegary sourness at first sip. The sourness is accompanied by a peppery spiciness and a hint of bitterness. There is no sweetness to balance these tastes out, but sweet drinks are for babies any way. As the beer warms, it gets a bit creamier on the palette, tempering the astringency. The 5% ABV is so far down the radar, it slips past the tongue and only shows up as a warming sensation in the belly. This is a light and refreshing traditional gueuze, which should be enjoyable in the upcoming summer months.","rajendra82","May 21, 2004"
4.32,-3.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This gueuze poured a hazy golden color with thin white foam that settled. The smell was a strong, tart lambic aroma: horse blanket and sour apples. The taste was sour and tart (puckering) with green apples and grape skins and horse blanket flavors. The aftertaste was bitter and dry. The mouthfeel was dry and tart and crisp with medium body and sharp carbonation. This was a very crisp and refreshing gueuze.","UncleJimbo","Apr 04, 2004"

Aromas of banyard funk and malt mixed with a looming sourness that is apparent in the nose, maybe something like lemon. Tartness is prevailing on the palate, but pleasant and puckering at the same time. Barnyard funk comes through again with sampling the beer. Fantastic. Glad I've saved the 750 ml to share with a couple friends. One of the finest examples of the blended lambic style I've tried.","crookedhalo","Mar 24, 2004"

4.23,-5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, for lack of the correct glassware. Very effervescent, lots of tiny bubbles form in the pouring process. They all gather together to form a thick white head when all's said and done and the bottle's empty. The fluffy head slowly collapses on itself as time passes, leaving little to no lace. Bubbly, sharp aroma, not unlike that of champagne. Orangish yellow in color, cloudy but easily transmits light through and through. Taste is defined by tartness, which is initally overpowering, due to my not knowing exactly what to expect. After a few sips, it seems to settle down a bit, with the flavor rounding out with some apple and citrus tones and even a slight oaken aftertaste. A complex and pleasing brew, which after all isn't that surprising, considering the Shelton Brothers don't import just any old beer.","ppoitras","Feb 14, 2004"

Aroma: Tart and acidic barnyard tones of wild yeast, tickles the nose with pure tartness a blend of 1, 2, and 3 years aged lambic. Taste: Layers of tart woody tones with a strong backing of semi tart semi sweet flavors, very complex and strange. The wild spontaneous fermentation creates flavors unknown to most human palate, I'm intrigued and impressed by this offering. Mouthfeel: Spritzy carbonation coats the palate with a great sensation of inordinate flavors. Drinkability: Such a complex different style shouldn't be as drinkable as this very unique and tasty making it a great drinking experience that I would love to taste at Brasserie Cantillon.","WVbeergeek","Feb 02, 2004"
4.1,-8.7,4,4,4,4,4.5," The first sip provided me with a big kick in the face of tart fruits. Yep, this is a Gueuze all right. The peaches really seem to come out in the flavor. Apples die a bit, and the pears are all there. Citrus flavors come in to join the party. All of them combine into a massive tart flavor that causes salivation at the end of every single sip, allowing me to suck in some more of this fine nectar. I find myself trying to squeeze more out of the sides of my mouth. The woody notes are a very nice addition, and they provide a bit of balance as well as an aid to complexity. It is very smooth with almost no carbonation at all. Drinkability is excellent, and a 750 may not be enough. I will do my best to keep myself from breaking the bottle and licking the insides.","ElGuapo","Jan 21, 2004"

The smells of apricots, pears and tropical fruits follow up with similar flavors of orange, pear and peach and nice dry citrus hop flavors - lemon, grapefruit and sour grape.

4.37,-2.7,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Cloudy pale amber hue. Thick, dogged, vanilla white head leaves tattered, rough lace. Dryish, dusty yeast, multiple flora must along with dessicated hay hit the nose initially. They are promptly ensued and complemented by bittersweet lactic notes as well as mellow hints of underripe pair. Understated and welcoming aromawise. Sharper, acetic notes incipient in flavor bite the palate, then taper languidly into a melange of lemon flesh and old lemon peel. Muted, washed horse like enteric hints emerge mid palate along with ghostly kernels of wheat, lending an odd, yet agreeable soured grain impression. Stately underripe plum flesh tartness and tannic skin bitterness persists as a constant undertone. Well carbonated and spritzy, yet there's a subtle, proteinaceous quality that adds girth to the body. Finishes with a brusque snap of oaky sweetness, but otherwise simply lactic and arid. A beautifully complex brew, with an austere, yet assertive acidity. The flavor components haven't quite coalesced, but cellaring should quell any astringencies nicely. Bottled in 2002.

4.8,6.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This beer has a deep golden hue to it but it glows an almost luminescent orange. A compact and long lasting white head adorns the surface. Carbonation noted is modest. There's a nice musty aroma to this beer. Also a little of that Barnyard/Horse Blanket aroma mixed in. And some lemongrass and vinegar on the nose as well. Very inviting. I think this gueuze nails the flavor profile right on the nose for the style. Just delicious. Quite drinkable. I'm surprised at how fast I'm drinking this lambic. The mouthpuckering quotient seems a bit tamer in this one than in other styles of Cantillon I've enjoyed (Kriek and Rose). I like the way the tart acidity is kept in check, but still is allowed to give an abundance of character to the beer. Some hay and stale hops are noted. Vinegar. And a somewhat crass ""farmyard"" flavor that is quite enjoyable. Damn fine gueuze.","Bighuge","Aug 11, 2003"

4.82,7.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I sampled this at the Cantillon Brewery, where it is served in a wicker basket on its side at room temperature. Gueuze is a very distinctive brew, and is certainly not for everyone. Personally, I'm enjoying the style since my first exposure to it in Belgium. This pours a light golden color with a large, fizzy head from the corked and capped magnum bottle. Its smell is fresh and tart, and one can tell that acidity is on its way before even tasting it. Notes of honey are also present in the nose. The taste, to me, is unlike anything I've tried. The acidity creates a menacing pucker effect at first, but for me, that drew me in closer to the beer, where I discovered notes of Granny Smith apples, honey and sugar. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated and cuts through one's palate like a fine champagne. This actually drinks quite well on a warm day -- super refreshing with its big acidity and citrus notes. Wonderfully complex, yet remarkably enjoyable. A fantastic traditional offering from Cantillon.","Jon","Jun 14, 2003"

Musty hay smell with some slight woody characterisitics to it.  Cheek puckering tartness starts this one off with an apple and grape skin flavor to it.  A nice fruity sweetness is in the back of this brew and keeps a very pleasant balance.  Extremely crisp and refreshing, this lightish bodied brew is an absolute pleasure to drink.

Had the color of a chardonay wine and when you smelled it, it made your mouth water and caused a little puckering. The sample I had was very young - less than 2 months in the bottle and was sweet enough to balance the tartness. Ended acidic on the back of the throat. Like a tart white wine. Nice but only could drink a small glass at a time.","Longstaff","Sep 30, 2002"

Ginger flavors, lots of wine-like character, and a sourness that just sucks your cheeks in...then, suddenly, pop, it finishes very clean and dry. Here's a style I need to do ""face off"" comparisons with, a Fruit Lambic is no preparation. To be fair, I'll give it a higher flavor score and lower drinkability (its certainly everything I've heard Gueuze to be) and I'll try to think of occasions when this would be what I want...hail beer diversity.

3.98,-11.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Outside of bottle in area around cap was covered in a black crusty liquid that smelled of soy sauce. Cork was still in good condition though. When cork was about halfway out we heard the hissing and rushed it over to the sink to protect the floor. Right about the time I got it to the sink the cork shot out (attached to one of those big cork screws with the handles to make it easier to get the cork out) and it hit the ceiling.I'm just glad I had it aimed straight up and not towards my head or the window. The head was huge but faded quickly and unevenly. The scoring in the bottom of the glass left a thick column of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass so the head never completely went away. The smell was a bit musty with an aroma I have noticed with many darker belgian ales, especially the La Trappe Dubbel and Quadrupel. I had thought that until recently it was candy sugar, but I'm not sure if that's what it is since I don't know if it's used in this beer. In the flavor, the beginning is some maltiness, mustiness and a few other flavors I don't recognize. The finish is sour and a fairly lengthy aftertaste is also sour. The sourness is the largest part of the flavor profile but not as much as I had been led to believe.
