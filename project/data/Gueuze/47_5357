Taste is similar, cheese and must that turns into bright lemon and white wine flavors, a bit more on the mineral end. A little bit of citrus sweetness to balance things. Not very effervescent, but smooth and very enjoyable. Nice and warming due to high abv, which I'm enjoying much more than I thought I would. I'm gonna go out and get the kriek mariage parfait tomorrow; I'm pretty much sold on boon. Excellent beer.","Jack_Malts","Dec 11, 2014"

In the nose, funk and yeast, cobwebs, composed citrus rind, some floral notes. The taste was similar, bready yeast, grassy funk, horseblanket and cobwebs, subtle citrus and floral notes, oak, candi sugar. This was a smooth drinker, mellow and lightly sour, with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Very good overall.

Such a cohesive and harmonious product that you just kinda want to throw it back without thinking about it, which would be very easy to do. Fans of the ""funk"" may be rather disappointed as this is exceptionally bright and clean. The floral and citrus dimensions are almost on par with any us IPA out there.

Right away it's apparent that this is stronger than your average Gueuze. Lemon and lime, acetic dryness, earth, peppercorn, and plenty of wood. A bit more sweetness than others within the style that I've tried, but also perhaps more straight-up sourness. Medium bodied, tart, and puckering.

Somewhat effervescent with a dry finish, but wish the fruit flavor followed it down the throat a bit. Dryness takes over on the back end. Light to medium mouthfeel.

4.2,2.4,4,4,4,4,5,"2007 vintage with a best by date of 2030!!! Nice, deep orange color with a decent fluffy white head. Sharp and tart aroma-grassy and apple like. Very tart flavor with a nice apple/pear flavor-almost cider like. Spicy and peppery. Very smooth mouthfeel-the tartness and effervescence is rather subdued I am suprised. Nice grain like quality. A great beer for sure. Had my first geuze 20 odd years ago and certainly didnt ""get it"" then. This is just a great beer and a great experience.","lackenhauser","Apr 29, 2013"
4.16,1.5,4,4.25,4,4,4.5,"2009 vintage. I popped this bottle with a friend of mine who's soon to tie the knot, a sort of toast to good tidings and good futures. It pours a hazy sunset amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild mandarin orange, white wine grapes (pretty close to Chardonnay), light vanilla, and a smattering of very light cobweb. The taste brings in more of the same, with a good amount of the inherent funk seeping into the mandarin orange character. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice gueuze, hopefully a glass of healthy portents for my buddy and his lady.","TMoney2591","Apr 29, 2013"
4.15,1.2,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"2009 vintage. this beer is outstanding, thanks to my rare beer club for hooking this up. a real treat. it pours a radiant orangey yellow color, hazy, but not nearly as much as some others. the head is over two inches tall, and leaves excellent lacing. the nose is sour and punchy, just how I like it. not as complex as some, but still a lot going on with a lemony acid profile and a floral sort of yeast that goes well with the souring agents. the flavor is just like the nose, very straightforward gueuze. im picking up a little more oak in this than I usually do, which I think helps the sour set in and make a little bigger impression. its very refreshing, and it hides its strength incredibly well. im surprised at its elegance, being as big as it is. I think the age has mellowed it just a bit, as the carbonation isn't quite as effervescent as it probably was. but the relaxed feel really works for me, and the light body helps it stay drinkable. overall an excellent example of the style, it has that perfect sour funk profile that is just right for this time of year. this one is a winner, worthy of seeking out. could see giving it another 10 years or so too...","StonedTrippin","Apr 21, 2013"

The brew smells like musty funk, hay, white grapes, tart apples, and some lemon. It tastes like bready malt, musty funk, light peppery spice, wood, and a bit of pear and tart apple. Not very tart at all. I think it tastes more earthy and musty than sour. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with good, soft carbonation. The alcohol in this brew is well hidden, it sure doesn't seem like it's 8% ABV. In the end, I liked this brew.

Beautifully enticing bottle with an easy-to-open wire and cork system. Immediate sour scents of apple, grape, lemon, and grapefruit come wafting out of the bottle and especially off the top of the glass once I pour it. Cloudy wheat hue with a thick petri-dish white Belgian head on it. The taste is sour and intense, and you have to have an open mind when you drink it. However, if you do, the blended citrus and sweet fruit mixed with the sourness of aged lambic makes this an amazing brew. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Would go well with a white fish dish.","shigg85","0"

4.42,7.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Intensity seems to be the name of the game with this beer. And the mouthfeel is no exception. Seemingly enamel stripping from the acidic tartness and sourness. But the beer has a short lived initial creaminess that makes a quick transition into a very refreshing tartness, medium astringency, citrus and hop bitterness, and a powdery-dry finish late.

The flavor is tart and dry with some nice zestiness akin to a champagne or a cava. There is a mild fruitiness with some lemon rind and new oak.

During the lecture that I attended, this beer was mentioned more than once. It pours a hazy golden color, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Musty basement smells kick things off, followed by a combination of funk and lactic acid. Light citrus fruit melds really well together here with the funkiness. Taste begins very dry, like champagne, and really coats the mouth all the way. More subtle tart notes come in midway through, and leave things as they begun, dry and very similar to a champagne or cider. Carbonation makes it a refreshing beverage, and despite the 8% alcohol count, it comes off as an easy drinker. Our lecturer last night told us that what he looks for in a good Gueuze is a nice balanced profile, and I think that is what we have here. White wine and champagne lovers should give drinks like these a chance. As expected, Boon has a blended beer here of exceptional quality.","jamie2dope","Aug 12, 2009"
