4.52,2.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"not sure if this blend is technically a gueuze or not, but what does it matter? a genius blend of young and old blonde sour beers ages in oak, and the result could not be any more wonderful, not could this series of beers from allagash. murky but really pale blonde color, white hues to it, under a very white and light as a cloud inch of head. it smells incredible, that oaky sourness with a ton of lacto derived acidity that we usually associate with the sours of old world belgium. its that authentic, mix of farmy musty yeastiness and exuberant carbonation that tickles my nose. the flavor is everything you would expect from the style, but with a few special twists. the first is in the finish, which has an almost white grapey flavor to it that balances the acidity, that would otherwise be gargantuan. maybe more of a white cranberry, as it is still tart, but its not what i usually get in lambic types, yet is is extraordinary successful, where ever it comes from. the second little surprise here is the feel. its so well carbonated. sometimes the belgian examples come flat, but i love this level of effervescence in a lambic style, and both coolship series beers ive tried have had it so far. missing nothing, this blended sour is both elegant and extreme, and rivals beers like rueuze for the best made in its category in the united states. i cant remember better.","StonedTrippin","Apr 13, 2014"

Got cloudy as some of the bottom-dwelling yeast made its way into the glass in the second half of the pour. Fruity aroma, citrus and stone fruits, light acid, grassy funk, candi sugar. In the taste, candied grapefruit, wet grass, earth, oak, mild moldy horseblanket, light acidic tartness, and some bready yeast. Maybe a little less tart and a little more sweet than your typical, authentic, Belgian gueuze, but it worked well nonetheless. Drinking very good for 3 years old. Light-medium body, easy drinkability, with a crisp mouthfeel. Nice overall.","Rifugium","Feb 27, 2014"

This beer tasted like Cantillon Gueuze with pure lemon juice added. Tart like no other beer I've ever experienced. Even some of the veteran sour drinkers at my tasting were puckered by this one. This was not a hit for me. I couldn't imagine drinking a bottle. It's a well made beer, but it was just too one note for me.

The flavor is quite tart with huge tooth enamel dissolving properties. Lemons and earthy funk make up most of the flavor here. The finish is fairly dry but leaves a lingering tartness on the palette. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. Tart lightly funky brew thats light and refreshing like lemonade on a hot day.

This was extremely promising, and I really am looking forward to seeing what Allagash can do with this beer going into the future.

The aroma brings some nice funk, along with earth, grass, hay, straw, outdoors, mineral water. Smells very enticing - nicely done. The flavor is clean and refreshing, with a subtle and elegant lactic presence followed by a mildly acetic finish. Not on par with the elite gueuzes from Belgium, but a very nice beer, and undoubtedly one of the better attempts from an American brewery. Light bodied and easy drinking. Overall, this was solid and enjoyable. I would have this again.","Huhzubendah","Nov 07, 2012"

Its difficult to rate it to style, since it is an American geuze, and there isn't much history for this style in this country (hence my ratings are much lower than BrewedAwakening's, even though we both enjoyed the beer to a similar degree and shared the same bottle). I do hope that Allagash keeps up with this product line and makes it more easily available, for this is a fine beer and deserves to be tried by beer lovers far and wide.","ToasterChef","Sep 13, 2010"
