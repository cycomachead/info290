"Thin laces with some crackle, clear pale amber hue due to leaving the dregs behind. Whoa, barnyard funk with some tartness and is somewhere between lemon juice, table wine, and balsamic vinegar. Lighter bodied with a bit of crispness. An in your face tartness throughout mimics the nose. Funk and tartness seem very well blended. Not as sour as I expected but it hits the right level here. Simply amazing."

"It's a good take at the Lambic style... but calling it a Lambic and Gueuze just rubs me the wrong way (tradionalist) and also gives me an excuse to compare it directly to real lambics which of course it still has a long way to go.   A very solid spontaneously fermented ale from two roads!"

"Pour yielded loose bubbles, no head. Light funk, juicy citrus and oak character in the aroma. Big notes of tart lemon that are mellowed mid palate with oak/vanilla from the barrels. Dry with a light mouthfeel. Under-carbed on tap, which detracted a bit from the overall mouthfeel. I'm sure carbonation will not be an issue in the bottles. Overall, this is an exceptional American Wild Ale that holds like characteristics to Belgian Lambic."
