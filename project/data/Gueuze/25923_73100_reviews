"So good. Big raspberry throughout. Some funk, hay, barnyardy flavors. Finishes dry and slightly sour. Nothing too overwhelming. Love this."

" The flavor is pretty intense with a dry tart tangy and puckering sour yet refined flavor with wood and lemony lactic element yet malt is slightly balancing as it evolves with a mild sweet/fruity combination of wild yeast in the flavor. The taste has a subtle earthy funk in the background adding to the complexity of flavor with a mineral dryess perhaps from the high carbonation as it finishes tart. The flavor is great and so is the drinkability- I never had the bottle, but now that I have had the draft version I would like to try it. This is a wondeful Gueuze with subtle and drinkable qualities in every way."

"Lots of tangy sour vinegar qualities in this with some honey and Apple cider on the nose. The flavor is more white wine, champagne, Apple cider vinegar, straw or barnyard grain, Apple and pear. The feel is very light, with what seems to be no carbonation, much like a cider."

"Looks the part - straw colored brew with a lot more carbonation than I expected, massive cloudy head and a tad of oily lacing lingering on the now empty glass. The nose is very floral, charred wood and lemon are imminently present. The taste is surprising, not as tart as I'd hoped and very dry, lot's of wood there. Interesting how much pepper is present. Very nice beer that fell short of my expectations. But I'll definitely give it another shot down the road."

"The smell is very intriguing. Like flowers that have been marinading in the summer sun for a long time. Lemony funk, musky wood, mystery flowers all really really well combined. Flavor is dustily dry, lemony sour, apple, floral, woody, musky. Harmoniously wacky. Like it a lot."

"Bottom line, either the bar didn't handle the keg properly, or this varies significantly in quality over batches. I know to always expect variations but this was night and day."

"O - Overall a very, very good gueuze. Definitely worth the pour if available on draft."
""
"O-This is a good gueuze, but not my favorite. It doesn't have the wine-like complexity of a Cantillon, for example, but that does not mean it is lacking in flavor. On the contrary, this brew packs plenty of sour punch. I would happily drink more of this if my stomach could handle the acid and I could regularly purchase it in Colorado."
""
""
"O - I liked this version. It has all of the flavors I would expect it to have and it is easy to consume. A little too pricy to have all of the time but every now and then is fine with me."

"Poured from a pitcher due to its large, ridiculously thick looking, rocky head. It's more of a hazy, slim white ring by the time I get my pour. Hazy golden body. Funky, sour lemon aromas along with barnyard, leather, slight sweatiness, and light oak. Crisp, tart, lemony citrus, earth, a sort of fresh herbal quality, and hay. Acidic, dry, and massively refreshing with a slight lingering bitterness. Delicious...lots of bright, fresh flavor for 4.8%."

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with grain and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a sour grain flavor on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty and easy to drink but I prefer the bottled version."
"O - This is an excellent beer. So easy to go down. Despite low abv, it's very satisying and still complex."
""
""
""
"This peaked my interest in getting the bottled version when I have the chance. My assumption is that it is relatively tamer on tap, but that doesn't stop it from being delicious. This is a gueuze I could turn myself to more often without the fear of getting dried out by all its acidity. How the brewmaster figured out how to blend a beer this complex and make it so drinkable is beyond me, but it's definitely inspirational. Don't miss a chance to try this."

"Cloudy copper pour with a finger or so of fluffy white head that sank to a thin layer, leaving lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma was funky and earthy, grassy, citrusy. The taste reflected the nose, funky, wet grass, earthy, green apple, lemon, with an expected tartness. About medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, and a semi-sour, dry finish. Very good overall."
""

"Taste is fantastic for the style...its a little more malty than most Geuze, sweet malts and the citrusy funk blend well. Very smooth for being so bitter. Really great Geuze, and what a treat to have on tap!"
""
""
"Really enjoyable geuze."
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is copper orange, mildly hazy, with a half inch of thick white head that coats the tumbler in lacing. The aroma is bold for the style. Aggressive and forward, more so than the bottled version. Funky, earthy, dank. Light in body with fairly low carbonation. Smooth on the palate initially, finishing zesty with a touch of vinegary sharpness. A tasty brew, I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Aggressively sour but also a bit chewy and complex. This is a geuze that let me contemplate its flavors over and over and never disappointed. The smell was really the only set back."
""
"Pours a hazy, gold color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Sight retention and slight lacing. Smells of pale malt, strong tartness, strong sourness, and a hint of grapes. Fits the style of a Gueuze. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is a strong acidity and tartness. There is no noticeable sugar addition. Tastes of slight pale malt, sharp acidity, tartness, and a hint of grape. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and feel."
""
"This was an exciting beer to try. It's a mix of a sour lemon character and an oaky backend that is nothing like I've had before. I definitely get the lamic qualities, but it also shares features of a wild ale. Very neat beer, absolutely worth trying, but it's rather expensive and probably isn't one you'll want to buy often."
"comes off very fresh. very lightly sour, but enough to taste refreshing. great oak flavor. excited to try a bottle now."
""

"This is a really nice Gueuze that stayed more tart than sour and benefited from a sprightly feel in the mouth that helped keep this on drinkable side. Iâ€™m glad I tried this one."
""
"Quite enjoyable and was nice to try something I hadn't heard of."

"The taste starts with a tart apple and slowly an almost woody earth flavor finishes nice"

"Had on tap at Moeder Lambic in Brussels. Pour is mostly transparent straw yellow with a tight off white head. The nose is nice, huge ridy chessy funk, light mineral note, sweet peach and some lemon with a touch of citrusy hop. The taste is less bright, notes of mineral and some lighter rindy funk. Light spice to it with a fair bit of sweetness in the back, light lemon and very subtle sourness. The body is light and airy, a bit active on the back of the tongue, not very dry and strong carbonation. Well rounded and tasty, a touch flabby, not as expresssive as 3F but decen funk. Should have a strong future."

"Poured a light, seethru brownish body with some white head and lace. A somewhat sour, funky aroma, I pick up pears, grape skin and touch of citric (hop bitterness?) in aroma and very little malt base. Light bodied with a good sour funkiness, this beer isn't overpowering with its sour peak but instead mixes sourness with tart fruit and a little bit of oakiness and finishes with some sweetness (relatively speaking). Casual sipper that I really enjoyed w/ light dinner.."
"Pours a hazy golden with orange highlights. Stark white head. Funky tart, lemon aroma. Definite barnyard funk. Funky lemon is the main idea here. Moderate carbonation, wheat like twang leads to a puckering finish. Lemon is the main note in this tart citrus taste. Touches of bread and honey mid palate but sour start to finish with the finish being very dry and puckering. This is a great gueuze, not metallic notes that some give off. Right on the money."
"O: Not too complex, but it's a really nice clean sour."

"O- Great introduction to lambics for this new sour appreciator. Pleased to say I can now understand the fuss over sour/fruity beers!"
"Glad to have tried both versions. I found the bottle version more to my liking as is with 99% of sours that I come across, especially Belgian Lambics. This is insanely drinakble though."
""
"Was lucky enough to find this on tap at a local spot after a beer festival. Served from tap into a Trappe Door tulip. Poured a hazy yellow orange with a one finger white head that subsided to half a finger very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon, orange peel, funk, slight tart, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, funk, citrus, and lemon. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I have been lucky enough to try this both on draught and out of the bottle. I know they are listed separately here on BA which was confusing to me at first. However, after trying this it is quite clear why. Both taste completely different to me and seem to be completely different brews. I enjoy the bottle version better for the record by the way. Worth trying if you get the opportunity."

"O- As close to a perfect example of this style that I've had."
"Lighty fizzy, oaky and citrusy. Lemon, dry wood, clean dry finish. Fairly straightforward lemony sourness. Pulls the cheeks inward, light funky flavors, dry oak in the end. Overall a nice alternative to 3F and Cantillon, somewhere in the same league. Can't wait to see what the future holds for Tilquin."
"O - Really nice beer. Drank it side by side with Cantillon Classic Gueuze, and while I preferred the Cantillon, this one held its own."
"O - Impressive. We had this one side-by-side with Cantillon Classic Gueuze and it was neck-and-neck for me. I had another pour after the first one...really liked this one. The blender knows what he's doing, no doubt about it."
"O: I liked this, but the bottled version certainly seemed to be better to me."
"This was very quaffable. Medium-bodied with just under medium carbonation. Woody/tannic and dry on the finish. Perhaps not as complex as some of the other gueuzes out there, but this is a good showing, and it went down easily."
"D - A solid gueuze that I enjoyed a fair bit. Probably won't order this often at $9 a glass, but the bottles seem competitively priced so I'll give those a shot (even though they are a different recipe). Has some decidedly unconventional attributes for the style, but won't be unpleasant for those weened on American Wild Ales."
"O - great nose and a little sweet, but very drinkable. Will seek this out again."
"o - Overall I thought this was an awesome gueuze. Would love to have this one again and going to try and get some of the bottled version."
"First lambic on draft for me, lovely!"
"Lighter medium body, high carbonation, extremely dry on the tongue. A fantastic gueuze which blends sour and white wine into a delicious concoction."
"On tap at City Beer Store. Pours a hazy light amber with a small white head. The aroma is light barnyard funk, some light lemon, grapefruit, hay, wheat, and a bit of oak. Not terribly complex with the flavors being much lighter than in some other lambics. The initial taste is lemon, going into a bit of funky oak, some light grapefruit, and some hay. A brett funkiness on the finish with a light tartness. Light mouthfeel with low carbonation. You can definitely tell this is younger lambic than most gueuzes. I'll be curious to try Tilquin gueuzes made from 3 year lambic. This was enjoyable, but not quite in the class of the great gueuzes."
"a really good geuze. Very well balanced on both the nose and palate with just the right amount of funk to it as well"
"O: good take, albeit out of the ordinary, on a blended lambic. Look forward to future more mature offerings."
"I- An enjoyable young geuze. Age should allow the acidity and tongue-stinging quality to subside... I think I'll be needing some tums. I'd love to see what else Rebecq will come up with in the future."
"Pretty easy to drink geuze, but the complex funkiness on the nose didn't translate too well to the taste."
"Overall: another world-class gueuze available. Granted I love true lambics more than my own soul, so my ratings are going to lean high, even though I am trying to be as fair as possible! If you see this beverage on tap, don't pass on it!"
"Hazy yellow pour with no head and a minimal amount of bubbles. Acidic smell with hints of tart cherries. Undertones of vinegar and funk. The taste matches the smell, lightly acidic with the tart cherries providing a nice balance. The barnyard funk sort of holds the beer together and is not overpowering. Light and carbonated well. Dry taste overall. Thought this was a great beer. Haven't had many guesses before. This was a nice intro."
"O: A solid offering. Looking forward to Tilquin continuing in the US market. Hopefully both the draft and bottled offerings are regulars (the bottle offering is better in my book). Its clear Pierre knows what he is doing, so this should continue to improve as he gets more blends under his belt."
"A mildly hazy yellow with a thin white head with good retention, this is a good-looking gueuze. The nose is surprisingly great! The Girardin is quite prominent with a beautiful, clean lemony sourness. The funk character is mild, this is mostly a blend of lemon and orange rind. The palate is similarly bright and refreshing, with a clean, lemony sourness, a mild funk and a little bit of oak. Medium-light in body, this beer has a great, refreshing finish, zippy and lemony and thoroughly enjoyable. The funk isn't as fully developed here, but I guess that was the point of this blend. Well done."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink compared to others in the style because the sourness is not overpowering."
"O: This was a fun beer to drink. The makers of true gueuze lambic are limited so it's always fun to try a new maker of the style. True to Belgium and true to its place, I'd love to see more from Tilquin in the coming months."
"Note: after this, I came to find this beer is now available stateside. I advise anybody into Gueuze to try this out. It reminds me of a mix between 3F and Cantillon Classic gueuzes. A really nice beer."
"Overall with a light enough abv this drinks so quickly like nothing and hardly any sense of alcohol. A mix of lemon like Hefe style and Gueuze like goodness and a marriage to enjoy! That's what I get off of it."
"A very impressive beer. I hope to have this more often."
"O: It shows that this is young, good beer for a hot day, crisp and slightly sweet"
"Beer is bright on the palate and dry on the finish, light in body, effervescent on the palate, a fun fun beer here. Nice round body, pops on the palate, I enjoyed it but probably liked the oude slightly more."
"Flavor and aroma get a bump in the bottle. Much more sour and funky. Glad I was able to try both."
"Pale yellow and slightly cloudy in the body. The lace is quite good, especially for a gueuze. The nose is spot on; pleasant with some horse blanket and some lemon. Then we go to acid city, which is the taste. Even for a gueuze, this is acid and more acid. Bittering with traces of grass and very subtle lemon. Not bad for what it is, I just expected something a little different from what I got."
"O - A bit cold straight off the tap and obviously young, but quite delicious regardless."
"M: good but not matured enough yet and balanced"
"I will revisit this gueuze and re-write my review. I don't believe gueuze should be served on draft. When I drink a bottle, hopefully I'll revise this for the better."
"Very nice. Such classic characters, all very smooth and integrated. It's that perfect marriage of fresh bite and aged mellowness. Fantastic beer."
