"Blend #5. A big thanks to M-girard for sharing this with me."
"Intensely tart and sour without a trace of vinegar. Delicious."

"Fruity.  Very sour.  Can't imagine drinking a whole glass of this.  My teeth hurt after 2oz."

"I absolutely loved this beer, and while I haven't been a fan of the other Uplands I have had, this one vaulted to the top of the sours I have had so far. On par with Duck-Duck-Gooze."

"Yellow-straw color with a slight haze, lots of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass, feeding a wispy white head at the top; minimal lacing. In the nose, lacto-lemon, apple skin, hints of sulfur and crackery malts. Pretty darn sour on the palate, lacto, lemon and apple acidity, moderate notes of sulfur, yogurt, cobwebs, some acetic puckeriness, oak, dried leaves, and distant crackery malts in the background. Medium body, dry and acidic mouthfeel, lively carbonation. Interesting to call this a gueuze, but I guess the brewing/blending process makes it that. Regardless, a solid and enjoyable sour overall. I'd like to try it with a few years on it."

"Overall- Very enjoyable beer that is extremely sour, but adds just enough more on top of the acidity that it's not just a sour bomb, but is fairly complex. Enjoyed the stonefruit flavours and the dry oak finish on this beer. Upland is the real deal."

"Pours a murky honey orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is super sour with malt, fruit, vinegar, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour fruit and vinegar flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic beer with an awesome set of aromas and flavors coming from this blend of barrels."
""
"Overall - I can't taste much beyond the sourness."

"Amen to southhouse brew! The best gueuze I've ever had! When Caleb gets a sour right its right. I love all of the Uplands that I've had. Ive had them side by side with the russian rivers,cascades, cantillons,and drie fonteinens. Upland is world class! This is for batch # 2 and #3"

"Batch 3. This seems like a nice enough capstone for the evening, eh? It pours a cloudy sunset straw-amber topped by a half-finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises tart lemon zest, light vinegar, light funk, and orange juice. The taste brings in more of the same, with some hefty sourness and a few veins of slightly-sweeter red wine vinegar every now and again. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a damn fine sour, one that brings the tartness with a vengeance. Not a bad beer to finish the day off with."
"A very sour beer. If you're into such beers, you'll enjoy it. If not, this is an intensely sour beer."
""

"O: Best american sour I've had, and certainly the best example of an American gueuze out there. Batch 3 is better than batch two and is a damn near perfect beer."
"Its a privilege to live so close to a brewery producing such a great product."
""

""

"Overall - one of the most complete and rewarding sours out there - more refined, more soulful than anything else on the market - not quite as life-changing as last year's reserve, however - you want to drink this cold and fresh, because it doesn't sit will in the hand -changeable, mercurial, which is not always a bad thing - we're still saying it's really good, even as we feel a little let-down -"
"Batch 2. Pour is glowing orange, light haze, and tight white head. Nose is orange citrus and tangerine, juicy wine and barrel, light musk and cheese and seemingly acetic. Taste is juicy, oily, orange citrus and tangerine, wine barrel and oak, light cheese moving to acetic acid. Burn in finish, not horrible but increasing, semi dry, assertive carbonation and a bit heavy on the body."

"A very solid beer all the way around and pretty in-line with the rest of Upland's wild offerings. Certainly worth trying."

"T - This is a Gueuze that leans more to the tart side than the funky side. This is definitely one of the tarter beers that I've ever had. It's a mouth puckerer."

"O: This definitely surpasses most American wilds in terms of complexity, but unfortunately the vinegary acetic character is getting a bit too strong (at least in this bottle). I will definitely seek out future blends if this is any indication of the program's potential, but right now there are some glitches to work out."
"O: Considering I enjoyed this on Zwanze Day and I'm considering it the best sour beer I've had today, that's really saying a lot. I cannot say enough how delicious this beer was. I almost wish I didn't share it with everybody...almost. 5"

"O-A wonderful sour. Great sour notes, balance is perfect. Not a shock this won a gold medal at GABF."

"Been about 6 months since I tried b1, which I remember being even better than this. Regardless, this batch of Sour Reserve is a fantastic American sour worthy of any/all hype it receives. Recommended."
"Had the pleasure of tasting this gem of limited production at a buddy's tasting. it had a difficult task of standing out against some other phenomenal beers that evening including hunah, 20yr elijah, choclate rain, duck duck gooze and others. it did so with force. it is very taste forward with lots of tart aroma to boot. only downfall to this amazing beer is that its finish is short relative to other sours and the great taste quickly dissipates. I would recommend that if you can find one buy one hell buy ten it wont disappoint"
""
"Cheers!"
"Drink- It was good, but needed to be a few steps up for what I believe this bottle is considered. I would like another bottle to sit on for a couple years."

"Overall, a very good sour. I can't put my finger on the exact flavor profiles, but they balance very nicely. A very good sour, with another in the cellar to age."

"This one was shared during the Upland Sour Tasting where all of the fruit lambics were present as well as a massive group of BAs to share it all! Batch 1! Served from bottle into a Boulevard tulip. Poured bright orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, peach, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, sour, tart, orange peel, orange, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. This was the last beer of the evening and we definitely saved the best for last in my opinion. Loads of complexity to be found here while still being refreshing and intriguing. It was completely different from the fruit lambics by them, so don’t go into this one expecting them to be similar. Just a heads up. Definitely worth seeking out whether it be Batch 1 or 2."
"O - Really well-done and very enjoyable. I felt batch #2 was more balanced with better fruit & tart notes while batch #1 was muddled a bit. I would drink this again, no doubt."

"Sour aroma of cider vinegar. Tastes fairly acetic, follows the aroma with some bright citrus and tempered sweetness even. White grape minerality, maybe some iron notes in the background. Lower carbonation. Bright, clean, and quenching. Overall pretty good, would liked to see more complexity, but it was enjoyable."

"Beer is light in body, not as sour as expected, flat a little on the palate, mlid earthiness, sulfur, decent finihs, a fine beer but not a great gueuze."
"The beer is hazy and light orange colored with a small, fleeting, wispy head. Nice aroma consisting of wild yeast, citrus, grass, wheat. Acetic and lactic feel on the palate with low carbonation. Pretty good flavor. Definitely smells and tastes like an Upland beer. Very good, but not world class. Definitely one of the better gueuze examples to emerge from the U.S."
"Pours a deep golden color with a short white head that fizzes out quickly and doesn't leave anything behind. The nose carries some strong lactic notes with just a touch of stone fruits in the background. Flavor is similar with more fruit coming out as it warms. Light body with heavy lactic acid through the finish. Very dry. Gets better as it warms, but the focus is too much on acidity without the underlying funk, earthiness, and complexity."
""
"Tasty, though the enamel-ripping sourness could be toned down a bit. It’s nice to smack your taste buds into submission every now and then, though."
""
"Caleb nailed this one. I wish I had more than 1 bottle. Very pleasant sourness without being over the top and hands down the winner of our sour tasting."
"Overall, as a gueuze it's pretty mediocre, but as a American Wild Ale it's very solid. Really enjoyed this Batch 2 over the Batch 1 I had earlier in the year. Flavor profile is much more lively and open,"
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Too bad it was one of only 300 bottles. I will make sure to get this again if the release another batch in the future. I am optimistic, as the label states it is batch 1."
""
""
"D - As a gueuze it's pretty mediocire, but as a American Wild Ale it's pretty solid. Too rare for what it delivers, but easy and enjoyable to drink. Hopefully they make more next time."

"Pours a turbid golden orange color with no head. Lacto and light citrus on the nose, minimal funk and grass. More sweet and fruity than sour or funky, but pleasantly acidic. Oak is present from the start and fades through the finish. Medium thick and high carbonation produces a full body. Straddling rating this much lower as a gauze and a little higher as a pleasant American Wild; regardless an enjoyable surprise compared to most of their fruit lambics."
"Pretty tasty, overall, especially viewed as an American sour (and not a gueuze). I'm a sucker for acidic, unfruited sours, so this is a treat. I had a small problem finishing off the last ounce or two of my 12 ounce pour due to the acidity, which is the only reason this is not a 4.5 in taste or overall."
""
""
""
"The pour is a murky orange-ish color with a finger of white head. Smells intensely lactic and lemony. Quite a bit of lemon peel and green apple, maybe a little bit of funk (hay and grass). A few notes of oak, too. The flavor is similarly heavy on the lemon tartness and lactic acidity. Minimal funk notes, maybe a touch of vinegar. Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Better than many of the other Upland lambic releases."
""
"Pretty bad appearance, pouring an extremely turbid and opaque straw color with a head that fizzles away quickly. A lot of lacto on the nose, along with some nice tropical fruit character. Faint acetone and aceto. Palate is good but somewhat stomach churning, heavy on the lactic sourness. Pineapple and lemon fruitiness lends some depth. Fair bit of oak hits the palate up front, but doesn't linger into the finish. The finish is quite brief actually, very lactic and somewhat yogurt-y. The acidity is felt going down, which makes it somewhat of a chore to drink after a while, though it's a pretty decent beer in small quantities. Reminds me a bit of Duck Duck Gooze, but it's a step down from that beer."
""
"Overall a excellent brew, really well done."
""
"Overall this beer just impressed me greatly. It falls just behind Beatification in terms of American made Gueuze style beers. If the most recent fruit lambic release, and now the sour reserve release is any indication on how the sour program is progressing at Upland I'm very excited to see what is next."
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent beer, there is something about Upland's house yeast strain that rubs me the wrong way. Some elements are ""good"" (4.0) and others are slightly less than good. With it being in the Gueuze category I feel a bit generous, rated to style against many Belgians it might not break 3."
""
"Pours a semi deep golden color. Aromas are very complex with a cheesy, barnyard, acidic quality to it. Really incredible. Taste is bretty fruit with some kiwi, soured apples, persimmon and highly acidic. Very, very sour but not over the top. Finish is long lasting and complex."
"Overall-- this might supplant the persimmon as my top Upland sour beer. Very nicely done."
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer. I've had all of Upland's lambics and their Dantalion wild ale and this is by far the best sour they've done. Tons of brett and sour fruits in the nose and taste, and I felt like I could have taken down the whole 750ml bottle myself (and would want to). Very glad I have a bottle of this and will surely be looking forward to their next Reserve release."
"Big ups to ma boy backfat (me) for busting open this gem :) I was really looking forward to opening to rarity. The pour is a clouded yellowish golden cider. Smell is sharp and cheesy. Bright fruits, bretty funk, and lovely apple characteristics all dominant the nose. Taste follows the nose with lots of acidic granny smith apples and delicious musty funk. Dry and great beer as suspected. This tastes old, spritzy, and fantastic. Hopefully the bottle variation isn't as nuts as their other releases. This is my favorite upland release so far and right up there with certain batches of kiwi, persimmon, blackberry, and raspberry."
"Thanks to Dave (backfat) for opening this one so I didn't have to open mine haha. This beer pours an interesting and cloudy gold in color with a white lacing around my glass. It smells of a concoction of Uplands lambics and is heavy on Persimmon and Kiwi especially, which is fine, their two best in my opinion. It is very fruit forward before going into a nice and clean lactic sour. The flavor is fruit forward too and again heavy on Persimmon and Kiwi with some slight butter, ala California Chardonnay. It drinks light and effervescent (sp?) and is pretty clean with a light and subtly dry finish. Overall I'd say its Upland's finest, behind their Persimmon lambic."
