"Sampled at the brewery's 2014 Quintessence tasting on 1 May 2014."
"What an incredible event! My group of friends were the first to try it!"
"This was a surprise offering at a local restaurant that has been steadily been improving their beer resume.  I enjoyed it with a chicken and Swiss spin on a Philly Cheese Steak.  Yea, sure, that sounds like a misnomer or an oxymoron, but who cars, it was good, and a welcome break from Christmas preparations."

"O - Again, the concept is probably more important than the blend itself. I was extremely pleased with this beer and am very appreciative that it was not for sale. It would of removed some magic from the event to see hoarders line up with their friends and family to collect as many bottles as they could. Everyone at Quintessence was able to sample this wonderful beer, and there was no frenzy to get into the line for this beer."
