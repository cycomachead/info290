"No fruits are needed to make this a great beer. I am astonished by its complexity, based on the beers lower abv. So much going on, while every aspect is artfully integrated in the beers taste, and interacts very well with its overall refreshing character."
"Difficult to detail this Gueuzes, they are nice though."

"This is the first Cantillon I've had and man was I impressed. Smoothest Gueuze I've ever had. I now understand why they're rated so highly."
""
""
""
""
""
"I have to say, this just ain't my thing. Smelled like someone's sweaty old socks. Tasted pretty good, and got better after letting it sit a bit, but I just don't get it with this one (sorry)."

"Funky, fruity nose with traces of of grapefruit, lemon, must, wet wood and wet horseblanket. Pours hazy straw with a very slight copper hue. Very tart over ripe fruit, lemon, sourness, a grapefruit sharpness, hints of pear, oak, and a quinine bitterness on the finish. Reasonably light, effervescent, refreshing."

"O- One of the best gueuzes out there for sure, not necessarily my number one but definitely in the top three."

"Cracked a 2011 with some friends. Loved everything about it - delicate sour flavor, but very smooth and drinkable. This won't smack you over the head, but it's tart and refreshing."

"Birthday bottle at Churchkey. Hazy yellow-gold with a thin white cap. Aroma is tart and funky with some wet hay, apple skin, and a touch of citrus. Taste is sour apple and grapes, funky earthiness, and sugar and citrus sweetness on the swallow. Light body, thin slightly creamy texture, active carbonation, acidic dry finish. Interesting first foray into the champagne of Brussels."

"Strong smell and taste of blue cheese, thin mouthfeel."

"For my taste it's a too much acid beer. I didn't enjoy drinking it"

"I've had some amazing Belgian sours, and amazing American sours while I've waited for this whale to hit a shelf near me. I love it. I see why it's the benchmark and I know I want it every time I'll be able to get it. Funky in a wet hay barnyard way. Fully sour and barrel-ly delicious. I LOVE how it hits you with something epic at every stage and the finish is so enjoyable. Really I love this thing and love how it's influenced so many dope sour brews."
"A fantastically perfect example of what a Gueuze should be. The two clowns who reviewed this beer before me didn't review the beer properly.  Anyway more Cantillon for the rest of us"

"Incomparably outstanding...supremely tart...don't plan on drinking anything else the rest of the day.  Felt like I had 8oz of liquid gold in front of me....I was forced to order another immediately....I feel lucky to have been able to dry this on draft."

"Overall: I am not an expert on this style, but it seems like a very solid gueuze. Great representation"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  I feel like this beer is the sum of its parts, Yes its very sour and has a good amount of funk but combined with the bright aroma and perfect and approachable mouthfeel, it makes this beer fun to drink and you always go back for another."
""
"Overall - Very, very nice. As always, Cantillon delivers. For a straight ahead Gueuze/ Lambic that does not rely on additional flavoring of spices and fruits, this is a work of art and shows that Cantillon is one of, if not THE best brewery making sours today. Simple in its approach, yet somehow resulting in extreme complexity. I have but no choice to age a few of these little babies."

"2013 Belgian Flag label...pours rich yellow urine color...This beer smells amazingly oaky, earthy, & funky.... the taste is a balance of Oak, barnyard funk, and and medium lactic tones giving the tart lemony characteristics...Overall a great Gueuze... sadly i overpaid.... but it was tasty nonetheless..."

"375 ml Belgian flag bottle poured into Cantillon balloon glass. Pours hazy gold with a thin layer of white head that persists through out. The nose is loaded with character. Fresh cut grass and hay come first along with bright lemon zest that cuts through the funk. Speaking of funk, notes of earth and hay linger strongly through out with an obvious tangy ness present as well. Taste starts with huge wave of citric acid, lemon zest, and tartness. The tartness sets the table for the earthy funk. Notes of hay, oak, and cork come through towards the finish with some peppery spice notes. Super complex, different notes come to the front with each sip. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with light body. Overall, a very enjoyable brew. Super funky with a nice dose of tartness as well."

"Overall - Sour and funky like other gueuzes I've had, but this one has some nuances and complexities. Each sip seems to reveal different flavours. Not mind blowing, but one of the best withing the style that I've had."

"Hazy golden hued beer with a wisp of off white head covering just a portion of the top of the beer. Sour apple and pale wheat aroma. Tart apple and pale wheat flavor with a nice light malt backbone. The finish is heavily carbonated and dry. This is a great summer warm weather thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. A pale straw yellow concoction full of fizzy effervescence, including a meringue-like off-white head that disappears quite quickly, leaving a fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is decidedly tart and funky, apple cider and/or rice vinegar with a subtle brown sugar undercurrent. Wonderful. Tons of acetic/tannic fruit but with a subtle sweetness as well. This gueuze wins on aroma alone but fortunately delivers a top-tier experience on the palate as well. Champagne or wine wine-like, with a moderate amount of horse blanket (not overpowering in this regard) and essentially dominated by sour fruit and tannic flavors ... Lemon, unripe pear, cranberry, white grape, green pineapple. Carbonation remains in the background, such that the sour flavors can really pop, and finishes very dry and almost woody with ample lemon and tart green apple skin. If I can say anything negative at all, its that I was looking for something in addition to the tartness ... Perhaps I was looking in the wrong place. Classic gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""

"Moutheel is really good. Easy medium body and a very light carbonation level. Nice lingering flavor. Slightest bit of slightly touching your sweet taste buds and then tart and sour in a natural earthy sort of way. Not overpowering and has a nice clean feel all the way to the finish. Really drinkable. Thank you for the Christmas present from my wife via the BBG! Thanks to both of you. Very nice beer; not exactly my style, but I'd drink it again!"
""
"Gotta love the belgian funk. Some apple sweetness, lemon tartness, you can taste the funk as well. Manages to avoid any off vinegar/acidic unpleasantry. A really well balanced gueuze from the best."

"Bottle surprisingly at World of Beer in Tioga. $20 for a 375 ml was a bit much but oh well. Pours clear deep golden color with nearly no head at all into my champagne flute. Aroma of vinegar, apricots, mint leaves, sour fruits. Interesting aroma. Flavor follows closely with a surprisingly juicy fruit flavor, some sour lacto notes but not super acidic at all, sweet fruits like apricots, and very very light oak. The mouthfeel is fuller than most Geuezes I have encountered. Not dry at all like others and the oaky wood presence is extremely subdued here. Low to medium carbonation. While this was a bit different from others of the style, it was excellent with lots of juicy sour fruity flavor. Highly recommended!"

"O-I need to say that Lambic's aren't my thing. This is the first Cantillon i've had the pleasure of trying and i'm clearly still developing a taste for sours. That being said this was terrific, the sour/tartness created such a crisp and pleasureful beer that was great to drink. I will definitely seek out more!"
""
""

"The nose is sublime for a gueze. Funky and acidic. The flavor is there but note subtle than expected. I was wanting more of a punch. Great beer but this doesn't stand up to Hanssens gueze."

"An expertly blended sour and aged Belgian ale - many flavours stand out, sure, but are best appreciated as a whole. It's like an experience in lambic wizardry - make it sour and funky, and somehow easily drinkable and enjoyable at the same time. Glad to have finally gotten the opportunity to try this one - everyone who thinks that they like 'sour' beers should be afforded the same."

"Pour is golden amber with white head. Nose is soft funk, earthy and a touch of mushroom. Fair bit of apricot and a hint of mineral. Taste follows the nose, earthy mushroom and lots of apricot. Minerally and strong carb with a light creamy body. Some light hops to round out through finish."
""
""
""
""
"Light golden color with head reducing to ring of lacing. Wonderful aromas of fruit - apple, grape, peach - with a slightly sour nose. Taste is fruity rush up front with lemon, apple grape, slightly sweet, almost like a dry riesling, followed by sour notes (both lactic and mild acetic) which dwindle into a dry oaky tannic bitterness. Mouthfeel is inviting with effervescent carbonation over an ever so slightly viscous beer. The flavors combine into a light, flavorful, complex and wonderful beverage. I expected more funk - perhaps that comes with age? A different experience the 3F OG. A bit more refined and lighter on the brett characteristics. Terrific gueuze worth seeking out."

""

"Enjoyed this while on vacation. Was my second time having it and was not disappointed. I guess the only negative would be that everything else I drank on that trip paled in comparison to the Cantillon! Seriously one of the best gueuzes out there. If you have a chance to try it, savor every drop!"

"O: A great and classic example of the style, hence its name. Very drinkable, refreshing and interesting but not as much funk as I would like but I can see why this is a bench mark for the style. This bottle is relatively young so I'm extremely interested to see how it ages. Well worth a try and will continue to snatch this every time I see it. Also, nest time I will serve this slightly above the recommended 50-55 deg f since I thought it improved as it warmed."

"Medium body with soft carbonation and delicate sourness. Tart and puckering with a decent amount of earthy, lactic funk but not harsh or overly acidic. Dry oak/damp wood flavor but not toothpick-like or overwhelming. Some cheesy lactic funk with musty bugs, straw and earthy grass countered by pale malt, bread, ester-y fruit sweetness and citrus acidity. Really well balanced with biscuit-y malt, sourdough bread, sweet apple and tart lemon juice flavor. Lingering acetic vinegar presence in the finish that leaves me salivating for more. No harsh or solvent-like off flavors to be found. Perfectly balanced and extremely easy to drink which is surprising considering this beer's complexity. Just an overall amazing beer. Exemplary for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a top notch gueuze. It's strength is it's incredible balance. Very tasty, great aroma and the right level of sour. Definitely a go-to gueuze for all occasions."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, outstanding. Also comes off as very approachable and drinkable. A classic indeed."
""
"This is a very complex and tasty beer that's not too heavy on the sour/tartness. It's easy drinking, but each sip should be savored."

""

"O. Wow. Super good This ale certainly lives up to expectations. It is very clean and light. The neutral oak is nicely balanced with the medium tartness level. The only draw-back is the burpiness that builds up in ones stomach. If you ever see this or any Cantillon - drink it."
""
"I'm wishing I had a hot summers day to do with this one but I have no complaints even on this chilly evening. I'm a little surprised it took me so long to rate the easiest to find Cantillon but I was bound to get t it sooner or later"
"Wow - Cantillon gueuze never fails to impress. At first the sourness hits you and dominates the experience, but after a while the other flavours make themselves felt. The aroma and flavour are superbly balanced, and the body is wonderful. The only minor flaw was a slight lack of effervescence, but each bottle is different. Quite simply, a world-class brew that demands to be tried."

"The body was light, crisp, sharp, and had a very dry finish. Drinkability was excellent, if you like light, tart, crisp, and dry beverages. Overall, it's hard to imagine the style being done better. Very possibly the standard by which the others are judged. A must try if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a great gueuze, probably the most representative of the style that I've had. Right up there with Tilquin for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As this was a complementary bottle from the owner of The Jeffrey, it may have been even more enjoyable than it already would have been and considering the quality of this beer that is great. Probably one of the most perfect examples of the style in my opinion. It is truly a classic - strong sour flavors but exactly what you would expect for the style."

"Cantillon's classic Gueuze is everything it's modest name implies and more. With a honey-like appearance and a cap of pure white bubbles, it's simply beautiful. It's only minimal haze shows that it is lightly carbonated. It shines radiantly! The sweet aroma reminds one of plums, sour apple, cider vinegar, and a slight 'barnyard' funk. The flavor envelops the drinker in stages... right off the bat, tart fruit esters, like sour cherry and the aforementioned plum wash over the palate, quickly giving way to a funky/yeasty middle and a strong grapefruit/citrus aspect. The mouth feel is slightly wine-like, and seriously has something in common with fresh spring water... it's so very refreshing. The finish mostly acidic and, crisply bitter. Overall, this fine beverage is expertly balanced, probably the biggest remarkable aspect here. Additionally, it's not so harsh going down either, it's rather delicate and drinkable. Cantillon's Gueuze is truly an archetype for the style."
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The scariest thing about a beer this complex is how easily drinkable it is. I could have this in a long session without ever growing tired of it. I'm excited to try the bottled version of this and see how it differs. This really is, terms of basic oude gueuzes, a top quality standard and a real privilege to be able to drink whenever the opportunity arises. Without a doubt one of my favorite sours - I just wish it were more affordable and accessible."

"Served in a little Cantillon glass, the pour is a clearish yellow with a skimpy head that results in some minor lacing. The smell is a juicy, sour melange of hay, melon, grape, green apple, and lemon. Sour, funky flavor, slightly acetic, but not over the top. Lemons, limes, puckering apple, and some oak wood tannins. Dry, tart, and crisp. Just an excellent gueuze that I could have kept drinking for the remainder of the night if money were no object."

"O: This is great. A very interesting sour treat."

"Poured a dark gold, cloudy, body with two finger head that dies slow and left some lace patches down glass. Has a pronounced tart/sour edge, but there are very noticeable traits of spice, funk, fruit smells like apple and pear and grape skinn, kinda like a white wine, and a touch of sweet fruit or sugary malt. The beer is lively thanks to strong carbonation, has a spice and citric hop zip to it, get some sweet notes and some fruit flavors like the tart apple and grape. Besides being filling the mouthfeel is very smooth, beer passes easy, thanks to oakiness and the finish is so crisp yet sweet. Overall, a little bit of everything is in this beer, although don't be confused because the overriding taste sensation is sourness but the balance is great and this is an incredible beer that if you find you need to pick up."

"Got lucky enough to try this before I even knew about Cantillon. This was probably only the fifth or sixth sour beer I had ever tried, but damn it was good. Its too bad its never around. It really made me understand the difference between the American sour experimentation's and a true Belgium gueuze. Im hooked. More, please!"

"1998 vintage 750mL thanks to Turdferguson at RBSG 2011 in Philly. The pour is similar looking to Loerik with a clear to hazy neon peach color and scant white head formation. Nose is completely insane. Just nothing comes close to this one: wild amounts of sour peaches, sweet oranges, fresh grapefruit, and soft sour funk that has no spice or vinegar. Only fresh citrus and unreal amounts of it. Perfect aroma. Taste is leathery and sharp with mild sweat and bitter grapefruit. Excellent, soft, leathery palate. What an insanely amazing treat. If you have ever dreamed about what Loerik tastes like, this is it. They are both 1998 batches and have aged very similarly. Thank you Sam! 6/3/2011 10/4/9/5/18=4.6"

"I'm glad that I tried the Classic Geueze as my first Cantillon beer. It's complexity, balance, drinkibility, and magnificent flavors really make for a world class brew. Definitely the best sour that I've ever tasted. Seek it out."
"Best gueuze that I have had, thus far. Need I recommend it??"

"This is a classic, best example of a geuze. This is a must-try for anyone who likes sours that has not had this yet. I love Cantillons and I think I would take this one just a notch above Drie Fonteinen's Oude Geuze, but its a very close one. I don't usually have to pick one over the other because I'll take whatever I can find here in the US!"

"Pours a lightly hazy dark straw color with a decent sized bone white head that displays moderate retention. The aroma is lemons in your face with a solid hit of grass and hay with a bit of bretty funkiness that lingers and swirls. The flavor is a bit sour with lemons and pomme fruits being dominant. A hint of honey sweetness before a bready bretty yeastiness takes over. Long tart puckering finish begs for a cleanse of the palette which I am all too happy to oblige. Medium body with a tart puckering mouthfeel and a spirited level of carbonation. Great brew, venue, and friends to share the experience with, what more could I ask for."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 3/17/2010. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tart green apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, leather, hay, grass, straw, funk, white vinegar, wheat, and earthy yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast notes with a good amount of barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of big tart green apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, straw, leather, wheat, white vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness. Moderate tart acidity on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, clove, oak, pepper, hay, grass, straw, wheat, white vinegar, funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast ester flavors; with a good amount of oak presence and zero cloying acidity on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a crisp and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a world class Gueuze! All around incredible complexity and balance of flavors and aromas; and extremely smooth to sip on, even with the acidity. Completely amazing stuff as expected."
""
""
"O: A classic gueuze indeed. All the quality and flavors you would expect out of any gueuze are there as well as great drinkability for a sour beer. Obviously a little pricey, but definitely worth the $15-17 for a 750 mL bottle. A must-try for any gueuze/sour lover"

"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Definite A. I have no problem spending 11 bucks for a beer like this. It's a must try unless you don't like sours."
"Overall impression: a mellowed version of the 15 month Lambic with sour and acidic notes toned down. Also with the addition of the 3 year Lambic, it achieves that musty, barnyard flavor that is so desired in a proper Geuze."

"O-This is another solid offering from Cantillon. It is well-balanced and the long finish is pleasingly tart. Although I may not rate it as high as my favorite gueuze, Golden Blend, I would happily drink this all day long if my stomach could handle the acidity."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth the hype I would say, Cantillon makes outstanding beers, and are turning me around on lambics and sours! This is surely one of the finest out there with deft complexity and balance. Definitely one to savour and sip, a very pleasing all-round experience. 4.75"

"D - Great complex and balanced gueuze."
""
"Overall- Excellent as expected. This isn't really any better than 3F or Tilquin offerings, but it has it's subtle differences. Either way, it's world class and worth trying."
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is of a bottle kept at the brewery with fresh tangy element with lightly lactic acidic and not quite puckering sour with nice wood in the taste with light vinous almost white grape tang with no bitterness and semi-sour lemony juicy flavor with mild wood coming throughwith no alcohol in the taste as the flavor is dry when it finishes with a linger tart experience lingering. I loved this it is great to try it in the place where it is produced it just is great in every way-veyr smooth yet has such complexity for so low abv with truly special traditional beer that is better than the majority in the style."
""
""
"Verdict: A wonderful gueuze from Cantillon and one of the finest gueuzes available. I personally prefer the gueuzes from Drie Fonteinen but find that Cantillon makes the superior fruited lambic, but this gueuze is nothing to scoff at, a delight to drink."
""
""
""
"O: This is an amazing gueuze. I prefer the balance in this one compared to the funkier versions brewed up by 3F. Both are excellent though, and I will gladly drink either of them any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While people are going crazy trying to get all the rare Cantillons with various fruits and barrel treatments, I find that the flavor of the classic gueuze is already pretty much perfect. I could drink this forever."

"Waited a long time for this and got a chance when I was least expecting it. Very smooth and flavorful, not funky or overly tart. And yet, not too mild or tame. Just the right amount of sourness and fruits. Great mouthfeel and very satisfying from beginning to end. In fact, it's so smooth and delicious, it goes down too fast. Which is a bit of a problem considering its high price tag. But if you like this style, it's worth trying at least once. Maybe a sharer in the future as a beer appetizer. Superb."
""
""
""

"Overall (4.5), a classic beer and probably the benchmark for the style. It's easy to forget just why it is such a reknowned beer when you've not had it for awhile. I'm glad that I was able to get a pour or few on tap for Zwanze Day, rekindling that old love for this Belgian standard-bearer."

"One of the top 5 wilds/sours I've had. This was a real treat, thanks a ton kawilliams81!"
"There's no wonder why this stuff is so highly praised - it's fantastic. There's truly no recreation or replica of a beer like this. Masterfully done, definitely a benchmark of the classic gueuze style. If this were readily available to me, you can bet that my fridge would be stocked with it all day. I might have a stomach ulcer from all the acid, but it might be worth it for this."

"O - Solid with great balance between the tartness and funk. I thought this was tarter but had less funk that the 3F Gueuze"

"O - Still getting in to the style and this was one of the more enjoyable ones I have had to date."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have yet to be totally blown away by sours, but I'm not going to let two beers characterize an entire style for me (unless it's AALs). I wish there was a little more booze in it, but it's definitely balanced."
"Less sharp, sweeter, better blanced than the lambic. The carbonation really helps with the acidity and makes it much more refreshing."

"OVERALL: This was a step in the right direction for me, but not quite the flavor profile I prefer in a gueuze. There is an attempt at balancing the mouldy, musty flavors with the tartness, which is much appreciated. It is a quality gueuze with a very good feel to boot, but just not quite my style. This mixed really, really well with the Tilquin though, so don't be afraid to give that a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Golden and clear with hints of red-orange and a bubbly head; champagne-esque effervescence. Medium retention. Funky, musty, somewhat sweet aroma. Slightly metallic. Lemon and oak tannins in the taste with a drying sour finish. Very clean and crisp with a lingering presence of tannins and slight pucker. Very nice, but I think I like 3F's better."

"***surprisingly mild for the style. I've had tarter, more sour and funky Gueuze. It was good, but nothing special really. Maybe the 10' I have will be better (this was a 12)"

""
""

""
"Body is medium weight, with very fine carbonation bubbling up quickly to create a smooth and fairly creamy mouthfeel. Closes dry, from acid, with a bit of stickiness around the lips, and with fair burning sensation from acids on the throat."

"Overall: I am fairly new to the style of Gueuze. Had a few and I have enjoyed them. this beer is no exception. I was really excited to see this beer at the Malthouse while pass through Madison on a snowy december night."
"Overall I cannot believe this is the first time I am reviewing this beer but I am not surprised by it's excellent quality. Like most Gueuzes I have experienced the aromas usually outweigh the taste but I think that is just my enjoyment of each aspect of the style. I bet these beers could age for decades and will continute to improve and develop new and interesting funky and sour components. Anyway this was super and I hope to taste older versions down the line."

"O: My first Loon was not a letdown. This is an excellent beer. Probably the best gueuze I've ever had. If only I could drink this one more often. Absolutely delicious."
"Overall: My first fresh loon and it shows. Funk is turned down, but the lactic sourness still shines. Great!"
""
"O – I really enjoyed this but I liked the unblended 2-year lambic much better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Simply stunningly smooth creamy head from my pour that hides the gorgeous pale body of ale beneath it. Laces beautifully and retains rather well. Nose is rich in aromas with sour fruits and barnyard, but barnyard with mostly animal aromas and not so much the stuff that comes out their rear ends that can exist in a barnyard aroma. Palate is decadent with flavor - sour fruits such as peach and lemon, silky smooth carbonation is a joy on the palate too, and more of the barnyard-Brett qualities appearing in an extremely pleasant way. So sour, so tart, and lacking in any substantive flaws. A delight to drink."
""
""
"The classic example of the style. Review bottle was about 1.5 years past bottling date. Cloudy, dull gold colored body; minimal head and retention; no real lacing to speak of. Lemony sourness and prominent oak dominate the aroma and flavor; green apples, moderate lactic notes and bretty funkiness starting to emerge; hints of hay and barnyard characteristics. Moderate wine-like tannins and other similarites, particularly in the prominence of the chardonnay-level oakiness and white grape flavor. Medium-light bodied, medium, crisp-feeling carbonation; clean and bone-dry despite a gentle sweetness in the initial tasting. Slight teeth-squeaking but hasn’t reached an extreme level at this point. Lots of complexity and just plain tasty. Wish I had a case of these to sit on."
"O- One of the best gueuzes you can find, seek this out."
""
"O: Everything I expect in the style. It's difficult to describe these beers but I know its one of the most delicious on the planet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a super hazy orange/yellow with thin white head. Minimal Lacing. Smells of sweet fruits with some barnyard funk. Taste is tart, sour, salty, complex, refreshing. Very drinkable, smooth but rich body, high carbonation. A great meal beer that isnt to heavy and compliments a variety of dishes, maybe a bit over hyped but quite different from a typical AIPA."
""
""
"O: mmm...Cantillon Classic. Everything I thought it would be, and for an amazing price (I think $7 for a 375ml at Whole Foods in SFO). Excellent - could drink this every day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Much like the normal tap version, this was a slightly hazy golden-yellow liquid, served in a stem glass; a small fizzy white head quickly dissipated leaving a few stray bubbles on top. Aroma was distant, hints of barnyard funk, grass, light citrus. Lots of lemon rind in the taste, more bitter than tart, very woody, barnyard funk and horseblanket, moldy cardboard, cobwebs, and stale Champagne; sourness factor was not very high, finish was dry. Somewhat unbalanced. About medium bodied, mellow carbonation. Good for the style, I'm just not nuts about it."
""
"O-my favorite gueuze thus far, nice body and flavor"
"O-I love Classic Gueuze/Gueuze BIO/etc., so I always think its a treat to have. I prefer 3F Oude Gueuze in terms of standard gueuzes, but this is probably a close second. Thanks for bringing this Baron."
"this is a delicious and wonderful example of the style. it appears cloudy and lemon juice colored, with a small white head comprised of big round bubbles the rise pretty aggressively on the pour. acidic citrus peel and tart lactic acid are what i smell, almost stings my nose to breathe this in deeply. the flavor is also very tart, and lemon seems to be the predominant flavor, although some wild sour yeast is also doing its part to keep this tart. its wheaty, but not heavy. the mouthfeel is in fact really light, and if it wasnt so intensely acidic, it might come off as quite delicate really. the carbonation is good, but thats the biggest critique i have with this. i like my gueuze effervescently bright, and this one seems a little flat to me. not flat flat, but just less bubbly than i know the style to be. maybe my bottle wasnt the most fresh, but it lacked that sonic carbonation. overall though, this is, as the label says, the classis gueuze. famous for a reason."
"O - In my opinion, this is the gold standard for the standard gueze style. I can't imagine it getting much better than this."
"Overall, this is probably the best sour I have had to date. The only beer that is close would be Cantillon Iris, but that was aged a year or two more and on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I guess I don't 'get' Cantillon. Take this review with a grain of salt. If you love Cantillon, you'll probably love this too. If you don't, don't expect this to convert you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I know it's the standard for gueuzes, but I'd take Drie Fonteinen any day over this. Not many other things I'd take over it, though. To complain about it is splitting hairs."
"Drinkability – A bit on the sour side for my taste."
"O: The archetype of the style. Wish I could have left it in my cellar even longer, but I couldn’t resist."
"O- This was a very good gueze, however probably not my favorite. I think I actually liked Hannsenn's slightly more then this. It was very drinkable, had a nice light funk to it, and is definitely something I'd like to drink again, maybe a different vintage. I would recommend this to any geuze/sour lover."
"O: Good drinkability. A phenomenal sour. I can see why Cantillon is so sought after. Had this on tap once in Chicago and it's good as I remember it being. Wish I could get this even every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $14 for a 12 oz bottle at the bar, but a 750 ml bottle, if you are lucky enough to find one in a retail store state-side, tends to run $15."

"Overall, a fairly complex sour. Not a beginner's choice. Very tart and dry and refreshing."
"O: This gueuze has a reputation as being one of the best out there, and I can't say anything to contradict that. This is as complex and enticing as any of Cantillon's other products. I can't recommend this one highly enough for fans of sour ales."
""
"A longtime want of mine that surely didn't disappoint!"
""
""
""
"O: Fantastic! I wish I could get a hold of this more often."
""
"Wouldn't be a daily drinker but was obviously a marvelously brewed beer."
""
""
""
"I previously had an longer aged example of this beer which was much more complex. The sourness and funk really jumped out. However, even fresh, this beer is near perfect."
""
""
""
""
"Served from a bottle at the brewery. Poured into a small wine snifter. Smells like the straight lambic with greater depth and stratification of flavor. The depth of cereal grains, cheese, earth, and wild yeast is fantastic, as well as the balance of acids. This is fantastically well done and complex while still being approachable. Not overly sour or harsh, but every bit as wild as it should be. This bears no resemblance to the pasteurized and sweetened gueuze that is too often found of the shelves today. Real, wild, excellent."
"375 ml bottle bottled on 9 march 2011. Pours a slightly hazy light amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is really funky with lots of brett, some horseradish, a light sulfur note, and some earthiness. The taste has a big lactic tartness with lemon, slight horseradish, and lots of funky brett. The finish is tart with earthy brett. Medium body. Low carbonation. Dry throughout. This was drank side by side with a 3F Oude Geuze. I slightly preferred the 3F, but this was still great. I suspect that the slight sulfur note will go away with some age and this beer will get even better."
"O: Tried two days after having Beatification, and the two are comparable in quality. I prefer this one, both because it's a classic and because it's more rounded where the Beatification is sharp."
""
""
""
"T: Hits with a bit punch of sourness with an edge of funk to it. Lemon, a touch of faint spice, sour plum, and some green apple as well. Some hints of wood and earth on the finish. The taste isn't as in your face as some of the other geuzes I've had, but I think I actually like that better. This is really, really good."

"O: A beer for sure. Again, the Euro's just do it better."

"O: It was just very sour but nothing much else. It smelled better than it tasted. This though did not have any distracting taste or smell. I was able to finish the entire the bottle and enjoyed it - but it's not something I will be seeking again."
"O: Really enjoyed this beer, thought it had the best combination of funk/sourness of the group. Would drink this everyday if I could find it..and afford it."
""
"I love the sourness so naturally this is my favorite Geuze."
""
"O - This is a legend. My experience with Sours is limited, but this is right up there with the Russian River offerings, but is very different indeed from those beers. Comparing it to the only eve Gueuze I'd had before, by Lindemann's, this beer is miiles ahead. In spite of the intense sourness and tartness, this beer is still very easy to drink and fantastically delicious. This would be *incredible* with a ribeye with some aged bleu cheese."
""
"Cantillon Gueuze is an an amazingly complex, fantastically balanced and remarkably refreshing beer. Although people usually comment on its intensity, I found my example to be exceptionably smooth and drinkable. I would love to get my hands on another bottle or two for when the warm weather rolls around."
""

""
""
""
""
"o - overall, paint me impressed. yet again, cantillion steps up and backs up their rep. as good or better than other cantillions i've had. seems that if it is from cantillion it is safe to say that it will be tasty. good lemon flavoring with grassiness and hay and a palatable sourness. just wish i had some funky cheese to go with this."
""
"O- This is the bar for a reason. Beautifully done and I'll be trying to get my hands on more of this in the future"
""
""
"O: Some breweries are overrated and overhyped. And I'm not just talking about companies like Dogfish Head, but even the actual good ones - say, Russian River. I like Russian River, and drink their stuff regularly, but they do not deserve the hype (heck, I prefer Cascade Barrel House). Cantillon and 3 Fonteinen really do deserve their hype and their wonderful reviews. The Cantillon gueuze is just amazingly balanced. I can see why some people prefer the 3F (and I love that one, as well), but Cantillon keeps its oak flavor in check, thereby creating a beer that is extremely easy to drink and exposing an array of subtle but interesting flavors."
"A gracious drink. A classic. It doesn't get much better than this. It does, but not by much."
""
""
""
"O - I was looking forward to this and was not disappointed. I’m a fan of sours and I’m trying to get more experience with them. This was a terrific experience. One thing that I love about it is that you could give it to someone who wasn’t familiar with sours and they would never in a million years think that it was beer. It just goes to show you how vast this wonderful world of beers is. Loved this and highly recommend it."
""
"Overall: A complex good tasting beer that within the last 2 years I come upon far less frequently than I like. I could tell myself XXX Gueuze is just as good and readily available but hell, why lie to myself!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Overall, this was my favourite gueuze of the night, but not by much. The appearance hurt it, as did the lack of a really fruity nose. But the oak and dry, crisp clean mouthfeel reall won this one over. Great beer from Cantillon."
""
"This beer lived up to all of my expectations. Very glad that I have one to age."
""
"Could drink this all day (w/some Tums). This is as close to perfect as it gets. Benchmark for the style."
""
""
"So glad to have Cantillon back in IN and to finally be able to snag one of these from the shelf after several dry years. Not as good as their special fruit releases, but still one of the better gueuzes around and pretty good bang for the buck. 4.5"

"Overall: This is a fantastic Gueuze. Very tart and complex. So easy to drink."
""
""
""
"O: I loved this beer. This is my first beer from Cantillon, and I am completely sold. The funkiness and sourness of this beer was unlike anything I have ever had in a beer. A bit of an eye-opener, really. I will be seeking out more sours like this in the near future."
""
"Pours a cloudy orange color w/ a one finger off white head. Excellent lacing on my tulip glass. The nose is a beautiful musty barnyard, lemony smell. Really excellent. The taste steps it up a notch... This is a world class, fantastic Gueze. Unbelievably complex, with different funky tastes coming out. I can't think of one thing I would change about the taste of this brew. Feel is an acidic sharp feel w/ a nice smooth edge to it as well. Overall, this is an awesome beer and I'm glad I got to try it. Cheers."

"Poured from 750ml bottle into snifter glass (bottled March 4, 2011). Pours a cloudy, dark golden orange color with tangerine hues and a one finger frothy white head that slowly fades into a thin ring. Tarty, funky, earthy aroma with some musty, lemon. Acidity vinegary sweetness along with a strong citrus fruit presence. Medium bodied with a tart puckering mouthfeel and dry, tart sourness that lingers throughout into a slightly acidity, sweet vinegary finish. Some oak with a ton of sweet citrus, especially lemon, and a lingering vinegar flavor. A bit too tarty and acidity for me. I can see why this is the tart/sours of all sours. I can respect the style though the style is not my style."
""
"Mouthfeel was light but the mouth puckering sours gently burned my tongue on every sip. Brilliant"
""
"O: Simply put...a rock solid classic. Not quite great (there a better ones out there), but really, really good. Well done (again) Cantillon!"

"Finally got to try this classic Belgian ale. The appearance is very nice, with a golden orange color topped by a eggshell white head and rimmed with generous lacing. The smell is a complex but unified sour funk blast, with hay, funk, earth, apple skin and lemon rind. The taste follows suit, with a fairly harsh sourness that hits the spot nicely. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, and the beer really gets the saliva going. Overall, quite good."

"D/O: Very well balanced with great complexity that isn't overdone.  Tasty, funky, tart, delicious.  I could sip on a few of these all day long.  A great example of the style, but the tartness was just a touch toned down for me.  Fortunately, I have a few more bottles to sit on for a couple years.  Can't wait to try it again down the road. "
"O: A very drinkable, tart gueuze. Absolutely delicious. This beer is a winner."
"overall - just way too sour for me. I've enjoyed other lambic styles, but this is just too much sour."
""
""
"Overall-- this is the measuring bar of gueuze for me. This is the standard by which all others are to be judged."
""
""
""
"Given that stature (and the bottle), I am going to guess that it is Cantillon Classic or Lou Pepe Gueuze. Reveal...Classic Gueuze! Wow! What a fantastic beer. Thanks again Pellinore1!"
"Cantillon Classic pours a remarkably clear orange on the first pour, though subsequent additions introduce some cloudiness. Maybe two fingers of creamy white foam top the beer, and the head lingers around for a little bit. Nothing at all left in the way of lacing though. There's a ton to sift through in the nose. Complex barnyard funk takes the lead. There's also some light white pepper, oak, and a touch of vinegar that serve to keep things lively. The flavor keeps to the spirit of the nose, though the beer's a little bit more tart than the aroma would have let on. The heavy funk, redolent of wet hay, is what leads things off. Oak and pepper then split a mild mid palate flash before the acidity comes in for the finish. The body is supremely dry, and the carbonation is prickly on my tongue, without being overly fizzy. Cantillon Classic is just that, a true classic, and I'm interested to see how one with a bit less age on it compares."

"O: This beer is pretty darn delicious. I feel like you really have to be in the mood for a gueuze to enjoy it. But if you’re going to pick a gueuze to drink, why not pick a this Cantillon."

"A classic brew."
"Had this one during Zwanze Day 2011 while at Holy Grale! Served from tap into a Cantillon taster flute. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, wood, sour apples, and barnyard. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, wood, and brett. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a solid brew. I have had this brew multiple times out of the bottle, but this was the only chance I've had to have it on tap. I have to be honest... This one actually tasted better out of the bottle to me as the funk really carried through more out of them. This was still quite good in aspects of the way. I would love to have a keg or three of this sitting around my house either way. A definite must experience serving method for this one. Now if only I can find it on cask..."
""
"This beer pours a golden yellow with the slightest of orange hues to it. The pour produced a nice one finger white head that lasted a fair amount of time. The smell is slightly barnyard but not overwhelming. There are hints of lemon and fruit that I cannot quite put my finger on. There is also a nice tartness to the nose. The flavor is wonderful with the funk and a hint of oak up front followed by the nice tartness in the finish. This beer is well carbonated and has a nice light mouthfeel to it. Overall I would have to say that this is a Very good gueuze, but I think cantillon produces better fruited lambics."

"Overall Impression- It took me over 600 beers to find but I found it! The perfect 5 out of 5 beer! It could be a 10 out of 10 too if you put it on an even tougher scale. If you get a chance, get your hands on this and let it age. I'm going to be searching far and wide for this and wouldn't mind buying 2 or 3 to enjoy once again and then age the other two! Not one category in this had any flaws... How could this be? Really appreciated the lemon flavors and how real this one was! Highly, HIGHLY recommended! Don't worry about the price on this one, it will be worth your buck."

"D - It's not as complex as some of the others but the taste is quite good. Unabashed and refreshing."
"mouthfeel -"
"O: A great sour that is a good accompaniment to a fine dining experience."
"O - simply superb."
"O: I love everything Cantillon does, and this is no exception. This is the gueuze every other gueuzes should be compared. This is damn near perfect."
"O: Great lambic beer...not too sour in it's finish...it's tart through the whole experience but it gets pushed through the mouth pretty rapidly due to the high carbonation so it doesn't linger. Very, very well done wild sour. Need to find some more Cantillon beers...this was fun to drink."
"incredibly drinkable. i could drink this all day if only i had good alcohol tolerance. damn my asian genes. prefer this to hanssens geueze although i would love to drink both"
"This was one of the European bottles with the blue and white labels. Light gold into the Cantillon tulip. Aroma is musky, dank, like a sweaty horse! A lemon tree and a summer field. The flavor is sharp and sour, lemon peel and dirt from a farm. I love that horse sweat part of it that's much stronger than in other traditional gueuze. Very well done gueuze, crisp and light but very complex. One of the better Cantillon offerings and much preferable to Drie Fontienen or Girardin to my taste."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: As with earlier examples of this style I’m finding Cantillon’s gueuze very drinkable. As each sip fades I’m ready to take another to see how well balanced and complex the mix of flavors is. My overall impression is that the reputation of this beer, the Brewery, and the head brewer is well deserved. As I’ve gained more experience with the style I’ve grown to understand just what a treasure Cantillon beers can be. Nice to know I’ve got some of this that I can hold onto for a while so as to taste and smell the changes that take place with bottle age."
"I very much enjoyed this beer and will have it again."
"O: I had no idea what to expect from this beer and it was very enjoyable. The unique flavor achieved creates a crisp refreshing that is perfect any time of year."
"Overall: This is a very nice gueuze. Sour and funky in a nice balance."
"Definetely the best I've had, not that I've had many of these. Much more than just a sour apple jolly rancher dissolving in red wine vinegar like the Jacobins Rouge I had. A lot going on in the one I had."
"The taste is dry and sour to start very sour it becomes fruity like fresh apples and finishes with more of a cider sour apple taste"
"Pours a hazy golden orange. Almost no head. Smells earthy and funky. Lots of armhouse dirtiness. Tastes sweet and tast. Not overly sour but definitely funky. Overall well carbonated but isn't quite doing it for me. Perhaps I'm not a Gueuze person"
"Pleasant barnyard with hints of fruit on the nose, and a very tart flavor with funk in the background. A gueuze with wonderul contrast between the nose and taste. Glad I got to try this one on tap."
"750 ml capped and corked bottle. The cork says this was bottled in 2010, the bottling date on the bottle is smudged but it looks like it says 17 March 2010. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is decent, not much lacing. Aroma is very nice, it's tart and musty. The brew smells like funk, tart apples, lemon peel, and some hay. For the most part the taste is just like the aroma, but there's also some white grape and oak flavors noticable, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium with moderate carbonation. It's also dry and very easy to drink. I think this is a pretty good beer and would buy it again the next time I come across it. At $13.99 a bottle, it's definitely worth the money."
"O-good beer. Can't wait to see what this does with age."
"The feel is light and crisp. Overall this one is the bar for the style in my opinion."
"This is a very good gueuze. The balance is great, making this a very pleasant, even refreshing, drink. Lots of complexity paired with nice balance."
"D- Overall, this is a must-have for anyone looking to try a good gueuze. Bright, refreshing, and complex at the same time."
"It's a good gueuze but as my first cantillon experience I'm a bit let down. The body is a bit lacking as is the flavor profile. Recommend Drie Fonteinen any day over this."
"O: Nice underlying beer but I prefer the funk/sour balance of other geuzes."
"Overall: Good sour beer, no fruit flavors or other additives."
"O - The best beer I've ever had from the 1990's. This was just so impressive, I was in awe. A well-respected BA at this tasting said this one reminded him of Loerik (which I haven't had). This just shows how excellent Loerik is. Outstanding!"
"Drink- A long time want of mine. Was very happy to finally be able to have this one."
"Overall- Mmmm, good way to end things here. You can tell that there probably was some more fermentation that could have happened in the bottle (from the youngest added lambic), but still delicious."
"D - A lovely, well rounded gueze. Cantillon hits the mark with barnyard notes more than others IMHO."
"A definitive version of the style. A classic. Just about perfect."
"Great beer!"
"Bottle. Gold pour with white foam. Strong lambic funkiness immediately finds its way to my nose as I’m pouring. Aroma has strong notes of wet hay, leather, brett, classic farmyard gueuze funk and cheesy aromas from the aged hops. Taste is very sour, no sweetness really, some old hop flavors but mostly sharp. Palate is what makes these beers a wonderful experience for me. Highly carbonated and dry, it is super refreshing. A great classic."
"Pours a deep golden color, with a decent fizzy head. Aroma is sour as expected. The nose of this fine ale is a little funky, featuring soured lemon, barnyard, musty basement, work socks. In the taste, solid sourness, lemon, oak, funk. Very champagne-like only with a puckering sour note. Full rounded flavor, hits every sour taste bud and makes them beg for more. Mouthfeel is dry, light, crisp. Overall, a fantastic Gueuze."
"Pours a hazy hefeweizen orange with slight sunset crimson tints, no head to speqk of and very lightly carbonated. 2010 on the cork. The nose carries overipe melon, bright acidic citrus, barnyard funk, a touch of rancio wraps up the nose. The taste nd mouthfeel is pure mputhpuckering sour with sour patch kids bringing a slight sweetness, citric acid, along with a dash of red fruit, and almost a wild, feral quality to the beer. Light in abv and carbonation, ate it with spicy food that was a poor match leading to terrible heartburn. A very good sour unfortunately my palate just does not understqnd them yet."
"Poured at something like 50 degrees, it wasn't as wild as it might have been at room temperature. That said, I like my beer, even Gueuzes, a little bit chilled, and the sourness was right where I wanted it. Had on a hot summer's night, this beer had a reallly refreshing, full-bodied farmhouse funk. Just perfect for the conditions. This is my new Gueuze to beat. Can't wait to find it again."
"O: Amazing balance, very drinkable and smooth."
"This isn't something I normally order but since Jen at the Trapp Door drove all over for it I figured I would give it a try. This beer has a good amount of pressure in the bottle, right after the cap was removed the cork started coming out on it own. With a little help of a cork screw it was poured into a wine glass. It had a bubbly golden color to it, very clean and clear looking. The smell was vibrant with funk aromas that I could smell before it was even placed in front of me. The taste of the beer is nice and tart with some funky flavors going on. The mouthfeel was also pretty nice, very drinkable. Overall I found it to only be harsh on the first sip, after that it got much better and easier to drink. Good stuff for sure."
"O: 5% ABV? Seriously? I could drink this all day and night. I polished off the 750ml with no problem whatsoever. That it was aged from November 2008 probably only added to the beauty and complexity of this beer. Stunning."
"-Cheers"
"Overall, I am very pleased with this one. I was expecting a little more complexity in to come through, but the simplicity doesn't take anything away from the brew. Its fantastic and leaves me wanting more Cantillon."
"O - Overall, another good one from Cantillon. One of the best breweries out there."
"O: Don't feel its the best execution of the style and there was more vinegar than I'd like, but it's still very refreshing to drink and everything that it offers comes in top quality form."
"O: Very good for style and very easy to drink"
"O - This just surpassed Drie Fonteinen oude as my favorite gueze. This is such a well crafted beer that was worth the wait."
"Poured into my bruery tulip. Pours golden with a foamy 1 finger head that stays. Aroma of Brett, lemon and a little funk In the back. Taste is tart, cidery, lil funky and delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Very drinkable! Overall this is amazing, great sour flavor with high drinkability."
"O: One of the best I have ever tried. Definitely worth trying and I continue to drink this whenever I can find it. Damn well brewed"
"O - Really interesting bottle this go round. A lot more sour than previous tastings, which I'm enjoying a great deal. When I think of Cantillon Classic Gueuze, I think more delicate, refined tartness and exceptional complexity, but I love any iteration of this beer. Cheers,"
"D- I could drink this all night and day!!!"
"2010 vintage. Pours very bright with a nice lasting head. Smell of the classic cantillon aroma, but more subdued. Funk, citrus aromas of grapefruit and apples. Great mouthfeel, not super acidic, more on the balanced side with the sweetness. I could drink liters of this stuff."
"This is the best geuze I have had. The funky, sour, and crisp refreshing notes are in perfect harmony. A good beer for a hot afternoon."
"O- Solid quality gueuze, im just expanding into the sour category and I was not disappointed with this beer. Very funky, and sour, as well as refreshing."
"O- its called classic for a reason and its one that neer let's me down. Jean can blend a damn gueuze can't he. I love it what else can I say."
"Overall an excellent beer, cant wait to try the other Cantillon offerings that I have sitting in my cellar."
"The aroma was strong, pungent and very sour. Ahh the lovely aroma of Brett in full force here. Pungent aromas of grapes just all over this one. A nice fruity vibe as it warms, with hints of peaches, and apples, light fruit in general were all lying deep underneath, however the real story was the gorgeous amounts of sour notes that were all over this one. Really quite beautiful. The flavor followed along perfectly. With a light airy body, this was an ideal beer for the evening. Lots of carbonation and an increasingly complex profile just really lit it up. There was the undeniable taste of Bret rippling through it, providing me with the great sour taste, but below that lots of peach and pear flavors were increasingly poking their heads around, letting you know there were there as well. A nice light grain flavor made up the base and kept things from getting out of control. There was an nicel ong drawn out finish that really tightened things up nicely and left a good fresh grass and sour grape flavor in your mouth for a good long time. The drinkability on this one was superb, with a deep flavor profile, that was just light enough to be enjoyed all night."
"Overall this is one of the best geuzes out there. I definitely have trouble describing the geuzes, but I can tell you this one is delicious!"
"Finish: Explosive, complex and surprising. It ends a bit dry but with plenty of flavor. An amzing beer,"
"D - For a gueuze, very very drinkable. With each sip I couldn't wait for the next one. It was so refreshing and just damn tasty. I will seek this one out again!"
"Overall, this is quite the treat and I'm so glad to finally have opened my bottle. The Cantillon tumbler makes it even more of an experience, and I can't wait to enjoy more Cantillons with it."
"2006 cork date, so I guess it's a 2004 bottle? Yellow and black label with the drunk guy on the chair. Drinking this right after a 2009 Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Pours a mostly clear apricot orange sort of color with a medium head. Less spritzy and a touch darker than the Fonteinen. Nose is immediately more sharp and less minerally than the Fonteinen. More lemon, more funk. Somehow chewier in the nose, as weird as it sounds. Flavor is massively funky, urine, manure, mushroom. Way more flavors going on than the Fonteinen, not all of them pleasant. Despite all the crazy funky oddities of this it works pretty freakin well. On the opposite end of the flavor spectrum from the Fonteinen. Cantillon is way more earth, fungus, digestive like, while Fonteinen is toward the champagne, mineral, lemon end of the spectrum The Fonteinen is actually more dry in my opinion. Both fantastic. As this one opens it's sublime."
"375 bottle. 2009 release. Poured a light, clear, yellowish golden color. While there definitley was carbonation, there was very little head on this one. Aromas of musty grapes, barnyard, citrus, grass, and so much of the great Cantillon sour. On the palate, tons of acid and funk with flavors of citrus, grapes and yeast. Extremely tart, sour and funky on every sip. This is truly classic gueuze and near the top of my list for best gueuze."
"I wish I had gotten another matching bottle to compare to in a years time. This was fantastic"
"o - this lambic is a killer."
"Notes: Flavors are smooth and sharp and lacking anything 'off'. Complex."
"O: What else is there to say about this world class beer. So complex and delicious. I could drink this all day. To my surprise my dad loved it. Looks like Cantillon has another fan now."
"This is a delicious beer. Like nothing I've ever tasted before. Very crisp, very dry, and sour, but without any mouth-puckering or sharp notes. It has some characteristics quite similar to a medium-dry white wine. Look forward to drinking it again."
"It's a good gueuze. I feel like it has the classic Cantillon acidic intensity that drowns out the other characters, but this one is tempered more than most, giving the nice funky basis. Nice."
"SkÅL!"
"Pours a deep honey orange color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small chunks of lacing around the glass on the drink down. A very tart and sour vinegar smell, apple peels, and funk/must. The first sip of this beer gave me a mouth puckering chill. Sour vinegar, tart lemon, apple skins, and musty and funky earthiness. This beer says it was aged in oak barrels but I don't get any woody aspects whatsoever. Very light but pronounced carbonation make for a clean and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good gueuze and my beer ever from Cantillon. This is the first bottle of Cantillon I have ever seen in the Los Angeles area and the last bottle in the store. I didn't think twice about snatching it up and I am very glad I didn't. A very tasty beer indeed."
"It was pale golden, sour and dry. Definitely more like wine than what you would expect from a typical beer. Incredibly complex, vinous, sour, apple, funk, softer and more complex than you would expect. Wonderfully strange to someone used to ""regular"" beers."
"O: I've not had many gueuzes, but this is the best so far. Complex and smooth with just the right amount of sourness."
"It's likely because this is a new bottle, but I was expecting it to be more complex. It doesn't taste much different from other gueuzes I've had. I guess I should have bought another one to age."
"(750ml bottle from rayl101!). Pours hazy golden color with white head. Good carbonation. Aroma is funk, cobwebs, green apple, and some light berries. Taste is sour with a little funkiness and some vinegar. Thin bodied with a slick mouthfeel. Finish is quite dry, yet its quenching. A very solid beer that is easy to drink, especially on a warm day (as it is here now)."
"There's no doubting this year-round Cantillon offering is a good beer and a solid Gueuze, though I can't help but feel a bit let down. The flavors are nice but their lack in diversity, or something to just make it stand out, is an upset."
"Cork showed early signed of blue mold. (not the first time from Cantillon)"
"D: The drinkability was fabulous and like the label says this is a ""Classic Gueuze"" which I can drink all day."
"Unfortunately I was pressed for time (and over-zealous about this beer) and drank this too quickly. Try and have some restraint, this beer can only benefit from it. She waited upwards of 3 years for you. You can wait a few minutes for her. The seduction is all the more inviting for your patience."
"Lighter spritzy body, dry and lingering on the palate but inherently refreshing. Pleasant throughout, super tasty, delicious mesh of scent and taste from top to bottom. Another bullseye from Cantillon."
"o - so thankful to have gotten this. this is one of the best gueuze ive had and leads me to believe the vintages have got to be totally bangin. i have another one thats gonna be sittin in my 'cellar' (fridge) for a lot longer than i was planning. this is an exceptional beer."
"This is indeed a classic gueuze. Easy to drink, but funky and sour enough to always make everything interesting. A great effort."
"Overall, this is my favorite gueze to date. Unbelievable well balanced and perfectly tart. Manages to tow the line between being refreshing and complex incredibly well. I will definitely be seeking this out again."
"Won't you take me to funky town....Gotta love the Gueze! 100% Lambic aged in oak barrels. Aroma is pretty mild yet so so pleasant and full of anticipation. Taste is VERY tart and acidic. Green apple tartness on the cheeks. I'm going to stop the train, sit down on the tracks and drink this all day long."
"D-Very refreshing and a very nice example of gueuze. I would love to try this again, if it only were a little bit more reasonable in terms of price."
"O: One of the best brewery ""flagship beers"" on the market."
"What is not to like about this beer. If you want a fantastic lambic look no further."
"Mouthfeel is a fantastic meld of crisp smooth lightness and puckering sour acidity. The two go together very well, and the carbonation is a fantastic side-kick to the tartness, adding a lively nature. Drinkability is phenomenal for how strong the flavors are. The enamel-destroying acidity in the mouthfeel hinders the ability drink large quantities of this at one time, but I had no problem putting down a bomber of this in about a half hour. My first taste of Cantillon will not be forgotten, and I now understand the fever people have for this brewery."
"overall, a top notch gueze. for all i know, the best of the best. im very glad i got the oppertunity to try this beer, as with any cantillon. they are truly artists of there craft. highly recommended."
"This is pretty straightforward and fun drinking. This beer could pair with some food I think to make it interesting, but it also surprisingly good just on its own. It's very tolerable and goes down easy like nothing."
"D- This is not for the unintiated to the Gueuze style, its delicious nonetheless, low in abv with a light body and endless complexity making it a constant journey of taste."
"not a lot of words to be said about this one, but that's how I feel with most gueuze or wild beers. it's simple and clean, but maintains all of what you would expect. a very nice offering."
"Taste is tart grains, but manages to be oh-so soft. Big brettanomyces presence, but still plays second fiddle to the sourness. So damn delicious, I could drink one of these every single day. Light fruitiness, rubber is still there. I could see this aging with the best of 'em. Pretty complex, despite leaning heavily towards the sour end of the spectrum. Just an amazing beer."
"can't believe I haven't reviewed this before... i've tried it in just about all it's incarnations; fresh, aged, etc. always a winner. this review is for a ""freshie"". 2010 bottling. anyways, here goes: beautiful dark golden color with a white head that holds better than most of it's counterparts. nose is mainly citrusy, minerally, earthy (almost grassy sometimes), funky and woody. sounds simple, but there really is a lot going on here, and it all rings out in masterful harmony. just divine. taste is round and creamy with a shock of acid that amplifies everything. very citrusy with notes of cobweb, rushing springtime brook, wet rock, fresh grass, fruit and a bit of spice in the finish with a touch of oak. mouthfeel is a soft and light medium body with minimal prickliness and bracing acidity. truly one of the great masterpieces of the brewing world. this beer is full of soul. it is refreshing, lively, complex and contemplative. beautiful. always a joy to drink."
"D- One of the best sours i've had to date. A great beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
"D. Very good and highly drinkable"
"D: Really had to restrain myself from drinking this one too quickly; absolutely nothing stopping it from going down. Looking very forward to the next time I have a chance to try this beer."
"Bottle. Cork date of 2009 so this is a really young one. Cork opens with a nice pop. Poured into a tulip glass a clear, only ever so slight haze, apricot orange color with a 1 finger lace white head that quickly settles to form a slight collar around teh glass. The aromatics include; white fruit notes like pear, apple, and grape, definitely some barnyard funk, and hay. Carbonation dances on the tongue with a light mouthfeel. Not overly sour but its there along with a funky floral flavor all balanced with some sweetness and a slight bitter in the end. End semi-dry and clean. For the price and availability, this is just great."
"D- I found this one to be pretty good. Not quite sure how often I could drink this one but wouldn't turn it down."
"D: This beer is absolute in it's drinkability. Outstanding."
"Light on the tongue with tart berry notes again and light hints of vinegar. Carbonation lends a solid distribution on the tongue and provides a relatively full feel for the light ABV. Touch of sweetness on the finish balances the tartness well. Easy drink but not overwhelming in flavor dept., being quite pleasant though a bit more uniform than anticipated."
"This is my second favorite regular production gueuze in the world."
"Drinkability: The low abv makes this one easy to consume if you like this style...and i do love this style! Bring me more because I can't get enough....too good to pass up...plus you know it's good when it has a cork in it!"
"This beer was my very first Gueze, so I must admit, knowing there was sour gave me some apprehension in drinking this. The appearance is a hazy golden color with a coarse white foam. The aromatics were a touch funky with a smell of some decent skinned pinot noir grapes. The flavor had a very champagne like flavor. The carbonation wasn't as strong, but the grape flavor was right there. The mild tartness worked interestingly with the grapes. There was a salty background to the taste. It was pretty easy to drink once I got used to the flavor. A good Gueze, now I need to figure out why the top tier ones are so sought after."
"That guy on the label's gonna have a bad time real soon... Meanwhile, his beer pours a lightly hazy straw topped by a solid finger of white foam. The nose comprises lemon wedge, coriander, sour wheat, white grapes, Brett, and some nice funky funk. Word. The taste really emphasizes those sour notes, particularly lemon, orange peel, and Brett. It's all pretty tart, but nothing o'erwhelmingly so. The body is a hefty-feeling light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, rather sticky finish. Overall, a very nice gueuze, though not really something I can see drinking too heavily during a day."
"The CPJ"
"Drinkability: Gueuze is certainly an interesting and unique style. I have a hard time with some of these unique Belgian styles comparing them to anything other than champagne. All in all, that's what really describes this beer: sour, citrusy, champagne. It's definitely good and definitely worth a shot but don't expect ""beer-beer"" when you drink it."
"I must admit it is a well crafted brew, of course. Marked down a little on drinkability only for my inexperience. I wouldn't be able to drink this often, but it will be a rare treat."
"The thing about a good gueuze is that it's both uncomplicated and super complex at the same time. Layers of earth, funk, and downright sour goodness. Sticky, good carbonation, nice lacing...and just writing about it is making my mouth water all over again. Can't wait to get my hands on more."
"I have to admit that I have just become interested in sour beers in the last year or so. From what I've had, Classic Gueuze is definitely a top-tier lambic. There is really nothing negative I can say about this beer."
"EDIT: Wow, had it on tap, pure awesomeness, just like the bottle."
"Opinion: All I really can say is ""Wow!"". Gueuze is my favorite style, but I would have to say that this is probably my second favorite one. I would still take a Girardin 1882 Black Label Gueuze over this one, but I am just splitting hairs to do so. This is a more ""True"" representation of the style, IMO. This beer is so wild that you are forced to drink it slowly...which is not a bad thing. I prefer to regulate myself, not be regulated by a beer, but this beer is worth it. Girardin is a bit more approachable up-front...but I am really enjoying the all-out onslaught to the senses that you get with this beer. I would have to say that if you can afford it, and can take it, drink this as regularly as you possibly can. These beers are a beautiful slice of history and you can only keep them around by buying their products and making sure the bills are paid at the Ole Brasserie. I am not trying to give a lesson in the economy of beer, but this beer and the legacy that goes with it is THAT good."
"Tasty, complex, balanced gueuze. Very nice stuff."
"D:really one of my favorite gueuzes available and is tastier everytime I have some."
"D - Usually it's tough for me to finish a Gueze by myself, the acid just gets to be too much. That's not the case here. This is a wonderful treat, I can't wait to try some with a bit more age on it."
"Drinkability- this particular gueuze was not overly funky and quite refreshing. I could drink several of these in a sitting no problem. The only draw back is price. But you only live once so what the hell."
"Great beer, but I personally enjoy it with more age. After 2-3 years in bottle, it really hits its stride."
"D - For a gueuze, very very drinkable. With each sip I couldn't wait for the next one. It was so refreshing and just damn tasty."
"D. Nice and easy drinking. Had this on tap but the bottle was just as good. Great beer."
"The sour character gets a little overbearing as I go. The tiny glass I had is definitely enough."
"Pours a light golden color with a quickly dissipating, effervescent, white head, some nice lacing and beautiful bubbles in the glass. Smells warm, yeasty and musty. Sour, citrusy, acidic flavor with a very champagne like mouth feel. This is the first Gueuze I've had and I really enjoy it."
"D: One of the best brews I have had in a while. I have been on a hops hiatus and the sour world has been a pleasant surprise!"
"Only the second gueuze I've ever tried, but I'm hooked. I would like to try some more Cantillon offerings... if only they weren't so hard to find."
"D: The sour flavors are strong, but do not completely overpower the taste and make this an interesting beer to sip. It's relatively easy to drink for the style."
"This beer is very tart so you can either just drink it down like a child getting into his Halloween candy or you can sit and sip it because it's over powering. That's the two options here. I fall to the latter category. It's sort of frothy and kind of thick, which is good. If this had a thin body I would be severely disappointed with the experience. Having a strong enough body to carry this bold, tart flavor is key to making this a successful beer. Jesus."
"D: Great. I would pair this with any dinner, or even cook with it to extract all the flavor."
"Finally got to try this beer! Once popping the cork I got a nice whiff of delicious barnyard funk. Appearance is cloudy golden with small white head. Scent is a lot of lemon with amazing sour fragrances... A bit of floral notes as well with some great funk and oak. Taste is amazingly sour, which I love!!! Initially, I get tartness with great oak flavors, quickly followed by mouth-puckering sourness. Then I just get some great flavors or bread, flowers, and other citrus notes. A little bit of bitterness at the end with more oak. Delicious beer!!! Mouthfeel is almost perfect...very full bodied and crisp. Mouth-puckering sour queuze. Drinkability is very high for me...as long as I can find it somewhere and my stomach can handle the amazing acidic features of this world-class brew!"
"Drinkability - Quite so. A very easy to drink Gueuze and I can't wait to have some more. Glad I have some in the cellar."
"A very easy to drink geuze, and a good option to introduce people to this style who may not have tried it before."
"The mouthfeel is light and very refreshing. Nice carbonation makes for a relatively crisp feeling. This is highly drinkable for those who love the style."
"Poured from 2009 375ml bottle into Cantillon long stem glass. Color is a clear golden with a small white head that fades to a collar. Smell is very typical Cantillon - lots of funk, lemons and bright citrus, pineapple, one of the fruitier smelling lambics I have had. Taste is sour and acidic up front, but as the initial harsh flavors subside there is a lot of fresh lemon and tropical fruit, slightly metallic. Mouthfeel is medium/light body with a light but active carbonation and a dry finish. An excellent Gueuze, one of the best around. I am rarely disappointed with any Cantillon beers."
"Probably the most smooth and drinkable of the style i have had to date. the subtle oak really rounds out this delicious gueuze."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and intensely sour brew. Cantillon has yet to produce a disappointing brew, and this is another fine example of a well done beer. I wish I had more than one in my cellar...guess I need to make a beer run after the holidays."
"Pours a hazy light amber color with a thick white fizzy head and no real lacing to mention. Smells of wet hay, musk, some apple, and funk. Tastes a bit funky, with some apple, plenty of sourness and lots of lemon depth. Mouthfeel is medium with a carbonation that is just right. Drinkability is high."
"I knew the second I corked this beer that it was something special. The smell was yeast and bitter apple (reminded me a of a good champaign). The color was beautiful golden honey. First drink threw me off a bit, but after that is was heavenly. It's unique, well balanced, bitter sweet. Absolutely an amazing beer."
"Pours honey to light amber color. Puffy white head with dense bubbles and fair lacing. Aroma of lemon, straw, and lots of wet hay. Nice typical geuze smell. Taste is peppery and lemon up front, nice sharp dry and tart middle, sour, faint oak notes through the front and middle. The bretty and hay aroma present in the nose is muted slightly in the flavor profile. Super clean ending. Mouthfeel is slightly chamgane like, really drinkable and pleasant."
"D - This is a very good sour beer. I really think it is one of the best that I've had yet."
"All in all I really enjoyed this one. I've opened 3 bottles in the last month and everyone that has tasted them had good things to say. These bottles were a lot more tart and dry than more recent examples I have tried. I was honestly blown away. Very good stuff."
"Drinkability: Definitely gets better when brought closer to room temperature. Would not want to drink more than a bottle at a time, but that can be a good thing with beers this complex."
"Mouthfeel is thin, just about one step lower than a champagne with lesser carbonation. I'll gladly drink another bottle of this, not cause it's Cantillon, but it's incredibly refreshing and delicious. Definitely would recommend this to someone trying to foray themselves into the sour territory."
"Thin in body and moderately carbonated, this drinks fast. An extremely high attenuation allow this to finish nice and dry. Very quickly, the glass disappears and I'm hearing cries from the other bottle I have in my possession calling to me. I'm hoping to let it fester until the 2 year mark but oh boy...its going to be tough. Definitely seek this guy out!"
"Drinkablility: This is a great drink. This is absolutely wonderful."
"I will admit that after reading the reviews, I was a bit worried this would be too sour, but this was not the case. I found it to be very refreshing and enjoyable for my first gueuze."
"d - The drinkability of this beer is amazing, and probably it's best trait. The fact that it is only 5% ABV makes it very easy to drink. While it is very sour and tart, it is not insanely lip pucking like some others, which also helps the drinkability and makes finishing a bottle alone easy. I also loved the smell; would definitely buy this one again."
"T: Very sour and slightly fruity. Some citrus. Very very dry and slightly astringent. Finishes with raw apple and white grape notes, as well as some earth and must. Vinous."
"M - light and clean with more carbonation than I initially would have thought."
"D - this is a very tart beer that was my first true sour. I really enjoyed this beer. Very bold flavors that eventually destroy your palette. Although I couldn't have more than a 350ml bottle, I really enjoyed it throughout."
"Overall- For my first gueuze this went very well, maybe to well! First of all these beers are expensive and I think I am in love, second this went down incredibly quick, I need to teach myself to slow down and really enjoy this!"
"Drinkability is a little lower, maybe not for the style, but at the end of the bottle i was struggling a little from all the sourness."
"This is very interesting. It is very tart and flavorful. It is also very acidic."
"M/D - Light body with an ultra sour finish. The intensity of the sourness makes it a definite sipper but complex enough to come back for another drink. Always a pleasure to enjoy such an exotic, ""out there"" beer style."
"The taste is a little young. Mouthfeel is a little viscous for the style. Strong lactic sourness clenches the jaw on the first sip. The front of my tongue feels numb for a second after a few more sips. Bleu cheese, leather and a little woody flavor is present. The lactic acid plays off the brett exceptionally well. If anything too well. This Gueuze is drinkably offensive. Lively carbonation lifts this beer off the palate leaving a lingering sourness. This isn't as quite as dry as I'd like it to be yet. I still think the brett has to eat through some more residual sugars. The beer sweetens as it warms and the palate gets fatigued."
"All in all a good gueuze. Not my favorite as it is very traditional, somewhat plain. A good jumping off point for sours I suppose."
"D- Next time I buy a big bottle I will find someone to split it with because it was overwhelming having a big bottle in my first tasting. I really did enjoy this and felt that it opened a door to styles I have not tried yet. I have not had many sour beers and just opened me up to a whole new world of beer."
"D: This is the benchmark Gueuze for me and one that all others are compared to. A brew that truly has refined the style. And it also drinks like water,.. mmm so refreshing."
"from a 12.7 oz. bottle it poured a dark yellow color with lots of bubbles and a fresh filmy white head that dissipated ..smell was sour funk and hay with lemon and earth smell..taste was lemon/fruit tart with some oak and a sour barnyard finish..mouth feel was tart and crisp ,dry and smooth on the palate..very drinkable but more tart than sour,as it warmed it just got better and better..very enjoyable"
"A well above average gueze."
"Overall, for something this sour, this is actually going down very easy. Only 5% helps, but there is so much more. This was $9 for 12 oz, so this won't be a regular thing, but this is something I will pine away for. Fine brew."
"D: Highly drinkable, nice ABV makes it more drinkable for me and very refreshing. I'm getting this whole sour thing now."
"An impeccable gueuze. Simply delicious, and satisfying."
"D - I could definitely drink more of these. This is one of the best guezes I have had."
"D- Still getting used to drinking sours. But this is a pretty good beer."
"D: One of the best and most consistent gueuzes out there. I could drink this by the case."
"Strong bodied pronounced sour but smooth taste. The arome i taste of natural cider, is very earthy and fruity all at the same time. I realy like that type of beer. I hope to taste more of these beers."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a slight head but reasonably lively carbonation. Smells funky like a ripe washed rind cheese- definitely in the smelly socks direction, but strangely, in a good way, and somewhat restrained. Acetic as well. The taste is clean, lemony, sour and a little on the thin side, but finishes with some nice clean funkiness. Smooth, a little wonky, and refreshing. Nice, classic gueuze."
"M/D: It is very bitter and sour, but crisp and clean all at the same time. I could finish one bottle, but that is all I can handle in a night. I would make this an endcap to an evening."
"D - Not an every day, not a session, but pretty tasty."
"This beer is one of the more sour and acidic Gueuze's that I've tried, comparing it to others such as Girarden or Oude Beersel. I had it with garlic mussels(with no Frites) too bad. Next time I'll have to be better prepared."
"Drinkability: The first Cantillon lambic I had was very, very dry and overly sour- this one is still very dry and very sour, though more complex than the other. Even if you don't like unblended lambics, gueuze may be the way to go. I like this beer, and it is a shame that I don't have proper cellaring space- this beer (like champagne) seems great for a celebration, such as a wedding or the new year, etc. When I get some cellaring space, I'll buy a few bottles of this to put away for later."
"This is another impressive Cantillon, sharp and acidic, very refreshing. Highly recommended."
"D: One of their flagship beers, Cantillon classic geuze is everything you'd expect from this brewery. Tart, lively, complex, and super drinkable. In addition, this one's sure to evolve with age. A definite must try for anyone who's into sours."
"D - Delicoius and interesting. For my first sour I think it was a good choice even though Gueuze's tend to be the most intense ones. For someone has been deep into the bitter side of beer (hophead) this is a nice eye-opening beer."
"D: I know this beer can age well, but if it gets drier and more acidic, it will probably move further away from my sweet spot. Right now it seems to be ""just right"" when young. Quite drinkable, maybe a bit on the sipper side, and it's very tasty."
"Looks a nice grapefruit/straw color, Translucent and pretty. Nice sour smell, grapes and peach. Tastes like sour grapes and peaches too. the mouth feel is medium, a really nice beer to sip on. A highly drinkable sour beer. A nice blend of young and old lambics."
"Taste is similar, and it virtually matches my idealized version of the style. Big lemon tart, backed up with some pale malt and funk. Goes great with my omelette. Feel is puckeringly dry, good carbonation to keep it moving. Long finish. Great drinkability, fantastic beer here."
"Bottle was shared and poured into small glasses, and I was surprised by the rose colour of the beer, with a white head that left light to no lacing. A very fruity apple nose to the beer, smells like an apple cider rather than a beer. When I first sipped it was evident why they call these beers sour, WOWZA! That's not to say I didn't like it, I just had trouble initially discerning other flavours from it. Over time, the bitter sourness lets some of the fruitiness come through. Interesting, but tough on the palate and tough to drink."
"Nov 2009, 750ml: Lemony, sharp lactic sourness, mild funk, increasingly tannic and woody as the beer warms. Very good, should improve nicely with age."
"D: I will have to say I enjoyed this overall. You have to be in the mood for this type of beer to truly enjoy it. I probably didn't pick up on all of the character of this beer as I'm a novice. The good thing is that I now want to try more beers like this. I'll pick this up again after I have a more experienced palate."
"Hazy gold pour with a bubbly white head. Retention and lacing is very good for the style, and rings of white lace are deposited on the sides of the glass. The nose is musty and redolent of horse blanket and lemon. The cobwebs of the brewery seem to revel in its funky aroma. The flavour leaves a dominant impression of fresh lemon juice, funk, wet hay and a warm yeastiness. Its just like a sour and dry white wine. Wonderfully, puckeringly delightful and refreshing, the body is in perfect sync, with its lightness and spritzy carbonation. Cantillon have stolen my heart and made me reassess gueuze. The price was well worth paying."
"Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied. Drinkability is good for a sour. Definately needs to be shared. Great beer and I'm glad I finally got to try it."
"D: A very drinkable beer, low ABV and a complex flavor make this a very enjoyable/refreshing beer, especially when sipped."
"D-very nice complexity. interesting sense-wise. I would drink this again."
"Pours a soft golden color with a small white head that hangs around for a while. Smells of deep tart oranges, deep earth, andk a rich brett-funk. The aroma is just wonderful. The taste is very tart with a deep earthy barn flavor. Almost reminiscent of a must basement fruit cellar. Very clean and crisp with a balanced acidity. A wonderful beer."
"The mouth feel and drink ability were both good but not great. This bottle could definitely use some age on it."
"Overall this is a very well made beer - a nice and solid beer for the style and the fact that it comes from Cantillon doesn't come as a surprise. Well worth a shot."
"D- Great. Light and crisp enough, the sour keeps my watering mouth begging for the next sip."
"A very well balanced and complex sour ale that twarts the notion of one-dimensionality or simplicity. Characterful and as unoffensive as true sours can be."
"Had this on tap at City Beer Store in SF! Gold in color with surprising clarity for style; nominal head and no real lacing to speak of but on point for style. The nose is a bit funky with notes of grape and melon with pleasant vinegar qualities, even a bit of coriander. This a real palate pleaser, slight tartness with a very clean finish. Apple and melon are noticeable on the mid-palate along with some hay qualities. Very tasty and extremely refreshing for a warm summer day."
"I wish these bottles were a little closer to my house."
"D-although light, the taste is pretty funky and while I enjoyed this brew very much I don't think I could drink more than two in one sitting. Still, I love it."
" D- This beer has a nice up front tartness in the flavor with some nice tartness in the finish but the other flavors were pretty soft."
"Medium bodied. Good carbonation, just a slight tingle. Highly drinkable. Hard to keep it in the glass for too long. Truly a classic gueuze. However, I'd rate Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze slightly higher."
"Drinkability: I could sip this all night -- it's very robust nose and even stronger flavors to boot that are super sour, yet come across with some sweet candi sugars, mustiness, etc...; acidity creeps in after a bit and becomes a bit much, but really the flavors are so amazing and create such a crazy drinking experieince, that the drinkability is still solid."
"Wow, very long lasting cascade produces a small white head, typical pale ale colored body. Scent is tart tart tart. Taste is sour and earthy. Lots of yeast which has been through god knows what. Fruits and grass, honey. Watery yet full bodied, active on the tongue. Cantillon at its finest. God i love these beers"
"Awesome example of the style, wish I could get it where I live. Paired amazingly well with the lobster roll I had for lunch."
"Taste is quite unique as well. Very sour with apples, a hint of yeast and lemons. Very warming for a low alcohol beer. The bottle said to drink this pretty warm at 55F. Not as bubbly on the tongue as I thought it would be. I expected Alka-Seltzer but glad I didn't get it. This appears to be a very good representative of the style, but I am no expert."
"I love Cantillon, that is all..."
"D - This is a fantastic go-to brew. Rarely is a Gueuze better."
"Drinkability -- Tart, funky, complex. A bit too astringent for me to consider drinking on a regular basis, but I really enjoyed it. It kept me engaged and challenged my palate."
"Drinkability:This 2009 vintage is still kind of harsh, it probably needs a few more years in the bottle."
"Medium carbonated with a fluffy light to medium body. Smooth and slick over the tongue. Refreshing and invigorating; a perfectly crafted lambic."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I tried this beer on June 18,2009 at ""The Beer Bistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer was bottled on February 22, 2008...and if stored in a cool dry place would keep until 2030 (it said so on the bottle). The beer poured a cloudy gold colour with a very thin white head. The aroma was sour cherries and apples with a little bit of malt. The mouthfeel was dry, very tart, highly carbonated, and medium bodied. The flavour was tart apples, and some graininess. Very enjoyable."
"I can't imagine a guezue getting much better. The balance is tremendous and the funk is so well-executed. This is the best guezue I've ever had; if there are better than I really, really want to try them. Please. Give them to me. I'm down for trades."
"Very drinkable beer, this beer is simply a classic as the label so aptly suggests."
"Well-carbonated, nice body. Leaves sour film all over your mouth. 750ml by myself wasn't too much of a problem."
"D: This is just a classic beauty, there's nothing more to say. Great complexity and flavour, and I was really racing through the bottle. The acidity is not nuts, it just makes the beer that much more drinkable. This beer is still quite rare in the Southland so I'm trying to milk it as much as possible."
"D- Really nice Gueuze; very tasty and tart, making it a great sipper."
"D - Couldn't finish the entire (large) bottle, which is unusual for me. Too freakin sour and my tastebuds just couldn't take it after a while. Good, but in small doses."
"This was an amazing shock to the taste buds today, I recommend that everyone breaks away from their favorite style once and awhile just to give your senses something new to enjoy. As far as drinkability goes, this one is really going to be up to you because it is so different from any style out there. I'd say that its pretty drinkable but not in large quantities and I'm glad that it was in a short bottle. This beer was refreshing and tart and I could see it pairing very well with lots of foods and desserts. If you happen to come across this style of beer go for it, you never know what you'll think unless you try it"
"750ml bottle in a wine glass. Pours the color of honey, opaque, with bubbly white head. Taste is sour - obvi - think of lemon/limey sour more than funk but without the harshness. Really hits the front of your tongue. The aftertaste is pleasing, but its tough to get to all the subtle flavors going on underneath."
"Light to medium bodied, acidic, with low carbonation. Finishes very dry. A nice complex Gueuze which is well made, and definitely worth seeking out again."
"pour is like apple juice with a small head and a bit of murk. nose of apples and lambic funk. palate is has a lot of latitude for something that is suppose to be asstringent and contracting for the tastebuds. sour apple with some woodiness... but the finish is key. a bit of malt quality of honey and pollen deep in there. palate if he finish beside sour is prodominently oaky. a mild finish that sit on the tongue and reveals qualities of lilly and other floral delicacies. great."
"Beer is thin and kind of fruity with lots of great flavors. Finishes cleanly, nice lactic and acetic notes with great tartness at the corners. Drinkability high, mouthfeel great. One of the best gueuzes I've ever had."
"Pours a hazy golden straw color with moderate head of prickly bubbles and decent spotty sheets of lacing. Scent is mild and light, watery grape and apple, hints of spice, backed my a young funkynees and freshly dried straw. Taste is a touch more aggressive, but still controlled and light, pressed grapes and skins, the grain notes are a little more pronounced along with a muted barnyard, funk and tart tastes. A lighter medium body, spritzy at first but carbonation disapears quickly, dry. A nice, classic style done without much to get in the way of that fact."
"D - Refreshing, but definitely a sipper due to the sourness throughout, which stops just short of making this a difficult drink. Challenging, but rewarding."
"D - It's pretty tasty, but I can't usually have more than one of these. Don't even try going to a mild style of beer after this, as it leaves your tastebuds scorched."
"D - At only 5% abv, this is my session beer. Love this style."
"Cantillon Classic Gueuze is superbly balanced and delicious. It probably deserves a 5 for taste with so much going on, and so harmoniously. I'll be buying this again, hopefully often."
"DB- Pricey but good. A well crafted/strenuous beer to make, the flavors are nice and balanced but did not blow me away. A very nice example of what bacteria and yeast are capable of doing to a beer. A good one to split but I could enjoy a whole 750ml."
"D- i had this beer when it was in its youth. ill revisit this vintage again a few times over the next decade (if my willpower holds out). not something id want every day, but a benchmark for the style."
"Overall: World class. Not cloyingly sweet like pasteurized and blended lambics. Just straight up sourness with an amazingly complex fruity flavor profile. I don't think I could drink it all night long but it's something I would gladly buy again."
"D: Very enjoyable. The 750 mL bottle is perfect for 2."
"D- Very good stuff. It might be a bit too intense for a whole bottle to yourself though."
"D: Whenever I have a good gueuze I can't help but say to myself, I would like to wake up every weekend and drink one for breakfast with waffles, whipped cream and fresh fruit. Cantillon is highly regarded for a reason.... this is just one of many."
"The beer is clear, sunset orange with a medium sized head and spotty lacing. The aroma offers barnyard funk, straw, tart lemons, citrus. Beautiful and simple. Classic Cantillon nose and flavor. A graceful acetic presence with a subtle burn in the finish. Very smooth with moderately low carbonation. Very enjoyable. As the label states, a classic."
"I was never fond of lambics due to only having the fruited ones. Now? I need to get more of this! I can see setting back one after another in the summer rather than a mojito or a shandy."
"Drinkability: Awesome gueuze. Could drink this all day. Not an intro gueuze as the sourness is prominent, but very very good."
"With great clarity, this beer is light orange with a dense off-white head with great retention and lacing. The nose... to quote Devin Townsend - ""Oh. My. Fuck.Ing.God"" Musty as hell with plenty of tannins, grapefruit, copious funk, this is exceptional. The blend and balance of musty basement with bright citrus character is particularly exceptional. The palate opens tart and salty, very Limburger-like. While tannic, this is still very bright and lemony with moderate citrus. Musty, cheesy, funky... this is the paragon of an aged gueuze. I can't help but stress how wonderful the balance between the tannins and the citrus is, this is just fabulous stuff."
"(D)- Just a 'classic' beer for the style; so the name fits it well. All-around just plain good and tasty."
"The beer is very drinkable because of the minimal alcohol percentage and the extremely dry finish that keeps one thirsty for more!"
"Nothing short of perfection."
"A ""must-have"" when you speak about lambic."
"""Bottled in 2009"" on the cork. Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a thin ring of lace. Smell, which you can smell from across the room: vinegar, lemon, barnyard (but more like zoo) funk. Taste: lime, grapefruit, sour cherry... the tart and sour fades into funky midsip... finish is green grapeskin with a hint of sweetness. Low on the carbonation, which is not very noticeable because it's pretty much puckering. Finishes dry. I had a hard time with the combination of big funk and big lactic-ness in the aroma, but it's certainly tasty."
"insanely easy drinking. this is young and im sure it will become more sour over time and the sweetness may even take a back seat. i cannot wait to see what some time does to this."
"D- This makes for a nice sipping beer, not because of the ABV but because it is astringent. I only have one bottle but I think that after one, you wouldn't be able to differentiate tastes as well because of the astringency. A good beer for people looking to get into lambics or gueuze."
"Drinkability: A really superb geuze, with all kind of subtleties"
"D- What a great opportunity to try this '96 vintage! Lots of sour and funk still hanging around in this brew-it has really held up well. I'd like to try this a bit fresher so I can look back and compare the experiences."
"4.0 D: Tasty brew. I've been into wild stuff lately and this hit the spot. Strong flavors, but not off putting. Well done."
"D - delicious, yet light and very refreshing. akin to a good and slightly dry and not overly sweet champagne. closing my eyes and sipping on this puts me outside on my porch on a warm June evening."
"D - Overall, I'm really enjoying this beer. Perhaps a bit too high on the skunky funk, but that seems to be less noticeable as I go thru the bottle. Very good example, not my favorite, but beers like this make me wonder why I sometimes spend so much time, effort and money getting the super-hyped, super-rare American wilds when I can go to any number of local stores and pick up fine examples of the style like this for normal prices. Probably won't stop me from hitting the overhyped stuff, but still makes me wonder."
"The flavor is crisp and very tart apples with a dry finish. Ethers are slightly present as well as dry vinegary aftertaste. Over all the mouth feel is much less busy than the Oude and this comes across as a more focused and easier drinking gueuze than the Oude. Actually this is MUCH easier to drink than the Oude and I find the overall effect of this beer more inviting. I would use this to entice wine fans over to the beer side of things. Overall a great and tasty beer, and a wonderful (introduction to as well) gueuze."
"Some Cantillon brews are so sour, your stomach starts to feel it. Not so with this....as I said, I find myself taking large, deep sips of this with no gastric protest. Tasty, complex, low-ABV - real winner here. Big time. I don't know which gueuze I like better, this or Girardin. Outstanding. I'm pretty close to giving this a straight 5."
"Cheers!"
"375 mL cork-n-crown champagne bottle, bottled in 2007. Brewed with 65% barley and 35% raw wheat, with 5 grams per liter of three year old hops. This is a blend of one, two and three year old lambics that spent upwards of a year at the brewery to fully carbonate. It pours a beautiful, chill-hazed golden orange, with a thin white cap that leaves little lacing - very inviting. Cleaner that I was expecting in the nose, with a little funkiness, oak, cork and an earthy character. Pretty crazy sour on the palate, with oak, cork and a strong acidic note. Little musty as well, with mild malts, cherry pits?, sharp lemon, and a bit of bitterness, oddly enough. It has a light and tingly, very dry body, with teeth-peeling sourness that attacks the back of the throat. Despite the wildly sour character of this beer, it is imminently drinkable and very refreshing. Fans of gueuze need to seek out this beer."
"This is probably the gueuze all gueuze's should be judged on, always a classic and having it readily available doesn't hurt either."
"J"
"Overall, it doesn't get much better than this. World-class! ~"
"This is a total sipper, obviously. I could spend a whole night with just one bottle. But if you like sour, it's perfect. I'll certainly be drinking this again--I'm positive that there will be many days when I wake up craving that sour flavor. Excellent choice for my first gueuze!"
"The carbonation is really high. I haven't tried more than a handful of real lambic style beers and this is only my third gueuze so I don't have a good sample size whether I prefer a high or low carbonation on these styles of beers. I'm leaning towards that I prefer low carbonation because I tend to keep each sip in my mouth longer in order to fully taste and appreciate the flavors. In a highly carbonated example like this the carbonation gets too distracting. Despite of that and how sour it is I still found it of above average drinkability and my mouth wasn't permanently puckered and weeping after the whole bottle."
"This is classic Cantillon. Really good. I would have like a little more subtle flavors, but it is everything anybody would want from the brewery. Recommended."
"The low-medium carbonation increases the mustiness and dirty feeling felt on your tongue through the finish and aftertaste. This is such an enjoyable and satisfying beer to drink, but it's by no means a session beer and a 750mL bottle is ideally split at least 3 ways. I look forward to getting more bottles for my cellar. An excellent concoction."
"This was a very interesting beer. It's refreshing, but the intense flavors command small sips. I'd love to have more of this."
"D: While not a session brew, this sour brew is very refreshing, and would be great to enjoy outside on a 90+ degree Summer day. A very solid example of this style. Probably my personal favorite."
"I love this beer, it's not Iris good though, Hannaford."
"D - very easy thanks to the ABV. Assuming you like sour beers, I suppose!"
"Honestly, this was a gueuze that I could see kickstarting an addiction for sour beers. Up until this point I have tried a few beers that were sour but this one really gave me some wow factor, I am loving it."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable Gueuze. No complaints and no real mouth pounding acidity. Wonderful."
"D: After the initial tartness dies down, the becomes very easy to drink. This seems like a complex beer that would age well. Will definitely drink again"
"D - I'm going to cork the rest of the bottle to share with a friend in a bit. It's funky and good, but one glass will do. Unlike any other beer out there."
"D - Smoothest and most elegant gueuze that I've had. Really something special on tap."
"Overall, an excellent Gueuze, no doubt. I can definitely tell this is a young Gueuze, and I can easily see that this will only get better with age, gaining complexity. I can't wait to try my older bottle a couple years down the road."
"D - This is a very tart and refreshing gueuze, and while it is not as complex as some of Cantillon's other offerings, it is very drinkable. The fruit character is probably the most outstanding feature, characterized by a nice candied orange note in the flavor. The wild character is kind of lacking in complexity and somewhat one-dimensional, but there is a good level of sourness that makes for a very refreshing beer."
"D: Very drinkable considering it's a lambic, though I'm glad I had friends to share the bottle with."
"The flavor opens with succulent tart lemon with a whisper of orange. The beer seems to suck the moisture out of my mouth with its tannins, and then quench my thirst with tart citrus. The beer is extremely woody and it has a nice high level of funk. The beer has a moderate lactic quality. The Brett imparts horsey, goaty, cheesy, musty, and wet barnyard blanket notes. The citric acidity is high and there's a low level of acetic character. The beer seems to rip the enamel off my teeth with its acidity. The finish is dry, woody, tannic, and tart with lingering lemon. An aged Gueuze is an amazing experience. What could possibly be better?"
"D- A very drinkable gueuze. I can drink this stuff all night and wouldn't anticipate the sourness to become too overpowering."
"Light body and carbonation - I would have liked it to be more lively!"
"Drinkability is great for a gueze/lambic lover! I love it, but not everyone has to as it is pretty powerful stuff."
"All in all another highly enjoyable Cantillon brew. These beers are becoming a regular part of my beer runs. Hopefully I can find more Cantillon offerings in these smaller bottles as the big ones are a little pricey."
"D-Dispite some of my complaints, this is a great beer. Just not as funky and complex as other cantillon gueuzes i've had in the past. Could use a touch more carbonation and more brett (seemed almost one dimentional, or at least with less dimentions then usual)."
"The taste is like sour sprite, in a a good way. I get more of the leather/barnyard fuck, but teh acidity shows up a lot more. Its like you let a bunch of citrus fruits rot, ferment and then poured them over some really funky cheese then strained that through some 20 year old boots and poured it up. Despite the disgusting way i described it, i really really like this beer."
"Drinkability: Would be a perfect beer for a hot day if you're just looking to sip on something delicious or you just want something different and super complex. Really really good."
"D - Very nice beer one of my very first sours, don't know if I would drink a lot but this one is good none the less."
"drinkability is excellent. beers like this will always get some bad reviews because the flavors are so polarizing, which is unfortunate. this is a supremely sour and fresh brew with a tart profile and a sourness that plays off of a light funk, helping to sustain the crispness. what a solid beer. it dances on the palate with its light sharpness and leaves the palate puckering for the next sip. cheers!"
"This is so sour that you have to drink it slow to savour it. It's a good representation of the Gueuze, but I don't think it's my style."
"Very interesting brew. Lots of flavors that play off each other excellently. Not something I would drink very much of, but great for a special occasion. (and amazing with lemon bars)"
"Had this one on-tap at Track 84 on 8/7/09. Served in a snifter. Poured A golder-orange with a quarter-inch, thin white head that settled into a skim. Nose reveals a bit of funk, citrus and light fruit; perhaps pineapple and apricot. Taste follows nose - sour, tart and musky. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied, but closer to the light end of the spectrum - finished with a slightly astringent pucker. I'm still very new to this style, but what a pleasant and refreshing sipper."
"Fizzy full body mouthfeel, a great summer beer, maybe the best made beer I've tasted from this wonderful maker, a gueuze to die for. Great to have it on tap, will be seeking it in bottles as well."
"This beer goes down extremely easy and improves with each sip. The first taste confuses, the second entices, and the third entrances. This is one for the beer Gods. Endlessly complex. A true experience."
"Poured into a tumbler, the deep orange body is slightly hazed, but with no visible sediment. It formed a nice head and surprisingly 20 minutes later it hasn't broken. The foam had a very creamy texture. The aroma was a little different than the current ""Classic Gueuze", with orange peel and definitely some orange yogurt wafting up. With a swirl there was the more typical sharp acidic note. The first sips felt soft, time seems to have mellowed it's sharpness, though it was still puckeringly sour. Orange and lemon rind, with all the succulence of sucking on a peach pit that still has fruit clinging to it. Definitely soft and peachy. Savory cheese notes come out in a longer draw. It's an ethereal experience, i'll be sad when this bottle is gone!"
"This is probabaly the finest Gueuze I've tasted. Pours pale yellow with a one finger head. Smell is of grapes and green apples, wonderful. Taste is so wonderful and complex. Sour apples and grapes with some lemon in the backround. Very tart but oh sooo perfect and drinkable. This is one to not be missed!!! A lot of people may not like this style of beer but I absolutely have become a huge fan because of this wonderful beer!!!"
"D - This was a sour burst, but was still a well crafted beer that everyone should experience once"
"Had this at the Charlotte Flying Saucer two days ago. Reviewed from notes taken there. Poured into a snifter. Smell of barnyard, leather, and some light citrus. Extremely dry in the taste with amazing sourness. Lots of lemon in the taste with hints of oak, wheat and lots of acidity. It has a nice dry and tangy finish. I quite enjoyed this beer. Wish we could get more traditional lambics in Texas. Will definately try again."
"D: Surprisingly drinkable. It took my palate a little while to adjust to the new style, but after the first few sips I was definitely getting into it."
"Bottled in 2008. Picked up a single 37cl bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for about $8 with tax. Mmmm. Tart and tangy, yet light on the tongue like palate. This is a little spicier than other Cantillons, with an earthy cracked pepper flavor. In addition to the lemon-lime funk, there's also a hint of lighter, almost melon-like fruit in the background. Oddly, this feels a little cleaner, as in less barnyard type notes (just a hint in the nose). If you like sour beers, or lemonade, give this a try."
"Poured a hazy gold, with a light white head. Smelled citrusy and slightly sour. Tasted sour with sweet notes I wasn't expecting. I had been told the beer was ridiculously sour so was let down to find it wasn't as sour as I was expecting. Not a bad brew at all, my judgement was clouded by previous expectations. Will definitely need to try again."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly, light, and perfect. Delicious."
"Another fine brew from cantillon that should age well for some time. Pours a golden straw color with a silky tan head. Spectacular nose of farmyard funk, horse blanket, manure, damp rotting oak, tart fruits and sweet malts. The taste is not quite as impressive as the nose, but is still quite good. Great blend of sour, sweet and funky flavors. Crisp dry body with good carbonation and an acidic finish. Top knotch."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It boasts of pale malts and extreme sourness. The Brett character is quite strong. It also bone dry. The taste is awesome! It's prickly carbonated with loads of sourness. It's light and quite dry with a crisp sourness in the finish. The horse hair character is so intense. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very well done gueuze."
"D - the lower acidity for a lambic gives it good drinkablity"
"Foil, capped, and corked, this fella was scary getting into. The cork has seen better years, Crumbled on me three times before I got into it. The cork pieces smelled of a highly corrosive finger nail polish remover smell. Poured carefully in to a Duvel glass leaving about a sixth of the bottle in. Beer is very clear and transparent golden amber with a healthy amount of carbonation bubbles transpiring toward the top. Head is non existent, though there is a very faint ring around the edge of the glass. Smell is Gueuze like, very mellow, not in your face funk, very subtle. Taste is mellow sour, super easy compared to Cantillon's funkier offerings. Sour with a modest tartness, clean and dry on the tongue. Overall, really easy to drink, I wish this would have been one of my first Cantillon's, would have made the transition to sour's and funk's easier a few years ago. :) Either that or this one has aged to a more mellow sour, just about right for where a Gueuze should be."
"An aged gueuze is truly a great experience and one I hope to repeat many times. (5)"
"gueuze so hard, this shit crazy"
"I wasn't crazy about this beer. I like freaky stuff, but this didn't really excite me."
"This is a wonderful beer. I've only had the Lindemans Gueuze, Lindemans Cuvée René, and Mead the Gueuze as a reference. Besides the Cuvée René, those are much sweeter. Cantillon's Gueuze would be a great primer to introduce someone to the Rodenbach Grand Cru or Lindemans Cuvée René."
"A delicious, summertime beverage!"
"I had either a mouthful of this, or a noseful of this, at all times until my glass was empty. I wish I could buy a Gueuze air freshener, hehe."
"Drinkability/Overall: so...it's good to know that I'm game to this beer now. Tart, funky, refreshing. A very well made artisinal lambic."
"First Cantillon brew, not overally tarty like many people claim them to be, not as good as Giridin but not bad overall, would try another year if it came along, other than that different gueuzes are better for the price, recommended if you are a fan of blended lambics"
"Overall, I thought the organic gueuze had a bit more residual sweetness at this point as well as a slightly more muted character. Today I think I was in the mood for something more muted so that really fit the bill but the standard has a nice complexity to it that I could see myself desiring. Both are fantastic products."
"Review added 10-27-2007, translated from french 1-31-2008."
"My first guezue. It didn't disappoint. Poured into a snifter, it was a hazy yellow color. Tiny white head, very still. It had a musty (in a good way) aroma, with a tiny whiff of citrus. Incredibly sour taste. My salivary glands really puckered up. A little bitterness as well. Light but fulfilling, truly enjoyable. I want more."
"Cheers!"
"This is a classic gueuze to be sure. Complex beyond barnyard mustiness. Not for the intro to the style, but one that a true gueuze-fan would love."
"The net effect of this being slightly toned down in comparison to some other geuze is that this brew is quite drinkable, better balanced, and more refined. This seems more grown up, professional, and consistent. This is a fine geuze and certainly one of the more drinkable I have found thus far."
"D-hard for me to rate as I haven't had the style before. I will definitely try this again and possibly rerate. However drinkability is definitely low as this is too sour to have more than one of."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden/amber, very bright, one finger white head forms, disappears down to a think layer and nice ring, nice lacing on the glass. Smell is gueuzy! Very sour and acidic, hay, horseblanket, grapes, some yeast, very funky, kickass. Taste is insane sour acidity Cantillon style, honey sweetness in the middle, almost buttery citric sour finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. The most drinkable Cantillon I've had, nicely done!"
"Drinkability - Not the most drinkable of beers. I think it is very good, but if you are not into the sour beers, well this may not be your beer."
"D - This beer is not the most drinkable. I could probably go for one 750ml bottle in a sitting, though the sitting would at least be an hour long. I love the sour flavor, but I can only sip this beer (seems strange for a beer that is only 5%). I love this beer, and I want more."
"Mouthfeel was moderately carbonated but not so much so as to outshine the taste. Somewhat still in the mouth and zesty in the throat. Oily on the gums and mouth, like citrus oil. A refreshing sipper."
"D: Very tasty and interesting, but a bit difficult to drink due to the strong acidity, but definitely worth a try."
"This was a top form lambic, and my first sample on tap. Incredible stuff. I wish something like this was available in Toronto, or any proper lambic for that matter."
"Overall it's not one of the top beers for the style. It's raw flavor is underdeveloped although it fits the mold for the tartness/acidity. Worth a try considering the thin selection of Gueuze out there..."
"D- It is good but just might have gone off a little. Tastes like something isn't fully there. Not sure what it is but I would like to taste a fresh one and see if there is a difference."
"Cork dated 2006: Dark gold/orange colour, pretty clear, with a short cap of fine, white bubbles. There was a little clumpy lacing and it had pretty good head retention. Acidic, earthy aroma, some horse, with a light vinegar and green apple quality. Fruity too, mostly grapeskin, with a little malt as it warmed. Very tart and acidic, light vinegar and some saltiness. Fruity like a dry white wine, some green apple, with a bit of earthy barnyard funk. Sourness lingers on the palate. Quite dry with a little astringency, but there's still some residual sugar in there. Medium bodied, moderate yet spritzy carbonation. Tasty and refreshing. I really liked this one."
"I enjoyed this brew with some good friends in the early evening, along with some great blue cheese. From a large corked and capped bottle, the beer has a beautiful thick white head and a clear gold color. The aroma is fruity, with a considerable oak smell. Theres just a hint of grain the smell as well, with a note of tartness. The taste is quite acidic, and refreshingly sour. The sourness fits the beer very well, and isnt overwhelming. Theres a vinous quality, and the carbonation is fairly high. This gives the beer a champagne-like feel. This is a relatively dry beer, which is also extremely drinkable. Refreshing and very good."
"Bottle at Bruxellensis (9/9/06), served from a wicker basket."
"The beer pours a fuzzy golden-orange with a modest creamy white that semi-creamy in texture, the lace a velum like covering upon the glass. Nose to quote a long time friend is that of horse hair, barnyard tones, sour and sweet, citrus like, to me lime zest, Start is jaw crushingly tart, with a light mouth feel. Finish is ferine in its acidity, tart and desert bone dry, with the after taste long lasting, a real Lambic lovers Lambic, but not for the faint of palate."
"Excellent, I've come around to this style of beer."
"Taste is dry, harsh to my humble palate, dry hoppy, followed by a sourness, orange, fruit and green apple hit you with some shy notes of spices."
"taste is acidic, but not overwheliming puckerish, somewhat complex and very refreshing. the finish is moderate and sour, overall a very good result. at this age it is by far the most complex of any gueuze i own at present. Having had many of cantillon's other products recently it is kind of odd not to taste any fruits or other oddities, but this gueuze is extremely pleasant."
"I've had this gueze before and never could get used to the overwhelming sourness. However, I took a different approach this time; wines often benefit from being paired with food, so I made crabcakes to serve with this beer. Wow! The sweetness of the crab and the sourness of this gueze were a perfect match, a real dialogue of flavors."
"This was the hit at my beer/dinner party. Quite impressive in the champagne flute and went very well with some excellent cheddar. Can't wait to have some more."
"Not the most drinkable gueuze I have ever had. Glad the mug only cost $2.00, rather than having to buy a bottle for $10.99."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Thin bodied, dry mouthfeel with a low-medium degree of carbonation. The taste is very mature, more forward than the malt are more musk and sourness. When the malt finally comes across it is underneath a wave of rich, winey flavors that are lighting up the back of the tongue. Great length! As a stand alone 12oz. bottle this is a pretty drinkable brew. I don't think I could drink much more than that in a sitting."
"What a change of pace! What a great style of beer. I'm a believer."
"Wow what a weird beer. 2002 edition on tap at the Moan and Dove. My first experience with lambic beers, so I didn't know exactly what to look for but I've read a lot of reviews here that gave me a basic idea of what I was getting into. Apears a nice golden amber color with no head at all, very cloudy. Smell and taste are quite intense to say the least. Super sour tart and tangy with some funky grassy stinkyness. Total absence of any noticable malt or hops. Definitely abrasive but for some reason I kept wanting to take another sip. Mouthfeel is very dry and dusty, yet inviting. I actually had no problems drinking this beer, I finished the glass pretty quickly. I went into this one with an open mind, and I think that helped. I don't know if I liked this beer because I thought I was ""supposed"" to like it because it gets such great ratings here, or if I actually would've liked it if I had never heard of such a thing before. But the bottom line was I did like it. I wouldn't crave this one right after a long day to crack open and relax with like a nice quenching ale but I could see it as being a unique choice once in a while to change things up. I'll definately have to educate my palate a little more with this stuff."
"I'm sure this is an acquired taste. It took me time to acquire a taste for IPA' s but even my first IPA I said, ""not bad...I can see getting into this"". Not so for this. I don't want to be closed minded so I will probably re-visit this style again but it will be an exception no the norm. To each his own but damn...this stuff was rough."
"Served in a lambic basket into a cantillion glass at a great bar in the center of brussles that I cant for the life of me remember the name of. Pale golden and cloudy with a divine funky, barnyard aroma. Hints of acetic acid and grape skins lurk in the background. Actively carbonated, lively on the tongue and initially shockingly refreshing and sour at the same time. Manages to be full bodied and devastatingly flavorful while punishing with the sourness and overall funk. A bit more fruity and alcoholic as it warms, the experience only increases in intensity and masochistic enjoyment. Not for the faint of heart, but for those who dare, it just dont get any better than this."
"drinkability is mediocre, but stunningly high for the usually-tart cantillon products.. not that this lacks tartness, but it is much more appropriate with this basic version. i'll stick with gambrinus but this was a nice, afternoon pairing with asiago and crusty bread."
"Whoa! Big horsey smell when I finally got the slightly moldy cork out of the bottle. Kicked up a big foamy head when I poured it, that quickly subsided as I set up some crackers and blue cheese. Appearance is just like a pilsner, yet somehow more pleasing. That original smell went away, too. Taste combines aspects of a dry champagne and a sour grape juice. Sourness is not distracting, rather, allows more subtle traces of fruits. Cant pick up too much malts or hops, but color is like a good French farmhouse ale. Yeast dregs on bottom add extra note of grape skin tannins. Good introduction to this style for me!"
"Smooth mouthfeel with a wonderful carbonation that works really well. This is such a joy to drink and I could easily enjoy this all night. I'm looking forward to trying more Cantillon offerings as I am extremely impressed. Highly recommended."
"Pours a pale golden color with a nice light head leaving no lace. There are scents of crabapples, tartness and sourness, some barnyard, and bits of zest. Flavors are a concentration of acidic and acetic tones, with hints of zest and apple notes as well. There is a huge mouth puckering sourness to this brew that lets you know its Cantillon. There is also what I would say be an almost salty tone here and there but it is very faint and the sourness masks over it. The finish to this brew is effectively tart and sour with a nice backing of peppery spiciness that lingers on the tongue just letting you know that this is one truly funky ass brew. There is also slight hints of sweetness just here and there which add to the depth of this brew. This is definetly not for the faint of heart but a fully enjoyable brew that I will always look for."
"Nice. Nice. Nice."
"Overall, a unique and highly respectble experience. Surprisingly drinkable for such a funky brew. Will try it again when I can get it..."
"Still fairly young, I think this could have stood a year or two more in the bottle, but I wanted it with my thanksgiving dinner. A decent gueuze, though somewhat mild. Somewhat variable; I'm sure I've had more sour bottles of Cantillon gueuze in the past."
"People have told me there is much better geuze out there so the search continues."
"Cheers"
"This poured out a clear orange with about an inch of white head on top. It left a slight scattering of lace around the glass as it was consumed. Aroma was sharply tart at first but mellowed out after a few minutes. There was a bit of sweetness to the aroma as well. The taste followed suite with a strong acidic tartness upfront before the sweetness came in to add some balance. The tartness definitely caused this one to be a real sipper for me since I am not used to this style of beer yet. Body was about light to medium with a crisp feel to it. With this being my first gueze and all I really didnt find it very drinkable in comparison to most lambics Ive had. It wasnt bad by any means just different. I plan on sticking with the style and coming back for a re-review if necessary."
"I'm not really a gueuze man, but this is one that I wouldn't mind trying every now and then."
"Wow pours a golden yellow with a head that well even when poured into a geuze glass was foaming to go.. Aroma is well.. take me to funkytown.. Cider, half rotten apples, horseblanket, champaigne. All melding in.. Taste is very very tart, a bit of aged vinegar with a cider backbone. My only other gueze was lindemans regular, but this was way above that.. too many tastes to mention. It was like drinking an aged cider vinegar at the same time with a nice saison and craft cidre.. I want more of this. Drinks so smooth tis not funny.. I wish i had snapped up more of these.. Bought at Lee and Edwards in Roanoke.. I wish I had bought the Rose d;Gambrinus but it was 20 bucks and the better have was giving me the sideways glance..."
"Reviewing Notes: I could have copied and pasted the style description right out of the BJCP on-line style guide to write this review. Word for word this bottle represents the ideal of a Belgian Gueze."
"There was a decent amount of gunsmoke but no gushing when I popped the cork on this one. I came to realize this was bottled in 2002 as noted by the cork. A nice pale golden color supported an instantly disapating white head, leaving only a slight collar around the edge of the glass. Aroma was very intense, instantly filling my room with a musty fruitiness. Nose isn't as funky as I was expecting, but there definately are aromas of tart apples. Taste matches well with the aroma. Initially very dry with strong fruit notes but dissolves into a sourness that wasn't as over the top as I was expecting. A little bit of saison barnyard flavor comes through but it is really subtle. The flavor this leaves on your lips is superb. I was suprised to find this highly drinkable (or sipable). An excellent excellent brew. I'm now on a mission to sample as much Cantillon as possible and I can only pray that other gueuzes are as excellent as this one."
"Clear, peachy-gold in hue with a shinny coppery highlight. The color is gorgeous. From the beginning there was loads of animation racing towards the white head, after a few moments the animation because lazy. Concurrently, the once half finger of bubbly white head slipped to a fizzy collar with pockets of foam in the middle. Subsequent lacing was minimal, spotty, and it didnt cling well to boot. The nose is very lively with an interesting acidic pepperiness, woody too. At the back was an aroma of peppermint. Lemony. Sharp yet distant wheaty hints. There are some horsehair and barnyard aromas too. Old gym socks; plus three-day-old grapefruit rinds with a grassy suggestion. As typical for the style the acidity really carries the nose. Inviting just because it is so funky. I do wish the potency was much louder, regardless I dont have any problems detected the smells. Maybe I am being greedy. Still I am compelled to sip. Again, as expected the palate is very acidic and amazingly juicy. Mouthwatering. Mouth-puckering. Succulent. The straightforward sharp acidity cuts like a knife from start to finish. Very refreshing. In-between bites of acidity are slight woody notes, some peppery flavors as well. Occasionally I detect a minty taste as well as some green apples. White wine. There is a wheaty taste towards the finish, not bright in flavor but noticeable. I adore the huge sourness! Dry finish and quite long. The palate is not as complex as the nose indicated but it is damn tasty. And a bit different then the bouquet led on. The sour/acidity drives the palate and this alone steals the show. All of the other flavors are too secondary. Maybe if I drink gueuze more often I would pick up other flavors better; maybe not as I am not completely uneducated in the style. Still, Im not complaining. It is impressing such a beer can be produced with such a low abv. Medium-light in body, moderate carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant but not spectacular. Amazingly drinkable and super refreshing, this is something I need to drink more of. To bad I can only find it (locally) in Iowa City. That is where I bought my bottle. I will stock up on my next trip. This beer is very special."
"A beautiul thing."
"Very Sour but smooth, a beverage requiring food to balance the acid. Amber haze. Apple aroma and sour green apple taste. Mid sip sweetness Not for popularity, and must be shared. Dries throat and leaves a sour with sugar and salt aftertaste. Drink for the experience and then have something to remove the taste."
"Wyll-"
"Re-rate: Bottle dated 2004. Barnyard aroma with sourness and acidic notes quite evident. Taste is quite sour but not as acidic as the bottle tasted in Brussels which was probably fresher. This version seems to make more sense with ratings included here."
"Huge praise, 'Huge."
"Mouthfeel is silky, medium heavy, a bit biting and acidic so I had to take off a little for drinkability. Highly carbonated, lots of burps and an ever-evolving taste. I like The Bum's description as the ""dirty whore of lambics," seems fitting. It's one wild ride for the palate, that's for sure."
"Very light amber, clear, thin white head. Aroma contains tons of wet hay, intense horseblanket, bread, cookies, fruits, sour wheat. I like the horse sweat characteristic, but this doesnt strike me as the perfect gueuze. Palate is full of lactic acidity, but its nowhere close to agressive. Sweat, horsey, wheat, hay, rather complex, apricot, peaches, cider apples, pears.... Bone-dry cider finish, astringent as well. Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation which fits very well. Thanks to Radek for bringing this to the mondial saturday gathering."
"Purchased in a 12 oz. green bottle which was adorned with black foil neck wrapping. Uncapping the bottle revealed a cork underneath, which seems to be a standard for Belgian premium beers. The pour into a tumbler was a cloudy peachy orange color with an initial fizz of carbonation that disappeared very quickly. The aroma was very unique. Its hard to put into words what this beer smells like, but Ill try anyway. I could detect wet grass, sour apples, green onions, and pickled vegetables. As weird as it may sound, the smells actually got my mouth watering. The taste is also extremely unique. The beer exhibits a mouth puckering vinegary sourness at first sip. The sourness is accompanied by a peppery spiciness and a hint of bitterness. There is no sweetness to balance these tastes out, but sweet drinks are for babies any way. As the beer warms, it gets a bit creamier on the palette, tempering the astringency. The 5% ABV is so far down the radar, it slips past the tongue and only shows up as a warming sensation in the belly. This is a light and refreshing traditional gueuze, which should be enjoyable in the upcoming summer months."
"This gueuze poured a hazy golden color with thin white foam that settled. The smell was a strong, tart lambic aroma: horse blanket and sour apples. The taste was sour and tart (puckering) with green apples and grape skins and horse blanket flavors. The aftertaste was bitter and dry. The mouthfeel was dry and tart and crisp with medium body and sharp carbonation. This was a very crisp and refreshing gueuze."
"Sampled 12/31/03"
"Definitely the most puckering lambic I've ever had. Though this wouldn't certainly be made for public consumption, I know I certainly am enjoying it and I definitely hope to have this one in the future!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clouded yellow with a tinge of orange with a mountainous off-white head. Nice lacing left in the glass. Aromas of banyard funk and malt mixed with a looming sourness that is apparent in the nose, maybe something like lemon. Tartness is prevailing on the palate, but pleasant and puckering at the same time. Barnyard funk comes through again with sampling the beer. Fantastic. Glad I've saved the 750 ml to share with a couple friends. One of the finest examples of the blended lambic style I've tried."
"First sip, wow that is tart! the sourness makes my tongue pucker a little. What a fun beer. I get sour granny smith apples and then a faint sweet sugary hit with a finish that leaves my tongue feeling funny. This is a tasty brew and easy to drink after the initial sip and adjusting to the tartness. Very complex beer and I am glad I tried this one."
"Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, for lack of the correct glassware. Very effervescent, lots of tiny bubbles form in the pouring process. They all gather together to form a thick white head when all's said and done and the bottle's empty. The fluffy head slowly collapses on itself as time passes, leaving little to no lace. Bubbly, sharp aroma, not unlike that of champagne. Orangish yellow in color, cloudy but easily transmits light through and through. Taste is defined by tartness, which is initally overpowering, due to my not knowing exactly what to expect. After a few sips, it seems to settle down a bit, with the flavor rounding out with some apple and citrus tones and even a slight oaken aftertaste. A complex and pleasing brew, which after all isn't that surprising, considering the Shelton Brothers don't import just any old beer."
"750ml Bottle capped and corked. 5th Bottling October 2000Poured a light clear gold color with minimal head and looking very Champagne like. Aroma is slightly sour, musty, yeasty and with notes of grapes. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp and somewhat lighter bodied. Flavor is as close to champagne as a beer has eve tasted. Tart and grape like with a dry finish and quite sour. Overall a very good Gueze."
"Appearance: Golden haze with a strong effervescently carbonated white head leaves speckled scattered lacing. Aroma: Tart and acidic barnyard tones of wild yeast, tickles the nose with pure tartness a blend of 1, 2, and 3 years aged lambic. Taste: Layers of tart woody tones with a strong backing of semi tart semi sweet flavors, very complex and strange. The wild spontaneous fermentation creates flavors unknown to most human palate, I'm intrigued and impressed by this offering. Mouthfeel: Spritzy carbonation coats the palate with a great sensation of inordinate flavors. Drinkability: Such a complex different style shouldn't be as drinkable as this very unique and tasty making it a great drinking experience that I would love to taste at Brasserie Cantillon."
" The first sip provided me with a big kick in the face of tart fruits. Yep, this is a Gueuze all right. The peaches really seem to come out in the flavor. Apples die a bit, and the pears are all there. Citrus flavors come in to join the party. All of them combine into a massive tart flavor that causes salivation at the end of every single sip, allowing me to suck in some more of this fine nectar. I find myself trying to squeeze more out of the sides of my mouth. The woody notes are a very nice addition, and they provide a bit of balance as well as an aid to complexity. It is very smooth with almost no carbonation at all. Drinkability is excellent, and a 750 may not be enough. I will do my best to keep myself from breaking the bottle and licking the insides."
"1997 imprinted on the cork. Pours a hazy dull orange with a large fluffy head that sticks around a long while. The smells of apricots, pears and tropical fruits follow up with similar flavors of orange, pear and peach and nice dry citrus hop flavors - lemon, grapefruit and sour grape. This was a nice beer that expands one's understanding of what a beer is. Truly enjoyable and a large anough bottle for several to enjoy."
"Cloudy pale amber hue. Thick, dogged, vanilla white head leaves tattered, rough lace. Dryish, dusty yeast, multiple flora must along with dessicated hay hit the nose initially. They are promptly ensued and complemented by bittersweet lactic notes as well as mellow hints of underripe pair. Understated and welcoming aromawise. Sharper, acetic notes incipient in flavor bite the palate, then taper languidly into a melange of lemon flesh and old lemon peel. Muted, washed horse like enteric hints emerge mid palate along with ghostly kernels of wheat, lending an odd, yet agreeable soured grain impression. Stately underripe plum flesh tartness and tannic skin bitterness persists as a constant undertone. Well carbonated and spritzy, yet there's a subtle, proteinaceous quality that adds girth to the body. Finishes with a brusque snap of oaky sweetness, but otherwise simply lactic and arid. A beautifully complex brew, with an austere, yet assertive acidity. The flavor components haven't quite coalesced, but cellaring should quell any astringencies nicely. Bottled in 2002. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for delivering this fine beer."
"This is one of the classiest Gueuze's I've tried. Rich and concentrated, it maintains the right amont of plump, fruity/malty sweetness to cushion the more untamed aspects. A good intro to the style."
"12 oz corked and capped bottle."
"Overall Impression: A fairly young geuze, I believe. There is no bottling date on the label, but the cork says 2003. While I fully support Cantillon's efforts at preserving ""true lambic"" tradition, I usually find their offerings a bit too extreme for my taste (in the sourness and circus-tent aroma). I do quite like their kriek and framboise when they are less than 6 mos., though."
"The best part about gueuze is that like any truly fine food product (e.g. mangosteen, fresh black truffles) it cannot be explained to the uninitiated with any sense of truth or justice. Call me if you’re having one. Can't wait to age one of these."
"Just stunning in the mouth. Acidic, and on the light side of medium. Its a malty, earthy, barnyard, lemony, leathery feast for the palate. Longer than a time-share condo presentation. A wonderful softness from the bottle-conditioning despite the incredible acidity. Just great stuff."
"Could I drink it for long? Not more than I could suck a lemon for long, but, wow, on a special occasion and in the right mood, this is really special sipping. Try it, but be warned - there's no turning back."
"This one is quite sour smelling. There is lots of acidity (one of the harder gueuzes out there) and tastes of grapefruit. Well carbonated and has a woody finish, that is accompanied by a light bitterness. Though quite sour this beer still manages to be well balanced with lots of different things going on. A good traditional example of this style."
"This beer has a deep golden hue to it but it glows an almost luminescent orange. A compact and long lasting white head adorns the surface. Carbonation noted is modest. There's a nice musty aroma to this beer. Also a little of that Barnyard/Horse Blanket aroma mixed in. And some lemongrass and vinegar on the nose as well. Very inviting. I think this gueuze nails the flavor profile right on the nose for the style. Just delicious. Quite drinkable. I'm surprised at how fast I'm drinking this lambic. The mouthpuckering quotient seems a bit tamer in this one than in other styles of Cantillon I've enjoyed (Kriek and Rose). I like the way the tart acidity is kept in check, but still is allowed to give an abundance of character to the beer. Some hay and stale hops are noted. Vinegar. And a somewhat crass ""farmyard"" flavor that is quite enjoyable. Damn fine gueuze."

"I sampled this at the Cantillon Brewery, where it is served in a wicker basket on its side at room temperature. Gueuze is a very distinctive brew, and is certainly not for everyone. Personally, I'm enjoying the style since my first exposure to it in Belgium. This pours a light golden color with a large, fizzy head from the corked and capped magnum bottle. Its smell is fresh and tart, and one can tell that acidity is on its way before even tasting it. Notes of honey are also present in the nose. The taste, to me, is unlike anything I've tried. The acidity creates a menacing pucker effect at first, but for me, that drew me in closer to the beer, where I discovered notes of Granny Smith apples, honey and sugar. Mouthfeel is quite carbonated and cuts through one's palate like a fine champagne. This actually drinks quite well on a warm day -- super refreshing with its big acidity and citrus notes. Wonderfully complex, yet remarkably enjoyable. A fantastic traditional offering from Cantillon."
"Pours a hazy golden color. This is the basis for anything lambic. The tartness may turn some off, but it can be paired with food that no wine can come close to. This was my first non-fruit lambic and it really opened up my eyes to this style. Taste is very sour with hints of apple."
"This lambic is remarkably clear, golden with a slight orange effect, and has an extremely active white head. Smells sweet and acidic. Apples/cider and grapes are particularly present in the aroma. Tastes extremely tart with some sweetness. Granny Smith apples and grapes stand out in the flavor. This is an extraordinarily dry and tart beer. I have never had anything that's similar to this. I'm quite intrigued and impressed with this style."
"The taste was a bit sour, but also dry. Best way I can describe it is it is more like a a very dry cider than a beer. But after the intial shock on the flavour I quit enjoyed it. I think it could be a very nice drink that could be drunk anytime of the year."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice creamy white head that just won't give up.  Huge tart and musty aroma.  Musty hay smell with some slight woody characterisitics to it.  Cheek puckering tartness starts this one off with an apple and grape skin flavor to it.  A nice fruity sweetness is in the back of this brew and keeps a very pleasant balance.  Extremely crisp and refreshing, this lightish bodied brew is an absolute pleasure to drink.  The only bad thing about this was when the bottle was empty and there wasn't anymore left to drink."
"Sampled some at the Cantillon brewery in Brussels. The head brewer poured it out of a bottle that was laying in a wicker basket. Had the color of a chardonay wine and when you smelled it, it made your mouth water and caused a little puckering. The sample I had was very young - less than 2 months in the bottle and was sweet enough to balance the tartness. Ended acidic on the back of the throat. Like a tart white wine. Nice but only could drink a small glass at a time."
"Hazy peach color, a nice head with bigger carbonation at the edges. Smells a lot like a Chardonney with lots of yeasty barn aromas. Wow, this stuff is major league astringent (bear with me, I'm no Gueuze expert, that's for sure). Ginger flavors, lots of wine-like character, and a sourness that just sucks your cheeks in...then, suddenly, pop, it finishes very clean and dry. Here's a style I need to do ""face off"" comparisons with, a Fruit Lambic is no preparation. To be fair, I'll give it a higher flavor score and lower drinkability (its certainly everything I've heard Gueuze to be) and I'll try to think of occasions when this would be what I want...hail beer diversity. A classic..."
"Kudos to EyeChartBrew for supplying this dirty whore of a lambic."
"Exceptional!!!! Bone dry and slightly tart acidic sourness, very earthy aroma, and impressivly refreshing. Complex, and dry from start to finish, definitely my style of beer."
"Outside of bottle in area around cap was covered in a black crusty liquid that smelled of soy sauce. Cork was still in good condition though. When cork was about halfway out we heard the hissing and rushed it over to the sink to protect the floor. Right about the time I got it to the sink the cork shot out (attached to one of those big cork screws with the handles to make it easier to get the cork out) and it hit the ceiling.I'm just glad I had it aimed straight up and not towards my head or the window. The head was huge but faded quickly and unevenly. The scoring in the bottom of the glass left a thick column of tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass so the head never completely went away. The smell was a bit musty with an aroma I have noticed with many darker belgian ales, especially the La Trappe Dubbel and Quadrupel. I had thought that until recently it was candy sugar, but I'm not sure if that's what it is since I don't know if it's used in this beer. In the flavor, the beginning is some maltiness, mustiness and a few other flavors I don't recognize. The finish is sour and a fairly lengthy aftertaste is also sour. The sourness is the largest part of the flavor profile but not as much as I had been led to believe. A very interesting experience, but it was a little difficult to drink more than a glass."
"Outstanding experience.  The pour alone was worth it.  Big bubbles form below tight ones, popping, causing volcano-like eruptions.  The aromas and flavors transport you to a different place.  Drinking this beer is like putting your tongue in the cobweb-strewn rafters above the fermenters and tasting it's storied history.  Spritzy, tart, sour, funky, bone-dry, delicious."
"Not your usual beer. If you are not prepared for the very wild flavors of a Cantillon you may go into shock. If on the other hand you are looking for a very authentic Lambic, this is your man!!"
"Had a glass of this at the brewery in Brussels ... can't get any better than that. They served it via lambic basket into my glass then I closed my eyes and I was in heaven for a few min."
"100% Lambic baby! Smells tart and downright funky. Colour is cloudy blonde with a thin white lace. Taste is sour, tart, apple skin-tannin-like and dry. Definitely an acquired taste. Personally, I love Gueuze beers."
