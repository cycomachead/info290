"Verdict: A nice gueuze from Boon and the Lambikstoempers, arguably one of the better gueuzes that I've had from Boon. It's a bit richer and heavier and certainly on the sweeter side, but it's very crisp and clean, refreshing and easy to drink."

"Overall: This is something special. The flavors are so refined, soft, and yet unlike any gueuze/lambic I've ever had before."
