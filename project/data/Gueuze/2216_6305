Aroma is tart grapes, sour apple, wet grass, barnyard, wood, and a touch of tropical/citrus sweetness. Taste is moderately tart with the green apple and sour grapes carrying the way. There is a good level of funky yeast and a touch of both woody bitterness and powdered sugar sweetness. Light body, thin texture, high carbonation, tart dry finish.","SierraFlight","0"

My score reflects the undesirable quality in this sample, but I'll say that this is easily one of my favorite sours under normal circumstances. Some of the other more highly rated geuzes out there are far more sharp and sour. This one showcases a perfect balance between funk, sour, and malt sweetness, with a touch of oak thrown in for good measure. Tannins are there, but play more softly on the palate than most do. A must-try beer.","ryan1788a5","Dec 27, 2013"

The flavor provile is very citrusy tart up front, then some dry grass. Nice silty mouthfeel, very dry, and that tartness stings the tongue.

It's crisp, refreshing, lemony with some funk but not so much that it dominates the beer. For the price-quantity-rarity triangle, I can agree that this is the best value although its worth going after the Seasons to try at least once.

A lot of fun to drink, and exponentially improved as it warmed. To be sure, this is an affordable and relatively accessible beer, making it a contender for the ""everyday gueuze"" category. However, when it was compared with the big boys, this really fell short. Although I would have never realized this if I were not doing a side by side, this beer is better than Golden Blend IMO. An excellent all around beer, and a notch above the Cantillon Classic.","lunarbrew","Dec 02, 2013"

4.67,6.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy gold with three fingers of fluffy white head that grew higher as it sat. Quite nice. Scents of sour green apple, lemon juice, barnyard funk, white wine, lactic sour, hints of pear, very faint hints of bubblegum, touches of oak, slight yeasty funk, funk-notes become more assertive as the beer warms, and as it warms further a bit of honey comes through. Very nice, deep, complex, sour and appetizing with a range of scents. Flavor begins with a massive hit of sour, lemon juice, crab apple, a bit of funky musty flavors, some vinegar notes, some slight hits of lemon rind, quite acidic, a tiny hit of herbal bitterness and oak as the sip finishes, extremely dry finish. The beer showcases sourness over all else, the fruit on the nose is not all that present in the taste. It's certainly a very, very sour beer, well blended with an excellent character for those who love sours. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a moderate level of carbonation, a very drying finish and a puckering sourness. Refreshing, tart, and drying, making you want to take sip after sip. Overall this is an excellent geuze. It's a bit single note, not incredibly complex in it's flavor, but the flavor is good. A nice lively sour that puckers the mouth and works with the mouthfeel to make a wonderfully refreshing beer. Highly recommended.","Auraan","Oct 11, 2013"

The nose comprises lemon zest, lime zest, apricot, light sour pineapple, very light cracked wheat, and a more-than-healthy helping of Brett-like funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with the tarter fruit notes covered o'er by a thick pall of musty funk (or is it funky must?), creating a deeply-layered liquid cake of complexity. At any given moment, you can get some sour lemon, some Swiss-esque cheese, some straight cobweb funky magic, or grass-flowers. Sometimes, all of it will come at you at once; those are the great times. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine gueuze, one that deserves the reputation it commands.","TMoney2591","Sep 16, 2013"

They both were completely different experiences in this beer. Awesome beer, it was great to share and talk about with a friend. I recommend it and definitely share with someone. Hope to try this again someday.","Benish","Beers"

Not overpowering in the aroma department. Flavor is delicious funk, a little bit of sweetness, and moderate acidity. Some lemon rind and nectarine. The sour lingers more than the Tilquin that im drinking side by side. Would like some more bubbles but the lower level of carb is probably true to style.

Smells is funk and horse blanket, citric, apricot. Taste is sourness, funk, leathery, some fruitiness. Very spritzy and light on the tongue. Nice and refreshing. I had this before and liked it, but this time it really knocked it out of the ballpark. The age has done it really well. Really not too sour and this great carbonation.

4.52,3.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"1000th review! 375 ml bottle with black foil into tulip glass, bottled 12/12/2009. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up retaining the head. Aromas of huge tart apple, lemon, pear, grass, hay, leather, pepper, earth, oak, funk, and yeast spices. Amazing aromas with huge complexity and balance. Taste of big tart lemon, apple, grass, hay, pear, pepper, earth, oak, funk, and yeast spices. Fair amount of tartness and sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, grass, hay, pepper, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of flavors, with an excellent balance of sourness and sweetness. Fairly dry on the finish as expected. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly acidic, and very crisp and prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish.

The brut style carbonation was spot on, like a good dry champange. Taste was solid, but not mind blowing. Russian River sours carry more complexity, which is really what we are looking for right? Great mouthfeel, it help counteract any distaste for the vinegar taste. Overall I would like top climb up the ladder of this brewery and try some Armand and the Kreik.","unclejazz","Jan 21, 2012"

Each and every sip of this was a joy and the funk definitely did not overshadow any of the subtle complexities of the aged lambic. After sipping from the glass that had the beginning and end of the bottle, it's easily much different than what I had in my drinking glass, which I guess does lend itself to the belief that it should be consumed separately (or not at all according to some brewers, but I won't go that far.) This separate glass was a bit more bitter, didn't have as much fruit zest in it, and was a bit more heavier.","nhindian","Aug 25, 2011"

The flavor has a very slight sweetness to it as well as a medium level of sourness. Pale malt and funk, oak and earth. I’m not going to go into the delicious yet disgusting farm descriptors, but they worked well. Nice palate, lively yet not overly acidic, with medium body. Rather refreshing when cold.

It settles to a clingy half inch that doesn't quite grab on to the glass strongly enough to deposit any lace. Its surprisingly mild aroma contributes lemons, malt and a dash of funk. Prominent acids and esters on the palate, with a lactic acid twang, cherry, lemons, earth and an oak presence. The body is nearly full at times, with loads of carbonation, an oaky dryness and a sour finish.

Wow, this beer is even more tart and funky tasting than I expected it to be. The taste is just like the aroma, it's tart, musty and earthy.

Poured a hazy yellow orange with a half finger pure white head that subsided to none very quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, tart, slight sour, and decent funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, tart, sour, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Definitely a lot of funk going on in this one. It actually overpowered my buddy's palate some with all of the funk, but I found it to be balanced with a slight edge given to the funk. Definitely a good aroma going on here.

This beer pours a hazy bruised orange with a massive 3 inch cap that leaves sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. A good 1/2 inch head sticks around the the entirety of the pour. The aroma is fantastic. At first whiff fresh oak comes through with citric fruit tanginess and just a bit of barnyard funk. Surprisingly just a hint of vanilla comes through at the very tail of the nose. I can only imagine it comes from the oak. The flavor is very balanced. Citric tartness hits the back of the jaw, reminding me of fresh grapefruit mixed with pineapple sweetness. Musty barnyard combined with fresh oak. The mouthfeel is much creamier then most gueuzes but it finishes dryly like any good gueuze. Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze is quite a bit different then most gueuzes I've had.

Tight-bubbled head abounded, a bit less frothy than memories of younger bottles. Less lees than expected. The color gave another hint of its age, with a touch more dark copper glinting through the hay hue of a younger version. The nose was surprisingly less lambic-funky, with a cleaner citrus zest and grass aroma. The taste and mouthfeel remain, foremost, highly acidic. The tang is turned down slightly from a fresher version. The flavors jumping out at me were of peach and other yellow fruits, with a cleansing herb-y note that felt more than tasted of coriander. I'm surprised to say that I wish (almost) that I'd given it a couple more years to see if it would mellow out further. You can see the theme all through this that it didn't evolve as much as I expected, and had further to go. With Drie Fonteinen switching from blender to brewer, it's all the more important to maintain and preserve those old bottles (and yes to drink them, not archive them).","ManforallSaisons","Nov 22, 2010"

Thick clouds of lacing are present during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose is tart, acidic and expresses a hint of cork and wood. Taste consistent with nose - lots of citric acid from the start to middle, with the earthy/cork quality coming out towards the back.

Taste follws scent almost to the t - dont ask me how i know what earthy, wood and leaves taste like, but this is it.

The foam fizzles down to a ring and wisps across the top leaving some lace down the sides. The aroma is dominated by pears and tart apples but has hints of spicy farmhouse ale characteristics. The taste is where this beer truly shines. Certainly tart pear and apples up front, but for all of the tartness that exists here, there is an equal amount of sweetness in balance. There is a bit of hay/barnyard type of flavors in the finish as well. The body is light-medium with full effervescent carbonation that adds to the body. It is amazing how drinkable this beer is. You really get a nice tartness but it is wonderfully refreshing and not overpowering. Instead of fearing the tartness of the next drink, your palate feels refreshed and eager for another taste.

Second sip is much more subdued once all my tastebuds have been smached to bits. Dry, tart cherries in vanilla and oak flavor. Rich and effervescent.

Very delicate and champagne-like up front with a sour lambic wallop that hits you hard. The mouthfeel is really light and airy, but surprisingly substantial. Does not come off as watery at all, which is remarkable given its light body and crisp, bubbly texture. The drinkability is very good, although the sour finish will put some off.

Flavor is composed of a strong, sharp, piquant sourneess, with dishes of reduced apple juice and a fine sherry vinegar. Lots of horses, and dry, oaky cherry pits.

Behind the tart fruity esters there is the faintest hint of cherry sweetness coming through in the background. The intitial taste is a blast of sour, woody funk. The sourness is pretty intense but does soften some after a few sips. The finish fades somewhat with a dry cheese-like touch. Nice flavor, but lacking the mix of fruits evident in the aroma. The mouthfeel is light and smooth, with semi-sharp carbonation. This is a very nice Gueze and one of my favorites, not that I have tried many.

Its very expressive at that point, compared to a full huge froth, which doesnt reveal much, or a small, filmy head, which is still pretty vibrant, but not quite as expressive. It releases a very fruit filled aroma with hints of apples, orange and grapefruit along with an unbelievably woody scent which hints of freshly cut, burnt and white wine stained wood and a touch of leather. The flavor is so fruit filled, almost like a platter of full, gummy fruits or a packet of fruit snacks, with easily detectable notes of peach, nectarine, and grapefruit and perhaps a light hint of apple. All supported by a very firm maltiness, a clean, yet approachable tartness and an extraordinary wood barrel character. Wow, what artful balance. Armand is the man. Its amazing he can choose a blend between Girardin, Oud Beersel, Hanssens...etc...and come up with a blend like this. While I find some gueuze unexciting (Frank Boons Oud Beersel and Franks Boons lambics in general), some a bit harsh (A few of Cantillons offerings; Fou Foune, Gueuze, although I do love some) and some a bit plain (Hanssens), I find Drie Fonteinen unbelievable almost each time.

Flavor is hugely complex, acidic, sharp and sour citrus fruit, funky cheese and something indescribeable that I have never experienced in any other beer. Smooth on the palate, finishes very dry. This gueuze has such a unique character, it is a real shame that I only have one bottle. Quite nice.","kmcnair","Aug 10, 2005"

4.17,-4.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"1999... Upon removing the cork, I got a very small pop, and I was even able to put the cork back into the bottle! Poured a slightly hazy golden color with a medium sized white creamy head with nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of herbs, brett, vinegar, stinky socks and wood. The taste was very sour, but also included lots of oak, cinnamon, some apple, watermelon, grapefruit, and lemon peel. While it was very sour, it seemed to lack the depth I like to find in a world class gueuze.","egajdzis","Beers"

4.75,8.4,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear orangey color lambic with a huge slightly off-white head with excellent retention. Aroma of barnyard and sourness is quite evident. Taste is so well balance between sourness, tart, little bit of acidity, green apple with some nice funky yeast also thrown in. Probably one of the finest Lambic that I had the chance to try and the fact that the acidity is lower then Cantillon makes it easier to drink larger quantity.","Phyl21ca","Jun 11, 2005"
4.39,0.2,4,5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"The mouthfeel was very tart yet rounded and very firm. Flavours of fruit (mentioned above in the aromas) and caramelly sweetness dominated through a spritzy and quenching effervescence. Tart finish accented by a fresh bitterness made this beer somewhat less drinkable than a hefeweizen but still very pleasant if you are a fan of gueuze. I shall order many bottles of this brew when I have a chance. The smell was just too much.","Beersignal","Jun 10, 2005"
4.48,2.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"April 2009 update: Popped open another of the 2002 bottles. Mellowed out even more. The acidity is VERY subdued. Clarity is really good. I don't detect the peachy notes anymore, but it is still a bit fruity with cork, sourdough, and buttery notes. The distinct flavors described in the original review have mellowed to the point that you can't really discern them anymore. Still a brilliant geuze! And I am sad to say that this is one of only 4 remaining in my ""cellar"".","GreenCard","Jun 03, 2005"

4.83,10.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"April 2001 Vintage. Wow what a noisy beer. I chose a champagne flute and it was the right choice to channel the creamy and noisy head. The bubbles just kept rising so I could only pour half the flute. This is not over the top in lambic funkiness or tartness but the nose does give you fair warning that this is not cider. The taste is wonderful and close second to my favorite cantillon gueuze. There are a complex set of flavors - blue cheese, honey, apple, melon and pear cider. The one drawback is price which i think was $18.00 at Plumpjack.","lou91","Jan 12, 2005"

Hazy golden, with a perfect white head. good barnyard and blue cheese thing going on in the aroma. Flavor has a slightly soured blue cheese thing going on as well. Malty smooth palate. Rich in funky flavor, man. Really cheesey. Now I get cheddar, very sharp cheddar, in the finish. I guess I can just sit here and twist all of the flavors and aromas into different things and maybe even write a book. Must get back to my source (top secret) and snag other vintages for sampling.","vladtheimpaler","Jan 01, 2005"

4.38,0,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottled 12/11/2000. Bottle lists ABV at 5.0%. Pours a slightly murky golden peach color with a pillowy, volumnous white head. Poured carefully into a traditional gueuze tumbler, Boon to be exact. The aroma is outstanding. I'm sensing a lot of depth in this beer. Lots of funkiness ranging from cheese to mushroom to mildew. Citrus rind, cilantro, earthy, like a field of grain, old gym sock, gunpowder, wet wood, a bagful of pennies, and sour all can describe nuances of this beer's aroma. Upon suggestion of the first sip, my initial assumation that the beer is complex is confirmed. It is not bone-jarringly dry, yet retains a mellow residual sweetness underneath the complex layers of tastes that assault the palate. It's rather unique in a way I'm not sure I can describe. It is sour, in a way that comes across as metallic as well as barnyardy, earthy and floral. Very, very nice beer altogether, and just about the best gueuze I've tried to date.","crookedhalo","Aug 01, 2004"
4.7,7.3,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"An earthier lambic than many, this gueuze has a special apples-rotting-on-the-pavement sort of tartness. A bit bitter through the finish, lemon makes a strong appearance here in all its forms -- mild lemon acidity and flavor early on and very slight citric and plant bitterness at the end. Either I'm getting better at plucking nuance out of a potent style, or this simply has a lot of unique, subtle characteristics. I'm guessing the latter.","marburg","Jul 31, 2004"

Huge farmy character, blue cheese and horseblanket like. Terrific cleanliness and honesty. Very easy to drink gueuze, if only it were cheaper... or just available here in Canada. Awesome product of course, but as close to the top 50 as this is, I was expecting a bit more distinctive qualities. Undeniable refreshing qualities are helped by the medium-high carbonation which supports a big medium body. Once again thanks to this pleasure provider named hopsrus. This was a 99 bottle.

4.24,-3.2,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"1999 Vintage - It pours a dark gold with some orange tint, but it is a bit too hazy to look nice. Of course the look of this beer is by far the worst characteristic. The big head even seems to dissipate too fast. The aroma is musty, barnyard, apple, and lemon zest. I am salivating already. The sourness is big and up front, then the horseblanket coats my tongue before the honey and floral notes that fade to a dry yeasty finish. An excellent gueuze. I can't wait to try the other vintages that I have stashed away.","ark57","Mar 19, 2004"
4.5,2.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"1999 vintage. 750ml bottle, drank in the comfort of me own home. A nice golden brew, that borders on orange. A huge white head that settles down to a skim on the perimeter of the brew. The aromas are sweet, reminiscent of gueuze, and yet also mead at the same time. Ever have mead the gueuze? Well, this smells like that should smell. Similar, yet with much more going on. The taste is awesome! A nice blend of pure lambic funk and sweet honey-like tones. The acid is ahrp and biting, but whisked away on wings of honey. The mouthfeel is sharp and acidic, but not ""biting"" and the drinkability is excellent!","francisweizen","Feb 07, 2004"

4.8,9.6,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Bought the 2001 bottling based on how damn delicious the 1999 was that My Shelton rep. Ron introduced me to. The cork shot out of this bottle like a rocket and traveled a good 15 yards before settling to earth-a nice carry! The pour was more than ambitious and proffered up a very energetic, and bouncy head that lasted just long enough for the eye and subsided quickly enough for the tongue to take over. Aromas were perfectly sour with saddle leather and old wood, and a lingering twang that begged to be tasted. In the mouth this beer expanded like a rocket with each sip filling the mouth with light and vibrant foam. The flavors were deep and complex, all the while being airy, light and highly refreshing-much like a fine Champagne. Sour as hell but smooth as silk and balanced like a champ-this was a delight to taste, and I'll be tasting another as soon as I can muster up the cash. Don't miss it!","moulefrite","Dec 29, 2003"
4.45,1.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The color before decanting a limpid golden orange and after decanting a bemused golden orange with the head a majestic crown upon that vaporous golden orange body which is spumous in texture and a somewhat off white color, and the resultant lace a silky veil to hide the glass from prying eyes. The first aroma that of peaches, sweet and sour, almost astringent, crisp and pleasing to both the ocular and olfactory senses, start is modestly sweet, dry, hints of lemon with the top light but pleasingly so. Finish is amaroidal, but once again pleasingly so, an integral part of the style, a bit of the hops I think shows through at the back of the palate, so very tart it puckers the mouth, but its just part of the majesty of the style, what a treat, and this may be sacrilegious, but I like this Lambic much more than any Ive ever sampled including but not limited to Cantillon.","Gusler","Nov 18, 2003"
4.57,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Bottled 1999. Murky amber hue. Lean, but well retained cream white head leaves loose, meandering lace. The aroma is comprised of pungently overripe, moldy peach along with bile acid tones. Softens steadily as it breathes, with softer citric, sour lemon notes and earthy, humus tones providing delicate contrast. In flavor, Brett wastes no time, and envelops the palate with damp horseblanket and dirty hay. Barbed, acetic, sherry wine vinegar pierces through, and the stubborn wild yeast relinquishes its hold. Fruit, of an obviously tart underripe nature, ensues in the form of cranberry juice and nappy crabapple. Gentle, buttermilk like lactic notes manage to eek in as well and provide a gentle curdled skim milk impression. Very well attenuated, yet with a softly dextrinous mouthfeel. Trace, bitter lemon rind notes surface late along with simply tart, malic acid hints. Do lambics undergo malolactic conversion? If so, this fine brew should become unbelievably smooth with additional cellaring. Finishes with a snap of pear like sweetness, but otherwise with a puckering, parching kumquat like citric acidity. A dynamic, truly delicious brew of which I enjoyed every ml. Superb enough in drinkability... I could easily go for 1500 ml. My willpower caved in. I was planning on aging this. It's a tough life...","marc77","Oct 29, 2003"

4.83,10.3,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"After I had ordered the Gueuze the waitress went to the bar and requested a one. The barkeep then pulled out the traditional bottle of Lambic lying at a 15-degree angle in a wicker basket. The bottle was carefully opened and poured without disturbing the yeast. The beer when it was set down in front of me displayed a lively carbonation, a gold color, slightly hazy and a thick creamy head. Even from a distance the aroma was evident; displaying notes of fruit including citrus. When brought closer for an extended sniff it smelled quite sour with an evident Brett character. The taste was just about perfect. It was not as sour as Oud Beersel's Gueuze and was incredibly complex, with notes of wood, mustiness, a slight bitterness and almost a hint of what I can only describe as wild mushroom. This was definitely the best Gueuze I had ever had.","Gueuzedude","0"

The aroma is wonderful. Musty. Lemony. Grassy. Citric. Horse Blanket. Just a little bubblegum. Damn fine. The body is light and the mouthfeel is airy. A little fizzy. This taste can be likened to the outer layer a sour gobstopper. It is acidic beyond belief. Citrus flavors and lemongrass make their presence know. Some cider. On scale of 1-10, this would get a 9 maybe 9.5 for its mouthpuckering ability. Tart as all get out. Just a little of the horseblanket on the buds.
