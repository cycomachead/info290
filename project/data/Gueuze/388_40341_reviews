"Tastes of tart funk, matured white grape skin, musty, old lime and a dry touch of oaken Cognac. While the beer has a distinct, slightly fruity wooden character, its typical sourness is a bit subdued. The wooden aspect contains  a slight sweetness of fermented apples, leading to a medium body with low carbonation."

"Another overly hyped Cantillon. Sorry but just tastes like vinegar"
""

"Verdict: I can't say I'm loving this one. Enjoyable for sure, unique and creative, but the cognac is really assertive and for my palate, too sweet and too rich for a gueuze or a lambic. A novel experiment that achieves minor success, but a bit lacking complexity and balance."

"Huge thanks to Thirtybird for send this one over.  2012 vintage.  Slightly hazy golden yellow with a consistent, bright white head.  Nose is musty, citrusy and slightly grassy.  Some wood, but surprisingly little Cognac.  Taste is on par with nose.  Mouthfeel is light with a bright carbonation and a pleasant acidity, light tartness and semi-dry finish.  Solid beer, but not my favorite from this brewer."

"A low carbonation lambic with lemon and grass in the front. However, the beer changes with a European hop flavor and then heavy floral notes and sweet honey on the back end."

"D - Overall, this was disappointing, but given within the context of Cantillon; outside of this brewery's context it is still a damn good beer. Worth the trouble to get? Probably not."

"Cleverly done and deceptively complex. While the Coganc influence causes a diminution of the gueuze character, the subtle interplay between the two is quite intriguing."
"Bottle courtesy cparles, shared at Collected Works tasting. Incredible aroma, just everything you want gueuze to be. Very fruity with prominent vinous and lemon notes, with a significant horsey funk. Not quite as cobwebby/basementy as some gueuzes but I like this better. Flavor is similar, unripe wine grapes, lemon, lime pulp, straw and wet wood, cognac influence really brightens the beer. Just lovely."
""
"Unique and highly differentiated from their standard range."
""
"O. This is my first 'rarer' Cantillon, and it lived up to what I was expecting."
""

""
""
""

""
""
""

"Overall - The barrel adds complexity, even if I can't really distinguish it."
""
""
""
"O – A very interesting twist on the standard gueuze, and for the most part very successful. As an everyday beer, I would probably prefer the standard, but this is definitely an enjoyable take on the style."
"Easy drinking, bright on the palate as expected and a nice finish overall. It is a great drinker. The liquor is present on the palate and the oak bitterness is in the finish. Dry overall but not harsh. I enjoyed this beer a lot too bad it is so difficult to obtain."
""
""
""
""
""
"Unlabeled bottle, 50 degrees etched on. Golden orange body, fizzy carbonation. Cognac barrel is completely evident, less tart than the standard gueuze but a well rounded flavor profile that I assume will improve with age as the barrel wears and the gueuze ages. Nice notes of vanilla, lemon and that funky cantillon yeast. I brought a bottle home to consume in a few years."

"O - Solid Cantillon where the cognac shines thru and adds a light boozy mustiness to it"
""
""
""
""
"O: A little rough around the edges at this point. I think it needs some time to let the Cognac meld into the beer and some of the funk to come up. Still a really nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have to say, I was really disappointed with this one. Exciting to try, but not what I hoped for. I am curious as to how this will age... I hope it retains the cognac flavors, yet the alcohol bite that compliments them dimishes. Looking forward to revisiting in a few years, because this is far too young right now."

"Overall quite nice, still nice Cantillon kick bit more mild than most, and drinkable, less funk and fruit, but a nice beer and very unique. For a gueuze it's quite unique."
""
""
"O-This is a great beer and a pleasant surprise for me. Like most Cantillon, it has that vinous complexity, and I think the less tart more caramel aspects only enhance the flavors here."
""
"Delicious, but I don't think the price/rarity/hunt for this one is worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with fruit and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with fruit and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."
""
"M- smooth on the palate with a dry finish"
""
"O- Truly delicious. This is definitely the most unique, and also one of the tastiest, lambics I've had. The cognac barrel character is really delicious and complements the tart, funky lambic flavors in a way I didn't expect. A stunning beer."

"Review #1800!!! Big thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one during a fair sized Cantillon tasting! 2007 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon balloon. Poured fluorescent orange with a minimal white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, funk, fruit, wood, spice, tart, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, BIG sour, acidic, sweet fruit, and tart. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really surprised when I heard that this one would be at our tasting that evening. A sour aged in cognac barrels is all it took for me to start drooling over this one before even opening it. After all the time this one has had to age I really wasn’t expecting much of the barrel flavors to be around, however it was still there with a nice sweet fruit aspect that you would get off a good cognac. Really impressive. When I say BIG sour, I really meant it. This one had a whole new level of sour when compared to the other Cantillon brews tasted that night as it almost knocked you off your feet. Really glad I got the chance to try this one and would love to do so again in the future if the opportunity presents itself. I suggest you do the same."
"Pours murky and still for a lambic --- murky probably because the pour was from the later end of the bottle. Still because... I am not sure. Regardless, the carbonation was just fine on the palate. Smells funky, very hay like. My buddy commented that this beer alone is enough to justify the 'barnyard' adjective, or something along those lines. The acidity is moderate in taste. There's lemon and then some nuttiness which is odd... I guess; but I liked that aspect. While different from other Gueuze and quite tasty, having had many 'loons in small quantities, I can safely say that as far as my tastes go, 3F is where it's at!"
"O: Not the greatest flavor profile and a little muted, but still a very delicious and drinkable beer."
"750 ml bottle generously shared by ipa247. Thanks Jeff. Pours a clear golden amber with no head. There are a couple of bubbles around the edge of the glass and no lacing. The aroma is funky with the cognac presence obvious and a bit of oak. There is also a light mushroom note. A bit of alcohol is there as well. It's not a lot, but more than any other lambic I've had. The initial taste has a light sweetness with a decent tartness. There is some funky oak, a bit of brandy, and some mushroom. The finish has some brandy and a bit of alcohol. Medium body. Low carbonation. Not bad, but certainly not my favorite Cantillon beer. It could have used a little more carbonation."

"O-Extremely unique gueuze by Cantillon. I know Jean hated how this turned out, but I liked it a lot. Can’t wait to open my bottle."

"Well I had another bottle of this and my opinion has changed a bit. The second bottle had an amazing combination of citrus acidity, heavy funk, and a pretty wild edge from the cognac barrel. About as good as the 2007 Classic."
"Chilled 750 decanted without yeast or sediment and shared with friends. Pours a light gold with a thin white head. The nose is full of funk, raw fruit, wood and sweet grapes. The taste is acidic and funky as expected with a bit of sulfur too. Mouth feel is light with a medium carbonation to high carbonation, a dry finish and a warming finish in the throat--probably from the acidity. The finish includes waves of light fruit with brilliant tartness, subtle brandy, and woody vanilla. I did pick up some subtle vinous notes in the smell and taste, but the cognac clearly takes a backseat to all other characteristics of the Gueuze. With that said, it was still incredibly enjoyable."
"Review revisited - this beer is fantastic. Like a deeper, earthier and cognac influenced version of an Armand '4."
"overall - wow. I really hope they make this again soon. no sign of this dropping off anytime soon."
"I don't like the word unique as a descriptor, but this is certainly different, and 50N-4E has depth to it. Having had this next to Crianza, I have to say I probably prefer that beer to this one, maybe because (contra most people's experiences) there's a bit too much cognac character here for me. And the acetone on the nose is hugely off-putting."
"Looking back at this rating, I need to have this beer again. Would be cool to drink next to Crianza Helena."
"O - Quite a nice brew, though it is not as good as Cuvee des Champions which preceded it."
"Overall, I tried as hard as I could to pinpoint the cognac but the only barrel influence I found was from the oak. The funk in this beer is great as is almost always the case with Cantillon, but the subtleties of the fruit flavors set this one apart. Well worth a shot."
"Cheers!"
"Pretty mellow on the sourness. Really smooth and tasty."
"o - Overall another great Cantillon beer in my opinion; there beers continue to live up to my expectations. Would love to have it again sometime."
"This is the second amazing cognac barrel-aged brew I have had this year. I'm not necessarily a big fan of cognac, per se, but apparently, when done right, it can really invigorate a beer and add a wealth of complexity and flavor."
"O: Drinking very well. The flavor and aroma were quite complex and pleasing, perhaps just lacking a little bit more assertiveness. With that said, I don't see this improving much with age other than perhaps resolving a little bit of the balance between funk and tartness. That said, I also can't see it going downhill either."
"D: Among a field of incredibly hyped and well-regarded gueuzes, this was a big surprise. Just very well balanced and executed overall with almost nothing to complain of. Complexity and feel are spot. Well worth seeking out and I hope to find a few more to see what age will do to this beauty."
"D: Very drinkable, puckering could be a limiting factor, but I imagine that if you're able to try this beer, you're a fan of that aspect of the style. This is definitely another great Cantillon; worth sharing."
"The taste delivers at the same level with strong barnyard funk coming out strong straight out of the gate. There is a boozy cognac presence that really accentuates the sour components of this brew in what is just a fantastic job of blending and aging. I love the feel and the finish is superb. Thanks again to Eric for really going above and beyond, opening some world-class brews that I thought I would have to wait awhile to try, let alone having a single generous BA open them all in one night."
"Lightly carbonated compared with standard Cantillon gueuze, making a slightly bigger mouthfeel that works well with the agressive flavor. Cantillon is always so solid, if you EVER see it I highly recommend it."
"D - Wow. Had two pours of this funky stuff. The taste lingered with me long after I was finished. Very unique and cool offering by the one and only Cantillon."
"Taste is very funky and tart, but still very drinkable. Its gt a very nice amount of sour that won't kill your pallate so quick, very tasty."
"D - This was excellent, but the cognac note made things feel a little boozier than I expected from lambic (just noticed the slightly higher ABV). It's also growing very acetic, and I was getting protests from my stomach as we worked through the bottle. Still, it's highly recommended, IF you can still find it."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, although the tartness will get to you after a while."
"I had this from a 750ml bottle at dld. The beer looks like any lambic, cloudy hazy medium brown, nice light carbonation. The aroma is really nice, likes of sour funk horse blanket but nicely balanced with some sweetness, I think that's the cognac, very similar to the taste. Has a little acidity and vinegar to it, very nice overall."
"Mouthfeel: perhaps a bit too light on the carbonation. THe barrels do give it a nice structured element."
"I can't say that I am picking up a ton of cognac flavor, though it has lent a tiny hint of alcohol bite through the back? This is a great beer though, what else would you expect from Cantillon? A very nice and complex concoction, I hope I get another chance to try it in the future."
"2007 Vintage. The cork eases out, perfectly spongy & in tact with a muted pop.. immediately the aroma of funk starts to emanate. Poured into gueuze tumblers with a robust, seafoam-like head with lingering retention. Nose is musty & bretty, reminiscent of a horse stable on a cool summer night. The bacteria has a pronounced and complex flavor, followed by the subtle undertone of cognac. The lambic essence is so deep and rich, the effort is perfectly executed with a touch of warmth on the back end.The barnyard resonance transcends into faint booziness, which could almost be confused as lingering oak from the barrel. If you observe closely, theres really something more here. The small nuances are what really puts this in distant perspective with other Cantillon Gueuze of the same vintage...made from the same loom, but certainly a different fabric. Makes everything else in life fade into nothingness..Truly a world class offering!"
"There are white peaches and pear skins, though. Plus the yellow woodsorrel present in most of Cantillon's catalog. And like their other lambics, 50N by 4E is moderately carbonated, generous with its wood, and pleasantly rank. But what's this in the finish, heat? In a lambic? Maybe some of that cognac rubbed off after all."
"D: The cognac barrels really do provide a bit of something different, even if there is not necessarily a lot of cognac flavor in the beer. A very interesting (and good0 lambic, and you'd expect nothing less from Cantillon."
"This beer displays an astonishing amount of complexity... The evolution and change in flavours from just a few degrees is phenomenal. Highly recommended, and a definite favourite."
"Overall, an amazing sour. Very well done and I really want more. I highly recommend this one. Very unique."
"Overall, a job well done by Cantillon on this one."
"Definitely a subdued lambic, don't expect a sour kick to the mouth either. If this hadn't followed Hommage, I'm sure I would have liked it more, unfortunately it can't hold a candle to the wind yet is still very drinkable, probably more so in larger volumes."
"2007 cork date consumed in early 2009. Pours a bright golden-copper with orange leaning hues and a thin white head that bubbles and then dies away. Aroma is of dried hay and pears, currants, apples, and lemons that have all been sitting in a big old pot of funk. Mustiness and horse blanket. Taste is more oaky than most Cantillon but still nothing comparable to many over oaked American attempts at this and similar styles. Tannic acid melds with the general fruitiness of the beer to create a chardonnay like vinous quality. Green apple and pears play a roll and at times there are touches of the tropics in here. Grape fruit finishes things off. The mouthfeel is quite sour but not over the top. Instead of a straight pow to the palate, this beer leaves a lasting but mellower sourness on the tongue. Aggressive carbonation keeps things fairly light."
"Bottle in trade from Netherlands. Outstanding beverage. Funky yet appealing nose draws you in, yeasty. Appearance of grapefruit with decent white head, and lacey Taste is extremely smooth balanced sourness and cognac in secondary.Great drinkability.Listed at 5%"
"Immensely drinkable, this 750 is not going to be a problem. In fact, it's going to suck that that's all I have of this splendid beer. Note to self - buy every Cantillon beer, no matter how negative some reviews might be"
"D: The flavor is very well balanced, here. It is predominantly sour and dry, but not intensely acetic and unpleasant on the palate. Funk is a supporting flavor, and the impressive palette of fruity flavors gives this some real depth. But I still have no grasp what the cognac barrels added, here -- besides a substantial price premium."
"D-certainly interesting but it is so chaotic I find it hard to actually enjoy for long. I appreciate the opportunity to try but found it no better than some of the other easier to find sours I have had."
"""So I shouldn't say this smells like diaper pail?"""
"D: Tasty as hell, I want more. Thanks to Capones for supplying me this bottle."
"T&M: The taste is similarly amazing, alternating between funk, sweetness, tannins and sharp sourness. Lemons, green apples, apricots, salt, vanilla; so complex yet so harmonious. The barrel lends a hint of Cognac along with a slight and very welcome heat. The finish is dry, tannic, sharp and lingering. This is one of the most unique lambics I've had, and surely one of the best."
"D: I really like this one. A fantastic lambic with a rather unique character due to the cognac flavor. The cognac delivers a very sophisticated edge to the beer. Among the best beer I've had from this fantastic brewery, and that says quite a lot."
"Light bodied with a low level of carbonation, which I was pleased with. Another great beer from Cantillon."
"M&D: very mild on the carbonation, superbly rounded and smooth on the palate and only a little alc. could be sensed after many a sip; I think this one has become one of my two favourite Lambic/Geuze by Cantillon (the other being ""Iris""), for totally different reasons of course. The finest touch of this lambic rests on its integrity and a delicate input of cognac barrels, while keeping a smooth yet still reasonably complex profile of the lambic base. Honestly, the best of both worlds is somewhat attained in this bottle. (Q: why does the label refer it to a Geuze, if it was unblended?)"
"would love to make this a way of life to truly understand the delicate touch yet i don't think i'm buying this one again at 30 buck a bottle..."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Easy on the palate, and good mouthfeel and taste. Exceptional Lambic!"
"The pour was nice, rich amber in color with a light haziness and a nice lift puff of white on top. Lots of funk here as I take the first whiff off the top of it. Rich vinegar aroma with a hint of grapes and light apples. As I take the first sip, lips pucker and the huge sour funky flavor comes right through. LOts of light fruit notes buried under a wall of apple vinegar like flavor. Very dry in the finish with a nice smooth delivery and a good medium feel to it. Smooth, sessioanble, and a nice sipper at the same time, another winner form Cantillon for sure. I am glad I sought this one out as I nice sour sipper is what I needed at this point in time."
"D- This is the easiest drinking unblended lambic I have drank. There is a nice flavor and a good balance of sweet and tart and other flavors adding to the complexity."
"Pours a hazy golden yellowis orange color with a thin fizzy white head. Tart and funky aroma with hints of oak and whiskey. Puckering but not too acidic. Lighter bodied than most gueze. Probably a result of the aging. Nicely balanced, somewhat malty with light carbonation and light crisp fruit. The oak and cognac really come through making this a really unique gueze. Excellent!"
"Notes from and tasted on 9/27/08."
"Very light golden orange color with a small, white head. Aroma smells of traditional Cantillon lambic with a very, very light added hint of cognac. Flavor is aged, well blended lambic with just the slightest note of cognac. Lacking the softness I would prefer and mainly just harsh, oude gueuze. A bit off balance and with out cognac character."
"Pours golden with a soft white head. Aroma is sour lemon, barnyard but not overpowering. Not as sour as I thought considering some of the other gueuzes out there. Flavor is well balanced with some earthy notes that linger throughout and in the finish. Finished semi-dry but not mouthpuckering. A complex and well done beer. So, so glad i have two of these the price tag was worth getting two."
"D-Extremely smooth-drinking w/complexity and finesse."
"D: Awesome, well rounded, funky but super smooth and substantial. Maybe I am in the minority here, but this is something different from Cantillon and a welcome addition to their lineup for me. I find this a flawless brew and possibly the most interesting of the Cantillon brews."
"Drinkability was ok, I didn't like the rich booziness of the cognac with the lambic, perhaps with more age it would smooth out and gain more sourness. I'm always happy to try a rare, expensive beer, but sometimes their rarity leads them to being over-hyped, which I would say is probably the case here."
"Good, but if you've got 'em, give 'em some time."
"Had no idea what this beer was until I traded for it but that was the fun in it all, a little skeptical after seeing it was a lambic aged in cognac barrels, seemed like two very odd tastes as one but it did work well, Cantillon is truly a great brewery, would definitely drink this again, recommended"
"Pours a hazy golden with a nice initial head that fades to a ring. This beer is labeled 2007, so it is still a little young. It should integrate a little more and become a bit funkier as time goes on. As is, it is quite nice, but each component still stands apart instead of being well blended into a harmonious whole. Somewhat fubky and acetic up front and with a finish that is both a tiny bit sweet with vanilla from the oak and has a nice ring of cognac in the finish as well. It is a little unusual, especially the hint of sweetness after the laser-like sourness that Cantillon is known for, but it really seems to work. The aromas are a bit more subdued than the taste, but they both work, with the taste being particularly tart and somewhat funky with an earthy minerality in addition to the sour, oak, and cognac. Nice beer, I'll be interested to try this again in a few years."
"Pours a fogged gold with a thin creme head. Nose is funky. Kind of a citric acidity there. Flavor is interesting. Noticeable bite from wood aging and cognac. Almost seems to carry a bit of an apple tone to it. Crisp and slightly biting overall. The combination of lambic funk, wood aging, and cognac makes for an interesting combination. Feel is kind of sticky slick on the liquid and the carbonation is fairly low. Overall pretty nice to drink. A bit of a bite to it, but still good."
"I am really surprised how mellow the barrel character is here, the cognac must have stripped out a lot of those oak flavors. This is a very well balanced beer; the barrel plays a significant supporting role here, sourness of course takes the lead, but not excessively so (this is not as hard as some Cantillon's) and the funk is definitely a supporting character. I like that this was lightly carbonated, given that this is not a blended beer I was expecting a much flatter experience, but the soft carbonation definitely adds a nice touch to the texture. Quite the tasty beer, I certainly wouldn't mind having a lot more of this in my cellar."
"No head on a yellowish gold pour. Smell is musty, band-aid like, and hoppy. Didn't get anything I would have identified as cognac though. Taste is tart, funky and nicely hoppy. Very light carbonation with a thin body. Sour but not intensely so, and a milder, thinner flavor than expected. Interesting, but not particularly wowing for the style. Just ok..."
"The taste in the beginning was tart, slightly medicinal along with a hot alcohol, cognac note. As the beer warmed, the citrus and cognac notes intensified and were really pleasing on the tongue. Overall this is a really solid and drinkable beer and another fine example of what Cantillon does."
"Drink: Oh yeah, very good on the drinkability, mostly due to the incredible balance of flavors."
"Definitely one to savor and take your time with..."
"Bought at Cantillon. Pours a light amber color with a decent head for the style. Aromas are decidedly tart with hints of oak and cognac-in which the beer is aged-cognac barrels. In the mouth the beer is silky smooth offering an aggressive note of wood and cognac. Damn this is a tasty treat! I'm so glad I brought this beauty home! Next stop for this beer is with a plate of homeade mussels and fries. Ahhh Belgium-ahhh Cantillon-a classic!"
"Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Aroma comes forth as some strong apple sauce in a hazlenut pie. Not particularly unique, however expressive and glowing, with all the wonderful worlds that wild fermentation creates, however finding a little bit of glowing crispness now. Pours with middle deep gold and a touch of haze. Flavor lands amongst fall leave, bright woody grain and a bowl of Mississippi cotton. White grape juice brings up the background of the palate. Breathing, this beer yield the true meaning of the barrel, in that, to me, I cannot really taste the barrel or the cognac in the beer, itself with their respective individual notes or characters. Instead, I can sense, deeply, that the barrel and the cognac has made this a better lambic, my mellowing, melding and bringing a new sense to an old favorite. Masterful and bold. A treat to try and my favorite of the night. Beer parts with a wisp of fresh pink grapefruit and a branch of a cherry tree. Thanks to whomever provided this fantastic beer."
