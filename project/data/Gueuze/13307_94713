4.04,-3.3,4,3.75,4.25,4,4,"When the bottle was opened there was a brief hiss, and the air filled with an intense skunk. Unfortunate, although the green bottle sure didn't help any. After 10-15 minutes, this dissipated and there was a more familiar farmhouse funk and wild yeast aroma akin to Cantillon. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if they cultured and pitched dregs from Cantillon bottles in this. Light aromas of cheese rind, damp wood, and soft lemon pith. It's pretty spot on in similarity to lambic, and there's little to no Sauternes character to it which was sort of a letdown. Clarity was fairly bright, carbonation was rapid, and there was a thin layer of crackling foam on the surface, depositing bits of lace here and there. Taste was bright and relatively sour, puckering lemony citrus and light dry oakiness round it out nicely. Overall it is worth a try, though miscategorized as a Gueuze.","emerge077","Apr 10, 2014"

4.23,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"Overall: Very tart, sour ale with a big lactic bite and a nice wine barrel presence. These barrels were definitely wet when filled with gueuze! Given the price of the bottle itâ€™s in with some stiff competition with beers of similar styles. Worth a shot though if you split the bottle/price with a friend.","CowsandBeer","Mar 04, 2014"

3.96,-5.3,3.75,4,4,3.75,4,"12.7 ounce bottle, dated 2012 on label. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy gold color with an inch and a half off-white head. The head lasts a little while, but there isn't much of any lacing at all. The brew smells like white grapes/wine, oak, funk, hay, and some apple. Taste is nice and tart, it tastes like oak, funk, white grapes/wine, hay, and some earthiness and vinegar. Mouthfeel/body is medium, with a moderate amount of carbonation. I like this beer overall, but it's not one of my favorite gueuzes. $15.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Feb 16, 2014"

3.75,-10.3,3.75,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Overall: A good beer but there is no doubt the Sauternes barrels take this beer over. Not as much of the tartness I hoped for. Highly recommend for a wine fan looking for a beer to their liking.","KFBR392","Jul 16, 2013"
4.51,7.9,4,4.75,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Pours a fairly pale yellow-orange color. It's somewhat cloudy, though I imagine careful bottle handling and pouring could render a clear glass. Medium white head. Pretty good bubblage for a sour. It smells like a gueuze, maybe somewhat young or, at least, from young barrels, but this is as close to lambic country as any non-lambic that I've tried. It's delicate and complex with layers of funk and gentle acidity. It has the lambic mineral character, sulfur and iron. Mushrooms, wet hay, grass, mild vinous vinegar. If you gave me this glass blind, I'd probably guess Drie Fonteinen or Girardin, based on the aroma. Knowing what it is, I'm getting a bit more oak than I'd expect from a lambic, but that could be bias creeping in. Lots of fruit - apricots, berries, peaches, lemons, limes, persimmons. I could smell this beer all day, which sounds kinda weird, admittedly. The taste starts with gentle fruity sweetness and very mild grain. Acidity creeps up slowly and the beer dries out completely by the finish. More lactic than acetic, but it's a lambic-y mix. The finish has a lot of oak. Nice tannic hit aftertaste. Lots of lemons, funk, grass, earth. Some wine sweetness, which takes away a touch from its lambic-ness, but again, I'm left wondering if I'd notice it blind. It's light on the palate with a medium pucker that sorta sneaks up on you. The tannic oakiness is a bit bracing. This is simply delicious. I wish that American breweries would take note and start pushing domestic sours in this direction. I imagine getting lambic flavors right is rather hard, but it's worth the effort. We need more lower abv, lambic-style sours.","popery","Jul 13, 2013"
