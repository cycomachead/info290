"Would pair beautifully with cheese."

"Ive had this before in a bottle and it sucked, this evening on draft it was amazing. Quite sour with wonderful flavor. Pricey, but def worth trying"
"Overall, an interesting beer. Quite tasty, but I prefer my gueuze without the robust hopping."
"A powerful, blasting sour one. I think i can hardly find some other that has an overall balance so exiciting. Simply love  it"

"Tart and citrusy, a hint of skunked hops, dry oaky aftertaste. Pretty acidic, taste seems slightly funky, something about it seems out of place however. Likely the green bottle skunkiness. It was pretty good but I wouldn't get it again unless it was fresh. Seems more like a wild ale than anything."

"Overall: As a fan of MIkkeller, I was expecting nothing but the best, but this collaboration with To Ã˜l had surpassed any and all expectations I had before trying this. In short, get this if you can - you'll not regret it."

"My gosh, this is probably the best geuze I've had yet. Finally one that's properly arbonated and doesn't just taste / feel like cheese water haha.. Yup, a great one.. No big surprise there.. These two breweries know what they're doing"

"375 ml bottle. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. The brew smells like oak, green apple, lemon zest, hay, and some citrusy/floral hops. It tastes like oak, funk, green apple, hay, bready malt, white grapes, peaches and some pear. This tastes better the longer I drink this. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it has a good amount of carbonation and it's easy to drink. I liked this brew a lot, although it's pricey at $14.99 a bottle. Definitely worth a try!"

"O: Interesting. Long list dry hops used had me expecting more floral and fruit, but the sourness and oaky/must stood out. Probably should have opened this sooner rather than holding on to it as long as I did. Enjoyed."

"Overall this was disappointingly not very sour. Interesting beer and worth a try, but not great."

"overall, a very decent brew. like I said, I wish I had know a-fore-hand . . . . I would have saved it a tad loner to go with my Temptation 2009 vs Temptation 2013 vs Petrus vs some Bruery tart competition.... but oh well... I just wasn't expecting a sour this evening.... can definitely taste the hops, too! light and fluffy; I very much like this. not a fan of mikkeller, maybe I need to learn more about the concept. but I like this."
"O: It's not terrible, which is a pleasant surprise. I usually hate anything by Mikkeller. This is quite drinkable, albeit not terrific. That said, it's no Saint-Gilloise, which is the premier dry-hopped lambic."

"O - It was a slightly above-average geuze. I cannot say that I would go out and seek it again, but it is definitely worth a try if you happen to see a bottle or on tap somewhere. I dont know if there is betel nut/leaf in it as the name suggests, but it has been over 10 years since I tried betel, so I forgot how it tastes (it was the first/last time). Perhaps the bitterness was not from citrus peel, but rather from the betel nut???"

"Pours a light, yellow-orange gold color with a small to medium off-white head, kinda fizzy. The beer is somewhat cloudy, though I did have the bottle on its side until about half hour before opening it. I can't say that I really care about clarity in beer, though. No lacing, no bubbles at all after a couple minutes. It's a sour; what do you want. The aroma is quite interesting. Big sour apples, oak and lemons shot through with tropical fruit, peaches, grapes, tangerines and some floral hoppiness. It's not an aroma that I'd immediately peg as hoppy, but it makes sense, upon reflection. It smells like the sweet, aromatic side of the hops with very little of the danker, resinous notes. Solid mix of sweet and sour, and definitely not something that I've smelled before. The taste is more sour forward. There's some light peach/grape/pineapple/tangerine action in the finish, but it's mostly a very nice, lambic-ish sour on the tongue. Good pucker. Tastes like a version of Spontannoble without the magical Sauternes barrel's depth and complexity. Still, this is better than lots of highly touted sours. The 5.5% abv lets the bright, complex sourness shine. There's some wonderful musty funk in the mix. The sourness is lambic-ish in its complexity; this is no one-note, lactic or acetic bomb. Very dry. As the beer warms, more of the hop flavor comes out in the taste. It adds a very pleasant element to the beer. Floral peaches and tropical tangerines meet those baby gueuze flavors. The mouthfeel is light. Medium to medium-strong pucker. This isn't quite as good as Spotannoble, but it reminds me of that beer considerably. More breweries need to brew lambic-style sours under 6% abv, though I imagine it requires a rather sure hand."

"A solid gueuze, but the absurd list of hops/dry-hopping really don't do anything here, lacks some character. Lets see what some agin' does."
"This is a great sour, but I've had better gueuzes. I always want more sweaty, funky flavors and aromas out of a gueuze. The hops only come through in aroma and flavor, not much bitterness, which is an awesome way to do it considering the style. I love that I dont get any clove or banana. This is a totally different Belgian in that sense. Its a great sour with many nuances. I'd get it in a bottle if it was priced well."

"Overall, pleasant, complex, and kind of weird. Worth a try."
