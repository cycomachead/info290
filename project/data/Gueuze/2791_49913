4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"My overall impression of this beer is that it leans towards the tart and acidic end of the scale and downplays the funky character found in several other Gueuzes.  Thus it would make an excellent counter point to others as part of a tasting session involving gueuze from several breweries.  Alternatively, it seems a fine beer for having with a meal or for sharing with others rather than being something to be consumed solo in one sitting.","drtth","Dec 07, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big sour apple, lemon zest, pear, grape, apricot, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, white wine, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of wild yeast ester and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour apple, lemon zest, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, leather, white wine, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy tartness/sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, hay, straw, grass, pepper, clove, oak, vinegar, leather, funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of wild yeast and oak barrel flavors; with a great crisp malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and moderately prickly/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Gueuze style! All around great complexity and balance of wild yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Body/carbonation are perfect, especially for style. Finish is like flavor, good burps, tang lasts forever, slightest alcohol warmth. Can't say it's very drinkable, more sippable.

This pours a slightly light yellow straw color with a massive off white head which quickly dissipates and leaves nothing. The smells are of funk, vinegar, ripe cherries, malt. The feel is medium with high carbonination. The taste is good, very vinegar like sour, some funk, maybe a little brett, very acidic, my girlfriend thought it reminder her of bile, I find it quite good though. .","DavidST","Dec 13, 2012"

The flavor was nice, hint of brett, mildly sour, touch of lemon, very much a gueuze but also struck me as being similar to Jolly Pumpkin Bam Biere. Weird.
