There's also not much in the aftertaste. Good alternative for a regular pilsner, but nothing more.","Wanne","Nov 14, 2014"

Overall one of the least enjoyable examples of the style -not to say it is not enjoyable I had a hard time with the review since it is not what I consider a gueuze since it lacks a sourness I expect but it is not bad if you prefer more malt","Slatetank","Apr 26, 2013"

3.67,16.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into a cantillon glass. Smells a bit basic, with some low profile Brett and mustiness. The taste is obviously sweetened, which means this is probably pasteurized. Of the dumbed down gueuze I have tried, this isn't the worst by a long shot, however it is a far cry from the real stuff. I can appreciate what this is though, and if I think of it as a new style as opposed to the real thing it is is actually pretty good, and very drinkable. Interestingly, my wife loves it, and she doesn't like much else in the beer world. Very cheap in Belgium, and worth a try. At least it isn't trying to look traditional wi th a cork and all that.","allforbetterbeer","Dec 29, 2011"

Decent appearance, with slightly thicker head than it's brethren. Smells of citrus as expected, with a slight paper mill scent thing going on I'm not sure if I quite dig. The flavor was slightly better than I expected, with slight sweetness and citrus, but a bit too much thickness and rotten fruit. The drink was quick and for a second I thought of ordering another just because it went down so good. Overall a decent gueuze, but not a competitor for my wallet in Belgium with so many other finer examples. Restaurant beer.","Wegomlegging","Feb 12, 2011"
2.61,-17.1,4,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Bottle from the supermarket. The beer has a nice pour, an amber body, with a tall head. The aroma is bittersweet, some lemon/grapefruit smells along with a light, juicy fruitiness. No sourness at all. Taste: citric components, a sharp, sweet malt some very hidden sourness, light fruits, and a bit of sugary sweetness. The finish is lightly sweet with some citric bitterness added. This beer made guezes popular among the mass consuming beer drinkers, but I will never have it again. Junk beer","fewa","Feb 04, 2011"
2.97,-5.7,2.5,3,2.5,2,4.5,"Acidity in the nose but not transcendent because there also collects cardboard odors. The taste is slightly sweet, which is a good point in relation to commercial gueuzes often sickening glucose. However, it lacks relief, tannins and acidity are nonexistent unfortunately unconvincing. Only the finish is slightly tart but far from it to crown a great lambic.","ThaCreep","Jan 25, 2011"
3.55,12.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"drinkability is okay. this one is just too sweet for me, and feels muddy overall. seems like it needs something - more bitterness, or funk, or acidity - to balance out the sweetness.","grub","Nov 04, 2010"

3.13,-0.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Had a bottle at my hotel in Ghent. i found this to be a little similar to Lindeman's Faro in how sweet it was.

2.55,-19,3.5,3.5,2,3,2,"Into a stange it goes, and the beer has a foggy brownish-orange color, topped off by a white, compact head. The smell is fruity and sour, with just a little skunkw escaping. But what does it taste like? Calm down there. Damn, that's pretty sour and acidic. I can't find any fruit in the flavor, is that a bad thing? Ok, there is, but it's weak and watery. Tastes more like vegetables were used in this one, I don't know why. Why can't it taste like the smell? The sourness is starting to gain my acceptance, but it's too late. There's little else that makes me want to try this again.","DoubleJ","Aug 31, 2007"

Being impartial, I say it would serve very well to those being introduced to the style. If you can manage to acknowledge it for what it is (a macro attempt at a truly craft orientated style) than I'd think you shouldn't have too much trouble enjoying it - I did.","biegaman","Feb 16, 2007"
3.18,1,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"37,5 cl. bottle. Poured in a Belle Vue flute glass, deep golden orange colour, correct head that fades but leaving always a thin cloak on the surface. Aroma of acid apples, oranges, some barnyard, not as sour as usual. Taste is of acid apples, wood, apricots, some sourness but not as much as other gueuzes. Probably good for lambics beginners, but not the best example.","janubio","Jan 14, 2007"
3.46,9.8,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The Belle Vue Gueze pours into my champagne flute with a golden amber body adorned with a white frothy head that holds a nice film lacing down the glass. The beer has an aroma that is slightly skunked, from the green bottle with that familiar sweet Lambic smell and just notes of the normal sourness. The beer tastes very sweet up front followed by a mellow sourness from the spontaneous fermentation. The beer leaves a sticky residue upon the palate with a bit of dryness. The medium body is complemented by a lively effervescent carbonation. Overall, its a drinkable Gueze as its not too sour to overwhelm a newcomer to the style but not very complex and doesn't keep your taste buds guessing. Not a bad to try out the style, but seasoned veterans will get bored after a few sips.","MSchae1017","Sep 19, 2006"
3.32,5.4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Opinion: This was an OK beer, but it was really mild for the style. I didn't know what to expect since it was so old, but it follow just about every other Belle Vue beer I have tried...it is mild and very drinkable which would appeal to more masses. I would stick to the Girardin, or Cantillon, or even Lindemans Cuvee Renee before I would pick this one up.","SkeeterHawk","Mar 19, 2006"

3.77,19.7,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours brownish-orange, with raisin and brown sugar on the nose along with some sourness. The palate shows gentle fruit, malt, and semi-spicy flavors. It's good, but there's just not too much going on here. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light, and for that matter so is the drinkability. It's suspiciously easy-- maybe even not challenging enough for a Gueuze. Now isn't that a masochistic thing to say?","VoodooBrew","Jan 31, 2005"

3.38,7.3,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Pours a crystal clear reddish brown color, with almost no head besides a collar of white bubbles. Smells tart and fruity, slightly earhty, slightly of raisins. Since this is my first gueuze, i really don't have a frame of reference for the style. Taste is sweet and tart, lots of honey and fruit flavors, with a smooth woody flavor that seems to finish out this beer's flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty much flat, but interesting. An ethereal smoothness pervades this beer, making it stand apart, not saying better or worse, but different from every style and beer that I have sampled.","TastyTaste","Sep 17, 2004"
2.7,-14.3,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Dark gold body with a fluffy white head. The head did give way to islands of foam in the beer. Aroma was souring musty and damp but a hint of something sweet was mixed in also cork was present. Taste was a brief second of sweetness and then a tart sour flavor came in. The flavor is different yet interesting in its own sort-of-way. Smooth and bitter in the mouth, but hard to drink. This is an interesting style of beer. Overall I couldnt handle too many of this style of beer. Maybe it was this bottle or style but one or the other is not for me.","Stubbie1","Beers"
2.96,-6,4.5,3.5,2,2.5,4,"Pale golden honey color witha huge white rocky head. tart vinious aroma has a acidic fruitness to it, citric acid? thicker mouthfeel than I was expecting almost sweet. deinetly not as sour tasting as the aroma leeds you to believe. almost no aftertaste at all. drinkable yes but i think this is a far cry from a tradtional gueuze. maybe a good introduction for people not familiar with belgian lamics.","shippos","0"
2.43,-22.9,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours with little or no head and minimal lacing. The sour taste for which this style is noted was weak. Stronger malt and fruit in the nose and a clean if somewhat vinous finish. I will try another lambic from a different brewer and decide whether this is a style I will stick with.","Citadel82","Jul 09, 2004"

3.57,13.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Despite my initial caution, I like Belle Vue Gueuze. It isn't a world-beater and won't cause me to shout the praises of gueuze from the rooftops, but it is light, fruity and satifying. Should be great to sip on a hot summer day when you don't feel like doing much of anything at all. Thanks gueuzegeek.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 28, 2003"
2.54,-19.4,2.5,3.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,"Poured perfectly clear caramel colour. Initially supported a thick head of foam, comprised of large bubbles, which disappeared too quickly. Once in the glass it gave off aromas of wet cork, ripe apples and pears, nutmeg, and... believe it or not, cigar tobacco. Some complexity but very low intensity. First sip revealed thin mouthfeel and softness of orchard fruits followed by hints of oak and mild grapefruit peel bitterness which disappeared almost as rapidly as the head. Being a fan of all things gueuze I was happy to taste it but I don't consider this to be a serious contender to dethrone Cantillon, Boon or Lindemans as the classic gueuze.","Beersignal","Nov 02, 2003"
3.35,6.3,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall this beer is a very soft, but ultimately approachable "soft" example of the gueze style and would probably make a good follow up to a kriek or framboise in introducing someone to lambics.","drewbage","Oct 08, 2003"
3.12,-1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"The color a dark yellow or amber with a modest and semi-creamy head, the color off white with a filmy sheet of lace to seal off the glass. The aroma of ripe fruit like pears and apples with a citrus like semi-sweetness makes up the nose, start has a mild semi-tartness leading to a light to medium top. The finish is austere in its acidity with a pleasantly dry and spicy aftertaste, a decent Lambic, but there are many better.","Gusler","Aug 20, 2003"
4.02,27.6,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Its almost an antithesis to the Cuvee Rene 94 I tasted at the same sitting.. The color is darker than the Cuvee Rene 94; head is not as frothy; wonderful but less flowery nose than the Cuvee Rene 94.","gueuzeonhigh","Apr 08, 2003"
3.2,1.6,3,3,3,3,4,"I have no idea how old the bottles I have might be. I purchased them from a beer distributor in Philadelphia, and they appeared to be sitting around for a while. I have had about 10 of them already, and they were not entirely consistant. Overall, there is little to no head to be seen. Based on last night's tasting: The color is rather dark amber and it is cloudy, as it should be. The yeast smell is present, but not nearly to the degree of a beer like a Cantillon gueuze. There is almost a sweet-tart quality to it. I feel like it is a bit thin. The sweetness almost makes me think there are cherries in it. To explain why I still rated it as a 4 for drinkability is because it really is an easy drinking beer, which, if you forget about the fact that it is a gueuze and let it stand on its own for just taste, it can be rather nice. I found it to be refreshing, especially in the summer.","gueuzegeek","Nov 17, 2002"
3.5,11.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not the prettiest beer to look at. Hazy golden color with little to no head. What little head there was dissipated very quickly.
