"Eric"
"Pour is slightly hazed golden yellow with a tight white head.  Nose has a light saltiness, moderate mineral presence, faint lime juice and lemon.  Flavor is very minerally up front bordering on sulfur, juicy lemon and citric acid, fairly acidic finish.  Moderate to soft carb, light delicate body."
""
""
"Overall I've enjoyed this geuze and will be happy to have it again sometime.  While it is a touch milder/sweeter than some of the others I've had that also has a nice balancing effect on the tart sourness and the funk.  So this would be a good one to share with those new to the style.  That said, I think it might have scored a bit higher were it not for the fact that my expectations have been shaped by having had several other Gueuze's before this one (e.g., the Tilquin, Cantillon, Hanssens, DeCam, etc.)"
""
""
"This beer is very enjoyable, as it is outstanding well balanced. It opens up a different angle on Gueuzes, as being gentle on the palate, without the usual aggressive tartness, still it contains an enjoyable complexity."

"Overall: Interesting beer and glad I had a chance to try it."

"2010 vintage. All the right aromas and flavors but very underwhelming- should be about thee times more intense."
"Overall:  This gueuze has alot of the traditional flavors and smell going on, but it is too sweet for my tastes per this beer style of gueuze.  It is interesting how the bready sweet malts make that lemon lime flavor add a slight orange flavor to the beer.  I want more sourness and funk with less sweetness from my gueuze. It was a good beer to try once and it makes you appreciate how well that Drie Fontienen, Cantillion, and Brouwerij Girardin brew and/or blend thier respective gueuze."

"Very good Geuze, it has a nice balance between sweet and sour and great complexity. Quite pleasant to drink. Should please a wide range of beer drinkers."
""
""
""
"This is an oude Geuze that will appeal to a lot of drinkers. It has everything of a oude Geuze from the Senne valley but it is also quite mild and not too sour. I liked it very much."
""
""
""
"Overall, an enjoyable and refreshing geuze. Lacking some depth but certainly a step above a Cuvee Renee. It's surprisingly funky. I think this would benefit from a little more time in the bottle. Would certainly tick again."

"Food match: Gueuzes are palate quenching kings, so they will really work with anything, but sharp cheese platters are par excellence cuisine pour cela."

"I'm glad I found this at Best Damn Beer Store in San Diego. The history of the brewery is an interesting read as well. From the 750 ml Belgian bottle, and for once I am glad to see a traditional cork-- though it was rather explosive on applying the pliers. Cost was $16."

"O:  This is a really good gueuze.  it has a really nice pucker, good complexity and great flavors."

"hazy, cloudy golden color with white fluffy head dissipating to a ring.  Aroma of lemon zest and funk.  Highly effervescent carb, lightly drying, and a mildly bitter finish.  Really nice for its price if you like high carbonation on a gueuze."
""
"Overall: A solid affordable gueuze but not one I would routinely go to to get a fix.  The mid body turn of the oak is really a disappointment.  Overall though worth a shot."
""
"Overall: This is my Introduction to the Geuze style. I am Surprised, this was one funky brew. Pretty complex, yet this is my first step to the style. This brew is worthy."

"It's a good beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I think this hangs with many of the marquee beers out. 4.12"

"O/D - A nice Gueuze to sip. Lacks the epic complexity and touch of sweetness of others, but it was still a good one. Definitely not as tart as other examples."
"Final Thoughts: First experience with the style but a good one. Memorable for the dry tart flavor. Would I drink it again? Sure."
"Only my second ever gueuze style one but it was quite a nice beer, definitely one that started to grow on me as I worked my way down the glass. Perhaps too sour for my tastes initially but from the half way point on wards it started to go down very easily."
""

"O: Excellent. Bought in Birmingham, AL, drank Aug 3rd in Hopkinsville, KY."

"Overall: A great interpretation of an authentic geuze. Lots of weird funky and sour flavors that set it apart from the American sour ales. Recommended and easy to find."

"Hazy golden blonde colour, ring of white head, some lace as well. Smell is funky, a bit lactic, fruity with notes of green apple, acidic notes similar to fresh lemon juice, a bit of barnyard, smells like it is going to be quite sour. Taste is a mix of funky and fruity, musty basement, lemony citric acid flavours, tart towards the finish, mildly sour in comparison to what the nose sugested, dry throughout and into the finish. Medium dry carbonation, medium bodied. Probably one of the easier drinking geuze I have had perhaps owing largely to the freshness of the bottle, I'm sure with time this will become funkier but it is quite nice so young already."
""

"a tasty gueuze here, not super common in the states, at least in my experience, so thanks to claystation for getting it here live. a hazy blonde beer that has some very evident acidity. a short white head but some pretty good lace one it, and a lot of fizz here. a whiff of green bottle staleness to this, but it seems somehow pleasant with light lemony and lactic acidity. tons of oak to the taste, lighter body than other gueuze, and a very light lemon character that makes this distinct to me. acidity is less than it smells like it might be, but right about medium in comparison to the field. wheat malt base has a soft texture, and the big bubbles make it feel great on the palate, refreshing and clean. this tastes authentic to me, it reeks of open fermentation in oak vessels, and while it lacks the true layered beauty of say a cantillon, it seems to me to be done in a very traditional way and with great success. others have liked this less, but i find it one of the more drinkable examples of the style. id like to see it more available."

"Bottle 2007 vintage (7 years old). Pours a clear gold with thick white foam. Aroma is intensely cheesy with some barnyard and wood. Taste has a nice sourness, it is also quite sweet and the wheat is very present. This one is miles ahead from the unrefined fresh version. The nose is stellar but the taste could be more refined although this lambic drinks easily. Close to the best examples of this style. 3.8"

"O- a nice drinkable gueuze, not on the extreme end like some of the higher rated of the style, but a good intro into the style before trying some of the more flavorful examples"

"92/100"
""
"Overall- Nice shelf geueze at $10 for a 750 off the shelf. It's worth it, and if it was a saison, it would be rated better than it is on here."
""
""
""
"While this isn't the most complex gueuze the flavors work very well together. There's a bright acidity, mellow oak tannins, and an all around nice funk. I'll pick these up again in the future, no doubt."
""
""
"Overall: Perhaps a little tamer than other geuzes, with a nice underlying sweetness that I found quite enjoyable"
""
"Clear copper. Light head. Smell is brilliant! Sweet. Fruity. Hint of balsamic. Ag√®d and nuanced. Taste is equally compelling. Light. Funky. Vaguely sweet. Very clean finish. Funky enough to be interesting. Very nice. Recommended. Will have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
"Cheesy and musty funk with a light sourness. Very mellow. Wheat and barley malts seem nectary and smooth. Lemon and tart apricot and wet hay. Subtle gueuze flavors without much acidic distraction. Heavier feel for a gueuze with extremely low carbonation and a medium-full body almost absent of stick. The finish is long and tempered. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I found this to be a good Geuze through and through. The interpretations of this style that I enjoy most are those that have that big kick of dryness or that mouth puckering tartness or strange funkiness you can't put your finger on, or all of the above. In comparison to what I really like, I found this to be tamed and clean. There's nothing wrong with that, it just depends what you're looking for."
""
""
""
"O-Not something I would drink regularly, but it certainly has its time and place. When paired with some grey/snowy weather and a Tim Hecker album, you can't go wrong."
"Overall, a good beer, but not one of the stronger gueuzes."

"O: A very nice geuze. The nose is intense and pleasant, which the taste can't quite match, though."
""
"O: An very good tart beer with a funk derived fruitiness. The sour character is the most prominent flavor but it is does overpower the rest of the beer. A great beer to pair with meals just avoid sweet sauces unless you enjoy that toothpaste, orange thing in the morning."
""
""

""

"Poured a cloudy yellow with a three finger white head that stuck around for a bit. Quite nice to look at. Scent is sour, with heavy lemon juice and barnyard funk with a very slight bit of bubblegum. Good, what a geuze usually has, but with a slight hint of some saison traits. Taste follows, sour, lactic and lemon mostly with some slight grassy flavors and some sour green apple in the background. Good and sour, like a geuze should be. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Overall this is the best of the three geuzes I've tried. It's more sour and dryer than Lindeman's Cuvee Rene and it has more character than St. Louis' Geuze Fond Tradition."
""
"D) I can't say I'm impressed with this one. Too much carbonation. Too little aroma and flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O ‚Äì Enjoyable from start to finish. This was my favorite of the three."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This is a good gueuze, but there several better, similarly (or cheaper) priced, and just as available options out there. Worth a try, but not a repeat purchase."

"Overall an enjoyable geuze but not as complex as some others. Not overly impressive but definitely true to style and refreshing to drink. Its lacking some flavors that other geuzes ive tried have had which hurts drinkability. I'd have another but won't be buying it again on my own. There are better options"
""
"Amazing flavors of sour malt and slight...ever so slight hop. Nicely sour fruitiness mixes with the corny malt. Sours are so hard to rate..but this is amazing...."

"Due to its unique qualities, pair this food with BBQ pork with a tri-tip salad; buttery rolls and collard greens are a must on the side"

"375 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/13/2032. Pours moderately cloudy golden straw color with a 2-3 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big sour apple, pear, lemon, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, grass, leather, funk, white vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of estery/funky yeast notes with barrel character. Taste of tart apple, lemon, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, grass, leather, light vinegar, and earthy yeast spiciness. Moderate fruity/spicy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, clove, pepper, hay, oak, grass, leather, light vinegar, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity/funky ester flavors with moderate barrel character; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. High carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very crisp, dry, moderately prickly, and slightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Gueuze. All around nice complexity and balance of flavors; and very smooth to sip on even with high carbonation. A very enjoyable offering."

"overall- i might be a little biased as a lover of the style, but this was one great beer that i would enjoy as often as a could afford"
"Glad I finally got to try this, and good to know I don't have to break my back to find an excellent example of this style in the area without having to pay tons of money as well. This is definitely NOT a gueuze for beginners for all of the musty, dried fruity textures going on, but it's relatively well-grounded in terms of seeking complexity and balance. Never a chore to drink, and I could have this all night. Fantastic stuff!"
""
"No, this one did¬¥t age as well as the other lambics I have had. It is not very complex, and the aftertaste is too short."
"Overall a great introduction to the style. I can't believe I've never tried a gueuze before. Looking forward to the other ones in the cellar."
"Overall, a really nice, tasty gueuze. Definitely some nice complexity from the yeast. Not as bright and sour as other examples of the style I have had but it is surprising complex. Definitely worth the purchase."
""
""
""
"There is good reasons for not making beer this way anymore..."
""
""
""
"From first trip to Belgium in 2010 found tasting notes on this beer, which was our virgin voyage with these crazy gueuze brews. This one in particular did not stand out in our glass. Golden yellow with a taste that was most remniscent of dry tart fruity white wine. The endnote of this brew wasn't particularly liked as it was watery and flat. Otherwise the funkiness and sourness was on point."
""
"This is a delightful oude geuze that would be great for casual sipping on a warm day or with food."
""
"Overall- For the price I payed for this bottle, it was good, but I'd rather buy the kriek again."
""
""
"Bottle purchased from Colonial Wine with best served by date of june 2032, poured on 3/20/13. Poured into a tulip glass. It pours the color of pale canteloupe flesh with a shade of soil to it. It lets very little light pass through at all and has a very uniform haze. There's a good amount of fizzy head that leaves no lacing on the glass. The smell is good. It has that expected farmland funk to it, but no so overbearing as to destroy all the other scents. There's definite sour cherry and some champagne flavor on the nose. The taste is pretty sour which is very good, even to a hop head like me. It's tasty and puckering and very active on the tongue. Very fizzy. The taste is sweet too, like a fresh peach with a sour cherry pucker to it too. Very good beer overall."

"Drinks easy, a decent Gueze, there are better"

"Overall - A light, refreshing and overall delightful farmhouse ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice geueze that is easy to find while in Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not as insanely in your face as Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze but it still has that strange astringency I don't like. Maybe geuzes just aren't my thing."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This one was tollerable, but a little too barnyard foward for my tastes. Though I prefer more sourness and acidity, this is still a decent gueuze that I could imagine sharing with friends. A full bottle would be too much for me. Finished at the lower end of the spectrum in this lineup."
"A solid gueuze on all fronts. A good balance of funk and tartness. Refreshing and delicious."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice complex lambic with good sourness and tartness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a light but very flavorful beer. Really drinkable, has a fruitiness but a freshness too."
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding beer...a bit pricy, but I would have it again."
"Been doing a few from this style lately. This is easier drinking than other brewers of this style. A touch softer -- the sour isn't such a kick in the face as others. Nice bitter-sour balance. Liked this quite a bit."
""
""
"The lack of monstrous tart love actually makes this more drinkable than your typical gueuze... it actually drinks sort of like a Berliner."
"Best by 28-10-2031"
""
"D - Definite must try for sour beer lovers; I think this would also make a good ""gateway"" beer for those wanting to give the whole sour beer thing a try; nice tart front and smooth oak flavor at the end; good balance and nice complexity"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is definitely more bretty than sour. A decent gueuze, but there are plenty of other ones out there I prefer."
"Not to start a tirade, but I think this beer was a victim of sitting on a shelf in its green bottle. I don't see the point of using green bottles for beer, even ones with low hop content. I think I'd have been disappointed if I had cellared this for years myself only to find it had been skunked from the day I bought it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just what the doctor ordered! Although the look and smell aren't a show stopper the tart and funky but superior balancing act between smells and tastes that would otherwise be off putting, clean the palate and warm the belly"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I paired this with a ribeye and it was very nice. The meat really cut through and the Gueuze brought out the spice rub fantastically."
"375ml ‚Äì caged, corked, punted, and ‚Äúbest‚Äù for the next 19 years."
"Overall very nice, maybe just a step down from drie fonteinen."
"Overall, wonderful. I will try to buy this again. If it was easily available and reasonably priced I would probably make it a summer staple."
"O: Very easy to drink, very refreshing, and very enjoyable. This is definitely one to get again. It is not overly sour or funky so would likely appeal to people just starting out in this style."
"Pours perfectly transparent and bright gold. Big puffy white head that sticks around for quite awhile. Oak, big sweet and sour lemons, light grain, a mineral note, white wine vinegar and a difficult to place earthiness make up the aroma. It's difficult to describe. There's lots of complexity and sour depth. It's a very nice gueuze aroma on the lower end of the funk spectrum, not that there's anything wrong with funk. Taste is a bit less complex but still quite good. It's dry and sour with a tannin finish. Oak and mild funk throughout. Mouthfeel is softly effervescent and mildly bracing from the tannin and sour. Great beer. Oud Beersel makes excellent lambics. This gueuze is easy to like and fun to drink."
""
"Overall. A very nice gueuze with some great fruity, funky smells going on. Would like to try one aged another 5 or 10 years."
""
""
""
"Taste is rounded and has lactic acid in it. There is a distinct lemon taste, more zesty than of the lemon flesh. The acidity is not aggresive or tangy, it is pleasant. The mouthfeel is thin, but certainly for the style spot on. Usually I am not a huge fan of sours, but this beer is so balanced and pleasantly sour, an absolute winner."
"Pours light golden ale with a solid quilt of light white foam. Nose comes out with plenty of funk, hay, manure, horse hair, lemons, carbon dioxide (more a sensation than flavor), hints of pepper and lactic acid. Nice and tart with a degree of brett that is a little over powering for me with a chalky and bicarbonate addition. There is a bit of hay and soil with a lemon zest and acetic and lactic acids. I'm surprised how subdued the sour is in this one. Thin bodied with hi carb and dry finish - standard. This is not a great gueuze for me. Not tart enough and a little too much brett. I will likely buy a few more bottles at some point for aging, but only to see where it goes, I don't get the feeling this beer is going to be more sour."
""

""

""
"Drink and overall: Yeah it's good. It's not GREAT, but man, it really hit the spot, and gave me what I was looking for. I think it's an above average Gueuze."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-light in body, with a fairly high level of carbonation, causing this to foam up (perhaps a bit too much) on the palate. Resultant mouthfeel is more bubbly and creamy than smooth, but still quite palatable, with no wateriness around the edges. Closes out crisp and dry, with slight stickiness around the lips."
""
"Overall: a well-crafted if straightforward gueuze, I just happen to really enjoy this beer."
"375 ml bottle. Pours a hazy yellowish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is hay, light lemon, and a light earthiness. The initial taste has decent sweetness with hay, moderate tartness, and spritzy lemon, sort of lemonade-like. The finish has a bit of earthiness and a decent tartness, leaving some lingering lemon and hay. Light body. Medium-high carbonation. Not bad, but not terribly complex and a little bit more sweetness than I like in a gueuze."
"D - Very easy to drink!"
""
"originally reviewed: 10-25-2010"
"O: Very nice brew I received as an extra on a recent trade."
"Best before 10-19-2029. Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‚Äò3 Fountain‚Äô gueuze glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger white head that surged out of the top of the glass and eventually subsided to two finger VERY slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, lemon zest, lemon rine, sour, and tart. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, tart, fruit, lemon rine, earth, and sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I bought this one on simple fact that it was one of the top rated of the style on BA. I figured if I want to call myself a true fan of the style, I need to try as many of these as I can to be able to gauge my review. This one definitely did not disappoint. All of the right flavors and aromas were there with a nice touch of different lemon components to add another layer of complexity to an already solid style. Really well done and I would highly recommend it to anyone who calls themselves a fan of Gueuzes/Geuzes."
""
"O: It's a good beer. But is it a good lambic? As far as true lambics go, I'd say it's pretty mediocre. It did not fare well with a few of us who did a blind tasting of gueuze last year. In fact, we all agreed that the considerably-cheaper (and often not-as-well regarded) Cuvee Renee was better. And we're not exactly inexperienced lambic drinkers... We all correctly recognized each of the 5 or so gueuzes at the blind tasting by the smell. Anyway, it's also a big step down in complexity and general enjoyability from Cantillon, 3F, or Tilquin. So, if you have a choice, those three are definitely worth the extra cash."
"O: A nice gateway gueuze if ever one existed, one that would go well with dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer was very complex and enjoyable, but the metallic finish was too strong and unpleasant. I do look forward to trying this again to see if there was something with the bottle or just something that I ate that messed up this tasting. Anyways, Pick up a bottle and give it a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The orange-tinged dark yellow beer poured with a pop and a fizz, but the head quickly receded. The aroma burst out with cork as well, but it quickly faded into a yeast and musty affair laced with pear and classic funk. Sour and tart on the palate but not to the extent of some of the more complex gueuzes. There is a bit of apple seed bitterness that lingers on the palate."
"Bottle to red wine glass. Looks good; light orange and pretty transparent with lacing around the edges. Smells great; tart and fruity. Tastes good, but not as great as it smells. A little too subtle for the price. Mouthfeel is good; feels like a good geuze. Overall, a tasty brew that I wish was a little livelier."
"Lively carbonation contributes to a crisp, clean, quenching mouthfeel. Finishes dry. Pairs beautifully with food, cutting nicely through fatty cheeses and heavily sauced pastas."
""
"Refreshing and clean, this gueuze is best with spicy pasta. The acidity makes it difficult to consume more than one glass at a time."
""
"I couldn't ask for a better looking geuze. The color is a slightly pale golden straw with an absolutely perfect head. It wisps around the snifter with each sip. Not much visible carbonation, but the head indicates that it's doing just fine. Smells like a barnyard. Some cherry and apple notes pop out, but definitely getting a horse blanket vibe here. Taste is about as sour as I anticipated and balanced by a dry finish. The best part about this beer is its drinkability. The carbonation plays very well with the funky nature of this beer. I have had this one before and will have it again. Better than I remember it being. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is very lively on the palate. This is a very drinkable geuze. Nice flavor and refreshing the sourness doesn't kill your palate."
"O: Kind of unfair considering Cantillon is my benchmark, but this is still a good gueuze."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love sour beers (so I am bias). This beer is very wine like because of the zingy sour fruit. It does have a lot of earth and mineral as well (somewhat dusty). It is an experience to drink and enjoy."
""
"O: The aroma was quite nice but the flavor lacked depth. Not bad, but I'm not particularly impressed."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am very impressed. What a complex beer! There is so much going on here and it is nothing like I have ever had before. I would like to try some different beers in this style."
"This is one heck of a brew. I'm glad I sought it out.."
"O: lovely, decent one."
""
"Pours a murky honey color with a 1 inch fizzy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap. Random streaks of foam line the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and funky with some slight fruit and earthy and woody aromas. Taste is pretty much the same but not all that sour or funky flavor wise. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a super crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good gueuze but it's definitely not as sour and funky as I like them to be. With the best before date being 18 years in the future it would be interesting to lay one of these down to see if these flavors evolve."
"Golden orange hue. Small white head. Good lactic sour nose. Wet barrel wood and modest mold funk. The flavors are lemony with a solid amount of wet basement and dusty attic. Not as complex as some but still a good amount of typical gueuze flavors. Light body. A decent gueuze if you can't find any of the big boys in your area."
"D - Very good. Could use a little more punch as it seems to loose complexity and sourness as you get half way through the bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark gold with a thin white head that dissipates quickly leaving just a couple of spots of haze. Aromas of green apple, cheese, grape skins, lemon juice, and some funk. Taste is very ""apple-y", lots of Granny Smith, lemon juice, and earthy cheese with a bitter, tart finish. Not bad, but tastes young. Mouthfeel is light and spritzy, with a medium body and good carbonation. Dry, puckering finish. Overall a decent Gueuze, would like to see it with some age on it."
"The aroma was a bit lighter then I was expecting, but still tremendously good. Rich nose of tart apple vinegar, sour grapes and a touch of wet hay. Enormously complex, as it warms it comes across with a light wheat or herbal like quality and just the tiniest amount of spice prickling the nose. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes of sour and biting vinegar flavor coming across on it right away. A little bit one sided, and not as huge as I would have wanted given the stature to which this one is held to, but still extremely solid and worth it. Light grapes and even a touch of wheat coming through mid palate, especially as it starts to warm. Mellow grassy flavors are mingling very well within the flavor now. Smooth, easy transgression with the carbonation being nearly perfect here, and a light feel that was just spot on"
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer, but thought it was a bit young to be enjoying at the moment. Will sit on my other bottle for quite some time (at least 4-5 years) before enjoying that one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first real venture in guezes and spontaneous fermentation. I was blown away."
"O - Complex, too complex to fully describe for me, lots of funk and good clean acidic character, some fruity esters, dry, and good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Tasty, but not complex and certainly not very delicious in the finish. Still enjoyable and flavorful."
"4.5 D: Great beer. Easily one of my new favorites of the style. Tons of complexity without needing to relay on acid overload to be interesting."
"Flavor follows with light tartness and a bit of lemon funk. Touch of perceived hop character on the nose with some agitation. Bit funky/earthy though rather thin in body and with a short finish for the style. Decent but unexciting."
"Aftertaste feels like a very dry white whine, with some funk mixed in. Sour, yet somehow isnt too much. Very solid gueuze. Going to get another to age, as should you."
"375 ml bottle. Pours hazy golden with a huge, white, foamy head. Rustic, sour aroma of spoiled fruit hits nose. Body is full and crisp. Taste is very sour of spoiled fruit, funky barnyard, yeast and some bready malt. Long, sour finish is very dry. It is my first geuze, therefore it is ‚Äúhas to be acquired taste‚Äù brew."
"This is a real good geuze. Brings everything that you want from a geuze. The aromas make the beer and has a lot of complexity+depth"
"O - Pretty good but I have had much better. I would have preferred a bit more balance, in this case more tartness and a little less funk, but it was still pretty enjoyable."
"Probably one of my least favorite gueuze of the line-up, but all in all its not a terrible one."
"Overall a decent gueuze but seems a bit tame and subtle."
"O: Clean flavors but not very funky or sour. I‚Äôm not sure how old this bottle is but I bet a couple years in the cellar would do this wonders."
"Ov- Wonderful balance. A truly elegant gueuze that has aged gracefully."
"O: Was a bit surprised by this beer, i kind of had a little bit more expectation for it. I guess I did drink it a little young. But glad I did not spend the extra to get the 750ml. However I would buy the 750ml, but to age for a while."
"The Oude Geueze Vieille is an incredible example of the style. Very lively flavors, done in accordance to tradition, since 1882. A fine, sophisticated sipper, I would recommend this beer to anyone with an open mind and a half hour to spare."
"O: Awesome representation of the classic Belgian Gueze style. Nice blend of lambiks. Awesome tartness and oh so refreshing in these summer months. Very well done. 4"
"Tannic nose, fairly dry with a fruity grapefruit style but still very quiet. The palate follows from this perspective tannic acid, which gives the smell with vinegar and the smell of gastric juices. Which offers a range of tastes quite nice. The bitterness is unfortunately not marked but it offers an after-taste of cork. The body is more fruity than the others with a small palace gueuzes fishing rough and sweet. The finish is persistent and spreading in all the flavors of beer. Good gueuze in the traditional style."
"decent, nothing i'll stock up on but i plan on buying a few more for down the road."
"Overall, a good gueuze. Great aromatics of lemon and hay, with subtle granny smith apples and dank cellar qualities. The flavor could use a little more complexity and punch but I am not going to hold it against the beer. Pretty good for the availability of this gueuze."
"This beer pours a very clear straw gold in color, very effervescent, with a one finger beady, quickly dissipating head. It smells of sour peachy apricots yet isn't as fruity as the Hanssens gueuze. There's a lot of funk. The flavor is again very tannic and features a lot of dehydrated fruits. The funk is nice and I swear the brett is powerful in this. It's overly carbonated so drinks light and fizzy. You would have thought that this wine glass is laser etched. The flavor is a little short lived. It's sour but it doesn't resonate and is somewhat quick to fade. The beer is pretty light and drinks quickly. Overall it's a solid gueuze but not exceptional by any means."
"Overall: Good tasting beer with a good flavor profile. I will buy this one again."
"Overall: This is a good representation of the style."
"Overall I'm not sure how much I like or hate it but I can appreciate the style yet As a chef, balance is very important to me and the biggest problem I have with sours and geuzes are the lack of balance."
"O- A delicious, very drinkable gueuze, represents the style very well. Definitely worth a try."
"Smelled funk as soon as I opened this bottle and the cork came out supper easy. I smell a bit of lemony sourness, funk and green grapes. The appearance was nice pale golden color with lots of bubbly head. Lots of carbonation in this one. Taste was OK but some flavors came through I was not excited about. I loved the beginning sour fruitiness that led to an odd bitterness and finally to a sort of metallic taste (didn't stay long though). Overall I thought this was OK and worth a try but liked others in this style much more."
"A nice Gueuze, certainly something I'd like to put some age and see how it changes. Was hoping for a bit more sourness, but otherwise no real complaints."
"5.9/10"
"Overall drops a half point as well."
"375 ml caged and corked bottle, label says best before 08-11-2030. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there isn't much lacing left on the glass. Aroma is tart apples, funk, lemon peel, pears, and some apricots. The taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like tart apple, white grapes, lemon peel, and some funk and wood. It's not as tart/sour as I was expecting it to be, but it's still a good tasting brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's somewhat slick and has moderate carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I enjoyed it."
"This is my kind of Gueuze. One of the classics, up there with Girardin and Hanssens."
"O - Huge disappointment. This is the oldest lambic I have tried by about two years, but it seems to be over the hill. I'm a big fan of the funk, but this is just difficult to drink. 2.5/5"
"Wow, first gueze and it is great. Now I know what everyone is talking about... the funk. The barnyardy undertones bring out the citrus lemon flavors. The crisp mouthfeel and taste immediately remind me of really good champagne. Expensive, yes, but this is something that I plan on buying again for special occasions. Good stuff, very light/crisp and good for summer."
"Expiration Date: 2029. I need to get more of these."
"Bottle poured into a snifter. This is a light golden peach color, extremely fizzy and champagne-like. Smell is mostly sour and acidic with some lemon. Taste is mostly sour lemon, but not quite as intense and pungent as some of the other gueuzes I've tried. This is very smooth and easy to drink, just not very in-your-face sour."
"Overall, this is a solid gueuze. Everything is well thought out from the aroma to the flavor. Maybe not the best I've had, but still a great gueuze for a hot day. Worth picking up a bottle."
"Overall a very strong gueuze offering."
"O - I'm conflicted over the mounting similarities between this and a cider. Not necessarily a bad thing but the overall apple cider sensation is just confusing the issue. The aromas point to something akin to Orval but the taste is much more Strongbow. And to be fair is a considerably more complicated than that.."
"A bottle shared by Brickstoredave at the Brick Store Pub. Thanks Dave! Poured a slightly hazy golden with an absolutely huge white head. Smells sharp, and somewhat acetic with notes of pear, aged cheese, sour apples, and a bit of barnyard funk. The taste also starts with a bit of funkiness underscored by a sharp and slightly acetic taste that mellows through the finish. Tart in the mouth, and although it mellows through the finish it never becomes soft. On the other hand, it's not piercingly sour like some either. I suppose it depends what you're looking for. While I found this good, it seems to be lacking something to elevate it beyond merely a decent geueze."
"The beer is good‚Ä¶ but not one that I think I could learn to love. It‚Äôs refreshing, but there is way too much tart for a beer with such a low ABV. Coming in at only 6% I expect a much more memorable flavor. But you remember that citrus that I smelled at the very beginning? Well it‚Äôs still here. That citrus flavor doesn‚Äôt go away. Drink this one slow, and enjoy it. You won‚Äôt want to rush this bottle."
"It does have an almost humorous expiration date of 2026."
"O - This is a very good Gueuze; not quite world-class in any specific quality, but overall it is high-quality across the board."
"This one sat in my fridge for months before I sampled it, and I wish I hadn't waited so long. This is an extremely funky beer that is definitely worth at least one try."
"O: not my favorite gueze, but decent nonetheless."
"Lighter than some, but still a gorgeous example of the style. This one accentuates the delicate smoothness that can be developed in a gueuze. Light and fragrant, and very easy to drink‚Äîits a well crafted example."
"Terrific beer to enjoy with just about any fish or chicken meal - especially anything incorporating lemons & capers. Plenty of flavor, without taking over."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Overall it's a very nice beer of the style. It had some very nice tart, fruity and funky flavors and it managed to not be overly acidic and harsh. Very enjoyable overall."
"you will proceed to suck down all of your Geuze friends. and like it."
"This beer pours out as a bright golden yellow with a fizzy white head on it. With te aroma of this beer being as strong as it was I was impressed to smell some fruits way in the back end of this brew. The taste is very much like many Gueze Lambics it's tart and sour with a bacterial bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is carbonated and yet smooth. The beer is drinkable which was a good thing for me. I'm still trying to get into these types of beers."
"It is overall a very refreshing beer, that seems like a little bit of white wine, cider and beer."
"It poured a golden honey color with a huge, bright white head. After the initial pour this was a slow pourer because the head was so large. Had a great sparkling character to it, just looked super refreshing before the first drink. Reminded me of a ginger ale with a fluffy head. The smell was strong of zesty lemon, grass, and tart. The taste has most of the same characteristics as the smell. Pretty sour upfront, lemony, small hints of orange peel, with a strong tart finish. This beer had great carbonation and was very refreshing. This was the first gueuze I had ever tried and I'm now a fan. I really enjoyed how easy this went down and how refreshing it was with all of the tart character."
"A interesting beer if you can take the funky. Its extreme!"
"Overall, this one smells, tastes and feels quite different than the geuze I drink more often (Drie Fonteinen, Cantillon and other lambic producers). On one hand, I applaud them for making a unique product, but this could be confused for sour saison as well, so it's not exactly what I was hoping for or expecting. Nevertheless, I certainly enjoyed drinking it."
"O: This is very saison-like, only a little more sour. I wish I could drink this everyday."
"My wife claims that the best thing about this beer is that is gets less vile with each sip."
"(D)- A decent Gueuze. Smelled and looked great, but some off-flavors keep this from being great. Still enjoyable though."
"D- This is a great beer overall. A nice soft, classy, gueze. Great example of the style that is not overly sour or in your face."
"Recommended."
"O: (my FIRST time typing 'O' rather than 'D') A very likable drinker... if you're into 'sours' that is. As natural and unadulterated as I've found in a g(u)euze, skunky and brash yet altogether delicious. I don't know what possessed me to pick this up months ago; very good, borderline 'great'."
"D- Very drinkable. Nice subtlety of flavor that works well with the dryness."
"It is different for a Gueuze, a good one too."
"D- Enjoyable, but sadly the flavor is a bit too delicate, I think. Hardly sour or tart even though the brett is there in the nose and beginning of the taste. The fact that it is very dry and crisp means it goes down easy, but the flavors don't stick around long enough to make an impression. Reminds me a bit of champagne in the mouthfeel."
"D: Drinkable if you can get past the pungent, sharp flavor on the front of every sip."
"This beer smelled like a white wine. It had hints of grapes and possible sour grapes. This beer was quite tasty. Sour and dry, but still had a malty taste. It was like drinking a malty dry white wine. The carbonation was good and provided a nice mouthfeel. The lacing was quite nice and gave an appearance of fangs around the rim of the glass"
"D: If I was doing a smell taste, I'd swear this was one of the best geuzes in the world... alas, this is beer and we drink beer... which makes it just slightly above average. Worth checking out and a solid beer overall, but don't get your hopes up too high."
"Overall a great Geuze. Gunna probably buy a couple more to age super long."
"D - This is a really tasty beer. Sour but not over-the-top sour."
"Overall a very enjoyable gueze."
"Drinkability: A light, crisp, refreshing, and tasty beer. The flavors meld well together and aren't overpowering to the point of limiting this brew to a one-and-done. Definitely recommend."
"D: So refreshing and and pleasure to drink. The tartness is not overpowering as to make this beer one dimensional, the flavors combine and work together well, creating an easy-drinking beverage."
"O- Outstanding drink, blew me way. I could ride these all day and night. Great to sip on and admire."
"D: This is more of a preference thing...if you enjoy this style of beer you could drink it all day. It is a bit stronger than other lambic style beers I've had, including those with fruit. For that reason I would say it's a little strong, and I couldn't drink more than a bottle at a time."
"D: dry, and seems to be well-drinkable in a summer weather."
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this beer. It is my first experience with the style and I was expecting something a little more funky. However, I enjoyed it and hope to drink more of this style in the future."
"D: A very drinkable beer."
"D-I've always been a big fan of this beer, and this bottle does not disappoint. One of the best gueuzes at this price."
"Overall this beer is mildly tasty, but is a very average iteration of the style."
"This was largely an exercise in impatience -- I've been sitting on too many beers for too long to hold them for my tasting group -- and one of curiosity: will this one screw up my digestive system as some lambics do? (Answer: no.)"
"Light bodied beer with good amount of carbonation to keep the palate clean and dry. Fairly drinkable beer, but it was challenging for the person I was chatting with to drink so it may be a developed taste. Overall enjoyable beer."
"The aroma is very tart with lots of lemon up front and some vinegary, musty, yeasty notes. The flavor predominantly very tart, almost cloyingly so. Lots of lemon, with faint grapefruit and kiwi, overlayed with a faint funky mustiness. Very light-bodied and dry, inviting one to take sip after sip, especially after one's palate grows accustomed to the tartness."
"Overall drinkability is very good. This is a great thirst-quencher for a hot summer day, not so much when it's 9 degrees outside in the winter. Oh well."
"37.5 cc bottle poured into a large snifter with a gigantic head. Smells very promising with that sour funk to it you would expect from a gueuze but lacks the traditional sourness I am used to. Nonetheless it is still incredibly drinkable. This is my go to if I can't get any cantillon but not that special."
"Taste is excellent, fruity, yeasty, funky and rustic, lemony a bit citric, slightly tart, hint of spiciness and yeasty dough, plus more that is hard to pin down. The character is very complex and well-balanced and integrated. Full of flavour, it is nevertheless exceedingly drinkable. Fell is lively and the whole thing is very engaging."
"D: Smooth and easy drinker, but the flavor and appearance were off for me."
"Medium/thin bodied with a prickly mouthfeel. Drinkability is average."
"Beer is thin and falls flat on the flavors at first. As it warms more of the funk comes through but I just don't really like this gueuze as much as others. Carbonation on the palate is surprisingly weak and finishes brightly and a little dry. Its a good beer, just not my favorite. I'd have it again."
"This gueuze appears a very hazy yellow. The head is an inch thick and generates some nice lacing. The aroma is fantastic and detectable from several feet away. Easily identifiable as an authentic Belgian gueuze, this beer smells wonderfully funky and sour. The taste follows suit, with a nice puckering sour finish. This is a great gueuze. I definitely recommend this beer."
"Hazy, apricot with blonde highlights and a big fluffy head of fine eggshell colored bubbles. Sour lemon and white grape with subtle oaky notes in the aroma. Tart and lactic with an almost vinuous quality. White fleshed fruit and oak with toasted oak and a puckery tartness. Bigger and more complex flavors of vanilla oak and lactic sourness take over as the beer nears room temp. Lush and smooth bodied with huge carbonation. I am surprised this Gueuze isn't more well known and hyped up, it's as good as many of the hard to find ""whales"" out there."
"light-bodied mouthfeel with a ton of carbonation. not hugely drinkable, IMO, as the tartness wears on you after a while."
"Funny at 11.99 a 750ml it's cheaper than Russian River sour beers brewed around the way. It's a pretty good beer, but I think I have to try it in Beersel."
"Pours a hazy straw color with billowing dense white head, fades slowly leaving a quarter inch sticking around, neverending stream of bubbles. Smell: big whiff of skunk when the cork popped, but either vanished or overcome by the sour and funk. Hay, barnyard funk, champagne, sour lemon. Taste: like shoving a big wedge of lemon in your mouth, a tad vinegary, vinous, musty and slightly spicy. A little more than light bodied, aggressive carbonation. So far for me the best balance of funky and sour, nice gueuze. Also, best by March 2030!"
"Pours champagne-like in color and carbonation. Huge meringue-y head that is quite persistent and leaves godlike lacing. Jam-packed (literally) aromas of marmalade, funky-funk, and perhaps even a spicy soapiness. Very pungent. Flavors are huge - lots of funk, lots of sourness, like unripe cherries, and some more astringent qualities like the spicy soapiness in the finish. If not for these latter notes, this would be world class and elite. As it is it's a great geuze and wonderful in its sourness. At $7.99/12.7oz. bottle it's waaay pricey, so try it if you see it, but the price brings down the drinkability for me. Excellent."
"Drinkability -- Very nice. Tart and drying, but with a surprising amount of fruity sweetness that somehow makes me nostalgic for elementary school lunches. Quite good, but doesn't quite have the exceptional depth of flavor that I look for in an exceptional gueuze. Beyond that, it was a pleasure to drink."
"Overall, this gueuze isn't very sour. It has more brett notes than mouthpuckering sour notes. It is decent, but I would choose others over this one. Fairly drinkable."
"Highly recommended."
"D: honestly it wasn't as sour as I thought it would be but drank very well and was extra dry on the finsh. Definitely not one of my favorite geuzes."
"Very nice! Pleasant and pairs well with French goat cheese by providing a nice acidity to balance the creaminess of the cheese. This beer goes well with food because it has a subtle and dry taste."
"Not what I prefer in a gueuze exactly (more often I'll go for the funky complexity of a Cantillon or the bracing sour of a Hanssens) but this is solid and enjoyable in it's own right. Potentially a good intro to the style or a crossover option for wine drinkers."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: The beer is rather easy to drink for a gueuze because the flavor isn't too funky."
"Sort of like a Belgian Pale Ale meets a champagne. Alright, but not sure if this style is my thing."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, this one is dry and tart with a heavy musky back. This is great example of a wonderful style and is a fairly good introduction to the style without overdoing it."
"D - A top shelf Geuze that is very impressive. In a blind Geuze tasting this would stand up well."
"Awesome with a burger from Five Guys."
"If you want something bright and bubbly"
"D: A little too much wang to drink a whole beer for me."
"I realize that there are few hard and fast rules with this style, but I found the body to be a bit too thin. Drinkability will depend on your appreciation for funk and sour. One at a sitting was enough for me."
"D: All and all a solid gueuze. Classic flavours, traditional, I liked this quite a bit. I'd love to taste it in 2029, that'd be a riot."
"D: Very solid, will benefit from some aging. When fresh not as refined as a fresh cantillon classic gueuze, but certainly worthy."
"2009 bottling with a best by date of 4/8/2029. The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is tart with a lot of lemons. Not much funk. The flavor is tart lemons with some wheat. There is not much funk in the flavor either. The tartness is not near as intense as in other gueuzes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This beer was probably drank a little too soon. I think some more age would have definitely helped it develop a little further. That being said, it was still an enjoyable beer."
"D: very nice crisp gueuze, served chilled just below cellar temp, refreshing with great aged qualities, the vinegar quality is welcomingly (did I just make this word up?) potent"
"D- Really easy to drink and super refreshing, from the smell I thought this was going to be really sour and tart but luckily it wasn't, just loads of funk, lemongrass, and earthy/wood. Enjoyed."
"Sparkling and hazy gold brew has a foamy, white head and a lightly sour aroma, mixed with fruity esters. A lot more fruitiness and lemon in the taste than some other gueuzes I have had. This offsets the sour notes a lot better and makes this a very palatable brew. Finishes like champagne and is very dry. This turns out to be one of the more balanced gueuzes that I have had."
"Overall, interesting in that is is not as strong and sour as most lambics I've had. It is on the opposite side of the spectrum to say a Cantillon. However, it does remind me of a Pitcher of Lambic Doux I had years ago at a cafe in Brussels."
"D: Very complex and tasty although slightly lacking in the sour department. Best by date of 2029, which was amusing to see."
"A savoring gueuze. Yeah, well what gueuze isn't worth savoring? I do wonder what how this beer would develop by the ""best before"" date of October 19, 2029."
"This a an excellent gueze, and far superior to the ""lambics"" making their way into some of our grocery stores."
"A little acidic for having more than one, but overall a pretty easy sipper for the style. Not as challenging and exciting as some others, but a fine bottle nonethless."
"	This beer is very light in body with a refreshing and pleasantly tart taste. It has great drinkability, the sour flavors are not overwhelming so this would be a great beer to have without wearing out your palate."
"Medium body with a lot of carbonation. An easy drinking gueuze to be sure, nothing overdone, just nice and refreshing all the way."
"Going to get a few bigger bottles of this and cellar for a decade or three..."
"D: Refreshing and not so tart as to be difficult to drink, but with enough going on to remain interesting."
"For me very good geuze, rather mild and inviting."
"D: I find it hard to dislike a good gueuze and this continues that trend. A tasty beer and I wouldn't mind having this one again."
"12.7 ounce bottle poured into a Duvel Green tulip. Clear golden tangerine color with a huge white head that at first seems fizzy and unsustainable but manages to stick around at about a finger's height for the duration. Aroma is mainly lemony acidic sourness with a faint smattering of tropical fruit and a clear oak presence. Brett is subtle but comes through as a slightly chlorinic note. Flavor really isn't that sour for a geuze but there's a solid unripe citrus character that finishes rather watery. Dry and woody towards the back of the palate. A little thin in body; carbonation is just about right after the semi-aggressive pour. Drinkable but not a top-flight lambic."
"Overall, a pretty decent geuze, not awesome."
"Pours a pretty golden amber with a nice head. Surprisingly, quite clear to the point that I thought it was filtered until I pulled some yeast from the bottom of the bottle. The nose is quite nicely oriented toward lambic fruitiness with both citrus and cherry/cranberry notes, as opposed to the funkier orientation of other gueuzes. Flavor is less tart than typical lambics, thinly bodied, with a dryness that accentuates a comparatively bitter finish that evokes grapefruit and citrus zest. Either fresher hops or a lot of barrel time is at work here. As with any lambic, I find it nice to start it cool and let it warm as it's consumed to experience the full range of flavors."
"D- High. I will be buying more of this, a very very tasty beer. I am surprised at the drinkability, I could drink this all night long. Highly recommended."
"D- I wish I had a bigger bottle, this was simple and to the point, no glitz, no glamor, authentic Belgium Gueuze that's ready to attack my insides. Great stuff and recommended."
"O: less sour than other geuzes, more fruity and floral"
"D - A supremely easy drinking beer, refreshing with mild twang- a great gueuze w/ mild sourness and smooth flavor til the end"
"A pretty good gueuze, in my limited experience, but lacking on the whole. The highlight of my night drinking this was when my 3-year-old daughter, after taking a sip and asking what it was, said, ""Daddy, I like gueuze. Gueuze is my favorite."""
"Finely hazed ginger-orange with a soft and snowy white head. Tart, funky nose of cold cellar walls, glue, lemon juice, unripe bananas and barnyard. Nicely balanced and dry on the palate, full of lemon and grapefruit pith, sour and juicy in the center and bitter in the periphery, not unlike the sensation of eating an actual citrus fruit. Very delicate and somewhat champagne-like, a very drinkable sour beer and an excellent aperitif."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable moderately sour gueuze. I like the taste but due to the bite, two seems like my max per session. The lemon taste is dominate and I think this makes a nice intro for the style."
"I just didn't love the aftertaste, so drinkability suffered. I'll take a Lou Pepe over this any day, but glad to have tried!"
"Ranks up there with the like of Cantillon as far as I am concerned. This is a great Gueuze, and something I would highly recommend."
"very nice. Expiration date of 8.4.2029, so maybe it needs a few years, but what I'm finding here is pretty proper. Nice, slightly burnt gold, with a white head that holds and leaves a little lace. Nose and taste are sour lemon up front followed by tart barnyardy funkiness, a touch of toasty, buttery bread, green apple, white pepper and earth. Great acidity and white pepper in the finish. definitely a treat. I need to put one of these away and try it in 2029."
"D: Great start, but finished a bit flat for me. From the loud pop and strong sour quality on the nose, to less that thrilling flavors and lacking body. Just not my favorite, but still worth the try."
" D- This beer has a smooth and soft wild notes with a nice subtle complexity that grows as the beer warms."
"Mouthfeel was mild, but the effervescence increased as it was held in the mouth. Light to medium body."
"As this is my first gueze I was expecting more that what I got. The beer poured a dark straw color and smelled like dirt and fruit(in a good way). The taste was very underwhelming and I was honestly hoping for something a bit more. The sourness was not very prominent and I kept get a more metallic taste towards the end which was a little off putting. All in all I'm not sure I would try this one again very soon and will seek to find other in the same style."
"I first had this beer in Brussels, it isn't the best geuze I have had, but very good."
"Admittedly a nice Geuze right from the start. This one is good and funky, but less sour than Cantillon Classic Geuze for instance. Very musty, with hints of vinegar and white wine. A pleasant tartness, with a lasting yeast impression. I would get this again."
"Medium-high level of acidity, not as much as Cantillon or 3 Fontienen. One bottle is enough in one sitting. 2008 edit: After trying this after some Cantillon 1900, this seems a little dumbed down. Not enough sour or funk, it seems slightly sweet by comparison. It has a generic corked Belgian funk. Probably won't revisit this one...2009 edit: Guess I changed my mind! ;)"
"Overall a very solid beer for the style. I'm still fairly new to Guezes, but this one displayed all of the characteristics I'm looking for in this style. It has a pretty mild sourness, but a great funky, almost cheesy taste. All in all a solid beer, but nothing amazing"
"Finish of lemon, grapefruit skin and sour green pears, all with the consistent underlying tone of a bit of sweet. Pleasant drink."
"375ml bottle. Pours cloudy, light-yellow orange with a small white head. Dies quickly. Light Brett notes in the smell, with a bit of mustiness. Some faint acidic notes. Surprisingly weak aroma, overall. Lactic notes in the taste, with some oakiness. Light citrus. Muted flavor as well. Light body. Not something I'm tempted to drink much of; it's missing that bold, unforgiving acidity that is expected from an ""oude"" gueuze. Pretty underwhelming, over all."
"A real geuze - an acquired taste perhaps, can take getting used to, but once you're there, this is one to try for sure."
"Overall, the acidity and tartness were pretty well balanced and made for an enjoyable beer. Would love to have this paired with some cheese or dinner."
"I'm glad to have finally tried this, definitely a new experience for me. I think this might have opened my eyes to the Belgian unflavored Lambic/sour world."
"A very solid Guezue. This one will probably benefit even more with some age on it. Probably pick up another to stash in the cellar for down the road."
"Great gueze. Try it with some stinky cheese, you will thank me later. It smells like stinky cheese, moldy grapes, and that lovely sour belgian yeast. This beer, and the style, is so unique and refreshing. The perfect start to a night of good beers. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and very crisp. Really, superior drinkability...seriously."
"alfrantzell shared this one, I believe. Thanks Arne. Pours with a hazy blond body and a small white head that retains nicely for the style. Sweaty gym sock aroma, husky grain, rye bread, rotting wood and fresh lemons. Very funky. On the palate it opens with a light graininess, but this is soon overwhelmed by intense lemon flavors, both bitter rind and sour juice. Very tannic with a light body and moderate carbonation. Tannic, dry, tart finish. A very balanced gueuze, not overwhelmingly sour but pleasantly complex and interesting. Easy to drink and very enjoyable, though it lacks the structure and body of gueuze from Cantillon or 3 Fonteinen."
"Finishes dry with a unique touch of sweetnes and leaves a funk sweet flavor film on tounge on finish. Not a whole lot of flavor up front."
"D: I don't know if I've had an authentic gueuze that I didn't want more of. The more I drink, the more I think that this style needs more love."
"The taste is about the same. More tart than funky though, not as complex as i would have liked Howevery its still very goodand highly refreshing."
"This is drinkable. The 6% is hardly noticeable. If you like beers that lack noticeable sweetness and are sans hops, if you are thirsty or being forced to eat from a relish tray during a football game, then give a couple of these a chance."
"D - bottle is plenty for me, wish they would change the green bottles, but do not think I had any ill effects of light"
"Low off white head that stays strong, duvel laser etching holds a spot in the head. Hazy golden straw color. Decent lacing. Skunky funk nose, gueze in the back. Smooth body, dirty, earthy, oxidized a little. Smooth, sucks the moisture from your mouth. Dry and earthy finish."
"D - I could live off this, but I'm biased by my complete adoration for this style. Regardless, this is a brilliantly complex, easy-drinking brew that I could revisit any day of the week... but it's extra special when I have it as an occasional treat. I'm thinking some kind of shellfish - perhaps mussels with leeks, a touch of curry, ginger and white pepper. Or maybe a dessert of some sort - lemon poundcake with an apricot marmalade? Damn, I'm hungry now too!"
"D: Well, it's no doubt a great Gueuze - and you should absolutely try Gueuze once. This one is a bit sweeter than the Cantillon I tried earlier tonight - but I put my money on the Cantillon Gueuze."
"375 ml corked and caged bottle purchased from Hi-Times in Costa Mesa a few years back, has been in my cellar ever since, currently drinking out of my Belle-Vue flute glass, color is a golden yellow with some orange tint, one inch bubbly white head, this one gushed a bit, not much retention, weak lacing, aroma consists of lemon juice, horse hay, funk, wild yeast, oranges, oak, and white grapes, starts off with sourness followed immediately by lemon, pretty watery in the middle and actually washes things out a bit, finish is fairly dry but there needs to be more acidity to make this more true to style, slightly dry, citrusy, and funky mouthfeel, thin to medium bodied, way too carbonated, taste lingers a little, easy to drink but too light for a gueuze, too plain overall, no alcohol in the flavor and crisp though, not a bad gueuze overall, probably could use some more age actually, would drink again, worth trying"
"A cider-colored dirty blonde that you can see through with great carbonation and two-finger head. Bitter sour fruit smell like pear along with citric notes and some woodiness; has a juice-like smell with a hint of sweet malt. Bitter and sour, a little too much for my liking, with a leafy-like dryness that slightly overpowers some sweet and sour fruit tastes. Medium-bodied yet crisp and sharp, beer cuts through as it passes the tongue and finishes dry and musky. A good beer but not one that I would want to session."
"Oud Beersel Gueze looks like a nice honey with a one finger head on top. It smells sour , funky, certainly more complex of a smell than the Budweiser that I drank at lunch earlier today. The taste is more of that sourness, crisp and refreshing though. Mouthfeel is bubbly, similar to sparkling wine. The drinkability is good, a nice gueze that did not set me back as much for its price compared to some others of this style that I have bought previously. Very much a beer worth your time and investment."
"Beautiful clear golden pour with a creamy head easily coaxed back up with a gentle swirl. lacing does not cling. Odor is harsh as can be. I was expecting tart, but the funk, the wood, the barnyard is simpley explosive. Soured milk and veiny blue cheese come to mind. Taste is more on the sour side with lemon rind coming to the front. Very high on the tongue, very dry, almost spritzy, but never quite reaching that level of carbonation. The combination of scent and mouthfeel make this a sipper of the highest order. It was a bit of an enduance test, in fact. Still, not an unpleasant experience, and one I am sure to revisit. A very nice lambic."
"It's very good when you're thirsty for sure."
"I was expecting, and hoping for this to be much more sour. All in all, though, this one very enjoyable"
"Highly drinkable, especially for a gueuze."
"crisp, tasty, good gueuze"
"this brew pours up a clear golden color with a thin off white head. the nose is wood, tart citric acids, subtle honey notes, light fruits. I taste sour candied fruits, subtle oak, cork, not overly sour. medium bodied, low carbo, very clean finish. Chicks like this! In a good way!"
"apple juice quite murky. quite sweet nose. let it breath for about five minutes. sour apple as expected. but gentle... taste is sweeter than usual. quite pollen like. honey... bee's wax... lillys and pollen sweet... a musty candy finish... some vanilla. definitely the mellows of its nature. the most forward in the flowery sense too. almost a honey like quality. wonderful. simple palate for a very delicate style. at cellar temperature a nice rose water bread finish... like a triple almost... but one can dream."
"D: A fantastic brew. Drinks like a fine wine. But perhaps it is a little to restrained considering the style. I would have liked a little more character and depth."
"Ive been severely craving for artisinal Belgians this week i find myself succumbed to the hands of a year + old gueuze tonight. The small corked bottle pours a warm amber orange color with incredible clarity and a small tightly knit white head. Funky, wonderful nose despite my belief that the bouquet is still tight. Peaches, dried apricot, nuts, hay, leather and earth all with a dry looming sourness about it. Acidic to the tongue and definitely coating on the back of the throat, full bodied and packed with layers of complex flavors. This one will just keep getting better."
"Conclusion: Either this was a bad bottle, not my style or it just is one funky beer - nonetheless, I couldnt drink it. I've had several other spontaneously fermented beers before, but not one like this one. I'm NEVER gonna buy it again. The bottle looked fancy though"
"This is a beer with a beautiful burnt gold color with a tremendously solid white head. The aroma is great, sour-smelling and funky with a nice mix of fruit, wood, grain, distant pale malts, and barnyard. Yeast and a tart fruitiness are the predominant notes in the taste, which is a little spicy and not overly sour. Nice balance, with a great interplay between the tart and sweet sensations. The beer is light-to-medium in body, with a spritzy carbonation. Nice, and incredibly easy drinking!"
"3.5 M&4 D: the mouthfeel at first is quite intrusive, but softens bit by bit, turning to an ideal texture once the beer breathes a little while. Can't have the best of both worlds, alas, as the aroma at the same time turns duller without the clear and pleasant structure when fresh. Maybe this bottle is still young? But all in all this old geuze is truly impressive, one of the best I've tried, with good potentials to age."
"D - This beer met my expectations and was very good for style."
"Picked up a corked 375ml single from Abe's Cold Beer. Compared to an unblended lambic I had earlier this week (Cantillon Iris) this beer is a little smother and more drinkable (and a little less complex), but still a pleasure to drink. It's heavy on lemon and lime juice with a with a fun tangy tartness and mild musty farmhouse notes. I'd call this a very nice beer and excellent starter gueze."
"D: Not the best gueze I have had by a long shot. I might have gotten a bad bottle but this just was not enough. Not nearly as acidic or tart as I would want."
"I had to use pliers to pull the cork out."
"D - Quite drinkable for a gueuze, the sourness is not as assertive as some others, and the funk is mild as well. Still, there is enough going on here to satisfy and it went well with the shrimp bisque that I had it with."
"this beer pours hazy orangy yellow with a big, frothy white head that has pretty good retention and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Smell is of tart green apples and champagne-esque yeast. Taste is very much like champagne with lots of vinous, green fruit and a tart, cheek pursing flavour throughout. Very crisp and quite clean on the palate with a dry, bubbly finish. This is my first gueuze and I must say that I quite enjoy this style. This is a nice beer that I would buy again."
"Pours a cloudy golden-yellow color with a thin, foamy white head that settles into a thin lace. Aroma is citrusy and funky with a lot of sour fruit notes as well as some champagne yeast. Puckering but not too sour with a sweet citrus/ light fruit earthy flavor. Very vinous with a dry finish."
"D - I'm still trying to get my head around this style but this is quite an enjoyable beer. Not something for everyone but I'd drink this again and recommend to people looking to expand their beer drinking options."
"Excellent."
"Damn...another fine Gueuze on our shores. Many thanks to those bringing them in and stocking them. Try this if your a fan of the style."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a great head that raises too quickly. The aroma is by far the bed aspect of this gueze. It is super funky. It has lots of barnyard, outdoors, hay, and leather characteristics. It also has sour odors and is kind of lemony. The taste isn't as sour as the smell made me thought it would be. It is funky and somewhat zesty. Pretty awesome. I'm becoming addicted to these beers."
"This is a very good sour beer. Would like to have this on draught somewhere."
"Mouthfeel is acidic, stringent, drying and dominating. As sour and puckering as this beer is, one bottle is more than enough for me. Definitely an interesting journey into the ""wild"" side of beer fermentation, but I think perhaps a lambic is more my style."
"D, notes: Pretty good. My first gueuze so I have nothing really to compare it to. I found it well balanced despite the pronounced sourness. I don't find Belgian sour ales particularly sessionable."
"Man, I forgot how much I like real Gueuze with all the funky notes and oh so good sourness. This is a slightly orange tinted brown colour with little head. The nose is classic Brett with other earthy notes in the mix. Very well put together with just the right amount of sourness. I need to buy more of these."
"decent, but just a bit one-dimensionally sour, at least when compared to the other gueuzes i've been trying lately."
"Pours the color of fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with a light filmy head. Smell is funky barnyard sourness. Taste is mild, bland, faintly sweet and a hint of funky sourness. Pretty mild overall with a light lingering funky flavor."
"Gently hazed goldenrod color with a cidery green apple aroma. Dry, and tart but not challenging, the Vielle has very low carbonation and a dry apple cider flavor that, at peak moments, hints at chardonnay. Timid but intact. A good drinker though not my favorite gueuze."
"Overall - An excellent gueuze and one that isn't mouth puckeringly sharp.... one of my favourites. Very refreshing and definitely worth a try if you can get it..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild carbonation level. The dinkability good, in spite of the sharp vinegar in the finish."
"Clear golden color and a frothy light tan head. Lots of tart citrus and some earthy funk. Sour fruits and mildly sweet malts. Definately brings down the funk. A creamy body with lots of carbonation. This is an outstanding example of the style. I wish my palate was better adapted to describe this delicious elixir."
"Overall, Geuze is a style that I enjoyed. Not among my favorites but something I will come back to on occasion and experiment around with. Would be interesting to follow this up with something ultra-sweet"
"d: This was my second time dipping my toes into the gueuze pool. The Hanssen's Oude Gueuze I tried was a lot more confrontational. I prefered that one, but this was more approachable."
"D: An excellent way to break someone into sour beers. Not too terribly funky-but with just enough skankiness to intrugue and not intimidate a newcomer to Geuze/Lambic."
"Poured from 375ml (best by 20-04-2026) bottle into a cantillon gueuze glass. Poured a clear golden yellow color with champagne like carbonation. The cork popped of with great pressure and the head foamed up then dissapated a minute later. The smell is musty earth tones not what I would call barnyard and some lemon scents. The taste is very light on the sourness compared to most others gueuzes with more lemon zest and slight acidic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light body with a perfect carbonation level. This is a very drinkable gueuze and would be a great beginner gueuze to introduce someone without giving them the overpowering funk that might turn off a first time taster. But for me that barnyard funk, that bile is what I yearn for in a gueuze."
"Fine grippy texture, quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Note: If you pour to the bottom, big chunks of sediment will fall into the drink. Not a terrible thing, and doesn't alter the taste. Just clouds up the appearance a little."
"It sure looks nice in the glass, more to the ""gold"" end of the color spectrum but the head (poured into a tulip) kind of deflated after coming up to about two fingers and there is no lacing at all. It was pretty clear at first, but when I poured the rest, some sediment got in there and it clouded up a bit, as expected."
"D: very nice drinkability, enjoyable"
"The taste is nice and sour. Similar flavors in the mouth with a slight bit of proseco. Easy drinking and delicious."
"This beer is a murky orange color with flakes of sediment in the bottle and glass. Thin white head that diminishes slowly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Tart fruity aroma with some dusty and earthy malt. Medium-bodied with a tart apple character and light coriander and yeast flavors. The finish is dry with green apple and oak flavors and it leaves behind a lingering citrus and spice aftertaste. Overall this beer is pretty enjoyable."
"Has a bunch of coagulated yeast all over including one at the top of the bottle. The yeast on the bottom is very chunky. Pours a great light brown/gold color with little of the white head and no lacing. Smell is a corky sourness, light and slightly tartness. Taste is very light with little sourness left. Flavors are very mellowed out. Very drinkable in the fact that you don't have to wait very long to take the next drink. Mouthfeel is a little acidic but not bad, pretty smooth for a gueuze. Overall it's very drinkable, but I prefer the more tart, fresh lambic/gueuzes, but this is nice too."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, citrusy, acidic, and dry."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the Belgian traditional style Gueuze."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable and low in abv makes this beer quite quaffable. Lots of complextiy makes this a staple among gueuze beer. I would buy it continually."
"A super tart and sweet sensation with hints of a granny smith apple. The finish is complex with a lemon and vinegar bite that almost makes the mouth pucker. Classic Gueuze appeal with a distinctive yeast quality. Each sip is interesting with different flavors to showcase. A style that I truly enjoy and this is a beauty."
"Taste is of very firm, tart green grapes, which have not ripened. Very tart and crisp throughout with many of the same flavor profiles as a high quality champagne. Earthiness and a distinct image of french farmland comes to mind when drinking this."
"Poured from a 375ML bootle, caged and corked, into a wide mouth white wine glass. Presents itself as a medium golden honey color with a slightly rocky, cream-colored head that is not very deep. Retains well, however, and leaves rings of lace in the inner rim of the vessel. The nose is all gueuze - wet hay, grass, musk, and a subtle fruitiness intermingled with earthy spice notes. Quite pungeant, especially when given a swirl in the glass. You really need to stick your nose in this one. The palate follows suit, offering a very sweet/tart beginning, with the taste rounding out to accentuate notes of white grape, candy sugar, honey, and balsamic vinegar to name justa few. This beer turns very dry, very fast. Incredibly complex, as a gueuze should be. Mouthfeel is medium, with terrific carbonation levels and good control of acidity. Lingering tartness finishes this beer exceedingly dry, like a good dry white wine. A fine example of the style, and one I'll return to again. If you're expecting a sweetened, mass-marketed lambic-style beere here, you're in for a mouth puckering shock."
"D - Those with a taste for the sour and dry could knock back a few of these. The only limiting factor would be the price. Other than the price tag, very solid and enjoyable."
"D - Despite my recent fondness for extremely sour geuzes, I havent found them to be extremely drinkable. I really enojyed this one, but it is about as drinkable as some of my favorites."
"D- ¬ìWTF¬î was my first impression, being that this is the first gueuze I¬íve ever had. Looking at the description of the style, I¬íd have to say this is pretty right-on. And I¬ím assuming this is one of the better ones out there given the glowing reviews it has received. I guess this style is just not for me, though I liked the twangy mouthfeel."
"This was a tasty bottle of tart funk. Nothing overdone, the flavors had a nice balance and the mouthfeel held up well. Recommended. Thanks to ClockworkOrange for the bottle..."
"Very nice geuze, a style that I'm starting to explore more."
"On the tart end of the spectrum of true lambics, this is refreshing and tasty."
"Cheers!"
"This is a delicous, dried, massively complex delight of an ale. Lemon rind and an overall much more refined lemon flavor than in the nose. Hints of lime, and some of the sharp, pungent berry flavor as in the nose. Nice carbonation with a excellent backbone of zingy fresh acidity. Overall a great easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability- Very good flavor. Solid for the style. Would really like to taste a fresh bottle."
"Mouthfeel- The palate is very acidic, but it doesn't burn. I sometimes wondered while drinking this beer how so many American beer drinkers love this style of beer. It's unique, just nothing that I would buy regularly. Or scream its praises from the rooftops."
"drinkablilty: Typical for a top Gueuze. Small assaulting to the senses sips, always looking forward to the next."
"Drinkability: Good. Sour and funky with a nice balance. Has all of the lambic characters, but isn't extreme."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy dirty beige color gueuze with a big foamy white head with great retention. Aroma consists of light horse blanket, funky yeast and some light green apple. Taste is sour with a nice funky touch and with a low acidity level, which I did appreciate. Not as overly complex as some other gueuze producers or blenders out there but still very much enjoyable."
"Notes: It was a delightfull beer to start the college football viewing day. Finishes very dry and cleans up nicely."
"Overall, a good beer, but not a gueuze that I would recommend someone to start with. It may be a bit over the top for the uninitiated, and maybe even too much for some that are. Good overall, but I'd like to see what this would do with a few years in the hole."
"The smell is very appealing, with a soft acidic sourness. The taste matches this character, with a blend of light fruits coming through as well. The mouthfeel is mildly tart, and drinkability is good."
"Easily recommendable but you have to like sour beers."
"The taste followed the smell very closely. It was very sour with a lot of tanins that brought my inner cheeks together nicely. With a tingle of carbonation on the tounge. Sippable nicely done beer."
"It cleanses the palate and has a lasting tart fruity flavor. Obviously, it not the best to choose as a thirst-quencher, but it does well as a palate cleanser or as an accompaniment to a plate of fine cheeses."
"Purchased at City Beer in San Francisco. Undated bottle, cork reads ""SB 15."" Hurricane of carbonation under a thin, dense white head. Smells of leather, cheese, bread, feet, under-ripe fruit. This bottle may be a bit off because there is a strong note of cardboard in the taste. Otherwise, tart lemonade and cereal grain dominate the flavor, along with metal, hard water, grass, musty cheese, salty prezel, and perfume. Tartness is undenyable, but tastefully restrained. Finishes dry, as anticipated. By now, the carbonation has lost it's vigor and the beer seems old and flat, and the skunked taste isn't helping. I will get a fresher bottle and compare them. A bit sticky and vinegar-esque (just a TINY bit). Cheers."
"Aroma is tart and musty with apple and citrus notes. Body is a vibrant gold in color and holds a diminishing thumb thick white head. Fore has some hearty malt notes that are not sweet but rather acidic like ripe fruits. Some definite unsweetened lemon meringue and peel notes. Some soured overripe orange notes appear toward the finish along with tangerine and tangelo. Finish is abrupt crsip and dry. Some lingering mustiness and old cork flavors appear in the aftertaste along with white grapes and apple. Very nice range to it and lots of unameable subtle flavors appear throughout."
"Drinkability - this is good and I'd have another if I was having food during the session as this seems to need to compliment food. If it was just a drinking session, well, I think I'd have no more than one."
"37.5 cl bottle is just the right size. Very nice experience."
"Originally reviewed August 1, 2005. 50cL Bottle. Glowing peach yellow. Aroma is strong with ethers and hexane, backed with figs, cherries and apples. Starts very sour and puckery, with some rubbery sugars. A dose of must. Melds into an almond fruity mellowness. Foams strongly in the mouth. My first Lambic, too sour for me. Best aspect is sugary light lemon aftertaste. Improves towards bottom of bottle, with a little warm, a hint of nice alcohol and a more reduced sourness."
"And therefore, instead of a left-brained, annotated dedicated and ultimately emasculated analytical review, all I can say is that I love this beer. I have given up hope of seeing this beer again, perhaps I will on my next trip to Belgium or at some wild BA convention, and that will be a fine day. But until then, I have my memories of my Sunday afternoon gueuze..."
"Body is below medium and very crisp and effervescent. The sharp tartness is kept in check by a gentle and soft mouthfeel and fluffy texture."
"This is the first Geuze style I've experienced and unlike the others raving about it around me, it will take some getting used to before enjoying it. The tartness is just too much. No hop character, this one was paired with some pretty good cheeses. I just can't get inot this yet, but I said the same thing about barley wines a year ago."
"Golden bronze color, with ample foam. Unappealing smell, which hints of everything lambic, but in a more subtle, gentler way. At its aromatics core, it has an undeniable red apple scent (cut apples sitting for more than an hour, which have slightly browned.) Take a big sniff and you¬íll smell it. To me, it smells cidery and unappealing and most of all, not what I want to sniff in a Gueuze. Apple hints continue upon tasting, although it¬ís more of a green apple flavor, or an apple platter. The sourness is there throughout and it¬ís not sweet, but where is the woody, subtle fruit, funky horsey hints...everything else good in lambic? This is a pretty terrible Gueuze, a total ho-hum blend."
"tart flavors with some dry cider and dry white wine. a touch of lemony sour. so dry your mouth waters, if that makes any sense. refreshing and drinkable, with a nice complexity."
"Very Good."
"An adventure even for the serious beer enthusiast. Pours a thinly, highly carbonated, lightly hazy, canary yellow. Mouthwatering tartness, lemony, muskiness emits from the glass. The flavors are immediately sour, tart, lemony-citrus, barnyardy, musky, pungent, and refreshingly astringent. Citrus characters replaces malty sweetness and added spiciness. Thirst quinching in in its thinness, and rich in its carbonation. Finishes a light drying, tartness. A very good beer for it's style. It's just not an everyday style."
"Drinkability: Good in terms of what this is. I am not sure what occasion would call for such a brew, but I'll know what to get if I should ever encounter such a day. It doesn't really feel like beer to me. More of a wine character."
"This Gueze is dead on for the style; a little young and sharp. Enjoy it now, but put one away for even better drinking in a few years."
"The beer after it pardon and decanting from the 375ml green bottle sets in the glass a beclouded deep amber with a portly and creamy light tan head, after its erosion, the lace forms a tight girdle upon the glass. Nose is that of a wet farmyard, grassy, musky, with a bit of sweetness backed by a citrus like tartness, start is lightly sweet with an immediate sourness at the back, the mouth feel light to medium. Finish is ferine in its acidity, the tartness lingers long, dry as a bleached desert bone and another excellent example of the Gueuze Lambic, a real treat I must say."
"Highly recommended for those who like to live on the sour side."
"Very well done."
"Notes: This was my first foray into Gueze territory. I was impressed by the intense tartness and interesting farm qualities. I¬íll make a return visit shortly."
"The body is a between moderate and full. I think the body is a bit sweet for style and could dry out a bit. Overall a nice beer but some esters and metallic notes are off setting. Much better now than what I remember if from long ago."
"This brew pours a hazey greenish-brown color with a billowing white head. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is tart, sour and sweet. The taste is like the aroma, but not quite as big. The sweetness and the tartness play out more than the sour. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is an interesting brew; one that is worth a try."
"Orange and hazy with fluffy off-white head that lasts. Pretty. Smell of crisp apple or peach; tart and sour. Yeasty. Also some cracker-type malt. Taste is tart and sour! Like maybe some green apple. Dry and appetizing. Makes me want much more. Crisp bite on the palate, some spritz to it. Drinkability: yes, but slowly because it's so dry. I like."
"I feel like my impressions of Oude Geuze Vieille, and consequently this review, have been all over the map. That's to be expected when every sip brings new experiences to bear on a gueuze-ignorant palate. The one impression that has held fast, that hasn't wavered thoughout this entire wild ride is the only one that matters: I love this stuff."
"An interesting and enjoyable Gueuze."
"I am saddened to learn that Oud Beersel - one of the smallest traditional producers in Beersel that may have closed its doors for good at the end of 2003. I hope that I am wrong but I can find no link to the brewery here."
"Taste: This beer has a world of flavor. As it was cool, the flavor was a bit one dimensional toward the lemony citrus, so it went down a bit like fizzy Lemonade. As it warmed, all of the flavors are coming out. It would be impossible to pick out any one sense that is getting bombarded by this beer more. It is remarkably balanced, and somehow leaves the palate feeling sweet and sour at the same time. You have to take your time with this beer, but it is worth the wait."
"It pours a slightly hazy golden color with a 2 finger head that falls to a nice healthy coating over top. Nice. The nose is a light grainey and acidic tart blast. Almost an orangey lemon tart as well. The flavor is nice. The tart sour is up front, but moves quickly to a slight sweet and light graineyness. Very refreshing. The feel is moderate with an active carbonation. Overall, a very nice beer. Another fine beer from our friend that speaks with the ferments."
"12.7oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with two fingers of fluffy white head. There is no lacing. The smell is full of funktastic aromas. Lots of sour and tart, and just slightly sweet to balance it out. The taste is also nice and funky. It's more sour than sweet, and has a nice wheat base. Refreshing lemon on the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and full. The drinkability is great due to the refreshing nature of this beer. Cheers to Chris for bringing this beer to the table."
"Pours a slightly cloudy light amber color with a medium head that falls fast, but leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is very tart/sour, acidic. That's really all I get from it, but it's great. The flavor is very nice. Not as tart as expected, but still has enough sour character to make it great. Very smooth and tasty. Mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Best before date was June of 2026... no kidding. This is a beer you can cellar for a while."
"12.7 ounce bottle, corked and bailed. Best before date was illegible."
"Enjoyed as a 4oz sample at the Belgian Beer Fest 2004. My first Gueuze lambic, and since it was the last serving, the server gave me my sample for free to boot! Pours a very cloudy dark gold color, lighter at the edges, with exceptional carbonation for a lambic. A pure white head. Smell is unusually sour. A very unique taste! Very sour yet quite tasty, this beer is very difficult to review. Very unique, and very worthy of praise. Drink it!"
"After the top has been popped, this brew has a orange hued body, with zillions of little bubbles swirling around. Nice big white head on the top. The scent is tart, not as much horse shit as i was expecting. Quite a tart taste, some sourness that gives you a bit of a pucker. Light farmhouse flavors, yeasty notes, bits of fruit. Quite a dry brew. Im still working my way up to cantillion and co, this guy definately doesnt make me want to run from the style. Me like."
"I am a huge fan of this beer. Mysterious and surprisingly enjoyable. Full character all the way. Special occasions or an occasional treat are perfect times to pop a bottle open."
"sampled at Monk's in Philly. If there is a Belgian beer heaven in the US this is it! 12.7oz. corked bottle. Appearance - straw golden body w/ extremely dense rocky whie head. Aroma - very citrusy (lemon) w/ a background of the infamous horseblanket (although this would be one lucky horse!). Taste - classic geuze taste - tart, lactic, barnyardy and DELICIOUS! My first time with this producer and it won't be my last!"
"Picked up from Jungle Jim's yesterday. I absolutely loved their kriek, so i was excited to try their gueuze. Pours a nice copper underneath a 1 finger white head with a furry of champagne like bubbles. Nose was a little more subdued than I was expecting. Sure there was a nice acidic bite and a small amount of funk but it's not nearly as aggressive as some of the other gueuzes that I have enjoyed. Taste was a definate reflection of the nose, but throw in some oak and apples. Overall it's still a very good beer but not nearly my favorite gueuze."
"This beer pours a well carbonated golden color with a fluffy white head. Smell is a bit weak to me as I was expecting more pungency. The taste is the same way. Slightly sour citric notes and a dirty earthiness that I liked. There seemed to be a bit of natural sweetness to me that matched against the sourness. This gueuze wasn't nearly as sour or pungent as some of the other ones I have had. It was good but sort of forgettable."
"could not read the best before date looks like 2073 .poured a cloudy golden with a big white head. aroma, sour, vinegar, apples, lemon, pine, hints of ginger,with a bit of sweetness. flavor, sour fruits, some cherries, apples, cider vineger, hops, lemons that are on the way to going bad, alcohol.I am not big on this style of beer so my rating is not going to reflect the way I view this beer I do not feel I should give it a bad rating I will try this style again to see if I can start to like this style."
"Dry; bites on the bitter sides of my tongue. Tannin>fruit wood. Lime zest, sour cherries; runs tart to bitter. It's splendid and sparkling. It's effervescent. It's sour with very little sweet, like a trickle of sour juice. There's definite horse'ness' that gets stronger as it warms. Let it warm. Oh, how good it would be with a sausage, cheese and levain bread platter with mustard and barrel-aged kraut."
"Pours a cloudy peach/orange color with a nice fluffy head redolent of rising bread dough. Good and tart in aromatics with lively citrus aromas intermingling with barrel aromas. Smooth and crisp in the mouth and somewhat creamy. Lots of citrus in the flavor profile with bitter lemon and grapefruit at the forefront. The finish is long and bitter. This is good stuff."
"375 ml bottle dated best before 3/14/2022. Pours a clear golden pils color with a volcanous eggshell colored head. Lactic, sour smells mixed with a bit of greenhouse and old leather. Tastes a bit similar to Boon gueuze in the fact that it's a bit sweet, more fruity and honeyed, for a gueuze. There's a small amount of horse blanket farmhouse funk to it, just enough to tie it all together, but I was expecting a bit more for some reason. I wanted my tastebuds to be assaulted. A nice subtle, cheesy hop flavor finished off a lightly tart and mostly malty gueuze. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination, I just wished I'd been assaulted with salivary gland dryness. I'd seek it out again."
"Gueuze is the best style of beer in the world IMHO, and this is a very good one."
"Light in the mouth and fairly tingly. This is a nice beer to sit with for a while, as it is enjoyable in very different ways both tart and refreshing right out of the fridge and slightly warmed, when the flavors have had more chance to develop."
"Very well crafted and excellent for style. Get some bottles of this one and cellar them for a few years."
"Taart. A wine-like aroma, and a cherry and apple taste. Beige-gold color with lots of foam slow to dissipitate. Lemon acid and good carbonation. Very dry, and sour aftertaste. Alcohol seems higher than the 6% at room temperature. Rich, thanks Malto.."
"It's tangy, it's earthy, it's like sliding down a muddy chute through a mountainside lime orchard into a saline sea while unbelievers throw small granite stones at your nostrils. How do you describe this? A pile of Granny Smith peels and hazelnut skins on a wet dog. I love it!"
"Clear light copper tone. Half of a middle finger of dirty white head is formed on the pour. Retention is better than average. Lacing is sporadic. Kind of a weak nose for a gueuze. And it seem actully more sweet than sour from smelling. Candy like to a point. Some sour raspberry notes mix in on the nose a little bit. The taste is sour. And not the lambic type of sour. Rather, the unappealing sour of a rotten apple. Not vinegar sour, but veggie-like sour. This beer's not good. What a shame. It pales in comparison to the Cantillon I just consumed. It really pales..."
"A nice Geuze, but I prefer mine with more residual sugar and less astringency. Better enjoyed as it warms up, allowing the carbonation to dissipate."
"Cloudy amber (I may have decanted some of the yeast, but I thought I was careful). The head is thin and fleeting. The first burst of the aroma is the smell you get after having just bitten into a green apple. Under that is cheeze and hay that has sat in storage for too long. The apples carry into the flavor, but instead of the green apples, it changes more like a cider apple. Very fruity, but there¬ís not the harsh sour punch I was expecting of something like Cantillon. The tartness here is a part of a balanced, but complex, flavor instead of the dominating characteristic. A very drinkable gueuze."
"Cheers Matta for the trade Appearance first strikes as displaying an intense carbonation which feeds a huge foamy white head, very rocky, perfect white and amazingly long-lasting for a sour beer. The body is a cloudy yellow, darker the more yeast is in the glass, champaign alike in terms of bubbling. Bursting and evolving aroma with excentric nuances of old basement, barnyard, dust and lots of bret character. As it warms up, I start to notice more and more a blue cheese character which is very appealing. Not unlike a white wine, white grapes bouquet bursts and at times will even display peaks of pears and orange. In mouth, it is rather cidery with tart apples and brett funk. The finish is very dry, extremely white wine alike, moderately astringent. Mouthfeel is superb, uniquely airy with an incredibly soft carbonation, intense all the way through, but perfectly regular with gentle fine bubbles like a champaign, creamy and superbly pleasant. As stated so many times before, it¬ís a shame that such a good beer, a classic perhaps, will undoubtedly be bound to disappear from the face of earth in the next couple of years. The texture is legendary."
"I have been so excited to try this beer. Pours out a golden orange color with a huge white fluffy head that lasts and lasts. Tons of little bubbles work their way to the top. The smell is sweet, tart, sour and a bit yeasty. The taste is much more mild than I expected. Starts out sour and tart then kind of blends together and fades away. Complex but still smooth. I am shocked at how easy drinking this is. I don't know where I am getting this from but something almost bitter hits you in the middle. I have had the other beer from this brewery (Kriek?) and I think I prefer that one to this. But still, this one is great."
"It pours a beautifulgolden color with a nice sized head. The aroma has a sourness to it as well as some horse sweat. The body is fairly light with a lemon zest character. Of course it is tart and it finshes dry. Not a bad gueuze. Not my favorite, but it still is very good."
"Oud Beersel Oud Gueuze was served from a 375ml green capped and corked bottle, with a ¬ìbest by¬î date of 2022. The cork popped with force...pow! Poured into a Chimay chalice, the gueuze was a murky and glowing yellow-orange color and was topped by a thick, persistant, and fine off-white head that left blanket-like lacing. Vigouous carbonation was observed through the sides of the glass. The nose was moderately sour and lightly wooden, with notes of fermented apple cider and esters of granny smith apple. The taste spoke of a mature and wizened mellow oaky tartness, which held numerous deep and intriguing subtlties. Suggestions of must, oak, earth, sour apples, prevaded throughout...wonderful. It finished dry and quenching, with lingering sour apple peel notes. This beer was very fluffy and bouyant, which paired very well with the flavor profile. Mature and soft, yet deep and charismatic, this gueuze drank fantastically well. I could imagine drinking one of these daily after lunch. Big thanks to jcalbi for making this review possible."
"Corked and caged heavy glass bottle, 2002 vintage. The cork is removed and a deep, dark, golden liquid emerges. The head is thick, and white in colour. The aromas are great, and very gueuze like. Farmyard animals, horse blankets, skunks, wheat, tart non-fruity fruit, and more. The taste is very tart up front with a lovely sweet and sour middle and an everlasting finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for a gueuze, but it works well and the drinkability is excellent. Another excelletly authentic version of this lost style of brew!"
"This beer poured a cloudy yellow color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of apples, lemon and some other citrus smells, but apple seems to dominate the mix. The flavor is of apple, citrus and a touch of spice. The finish was sweet, yet tart. Now this is my first try of gueuze, and I find it much preferable to the heavier fruit versions."
"Complex yet vastly drinkable and refreshing, this is a great Oude Gueuze from the now-defunct Oud Beersel. Hoard this stuff while you can, as it should continue to develop and mature in the bottle for quite a while."
"Taste is very tart and sour but a bit subdued, not overpowering. ""Barnyard"" and salty flavors scorch down the middle of your tongue and linger on the palate. Not sweet but some fruity flavors evident, like light citrus or white grapes (muscat?). A bit thin but has a nice lingering sourness and dryness. Very drinkable for a ""traditional"" gueuze. A real treat."
"Overall: Oud Beersel has always produced softer lambics that never have the biting acidity of some others. But I still like them, if anything these softer traditional lambics are much easier to imbibe all day. It brought back many happy memories of the visits to the Oud Beersel Caf√© on the outskirts of Beersel that I have made since my first visit there in 1994. And it is great to get to try this once again, but I just wonder how many more times I will get to drink this Gueuze from what was one of the smallest traditional producers in Beersel that may have sadly closed its doors for good."
"Very real, and very nice, really."
"Upright, on it's side, just drink it dammit. I chose the latter. The cork exploded out of the bottle. Pours a hazy orange-gold color with a lot of carbonation. Tastes of sour apple and oranges with the tartness you would expect from a lambic. Absolutely wonderfull."
"This beer is very smooth and the bubbles feel very tiny like champagne. It actually was kind of tingly on my lips. The taste had a bit of the yeasty funky sourness of a gueuze, but not at all overpowering. I would say it was maybe more tart than actually sour tasting. This is a very easy drinking gueuze for sure, but do know, it is still a gueuze, no doubt!! if you can find it, get it if you can!!"
"Medium body."
"Overall Impression: A lot of discussion and jokes went on about this one regarding what kind of citrus fruit we could smell and taste. Finally, the consensus was grapefruit which I agree with. It's like eating a grapefruit: initially sour, then a bit sweet, and then bitter."
"A nice deep gold color, with amber notes to it. Fairly clear for a geuze. Well carbonated with a fairly persistent head, that stays with the beer until the end. Smells sour, woody, slightly of urea, lemony, with some musty mushroom character. The first impression of this Geuze is one of sourness with a hint of sweetness. Quite sharp tasting, it cuts through everything. Tastes of tannin and of hay fields (if that makes sense). The body is quite light and refreshing. As my mouth gets used to the acidity the taste softens, I get notes of citrus and slight alcohol, and lot of funky geuzeness. A very good beer, to bad it is no longer being made."
"Has the typical acidic, wild, nearly-rotten characteristics of many lambics. But this one seems a bit more restrained and perhaps balanced. The sour flavors I love so much are subdued ever-so-slightly, and the brew finishes with a bit more of a bitter flavor than all-out sourness. Very much a mellow lambic -- and very easy to consume. I had to hold myself back from really putting this down in a hurry."
"Great with pickled oysters, lemon-brined smelt or cranberry/nettle-stuffed pigeon."
"Medium Orange color. Large head. Aroma is sourish, malts and a touch of barnyard. It was with great trepidation that I opened this beer. One that will never be seen again. I will take a little extra time to savor and enjoy this one. A medium bodied geuze. Sour and tart with hints of leather and old book mustiness. Touch of fruitiness, apples and pears. Tart and sour. Must and leather. Touch of barnyard. WOW. Nice geuze, or did I say that already? Sorry, but I am going to sit back and enjoy this one some more. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"The palate is much more subdued. Its mostly malt, with the sour citric notes and bretty elements fading into supporting roles. No question that its sour - a quick lick of the lips results in a quivering tongue - but it manages to be controlled. Very lightly carbonated, and quite thirst-quenching as a result. Definitely a top-flight traditional lambic."
"Pours like a slightly hazy apple juice, with a huge rocky white head, and lots of carbonation. Aroma is strong with a mix tart, sour, apple, lemon zest, barnyard. Flavor is initially fruity and slightly sweet, followed with a super sourness. Ends very dry."
"This lambic poured clear and golden yellow with only a little carbonation bubbling. The foam was towering and creamy white, and it lasted and lasted, and finally left lace down the glass. The aroma was very pleasant: tart green apples, musty grapes, some citrus, biscuit, and yeast. The taste was tart but not overly sour. Flavors of musty grapes, apples, oak, and a hint of hops came through. The body was medium-light, and the mouthfeel was clean, crisp, and a bit puckering, with moderate carbonation feel. This was a nicely drinkable geuze -- light and refreshing like a champagne. I found this one was best served cold (refridgerator temperature)."
"This fine ale blew the cork as soon as I untwisted the wire cage¬Öso it already has my heart racing. The smell of spicy tart fruit bellow from this brew¬ís large off-white pillowy head. The taste mimics the smell with a nice tart/sour fruity taste with yeast and with a hint of spices and hops. This is my first lambic, and I am in love. It¬ís better than I even imagined! It is light bodied with a warming affect and finishes slightly sweet. This was a great experience and I owe it to McCall for sending it to me. Op uw gezonheid!"
"Apples, pears and flowers come across in the aroma with significantly fewer barn aromas than you would expect from the style. Poured a cloudy orange with high carbonation. Perceived a tarty tanginess as well as an earthy, almost herbal, character. A good beer, but certainly not the best example of the style and for that I have to take off a point or two."
"Altogether an unendingly complex brew with a long finish. Had a sharp zing on the tongue at first settles into a light oily mouthfeel. To top it off, out of nowhere it gave me a creamy tasting burp! It's interesting to feel thie beer develop and dissipate, especially because it embodies the definition of refreshing. Neither strong nor quiet just... well, just. Definitely the freshest aged beer in the world, and debatably the most complex. Thus I loved it."
"Pours a slightly hazy, very pale straw with a huge bubbly head that subsides to a nice creamy covering. Barnyard and tart/sour fruity aromas are prevalent. A quick sweetness starts this one off before turning sour quickly with a nice smooth tartness throughout that lasts through the finish. Big tart fruitiness is everywhere in this bier, rather tasty but not quite as tart and acidic as I would ideally prefer. The tartness makes this brew have a great crispness that goes very well with the medium-light body. Very nice brew but not quite as tart and puckering as I would have liked it to be, I would definitely drink it again though."
"An amazing little gueuze. Nice earthy grassy, sour, acidic nose. Quite complex palate, with a lemony, grassy, earthy and mouth puckering sour palate. Also quite refreshing aswell, a very insane little brew, i liked it a lot."
"This bottle had a drink before date of Mar, 03 2019 ... so this one is a beer that can be cellared for a while. Upright is best IMO."
