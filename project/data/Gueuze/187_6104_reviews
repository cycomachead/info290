"Lighter in body than expected, with a decent tart complexity and very high, refreshing carbonation. Carbonation somehow overlocks the acidic sourness, finishing with a dry, slick aftertaste. Lime and apple sourness hit the palate in a dry but pleasant, uncomprimising way. Requires alomst room-temperature to reveal its sour, fruity layer, but starts to get really convincing then. Still, finish is defined by metallic hints and sour brett flavors, a bit watery, then ending quite tart."
"March 2011 bottle.  Aged nicely, very mellow."
"O - this was my first true Belgian Gueuze and boy is it good. I'm not one to pick up sours on a regular basis, but I do enjoy them throughout the year on certain occasions. This isn't like the great fruit forward lambics everyone has had, this is bringing much more than just one dominant fruit flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional sour.  Great horseblanket and funk going on.  Moderate sourness.  A touch dry.  Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Would serve well as an introduction for someone looking to try lambics or sour beers. Very tart and acidic but well balanced enough to keep it from becoming astringent."
""
""
""
"Taste was very metallic and skunky, and did not have a tart/ sour taste like style should have. I was very disappointed but hoping to try this again sometime but will buy from a different liquor store."
"Lemony tart nose with hints of wet horse blanket. The barnyard nose is more restrained in this than some other gueuzes. It pours hazy light golden straw with a persistent, very stiff, rocky, finely bubbled pure white 3” foam cap. The beer has a big citrus character with lemon standing out with just enough sweetness to prevent your mouth from puckering. Overall it is very dry and refreshing. The body is incredible – very creamy, smooth and effervescent with a very fine bead. It improves nicely with age."
"Taste has musty hints of aged cheese and white pepper along with sour lemon candy. A champagne like feel and a very dry finish. A remarkable gueze!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a classic that I'm surprised to have not reviewed yet. It's a solid geueze that brings all the components and would be a nice introduction for someone who is looking to expand his/her palate in Belgian lambics. It has plenty of the hallmark aromas and flavours that geuezes tend to have, but with a general softness behind these that won't immediately push you away from the glass."
""
"Overall: 4/5 a great example of a traditional geuze"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my first foray into gueuze territory, and it may be safe to say I'm hooked. So much yeast character, so little hop influence, such intensity of flavor without sacrificing complexity. This does seem to peg the style guidelines well."
""
""
""
"I'm trying to get into these Gueuze type beers lately, as I enjoy sour food items, like grapefruit, and sweet-tarts.  This one just didn't really fly for me.  I may need to give it a second chance."
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is a perfect peach pulp in tone.  Head is an easy two inches of crackling foamy light beige.  Nose is super funky and full of interesting smells.  Horse blanket, lime stone, and lemon zest all play very evidently.  There is even a bit of soap playing here.  With first sip you are almost shocked by how much is going on here.  Initial mouth filling funk is spawned by citrus zest and stone sour dryness.  As you drink the sourness rounds out a bit and becomes wonderfully dry and drinkable.  Enjoyable and quite session-able."
""
"A standard of the style, appropriately bubbly with a sharp tang at the beginning followed up by the dry tart citrus.  Finishes very easy."
""
""
""
""
"Nice complexity but slightly off-balanced.  I would like to see more focus on the sour notes as opposed to the funk and spices.  Still worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Looks like a pale ale, ultra carbonated with a huge head that does not like to subside. Smells like funky sour cider. Very tart and effervescent but no easily descriptive flavor. Very interesting"
""
"really wasn't expecting a gueuze this good at the price I will be getting more soon!"
""
""
""
""
"very interesting taste. didnt like it at first but then....."
"This is a pretty good entry level gueuze with some solid flavors."
""
""

"Pours an opaque deep gold with a swiftly rising column of effervescent bubbles geysering from the bottom of the goblet where the stem is attached. The pour produces 1.5 fingers of champagne like, rapidly declining, effervescent, white head that recedes to a solid 1/8th inch cap of dense foam leaving wisps of lacing. Aroma is dominated by sour apples, oranges & tart lemons backed by barnyard wet hay, Brett yeast mustiness & phenolic hints with something like lime sherbet mixed with blue cheese & a little skunk hint buried underneath. Taste is very sour & dry. Phenolic with Brett like barnyard funk, orange, lime & very tart green apples mix with sherbet cream. Finishes smooth, mellow, fruity & bitter but the flavours are short lived producing an aftertaste that is a rapidly fading wet hay bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry, slightly chalky, bracingly tart & very crisp with a faint prickle & astringency."
"Mouthfeel is, right, champagne like. This is a top notch brew. I read Garret Oliver's selection on Gueze's after this and wish it were the other way around. I definitely plan on a food paring with this beer in the near future."
""
""
""
"2012 vintage, still tart and bubbly."
""
""
""
""
""
" What else can I say about this? I wanted to like it and was disappointed. Perhaps it is too radical a departure from the type of beer I'm used to and I just need to develop a taste for it over time. Perhaps it is just not my style. W'ell see."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- easy drinking with just enough puckering sourness"
"Pungent, bitter, not the best from Lindemans, which I normally love"
"Sour #3 of the day and probably the best of all. I'm really liking the funky stuff lately."
""
"The nose on this beet is insane.  I wish my wife would wear this as a perfume.  I don't the she wants a slight scent of horse blanket, but it would do it for me."

"Less sour and more fruity than traditional gueuzes. Strong oak aroma and hint of lemon. Short final of wet bread."
""
""
"This'll be my first Geuze. Picked this one up at The Four Firkins. Pours a clear, pale golden color, with a big white foam head with good retention. A good amount of lacing. Lots of visible carbonation. Aroma is lemon rind, with a hint of grassiness. Reminiscent of sparkling pear juice, with more subtle pear notes. A ton of tartness. Very heavy on the green apple. A little bit of metallic funkiness. An interesting blend. Taste features a good deal of sourness up front. Sour green apple. A bit of yeast. Very crisp and highly refreshing . The sourness is not overpowering, and actually leaves a pleasant tangy resin on the tongue. Light-medium body. Lots of carbonation, but man does this one go down easy. Very crisp and refreshing. Although the sourness makes it difficult to chug, it is very easy to rapidly sip on this one. Very much enjoyed this one as my first geuze, and will definitely be seeking out more."

"A very drinkable, lighter brew with the classic Belgian yeasty taste and bitterish finish. From the 750 ml bottle purchased at Best Damn Beer Store in San Diego."

"Scratches the sour itch. Easy to pour, it doesn't fizz everywhere. Nice for a sipping pint, or with savory food. 3.5 puckers out of a possible 5."
""
""
""
"O-A good gueuze thats drinkable and not expensive. Will definitely be picking up a couple other bottles to age and see how this blended lambic progresses as it matures."
""
"O - This is a damn solid Gueze. Very refreshing and crisp."
""
""
""
""
"clear golden color, light white head, clean light citrus with a moderate tart/funk character.  Slight pepper, moderate to high carbonation, dry finish.  Great for its price."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A real treat, tons of exciting flavors, really refreshing. The Cuvée is waaay better than the ordinary gueuze!"
"A solid gueuze. Not the most complex, but it's got a great flavor and fits the style. Definitely can't go wrong with it and with a ""low"" bottle price, it's worth keeping around all the time."
""
""
""
"I heard that this beer is a good starter to introduce yourself to this particular style so looked around and found one that was brewed on 2011. Uncorking it I was hit with a loud pop from all of the carbonation and bright notes of apple and pear on the nose. After pouring it I was able to appreciate its flavor much more. It has bright notes of crisp apple and a slight undertone of bread with a funky kick to it as well. On the palate it has wonderful rich fruit flavor of apple, pear and peach with a sour tone to give it a tangy flavor. Also, there are wonderful undertones of oak and bread all tied together with a funky tang to give it weight. hopefully after I sample other beers in this category, I will be able to broaden my palate and appreciate them more. However, for now I really love it!"
""
"Overall this is a good Lambic.  It is not very complex and it lacks the fruit component, at least it lacks one specific fruit component, that I am used to from Lindemans but overall it is a solid offering. Personally, I would prefer the Lambics from Lindemans that are flavored with apple, pear, peach etc."
""
"O:  wow.  Funky.  Sour.  Tart.  Balanced.  Great bear.  Will definitely buy again."

"i really liked this one from lindemans, much better than some of their fruited stuff, and a much lighter take on they style than is available from others. its crystal clear after i pour from the capped and corked green glass bottle. radiantly clear really, yeast cake remains on the bottom of the bottle. head is fizzy and white but settles quickly, and there is a real champagne sort of look to it. the nose is only a bit sour, its still definitely blended lambic, no mistake about that, but it hass less of the lactic hotness of others, instead having a light wheat malt flavor and some yeast character other than sourness. its meadowy, springy, floral and very delicate. not a lugging weighty gueuze, but one to really drink up, like a glass of spring white wine, it seems to be the perfect compliment to a chickpea curry, but i can see it working in about a million food contexts. this is a good beer to introduce folks to the style with too, its less caustically acidic but equally refined as the others. i like it quite a bit, and am more excited to crack the bottle of faro lambic in the fridge now too!"

"O: I was hoping for more tart bite throughout, but this beer did grow on me. The transition from sour to ""regular beer"" did take some getting used to, however."
""
""
""
""
"The finish is clean and elegant. The previous beer left a earwax taste in my mouth that lingered, but this beer has cleaned it away quite wonderfully, and now I taste almost cherry-like freshness amidst the sour after notes."

"Poured into a Lindemans stange. Pours a bright golden amber with a two finger pure white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of fruit and sourness are evident immediately on opening the bottle, which is both crown capped and corked, kinda classy. Aroma in the glass is similar, sour apple and grape with funky yeast. Flavor is lemon citrus, apple and grape juice, very tart with wild yeast funkiness. Finishes tart and funky with hints of woodiness. Nice active carbonation makes it look good in the glass and gives a nice mouth feel. The tart fruit and yeast funk were actually not too much more intense than other old lambics, which worked well for me. I'm not a big sour fan, but wanted to try this style, and this satisfied my taste for a champagne like, light sour ale. A fairly classy looking bottle and it looks great in the glass. If I liked sours a bit more, this would be in my fridge all the time."

"Liight orange towards golden in color; hazy. Pours with a rich 2+ finger head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving the slightest amount of foam on the surface of the beer and lacing on the sides of the glass. Nice sour (think green apple), citrusy aroma; made me want to taste the beer. Starts slightly acidic and citrusy, the progresses to a nice smooth sour finish that is slightly tart at the end. I found the taste refreshing and thirst-quenching. Light to medium body, lots of light carbonation that leaves a slight tingly sensation in your mouth. Overall I found this beer to be a solid sour that I would enjoy drinking again."
""

"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and as far as I can tell I think it's a pretty average example of the style and it doesn't really have any tastes or aromas that I think are really well done, it kind of falls right in the middle and that skunky and overly earthy aspect doesn't help. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, not too clean, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think half is a little more than enough for me and I'm glad that I'm splitting this bottle with my brother and there's no way I would want to drink another one in a row. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was pretty good and to me it was the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the skunky aspect and the overly earthy flavors, if this beer didn't have those it might be a lot better. I would buy this beer again, but I would make sure it's a pretty fresh bottle since I don't think aged was too kind to this beer and as it stands now I don't think I would recommend it. All in all I was disappointed with this beer, I had heard good things about and I thought it would turn out to be a good sour, but it just had too many off aspects and in the end that really hurt this beer. This just might be my least favorite Gueuze and my least favorite beer from this brewery. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me, but I hope to try a fresher bottle in the future."

"Overall, this beer just misses the mark. I'd read from multiple sources that this was Lindemans best offering, and if so, that is entirely disappointing. I had hoped to find a readily available and reasonably priced gueuze, but that is simply not the case. I'll stick to St. Louis Fond Tradition and Tilquin for my accessible gueuze needs."
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A very nice gueuze from Lindemans, surprisingly good relative to the rest of their lineup, which is unfortunately artificially sweetened. It's a bit dirtier and heavier for a gueuze than I prefer, but for the availability and price point, it's a remarkable value. Kudos to Lindemans for this, fine stuff."
"Overall, this is a great choice for a regularly available shelf gueuze. Its not a complex or entirely memorable experience, but it is a clean, enjoyable and refreshing sour beer."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."

"O: excellent. If you like funky sour beers this one is a no brainer."
""
"Overall, it was good, but I wouldn't pay the $15 to have it again. i'm not accustomed to gueze styles, though I do enjoy sours but found this a little over-powering. If you don't typically drink sours, I would build up to this."

"Bottle from Bottle Barn on my trip to Cali, shared with beastmaster. Dated May 2013, poured on March 29, 2014. Pours a slight cloudy deep orange color with a half finger white head. Aroma of sour mint leaves, some light citrus, dusty oak, sweet candy sugars. Mmmm. Flavor is citrusy, very lightly sour for a Geueze, and not as dry as I expected. Some juicy pear an lots of sweet and sour flavors going on.a"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. Classic Belgian fruity Lambic character. Classic"
""
""
"I am hunting for this everywhere I go and would love to find it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall one of the better readily available gueuzes. and the price point rocks."
"Pours a nice medium head with dark yellow color. Can't put my finger on how it smells. It smells like a typical lambic beer is all I can say. Taste is somewhat champagne but no sweetness. Nice carbonation, sour and a very slight bitterness at the finish. Tastes like it smells. Has that funkyness that everyone talks about. A very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great Gueuze, perhaps not as extremely sour as some example, its full of complexity and funk. A standard for the style and a must try. I find the other Lambics of this brewery to be too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable, a little less sour than I would like. Very good and much better than I expected from Lindeman's, my only other memorable experience being with their Framboise before I really drank beer."
""
""
"O: Tasty and interesting, but not overly complex. Flavors are not particularly bold or clear, but the lightness to the brew makes it enjoyable. Some to the character of this brew is a direct result of its age, 10 months. Older might be much better on this style."
"As my initial gueuze I was really pleased with this one. Lots of head on the pour, lots of little tight little bubbbles, hazy, orange color. The nose is initially a little tangy, a little funk, followed by some green apples or white grapes with sourdough bread - maybe my favorite part. Taste followed the smell for me - strong tart and sour green apples and 'farmy' funk on top of the bready sourdough flavor. Very tight bubbles and finishes extremely dry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad brew, but I expected more of a complex profile. It would've been nicer for the flavors to be more prominent and for the mouth to be a bit more heavy (just a tiny bit), but I like the light carby feel."
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.25 - Great beer. I think I like the framboise best."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours bubbly gold with thick white head. Smell is funk, lemon, yeast. Taste is sour/tart lemon, lime, dough. Champagne bubbles...cleans the palate. Goes down smooth. Quite refreshing. One of my first introductions to the style and I will definitely be back for more."
""
"Very effervescent, tangy, acidic to some extent. Reminiscent of a champagne to my palate. Dry from the pour until long after the swallow is done. A 750 solo may not have been my best idea but it's something I'll just have to do."

"Outside of Cantillon, this is the best gueuze I have ever tried. While I have enjoyed the fruitier lambics from Lindemans, this is clearly their masterpiece. A complex classic, with crisp, citrus flavors; a refreshingly bitter, dry tartness; and long lasting finish."
""
""
"O - Sour beers really do it for me, so I liked this beer quite a lot, almost by default. Having said that, I felt like as an experience it fell a bit flat; both in terms of looking for a more complex tasting experience as well as a more lively and satisfying mouthfeel. Expected a slightly higher quality brew such as that of the aforementioned Petrus. I can imagine having a gueuze which will really knock my socks off though. Bring on the Cantillon/3F!"
""
""
"very musky sour. excellent carbonation. bottled 11 months prior to tasting. light color, clear until you get to the bottom of the bottle pour then cloudy. slighty sour from front to back but not intensely tart like some other sours. for the price a excellent beer. mild hints of apple and grass. will be buying a few more and cellaring to see what a few more years does."
""
""
""
"O: really quite an enjoyable beer. My first experience with the type and I want more. I find the tartness and funkyness to be so very different than what I am used to drinking. It is a great and exciting change of pace that I will seek out in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A warm sourness permeates throughout your mouth. Slight yeast flavor, but the tartness overcomes. Oily like butter. Very sharp and almost musty. The flavor of this thing pops, I mean just POPS. Amazing. Tastes like: fresh leather, sour apricot, non salted popcorn. 92/100"
""
""
""
""
""
"Who would have known that Lindemans made such a great Gueze. Pick it up if you're getting into this style of beer, as this is an EXCELLENT representation of the style."
"OVERALL : One of the best balanced gueuze I've had the pleasure of drinking. I'm aging a few of I have left, see what happens with this big boy in a few years' time. I'll probably chuck out another review."
"Overall this is my first Gueuze and I don't think I will be ""addicted"" to sours considering the hefty 8 dollar admission. But it was overall a great experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer. It is something that I will seek out to try again."
"O: I feel like these bottles are a bit of a crapshoot. While I'm aware lambics/guezes can be highly variable in flavors based on the random bacteria introduced, if the results are not drinkable then why would they bottle a particular batch. Considering other mass available sours available, this is a terrible choice, with a much better choice being the Duchesse de Bourgogne."
""
""
""
""
"Little bit of funk, lots of sour, and enough malt presence to tie things together. Lacks slightly in character compared to some, but a good sour for those who are into that sort of thing."
""
""
""
""
"My first foray into gueuze-land. Corked bottle pours a honey amber with the froth you would expect from this style. Aroma is acidic, funky, sour fruit, some barnyard with vinous overtones like balsamic vinegar. Taste starts with lemon and pina colada, quickly shifts to sour vinegar, ripe honey, white grape, gooseberry, unripe bramble fruit, all tied together by an earthy funk that at times veers into unpleasant pukey territory but this is probably my inexperience with lambic. Its gets better and more interesting as I tough it out. All acid and no bitter. This has a reputation as a good ""starter"" gueuze and I'd recommend it as such. Morbidly curious regarding what a more advanced gueuze would taste like. Underneath the sour persists a pleasant tropical fruitiness and some cork. Not too hard to track down if you want to dabble in this style."
"Overall: So, so good. The price is right, the beer is incredibly complex while remaining balanced, with none of the flavors overpowering the others; they all work together like a symphony. I would definitely buy this again. This is what beer should be. I don't know what else I can say about it."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Great head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is sour fruits and bread. Tastes like it smells... bready grains accentuated with sour fruity tones. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
"O: not too sure about this one. Its pretty acidic."
"A fairly mild and refreshing sour. It has a pleasant floral cheese quality to it. It pours a clear golden color with a little bit of head. It is lightly sweet up front and then a mild sour that doesn’t linger for very long. it has a light thin and lively body. Not my favorite sour but definitely a good one."
""
"This is probably the best affordable oude gueuze on the market - I believe I paid $7 or so for this. I do wish Lindemans had kept working these sour, musty aromas in their fruit-based beers, as they have a great rustic profile. Oh well, at least there's Cuvée René. Recommended - much better than other large gueuze makers in Belgium."
""
"This is a DEFINITE buy again. For $10.99 it is the cheapest, and in my opinion, one of the best, gueuze's on the market."

""
""
"o: Leaps and bounds better than their sweet lambics, this doesn't measure up to other geuezes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this. This has all of the sourness and funk that's missing from Lindeman's fruit lambics. If you're a fan of the style, this is a great bang for your buck."
"7/10 sourness. Not a bad geuze especially at $12 a 750ml."
""
""
""
"O- My first gueuze. And it was a very pleasant experience. Drinking this has opened a world of beer attributes to me. I think that's why this style is so interesting. The blend of flavors and aromas are exclusive to the gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good news—it's still great. Bad news—the aging didn't seem to do a thing for it, tastes almost exactly like a fresh one. Still, definitely enjoyed it."

"Aged, the carbonation is mellow. Fresh, it's beastly. I like that it's exceptionally creamy, but it's so much so that it just expands in the mouth. It eases off with time, but when you're drinking it fresh there's such a thing as too much. It doesn't take much off, though, and it still starts and finishes crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'll admit I'm not a Gueuze expert, but I really enjoyed this. It seemed nicely balanced between sour and acidic. It was complex enough to keep things interesting. I will definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:   A good gueuze style beer with fruity sourness up front and some nice lactic tang in the middle.  However, it doesn't have the complex funk and bugs I've experienced in other examples.  At about six years, Cuvee Rene is a much more cleaner and straight forward gueuze than others.  Still, a shelf gueuze that delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty solid version of the style and certainly a good introduction, but better ones are readily available."
"Fairly clear gold with some random flaky bits floating around, topped by a thin, wispy head. Smells a bit grassy and earthy, like wet hay and flower petals, along with barnyard, mustiness, spice, and some dry wood. Tart, earthy flavors - not extremely sour or acidic. Floral, dusty lemons, and mineral notes. Very crisp, dry, light, and fluffy mouthfeel with a refreshing puckering quality. This is good and certainly has all the right elements for a Gueuze, though no standout characteristics. For the price, laying a couple bottles away to have a few years down the road is a no-brainer."
"Very nice."
"O - I just wasn't crazy about that little funk bit in the end but otherwise a very refreshing beer for a sticky summer eve."

"We have a golden, hazy beer, with a creamy, white neck. The aroma and taste bring oranges and grapefruit, with a touch of pepper, other floral and fruit (pear) esters, and expressive ""barnyard"" notes caused by wild yeast. The tartness is vibrant, present in the aroma, and dominant in the palate. The body is light, and its acidity balances so well with the fruitness and structure of this beer. The Gueuzes are refreshing and wonderful Belgian beers that amaze me in each experience. The Cuvée Rene is simply fantastic."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy orange with a half-finger white head. There was no lacing on the glass, but it's quite the good looking beer. Scents of brett/barnyard funk, lemon, sour apple and slight sweet notes. Flavor is incredibly sour, with notes of lemon, sour apple, and slight vinegar. Very dry. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with moderate carbonation. This is a very good beer. It's tart, dry and refreshing. It's also not for everyone. It's incredibly sour natureis fitting only for those of us who like things sour. But with a palette that enjoys those flavors you'll find it excellent."
""
"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden yellow topped by a fluffy white head that laces. The nose is mildly sour, slightly skunky/funky, with a sweet citrusy tartness. It drinks noticeably funky with an initial sweetness that quickly washes away and leaves behind a dry, slightly grapefruit rindy bitterness, and a petri dish worth of culture. This is definitely a light bodied, effervescent, straightforward sour that's quite approachable. However, it has a bit too much sweetness and lacks the super dryness I look for in good gueuzes. I think it also lacks some of the complexity I'd expect to find in other gueuzes, but for its price and availability, this is a solid go-to gueuze."
"As far as gueuzes go, this one is a pretty damn good standard and a relatively easy introduction into a more difficult style."

"Poured this Gueuze from a 750 ml bottle. Poured a hazy golden color, produced a thin head, decent retention and left a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of light malted grain and tart fruit. Light in body, the tartness of this brew comes through first, very smooth mouthfeel, malted grain, earthy undertones and finishes dry. For me this is a great beginner lambic brew- Ive had some outstanding lambics, this done is simple, does the trick."
"O: This is my first geuze and I am surprised that Lindeman's actually releases this, since their other lambics and stuff are all sweetened (to my knowledge). I was thinking it was going to be similar to the Rodenbach Classic, but I realize now that that is a different style. Quite good, but very unlike beer and more like kombucha."
"O- There are some flavors and aromas here that are enjoyable, but others are off putting and not quite pleasant. Overall, it was an enjoyable new beer experience, as I am always excited to expand my beer horizons."
"Really quite an exceptional, fairly unique with its big bright aromas and flavors. By far the best Lindemans lambic I've had, and in no way does it seem artificial when compared to there overly sweet and sugary fruited lambics. And for its price point, a real must try to any sour lover that has yet to try this."

"O - This is my second time having a gueuze. The first was the same brew about 3 years ago. I thought it was too much then, now it's delicious. Easy move from oud bruin and flanders red to this. Delicious."
""
""
""
"O- I am thrown off by a little off-flavor at the finish. I am not counting this beer out because it has some really amazing tart and fruit qualities. The funk seems just a little bit off. It's good, but would like to get rid of that iron/protein/blood flavor and have more wet hay and horse-blanket. I would recommend this beer to people first trying gueuze."

"D and O: Really enjoyed this beer. Bout time I got to giving it a formal review."
""
"O – This is a really nice gueuze. Again, it’s not as blisteringly sour as some, but that’s not a bad thing. The balance between the products of Brettanomyces and Acetobacter/Lactobacillus is superb and really helps the drinkability of the beer. Would I like it to be a bit sourer? Sure. But I really don’t have anything to complain about with this tasty beer."
"O: this was fantastic! after trying some newer, hyped gueuzes and other sours lately, and not being impressed, approaching and enjoying this ""older"" example was a thrill!... i had an epiphany that this would go great with a salty, cured meat, and I was right! had a sliver of proscuitto di parma with the last couple sips and it was bangin'!...gotta retry a bunch of gueuzes now and put this one into perspective...this is truly one of the best!"
"O: A good gueuze, besides the slightly muted taste."

"Overall I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this beer. Certainly much different than most of the other beers out there. Worth a try when in the mood for something different or for those who love sours."
"So, not sure how to really review this, not like anything I have tasted. Pours light copper with white foam. Hazy/cloudy. Sour nose, powerful. Sour cherry taste, very much so. Some apple cider notes. Loads of flavor and taste."
""
""
"Price is $7- reasonable. Very enjoyable and complex beer. Not for the sour faint at heart, but a fun and dramatic beer to try and enjoy the brewer's work."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: What a really complex beer style. There is a lot of things to take in. This is not a style of beer that is for someone who is new to craft beer. $5 for a 375ml bottle of beer. Great price to get your feet wet with this style of beer to trial and see if you like the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer overall. I think this is my first gueuze. While it's far from my favorite style, I can say I appreciate what Lindemans has done here. I wouldn't mind revisiting this one at some point in the future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Primarily loads of lemon juice, apple skin and vinegar. Not necessarily my favorite style of Sour."
"Taste: Instant tartness disippates into a fruity character, then a late musty finish. Perhaps a little on the mellow-side, but overall a very nice beer which is far too easy to drink. A beer to cellar, and open under the right circumstances."
""
""
"D - An excellent brew, and for the style, based on my limited knowledge, is done very well. Possibly a tad sweet for a traditional gueuze. Super drinkable, with a nicely balanced profile and crisp, refreshing feel."

"The beer pours a very light copper color, bordering on light orange and dehydrated piss yellow. A fizzy white and rocky head appears and quickly fizzles away like a soda, leaving a light scrim and ring on the glass. The beer’s body is very cloudy, with haze hiding all of the other side of the glass from view. Carbonation bubbles are a constant stream running up from the bottom of the glass. On the nose the beer smells richly funky, with spicy hay, light fruit leather, and heavy brett smells. Light smells of cherry are also present in the sweet fruit leather smell. The beer tastes sweet and fruity with wonderful barnyard funk in the beginning of the taste. Tart flavors are light and controlled, but lovely, and lemon notes definitely come through in the tart taste. The beer begins light grass and hay, moving into barnyard funk and light fruit leather before opening into lovely lemon characters and then moving into more barnyard hay and the supposed “horse-blanket” flavor. The aftertaste is grassy with nice hay notes and as it warms there are also notes of wheat spice and light banana in the esters. On the mouth the beer feels sharp with carbonation before mellowing into a medium to light body with nice tart puckering in the mouth. The mouth is left quite clean with only a slight scrim of saliva. Overall this is a solid gueuze, some nice barnyard character, and some great balance between the tart, sweet, and funky flavors. This beer is a success from Lindemans, with some great lemon characteristics. A must try for sour fans."
"Taste is quite tart at first, with the sour being mostly lactic acid and some minor aetic acid tones. After 2 sips the beer is tart but never goes overboard on the sour. No aggresive tartness. This is one of the greatest benefits of this beer, it is tart but never mouth puckering. The beer nicely balances the tartness with enough body. There are nice fruity, earthy flavors which are backed up by a subtle wood taste. The beer is quite drinkable and for me a very rounded gueuze."
"O - My first gueze! I am a bit surprised that I found the sourness to be relatively subdued, but it really enhances the whole experience. This stuff is beyond complex - I will definitely be exploring the style further, and will pick up more of this one for sure!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty damn good Gueuze and I am glad that I can find this around now. I will for sure stock up on this for the cellar."
""
"Overall- I liked it. A lot different than other lambics. I'd love to try more Guezes."
"Not much needs to be said. Sit down with one of these and learn something about beer, and about yourself."

"B 87-88"
"Nothing world-class here, but it's tough when your competition includes breweries like Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen. Nevertheless, this is still decent for a ""shelf gueuze", especially considering the fact that it can be purchased almost anywhere in the United States. Relatively cheap for the style, too."
""
""
""
"Very bubbly, lots of great Brett/pedio aromas. Let's not forget the price point in comparison to it's competition. I got some red apple right in the midst of all that sour. Very complex and tasty."
"Overall this certainly a pleasant beer. I haven't had many Gueuzes thus far but this is certainly one that's worth a try and quite easy to find. Comparing this to Drie Fontienen Oude Gueuze, I like Lindemans Gueuze less overall but it has a much better value and is certainly easier to come by than almost any 3F offering."
""
""
"Medium to slightly light body, solid carbonation, has a fairly crisp and refreshing feel. One of the best products from this brewer, I'd say. Under 10 bucks for a 750ml bottle makes this a excellent bang-for-your-buck purchase as well."
"O- A wonderful example of a Gueze."
"M: Light bodied. Leaves a sour film behind."
""
"O-I suppose this beer lived up to its billing as a drinkable, if not unique brew. I was not bowled over by it, but it paired pretty well with the smoked salmon burgers I had for dinner. An easy drinking gueuze, if there is (or should be) such a thing."
"O: Wonderful to drink as long as you know what you’re getting. It’s a beginner’s gueuze, but gueuze is not a beginner’s beer...at least not in the U.S. I am having some trouble reviewing this because it’s the only gueuze that I’ve had (I’ve had this three times). The best comparison I can make is between this and Beatification which was far more intense."
"Somewhat hazy pour. Aroma had a hint of plastic in the smell which is the only reason I marked it down. This beer has a dry finish that makes it easy to just keep drinking. This is in part due to the really vigorous carbonation which makes the drink light and airy. Such a nice example of the style and I'm so happy that it's locally available."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled 8/12/2011. Pours fairly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of huge sour apple, pear, lemon, grass, wet hay, leather, vinegar, earth, pepper, funk, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of tart lemon, pear, apple, grass, earth, wet hay, pepper, herbal, light funk, and yeast spices. Fair amount of earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, pepper, herbal, grass, hay, and earth on the finish for a bit. Moderately dry on the finish. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying tartness or acidity at all. Very moderate and refreshing amount of tartness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Gueuze! Very well balanced with good complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink. Though this is not as complex as some of the other higher regarded offerings; this is a beer than any true gueuze fan would definitely enjoy. Great value for the price as well."
"D- Not the most complex geuze that I have had but it is nuanced and blends well. Not so sour that I would mind drinking a few in a sitting, unlike some of this style (Oud Beersel for example)."
""
""
"This has become one of my go-to beers. Delicious stuff."
"If there are ""big"" beers and ""small"" beers...then this is a ""small"" gueuze. But that isn't a bad thing per se. It was amazing with a fresh brie. It's a fantastic entry into the style and is a great drinker, but it's just not as complex as others."
""
""
"O: very impressive with a strong sourness and some great flavors. easy to find and well priced"
""
""
"O: good beer, but not great. It lacks the complexity of some of the other belgian lambics, but at $7 for a 375 ml bottle it's worthy to be purchased again."

"My second sour beer, however, this makes the first one not seem very sour in comparison. Good stuff though. Very good stuff. I will have to try more geuzes. This bottle was very fresh too, so I would like to see what some age does to it."

"(4.0) D: Being new to this style I might have to revisit this one again in the future, but my first impression was a very good one. Surprised at how complex the flavour was despite the initial dominant sour aroma. Impressed."

"O: A good, but not very complex Gueuze. Not as good as 3F or Girardin, but a good choice for the availability and price."

"Final Grade: 4.07, an A minus. Lindeman's Gueuze Cuvée René is an interesting, refreshing changeup from the IPAs, hefes and ambers that have made up the majority of my beer intake this summer. This is good stuff, perfect for introducing a newbie to the world of gueuzedom, but not something I plan to seek out or hoard in the future. Decent value for the price, and worth a try for anyone curious about the style."
""
""

"o: not a fan and probably wont buy again. does not compare to the few others i've had for the style. way too much acid without having a nice sour blend to it. aftertaste reminds me of acid reflux."

"Summary- just a very pleasant gueuze all around. I have enjoyed it on several occassions and found the different lots to be consistent."
""
"D - Very champagne-like. Light, dry, drinkable."
""
""
""
"I don't know if I will even be a huge fan of this style, sourness and sting is pretty overwhelming. However, this one has a lot of complex fruit flavour to it. Great depth, this beer is an experience for sure. Fans of Lambics should give it a try, but not sure I'll be stocking up."
""
""
""
"O: It's good, maybe B+ to A-. I just think that in this category there are much better options out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit plain in flavor and too spritzy for my liking, but this was an easy drinking gueuze with a moderate acidic bite. Worth checking out if you are getting into the style, but it doesn’t compare to the other great gueuzeries of Belgium."
""
""
""
"Pours a yellowish hue with a fizzy head that isn't lasting, though remains as a ring for longer than expected. Aroma is delicious with cherries, tartness and citrus on the nose. Body has many of the same flavours in it, and matches to perfection with the chosen food. Acidity is light, which keeps this as a solid sour that is ""entry-level"" perhaps, but it has won a friend of mine as a convert."
""
""
""
""
"A very well balanced and smooth gueuze. School!"
"I enjoyed this, got even better as the bottle went on, i should age a few and see how acidic i can get them, i like acidity. A great beer that is always on the shelf, which is great."

"Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, I like it. I hope this is what gueuzes are supposed to be like."
""
""
"Light bodied, low carbonation, dry, and mouth puckering. Very nicely made, and refreshing."

"O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink for the style with the extra sweetness and not as intense sour/funk. Definitely a sipping beer though."
"Overall a good tart fruity brew with a nice sweet sour ending..."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O- For my first foray, I am very impressed. I would love to try an older version. It went well with strawberries and I'll bet some soft cheese would be good too. I can't say how this stacks up yet so I'll probably revisit this after trying some other examples of the style."
""
""
"750ml bottle pours a hazey orange. Couple cm of head which fades but leaves tiny bubbles floating on the surface. Musty faintly sour smell. Tastes exactly how it smells which is a good thing. I would prefer a little more but it has a nice sour flavor. Good enough to get my fix without spending a fortune. Overall a very refreshing brew for a 90 degree day laying in a hammock!"
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with a slight bit of wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is medium to medium-high, suited well for the beer's body, making this fairly crisp on the palate at first, then becoming smooth as the carbonation extinguishes itself. Closes out dry."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer at an obviously young age."
"O - Loaded with flavours, many of which creep up on the finish, making for a complex gueze. Definitely worth seeking out, and I wish I had grabbed a few extra bottles when they were available. I'm glad I was able to hang on to this one for as long as I did."
""
""
"Overall this was a nice introduction to the style, but I have a feeling they get a lot better than this. I hear this style ages well so I think I'll grab another couple and see how a couple years in the cellar changes things. Recommended to anyone looking to dip their toes in the sourer side of Belgians. Cheers!"

"Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3 Fountains’ Gueuze glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a two finger white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, fruit, funk, and lemon rine. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, lemon zest, citrus, sour, tart, earth, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were really well balanced and intense. This made the brew really easy to drink and rather enjoyable for myself. Crushed the 750 mL without any problem. Could probably have drank a bit more, but I’m not a TOTAL lush. Get your palate on this Gueuze lovers… You won’t regret it."
""
"O- Very interesting. It is good. Very nice and sour, the style just isn't quite my thing. Has a very classy feel to it. I would definitely like to have this with a nice hearty meal. Probably wouldn't buy again otherwise though."
""
"This beer is up and down, but boy am I happy I poured it. Incredibly refreshing, and just what I was looking for this evening. Thank you Lindeman's for making a good, inexpensive gueuze! I will be drinking it again - there isn't another widely available value like this in the world of lambics."
""
""
"O: I miss the more fruity finish of a kriek (personal preference) but this is very good."
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Pours a light burnt orange color with a decent cap of fizzy white head. It smells like a gueuze (which makes sense I guess). A tart lactic aroma up front with a light brett funk behind it, definitely in the wet hay spectrum of aromas. The taste was good, not terribly complex but interesting enough to keep me coming back for more. The mouthfeel was very nice, a medium high level of carbonation and very dry body make this extremely drinkable. Overall, a very solid everyday gueuze, readily available though not as complex as some of the other offerings out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This fits the flavor bill for the geuze style. If you haven't tried one, then this is very easy to pick up at most stores with a decent beer selection."
"OVERALL: Perhaps this one was destined to come up short being put after the Drie Fonteinen. Unfortunately we found this relatively one dimensional and boring all around. Less flavor and less character made this one quite uneventful. However, the comparison to the 1994 bottle was extremely impressive indeed. It looks like 20 years has done this beer good, or perhaps the 1994 bottling was far superior. Either way, this was a lot of fun and I appreciated the chance to try a comparison like this. Thanks again for the opportunity guys!"
""
"O: An intense, in your face sour. I'd love to try more like this. I haven't had many sours, but this is insanely enjoyable."
""
"I don't have a lot of experience with this style (this was my first one), and since I want to store some gueuze in my basement I figured I had better try one first to see how I like it. It is tart and refreshing and quite enjoyable, though something I would want to drink only occasionally."
""
"The flavor left me longing for more sour (especially after a year in the bottle), but the tartness is there along with fresh-cut wood and melon rind. The body is juicy, yet equally dry on the finish with no room for lingering flavors. Carbonation is spot-on, making the mouthfeel light and crisp. Overall, a tasty Gueuze that really caught me by surprise. I bought this on a whim, and was glad to see it outshine Lindemans' sugary-sweet counterparts (framboise, kriek, etc.)."

"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style traditional Gueuze. Drunk ""too young"" but at cellar t°."
""
""
"I've also had a bottle that was sour beyond recognition. This is a Gueze that should always be in the refrigerator when you are drinking without a special event."
""
"overall - I love the apple and citrus notes. I bought this at my local liquor store and it was only $7.99. I think that this is an amazing value for this beer. It's balanced, and tart, and mouthwateringly delicious. I'm probably going to pick up a bunch more of this. Great entry level sour."
"O - Overall this is a very enjoyable and easily accessabe gueuze. Lots of really solid aspects too his gueuze. Very nice."

"Morey's Bottom Line: I've had a couple of other Sours, but truth be told, this is my first Gueuze. It's definitely unique, and I'd like to try other within this style. This was recommended as a good starting point, and I agree."

""
""
""

"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I’ve enjoyed sipping my way through this one more than I expected to given my earlier experience with their Faro. (That beer was overly sweet and contained an artificial sweetener. Almost all artificial sweeteners give me a metallic aftertaste that I find unpleasant, to say the least.) My overall impression is that this is indeed a good well made geuze that I’ll be happy to have again given how well the flavors work together and its price relative to others. This is also a good starting point to try the geuze style since it is nowhere near as sour or aggressive as some can be."
""
"The carbonation on this is high. It's a light bodied beer due to this, and keeps flowing over the tongue, doesn't leave a sticky residue or get bogged down."
"I was genuinely excited to try this beer. I was so afraid of Gueuzes because of the lambic blend, but I soon realized these aren't sweet like Krieks. The bottle is really packaged with care and creates an air of specialty when opening and pouring. This is a very complex, funky beer. The sourness masks the complexity a bit. At times I felt like I was biting into an unripe lemon, and other times I felt like I was drinking a beer that was a byproduct of a sweaty, funky brewer. I feel like I'll pick out different flavors each time I try it, though. Makes me want to try it again."
"Overall: I found it to be challenging but good. Strong from start to finish. Not a style for everyone maybe but worth giving it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M-light and bubbly, maybe drinkable in large amounts, not sure because I only had a glass and would go for more, not sure if acidity would cut on this."
"Overall: A nice balanced geuze. Not too sour or abrasive, but it delivers the goods and the price is right. Tasty little beer."
""
""
""
"O - This is a really drinkable beer. It goes down easy, and the flavor is really nice. It has a bit of a refreshing quality to it. Overall, I really enjoyed this one, and I think it is a really nice example of the style. I recommend trying this one out. It tastes great and the price tag is low compared to a lot of other Gueuzes out there. I would buy this one again."
""
""
""
""
"Fruity, yeasty and bready aroma is enticing. However the sourness of the taste overwhelms all else for me. Realize this is my own tasting deficiency rather than a fault of the beer, but it will be some time before I invest in another bottle."
""
""
"While this does not reach the complexity of some other sour beers (i.e., it's not a Cantillon), it is a very good gueuze. It gets bonus points for the fact that it is relatively easy to find and about as cheap as a sour gets. For this reason, it is greater than the sum of its parts."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is my second example of the style, first was Oud Beersel and this is probably my second favorite. The one thing that would make this beer better would be more prominent funk in the taste. No matter this is an excellent beer and one I will come back to again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great geuze! Wonderfully priced and a great aperitif, as well!"

"O - I wouldn't turn one of these down in the future but it really isn't anything mind blowing, just a solid example of the style. I may have to go back and grab a few more of these and see how they are drinking in a few years..."

"The cork came out of the bottle with no pop or anything so I hope there isn't something wrong with this one. Pours a murky honey orange with no head and no lace. The lack of head and lace combined with the absence of cork sounds make me think there is a carbonation issue at hand. Smell is of cork, damp wood, and some funky/sour aromas. Taste is mainly of funk and sour flavors but pretty tame overall. A bit acidic in the throat. This beer has almost no carbonation with a pretty flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good gueuze as is but I have had other bottles of this that were much better (and more carbonated). I am sure there is some sort of issue with this particular bottle. I will have to revisit this one in the future."
""
"O- This one ends up being a bit of a chore for me to drink but that's common with most sour beers I've had. Done well, just not my thing."
"This is a tasty gueuze that, at seven bucks, wasn't prohibitively expensive or too hard to find. Would have it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I give two Schlitz about this Belgian treat and standard bearer of the style."
""
""
"Most of my experience so far with sours has been with Cantillon, so there is a level of complexity that I'm missing here but comparing anything to Cantillon is a little unfair. Still, this is obviously a very solid gueuze presenting more than enough funkiness to satisfy. I've seen it stated that Cuvee Rene offers the best quality for your dollar when it comes to gueuze and I wouldn't doubt that. I would love to have a bunch of these around for the summer."
"Initially, it's very tart and the fruit characteristics are very prevalent. Lots of sour apples, grapes, and a touch of orange rinds. The funk taste comes through a little on the back end as well. It's medium bodied and a bit fizzy, but finished quite clean. Overall, this is definitely one of the better sours I've had right off the shelf and certainly would only get better with some age."

"A great gueuze and a pleasant surprise."
""
"This is my first gueuze, so I can only compare it to descriptions of the style, which it seems to match well. To me this tastes more like a wine or champagne than what I'm used to calling a beer. May take some time to get used to sour beers!"
""
""
""
"O- It hits all the right notes for a gueuze. When it comes to beers of this style, this is a worthy try."
"O: This is a great intro Gueuze for folks. Mostly tart, one dimensional, none of the funkiness some of the more renowned gueuzes are known for."
""
""
""
"O: a really great brew, so interesting and complex, really nice, glad to have this as my first gueuze"
"O: Really nice beer, nice and approachable gueuze at a great price. Certainly going to be picking up some more of this."
""
""
"M - Thin body with intense carbonation. A delight to swish each sip around a bit. Finishes semi-dry and tart (but not puckering)."
""

"750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy light amber with a two finger white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is some light funk, some cheese, lemon, and a bit of lactic presence, The initial taste is a bit of tart lemon. Then comes some funky cheese and some earthy notes. The finish a has a light tartness and a bit of funk. Light bodied. Low carbonation. This is certainly the best Lindemans beer I have had, but it is certainly a significant step down from other gueuzes. It was enjoyable, but the flavors are pretty bland compared to a world class gueuze."

""
"O- I would buy this again, but wouldn't name it among my top five favorite lambics."

"O: This was my first gueuze and I am upset I haven't tried the style sooner. Super refreshing, tart and the perfect amount of funkiness for me. Outstanding."
"O: I was promised this would taste like multiple aged Lambics and I can't say that they lied. I could picture myself casually drinking a Lambic, but this is something I could honestly say I was not prepared for."
"Overall, this wasn't a bad Gueuze, but the sourness left it seeming a bit simple and lacking. Perhaps some age could do this one some good."
"This gueuze pours a hazy golden color with little bits of sediment and a huge white head. Smells of barnyard funk, a bit of vinegar and maybe a touch of lemon. Tastes of sour apples, lemon, a touch of vinegar, some yeast funk and spice are the most evident. Very tart and puckering.. Leaves the mouth watering from sip to sip as any sour tends to do. This is a Great belgian sour beer. "
"For being so easy to find and cheap to buy its very good. However, it isn't quite as sour as I'd like, Cantillon and 3F have a much more sour funk and this is just lacking that. The Mouthfeel is very nice and full though, creamy and rich. The finish is dry and barnyardy. Quite approachable for a new sour drinker."
"D: Quite drinkable, defiantly a good beer - my favorite of the Lindemans so far."
"O - A very solid Geuze"
"O: Really cool beer, not my favorite of the style but up there."
"Very enjoyable and unique."
"Awesome stuff. As good as any sour I have ever had. Period."
" I like the taste much better: slightly tart, hints of malt in sweetness and in the body, with a bitter and slightly tannic finish akin to fruit peel. Phenolic. Funky notes here and there but very subtle. Prickly carbonation and dry finish. Very bubbly and refreshing. I will buy it again when I am feeling sour, but I wish it were more intense."
"An accessible, relatively simple, and inexpensive gueuze."
"wish it was a little more bold in the nose and mouth."
"Overall, good stuff. Very complex. Quite enjoyable."
"O - Clean and crisp, a refreshing sour beer. Perhaps a bit shallow."
"This pours a cloudy, golden color. Smells wonderfully funky and sour. Thin foam but lots of big bubbles on the pour. Very effervescent which gives it a lightness to the taste and mouthfeel, but really tart. A dry, distinct finish. The tartness dominates. I get some green apple, but in a good way. Reminds me of Bell’s Wild One and Unibroue’s Ephemere."
"Overall – While the taste is definitely interesting, I didn't find it all that complex. Perhaps with a little age the taste will develop a little bit more. I couldn't taste a whole lot besides the tart citrus and the vinegar."
"O -- first beer of this style but very enjoyable; great taste, crisp like champagne but sour and full of complex flavors. Lips still sour after a few sips."
"I'm slowly making my way into the world of sours/geuezes and I found this to be very enjoyable. The sourness is there from beginning to end but it was never overwhelming or made me think twice about taking the next drink."
"Small piece of advice, pour this into a thin walled glass and let it sit, it kills the soda pop carbonation and allows the gueuze flavors to shine."
" I enjoy most guezes/lambics at warmer temps. than suggested and found this to warm up from tart and slightly sharp to more fruity and mellow sour. The initial taste that stood out was of mussels! I would pair this beer to a plate of straight up steamed and unspiced mussels. I enjoyed this super affordable gueuze from the Budweiser of lambic producers."
"O: A good beer. This is not something I could drink everyday, but definitely enjoy on occasion."
"Note: Labeled as 5.5%"
"Effervescent, light and crisp. Overall a very good beer but lacking the depth and the delicate nature of some other in the style."
"There are a host of reasons why Cuvee Rene is a great starter sour. In addition to the relatively innocuous tartness, the price tag really cannot be beat - my $10.75 bottle was on a shelf next to a $13 375 mL of 3F Oude Geuze. In a pinch, this is a great sour pickup."
"Gueuze is the shit, I don't know what else to say!"
"Overall: Not the most complex tasting gueuze, but a good tasting example that's a bargain to boot. This beer is readily available and priced very well for a gueuze. This is definitely one of my go to beers."
"Bottle 37,5 cl."
"O- Great value. I we could get this in TN because it really is a decent, mouth puckering beer."
"O- very solid beer. Great beginner sour"
"This could be my favorite in the Lindeman's lineup, and while it might not get the high accolades of some others in the style, it's a readily accessible and relatively inexpensive offering. Good value!"
"Overall: This is a nice introduction into the gueuze family."
"Overall-I can see why this beer is considered an entry level queze. It's very easy to drink, the tartness comes through. A beer I would definitely drink alot more often."
"A very gentle pour into a Duvel tulip still yields 1.5 fingers of white head sitting atop a hazy deep golden beer. Aroma's a mix of funk/musty notes along with tart green apple, perhaps slightly dominated by the tart/sour components. Funk is more noticeable as it warms. Taste is of citrus (mostly lemons?) as well as the noticeable barnyard funk. Not overpowering in terms of sourness, but still provides a lingering reminder in the cheeks while remaining crisp and refreshing. Light to medium-bodied and high carbonation gives this a nice lively mouthfeel. Inexperienced with the style, so waited until my 2nd bottle to give this a review. The sourness was not as intense as I expected, but I found this to be refreshing in this warm weather, all the while hoping for a bit more complexity."
"The appearance is good, a slightly hazy very pale yellow color with a slight golden hue, the head was very large and in off white, but its quickly dissipating. The smell I get some cider vinegar, a little musty, a little funk and some sweetness. The feel is mostly light and quite a bit of tartness. The taste is pretty good, I get mostly the tartness at first, but its more mellow than I expected (I've never had this fresh so I figure its mellowed out because of the age), after the initial tartness, I get a little fruity sweetness. This is way better than the overly sweet fruit lambics they also produce, too bad its so far to find around where I live (Framboise is everywhere though). Overall a pretty good beer, one I'd love to try fresh when its full force, but still good stuff."
"Pours a clear golden color with a two-finger white head and some spotty lacing as it goes down. The nose carries a mild amount of funk and some lemon. Nothing too complex, but fairly nice. The flavor doesn't take it to the level that I expect from a really nice gueuze, but it does go down easily. Nice funk, but it needs to be a bit strong with greater complexity. Light body and good carbonation. Dry finish. Funk throughout, though it's mild. Pretty good and easy-drinking."
"D: I can't compare it to much else as it's the only gueuze I've had, but it seems to be pretty solid. The flavour profile seemed a bit shallow even after acclimatising to the initial bitterness, but it's well worth trying if only to make you rethink what beer is. Piquant."
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a great starter into the realm of sour beers."
"Liked it quite a bit for my first lambic (though not my first sour by a long shot.)"
"Overall, an okay gueuze. Lacking in aroma but the lemon and earthy hay flavors are nice. A more approachable take on the style, and something I try to suggest to people when wanting to try a gueuze for the first time. Also, it's availability and price is nice which helps my overall opinion of the beer."
"Conclusion: A masterpiece. This isn't the best gueuze I have had the pleasure of tasting, but it is still a wonderful beer. Please go buy this and drink it with a friend."
"O: definitely interested in trying other geuzes now. I don't think I have a strong palate for the flavors yet I well definitely develop one!"
"Though I've had a few brews that stylized themselves as gueuze, this was my first approach at something more authentic, and I have to say I'm digging it. That sour acidic taste is no longer something I'm avoiding, but rather something I'll actively seek out. Brews like this challenge one's perceptions of what a beer is, and the rewards are well worth the exploration. But, I totally understand if a lot of people will hate this, because its very, very different."
"Pours a cloudy light wheat golden with some white head. Nose is funky, yeast, banana, apple. Taste is sour, tart, bit of wheat in the finish; mostly sour apples, sweet. Mouthfeel is moderate, medium body. Overall, not digging the style, not something i'll return to."
"Smooth, tasty stuff, and better than I expected from Lindeman’s."
"M - Light body; moderate carbonation."
"This is a very nice lambic. The flavor is pure and smooth. It has some great well balanced flavor as well."
"Overall pretty good, but can't say I was blown away by this. It definitely feels salty more than anything which is interesting. Enjoyable I would have it again, and probably a reason why this is the most reviewed Gueze on beer advocate."
"Drink (4.5/5) - This was a great brew. Both very drinkable ad intensely flavorful. The brew would have been perfect, if not for the problems with its looks."
"Pours a dark, hazy golden yellow/orange colour and it didn't gush with foam like I was expecting. Tastes a little like sour candy, with some apples and pear in there, with a dry finish. It wasn't has hard to drink as I was expecting as I am new to sours. It would be hard to drink more then one of these in a sitting though. its a fitting summer beer though."
"Light airy body with a strong sourness that pulls at my cheeks; this beer is a delicious treat that I can drink anytime!"
"O - I just wasn't crazy about that little funk bit in the end but otherwise a very refreshing beer for a sticky summer eve."
"Overall Impression- This is now tied with one of my favorite Gueuze beers! Great qualities, sour, mouth puckering, and the goaty and malty characteristics are well blended. The only complaint with this one was the price... Will be looking to see if I can get a reduced price @ the Liquor store!"
"This is supposed to be a starter gueeze or lambic. It's really a nice beer and something I could easily have again and again. This hits the spot on a hot day."
"the CPJ"
"Poured into a large wine glass two two fingers, decent head and some lacing - an orange amber color - Smell is yeasty, some fruit and banana - Taste - is sour and earthy, funk, really unpleasantly balanced - like a funky dry sweet wine - not so much yeast/banana - Mouthfeel is dry, medium body and carbonation - Overall I was very disappointed in parting with $6.45 for this brew - could be it is not my style but I will not be grabbing this again."
"My first Gueuze, technically, but it definitely mirrors the experiences I've had with a lot of sours- a touch harsh and unharmonized upon first pour but nicely comes together over half an hour. The flavors in this were pretty straightforward, but they were intense and balanced- that is if you prefer your sours to lean more toward the barnyardy side of things- and the brew itself wasn't puckeringly tart either. There was enough of that chalky creaminess and slight sweetness to round out the acidity. I don't think I'd take a Gueuze over an Oud Bruin but this is solid for the style."
"Sour, yet highly drinkable. Awesome unripe, but overrripe fruit tones."
"Overall I'm really liking this brew. It mixes various aspects of beer that I happen to really like, such as sourness, fruitiness, dryness and ease of drinking. Coming from this brewery, I'm not surprised it's good."
"Bottled January 2010. Poured into my brooklyn tulip, pours a murky gorgeous orange yellow color. Awesome foamy head that stays around forever. Big bubbles, and the funky smell permeates from the bottle. Smell- funky cherries, tart barnyard funk, white wine grapes, peppery lemon scent? Taste- puckering sour, cherries, maybe a hint of pepper and lemon sourness. Wow. I'm in love."
"Easy drinking for a style that's hard to take, but I can't help feeling it's a little green right now."
"O: Don't have the taste for this style yet. Don't know if I will ever develop one or not. I will keep giving it a shot, for now. As of now I don't like this style. Don't know what all the rage is."
"Hazy orange colour, two fingers of white head, little retention with spots of lace. Smell is full of wild yeast, barnyard notes, horse blanket, floral points, funky with yeast and wheat, subtle citrus and fruit notes. Taste is initially tart, nice sourness, yeasty, sharp citrus, lemon, funky, green apple, dry and fairly complex. High carbonation, full body, lightly syrupy and a nice feel overall. Really good stuff, easily drinkable, could drink lots of this stuff easily, outstanding."
"Poured a translucent golden orange, 3+ fingers of white ehad which fades to a collar and some light head. No lacing to speak of. Nose is mildly funky, lemon, green apple, skins of an unripe green grape, dried citrus fruit character and a mild sour note. Some general champagne-like character. Taste is quite tart off the bat - acetic, lemon and orange zest. Very dry, and mildly wheaty. Flavour is somewhat short lived on the palate, although the tart feel lingers well on into the finish. This helps quite a bit in terms of helping you pull this back to your mouth for more! Highly effervescent and active on the palate, and this helps add a substantial refreshing characteristic to this. Light body and feel, a simple and effective gueuze."
"D: It's funny, this is one of those beers that's greater than the sum of its parts. I would not want to drink it all night but still worthwhile."
"I can see why this is such a highly rated beer from Lindemans. It's not overly sweet, sugary or off course and obscure for the style. To me, it tastes very traditional and grounded in its Belgian roots. Since this was the only bottle in my cellar, I will most certainly be grabbing more to lay down and have on hand when a Gueuze strikes my mood."
"Overall, its a decent beer but slightly disappointing. Definitely a good entrance beer for those interested in lambics or gueuze, but not worth the $6/bottle that it costs in Ontario. I had 2 bottles and am not running out to buy more. Will age the 2nd bottle to see if any of the funky smell dissipates."
"Pale orange in colour, cloudy, with a fizzy white head that quickly dies down to a persistent cap. No lace. There is a barnyard character to the aroma, like stale manure and dry hay, and a nice green apple scent as well. Even stranger, there is a distinct note of tire rubber as well. Strangest of all, this aroma is actually kind of pleasant once you adjust to it. Lemony and tart, the sourness reminds me of that in plain yogourt but much, much stronger. Finishes dry with apple skin and faint wood notes. Light-bodied and effervescent, champagne-like texture. Nice feel. A wonderful drink."
"this is for the adventurous drinker."
"Pours a pale orange colour with large head. Some nice lacing on the glass. Smells fairly tart, with a hint of wheat. Some vinegar type aroma as well. Flavour has a mild sourness to it, quite nice. Very smooth carbonation level. I'm glad this came to Ontario, I plan to pick up several bottles."
"Overall - I liked this the first time I had it. It was the first gueuze I ever had. I now realize how mediocre this is in comparison to some of the greats. It's still drinkable and even enjoyable, but not what I'd call a good example."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer, and not surprised despite the name as I’ve heard many good things. A nice and readily available beer for the style, worth a shot."
"A truely enjoyable Gueuze that is widely available."
"O/D - this is my first gueuze review (& I've only had a couple of them before), & I'd have to say it's drinkable, but you have to like sours. Lots of people say that this is a good intro to sours. I might recommend something else, I guess it depends on what you typically like. Maybe this one if you're a Saison fan. But overall, it's a bit too sour to be too drinkable...one is enough."
"Pours a cloudy, pale orange color; active carbonation but thin, white, fizzy head that dissipates to a thin haze. The aroma is malty with sourish fruit notes: citrus and lemon peel along with spicy peppercorn and coriander. Ample Brett aroma. Flavor is rather sour and tart; definitely funky but the Brett does not overpower the taste, as the fruit and spice notes come through also. It becomes sweeter as the palate adjusts. The mouthfeel is thin but crisp from the carbonation."
"D: This was a nice gueuze! Surprisingly clean and crisp with more funk than other sours I've tried recently. The tartness was bold but not over powering. The body was fitting and helped drinkability, although it would still be tough to finish more than 6 or 8 ounces of this in a sitting. Age as long as you want, I'm sure it'll be fine for many years. Recommended."
"O: Lindeman's Gueuze Cuvee Rene is the perfect entry-level Gueuze. It's approachable for the novice, yet worth returning to time and again for the ol' pro. This may not be the top Gueuze I've had, but it's consistantly one of the best."
"This is pretty much the standard I judge all others in this style by. Acidic and tart...puckering...tasty!"
"Future outlook: A beer that delivers what I'd expect and hope for it to deliver. Not something that I'll drink frequently, but definitely something I'll consider picking up just to have around."
"O: Good gueuze. Too bad many people avoid it just because it's from Lindemans. It'd be interesting to see how much funk develops in this if it were laid down for a few years."
"overall, this is one hell of a change of pace, it retains a very refreshing quality while having an extreme amount of flavor. also it is quite drinkable, as it is fairly low gravity and has some really neat carbonation."
"O: good first in style for me, and makes me want to try more."
"Overall this is a very tight, focused beer that is all that I expected."
"O: A great gueuze by Lindemans, definitely on the sour side if you like your gueuze like that. Good for the summer time, as it’s fairly low in abv and hits the spot on a hot day"
"Carefully decanted, appears bright golden orange with a monstrous fluffy off-white head. Plenty of visibly active carbonation in the beer and some splotches of lacing. Smells tart, funky, plenty of must. A powerful lemony aroma came out when I first opened the bottle but now it's nowhere to be found. That lemon definitely shows up in the taste, acidic but not sour. The flavors intensify as it continues to warm. Light bodied with carbonation that is a bit prickly, and a dry/puckering finish."
"O: Good but not tart or sour enough to my liking. This is my first Gueuze so I am not sure if they are regularly more tart/sour or not. Overall a very nice beer and I'm glad I got to try this. I think I would pick this up again once or twice a year."
"One of the very best of the Lindemans group."
"A good beer. Has that pure, farmhouse style flavor. Complex, yet approachable for newbies to the world of sours. Low alcohol makes it quite sessionable."
"O - Seriously one of the best beers I've had in awhile and it's a bit disappointing that this is the only readily-available gueuze in my area because I may have a new favorite style."
"D ~ I love Sours. I'll buy this again and again."
"D- A fairly drinkable if not tame example of the style."
"Overall: Pretty good, but incredibly strange and foreign to me. I will try more sours, as they are interesting, but I will take my time with them. I will probably eventually revisit this when I get more experience with sours."
"O - Very good gueuze considering its price and availability. Will be picking up a few more to cellar."
"overall much better then i was expecting"
"O/D - Not a bad Gueuze but not a great one. Seems run of the mill. Worth a try though. Nothing really jumps out about it."
"This Gueuze pours out as a really nice bright golden yellow with a pretty nice looking head to which was interesting. The smell was not as acidic as most beer of this style out there but it gave me some reassurance that this brew would be drinkable. The acidic smell was balanced with a sweetness on the nose. The taste was also balanced in the same manner. I really was surprised on how drinkable this was for me. Most of the time a Gueuze is just too much for me."
"On the whole, not bad. However, the prominence of fruit throughout the flavor profile is a bit cutesy in my book. I like it more the warmer it gets."
"love the beer i drank a case in a couple days oops its amazing beer i'm a chef and we use this to make an aolio sauce which makes for a taste dipper for frites or put on a sandwich top knock brewer looking forward to my next case its flavors are some of the best from them ands its tartness is perfect 5.0 for me"
"O- Overall quite a bit more sour than I was expecting but pretty good!"
"Such a great beer for the price. With the right pouring technique, this pours almost bright into my Duvel glass. Notes of bretty barnyard and lactic sourness fill the headspace in the glass. The taste is similar, incredibly drinkable. Not much foam of lacing. High carbonation."
"O: This is an eye opener for me. It's pretty cool what you can do with water, barley, hops, and yeast. This thing is like those sour patch kids without the sweet finish. It's really exceptional."
"O: a great sour beer. Great intro starter as well."
"I really liked this one. Could easily enjoy more sourness, but for the style I think this was right on. Great sipper."
"Taste is drysih but not too dry, with nice Gueuze rutic character overall – lemon and spicy herb, light soured pear, hint of sweetness, yeasty character, wet hay, hint of leafiness, and excellent interplay of the elements. It’s lively and engaging and overall wonderful."
"O - A great intro to the style, this is a good beer to use to introduce folks to the world of sour beer. It's not on the level of the RR sours I have had, but it is delicious and refreshing. Notably less complex than those RR beers."
"Lindemans Gueuze Cuvee Rene is a beer that is deserving of the reputation it has. Despite the offerings from Lindemans that are lacking in complexity, back-sweetened artificially, and fruit-candy flavored, this is an OG MF'ing gueuze. The beer pours a very hazy pale amber like apple juice topped with just a wispy trace of white foam. The beer is muted in aroma, even after being warmed. the aroma is kind of like moldy lemon that rolled around in damp hay. The beer definitely has the puckering lemon taste with hints of must and a little metallic bitterness. This is not the most complex gueuze, but the sourness is pleasing and refreshing. Overall, for the price this is a great beer choice. Although I expect more from the best producers, this is a fine selection."
"Pours a dark orange with a fizzy white heat. Aroma of grapes, apple, pears and yeast. Flavor begins with some sweet apple cider notes and pears. Sweetness gives way to tart white grape notes. Good counter to the sweetness. A bit of yeast and more sweetness kick back in on the very dry and light finish. Very fizzy, crisp and light."
"This is a decent gueuze, but I'm not expert. Its easy to acquire and affordable. However, I'm certain there are better examples out there, in fact, I believe I've had better."
"O- A really nice gueuze, a good intro to gueuze or lambics in general before trying out some of the fruited or pricier ones, for just ~$11 it's a good value as well."
"O: Wow. Sweet tarts for grown ups. I think this one might take me from ""sours as a novelty"" to ""sours as a style I really like."""
"Poured from a corked 25 oz bottle into my Duvel tulip. Hazy light orangey color with a finger of big bubbled head. The head fades pretty quickly but leaves a decent film that clings to the glass after each drink. The smell has so much going on. A light skunk comes through first, a buggy funk, much like a sour pilsner. Flavor wise has a light up front sour which builds, more funky bugs, and the finish reminds me of Brie mold. Amazingly complex. Nice soft bubbly texture. Finishes very dry and sour. My first Gueuze. I want more!"
"Overall: I hate the 750ml format for sours because a lot of the time I drink them by myself. 750ml is a bit much but that is due to the style, not the taste. Very affordable at about $8. Would revisit and certainly introduce someone to sours with it."
"O - Here's where I a bit of a problem...although the beer looked good and left my mouth puckering and dry...I don't think I could drink more than one of these...actually half of this was pretty good...we figured it would be a lot better to drink this with food instead of by itself...but please, don't get me wrong...this is an excellent beer and this was my first experience with the style"
"O- I've had Rodenbach before, and liked it a lot. This, not as much. Maybe it's one of those acquired tastes, but I really don't get this beer. I will try again though- not giving up that easily."
"Don't really get a ton of fruit feel from this gueuze, rather dry, again, apple/lemon. Slight white wine and light oak feel along with it. Slightly complex, a good start for style, champagne like at times. Worth getting everytime at $6, not too many examples in this price range that are quality (le terroir I guess)."
"O: very sweet beer considering the price. A must buy for any gueuze noobs."
"Overall a tasty gueuze and a good example of the style."
"Overall: Too much sour and bitter lemon flavor and not enough else going on. (Relatively) cheap and accessible if you're in a pinch, but there are better ones out there. Maybe some age would help. Damn good compared to other Lindemans."
"-Cheers"
"Would certainly buy again, and would like to get a few bottles to age and let develop a little more."
"This is a very approachable gueuze, and not in the sugary mainstream sense. It's a well-crafted, well-balanced example of the style."
"Mine pours an opaque, pale gold with a one finger head that dies away quickly, whereas the pour I did for the lady had a much bigger head and good retention. On the nose there seems to be lemon, dry straw, something everyone seems to call funk, and maybe some cyprian latakia. In the mouth, the tartness attacks the very tip of the tongue upon touching it, a strange sensation for me. There are green apples and sour lemons, and the straw seems to disappear a little bit on the tongue. The tartness seemed to hang on forever even though the brew goes down very quickly. It's a super dry, champagne type finish, slightly acidic, with some bread starting to peek out just at the very end. There is an awful lot going on in this brew. This isn't something I could drink every day, but once in a while this would hit the spot for sure. Totally unlike most beers I seem to like, and I'll be looking into more sours because of this."
"MF/O: Delicate body, spritzy carbonation. Puckering finish but not really sour, I found it to be a little one dimensional"
"o- an excellent beer, though I can't see drinking more than a half-beer's worth at a time"
"O- a good geuze. definitely the only beer of lineman's i'd get down on. for the price and availability, you can't really do better in this style. i just wish it were a bit more funky - super refreshing though."
"This, I believe, was the first Gueuze I ever tasted, when I discovered the style, and I'm happy to be enjoying it again now, for the second or third time."
"This beer is amazing, a really really amazing beer, probably one of the best beer I've had in a really long time. Smell is some what sour, taste is little citrusy but also a bitter in the finish. It is incredibly crisp, having several characteristics similar with champagne and the finishes with flavor of a tea. Has a crisp mouthfeel this is truly the champagne of beer."
"Mouthfeel is crisp but not too watery. Really a great gueuze, and the best of its kind you'll find for its price and availability."
"Overall, this is great to sip with a light cheese or some such snack to go along. This would be great to introduce the style to newbies, as it makes for a very interesting experience and a wonderful drink."
"M/D: a good zing on the tongue from carbonation that finishes smooth. I could drink this all day if I could afford the $10.00 price tag. Otherwise an awesome beer that is happily balanced and not fruity like the other typical Lindemans offerings. Next up Faro."
"Drinkability: A very nice beer that I would be happy to drink again and again. Only my second geuze overall, but it's another winner. I would like to see what this tastes like with more age on it."
"Mouthfeel is really good, as the beer approaches watery without ever getting there. This is how a refreshing beer should be weighted. Carbonation is healthy but not combative to the palate. Contrast of textures from chalky to smooth and crisp is effective. Drinkability is good as a result, and the dry finish helps a lot too. Sourness is not as strong as it should be however, as I'd want it to wipe clean the palate at every sip."
"Overall a really excellent beer. It's much better than those other Lindemans products that seem overly sweet."
"Drink- Funky, tangy, tasty and very crisp. A very good drinkable beer. If this is in the top 15, I want/need to taste top 5."
"Drinkability - Only poured about 4 ounces. Don't really even want to finish it. I'm not sure if this is just the style of the beer, or if I got a bad bottle. I'll be sure to re-rate this when I get more knowledge on this style. (edit) after reading some of the other reviews, I'm comfortable that this was not a bad bottle. I am now able to enjoy this more now that I know this is what it's supposed to taste like."
"D: The complexity of the flavor keep me coming back to this one, and the low alcohol means I could have a few glasses of it. Definitely enjoyable, and a highly recommended first gueuze (as it was for me). Good price point too."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Slightly watery. A good balance of sourness. Quite fruity. Easily drinkable and light bodied."
"Outstanding."
"D - I let my girlfriend take a sip of this and she told me ""it tastes like a crybaby in liquid form"". I enjoyed that quote. Drinkability is just average to me, but even though slow when my mouth is away from it for too long it starts to water for another sip. Ok, so i'll knock it up .5! Pretty good starter gueuze."
"Overall- Does not have quite the depth, complexity, and funk as some of the top notch guezes, but this a solid offering. It is a very refreshing drink. The lower price point keeps it more in the rotation, with cantillon/3F being more of the limited treats."
"D - Light and refreshing, just be ready for the sour. If this is a beginner sour then I am slightly hesitant to try more, but I definitely will! I find it very interesting that sours are becoming the new big thing, I guess it's because people have to work a bit to enjoy them."
"D: I can see why people push this as a ""beginner"" sour. Not too intense but very enjoyable overall. Nothing to complain about here but nothing that really stands out to make this one unforgettable. Still, a very good beer and one I wouldn't hesitate to revisit."
"D - Really tasty, readily available sour, good to know and great to drink."
"D: If Lindemans was a recording artist, Framboise would be its self-consciously accessible and commercial recording and Cuvee Rene would be its dense experimental work. Having the two so close together was really quite jarring. This is a fine example of the style, but I think I'd enjoy it more in the summertime."
"Aroma is similar to a dry white wine, not really champagne like, more stinky... more Pinot Grigio. This has a musty taste, not too musty mind you. It is also sour, not too sour mind you. Basically this has all the refreshing light pleasantries of a traditional Gueuze without too much funk, without too much horse. Take from that what you will, I prefer a little bit harder a lambic, but this is tasty. I like that this has become more available in my area."
"Pours a honey like yellow color with a big pillowy head which recedes to a skim. There are hints of soapy lace on the glass but not much. The aroma is of green apples and pears, a tart smell almost a champagne like smell. The taste is much of the same green fruits are prevalent with a champagne like taste, no hops but a nice even tart green fruit taste. The mouthfeel is dry with a nice carbonation profile. The drinkability is good, its an easy drink without and thing to detract for the drinkability. An nice well rounded flavor."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. restrained but complex sourness. good depth. a tasty sour."
"This was a nice change of pace for Lindemans, but I think I'll leave my gueuze money in the hands of the time-worn experts."
"(375ml bottle). Pours yellow-orange color with dissipating white head. small sediment in suspension. Aroma of funk, grapes and some wood. Taste is sour, but some sweetness balances the beer. Thin to medium bodied with oily texture. Smooth finish. A nice beer"
"Pours a straw color with a nice white head. Scent is ver funky with a bit of leather. I love this scent...Great taste...Funkiness with some cheese flavors and more leather. Lots of lemon with more funky cheese and grassy flavors. Mouthfeel is very puckering and crisp. Drinkability is high. My favorite from Lindemans BY FAR!"
"I may have overdone this ale in the near past, but its a flavor and aroma I can picture and crave."
"Notes: Didn't blow my mind, but it is definitely a very good example of a Gueuze."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with an amazing head. Head has awesome retention. No lacing. Smells fruity and a bit spicy. Taste super sour. Picking sour pear, sour apple and maybe some cherries. Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation. Feels very clean. Drinkability is ok. Being my first gueuze I didnt know what to make of it. Its a pretty simple straight foward beer. It was good but I wouldnt pay 8 dollars for this again."
"Golden straw yellow in color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. Tart funky aroma with some sweetness behind the must. Tartness rolls around the tongue to the back of the mouth while the chalky, acidic cider flavors swell. Champagne-like mouthfeel from the carbonation. The beer is growing on me as I continue to sip."
"Lighter body, with a good carbonation feel. Tartness is refreshing. Alcohol is a non-factor here. Very refreshing, a great change of pace."
"Overall, a decent rep of the style, although thee are others that have more complexities. I got 12 oz. bottle, and that was enough. $8? Worth a try."
"D: A robust champagne-esque body and dry finish contributed very well to a pairing with Italian antipasta and bruschetta."
"D: I was expecting the beer to be a bit more sour and it was slightly thicker than I expected. I will definitely be trying more sours, even though I did not exactly fall in love with this beer. Even though I didn't fall in love with it, I did find the beer to be pretty enjoyable."
"Very nice, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: extremely light and refreshing. While it is diametrically opposed to the stouts I usually like, I am very interested to see how this changes through the years. Must get some for the cellar."
"the appearance is light orange, straw yellow color. smells sour and like grapes. taste is tart and sweet...tastes like grapes and sour fruit... . the carbonation is lively and it cuts across your tongue. pretty thin body, appropriate for the style. pretty high drinkability, i like the beer. good stuff."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is non-existent. I'm hoping that with a few more sours under my belt these will go down easier, but at the moment its a total sipper. Potential though!"
"Light in texture and full of spritzy carbonation, Cuvee Rene is a solid representation of geuze. However, the tannic notes are a bit overpowering and push some of the more delicate flavors out. Additionally, the finish isn't as bone-dry as I prefer. Overall, a solid beer, and I could finish a full 750 myself. Affordable, so I imagine that I will be revisiting it soon, but it isn't my favorite. Under normal circumstances, I would call the experiment finished and move on to stronger representations, but the price point of this beer is spot on for a lambic lover on a budget."
"I will definitely seek this one out again and will probably keep several of these for toasts."
"D- Easy to drink and very enjoyable, if you know what you are getting into drinking a Gueuze. Having one bottle was enough for me. Just a solid sour funky beer."
"I'm just starting to get into sours (no thanks to living in Texas) and I'm glad that this one is always available in my local grocery store. Definitely a good beer and I'll br having this again."
"Ive had a few of these in the past, and will continue to grab a couple bottles when available. A very affordable example of the style."
"Drinkability: This is a great example of the style. Unique and delicious, the Cuvee Rene is a nice change of pace beer, and one worth revisiting."
"D-One of the most accessible gueuzes I've had. A less extreme version of the style that doesn't sacrifice quality."
"Notes: Perhaps this is the best beer I have had from Lindemans. Light bodied, crisp and dry, this is a great sipper. I'm glad I snapped up the last bottle in the store."
"I'd like to age this, good potential; I think it's too young."
"Personally, this one is night really for me. I can however appreciate what is going on here, but maybe, just maybe gueuze just isn't for me. It appears to be well crafted and right on for the style, but the extreme bitterness and tartness with a lack of sweetness doesn't do a whole lot for me."
"Pours a deep amberish gold hazed with tons of wheat with a thick bubbly white head and tons of lacing. Smells of ester, musk, and tartness. Tastes of sour apple with a mild funk flavor with heavy wheat flavor. Tons of awesome sourness. Mouthfeel is very nice with tons of carbonation. Drinkability is almost unmatched. I could drink tons of them."
"Medium light body with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Usually after one of these I want another right away."
"drinkability: taste isn't overly complex, fairly drinkable but i wouldn't have too many"
"appearance is quite perfect really. holding the glass up to the light yields a nice thick golden hue that i wish i saw more frequently. fairly long lasting head thats glides nicely down the side of the glass every time i take a sip. it smells lightly funky but not overwhelming by any means. little bit of granny smith apple that comes through quite a bit more in the taste. its fiarly sour and i enjoy the balance. this being said i think its a good jumping off point for those new to the style. its definitely drinkable in that sense and makes a nice treat to share with my girl as a treat after dinner tonite... yum!"
"D: As mentioned earlier, a good starter gueuze, I think, but having had both NG's R&D Gueuze and some Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze in the last month or so...this is only on par with the NG. I like it, but I like most sours."
"I have realized that I may not be ready to delve into the world of sours. Not really my cup of beer."
"light on the booze and a solid taste makes for an enjoyable beer. Nice price on it as well."
"***This was an old review, I've had this beer many times since then, freesher vintages and older ones. The fresher ones are more full in the mouth and have a bit of peach sweetness, while the older ones have more of a well-aged citrus quality that I enjoy. The quality of the older bottles vary. It's a really nice geueze, a tremendous value."
"CHEERS!!"
"Overall, a decent gueuze, especially at the price. It is pretty funky, however. I dig it. Above average."
"Dark and murky brown-yellow, kind of like three day old piss. Some sediment and a white head. Leaves ok lacing. This beer smells very sour and raw, with a fermented fruit bluntness. The taste is very tart and sour, reminds me of sour apples with a slightly bitter and salty finish. In the mouth it feels pretty average but an added tart stickness makes it special. This reminds me of a Berliner Weisse without the woodruff or raspberry. It's refreshing and interesting but not really the style for me. Nevertheless, I'm glad I tried it and would try again, just not crazy about it."
"Drinkability: This seems very accessible and easy drinking as long as the qualities of a Gueuze suit your palate. I enjoyed this one."
"pours a slight hazed apricot color with a 1 finger head that dissipates quickly to a fresh white collar,,smell is lemon tart mixed with barnyard funk wet grass and apples..taste is lemon drop with a wet hay barnyard taste its has funky earthy musty taste that offset the initial tartness ..mouth feel is crisp and dry more tart than sour just a hint of vinegar..overall a tasty gueuze that got more complex in flavors as it warmed..a pleasure to drink"
"Overall, this beer is one of the classic examples of its style and a great intro to sours. By the very definition of its style, I hardly consider sours to be highly drinkable, but this light and dry character of this beer really gives it a boost in terms of drinkability."
"Drinkability: What a great beer - I really regret waiting as long to try it as I have, but I feel that I really had to develop my palate far enough to actually appreciate a beer of this level of craftsmanship. The ABV is definitely moderate, and the body isn't heavy -- the only aspect that would probably slow me down is the acidity as I could see it causing some heartburn it too much was consumed; definitely easy enough to sip through the 355 mL bottle."
"It's difficult to review a gueuze, because I think I've really enjoyed all of the ones I've tried, and I don't get to drink them very often(price/availability). I'm trying to review to a C = average scale, but it's difficult considering I've only tried a handful. Short and simple: This isn't as sour/funky as others I've tried, but it still has those attributes and is pretty tasty, with much more of a wood flavor than others."
"Amazing example of the style, this was the last one on the shelves and I need to figure out how to get them to order more..."
"11 Aug 2010 printed on label, but bottling code seems to indicate 2008 bottling (?)."
"Mouthfeel: More full than I expected."
"Poured a pale straw yellow with a nice finger of head which had good retention and left bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was quite pleasent consisting of citric acidic lemons, funky oak barrel notes, cork, slight brett, and some faint tart vinous notes as well. Upfront the taste was quite sour starting with the acidic citrus lemons striking first alongside funky barrel, brett, and vinous accents. It also had a touch of vinegar at the tail end. The brew was medium body with a good amount of carbonation which had a slight ssweet but sour and dry finish. It drank really good and a 375ml bottle was good enough for me plus I could feel the heart burn kicking in."
"Poured a clear. light amber color with white foam that settled. Good bubbles in the glass. The smell was mildly and softly acidic with a touch of horse blanket wildness. The taste was acidity but softly so with mild fruitiness (green apples) beneath. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly tart with medium-light body and good carbonation. Fruity and wild flavors linger. A good drink, not too sharp."
"For some reason, I have a hang-up about lindeman's beers, but this one was actually quite delicious. Hazy burnt gold with a lively white head that looks nice but fades pretty quickly and doesn't leave much lace. This is a geuze though, so it is good for the style. Nose is nice and elegant and trademark lindeman's, which is good, but I'm sorry to say the whole thing seems a little safe and doesn't seem to speak volumes of the place it was made or the person it was made by. Very floral and the oak is a new oak smell, like fresh, french oak. Tart lemon and apple that seems red in the nose and green in the taste. Also a touch of earth and mushroom and must. It touches on everything that is good and proper for the style and comes off dry and refreshing with a little pucker. One of the more affordable and obtainable guezes out there. I will definitely be putting a few of these away and forgetting about them to see how they morph. Great sour jones fix without breaking the bank."
"D- The sour's not overwhelming, love it!"
"The Lindemans Gueze pours a honey golden color in the glass with a bright white froth, great retention (froth holds around rim of glass), & nice lacing! For the style, I'm very impressed with the head retention on this beer. The nose is absolutely amazing with a lemon freshness, subtle biscuit yeastiness (like a well made champagne), gala apples, & a powerful, yet elegant floral-like funkiness that all great lambics should have! On the palate, the beer is tart & smooth with balanced acidity & fantastically crisp, yet creamy mouth-feel. Overall, this is an absolutely amazing beer that I'm enjoying throughly! It might even be the highest rated beer I've ever scored! Needless to say, I Highly Recommend this beer!"
"Hands down a great beer, haven't tried it on tap yet but I'm sure it's great. This beer really makes me appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into this beer. One could look at the label and see from the bottling date that this beer has been aging for some time before it got to you. Try at least once."
"Drinkability is uphill then down. Initially, you're like damn, this is noms, then as the stripped buds start to say uncle the flavors don't come across as strong. Fortunately by that time your at the bottom of your glass."
"Cheers!"
"Bought this to introduce a buddy to the style and was completely disappointed. A complete insult to the style. Suppose I should have know better coming from Lindeman's, but some of the other reviews made me optimistic. Will never buy again."
"A delicious gueuze from Lindemans here, which is ideal for someone newer to the style (such as myself). The dry and tart components make for some interesting drinking that I'll definitely be coming back for."
"D: I wish that I could say that I was a fan of sours, but I find them a little off-putting. this seems like a fine example of the style though."
"A great beer, I'll definitely be seeking out more lambics in the future."
"Pale gold color, very hazy, thousands of tiny bubbles rising from the depths to form a small white head. Its very sour on the nose, kind of earthy and barny. Starts the mouth a' waterin'. Great tasting brew, very sour and tart on the tongue. Lots lof lemon tones, big yeast profile. Different spices, pepper, then some fruit notes. Very active on the tongue, thin bodied. Good brew"
"D. Very drinkable. It is light and the taste is not too overpowering. I wish I could try more Gueuze's to compare this too, but sadly the only Gueuze available in Texas."
"This is a fun beer to drink and quite enjoyable. The sourness is more pronounced as it warms."
"A classic gueuze, which can act as a model for the style but doesn't go so far as to completely wow you in any respect."
"Drinkability - This beer has a lot going on so I am drinking it nice and slow and enjoying each sip. The sourness really adds a great character to the wild nature of the beer. Definitely something everyone should try at some point, although it's not for everyone. I would definitely be interested in having another bottle after this one, although I think I would rather only have one at a time in order to full appreciate it. One wild beer!"
"Carbonation seems low, especially given the style."
"Drinkability is very good."
"Overall I like this beer alot. It's not offensive in any way and is very tasty. A good straight forward gueuze."
"D - I was hoping, from all I heard, that this beer would be a great way to kick off my next 1,000 reviews, but alas, it;s actually rather bland besides the sourness. I'm not sold on the idea that this beer is really light-struck although the information points to that. I'm definitely up for a second try though."
"DB- Lots of good flavors going on here. Balanced out well and a nice level of sour. Great price for this 750ml bottle."
"I thought this was more sour than Cantillon gueuze, at least as good as that if not better. Definitely one to split with friends."
"I'll be in Belgium in the fall and am going to check out a few breweries, including Cantillon, so maybe I'll have a renewed appreciation for lambics when I get back..."
"D - An excellent Gueuze offering... Nothing spectacular, but nothing detracting either... Just a smooth easy drinker with an excellent appearance and mouthfeel..."
"The first sip is tart, sharp and acidic, almost like biting into a lemon. There is just enough sweet here to balance into a very refreshing experience, however. It is an exuberant expression balanced by some earthy notes. The body is light, but the carbonation makes it feel twice its size."
"Overall, an excellent brew. My second foray into lambics, the Lindeman's Kriek being my first. I like this style a lot, and could definitely drink this again."
"A really wonderful ale. Poured from the bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours golden-orange, hazed, lots of fluffy white head. A good bit of funk and fruity character in the aroma. Pretty tart (sour!) and funky, with citrus-like acidic quality. Really good stuff, I love it. Really makes you pucker up. I'd get this one again without a doubt."
"Pours a nice murky deep yelow. Aroma is citrusy and flavor is similar but with distinct lemon tartness. Very well carbonated and lively as you sip this is a very nice sour and a good representative of the style. I'm not a huge sour fan. But this is one I would drink again."
"D - One bottle was enough for me in a sitting, and it lacked something for me. Will try others of the style."
"A great geuze, pairs nicely with a good farmhouse cheese."
"This is hands down the best beer I've tried from Lindemans. And I'm kind of a fan of their other beers anyway, even if they are just lambic and fruit juice rather than actual fruit fermentation."
"D - Very drinkable, though not diverse enough to capture my palate's attention for a second bottle"
"It's definitely an interesting beer, and perhaps a good introduction to the world of sours, as it's not a vinegary as some. Caught me off guard at the beginning, but I began to really enjoy it as I went on."
"The mouthfeel is light as it is fairly carbonated."
"D: A really well balanced effort. Easy drinking and quite accessible. Nice when looking for a less intense gueuze."
"D-this is well balanced and easy to drink, it has a good balance between funk, sweet, and sourness. very solid beer and great on the palate."
"D: Not overly sour and fairly refreshing. Probably wouldn't drink it again as there are other gueuzes I enjoy more, but definitely a good beer."
"Overall, a nice take on this style. Balanced with good sours notes. Nothing too complex but definitely something worth trying."
"Taste very similar to aroma. More brett flavor than I had expected from Lindemans, and a solid overall Lambic taste. Citrus and lemon are the most pronounced flavors. Not quite as dry as other lambics, but also not quite as carbonated. My bottle may have been a one off, as it was relatively lowly carbonated and I see others have said their pours had a large head."
"Not infinitely complex nor is it one dimensional. Very good value and a good place to start when you want to ease your way into the style."
"D-The musty character is hard to get by at first. The thin watery mouthfeel is also something I'm not really a fan of, but I would be willing to give Gueze another shot."
"Overall, my first gueuze has me wanting to try lots more of them. I can tell where a lot of my time (and money) will be going in the near future."
"Overall a nice little beer that I'm proud to have plenty of access to. It seems like it may be a little to fresh right now, I'm sure with some age this could be an outstanding beer."
"Picked up a bottle from Abe's for $10.50 and split it with friends. This isn't a big ripping gueze like some of the legends. Rather, this is a touch more balanced and approachable. While the aroma has a mix of spice and farmhouse funk, the aroma is gentler with sour, tangy lime and a hint of sugar. Worth a try or a decent introduction to the style."
"I can see why so many people suggest this as an intro to gueuze. It's a masterfully crafted beer, with excellent balance and distinct, delicious flavors."
"M/D: Smooth and crisp. This is my first gueuze, and I have to say I like it. It is very complex, for me anyway. I keep tasting, trying to slowly piece it together. I can tell why people say this is the next style up from ipa/dipa, complex and intriguing."
"The brew pours a cloudy golden hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a very frothy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is aromas of mould,dust,wet socks,fresh green apples and freshly cut green grass,it has a pretty light mouthfeel that is made for more than one of and has tastes of green apples,green grapes,kiwi fruit and finishes very sour and tart,overall this would be a great brew to drink on a hot summers day and even though on first taste its quite sour and mouthpuckering it does get better and easier to drink just couldnt drink it all the time,very intesting and different though."
"Dry beers tend to give me heartburn, so I would rule this out would when it came to regular drinking. However if I found a way to get around this peculiar genetic oddity I would like to think I could drink this beer on a regular basis. Today is a hot and muggy day, and I can think of no better beer than a low alcohol, light and dry Belgian ale for a day like today."
"i would venture to say that it takes a very sophisticated palate to enjoy this beer."
"Pours a medium gold with a pretty standard head that leaves ok lacing. The aroma is pretty strait up sour with just a touch of lactic musty basment aroma. The flavor is quite similar. Very sour with less lactic than in the nose. There is also a fairly non-descript sweet malt presence that plays well off of all that sour. This beer really reminds me of a dry white wine more than any beer I have had so far. There also seem to be some faint spice and citric acid notes. Mouthfeel is light and dry with just the right amount of carbonation. A great refreshing beer for this 90 degree day of homebrewing"
"This is an excellent gueuze. If you factor in cost and availability, its an amazing example. I would recommend it to anyone wondering what this whole gueuze thing is about. Its not the best I've had but its really really fine. I would recommend it, I would buy it again, and I would drink it again for sure."
"My first Gueuze. Initially impressed, but the sourness got to be a little tiring towards the end. Overall enjoyed it, but an acquired taste I suppose."
"Lindemans makes good stuff, and Cuvée René is just another reason why. And as a bonus, this gueuze is ""affordable""."
"My initial impressions of this beer were actually not very good. It was so strange and mildly unpleasant at first. However, when I finished the first glass, my mouth watered for a second and since it was out of a lambic glass, a third and fourth. Definitely a beer to be experienced though you may not like it!"
"Overall: The body of the beer is light with a full blown sour finish. This is one of the most memorable time drinking a beer. I was totally taken off guard by the way this beer presented itself on my palate. I will seek this beer out again and age it for several years and see how it plays out in the future."
"Pretty nice stuff, no screwing around here. It wouldn't call it bone dry like a Cantillon, but it certainly aint sweet. Definitely one of the smoother ""real"" lambics I have come across."
"D- I could put down pint after pint of this good brew. Haven't found nearby but ill try."
"Very nice easy drinking sour. And my first gueuze. I dig it, and will enjoy sipping the rest of the bottle."
"A sour odor and tart, like a cellar that will make you think up the sheet of glass above and a mouth tart winey acid on the tongue and in enduring aftertaste. The taste of pure lambic explodes in the mouth of a powerful acid. One senses, slightly behind, touches of white pepper and a final rhubarb still green. A lambic couples perfectly mastered that combines tradition and taste."
"Drinkability is nice a definate must have for someone looking to get into this style."
"D: It's strikingly drinkable for a gueuze and isn't overly sour, however this is probably a beer you want to sip."
"D - A gueuze is to be savored. I liken the drinking experience to be like a high abv stout. You do not slam this one, it is a sipper. I rated the drink-ability based on the style not against other beers."
"D: Highly drinkable, but the tartness limits how rapidly you can do so. A very enjoyable brew and certainly the best I've had from Lindemans. Would pair well with food."
"Mouthfeel is puckery and light in nature. Carbonation is high and felt and just right. Spritzy with a dry finish. This is a tasty treat and one I really should go for more often. With the availability and price point, you can't go wrong if your into sour beer. My favorite out of the liefman's products without all the extra sweetness."
"D- the best brew from them by far. The aggressive flavor and low abv makes for a great second but its bugs are tuff. Worked well with the eggs to cut through the hollandais it was amazing. Do it."
"D - Good drink-ability, not something I would have several of in a night but a great beer to have one or two of in an evening."
"beverage that can help clear the digestion after a super heavy meal."
"D- easily my new favorite lambic. I need to go buy more of this."
"Overall, I am a huge fan of this beer. Goes great with the spicy thai noodles that I paired it with. We had trouble narrowing down notes on the taste, and it was mentioned that this beer is more about the mouthfeel and ""what it does to you"" more than how it tastes."
"D - Low in alcohol, high in fruitiness, sour/tartness, funk - all nicely balanced together. Another example of a fine gueuze, and one that is affordable and readily available. I am reminded again by this one - why seek out the rare, high priced American wilds (many of them are extremely good, don't get me wrong - I've sampled a number of them) when I can go down to the local store, spend less than $10 for a bottle of this and get a beer that is pretty much equivalent - maybe better."
"Nice offering here from Lindemans, would think this would be a great entry level Gueuze for some..."
"I can think of no better gueuze to serve as an introduction to the style. Its tasty, not intimidating, and hints at what the style can do."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of earthy resin, tart malt, yeast, dry hops, and slight grape. Fits the style of a Gueuze. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with a high carbonation level. There is also a tartness and dryness present. Tastes of yeast, tart malt, dry hop, slight grape, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a tart and dry beer that fits the style quite nicely."
"MMM...very tasty and enjoyable. Extremely funky...fizzy/carbonated, tart. Again, not boozy at all. Very crisp, smooth, and light body. I'm not picking up much of a fruit taste at all...if I was too stretch it, I'd say lemon. But that's probably due to the tartness. Best Lindemans beer by far...to date! Way to go Lindemans!"
"Extremely refreshing, and probably more drinkable for its seeming lack of acidity. It gets a little caustic after a while, but you can't beat a beer like this on a hot afternoon. Would have to be one of the cleanest and most refreshing beers I've ever had. Certainly worthy as an occasional treat."
"Sante!"
"Fruity on the palate, showing pear and lemon. Sweet on the whole, finishing with a bit of sugar. Mouthwatering and still funky. Light to medium in body, and somewhat cloying. Sweeter than I'd prefer, but seems like it'd make a good introduction to gueuzes."
"Pungent sour apple aroma. Pours cloudy and golden with a large, fine head that dissipates very quickly with no lacing at ll. Taste is sour and funky but still somehow pleasant in that makes your cheeks hurt kind of way. Thin and fizzy on the palate; champagne like with a dry, sour finish. It's actually pretty good but I suspect one or two a year would be plenty."
"D - Easy to drink but the sour flaovrs make you want to take your time. I don't think I could drink more than one of these at once but I wouldn't mind having another one in the future!"
"Drinkability - Definitely a sipper. I only got a 375ml and I think that should be enough for me. There is a bit of an acidic bite to this and I have a feeling this may affect me later on. But I must say this is a refreshing beer that has great flavor and sure wakes you up with its sour/tartness. I would have this again in the future."
"Overall - I've had this beer quite a few times but haven't gotten around to reviewing it. A great gueuze, and a STEAL at $10/bottle. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: My favorite of all of the Lindemans that I've had. Very taste gueuze that doesn't have the artificial syrupy taste of the others. Overall a decent sour beer for about $6 that I will definitely have again."
"D – Very likable beer, in general. It is not exceptional within its stylistic realm, but it is very solid and certainly quite exotic to the uninitiated. But for me, I would always take Oude Gueuze, Girardin, or Boon over this."
"For its particular frontal assault on the tongue, this is a decently sippable (somewhat), sour lambic, just a tad less egregious than the Cantillons of the world. I am slowly coming to discover that I actually kind like this sort of thing, in measured doses."
"Drinkability: quite high. I find sour beers highly refreshing, and this is no exception. Since it doesn't have the strong fruit flavoring of some lambics, it refrains from being one-dimensional as some of the more subtle flavors can come through. I quite like it."
"Light to medium body with plenty of carbonation. For me, a difficult one to drink - almost have to steel myself for the next sip."
"D - This is a very good beer. It was my first gueuze and I really liked it."
"Taste is OK, nothing I would spend much time searching for again. The mouthfeel is OK and the beer is well balanced, but the overall impression is again of artificial lime flavors."
"Pours a light hazy yellow with small white head that fades rather quickly. Looks bubbly and well-carbonated. Smell isn't exactly my style, maybe because I'm not too educated in gueuzes, but I'm not a huge fan. Some good lemon notes and grassy notes are there, but (is there brett in here?) there are also other notes that don't appeal to me much--armpit and must. I tend to prefer the funky flavor/aroma to the sweaty one. Taste however is pretty good. This one is puckeringly tart with some crisp lemon zest flavor. It really slaps you in the face. There's a bit of pale malt behind it too. I feel like I'm more of a fan of the sour/vinegar side of the spectrum rather than the tart side of the spectrum. Not bad at all, though. Light body, big carbonation, like champagne, kind of. Good drinkability, though I can't see me having more than one. Good intro to gueuzes for me."
"Overall - Its alright for what it is, but its not quite my style"
"This isn't a bad gueuze especially for the price. Nonetheless other examples such as Cantillon Classic Gueuze are more satisfying and provide a better experience."
"D-this beer very drinkable and very refreshing but being that its a gueze its has a rather acquired taste"
"From a supermarket here in Brussels, so it's on the fresh side. Poured with nice fine, foamy off white head that shortl settled down to the edges of the glass and a little lace. Color is a hazy amber. Aroma is nice and of peaches, spices, armpit sweat, musk, yeast, and champagne. Flavor's very similar but dominated by tartness. There's just the barest hint of sweetness in there somewhere. Body's ok and carbonation is almost like sparkling wine. Finish is a very early green apple. Great beer, but can't drink a lot."
"Overall, a pretty average to below average gueze. Its not complex, or overally flavorful so this might be a good one for beginners of lambics."
"Lactic acidic mouthfeel, high level of carbonation, medium to thin body. I would have loved a bit more body. This is one sour brew. I think it smelled a lot better than it tasted but it didn't taste half bad. I certainly couldn't drink to many of these, but for Lindemans this one impressed me."
"Nice looking brew, poured into a tulip glass. Nice slightly cloudy golden color with a fair sized just off white head that has good retention. I am picking up wheat malt mixed with a nice sour tart fruit like aroma, slightly funky, very inviting. The flavor is nice, thought it might be a little more sour based on the nose but the tart fell is very welcoming. Has a lemon citrus flavor that seems to mix well with the wheat flavors I pick up. Also a funky flavor is there that seem more like a farmhouse flavor which goes well with everything. The carbonation goes a long way with the feel, almost champagne like, dry finish. This is a nice brew, I like the sours but have not had many Gueuze's but will have to look for more."
"Goes down real easy if you enjoy the taste. This would actually be a very easy beer to gulp in warmer weather and could also be nursed for a long time as it doesn't wear out its welcome at all. No aftertaste to speak of save for a lingering tartness. If you like this style or Flanders styles, you will really appreciate this."
"It felt as if the beer evaporated within my mouth as I drank it and was reasonably refreshing, not drying."
"D - Nicely balanced, crisp and refreshing. While there's not as much going on as some others, this is a very drinkable geuze."
"D- Very nice drinker. Good for a intro into this whole realm of beers. I will be buying this again for when I need my sour fix and am on a budget!"
"D: For a sour beer, this is quite drinkable and quite delicious"
"Drink ability was above average. Sourness got to me about halfway through the bottle. Dont think I could drink more than one at a time."
"750 ml capped and corked bottle, best by 11 August, 2010. Served in a tulip glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch white head which went away quickly. Not very much lacing at all, but there's bits of it around the glass. Aroma is green apple, funk, vinegar and some lemon zest. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's nice and tart with some funk noticable too. It's not too strong, it has the right amount of tartness to make this brew very enjoyable. Mouthfeel/body is light and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and it's easy to finish a bomber of this. This brew reminds me that I need to buy more gueuzes, as it's a style I like but don't drink very often. It's worth buying if you see it somewhere."
"D: A quality Gueuze right here. A 180 change from their well known sweet lambics, this is traditional dry, funky lambic, well made."
"D - Nice and sour, though not as intense or funky as some brands such as Cantillon. There is a good balance of malt and acidity that helps the drinkability and lends some contrast to the funk. An enjoyable and authentic lambic that is a good bit cheaper and slightly easier to come by than most other examples of the style."
"Pours a cloudy golden color. The first smell that hits you is one of funk, with some vinegar and fruit mixed in as well. The flavor is very fruity with a good bit of funk and sour tart. This is not a beer with an extreme amount of sourness, but it has a near perfect mix of fruit, sourness and funkyness. This beer is extremely drinkable and finishes very dry. Outstanding beer."
"D- Low alcohol, easy to drink, a great ""intro"" gueuze or a great bargain for the gueuze oriented."
"Pours a cloudy golden color with a thin white cap of foam across the top that receeds to a faint white film quickly. Spotty lacing about the glass. Nose is a blend of scents that I can best relate to as being musty but also includes funk and citrus. Taste is a blend of all the aroma indicators (funk, must, citrus) but also is sour and tart with a somewhat dry finish. Has some taste characteristics that are similar to a lemonlike bite. Light bodied with a medium amount of carb."
"D: Very sour, though not to the point of being offputting, even after quite a few oz's. Not as dry/sour as other geuezes I've had."
"D- Insane. I downed this with ease. I really found this to be a stellar gueuze, and I will buy some more again."
"I bought this hoping it would be a more affordable alternative to Cantillon Iris, and I was happy to find that it is. Let's be clear, you get what you pay for with Iris and it's the superior unblended, but at just over $5 a bottle (versus $12 for Iris), the Lindeman's is kinder to the wallet."
"The aroma is dry, lemony, tart, and a relatively light level of Belgian funk. As far as gueuze goes, this has a lot of the attractive features and avoids the more complex, perhaps more esoteric and ""acquired taste"" type of barnyard funk. Tastes lemony with a tart yeasty character with a touch of grass. Nicely moderate-high sourness with a clean finish for the style. A really good tasting beer, though it lacks some of the complexity seen in other gueuzes--little funk of any kind, seems to be mostly lactic sourness. Almost like an imperial Berliner Weisse. It is tasty though, and for the price point, half to a third the price of other respectable gueuzes. Light bodied with tight, high carbonation. What it lacks in complexity, it definitely makes up for in terms of drinkability, one could probably kill a 750 alone, though it is always better to share with a friend."
"Good beer, worth trying if you like sour brews or if you are just starting to check them out."
"A nice, tart gueuze. While not quite as wonderful as some gueuze, this is still excellent beer. This is a real punch in the mouth gueuze that leaves a film of tartness on the teeth, like licking a lemon. In fact, it's a bit like mixing with lemon juice with a good, dry champagne, which sounds appealing to me, anyway. There's some dry, neutral oak in the finish and a tiny touch of horse blanket-brett flavor peeks out. Otherwise, it's mostly lemon/grapefruit rind tart. While it's not my favorite gueuze, it's still quite good and comes in at a much lower price than the competition. If only Lindemans would stop sweetening their fruit lambics (or start importing the Kriek Cuvée René)..."
"This beer is proof that Lindemans actually knows how to make a true wild beer."
"Golden straw color with haze and bubbly carbonation. Nice champagne like head. Smell is strong sour/tart lemon with funk comming through nearly as much on the back end. Taste is of sour and tart lemon zest backed with hay and funk. Strange hint of salt on the palate and champagne like taste on the palate after a few sips as my tounge gets used to it. Body is light with prickly champagne like carbonation, pretty dry finnish and suprisingly little aftertaste. Once you get past the strong sour and funk flavors, this really is impressive. Miller Highlife boasts itself as the champagne of beers, but this is much closer with the body, carbonation and taste."
"D: one of the only gueuzes that is widely available in the US. This brew is great for anybody that likes the sour side of beer."
"D - This was my first Gueuze and it most definitely won't be my last. This is like nothing I've ever tasted beore. I hope I can get my hands on a continuous supply of this stuff."
"I can hardly believe I had never tried this until last summer. Shame on me! The colour was golden with a thin head. The aroma was yeasty, spicy, doughy and biscuit-like. On the palate, there was loads of yeast as well as citrus and clove with a bitterness around the edges that had an essence of mustiness to it. I like it!"
"Some might consider it too tart for heavy consumption, but, in my humble opinion, this Gueuze is one of the finest around and I never had a second thought about polishing off the bottle as fast as possible."
"Clear, effervescent, apple cider-ish gold color with a thick, but quickly receding bubbly white head with little lacing. As soon as I pop the cork I hit by an (delicious) aroma of pungent, sour, funky aroma, citric lemon, must, dirt, etc. Everything expected from a gueze, but not quite as complex or tart as exceptional ones. First sip is extremely sour and musty, followed by citric lemon and earthy notes and as it warms up the finish is slightly sweet before the high carbonation cleanses the palate and leaves a dry, mild sour finish. Overall body is lighter side of medium with an effervescent quality. Lacking the depth of some other guezes, but an excellent example for the availability, accessibility and price."
"Overall - An outstanding gueuze - one of the best i've tried..."
"(D)- This is my first Gueuze and am loving it! The sourness packs a punch, but is an interesting and dynamic departure from the norm. Loving the lime & lemon citrus. Great stuff, but anything more than a 12oz. at at time would be too much for me."
"Finish is all green apple and grapefruit juice tones. This one is very pleasant; very consumer friendly and very drinkable."
"Overall I am in love with this style. I'm in love with this beer. I will be seeking out more of this style for sure."
"D- Excellent, plenty of tartness but still very drinkable. If I could afford it I could drink quite a few of these."
"Drinkability: High, nice for what it is. Good, available, approachable gueuze."
"This was definitely a nice introduction to the sour world for me and was quite a pleasant experience. I am now definitely interested in trying many others and slowly understanding the big desires for Cantillon, RR and the like."
"D: Sorry, but not really.. Good for the style, bad for kicking back a few with the boys."
"Overall an incredibly unique beer that I could only imagine coming out of Belgium, it has characteristics of a wheat beer and a sour but takes the fruit level to new heights and isn't too sour. Worth 5.30 for the bottle. The 5% abv and non palate ruining status of this beer makes it a king among sour session beers."
"CR pours a deep, but glowing yellow orange color with a small thin bubbled head and some visible rising carbonation. The nose is sour, no question, lemon skin, smarties candy, vinous grape juice, and hints of mild barrel. Much is the same in flavor, bright tongue assaulting tartness, acidic lemon notes, some light oxidized wood and lemon-head candy. The beer remains dry and full of carbonation. Easy to drink and a wake up call to the taste buds, my only complaint in the mouthfeel dept is the long lingering throat coating feeling that develops over just a couple of sips. Absolutely not for everyone but a Lindemans Cuvee Rene is s MUST TRY for the novice who is too hesitant to dive into a 15-50$ bottle of Cantillon or 3F, this brew will give you a pretty good idea of what the style is about and i you're down, spend the money on the other guys, its totally worth it."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable sipper."
"M&D - super dry, sour and acidic, which can be a bit off-putting, but it grew on me, very lively on the tongue throughout the sip"
"Poured from a capped and corked bottle into a Lost Abbey tulip-type stemmed glass. Pours a golden orange with a huge fluffy white head, which has excellent retention. Aromas of tart apples and lemon. Tastes like a granny smith apple, finishes sweet and tart like a lemon. Light body with lots of fine carbonation. Overall, much less tart than other lambics. A nice, approachable, easy to drink starter."
"Overall, a very enjoyable, balanced lambic that may be more approachable than some of the really sour ones out there. So far, this beer has aged extremely well and would easily hold up for another 10 years in the proper conditions."
"D: Definitely a beer I need to be in the right mood for. But I'm really glad I tried this. A really unique style I'd never had before."
"Verdict: If you're looking for an introduction to sours, you won't go wrong with a bottle of this. Quite the tart beast when fresh, I'd love to see how this beer mellows after a decade or so."
"Had this one night before my wedding and it was the perfect early evening beer to have with appys. Pours slightly flat with a slightly murky gold colour with a great sour yeasty nose. Just the right funky notes mixed with a tiny bit of sweetness on the finish. A very drinkable gueuze that still brings the quirks that make the style so special."
"drinkability: 1/2 x 750ml no issue"
"Wow this is one sour, mouth puckering beer. I'm absolutely loving it. The sourness is powerful and an all out assault on your mouth. We recently had this at a sour tasting and it was described as a mini Isabelle. I don't know about that, but it is readily available. This is one that I'll be revisiting quite often."
"D: I wasn't sure exactly what to expect from this one and I was very pleasantly surprised. A great mix of sour, funk, and fruit."
"Overall, hands down the best Lindemans I've had and a surprisingly good representation of the style. Would recommend this and certainly seek it out again."
"Overall: Delicious, and for $6 for a good gueze a real bargain."
"Flavor-Acidic but not very acidic. I like my mouth to pucker just a little. Sourness up front but fades fast to a seltzery dry finish. Barnyard flavors also end quick. Background of rhubarb is evident. High carbonation."
"355ml corked and capped bottle served in my DT tulip. Poured a hazy golden orange with a tight, frothy, bright white head that receded into a half inch cap. Thick bands of lacing were formed as the head dissipated. Nose is predominantly tart, light fruit (apple and lemon) with a hint of must in the back. Taste consistent with nose - exactly as anticipated; quite a bit of citric acid on this one. Mouthfeel is fairly light in character with a mild background effervescence that culminates in a slight pucker and a fairly dry finish. Still exploring this style, but a pretty enjoyable sipper with a low abv. Looking forward to trying some more of these."
"D= great. Quite the treat of a beer. Smooth and refreshing reccomended."
"D- one bottle was enough. my stomach felt torn up after this one. a little too acidic to tackle this one on my own. next time ill have a friend help."
"Drinkability is very good, although after a magnum of this you'll be ready to move on, even if only to another lambic. Definitely worth the experience and a long term cellar candidate. Cheers!"
"D: Well, it's pretty sour, so I wouldn't drink more than 1. Still, it's fairly accessible and drinkable for a lambic."
"D- A huge sipper. Not quite as drinkable as I would expect for the ABV. A very tasty, memorable, and expensive treat."
"Overall, this is a great Gueuze. Given my limited knowledge on the style, I can pretty much guarantee there are better and more highly regarded choices out there, but Lindeman's proves here they can make a quality brew that can stand the test of time. I have no idea how old this bottle is (my guess is no older than 2 years) but I would love to see how it changes with another year or two on it."
"Overall: This is a pretty decent beer. Maybe just a bit too carbonated, and the sour flavor is a little over the top. I love a sour beer, but this one is just a tiny bit too much."
"Overall, an outstanding beer that is clean and simple and better because of it."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a 1/4"" white head that fades quickly. The aroma is average. It has little malt or yeast aroma. It's moderately sour with a light funk to it. The taste is decent. It has a light, pilsner malt flavor that's accompanied with a dry, musty Brett character. It's mildly sour with some horse hair taste. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average gueuze. It's not as sour as it should be and the malt character is lacking."
"drinkability - is ok to good considering the style - i would not drink more then one a night but it does make me want to try more from this style"
"UPDATE: I am starting to become fond of sour beers, so I will be revisiting this one in the near future for a re-rate"
"It's been a while since I've had a good gueuze, and this one didn't disappoint."
"D- Overall, this is a very solid Gueze. The drinkability suffers a bit from the acidity, but this is something that I would love to age a little more. Definitely worth a shot! Recommended!"
"D - Absolutely a joy to drink. This style is my go-to warm weather brew, and the Cuvée René does not disappoint one bit. Be sure to take your time with this brew, as it only gets better as it warms - that's why I start with a refrigerated bottle and enjoy the progression. One of the best examples of gueuze that I've encountered."
"D: I loved it. As my palette expands with more of this style my opinion may change. But this one made me think I was drinking a style of beer instead of champaign."
"D - Not as sharp, tart as other Gueuze I have tried but still tasty."
"pretty decent and refreshing, but probably not a gueuze i'm seeking out again."
"Pours a crystal clear golden orange with a off white head that quickly disappears and leaves no clues that a head was ever present. Aroma has sour apple, acidity and a bit of yeast. The flavor has similar notes. Sour apple upfront with a nice biting tartness and it lingers with the finish being dry. Its a light bodied beer that is highly carbonated. I really like this beer, I haven't had many sours so I look forward to venturing into this realm much more."
"This is my go to Gueuze. Not the best, but affordable, and never dissappoints. Beautiful pale orange gold pour with a short lived white head. A bit of swirling reinvigorates. Smell is a bit of a toned down lambic. Nice wafts of sour apple and earthy cheese rind funk that never gets too offensive or out of hand. Sometimes you want that outlandish deep funk in a gueuze, but it is nice to know you have a reliable measure of moderation to fall back on in this beer. I respect it for that. Taste is more on the sour side than the funk, more granny smith apple than cheese rind. Highly carbonated and very high on the tongue. Champagne like and almost bubbly. Complements the dryness of the beer very well. For the style, drinkablity is as high as it gets. I like this beer very much as an in between beer when enjoying other more extreme lambics. A wonderful beer that I enjoy frequently."
"I had this one on the patio on a warm afternoon in May. Seemed about right for the setting. The beer is a cloudy gold color with a firm and very stable head. The aroma is somewhat sour with a fresh and sweaty funk that could have been a little more pronounced (for my tastes). It's got a subtle graininess and a an airy, yeasty freshness as well. The taste is very approachable. It's somewhat tart and has a solidly bitter background. It's say that the sourness is pallet-cleansing rather than mouth-puckering. It's like a gateway gueuze. However, the beer is quite well balanced, which makes it extremely drinkable. Not quite as wild and flashy as other lambics, but this one is very refreshing and quite good."
"D- Pairs well with Romano cheese. Very drinkable if you're into funky flavors"
"D: Easy drinker, but a little over the top sour. This could begin to wear on a person. Not too shabby over all. I'll definitely be seeking this one out again."
"Pours the color of apple juice. Only a bit of a head, even with an aggressive pour. Quickly settles to a tranquil surface. Strong mustily sour smell, not in a fruity way, almost more in a bacterial way (though obviously not really offensive). Taste isn't really sour apple, but more acidic, more vinegaric. More of a barnyard feel. Very try, like a very tangy saison. At first, overwhelmingly sour, but a bit overly ascetic. Sticky coating despite thin feel, once the sour subsides there's not much in the way of substance. Taste after is kind of cheesy, almost cottony. Drinkability isn't that great compared to the other gueze I had (Girardin 1882). I was a bit let down by this one. Not bad for a starter, but there is at least one gueze better."
"D: I usually link the feel to drinkability because it makes sense, but it doesn't translate as well here. Although the feel is really good, it becomes too much at times and makes this a bit of chore to get down after glass number one. This is absolutely a brew to share with a group. It has a nice wine like profile but it is so dry it feels like drinking a bottle of dry white. With that said, shared this is a great beer. Would absolutely visit again."
"Drinkability:this is a great beer,world class ,if this was a bit darker and more alcohol this would be a perfect beer,the flavors are fantastic,the sourness is close to perfection a bit more,perhap some ale qualities would do it."
"One of my favorite gueuzes, to be sure."
"D: Dry and refreshing and certainly drinkable."
"Cuvee rene pours a bright golden hazy yellow. Fizzy light head fades quickly. The smell is hard to describe, no hops not much malt. But there is some scents of citrus, but its hard to pick one out. The taste is tart as expected, but I didn't like how there was no sweetness to balance the tartness. And I dont like how there is no fruit backbone to help the beer. The mouth is light and the bubbles make it even lighter. At 5% it is a very drinkable beer, however after two glasses the tartness wrecks my tastes."
"Wow! Intense sharp tart aroma and flavor. Intense, complex aromatics...higher alcohols? Something made me cough. Very tart flavor profile. Lemon fruit, lemon rind, red grapefruit. The sour flavors completely obscure any malt sweetness. Only a slight vinegar component. I like this better than the more vinegary RR Compunction or Cantillon Rose de Grambrinus. Startling amount of flavor packed into this low-alcohol, light-colored beer. Doesn't have a lot of depth, though. It's all right there in front."
"D - Overall not too bad but not the best I've had (Cantillon takes that honour). Having said that, I certainly would not turn my nose up at this one if it was offered."
"Thanks to Sandstone for this one. Cloudy goldenrod color with a large white head. Aroma is pleasantly tart with lemon and orange notes. Flavor is medium acidic with unripe citrus and apple and a touch of lactic funkiness. Semidry finish with a very smooth mouthfeel. More of an intro gueuze than a tooth-enamel-destroyer with massive complexity, but still very solid."
"All around a great beer, i personally prefer the more tart gueze's but am definitely gonna keep buying this one."
"D - I was caught off guard by the smell and appearance. Out of the Lambic family, I'd personally rank this one the lowest out of the other's I've tried. This is not a beer you would bring to a party and slam. This is more of the sipping kind you would bring out for a special occasion."
"some murky... quite a bit actually... pour is apple juice with a nice sized head. sort of a surprise. smell is like a lambic. musty sour apple. mellow gueze. quite grassy actually. no metallic in the aluminum sense but its there with a straw finish in the malt. apple is there. mildly in comparison to most. i'm surprised. the murkier side of the bottle is better but linderman's i thought i hated you. this is nice. and for the price fantastic. quite lemony. no as astringent as expected. will have again. a basic, but between this and oud beersel a good introduction to gueze. i personal think linderman's best."
"Pours a hazy golden color with a light bit of orange. Huge fluffy white head. All I can smell is some serious acidic citrus notes, followed by an intriguing subtle mustiness. Highly carbonated - the mouthfeel is great! Very dry. Fantastic sour flavor that subsides quickly and finishes crisp."
"Pours a gazed orange hued gold with a white head. Nose is grassy funky with a sweet edge. Flavor is grassy. Mix of sweet edges on a mildly funky tone. Feel is a fairly vibrant carbonation and the liquid is slick. This is a good starter gueuze as many have said before. If you don't want to dive all the way in with something super funky, this is the one to go for."
"Medium light bodied, with ample carbonation. I personally have always loved sours, so I was not surprised that I enjoyed this beer as much as I did. So smooth and delicious despite the funk, sour and tartness it really gets my mouth watering. Considering the low ABV this is highly drinkable."
"D - Not bad for my first gueuze, but not my favorite style. I'll try one of these again, but it won't be for a while."
"Overall, this is certainly the best beer in Lindeman's regular lineup. A solid gueuze that I'm sure gets less attention than it deserves because it is from the notorious sweet panty peeler lambic producer that we all know and give to girls. This however, is a solid representation of the style, and is not one to be neglected, a good gueuze for sure."
"Pours a cloudy yellow fizzy. White head, small bubbles. Kinda looks like champagne. Very sour aroma, like rotten something, but only the sour. Very sour taste, bubbly mouthfeel. Different feeling. Odd. Different taste if I drink it with my whole mouth versus just my throat."
"D - This reminds me a lot of a Berliner Weissbier, but without malt and with fruit. It's not my favorite beer, it's not my favorite style, but I'll probably give another gueze a try one day."
"D - Definitely good, would like to up my samplings and spelling of the gueuze."
"If you like sour, this one is pretty drinkable. Not terribly complicated, but tasty and smooth. Considering the price and availability of this one, it rocks, although flavor-wise it doesn't stack up against the best in class."
"M/D - Light, fruity and very tart feel. Also on the dryer side. Incredibly drinkable."
"I poured from a 750 ml bottle into a large snifter. It pours a pale, clear yellow with an abundant white head. Lacing is left everywhere. The aroma is sour, sweet and funky with a bit of alcohol thrown in. The flavor is tart fruit, maybe apples, with a dry finish. The beer is light bodied and highly carbonated. The beer is a slow sipper. This is my first gueuze so I was not sure what to expect. It was good for a change of pace, but I will need to try another for comparison purposes."
"If you like gueuzes, this one is worth a try, especially if you don't like them really tart. Not sure I'd grab this one again though. For a few $ more you can do better."
"M&D: slightly spritzy and full of tiny fizz, the palate is therefore clean, refreshing and light, making this a really quaffable session geuze in my book! It's easy to drink the whole 750ml bottle, no sweat, but it takes some extraordinary elements to elevate this ale to the real exciting league."
"Even if you're not a huge fan of sours try it just to see what the Brett/barnyard thing is all about. It's a good representation of that."
"My first Gueuze and I'll be looking for others."
"355ml green capped and corked bottle purchased at the liquor store in Tyngsborro, Mass. Pours a crystal-clear golden body with virtually no head to speak of. Smells fruity and acidic. Tastes fruity sweet and acidic sour. Light in body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. I wish I had more to say about this beer, I really enjoyed it and it's the best Gueuze I've had thus far, and it disappeared more quickly that I would have liked."
"it pours up a brilliant gold color with a nice fluffy white head. the nose is wood, tart fruits, sourness. the taste is tart as hell! it tastes the same as the nose but with a lot of lemon flavor, I get oak, it leaves a chewy feel on your teeth. a very smoothe brew, full bodied, medium smoothe carbo. A nice, sour treat."
"Very easy to drink and although I don't see myself buying a lot of Lindeman's myself I will highly recommend this to anyone trying a Geuze! Definitely fits in the style. Has to be one of the best in the category."
"d) If I compare this with Timmermans Tradition Gueuze, I get two completely different ales. The former is fruity, cidery, simple and refereshing. This is challenging, sophisticated, and infinitely more interesting."
"Cuvee Rene is a solid Gueuze, a surprise from Lindemans for me and something I can recommend. For $10 a 750ml I would buy this again. How about it!"
"I think this is the best beer that Lindeman's makes and they should stop mixing good lambic like this into the overly sweet and syrupy fruity beers they make. This stuff is excellent."
"date consumed: 29 Sep 2008"
"Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René is a highly sparkling golden beer with a thick, fluffy, slightly yellowed white head that has outstanding retention and leaves excellent lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite powerful and carries notes of funk, cheese, horse blanket, cave and mud. It is light bodied, fluffy and bubbly on the tongue. The finish is crisp and dry. It is very sour, musty and funky, with no noticeable sweetness. There are notes of champagne, bleu cheese and hay. It's a very bretty affair. The finish is full of green apples. It is tart through and through. What a unique beer!"
"Drinkability is good. I think I will be able to finish the bottle and although it is pricey, I would love to always have some of these sitting around for special occasions and would like to get one to age. Very great drink overall."
"Notes: Really sour! Did not expect that from the same company that provides us with sticky-sweet candy beers. The body is a little lacking in texture, but still, this is probably the best beer they make (that we get here)."
"D: Only 5%, this ale is a testimony to ingenuity by Belgian brewers. So much flavor in such a small package is a great Christmas eve treat."
"Thank you Lindemans, you exceeded every expectation I had with this classic lambic offering. It's still so remarkable that I can get this in London Ontario."
"8/4/8/4/18/4.2"
"D: ridiculously smooth for as fresh as it is. cant wait to see the sours age. wonderful beer."
"Very nice. If you've never had a lambic I would recommend this one to start with. It's simply great!"
"This is an excellent, affordable example of the gueuze style. Delicious. Highly recommended."
"a great beer to enjoyed by fans of this style and also a gateway beer for people wanting to get into this style"
"Overall, this one won't be for everyone, but it definitely warrants a tasting session."
"Pours a cloudy dark golden orange color with a thick foamy head. Funky tart aroma that is sweet, sour and vinuous at the same time with yeast and light crisp frruit notes. Sour and puckering with a nice amount of carbonation. Champagne-like with sweet crisp light fruits (apple, pear and grape) and a very dry sour finish. Acidic."
"Reviewed on 3/4/08. 750 mL bottle. Poured a light orange with a small white head. Aroma of barnyard funk, tart fruits. Taste was of tart raspberries and apple. I liked this one because it wasn't TOO sour and was easy to drink. An excellent gueuze. 8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Sour bomb on the palate, but that's expected with this style. Fruitiness reminds me of peach, apricot, and more. Finishes sour as well, but not overwhelmingly sour."
"Drinkability: I was initally scared to drink this beer but after trying it am very impressed. I will definitely be drinking again."
"D- I drank the whole bottle with complete ease. And I totally want another one. I will be buying the whole stores stock of this stuff. LOVE IT. BRING ON MORE GUEZE!"
"At only 10.99 a bottle, I may buy them out."
"I havent had too many Guezes but I really enjoy them. I enjoy the sour ones the most and this was pretty sour and tart. I really liked it. Best part is, it is light in alcohol so it is quite thirst quenching. Thanks again lithy."
"D: Compared to the others that I've had, this is like a gueuze with training wheels - which makes this a good one for those who are have not been initiated to intensely sour Belgians. Overall, it's good, but I'd rather have a Drie Fonteinen."
"Mmmm! This is one tasty, tasty bottle. Would like to have it over and over again. Very highly drinkable, as long as you aren't opposed to sours."
"Drinkability: I rated this low because I think this beer would be too much after a while."
"A criticism of the beer is that there isn't enough body behind the sour green apple flavor."
"D - This is a great beer overall but I am not sure that it has great drink-ability for me. It seems like its tart flavour would start to rub me the wrong way after a few of these."
"Did I mention this was sour? I prefer Lindemans other gueuze to this (much more fruit flavors and depth IMO). It is still interesting, just not my cup of tea."
"D: For a gueze yes."
"Beer pours a dark golden color with a modest head. The aroma is citrus big time with some barnyard smells lying beneath. This beer is tart and sour. It brings flavors of lemon and sour apple. Acidic, dry, and puckery. Yet somehow I can set this drinkable brew down. A great beer. Definitely give a try if you have not had a chance."
"Pours a hazy, golden color with minimal white head that stays with you til the end. Aroma smells of tart citrus, sour apple, a bit of mustiness and funk. Great representation of the Gueze style. Taste is very good. Sour apple dominates the flavor for me with a bit of mustiness tucked in there. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste, although I haven't had a great deal of Guezues. Drinkability is great. I can't get enough of this and think it is a great introduction into the world of sours."
"D: Complexity of flavor is okay but not a lot going on but is decent overall and best shared with a friend. ."
"D- I am of two minds. Light body and tartness are at odds. The tartness is almost too much for me, obscuring the malt and the bretty characters."
"I poured this into my oversized Triple Karmeliet tulip using several pours. This is my first tango with a gueze so bare with me. The appearance is a hazy peach that burst forth a large white head that melts away into a gentle ring on the sides of the glass. This beer has a surprisingly think appearance. Even when held to the light, nothing will show through. The aroma is musty at first, then with tart citric notes that come fluttering in. There are also spicy notes that almost remind me of the nutmeg aromas from a pumpkin pie. The aroma is very complex but yet oddly straightforward. While it seems that there are many notes coming from the beer, with every new whiff something else comes through. All the aromas are straightforward. The taste is again musty up front with just a slight bit of funk. Then its cheek puckering citric tartness, the kind that hits you right behind the jaw. This is really good. The mouthfeel is crisp and very dry, with just a light carbonation that lends itself to the dryness. This is a great beer. Very well crafted by the brewers at Lindemans. Unfortunately, its not something I could drink everyday."
"This one's pretty good though I haven't much to compare to. Will continue to explore the world of sours."
"Drinkability will be high here. One can get this beer locally at Roof Brothers in Paducah."
"I love Belgium."
"Decent for the price."
"In the future I'll have to empty out the wallet for the wine sized bottle because this personal sized serving was simply not enough. Although it didn't impress me as much as some of what Belgium's other (more traditional) lambic producers offer, this was still hands down every bit as charming and pleasant I've known gueuzes to be."
"D- Reminds me of a berlinerweis as far as the tartness and (kinda)low ABV goes. Great summer beer!"
"D - A fairly approchable version of the style. Not something I'd drink every day but good to have on hand for something to mix things up."
"Taste is pleasant, sour lemon pith with a green apple tartness. Like tiny, underripe green grapes. Light fading wheat, hinting at clover honey in the aftertaste. Clean and spritzy mouthfeel, it will definitely get the salivary glands working. Sourness and acidity are at a medium level, and fairly approachable for non-diehard Gueuze fans. The bottle disappeared with dinner very quickly, probably in less than an hour. Great with seafood or aromatic cheese."
"Update:I love gueuze."
"A classy, enjoyable gueuze that will thrill all who love this style."
"It pours a pale golden colour with a tall course bubbled white head which retreated to a patchy but persistent covering over the beer. There is a slight haze and an enthusiastic carbonation working the glass to maintain the head. The aroma is funky and complex. Once you get past the punch in the face of sweaty horse there is subtle sweet fruitiness and a hint of sour. The sour comes with a vengeance once you sip this one. Bone dry, intensely sour, fruity in a grapey, dry white wine kind of a way. So hard to describe, each mouthfull you find something different. Wow."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a nice muted copper with some very nice head and excellent lacing. It has a very tart, if understated, aroma, with almost nothing else beyond that tartness. Same for the flavor, although it is very excellent and right in line with the style. Nice smoothness, starts as extremely nice and is just a bit rough at the very end. Really nice desert beer."
"This gueze is well carbonated and its fizziness percolates the palette. Very light and effervescent. Despite the high impact of the sour and tart flavors it is easy to enjoy the full glass and look for more.. Works well with many different foods, especially many seafood dishes."
"4.5/3.5/4/4/4"
"It's not the cleanest nor the most puckering Gueuze I've ever had, but it might just be the most refreshing. Served with a three cheese tortellini, with a brown butter, sage, & Greek myzithra cheese sauce, and I couldn't get enough of either. Enjoy."
"I never understood why lambics/guezes were considered 'refreshing' until now. This one is really hitting the spot right now. This could be thee sessionable 'sour beer' (if it wasn't so dang pricey)."
"beer to dig out when your wine-loving friends come over."
"Very dry, but the mouthfeel is quite watery. Lot's of acidity and carbonation. It is very drinkable, but more then one, and I don't think the tastebuds would be existent any longer."
"smooth with lots of carbonation in the mouth. mouth puckering, but not overwhelming. leaves a dry mouthfeel. has a sweet tartness to it. the flavors are very silimar to lindemans framboise, only without the actual berry flavor itself. it becomes much more bitter as it warms and opens up."
"Faint musky smell when first opened. Pour reveals a dusty straw color. Smell is immediate sweat and funky, but not overpowering. Taste is mindblowing. The funk is up front, but there's malt in there too. This, unlike Cantillon IMHO, is what a funked beer should be. Very elegant flavors. Mouthfeel is great as the bubble is not too shocking. Easily the best bacteria-fied beer I've had."
"D: This style of beer certainly isn't for everyone, but this is a big winner in my book. Perfect sipper for summer...or spring...or fall...oh, maybe winter, too. At just 5% ABV, alcohol is no issue. Liked this very much and would make a point of having it again. Recommended to gueuze lovers (or wanna-be's)!"
"drinkability is decent. this is an acidic brew without much complexity, but the simplicity works well with the tart and sour profile. this is basically a lambic without the sweetness and the fruit. cheers!"
"Brown colo with a creamy off-white head. Nice lacing as well. The nose has a sour citrus front accompanied by musky oak, and funky fruits. Taste is again very tart with some earthy funk behind it. Not as complex as the nose lead me to beleive. Crisp and refreshing body. A good example of the style and definately Lindeman's best brew."
"750ml bottle $9.49 bottled in 2005. Appearance is a really nice orange with a lasting white head. The smell from the bottle is really nice and funky. The smell from the glass is pungent, earthy funk. Musty, dank basement funk. The taste is quite sour and has a nice pucker. There is also a cheesy, lactic funk and earthy mushrooms. Sour fruitiness that is pretty much what I was hoping this beer would deliver. I've had sour beers before but this is my first gueuze, seems like a perfect beer to pair with cheese. The intensity of the beer reduces it to a sipper for me despite the low ABV."
"Balanced and subtle, full of great flavors that make the mouth water. This should turn a rookie's head and give a seasoned vet something to mull over. Solid offering and reasonably widely available."
"Bottle shared by fly along with pint_size, and aceofhearts. Pours a glowing bright orange color with a very light, bright white head. Smell is funky sourness, and a bit gauzy. Taste is nicely tart, and yet faintly sweet, moreso than I remember from other gueuzes at least. Some oaky tart dryness and citrusy flavor to accompany as well. I'm not there yet, but I'm coming around on the style slowly. Thanks for sharing again, Alan!"
"P.S. I disagree with Jason Alstrom on this one and feel that the fruited lambics would be much better suited for newbie beer/belgium ale drinkers than this offereing. Don't get me wrong, you're still the man, J!"
"Bottle corked and capped, foil wrapped. A very nice presentation. Pours a clean copper orange color with very little, if any, yeast in suspension after a careful pour. Big white, bubbly head that lasts long. Very intricate lacing in the wide-mouth goblet I've poured into. The nose is complex and pungent, but all in good ways. Decidedly musty and earthy, this beer smells of history and masterful technique. The ""barnyard"" scents are here in full force, along with an almost fruity sweet accent floating around to tame the pungent nature of this wild beer. This beer is far less sweet than the Lindemans Gueuze, and more accurately reflects the traditional style and nature of what a good gueuze ought to be. The palate is forcefully tart up front, with bitter fruits and straw asserting themselves early. Slight Vinegar-like character which causes the mouth to water in a wonderful way ... something I actually love in a Lambic beer. Fruity and quite acidic throughout, the gueuze warms to a slightly smoother malted wheat foundation. Finishes quite dry and lively with aggressive carbonation levels from start to finish. This is, in my mind, standard for the style and a great example of the age-old craft of producing fine, champagne-like beers through the magic of spontaneous fermentation. A truly excellent beer and a beer that redeems my hope in Lindemans ... a brewer typically known for their sugary sweet ""soda pop"" lambics here in America. If you buy this beer thinking it'll be something like one of those, boy are you in for a shock. A great Gueuze!"
"Absolutely strange and odd. My brain tells me not to drink something so sweetly rotten, but I can't help loving it so much."
"My first beer in this style. A winner."
"As soon as I pulled the cork, the funk spread throughout the room. My wife was laughing because it ""stunk"" so bad. I said it was the smell of greatness. It poured a cidery straw gold with a slight haze and lively head that vanished quickly. Slight yeast sediment that I left in bottle. The aroma was filled with Brett and wet cork. You can smell the seasoned oak casks like they are right in front of you. Slight hints of a fruity chardonay and soft vinegar. The taste is full of acidity and heavy tones of sour green apples. There is a raw oakiness that stands out well after the finish. The sourness is sharp right away, but leads to a very dry finish. It reminds me very much of an ultra-dry cider that I brewed a year ago. The body is thin up front, and on the sides, but holds a good amount of complexity as the swallow finishes. This is one of my first true gueuze and I can see how this would become a beer that you want to keep in stock for occasions that call for a beer like this. Not for everyone, to say the least, but I find myself honored to enjoy a beer of this complexity and craft."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1"" white head over the clear, orangey-golden brew. Foamy head lasts well, and lacing are is nice for the style. Aroma is piercing tartness with an earthy tinge to it. Taste starts with a subtle smoothness, but quickly turns to the tartness expected, but doesn't overdo the effect. Flavor linger sin the mouth, but that's a compliment, not a fault. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent for the style, almost risking ""dumbing down"" the style a bit compared to others, almost a gateway brew for the style. Very enjoyable."
"Verdict: Not quite sour as Boon but still a decent example of the style."
"Drinkability: Good for those times when you're just feeling mighty damn sour."
"Pours a lovely reddish gold color with a delicate-yet-hard white head that fades to a collar. The nose has a cidery note and a bit of hard, minerally oxidation, but the main element is a winey note, something like a citrus infused dry vermouth. And there's also a lovely, scratchy, wild barnyard note. On the palate, highly acidic, especially at the front and end of the palate, with big lemon juice flavors and a slightly seedy, yeasty note. Mouthfeel is puckering and intense, but not so much so as some other gueuzes out there. Still, that lack of punch actually makes for an exceedingly drinkable ale that combines a touch of smoothness (for the style) and richness with plenty of acidity, citrus, and barnyard for the classic gueuze characteristics. Excellent beer."
"Taste/mouthfeel - Very sour, both lactic and acetic. I'm generally used to Lindemans beers being too sweet and syrupy, so this is a nice surprise. Strong notes of sourdough bread, lemon juice, green apples and vinegar. Tart, fruity notes linger on the palate in the finish. Pretty light-bodied stuff, and very refreshing. Not a top notch gueuze, but a solid one."
"Pours a cloudy yellowish color with a small white head. In the aroma, a sour fruitiness, somewhat like white grape. In the taste, small tartness and a small fruitiness, and yeasty too. A small sour bite in the mouthfeel and a dry fruitiness in the aftertaste. Nice sourness and fruity presence, very nice."
"Interesting and weird. This isnt as tasty as Id hoped, but it is cool. I look forward to trying more Gueuzes, only theyre so expensive round here."
"Bottle dated 1994. Pours darker than expected, a dark amber color, clear, with a dense, snow white head that lingers long. Aroma is hugely complex, with lots of musty character, some sourness, and very funky, with horse blanket and all you would expect from a true lambic. The flavor is equally complex, acetic and musty but with a balancing sweetness. Aftertaste is equally complex, leaving you wanting more. A great lambic for the true lambic fan."
"Overall, this tastes a lot more like a sparkling cider or champagne than a beer. I was expecting a lot more traditional sourness - this was very sweet and alco-poppy."
"Drinks a bit slow, due to the dryness & tartness, in style, but not very pleasing to me. Better Guezes out there IMO, lacked complexity to me. Maybe a few more years of aging are in order?"
"An A+ beer and much more than I was expecting from Lindemans."
"A good start for someone trying to get into gueuzes; not extreme but well representative and easier to drink than most."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with tiny bubbles of carbonation. Medium body. This is the best Lindemans offering I have tasted."
"This beer pours with quite a big head, lacing is also very good... Lots of different aroma's, citrus, funk, fruit... Taste is refreshing and twangy, lots of flavours lie in the depths of this brew... A Great Gueuze for sure.. but split the 750ml bottle with another person!"
"25.4 oz. bottle- color of hazy mango , with a eggshell colored head - nose of lovely sourness , cobwebs , slight sweetness , apricots , and tobbacco  taste of apricots , sour , tart cherries , cobwebs , and tobacco - body is medium , dry , and with high carbonation  aftertaste of dried apricots , tobacco , tart , dry , and gummy"
"This is a tasty, drinkable classic/traditional gueuze that is tart/sour but with a nice rounding sweetness."
"I believe this is my first attempt at this style, and I'm intrigued. I'll definitely have to seek out more, to see how this compares."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden, huge soapy white head forms, big bubbles, quickly settles down to a decent layer, leaves some sticky lace on its way down. Smell is insane, very fresh and funky, sharp spice bite, sour fruits, acidity, citrus, apples, nice. Taste is sour apples, citrus, caramel, funk, hay, citric acidity in the finish, nice and sour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation, very smooth. Nice balance, very drinkable Gueuze with enough complexity to keep people happy, and not too intense to keep people away. Thanks a lot Jay!"
"D: A bit startling at first, especially if unaccustomed to this style. After settling in this is a very drinkable beer. Would imagine this would pair well with pungent cheese or a sour fruit tart for dessert."
"served from the corked 750ml bottle. This beer is very carbonated. Pours into the glass and a large head immediately forms. The head is maintained and produces a lot of lacing in the glass. The smell of this beer is very tart and so is the taste. I assume this profile is typical among lambics, but this is my first one so I don't have a comparison. This is a good beer, I am just not quite accustomed to the lambic profile."
"Not very funky or vinegary, but plenty sour, a gueuze on the simple and approachable side."
"Picked one of these up at San Roque Market in Santa Barbara, CA. I'm a gueuze novice, so take my critique with a grain of salt. I wasn't overly impressed with the bland pale body, but it did have a healthy looking amount of carbonation. Not a very strong smell, but there is an apple cider and vinegar scent most predominantly. The scent is magnified in the flavor. It's a strong sourness of cider, vinegar and lemon which hits the tongue and numbs it up good. This feels like a sipper, but I found myself gulping it down after I noticed that sipping or gulping didn't effect the level of sourness, and I felt I might as well as drink as much of it as I could considering the cost."
"Dark gold in colour with a bit of haze and a gentle carbonation. Aromas of wet cedar, sour lemon, and cherry pits. More lactic lemony sourness in the mouth, along with some mild woody astringency. As it warmed, a bit of a toungue coating cheese element revealed itself. Very drinkable and refreshing stuff, although perhaps it lacks a bit of the complexity that you'd find in some other beers of this style. Not overly farmhouse-funky, but I find myself wanting to take larger sips. If there were a ""session gueuze", this would probably be it."
"Taste is just straight up puckeringly dry and sour. Woody flavours with the lemony sourness with a bit of sour cherry. As the beer warms a cheesy character begins to appear, especially in the finish. Not a lot of complexity I find, but it's very tasty. Mouthfeel is very dry and sticky, puckering as I said, and the carbonation is quite mild. I'm not sure If I'd like more than one of these, I'm not the world's biggest ""sour"" fan but I can respect this beer for the style and what it is. Certainly unique and I'm looking forward to lots more beers in this style in the future."
"This one is on the tamer side for a gueuze, but also very nicely balanced and refreshing with some interesting character. Pours a slightly cloudy golden with a huge white rocky head that fades to a 1/2 inch cap that sticks around. Quite good lacing. The smell is a little faint, but pleasant. Notes of lemon, grass, and a slight whiff of ripe cheese. The taste is more substantial with a somewhat restrained acidity for the style, some barnyard notes, some spice, and a lingering bitterness that is not from the hops. Quite nice. The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied and relatively crisp. Very drinkable."
"This beer is very light in body and super dry, not something that you can easily drink quickly. I know many people hate these beers but I love them, this is a real thinking man's beer!"
"D - I am unsure if I would drink this often. I think I would need to do more exploration with Gueze in order really say if this has a high drinkability factor. I would rate this based on the expectation of a Gueze."
"Taste is like the most mouth puckering lemon has been drained of all its moisture and shoved into your mouth. Quite tasty and unusual. This is my first gueuze as you can probably tell. Very dry in the finish with a long linguering lemony/grapey aftertaste. Suprising and good."
"It pours a cloudy straw color with a thick white head. It has the distinctive sour aroma that is present in lambics and other sour beers. The flavor is very tart and sour and gives me a tingling sensation beneath my jaw in my neck. The flavor is dry, but not overly so. It leaves a dry feeling on my tongue and the carbonation creates a tingly sensation. The bottle I got was a 750ml, and it was a bit much for this beer. This is by no means a session beer."
"A solid effort, a real lambic, bone dry, no relation to the sweet fruit ""lambics"" made by this producer. The flavor profile is simple and pure, might be even better if they let it get a bit dirtier."
"Overall, not as sour or as fruity as I expected; but then, I am not familiar with the style. Likeable, but a bit expensive for what you get."
"Poured hazy pale orange with a dense lumpy head. Smell was sweet and floral with a hint of sourness and oak. Taste was sour apple cider, dry, none of the sweetness here, astringent and mouth-coating -- in a good way. I wish this beer was thicker, more full-bodied. Finish was dry as a bone and felt like another sip. Very good, but oddly frustrating, because you wish it were just a little bit better."
"Moderately refreshing, and drinkable, but not fantastic. How is this a Cuvee?"
"Overall this is a great example of Gueze. It is so much better than the more commercial fruit lambics from Lindemans. I dont think I could drink this very often and definitely needed others to help me finish, but for the style it is very drinkable. It was enjoyed by several who only rarely drink anything other than BMC. I continue to be amazed at the flavors and smells produced in this beer style and will seek out this and other examples as I get the chance."
"A fantastic gueuze, balanced, drinkable and full of flavour"
"Drinkability: The underlying floral tones make this an intriguing taste treat even for someone, like me, who would rarely reach for a sour beer"
"Flavor similar to, but also quite different from the other gueuzes I have tried. It has the standard sour, but the organic earthy farmyard is much more subtle. The sour is easily recognizable as green apple, both in tartness but also in underlying sugar sweetness. A really good Jolly Rancher. You know, I like this one as a very good representative of the style, but to be honest, it's a little too candy-like to be my favorite."
"lactic. it's sharp up front, but finishes like a sweet lemonade. pear, raspberry"
"Poured out a clear copper color, with a thin off-white head that dissipates quickly with nice lacing. The aroma is strong, sour, and tart. The flavor is still quite tart, but the flavor has a nice fruity apricot roundness with hints of overripe apple and a bit of funk in the finish. Acidic and dry smooth and drinkable."
"maybe not the most traditional.. I dont really know, its good though, and I like that."
"D - Very unique and good drinkability."
"By far one of the most interesting beers I've ever had in my life. It wasn't really better or worse than anything I've had...just interesting. I was told by my roommate that Gueuze is also called Belgian Champagne. I agree, there was definatly a similar taste between the two. I noted a very cidery, vinigarish scent. Almost no hop bitterness as a result of aged hops being used. I would drink it again, however I had difficulty drinking the entire 750mL bottle. The only issue I had was I thought it was a crown cap, and it is, but underneath the crown is a cork. I didn't have a corkscrew on me, so I had to wait to actually have to drink the beer. Also, it seemed slightly overcarbonated. I'm not sure if thats the style but by compairson to other ales I was drinking, it seemed excessive. I would repeat drinking this once in a great while, however it did peak my interest in trying other types of Gueuze."
"Cheers!"
"The Cuvée René was picked up in a 750 ml. green bomber, with gold neck foil, and a crown cap, which when popped was underlain by a cork. After opening, the Gueuze Lambic was poured into a flute glass, where it looked deep golden, with a two finger head fed by Champagne like constant carbonation. Taking a whiff yielded a smell with a mixture of sweet and sour elements, but little of the farmhouse smells like leather or sweat found in other Gueuze Lambics. I could also detect a marigold like floral hop presence. The sip confirmed what the nose had revealed. This was quite mild for an unflavored Lambic. There was a lot of sourness of course, but it was a clean and crisp sourness like a lemon juice poured into a regular beer. Not a lot of funkiness in this one at all. The beer was crisp and light in the mouth, and was very easy to gobble down. Drier than the lunar seas, this would be a good introduction into unblended Lambics for an uninitiated drinker, but if you are looking for a ton of flavors go for something else (e.g., Cantillon) instead."
"750 mL corked-n-capped, green champagne bottle with '05 notched on the label. It pours a mildly-hazy bright orange with medium carbonation and a 1"" off-white head that reduces to almost nothing by the end. The aroma is acidic and lightly sweet with lemon, a mild earthy/musty character, and some phenols that are a tad fruity. It is light to medium on the palate with an equal finish, and it is lightly drying with a taste that is tart, bitter, sour, and acidic, with lemon juice and phenols. It almost has more mouth-puckering sensation than flavor. It's a bit difficult to drink if you're not in the mood as it is quite sour and bitter, but as far as gueuze goes, it's not too bad."
"Very tart flavor, sour. A hint of sweeteness, faintly malty, steps in to balance things up, but this beer remains dry in the finish. Unlike Rose de Gambrinus, I found this beer quite drinkable -- its tartness was not so unyeilding. This beer is light-bodied and actually fairly refreshing. A good beer to celebrate moving into a new place."
"Pours pale orange with a slight haziness. Large foamy head, champagne like that dissipates into a thin head. Lots of lacing. Smells of sour fruits, effervescence. Taste follows with an interesting blend of sour fruits, basically tastes a bit like rotting citrus without the stench of rot :). I haven't had a gueuze yet, but I assume this is what they are supposed to taste like. Gives an ancient type of feel, yet is elegant as well."
"Excellent representation of the style, while I prefer the fruitier lambic."
"Notes: I love this beer. It is so flavorful and so refreshing. I will always have this or others like it on hand at all times."
"D - This is definitely a go-to gueuze. It's solid across the board, and easy to drink if you're ready to drink a brew of this style."
"Full bodied and extraordinarily refreshing. A fantastic beer for the summer."
"What else can I say? A beautifully crafted ale, aged to near perfection stylistically. What a wonderful introduction to Browerij Lindemans. I'm curious to try a more recent vintage to compare."
"Very thin and high in carbonation. That's about all there is to it. Pretty easy drinking despite the carbonation and the funkiness. I enjoyed it but likely not something i'll seek out in the future."
"Ok, I'm ending this review before this beer makes me sick. This is not a pleasant Belgian sour ale, but hardly drinkable in my opinion. Imagine Red Bull without any sweetness - you're there."
"taste is better; assertively tart with some sour apple and lemon rinds. acidic, vinegary, slightly off-putting finish. lacking in character and complexity compared to some other gueuzes, with more of a straightforward tartness, but far better than Lindemans' other gueuze."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Cold, the mouthfeel is nothing short of amazing. The champagne-like bubbles pop and foam in the mouth and showcase the nuances of such a complex beer. As it comes to temperature, it becomes less carbonated and drinks more like a younger geueze, a few months from being drawn from the barrel. Overall, I loved this beer... it has an approachability that I find very attractive, and it drinks easily by itself or with light appetizers."
"Pours out a clear apricot with a thin yet frothy head. Very little carbonation makes this look almost still. Some lacing here and there. Smell is of musty attics, oak, wheat, and citrus peel. I pick up a little spiciness along with an acidic tinge married with some faint sugars. Flavor is, at first, a fairly loud sour presence, which quickly backs down to a barely sweet middle. Tastes are of the typical musty old house accompanied by lime pith and tart, underripe fruit. I hoped for this to be a bit more balls-to-the-wall, but its subdued elegance is satisfying enough. Mouthfeel is light, slightly bubbly, and, overall, drying in the finish, but could be drier. Really refreshing and complex enough to be highly drinkable, but the faint residual sugars need to go and this needs to dry up."
"Not something I'd drink every day, but a beer I enjoyed enough to actively try more from the style."
"Very interesting Geuze (should I say a Premium Geuze?) from a well-established brewery. Much more sour and tart than Lindemann's regular products but closer to original artisan Geuze and that makes it worth a try. Very dry aromatic brew with majestic crown and straight-between-the-eye taste. Pleasant - but I doubt it will become your everyday beer."
"Clear gold, topped with a giant puff of white foam. A solid, large bubbled coating remains, tons of lace dappled all over the goblet. Racing carbonation bubbles. Pleasantly funky, farmy aroma. Moderate tartness, with strong bleu cheese notes. Wet grass, green apple and aluminum. The flavor starts out with a fizzy explosion of carbonation, very airy and light feeling. Tartness, stronger than I'd anticipated from a Lindemann's brew, takes over the palate with a green apple flair. Funky, cheese, moldy notes in the finish, with freshly mown grass and receding fruity sourness. Some citrusy notes in the aftertaste, lemon/lime, finishing the beer off with a fresh, sparkling feel. Chalky and very dry. The acidity is a bit more restrained than say, a Cantillon, which makes for supreme drinkability. Really, really nice."
"I'm not sure what I expected, but this was a rare treat. Not as over the top as I imagined...but 750 ml goes pretty quickly even when savoring evey sip."
"Notes: I liked it but it was just OK."
"Mouthfeel is light and wispy, crisp, thin yet satisfying. Not a real complex gueuze, softer, pretty basic, very user-friendly. Not as musty as it should be, not even a lot of sediment in the bottle, but good nonetheless."
"750 ml bottle. Very effervescent, almost champagne-like. Thin, persistent head with a creamy appearance. Right from the pour, smells sharp, almost astringent, but has notes of apricot. Mouthfeel is thinner than the fruit lambics, but creamier than, say, a pils. Taste is sharp at first, then mellows into a pleasant sour note on the back of the tongue. All in all, very enjoyable. Definitely a different experience than the sweet gueuze beers."
"drinkability: a pefect light drinking summer beer, heck pair this with burgers and fries, or something like that. A lambic that is very sour and tart compared to even the funkiest saisons. a beer for all seasons"
"Ive had this 2002 edition since 2004 when I purchased it in Minneapolis, MN. Why did I wait to drink it? I wasnt cellaring it. I just didnt drink it. I guess I figured it wouldnt be this good. Now I am happy I can buy more in Kansas City. Id be happy to drink this again on a hot summers day or with a salad or with bleu cheese or all by itself. Recommended!"
"Yellow-gold. Suprisingly clear. Aroma shows floral elements, semi-tartness, and sweetness. On the palate, the initial threat of tartness gievs way to a mild sweetness before that tart element returns rapidly. The flavors are bright and satisfying. Overall this contributes to a pleasant sensation. Cuvee Rene is refreshing, and perfectly quaffable."
"The flavor is fruity and tart, again with the grape skins and a bit of sour apple. It is light-medium in body and a bit acidic. Nice brew."
"By far not my style of beer so my review may bang it a bit more than it deserves. Pours an orangeish amber into the glass. Minimal head and minimal lacing. Sweet fruity aroma. Astringent melony taste. Probably the best gueuze I have had to date, but still far from what I would buy. Perhaps my tastes are changing, yet again. I guess we shall see."
"Taste: Carbonation is livid, the acidity level was nice and reminded me of the time I crunched on a piece of raw wild rhubarb back when I was a kid. The ""funk"" level was relatively low and the aftertaste was a bit short. Still a nice Gueuze that I can relatively easily, relative meaning a 2-hour drive into a foreign country!"
"This is miles away from the fruity crap this company puts out. Definitely worth sampling, and worth sitting on for a good long while if you can restrain yourself. Amazing."
"Drinkability/notes: A solid, credible example of the most royal of beers. Lambics are an acquired taste, to be sure, but a taste worth acquiring. If a beer style can be said to be transcendent, then it is the Lambic style."
"orange and foamy out of the bottle, not untypical for the style. tart and dry nose, some vinegar. slightly complex gueze but not terribly so -- only average. tastes of lambic funk, tart and dry with some acetic qualities. scrubbing bubbles in the mouth, fairly light body."
"Cloudy caramel with a white head that produced lots of lacing. Aromas of sour fruit, cidery apples, and yeast. The flavour mirrors the aroma, with a tart finish. There's a bit of citrus here as well. Everything melds very nicely. Medium to light bodied, moderate carbonation, and quite dry. Definitely a fine beer."
"Thanks Kevin!"
"I poured this 750ml corked and capped bottle into a champagne flute. It formed a 2"" white head over the clear, orangey-golden brew. Foamy head lasts well, and lacing is nice. Aroma is a piercing tartness with a woody-soil tinge to it. This one doesn't have the balance of the straight Lindemans Gueuze. Its flavor seems to focus on the tartness which overwhelms any of the more subtle notes. I drank part of it with a lime to cut the overwhelming tartness. I don't have a very sophisticated Lambic / Gueuze pallet and this may be my shortcoming but I did not like this particular Gueuze."
" The taste is well balanced between the malt, the citric sourness, and slight funk. Not as shocking to the palate as Cantillon. Lively mouthfeel from the carbonation, and insanely drinkable. Maybe a good introduction to the style for the uninitiated."
"Drinkability- Of the few Gueuze's I have had, this one ranks right up there with the best of them. Tasty and hit the spot."
"My first of this style, this poured a subdued golden hue with mild head and some lacing. Smell was very tart, sour and sweet, very intense aroma. Taste was very sour in front which puckers the lips and finishes with some mild fruity notes, for me the sourness just dominates the experience. I guess I'll just admit that being a freshmen BA my palate probably just isn't devoloped enough to appreciate this style yet. I plowed through a tulips worth of this one but I could't get anyone I was with to even try more than one sip. I can see the value in this beer however so I will definitely be revisiting it after perhaps a year or so."
"No freshness date carved nor fresh by so unknown vintage but guess young. Nice presentatation with forever lasting white head and a nice golden beercollor with not much haze. Nose is delicate giving good fresh horse sweet, dry fresh hay, delicatly dosed sourness and overal very fresh but landlike caracter. Taste is good also having a well dosed but not overdone sourness; grapefruit like, good dryness, horse sweaty, rough leather taste with tard bitterness. Yes this is a fine example of a geuze and easy accesable. Good and for geuze quiet high dosed carbonisation make it together with the plesant taste to great mouthfeel and a well drinkable real geuze; wonder how these 2 1994's in my cellar are doing."
"this is a good gueze but i think cantillon and others are certainly more deep, funky and complex. nonetheless, i can see this being a bit more widely appealing just because its not as funky and sour as some. this would make an amazing apperetif--dry, bubbly and not too overwhelming. just right to whet an appetite. Very champagne-like."
"If you like really dry wine, sour green apples, iced tea with no sugar and extra lemon, or ever thought of stuffing a whole lime in your corona, you might want to give this a try. Not an everyday beer!"
"A nice Belgian Sour beer. Smells tart and moderately sour. Slight fruity aromas behind, and a little yeasty. Looks mostly clear yellow with a slight wheat haze to it. Tastes have a good blend of barley and wheat malt flavors and textures with a complex citrus sourness and acidity. Very efforvescent to the toung. Pleasantly creamy and tart. Not astringent, just nicely tart. Finish is dry and champaign like. Aftertaste is moderately sweet and tart. Lingers for quite a while."
"No vintage on the bottle so I think it's the new packaging which means it's probably pretty fresh. Appearance is great. Clear copper with a very nice white head that won't go away in my champagne glass. Smell is very musty. A tiny bit of a rotten smell in there and you can tell it's very acidic. Taste is also very acidic and sour - definitely mouthpuckering. It has a very clean finish compared to the other lambics I've tried, which leaves me a little disappointed as I prefer the tartness to linger on the palate. The flavor seems a bit muted and doesn't quite have that zing that I've come to love. It's just a tad too watery for my tastes as well. Extremely refreshing though, and something I could drink all night long. Perhaps with some age this will develop."
"D-This is very well blended. The barnyard flavors add great complexity but are not in-your-face shocking. The tart sour notes are very nice and really add another nice layer to this beer. Much more character and flavor than any sparkling wine."
"This beer was consumed on the night of the birth of my daughter, which was on July 19, 2005."
"Opinion: I think that this is about as close to a perfect beer as any. This is really the only beer that I have tried from Lindemans that I would consider saying that about. Sure, their flavored Lambics are good, and world-class in their own right...but they are far too sweet for my palate. This one has some surprising sweetness in it, but it barely even coexists with the wholesome funky goodness of the wild fermentation. It is a bit hard for me to believe that this is what the Lindemans beers taste like before they add all of those syrups in."
"If you like this brew, I'd try the normal Gueuze, too!"
"Bottle: Poured a dirty yellowish color beer with a huge foamy head with excellent retention. Aroma of funky barnyard, wild sourness and Belgian yeast. Taste is sour (as expected) with some faint sweetness and some funky yeast. Acidity is well balance, which I appreciate and body is quite full. Overall this is a nice Gueuze remove from the sweet fruit lambic that they also produce."
"750 ml bottle, corked and capped and foil sealed. Some dating on cap, but in code."
"Interesting. Tartness is king in this, dominates the feel, but in a gentle, delicious way. Very sophisticated stuff, and, past the powerful tartness, especially approachable."
"Man, I love the shit out of Gueuze! Very nice beer."
"Thanks to Derek for sharing a glass of this world class ""Gooze""."
"Pours an earthy orange color with a tall white-tan head. Lots of clingy lace on the glass. There is a little nose, some sharp yeasty and citrus aromas. The taste: Wow! Immediately a sharp bitter, unripe citrus fruits, and a crisp strong sour flavor.. when this was described as ""sour"" I guessed that it would be a sluggish sourness.. this is not the case. The sourness is very neat and clean, an excellent addition to the mouthfeel. This beer would make a great aperitif for a wide range of foods, steak and potatoes or seafood dinner."
"A deepish shade of ginger brown, hazy in appearance. Good pop to the cork but the head settles quickly to a skim in an open chalice. Minimal lace in the first glass, better in the second. Aroma with a bit of yeastiness, slightly tart but with lots of pie apples in it. Body of this one is decent, carbonation lighter than some, but its there. Lightly challenging flavors, tart with unripe fruit, a sense of woodiness and rose petals. Not overpowering to start, actually pretty drinkable for style. Just at the end, the mouthfeel flattens and that kick in the butt more-sour-than-grapefruit seeds character makes itself known. Not a showdown Gueuze, but good in its pleasantly aged way."
"Drinkability: well, I had no trouble drinking the 750ml in a couple hours, though it did leave me with a mild headache. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable brew that went well with some sea salt and pepper crackers and Gouda."
"While I consider the straight Lindemans gueuze a beginners gueuze, this is what I would call an intermediate one. Nowhere close to a Cantillon, but much closer than the former. I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoy this beer."
"Poured out from the bottle to a Chimay glass a clear and golden with just a bit of a thick and cloudy head that swirled across beautifully. Wonderfully dark wine cellary scents, very vineous with tons of fresh pipe tobacco scents. Difficult for me to describe the body on this one... maybe medium... Give it a swirl and you can get some carb, but not too much, not obnoxious amounts, there is good feel to it, it has a good fit. Wow, this is good stuff! This is what I want when I order a gueuze!! You feel the tartness coming at you before it hits your tongue! Yum! Lemon juice and tart granny smith apples, deeply wonderfully vineous and semi-sour. This is just amazingly good and goes down so easily. I was so happy to see this one in the Dawson's fridge! Happiness!"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this bottle of 1994. Pours an orange color with a tall head that dies off quickly and leaves some lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very tart. Way sour and funky. The flavor is exactly the same as the nose. Hits you with a huge tart/sour punch at first, then continues to be sour. Acid abound. Not my style - I don't care for the puckering sour. It's very well made, but not my style."
"Pours a very pale copper color and makes a huge creamy white head. Smells like a musty old barnyard with some hints of citrus. Flavor is very tart with lemon and grapefruit. Very asstringent and light to medium bodied with a very dry acidic finish. A quite drinkable and tasty brew."
"Vintage 1994. This is my New Years beer. This one pours a slightly oranged yellow color with a 3 finger head that falls to a quarter inch over top of the beer. The nose is really sour, lots of tart and bits of lemony acid, but just sour is all about what it is. The flavor on this beer is just awesome. A huge tart and sour, wtih some lemon and acidy that almost puckers your mouth. Wow. I think this beer is awesome. Full of funk and all that goodness. The feel is nice light moderate, but right where it should be for the tart and sour. Very much an aquired taste, but I love it. For a hugely sour beer, this is really drinkable. I am going out to buy another bottle of this vintage tomorrow. Hot Damn."
"Easily the best beer of the Lindemans line, this is a fine example of a Gueuze, one of the most refreshing, yet also a beer worth savoring."
"1994 bottle cellared by a friend of mine in excellent conditons. The beer pours a glowing orange with a little head. The aroma is of dry white grapes or the cork from a merlot bottle. The flavor kicks you in the mouth. I am not a fan of very sour things, so this was not too appealing to me. Sour, sour, sour. Very citrusy and sour. There are also some woody notes, perhaps oak. Green apple peel, pear, and white grape juice flavors all fill the glass. This beer overall is excellently complex but I just don't like the intense sour flavor."
"Pours a deep gold with a champagne-like bone white head. Lots of tiny bubbles. Sour notes dominate, but a slight sweet peach aroma comes through on the nose. Mild berry tones noticable. Lots of sour black cherry dominates the palate. Dry, somewhat short finish. Amazing flavor upfront. Mild mustiness in the back. Dry, crisp effervescent mouthfeel. Quite refreshing. One of the few beers I could mistake for a champagne. My wife even thought it tasted like champagne, only more sour. A very good beer. I will try this one many times over. Try this one!!"
"I did not care for this beer. It poured a muddled peach color with a large white foamy head. The aromas were all sour, young grape, and herbal. The only thing I could taste was sour and tart. So much so that the back of my throat and gums felt like an explosion of some sour apple candy. Not even a hint of the tasty earthy, barnyard belgian yeasts I have come to admire and savor. The mouthfeel was overwhelmed by the desire to get this beer outof my mouth. Perhaps I simply do not appreciate this style, but if my description accurately describes what this beer is supposed to taste like, I will not purchase any more gueuze beers"
"How does one control the wild yeasts to this degree????"
"1994 issue. Opaque golden-amber. Honest 1cm foam lasts for a 10 yr old. Superb aged gueuze aroma. Funky horsey and barnyard flavors, citric fruits (grapefruit, lemon), a good dose of hay. Sniffing harder will inspire new words like sweat, cheese, earth, cork, wood... Tart funky cider taste, although there are good notes of pears and lemon juice. This tastes like a field under the sun. Acid (balsamic, citric, lactic), yet very malty gueuze. Somehow salty finish, very dry, moderately astringent, complex. Firm authoritarian thick body, nice lasting carbonation. Marvellous. A real pleasure to study."
"Champagne. Not boozy at all. Musty aroma, even barnyard. Light golden color. A moderate geuze sour-wise, not too aggressive on palate. 2003 edition, ageable for 3 more years. Pepper, fruit as in apples and other. Sweet and tart aftertaste. I had to even consider drinking this with mates, and so I did."
"1994 bottling, corked and capped. Cork was moist at the bottom, even after being upright for a significant period of time, which is a good sign. Poured a deep golden with bronze color with a pillowy white head into a traditional Belgian hexagonal tumbler. Intricate lacing left behind as the head subsides. Currant skin aroma, herbal, woody and some musty barnyard funk with an apparent acidity that is affirmed with the first sip. It's subtly sweet, followed with a fruity acidity like sour green apple and lime. Some of your more traditional lambic funk is pretty low, maybe due to the fact that it's 10 years old and had a significant time to mellow and meld flavors, but still a major role in this beer. It, overall, seems to be a little bit sweeter that other blended lambics I've tried, but a good gueuze, nonetheless. Very spritzy and well-carbonated, affirming and dry on the palate. Quenching like quinine in tonic water, and at 5%, I could drink this like it was tonic water."
"I had a Gueze years ago in Belgian and remember liking it just because it was a bit different and I liked the tradition of spontaneous fermentation. Back to the roots of beer so to speak. My, haven't we come a long way! Looking forward to trying more of this style."
"Sorry Lindeman's, just wasn't impressed."
"The beer as it separates from the 750ml green bottle set in the glass a beclouded golden amber color with a magisterial bright white head that is creamy in texture and as it erodes, the lace forms a solid and somewhat thick sheet to meld with the glass. Nose has a sweet and sour front, with a citrus crispness, fresh and clean to the senses, start is also somewhat sweet with the top light to moderate in its feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops pleasantly mild and the aftertaste tart and very dry, a great beer to have here in the desert especially now as its in the 110's and the humidity quite high."
"The best gueuze I have ever stumbled upon. If Lindemans filtered and sweetened lambics provide the bucks for this lambic, then I am all for it! Middle Aged Women: Keep buying the framboise!"
"This lambic is a bit tame compared to the other two I've tried, but it still has the funk. The nose was quite earthy, but not so Bretty, i.e. horsey, barnyard etc. Definately some, but I just got more of a dirt kind of smell, none of the real sharpness, but very rich, full, round type scents. Pretty sour beer, but not overwhelmingly so. Nice sour fruityness and very very dry. Still a touch of residual sweetness, but perhaps what little there is is just super obvious because the beer is so dry otherwise. I like this one pretty good, but I couldn't drink more than a glass or two per sitting."
"I am not that big of a fan of these kinds of beer. This one is a good representative though."
"Had a great opportunity to try the 1998 version thanks to the awesome Brian, at Merchant Du Vin. He picked my sample up at the brewery-thanks a mill!! The beer pours a nice orange honey color and serves up a good creamy beige head . The lace is moderate to good. Aromas are nicely sour with plenty of horseblanket and barnyard funk. The mouthfeel is creamy, refreshing, and very dry. Flavors are sour cream like-very tart while at the same time mellow and elegant. This is a complex gueze that has taken on a very winelike persona with age. Layers of flavor unfold as the beer finishes. Damn I love this style of beer, and thank Brian for the rare treat!"
"Pours a very slightly hazed brown amber with a solid head of whiteness. Sweet and sour yum. Certainly one of the best lambics available in new england. The acidic tart flavor is well done and leads to a good full mouth of brew. A super drinkable beer."
"Pours with a two-fingered white head that fades quickly and leaves barely a trace of lace. Medium carbonation. Light cloudy, amber color. Nose is cidery. Starts and finishes as a strong, tart cider flavor with absolutely no aftertaste. Light bodied. $11.59 for 750ml bottle."
"ng"
"1994 edition but the Sharp Edge manager told me that it was bottled back in 2000 must have been barrel aged for the six in between years. Appearance: Amber orange hue with an off white cream colored head leaves immensely detailed frivilous amounts of lacing, nice. Aroma: Tart cider like character with a woody cask ridden oak finish to it, excellent farmhouse wild notes very different from anyother Lindemann's product. Taste: Tart flowing character subtly sweet great puckering complex very acidic thick wild notes with a tones coming through from the barrel aging process a truly great tasting geuze. Mouthfeel: Effervescent medium bodied lambic, great stuff. Drinkability: Amazingly clean tartness swarms the senses yet with each sip it grows more and more satisfying adding to the addiction of the overall experience of tasting this brew."
"Sweet sour touch of horse blanket and berries in the nose. Large fluffy very carbonated white head on the pour. Sparkeling light gold color and look in the glass. Wonderful lace on the glass as well. Wow taste is sweet and coating upfront with a tangy puckering touch of berry (raspberry?). Nice balence in the sweet and sour notes. Unreal smooth silk mouth. The brew just slides down effortlessly. A nice treat. Worth seeking out... opens up as it warms. I need to cellar a few of these..."
"Poured a crystal clear orange with tons of little bubbles racing to the top. Thin but extremely bubbly white head that continually gave little explosions. Quite beautiful. Smell was quite acidic and musty but in a good way. The taste was very tarty and slightly sour. Sharp twangs of fruit continually came at me. The main flavor that I got reminded me of a granny smith apple. Yeast flavor was definitely present and it provided a base to this beer along with a very dry finish. Sourness increased the more I drank. I couldn't imagine drinking this fresh considering how acidic and sharp the flavors were now! Definitely adviseable to pair this with some cheese and crackers (jarlsberg and onion toasteds for me). Very good choice for a special occasions but I couldn't drink this too often."
"Thin bodied, dry and again tart. Not something I would turn to everyday, but an excellent beer."
"paid $8.99 for the 750ml 97 vintage."
"This is a deliciously intense brew, well worth the price every now and then, and never, ever boring."
"Pours a medium orange with a light golded tint with a grear fluffy head that just leaves incredable lacing,aroma is ctrius and some soapy aromas in there as well.Taste a little subdued for the flavor (wich is fine with me)still rather sour and dry some real ripe green apple flavors in there,did I pick up some nutiness in there ass well?Although not a huge fan of the style this beer deserves good marks well made and not overpowering."
"As I pop the cork, an immediate enticing sour aroma springs forth from the bottle. It pours a cloudy orangish red color and has an off white head. It is definitely carbonated but not superly so. The aroma is sour with citrus notes, a bit of musty character as well. This beer is very dry and sour throughout. There is a definite Brett character as well, reminds me of a musty-leathery something or other, though the Brett character is somewhat subdued compared to other I have sampled. This beer is not as complex as some of the other traditional Gueuzes, but it is proof that Lindemans can make something other than alco-pop if they wanted to."
"2001 Vintage. 750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep orange/brown color with two fingers of head. There is minimal lacing on this one. The smell is a little musty with some white grapes and lots of acidity. The taste starts very sour, very very sour, with a bit of a dry sherry finish. There is a slight metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. Due to the high acid content, I was not able to stomach too much of this one. Maybe I'll like Lindeman's sweeter gueuze better."
"In conclusion: I tasted nothing to sneer at, but nothing with which to declare the end of all gueuzes."
"Overall Impression: This might be a good ""starter geuze"" for someone who has never tried it. Sort of ease them into it. However, of the ones we tasted that evening, the Mort Subite Oude Geuze seemed a much more flavorful and balanced ""starter geuze""."
"Quite drinkable for a gueuze and very refreshing. One of Belgium's better gueuze lambics. Seek it out, especially older vintages if they can be found. If you thought Lindemans lambics were all sweet fruit bombs, think again. This is the real deal."
"2001 bottling. Presented in a gueuze tumbler, this really is a beautiful beer! Light golden with a very slight haze and a big foamy white head that settles quickly to a good level for drinking. Leaves a nice lace. The aroma is very mellow and complex. Barnyard and medicinal aromas mixed with a very tart and like a nondescript fruit with no sweetness whatsoever. Very interesting and nice. On the palate, it's massive acidic sourness packed into a light body. That feeling that your teeth are being eaten away, like when you bite into a lemon. Vinous in the front. Increasingly tart as it moves to the back. More of that nondescript fruitiness is abound. Even vegetable-like character is showing up. A little old, damp, and decaying wood character here and there with cork character showing up and adding some great complexity near the end. Finish is as dry as an Arizona riverbed. This is a great gueuze, and I can't wait for more! However, as complex as it is already, it really would benefit with more aging to bring out more. I'm going to try to get some 1994 bottles soon, then perhaps my ratings will be even higher. This is an amazing beer and an amazing style. Definitely best served at cellar temp. to bring out all of its subtleties."
"My first lambic, and I had no real idea what to expect. But I had the good fortune of drinking this unique brew along with a magnificant french chicken dinner. The lambic poured a slightly cloudy copper color with a modest white froth. The smell was more like wine really than beer, very fruity, and the taste was shall I say unusual: tart, lemony cranberry with just a hint of grassy malt. The initial tang gives way quickly, but the effervescense remains. I would not want to drink a whole lot of this stuff--couldn't afford to anyway--but what a complement to a fine dinner; better than champagne or wine as far as I'm concerned."
"This is a near perfect beer, but not for every beer drinker I am sure. Lambics are something of an esoteric mystery to me, but regardless I find them a style of infinite discovery. Lindemans poured a opaque golden color with a fairly descent sized head and plenty of small lace up and down. Smell was full of cranberry, grassy aroma, and a fair bit of CO2 escaping into my nose. The taste was crisp to the point of mouth puckering. There was tons of tart lemon bitterness, seltzer like carbonation, dusty as an attic and a dry assertive finish. Went perfectly with chicken and shallots cooked in a white wine cream sauce."
"The 1994 vintage was a bit more complex than the 2001 sample I had before."
"This beer is beautiful in its clarity. A light copper hue. A somewhat fizzy head to begin with turns into more of a creamy and lush looking coating in a minute. Aroma is lovely. Lemongrass, chalk, vinegar, must and tart raspberry. This is one mouth puckering lambic. The pucker quality really comes on after you swallow. As for other characteristics, I'd say this has quite a bit of acidity to it. Vinegar like. Sour apple like. And like lemon juice. There seems to be some grape like attributes as well. Maybe some grape skin. Tart raspberry comes to mind as well, although this beer is not fruity. There is a dryness present in this beer throughout. The tartness in this beer literally coats your whole mouth. Exactly what a good lambic should do."
"Still haven't found a gueuze as good as this one. (Aging is key, though, younger bottles have been nearly as good the one reviewed above)."
"Peach orange hue with a light haze. Covered by an off white, persistent, creamy head that trails wisps of lace. Waft of tart, woefully upripe berry hits the nose at first, then is superceded by lactic and acetic tartness derived from mixed acid enteric fermentation. As the beer breathes, pungent, yet rounding notes of wet horse and mild woody oak surface. Mellow yeast must and hints of cheesy, aged hop add additional depth in aroma. Just a touch shy of complete aromawise. Although assertively tart allaround in flavor, an unripe, yet bright raspberry-like note permeates throughout. A pronounced combination of sharp, acetic tartness and mellower, lactic acid along with subtle chalk overshadow any trace of residual sweetness, lending a bone dry feel. Notes of hay and cork emerge mid palate along with earthy must both from the suspended primary yeast and wild Brettanomyces character. Subtle, grainy hints of wheat struggle to emerge through the dominant tartness. Although bone dry in overall profile, the mouthfeel retains an elegant crisp smoothness, and is far from thin. Finishes slightly astringent, with lingering grapeskin tannin tinged tartness. Almost a beautiful beer. The trace roughness precludes greatness, but that may change with a few years of cellaring. Delicious. Bottled 2001."
"This is, for a man who loves a good sour ale, one of the elite beers. Simply fabulous. I've had this beer 3 or 4 times now, and this is the first time I haven't consumed the whole 750 mL bottle myself -- and this is only because this is the first time I've lived with another beer snob, my fiancee. Great beer in every respect."
"Pours a pale golden color with a nice somewhat rocky/chunky yet fizzy white head that retains nicely. Musty attic and basement with some slightly tart fruitiness as well with a bit of a grassy/hay undertone. Excellently sour and tart with lip puckering goodness that is very intense Plenty of farmish type tastes combine with the great tartness to make this an outstanding brew. Great crisp and dry mouthfeel with a relatively light medium body. I could drink this every day of the week and I probably would if I lived in Belgium."
"Notes: Simple but has depth, flavourful but not boisterous. This brew shows little aging flaws at all and perhaps could see another decade or two without turning as long as the cork holds up. I’ll be seeking more bottles ASAP. This would be a good brew to break a newbie to the world of lambics."
"Very interesting. Not an everyday beer, but more of a special treat when looking for something different. Very drinkable. Not as much of a trip as some gueuzes, but this is a winner."
"My faith in the 2002 was restored. It's just too young if you prefer what age can do to this beer - as I do. Witness the 1994: It was like drinking molten lemons that had been painstakingly spiced with thousands of Sumatran botanicals. Certainly a 5, 5, 5, 5, 5!"
"Man, this is Bloody Good. I never understand how Lindemans can churn out their normal filtered product at the detriment to this traditional Gueuze. An expensive purchase, a treat really for me - but well worth it. More culture than a Petri Dish, a truly Artisanal Beer, and up with the best of the Gueuze."
"Heavy/earthy stinky barnyard nose, also a bit of wood, citrus and grassyness. Insanely sour!!!!! Almost too sour, very mouth puckering acidity, lots of citrus, veryu dry yeast flavours, earthy, even refrshing,  insanely good!!!! Stay away from the sweetened lindemans stuff and stick to this!!!!"
