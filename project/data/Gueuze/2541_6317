4.5,4.9,,,,,,"Poured a gorgeous cloudy golden colored body with a fluffy, quarter finger white head that receded to ring of white leaving little lacing. Effervescent bubbles can be seen in the glass. Quite nice looking and very true to style. Scents of sour, acidic funk, with notes of green apple, raspberry, layered with earthy, yeasty funk, hay, honey, a touch of oak, and mild grapefruit and lemon aromas. Overall impression is of a nicely acidic and sour, funky geuze that is still balanced with fruit and honey aromas that provide depth. A very nice example of the style's aroma. Taste begins moderately sour, with flavors of sour apple, earthy, funky yeast flavors, hay and a bit of oak balanced with a subtle, honey-like sweetness. Sourness is moderate-high on the middle, with notes of earthy, funky wild yeast, grapefruit, hints of oak and lemon. Finish is moderate-high in sourness with notes of grapefruit, oak, lemon and earthy, funky yeast. Aftertaste is grapefruit, lemon, wheat malt and sour, earthy funk. Overall impression is of a moderately sour and acidic flavor profile with balancing fruit, oak and honey flavors contributing depth. A very nice example of a geuze flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light bodied and effervescent with a semi-drying, puckering, acidic feel. Very nice and quite true to style. Overall this is a nice example of a geuze. It is sour and acidic in aroma and flavor, yet balances these qualities with other notes as well. This is aided by the mouthfeel which is light and spritzy, but not watery. A very nice geuze and well worth trying.","Auraan","0"

I would say that I like this slightly more than cantillion classic because the funk profile of Girardin Gueuze is much better suited to my tastes; it is much more well rounded and balanced than Cantillion classic gueuze.","4DAloveofSTOUT","Aug 14, 2014"

Aroma of candi sugar and mint leaves, dry, dusty, light citrus. Flavor is funky like my gym socks. Whoah. Some lemon notes, dry oakiness, and some vanilla as well here. More chewy body than other gueuzes in the class that I've had, and low plus carbonation. Nice brew overall, and a bit of a change-up from the LP Gueuze earlier in the night.

I was joking with my wife that if I had brewed this and was trying for an ale or something and then it tasted like a gueuze, I might pour it all out and start over. However, once you have become acquainted with this style and the ""brett taste"" in general, I think you will become a life-long fan and take it as a blessing if ""The Brett fairy"" ever visits a fermenter of your home-brew. I would recommend this beer to any and all.","BeerDocT","May 11, 2014"

4.04,-5.8,4,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy golden yellow-amber with a thin, loose white head that dissipates down into a white halo without lacing. There appears to be ample carbonation without much visible sediment. The nose is mildly sour, non-skunky, with a very slight fruitiness reminiscent of tart cherries. The taste is just as mild mannered and drinkable as the nose packing in an initial malty, grainy sweetness, some back-end funk, and finishes with a semi-dry, tart, bitterness. This is certainly one of the most drinkable gueuzes I've had, and I'm liking how approachable and balanced this is compared to some of the funk-bomb gueuzes I'm used to drinking. Its mouthfeel is initially sweet, well carbonated, slightly funky and bitter in the finish. As the beer warms it packs in a bit more bitterness in the finish, which contributes to the beer's crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. I'm impressed with this $10/375mL shelf-gueuze over Hanssens and Tilquin alternatives and due to its superior drinkability. However, I'm not sure I'll try too hard to acquire more bottles (i.e. trade for more). If it were available in my area I'd gladly indulge.","ThePorterSorter","May 16, 2013"

The beer pours with a quarter-of-a-finger’s-width, creamy white head of tiny compact bubbles, and is replenished by a steady stream of bubbles coming from throughout the glass. The beer’s body is a cloudy haze of proteins and such, and the other side of the glass can only just barely be seen. On the nose, the beer smells properly barn-yardy, with touches of cherry fruit leather and salt. The funk is nice and dominant in the nose, and provides a nice spiced feeling to the nose, perhaps briefly suggesting peppers. Beneath the salty funk lies a nice citric smell, somewhere between lemons and grapefruits with a touch of pineapple thrown in. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet up front, and then quickly dries into bitter and savory flavors with a medium strength acidity washing through the mouth. In flavor, the beer begins as salty fruity, almost like a pineapple. The fruit flavors grow in the mouth and introduce barnyard, cherry fruit leather, and some nice herbal grassy flavors in the finish and aftertaste. The finish moves towards a funky lemon flavor and has a nice long length. The lemon lasts into the aftertaste, blending with the grassy herbal flavors to leave a pleasant taste in the mouth. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium in body and crisp with a nice snappy and rough carbonation that scrubs the tongue free of any of the more cloying funk flavors. The mouth is left clean except for a nice pool of acid neutralizing saliva. Overall, this is a great gueuze with proper depth and complexity. If anything, I would call it a bit subdued in flavor though. It has all of the right components, but is too muted. The grassy bitters are also a little too strong and hold back some of the other flavors in the beer. This beer is a nice solid gueuze overall, though, and definitely worthy of a try.","Maxwell","Apr 26, 2013"

Aromas of big tart apple, grape, lemon, pepper, grass, hay, leather, oak, clove, white wine vinegar, earth, funk, and earthy spiciness. Fantastic aromas with huge complexity and nice balance of fruity and spicy notes; a bit more spicy/earthy than most. Taste of big tart apple, grape, cherry, lemon, grass, hay, pepper, clove, oak, leather, white wine vinegar, earth, funk, and yeast spiciness. Fair amount of earthy and fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart light fruits, grass, hay, pepper, clove, oak, leather, earth, funk, light vinegar, and yeast spiciness on the finish for a bit. Fantastic balance and complexity of fruity, spicy, and wild yeast notes; near perfect balance of all flavors; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Acidity is also extremely well balanced and not overwhelming at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly syrupy, acidic, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Gueuze! Huge complexity and balance of all flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on.

It smells more like a Fantome saison than most gueuze out there. It's strange for a gueuze to lack acidity like this does but it has a great nose nonetheless. Uh oh, this is über sessionable. The flavors are light and citrusy. There is a lot of freshly squeezed orange, plenty of rhind, and light acidic tartness. It drinks perfectly. The funk levels in this one are minimal. This drinks perfectly for the style. It is light and very smooth. The drinkability on this one is through the roof! I could drink this by the liter.

Smell is definite brett funk, woody, musty, moldy but in a ""clean"" way if that makes sense. I also get an aroma like that of the closet that holds the bin that holds my daughter's diapers, not in a bad way, but kind of in the way that you like to smell your own fart. Some bright citric fruits behind the funk, lemon, lime, sour apple. Taste is sour, but not overpoweringly so, a nice soft lactic sourness...which is starting to turn a bit more acetic as it warms up. Just a touch of bitterness to balance it out. The funk on the palate is somewhat subdued as compared to the nose but it is still good. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, exactly what I would expect.

Mildly bitter with some biscuity-malt character compliments the slight citrus sour flavor. Mouthfeel is lighter and crisp. Overall, this is a very good Gueze.

Taste follows scent, put together nicely, a mild blend compared to some others in the style, the brett never over powers the palate and it doesnt become puckering, quite refreshing.

4.07,-5.1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The Girardin Gueuze was ultimately the more pleasant of the two. It begins dry and sweet, crisp with a great refreshment both from the light gravity and the awesome effervescence. The close and the aftertaste, however, are a total upheaval of everything you notice at the beginning. A yeasty, throat drying ripple grows from the back of your mouth and makes you feel like your throat is the culture for the brewer's next batch. I've never used ""medicinal"" in a positive way, but it's a useful way to describe such a unique, drying sensation. This particular beer was pretty costly at $12 for a ~300ml bottle. All the same, it was an awesome first for the style and an awesome beer overall. Would love to try this both a day after and a few years after bottling.","petacutlasaurus","Apr 18, 2011"

Im liking the nose on this, smelling like a typical gueuze but more well rounded. Not so much dank basement, more of a mix between musk, hay and some fruit. Taste blew me away, first sips were marvelous. A nice hit of sour apple, with some barnyard notes, lime, and some earthy hops in the fresh bottle. Quite sour on the tounge and swishing it around makes for best results. The sour stays a bit than fades, the feel is light bodied and the carb is spritzy.

5,16.6,5,5,5,5,5,"You may not think so, but this is an awesome beer for food pairing. Particular dishes can really bring out a whole other side to the Gueuze, and vise-versa. Try it with caprese for instance. The creaminess and milky flavor of the fresh mozzarella will play well with the acidity and sour tang of the beer. Also, the tomatoes and basil share similar flavors with the beer. Mussels and fries, grilled vegetables, and richly sauced cuts of meat will be nice pairings too. As for cheese, try Girardin Gueuze with Delice de Bourgogne. This is a triple-cream cow's milk cheese from the Burgundy region of France. The creaminess will go well with the sour acidity of the beer, much like how an acidic wine can cut through the fat of a creamy cheese.","KDeLibero","Mar 01, 2011"

4.4,2.6,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Pours a hazy golden yellow with some pure white foam that settles into a nice ring. The smell is not particularly strong and is definitely focused more on the musty, chalky, minerally, funky, at times cheesy aspects as opposed to straight in your face acidity. Slight amounts of green apple and lemon poking through but not fruit forward. The taste brings more tartness into the profile while maintaining a really good funky mustiness. Definite mineral component reminiscent of wet stone. Light acedic acid, definitely not overpowering, more cider like. Has almost a yeasty taste that I associate with saisons. Mild underripe green fruitiness that's slightly bitter, almost a stem-like or peel quality instead of a fleshy burst of flavor. Mouthfeel is a little flat for me but this beer is insanely drinkable, I could drink liters of it. Very refreshing and complex enough to keep it interesting but not overpoweringly sour. This bottle went quite quickly.","Dspohn","Feb 16, 2011"
4.55,6.1,5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a tulip glass. The head is big and foamy white. The color is a dull golden, very hazy and lots of carbonation rising to the top. Lacing is strong. The aroma is fruity, grassy, and old back of the closet dust. The taste is tart throughout. Hits the back of the tongue and makes you tweek a bit. Fresh yogurt comes to mind. Not as tart as some Cantillons I have had but strong. The body is light, but with heavy carbonation it made me feel fuller. A great example to enjoy a bottle at a time.","phishgator","Feb 13, 2011"

Mouthfeel is lively, slightly puckering, and finishes dry. Taking style into account on drinkability, this one goes down pretty easy. It's sour, but not ripping my mouth apart, so I could drink it easily. But a lambic of this quality should be enjoyed over a good amount of time.

After a few sips to acclimatize my palate to the bracing sour pucker I detect a flavor profile that while not the best, does the trick. Oaky tannins, souir grape, lactic, citric acid with a slight tannic pucker at the very back of the tongue after the liquid passes through. This is quite dry, yet leaves the mouth watering for another sip. The tannic back bite reminds me of when you eat the strongly bitter pith of a citrus fruit, minus the bittersweet reward of the sweet fruit.

Poured a semi-translucent tawny, orange-gold with a rocky, two inch bright white head that slowly receded, leaving cloud-like strands of lacing as it dissipated into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Wonderful nose - a hint of cork upfront, followed by some green apple skins, a suggestion of grapefruit and a faint, grassy/earthy quality. The smell alone has started my salivary glands. Taste follows nose; however, the grapefruit and acidity really comes out and masks the green apple suggested by the nose. Some cork and wood expresses itself at the finish. Moutfeel is light, with a carbonation level that falls just short of sparkling. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks and finishes semi-dry. A delicious and refreshing beer on a warm humid day. Not as sour as some Gueuze's that I've tried; however, delicious and extremely easy-drinking.

Nose is both funky and tart with musty yeasty notes and some citrus zip in the back of the aroma. Taste includes some puckering tartness upfront that blends through a very lemon-like citrusy body that finishes sour. As it warms, there are more notes of mustiness and funk. Faint lingerting taste of subtle fruit almost like apricots blended in with the funk and tartness. Light body with moderate carbonation. Very drinkable as my mouth salivates to take the next sip. The tartness of this gueze is potent enough to burn the back of the nose and throat yet strangely smooth for a gueze. Very subtle earthiness about this that suggests oak without coming straight forward or bold with the oak characteristics. Very good.","stakem","Apr 09, 2010"

Huge flavor to this one. Flavor is likewise - obviously stronger on the funky sourness, and a little milder on the fruits. A touch of cheese and white wine. Tasty brew, if you're feeling like a sour one. Body is busy with strong carbonation that highlights the tartness well.

Unfortunately, both the nose and taste were a rancid mixture of very sour apples and vinegar. Early on, I kept thinking maybe the sour would be followed by a sweet sensation, a la Flemish Sours, but instead, it just kept getting more sour and acidic.

The smell is sweet-tarts and garbage, apple and grape skins, sour tart, old moldy bread. A little bit of spice, some lemon peel, really nice. Though I doubt if I could distinguish it from some others in smell alone. The taste is much richer and more delicious than just sweet tarts, the sour candy like sweetness comes in first, but there's a big powerful bottom af bready, dry malt. There's a note of flowers, some lemon, spice, pepper, nice and yeasty too. I think the taste of the malt is the most distinctive factor, but I also taste strawberries (old ones), tart apple skins, and the dry sting of carbonation is very pleasant. The body is very light, as you would expect, and quite good. The drinkability is much better than you would expect from a wild ale. It keeps me going back forf mlore because its not all tart, dry, sour taste, low on the vinegary acidic tastes, there's something to be said for a malt presence and a nice fruitiness.","taylorhamrick","Nov 26, 2009"

4.75,10.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"I decided tonight would be a good night to have something sour. Girardin 1882 Gueuze has a glowing orange color to it, along with a small and fizzy white head that does not last very long. Smell is wonderfully funky and sour, with traces of fresh lemon juice, white wine, and some dry earth tones. Flavor really attacks the palate as soon as it enters with a big dose of sourness. Lemon is the dominant flavor, and unlike many gueuzes that end in sort of a dry way, this one stays juicy throughout. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, making it a very refreshing beer that would be ideal for a hot summer day. The sour flavors do not linger for too long, and it does not destroy the palate, so I don't see why one can't put back a few bottles of this in a sitting (I know I would like to).

Popped the cork and it let out a nice pop and audible hiss, so this one was defiantly still alive. Poured into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel that really made it shine. I could see why it is rated so high, as it is quite different then anything I had tried in the past. This was very much a great brew and something I would look forward to sipping on again.

The color is a nice orangey-brown-tan color that's cloudy. The smell is deep farmhouse sour flavors from horse blanket ;) to lemon and grapefruit. The taste is pretty mellow for a gueuze, a good blend. Not overpowering with sourness, but not mellow enough to let you forget you're drinking a gueuze. The mouthfeel is acidic, carbonated, and dry.

Taste is sour grapefruit up front with a bitter hop bite that has a grainy earth flavor. Bready yeast flavors emerge midway through and leave a similar aftertaste as well.

4.72,10,4,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Poured out of a 37,5 cl bottle in to a cantillon gueuze glass. It poured a really bubble head that disapated to a small thin lacy head within one min. . Murky golden orange color with lively carbonation. Smell light barnyard funk with a mild blue cheese aroma. Nice balance of dry vs tartness in the taste. Green apples acidity matched with a light lemon vingear backing. Mouth feel is dry but with a pretty light body. Its a very lovely gueuze because of its very balanced structure which helps this gueuze to be one of the more drinkable gueuze.","sfoley333","Oct 01, 2007"

Head fades gradually but slowly, with plenty of coating, slow-falling lace. Aroma is tart, with undercurrents of smokiness and light funk. Taste is also dominantly tart, but with fruity undertones, and somehow is not as acidic as some of the more intense gueuzes get (read: Cantillon). Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy for the style, and quite drinkable. Has that thirst-quenchingness going on as well. Nice well-rounded brew.","ppoitras","Sep 23, 2007"

Very effervescent, big frothy head and a golden, cloudy color that seems to be lit from within. The fruit in the nose is pronounced, with that trademark gueuze sourness foremost. The taste puckers your mouth. Sharp & acidic up front, a hint of fruit that darts past the tastebuds faster than you can identify it, then a sour that hits hard and stays late. Wow. Gueuze squared. I really like it but the sourness is so overpowering its hard to get past. The mouthfeel is sour. No wait, that's taste. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with a softness to it that is really nice. The drinkability? Sorry, the sourness just puts the brakes on more than one of these. I love gueze, and this is a great one. I just have to leave it at one.

This is definitely one of the funkier geuzes I've had in terms of aromas. The citric acidity is most prevalent, while Spanish moss, straw, and faint sharp cheese serve as more underlying themes. The acidity comes up front in the flavor as well, shooting up to the nostrils and reminding me of sour Pop Rocks. I'm pretty surprised by the amount of mellow vanilla from the wood despite the funk. Finishes rather astringent, with a tangerine flavor that lingers on. I would prefer this to be a little more active on the tongue. The body is just fine: not too light bodied.

A shallow pour, elicits furtive and bright carbonation, gassing the most piquant and lively tones of musky grape skins, cob-webbed attic planks, long grassy warm days and a sweeping sharp bite of acidic splendor. Faint washed-rind cheese lactic blend with lightly soured apple juice and a passionfruit. Nice. In the glass, a lightly hazed orange-tinted gold, with a soft, soapy head of white. On the tongue, its alive with bold, bowling acidity, bright, clear and clean. Quiet tones of wheat sugars whisper through the veil of bold soured candies. Musty pig barns and scattered straw elicit a note of farms and apples. Out among the earthy glow is a vibrant bowl of fresh wet cranberries, puckering the corners of my mouth. So, fresh and delicate. A wisp of flowery perfume fills the humors, percolating the dying hop dryness. Beautiful all around.","CharlesDarwin","Feb 17, 2007"

Nice funky aroma, with notes of lemony citrus, hay, and spice, with an underlying musty quality. Acidic tartness is dominant throughout, with a balancing sweetness and lemon/grapefruit citrus flavour. It's quite fruity too - grapes, kind of like white wine. There's some earthy funk here too, but it's not as prominant as in the aroma. Drying tartness lingers forever in the finish and there's a bit of a medicinal/herbal flavour that hits after it's been swallowed. Medium bodied with generous, spritzy carbonation. Very dry.

The initial head is quite sizeable, on account of its lively carbonation, but things soon calm down. The aroma is light and airy, showing tart fruits along with that signature Gueuze funkiness. It's not as heavily musty as some other examples, really, instead going for a sharper, fresher profile. Big-time sourness instantly grips the palate and begins to pucker the tongue and pretty much the whole mouth. The eyelids spasm and shut instinctively. Flavors of tart fruit, cider, and yeasty funkiness are also in the mix. The intense sour acidity of Gueuze Girardin seems to either subside in time or one becomes aclimated to it.

Very tart; puckeringly sour. Lemon juice and grapefruit acid. But waittheres more to this after the bracing sourness. Floral and light fruit notes, along with wisps of wheat malt slip in.

The finish is again musty and funky, but dry and slightly acidic. It walks through such an amazingly distinct range of flavors that even if you dont like what you taste it is hard not to be impressed. That amount of distinct flavor ranges in a beer is rare.

I wouldn't care if it was bright purple...it's one of the best, if not the best lambic I've had. Poured into a goblet and the whole room smells like band-aid, baby skin, sandlewood, girl-parts, faint clove-honey and not a single trace of hop. The mouthfeel is wine like and low carbonation almost like the unblended Cantillon. You don't need to be paying attention to get bowled over by a rush of floral sour but a attentive drinker will thrill to the most complex aftertaste I know that develops on your tongue for well over a minute. Pears strained through suede, green grapes, sweet rice, tallegio cheese are the main tastes I can verbalize. This is a lambic poseur-disposer as the high funk and tart factors will repel the uninitiated. I ate dates wrapped in bacon with this and it balances with the salty sweetness so well I almost wept. Those that find most fruit lambics cloying and crave the most complex - this is it. This is an elite beer for an experienced lambic drinker and once you've had this...only the top flight geuze will scratch your lambic itches. Track it down...share it only with those in the know and don't feel too freaky if you also don't mind it spraying all over your face.

4.97,15.9,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Surprisingly dark golden yellow pour, moderately hazy, almost orangey. Amazingly balanced aroma. Huge sweet malt kiss complements the character loaded brettanomyces that come out horsey, cheesy and sweaty. Funky and clean at the same time, but above all elegant and farmy. Apparently sweet which have me anticipating a dessert gueuze. Notes of vanilla, cask wood, sand, earth. Indeed very sweet for a gueuze, this is not really what I was anticipating, but I can appreciate greatness when I taste it and this is just as good as Cuvée René with incredible nostalgic character. Pie crust and bread. Not very acid at all, just a balancing tartness. Honeyed maltiness gets overwhelmed by wood juice, powdery glue-like flavors. I dont really feels the taste was as good as the incredible aroma, but it does grow on me as it warms. It just has this terrific sandy dry-out effect that asks to be let on the table taking some air and breathing like fine wines. Gentle astringency, fitting low carbonation. Medium-full bodied and smooth on the tongue. One of the best in its kind and worthy of every bit of praise it gathers. Complex beyond imagination all while being insanely drinkable. Thanks again Per. <br> A further sampling confirms to me that the real girardin gueuze outclasses cuvée rené by a fair margin as my favorite gueuze. Highly drinkable yet very assertive. It just does everything as I want it and for now stands as the best Ive had, though some of those rare drie fonteinen look like they could stand up to its level.","Rastacouere","Aug 24, 2005"

I really loved every aspect of it. Not only is it incredibly flavorsome and extremely complex it is exceedingly refreshing! What a great summery beer. It is low in alcohol as well. But dont misunderstand me; this beer would be great anytime, anywhere. If you want a great Guezue I suggest Girardin. Damn near total perfection. Highly Recommended.","bditty187","May 20, 2005"

I guess grapes is the closest. A little spicy too. I've heard War Heads candy used to describe the taste of a gueuze before, but it never seemed quite right until I tried this gueuze. This definitely makes the cheeks pucker a bit. But as others have described, it's quite drinkable. I find it very difficult to put my glass down. I would have liked the mouthfeel to be a little fuller. This beer doesn't coat the mouth and leave behind a barnyard flavor the way some other gueuzes. On the other hand, unlike some gueuzes, I wish I could drink this every day. This is a great beer.","beveragecaptain","Beers"

At first I thought something was wrong because it was so sour, but the bartender explained to me that its how it should be. Definitely not a beer you can drink fast, only sip slow. I can see the craft in it, but as for something that I would have on a regular basis I don't know... I guess that any fan of beer who wants to try something totally new would be into this.","Toddv29424","Mar 06, 2005"
4.08,-4.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"33 ml. bottle. Extremely cloudy yellow-orange, with retaining thin head around the rim, and noticeable lace. Aroma of cider and bleach. Initial taste of rounded softened apple juice sourness. Cannot be drunk quickly, only sipped. Sour vinegar and acid leads to tongue freezing, mouth puckering, and jaw fatigue that was tolerable and long lasting. Aftertaste was a medicinal drying,unresolved for hours by water. Medium in texture on the mouth. Thanks Clarkevv. This is not my preferred style, and I am striving to rate it within its style.","Sammy","Feb 23, 2005"
4.43,3.3,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a somewhat hazy deep orange color with amber hues and a beautiful light white head that just leaves a tickle of a lace. Aromas are a mix of spiced tart apples along with some black pepper and some fun loving barnyard and earthy grass tones. Initially this brew starts off with tart apple and pear notes with a zinging carbonation that dances all around on my pallate. Following there are hints of spices, specifically pepper, with some strong acidic and citric notes. The finish is nicely sour and tart, with firm catty tones are a slightly dry end. Overall this is definetly one of the kings of gueuzes and I will definetly be seeking out more of this whenever I can.","bigbeerdrinka","Feb 22, 2005"

4.43,3.3,4.5,4,5,4,4,"Easily the best gueuze Ive had. The beer pours a beautiful pinkish amber verging on copper with a moderate, but dense, white head. The aroma is very fruity -- underripe peaches and apricots, horse blanket musty. The flavor is definitely sour, it comes across as salty by somehow activating those sensors on the tongue, but the saltiness turns into a puckering tartness on the back of the tongue. The tartness doesnt overwhelm the rest of the beer, though as gree peach/apricot fruit mingles with a slight bit of sweetened toast malt. All of these flavors meld wonderfully into a complex and tasty lambic. Easier to drink than I expected, actually.","aracauna","Nov 13, 2004"
