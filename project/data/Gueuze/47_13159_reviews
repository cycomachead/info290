"Overall I thought this was a good beer and good example of the style, the more I try this style, the more I start to understand what sets this style apart and as far as I can tell this has just about everything that a good Geuze should have and I enjoyed it.  This beer has good drinkability, it's smooth, not too acidic, very crisp, a little prickly, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, the whole bottle might be a little too much for me so I think one glass is the perfect amount.  What I like the most about this beer is the sourness, it's right where I want it for the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the slight skunky aspect, I wish they wouldn't use green bottles.  I would buy this beer again and I would be nice to keep a bottle or two around in the cellar, I think it would be a nice summer beer and it might even be a little refreshing.  I would recommend this beer, especially if your into the style or sour beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it took me a few yeasrs and a couple tries to warm up to it, but now i can say I enjoy it and I like to seek out more in the style.  This beer made for a good first impression and I would really like to try more beers from this brewery, as far as I can tell it's an above average example of the style.  Good job guys, this is a tasty Geuze. keep up the hard work."

"The lingering sweetness is a bit of a drawback, but the acidity is quite nice. Probably a safe bet among the less exciting gueuzes."
""
""
""
"First time trying this style of beer, not my kind of thing. Probably a very good example of it style though, no off flavours."
"Nice clean simple sour! No special flavors but also no off flavors."
"O - This is a very satisfying Geuze. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable. Very nice."
"Pours hazy light Amber in color with a big fuzzy white head. Smell has some peppery yeast notes, straw, and grainy malt. Light funky acidic lacto sour flavor follows with lemon peel and slight vinegar notes. Mouthfeel is light bodied highly carbonated and crisp."
""
""
""
"overall:  pretty tame but pleasant Geuze."
"This one was a really excellent gueuze style lambic, it had tonnes of flavour and sourness but held a good balance and proved an easy one to drink. I'm kicking myself for only buying a 250ml bottle when larger ones were available but I guess that just means I'll need to pick this one up again at some point."
""
"Overall: Must buy more Geuze! I'm actually going to use the bottle dregs to propagate a colony of bacteria for my house sours. I love what Frank Boon is doing over there. I originally reviewed his regular Boon Geuze with an under developed palate. This is a must try for all craft beer lovers looking for something off the beaten path. Long live sour beers."

""
"Pours a orange body with one finger head and no lace with a tart, acidic aroma with touches of funk and oak.  The fruit flavors in this beer come across as white grape and pear, basically, there are little bits of sweetness balanced with a funky, almost sour, tart dryness that leaves a crisp finish.  The oak/wood keeps beer smooth and pleasant overall the balance in this beer makes it quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Light on the funk, tart, and flavor complexities, but a great introduction to the style."
"Tart, no sweetness, slight funk, direct, highly drinkable. One of my all time favorite sours. Sad it's not more widely available."

"O - The fruit here is bright citric, lemons and such.  This is a rock solid example of the gueuze, a blended lambic that focuses on the funk and sour elements that sometimes are backgrounded in the more friendly standard lambics.  An approachable, relatively balanced example."

"Poured a lovely cloudy golden body with a thin ring of white head. The body looks fantastic, though it could do with more head. Scents of wild, barnyard Brett funk, with notes of hay and lemon juice layered atop aromas of grapefruit peel and indeterminate citrus fruit. mild oak, apple, honey. Overall impression is of a modestly sour Geuze aroma mingling wonderfully with the other aromas common to the style. Quite nice and very true to form. Taste begins modestly sour with notes of sour yeasty funk, lemon, grapefruit. tangy wheat, a light character of oak and a low level of hop bitterness. This moves into a moderately sour middle with notes of lemon, apple, green apple, light honey and a light presence of oak. Finish is medium-dry with notes of honey, lemon, grapefruit, a hint of pale malt and yeasty wild funk. Aftertaste is moderately sour with notes of yeasty wild funk, spicy yeast phenols, mild grainy malt and a bit of grapefruit. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely sour, well-balanced Geuze that is a good showcase of the typical flavors of the style. Quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is light bodied, puckering and somewhat drying with high, effervescent carbonation. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a light, spritzy, but not watery feel. Very true to style and quite pleasant. Overall this is a fine Geuze. It is not the best example of the style, but it is true to form, pleasant in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel and as a result is quite pleasant to drink. I recommend it to those wanting to try a fairly good example of a Geuze."

"Overall it's a good well balanced drink that doesn't try and take the sour to the max."

"Floral, slightly funky brett aroma, with a fairly sour, lactic and acetic finish."

"one of the better traditional Belgian examples of the style I think, and one of the primary reasons for that is its balance. not just a lactic acidity sour bomb, this has a ton of flavor and nuance to go with the sour. the malt also seems to be a bit darker than others, less yellow more amber, which gives some meat to it. alcohol is also a bit higher than others, an indication of its dryness and ""doneness"" in the yeast sense. hazy with fish food flakes of brick red yeast floating around and finally settling under an airy white head. the nose smells as woody as it does sour, very mature, with plenty of funky yeast weirdness in addition to the lacto of the lambic. the blend is nice too, a proper mix of old and young with just enough sourness to fit the style but not so much that I don't want to drink my whole bottle. I love the fuller body and all the carbonation. a lot of these come across still, this appears to be bottle conditioned which gives it a lot of life. less traditional to some, but I really do prefer it personally. oak and dusty malt meet where the sourness really kicks in, and it warms up well, driving the sourness up a bit more. on par with any of the blended lambics from Belgium I think, and the price point is awesome."

"O-very nice gueze for the price will pick this up again"
"Pours from the bottle with a cloudy golden yellow-orange color and is topped by a massive, pillowy eggshell-white head. The aroma is a lively combination of apple cider, vinegar, and damp earth. The flavor is likewise acidic yet earthy, with components of tart white grape juice, sour green apples, and a light woodiness. The lively, sharp, fine carbonation accents the acidicy, and yet this beer is surprisingly palate-coating. Overall, this beer reminds me more of a tart white wine, but in a most intriguing way."

"O. A staple - very good. Sour and neutral oak, as it should. This is very consistent between metrics. This is certainly recommended to sour fans."
"Big and Belgian, that's how I like them. Not in a gay way. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Just sayin'. It pours cloudy gold with a soapy white head that shows no sign of letting up before I'm ready to go further. It smells of oranges, peppermint, hay, and a barn. A particular one, not just any one. But I will keep the location secret. Just to be that way. The taste is sour cherries, grass, and a nice bready finish. This is a phenomenally balanced flavor. Not too sour, not too sweet, not too dry. It is the goldilocks of geuze. If they start putting that on the label, I get credit. The mouthfeel is soft, slightly tingly, and light. Overall, I really feel this is a fantastic beer. It may be the best I've had. Nice, nice job."

"O: A nice lambic for the price but strangely haven't seen this around as much as other more sought after geuzes. I guess that kinda makes sense but a little variety never hurts for perspective. A nice beer that is worth trying and seeking."

"Bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. Poured brilliant dandelion yellow with a slight tangerine hue. Frothy white head that left several patches of lacing. Wonderful aromas of citrus tartness, touch of leather, big earthy tones. Like walking through a deciduous forest after a fresh spring rain and you come upon a rotting log with mushrooms growing on it. Very delicate, yet powerful flavors. Very smooth carbonation giving a lively feel to the light body. Delicious."

"Overall the beer was quite an experience. At taste and smell I was fearful I wouldn't like it, but like all great things, it grew on me as I sipped it, and maybe as it opened up a bit."

"Pours a hazy straw orange-yellow with mayhaps an inch of fizzy white head that fizzled out before I could finish typing this sentence. Opaque body sans carbonation. Nose is nice. Not mind-blowing but not repulsive. I'm warming up quickly to the style. Grapefruit is the dominant player here, with assorted citrus in the mix. Lemons, apples, barnyard funk. Supremely sour on both the nose and the palate, though not as acidic as other brews in this vein. Actually somewhat sweet at the tip of the tongue, with bread and apple candy. The sourness doesn't quite have the flavor or the potency I crave, but it's a nicely rounded beer."

"Pours cloudy gold with a four-finger white head that retains well. The nose is straw, lemon, dank, earthy yeast funk, and candied sugar. The taste gives some straw and candied sugar up front before becoming a sour lemon bomb. It's like you're drinking a Warhead. The body is light and watery with high carbonation, and it finishes dry. Not interesting enough to warrant the price."
""
""
"Also had the 2011-2012 and had it written down as ""rough and rugged", this was even more. Fortunately my type of gueuze."
"Overall - For the price point, this is an excellent Gueuze. Very clean, very balanced and refreshing. Quality ingredients and a ripe blast of flavor. Recommend this guy. Tasty!"

"A duly balanced, rather easy-drinking (relatively, of course) gueuze. The acid, funk, malt, fruity yeast, wood, and well, alcohol, I'm guessing, all work together splendidly in making that happen. Very nice stuff, but I fear that the lack of overt zippiness will be a cross to bear for certain sour fans out there."
"Overall, a very refreshing and pleasant geuze."
""
""
""
"D) Seems pretty average; nothing great going on, but it's hardly riddled with issues."
""
"O: An excellent example of a gueuze. Very well made and very drinkable."
""
""
"I just came off Zwanze day from Cantillon and trying this is a big change. It's different and alright but it's not doing much for me compared to other lambic/gueuze's I've had."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pretty good gueuze and decently priced. Worth a a try if you've never had it, but there are much better options out there, including several in the same (or lower) price range."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Like all beers in this style, I think it is more of an acquired taste (and one that I have a real thirst for). I enjoyed this beer and found it quite refreshing though there is more than a slight amount of puckering sourness/tartness and a smell that could be off-putting if you are not used to the style. Delicious but I just wish it was a little more affordable to make it a more frequent beer for me."
""
""
""

"Overall a very enjoyable geuze that i'd have again. There are some better ones, but this one has enough complexity and yeasty funk that i'll return to it again in the future. If i'm able to choose between this and boon mariage parfait though, i go mariage parfait all day."
""
"Overall: A nicely balanced gueuze. Refreshing, light, tasty. An above average representation of the style, but not without flaws."
"Overall Impression: Definitely a distinct taste from the Lambic style brewing process, this beer exhibits strong sour apple and pineapple notes while still remaining very drinkable and refreshing."
""
"OVERALL: A nice blended Lambic, making for a fine Oude Geuze. Bright flavors, and a bit young. Best by date 02-02-2031. Bottle stated this vintage was 7.0% abv."
"Overall (4.25/5): Boon Oude Geuze is a quality beer that is one of the more affordable offerings in the geuze style category. Recommended for summer drinking especially...forget that light lager, wheat beer, session pale ale stuff. Get down with the geuze!"
""
""
""
""
" The taste is tart from the onset -yeast forward with acidic almost more than any readily available gueuze I can remember in Belgium or the U.S. for that matter. The taste of the wood with the sour yeast brings a sort of tannic element to the light dry body with an alcohol flavor that is noticeable and becomes almost spicy but not sharp to the extent of not being enjoyable. Enjoyment and flavor converge this is stronger than your average Gueuze but to me does not lack flavor in any sense it is perhaps not as subtle as some but every bit as good and worth seeking out..perhaps a good candidate for cellaring based on the slightly higher abv -either way it is drinkable and very flavorful."

"O - A pleasant enough gueuze, especially for the money. $10 for a 750ml? It may not be the best out there but I will gladly pay that much for a quality gueuze such as this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a very pale amber color that is clear with a bubbly, white head. The aroma is a mixture of sweetness mixed with complex yeast strains. The taste is mixture of sweet, tart, and acidic. There is some oak in the flavor but I expected a little more for being aged 2 years in oak. Finishes with a lingering sweet/tart after taste. Not too bad, but there are certainly other geuze beers on the market that I like better."

"Quite a great beer and underrated I think. Good balance. Not groundbreaking, but definitely one of the best bargain gueuzes out there, usually easy to find as well."

"This is one of those beers that I'm really glad I've had, but probably won't drink again. I love the sour beers, and I love some funky barnyard notes. But, I also need that balanced with a little bit of fruit. This beer is as barnyard as I've ever tasted, without any fruit or floral notes. Exceptional in what it is, but not for me."
""
"O - Very good. I'm a sour Noob, but I love this stuff. Very slow sipping beer to enjoy and contemplate. Great accompaniment to reading or intellectual conversation."

"The beer pours a murky yellow with a huge fluffy white head with varying size bubbles. Lacing was far too slick to really be of note. The beer’s body is cloudy and opaque, and I did find some chunks in the end of the beer (obviously…). On the nose the beer smells spritsy and fierce with lemon grass funk and cherry fruit leather playing with each other in complex layers. As it warms there is more barnyard in the smell with “horse blanket” notes alongside grassier whiffs. On the tongue, the beer tastes funky and fresh, with earthy cheese notes playing beside lemon grass citrus and some lovely barnyard funk which builds further in the mouth as the beer warms. The beer opens with sour lemon, moving into the hugely complex middle with barnyard, light fruit leather cherry, and big lemon grass citrus notes. The barnyard closes with lovely earthy cheese notes, while the aftertaste of sour lemon grass lingers in the mouth for quite a while. This beer tastes properly complex for a gueuze. On the mouth, the beer feels light and spritsy, with a little effervescence coming from the fierce carbonation. The mouth is left rather clean, with the faintest touch of dryness on the back of the tongue. Overall, this is another great gueuze. It takes time for it to warm into big complex flavors, but it brings some lovely citrus notes, and great sprits to the beer. It’s not my favorite in the style, but it is far from my least favorite. I’ll be aging a bottle for a year or so to see how the funk develops in the bottle, as I feel it could grow a little in complexity. This is a great complex beer for a good price point. Try this beer."
"Good well made beer. Not a sour expert yet, nor complete convert but this is good."
""
"OVERALL: Not for me. This one is too musty and funky for my tastes, and the added sweetness doesn't seem to help the situation either. This one is everywhere around here, so it's a bit of a shame that I like their Mariage Parfait exponentially better. Win some and lose some I guess."
""
""
""
"O- As already said, a very enjoyable gueuze. Not super complex, just a perfectly balanced and refreshing example of the style. Nice as an entrypoint to the world of lambic"
""
""
""
""
""
"Once I managed to get some beer into my glass it appeared a hazy, golden straw yellow with a dense foamy white head. The quarter inch of fluffy head sits comfortably throughout drinking and leaves some streaky lacing behind (as expected). However, the nose is sweeter than expected and reminiscent of white grapes and fruity yeast esters. The nose is also tart and slightly reminiscent of stomach acid. In comparison to a cantillon, this geuze is on the mild side. It drinks very easily with a bit of dank culture that resides on my palate long after each sip. It's semi-dry, vinous and the alcohol is quite well masked. Not much to complain about with this beer, except it needs more funk and sourness."
"Overall: Sufferable. I realize that the blending process makes it alot harder to make something palatable, but (and with that in mind) it's still a beer that lacks the complexity and elegance necessary to break into the 4 mark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I have heard that this beer is an acquired taste, and I don't think I've fully acquired it yet, but for style, it is a very intense lambic and is very sour and tart. Still, an interesting experience but I think one per night is enough. Perhaps another time I'll revisit this style and see if I feel differently about it."
""
"Flavor-wise, I enjoyed this beer and think it is excellent. My main gripe with it is the low carbonation. I think higher carbonation would open up the palate a bit more and complement the flavor nicely. Moreover, the sourness seems a bit one-dimensional (fruit). I don't have a lot of experience with this style, but I would like to try a gueuze with a bit more complexity."

"An okay gueuze, but not my favorite. Generally dull, without much sour or depth, and dominated by the wrong flavors, IMO."

"375ml corked and caged bottle served in my ST tulip. 24-06-2030 indicated on the back label. Pours a light, golden-orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a three inch bright white head that sizzles and pops and quickly disperses within seconds on the pour. Head eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch cap. Some lacing is present, but there's no adhesion. Nose reveals citrus zest, vinegar notes, cork and tart light stone fruit. Taste follows nose; however, considerably less tart and sour than suggested by the nose. There's also a slight cardboard taste in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, palate cleansing carbonation as well as a slight acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Overall, a decent and accessible gueuze, but nothing overly spectacular. I'd go with Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René or Hanssens Oude Gueuze over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, bubbly yellow with a thick head. The aroma is of lemons with a hint of sour grapes and a yeast mustiness. The flavor is purely sour grapes and nothing else. It's mouthfeel is light and fizzy, champagne like. Boon Oude Geuze is a good example of the style, just not for me. Not recommended!"
"So...my first Gueuze...’bout damned time. I’ve had a few other Sours, but not a lot to compare to score-wise. I hear this is supposed to be a more mid-range Gueuze, yet I found this to be rather tart and sour and pretty good overall. Definitely has me wanting to try others in the style."
""
"Perfect amount of sourness and funk and clean finish. A very nice beer that I can't wait to have agains."
""
"375ml bottle. Timmermans Flute glass. Enjoyed on sep´11. Bright gold in color. Off-white, thin layer crown with good retention. Gentle aromas of cut grass, subtle fermented cheese & woody notes. Sour flavor at first sip, slightly sweet malt follows.Funny sparkling palate. Rough sensation in the middle, fruity –granny Smith´s apples, pears & quince-. Medium body, high carbonation. Dry astringent fruity finish & aftertaste. Very refreshing."
""
"Beer is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, foaming this up across the palate and presenting a generally smooth, flowing mouthfeel. Unless the sediment is added, beer is somewhat watery around the edges. Surprisingly high in ethanol given the lightness and slight wateriness of the beer. Close is substantially dry with a light stickiness, both from residual sugars."
""
"Best before 9-16-2030. Served from bottle into a Drie Fonteinen ‘3 Fountain’ gueuze glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a fizzy one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, tart, sour, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, tart, sour, funk, orange rine, citrus, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. All of the right flavors and aromas for this style were present in this one. This made it a really nice example of the style and definitely kept me on my toes while exploring this one. The mouthfeel on this one was pretty nice as it was a little more bubbly than some others in this style I’ve had and definitely took it up a notch. Definitely an absolute must try for any true fan of the style."
"Pours a hazy golden yellow / light orange. Nose is barnyard funk mixed in with a lot of green apples and some citrus. Taste starts with acidic citrus that fades to some mildew funk. This overtaken by tart green apples and surisingly some booze. Ends pretty dry with boozy acidic flavors. Overall this is a decent geuze. It wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't pass on it either."
"O- Not the best example of a Gueuze, but I wouldn't say I hate it. maybe the best way to describe it would be a Beginner's Gueuze. it has it's perks, but just isn't sour enough for my liking."
"375 ml bottle into tulip, best by 9/16/2030. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a fluffy 2 finger white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big tart apple, cherry, lemon, hay, grass, pepper, oak, light vinegar, funk, and yeast spices. Very nice and balanced aromas, with great complexity. Taste of tart apple, cherry, lemon, grass, hay, pepper, slight vinegar, and yeast spices. Fairly tart and spicy on the finish; with lingering notes of apple, lemon, cherry, pepper, grass, and spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance of flavors with acidity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly crisp and acidic mouthfeel as expected. No alcohol presence noticed at all. Overall this is a great gueuze. Very nice flavor complexity and balance."
""
""
""
"Overall: To be honest, this was my first experience with this style and I cannot say I am a fan; I do not handle the sourness well. Having said that, it was a nice change of pace and it does seem to possess all of the characteristics associated with the style."
"O- a nice change up from what I usually drink. I've had far better geuzes before, but it is still quite nice."
"Overall. Nice dry gueuze. I'll drink it again."
""
"A nice easily accessible geuze."
"EDIT: I actually finished the review, then had to come back and increase the score for the taste. The metallic flavor fades drastically as the beer warms, making it much more enjoyable."
""
"Overall - Not an impressive gueuze. Bad gueuzes are vinegary, which this one at least isn't, but it's too tame in the good flavors and that metallic oxidation is a deal-breaker."
"Overall, this was a nice beer, but I think I'd opt for other gueuzes in the future due to the price range of this. It delivers for sure in the quality of the brew, but a bit more noticeable complexity would have been nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good citric flavors with a bit of funk, could have used more aroma. An okay gueuze, glad I finally got to try this but I think I'll stick with Girardin and Drie Fonteinen for mine."
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a really nice geuze. I thought the nose here was outstanding, just super funky and tart. The taste is pretty tart too, though not quite as funky. A great beer I'll certainly look to have again."
""
""
"A very bold and flavorful brew. Definitely worth a try."
"Very nicely done benchmark quality Gueze."
"So glad to have tried this."
""
""
"An outstanding, balanced gueuze that I really enjoy. The funky, heady aroma let you know you in for a real treat and flavors aren’t overly aggressive but a bit of barnyard funk and defiantly sour."
"o- awesome beer. i would definitely buy again (maybe not at the brick store price, lol). i'm very glad i got the chance to try it."
"This was a nice Gueuze but there are certainly others that I enjoy more, at better price points. I've wanted to try this for a while now and I'm glad I did, but again there are others I'd go for first."
""
"O: This beer is quite tasty, but I think it needs a bit more age. The funkiness was not as pronounced as I would have liked; however, that is just because it is young. Should get better considerably better with age as even the immature version is quite tasty!"
"O: it was a nice one, great taste, smell was spot on, im falling in love with lambics and thus, geuze, such a complex style"
"O- The secent, appearance and mouthfeel were good but the taste was a little off. It had the good aspects of geuze's but the shrimp taste I got kinda ruined it. The taste had some good to it, but another bottle or maybe some more time may have turned out better, but this happened to be for this particular review."
""
""
""
"My first queze so I don't hnow what to expect or if this is even a good beer. Certainly going to need a few more from different breweries and a bit of homework to properly gage this style. As it is now, I don't really care for another one."
""
""
""
"The cork gives a good audible, a dangerous sign but there's no gushing. The aroma is fairly good, musty bret with some sweetness. It tastes not quite as good as it smells, sweet upfront with a weirdly bitter aftertaste. I've had some off bottles of 3F gueuze before, maybe that's the case here too. Hard to finish the bottle, I'll revisit with something fresher near the source soon."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Certainly not bad for a sour! Did it work? I think after having a sour everything else tastes way better, haha. Maybe I am still not experienced enough. I'll keep trying now and than."
"Cost: $6.99 for a 12.7 oz bottle."
""
"O: Certainly drinkable, but certain things about it (huskiness, stickiness, etc.) are just too much for me. With its relatively low acidity and high sweetness, it could easily be an introductory gueuze, but I'd just be worried that if I gave this to a friend, they'd pick up on one of the bad aspects I noted and be forever turned off by the style. Try it if you'd like, but I wouldn't recommend spending good money on it."
""
"Not sure how to compare this to others of the style, but as far as lambics/wild beers go it was relatively mediocre. Certainly some interesting yeast flavors going on, but other than that it was a sour apple cider. Good, but how good? I'll have to compare and update."
""
""
"There is a rush of bubbles that whisk by scrubbing the tongue and washing the light bodied beer away quickly leaving the mouth a little dry."
""
""
""
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found this to be a wonderfully drinkable geuze without any of the vinegary taste that show in some beers of this style. I’d love to have several of these to cellar and sample over several years. Overall, I think this is well made, well worth trying and would serve as a perfect accompaniment to many different meals. While I don’t think this is quite as complex as the Mariage Parfait I had a couple of months ago it is very nice. And now I’m motivated to try and set up a side-by-side tasting of the two."

"Lively carbonation, clean and brisk finish, highly refreshing. Wish these bottles were cheaper, I’d drink ‘em all the time. Great with food, particularly spicy dishes."
""
"Really a nice gueuze, nothing mind-blowing perhaps, but very enjoyable and balanced."
"O: This is an extremely drinkable gueuze. Not overly sour, not overly funky, not overly carbonated. I certainly enjoy it for this."
"O: great product; the more often I drink it the more unique it seems."
"4.0 D: This is a brett-lover's gueze. Very earthy and funky without much acidity. Good throughout."
"I'm not sure, but I think this bottle was a little young. It seems rough around the edges, phenolic and yeasty. I'm sure it could mature into something proper."
"D - Overall, I felt that this was a great Gueuze, but I expected a bit more flavor and punch on the sour side; good beer, that should be enjoyed slowly and a bit chilled"
"Overall- I have been wanting to expand my palate. If this doesn't do it nothing will. This is a sipper, but very interesting to sip all night. Very much like champagne. 4/5"
"not bad, very entry level. nothing stood out and came off as rather muted. i plan on trying this again, maybe a bad batch?"
"Very drinkable as the tartness does not overstep the rest of the beer. Bottle conditioning proves to give the brew ample smoothness. Funk is modest and unfolds a bit more when the liquid warms up. A great Geuze that won't kill you palate, a remarkable beer."
"The aroma was a bit lighter then I was expecting, but still tremendously good. Rich nose of tart apple vinegar, sour grapes and a touch of wet hay. Enormously complex, as it warms it comes across with a light wheat or herbal like quality and just the tiniest amount of spice prickling the nose. The flavor was more of the same. Rich notes of sour and biting vinegar flavor coming across on it right away. A little bit one sided, and not as huge as I would have wanted given the stature to which this one is held to, but still extremely solid and worth it. Light grapes and even a touch of wheat coming through mid palate, especially as it starts to warm. Mellow grassy flavors are mingling very well within the flavor now"
"I know lambic can have batch variations, but I remember drinking a 2007 vintage 375ml bottle a few months ago and really enjoying it."
"a gueze to me that most symbolizes what a friend of might that had never tried a traditional lambic before called it. pickled beer. and i would have to say this this one actually has the hint of pickling to it. earth, grassy and sour. has a dry end but its not as bone dry as others. or of a particular malt characteristic in the finish. one of my drinking friends favorites. i think its got a robust woodiness to it. and i would say the most herbal of the ones i've tried."
"overall experience- an enjoyable beer, not an everyday beer though. seems like it would work in any season. would love to have a gueze with a salad or a fruit based dessert. felt like i got a stronger aroma and flavor profile from the snifter and more of the carbonated pop from the flute."
"O- Drinkable and able to finish the bottle, but this is not even close to the same level as other Gueuzes I had. I like that it had some funk and was slightly sour, maybe would try again if I found a much older bottle."
"O: This is a very good beer in a style which I love, although this might be a bit too fresh, as some of the big sour and wild characters have yet to surface themselves. All in all this is a keeper and one that finds it's way to the cellar for development."
"Overall I really dig what's going on. From a friend that dreanks this brand quite frequently I know there is a bit of bottle variation, but this was great."
"Overall... This is officially what I deem only slightly above average for me. I do think this will improve with age-- but how many years would this need?"
"O - An amazing authentic geuze that's also reasonably priced (in my area, that is). If you prefer little-to-no carbonation or very earthy/barnyard-ish tastes, this probably wouldn't suit you, but if you're a fan of the higher carbonation level many Belgian varieties have and are looking for a wonderfully tart and crisp beer, this is definitely worth trying. Of the various geuze offerings I've tried (F. Boon, De Dochter, Cantillon, Lindemans, Hanssens, and Oud Beersel), I would rank this second to only the Boon Oude Geuze Mariage Parfait."
"Overall a solid gueuze. I preferred the Mariage Parfait to this though."
"(O) I had higher hopes for this one. Not as impressed as I was with a lot of the other gueuzes out there. A bit more damp and musk than I would have hoped for. The refreshing quality isn't there as much. For what I've become to know gueuzes for, this one really didn't hit home."
"MF- Nice crisp light to moderate body with a lot of carbonation in this one."
"Overall an excellent beer, of which I have already ordered more. Should be perfect on a hot summers day."
"O: Good beer. A little more tartness and this would be among my favorite Gueuzes."
"Overall a solid beer but not a mind blowing one. I think I'd prefer a 3F or Cantillon gueuze over this but still this one is solid. Not many traditional geuze's around so this one definitely is nice to be able to get. I have another bottle of this that I'm going to lay down and hopefully open many years from now. It'll be interesting to see this one develop."
"Overall: I was hoping for a bit more out of this beer especially considering the $14 price-tag. I felt that the oak presence could have a little more integrated. I also had this beer on cask at the same place and enjoyed a little more although it was such as small amount it's not worth rating."
"Drinkability – A good gueze can be so refreshing, especially in hot weather. Well, it’s 95 degrees, inside, with severe thunderstorms outside, Puckering and refreshing. The 7% abv is a bit high, but it’s doing me just fine in this heat. A solid gueze indeed."
"O - Admittedly my first experience with Gueuze, and it's certainly a bit challenging on the palate. Overall I enjoyed the way the sour, tart and pithy notes all played off one another and made this highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"Sourness and brett come through fast and quick but leave you wanting a bit more complexity. Brett does not throw off as much rotting wood as some and the sourness is bright and crisp. Not as earthy as some wild ales. Mouthfeel is nice and goes does silky smooth. Does it quite live up to Cantillon or 3F? Probably not, but that doesnt mean it is not enjoyable as hell and mighty tasty to boot."
"O - This is a sleeper here; one of the best brews available, but not the least bit hyped because it is not a Cantillon."
"Poured a extremely carbonated pour into a snifter. Huge white head with loads of carbonation bounding from the bottom of the glass. The overall look is very impressive. There are some spicy notes and clove from the nose followed by some sweet fruity esters. Slightly phenolic but very surprised by the tartness that followed. The nose and the taste do not compliment each other at all. This being my first sour I was shocked that anyone could appreciate this style. Clearly this is not for me. There was a funky almost putrid aftertaste that was only masked by the beers sour tartness at the beginning of each sip. I experienced a wet mop drenched in blended swamp moss that left me breathless. I will not be diving into this style ever again as I clearly dont have the palate to enjoy such flavor. God bless those of you that can."
"A decent gueuze, but far from landmark."
"CHEERS"
"Massive carbonation here first and foremost. First the cork, then taking almost 10 minutes to wait for the foam to settle following the first pour to fill the glasses. Finally pours a translucent golden orange, with a fluffy white head of at least a fist's height. Nose has some tartness, lemon, a bit of funk, mild barrel character. Taste is lemon, green apple skin, some puckering sourness as it leaves. Mild lactic note. Refreshing with some lingering drynesss and tartness. Some tannins potentially? Good mouthfeel, and not overly complex. Needed something like this as I try and ease my way into the world of sours/wilds."
"Cheers lads"
"Overall: Not much going on with this beer. Not a big fan. Maybe a good way to enter funky beers for some, but not that good for me. Much more desirable beers in the style for me."
"O - A little over the top sour and may well scare off the unseasoned Geuze lover. The Mariage PArfait is a better option"
"Overall its an average gueuze. Its not spectacular, but not bad either."
"Very hazy with loads of bubbles... champagne quality bubbles. Very fine foamy head. Stinky like farmyard. Sour grape aroma. Taste is unique, sour with Belgian yeast qualities. Not very complex. Mouthfeel is average, with great carbonation. Sour balance is very good. Geuze is a new subject for me and I am really not a subject matter expert...."
"Overall: A bit unbalanced for a Gueuze, and balance is key with this style. Still, its a relatively affordable introduction into the style and a decent offering. I'm guessing, based on the crispness and cleanliness of the label, that this was a relatively new bottle. Older, evolved bottles of Gueuze can be eye-opening experiences, I think I'll revisit this when I have cellered one for a few years."
"O: This is by far the weakest gueuze I've had so far."
"Overall decent, nothing special, but nothing bad, a good beginner's geuze."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of this one. The smell is nice, but it doesn't really deliver from there. Probably going to skip over this again."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are complex and fairly strong, but they stay very well balanced and the beer as a whole stays really crisp and super refreshing. Very enjoyable beer."
"Very tasty and certainly head and shoulders over the Kreik I just had from Boon. I can see stocking plenty of these in a Guezue cave."
"This was a pretty easy bomber to put down. Pretty smooth, but not a brew with a ""wow"" factor. Very worthy of trying and only set me back about $10."
"D - The flavor is subdued compared to the aroma and I am wondering the the extremely high carbonation scrubs some of the flavor away."
"Since reviewing it, I've picked it up a few other times for the simple fact it's an enjoyable, reasonably priced gueuze available to me locally. Hey, gotta get my sour fix!"
"A good gueuze that's not too far from being a great one."
"Overall, not the best example of the style in my opinion, but a good beer overall."
"The beer tasted a little tart initially but tasting was slightly inhibited by the roaring carbonation. There is definitely an oaky tannic bitterness that is accompanied with a musty, earthy cellar component. The beer finishes sweet with an apple peel fruitiness and sweetness. This is a very tasty beer with ample complexity. I'm glad this is so easy to find and relatively inexpensive ($6 for 375 at Whole Foods). As I continue trying more sour beers, I'm anxious to find out how this holds up as aI experience more."
"O- Just a pleasure to drink. I wish these were cheaper. I would drink them all the time. The flavors are so delicately placed and the attention to the balance is impeccable. It could be paired with so much, I'm thinking scallops in lemon butter next to arugula with a white wine vinaigrette."
"D: A great beer with a strong flavor/aroma. I could have a few, but would have to change it up after a while. Definitely one to celebrate with."
"Pours a nice blonde color with a good head and good lace. The aroma is corky and funky with great oak character. The flavor has a bit of lemon rind and general fruit rind bitterness, the acidity is pretty well controlled but very plesant. The beer is sour and has a kind of new oak character. This is a easy drinking Geuze, and I could likely drink it every day... I wouldn't mind that."
"Drinkability: Limited only by the finish which is a bit to bitter and astringent. The tart and funk are great. Tasty."
"D - As far as Gueuzes go, this is a pretty easy one to drink. Not too sour, not too funky, this is a good entry beer for a sour newbie."
"Pours a slightly hazy clear light amber with two finger soap foam white head, quarter inch sticks around. Smell: hay, subdued (glad) barnyard funk, swirling a couple of times brings out lemon peel and grassy aromas. Taste: tart, tangy but with a little underlying sweetness, apple vinegar, lime wedge, vinous and a little salty and spicy. Maybe a little easier going than others, but really nice. (Best by 6/2030?)."
"So easy to put down. I've gotta get back to work and as much as I don't want this to end, it will be easy to finish quickly."
"Drinkability is good thanks to it's 7% ABV and rather mild character. Nevertheless interest remains because of it's sprightly flavor and effervesence."
"Beer is more sulfur and almost sweet on the palate. The finish is a little odd. The funk falls a little flat on the palate, does not live up to the aroma. It is very nice, very clean and wonderful but I want more funkiness in there than this. Easy drinking. The tartness grows the more I drink."
"Overall, a very nice example of the style. If you want to try some funk, try this."
" i have grape farmers from the champagne region in france that goes back to 1609 in my bloodline so you know i love a brew that is very close to the product that made the area famous. I'm in love."
"D: A great Geuze at a great price! Worth a shot for any fan of sours."
"D - My first with this specific sub-style and it is really a bit like trying beer for the first time. It's hard to compare this to anything you've had before. A sipping beer with lots of complexity the aftertaste is an entire conversation."
"Overall, a decent example of the style, but lacks the depth and character of a lot of the better examples out there. Still not a bad deal for what it is."
"Mouthfeel is a bit more than some of the lower ABV Gueuzes, but also drier. Very reminiscent of a good cider. Overall, this is an excellent exacmple of the style, and 3-4 years certainly doesn't hurt the flavor."
"Moderate easygoing tartness, lemony citrus, yogurt, dry and spritzy. There is a tannic feel in the finish due to the oak, but not much flavor from it. Feels very light with it's seltzery carbonation. Easily sipped or gulped, perfect with food, and in warm weather. Fairly restrained in general, but pleasant and versatile. A good traditional Gueuze that isn't especially sour, making it ideal for those just getting into lambics."
"Overall I wouldn't put this gueuze anywhere near the better versions of this style, and would not recommend it to anyone. That isn't to say that it isn't a decent beer, because it is. Rating to style I would give this lower than a C for sure, but in the grand scheme of things I am bumping up the score."
"D: A bit of a sipper for me. But is seems about right for the style. A nice break form the standard line up."
"This was a nice experience. Careful with the bottle haha."
"D: Medium-high drinkability. I wouldn't say I love this one, but it's interesting, and more drinkable than some of the more sour lambics/krieks."
"(D)- A good take on the style. Not as funky or sour as expecting, but it does not turn me away from enjoying it nonetheless. I would be curious what age will do to this one and if that grassy bite will smooth out and allow more funk to come into play."
"Tiny pour at Lambic Summit event. Cloudy light gold with a large white head. Nose was sour, a bit off, kind of salty. Aptly described as ""eggy"". Really strong carbonation, a bit salty in the mouth. Relatively thin, a bit watery. Not in the same class as the standard gueuze from Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen, sadly."
"Enjoyed this one, and will likely buy others and cellar for a while to compare."
"The finish is extremely dry and a touch sour. Pretty much what I have come to expect, this geuze does not disappoint. It was much more subtle than the Geuze Boon, and I suspect that the heavier percentage of older lambic plays a distinct role in the mellowness of this blend. Extremely affordable and right on the mark. This could be a go-to for me."
"Andy shared this with me the other night. Review from notes. Poured this into a snifter. Pours a hazy golden color with a thing layer of bubbly white head and thin lacing. Smell is all tart, like granny smith apples. I really only get sourness from the nose, there isn't much else for me to smell because this is an overpowering aroma. The taste tart apples and a musty aftertaste. I felt like this was really over carbonated, it kind of exploded in my mouth. It took my a while to drink this, I like the sourness but it finished musty for me."
"*From notes taken on 6-15-10"
"D-overall a pretty good beer but is slightly dominated by the tart/musty flavors"
"d- really great, i had no trouble polishing off the bottle by myself. this isn't an everyday drinker, but i would definately pick up a bottle of this again. i've had other sours that i've enjoyed, but this is my first gueuze, and a tasty one at that."
"pours a hazy copper color with extra large white fluufy head and good lacing. head remains for a while. most extreme lively carbonation i've ever seen. boozey sour citrus smell. taste is the same very dry, sour, tart, and fizzy with some fruity hints. light body and long flavor duration. would be a fantastic brew if it had a bit more flavor, but it was pretty bland. worth a try for the mouthfeel alone."
"Poured into White Birch goblet. About a 3 finger head takes a few minutes to settle in. I can't get all of the 375 mL bottle in there right away. Straw golden color. Very nice. Smells tart, apply with a faint hint of pear. I can tell I'm going to like this one. The taste is of course funky. Most of the flavor hits the back of the tongue. I'm a little disappointed by the taste, but it still satiates my thirst for a decent gueze. The carbonation is a little sharp but it is with most guezes I find. This beer finds a decent balance for someone who doesn't want to be overwhelmed with sour and vinegar flavors but still enjoys a touch of it."
"O Not as tart as some other Geuze I've had, good balance, good beer."
"D - I really liked this highly recomended for people looking to get into the style and not pay a arm and a leg for it as well. Will have again."
"D: A nice effort from Frank Boon and the gang. If you see this at a good price or are looking to explore different gueuzes this is a staple to try."
"Pours a nice, dulled golden orange color with active head of stiff white bubbles, good lacing. Scent is of musty wood, barnyard, slight lemon, dried grain and straw, grass and earth with a touch of young white wine grapes. Taste follows the scent with more pronounced notes of cracker, and grass on the tongue, the musty oak and barnyard is maybe a touch aggressive and dulls the minimally bright notes of lemon and champagne. As i warms, it becomes less of a pleasure to drink. Light to medium bodied, active carbonation, dry on the tongue. A decent beer, with some muddled notes and a very aggressive musty funk to it."
"Overall: Having moved to Brussels a year ago, I've just now started drinking geuze -- mostly sparked by a recent visit to Cantillon (a must-see brewery) for their Quintessence tasting. Like everyone will note, this is an acquired taste, but it doesn't take long to really start to appreciate the differences of not only this specific geuze but other Lambics as well."
"D: The drinkability isn't that bad, but you really have to first acquire a taste for this style if you're going to finish the bottle."
"**Edit 09 June 2010. Tried this again at the Lambic Summit. Side by side with the 1999, there's no comparison. Cheesier, grassier, and more lemony, this is simpler in both flavor and structure. Lower tannins, lower oak character, more white wine character. According to Frank, this has been in the bottle for about 3-4 months."
"Nose off a relatively small floral flavor of herbs which contrasts with a mouth full of powerful and winey acidity. However, this acidity is average and the body remains fairly firm and offers a mouth with soft tannins long oak. The first taste is pleasantly sweet and refreshing before leaving on a finish, all power with a slight fruity oranges. The aftertaste is also suret with a light touch of lemongrass. A lambic highly nuanced. Beer complex."
"Excellent example of the style as it has the funk and tartness you except but blended just right for drinkability. I tasted fino sherry and old still Normandy cider in the finish but the beer creates its own funky vibe that satisfies with its dry finish"
"A stiff drink, and a fascinatingly complex and unique flavor/aroma profile. Plus, you get a free lambic yeast strain sample with every purchase!"
"A good beer to sip and certainly interesting to drink, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to drink more than one at a sitting. It'll be interesting to try some other geuze's as a point of comparison, though it certainly won't be something i'm rushing out to do."
"D: Good one, a winner."
"Delightfully mellow and quite dry lambic served up from the southernmost of the lambic breweries in a 375 ml bottle at everyone's favorite Belgian sports bar Camping in Beersel. Bottle features a green label with a red sash and reads ""Oude Boon Geuze L'Ancienne."" Pours into a Boon Geuze glass (think basic bar tumbler) a pretty golden orange with a thick and lasting white head. Bottle indicates that this is an 05-06 bottling. We consumed it in August of 2008. Aroma forecasts a very sour beer with loads of lemon-lime citric character and some red fruit along the lines of cranberry sauce or perhaps gooseberry jam. Body is quite sour and slightly bready with a citric hoppy finish. Taste is heavy on the lemon and the horsehair funk. Yum. Corky woodiness, tannic acid, and green grass follow. Solid and enjoyable but not exceptional."
"M&D - as is par with the style, big sour is not for everyone, but this is a quality beer from a quality brewer at a quality price ($5) not an overly complex flavor but surprisingly easy for me to drink despite is puckerosity (is that a word)"
"This Gueuze is a challenge to the palate but the Brett-yeasty character prevails but not the ultra sour, vinegar, cider character. Much more inviting and sessionable than most Lambics."
"Very drinkable, and a good introduction for someone who wants to try geuze for the first time."
"Light & sour, very drinkable, but not for the uninitiated."
"Would I drink it again...you bet."
"Very large sourness in the flavour, coming from a puckering citrus onslaught of lemon and lime. This overlays a decent funkiness mixed in with some earth, as if the horse blanket has fallen from the steed and dirtied itself on the stable floor. Light bodied and surprisingly crisp in the finish, with a short sour aftertaste. Drinkability is okay, but now as good as it could be for a geuze. Its unfair to compare it to the Cantillon I had in Brussels, but I can't help but feel that this is missing something..."
"refreshing and drinkable. nice alternative to champagne."
"AFTERMATH. I think I'm in love. A grilled seafood salad, with a slightly acidic dressing, would go great with this. And on a muggy Chicago summer afternoon? Fuhgehdaboudit."
"D: Nothing too crazy in the taste that might make this a chore to drink."
"Mouthfeel: Medium to low carbonation with a lighter body."
"Overall a very unique and interesting beer. I liked it but kept looking for just a touch of malt to balance out the intense tartness. Not crazy about the unfiltered yeasty wheaty qualities either, but as mentioned this was my first geuze, so maybe I'm just not used to the style."
"Overall, definitely what I would consider representative of the style, but perhaps a bit more rough on the palate than say something from Cantillon. Definitely worth a look for fans of the style."
"Notes: Overall, a solid effort and a solid gueuze. Really holds well to the style, just somehow falls short in a couple aspects."
"D,this is my first experience with geuze boon although i`ve had this one more then once .this is great i like grape fruit and champagne .. champagne beer!! this it an awesome direction for beer .."
"Overall a nice geuze, but I believe it needed a bit more bite in the flavor department to rank it among the best in it's style."
"I want more."
"Notes from 12/23/07"
"375ml bottle with a best by date of 02/2028. Nice golden color with an initially thick white head. It smells dusty, funk, must, and a bit of citrus candy. The taste is like a bit of sour lemon juice but the mouthfeel seems a little watery much like the other Boon Gueuze. Decent gueuze but I'd prefer a Cantillon for the same price."
"Very delicious - quite sour, but with a depth of complexity. I do like a good gueuze, and this is a good gueuze."
"The drinkability is somewhat hurt by the aggressive bitterness in the aftertaste, but there's lots to like in this beer. I would definitely enjoy 1 or 2 glasses of this with some blue cheese and biscuits."
"Overall, this was a very good beer for the style. Very drinkable. Went nicely with some cheese. Impressive Geuze."
"D - A very interesting beer. Not something to drink everyday but well worth a try."
"T/M/D - smooth and dry, low on carbonation (for gueuze). A bit less bold than others of its brethren, but more approachable as well."
"I will definitely still stock a couple of these in the basement, but next time I will likely pass on the tap on this one (at least when theres such other amazing choices on tap)."
"Pours a slightly colored golden brown with a big head that recedes somewhat quickly. Smell is extremely sour with a strong yeast presence. Flavor is not as sour as I would have expected considering this is the first geuze I have ever had and that the nose was so sour toned. This is actually extremely drinkable and I like it quite a bit. It is thinner on the mouth and not very heavy at all."
"Taste courtesy of piscator34. Light straw colour. Nose is of light funk and citrus. Taste- quite tart with lemon, green apple and some horse blanket. Mouthfeel- High carbonation as expected making for a spritzy dry treat. Very refreshing and tasty gueze"
"Review added 10-29-2007, translated from french 1-27-2008."
"Five years aging hasn't hurt this one bit. Neither did not having time to finish the whole bottle and leaving a little in the fridge over night! I've never tried the Boon Oude Gueze fresh but I'd imagine this extra time has only helped. This was really good - guezy - stuff!"
"D- Awful. I won't have it again."
"D - Easy to drink relative to other examples of the style because of a strangely subdued flavor profile. The aroma is excellent but the taset did not live up to its promise and I would have prefered a stronger sour character."
"Something I'll buy again, but not my favorite gueuze."
"There is a lot of carbonation in this beer. The head started at 2 finger and grew to 3 as I write this first couple sentences. The head is quite thick adn an ivory color. The beer is a cloudy apricot. The smelly and taste are quite funky. This is the first Guauze I've had, so I don't have much of a baseline. I can taste and smell the ""horse hair/barnyard"" aspects from the wild yeast. It tastes a lot like some really bad, infected homebrew I once made. I really like belgian beer, but guauze might be streatching it a little."
"A brilliant gueuze, even better than the standard boon offering"
"M&D: overall the mouthfeel is pretty standard, refreshing enough and very mild in carbonation, showing good efforts on bottle-conditioning. And yet the complexity of this bottle seems to be lacking, compared with numerous bottles tasted before... But nothing will stop me from trying this beer over and over again. It's like a good honest session bitter in the world of geuze for me~~"
"D - Good stuff. Doesn't have the puckering sourness of other gueuzes, but is probably a nice introduction to the style. Very sippable."
"Overall - An excellent gueuze.... one of my favourites... Very refreshing and definitely worth a try..."
"Rusted orange. Full foaming, wispy and creamy head. Aromatically vibrant, with horsey, fruit (lemon) and barnyard aromas. Typical lambic aromatics. Flavor is much more approachable, less acidic, less sour, sweeter and generally less flavorful than lambics from say 3F, Girardin, Cantillon, Hanssens. I havent been impressed by Frank Boon thusfar, to be honest."
"In the aftertaste: leather, tannin, sharp. And overall, a good and sharp tartness."
"Santé"
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat."
"I'm surprised this beer hasn't been reviewed before. I think it's outstanding. But a warning.... it's a pretty uncompromising gueuze style, and it definately will NOT appeal to drinkers who have not already developed a taste for gueuze via a more approachable route. So if you don't already enjoy Belle Vue or Morte Subite, then come back when you do! Right now it's replaced Duvel as my favourite Belgian tipple. Here in Antwerpen the Berenbak only sells it in 750cc bottles, and that's the review sample here. (It also comes in smaller ones.) Anyway, the top comes off this big bottle and straight away you notice the foam building up, with evidence of solid yeast. Pop some into the beaker and you get a foamy drink which soon settles down to a nice pale colour. It's not perfectly clear by any means, but hell it's a live one, what do you expect? The aroma next.... hard to describe this. Vaguely citrus. Cooking apples. Then the flavour... this stuff is really quite sharp. Did I really pay money for this? I'd better pretend to like it... Once the initial shock has passed you realise you want more. And more. It's quite easy to drink a whole big bottle all by yourself, in fact yesterday afternoon I got through 2 of them. And being only around 7% it's not such a big deal. Highly reccommended."
