"O - A nice treat to try, not every day you get to try a straight ""lambic"" on draft. I would prefer a bit more tartness and less woody dryness but all in all another solid offering from Bullfrog's sour program."

"I seriously doubted the comparisons to Belgian Gueuze but I was wrong. This is one of my favorite American sours and gives me great hope for America's sour future!"

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It has a really solid blend of sourness verse funk and earth. I was a little surprised by the bitter herbal notes but that aspect of it was very similar (in my opinion) to fresh Drie Fonteinen. I cant wait to get into the bottled version of this."
