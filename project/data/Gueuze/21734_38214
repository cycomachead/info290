3.45,-5.2,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"If there were awards for oddball beers, this would certainly be a contender. The aroma has a fruity, spicy complexity that bodes well, but is let down by the messy flavour. It has a wine-like quality that is much more fruity than a typical gueuze (which I would expect to be dry and lemony). From the taste it's hard to pinpoint what this is supposed to be: a 'beery' lambic? A sour tripel? It seems to shoot for too many targets and misses them all. An interesting effort, certainly, but it lacks purpose. I'm glad I had the chance to try it but this is probably a first and last time for me.","jazzyjeff13","Aug 17, 2012"

3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a light bodied and crystal clear polished bright gold in color with a frothy two finger bright white head. The nose is light and yeasty with a definitive Tripel backbone. It does have some slight Brett but definitely is short in the lambic department. It is slightly lemony however. The flavors are very light and feature typical Belgian yeast with a slight lemon zest aspect, perhaps lemongrass, and a very light tartness. It's ok, just isn't really dominant in one phase or another. The lemon grass does increase as it warms. This one is alright, not worth $18.99 but it's drinkable.","aasher","Aug 07, 2012"
4,9.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some fruity, acidic, yeast, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with an emphasis on the gueuze flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink but the gueuze overpowers the tripel in both the aroma and flavor in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 06, 2012"
3.5,-3.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazed golden orange with a white head. A very musty aroma to this, damp oak, funk, and barnyard. A touch of sweet banana and bubblegum, sweet sugar, straw, and yeast. All over the place. The flavor is just as disjointed. Musty funk, barnyard, straw, and some oak to go with the sweetness of the tripel. Banana, bubblegum, and a hint of cotton candy. Light citrus and some mild tartness.","womencantsail","Jul 28, 2012"
3.65,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Would be interesting to see how this is with some more time in the bottle. The sourness didn't really stick out on the taste, but the finish was on the dry side. Wasn't fully sure what to make of the hybrid, but it was a good beer.","KDawg","Jul 18, 2012"

3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pour is a hazed golden peach, deep amber core, tight white head. Nose seems to have a hint of bretty leather, strong yeast notes with a faint spice, light candied sugar blends into lemon zest and a tinge of alcohol. The taste is similar, a touch sweeter. Nice light spice and yeast but are overshadowed by lemon juice, candied sugar, and juicy citrus. Light body, airy, soft feel, and nice carb.","cpetrone84","Jun 03, 2012"

3.59,-1.4,5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Beer is medium bodied, with ample carbonation to support itself. Resultant mouthfeel is smooth, never prickly, but perhaps could use a bit more carbonation to move this along the palate at a faster rate (has a tendency to sit on mine). Ethanol is noticeable in the back of the palate, wafting into the nostrils and felt a bit on the throat. Closes quite dry, with a bit of stickiness around the lips.","falloutsnow","Mar 26, 2012"
3.71,1.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Served in a tulip at the Brick Store. Pours a lovely golden orange with a hazy clarity and a dense, 2.5 inch cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a bullseye dollop with some froth around the edges. Concentric bands of textured lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose is fairly subdued - citrus rind, belgian yeast, a hint of caramel, vinegar and an orangey/mimosa-esque character. The flavors on this beer are definitely interesting - light pit fruits (peach/apricot), yeast, subtle toasted malts and wheat. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and some acidity/astringency. BA classifies this beer as a gueuze. In that regard, this beer falls short; however, the description on the menu was of a gueuze/tripel blend, which I found to be spot on. This beer is an interesting montage of malty, tart and fruity and is worth trying, but don't expect a gueuze. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to try this beer.","Jwale73","Mar 24, 2012"
3.15,-13.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"beer is light in body and easy drinking, the sourness is light though and this is not a very good gueuze or a very good tripel. Oops. Not a repeat for me.","drabmuh","Mar 14, 2012"

Some spicy character, some nice funk, but really not special. Flavor is nicer, more funk, citrus rind, not enough tartness. There is almost a saison like character to this beer which adds a nice spice. Mouthfeel has good carbonation, but could be a bit lighter and more lively.","Agold","Feb 21, 2012"

3.13,-14,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall: This is kind of an unfortunate amalgamation of two of my favorite styles.

3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Delicious throughout, the beer finally rests as a very characterful Belgian Pale Ale where the honeyish tone becomes the main line throughout and then with the much welcomed complexity of pungent must and tartness.

4.7,29.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"33cl bottle, arrives dusty in a shipment from BelgianShop. Best before 26/3/12. Pours a cloudy tan/gold in color with a frothy white head that is setting up to lace like an old woman from Bruges. The sour apricot smell is evident immediately upon the pour, I don't have to get near it. Doing so, however, brings out more citrus, hay, and chocolate. This is literally making my mouth water. The taste is freakin fantastic. Just as the smell advertises, much more mellow than I imagined. Sour fruit, dried hay, sort of a mild chocolate and nutmeg thing going on, something that dings the ""champagne"" bell in my head, a dry finish and a very balanced, very smooth, very nice beer. Wow. Pale Ale, tripel-gueze, whatever it is I wish I had ordered a case of this stuff. It is sharply carbonated, with an overall silkiness that holds it together and leads to the kick-a lacing. Seriously. I don't know if it is the obvious aging on this sample, what this style really is, or how much they brewed but get thee hence and get some. You'll thank me. You can repay me in Vicardin.","roblowther","Nov 09, 2010"
3.75,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"This is an interesting blend; it is really nice to try, but I am pretty sure I would prefer either an authentic Gueuze or Tripel over this in the end. Somehow this seems almost too well balanced between the Tripel and the Gueuze character.","Gueuzedude","Jul 16, 2010"
4.37,20.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Purchased from Bier Temple Brussels. Pours a copper gold hue into a flute glass with a two finger white fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a centimeter of foam and nice lacing. Smell is straw-ish and geueze like. Taste is bitter and champagne like. Musty, with nice lambic flavors but hoppier and with a lingering bitterness. Not as spritzy and lively as a pure lambic, but very dry on the palate. Not exceedingly drinkable but a great sipper. Very Special!","sketchpunx","Sep 01, 2008"
3.53,-3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a hazy orangey color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of light tart notes mix with some bland Belgian ale is interesting though not as powerful as I was expecting considering some Girardin had been used to assemble this beer. Taste is also a very refreshing mix between some tart and sour notes with light green apples notes and some typical Belgian ale malt backbone. Body is fuller then average with limited filtration and great carbonation. Well mix overall with a refreshing taste though I was expecting a bit more from the lambic.","Phyl21ca","Beers"
4.05,11.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"M&D: the tart and tannic edge of geuze on top of light effervescence helps retain a very refreshing and surprisingly clean palate, while the mixed flavour of triple and geuze also ensures a lighter body that is fit for a thirst-quenching ale. All in all, this bottle is a very intriguing experiment, and a quite successful one I must say!","wl0307","0"
