"I have a few older bottles, and I just haven't gotten around to trying this beer, until someone was nice enough to share a fresh one at Gratitude day. Cloudy amber-orange pour, with a nice fluffy white head that settled at a small layer. Funky, lemony aroma, cobwebby, green hops and oak. More of the same in the taste, barnyard funk, earthy, green hop notes, lemon, acetic acid. Light-medium body, awkward mouthfeel. Reminded me a little of Iris, which I really do not like fresh. So I'm interested to see if I like this beer better when it's got some age on it. Hops in lambic just doesn't really do anything for me."

"Overall: a solid beer but as far Cantillon beers go this is one the lower end of the spectrum. Lacks the complexity of other beers of the style, and as far as dry hopped sours go they seem to be more on the miss side of the spectrum."

"Sunny side up egg yolk, light laced bubbles. Big farmhouse funk, fresh paint, sunburned lemon peel. Soured milk with lemons."
"750 ml capped and corked bottle, back label says bottled 24 September 2012, best before September 2022.  Labeled as Cuvée St-Gilloise.  Served in a Prairie Teku, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Aroma is nice, it's smells like apricots, hay, funk, citrus peel and some peppery spice.  The brew tastes like citrus (mostly lemon) peel, hay, funk, bready/grainy malt, oak, peppery spice, earthy/floralness, and some white grapes.  There's a nice mix of tartness, fruitiness, and funky/earthiness.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and easy to drink with a good amount of carbonation.  I thought this was good, definitely worth picking up if you come across some!"

"Very complex though.  Lemon, white grapes, barn yard."

"Pours with a nice thick head and retains this throughout glass. Nice funk up front with a delicious tart slightly sour finish. Very enjoyable, glad I was able to pick this up at the beer mongers cellar sale."

"Overall (4.5), just another fantastic offering from Cantillon. From what I'm aware of, both this one and Iris are hopped up lambics, but I think I prefer this one a little more, as it's a lighter lighter in body and less bitter. Perhaps the blending that takes place in this one (that I don't believe takes place in the Iris) has smoothed out the rough edges a bit."

"2014 vintage. On tap. Very funky! Gueuze with an exotic taste. So tasty. One of my best from Cantillon so far"

"Pours a hazy as can be golden color with a dense white head. Smells of tart acidity and apricots. Sour beginnings give way to a peppery spice of a finish. Lemon notes, crisp green apple, and fresh cracked pepper. Delicious."

""
""

"Pear colored appearance with an active and alive foam. Sour, tangy pear aroma with white wine, vinegar and Apple cider. Lemony tart flavor with some Apple cider, balsamic vinegar, earth, and mineral. Tart, sour feel, quite tangy it feels alive on the palate."

"This fresh Gilloise may be drinking better than the 3 year old Lou Pepe I had last week. And that Lou Pepe was amazing. And I certainly enjoy the 2 year old base lambic better than the all pale malt Iris base. The hops seem to shine through more on this as well without the sharper hop bite of Iris. Yes, yes, yes.."

"Corked and capped 750 ml bottle from Tipples dated July 4, 2013. Pours hazy tangerine colored with a small white fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of vinegar, oak, hay, sour apples, lemon peel, wet dog, maybe a little mango pineapple tropical thing going on here. Flavor is sour oaky vinegar, dust, juicy tangerines and other tropical fruits, grass. Low to medium body, low carbonation, finishes dry. A nice beer, but maybe a tad unexciting."

"750ml bottle. 2013 vintage. Aroma-wow, lots of funk, citrus, bleu cheese, pepper. A lot going on here. Poured a hazy straw color with no head, minimal carbonation. Taste-again, wow. Sour, tart, funky, mild citrus sweetness. As it warms flavors of spice and white pepper peek through. Finish stayed with me for hours. Lucky to try this. Simply amazing."

"O-really enjoyable, could drink this often if I could find it"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall great lambic blend with good hoppy touch to it, a really interesting beer. I don't think there is anything the Cantillon family can touch without it turning to gold."

"O/D - OK. Definitely a letdown based on the reputation and my experience with Cantillon. Tame in all respects for a beer from them. Definitely not sour. OK, but certainly wanted more."
"Overall: A really nice Geuze; I like the impact of the hops but it is the funk that makes it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was delightful, not nearly as acidic as the regular gueuze, it seems as if the hops really moderated some of that. The hops are very subdued, I really couldn't detect them all that much, they may have muted some of the vinegar in the nose."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a super enjoyable beer, one I would absolutely drink again."

"O - Very enjoyable geuze that goes down very well."
"Re-review (18 months): Had this one again, from the same November 2012 vintage. Poured into a Cantillon stemmed glass today, 4/1/2014. So a year and a half of age. Basically, I found this to be significantly better than at 11 months of age. The floral aspects have faded and there is a much more lemon zesty, white vinous quality to the beer. I could be fooled into thinking this had some white grapes, especially accompanied by the oak and mustiness. Clear Cantillon barnyard horseblanket funk that's developed a good bit in the past few months. Really good stuff, especially as the vinous qualities seem to have developed in this beer somehow."

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D) Perhaps not the most proper take on the style, it is very tasty and does subtlety full justice."
"This is an excellent lambic, apparently straight 2 year. The differences between a standard gueueze are apparent - a bit less funk depth and south intensity - but still stupidly quaffable and complex. Another must try from Cantillon."
""
"O-First Cantillon Gueuze. It was tasty. Not as good as the Classic Gueuze."
""
""
""
"Overall: fantastic. Ended up with this when they kicked the Kriek keg, and I'm glad it did. The highlight of the night for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The nose is really interesting and unique, great stuff. But the flavors don't really come together at all."
""
"Overall I smelled this brew more than I drank it, if that's possible, but it's go some incredible impressive character."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cantillon's only non-aged hopped beer was truly magical. Between the earthy, hoppy bitterness, the intense acidic notes, the complex funk and the supple mouthfeel, this beer put me in a state of sensory overload."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall another high quality offering from Cantillon. The least sour tasting beer I've had from them, but the flavor profile is top notch."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Seems as though I'm continually impressed every time I try a new Cantillon beer and this one is no exception. This is an excellent beer and worth seeking out."

"I don't think I've smiled this much since getting a puppy as a child (come to think of it, a few of my happiest memories involve drinking Lambic under a clear blue Brussels sky). Cantillon Saint-Gilloise should have stuck with its maiden name (Cuvée des Champions) because it is, in my opinion, a perfect Gueuze and one of Cantillon's finest offerings."
""
""
""
"Light body and mildly carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink but not all that interesting. I last tried this out of a bottle about two years ago and remember more fresh hop character with a nice lambic base, so this keg may have been on the old side."
""
""
""
"O: I get it! Finally, I get the appeal of Cantillon. This is exceptional and titillating. I would recommend it to others."

"OVERALL: This is great. I'm not all that experienced with gueuze yet, but this is one of the more approachable I've found so far. The sourness is balanced well with the hop bitterness, and the feel is creamy and crisp at the finish, making this absurdly easy to finish quickly. A very nice gueuze I will gladly drink again, especially on a hot summer's day like today. Recommended."
"Overall. Very nice, as usual with this brewery. I'll enjoy trying a well aged bottle of this at some point."

"3.5 D: It's definitely one of the funkier Cantillons out there. It's good, but 3F does it so much better. Still, worth a try."
""
"O: very good; quite drinkable, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very good as one would expect from Cantillon, but I found the bitterness a bit jarring. I may like this beer more with a bit more time on it."
""
""
""
""
"O - Still relatively young, so I assume this may become more dry over time, but this is a very enjoyable gueuze."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, one of the more balanced gueuzes out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably one of the nicest additions of funk I've tasted - so incredibly funky while remaining drinkable and free from anything offensive or off-putting. A nice meshing of flavors with some fruits and a light, yet assertive tartness that keeps you coming back for more. If this were more easily available, it would be the ""go-to"" brew to introduce someone to the world of unabashed funk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Fantastic balance and complexity, the hops are a great addition."
"A twist on the usual gueuze. Personally, I'm more fond of a more tart gueuze than a hoppy one, however there's little doubt that this is fun to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- This one goes down very easily, given that this beer was not overly tart. Could be a great session beer."
""
""
"This poured out as a hazy yellowish orange color. The head is decent looking, thin retention with a pretty good lacing. The smell of the beer gives off a good amount of funk along with grassy malt. The taste of the beer is along the lines of a Gueuze and a pilsner. Tart and slightly sour, some grains and wheat hidden in the faith distance. The mouthfeel is smooth, nicely carbonated and drinkable. Overall this beer is really quite nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Looks like clover honey, hazy and golden. Not much head. Funky, classic lambic aroma with lots of plasticky medicinal notes, ripe pears, dried apricot, a faint hint of lychee, and pleasant, grassy hops. Lip-smackingly, puckeringly acidic and very refreshing. Sour apple, sourdough, white grapefruit... really juicy, relentlessly sour but very moreish and mouthwatering. There's a touch of passionfruit and this intriguing violet-like floral quality in the finish, as well. Not quite 'easy drinking' on account of its acidity, but really very delicious."

"O. A very fruity geuze, more on the bright rather than earthy side, thanks to the brett and the dry hopping. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Pours a lightly hazy golden with a finger of what head that faded into a good long-lasting collar. I’m getting a lot of stone fruits on the nose and palate including apricot and peach. The taste is full of more citrus notes than the nose let on. Earthy spice and a bit of yeasty funk balance out the fruit and lend some tartness to the mouthfeel. The finish is very dry, and I’m getting some citrus rind bitterness in the aftertaste. Low carbonation, tart dry mouthfeel, medium body. Another great Cantillon, I need to get my hand on some of this stuff. Thanks again Russ."
"A wonderful lambic. The dry hopping adds a nice note and the balance of yeast flavours in this one are great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Accomplished beer and one of my favorites in the Cantillon pantheon. The hops and the lambic work for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer albeit being nothing like I was expecting. I have not had a Cantillon with this much hop character but it was a nice chance of pace. There is the typical Cantillon funk which cannot be replicated to complement the dry hops and create a unique yet enjoyable experience."
"Appearance is cloudy orange with a short dense head that doesn't last long. Nose is funky. Tons of sourdough, lemon, and a slight hint towards a sulphuric character. Notes of hay and dry oak. Very complex on the nose. Taste starts funky with lemon, bready sourdough character, drying tart character towards the end. Some grape skin in there as well. Mouthfeel is dry and highly carbonated. Overall, a very complex and unique brew."
""
""
"O- Very drinkable and tasty. Not that complex but very well balanced. It could have a big nose and taste but it is really a treat."
""
""
"Easy drinking yummy beer."
""
"Definitely not as in-your-face as most Cantillons, but that is the appeal for this beer in my opinion. This is probably the smoothest, easiest drinking beer I've had from them, yet it doesn't sacrifice their signature flavor profile to do so. Awesome stuff."
""
""
""
"Similar to the Classic Gueuze but a bit toned down with sourness and funk. Also somewhat of a hop feel with bitterness and an herbal hint. Solid and very drinkable."
"O - Overall, while this is a tasty beer its possibly my least favourite Cantillon. For me, it just lacks the complexity of others."
""
"Cheers"
"Overall, another stellar beer from Cantillon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Cuvee St. Gilloise is a solid sour, but it seems to lack the power and complexity of other beers from Cantillon."
""
"Overall - Excellent. Maybe lacking in complexity, but the flavors it has are phenomenal."
"A somewhat dull orange underneath a thin layer of foam. The head was creamy and long lasting, never fully receding. The nose is full of tart apple, leather, tobacco, cider vinegar, and white grape skins. Soft and complex, with equal parts sweet and tart. The tartness leaps onto the palate with a punch of flavor. First, it was a good amount of earthy tones, then white grapes, tobacco, green apples, cider vinegar, sea salt, aged cheese, and a light, old oak flavor burst onto the palate. Holy complexity. Just waves of flavor on top of a bed of sour. Light to medium body, low carbonation with a sharp acidity. This is a damn fine gueuze with a tremendous amount of complexity. It could take days to truly break down everything going on."
"Big thanks goes out to MSquared2 for sharing this one during a fair sized Cantillon tasting! 2011 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Cantillon balloon. Poured fluorescent orange with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, funk, tart, and herbal. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, funk, wood, sour, spice, and herbal. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. The hop character on this one really added a very unique touch to this style that I never would have thought possible. The fruit hoppiness really blended quite well with this brew and kept me interested after each sip. This could be a good gateway for some who like fruity hops and want to get into sours. Will be interesting to see what some age does to this brew as the hops start to fade. But as is, this is still a very solid brew."
""
"O - More muted, but I love the apple/pear flavors that dominate."
""
""
""
"O-Great beer that is a nice change of pace for Cantillon. I really like the hop character that St. Gilloise and Cuvée des Champions have, it’s a nice compliment to the lambic. Still prefer Cuvée des Champions more than St. Gilloise, but both are awesome."
""
""
""
"Overall, this has to be the most refined gueuze I've had to date. It might not have been the most memorable, due to its lower alcohol and smoother taste, yet I think I would say that it was the finest crafted I've had yet. I sort of think of this as the gold standard for gueuzes now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another great gueuze from Cantillon, though I preferred classic and Monk's to this one."
""
"Cantillon delivers once again a superior gueuze that takes the palate in all sorts of directions at once. As complex as the beer is, so many flavors reveal at once that is seems to confuse the nose and palate as much as it satisfies them. It's akin to that Picasso that's awe inspiring in the gallery but you don't want hanging in your home."
"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. The aroma didn't set the bar high but the taste came through. Cantillon does it once again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - really good offering from Cantillon. This has a nice combination of funk and gueze flavors. Not as extremely sour as some of their other offerings, which makes it more drinkable in my book."
"M: Bone dry with pinpoint carbonation. Hugely refreshing and very easy to drink despite the considerable acidity. Another awesome offering from Cantillon."
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with an orange-white head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some grain and herbal hop aromas. Taste is exactly the same with a slight bitterness on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great gueuze with a nice hoppy presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really excellent beer, this is the only Cantillon gueuze I've had besides their regular Gueuze 100%, and I definitely enjoyed this one just as much, if not more."
"Tight white head on top of a golden mildly hazy body. Aroma is really funky, lemon rind, some cobwebs, and green apple. More of a horsey, sweaty, musty funk. Flavor is crisp, clean, lactic, musty, apple, grapefruit rind, i get a mild floral almost honeyish flavor as well. Mouthfeel is light and airy, good carb, dry and mildly tainnic. Really nice and refreshing."
""
""
"D - I really enjoyed this vintage - I've had mixed success with Cuvée Des Champions in the past, but the bottles I've had most recently have ranged from very good to stellar. I'm looking forward to the bottle I have in the cellar."
""
""
""
"On tap at Cantillon. Poured into a small tulip.  White head, medium retention atop a light gold body. Aroma of peach, green apple and some balsamic. Taste of citric like green apple, tart apricot and grapefruit. Quite mouth/tongue puckering and tasty. "
"Taste is much happier than the other Cantillon beers I've had, which is really nice with the tart Cantillon funk. Taste is classic Cantillon tart and funk, a bit fruity with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Very good beer."
"This is the Cuvee Saint Gilloise and a different beer. Not sure why they are put together in one on here. Pour is a transparent golden peach with a very loose small bubbled white head. The nose has a lightly dusty funk, cob web, hint of sea salt and some zesty yeast notes. There are some golden fruits behind and a strong hp punch of juicy citrus and floral hops. The taste seems brighter and more balanced. Very dusty funk, lemon rind and a bit of sour peach. There is a fair bit of lingering sourness, citrus hops, and an assertive bitterness with just a light touch of heat. Medium body, very active and granular on the palate, high carb and fairly dry. This is starting to open up in flavor and has an interesting and awesome hop presence and bitterness but not quite balanced and integrated enough to be great."

"Pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with a thin white head. the smell is slightly funky, tart and a little hop presence. the flavor is sour, but not overly sour with a little bitterness. the mouthfeel is dry and well carbed. overall this is a a good gueuze not a great one"
"Pours a light orange-gold, with a finger or so of bright white head. Carbonation isn't outstanding here, but there's some lace left in addition to a bit of head retention. Nose was prominent as soon as I popped the cork, tons of lemon and sour green apple, a hell of a lot of funk. White vinegar and a load of acetic acid. Love the funk and some semblance of barrel here. Taste wasn't as tart as I had expected, still more raw green apple and pear, Cantiloon funk, a touch of barrel and notable acetic acidity. Some interesting sweetness mid-palate, but a tart bite finishes off the palate. This gets more and more complex with each sip, each revealing the characteristics of this gueuze in a different tone. Quite a light body, with a fairly modest carbonation, not as effervescent and zippy as some others, but still works well for the drinkability. Still very nice, and something that I wish I could've enjoyed on a warmer day! A nice gueuze, thanks Fred!"
""
"O: A very enjoyable birthday gift that I was thankful to share with a wonderful group of BA’s. I would seek this out if you have not already. IMO, I think this is a great introductory beer to the style of gueuze."

"Overall: Nice and refreshing, not too sour, not too complex, but easy to drink"
""

"The flavor has bits of wood w/ lemony sour and other funk aspects-there is mild citrus rind and slight bitter herb w/ a hint of white pepper and pineapple+ melon w/ a hint of grassy astringency. the tropical fruit presence goes well w/ the oak in the finish. Overall I thought this was a pretty great gueuze - I enjoyed other for its complexity and the level of sourness ...this is pretty drinkable and brings a nice amount of oak from the barrel and funkiness to the experience"

"This is a medium to light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. There is seemingly no alcohol inclusion. This is a type of brew that is complex enough tht you can sit and ponder over it for a long time but it is easy drinking enough that you could take down a whole bottle effortlessly. Pleasantly tart without going overboard, as far as the geuze style goes, this is not harsh at all. Very well rounded and enjoyable. I will be seeking more of this out."

"D - It's an interesting mix, but I don't find Cuvée des Champions quite as purposeful as Classic. Wouldn't say no to another tasting, but wouldn't really seek it out either."
"Overall – A fantastic beer from Cantillon. A great gueuze and would love to try this again."
"Appearance: Light bodied, high carbonation, very sprizty on the palate. Finish is drying and very refreshing. Overall, a very solid gueuze. Complex, not overly sour (not necessarily a good or a bad thing for me), and nice hop character."
"Despite the funkiness in the nose, and the sour on the tongue, this really has a refreshing edge to it. Light hopping. Shares some of the apricot it seems from fou fune. Throw in a little hay and grassy notes, and you have a complex but clean and enjoyable gueuze that is balanced throughout from the first sip."
"The fuller body and dry-hopped juiciness makes this a pretty interesting beer. and it works quite well."
"O- A really interesting take on gueuze. I love mixing hoppy dipas and ipas with lambic and this is not quite what I was expecting in terms of hop profiles on the nose. It was much more interesting this way, I really enjoyed how the hops played with the barnyard and sour notes."
"O: Great beer albeit a bit heavy handed on the tart with not much on the funk."
"Overall: This was one of the first gueuzes that I was able to really get into, and now I think I am an addict of the style."
"So I'll just keep drinking this year after year then. Save some for a short vertical in the future."
"Overall a great beer, very complex tasty flavors and excellent mouth feel. As to be expected from Cantillon, this beer is delicious."
"O: I prefer the Cantillon Classic Gueuze to this but that could be because of the age. At around 1-2 years old I have a feeling this would be in my sweet spot. That isn't to say this is a bad beer. It's an excellent example of the quality one can expect from Cantillon, albeit a little young. 4/5"
"I have an '07 in the cellar that I'm holding for the next Philly sports championship. Hopefully will not have to cellar much longer as I'm not sure it will hold up well."
"Medium body, nice carbonation, lingering and dry on the tongue. This was a bit of a surprise beer for me, and I was definitely into the addition of fresh hops amidst the already fantastic Cantillon funky/sour flavors."
"Hands down, my favorite beer of the Pizza Port Belgian Beer Festival."
"(D)- Cantillon never disappoints. Yet another solid to great Gueuze from their lineup. Definitely will only get better with some more time since the dry hopping is definitely detectable. Great stuff."
"Awesome beer. Not very musty or earthy. Brett is big on the nose, but acidity rules the palate. Seems like a fresher batch."
"M: Spritzy and lighter in body. Good tartness."
"On draft at Beer Revolution. Pours a hazy, light amber with a a two finger fluffly white head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a decent earthiness, funky brett, hay, and some lemon tartness. The taste has the same earthiness as the aroma. Medium tartness, some wheat, hay lemon. The finish has a strong brett funkiness as well as a lingering bitterness that is quite unique among the gueuzes I've had. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Awesome beer."
"Drink- A very well done beer. The classic gueuze is hard to do and Cantillon does it very well. I would come back to this anyday."
"O: I think I still prefer regular Cantillon Gueuze, but this was really quite good."
"Minimal white head, a wee bit of lacing over straw yellow a bit opaque body with no visible carbonation. Lemony esters and salt dominate the nose, some barnyard aromas, a faint bit of floral hops. Taste is more sour than tart, lemony and salty, a bit of hayish funk, lingering dry finish. Fairly light mouthfeel, light and refreshing. A very unique beer, not really my cup of tea, err gueuze, but I certainly see what the buzz is about. Certainly in the pantheon of beers for this difficult to capture style glad I was able to try this."
"O - Very enjoyable and very easy to drink. I had two of these and my fiancee had another...a perfect beer for the summer. Really enjoyed this one on-tap much more then from the bottle. Recommend!"
"O - Overall I really liked this one. It wasn't an over the top sour like some of the other Cantillon offerings I have had and it really hit the spot on this hot afternoon."
"Smooth and well balanced. A refreshing carbonation level. Overall a very smooth gueuze. Not too extreme or overwhelming in the funk or sour departments. Just a nice refreshing sour."
"Love ending a meal with a Cantillon lambic."
"Yeah, just zesty tart and bitter goodness."
"O- Once again Cantillon has managed to make my jaw fall to the floor."
"Overall, a great gueuze from Cantillon. This one is dry hopped, but I did not pick up any of the dry hopping which is most likely due to the age of the beer, being bottled 10/4/2010. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an acidic gueuze that retains its drinkability. Not perfect, but definitely a solid example of the style."
"Cuvee des Chamions pours a mildly hazy orange, lightening to tangerine when backlit. There's a thin white head that dissipates quickly into nothing. The nose is a bit delicate, and it's largely a blend of sweet pale fruits (apricots and peaches) and woody oak notes. There's a faint tart aroma present as well. The sour notes noticeably increase in intensity in the taste. The resulting balance between sweetness, barrel notes, and acidity is just about perfect. It's still not nearly as aggressively tart as some of the other Cantillon offerings I've had, but that only allows the other flavors to really shine through. The body is as dry and light as I'd anticipate from a 5% brew that probably has little in the way of residual sugars, but the carbonation is a pleasant surprise. It doesn't really come alive until mid palate, but when it does a torrent of tiny bubbles appear and liven the beer up. Cuvee des Champions maybe isn't as challenging as Cantillon's other beers, in terms of how much the wild yeast and bacteria have taken over, but it's subtle and artfully balanced. I imagine it would be accessible to someone new to sours/wild ales, but at the same time still has more than enough depth to please a seasoned drinker. My favorite sour to date."
"Mouthfeel was nicely prickly on the tongue. Light-bodied and generously carbonated throughout. So glad to have been able to try this Cantillon offering. Well worth being sought after."
"O: I feel like a lucky man today.  I would rank this as an exceptional gueuze. The hops really pushed it up a notch."
"Overall a very good beer that I was glad to try on tap, as I've only had Cantillon beers in bottles."
"O: The beer is relatively easy to drink for the style because although the sourness is strong it does not overpower your palate."
"O-nice offering. Would like to try again"
"Pours a nice hazy golden orange with a decent amount of white head. Smells tart and sour. Lots of hops and sweet sourness. Tastes sweet with a mild tart kick. The tartness is fairly subtle. Overall incredibly drinkable. Nice carbonation levels. A great drinker"
"2010 bottle. Average carbonation, slight foam, not much lacing in a beer clean glass. Massive funk in the nose, no hop aroma detected. Same in the taste, couldn't find any of those dry hops in it, just massive Cantillon funk. More sour than a classic gueuze, I loved it. Really drinkable."
"750ml bottle, 2010 vintage. Pours a golden orange color with a thin white head. Intense aroma of lemon, peach, grass, and funky barnyard. Flavors of lemon, lactic acid, subtle hops, and herbs. Fairly light body and carbonation with a long dry finish. Very delicious and refreshing."
"O - One of the best beers ever; every bit as good as any Cantillon I've had."
"O - Really great beer that was easy enough to drink and had a great flavor profile. Good stuff, would like more."
"O - The beer was quite impressive. Very delicious wood notes and a vinous profile that help the tartness be a compliment and not so ""in your face""."
"96 Points"
"This is a very nice lambic. It has a great deal of flavor and a nice sourness. There is a lot of carbonation."
"Overall this was one of Cantillon's more interesting beers however I'm not sure it's one of my favorites made by them. Still, the hops add a nice dimension, making this well worth a shot."
"O: Clearly one of the favorites among all the wilds/sours tried - and rightly so. Wonderfully ripe and pungent, juicy and lasting, great depth. Sure, it's what Cantillon is known for, but it's always nice to be reminded of why they are, arguably, the best at what they do. A pleasure to drink and to share among friends."
"Mouth is highly carbonated. The high carbonation and signature Cantillon dryness makes this a crisp, drinkable beer. A very approachable and enjoyable lambic."
"O: This dry hopped, unbelnded, lambic is an extremely refreshing brew which would be perfect on a warm summer night. Also paired well with the tuna crudo and sweet breads I ordered. Definitly the best unblended lambic I've tried! Highly recommended!"
"Pours hazy gold, thin white head. Smells cider and alcohol, some slight feet, oak, vinegar. Taste is tart, cider, almost salty, almost some Bleu cheese funk. Mouthfeel is medium light, Hugh carbonation, pretty dry, drinkability is pretty good but the bitter cider keeps you from sippin too fast."
"o - Overall I thought this was another great beer from Cantillon. I really liked the smell and enjoyed the hops mixing with the classic Cantillon gueuze smell. The taste was good, though slightly too mch vinegar. None the less, I had no problem finishing a 375ml bottle of this and glad I have another bottle of it."
"Very different, very good. Easier to drink than most other Cantillons as the acidity levels seem to be cut down significantly by the dry hopping..."
"Refreshing, spritzy, and delicious. I'm glad to have tried this and to share it with friends"
"Overall this is yet another top quality offering from the best brewery in the world. If you see some, pick it up!"
"Feels very well-carbonated. Prickly and dry, strong medium body... Very nice... This is excellent and easy-drinking. Great sour beer to drink. Exceptional and delicious."
"Bottle. 2008 vintage. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a cloudy golden orange color with a coastered white head. Super clean aroma with lemon, peach, straw, some barnyard, and really slight hops. Drinking this is really close to a perfect dream. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Lemon zest start with some sweetness, minimal hop bitterenss in the end. Slight funkiness but nice balance to the overal fruit tart fruit notes. Peach fruit flavors as well. Overall, this is just a fantastic beer, clean and crisp with a really nice flavor."
"Bottle at Beerbistro, a bargain at $30. A geuze for intermediates, this is a smooth drinker. Aroma still floor cleaner and funk, sweat and arseic. Light orange body, medium mouthfeel. Not too hard on the palate initially, a key for beginners. however it is there hours after.Fruit and ginger and apple.Bottle with Todd B"
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this one a lot and it was worth the price. I would love to have more if I ever get the chance."
"Wow, what a lucky score ran in for a 6er and spotted this gem! After reading reviews fresh not aged seemed to be the way to drink this. Poured into a rodenbach glass, opaque hazy straw gold rests under a head of white rocky foam. Initial blotting of lacing ceases, but the head never leaves this beer. The aroma is soft, mixture of hay and straw, horse blanket, grassy hops (surprising), and lemon. Acetic jowl puckering sour that transitions seemlessly into a soft Brett flavor with a nice balance of horse-y-ness. Citrusy sour lemon and grapefruit. Tanic barrel goodness on the back end, any indication of the initial hop aroma is gone in the flavor. Most unblendeds I've had have been Brett bombs, this is nuanced and delicate. My favorite Cantillon to date."
"D: very quaffable and the fruity aspects make it very easy to casually sip throughout the day"
"drinkability is great. this may be one of the most balanced cantillons i've had. not overpowering in any one direction. great sour depth and complexity. good stuff!"
"Very rare to see this on tap anywhere. I'm very glad I got to try it. Keep the Cantillon coming!"
"D: Low. And the high price adds insult to injury."
"Overall, a decent cantillion. Much more acidic than others which is why I would have to limit myself to this one no matter how much I liked it. I definitely enjoyed this one."
"D - High"
"Cheers!"
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy golden color lambic with a medium foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of funk and barnyard with some dry hoppy notes. Taste is also a funky mix with medium barnyard notes with well balanced tart and acidic notes and a dry European hops finish. Body is quite full with average carbonation. Very well brewed with hoppy notes mixing quite well with the tartness and acidity."
"D: pretty darn good, would drink a second if I could afford it!"
"insanely drinkable. i could kill a 750ml bottle at ease, or a growler if i was allowed one. never boring, very flavorful for being lighter overall."
"Excellent beer. Like it better than Iris which I consider to be a fair comparison."
"D - surprisingly moderate for a Cantillon beer. Sourness is not extreme and remains at an easy to enjoy level. Nice hop bitterness is a bit unique in this genre of beer and is quite enjoyable...price is a bit steep at $12/glass so probably will be my only one...but it is well worth the price."
"Very smooth and drinkable without sacrificing purity - probably the best place to start with the style if you are unaccustomed to traditional lambic."
"This beer appears a hazy orange, with a little head that fades rather quickly. The beer smells spicy, funky, and noticeably more subtly sour than I expected from a Cantillon. Of course, I did drink this side by side with Fou' Fonne, which was incredibly tart. I found this to be an enjoyable beer, but it lacked the depth and/or complexity that Cantillon beers usually have in spades. This was a plain, decent offering from a brewery that I hold in the highest esteem."
"Thank you Matt for graciously sharing this with us. Pours golden yellow with a ton of carbonation. head forms, but doesn't retain, just a lot of bubbles in there. Smell is a bit funky. Kind of smells like wet grass, but with some lemon notes. Taste was great. Sour/tart flavor. Main thing I identified was a grapefruit citrus flavor. Not sure if I'll ever be able to have this again, but I hope I am."
"Pours a hazed golden orange color with a large whitish head that settles into a persistent film with clumps of scattered lace. Aroma is a my favorite part of the beer, a complex and potent blend of funk, lemon zest, yeast, must, oak, and mild hoppiness. Flavor is a little bit of a letdown from the nose and just general expectations of Cantillon. Flavor is a clean, dry punch of zesty lemon, mild funk, apple and earthy dry hops. Body is medium thick with sparkling fine carbonation, nothing too remarkable. Very drinkable, and refreshing. Another excellent offering, but not the best Cantillon."
"It's lively, especially off the tap, very refreshing. A little bit of everything. Light bodied and dry finishing. Very easy to drink but at nine bucks A flute I cant drink a bunch, I wish i could of had more, and I will."
"Drinkability is high, a very nice, refreshing beer, basically a gueze. Would love to try this fresh to enjoy the dry hopping more fully, but after only having the pleasure of enjoying this once before (thx Frank!!!!), I'm just happy to have gotten my hands on a bottle for myself."
"D- this stuff is the cats pajamas a very refreshing offering from cantillon."
"The South Philadelphia Taproom followed by a Phillies game at Citizens Park is bound to bring a smile. This fine lambic came to the table with a little head and a whole lot of attitude. Just a bit cloudy pale yellow with fine carbonation and an earthy bread-like aroma gave way to a lemony scent and a definitely bold lemon crisp first taste. The flavor is exciting with every sip - to me a really distinctive quality. There is a beautiful balance between the hops and the rest of the broad gamut of flavors in this complex aged lambic. The Cantillon St.. Gilloise is the definition of fresh despite its years in a cask."
"Definitely a tart one, but in a much more manageable way then a number of other offerings from this brewery. The two years spent in oak isn't overtly noticeable, but must contribute to a certain degree to the softer, smoother nature. Nice and drinkable, with the usual caveats, and now with a hoppiness quotient to boot! A sassy flavour contrast to some nice homemade cupcakes - thanks, babe!"
"My first unblended lambic, and, lo and behold, it's on draught at the CK. These guys know what they're doin', I tell you what. It pours a cloudy pale straw that's suffocated for a while by a tall, thick, white froth. Once this head dies down, the smell is detected: a good amount of funk, wet hay, cobwebs, and a rather tart vineyard of white grapes. I'm not sure what to expect after that whiff. The taste is composed of sour apple, tart white grapes, yeast (you know the taste), bread, lemongrass, and that nice citrus combo of lemon and lime that 50/50 and Squirt managed to mimic so well in the soda world. While puckering somewhat, my mouth determines a light body with an active but small-bubbled carbonation and a dry finish. I'm intrigued, to the point that I want more of these unblended beauties. Luckily, one's in my fridge right now..."
"D: Really enjoyable... kicking myself for not stocking up when I had the chance months ago... if you see this on the shelves buy two... one for you and BM me to trade the other!"
" Pouring a hazy orange with a thin white head that recedes too quick, this looks decent. Imo, cantillon beers look better out of the bottle. The last vintage of champions was a screamingly good beer, and this 2010 vintage is close. The dry hop character is immediately noticeable, bright, vibrant, earthy, lemony, quite old world in character. Behind that lies a gentle cantillon funk with the usual suspects- grassy, barnyard and a little stilton cheese. Nothing like a wet dog or horseblanket though. Refreshing. The palate opens bright and vast with moderate acidity, with lemons and a touch more vinegar than i remember this beer having. The hop character is quite pronounced, reminding me of a good, grassy pils. Great balance. Drying and lemony on the finish, this is great stuff. Maybe a touch overcarbonated? I also get a light aspirin character. All told, a beautiful beer. While this might be a weaker vintage, i look forward to meeting jean van roy in a couple of days!"
"drinkability: good"
"4/4/4.5/4/4"
"Huge thanks to Cristian for sending me this bottle!"
"D: very good beer by cantillon but not my favorite from them, too expensive for what it is at $35 bucks. The iris comes close to the overall characteristic and is almost half the price of this one."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable; not my favorite cantillon but not one to turn down either!"
"D: Very nice. After this I'd love to try a fruitless wild ale, gueuze, etc. that had been freshly dry-hopped with something like Amarillo."
"The beer is quite unique and interesting. The aroma is quite similar to Orval, with its characteristic blend of hoppiness and constrained Brett funkiness. There is an astringent bitterness from the hops which is made more acute by the lambic sourness. Think grapefruit pith, soaked in tea. Overall, a much stronger hop effect than Iris. An interesting experiment and a true delight to try! Unfortunately (but unsurprisingly) this limited release was already sold out within the day and we could not bring a bottle home."
"Jean Van Roy may now call this beer Cuvée St-Gilloise because the soccer team for which he brewed it is no longer on top, but if Cantillon brews you a beer you're always a champion in my book."
"Great beer overall. I'd like to see Cantillon make more forays into the hopping arena, although they should use some darker bottles if they're going to do that, or the beers could become major skunk-o-ramas. A Cantillon IPA sounds amazing."
"2009 vintage. The beer pours a murky yellow color with a white head. The aroma is tart lemon with some oak and earthy qualities. The flavor is heavy on the lemon tartness with some oak notes. There is not as much funk as I was expecting. The beer is very acidic and is very, very dry which forces you to drink more and more. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: This is delicious, it really gets good when it gets near room temperature. Expensive, but where else am I going to get to try this."
"The beer displays tangy citric acidity, light body, and sticky texture. This lambic is extremely well-balanced, and the hops just serve to enhance the dryness and the flavors already in the beer. I will certainly seek this out again."
"Thanks to nightbrew for opening yet another stellar Cantillon brew."
"Overall a pretty good geuze."
"D - I don't really know what else to say about this beer I'm loving the taste of this one I'm the type of person that will drink sour after sour and don't see any problem in drinking this 750ml myself tonight worth finding to try"
"D- easy to finish and left me wishing i had some more. nice and sessionable without being too sour to make an entire bottle a chore. check this one out."
"D: Darn good, man Cantillon does no wrong."
"D - Light and refreshing, extremely delicious. Look forward to getting more into the world of lambics and guezes."
"750mL bottle, corked and capped, brewed January 2007 & bottled May 2009, purchased in Columbus for $17.99. After consuming a disappointing Fantome Noel, this beer turned out to be a real treat. It pours light straw color, clear in the first glass (and progressively hazier with subsequent pours due to sediments), with a thin wet foam. The aroma is classic barnyard funk but with a nice citrus edge (lemons, even moreso than in the Lou Pepe Gueuze I had last night). The taste starts sour and ends with a crisp tart bite and aftertaste of sour lemon juice. Maybe a little grape too. Wow, this is easy to drink (of course you have to like sour beers to agree with this sentiment). I have only seen this for sale once in my area, and bought it immediately. I'll do the same if I see it again in the future, an outstanding display of quality."
"Personally, I think it's one of Cantillon's more accessible brews and almost sessionable for the style, wish I would see it more often."
"Overall, this is one of the best lambics ive had in a while. The green appleyness almost rivals that of Ithaca Brute (almost). Can't wait to see how this does with some age. The Drinkability is downright amazing right now. Certainly one of the best lambics on shelves. Great, great beer."
"Plenty of funky flavors, sourness, and tartness here. Though the dry hopping really adds a unique depth of flavor. All in all a a great beer that should not be missed. One of my favorites."
"750ml bottle served in my Allagash tulip. Poured an orange-gold with a quarter inch bright white head with a slightly hazy clarity. Nose was citrus, cork and some french oak. Taste was citrus and a little woody. Mouthfeel was medium-light with some tartness up-front and a consistent background effervescence. Tartness stimulates the salivary glands in the cheeks towards the latter half, before culminating in a slightly dry finish. Nice sour - not over the top and really quite drinkable for the style."
"Interesting. Not particularly drinkable. Well carbonated, particularly considering the style."
"Despite not completely falling in love with how this sits on the tongue, its beauty, its jaw-dropping aroma, and the simple drinkability of it make it an instant favorite that I'd like to buy in quantity for those times when the mood for a sour hits but I'm not looking for something over-the-top."
"D: Rather drinkable but this one tastes more like a sour than anything else. Building of bitterness in the end takes away from overall enjoyment though."
"Very interesting, unique and enjoyable."
"D: Low ABV and tasty but something in there that doesn't make me continue to reach for the glass."
"Flavor is funk and lots of it. There's just a hit of hops at the very end of each sip. Nice and different touch. Can't believe how funky this is. Can't wait to see what some age will do to this beer."
"I could drink lots of this. Cantillon just rules the roost."
"d-overall and excellent beer. I have a feeling that after a year or so this beer could score some 5's!"
"Nice complexity of flavors. Medium body, very nice. Refreshing. A nice small, but complex beer here."
"Overall it was very solid. This was just amazing crisp and clean and really just incredibly drinkable. I was really very pleased and think this one needs a bit more attention. One of the light of the Cantillon brews and worth every penny."
"D: High marks for this. Could put a whole bottle away on my own, if I didn't have to work in the AM>"
"If you are looking for that classic ""Cantillon Sharpness"" that will make you pucker, this isn't the right Cantillon for you. This new recipe is quite sessionable."
"Overall, definitely one of the more unique lambics I have had to date. The dry hops were definitely something I have never experienced in a beer of this style. That being said, I'm a huge sour head and this one lacked a lot of tartness that other Cantillons have. If you don't like your lambics really sour, drink this one now and just enjoy the unique hops flavors. If you like your them very sour, try aging this one."
"750ml bottle from 2009. Pours cloudy orange-gold with a surprisingly large head. Smells of wonderful lactic tartness and lots of Brett character. Very musty and oaky. Some citrus and other fruit, as well as a bit of grassiness. Sharply sour taste with strongy earthy, musty notes from the Brett. Very fruity--almost vinous. A bit of mineral character. Incredible dry. Light-ish body with low carbonation. This is a hell of a beer."
"D- I could seriously drink 3 bottles of this, no problems. Not too sour but true to the style. Love it! Great treat, get some if you can, even if the other Cantillons are too acidic for you. Not an entry level sour beer, but not too crazy advanced either."
"Nice tart front and finish but things seem thin in the middle. Slight acidity with a plethora of fruits, starfruit, stonefruits, some berry flavors, hints of wood and tannin with a nice hop bitterness on the finish with a bit of the grassy and earthness throughout."
"drinkability is great. wonderfully sour and just mellow enough to keep a bite and remain drinkable. a solid sour with a very drinkable aura (for those BAs who love a good sour beer). cheers!"
"Pours a lightly cloudy orange amber, thin white head forms, quickly disappears but drops some spots on the glass. Smell is insane, woody, crazy acidic, very lemony, hay, funky and sour, almost a grapefruit or tangerine acidity going on, touch of vinegar, pretty awesome. Taste is just as good, for woody and acidic, lemons, nectarines, light toasted/ashy oak, funk, very sour in the finish, but pleasant and balanced. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very drinkable stuff. Damn this was a good lambic, thanks Scotty!"
"Light bodied, effervescent. The mouthfeel is very dry. This is insanely drinkable. This was split 3 ways but finishing an entire 750ml alone would be very easy."
"D: truly a summer beer, temps right now in low 80s and perfect for quaffing, just wish the price wasn't so high"
"Overall, definitely worth a look!"
"D: At 5% or so, this is a very easy sipper, which explains why this first glass took all of 20 minutes to get through."
"I picked this brew up from a small beer store on one of my last days in Europe. It pours a clear golden color with lots of effervescense. The beer sports a very nice white head...thicker than expected, and long-lasting. The smell is not as intense as it could be, but there's a very pleasant grain and horse-blanket smell. Modest funk, with a little wood scent. The flavor is very well balanced. Not as sour as most Cantillon's, this one is incredibly drinkable. The flavor is still strong, despite the medium-sourness. Medium to medium-light in body. Very nice beer!"
"Notes from: 4/24/05"
"6/4/7/3/15 (3.5/5)"
"Brewed in 2005, bottled in January 2008. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Gorgeous translucent gold with a touch of amber. One finger of dense, compact, snow-white head that fades into a partial cap and halo. Thin but solid sheets of lacing. Aroma consists of lemon juice, crabapple, and grapefruit rind. Sour but not really funky. Flavor is similar. Citric acid, big sourness, vinous/chardonnay notes, and an earthy finish that must be from the dry hopping. This beer is medium on the palate with great carbonation. A little sticky but still a pretty good mouthfeel overall."
"This is the freshest sample I've had yet and it is a completely different beer. The dry hopping is powerful and reminds me a bit of Le Terroir. Very nice and I won't bother to cellar this in the future. Wish it was easier to get fresh."
"Drinkability- I have to admit, it was refreshing and easy to drink, but the watery part made it a bit borning and dull to drink. I've had much much better from Cantillon. Maybe just a bad bottle. But, I don't think I am willing to shell out another $20 to find out."
"I've never been the same since..."
"Had this on tap at Novare Res earlier in the summer, and I've seen bottles around recently as well. Poured a hazy golden with a light head and lacing, which is fine for the style. Smells sour and funky with a noticeable band-aid aroma. The taste is similar. The band-aids are just restrained enough to make this enjoyable. Any more flavor from that department would just make this too challenging. Sour, but more horse-blanket funk than sourness, but some lemon does start everything off. The mouthfeel is smooth and very tannic. The extreme funkiness, band-aid flavor, and sharp tannins make this a bit challenging. You really better like gueuze to enjoy this brew. I do, but even so, this was pushing the edge of the envelope between great and undrinkable."
"But that doesn't mean it isn't an incredible beer. I am absolutely loving this bottle, my birthday beer. But if I had a few bottles, I would sit on them. That is all."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Pretty mild sourness for Cantillon. Fruity notes of green apple and lemon peel are met with an interesting herbal hop flavor. Carbonation is fairly low here, but it's ample enough to make it dance a bit on the tongue. Really a remarkably subtle and balanced beer."
"I did not know anything about this brew but I am glad I got to try it, also saw in on tap the day before down at Churchill's in San Marcos left over from CBC week, probably will not get to drink this again because I have never seen it in bottle form in the US, recommended"
"A fairly amazing beer. Almost a wine, in terms of the oakiness and vinous sourness. A real treat."
"A flavor of lambic sourness that I still am getting used to, but very good for this style. The body is medium with a sour finish that is also astringent. A very good beer."
"Very refreshing and highly drinkable. It's nice to have unblended lambics to be reminded of what these beers can taste like in their ""naked"" state."
"Sampled 7-19-2007. I believe this is my first unblended lambic. Pours a brown hued orange. Nose is slightly like a certain flavor of Ricola throat drops. I can't remember exactly what kind, but I think it was lemon and herbs or something like that. Antiseptic tone to it. Fair amount of wood is on there too. Flavor is sour indeed. Definite wood character to it. Just a pure mix of tart and wood. This is what a lambic is. Feel is as expected on the liquid and ripe with carbonation. Overall very drinkable. If you haven't had a real lambic and don't appreciate that sour funk, you won't dig this one. This is a purists dream. Very much worth taking the bus to Philly for a day to get a hold of."
"Great beer..."
"D - This one got better with each sip."
"Paired best with a Morbier cheese and pears. Shared this with some euro soccer fans, but it would be a treat to have a bottle to myself..."
"Drinkability: decent despite the strong sour flavors. This beer grew on me during the session, and the taste score rose as it warmed. Very interesting on tap."
"D - It is mild and not to sour. PLeasant overall. I wouldn't mind having this one again. Not fantastic, but definitely worth trying."
"Overall, nice introduction to style. Very drinkable, in my opinion. Seems an easy transition for a hop-head."
"From notes. 750 ml bottle, 12 oz sample. Poured a very clear, lightly coppered orange color with a sparse whisp of head over top. After the pour, this one was pretty still, with no bubbles working out of solution. There was no mistaking what this beer was going to be about when smelling it. Tons of sourness hit hard, with a big acidic sharpness. There was mild donkey urined soaked hay acridness, and I'm not sure if this should follow the last statement, but I thought it was very enticing. Flavor really assulted me with sourness on the first sip, that moved to a more vinegar-like sharpness and acidity. There was an odd sharp sweetness in there as well that I could not correlate to anything I was familiar with. Mouthfeel was moderate with a very light carbonation. It left a good bit of stickey spit in my mouth and was moderately dry on the finish. Overall, this was another winner from Cantillon. Very good taste, with a lot of intense flavors like sour and acidity. Not a lot of complexity there, but it really worked for my taste. Good brew."
"on tap at the Yeast fest @ Spuyten D in Bklyn. Poured cloudy light apricot, nose is of funky cheesy feet with a slight lactic sourness. Smokey, moderatly sour brew. With a long flavorful finish. Approachable Lambic, Brett present but not out of control, give a try of this one to Lambic newbies. Great brew to experience if you can find any more around."
"Vibrant aroma, with more fruit hints than a normal lambic with subtle lemon, orange and peach and lightly herbaceous, floral hops from the dry hop, perhaps? Light orange color. Dry with mild tartness and wld yeast flavors. Well balanced. Really your typical Cantillon lambic, which is still mighty tasty, but I didnt notice much from the Goldings addition, except a little bitterness."
"*Much more drinkable then the other Cantillon products - a truly special brew!"
" Taste is quite puckering at first, then it seems too smooth out some. Not as tart as the grand cru or Iris. The lack of sourness allows for the perception of malt driven flavors, although I am at a loss to describe them. Second pour is moderately ( for Cantillon ) dirty. Mouthfeel is great, the slight carbonation is spot on. If not for the acidity, I could drink another 750ml."
"This brewery is proving itself to be outstanding in my eyes. Everything I've tried from them has been solid and unique. Always in the same style, of course, but each has it's own personality. This one's no different."
"orange overall and clear.. sparkling with carbonation following a loud pop of the cork (previous pop-less reviewer, try another bottle!). aroma exists in funkytown with a sweet lime tourist and pear essence passerby. lactic with slight plant-like quality, most likely a generous hop addition masked by the barnyard pissyness. some candy apple wafts could be my imagination, and are certainly not supported by the extreme musty but mouthwatering flavor. lemony tart and mellower sourness makes it more drinkable than the usual suspects (see iris, fou foune). bready finish and age depth gives this beer some serious body for 5% lambic. sum this one up with an earthier than usual taste with obscure differences in lambic style. still great, love cantillon."
"As this beer warms up it really begins to soften a bit, open up, and become quite a bit more fruity with lots of grapefruit and lemon notes. This is definitely quite enjoyable, and I definitely do not enjoy Lambics enough, it is definitely a special occasion type beer for me, and I would much prefer that it was an everyday beer for me."
"Green apple paste, lemon marmelade and oak aromas emerge from the brown paper and orange colored liquid. The top is a scummy slick of dirty white. Sweet cherry and strawberry pulp flavors detail a huge thrust of leafy, lemony hop aromas which are, in turn, buried by gastric, sour, cidery mustard extractions. Solid, tender textured but scarcely sweet. Monumental."
"This is quite accessible, and except for the fact that it's a limited edition and rather pricey, this would make a great entry in to geueze for those who've only experienced the fruit-flavored lambics."
"Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed this special release Cantillon which I thought I would never get to taste. A seriously Big Thanks goes out to the awesome Beerica-weizen for the opportunity to try this one! I owe ya!!"
"Taste: You can see he added both fresh hops and candi sugar to help out with carbonation. And I thought Jean Pierre didn't like sweetness in his Beers...The sweet and sour combo is quite nice, but this isn't my favorite."
"Opaque gold, very murky, a nice sight color wise, but unfortunately a quickly departing head. Aroma feels surprisingly sweet, as always well presented on a sweaty and leathery dominated wild yeast top ground. More floral than most, thanks to those untamed hops. It develops a pleasant horsey saltiness as it gains temperature. Its hard to explain how those hops blend in with the rest, but it creates a cheesier character than the yeast alone would I feel. Abundant grapefruit taste. Strong big bubbles, surprising considering the small shape of the head, pretty full bodied as well, I like that. Oldish taste despite the fresh aroma. Sweet and easy drinking proposing a lemon slice here and there that grows into a pungent tartness reminiscent of a straight lambic. I kinda dig the balance, but it doesnt stand out as one of my favourites, I just like its originality. A dessert lambic? Why not!"
"750ml Bottle. 2004 Vintage. Dark golden yellow with a nice head of tight white foam. Lacing is minimal, but pretty none-the-less. Aromas are all lactic lambic funkiness with a real juicy earthiness abounding in this particular vintage bottling. I get hints of horse blanket in the aromas as well as hints of very acidic fruits, musty juice, and more. Ya know, the normal stuff. The taste is exceptional but very subdued for a Cantillon. This is not nearly as sharp, acrid, or acidic as most of Cantillons other offerings. This is quite juciy in fact, and less dry than most other gueuzes available on the market today. There is also a distinctively bitter aftertaste, that must be from the use of dry hopping. Although this brew is still far from, what i'd call, hoppy. Mouthfeel is champagne like. Spritzy and grand, and the drinkability is absolutely awesome. Wow, what a quaffable, laid back gueuze from the masters of lambic. I need to try the Loerik next. For sure."
"Overall:	I like this as I like the Cantillon products, but to be honest, I have yet to learn to fully appreciate these beers. Ill keep trying though, because I do like this one (and its siblings)."
