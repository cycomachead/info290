"My overall impression of this beer is that it leans towards the tart and acidic end of the scale and downplays the funky character found in several other Gueuzes.  Thus it would make an excellent counter point to others as part of a tasting session involving gueuze from several breweries.  Alternatively, it seems a fine beer for having with a meal or for sharing with others rather than being something to be consumed solo in one sitting."

"70% 2-3 Year Aged Lambic with 30% Young Lambic. Sparkly, tart and citrusy gueuze.  Can age up to 25 years."

"O: This a good, solid example of a gueuze. Light, sour, refreshing and tasty."

"Review according to BJCP2008 (style 17E). Bottle 75cl - Batch L13.04. AROMA: acidic aroma, with na interesting balance between horsy, goat, and some fruits. APPEARANCE: gold color and very clear. average white head with medium retention. TASTE: moderate sour/acidic taste with a horsey balance and some fruit notes. no hop flavours and no bitterness. PALATE: light body and medium tartness. médium-high carbonation. OVERALL: an average gueuze that lacks a bit more fruity character."

"Drinks very easy, super refreshing , well done take on the style (4.0)"
"Overall a good fruity lemon gueuze that's quite refreshing if not totally mind blowing."
""
"Less intense than some of it's countryman cousin brews, however, still on the puckering side of the ledger."
"As an aside, why do breweries like Timmermans and Lindemans insist on pumping out heinous, syrupy fruit concoctions when they are capable of producing a solid beer like this?"
""
""
"Surprisingly, I drank the majority of the bottle yesterday and did not feel any alcohol impacts."

"O- This is a light bright well blended gueuze that leans a bit more toward the young lambic but in a good way. Lots of soft layers that is very drinkable and sessionable aswell. Worth the price of $16 dollars."

"O - Not the best Geuze around but worth a hit."

"Deep golden color; cloudy appearance. Opaque. Creamy 1-2 finger head when poured that fully dissipates quickly. Sweet and sour smell; made me want to drink the beer. Distinct smooth sour taste that progresses to a tangy citrus flavor with a dry tart finish. Very refreshing taste that I really enjoyed. Light to medium body with lots of light carbonation; almost champagne-like. Overall an excellent sour that is one of my favorites."

"This bottle is from 2010 and pours a very hazy golden hue with a one finger head and lacing here and there,the smell is fresh green apples,vinegar,a touch of oak and white grapes,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with spritzy carbonation and has tastes of green apples,acidic vinegar and finished with a white grape tartness and overall it's nicely paired with my fish and chips but not one for the first timers cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not for beginners and perhaps not as funky as others, this is quite a tart, acetic experience"
"Overall: A nice gueuze, that's enjoyable, but by no means in the top tier for the style."

"Timmerman's can produce a straight up funky sour bomb of a gueuze. It's a shame that for years their standard offerings have been of the overly sweetened fruit beer type. I've heard this is the best of the bunch but I enjoy the gueuze so much the kriek will be purchased on my next trip to the store. A damn fine gueuze worth keeping on hand."
"A very good gueuze. Tasty and solid. Probably the best beer I've had from Timmermans. Recommended."
""
""
"the best ive had from timmermans, or one of them. this blended lambic is really well done, with notes of oak and lemony lactic funk in the nose and taste, without caustic tartness of others. light hazy rusty golden color with a soda style head on it pure white but short lived. the nose is all lemony funk and wood. i get a pinch of pale wheat malt, but its awfully light, made even lighter in the taste by fierce carbonation. a nice blend of flavors, tartness and sharpness of young lambic up front with the more refined yeasty dryness of mature lambic on the back end, quality. acid is there but not as puckery as so many gueuze beers. more approachable for the uninitiated i think. a little light for me on the body, which may be a product of slight overcarbonation, but it really does work. clean finishing for the style too. a little expensive on shelves, but a solid example of belgian gueuze. timmermans best work arguably."

"OVERALL: Nice tart sour, more sour than anything I've had from the brewery. This is the straight funk no doubt."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/17/2013. Pours moderately hazy golden straw color with a 2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big sour apple, lemon zest, pear, grape, apricot, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, leather, funk, herbal, white wine, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of wild yeast ester and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big sour apple, lemon zest, pear, grape, clove, pepper, oak, hay, straw, grass, vinegar, leather, white wine, funk, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy tartness/sourness on the finish; with lingering notes of sour apple, lemon, pear, grape, hay, straw, grass, pepper, clove, oak, vinegar, leather, funk, white wine, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of wild yeast and oak barrel flavors; with a great crisp malt/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very crisp and moderately prickly/acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent Gueuze style! All around great complexity and balance of wild yeast and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on with moderate acidity. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Opened at a good temperature to a serious pop and poured with a mammoth off-white foamy, billowy head that quickly settled and no lace. Color is a clear amber. Aroma is an intense blend of yeast, citrus peel, and funk. Flavor's much like nose, tang and wild yeastoids up front, citrus, yeast, malt in the back. Barest hint of sweet. Body/carbonation are perfect, especially for style. Finish is like flavor, good burps, tang lasts forever, slightest alcohol warmth. Can't say it's very drinkable, more sippable. Excellent gueuze."
"Well rounded gueuze for me. No problem finishing off the bottle."
""
"Timmermans exquisite Oude Gueuze demonstrates what's best about the blend of Lambics that prefer more of a younger and tarter taste over that of the more elden leather and must. Although I often enjoy a pep of vinegar in such beers, its seem that this ale avoids such polarizing taste and prefers the effects of cellar-like Brettanomyces and the clean lactic tartness of Lactobacillus instead- clean and dry sour refreshments are the rewards."
""

"Tart, puckering and way more sour than I expected. Strong sour acidity but not harsh or acetic. Dry with crisp, champagne-like effervescence and a very strong citric acid flavor. Prominent lemon juice flavor with lingering acetic vinegar but its not solvent like at all. Slightly earthy and musty with a decent lactic presence but overall not too funky. Some light fruit sweetness as well. Feels like there is some artificial sweetners in there. Dry finish. Decent sourness but not very complex and the mouthfeel falls off toward the end of the palate. A decent attempt at the style but kind of tame(once your palate adjusts to the initial sour shock) and one dimensional."
""
"Sourness comes out of nowhere on this one and lays a surprising slap across my face...in a good way. Acidic to be sure, but doesnt hold the malt and overall complexity many of the finer gueuzes show. I figured the brett would be stronger than the bacteria based on the nose, but it is exactly the opposite here - the brett is hidden on this one. All that said, I am enjoying this one more than I thought I would and for someone who hasnt met a beer that is too sour, it fits the bill well. I like it, in fact I think I will pick up a couple more. More intense than Cuvee Rene, though not as well rounded."
""
"D) Tastes ok, but it isn't too impressive on the whole."
""
""
""
"O - What a bite! It was worth a try but not one I'd go back to."
""
""
""
"Hazy and golden, pours with a very healthy head for a lambic. Aroma of bubble gum and sour cherries. Very tart, dry, and light bodied. High carbonation. Sour grain with some slight sour fruit and oak at the finish. Leans toward the sour side, even for lambics."

"D: This was a great gueuze, but not for the faint of heart (or anyone who isn't already a fan of this sour style). It had wonderfully bold but complex scent and taste. It showed an old world character that most modern sours can't replicate. The body was perfect for the style, helping make it easier to drink despite the intense finish. Would likely age for decades, and would probably improve with extra time. Impressive."
"Overall a solid example of a gueuze, though nothing that stands out above the rest. Got this on sale for $6.99 and i'm glad i did. For that price, i'd buy another."
""

""

"This beer poured a nice light gold color with a small white frothy head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very sour with hints of lemon and musty. Tastes very sour and bitter with a dry, crisp finish. Could use some sugar to cut the intense sourness of the Lambicus."
""
"Light body and easy to drink, pretty refreshing."

"O - one of the good gueuze."
""
""
""
"I haven't had a ton of Gueuze, but this is not my favorite. Way too dry and one dimensional. I like my lambiques with a touch more sweetness to counteract the acidity and with more malt character. It doesn't taste like pure bile (Like Jolly Pumpkins entire line-up), but it's not far removed. I wouldn't bother buying this again and wouldn't recommended it even to people who like lambics."
"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass, produced on 4/17/12. This pours a slightly light yellow straw color with a massive off white head which quickly dissipates and leaves nothing. The smells are of funk, vinegar, ripe cherries, malt. The feel is medium with high carbonination. The taste is good, very vinegar like sour, some funk, maybe a little brett, very acidic, my girlfriend thought it reminder her of bile, I find it quite good though. ."
"Overall: tart and ... tart. But refreshing and drinkable nonetheless. There are not a ton of gueuzes available in the United States, so I will take what we can get."
""
" O: this is a very nice gueze, really like the tartness and the way the mouthfeel works with this brew.... If your a fan of a good gueze deffiantly give this a whirl."
""
""
""
"The smell and taste were of bruised cooking apples that had gone sour: vinegarous from start to finish: even the most toothless cider freak I know would have had trouble finnishing off this brew. Glad I didn't pay much for it and also glad I opened it with family and not beer geek mates."
""
""
"I saw this for $12.49 at a store and said fuck it, glad I did. There was a huge pop when I opened it and then the bottle started gushing. The first wine glass I poured up was bright yellow with a huge white pillow of a head. I'm used to gueuze being orange but this was quite yellow. Aroma was interesting, brett and a bit of mineral. The flavor was nice, hint of brett, mildly sour, touch of lemon, very much a gueuze but also struck me as being similar to Jolly Pumpkin Bam Biere. Weird. Overall I am glad I picked this up but won't be buying any more. I will say that this might be a tad better than Cuvee Rene but is not close to the Hanssens/Girardin/Cantillon/3F/Tilquin level."

"Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some acidic and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with an acidic finish on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
"O: A flavorful, well balanced gueuze. Solid, but not extraordinary."
""
"O: A pretty good gueuze, would seek it out again as well as the other Timmermans gueuzes."
"o - Overall a really nice funky and tart gueuze. Nose is funkier and the taste is tarter, but I liked it quite a bit. Would certainly buy this again."
""
"I was surprised by this one. Good stuff."
"O: Easy to drink. especially for the style - this would be a good beer for someone to get started in this style due to the light amount of tartness. Very refreshing and even sessionable (probably the only beer in this style that I have said that about). Enjoyable and I would be happy to drink this one again."
""
"O: Even with a very careful pour, pouring this resulted in approximately 90 percent head and 10 percent beer. It’s quite easy to drink and is especially refreshing when compared to other beers in the style."
""
""
""
"Smells like a funky tripel, but drinks like a well-blended and delicate gueuze. It's definitely something special. I'll probably round up another couple bottles before it disappears."
""
"Overall pretty nice, nice acidity, nice funk, good tart fruit, dry, tasty, but a little yeasty. it's a fairly good gueuze but not phenomenal compare to many of the others you can get for about the same price."
""
"Overall I really enjoyed This beer. I love sours and this is the extreme version of a sour."
"Drink- Its a nice queuze but doesnt leave me saying OMG! Lacked a bit of funk but had a nice sour/lactic flavor. I think with time this could become amazing."
"O: This was decent enough to drink, but too much sweetness and a frothy mouthfeel detract from the experience. The pleasant funk in the aroma is nowhere to be found in the taste also."
"Overall this is a great gueze for the price. Will buy this again if I can get it."
""
"O: A good sour beer, the lack of funk and so-called Belgian terrior makes this taste a lot more ""American"" than most Belgo-made gueuzes. Pricey, but it's nice to see another true gueuze on the market."
""
"I rarely open bottled with them pointed away, but I was at the dentists and wanted to do it classy style, so I pointed it away from me and as soon as the cage was twisted loose, the cork fired out and made a dent in the siding of the house. Fucking ridiculous. Didn't foam over much though. Pours a turbid tangerine yellow with some fleeting white foam. Nose is funky and sour with plenty of co2, lemon and pepper. Flavor is Nicely tart without being puckering - grain and hot carb with some soda flavor and a good bit of metal and brett flavor. Thin with hi carb and sharp off dry finish. Meh, for a gueuze this isn't really up my alley."
""
""
"Overall: The taste profile is good but it's based on the Citrus notes and lacks the complexity of the very upper echelon. But the price is very good for a gueuze and while it has simple flavor profile it's a good tasting beer."

"750ml bottle -2008 ltd ed-. Timmermans Flute glass. Enjoyed several times since dec´09. Looks like a lemon candy in color. Foggy. Short & fading froth –just a thin layer lasts on surface. Barrel aromas: moldy wood, fresh grass & moss. Sour fruit flavor yields to an sparkling explosion, no bitterness. Dry palate. Lasting acidic sensation does no lingers to throat. Tastes like Ribeiros & Alvariños – Spanish Galician acid white wines- without sourness associated with grape tannins. Excellent company for parties & celebrations. Should be served at a very low temperature. Suggested pouring: short drops into a Pint glass. Perfect pairing: “lacón con cachelos” – cooked jam with red hot pepper baked potatoes-, barbecue ribs or spiced grilled meat. Note: bottle could be aged in cellar for 25 years ."

"overall, meh. not really impressed. i would not actively seek out more."
"Shared with caSSino the night before Brewvival! Bottled 12/16/10! Served from bottle into into a Drie Fonteinen gueuze glass. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the lacing. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, funk, lemon, citrus, lemon rine, tart, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, funk, citrus, lemon rine, tart, sour, and earth. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a really nice brew. The aroma on this one was pretty inviting and really nice. The flavor was the standout on this brew as it was really nice and acidic as you would expect from the style. All the right flavors were present and made themselves known. A definite must try if you get the opportunity."
""
"O - Compared to some of the other gueuze's we were drinking this one was not up to par. It had some good qualities but I doubt I would spend a bunch of money to get one for myself."
"D - Really drinkable, and shockingly good for a Timmerman's product. My friends liked this quite a bit even though they were lambic n00bs. It lacks the complexity of some of the best lambics, but it's competitive with Boon, Hanssens, et al."
"Overall, this seems to be a fairly underrepresented and underrated gueuze. Pleasurable and generally on target across the board, though not ""perfect"" compared to Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, etc. Would definitely pick one up again if available and in the mood. Retailed $14.99 for a 750cl bottle, whereas a bottle of Girardin, Drie Fonteinen, or other gueuze are that price for a 375cl bottle."
"This is a light bodied brew with an excessive amount of carbonation. It is very lively and bubbly in the feel. The alcohol is seemingly nonexistent. Fairly decent across the board but on a day like this, it paled in comparison to some of the other geuze offerings sampled."
" The flavor is mild yet pleasant in most ways with dry wheat sourness with lemony sweet tart and low puckering flavor. There is a mild sweet pineapple tinge with gentle spice accent and slight hint of honey along with the sour notes. Overall a very good beer, I was pleased to try the drinkability is pretty high even if it is not over the top in the sour department"
""
"Golden orange yellow hue. Solid mouth watering lactic sour nose. Good amount of funk. Wet wood and mold straw. Lemons and dusty library books. Flavors are mouth puckering and tasty. Lemon and modest funk. Medium body. The rest of the Timmermans line is garbage but this is a shining star. Very worthy gueuze in my book."
""
"Mouthfeel is dry and smooth. Overall, pretty good."
""
"Pours a clear gold body with a white head. Acidic, funky aroma with notes of green apple. The flavor is nica and sour. The acid is medium soft which keeps it from being overly aggressive. Crisp carbonation perfectly pairs with the acidity. Not the most complex or layered Gueuze, but is has an enjoyable sourness to it with some nice fruit character. Would make an excellent intro to the style."
""
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent example of the style. I certainly prefer a gueuze that is more on the wild side and makes you pucker. This one is not quite a sweet as Lindeman's Gueuze (Not the Cuvee Renee), but it is getting close. I guess this one is made more to appeal to the masses, which is fine. I will stick with Girardin and such if I want a Gueuze to savor."
""
"Overall, pretty impressed. This is much better than the fruit lambics released by this brewery!"
""
"Thin body with bubbly carbonation. Very dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very tasty gueuze. Very acidic, lots of citrus."
"Overall – An interesting lambic for sure. Never had one with so much citrus acid. Not as funky as I thought it would be. Not getting much funky brett. It’s definitely a great great extremely acidic beverage! I think that the high level of carbonation takes away from the depth of flavors that may be deep in this beer. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this again when I want something extremely acidic!"
"Overall, I really wanted to like this one but it's a bit of a mess IMHO. Going to try some other gueze here next and hope they are better. Don't recommend. Rotation - avail now in TX. Rotation - one was enough [N;N]"
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of wheat with some tart lemons, Belgian yeast and some light funk. A very nice smelling gueuze. The flavor is very tart and acidic. I get a lot of sour lemons notes, as well as some horseblanket funk, wheat and Belgian yeast. There is also a little bit of white pepper mixed into the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice gueuze. Glad to have this one available here in Texas."
"The flavor is overcome with a strong citric and lactic acidity. Green apple is strong as is the lemon rind character. The funk is basically gone, leaving behind an acidic brew without any real complexity. Light body and high carbonation. Brisk acidic finish. Decent enough, but not something I would go after again."
"Not a very good gueuze. I don't prefer the lactic, cheesy stuff and this beer had other crazy things going on."
"Poured from a 750 into a wine glass. Pretty nice for just over $10. Much nicer than their Tradition Gueze. Pouirs a nice golden tan with a thin white head. Nose has a mix of sour yeast and funks. Palate is well balanced, but also has a good amount of tartness. Crisp, clean body drinks well."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottling date of 12/16/2010. Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy light gold color with a couple inch fizzy carbonated white head that went away quickly. Aroma seems light to me, the brew smells like tart apples, oak, straw, lemon peel, funk and a bit of an earthy aroma. The sour lemon/lemon peel taste is dominant, and there's also some green apple, oak and funk noticable. But overall, I think the lemony flavors overpower the other ones. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it has high carbonation and also a dry finish. I think it's a decent enough brew, but there are other gueuzes I would buy again before this one. $14.99 a bottle."
"I don't know if I can finish this 750 by myself, but every sip leaves me wanting more."
"T: decent beer, spritzy, horseblanket middle of the road but respectable, not incredibly dry but good late taste pucker factor"
"O-Lower carbonation and a bit more attention paid to the more nuanced flavors would make a big difference. Gueuze is all about nuance, and this beer is very blustery and to the point. Still, this beer is leaps and bounds above every other beer I've had from Timmermans."
"O: A respectable but underwhelming gueuze considering other offerings on the market."
"(D)- A big sour profile. I am rather impressed with this considering Timmerman's very poor fruited lambic line. I look forward to seeing what time will do to this one."
"O: A good gueuze but not a great one. Nicely sour and refreshing, though."
"(O) This was pretty fresh and VERY sour because it's so fresh. I'd like to see what a couple of years would do to this one."
"O: Not a bad gueuze, especially at the entry level, competes quite well with Lindemans Cuvee Rene, and I think gets the slight edge at this moment. Pretty refreshing sour for the summertime, not to mention that it is affordable and fairly easy to get as well. Not the best, but certainly a well made beer."
"Glad to see Timmermans can still turn out a traditional product. This far surpasses any of their low-tier sweetened fruit sodas masquerading as ""lambic""."
"A very nice yellow-gold with a dense white head with great retention and lacing, this is a nice looking gueuze. The nose, OTOH, is rather awful. Smells like corn, or to be more accurate, KoRn. Vegetal, sweet and harsh with a solvent character, this is rather nasty. The palate is similar.Sweet, sour and lemony with oxidized malt and for a first for me, at least from a gueuze, this is even a little flabby. Some early reviews mention plenty of lactic character, that is not something I found in my bottle. Sour and drying with a little sweetness on the finish, this is rather bad. So bad, in fact, that I think I'm being generous with my grades."
"Golden hue with no head and a white collar around the liquid. Very tiny bubbles of carbonation. It tingles the tongue. Very turbid looking gueuze almost. I wonder what it would take to clear this beer after reading reviews. Smells eggy and lactic. It tasted a little one dimensional. Odd for a gueuze. More like an unblended lambic. Tastes unrefined and doesn't seem like a gueuze to me."
"Thanks to Todd for sharing this one with me! Hazy golden pour with a thick and fizzy egg shell colored head. Aroma is white grapes, green apples and white wine. Tart and refreshing. Not super complex but still really solid. If this was an American sour or gueze it would be extremely hyped"
"Bottle: Poured a medium slightly hazy yellow color lambic with a huge foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of light barnyard notes with nice tart notes and some very light oak. Taste is a nice refreshing mix between notes of tart and oak with a mix of green apple and light barnyard notes. Body is about average with great carbonation. Not the most complex lambic out there but a thousand time better then the other crap they brew. Somewhat reminiscent of Girardin as a very refreshing lambic though lacking the complexity."
"I perhaps prefer my Gueuzes to have a touch more complexity, a bit more bracing acidity, and be more funky, but this is still a very nice Gueuze. If this were widely available it would easily give the newer vintages of Lindeman's Gueuze Cuvée René a run for their money. A very enjoyable beer, especially for anyone who loves Lambics."
"D: A nice well balanced Gueuze that has a little of everything in a Gueuze. This may be a good first time Gueuze - since it isn't quite as dry as Cantillon's Gueuzes."
"Slightly aggressive carbonation on the tongue for the most part, very carbonated. Easy to drink overall, even with the level of acidity although a whole bottle might hurt in the end."
"This cork came off more fiercely than any other one I have ever seen, thank goodness it was not pointing at anybody, only lost four to five ounces thankfully, originally I was told this was an older vintage which is partially true, it is an older lambic but it was bottled this year for the celebration of Spontaneous Fermentation in May, it was made in very limited quantities and will only be brewed one time, wish I had more as I think this one will be even better once it has some age under its belt in the bottle too, recommended"
