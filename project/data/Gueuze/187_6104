Carbonation somehow overlocks the acidic sourness, finishing with a dry, slick aftertaste. Lime and apple sourness hit the palate in a dry but pleasant, uncomprimising way. Requires alomst room-temperature to reveal its sour, fruity layer, but starts to get really convincing then. Still, finish is defined by metallic hints and sour brett flavors, a bit watery, then ending quite tart.","aleigator","Saturday at 08:36 AM"

This isn't like the great fruit forward lambics everyone has had, this is bringing much more than just one dominant fruit flavor.","BradtheGreat7","Friday at 05:44 AM"

4.84,18.6,4.75,5,4.75,5,4.75,"Lemony tart nose with hints of wet horse blanket. The barnyard nose is more restrained in this than some other gueuzes. It pours hazy light golden straw with a persistent, very stiff, rocky, finely bubbled pure white 3” foam cap. The beer has a big citrus character with lemon standing out with just enough sweetness to prevent your mouth from puckering. Overall it is very dry and refreshing. The body is incredible – very creamy, smooth and effervescent with a very fine bead. It improves nicely with age.","pat61","Mar 17, 2015"

The pour produces 1.5 fingers of champagne like, rapidly declining, effervescent, white head that recedes to a solid 1/8th inch cap of dense foam leaving wisps of lacing. Aroma is dominated by sour apples, oranges & tart lemons backed by barnyard wet hay, Brett yeast mustiness & phenolic hints with something like lime sherbet mixed with blue cheese & a little skunk hint buried underneath. Taste is very sour & dry. Phenolic with Brett like barnyard funk, orange, lime & very tart green apples mix with sherbet cream. Finishes smooth, mellow, fruity & bitter but the flavours are short lived producing an aftertaste that is a rapidly fading wet hay bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry, slightly chalky, bracingly tart & very crisp with a faint prickle & astringency.","mothmanscott","Jan 05, 2015"

A good amount of lacing. Lots of visible carbonation. Aroma is lemon rind, with a hint of grassiness. Reminiscent of sparkling pear juice, with more subtle pear notes. A ton of tartness. Very heavy on the green apple. A little bit of metallic funkiness. An interesting blend. Taste features a good deal of sourness up front. Sour green apple. A bit of yeast. Very crisp and highly refreshing . The sourness is not overpowering, and actually leaves a pleasant tangy resin on the tongue. Light-medium body. Lots of carbonation, but man does this one go down easy. Very crisp and refreshing. Although the sourness makes it difficult to chug, it is very easy to rapidly sip on this one.

Uncorking it I was hit with a loud pop from all of the carbonation and bright notes of apple and pear on the nose. After pouring it I was able to appreciate its flavor much more. It has bright notes of crisp apple and a slight undertone of bread with a funky kick to it as well. On the palate it has wonderful rich fruit flavor of apple, pear and peach with a sour tone to give it a tangy flavor. Also, there are wonderful undertones of oak and bread all tied together with a funky tang to give it weight. hopefully after I sample other beers in this category, I will be able to broaden my palate and appreciate them more. However, for now I really love it!","AyeMito","Sep 02, 2014"

Aroma of fruit and sourness are evident immediately on opening the bottle, which is both crown capped and corked, kinda classy. Aroma in the glass is similar, sour apple and grape with funky yeast. Flavor is lemon citrus, apple and grape juice, very tart with wild yeast funkiness. Finishes tart and funky with hints of woodiness. Nice active carbonation makes it look good in the glass and gives a nice mouth feel. The tart fruit and yeast funk were actually not too much more intense than other old lambics, which worked well for me. I'm not a big sour fan, but wanted to try this style, and this satisfied my taste for a champagne like, light sour ale. A fairly classy looking bottle and it looks great in the glass. If I liked sours a bit more, this would be in my fridge all the time.","LiquidAmber","Jun 26, 2014"

Pours with a rich 2+ finger head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving the slightest amount of foam on the surface of the beer and lacing on the sides of the glass. Nice sour (think green apple), citrusy aroma; made me want to taste the beer. Starts slightly acidic and citrusy, the progresses to a nice smooth sour finish that is slightly tart at the end. I found the taste refreshing and thirst-quenching. Light to medium body, lots of light carbonation that leaves a slight tingly sensation in your mouth.

3.32,-18.6,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Overall I thought this was a decent beer and as far as I can tell I think it's a pretty average example of the style and it doesn't really have any tastes or aromas that I think are really well done, it kind of falls right in the middle and that skunky and overly earthy aspect doesn't help. This beer didn't have good drinkability, it wasn't too smooth, not too clean, pretty crisp, slightly prickly, not too filling and the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and I think half is a little more than enough for me and I'm glad that I'm splitting this bottle with my brother and there's no way I would want to drink another one in a row. What I like the most about this beer was the appearance, it was pretty good and to me it was the highlight of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the skunky aspect and the overly earthy flavors, if this beer didn't have those it might be a lot better. I would buy this beer again, but I would make sure it's a pretty fresh bottle since I don't think aged was too kind to this beer and as it stands now I don't think I would recommend it. All in all I was disappointed with this beer, I had heard good things about and I thought it would turn out to be a good sour, but it just had too many off aspects and in the end that really hurt this beer. This just might be my least favorite Gueuze and my least favorite beer from this brewery. Better luck next time guys, this one just wasn't for me, but I hope to try a fresher bottle in the future.","StoutHunter","May 31, 2014"

Aroma is acidic, funky, sour fruit, some barnyard with vinous overtones like balsamic vinegar. Taste starts with lemon and pina colada, quickly shifts to sour vinegar, ripe honey, white grape, gooseberry, unripe bramble fruit, all tied together by an earthy funk that at times veers into unpleasant pukey territory but this is probably my inexperience with lambic. Its gets better and more interesting as I tough it out. All acid and no bitter. This has a reputation as a good "starter" gueuze and I'd recommend it as such. Morbidly curious regarding what a more advanced gueuze would taste like. Underneath the sour persists a pleasant tropical fruitiness and some cork. Not too hard to track down if you want to dabble in this style.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 17, 2013"

This is definitely a light bodied, effervescent, straightforward sour that's quite approachable. However, it has a bit too much sweetness and lacks the super dryness I look for in good gueuzes.

4.09,0.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a very light copper color, bordering on light orange and dehydrated piss yellow. A fizzy white and rocky head appears and quickly fizzles away like a soda, leaving a light scrim and ring on the glass. The beer’s body is very cloudy, with haze hiding all of the other side of the glass from view. Carbonation bubbles are a constant stream running up from the bottom of the glass. On the nose the beer smells richly funky, with spicy hay, light fruit leather, and heavy brett smells. Light smells of cherry are also present in the sweet fruit leather smell. The beer tastes sweet and fruity with wonderful barnyard funk in the beginning of the taste. Tart flavors are light and controlled, but lovely, and lemon notes definitely come through in the tart taste. The beer begins light grass and hay, moving into barnyard funk and light fruit leather before opening into lovely lemon characters and then moving into more barnyard hay and the supposed “horse-blanket” flavor. The aftertaste is grassy with nice hay notes and as it warms there are also notes of wheat spice and light banana in the esters. On the mouth the beer feels sharp with carbonation before mellowing into a medium to light body with nice tart puckering in the mouth. The mouth is left quite clean with only a slight scrim of saliva. Overall this is a solid gueuze, some nice barnyard character, and some great balance between the tart, sweet, and funky flavors. This beer is a success from Lindemans, with some great lemon characteristics. A must try for sour fans.","Maxwell","Dec 15, 2012"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste is quite tart at first, with the sour being mostly lactic acid and some minor aetic acid tones. After 2 sips the beer is tart but never goes overboard on the sour. No aggresive tartness. This is one of the greatest benefits of this beer, it is tart but never mouth puckering. The beer nicely balances the tartness with enough body. There are nice fruity, earthy flavors which are backed up by a subtle wood taste. The beer is quite drinkable and for me a very rounded gueuze.","Absumaster","Dec 15, 2012"

Aromas of huge sour apple, pear, lemon, grass, wet hay, leather, vinegar, earth, pepper, funk, and yeast spiciness. Fantastic aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of tart lemon, pear, apple, grass, earth, wet hay, pepper, herbal, light funk, and yeast spices. Fair amount of earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, pepper, herbal, grass, hay, and earth on the finish for a bit. Moderately dry on the finish. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying tartness or acidity at all. Very moderate and refreshing amount of tartness. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very crisp and lightly acidic mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very excellent Gueuze! Very well balanced with good complexity; very smooth and crisp to drink.

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, fruit, funk, and lemon rine. The flavor was of sweet malt, lemon rine, lemon zest, citrus, sour, tart, earth, and funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were really well balanced and intense. This made the brew really easy to drink and rather enjoyable for myself. Crushed the 750 mL without any problem. Could probably have drank a bit more, but I’m not a TOTAL lush. Get your palate on this Gueuze lovers… You won’t regret it.","thagr81us","May 01, 2012"

At times I felt like I was biting into an unripe lemon, and other times I felt like I was drinking a beer that was a byproduct of a sweaty, funky brewer.

The lack of head and lace combined with the absence of cork sounds make me think there is a carbonation issue at hand. Smell is of cork, damp wood, and some funky/sour aromas. Taste is mainly of funk and sour flavors but pretty tame overall. A bit acidic in the throat. This beer has almost no carbonation with a pretty flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good gueuze as is but I have had other bottles of this that were much better (and more carbonated). I am sure there is some sort of issue with this particular bottle.

Taste is of citrus (mostly lemons?) as well as the noticeable barnyard funk. Not overpowering in terms of sourness, but still provides a lingering reminder in the cheeks while remaining crisp and refreshing. Light to medium-bodied and high carbonation gives this a nice lively mouthfeel. Inexperienced with the style, so waited until my 2nd bottle to give this a review.

The taste is pretty good, I get mostly the tartness at first, but its more mellow than I expected (I've never had this fresh so I figure its mellowed out because of the age), after the initial tartness, I get a little fruity sweetness. This is way better than the overly sweet fruit lambics they also produce, too bad its so far to find around where I live (Framboise is everywhere though).

That sour acidic taste is no longer something I'm avoiding, but rather something I'll actively seek out. Brews like this challenge one's perceptions of what a beer is, and the rewards are well worth the exploration.

The flavors in this were pretty straightforward, but they were intense and balanced- that is if you prefer your sours to lean more toward the barnyardy side of things- and the brew itself wasn't puckeringly tart either.

Nose is mildly funky, lemon, green apple, skins of an unripe green grape, dried citrus fruit character and a mild sour note. Some general champagne-like character. Taste is quite tart off the bat - acetic, lemon and orange zest. Very dry, and mildly wheaty. Flavour is somewhat short lived on the palate, although the tart feel lingers well on into the finish. This helps quite a bit in terms of helping you pull this back to your mouth for more! Highly effervescent and active on the palate, and this helps add a substantial refreshing characteristic to this.

Strangest of all, this aroma is actually kind of pleasant once you adjust to it. Lemony and tart, the sourness reminds me of that in plain yogourt but much, much stronger.

The aroma is malty with sourish fruit notes: citrus and lemon peel along with spicy peppercorn and coriander. Ample Brett aroma. Flavor is rather sour and tart; definitely funky but the Brett does not overpower the taste, as the fruit and spice notes come through also. It becomes sweeter as the palate adjusts.

The beer is muted in aroma, even after being warmed. the aroma is kind of like moldy lemon that rolled around in damp hay. The beer definitely has the puckering lemon taste with hints of must and a little metallic bitterness. This is not the most complex gueuze, but the sourness is pleasing and refreshing.

4.02,-1.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Mine pours an opaque, pale gold with a one finger head that dies away quickly, whereas the pour I did for the lady had a much bigger head and good retention. On the nose there seems to be lemon, dry straw, something everyone seems to call funk, and maybe some cyprian latakia. In the mouth, the tartness attacks the very tip of the tongue upon touching it, a strange sensation for me. There are green apples and sour lemons, and the straw seems to disappear a little bit on the tongue. The tartness seemed to hang on forever even though the brew goes down very quickly. It's a super dry, champagne type finish, slightly acidic, with some bread starting to peek out just at the very end. There is an awful lot going on in this brew. This isn't something I could drink every day, but once in a while this would hit the spot for sure. Totally unlike most beers I seem to like, and I'll be looking into more sours because of this.","EricCioe","Mar 25, 2011"

In the mouth it feels pretty average but an added tart stickness makes it special. This reminds me of a Berliner Weisse without the woodruff or raspberry.

Nose is nice and elegant and trademark lindeman's, which is good, but I'm sorry to say the whole thing seems a little safe and doesn't seem to speak volumes of the place it was made or the person it was made by. Very floral and the oak is a new oak smell, like fresh, french oak. Tart lemon and apple that seems red in the nose and green in the taste. Also a touch of earth and mushroom and must. It touches on everything that is good and proper for the style and comes off dry and refreshing with a little pucker. One of the more affordable and obtainable guezes out there.

This beer really reminds me of a dry white wine more than any beer I have had so far. There also seem to be some faint spice and citric acid notes.

Some good lemon notes and grassy notes are there, but (is there brett in here?) there are also other notes that don't appeal to me much--armpit and must. I tend to prefer the funky flavor/aroma to the sweaty one. Taste however is pretty good. This one is puckeringly tart with some crisp lemon zest flavor. It really slaps you in the face. There's a bit of pale malt behind it too. I feel like I'm more of a fan of the sour/vinegar side of the spectrum rather than the tart side of the spectrum. Not bad at all, though.

The flavor is nice, thought it might be a little more sour based on the nose but the tart fell is very welcoming. Has a lemon citrus flavor that seems to mix well with the wheat flavors I pick up. Also a funky flavor is there that seem more like a farmhouse flavor which goes well with everything. The carbonation goes a long way with the feel, almost champagne like, dry finish.

Not very much lacing at all, but there's bits of it around the glass. Aroma is green apple, funk, vinegar and some lemon zest. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's nice and tart with some funk noticable too. It's not too strong, it has the right amount of tartness to make this brew very enjoyable. Mouthfeel/body is light and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and it's easy to finish a bomber of this. This brew reminds me that I need to buy more gueuzes, as it's a style I like but don't drink very often. It's worth buying if you see it somewhere.","bluejacket74","Dec 29, 2009"

4.1,0.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The aroma is dry, lemony, tart, and a relatively light level of Belgian funk. As far as gueuze goes, this has a lot of the attractive features and avoids the more complex, perhaps more esoteric and "acquired taste" type of barnyard funk. Tastes lemony with a tart yeasty character with a touch of grass. Nicely moderate-high sourness with a clean finish for the style. A really good tasting beer, though it lacks some of the complexity seen in other gueuzes--little funk of any kind, seems to be mostly lactic sourness. Almost like an imperial Berliner Weisse. It is tasty though, and for the price point, half to a third the price of other respectable gueuzes. Light bodied with tight, high carbonation. What it lacks in complexity, it definitely makes up for in terms of drinkability, one could probably kill a 750 alone, though it is always better to share with a friend.","vacax","Dec 13, 2009"

This is a real punch in the mouth gueuze that leaves a film of tartness on the teeth, like licking a lemon. In fact, it's a bit like mixing with lemon juice with a good, dry champagne, which sounds appealing to me, anyway. There's some dry, neutral oak in the finish and a tiny touch of horse blanket-brett flavor peeks out. Otherwise, it's mostly lemon/grapefruit rind tart. While it's not my favorite gueuze, it's still quite good and comes in at a much lower price than the competition.

Taste is of sour and tart lemon zest backed with hay and funk. Strange hint of salt on the palate and champagne like taste on the palate after a few sips as my tounge gets used to it. Body is light with prickly champagne like carbonation, pretty dry finnish and suprisingly little aftertaste. Once you get past the strong sour and funk flavors, this really is impressive.

As soon as I pop the cork I hit by an (delicious) aroma of pungent, sour, funky aroma, citric lemon, must, dirt, etc. Everything expected from a gueze, but not quite as complex or tart as exceptional ones. First sip is extremely sour and musty, followed by citric lemon and earthy notes and as it warms up the finish is slightly sweet before the high carbonation cleanses the palate and leaves a dry, mild sour finish. Overall body is lighter side of medium with an effervescent quality.

The nose is sour, no question, lemon skin, smarties candy, vinous grape juice, and hints of mild barrel. Much is the same in flavor, bright tongue assaulting tartness, acidic lemon notes, some light oxidized wood and lemon-head candy. The beer remains dry and full of carbonation. Easy to drink and a wake up call to the taste buds, my only complaint in the mouthfeel dept is the long lingering throat coating feeling that develops over just a couple of sips. Absolutely not for everyone but a Lindemans Cuvee Rene is s MUST TRY for the novice who is too hesitant to dive into a 15-50$ bottle of Cantillon or 3F, this brew will give you a pretty good idea of what the style is about and i you're down, spend the money on the other guys, its totally worth it.","ATPete","Oct 13, 2009"

Taste consistent with nose - exactly as anticipated; quite a bit of citric acid on this one.

Smell is a bit of a toned down lambic. Nice wafts of sour apple and earthy cheese rind funk that never gets too offensive or out of hand. Sometimes you want that outlandish deep funk in a gueuze, but it is nice to know you have a reliable measure of moderation to fall back on in this beer. I respect it for that. Taste is more on the sour side than the funk, more granny smith apple than cheese rind. Highly carbonated and very high on the tongue. Champagne like and almost bubbly. Complements the dryness of the beer very well. For the style, drinkablity is as high as it gets. I like this beer very much as an in between beer when enjoying other more extreme lambics.

The taste is very approachable. It's somewhat tart and has a solidly bitter background. It's say that the sourness is pallet-cleansing rather than mouth-puckering. It's like a gateway gueuze.

Strong mustily sour smell, not in a fruity way, almost more in a bacterial way (though obviously not really offensive). Taste isn't really sour apple, but more acidic, more vinegaric. More of a barnyard feel. Very try, like a very tangy saison. At first, overwhelmingly sour, but a bit overly ascetic. Sticky coating despite thin feel, once the sour subsides there's not much in the way of substance. Taste after is kind of cheesy, almost cottony.

Lemon fruit, lemon rind, red grapefruit. The sour flavors completely obscure any malt sweetness. Only a slight vinegar component.

Even when held to the light, nothing will show through. The aroma is musty at first, then with tart citric notes that come fluttering in. There are also spicy notes that almost remind me of the nutmeg aromas from a pumpkin pie. The aroma is very complex but yet oddly straightforward. While it seems that there are many notes coming from the beer, with every new whiff something else comes through. All the aromas are straightforward. The taste is again musty up front with just a slight bit of funk. Then its cheek puckering citric tartness, the kind that hits you right behind the jaw. This is really good. The mouthfeel is crisp and very dry, with just a light carbonation that lends itself to the dryness. This is a great beer. Very well crafted by the brewers at Lindemans.

4.47,9.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle corked and capped, foil wrapped. A very nice presentation. Pours a clean copper orange color with very little, if any, yeast in suspension after a careful pour. Big white, bubbly head that lasts long. Very intricate lacing in the wide-mouth goblet I've poured into. The nose is complex and pungent, but all in good ways. Decidedly musty and earthy, this beer smells of history and masterful technique. The "barnyard" scents are here in full force, along with an almost fruity sweet accent floating around to tame the pungent nature of this wild beer. This beer is far less sweet than the Lindemans Gueuze, and more accurately reflects the traditional style and nature of what a good gueuze ought to be. The palate is forcefully tart up front, with bitter fruits and straw asserting themselves early. Slight Vinegar-like character which causes the mouth to water in a wonderful way ... something I actually love in a Lambic beer. Fruity and quite acidic throughout, the gueuze warms to a slightly smoother malted wheat foundation. Finishes quite dry and lively with aggressive carbonation levels from start to finish. This is, in my mind, standard for the style and a great example of the age-old craft of producing fine, champagne-like beers through the magic of spontaneous fermentation. A truly excellent beer and a beer that redeems my hope in Lindemans ... a brewer typically known for their sugary sweet "soda pop" lambics here in America. If you buy this beer thinking it'll be something like one of those, boy are you in for a shock. A great Gueuze!","beerphilosopher","Mar 15, 2008"

It poured a cidery straw gold with a slight haze and lively head that vanished quickly. Slight yeast sediment that I left in bottle. The aroma was filled with Brett and wet cork. You can smell the seasoned oak casks like they are right in front of you. Slight hints of a fruity chardonay and soft vinegar. The taste is full of acidity and heavy tones of sour green apples. There is a raw oakiness that stands out well after the finish. The sourness is sharp right away, but leads to a very dry finish. It reminds me very much of an ultra-dry cider that I brewed a year ago. The body is thin up front, and on the sides, but holds a good amount of complexity as the swallow finishes. This is one of my first true gueuze and I can see how this would become a beer that you want to keep in stock for occasions that call for a beer like this. Not for everyone, to say the least, but I find myself honored to enjoy a beer of this complexity and craft.","ALESwhatCURESya","Mar 01, 2008"

Flavor linger sin the mouth, but that's a compliment, not a fault.

The nose has a cidery note and a bit of hard, minerally oxidation, but the main element is a winey note, something like a citrus infused dry vermouth. And there's also a lovely, scratchy, wild barnyard note. On the palate, highly acidic, especially at the front and end of the palate, with big lemon juice flavors and a slightly seedy, yeasty note. Mouthfeel is puckering and intense, but not so much so as some other gueuzes out there. Still, that lack of punch actually makes for an exceedingly drinkable ale that combines a touch of smoothness (for the style) and richness with plenty of acidity, citrus, and barnyard for the classic gueuze characteristics.

I wasn't overly impressed with the bland pale body, but it did have a healthy looking amount of carbonation. Not a very strong smell, but there is an apple cider and vinegar scent most predominantly. The scent is magnified in the flavor. It's a strong sourness of cider, vinegar and lemon which hits the tongue and numbs it up good. This feels like a sipper, but I found myself gulping it down after I noticed that sipping or gulping didn't effect the level of sourness, and I felt I might as well as drink as much of it as I could considering the cost.","JayTheFinn","Apr 22, 2007"

Very drinkable and refreshing stuff, although perhaps it lacks a bit of the complexity that you'd find in some other beers of this style.

Taking a whiff yielded a smell with a mixture of sweet and sour elements, but little of the farmhouse smells like leather or sweat found in other Gueuze Lambics. I could also detect a marigold like floral hop presence. The sip confirmed what the nose had revealed. This was quite mild for an unflavored Lambic. There was a lot of sourness of course, but it was a clean and crisp sourness like a lemon juice poured into a regular beer. Not a lot of funkiness in this one at all. The beer was crisp and light in the mouth, and was very easy to gobble down.

Chalky and very dry. The acidity is a bit more restrained than say, a Cantillon, which makes for supreme drinkability. Really, really nice.","UnionMade","Jun 07, 2006"

Its flavor seems to focus on the tartness which overwhelms any of the more subtle notes. I drank part of it with a lime to cut the overwhelming tartness.

Body of this one is decent, carbonation lighter than some, but its there. Lightly challenging flavors, tart with unripe fruit, a sense of woodiness and rose petals.

Poured a deep golden with bronze color with a pillowy white head into a traditional Belgian hexagonal tumbler. Intricate lacing left behind as the head subsides. Currant skin aroma, herbal, woody and some musty barnyard funk with an apparent acidity that is affirmed with the first sip. It's subtly sweet, followed with a fruity acidity like sour green apple and lime. Some of your more traditional lambic funk is pretty low, maybe due to the fact that it's 10 years old and had a significant time to mellow and meld flavors, but still a major role in this beer. It, overall, seems to be a little bit sweeter that other blended lambics I've tried, but a good gueuze, nonetheless. Very spritzy and well-carbonated, affirming and dry on the palate.

4.05,-0.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"As I pop the cork, an immediate enticing sour aroma springs forth from the bottle. It pours a cloudy orangish red color and has an off white head. It is definitely carbonated but not superly so. The aroma is sour with citrus notes, a bit of musty character as well. This beer is very dry and sour throughout. There is a definite Brett character as well, reminds me of a musty-leathery something or other, though the Brett character is somewhat subdued compared to other I have sampled. This beer is not as complex as some of the other traditional Gueuzes, but it is proof that Lindemans can make something other than alco-pop if they wanted to.","Gueuzedude","Nov 11, 2003"
3.18,-22.1,4,3.5,3,4,2.5,"2001 Vintage. 750mL bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep orange/brown color with two fingers of head. There is minimal lacing on this one. The smell is a little musty with some white grapes and lots of acidity. The taste starts very sour, very very sour, with a bit of a dry sherry finish. There is a slight metallic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. Due to the high acid content, I was not able to stomach too much of this one. Maybe I'll like Lindeman's sweeter gueuze better.","SheepNutz","Oct 06, 2003"

4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Quite drinkable for a gueuze and very refreshing. One of Belgium's better gueuze lambics. Seek it out, especially older vintages if they can be found. If you thought Lindemans lambics were all sweet fruit bombs, think again. This is the real deal.","Jon","Sep 24, 2003"
4.63,13.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"2001 bottling. Presented in a gueuze tumbler, this really is a beautiful beer! Light golden with a very slight haze and a big foamy white head that settles quickly to a good level for drinking. Leaves a nice lace. The aroma is very mellow and complex. Barnyard and medicinal aromas mixed with a very tart and like a nondescript fruit with no sweetness whatsoever. Very interesting and nice. On the palate, it's massive acidic sourness packed into a light body. That feeling that your teeth are being eaten away, like when you bite into a lemon. Vinous in the front. Increasingly tart as it moves to the back. More of that nondescript fruitiness is abound. Even vegetable-like character is showing up. A little old, damp, and decaying wood character here and there with cork character showing up and adding some great complexity near the end. Finish is as dry as an Arizona riverbed. This is a great gueuze, and I can't wait for more! However, as complex as it is already, it really would benefit with more aging to bring out more. I'm going to try to get some 1994 bottles soon, then perhaps my ratings will be even higher. This is an amazing beer and an amazing style. Definitely best served at cellar temp. to bring out all of its subtleties.","hyuga","Sep 10, 2003"
4.08,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"My first lambic, and I had no real idea what to expect. But I had the good fortune of drinking this unique brew along with a magnificant french chicken dinner. The lambic poured a slightly cloudy copper color with a modest white froth. The smell was more like wine really than beer, very fruity, and the taste was shall I say unusual: tart, lemony cranberry with just a hint of grassy malt. The initial tang gives way quickly, but the effervescense remains. I would not want to drink a whole lot of this stuff--couldn't afford to anyway--but what a complement to a fine dinner; better than champagne or wine as far as I'm concerned.","longpondbeerman","Aug 01, 2003"
4.5,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is a near perfect beer, but not for every beer drinker I am sure. Lambics are something of an esoteric mystery to me, but regardless I find them a style of infinite discovery. Lindemans poured a opaque golden color with a fairly descent sized head and plenty of small lace up and down. Smell was full of cranberry, grassy aroma, and a fair bit of CO2 escaping into my nose. The taste was crisp to the point of mouth puckering. There was tons of tart lemon bitterness, seltzer like carbonation, dusty as an attic and a dry assertive finish. Went perfectly with chicken and shallots cooked in a white wine cream sauce.","GreatPondBrewer","Aug 01, 2003"

4.12,1,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer is beautiful in its clarity. A light copper hue. A somewhat fizzy head to begin with turns into more of a creamy and lush looking coating in a minute. Aroma is lovely. Lemongrass, chalk, vinegar, must and tart raspberry. This is one mouth puckering lambic. The pucker quality really comes on after you swallow. As for other characteristics, I'd say this has quite a bit of acidity to it. Vinegar like. Sour apple like. And like lemon juice. There seems to be some grape like attributes as well. Maybe some grape skin. Tart raspberry comes to mind as well, although this beer is not fruity. There is a dryness present in this beer throughout. The tartness in this beer literally coats your whole mouth. Exactly what a good lambic should do.","Bighuge","Jul 03, 2003"
5,22.5,5,5,5,5,5,"Still haven't found a gueuze as good as this one. (Aging is key, though, younger bottles have been nearly as good the one reviewed above).","nomad","May 27, 2003"
4.3,5.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Peach orange hue with a light haze. Covered by an off white, persistent, creamy head that trails wisps of lace. Waft of tart, woefully upripe berry hits the nose at first, then is superceded by lactic and acetic tartness derived from mixed acid enteric fermentation. As the beer breathes, pungent, yet rounding notes of wet horse and mild woody oak surface. Mellow yeast must and hints of cheesy, aged hop add additional depth in aroma. Just a touch shy of complete aromawise. Although assertively tart allaround in flavor, an unripe, yet bright raspberry-like note permeates throughout. A pronounced combination of sharp, acetic tartness and mellower, lactic acid along with subtle chalk overshadow any trace of residual sweetness, lending a bone dry feel. Notes of hay and cork emerge mid palate along with earthy must both from the suspended primary yeast and wild Brettanomyces character. Subtle, grainy hints of wheat struggle to emerge through the dominant tartness. Although bone dry in overall profile, the mouthfeel retains an elegant crisp smoothness, and is far from thin. Finishes slightly astringent, with lingering grapeskin tannin tinged tartness. Almost a beautiful beer. The trace roughness precludes greatness, but that may change with a few years of cellaring. Delicious. Bottled 2001.","marc77","Apr 24, 2003"

I've had this beer 3 or 4 times now, and this is the first time I haven't consumed the whole 750 mL bottle myself -- and this is only because this is the first time I've lived with another beer snob, my fiancee. Great beer in every respect.","marburg","Mar 22, 2003"

Musty attic and basement with some slightly tart fruitiness as well with a bit of a grassy/hay undertone. Excellently sour and tart with lip puckering goodness that is very intense Plenty of farmish type tastes combine with the great tartness to make this an outstanding brew. Great crisp and dry mouthfeel with a relatively light medium body. I could drink this every day of the week and I probably would if I lived in Belgium.","Murph","Dec 12, 2002"
4.57,12,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Notes: Simple but has depth, flavourful but not boisterous. This brew shows little aging flaws at all and perhaps could see another decade or two without turning as long as the cork holds up. I’ll be seeking more bottles ASAP.
