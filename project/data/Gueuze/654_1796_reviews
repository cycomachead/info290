"My first gueuze. As I was hardcore wine lover started to drink beer just half year ago, I would advice to start with this type of beers when you are planning to change from wine- to beer-way :-)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Distinctly average"
""
" The taste has a slight candy-like sour lemon mixed with a light malt flavor with light yeast taste which is a mild tangy with dried sweet pineapple and a sweet/sour finish. Overall this is not bad...just average as far as the style goes ok to try."
""

""

" .i would advise to eat it with something bitter like,dark chocolate as its sweetness can be quite overwgelming without a counterbalance."

"Not the type of gueuze that i like, but not a horrible beer either. I guess it's a good introductory one into the style."

"Poured into a chalice this gueuze is clear light amber, little head with nice lacing. Aromas of weak wild microbial funk, white wine ish with apple fruitiness. Taste is very mild, more like a juice than a sour funky gueuze. Easy drinking but not very exciting, low to medium carbonation, weak bodied. Overall a cheapy."
"O - Never had a geuze like this before. Reminds me of a Faro for its sweetness. I prefer the sour varieties of this type of beer"

"I picked this up in a grocery store in Waterloo. I believe the name was Carfour. They had a great selection and the prices were amazing and with most of Europe they let you break single out of the pack. It poured amber with a red orange hue. The aroma was earthy and farm like. It had a pasture like taste with a pleasant sourness. The mouthfeel was average and had nothing to really speak of."
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, orange/tan color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight alcohol, tartness, grapes, and slight sourness. Fits the style of a gueuze. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Strong tartness and sourness as well. Tastes of grapes, hint of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, and strong tartness and sour flavor. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and body."

"Poured into a glass at a hostel-bar in Brussels. Smells like processed lambic. Very bubbly. Things were going well until I took a sip and found it to be very sweet. I am sure that my expectations made this more shocking than it had to be, but since the packaging was so traditional with a heavy glass bottle and a Belgian style cork and cage I figured it would be real gueuze. It is not however, and though I try not to hold that fact against it, I am disappointed by the lifeless sweetened fizz in my glass. I wouldn't buy this again, but if you like sweetened pasteurized gueuze by all means give it a shot! A little cheesy bread and earth in the flavor, but have to search it out amongst all that sugar."

"O: This has to be one of the easiest beers in the style and would make for a good entry-level beer into geuzes."
""
"As the beer settles on the palate, it's hard not to revisit the glass much sooner than I should. But the dryness of the beer leaves me wanting a quick return. This is a well blended sour ale that offers as much sultry taste as it does refreshment- a welcome beer in my glass in complement to any rich pork dish accompanied by a bowl of mussels- a feast that I won't soon forget. Thank you Brussels!"
"Boo - ersatz gueuze. The real thing can be so much more. This is too sweet and too clean; filtered and adulterated with sugar. Where are the complex yeasty notes and the biting acidity? Where's the puckering mouthfeel and the depth of character? It's drinkable enough, and might serve as an introduction for someone who has never tried lambic before, but otherwise it's strictly for the kids. Give it a miss."
"Overall it's a really easy drinker. Perhaps a bit of an intro to the style for Joe Average."

"My experience with the style is still limited, but this was a disappointing beer that gets an ""above average"" because it looked pretty and followed the style guidelines."

"A decent but slightly hectic gueuze when it comes to balancing out its body and flavor. Not really an fine example of what gueuzes can be, in my view. While I think it is a decent beer, I probably would not revisit it for 4 euros a bottle - which is the same price of some finer beers of this style which are available in France."
"I am curious to try the bottled version now only for comparison's sake."
"Overall: Tasty but not sour enough. a little too sweet. I like the beer though"
"A very disappointing Gueuze. I'm not sure I've had a worse one. Unbalanced, rather insipid and not at all inspiring."
"O: This beer is far from what a Gueuze tastes like in my experience. This is super sweet and syrupy."
"O: juice with alcohol added, I think they're stretching the definition of the gueuze with this one, I think it might be more aptly classified as a wine cooler."
"Beer is sweet and mildly sour, it has a grainy finish to it and overall it is kind of gross. The finish is mildly dry. Overall I will never have this beer again and I would be likely to avoid this entire brewery because of this beer."
"Commercialized products designed for mainstream appeal are fundamental opposites to the traditional, artisan products of lambic producers: One represents art, creativity, personal expression, human scale and touch, the continuity of culture and tradition; the other is driven by market-ideology, dollars and cents, mainstream appeal and commercial success. I know which side of that debate I stand - the one opposite to Mort Subite Gueuze."
"I wished it was little drier and less sweeter. but it seem to have a good sweet-sour taste, but leaning little towards sweet side."
"Nice quenching apply sour taste but the mouthfeel lets this down. A bit too smooth and silky for my liking which has a quick slippy quality. The liquid just seems too keen to slide down your throat leaving not much risidual on the tongue or the sides of your mouth. Still a bit of a pleasant surprise though."
"D - easy to find and cheap .., in Belgium. Sadly delicious and wonderful why must I fly to Europe for this."
"Drinkability: Its really not bad. Too sweet and not all that interesting (minimally sour, minimally funky). I'll not drink it again."
"This has never been one of my favorite gueuzes, but can be pretty satisfying when cold and you're in the mood for a little something lighter. Overall this was just too sweet. I've heard rumors that mort subite adds extra sugar before refermentation, but I'm not sure if that's true. My friend and I both agreed that it was just alright, and I hope my present didn't do more harm than good!"
"This was my first geuze. Interesting if not a bit simple - where was the malt balance? Is there supposed to be one? Hopefully..."
"D- I enjoyed drinking this, alcohol seems non-existent but its evidently a poor example due to the poor balance between sweet and sour, no puckering quality in the mouthfeel for a refreshing note."
"drinkability: ok"
"A bit sweeter than my anticipation of a Gueuze - is probably a Faro in disguise."
"Mort Subite pours a pleasant amber color with a nice frothy head. The beer is quite clear, which is essentially impossible to do with the traditional approach, sending off warning flags. The nose has a vinegar-like acidity, with a cider character, minimal symptoms of Brettomyces. Flavor has an apparent, though one-dimensional acidity, and, like most ""new"" gueuzes, is corrupted by the sweetness of sugar. But, unlike most ""new"" gueuzes, the sweetness does not lead to failure here; it actually adds a nice cider/apple character, with similarity to the Rodenbach Gran Cru and is actually pretty well balanced by the acidity. Ultimately this this gives it a realistic and refreshing fruitiness. I don't hate this gueuze, but I will not drink it again."
"Soft and rounded, and fairly drinkable. Would be more drinkable without all the sweetness."
"Vintage 2004. Pours a dirty, coppery shade of yellow. Aroma is funky along with sweet honey and flora including lilac. Tastes of classic Belgo-funk with a moderate sourness and pronounced floral character. Mediun bodied with a nice creamy carbonation. Quite easy to drink with a lovely funk to it. I have had this beer a couple times, this bottle was particularly tasty, and so it would seem a couple years in the bottle definitely makes this one a winner."
"I wasn't really sure how to score this as I did enjoy it. It just wasn't that exciting or interesting. Unoffesive and refreshing."
"D: This is not as overly acidic and acetic as many lambics, which gives it a bit higher level of drinkability. That said, the flavors were not outstanding, but still quite enjoyable."
"I had this as an aperitif and was actually tempted to have another one despite the great selection of other beers..."
"The acidity of Lambic is unique to here back but still very present. It also feels a touch of sugar but it is also too light to take off the drink. Probably use a fairly young lambic but, unfortunately, lack of flavor and gives a beer a bit bland though very refreshing. It appears that the version in 25cl is much sweeter than the version in 37.5 cl."
"D - I could actually drink a good amount of this, as it doesn't have the stomach melting aspects of some of the other beers of this style. Still, the overly sweet element is a little off-putting, as it's not really want I want from this type of beer."
"Overall, this is a really nice example of the style. I bought it without checking the ratings on BA and was disappointed to see afterwards that the Bros had given it a C+. I'm glad I picked this one up, though, as it's a very refreshing, subtle gueuze that's definitely worth trying."
"Drinkability is fairly high, in that it's like drinking iced tea. Too sugary and uninteresting to a real gueuze lover to session, it's a fine kiddie gueuze."
"Breakfast - 8-18-08. Served at the café in a Mort Subite Goblet by a friendly middle aged blonde. Golden, almost leaning brown with a massive stark white head despite very modest carbonation. Less acidic than most Geuze in terms of aroma, taste, and feel. Easy going yet loaded with character and quite interesting. Sourness is mild. This might be a good introduction to the style for some. Biscuity with some lemon but only mild baryardiness. Very drinkable."
"D-Easy to drink and pleasantly refreshing."
"The tatse is sweet and sour, a very nice mix you can drink a lot of."
"A pleasant and easy drinking gueuze."
"D - something to try if you like Lambics"
"Mouthfeel: Pretty low carbonation with a medium body"
"A bare skim of foam across the top, with a tiny ""string of pearls"" clinging to one side. Sweetened iced tea, honey, clover and soggy graham cracker aroma. A sweet tartness on the tongue, more soggy graham/sugar cookie, medicinal with mild paper/cardboard around the edges. Dry in the finish, it does pull the cheeks inward slightly, but nothing approaching a sour pucker. Obviously sweetened. This was just plain dull, maybe worth a try for free, but I wouldn't buy it if I saw it."
"Pours a clear amber with a decent crème head. Nose seems almost nutty. Flavor is sweet like candy with apple tones. Basically it just tastes like an artificially sweet lambic. Feel has a quite full carbonation. Liquid is slick. Okay to drink. But certainly not a traditional gueuze by any means."
"Would be an excellent choice for someone wanting to get their feet wet in the world of lambic. However, it is nowhere close to playing with the big boys."
"Pours copper colour with white head which stayed for a while. smeel is fruity - apple, raspberries + honey, really nice. Taste is sweet, fruity, apples are dominating, but it's really complex and confusing. But it's pretty tasty. Moutfeel is creamy and kinda sparkly, very balanced and pleasant brew. i would definately have more."
"Recieved this bottle from my friend Stu, its dated back to 2003. Pours a pale yellow color with little bubbles of carbonation. Smell is sweet fruit with a little bit of barnyard funkiness in the nose. Taste is very sour, this is littely like tasting some old sweet tarts that have been sitting in the sun a bit to long, tart apple and pear. Overall this was pretty good I am sure the age of this beer had aa great affect on it turning it much sour that it was before."
"I might say this is a gueuze for beginners. The aroma has moderate Belgian funkwith sweet malts in the background. It's surprisingly sweet with a honey like flavor that blends fairly nicely with the mellow barnyard elements - horse blanket and hay. There's also a bit of fruit in the flavor with white grape and lemon. The appearance is a deep, clear gold and a touch of lacing. I actually checked the label to make sure I didn't get a fruit lambic, but this is still a nice and interesting beer, just not a great gueuze."
"only the sweetness and possibly off-flavor phenolic notes detract slightly from drinkability. i gladly had two bottles of this with an acceptably-prepared serving of moules frites. for the purposes of introducing newcomers to lambic, this isn't so bad."
"Overall I have few complaints, but it just doesn't sit right in my mouth. I didn't find it exceptional and I doubt that I'd ever buy another. Of this brand, at least."
"Anyway, refreshing and I don't mind to have a couple of them."
"A lower alcohol break in the midst of a meal at Belgo Centraal in London. It is a light gold copper, with no head but great lacing. Not sure how that works, but more power to them. The smell has a hint of sourness, honey, and a light floral note. The taste is tart apples, lightly sweet, with a dry finish. It has a light body, is lightly carbonated, and slightly silky. The drinkability is the beer's strong suit. It is a great starter beer for those interested in the more unusual Belgians."
"Very drinkable but one very slight off flavor. Still very good though"
"I've never had a Gueuze before, so I thought it was about time, being a fan of the sour side of the sense of taste. Popping off the wire-encased Champagne-style cork, I got a good whiff of a nice sour-fruit aroma wafting out of the bottle, and was happy that the beer didn't come spewing out at the same time. In the glass, this Lambic appeared a light golden colour with a reddish tint, and produced a few fingers of puffy white head. The smell was very tart fruit, like cherry or kiwi, accompanied by a mellow sweetness. The taste, likewise, was well balanced between the tart fruit and the light malty sweetness, although the carbonation was a bit on the high side. The first few sips were quite intense, but after breaking in the taste buds, the remainder of the bottle went down quite smoothly. Not something I'd want to have in a large quantity over the course of an evening, but quite interesting and flavourful (if you like sour fruit) for a round or two."
"All in all a very enjoyable gueuze, in fact a great entrance for people into the style and to possibly work their way up to the real lip puckering offerings of this style. If your gut can handle the sourness it'd make a decent light session beer."
"Drinkability : gueuze correcte (je préfére la gueuze tradition)"
"Very smooth (subtly) lambic. Hard to find in the USA but worth seeking out."
"Popping the cork on this gueuze gives a nice, subtle hint of cherries and light fruit, perhaps mandarin orange and nectarine. Mort Subite pours into my glass a pale, somewhat hazy peach colour--quite attractive with these plus 30 heat waves in Alberta right now. The aroma is subtle as well: nothing is full-on here. What we get is some light fruit notes, the slightest of some tart yeasty esters, and a dryish, airy nose. Nothing terribly out of the ordinary, but rating in style, this is a very refreshing and appetising aroma. The taste is much the same, but even less tart or sweet than the aroma leads you to expect. Very light cherries or peaches, and a little light malting, plus a satisfying tartness which is quite subtle. Again, the beer is tasty and refreshing--there simply isn't much to describe about it. It works well, and has a light refreshing body and plenty of drinkability. I can't complain. It fits the style, and satisfied my thirst for a subtle, tart, lambic."
"If I must say something positive thier kriek is slightly better. Now I must go to the basement and get some Boon and or Cantillon and get this sugary taste out of my mouth."
"Mouthfeel is slick and smooth, and though it feels like the carbonation is lively, it is easy on the tongue. Easy drinking enough that you could serve this to just about anyone, but lacking in intensity in the flavours."
"A lambic without the cheek sucking sourness, I liked it."
"Drinkability: I like this beer, but hardcore gueuze purists might scoff at it. But because this one is more mellow and well-rounded, I think it would be more versatile in food pairings. I'm thinking it would make a good substitute for a German white wine."
"Sampled at Au Bon Vieux Temps in Brussels, the bottle was much like the one pictured here. It poured a clear very pale copper under a one finger off-white head with good retention and great sheets of lace. The nose was very mild, with a hint of fruit and spice. The mouth was well-carbonated and light despite the tartness. Strong raspberry flavor joined by some bready malt. No hopes were noticeable. The aftertaste was short and tart. Perhaps a bit too tangy for my beer taste, it was nevertheless quite tasty."
"Carbonation-heavy, but very enjoyable. A must for champagne and cider fans."
"Drinkability: Toned down and easy to drink."
"Poured into a tulip glass. This beer has a very light amber hue. The head eventually dissipates but leaves nice laces around the glass. It has nice carbonation, the bubbles are rising very quickly towards the surface, kind of like champagne. Smells and tastes of green apple, pickles, sour candies, cider vinegar, lemon, and ripe cheese. This is sweeter than another version I have had of this style, I think they added candi sugar to it, kind of like they do with Faro. I find this beer light bodied and realitively easy to drink. Not a huge fan of this style, but I rather enjoyed this one."
"This one is good enough to drink, and much easier to drink than the ""authentic"" lambics. It's a tradeoff- if you don't want to work, this is a good one, but it isn't as interesting as some others."
"This stuff is quite nice, I'd have it again."
"Overall, quite different than some other beers of this style that I have had. I really enjoyed this bottle. Very refreshing."
"pours bubbly yellow with thin (cm or so) but lingering head. smells sweet.. To be concise, it is ""thin, unsuprising but tasty"" on first sip. I would almost class it as some kind of ""session"" lambic as it is flavourful yet not wild and with very little after-taste afterwards. not dissappointed that I bought it but usually expect more from a lambic, the colouration (ie the clarity) does lend thoughts towards filtration however, espescially for a gueuze combo of young and old brews it would be hard to argue for this happening naturally but then again i'm no expert."
"apple sweetness, with a hint of tartness near the finish. light, refreshing mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. has hints of some sour but it's washed away with a cidery sweetness."
"Colour on this beer is a tawny red, with a thin head made of large, weak bubbles. Sweet and sour smell. Cherries, malt and 'farm' smell. Not impressed with the taste. To me, it tasted like sour Mike Ike's. No other character. Mouthfeel was dry. Not drinkable. I like sour hard candy, but not in liquid form."
"Overall: a girlie beer, good as an appetizer. If you like Geuze Lambics, this is the one for you."
"D - Pretty good. The sourness and sweetness matches well. Easy to drink, and refreshing."
"Pours a clear amber, generous off white head forms, some real nice lacing on the glass, decent retention. Smell is nice and funky, sweet and sour, some citrus, spice, barnyard and yeast. Taste is citrus, with sour, iron, sugar sweetness, some caramel in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not a great Gueuze but really not bad, very refreshing."
" Seems too over processed to me from the main stream lambic gueuze...perhaps an entry level blended and sweetened lambic that won't shock the uninitiated. """
"I bought another bottle to take home, as well as a bottle of Mort Subite Oude Gueuze (which doesn't have the late sugar addition). I'll see if I can taste the difference."
"375 ml bottle, corked champagne style. In France. Brown colour, large head. Aroma of barnyard, ensilage and red wine vinegar. Sour & sweet flavour with notes of claret and red wine vinegar. The recipe includes maize (corn) and ascorbic acid. A drinkable gueuze, but Im not impressed."
"Really quite a smooth drinker. Tart flavor dominates at first, but theres surprising amount of malt sweetness to the back end of the sip. Enough to leave the throat a bit sticky afterwards. Finish is a bit woody/musty. Ends with a bit of a whimper."
"A belgian beer, almost a speciality beer for me, i try this week this beer and i´m not impressed, the belgians are not my favorites, excpet P. Kwak, this are very fruity, i try this only like appetizer, but is good for cheeses and french bread, i prefer serve in a goblet, for appreciate its tones, i recommend 72% in my preferences."
"Musty, apple/fruity and slight vinegar aroma  as if it was just drawn from a wooden vat in a barn. Slight sour apple mash taste  no real malts or hops kick. Very dry, almost Champaign-like in the mouth. Still a pleasant drinking brew, would not mind having a bottle or two  even the wifey said she liked the taste."
"Overall - A pretty good and very drinkable gueuze although maybe a touch too sweet... certainly worth a try..."
"A drinkable gueuze but not really very true to the style"
"It even lists asorbic acid and ""antioxidant"" (with the quotations) as ingredients. Thats weird. This beer is a like a cooler version of a gueuze. I can understand making sweetened versions of kriek, but also Gueuze? Why?"
"Drinkability, well, in my hoy Summer sorroundings this is a great beverage. Might have several in a row, especially in a night like this one."
"Comfortable beer to drink, good summer beer, worth a try."
"A smooth tasting and sour but not overpowering smelling geuze. Pretty appearance, with significant lace. Does not overpower the palate, some sweetness without being cloying. Long moderately tart finish. Satisfying beverage even for my mate, his being the beginner geuze."
"In all it is quite refreshing with its light carbonation if not outstanding in taste."
"375 mL green bottle, corked, best before date punched into the side of the front label."
"Poured a clear, dark amber, with a rocky white head and good lacing. Aroma was fruity and estery. Taste was syrupy sweet fruits, tart and a dry, cloying bitter after taste. Way too sweet for my tastes. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy. Carbonation was ok. Just not my favourite style."
"E"
"deep gold color, nice carbonation maybe a little too much for style, small white head that falls out to a very thin white boubley covering. Aroma is funky, horsey, citrus with some sweetness. everything a gueze lambic should be. The taste is sour with some lemon tones. This gueze is very drinkable, not overly sour, a little astringent but this is has a very soft feel in the mouth."
"Appearance is nice, quiet clear bronze teint wit a nice white head. Smell is very fruity, litle sour but fresh with litle malt. Taste is sour and fresh with lits of citrussyfruit. Litle malt and oak are there but mostly in the aftetaste. Further sour; its a pitty to see on the label that they ad vit. C. A good geuze can do without...."
"Had this on tap at their place in Brussels. The color of the beer is an orange and peach combination. Frothy white head on the pour wich leaves quickly. Tart dry taste with a tangy sour tongue. There is also a slight citrus (lemon) taste to the brew as well. Decent mouth but not that special. It's lacking the baryard horse love and complexity."
"On-tap at the Mort Subite cafe in Brussels. 75cl Glass full for like 5-6 euros! The epitome of a mediocre, non-traditional lambic product. This is a murky golden colour with a huge frothy head of white-off-white foam. Aromas are gueuze-like. Sweet/sour/fruity without the fruit/malty/bready/biscuity/everythingy. The taste is sweet up front, and sharply sour as well. The finish is nice and long. The mouthfeel is neither too thick nor too thin and the drinkability is a bit above average. By all means try this one once...but once will probably be enough."
"An amber redish color, kind of opaque with a non persistent small head. The smell and the taste are all about sourness. Some grapefruit flavor: sour, but fruity and slightly sweet. A note of apple in the taste that I didn't find in the smell. The mouthfeel was ok. A decent gueuze, not more than that."
"No big deal there are plenty more beers to drink out there."
"Bottle - Poured a golden brew with a nice huge bubbly head. Retention is very standard but head leaves mark at every sip, which is usually a quality mark. Taste is sour with a hint of tannic. Very refreshing with great carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer even though there's probably some more extreme/better lambic gueuze out there."
"Drinkability  I would have liked to have seen a little more complexity to this one. It was a good sipper but somewhat boring."
"The Mort Subite Geuze in Belgium is 7% abv, but I'm not sure if there is a difference between what you get in the US and what we have here. Could just be a mistake on this listing."
"This gueuze poured a clear, light amber color with creamy, white foam that persisted and clung to the inside of the glass. The smell was a tart, sour, citrus aroma with just a hint of sweetness. The citrus tickled the nose. The taste was tart with some sugary taste. There was a sour grape (vinous) taste as well as a hint of caramel (unexpected in a gueuze?). The usual musty flavors were present. The mouthfeel was smooth but tart with medium body and medium low carbonation. This was an OK gueuze, but a bit sweeter than expected."
"I can never see myself getting terribly excited about the gueuze style of lambic, but I don't dislike it either. It's great that it exists, I guess I'm saying, but I can't imagine seeing myself returning to it for taste or refreshment too often!"
"The Gueuze is brewed by De Keersmaeker for the café, using the Mort Subite name and is widely available in the area; it is unfiltered and quite good. The typical sourness is balanced by a light sweetness and is not as uncompromising as some of the Lambic from the smaller brewers. For an unsweetened Gueuze, Mort Subite is definitely quite approachable for the budding Lambic initiate."
"White two inch head, amazing lacing, amber orange body. Sour and sweet orange cream soda aroma. Flavor is consistent with aroma. Orange sherbet, peach notes, with no discernable hops. This is a fruity beer that avoids beeing sweet. Pleasantly carbonated and easy to drink"
"This lambic poured a medium white foamy head with fine-large bubbles. The body was gold and there was no lacing on the sides of my glass. There was a lot of carbonation with this lambic. The aroma was fruity, sweet and citrusy. The taste was syrupy and slightly sour. The flavor reminded me of apple juice."
"This brew poured a large head of fine to large sized white bubbles that left no lacing. Its body is that of a carbonated light orange/brown lager. It has a very strong fruity lambic aroma. The flavor is a dry, fruity, sour and acidic with a fizzy mouthfeel. An unimpressive average lambic at best."
"Comes in a green bottle with a wire cage and cork. It's cloudy and somewhere between gold and peach with an effervescent white head. The smell is primarily citrus. The flavor also has pronounced citrus with the requisite bitterness and some sweetness. Being no gueuze expert, this one was good enough to keep me interested in in tracking down more. A hearty thanks to LongBeachBum for the sample."
"I liked this.  Sweet, but drinkable and very smooth."
"The pour a clear golden-amber color, the head is creamy, modest in size, off white in color, and dissipates faster than a ""Good Beer At Gusler's House"" pert near Warp Speed, right Mr. Spock, with fine lace sheets. Nose is that of over ripe or sour fruit, with under tones of sweetness. Front is malt, top is Infinitesimal, but the whacking acidity hits you immediately, vinegary, basal in the hops category, with an astringently dry aftertaste. Ranks #748 on my current 1000 beer master list."
"I was hoping for something more but I'm not dissapointed. Cloudy with a frothy white head. Lemon on the nose. An odd sweet finish after the tart. Not watery but not quite thick."
"Pleasurable Gueuze, slightly sour, slightly sweet, not over the top, but i don't think its meant to be is it?"
"Quite easy to drink, seemed processed compared to a unadultered lambic. Odd sweetness behind the tartness, still had no problem drinking a few glasses of it at La Mort Subite cafe in Brussels though."
