Taste is a balanced mix between funky ester with some barnyard notes and green apple tartness. Body is full enough for style with good carbonation for an 8 year old bottle.

The nose is super funky, with a bunch of hay, horse piss, sharp a acidity, and wet grass. It has some stank. The flavors are very sour, acidic, earthy, with loads of barnyard and horse blanket.

Pours a clear golden yellow with a massive 4 inch fizzy bone colored head that settles to a thin cap on top of the beer. Lots of tiny bubbles are active in the beer itself after the pour. Small dots and chunks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. When I stick my nose into the glass and take a whiff I am met with an intense blast of funk that tingled and burned my nose and made the hair on my face stand on end. I am also getting very sour, tart, woody, and earthy aromas. Definitely one of the funkiest gueuzes I have ever smelled. Taste is of funk, lemony sourness/tartness, grain, and some slightly woody flavors. There is an acidic tingle on the palate with each sip. This beer has a very high level of carbonation with an extremely crisp and prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great gueuze and probably the best one I have tried thus far in my beer tasting journey.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 08, 2012"

4.05,-6.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This one was shared by beeruser with funkydelic, StayWhatYouAre2, 67couple, others, and myself at a recent tasting graciously hosted by beeruser! 2009 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Duvel Parra tulip. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtle sour, funk, and bell pepper. The flavor was of sweet malt, bell pepper, funk, and slight sour. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Bell pepper, eh!? That is a new one for me in a beer... However, it really wasn't that bad in this one and actually helped bring out the subtle sourness I picked up on. This brew was very easy drinking and enjoyable. I would love to try one of these with a good bit of age on it to see how it develops over time.

Great flavor, bringing everything I found in the aroma together quite nicely. The body is fairly thin, with low carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer.

4.72,9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"into a tulip it was a light orange brown with a very nice three finger head of lace and a good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Nice retention only gradually let the head fade away, what was left was a very nice set of concentric side glass rings of lace. Smell was very sour, lots of grapes and other fruits. A bit light on the nose before the sour wrath kicks in. Flavor was very full and robust. Nice yeast filled flavor wrecks your taste buds but calms down considerably on the finish. A huge rush of sour fruit than kicks into overdrive and puckers your lips through the finish. This was a wonderfully unique brew that had a very good flavor and a light fruity feel","mikesgroove","Jul 06, 2011"

As a second glass is poured, more character of cheese comes out in aroma and flavor with a nice woodsy dryness that was not evident before.

Overall this was a great gueuze. Its really a shame that we can't buy this in the U.S. because I'd drop some cash on it. As it is I really can't because shipping from Belgium is just too much.

3.95,-8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottled in 2009. Pours a clear orange gold with a medium head that settles into a thin cap. Nose is lush, juicy, kind of a very brett-forward, melon type nose or something. Definitely more brett heavy than most Belgian lambics I believe. Quite sour upfront, really high carbonation, which I enjoy. Still really bretty throughout, kind of eggy, sweaty brett. Citrus fruits, light fruits, a touch of white grape perhaps. In fact, it reminds me of Cuvee de Castleton a *little* bit, which is odd as I rarely compare genuine Belgian lambics to American sours. Acidity creeps up a bit in the finish. I can see how the components of this might play a role in the 3 Fonteinen blends but I'm not sure the really high carbonation works well with the overly brett-forward elements of this. I prefer the drier, more mineral-forward 3 Fonteinen blends. This is somewhat like Girardin Black but the funk and yeast in the Girardin is tighter, and to me this just doesn't *pop* how I wanted.","JAXSON","Apr 21, 2011"

4.3,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability and Overall Impression: I found that each sip followed the last one easily and almost without thought. By the time lunch was served I’d finished well over half of it. It also turned out to be a surprising good companion to the beef stew I was having. I’ll certainly be happy to have this again and I wouldn’t mind seeing what a few years of age do with this beer. My overall impression is that this is a very good beer. Very different than the Cantillon but very good in its own right. This beer demonstrated to me that when it comes to lambics and geuze it is the wild yeast and their companion bacteria that make up the terroir of the beer.","drtth","Nov 05, 2010"
4.64,7.2,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Tart puckering medium body with lots of sour barnyard funk without beng acetc or acdic at all. Intensely puckering but clean with lots of earthy funk and sourness without being harsh or abrasive. Slight light fruit presence with hints of apple and pear and a nice vinegar/vinaigrette flavor at the end of the swallow that leaves me drooling for more. I can't believe that this beer can be so complex, funky and drinkable all at the same time. Some sours/lambics/gueuze can become a bit much after a while but I could drink this beer all night. Amazing!","corby112","Nov 02, 2010"

4.47,3.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"Yum. Face-meltingly sour, this geuze is. I'm getting kind of sweaty just remembering the hurt laid out on my palate. Brutal, but in a good way. Lots of tannic wood and funky Earth pulls through as it warms. Mouthfeel is frothy in its carbonation, while the thin body dries the tongue with each sip. For me, Gueze de Cam stole the sour category at our tasting, even with the likes of Blauw, DDG, and Bullfrog Magic Beans in attendance. A beer to savor. Thanks again for sharing this one Mike!","wagenvolks","May 26, 2010"
4.3,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"I'd forgotten how sour this beer is. Bracingly so, with a strong lemon and grapefruit pith sourness, there's plenty of citric and some lactic acid (definitely some yogurt), at a level where it hinders drinkability and the complexity of the nose. The funk is rather obliterated by the sourness. On the bright side, so is the sulfur. Bitter grapefruit pith on the finish, this beer is highly carbonated and is a demonstration in sourness. Moderate wood tannins with vanilla and wet oak are present. Solid stuff, but too sour to make a session gueuze (like, say, Girardin or Drie Fonteinen) 4/3.5/4","DefenCorps","May 18, 2010"
4.44,2.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The taste opens with a sharp lemon-like flavor, both bitter rind and sour juice. Woody and earthy/funky flavors come out more as it breathes. Lactic sourness is dominant with only a trace of acetic acid. Finishes tannic and oaky with some lactic slickness sticking to the tongue. Very enjoyable, but not quite stellar. The beer improved as it sat in the glass and warmed.","largadeer","May 10, 2010"
4.25,-1.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Finally cracked open a bottle I bought last year in Ghent. I also finally noticed the bottle date was from 2000, so I wasn't sure what to expect here. I think the beer was a little past it's prime, as it wasn't bursting with complexity. Instead, it had smoothed out a bit. Frankly, this just helped me drink more of it, so I'm not complaining. A lot of great gueuze will be bursting with flavor, but the sourness really hurts drinkability. So with this more subtle (for the style) tartness, the beer is still full of the trademark tangy lemon, citrus rind, and farmhouse character - it just doesn't beat you over the head with any of them. I certainly wouldn't mind drinking this beer again.","tempest","Nov 09, 2009"

Flatish body is forgiven as the wildness of it all more than makes up for it. Citric flavor with touches of barnyard piss and soap. Mmmmm.... A treat. One of the best beers and biggest surprises of my stay in Belgium. Drinkable by the liter.","DaPeculierDane","Jul 11, 2009"
3.72,-14.1,3,3.5,4,3,4,"375ml corked & caged, dated Jan 2006. No signs of carbonation, golden apricot in color. Smells, sharp apple-y, and a touch medicinal. Taste is very dry, with a nice finish. Tastes of dried fruit, with a malty note and a nice blended flavor that doesn't do anything too suddennly. The mouthfeel is pleasantly slick but utterly without carbonation. Drinkability is good, due to the nice balance/blending of flavors. A good gueueze, all in all.","roblowther","Jun 02, 2008"

4.32,-0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"A sour lemony aroma with only a hint of mustiness to it. There is a definite sharp acidity to it, that I would say is on the hard side for the traditional geuze blenders. The carbonation is lively and seems to enhance the acidity.","Gueuzedude","Sep 11, 2007"
4.13,-4.6,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Taste: Low end carbonation pushes the acidity to good levels but without getting too astringent or ""burning", the funky flavor tastes a bit more corky than woody, it again reminded me of a dry cider, especially in the finish, it's drying and tart but oh-so easy to drink and makes you drink more and more!

4.65,7.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"M&D: superb on the mouthfeel, that it's softly spritzy as a good Geuze should be; the texture sits on top of a profound body of wheat-malts and is prolonged by the phenomenal dryness and oaky aroma on the tongue. All in all, this is one of the best Old Geuze I've tasted, even better than 3 Fonteinen 2002 vintage even though this bottle is much younger. It's not outstanding because of stunning complexity, but the incredible depth, length, body, and balance all in one go. A sublime beer to kick off a special occasion like tonight, X'mas Eve. 8-)","wl0307","Sep 19, 2006"

4.51,4.2,5,4,5,4.5,4,"Big white foam covers the cloudy gold, sunny colored body. Typical aroma, straightforward fresh hay, cobwebs, cheesy hops, not as assertive as I expected from the kriek. Yeasty white wine, grapey, champaign reminiscent with concentrated dust and old books notes. It sounds better than it is if I may say so, it is just too light and thin-feeling an aroma to be world-class. This changes dramatically in mouth though, it is aggressively acid, very tart, cidery. Pinneaple notes, lasting apricot aftertaste. Many types of acidity, gently citrusy with grapefruit notes. Assertive, but nevertheless very drinkable. A labyrinth of musty flavours and one that is easy to finish. Foamy palate, authentic in soul, spritzy carbonation. Excellent stuff, delicate and well finished.","Rastacouere","Sep 27, 2003"

Hardcore lambic pretty much at its best, the palate however, was a lot softer and less harshly acidic than something like Cantillon, or even Beersel, which i actually welcomed. i don't what i can really say other than there is simply nothing wrong with this gueze, all i wanted to do when i finished it, was have another one(Bottle- GBBF 03')","rastaman","Beers"
4.8,10.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"A very dry, sharp tasting, sour Gueuze. Oak is detectable in the aftertaste. The newest of the Gueuze blenders, the Bottle was dated 1998 and sampled in the De Cam Stekerij at Easter 2002. The Gueuze was extremely effervescent when de-corked. Excellent example of the style, a truly traditional Gueuze, will definitely become a favourite amongst Gueuze Monsters in years to come as the Vintages develop character, and may well mount a challenge for King Cantillons crown. The 1998 Vintage is one of the first batches to leave the Stekerij and hence the oldest. Review is for the 1998 Bottle. Note: Newer examples that I have tried (2000) lack the dryness and can be somewhat 'flat' when served. I believe that time will better this Gueuze in the years to come. Superb!!","TheLongBeachBum","0"
