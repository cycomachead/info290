4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I don't have a lot of the experience with this style, but when done right it's a style that I enjoy and after trying this beer I have no doubt that Dogfish Head did a good job with this beer.  It had good drinkability, it was smooth, not too acidic, crisp, the alcohol was hidden very well, slightly refreshing, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle since it's not really acidic and the alcohol seemed to be expertly hidden.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance, no single aspect ever got too overpowering, the balance was right where it needed to be.  What I liked the lest about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single thing about this beer that I disliked or would change.  I would for sure buy this beer again and I might consider seeing how it ages. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or just tart fruity beers in general, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and a little impressed, some of these beers from this ancient ale series were hit or miss for me, but this one was for sure a hit and enjoyed drinking it, it exceeded my expectations.  So far it's one of the better Dogfish Head beers I've had it's now my favorite of the style.  Good job guys this was one tasty, unique and interesting beer, keep up all the hard work.","StoutHunter","Nov 15, 2014"

Taste was also a weird mix between some berries notes, herbs with weird unrefined grainy notes. Body is light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting experiment but with such low drinkability I think I will avoid in the future.","Phyl21ca","Aug 22, 2014"

In the nose, earthy wood, stale fruit, notes of cough syrup and solventy booze. I actually said *blech* when I took a sip of this. Rotten fruit, cranberry jam, cardboard, decomposing wood, a medicinal and almost vodka like booziness. Really messy, and the almost non-existent carbonation wasn't helping the mouthfeel either, which came off as slick and lifeless. Definitely couldn't drink this one, so I'm glad I only got a sample.","Rifugium","Aug 18, 2014"

There's a bracing grapefruit-rind-like bitterness on the back end that's really pleasant, and the fruit quite reserved, but there. I kind of wish they'd skipped the cranberries and gone all-lingonberry, as that would've fit the Scandinavian theme better. Herbs are well balanced, hard to place - either dill seed or caraway, maybe both in there. The more I drank the more it seemed to reveal - but most important, in a chilled glass it was just wicked refreshing on a hot August day. Good stuff.","sanhedrin","Aug 03, 2014"

The nose was nice with tinges of spice and malt. The flavor is what set this apart as it was reminiscent of a Christmas beer with nutmeg, spicy cinnamon, barley malt, tea leaves, prune, date and then a tangy cranberry finish. The feel was a tad thin when it comes to the overall style. I enjoyed this immensely, perhaps a touch jaded by the history, but it had great flavor.","KYGunner","Jun 02, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart berries, cranberry juice, strawberry, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, light woodiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast ester, fruit, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart berries, cranberry juice, strawberry, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, light woodiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart berries, cranberry juice, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, light woodiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, fruit, malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/fruit flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice fruit/spiced ancient ale style. All around good balance and complexity and balance of yeast, ester, fruit, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 24, 2014"

It smells like a a fresh forest harvest...meaty berries, wood, herbs, and very prominent honey. The taste is a bit tart, followed with a fruity sweetness. Dryish, with lots of flavor. It has an herbal bitterness up front, which does not linger. Medium body, and lightly carbonated. Very drinkable, and it really masks its ABV.","Suds","Nov 24, 2013"

3.99,7.3,3.75,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle, bottled on 10/11/2013. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart berries (cranberries, other red berries), honey, sweet syrup, and some peppery herbalness. It tastes like cranberries, sweet and tart red berries, white grapes, honey, bready/grainy malt and some woody herbs. There's some nice sweet, tart and herbal flavors that mesh well together in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and creamy with moderate carbonation. The 10% ABV is pretty well hidden. I think it's a good, interesting brew. I'd pick this up again in the future, it's definitely worth trying if you've never had it before. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Nov 22, 2013"

3.87,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a two finger light tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of cranberry, mixed berries, light bready malt, lightly spicy and tart. Flavor is earthy; bark and light toasted malt to start, developing cranberry flavor and tartness with grape and berry elements and finishing with tart cranberry juice and earthy bitterness. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. Another very interesting reconstructed beer that really does taste as if it were the result of an ancient brewer experimenting with flavors from the nearby environment. The profile of the base beer is reminiscent of a light Berliner Weisse, fruity and tart, but the rustic herbs have an interesting woodiness of putting your tongue on an unfinished pine board; woody without a resiny element. Likely due to a mint family herb like sage. Tart and refreshing with an odd herbal taste that I enjoyed despite its unfamiliarity. We don't know what these early brews tasted like, but a lot of the Dogfish Head attempts sure are convincing that they could have been brewed at the dawn of time.","LiquidAmber","Nov 20, 2013"

Flavors are tart forward, with cranberry in the forefront, a subtle rich sweetness of honey, roast characteristics, woody notes, and a hint of booze.
