"Mostly clear medium golden color with a huge bubbly white head with moderate retention. Lemony herbal nose that reminds me of honey lemon cough drops. Light clove and pepper with a hint of sweet honey like malt underneath. The flavor is quite clove-y with light sweet honey like malt and hints of lemon. Medium body moderate carbonation. This beer is really not my thing."

"Overall interesting but weird... more of a late spring beer when it's hot, to sit outside and enjoy with friends. Drinking this entire bottle will be a chore, it's interesting and fun, but not more than a glass."

"Feels like a Mystic Saison pumped up with lemon balm and flowers, maybe that is what it is. It all works out for me and I find the flavors balance out and compliment each other."

"Smelled like toothpaste. Nice juniper taste."
