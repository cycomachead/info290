"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a small foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma of rosemary and thyme is overpowering and almost too much to handle. Taste is also totally dominated by rosemary and thyme notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting but too much herbs makes this one unbearable after a while."
"Tastes like a mix of hefeweizen and Artemis to me. I get some banana moderately spiced with thyme and basil. It's very different and not was I was expecting. But overall, it is workable and easier to approach than its love or hate stablemate. That doesn't mean it's a beer you'd want more than a pint of though."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and creamy, a great combination here. Can get a little too fizzy for me at times, but overall it remains solid in this category. Drinkability is very good considering the heavy oregano; the checks of citrus and grain do very well. Can't say I've had many beers in this style, but I really enjoyed this one."
"With all of Moonlights beers I have had, they are crisp and delightful. The flavors bounce on the palate wonderfully, and the carbonation plays perfectly with the beer. Another winner that threw my palate for a loop..."
"This is definitely something to try. It is really well crafted; the balance is excellent. But you have to love rosemary, or it may not hold your interest past a few interesting sips."
"Very special."
"D: My palate was a little unused to the herbed flavor of the beer; I am conditioned to expect hops as the bittering agent. After about 4oz, I was done with my share, but I didn't regret trying the beer. It's just that the oregano flavor becomes quite strong after a while."
