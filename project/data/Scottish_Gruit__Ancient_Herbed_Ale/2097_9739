3.46,0.9,3,4.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Thanks to trbeer for delivering this one. Pours a one-finger cream head over a rust colored liquid. The beer is cloudy with floating bits, as I accidentally poured the sediment from the bottle into the glass. Smells earthy and floral (roses) and has some sweet orange. Has a vienna malt sort of taste with a downward acidic pull. Very aromatic and interesting. Tastes potently sour tart. Starts with cherries and pineapple. Sour green apple. Then an earthy tartness. Acidic and metallic. Has a dry sweetness below the potent sour. Throughout, there is almost an oily feel in my mouth that correlates with a flower taste. You know how roses smellthats what the floral tastes like. Medium to medium-light mouthfeel and medium-heavy carbonation. I'm truly amazed they were able to capture the floral essence so well in smell and taste. If they could tame that sour, this would be a truly fantastic beer. As is, I had a hard time choking down the last gulp.","mentor","Beers"

I kind of hope that's the case, really. Only OK -- by their standards at the very least.","marburg","0"
