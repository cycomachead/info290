"Overall, a good beer."
""
""
""
"This ale poured hazy golden colour with a thin white head.  The nose is really subtle, maybe some corn and malt but not much else.  There is some sweetness on the tongue, maybe caramel and malt, as well as a bit of graininess.  Not much else.  I don't really even get the heather that it's said its made with.  Reminds me a bit of a standard light lager and I was expecting something a bit more floral."
"O: [2.75] Nothing to make this one stand out.  It is just okay at best.  I had some hopes for it to be a winner but it is not doing it for me.  The nose and the taste are just slightly different than Bud (that is not a compliment)."
""
""
""
"Smells and tastes not far from light perfumy lager. Disappointing. Check out Williams' March of the Penguins though - one of the best stouts I've tried."
""
"Pours an almost clear deep straw/pale gold producing a rapidly diminishing, foamy, white head that leaves streaks, strings, webs & motes of lace. Aroma is pale malt, honey, faint nuts, grain, floral/herbal & a hint of sourness. Taste is light but not watery: malt, honey, floral, caramel, fruitiness with a grain, herbal, floral, dry finish. Aftertaste is dry, fruity & floral. No hops in it and no hop character. I have no idea what heather smells or tastes like so I have no basis to determine if I detect it in either the nose or mouth. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, light but silky & juicy becoming becoming very dry at the end. Unique & oh so drinkable."

"Nice to try a historic brew, not bad, just ok."
""
""
""
"Looks and smells decent; taste isn't offensive but not much to it. Certainly something to give a non-beer drinker."
""
"Nothing bad about this beer but it does not have a lot of character. It almost taste like a light beer"
"Enjoy"
"Dark straw in color.  Earthy nose. Grainy and mild.  Interesting from a historical perspective but that’s about it."
""
"I'm Scottish, my sister's name is Heather for the ""heather on the hill.""  I really wanted to enjoy this beer.  But I did not.  I love that they tried to revive this style but I did not care for it.  Gave it some bonus points overall for uniqueness."
"A hop free beer, a wonderful beer, very subtle. at the first sip your tongue will most likely be confused, don't worry this is quite normal. this is most likely your first time drinking a hop free beer. the Heather flavor is Heavenly and sublime( if you don't know what heather is look it up) and the fog often mentioned in literature is still present(a sudden sleepiness caused by certain fungi that grow on wild heather). if drank with food stick to something mild that will not overpower the floral goodness of this brew"
"Appearance is not far off from a Hefe-Weizen.  Pale golden color, hazy, white head.  Things differ thereafter.  Clean nose, light citrus.  Light malt flavor with delicate hops, clean, light, drinkable.  Some light floral qualities noted.  Beer is easily overpowered with foods."
""
"This was good and interesting. I'll search for a fresher bottle next time."
"Overall, this is really good gruit.  I'd drink it again, without hesitation."
""
"Overall-  It was OK, I think I need to give it another try and see if I missed out on this."
"tastes of honey and florals, heather, slightly bitter finish."
""

"Wheaty, feels like brett hops. Yellow with a good foamy white head. Sweet, caramel, but a strong rye feel underneath. Quite refreshing. A hint of lemon"
""
"Nice to get a decent unhopped beer with a pre-Reinheitsgebot recipe.  Hops increases the production of estrogen in the body and the Church wanted to feminize people to make them more compliant, especially as the Inquisition was winding down.  Hence, they forced the use of hops upon brewers; first in Germany, then everywhere."
""
"First in this style for me, so going on description. Pours a hazy golden color. Small white foamy head. Smells kind of yeasty with some citrus (lemon maybe) and a sweetness I cant pinpoint. Taste is sweet and unique like Paw Paw fruit. Zesty citrus, honey, flowery or herb like, but not hops, and a solid malt base. Above average carbonation gives it a little bit of a crisp bite like champagne. Slightly slick/sticky aftertaste/finish.  Otherwise, medium bodied. Not a favorite by any means, but pretty easy drinking and enjoyable. I would recommend trying just because it is very different."

"Very enjoyable, for a beer with no hops.  Kudos to the brewery for recreating an ancient-style ale that you hardly ever hear of."
"Overall – An interesting brew if a little confusing. It has a long history being the oldest beer style still brewed in Europe (dates to 2000B.C). Flavour difficult to pin down and may be very hard to review for some. It is probably not the best Gruit I have had but it is still more than drinkable and I would not steer others away from it even if I personally would not rush out to buy another."
"Enjoyed a bottle while in Scotland.  Different, but good."
""
""
"Very puzzled indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice easy drinker that has an underlying heather nose and flavor. Again, no real hop presence anywhere so it's a little different in that regard. Recommended for a nice change of pace"

"The history behind this ale is fascinating. The bottle tells the story of the oldest Scottish Ale, dating back to 2000 b.c. At the initial sip it is sweet with distinct floral overtones. A slight twist of hops then appears, followed by light earthy malts- giving the beer its character. The aftertaste is slightly nutty and is strangely chalk like. Very good overall, a testament to the 4000 years its been brewed. I'd definitely go another."
"I don’t know what heather smells or tastes like, not having been in Scotland in at least a decade, so I don’t know whether the herbiness is the typical heather aroma/flavor or not. I do know that this is an interesting if somewhat innocuous beer. I would like to find this on tap sometime."

"A really really great Viking Style Pale. The Williams Bros are known for their super light mouthfeel and herbal flavors. Out of the whole lineup, the Fraoch Heather is my favorite. The pour is a clear amber, but the lack of head or lacing was originally concerning. Smells of sweet grasses and light florals. The taste... is.. spot on. Crisp and clean, Heather comes in for a quick kiss of herbs, sweet malt, and an earthy essence. She finishes quickly and leaves you refreshed, but wanting more. Thirst quenching, tasty, easy to drink. Definitely will drink again."
""
""
""
"Food match: Roasted pig on a spit with a honey-glaze, roast carrots, potatoes and fennel - your typical medieval fare for an ancient ale."
""
""
""
"The taste has a thin grainy character but the herbal spices really define this beer. I will have to assume that the unusual flowery flavor comes from the heather flower, which I am not entirely familiar with. This most definitely has a unique quality to it."
""
""
"O: Similar to the Gooseberry wheat ale by the same company, in texture and somewhat in flavour, but more gentle and relaxed, not as intense. Would go well with haggis I reckon. Love the history, good flavour, but not really grabbing me, unless I can find out more about this unique brew."
""
""
"Had this after a weekend camping trip to the Isle of Eigg in Mallaig. Really cool label and a style of Scottish beer that has been around for thousands of years. Great beer with floral notes, earthy feel on the palate. Surprisingly smooth with a good finish. Hoping I can find this when I return to the U.S."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Similar appearance, aroma and taste to a well crafted lager. Well balanced and subtle."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good drinkability. A bit too sweet but, a classic old ale. My first Gruit Ale... Really recommended"
""

"Haven't had much heather in my culinary ventures, so it's new ground for me. Very drinkable summer brew. I'm not a huge lemon fan, but it plays well here."

"O - Much better than the Grozet IMO. Still lacking some oompf, but the sharp taste at the start really sells it for me. Would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely not a bad beer, but certainly one I wouldn't rush out to repurchase. Didn't enjoy this nearly as much as the elderberry one. Still nice use of herbs here, just wish it shone through more."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall 4.0: I did not know what to expect buying a beer that claimed to be made of flowers, but this brew did not disappoint. Certainly not so different that it would lead your average lover of hops and barley would turn up his/her nose -nonetheless-- this beer is unusual. However, it retains enough elements present in ""modern"" beers to stand as a beer that is supposedly similar to what the Scots drank in 2000 BCE, but is still readily accessible to modern beer drinkers. Recommended for the historical elements alone, but this beer certainly is worth trying just to drink a great beer."
""
""
""
"Impressively balanced for such subdued herbal additions. A big departure from yeast, malt, or hop forward flavors. It is something that is quietly impressive for balance and uniqueness. I unfortunately probably judge too harshly because this isn't a style I drink often."

"O: This ale is highly drinkable and very unique. It's also quite cool to think that you are partaking in an ale that was first brewed in 2000BC. I particularly enjoyed the balance this beer provides and the honey, tea-like notes. The heather, while not prevalent, is noticeable and provides that little bit of something extra."
"A very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fine quaff with no wow factor. I could easily drink this again, if not very often. Good to break up the monotony of mediocre brown ales and IPAs, though."
"It's like a summer ale, sessionable, drinkable and refreshing. ""Fraoch"" is Gaelic for Heather."
""
"This ale doesn't seem that ancient - very civilized."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Interesting, strange, floral. I'm not quite sold on it, but I'm glad I had it."
""
""
""
"I didn't score A, S, T, M at that time, so please disregard those scores"
""
""
""
"O- This is the first gruit I have had, and the first unhopped beer I have had, as far as I know. It is a pleasant experience to taste something like this, in regard to the location and time period these kinds of beer were made, but on the other hand, it's rather plain, and couldn't find myself drinking many of these in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very mild flavor a perfect drinking and matching socks all day kind of beer. Lightly carbonated which is good cause I don't know how well those sea monkeys will burp up! No smell at all which also makes it good for drinking and matching socks all day cause nothing is worse than socks that smell like spilt beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark yellow-gold color. Thin off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some residual lacing. Aroma is floral, grassy with hints of grain. Flavor is a mix of floral with sweet malt and clover honey. Light bodied and very dry finish that borders on astringent. Light, easy-drinking and sessionable, but not something I would probably seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Scottish Gruit. Pick this one up if you can get your hands on it."
""
"Atmosphere is really solid. Nice hue, not much of head, but light but distinct lacing. Nose consists of many subtle notes of grass, hop, fruit, and corn syrup. Flavor is a very light malt tone, accentuated with a little soda and fruit, and finished with a slight bitterness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is more of the herbal, with a touch of fruit in the mix somehow. Definitely a malt-based ale, this one brings a floral finish. Enjoyable and different from the usual craft ales."
""
"B"
"Interesting to have an idea, through this example, on how beer tasted a long time ago before the use of hops. Also the fact that it tastes a bit similar to juniper beers, it may indicate that this was the standard of how beers should taste like back then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Semi hazed golden color with a bright white head which dies quickly. Very tea like and herbal on the nose. Tastes almost Belgian like. Sweet rose water notes upfront with faint bubble gum and banana . Medium body with light effervescence. Herbal and tea like on the back end. Dismissed finish with bright flavors lingering. Pretty nice and easy drinking."
""
"RJT"
"O - Explosive craft beer growth can make it hard to find something new and really unique but take one look at this fantastic label; within is an ancient beer brewed long before ""craft beer"" and in a sea of crazy options, Fraoch Heather Ale is still unique and outstanding. This earthy, floral and herbal beer has layers of complexity and ancestry ingrained in it for an outstanding, one-of-a-kind experience."
"Overall: Easy drinking and herbal, the herbalness is subtle though. Would have again."
"Basically, this is a weird experience and an awkward flavor. I would order this again if I was eating, but only if there was good involved. I have a feeling this doesn't get better as it heats up, either. Just has a certain flavor that I would expect from a wheat beer that gets gross as it gets warm. Glad this was on the list, but I am not blown away. Has anyone tried this with food? (Oh, and the burp is horrible. It tastes like sour grapes.)"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall. Flavours were okay, but it was too sweet for me. Interesting, for sure."

"It pours with very little head and I got no lacing.The body is clear (but looks thick) golden honey. It has the aroma of honey, oranges, and multi-grain bread. It has the taste of wild flowers and honey. Its flatness makes it seem like a tea of anonymous mixed herbs.There is no alcoholic taste. It ends dry with a flower-grass aftertaste. The most striking aspect of this beer is its balance; nothing overwhelming, combines to make a really good beer."
""
"Overall: Very glad to have had this on tap. I would go out of my way for this beer to have it again. A new favorite."
""
""
"Overall, I would have this fine brew again. Very brilliant!"

"overall, how do i put it? this stuff, while apparently seemingly a novelty, is quite flavorful and considered as a full fledged participant inthe world of beer- which is quite rare for the novelty category. it is a decent brew, and for whatever reason behind it's conception (as the review notes state), it's a very drinkable brew which would convince me of believing i am being healed of whatever ailment that is bothering me. of course, i prefer higher strength elixirs, but i can understand the primitive ways of mankind."
"O - A tasty brew, some unique flavours and easily drinkable. I'm glad I tried it, but it's not something I would go out of my way to get again."
""
"Final Grade: 4.12, an A-. Fraoch Heather Ale might just be the first spiced beer I've ever had that I would consider truly sessionable. The unique flavour offers up enough spicy, herbal notes to keep things interesting, but never comes close to overwhelming or exhausting the palate, even (I suspect) after more than one bottle. Of the four ales in this brewery's sampler, this is easily the most drinkable, potentially the most well-integrated, and probably my favourite. Well worth a try, and I'd definitely recommend the sampler (""Historic Ales from Scotland"") to any newbie who wishes to find out what this relatively obscure style is all about."
"O- very strange and interesting beer. Strange cuz I've never had heather before. But this in a good way... it took a little to grow on me but this a good session/ food pairing beer...."
""
""
""
"i was left feeling a little underwhelmed by this. not having much, if any, experience with the flavors of heather and sweet gale makes this hard to judge, however, the bottle could have been old and this an ale much better consumed as fresh as possible. the herbal flavors were a little too subtle but, at the same time, you wouldn't want them to be over the top considering the alcohol level and seeming simplicity of the malt bill. I'll definitely give this another shot if I can get a younger bottle..."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the New Course Clubhouse, St. Andrews. Has a compact white head, lacing is alright but could be better, limited carbonation, colour is a medium straw gold. Smell is quite pleasant, balanced maltiness with a nice heather earthiness, but not remarkable. Taste has a nice malt aspect, heather and herbal character is prominant but tempered nicely. A elegant mint character, finish is smooth, lightly bitter. Makes for a very pleasant, sessionable ale. Mouthfeel is medium with a good creaminess, carbonation is mild. I'd recommend this, an interesting take, and very well done, drinks well, interesting and balanced."
"O-Great beer. I had never heard of the style and just picked it up. Glad I did, looking forward to finding more beers in the style"
""
""
"The most surprising part of this beer is how well heather works as a bittering agent. The taste is reminiscent of a Belgian Trippel, with a similar level of carbonation and slightly spicy mouthfeel, but it ends with a surprising tartness - more akin to a saison. I made the mistake of letting it chill for too long, but once it warmed some, it was quite good. And well worth the wait for the warming. A very pleasant change from traditional hops-based beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would Make"
""
""
""
"overall: I'm quite surprised by this beer. It's not your regular ale and definitely has a unique flavor combo going on. I love the creamy like round feeling of the taste and mouthfeel. It's very fluid and refreshing, yet with a dry finish and leaves you with a after-taste that wants more. What more could you ask for? I just love it."
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a light orange amber with a slight head and a hint of lacing. Aroma of wheat with a slight adjunct component. Flavor is light wheat with some floral elements, light citrus and light malt. The heather element redeems this ale, which otherwise would be pretty uninspiring. It would be nice to try a more intense attempt at this style. Glad to have tried it, but would not revisit in this form."
"breezy expertly blended to get away with the spritely carbonation."
""
"And interesting brew. I can imagine ancient Scots downing a lot of these. Tasty, but not overpowering."
""
"Drink- Its a nice beer. Very new, very unique but something people should try. I would like to drink again. Sits well on a hot day."
""
""
"Overall, nice brew, but there is something missing. Depth? Strength? Easy to drink, and I really like the heather element. Good brew, but not great brew."
""
"Overall quite an odd brew which is expected from the same guys that bring you ""Kelpie (seaweed beer)"" Worth a try to have more Scottish beers under your belt."
""
""
"O: Tasty, enjoyable to sit and sip."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer not complex but good tasting."
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation."
""
""
"4.0 D: Good beer that works the heather in seemlessly. Solid all around."
""
"O- A very interesting style and much different from what I was expecting. Both the taste and the mouthfeel of this beer really surprised me. I was not expecting it to be as thick and full bodied as it was and I was expecting a much more intense earthiness from the heather. I would actually buy this again not necessarily to drink for myself but definitely to bring to a tasting or as a gift. I could see this beer being a big hit at weddings or spring themed parties. Very unique and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm a sucker for the taste of Gruit, so this review is biased pretty heavily. I'd drink this instead of an American Pale Ale any day. It's light and refreshing. It's got that wonderful Gruit taste and great welcoming bitter. Why don't more people make this style of beer?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, the bottle was shared to gain varying options. The color was a measured pale golden color with a modest level of carbonation to bubble. A strong honey aroma attracts attention of the senses, noting a sense of sweetness. Upon the initial taste, a sweet and smooth taste was noted. With a honey taste and aroma present, it brought to mind a honey mead. The backbone of the beer was the flowery heather notes with a slight wheat sweetness. In truth, there were few characteristics of beer present. On the other hand, I enjoyed the texture and was surprised by the taste. I am not certain it would be something I would drink in the future. It is still recorded as a positive experience."
"O: Very interesting beer, very happy I got to try this unique and ancient style. Hopefully more to come."
""
""
"Overall this is a nice beer that is different from what you'd expect by the presence of the heather. Worth finding and trying."
"500ml bottle. Kwak Yard glass. Enjoyed on may´11. Bright light copper in color. Chill haze. Off-white dense froth, brief crown. Intense floral fragancy & malty aroma. Crisp & spicy flavor , subtle fresh mint hues. Earthy & sweet palate. Medium/light body. Tea-like finish. Apple notes on the aftertaste. Refreshing, flavorful. Very easy drinkability. Balanced smooth flavors & aromas. Comment. A mandatory ,almost representing a single Style in itself, beer"
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, best by Aug 2012. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of honey, biscuit, pepper, herbs, light fruit, flower petals, earth, and yeasty spiciness. Some pretty nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of biscuit, honey, caramel, toffee, citrus, floral, clove, herbs, grass, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of honey, caramel, toffee, biscuit, and herbal spices on the finish for a bit. Great balance of malt and spiciness; with a nice and robust malt backbone for a 5% beer. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with barely any warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is an excellent herbal ale. Great flavor balance and highly enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: try it! it's worth a look."
"This was my first encounter with this style. Very intriguing if you're in the mood."
""
""
"Fraoch Heather Ale pours a light sherry-colored brown with a one-fingered head that lingers like an unwanted guest. The smell is malty and relatively straight forward -- I get little else, maybe just a hint of very faint herbs. Fraoch tastes dry, herby and wine-like, and I get grapes and floral notes on the finish. I'm no expert on this style, but Fraoch is very subtle, not in your face at all. It's clearly different, decently drinkable, and a change up from your every day beer."
""
"Cheers!"
"Overall - This is really good. Very mild and refreshing. Has a tea like flavor and feel thats really nice. It Really reminds me of a mead and a saision, with a little green tea spice note. This was tasty, and man what a great light, easy to drink summer beer. Give this a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would not rate this higher than one of my favorite IPAs, but it is definitely worth drinking again."
"Overall, this is unique, complex, and still goes down easy."
""
"O-very interesting, not something that I would seek out, but a different experience, thanks for sharing Mikey, sorry about the hops issue..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: It's tasty and very drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head. The body is a clear straw yellow and it exhausts all the effervescence into that small head. I'd expect some sort of heather smell but really I'm getting very little smell off it, just a faintest herbal essence. The taste is also very mild, both a little sweet and a little sour, faintly herbal, maybe even a little cynar. The body is light. Sweetness persists in the finish. I expected more heather in the heather ale."
""
""
"O- I expected a peculiar/unique beer but i actually found a nice, simple, very refreshing pale ale, that was just a bit more on the herbal side than usual. Overall a pleasant beer"
""
"Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer but not enough to sustain my interest."
""
"For once, the description on the label of this beer’s sensory properties seem on target. It ""has a distinctive floral aroma” and a “dry wine-like finish”. Malt is clearly evident in both aroma and taste, but not quite as rich or pronounced as the “full malt character” on the label might lead one to expect. Floral throughout, including the aftertaste, this beer leans towards sweet, which seems in keeping with the floral flavor profile. Still, it smells sweeter than it tastes. The rather light and dry mouthfeel also work integrate nicely to produce a very refined and distinctive sensory experience from an ancient ale."
""
""
"T: Slightly oaky flavor with some pale malt and a nice herbal sweetness. I didn't think I was going to like this beer very much but it was actually pretty tasty. Light with some good flavor."
""
""
"The finish is clean and dry. Just a whiff of alcohol is noticed."
""
""
"Appears a pale copper hue with a bright white head forming thick, fine speckled lacing left behind on the sides of my chalice. Aroma spicy herbal, floral notes upfront with the heather additions, sweet caramel malt base with minimal to no hops. I'm pretty sure most of their brews are ancient gruit ales. Also in the nose is a strong honey like note from the malt profile, I know there's no actual honey but I'm getting a light generic fruitiness with a strong presence of rich honey. Flavor is spicy with a long dry finish, upfront light fruit a touch of honey and caramel malts dance around with floral/spicy heather and floral additions. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a mellow carbonation level, actually is pretty unremarkable. Overall a beer that just doesn't excite definitely not worth it for a ten dollar four pack thus far."
""
""
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, fairly aggressive pour yielded not much head, but some white bubbles and a thin film to support it. Nose has some caramelly notes, berries, a bit of toasty malts and a touch of an herbal/floral note. A touch of a grain. Taste has more of the berry and sweet bready notes, dry toasty malts, honey and again a hint of something herbal. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-light, but there's some decent texture. Carbonation is quite low. Quite nice, simple and relatively flavourful if tame. My first experience with heather, and I think I have a sense of what it contributed to this, but it's certainly something I'd be open to in beers in the future."
"Overall, it's a decent beer, but nothing that I found remarkable. The characteristics aren't pronounced enough to distinguish it from various other amber ales on the market. It's worth trying, but I wouldn't recommend it."
""
"I can't comment on the appearance as I drank it right from the bottle. It had an interesting scent reminding me of spices and flowers.... The taste was malty with flavors such as honey and spices showing up... It had a crisp mouthfeel. I can say it was very easy to drink and one I'd like to have some other time."
""
"Outstanding in the bottle and I dream to drink it on tap in Scotland one day. What a finish!! The ancient recipe with the heather gives a bit of an aroma, but a wonderful mouthfeel and after taste. Not highly carbonated and not too sure on the appearance - mostly drank from the bottle. But, poured it in a glass and it was a bit dark and cloudy. The taste was so apealing that the appearance was actually irrelivant :-)"
""
""
"Overall this beer is real satisfying, unique tasting, and real easy to drink, really enjoy this style. This particular one really reminds me of some type of mellow herbal braggot. Nice."
"Definitely worth a try although I did not enjoy it as much as the Alba."
""
"o: not real impressed. seeing it in a glass, it offers nothing special to set it apart from a glass of beer at a local dive bar. nose and taste are so faint that once again it offers nothing that makes me want to buy this again. it's a good beer to introduce people to other options with no hops bitterness but that's about it."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall, I'll definitely buy this one again. Full bodied and smooth."
"This is a very pleasant and bright ale that would be great in the spring or summer. Its very easygoing, but also rich with flavour."
""
"D: A more flavourful and unusual gruit that's still accessible, fairly easy-drinking, and complex enough to be worth sipping to boot. Try it at least once, just to broaden your definition of beer."
""
""
"Sweet light toffee malts up front set the tone & smack into a floral bed of that heather stuff must be eh? I dont know - never tasted a heather flower, but that must be what it is. Little to no hop presence. Body is light & refreshing, and overall is a solid Scottish Ale."
"Mouthfeel is thin with medium carbonation."
"Descent brew. First taste of the style so nothing to compare against. Not a lot of flavor yet has a crisp, refreshing quality and no repulsive flavors. If I were alive 4000 years ago, I would drink this."
"O: Enjoyable very unique Ancient Scottish Brew. Glad I tried it but wouldn't grab it again."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm glad that I got to try all 4 of these Scottish Ales, but aside from Elderberry Black Ale, they're just a bit too watery for my taste. Makes me wish that I would have got them in the summer months. It's unique, but I was expecting a fuller and more flavorful ale."
"M: Very light and drinkable. Went down rather quickly."
"This beer was okay. It was nice to try something new for a change."
"Overall: I have never tasted a beer like this one, but I am happy I tried it. Don't think I will pick up any more myself though. It probably is a brew better paired or just not my favorite."
"O- A good beer to try if you want something different, an excellent beer if you're transitioning from wine. I will try and pair it with cheese and bread next time."
"O: I thought this beer would be spicier. I'm not disappointed though because it has a lot going on."
"O: This is a very interesting beer. It feels like they've used the heather to replace the (most of the) hops."
"this beats a budweiser. drink more heather ale."
"Overall, this was a very unique brew. It's enjoyable to drink on its own, but the history and novelty surrounding the brew add a great deal to the experience."
"Very interesting. Much better than expected."
"Light to medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer has great drinkability. The body is a little light which prevents it from being thick or sticky but also seems to downplay the flavors a bit. The carbonation is a good bit fizzy, and while it helps the beer's drinkability, it also seems to hinder the flavors a bit. A little less carbonation and a little more body would help to make the flavors in this beer more recognizable and explorable."
"A light, not hard to drink,brew, but not really that exciting either."
"D -- Very approachable, while still very interesting. There are unique flavors that aren't present in American brews that are quite balanced and refreshing."
"Overall: Boring Boring Boring is the best way to sum this up"
"Pours a slightly hazy light orange with a 1 inch white head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Random patterns of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is very subdued overall. There is a slight malt aroma but I am not getting much else from this one. Taste is of malt and some herbal flavors. I assume that is possibly from the heather used in the beer but it's really not a floral taste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer. I have had some other beers of this style that are much better overall and with more of the traditional flavors I have read about."
"D: It's easy drinking, especially on a hot summer's day."
"Overall - First Scottish Gruit and I must say I'm impressed, its not the best beer I've ever had but its not a bad beer at all. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"D-Very easy to drink, but not among the more complex beers I've had. I'd like to give this style another shot."
"The fifth entry in SwillFest 2011. It pours a clear light russet-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises toffee, dark greens, light cocoa, brown sugar, and plenty of wet grass. The herbal-ness is strong. The taste brings in more of the same, though the chlorophyll content is significantly diminished (thankfully). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda creamy feel. Overall, not that bad, really. I remember having this years ago and nearly retching with every sip, but such a reaction was nowhere to be found here. Makes me wonder what it's doing here as part of SwillFest..."
"This beer looks a lighter orange color. The smell has a sweet honey aroma. The aromatics still have that highly herbal smell. The taste is heather and I really don't like it. To be fair in comparison to the last time that I remember consuming this beer this seemingly has improved. I still don't like drinking this but it's perhaps the best part of this so called swillfest."
"O: My first gruit and a nice one at that. If I could find this more easily I may pick it up again- nice summer beer. It depends because even though I enjoyed it, nothing too amazing."
"Cheers!"
"I went in thinking this was just a gimmick beer, but came away impressed. It has some very nice flavors and is easy drinking. Definitely worthy of picking up again."
"This is easy to drink but subtle. It has a nice dry/sweet balance and seems to achieve a flavor that is unique to itself."
"Fraoch Heather Ale pours a light sherry-colored brown with a one-fingered head that lingers like an unwanted guest. The smell is malty and relatively straight forward -- I get little else, maybe just a hint of very faint herbs. Fraoch tastes dry, herby and wine-like, and I get grapes and floral notes on the finish. I'm no expert on this style, but Fraoch is very subtle, not in your face at all. It's clearly different, decently drinkable, and a change up from your every day beer."
"O: Pretty tasty, my first run-in with a gruit"
"O/D - Cool and different. Very floral and refreshing. Tasty stuff and probably a good example of old school beer styles."
"A Scottish Gruit - my first. Pours a golden cloudy color with a a thinner head that dissipates rather rapidly. Smells of grass, malts, and a meadow - unusual. Tastes of flowers, honey, and light malt. Very unusual taste - like an experimental ale with orange blossom honey. Light body, sessionable. Mouthfeel unusual, not so good. Glad I tried it, but would really like to try it fresh off the tap at the brewery as it seemed to be lacking a zippy freshness/true taste."
"Cool bottle. Poured hazy orange-brown with a nice white head that retained pretty well. Floral nose, with some malts and earth coming through. Nice herbal taste, with crisp floral highlights and a bit of citrus and earthiness coming through. Finishes pretty dry with a bit of a stale aftertaste, but overall crisp and drinkable."
"-Cheers"
"Dry, smooth, and light bodied. I like the uniqueness of this beer. It is well made, and worth trying if you get the chance. A nice change of pace beer."
"I really enjoyed this beer and I was surprised at how nicely the heather counterbalanced the sweet malts. The Picts knew what they were doing."
"Pours a crisp golden blonde with about a finger of head and mild lacing. Has a unique, subtle aroma of flora combined with honey and malt. Creamy flavor, similar to a belgian tripel, with moderate body. Silky and mellow through the swallow with a light hint of bitterness and carbonation during the aftertaste. Overall, a tasty brew, simple, but rich in its own way."
"D- This is just an ok beer. VEry drinkable but not a bunch of flavor or taste that makes you want to get another one. Not a bad beer, just an bland beer"
"Pours a copper orange color with a white head that doesn't last long. Sweet flowery aroma with spices. Fruity, herbal flavor, gets better as it warms up. Medium-light body, with a lingering sweet finish. I can only drink so much of this but it's a very interesting and different beer."
"The Heather ale is very interesting. It's light in color pouring a golden yellow color with a soapy white head. The beer is very smooth on mouthfeel and light. The flavors are herbal and very floral. The heather gives the beer a bit of a spice thats pretty interesting a different from most ales out there. I love the historical quality of this beer. Very cool stuff."
"Pours a clear amber color with a dense white head and good lacing. The aroma is of flowers and heather a very nice inviting perfume like aroma. The taste has a very nice floral taste along with a very good sweetness to it, very light very inviting. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated. Overall everything about the beer is inviting the smell and the taste. Also a very easy drink could easily be your session beer, not overly complex but just very good."
"If this beer was more readily available it would be a great session beer and I would drink it regularly."
"Easily drinkable and refreshing with nice herbal flavour."
"not terrible but the fact that it isnt as bad as the last two makes it drinkable."
"D: This is a very poorly executed beer. Only saving grace is in the taste, but unfortunately all other aspects lack severely."
"A good ale with some interesting flavours. It's surprisingly muted - anyone expecting an in your face experience will be disappointed. A worthy resurrection of an ancient style, and well worth sampling if you come across it."
"D - Very drinkable, either on its own or as a session."
"Overall: A good beer. Different but not different enough to be weird. If someone had handed this to me and had not said it was heather, I would have never known."
"Add Tag"
"I don't have a lot to compare this too, as I'm no expert on gruits or heather ales, but it does taste similar to other gruits I've had. The heather is pronounced and the flavor/aroma are quite pleasant. This would take some getting used to, but I think it's a pretty good beer."
"D- Definitely very drinkable if you dont mind tons of interesting flavors and a low abv you can session this one."
"This beer pours a golden honey in color with a one finger white head that quickly dissipated to lace the glass. The aromas are of grass, cloves, honey, and light malts. It kind of resembles a solid pilsner. The flavors consist of cloves, honey, a spice I can't quite name, and light malty sweetness. It's pretty tasty. I can't get the honey out of my head. It tastes like a pilsner with honey and a light spice. It drinks in between light and medium in body. It's exceptionally drinkable. This is my first of the style, and from the reviews it appears that this is a fine representation. I'm glad I tried it and I'd definitely have it again. Now I may have to try the other Scottish Gruits that WBCo. have to offer."
"Fraoch Heather Ale has an orange colour and poured with a 4 mm head that fades to nice lacing within a minute or so. This beer smells like grass to me, weird. The flavour is green and grassy up front with hints of grain. The aftertaste is nice and malty. It's a bit too grassy for my tastes. The texture is foamy and thick. Overall, an interesting beer that it is decent, but not one of my favourites."
"Very easily drinkable; the floral notes are not strong enough to reduce drinkability. Wouldn't want to have this every day, but a nice ale with an interesting story behind it."
"drinkability; the alcohol is well hidden and this beer is smooth, just makes one feel good and be happy, a perfect session beer."
"A bit dry and medium bodied. Very pleasant to drink and I easily could have another right away. All-around a solid beer."
"A moderate mouthfeel. Light carbonation. Mild but complex. All in all a unique but very pleasant drink. Much better when fresh."
"i'm surprised at how much i enjoyed this. definitely worth trying."
"D: This is an easy drinker. Much better than I expected."
"A disappointing beer."
"This smooth, well-carbonated ale caresses the tongue with a slightly sweet grain flavor, offset by a smattering of hops and an intriguing hint of citrus and flowers. Well crafted, this ancient recipe is definitely worth keeping around."
"Pours a very hazy golden orange color with a medium white head that goes down very quickly. Scent is very florally and fruity. I also get some wheat. There are mainly pears and apples in the nose with a somewhat grainy aroma as well. Taste is initially a bit lemony with some strong floral flavors. There is a slight hint of funk, which I wasn't expecting and adds to great flavor. Taste doesn't carry through with the wheat aromas, which I'm happy about. There are some bready flavors with pear and green apples as well. Taste is very well-balanced. Mouthfeel is very crisp with a nice dry finish. This is quite a refreshing beer. Drinkability is high. I think this one is a bit underrated."
"D - This is really easy to drink, and the fact that you don't want that funky aftertaste to be what you're tasting, you have to keep drinking it."
"Give them a try, you will be surprised. I could easily have more than a few of these. I think my Chardonnay-loving wife, may enjoy this beer."
"Highly drinkable, nice flavours, but they're not so intense that they'll wear you out after one bottle -- could easily quaff a few of these in an evening."
"Drink - The finish is very dry and a little floral. It makes me think of a dry white wine in a way. It's not a very over powering flavor so you could drink these all night if you wanted. While I enjoyed it, having experienced it once would be enough for awhile."
"Drink - A very different beer that I'm happy I tried. Can't say I'd seek it out again though"
"Overall, an odd beer, but kind of good. Just unique. I really wouldn't want to drink too much of this."
"D: not readily available but not a tremendous price and a pretty solid beer. If I saw it by happen chance I would pick it up again."
"Drinkability - I'd say a very good all-around ale, although I don't have enough experience with Gruits (in fact this is my first!), so I can't tell if this one is true to the style. But it's a good-tasting and complex enough beer!"
"It's kind of like a nicely brewed light beer. Not my favorite style, but fairly well done and a bit different."
"Pale amber body with a faint white head. Aroma has some strong fruity floral notes. Sweet malt comes through in the nose as well. Flavor follows the nose. Earthy, floral spice compliments a malt forward flavor profile. Moderate body with a clean slightly fruity finish. Very drinkable."
"(http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com)"
"It's a very drinkable combination- not particularly robust flavor yet still a satisfying combination. The 5% ABV is also a plus."
"Not a lot of head from this one, but the one finger that there was stuck around for awhile. Broken, but clinging lace. Color is a hazy 9 on the SRM beer color chart. Nice floral smell, with honey, malt, and sour dough bread. Good flavor of clover, honey, spices, wheat, a tinge of ginger, and malt. Not overly heavy in my mouth, but there is body there. Good flavor and a nice feeling as it warms my body. Good ale, would have another."
"Drinkability - Clean tasting crisp beer. There is not anything more to it so no point in going looking for it. Enjoyed it, good way to end my night."
"Drinkability is very good. I've found it to be very refreshing even on this cold Ohio night. Only drawback is I find it gets a bit muddled as it warms up, so I'm thinking this is one that's better cold. Regardless, this is definitely one I'll revisit from time to time."
"*my damn tongue was burnt on some soup today, so all the flavors and such aren't really coming thru on my palate, I'll need to review this again at some other point to give it more of a fair shake"
"D - I was expecting something really out there, like one of DFH's ancient brews, but this was a pleasant surprise. It is light, bubbly, and refreshing, but not overly sweet. I really like the herbiness, but wish the heather flavors were more prominent. This style would be great for an outdoor party on a warm day, and I enjoyed the history lesson behind the style."
"Overall, a solid beer that is very refreshing and smooth. My first Gruit so can't say how it compares in the style. Been hard for a non-hoppy beer to get my attention lately but this one did. Highly recommend. Not avail here in TX so picked up on my Dayton trip. If available near me, it would be worth a few a year especially in the smaller format. Also good to share with friends. [O;Y]"
"Drinks nicely thanks in part to the soft and subtle flavors going on. A good representation of the style and a nice brew."
"500 ml bottle. Pours copper , with a medium, short lived, white head, not much lacing. Aroma of ripe fruit, biscuit malt, with hints of honey and floral hops. Medium, smooth body. Juicy malt, ripe fruit and earthy hops fill the mouth. Finish is medium and sweet. Good beer to try once for $5 a bottle."
"Drinkability: Glad to have tried it. I would drink it again if someone else was buying."
"Purchased as part of a four bottle pack from the brewery. Pours a golden orange colour with thin white head, with hints of lacing. Smells really sweet, lots of herbs (I can't place my finger on the smell, but probably heather) and fruity. Flavour is almost like a mild pilsner combined with the herbs. A very nice beer. I bought this pack last year, and will likely buy this once a year as these beers are interesting."
"Conclusion: An interesting ale that is worth trying, and one that I would drink again without hesitation. A widely distributed way to expose the palate to this extremely old style. I wish it were just a bit more complex however..."
"Another excellent brew from scotland."
"D - Well it looks and smells good and then things are underwhelming I don't think I'll be running out to get another one of these anytime soon"
"very different ale, must have been nice to live back then!!"
"Despite the strange aftertaste, this is an enjoyable beer for me and nice for something different. Worth searching out every so often."
"D: This is terrific all around. I see why the style has lasted 4,000 years."
"D: I wouldn't drink this very often, but Fraoch is absolutely interesting and it was fun while it lasted. Pick some up if you see it on the shelf."
"From a 500 ML bottle poured into a Brooklyn Brewery glass. I have had two other offerings by the Williams Brother's brewery, the Alba Scots Pine Ale, and the Kelpie Seaweed Ale. Fraoch ranks above Kelpie, but I have to give Alba Scots the top ranking out of these three. Fraoch pours a light, yet opaque yellowish color. The head is impressive, and lacing runs down the glass as I sip it. The smell is absolutely wonderful, bringing to mind flowers and, for some reason, the smell of a field on a bright summer's day. The taste is fairly bitter, with the Heather definitely coming through, especially in the after taste. It definitely has a very sweet feel to it, with almost a wine-esque character to it. The drinkability is really the beer's only downfall, it is tasty but even the 500 ML was a tad much. Overall it's definitely worth a look, especially for the novelty factor (the style claims to date from 2000 bc), but the taste is pleasantly surprising. I'd recommend the Alba Scots Pine Ale over this beer, but Fraoch did not disappoint."
"Taste is light but interesting flowery-herbal quality with honeyish toasty bread and mineral. It has very light sweetness with very light bitterness coming up at the finish. Zesty herbal lemon quality comes on at the finish and aftertaste with hintf of dry but musty white wine."
"This beer has a very nice distinctive profile."
"."
"Poured a pint bottle into a Guinness pint glass. Pours a hazy golden orange, almost copper. About a half inch of white foamy head, looks soft and creamy. Aroma is interesting - very floral and spice/herb-like. The same goes for the flavor - lots of subdued flowery, spicy, and herb-like tones. Almost tastes like an herbal tea - maybe some chamomile-like undertones? Very good stuff. Highly drinkable and a nice, smooth mouthfeel. A darn good ale overall. I'd buy more of this."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink because the floral tastes are not very overpowering. I'm not sure if I could have more than one of these in a single sitting because of its mild amount of sweetness."
"I'm coming to realize that I like heather in my beer. This one did not disappoint, although I think Penny Weiz uses heather to greater effect, as the citrus notes are a better complement than buttery ringwood."
"D: defiantly something different, will have to hunt down more of this style."
"Drinkability: Very smooth. However, the flowery taste which was ok at first began to make me sick. By the end of the beer I felt like I was drinking pollen."
"Maltiness is fully predominant with no hop presence detectable - but since that's what I expected, so much the better."
"Interesting, my first gruet tasting"
"The body and mouthfeel mostly light. Low carbonation. Overall I just didn't find this beer enjoyable at all. It was interesting to try something like this, but the flavor of the heather just didn't sit well on my tongue or in my stomach."
"An interesting and refreshing brew. I'd pick it up again especially since the price tag was fair (3.99 for a pint)."
"D - A decent brew and quite different"
"Perhaps I romanticize the historical/archeological aspects of the beer a bit, but I love the idea of resurrecting old & lost recipes. I drank this in Inverness and Edinburgh and Dundee, and was really thrilled to find it on the shelf locally. I was expecting gimmickry but this is a solid, drinkable summer ale. As much as I understand the meaty chewiness of Scotch Ale to make it through a long North Atlantic winter, Fraoch is a perfect beer to compliment a warm highland evening, or to imagine a highland evening on your porch."
"This is an interesting experiment, and a neat recreation of a very old style. The world needs more gruits!"
"Great balance between sweet and bitter. The flowers are still around but lend way to grains. Very Herbaceous. Very wine-like as well. There is a soft cereal taste which I can't help but think reminds me of banana nut crunch with milk. Co2 was a tad low. The beer finishes with honey and canola oil."
"D: Low ABV and very easy to drink.... could be a good session beer. Nothing to crazy, but very good...."
"D: An interesting change of pace from other pale ales. I would drink this again, as this was a pleasant if not impressive brew."
"My only complaint about this beer is that I feel the heather flowers dominate the taste somewhat rather than the hops, malt, yeast or water used. It's still very good and I would buy it again, especially at this price point."
"Slainte."
"D. A somewhat interesting brew that goes down easily. I probably won't pick this up again, but I wouldn't refuse it either."
"D - Smooth finish makes this a very drinkable beer. Pairs well with spicy or aromatic foods. I would drink this again if available."
"I dont really have much to compare this against, but I really enjoyed this beer."
"A great brew; unique and enjoyable. I can certainly detect a uniquely Scottish character to Fraoch. Although it will likely be a while, I'm looking forward to having it again. A must try!"
"D- Pretty easy to drink. Its very refreshing. I dont think Ill have this again but it was well worth the try."
"Notes: A nice fairly interesting beer, like the rest of their offerings. This one is a bit more tame than the others though. Well balanced flavors between the sweet malt and herbal/floral heather (and other similar flavors). Nice beer to drink, but I don't feel like I need to search it out again, although I would get it if I found it for a good price."
"OVERALL: A decent drinkable beer. The nose was quite enticing on this one, and the rest of it made for a nice drinking experience. Give it a try if you get the chance."
"A really nice beer overall. I genuinely enjoyed it, but I only with the flavors were richer."
"D- being a style i have never had before and knew nothing about, i had nothing to compare it to- but it took awhile to finish, yet i'm glad i tried it"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a cloudy yellow with a big thick white head that retains well and laces very well. An herbal sweet aroma. Sweet tart floral flavors with a medicene like aftertaste. Very mild carbonation for the head that it produces. A very interesting brew to say the least."
"D: This would be a great summer brew; a quaffer to a degree. However, the floral finish might turn some folks off after awhile. For me, this one is light, crisp and refreshing, and something I would drink on a warm spring or summer day."
"Overall Drinkability - 2.5 - Interesting and different, but truly a one-trick-pony. This showcases the heather/juniper flavors and aromas at the cost of all other aspects. I would enjoy some more malt backbone to balance it out."
"Drinkability: This beer was a pleasant surprise as I didn't know quite what to expect but liked what I found. The beer very refreshing and drinks very easily. I'd definitely like another. I can see trying this one again as an occasional special treat and think it would be a very nice beer to serve at a party."
"Decent mouthfeel, a bit of carbonation but not excellent to be honest. A tad too watery. Nevertheless, quite an easy drinker, quite sweet but with a little bit of exotic aromas towards the end."
"I'm not sure what heather flowers would taste like on their own, but I can certainly taste them after smelling them. There's a flowery flavour that matches the flowery aroma very well, complimented by very subtle hopping. Mild bitterness. Light bodied and finely carbonated, it feels very crisp and refreshing. The flavour and aroma is a little bit slight and one-sided, but also quite moreish. This is a solid, enjoyable, and easy drinking thirst quencher. Delicious."
"D= 4.0 This would make a good session beer and is an interesting brew. It's very crisp with sweet flora of heather on both the taste and the nose. Good session beer"
"Poured into a pint glass."
"D - I had one 11.2 oz bottle, and could have another, but after that my personal taste would beg for something with hops. The sweet malts may become too much for me after two bottles as well. I would suggest this beer to someone starting to get into the craft beer scene since it doesn't really have any overpowering flavors."
"Drinkability: This beer is one that is less than typical, but is still highly enjoyable and very drinkable. Definitely worth the try, even if only for its unique characteristics."
"Drinkability: A great beer and definitely one of the more unique brews I've tried. Very tasty and definitely worth a try even if just for the uniqueness."
"pours a hazy dehydrated urine color. (sorry, just first thing that came to mind) poor, odd lacing. off white head. looks like apple juice and, HEY, kinda smells like apple juice. actually more like grape juice and malt. nice. slightly floral. the taste is so different. tart, candy-like sweetness with mellow malt. a lot of juice like qualities. slight yeast and grain. very short, dry finish. i really enjoy the flavors, they just don't remind me of the usual qualities of beer that i enjoy so much. low carbonation. masked alcohol. a lot more scottish malt and berries as it warms. very unique. reminds me of a white wine with malt. would make an excellent summer or spring brew. very refreshing"
"Drinkability: This style was first brewed in 2000 b.c. and i just tried it in 2010 a.d., so i guess if you've got a good thing going, you stick with it. If you see this one anywhere in your vicinity, i recommend you pick it up and try it out for yourself. I would drink this one more often if it was readily available...guess i might just have to make a pilgrimage to Scotland and round up some more. Slainte Mhath!"
"Very easy to drink. This goes down nicely, the alcohol isn't over the top and there is some nice malt flavour."
"Notes: It's tact might be a shortcoming at times, in particular when one is pleased by the offering and would hope that some aspects were a bit more assertive. But the brew works rather well as it is, makes for a nice social ale, with an interesting story and sturdy craft behind it."
"my first heather ale. its a pale golden brew...poured a 1 finger head that was white before dissipating. had a little bit of resiny lacing. smells light, malty, with some hops and floral characteristics. taste is grassy-like with some bready malt sweetness underneath. some floral type hops all the way through. finish dries up quickly, with only a faint bitterness remaining. not bad. i didn't really like the mouthfeel that much. for me the carbonation level was a little too high i think for the flavors going on it could have been smoother. its pretty thin bodied and drinkable, though i didn't find the style was really something i enjoyed all that much."
"Not sure I would go back to this. It does have scottish appeal, but Im sure there are better offerrings available."
"(D)- A solid beer with an interesting profile; different. I would gladly like to have this again in the future."
"Overall - I am big into indigenous cultures and ancient recipes, so naturally, I would be attracted to this beer."
"I did enjoy this brew. It's very unique and nice to step away from your regular IPA to try something like this. I didn't find it phenomenal, but I would gladly have it again."
"Taste balanced, low carbonation, herb & honey beginning and slightly bitter hop end (more similar to classic pale ales). Dry aftertaste, beer for drinking in the shade on hot summer's noons."
"Drinkability: Definitely something good to try out because of its uniqueness but not something I could drink all the time. A good experience beer."
"Fraoch is an interesting, off-beat ""beer"". I would have tried one eventually, just because of the bottle design and name, but have to admit it was to try a Scottish gruit. Now that I have, I believe my curiosity has been permanently satisfied."
"Quite high carbonation, which does well to make up for the lack of bitterness. Body is too thick though."
"The aroma was very floral and it abounded out of the glass. The taste was semi dry and had a slight and pleasant bitterness. In the mouth it left its hoppiness on the top of the roof of the mouth. I found it a very enjoyable ale."
"The beer drinks incredibly easily and has very low alcohol. But it is an interesting reference point for those who want to taste an ancient or at least old recipe."
"D - Very drinkable, although not quite the exotic beverage it purports to be."
"In a word - inoffensive."
"Overall, this is an all right beer. I'd heard a lot about it and was expecting something drastically different than anything I'd ever had, but this was somewhat disappointing. It's very refreshing, make no mistake, and has a unique floral quality, it's just lacking in big flavor. Definitely worth a try, though."
"Overall: A nice refreshing beer. Perfect for a hot summer day. Not for a dark autumn evening. I would love to try this one during the summer."
"This tastes kind of like a cross between beer and mint tea. It is really good. Very refreshing. I guess there are no hops in this (?) but yet it still tastes like beer. Kind of wish I had bought 2, actually, because I want another beer right now and I could totally go for another of these. I will be buying it again some time."
"Somewhat thin mouthfeel, not too carbonated. Overall a decent beer, not the best in the pack, and not something I would probably try again, but still at least they are trying something different."
"Overall this is a pedestrian ale I could see someone like Guiness producing. It has high drinkability for its medium alcohol content and mild flavor palate, but it is too expensive to be a light chugging beer."
"Yeah. Hardly the most exciting beer, but enjoyable enough for what it is."
"D- a brand new style for me, it's been fun trying to piece this one apart. i also take interest in the whole 'ancient recipe' gimmick, although if the aphrodesiac properties are true (which i'm beginning to think they are) then it may not be a gimmick at all... damn close to session strength and on point for weight, if i were an ancient scot there would be jugs all DAY son. nowadays i may long for 'normal' beer after one or two. where's my lass?"
"Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect from this beer. It has some very different qualities from the majority of beers I've had. However, it seems well put together and is easy to drink. Worth checking out if you've never tried a gruit."
"I'll keep this one in mind when the next Scottish Gruit comes my way."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is floral, with some fruits and hops. Taste is rather mild, some herbs and hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent beer."
"Drinkability: while I like the relatively exotic flavor, I don't know that I would call this a session beer. I'd gladly have it again, but since my favorite thing about this beer is how different it is from others, I think I'll wait awhile."
"Final Thoughts: This one seems to be the light, summer beer of my historic ales of Scotland pack. This stuff is meant to be pounded back. Light lager's should be replaced with stuff like this, that is for sure. All that being said though, this is the most disappointing beer in the pack thus far. It's good, and has it's place, even if it was a bit unexpected. Nothing fancy here, this was probably the macro brew of the past."
"Smells a lot like a wheat beer, ether, fruity, sweet. The smell does not match the flavor unfortunately, there is almost none. I cannot taste any heather. The beer is fortunately super smooth and easy to drink, just not a very interesting flavor. The flavors build as I drink more. I don't think I would get this again unfortunately."
"Definitely interesting start to the tasting. I can't imagine I got the full effect sipping this from a plastic cup--the sort you see next to the chair at the dentists' office--but still it was like something from a time long past. This is how beer was back in the days of gruit, mead, and the bubonic plague."
"It's easy to drink being so light, and the alcohol is never noticed. I could have used a little less bitterness, but then I see some reviewers didn't find it hoppy at all, so to each his own I guess."
"Liked this one a bit more than their Grozet ale. Subtle, complex and interesting. An easy quaffer but I took my time to enjoy this one. 2 down and 2 to go."
"D: Interesting and quite drinkable. Nothing too awing about the flavor, but it was a nice brew to try."
"Drink ability is average. Taste is odd, not bad just not that great. Dont think I would buy again but glad I got to try this beer"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Low carbonation and a light body. This beer was nothing special and kind of felt flat."
"Conclusion: This is another really cool historical ale from this brewery; I must say that of the three I've had from Craigmill, this is my least favorite...the really grassy/flowery flavors are pretty nice, but it's not something I'd drink all the time."
"For my first stab at an ancient style, I'm very pleased. This is a refreshing brew, as well as mildly complex."
"Drinkablity is very good! A wonderful taste with a light abv makes this quite an enjoyable beer! I could certainly have a few of these at one time. It is one of my favorite brews!!"
"Poured a hazed semi-translucent straw tinged amber color, thin and sticky head. Smells sweetly of flowers, thistle, herbs and honey, light biscuity aroma. Taste is reminiscent of a Ricola throat lozenge, but in good way, starts sweet and flowery before slowly transitioning into a more herbal complexity, slightly bittersweet finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, coats the throat and mouth, seems syrupy, but has a lighter feel thanks to moderate levels of carbonation. Overall, a great beer, very different experience that doesn't disappoint. However, I can't see drinking more than one at a sitting as the sweetness and herbal notes might overpower the senses, as neither are shy in this brew. Recommend trying, would purchase again."
"This was a refreshing brew that tastes great with a little patience. Very drinkable."
"D- A light, easy going beer with sweet, smooth, enjoyable flavors. I have regrettably passed this over so many times. Worth a try for sure."
"This beer pours a pale cloudy straw colour that has average carbonation that leaves a one finger head and a ring of lacing around the top it almost looks identical to a organic pilsner,it has a real floral,minty herbal smell about it,the mouthfeel is quite thin even thinner than most pilsners and it has a real floral minty taste about it and to be honest i definately prefer a hop taste than this taste so for me drinkability isnt high as it tastes kinda bland but i spose i love my hops so u might call me biased."
"Notes: This is a very interesting flavored beer with a very interesting history to the style of the beer."
"Light to medium bodied, but seems a little flat with not much carbonation. I didn't know what to expect from this one but it turned out to be very interesting. Not something I would normally drink but very refreshing and a nice change of pace to have every once in a while."
"33cl bottle. Pours clear gold with a surprisingly full white head that lasts. Smells very floral and sweet, with nice malt character. Aromas reminiscent of honey and ginger. Taste is again quite floral with nice spicy notes. Full, grainy malt. Dry finish. Light-medium body. Having no expectations going into this one, it was a very pleasant surprise."
"This is kind of drinkable"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The only real drawback for me regarding this beer is the thin, watery texture in the mouth. It has just a hint of effervescence, but nowhere near enough to carry the interesting flavors through to the finish. It's a refreshing beer that I would enjoy again even colder next time."
"Scotland is said to have 10 million acres of wild flowering heather. I, for one, wouldn't mind seeing each and every one of those acres dedicated to the production of heather ale. (OK, maybe leave a few for ornamental considerations, the flowers are pretty.) Fraoch is a fine ale, more so enjoyable than peculiar but somewhat distinguishing nevertheless. There is a simple reason this style ale has survived since 2000 B.C. - it's good."
"drinkability is just ok - the taste is good but without some carbonation it would get old very fast"
"D - Not a beer that I would recommend throwing back quickly. The thickness of the beer makes you relax and enjoy the floral nature. Overall it is a tasty beverage."
"A very round and very floral finish give a wholesome taste to the end. Drinkable and welcoming."
"Drinkability- very drinkable, I really enjoyed it! I definitely intend on getting this again, super awesome!"
"D - This beer is refreshing with enough unique details to recommend. I particularly like the unique taste and mouthfeel combination this beer has. When sipped it is at first flowery and carbonated, but this immediately evaporates into a very clean dryness with a lingering spice."
"Overall, nice, unusual and refreshing. I could drink a second, but might want to switch it up after that."
"Pours a yellow orange color with a small bubbly white head, it glows and stirs up tiny bubbles with each swig. Floral, fruity and unique in aroma, the heather flowers add an interesting component. Viscous, definitely a hearty brew, big body for a 5%'er. Sweet and lots of herbal tea on the back end with some subtle fruity bitterness. An interesting beer for sure, its everywhere, the price is right, its definitely worth a shot if you've never had it before. Try the 500ml format though, to me it tastes... weirder, in a good way, although i have not sampled it since the change over from the German style bottles to the large 'beer bottle shape' format..."
"Drinkability: Very interesting and quite good. Definitely something I could get again."
"D - Light, very pleasant flavor and low alcohol. Incredibly drinkable."
"The sweetness is a touch too much as the bottle progresses and the flavors perhaps a little too repetitive but this is a nice, unique beer that, if given the chance, I would have again."
"Drinkability - This is a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a clear golden color with a stingy white head that leaves my glass quickly. Smells of cooked corn, subtle floral fragrance which I assume is heather, a bit of ginger, some grainy malt maybe a bit of toffee as well. Taste is floral, herbal, with a grainy honey malt kind of feel to it. Crisp carbonation, medium body, sweet thin syrupy mouthfeel. I liked this one! Its different, but the herbs don't attack you like some other gruit brews that Ive tried. Light crisp and clean, if it wasn't so expensive I'd drink this more."
"D: If this wasn't so sweet it would be really drinkable but I've been nursing one for 45 minutes and probably won't finish it."
"Drinkability: If you're up for a little more honesty, then here it is: I've always generally avoided this one. But, I find it surprisingly refreshing and very easily drinkable. Maybe I'll give that Alba a try one of these days."
"I poured from a 500 ml bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a hazy gold with a whispy white head. The aroma was slightly sweet and a bit floral. The flavor was sweet adn light, no real bitterness. There were floral and vanilla notes. The brew was light in body and had average carbonation and a crisp finish. The beer was damn drinkable, and when I was done I was craving another. I bought this just to try the style and I really enjoyed it."
"I'll have to try more of this style"
"Aformentioned taste is really interesting. A little spicy in a hoplike way and also both herbal and floral in a very different way than hops can be. I fear my inexperience in reviewing leaves me without the terminology to describe it. This is my first gruit but it's very high drinkability will bring me back to the style whenever I run across it."
"Thin-bodied, smmooth, sweet and simple. Like Kool-Aid. There are hints of honey and herbal tea-like hops mixed with something akin to oak and minor sweet malts. Wouldn't call this a sweet version of a fruit beer but beer traditionalists might. I myself enjoyed the simple sweetness brought out by this beer along with the somewhat fruit juice flavors in it and could have this again anytime."
"Really good shit, a great 'one of a kind' experience for those who've never had this sort of thing."
"D: I found it very easy to drink, the sweetness balances well with the heather."
"D - Fraoch is quite drinkable simply because of how interesting and unique it is. The sweetness is slightly detrimental and I can't help but wonder if this is due in part by the lack of carbonation. My main complaint is that I wish there was some accompanying malt backbone to the heather that was used...the flavor was interesting but I think it could've excelled as more than a novelty if there'd been some interplay between malt and heather. In the end, this isn't something I'd drink all that often because it's a little too sweet and the flavor is a bit lacking. Still a unique and ineteresting beer, but I doubt it will ever ascend from novelty. I look forward to the other brews in the variety pack ""Historic Ales of Scotland"" that I got Fraoch in."
"I imagine you could have done a lot worse 4000 years ago :)"
"I could drink this beer quite often, it is light and delicate and would be very sessionable... shame I only bought one."
"*edit* as I keep drinking this beer it's changing character as it warms. I do believe one shouldn't taste this beer refrigerated! It is picking up a much more candy-like aroma. It's very mysterious, because I can almost recognize it but it's too elusive."
"D: Somewhat like drinking smoky beer-flavored water. Don't think I'll have another."
"Quite an interesting brew, but rather pleasant as well. Replacing the hops with the herbs used creates a profile that is alien to the palate, but one which is easy to cope with and enjoy."
"D: probably never get this again. Not that it was horrible, just not my type of beer. But it is unique"
"A really strange brew, not something I'd like every day, but on oddity that was worth trying. I wonder if hop-infused beers would taste as bizarre to the ancient Scots."
"How often does one have a Heather Ale, so it is difficult to compare it against others of the style. Notwithstanding, the beer pours a golden color with a smallish white head. The nose on the beer is honeyed sweetness, plenty floral, and sweet but very light malts. The beer is quite light bodied and easy to drink. It is very refreshing, very floral, and the sunflower like tastes are obviously the heather. The beer is quite honey sweet, no hop bitterness in the least. The IBU on this beer would be in the single digits. The aftertaste is very light, sweet, and very un-beer like. The ABV is completely hidden. This is a nice change up and worth seeking out to taste what heather is like in a beer. It is light, not at all prickly, and probably mead like in some ways."
"-Cheers"
"Very interesting brew and unusual style."
"I can't say that I knew what to expect so this could easily be the BEST heather ale out there but I don't have a comparison. Worth a shot for history's sake."
"D-Easy to drink could very well have more than one in a sitting."
"mouth is crisp and clean, drinks very easy. I would definitely consider this for a tasting especially during the warmer months of the year."
"Incidentally, according to the brewery website (www.fraoch.com) Williams Bros is the new name for Brewery Craigmill. The company relocated to a larger facility in Alloa to keep up with demand and changed their name, so this is the same beer as the Craigmill Fraoch."
"Drinkability: I could have a six but this is an aquired taste. This is my favorite in the Scottish ales pack I have. This does have pronounced lavender notes as well as some other florals--and I like lavender so it is a plus."
"Quite a fruit palate as well, quite light and frothy with a slight tartness that announces itself quite meekly, without any mouth-puckering or courage (speaking both literally and metaphorically there). Quite a sweet finish actually, with the only bitterness coming somewhere between the front and the middle of the palate topography. Finish is like a light unwooded Chardonnay, ie. crap. Again, warming up may go some way to improving the character, but it's otherwise not a stupefying drop anyway. Mouthfeel is quite thing and although its lack of body makes it drinkable, this beer is otherwise a disappointment to its parents, its family and its country."
"Drinkability- This is a tasty little number...one that I will recommend to my friends. If all Scottish Gruit is this good, I'm definitely a new fan of the style!"
"Another perfect session...just this one I don't inbibe in often. A thick, rocky head sits atop a young mead. I'm ecstatic about the spicy/sweet aroma...is this Heather? I'm in heaven, my first time with her and she's smells better outta the bottle. A light body carries thick honey, a touch of caramel, a symphony of fragrant, flowers...not nescessarily of heather now, thinking Lillys and Honey Suckle. The Heather provides a dash of warming cinnamon and possibly nutmeg. Definitely Vanilla. Easy body, refreshing and crisp, held together aesthetically by light lacing. Superb."
"D: Very good and very dry I could go all night over cards if you wish, but bring plenty of cash, bloke."
"Aroma from the bottle is strong and rich. Smells of heather flowers and grass notes. Cloudy golden in color with white bubbly head that dissipates quickly. Aroma from the glass is similar to the bottle but with some added honey and pepper notes. Wine-like taste with bubbly mouthfeel. Rich in honey, floral, lemon zest with some spice notes; mild malt leads to mild dry. Enjoyable and unique in flavor and personality. A great session beer for any season."
"D: Certainly a change of pace. A nice beer that I'm glad I finally tried."
"Very drinkable and gentle."
"D - a interesting beer, something that i would have again"
"I would recommend this, not only for its uniquness but it is also truly refreshing and tasty."
"(rated Aug 1, 2007)"
"It was a unique beer. I'll give them that one. Was it good? Not bad, but if you like the taste of flowers, then this is the perfect beer for you. Would I drink it again? I fully doubt it. It was too light and too flowery. Out of the 4 Gruits I've had from them, this is the one I cared least for. Flower Power!"
"From a 350 mL bottle poured into a glass. Beautiful amberish-orange color that I've not seen much. Smell is actually quite mild. Picked up some sweetness from sniffing the bottle before pouring, but not much aroma at all after pouring. The taste is quite mild with an interesting sweetness, and almost no bitter whatsoever. Perhaps this is from the heather/gale substitution for hops? The mouthfeel is VERY nice. It has a sort of stickiness (read someone else mentioning that as well), and the light carbonation gives it a nice bite. I would definitely drink this again. At the same time, I found myself not liking it near as much as I hoped I would."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp."
"This one pours a light, semi-hazy apricot color with little to no head at all. It smells like heather (whatever that is) and honey. Tastes very light and floral with some herbal notes. The reason I rate this one high is due to the fact that this is a recipe from 2000bc. Not many people in their life get to try something that has been around over a hundred years let alone 4,000. Definitely worth it for your beer/history geek."
"D: This is one of those oddly endearing beers. I'd never had this style before (that I remember), but I'm going to try to find others."
"The taste is nothing too crazy and is very malty without much balance. This beer is not made with hops, so its not very bitter. That being said its not sweet either. Very earthy, floral taste. Worth checking out but its not as good (complex) as some other scottish gruits. A little 1 dimensional."
"Quite limited, not complex at all, and not very flavorful. Glad to have tried this ""different"" beer, but not coming back."
"Pours a cloudy, goldy-orange with minimal head. Minimal lacing as well. Floral aroma with honey mixed in. Honey appears to provide the primary taste...it is very interesting and different from anything I've had so far. Quite good in its uniqueness. Mouthfeel is solid, balanced, medium light with a touch of sticky sweetness. One is very drinkable, however I don't see going beyond a couple as while it is unique it doesn't fit my personal preference for beer. I do recommend trying it since it is a supposedly ancient type of beer and therefore worth experiencing."
"This is my first gruit ale, bog myrtle and heather in this beer. Im drinking this out of my wooden mug from the Renaissance festival, it seemed appropriate. I can only comment on the color as I poured and the head, which is white and frothy and drops to a thin layer with a good amount of lacing. It smells a bit like a saison, sour and spicy, but it tastes a lot like a english tea, which i think is good. Regardless its a light, fresh and damn tasty beer. I can see why its been brewed for over 4000 years."
"This is my first Gruit, and it is very interesting. I am not familiar with the style at all, but it reminds me of a Saison. Recommended."
"very drinkable beer that is obviously different than anything else."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hazy amber color. Mellow sweet nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is sweet, doughy and mellow. Better flavor as it warms. $4.10 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Poured into a pilsner glass (I know it's not the proper glassware, per BA, but wanted it all in one glass). Hazy orange with yellow highlights. Aroma of crisp grainy malt, honey, slightly floral, slightly sweet. Nice flavor of pale malts, somewhat sweet, hints of lemon and grass, interestingly floral. Not sure what the flowers (heather) are supposed to taste like, but there's something different there that I haven't tasted before. Must be the heather, right? Creamy on the tongue, good carbonation, slightly warming, which is strange considering the low ABV. A very interesting and different beer. It's kinda strange not having any hop aroma or flavor, but it's a nice change and a nice treat. Everyone should try this interesting style at least once."
"Quite drinkable but lacks complexity and doesn't keep my interest very long."
"D- Fraoch Heather Ale is a very drinkable beer. I could see myself drinking a few bottles in a sitting without getting bored or too intoxicated. Good beer, will have to purchase again. Recommended!"
"Pours a cloudy toasted grain color with a small but dense off-white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is of toasted malt with some mild fruit & herbal scents. The taste has a malty sweetness, honey, lemon, with a flowery herbal presence. Nothing distinct but well balanced. The feel is moderate, with active carbonation, finishes dry. An average brew at best. Combines a pale ale with some flowery herbal notes but nothing that is outstanding."
"Try it you might like it... to hell with hopheads!"
"D: I wouldn't drink these all night long, but it was nice tasting."
"d: This was my first Gruit. I'm open to trying more, but I'm not willing to go to great lengths to get another one."
"D: Split a 12oz bottle. Nice beer. Would be good on a hot summer day. Glad someone is making this style still."
"D - An odd beer, one I'm glad I tried. I would drink again if only for the aromatics."
"Note:First attempt at the style. Not sure if a thin head is standard for the style. Rather enjoyable, and I guess sessionable. An interesting mix of beer and heather."
"M&D: light bodied and softly-carbonated, this delicious beer somehow tastes much better cool than chilled, as my cold-serving for the last bottle several months ago was nowhere as good as the glass tonight. Without the use of hops, the heather flower is never imposing on the palate, while the bitterness is still prevalent and mixed with unknown herbal edges and spices, making it a really quaffable ale~~"
"D - This seems like a very enjoyable beer for the backyard on a nice day. Definitely a great session beer."
"Interesting to try but not something I can drink more than one of."
"(Bottlecap says Williams Brothers Brewing Co. so that's why I'm posting this review under this listing for Fraoch Heather Ale instead of the other listing for the beer.)"
"This starts out slow but evolves into a very enjoyable offering. Would be a good nightcap for the first fireplace use of late fall/winter.."
"Drinkability - I think this is a must-try beer, if only for it's unique ingredients and taste. I will enjoy drinking it while I have it, but wouldn't make it a staple."
"Notes: All in all, a very interesting and enjoyable beer. A warm Spring day in the sun having an outdoor lunch would be the ideal setting for this beer. In a dark dreary pub in the dead of winter, this beer would be out of place. A food beer, maybe with camembert or better yet, Shy Brothers Farm Hannahbells...!"
"Drinkability- Easy to drink, but the herbal taste might get irritating after a few..."
"An interesting and drinkable style here. Nothing totally fancy. It's a change from other styles. Not something that I'd drink more than once though."
"Carbonation was light and made for an easy to drink beer, but the flavor is too strong and more than one or two would probably be too much."
"Drinkability is very high unless you account for the high price tag. Sell me this for 8$ a six pack and you have my standby beer."
"D= As an ancient style, this ale should be given a shot by all serious beer geeks. Not my favorite but damn drinkable and I can certainly appreciate it."
"d got to be one of the easiest drinking brews i've ever had. wonderful for giving to someone who ""hates beer."" the only thing i would change: up the crispness."
"D: Very easy going - tasty and refreshing. Very natural flavours and a very modest ABV make this a great session candidate - the floral flavours and touch of crisp feel present a brew that would be fantastic on the nicer days of Spring."
"Drinkability - Nothing really jumps out at me to make this very special. It's just got nothing but a little spice. it diesn't hold up well. i could probably finish this in about 5 seconds if i wanted to. This ones just not worth it."
"Drinkability - The heather taste is far to faint to make it very drinkable. Not much character to this one. Not unpleasant, but nothing memorable either."
"D - I think this is a decent session beer - if not a little bit odd. I have a hard time believing no hops were used as it's very nicely balanced. There's a bit of sweetness, but nowhere near as expected. Also, it's mildly pleasant compared to most gruit-like beers I've had; most of which are barely drinkable to my tastes."
"Pretty drinkable, a crisp and interesting beer."
"What a unique and fantastic brew. Pours a hazy yellow with a quickly dissipating head. Very much a floral taste with a nice malt background. Notes of honey also present. Extremely easy to drink and I can imagine having quite a few in one sitting. Enjoyed this beer quite a bit."
"This is an interesting beer and would substitute wherever dry white wine would work. But I miss the hops."
"Eric"
"D: Drinkable and interesting. Not something I would drink regularly and lot of, but would come back to it occasionally."
"This is an interesting beer, but I can't say that I'm a huge fan. It's certainly worth checking out given its unique flavor and left of center style. But, the nose and the flavor need to be a little more pronounced to elevate it to a good beer. Worth a try nonetheless."
"not as weird as i anticipated. interesting. worth a try."
"A very interesting brew. A lighter ale and a nice alternative if one is tired of hop heavy beers."
"This would probably be good while tending sheep in crappy weather. :)"
"As far as comparisons to other beers, the thing this most reminds me of is the Ginger Honey ale available in Sam Adams Brewer Patriot collection. I loved that beer for its different-ness, it's pleasantly carbonated and nectar-like flavor. Is the Fraoch worth four and a half bucks? Maybe not. But it's probably worth it once, and 12 dollars for the Historic Beers of Scotland pack is definitely so (pretty much one beer for free)."
"Pours a cloudy hay/straw color with a decent forming white head that slowly dissipated. The smell was very subtle but earthy for lac of a better word. First sip and I said Gingerbread, definitely gingerbread. That's al I could think about whil I was drinking it. AS I continued to sip, the earthiness came forward as I was trying to dissect the tatses. Light mouthfeel and fairly easy to drink."
"those who like dry white wine will most likely enjoy this. Floral nose, sweet start, dry finish. Refreshing. Pairs well with salmon or a salad with warm bacon dressing. Highly drinkable very smooth in the mouth."
"This is by far one of my favorite beers. The nose is full of flowers and light springtime tones. Not your usual hoppy beer aromas. The taste follows right along with the initial impression from the smell. Lots of honey and sweetness. Once again no hop taste. The sweetness and easy drinkability can almost cause you to drink it too fast and not sit back and enjoy it. Highly recommend this beer for those who are not big on hops or bitterness."
"Lots of carbonation, very bubbly, gave it an interesting mouthfeel. OK drinkability, a unique style, actually I was pretty impressed."
"D - This was pretty good. Only the second beer of this style that I've had, but I enjoyed it."
"Drinkability here is good, but its not something I'm going to drink everyday. If your a fan of this style as I am, this is definately one of the best."
"Wow, this is my first experience with a gruit. Poured a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium tulip. The aroma is earthy and floral. Its honestly kind of off putting. The taste reminds me off smelling flowers in my folks garden. You get a hefty amount of flowers but you still get that earth worm manure mixtures also. The mouthfeel is thin with just a bit of carbonation. I can honestly say I probably wont drink this beer again."
"D - Very interesting brew, one I'd enjoy again without hesitation. If you haven't tried a heather ale yet, this is a very tasty one to start with."
"A very different beer, and it is a must try for any beer geek."
"Got this in a ""Hisoric Ales of Scotland"" mix pack at Ward's Market in Gainesville. Had it chilled in a cool free Sam Adams glass. Poured a light reddish gold color similar to a well aged scotch with lots a tiny bubbles rising up. There was a small white head that dissapated quickly. The smell was almost non existant until the beer actually warmed up then the heather blossom, honey, and malt notes came out. The taste was really sweet like honeydew melon but there was a flower petal like finish that dried on the way down. All around a good after dinner beer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, it's a decent beer but for me the flavor just prevents me from wanting to drink it again."
"With a few more tastings I could probably grasp the style a little better, and I think this beer has potential if you understand what the purpose of the Ancient Ale style is and what to take from it. I'm not there yet, though."
"pours a brilliant golden color. pretty tiny head though. not much lacing. the main scent must be the heather. i've never had the pleasure of meeting this heather but it has to be her scent. taste is the heather (i guess), very floral, roses, no real hop character, nice subtle sweet malt flavor. pretty full bodied, medium carbo, dry finish. very interesting recipe!"
"I really liked it, couldn't drink it all night, but well worth finding. I will buy it again."
"Overall, an okay beer and certainly an interesting thing to try, but I don't think I will try this one ever again, but I might make a heather beer sometime on my own."
"This was enjoyable. Something different, but light and drinkable. Flavors blend together well."
"Interesting, though too similar to a golden euro lager, even though its an ale. Not my favorite style, but it's new and I can certainly appreciate something outside of the ordinary."
"One could quaff a good amount of this, and would be continually drawn to the simplicity of drinkability paired with the faint complexities and subtleties. Quite enjoyable."
"The flavors here are a bit mild, so I'd recommend pairing this with something lighter, like a salad or mild cheese. Still, I found this to be a very tasty deviation for my typical beer drinking. I haven't had much like it and recommend this to anyone interested in trying the style."
"It's a very interesting brew that I'm not quite sure what to think of. It is pleasant and fairly refreshing, yet probably not something I would come back to too often. Definitely worth a try though."
"This is one of the most unique brews I have ever tasted. The aroma is of honey, the taste is smooth malt and again, hints of honey, and it goes down smoothly. Loses a couple of points for the weak head, but more than makes up for it with pure flavor. Cheers to the Scots for brewing up this unique ale!"
"I hate reading peoples reviews that say ""its too malty"" or ""its too plain"". The style really needs to be taken into account when reviewed, not just how it pairs up against an IIPA or IStout. This is a really good beer, and unique. I'm glad that beers like this are still being made!"
"Well worth a try, i fear the sweetness makes this an occassional offereing for this cat"
"Slightly hazy deep golden yellow with a white head. Aromas of lychee fruit, chamomile and a slight hint of vomit (not joking). Flavors of light malt, mild flowery fruit, chamomile tea. This almost tastes like a Belgian blonde ale. Medium body with a light, herbal, bitter finish. This is not bad at all, if there are zero hops in this beer (haven't checked yet) then I am glad to know that I can survive in a beer world without them. But I would miss them."
"M&D: The body & mouthfeel for this is rather light with a dry finish. The linger is nice with some herbal bittering. Carbonation is tricky too as it doesn't appear to be very carbonated but the abundance of small bubbles seems to work well with the dry finish, accentuating it. This is a very different sort of brew but I really think I like it and would definitely have it again."
"Wow. I'm really surprised by this beer. I'm generally not a fan of ""spiced"" beers, or any beer where I can tell that spices have been added. But this beer works for me. I guess 4000 years of brewing lets you figure out a way to make it taste good. While I don't see this beer becoming a part of my regular rotation, I could see myself buying it again."
"A great, unique beer. A novelty, but also well crafted and I could easily drink it on a regular basis."
"D: This is a very good beer. The flavours are so unique and it provides for a very memorable taste experience. It's very easy to drink and is quite addictive. Now I want to try more Ancient Ales! If you come across this beer, buy it - you won't regret it."
"drinkability is pretty good. this is quite a unique brew, but the refined character works towards the strange mix of flavors present to provide a smooth and drinkable brew, provided the drinker does not take offense to the actual mix of flavors present. cheers!"
"If you're looking for something totally unique, give it a try. There's definitely nothing that I've tried that comes close. I'm happy for the experience, but I probably won't be returning to this one."
"D: good drinkability, unique flavor keeps things interesting thoughout the course of the drink. a definite recommend for something different."
"D - Reasonable drinkability, but hardly inspiring (especially at $5 for a 12oz bottle). Reminds me of an average quality German pilsner; herbal but not particularly crisp or refreshing."
"This was a unique beer, that I have heard has a taste very similar to what a mead would have been like: brewed with honey, flowers and herbs."
"This is a really interesting ale. It definatly has a strong presence of herbs and spices which combines to make an original flavor."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium light in body with lower carbonation and a dry finish pretty much sums up the feel of this brew. As as to drinkabilty I personally find it hard to drink more than 1-2 of theses in one sitting. The extreme flavor and forwardness of the herbs just is too much for me...still this is a brew that I'll always be coming back to great taste to this one, really do like it, but it is something that is better when you don't drink it all the time."
"There isn't any overall distinction that I can see for this beer, but I may have opened an older bottle. I don't know how long it may have been setting at the distributer, but the drink-by date is August 2008 so I feel safe in this review."
"Pours out nicely with a decent amount of head and a bit of lacing. Great scent, a very earthy and floral malt aroma. Excellent taste! Not only is it a great beer to try for uniqueness, but it's good on its own anyway. A very refreshing flavor, with a nice maltiness and a great floral/heather flavor. Goes down very easily. In fact I'm quite sad, since I'm nearly finished with the Scots Historic pack I have. Guess I'll have to get more."
"A very interesting brew, and with its rich history, this was certainly worth a try... Paid almost $5 for a 500 ml bottle from Total Wine and More in West Orange... pours a slight-orange, apple-juice color with minimal head... aroma is similar to that of a floral bouqet... very light, mild, with some minimal citrus overtones... taste was very crisp and clear, with floral notes, no bitterness and an easy-going refreshing charachter... a very unique and light brew which goes down as easily as a bottle of water... excellent mouthfeel and superb drinkability lead to a satisfying and enjoyable brew that would be a pleasure to drink anytime... A must-try, and definitely recommended..."
"D = All in all I'd say this is pretty drinkable. Interesting enough to have as a stand alone and low enough in ABV to drink more than 1 if you want."
"A decent brew, certainly worth a try."
"D - This is the second gruit that I have tried, and I like the style, but not better then I like about 10 other styles. Overall I say buy it if you have the chance, it's an interesting beer."
"Mild, but has a slight edge on the tongue. It is brewed using heather flowers and scottish malt, so you get a light petal texture/flavor across the palate. This is another connoisseurs beer, best enjoyed by someone who can appreciate it's complexities. Also bestenjoyed when fresh."
"Poured a cloudy dark golden color with a thin white head that didn't last very long. Aroma is very sweet and floral, and it smells of nectar. Taste is sweet also, but is balanced by the malt. This beer is incredibly smooth and easy drinking. Not much lacing on the glass. Not necessarily something I would seek out, but I would not turn down another either."
"Tried this on-cask last night. Was sevearly lacking in flavor, color, and texture. Very flat (I'm sure the cask has something to do with that) and kind-of watery. Some floral notes came through as it warmed, but it was a very lackluster beer overall. Not one that I would recommend in the least."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, but not memorable."
"Tastes flowery, earthy, herbal, pale malt and some spices. It took a few sips for me to start to develop a taste for this brew."
"An interesting beer that despite the lower score I recommend trying for historical curiosity. I'm wonder how similar this is to what was brewed a few thousand years ago."
"Overall score- 71/100"
"D: Fraoch is drinkable in the sense that it is rather mild, but has enough interesting flavor to keep the tongue intrigued. Abv isn't very high, and the mild heather and herbal notes are satisfying over top of the regular malt profile."
"The spicing and expensive four-packs are a bit much for me, but I'm glad I tried it as I have a friend who is allergic to hops. I'd recommend a BA try it at least."
"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated. This is a nice beer and a welcome change of pace. If you can find the Scottish four-pack of these gruit ales, then I would certainly recommend trying em if you're feeling adventurous."
"Drinkability: heather (fraoch in Irish) is used instead of hops, to amoratiser this genuine beer"
"D: Interesting and yes, it's quite drinkable."
"Anyhow, the flavor is complex but fairly subtle. Not my absolute favourite, but I went out and bought it again immediately after buying the first batch."
" Overall, very unique with some interesting complexities that work together well. Being a product of Scotland, share one with that special someone while watching the original Wicker Man and it'll be a great evening."
"Far from the best beer I've had in recent memory."
"Pours amber, decent white head. Smells very sweet maltiness. Taste is slightly sweet, malty with a nice medium body and light carbonation. Some strange aftertaste, I guess it's the heather. Overall pretty enjoyable and unique, worth trying for sure."
"Drinkability - Not bad. I actually like it."
"The appearance was clear golden colored, thin white head (read ""looked like a standard pilsner""). The aroma was pretty funky, probably from the heather the wort is soaked in. I've had a few other beers with this smell/flavor, Rogue Festive Ale comes to mind. The flavors are all floral and a little spicy (not hot spicy), kind of good and probably authentic for the style. Not my favorite flavor combination though, so my drinkability score is lower."
"Note: The fact that this tastes like beer did 4,000 years ago is pretty cool since it probably fueled the druids hoisting the monoliths of Stonehenge, but while that makes it interesting it doesn't make it good. I'm pretty sure the food they ate back then was pretty rot-gut too."
"D - Not a beer for everyday drinking but a good, intresting beer for every now and then."
"I have to say that I'm surprised. This is an unexpectedly delicious ale that can easily be enjoyed by itself or with a lightly spiced white meat."
"D-This is a unique and tasty treat. There is a slight contrast here between the dry malt character and what I believe to be honey. The aftertaste is very nice here as no particular spice overwhelms. There is just a vague spice character and residual sweetness that makes this a great after dinner treat."
"Not a bad beer and one I would have again, but one to drink when you don't want to think about the beer just enjoy it."
"This is an extremely drinkable ale. It has a crisp herbal aroma emanating from its generous head. When drinking, there is a bittersweet taste that is unlike any other ale I have tried. I was surprised that it does not have more of a hoppy flavor. It leaves a sweet aftertaste in the mouth, but I find it amazing that there is no alcoholic aftertaste that I can detect. At 5%, this is definitely a plus. I could see myself getting very intoxicated while drinking this beverage since it goes down smoother than most anything else I have tried. If you're looking for something light and a little bit different, give this a try."
"Comment: I have to hand it to the marketing department of Heather Ale Ltd because they make one hell of a package. It made me buy a four pack of their product. Not a bad beer, just nothing too special."
"d: very different brew. refreshing, light, crisp finish. worth a try."
"it is as complex as any wine you might try. History in a glass."
"Light bodied, smooth and very drinkable. An interesting brew, that according to the label, has been around since 2000 bc."
"12oz bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Slightly hazy amber-red body with a thin film of off-white head. Floral and fruity in scent, somewhat reminiscent of banana, though not like a Hef. Tastes fruity, floral, and somewhat nutty. The nut and banana-like qualities dominate the flavor. though that's not quite accurate. Medium in body. Tasty and quite drinkable, as well as unique. Not similar to most beers I've ever had, but I could definitely see drinking this one again. Delicious."
"D: A good, easy-drinking beer. It's nice to see a brewery brewing these historical styles, to allow us, the consumer, to be able taste a beer that is similar to what our ancestors drank. Very interesting, could be sessionable, but the price is inconvenient."
"Drinkability: Givvus another, willya? Extremely drinkable."
"Most enjoyable if you dig unusual beer styles, especially ones with plenty of history, like this one. This is my first gruit, so I'm no expert, but it would seem to represent the style well. I'll buy more next time I see it, but I wouldn't want to have it every day."
"Overall: A pleasant foray into the world of Scottish Gruits, probably my favorite within the style that Ive tried. Worth a try, especially for something thats out there without being stupidly over-the-top for the sake of being extreme."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer, very intresting and very good."
"The 500ml bottle was labeled best before 10/07 and a small ring of sediment on the bottle topped off a great new style of beer."
"This has been my first and only gruit. It is an intriguing flavor. Though I would glady have it again, the $3 price tag for 12 oz. is cost prohibitive."
"I got this in a four-pack of historic Scottish beers, which was just too much for me to resist. Aroma is strong, malty, and very pleasant. It pours out an orange-amber, rather than yellowish or brownish, with a thick head. Taste is a tad thin, but pleasantly malty with a nice bitter kick. A refreshing and smooth ale - I can see, or rather taste, why it has lasted for four millennia."
"Fraoch is alright but it was a little pricey but it is worth a try."
"Oh yeah, at $3.50 for 11.2 oz., not too impressed on value for the penny at all."
"D: Honey smooth without being too floral or sweet. It lightness and uniqueness give this beer extra points here -- I have not tasted a beer quite like it."
"A very drinkable and refreshing ale that is going down great on this hot May evening. Quite approachable and interesting. I dont remember the hint of ginger when i had this one a year or two ago, but it or a very similar taste is present, and fits nicely within this ale. Well worth trying, its nice to water my scottish roots with more than just wee heavies from time to time."
"Slightly red-orange, a bit hazy, thin head. Smelled like flowery honey, almost like a weak mead. I must say, 'twas delicious. Again, honey, flowers, a bit of an herbal bitterness that I think could have been more pronounced to give some bite against the almost-cloying honey flavors. I'd try it again, and I'd recommend it to those who like it sweet, but I've had much better Gruits (oh, when will Tom Baker begin brewing them again?)."
"drinkability is good. it's a fairly plain and simple beer, but nice and quite drinkable."
"Pours a big frothy head with a brown to tan color, but it has no lacing. Smell is floral, a new smell for me for sure. The taste is like flowers with some earthy tones. Reminds me a little bit of when I was a kid and ate flowers only not so bitter. It's sweet, but not very sweet and the aftertaste is a small little bit of plant-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very nice. Overall I would definetly try this again, it's very intriguing."
"Poured into my large tulip glass with a rich, dark Scottish golden hue (yes, I did make up that color, thanks for wondering). An impressive creamy off-white head, rested on top like a beer induced cloud. A good swirl brings it right back to life midway. The nose was of sweet malt and cold biscuits, with traces of clover honey in the finish. This fantastic malty tasting beer had a very low hop presence, as it finished with a light, sweet, eucalyptus like cooling sensation, I'm guessing a product of the heather flower. Seeing as though I haven't exactly trampled through the highlands gnawing on fresh heather, I can't really be sure. It had a VERY smooth mouth feel, with a medium body that lent to easy drinking. This beer pairs very well with panko breaded pork cutlets, served with London chop sauce. A firm nutty cheese like Samsoe (a Danish cheddar), or the semi-firm Cheshire, with its buttery finish, would be great served as an appetizerEnjoy"
"Non-existent head but did yield some moderate lacing. Even with a violent pour I couldnt stir much of a head up. It does have an appealing color that looks like a hazy apple cider. The aroma has a very earthy smell along with sweet floral notes and raisins. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, but is a touch watery. Light to Medium Bodied. It is very drinkable, but not enough to become a session beer. The heather offers a different taste as to what Hops delivers. It still has a touch of bitterness though. I prefer the taste of Hops to Heather. Not a complex brew, but it is unique and tasty. Overall Just about an all 4 good rating."
"Pours a very clear, brilliant amber with golden highlights. Frothy, big-bubbled head with a collar that sticks. Aromas of honey suckle, heather flowers, sweet clover honey, and iced tea. Minimal malt aroma and zesty earthy/spicy bits. On the palate, a sharp floral character braces things up, followed by metallic carbonation and a sweet, tea-leaf mid-palate that finishes off half-sweet, half-dry, and unlike a conventional beer. No hop oilyness, instead just soft flower oils that have some sweet flavors but no oily heaviness. Surprisingly full-bodied and flavorful, and very unique. What a wonderful beer."
"Definitely unique stuff."
"drinkability- a hearty brew but not too heavy with a clean lingering finish of heather. Nicely done"
"This poured from the 11.2oz bottle with a pleasant warm orange color and a well-former white topping of white bubbles. Theres a nice little flowery aroma that youd expect from a beer made with heather. The flavors are bolder and brighter than I might expect ... very much flowery, almost mulchy! Herbal and green, I feel like yelling some William Wallace quote. Beauty. (#2687, 2/6/2007)"
"Cheers!"
"D: Not something that I would repeat, but I definitely enjoyed this style that is new to me. I recommend trying this if available."
"a weird experience, but worth a try"
"In this case, I'm glad to have had this as a sample. Could have more if that's all there was. But following the 2 Belgians I just had, I'm spoiled."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with bubbly white head. Aroma of honey, lots of grassy grains. Taste was honey again, with malty raisins and bit of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was definitely a creamy smooth plus. This is not bad at all, and the history of this brew is certainly interesting."
"D - Although bottle says best by Feb. 2007, I think this beer is slightly past its prime. I remember its scent being intoxicatingly amazing, and this bottle is so-so. Try it once, especially if it seems fresh (i.e. best by date is several months in future)."
"D: One that every beer drinker must try at least once. The label claims a heritage for this style dating to ""Scotland since 2000 b.c."" That's a remarkably historic style, that's about as different as a beer can get. It's one I'm glad to have tried for the novelty, with flavors good enough to have again."
"Drinkability: Interesting and worth a try for the historical context; you can surely see why hops are an improvement on heather as a bittering agent"
"The taste throws another interesting factor into the mix. It is sweet, but not too sweet, and definately organic. Clovers, honey, and light malts are very gentle on the tongue. Amazingly smooth mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation. I could drink this all night, but it's a little too one-sided to keep my interest..."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden orange, with thin white quickly departing head - nose of malts , cobwebs , hopps , floral , and hay  taste of oak barrels , spices , earthy , mild hopps and malts - body thin , and crisp  aftertaste of hopps and short"
"Drinkability: Good and interesting but not something I want to drink every night."
"Overall: I thought this beer was decent, but nothing I am interested in buying again."
"I was't sure what to expect from this brew, but it reminded me of a light sahti, less sweet than I had expected. It poured a clean golden color with good lacing and a bubbly white head. Some nice floral notes and some spice in the aroma; good herbal flavors with a hint of sourness on the backend. Aggressive carbonation was my only complaint, but very refreshing and tasty."
"This pours a dark amber with little head retention that thins to some lacing. The aroma was a bit strong with a herbal like malt quality. The heather can be tastes as well. The taste somewhat earthy and herby, with a light quality. Not bad but not that drinkable for my tastes."
"Interesting`"
"Notes: This was quite a surprise. I tried this on a whim one day and it has become a regular for my wife and I. The herbal and floral aroma and flavor is so nice and this beer is so drinkable. Give this one a try if you haven't."
"Clear amber/gold, thin white head forms, settles to a thin film, some lacing. Smell is nice, really grainy, sweet, herbs, chocolate. Taste is sweet up front, very nice graininess, bready, medicinal herbal quality, very malty, very drinkable. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Has the nice earthy characteristics of a good scottish ale, like Caledonian 80-."
"Im really impressed with the ales from this brewer....consistantly malt-herbal tasting and infinitely mellow with a soft mineral mouth."
"this beer suprised me as to how good it is, a must try."
"I can drink a ton of this. Delicious and Zesty!"
"Pours to a very dull amber color with a small white head that beaks down quickly and just leaves a slight film on top. The aroma is floral but not in a hops way, slightly sweet and also reminds me of a homebrew smell. The taste has an earth herb taste that is very different from what I have experienced in the past. Some sweet characteristics as well, mostly caramel like flavors. It has a very dry feel in the mouth. This is an interesting brew but is not one that I would say I truly care for. Nice to try something new, but at this point in time not one I would actively look for in the future."
"It's an interesting brew. Not really my thing, but a good brew for what it is. Might add it to my ""in the mood for something different"" list."
"D - Not a great fan of this one, it was probably served a bit too cold, perhaps should have spent more time letting it warm. Will rereview later, but on this offering, would not go out of my way to find this one again."
"D - Despite my trepidations, this is a very drinkable beer, and I'm glad I bought more than one."
"Nice hazy orange color almost without a head. Smells fantastic, very floral, flowery, but with deep malts and a touch of smoke and honey. Possesses an exceptional light body with medium low carbonation, creating a very creamy mouthfeel. Given the light body the flavor is massive. Honey malts with a very unique flowery quality that I will assume is the heather, somewhat earthy as well. Again, a slight smoke aspect, typical of many scottish ales. Very well balanced, the heather manages to contribute bitterness yet it disappears almost completely from the palate once you swallow. Very clean, crisp finish. Very interesting. Amazingly drinkable, after I was halfway through my .5L in the first couple minutes I had to force myself to slow down. Very nice beer."
"Overall this is an exceptionally drinkable beer without a huge amount of complexity to the taste."
"Drinkability: High, I like this one quite a bit."
"(The Chapin Clan)"
"D - A tasty and interesting offering which is definitely worth trying."
"D: This is my second gruit, and I still don't know what to think about it. This is just a totally unique experience. I definitely wouldn't want to have more than one of these, but I'm anxious to try as many different kinds of this strange brew as I can get my hands on."
"330 ml bottle, bought at Mahlers Vinhandel, Frederikshavn, Denmark. My first heather ale. Cloudy honey coloured, moderate head. Nice aroma of heather flowers and heather honey, notes of earth, peat and fresh sea air too. Flavour is earthy and moderately herbal, but not quite as exciting as I hoped - still good, though. Mouthfeel is maybe a bit thin, the beer is fairly dry but some heather honey notes shine through. A moderate herbal bitterness in the aftertaste."
"I have to say that this beer is much better than the other product of theirs that Ive had....Alba Scots Pine Ale. However, Ill stick to hops in my beer, and leave the heather to beautify the Scottish countryside"
"Not to bad, a little different, but still enjoyable."
"Another unsual and complex beer from Heather Ale. Something off the beaten path but well woth the experience."
"11.2 oz bottel poured into and Imperial pint glass. I really like the label on this bottle, very medieval looking. A nice bottle just adds to the enjoyment. A nice foamy head a little more than a finger that slowly recedes to a very thick and sticky lace. Color is a dirty orange/brown. Smell is very sweet floral and malt with earthy notes. The floral flavor is little overpowering. There is also a bit of vanilla and berry included. Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and sticky. This is a very interesting adventure of a beer, but I don't think I could drink more than one."
"Too sweet and I'm not big on the background flavour that I'm assuming is heather. This might actually be a good example of the style, but it sure doesn't do anything for me. I can't even choke back the entire bottle."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a very low carbonation, and slightly dry in the finish. A very interesting, change of pace beer."
"If I could buy this by the case, I probably would-- mine came in a sampler-pack. I'd move on to something with a bit stronger flavor after a few, if I were having more than one, but overall this is a very memorable ale."
" This is different but not overly interesting from a taste factor. Still, it's a pretty easy drinker and well made enough."
"This beer looked delicious and smelled very interesting. Beautiful light brown in appearance with some orange and gold hues. Murky with visable sediment. Only a bit of head formed at all. The smell was amazingly complex. Here's the list that hit me (in order): flowers, vinegar, apple pastry, honey, cider, and cinnamon / spices. Unfortunately, that proved to be my favorite part. The taste itself did not suit me and I found it to be a bit lacking in overall flavor. It was somewhat tart and sour, and a bit watery. Herbal tastes, almost medicinal. An interesting beer to try, but I didn't finish the bottle."
"I find this beer very drinkable and a nice companion on a summer evening."
"Drinkability - Its very refreshing and different but the appeal is something that wears out quickly. I would suggest only a half pint at most after which the novelty wears off. I would have another if it was a hot day and came in half pint or less. Reminds me alot of cold herbal tea."
"500mL bottle this time, marked 6 months old, previously had it cask-conditioned. Nice, somewhat cloudy apricot-gold, with a thin off-white head that leaves thin lacing. Nose is more straightforward this time, with a prominent coriander spice, floral and light, with tar bright berries and a subtle biscuity base. Very mild carbonation, medium body, rolls on the tongue, pleasantly. The floral sweetness is interesting, herbal and citrusy, goes down smooth, finishing dry with a bit of earthiness. Drinks like a tea -- soothing and relaxing. Easily quaffable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability - goes down with some effort, was nice to try this ancient style, but that's it, don't want another one."
"Not something I'd drink all the time, but good to try. There are better beers from this brewery."
"An interesting style, you can really taste the heather in this beer. While a well made beer, I don't think it's really my style but hey, at least I tried something new today."
"Overall Impression: Brewed in Scotland Since 2000 B.C. Heather Ale is Probably the Oldest Style Of Ale Still Produced in the World. The Heather Flower also Know as Heather Tips Impart a Pleasing Aroma and Smooth Bitterness to Beers. With the Flavor Similar to a Chamomile/Mint Blend with Hot Lavender. Heather Pairs well with Honey. It is Also Great for Tea, with Reputed Calming Qualities. This Beer Definitely Has a Distinct Flavor with the Use of Heather Tips Instead of Hops. Very Smooth and Refreshing."
"Pours a cloudy straw hue with fluffy one finger buttermilk head and mild carbonation. Lemony floral nose with hints of coriander, maybe cinnamon. Very floral taste with cinnamony finish. A little hop presence buried deep in the mix. Well blended. Mouthfeel is of medium density with light carbonation. I got a strange burning sensation on my lips, although I couldnt tell whether that was coming from the beer or some other factor. I wasnt eating at the time so aside from the glass I was using, Im not sure where else this could have come from. I could see this making a good session beer - not too strong either tastewise or in terms of alcohol content."
"All in all, not a bad beer, but not a great one either. I wouldn't necessarily seek this one out, but Ive had a lot worse. Thanks to Ostevela for the bottle."
"I think this is a drinkable beer. I like a beer with a little more flavor to it but I think this is a nice one to put down with a fresh palate."
"This doesn't seem sweet at all even though there is some underlying honey flavour to it. Heather is dominant though doing the work one normally expects of hops and producing a complexity of flavour comparable to some of the better hops used for potent IPA's, but distinctively different. Unfortunately I'm not really up to the task of describing it. There is a rather oily feel on the tongue and a pine sap aftertaste which I quite appreciate."
"Pours out a hazy, rusty orange with a weak head. Smells lightly of bready, biscuity malts with a humongous perfumey heather aroma. Almost smells a bit minty and berry-like. Some yeast in the nose, as well. Flavor is big on the heather and berries with a light malt backbone. The malt really seems to take a back seat to the ""flavoring," but that seems to work out just fine here. Flavors thin out a bit in the end. Mouthfeel is light and prickly with bubbles. This drinks way too fast."
"D - The smell really gets to me. If it wasn't so potent I think that I would like this more. I can't take another sip without holding my nose. The insert said that it goes with ""rich and spicy foods"" so I tried it with some pepperjack cheese which overpowered it's taste completely. Went very well with a slice of Manchego though. If one could get past the smell then it wouldn't be so bad."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a generous head and a decent amount of lacing. Smell is very much like a green olive along with floral hints. Tastes very much like a flower so that must be the heather shining through. Very strange taste combinations. Mouthfeel is very dry especially in the aftertaste. Drinkability is limited in my opinion as this isn't something one could drink regular but rather try out for the novelty aspect."
"If you ever have the opportunity to pick up a box of ""Historic Ales from Scotland," I highly recommend doing so."
"This ale is not just of interest to antiquarians, as it can hold its own as a tasty brew whatever millennium it is. Well-balanced despite its lack of hops and a nice change of pace. The Pictish label art kicks arse too!"
"Its alright in my book. Light but not exactly easy drinking. I think one sampling was enough unless I'm drinking local."
"The beer pours golden and cloudy like a wheat-beer with a brighter yellow. The head is thin, virtually no head. The look is interesting, reminiscent of a bottle conditioned beer. Smells of flowers, with a deep roasted honey beneath. Very easy drinking, like a lightly sweetened water with a slight tartness and a firm tart aftertaste that lingers gently. Feels like an instant lemonade, slight oiliness gives away the alcohol and particulates. Very drinkable, if cost were not an isuue it would be an easy choice for an all day drinking beer."
"This was one of my contributions to the February meeting of the Michana Coalition of the Drinking. Bottle says best before October 2004, so take this review with a grain of salt. Poured cloudy, orange-brown. no head. lots of sediment. Nose is orangey, flowery, smells like an herbal tea. FLowery taste. orange flavor, some maltiness. interesting and not like any other beer i've tasted. Almost totally flat, which may boil down to the expiration date issue. Too strange to really be drinkable."
"Relatively light and smooth body with ""fuzzy"" carbonation. Intriguing, interesting brew, but I won't likely buy it again."
"-UF"
"But man I do still love hops in my beer..."
"D: Easily approachable, but it doesn't really bring me back for more."
"poured a cloudy amber color with a medium size white that left some lacing.aroma is yeasty,sweet and hints of honey. flavor fruity spices with a taste of honey.this a differant beer at 1st I didnt care for it.as it warmed up I started to get in to it."
"This beer has a ton of floaters. The color is a cloudy light orange. The smell is sweet. Reminds me of honeysuckle. The taste is somewhat citrus like. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth. No bite or negative aftertaste. The drinkability is fairly good. I like this much better than the first time I tried it. I could drink it again sometime."
"All in all a good beer, easy to drink and something unique. would be good as a session brew."
"This beer smells and tastes of apples. It is a refreshing and quenching beer with a green apple nose, start and finish. I like it alot and should keep some around for the times when I am in the mood for something fruity. There is some bread and cinnamon in the nose as well as the taste. The spiciness is like a chilled slightly spiced/mulled cider. Not overpowering just pleasantly there in the back."
"Very light bodied and quite drinkable once you get past the interesting and different taste."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy."
"had with some stilton and salami. the cheese was to rich and overpowering but the salami added a much appreciated spice to the beer."
"Interesting change of pace that refreshes and is pretty darn drinkable. Wonder if this what William Wallace was chugging back in the day??"
"Overall - An excellent beer.... recommended..."
"I had never before tried a heather ale, and I did not know what to expect from this beer. The beer has a pale brown-gold color. Did not have much of a head. It has a unique, mellow flavor, something that can obviously be attributed to the use of heather flowers. Though an ale, the familiar ale bitterness is very muted. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer, and is recommended for anyone who wants to try a new style of ale."
"I've been wanting to try this for awhile, but waited until I could find a place where I could mix it into a six pack. 330 mL bottle with best by April '06 notched on the back. Pours a bright and radiant, unfiltered orange/gold with one finger of white head that leaves some wisps of lace. Smells flowery (roses?, probably heather), with a light honey aroma, sweet malts, and spices (ginger?, orange?, tea?, mint?). It has a fairly strong aroma and a medium to full body that is smooth, yet tingly and evenly coats the palate. It tastes malty with the same flower/spice profile, a low bitterness, and maybe some nuttiness. Has a fairly high drinkability as I went through the bottle fairly quickly and wished I had another. Both a very nice beer and a unique one that makes for a good change of pace - will buy this one again."
"I'm going to have to try this beer again to decide how much I like it, but after one tasting I can say that I really appreciate its distinctiveness and there's no doubt that it has a lot of desirable qualities."
"Pours a hazey dark copper color with little head. Smell is very slight with hints of honey and flowers. The flavor starts out with bready maltness and fades to a kind of floral, honey flavor. When I first saw this brew I thought it was a gimmick, I was very wrong. This is a very good ale, much better than I thought it would be, will be picking this one up again."
"Not really sure what to give on drinkability. I'd have another, but after that the uniqueness suggests trying something else. Maybe the Kelpie offering by the same label? Intriguing..."
"Overall: I was more impressed with the nose than the taste, but it's still a good beer. Have access to four packs of Fraoch or a mixed four pack with other Heather Ale beers and although this is my least favorite I certainly don't object to it and would gladly drink it again."
"pourde a slightly hazy deep peach color with off-white head. Smnell is earthy, dark fruity, sweetish, toasty and very enjoyable. Taste can only be described as very herbal. Seems to have characteristcis of herbal teas I've had in the past. Alsp seems to taste of flowers (in a pleasant way) . Finishes with a slight dryness and more flowery notes. A very different beer than any I've had before. Very pleasant."
"I am going to have to say that this is tied as my favourite beer of its style, light, but keeps its malt roots. Highly recommended."
"Another great ale by Heather. What an interesting brewery. This one is the perfect session ale."
"I have no idea what the abv is, but I could feel it when finished. Don't know much about Heather ales, but I have to believe this is one of the best. You should try this beer."
"Malty aroma rises from freshly opened bottle. Pours a deep orange with very little head. What head there is has soapy look. The aroma has slight floral tones with hints of heather (no suprise since fraoch is Gaelic for heather and this ale is made using traditional techniques and flavored with the flower of the heather plant). The flavor is very malty with no strong bitterness at the front but it does coat the tongue with a slight bitterness on the finish. The malty sweetness stays on the palate long after finishing the drink. Definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoys malty beers."
"Not particularly drinkable; I guess this just isn't my style. When it comes to Scottish ales, I'll stick to the wee heavy."
"This one was the most popular brew served at the World Beer Festival speaking engagement featuring British Ales. By the end of the session, all of the labels had been ripped off and tucked away in drinkers pockets to bring home. I've never seen something so popular. Great new style which I would love to get to know more about (howeevr, the prospects aren't so good). Pete Brown from All About Beer magazine explained to us the history here and would really be interested in trying out more ancient ales."
"Pours a golden amber with very little head. Earthy aroma with a little citrus. A very smooth taste with just a little bitterness in the aftertaste, but does not linger too long on the palate. As it warmed up to near room temperature, the taste improved dramatically"
"I consider this a must try due to it's history and uniqueness. After that you can deicide for yourself if you'd drink again. I will."
"If this beer is available in your area, it is definitely worth trying. The taste wont change your life, but it's different enough to make it worth a trip to the store."
"Add on edit: Another reviewer said it was like ""chewing on rose petals"". That hits it right on the head,"
"Let me begin by saying this is absolutely unlike anything I have ever tried before. I poured a pale bronze - orange colour with ZERO head. Only a negligible amount of thin lace ring. The smell reminds me of hops and oatmeal. Dry oatmeal. A good bit of malt, as well as a faintly noticeable grassy herb undertone toward the finish. Strange. Pleasant, but strange. The taste is fantastic. Great malty taste will herbs present there, too. I hate to be so vague, but this is really unusual stuff and I don't know how to describe it. The mouth feel is a bit thin, but I believe if it were heavier, it would be offensive. Overall, very unusual, but very pleasant brew. Glad I gave it a go."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with 1/2"" white head that fades to spotty lacing. There are plenty of floaties present. The aroma is good. It has a mild pale malt scent along with floral hints and fruitiness. It 's herbal smelling with a tart edge. The taste is decent. It has an earthy flavor that boasts of herbs and floral hints. Pale malts act as the base, but the herbs offer most of the flavor. It seems a bit watery. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent gruit, but I've had better. It has a nice aroma."
"So, your curiosity and your tongue and your nose will be pleased. What more could you ask for?"
"I like some other mention that this one really is better when sat out for awhile so that the smell and taste can be more subsetiable. But coming from Scotland I would of thought that it be a bit stronger than what it was here."
"SLAINTE! Beertracker"
"A pleasant break from hoppier and bigger bodied beers. Unusual in its content and complexities. Pours a slightly hazy orange-yellow color. Suprisingly good head retention from moderate co2. Very perfumy and floral to the nose. Slight malt sweetness, no hop detection. Flavors of mild sweetness, more like honey than malt. Heather tips make me feel like I'm chewing on rose pedals. Quite refreshing in its aromatics and honeysuckle flavor. Soft and delicate (almost powdery) to the palate. Finishes...er, fades into a thin sip. Very nice beers."
"D-Very interesting beer. It is very subtle in flavors but does have a nice complexity. It would really benefit from more carbonation but the malts work well with the heather."
"Dated best before Apr 06. Pours a cloudy dark yellow, nice carbonation with a small head, not much lacing afterwards. Hoppy, floral scents kinda sweet, very unique in scent and taste, I guess it's the heather. Sweet taste with a little bite at the end. Light body. This would make a great session brew because of the alcohol content and drinkability of the brew itself. I highly recommend it at least once in your lifetime."
"I really didn't know what this was when I bought it, and I wouldn't have imagined a Scottish beer to be this light and subtle. Pours a light golden hue, smells and tastes flowery and light. A nice little bite and aftertaste is there, and there isn't anything bad about this beer. These days, I'm really not into light and delicate brews. For those who are, this is a nice one. Unique."
"Heather Ale is a keeper. Having said that, the aroma could be more compelling and the flavor more... uh... flavorful. These guys brew some interesting concoctions and deserve praise for brewing outside the box. Occasionally waaay outside the box. The price sticker reads $4.79. While it isn't quite worth that, I'm not sorry that I had the good sense to try this offbeat gruit."
"This is a good brew. I may not go out of my way to find it again, but I'd certainly not turn one down were it offered to me."
"Pours a pond water green color, very mucky. There is no head to speak of. The aroma is floral and sweet. The taste is mildy sweet and watery. Not much is going on. Mouthfeel is medium-thin bodied and watery with low carbonation. Overall, this is a weird brew. Perhaps, I'm not enjoying it as much as I could be, but I miss the hops. Still, it is pretty refreshing and inoffensive."
"Light head with a golden color, no real lace on the glass. Very floral aroma and slight malt in the nose. The taste is malty with no real bitterness, but a strong floral aroma. Its almost like a bitter with no bittering hops, only finishing. The taste is smooth, but not terribly satisfying. Definitely drinkable. Its a nice pint for historical reasons."
"I'd be interested in finding out what a fresh sample would entail. This bottle made enough of an impression for me to keep an eye out."
"Overall I would highly recommend this beer."
"BBE aug 2006. Amberbronze beercolor, quiet hazy and good and lasting foamhead the leaves laces. Nose is very herby, sweet gale and heather flowers are used but giving a chily and bit ""gagel""like but also flowery and bit malty. Taste is spicy too litle ""Kloosterbrau melissengeist"" like, litle sweetish but overal good taste with maltyness, litle caramellic and full. Aftertaste is quiet spicy again remembering litle of pepper. This all together with good carbonisation make mouthfeel ok. Drinkability is also not bad but litle to spice and sweet to me but that's personal; no bad brew at all."
"Feels...a little thick. Kind of oily, or slick- but not in a bad way. I'd say this is pretty drinkable- it's different, unique. The floral quality is really nice- a bit too sweet after a few I'm sure, but quite nice."
"A short, dense, bubbly, pale, cream-colored head leaves spotty lacing. An opaque, pale, brownish, caramel beer. The smell is sweet with tangy caramel and overripe fruit. A toffee, sweet, floral front; a light, sourish, caramel-malt middle: a little thin, a little oily. Sour toffee finish shows alcohol and tangy, sour fruit juice. Interesting: tangy, fruity, malty, caramel middle with a sour, bitter, finish. It's very ""old"" tasting (not stale, but like an ""old-style"" beer... if that makes any sense). Good."
"Slightly hazy pale amber colour. Short stand of white head that rapidly thins to a smattering of lace. Smells of sweet maltiness, a bit bready, very floral, with a little honey and herbal character. Heather flavour is quite strong, but still backed up by malt sweetness. Floral and herbal towards the end, which finishes on the caramel sweet side, but still with a bit of dryness. The body is on the light side with moderate carbonation. Interesting beer and definitely worth a try."
"Bottle: Poured a hazy orange color beer with a small head and not much in terms of retention. Aroma is somewhat malty with some strange sweetness. Taste is also sweeteer then expected though it does not seem to come directly from added sugar but more derived from one of the other ingredient. Light spices also hit the palate at the end and again are hard to properly identified. Nice and enjoyable overall but would not necessarily seek this again."
"Pours a cloudy orange with a small white quickly dissipating head. Smell is tart floral and grassy with a smattering of spice. The taste, after trying Heavyweight's version, is much more balanced and subdued than I expected. Refreshingly crisp, malty, and ""flowery," like chewing on a dandelion stem with a beer chase. Mouthfeel was medium, pleasantly so. This was a fine brew that is easy to drink. The recommendation of having this with a salad or mixed greens seems right on the money. Highly recommended if you are new to this style."
"Notes: First heather beer. Very interesting taste that the heather imparts, almost like a hop taste and aroma, but different. This beer is a little too sweet for my taste though."
"The taste is just a bit too earthen for me. You have this flowery flavor mixed in with a honey wine mead character, and it just ends up being a bit queer. Sure, the bottle looks good, but this stuff is close to drinking Febreeze or sumfin. I'll take hops over heather anyday. This was like flowerpot runoff. I guess the taste is a bit unfamiliar and strange. Overall, one could drink this stuff. I probably will not buy this again, but it was unique for sure. Feels like what you would drink if you were ruffing it using stream water and fresh picked flowers and the like. Interesting."
"Pours an orange amber with very little head or visible carbonation. The aroma is a touch sweet with a little flowery medicinal scent. Taste is smooth, nice maltiness with a touch of honey in the finish. Finishes a little sweet, but the herbal nature of the beer makes this fairly nice. Very interesting beer. Was not sure what to think of it at first, but it grew on me and I would buy this again if in the mood."
"Drinkability- Not your everyday beer. I can definitely see the hobbits drinking this out of their lead chalices. This completes my Brewery Craigmill experience as I have had the Alba Scotts Pine Ale, the Seaweed Ale, the Gooseberry and the Ebulum Ale and now this. All of them an experience, some of them very good and one of them that was great."
"My favorite offering from the 4 pack sampler from this brewery. Pours light brown, almost transparent. Looks like a darkish ginger ale. A small head with moderate carbonation. Smells of light malts, barley, and flowers. Taste follows with a nice flowery taste with a strong foundation of light maltiness and barley. I'd definitely drink this one again, a heather ale that has good body."
"Taste: Pale malty/barley flavor, very low carbonation, I'd say almost flat, which I guess historically may be true to form. Faint sour aftertaste. Sort of tastes like a Beer that got heatstroke."
"Certainly worth trying. I could probably handle a pint of this with a meal. A bit of peat moss in there, bitter, long dry finish. Citrus, honey,some malts. Barley in there. Understated carbonation. I wonder how this would be three years aged. Orange colour."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a decent head. Smells sweet like honey and slightly grassy. The taste is very mellow. Slight malt up front leading into the sweet heather taste. The heather lends a great herbal quality to this beer. The overall effect is slightly reminiscent of a good mead, however it is not nearly as sweet. Definitely an interesting beer. It is light and very drinkable, and the unique flavor could enhance any situation."
"So far, I've not been displeased with any of the beers in this gift pack."
"While this beer pours a very pale burnt orange in color, the color is extremely thick throughout the beer. A thin filmy head lay on top of the beer. The aroma reminds me of camping in a wet forest. The taste is very mild, the hops are there, but nowhere near predominant. There is something else that I would assume is the heather. It is akin to a very, very, very subtle evergreen taste. Just the slightest of hints. The other flavor I notice is a bit of honey. The beer is pretty sweet and while I enjoyed my solo bottle, more than one of these would be kind of boring to the palate."
"I didn't find the heather to be as strong as I thought it would be in this beer. It could have been responsible for that ""hit"" in the flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. That's entirely possible considering that I have had no prior experience with heather and would have a hard time identifying it. Good beer, though."
"Taste is very herbal, mixes of sweet hops, floral hops, and a wheaty flavor is burried in there too. A nice complex flavor on this beer. Has a really nice slippery body too."
"Despite the appearance, it's a damn good ale! Pours a hazy, cloudy orange colour. Pleasing to look at. But almost no head whatsoever, and lacing is sparse. Fortunately, it improves greatly afterwards. Dry malts, some herbal and bittering hops, floral scent, and heather. Taste is even better. The heather and floral taste evens out the sweet and dry hops. Aftertaste is a quick whoosh of bitterness that quickly fades. Slick and thin mouthfeel. Highly drinkable as a session ale and as a nursing drink."
"I've read about this beer for years so I was very excited to finally give it a try. It poured with an attractive light caramel body and a floral malt nose. The head was gorgeous, very finely beaded with a creamy look to it - great stuff. The mouthfeel was more robust than I anticipated given the other peripherals. It gives off a very dry, feathery malt taste that, at times, hints at brandy. The finish is more vinous, dry and pale I say. Overall, this a very easy-to-drink yet different beer. It's definitely worth giving a shot."
"Tasted: 12/06/04"
"M.F./Drinkability- Smooth feeling on my tongue. Not quite as high on my drinkability scale as Heather Ale Ltd's other products. I could see this getting a little boring after a few bottles."
"Taste was tangy, herbal, a tea-like dryness, and some alcohol at the back. After taste was grainy. Light, refreshing, thirst quenching. Very unique."
"Taste is light malt and crisp. A bit spicy but not alot going on until the finsih which is dominated by what I would presume to be the heather flavors. Really nice flavors in the finish. A bit thin though and not alot going on except for that finish and the accompanying aftertaste. Decent. I like that flavor but expected it to be stronger in the beer. i'll have to try again, maybe it's just too new to me."
"Had this beer as first for the evening. It poured nicely but had quite a heady aroma with large bubbles. Very floral smell with a bitter first taste, but mellowed toward the end. Unique beer, but don't believe I could go on a bender with it. All in all, enjoyable, but not one I would attempt to stco regularly in fridge."
"A very different beer experience, but this little ale was a really nice change, not something i can imagine drinkin all night but once and a while"
"I don't want another."
"Slàinte!"
"Refreshing and perfect for a spring afternoon outside amongst the blooming flowers."
"Refreshing, a good change-of-pace, and very drinkable."
"Overall this is very drinkable and probably nice to have around to surprise guests or for a change yourself."
"I've finally found a bottle of this after a couple months of looking. I first sampled this at a BA gathering thanks to qarre. I'm glad that I finally get a chance to properly review it however. It pours a nice orange color with a slight tinged white head. Aroma is intensely floral. Some sweet notes also mix in. Taste is very similiar to the aroma (as one would expect). Starts off very flowery but finishes with nice bread like malts. Very well balanced and very drinkable. An excellent brew in my book. Only if it were easier to find around here."
"You should make an effort to try this ale."
"Pours a medium gold color with one finger of head. Not too much lacing. The smell has a lot of malt and honey sweetness. It's a bit spicy too. The taste is grassy and malty, with peppery spices. A bit of honey in there as well. Very unique. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and smooth. The drinkability is good as well. Not too bad for not having hops!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Im not overwhelmed by this one. There is just something in the flavor that I just can't place that turns me off. Maybe it is the heather flowers, don't know."
"Dirty looking pale copper tone. Carbonation looks low upon viewing. Thin head but big bubbly collar of dirt brown tone. Nice aroma. Leather, floral hops, vinegar, lemon juice and sweet malt. Interesting, but good. This beer's got a little ""snap"" to the taste. Spicing is evident, but held in check. This heather flower really adds a nice sweet rose-like accent. The malts are sweet and unassuming. The aftertaste is dry and inviting. Interesting beer. Good beer."
"This is one I have gone back to several times for a change of pace. The best one I have had from this company, without a doubt."
"Pours out a light golden color with some copper accents. A small to moderate head developed, then quickly dissipated to a foamy collar. Smell is quite unique. It smells spiced and floral with some faintly nutty characteristics... quite intriguing. Taste is certainly above average. Very complex flavors of herbs, spices, and malt. Finishes somewhat dry, though not as dry as wine (as the bottle compares itself to). Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. I think this is a highly drinkable beer, but probably not for a macro-drinker's first experience into ""good"" beer. This one is a little more complex and reserved in my opinion."
"Light malt characteristics up front followed by floral flavors & a mildly bitter finish. A decent beer, though nothing exceptional about it."
"Pours a hazy gold color, with good white lacy head and good carbonation. Smell of herbs, a grassy smell, or possibly heather flowers. Taste is very...different, I still cant decide if I like it or not. No hops, instead a sweet and bitter herbal taste combines with the malt profile of this beer. Good mouthfeel and quite drinkable once you get over the weirdness of it. I would drink this if given to me, but I don't think I would ever buy it again (unless my girlfriend, who's name is Heather, asked me to get it for her...)"
"Color here is a deep golden with a tinge of copper. A creamy, soft looking white cap just coats the top of the glass. The retention is good and sticky lace patterns appear with each taste. Aromas are floral and malty-sweet and somewhat fruity. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a dry, somewhat vinous feel. Flavors are soft, subtle and easy to enjoy. Interesting flavors include fresh flower (heather?) cocoa powder, dark chocolate, dish soap?!! (heather?) A sweet flowery/malty flavor with caramel traces finishes things up. A very different and interesting beverage to pass over the palate indeed."
"This is how a start-up beer should taste. Even better as it warms."
"Poured a hazy yellow with a thin white head. Has an herby aroma . The taste I can most compare with a belgian strong pale ale or triple, although it is lighter and more herbal. This beer has a mildly fruity and alcoholy dry finish. This is a refreshing, interesting ale. Although, I was expecting something more unusual tasting with the lack of hops, but this is a nice beer worth trying."
"A very unique and flavourful taste. Soft floweriness on the front of the tongue, mild in the middle with more of the same, but with some slight sweetness of the malt, and a balanced bitterness on the finish, with a very, very fresh barley taste left lingering on the tongue, heightened by the highly fragrant heather presence. The finish is by far the best part of the taste. For those of you who have been to Scotland and smelt the wild heather, you will know that the brewers have conjured the aroma of heather quite well in this treasured time-honoured beer. The mouthfeel is not powerful or off-putting at all; in truth I was actually expecting an altogether bolder feel on the mouth, considering the ingredients of this ale. I believe it could use a little more body, perhaps a strengthening of the heather flavour. This factor, however, makes it a highly drinkable beer, whilst perhaps sacrificing some more potential taste. This is hard to review with ""style"" in mind, because it is the only heather ale I have ever tried. I thoroughly enjoyed this, however. All I can say is that a stronger heather flavour would satisfy me all the more so. I believe they could make this a truly exceptional and very exclusive beer for only a select few people with discerning palates. Very singular, very unique. You may enjoy this more if you have visited Scotland."
"Taste is wine-like, dry and astringent. You can taste the alcohol but it's never overpowering or unpleasant. Mouthfeel is thin, with little aftertaste. Interplay of ingredients on the tongue assures you'll come back to this beer to figure tham all out. Works well as either a winter or summer brew."
"Very drinkable brew, a unique beer that everyone should try."
"Sweet, heather, grassy, smokey. Just a few words to describe this fantastic brew. I wish more breweries would use heather in place of hops more often. This is on of the best beers I have ever had. I guess you could say that I'm speechless. I love everything about it. The superbly balanced taste. Sweet and dry at the same time. The orange colour with a perfect two finger head. The smooth feel going down. I could drink this all day."
"Clear, light amber in color with a low, brit-style head, Fraoch Heather Ale presents little in the way of apprearance. However, the subtle but substantial floral bouquet brought about by the use of heather flowers is to die for. Light in body and alcohol, highly drinkable, pleasantly floral - this is an ideal beer for summer consumption. Without hop bitterness to mask the malt, the subtleties of pale malts has never been more pronounced. The yeast character is similar to that of Belgian brews, slight esters complementing the heather aroma."
"The fact that the label announces that it is still illegal to use heather to brew beer in England, but that they still do it (they are big rebels) isn't sufficient to get me excited about this beer."
"Had this beer along side a couple Sam Adams so it was an interesting contrast. My first impression was the bottle. Very cool logo and artwork - it made me expect something celtic in nature. Poured up a dark golden, almost orange or maybe red but had very little head. What head it did have was lost quickly. The color still looked nice in the glass however. The aroma was easily classified as floral, sweet with a hint of malty... something. A bit fruity maybe. The taste was sweeter than I expected. With the strong floral scent, I often expect a balance of bitter hops, but this one wasn't that bitter. It felt not flat in my mouth, but the carbination was pretty weak - it somehow fit with the light body though. I enjoyed the taste, but not enough to drink a lot of it. I could see this being something of a desert beer. And I bet it would be good with a sharp cheese."
"This was one of the most floral accented beers I've had, it's rather unique."
"I like it. I probably won't ever drink it again."
"My overall impression of this beer was the taste of eating a fresh blueberry with it's skin peeled off, if you know that taste."
"Poured a lightly hazy yellow orange with a nice white head. The smell is incredibly malty and has a lovely sweet floral aroma. the taste is very nice - the malts remind me of a typical English style pale ale or bitter, and the heather seems to augment it quite well. This is a bit of herbalness in the finish that reminds you that this is not a typical English style pale ale or bitter, but the malt structure is quite solid with caramelized and pale malt flavors being predominant. Very smooth and drinkable, fantastic session beer."
"This is modestly drinkable, as there is nothing about it that is bad. Nevertheless, there is nothing particularly memorable about it either. I won't go out of my way to have this again."
"16.9 oz bottle. A light golden colour with a small white head that dies quickly. Aromas are of sweet scottish malts and the floral beauty of heather. Taste is very light, flowery, and heather-like. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery for my liking, but the drinkability was very, very good."
"Drinkability: I don't know if I got a bad bottle, the best before date is June 2005 so it seems like this beer should be pretty fresh. I'll review this beer again a few months from now, but as far as this particular bottle goes, I'm not impressed at all. If it weren't for this breweries Gooseberry and Wheat ale, I wouldn't even think about giving this beer a second chance. Not a good beer."
"It is very malty tasting, with a sort of smoked flavour, an initial ""spark"" of heather spritz on the tongue followed by a subdued malty finish. It must be admitted that this bottle cost more than some 6 packs but if I am ever looking to impress someone or just want to try some interesting again it would be well worth a shot."
"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a hazy copper colored, with a smallish head and some fine lacing. Awesome floral aroma meets the nose. Taste starts out with some malt sweetness, finishes with a floral spiciness from the heather! Mild carbonation. Definetly different. But a throughly enjoyable and drinkable beer. Will be picking up a few more of these soon."
"Bottle with ""Best by 2/01"" date notch. Ah, a traditional Scots drink for the only holiday in the US with a Scots aspect. And an interesting brew it is. Mossy odor when I crack the bottle. Pours a hazy brown, about pale ale color, with a thin head. Taste has some sweetness without being cloying. They don't mention if there are hops at all (don't they need some to be allowed to call it ""beer," so sweetness seems balanced by heather, giving it grassy notes and the dry finish, as advertised, plus a very faint citrusy aspect. Well-made relic of those days of auld lang syne."
"Pours an almost clear, orange amber color, with a short-lived white head that leaves a delicate ring of lacing. Nose has a floral bouquet with sweet malts in the background. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Taste is, not surprisingly, unusual but quite pleasant. The heather bitters the toffee/caramel malt characters very well, resulting in a nicely balanced and very drinkable ale. If this is what the Scots drank 2,000 years ago, then they drank quite well."
"This is a really interesting concept for an ale which I clasped onto immediately. Pours a bubbly copper color with a very thin lace on the goblet. The malty aroma has tones of floral heather. The ale is very smooth and malty with a woven heather floral touch throughout. The body is refreshing with a moderate bitterness. Entirely well-balanced and easy on the senses."
"Pours with a hazy orange-amber color with minimal head, even after a vigorous pour. Aroma is the only thing this beer has going for it. A very floral aroma from the heather. This is brewed with heather in place of the hops. This really needs some bitterness though. I has sweetness and the tangy heather flavor, but in my opinion I really miss the hops."
"Nice looking brew when poured. Decent frothy off-white head that reduces to a lace of tiny bubbles. Clear golden amber color. Floral aroma that is hoppy, but then again, not quite hoppy. Interesting use of something other then hops as a bittering agent. From what Ive read elsewhere, there are no hops used in the brewing of this ale, just heather. Only a hint of malt in the aroma. Smooth brew with a medium mouthfeel and very light carbonation. Light bready malt notes with only a light sweetness. The finish has a mild bitterness that balances out the brew rather nicely. Due to the lack of hops, however, the bitterness is unique to this brew. The bottle says it has a dry winey finish. I didnt observe this in the bottle I sampled. This was a good, drinkable brew, but did not stand out as much as I had hoped. Definitely worth a try though."
"Overall, this beer is unique and interesting. Definitely something you should give a try, but not one I'll be looking for again anytime soon."
"Not a session brew...but acceptable."
"Thx"
"Great brew. Highly recommended."
" Medium body, crisp and a bit tingly on the tongue. Nice spices dominate. It is floral and a bit earthy. It is not as intensly flavored as some other herb/spiced beers, but it is definitely not lacking flavor. Some citrus notes here and there and just a bit of sweetness round it out. It is very drinkable, and even though it is dry, you could sit down with more than one. My mouth is sucked free of fluid at the end of a sip, and a nice smoky flavor lingers."
"ave"
"A bit sweet up front, with some bready flavours. It then goes very dry, and transitions into apples & herbs. Quite unique. Medium bodied in the mount, but somehow stays heavy on the tongue after swallowing."
"A mild noise is following a strong head that lingers to almost stick to the side of the glass. A slightly heavy body is followed by a spicy fruity taste with a whiny finish and faint aftertaste that that just melts away."
"Interesting beer. Pours a light amber color and has very little head or carbonation. The aroma is grassy and maybe a little floral. Tastes like weeds (heather). Not too great of a taste. Interesting, yes, but not very good. The drinkability was not-so-good and the mouth feel was about average"
"Pours a dull, cloudy, reddish-earth color. Nice thick head that falls a little too quickly. The aroma is a mix of flowery-sweetness and fleeting hops. The taste is really remarkable. Its a mix of fruity sweetness and maltiness as well as a dry, tangy flavor. The finish is often marked with a powdery, astringent sensation. Surprisingly drinkable and very interesting."
"Notes: I've also had this served from a bottle and just had to try it as a cask-conditioned ale. It has been awhile since I had the bottled version, but I recall the malt flavor being a bit more prominent. The aromas and flavors of the heather are a bit stronger in the cask-conditioned version. You could probably approximate the flavor by pouring the beer into a glass and leaving it in your fridge overnight."
"A very nice looking brew that is a clear deep amber with heavy hues of orange. The head is slightly off white and fairly minimal, but it does manage to leave a continual lace from the residual. This is clearly a very complex ale that provides many different sensory opportunities ranging from its earthy sense to the elegant spice notes and onward to the very malty and caramel dominance. The flavor is quite sweet with the underlying hops doing little to disturb the malty sweetness. Very smooth feel with little bite or crispness to the finish. Faint hints of the heather drift through the brew which begins to weaken on feel as the brew warms toward room temps. This is very enjoyable beer to be savored singularly on an ocassional basis."
"Overall: Along with the Scots Alba Pine, this is one of my favorite beers from Heather Ales. Its even better on Cask. At $3.99 for a Half-Litre in the bottle, it is rather expensive, but well worth treating yourself to one if you have yet to try it."
"Deep golden with low retention.Nice big floral/hop aroma.Babysbreath? Flavor is sweet and floral with good hops and sweet malts. A most interesting flavor. Earthy, woodsy and sweet. Body is a bit light but interesting blends make up for that shortcoming. Not one I'd drink often but I'd love to try it on draught."
"This brew poured a small sized head of fine to medium sized off white bubbles. It has a cloudy amber brown body with some carbonation clinging to the side of the glass. It had a smooth malty initial taste with some, but not much tang to the finish. It was very smooth with a good full bodied flavor."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle with the Pagan label, it pours a very nice looking gold that's just a bit hazy. The white head is initially thin and then disappears almost immediately. The smell is a very pleasant flower/herb, with a hint of medicine and a nice malt backbone. The taste is most noticeably herbal. It has a dry finish and is really very smooth. It certainly is a nice change from hops, but not an everyday beer."
"Very aromatic beer with a lot of spice in the nose and a hint of smoke. Spcies come through in the mouth and leave a biting finish. A mint-like flavor was perceived in the flavor after a while. Found this one to be a bit astringent and couldn't get past it. Aftertaste was not so pleasant. Hops were not present at all."
"After having been impressed with the two other beers I've sampled from this brewery, the Fraoch was a letdown. For a beer that touts itself as being brewed with heather, I really expected quite a bit of floral notes in the aroma and flavor. The heather seemed to lend more of a stodgy herbal flavor. Quite typical of Scottish ale in the malt, which was substantial but overall bland. The heather never did anything to liven the beer, and my overall impression was ""blah."" Not bad, just boring."
"Pours a golden light amber color with some black pieces of sediment that sink to the bottom of the glass. Nose is sweet nectar, honey, and flowers with a touch of smoky peat. The taste is complex being full in flavor and yet also delicate at the same time with notes of spicy herbs, honey, fruit, dry malts, and dry white wine. A grand brew and one of the most unique beers I have sampled. A must-try for anyone. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Came in a 500ml brown bottle with freshness date on the back. Great label. Hazy golden straw colour, nice big foamy white head, good lacing. The smell is fantastic, berries, flowers, a little bit of grass, very sweet. Flavour is sweet and flowery, some hay, a crisp aftertaste but not too dry. Something you could sip on all day, especially in the great outdoors in the sun."
"Hazy, orangish-yellow color with a thick, creamy head. The malty, fruity, and floral. It also has an interesting aroma, I am sure which is the heather. I have never smelt heather before, let alone in a beer, but I found this to be a very fragrant beer. The flavor is malty, floral and grassy. It is a very smooth, easy drinking, light-medium bodied beer. An interesting beer, with a unique flavor and aroma."
"Thanks Loki for my first Heather Ale, I loved it."
"My first Heather Ale...great floral nose as you'd expect...very unique...also some sweet maltiness on the nose....pours an orange tinted gold....cloudy....no head...or lace as you drink....body is medium...firm enough....big floral flavor combines with a zesty spiciness..the sweet malt is there as well and adds a nice dimension....a real interesting beer to taste...Not one I'd be able to drink a lot of but a nice change of pace....I love unique beers and to me this is pretty unique..."
"The mouth feel is very crisp and clean and goes down very easily. This is a very drinkable brew and would make for interesting food parings. I think I?ll have another."
"All-in-all, Fraoch is a good beer. I enjoyed this beer quite a lot, and it is quite interesting, but it's more interesting than it is tasty. This does not mean it's bad. It doesn't mean I will never want another. What it does mean to me is that this beer has an element that many others do not have, along with appearance, aroma, taste, etc. Fraoch has ""history"" and that gets high marks from me."
"I was not totally impressed by this particular brew. It poured a medium head and it did leave a good lacing on the sides of my mug. To me it had a fruity, citrusy aroma to it. In my opinion it had a bitter taste to it and I noticed it had an aftertaste. It also had a cloudy appearance."
"Overall, I find this beer to be quite decent. The herbal flavours are interesting, and it's easy drinking."
"Pours clear medium golden, with a thick white head, slowly dimishes to a good lacing. Aroma is sweet, flowery, grassy, like a spring day. Flavor is clean, spicy, sweet, flowery. Hints of rosemary in both the aroma and flavor started to come through about midway. Body is medium, ends dry, lingering flavor."
"This ale poured a hazy, golden-orangish color with creamy white foam. The smell was very nice: sweet, malty, flowery, with yeast and citrus aromas, too. The taste was slightly sweet (honey-like), lightly flowery, with some citrus, and a slight bitterness (hops?) in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, with medium body and low carbonation. This ale was extremely drinkable! I was very impressed and suprised. I had seen this in the store many times, but for some reason was turned off by the thought of ""heather"" in a beer, but wow, was I sorely mistaken. This is one fine ale!"
"This beer came in a non standard size bottle but it had a very cool label with celtic designs. Fraoch pours a pale ale with a thin white head that dissapates quickly. The taste is mostly of herbal tea (the heather I suppose) but there is also some beer under there. The malt that comes through tastes like your average low end pale ale so it's a good thing that only a little comes through. The herbal tones of this ale is what makes it good. Complex earthy and almost honeylike flavors nip at your tounge. Like hops, heather has a mild sedative effect so it is a good herb for beer. This is definatly an ale I will be drinking more of."
"pat"
"The taste was remarkably good and it went down smooth, leaving little on the palette after the fact. I highly appreciate this one and look forward to having it again."
"Feels good in the mouth not too much carbonation...and is very drinkable in my opinion"
"The finish is not long, and a bit sharp, which keeps the malt from being overwhelming. Its not an overly-complex brew, but it is well-balanced and very quaffable. A very good session beer."
"The taste is so light, sweet, and utterly ethereal, this belongs in a class of it's own. Lovely, full texture, honey, citrus shining through with every sip! Perfect with food, dessert, or when you deserve a reward for being an exceptional example of humankind."
" This scottish ale was a pleasure to drink. It's very refreshing and I will definitely be a repeat buyer of it."
"I really liked this huge beer. I say huge, cause I got it in a bottle that was like a 22oz or bigger. I saw on their website the history of the beer and what it was all about, so that turned me on too. I liked the smooth fruity taste that it embowed, plus the almost pine-like taste too. The finish was good and easy to swallow, so it wasn't harsh on the buds."
"The pour is a pellucid deep orange or amber, if you so desire with a creamy beige head that is average in size, the lace is decent and clinging. Nose is earthy, heather; peat or smoke tones also present. Front somewhat sweet, the top skimpy, finish is sparingly carbonated, dry somewhat bitter aftertaste. A different taste, not unpleasant, but I miss the hops, and the bite, but still for something different, give it a try."
"Golden coloring with a thick white head. Medium carbonation. Has a fruity, and believe it or not, a kind of beef stew/bouillon aroma as well. Has a flower-petaly flavor; herbal and spicy also. Has a tendency to dry the mouth out. Not bad, unique in its way; tastes well made, and it's drinkable for what it is, but it's not something I'd go back to with any frequency. Nice to taste something so different, though."
"Kudos to Heather Ale Ltd. for reviving an ancient style!"
"This is my kind of beer.  Fraoch pours out a deep golden colour with very little head.  The nose is pleasantly floral and herby.  Taste is also herby.  I admit to no knowledge of the flavour of heather, but the taste I got from this beer was similar to rosemary.  The flavour wasn't too strong, but was well equipped for the strength of the beer's own flavour.  Not too heavy a feel in the mouth and went down smoothly.  Only loses marks tor the lack of head."
"Pleasant all around, but not hugely memorable... if they were drinking this good 4000 yrs ago....wow."
"What an interesting beer... hazy golden copper, with thin lace which has large bubbles resting on it.  Aroma of sweet malt and spice.  Flavor begins with some grainy flavor, with a spicy / herbal tea-like finish.  Just a hint of bitterness in the finish, with an alcoholic warming effect.  Medium body with some prickly carbonation.  The history of this beer alone makes it worth a try... a very good change of pace."
"It is times like this when I regret having to give a beer a score.  Every beer has a time and place.  Though the flavors may be alien, we really need to consider giving it a grade appropriate for the style and resist the temptations to contrast it with other styles!"
"The smell is floreal and herbaceous. The taste is different than the smell let's think. It's sweet, but not sickly. It has a very equlibrated taste, with honey in the smell. I noted the absence of hop, and it's strange than without it, this beer appear very equilibrated."
"Slightly hazy orange / amber in hue, topped by a thin, but tight layer that leaves loose lace.  Pungently floral and spicy aroma from a combination of Kent Goldings hops and Heather accompanied by lightly tart esters, dry bready malt and light caramel sweetness. A combination of mild hop and dried heather petal bitterness is perceptible at first, but dry biscuit and bread notes quickly assert themselves and diminish both light caramel and residual sweetness. Hop flavor is meager and masked by the spicy Heather flavor.  The light body and mild overall malt profile allows the flavors of heather and biscuit to dominate in a pleasant manner that helps with the drinkability.  Finishes very dry w/ lingering toasty malt notes.  Fraoch is an unusual brew-- the heather petals added both a bitterness and flavor that provided uniqueness to this otherwise unremarkable beer.  I could see this beer becoming cloying after more than two, however."
"Truely a unique brew. Fraoch pours into a golden color with a nice white head. The herbs and spices flow up to the nose as if to invite  you to drink this incredible brew. One taste of this and you are hooked."
"This is the easiest of the Heather Ales to get in my area.  It pours out a nice golden color with a nice light tan head.  A nice hops aroma to it and other aromas that might be the heather.  Intesting body to it, slightly fizzy due to the clearly evident higher level of carbination.  Seems a bit cloudy, but it may be due to that."
"Slight golden in color.Nice floral nose,and a little malty.Decent head.The taste of this is like no other that I have ever had,very drinkable if it wasn't about 4 bucks a bottle.I wish other people would try this style."
"This was a very interesting beer. Very malty. The heather flowers apparently aren't very bitter, but they do lend a very subtle floral quality to the taste. I'd be willing to drink this again I think. Very interesting beer. It was a surprising find. I just happened upon it at a liquor store I frenquent and there was one bottle sitting there. I had never seen it before."
"Slightly hazed with a thin white lace. Nice use of the heather, perhaps a bit over carbonated for my liking. The sweet heather flavour plays well of the dry malt character."
"Best before date of Dec. 2001.  Real interesting old recipe -- heather flowers replace (or supplement) the hops.  Hazy brown with darker than usual sediment.  Small head that stays around for a minute.  Musty, winey aroma, a little clove maybe.  Impressive mouthfeel, a little spiced banana and apple-like flavor.  Interesting flavor with residual yeasty/fruity/flowery impression.  The smell works well with the taste on a deep drink.  Beer is a little on the sticky side, though.  Are heather flowers related to hops?"
"This is a very interesting beer.  I enjoyed it, but it's not something I want to have when I kick back a put down a few pints.  It's got a nice cloudy amber-colored body, with a thick head that quickly fades.  The aroma is a bit thin, but spicy - a bit like the scent of a forest.  The taste is what truly sets this beer apart.  The herbal taste dominates (sage comes to mind) and has a very dry finish."
"I had heard about this ale,and saw it at the local specialty store.Was pleasantly suprised didnt like the smell but had a nice  fresh flavor,never had a beer with that kinda flowery-like taste,best way I could describe it."
"Wierd tasting, but interesting and tasty, i don;t know if this would be a regular in my fridge, but it really is a good beer, interesting!!!!!!!!!"
"Upon first taste, I really liked this beer.  Unique and interesting, but very drinkable.  Smelled of woods and bark, which I guess is what this beer is know for.  Has a winey flavor as well.  I am not sure if this goes with any food, except maybe cheese."
"Great beer, hops or no hops. Light malt up front and a beautiful floral aroma. A must try."
"Notes: For its uniqueness, we highly recommend this ale. As a beer, it is remarkable, extremely drinkable and refreshing. ""Fraoch"" is Gaelic for Heather. This is one of the oldest ale styles brewed in history (from heather flowers and Scottish malt)."
