4.8,19.1,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.75,5,"Instead of hops this is made using redwood tips, like a gruit. It’s a ruddy amber in color with great foam. The aroma of redwood tips is there, present and upfront. With that I find notes of cherries and sweet vermouth, like a well-made Manhattan. It’s lightly carbonated, giving it a fuller, rounder body. It’s not hoppy but mellow, with that sweet wine finish. Needless to say, I loved every sip.","elNopalero","Nov 03, 2012"

3.76,-6.7,4,3,4,4,4,"O - It tasted almost exactly like death and taxes to me with less of that smoky flavor until the spice hit at the end. It is really delicious and I loved the subtleties of the aftertaste. It is an interesting take on a classic beer style. I will definitely order this again.","Jsenay","Mar 15, 2012"

4.07,1,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Interesting beer - I'd probably guess hoppy black lager or porter if having this blind (which is indeed what happened, as Flavor had no idea what the beer was when I asked). I enjoyed it quite a bit and had no problem putting down the entire pint.","MasterSki","Nov 14, 2011"

4.07,1,3.5,4,4.5,3,4,"O: I tried and was not a fan Legal Tender, which was also a Gruit. I almost didn't order it for that reason, but I am really happy I did. This was a very tasty beer. One I will order again.","avaldivia","Aug 03, 2011"
4.17,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I almost didn't order this becaus I'd had it before. I'm glad I got it, because it's way better than I remember it being. Great roasty tones with good spicing and the Redwood adds a nice flavor. Wonderful.","litheum94","Jul 26, 2011"
3.98,-1.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer wasn't really what I expected at all, but I liked it. Fairly understated in flavor, I found that I downed this beer very quickly.","Hojaminbag","Jul 25, 2011"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Moonlight Brewing works hard for their money and I'm glad the beer reviewing world treats them right. Although this offering, with less than 20 reviews under its belt is still in its infancy, it already rates a ""B+"" and I've no doubt it'll soon have an ""A" next to it, just like the fantastic Reality Czech and Death & Taxes brews. I'd consider it as good as those.","biegaman","Apr 30, 2011"
4.32,7.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"D - Very drinkable. Lots of flavors that do not seem like they would work together mix here for a really tasty and balanced beer.","ngeunit1","Dec 02, 2010"
3.75,-6.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"Notes: If you sat this beer down in front of me I'd swear by taste it was a black Belgian like Russian River's Rejection. You do notice the lack of hops but in something like a black Belgian you don't really miss them.","4000qtrap","Mar 26, 2010"
4.25,5.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"On tap at Flavor. Dark brown with ruddy tints, almost black. The beige head holds pretty well. It smells of heavily roasted malt, chocolate-like in character. Espresso and evergreen come out as it warms. I might be crazy, but this smells like it's fermented with lager yeast. The palate mirrors the aroma: roasted malt is prominent, lending chocolate and espresso flavors. There's a bit of nougat sweetness, a light herbal character and a touch of carob. The body is fairly light, and it's a pretty clean and crisp beer on the whole. For a non-hopped/gruit style beer, this is great.","largadeer","Dec 20, 2009"
3.5,-13.2,3,3,4.5,3,2.5,"This brew probably isn't drinkable enough to enjoy a pitcher with a friend. Instead, enjoy a small amount and delight in the hoplessness!","drummstikk","Sep 05, 2009"
3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D: I was real excited to try this one, reminded me a lot of Alba Scots Pine Ale which I gave a similar score to. Very solid ale, and I like the experimentation.","Halcyondays","Aug 22, 2009"
2.98,-26.1,4,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours a deep orangey copper color with a creamy khaki cap of head. Aroma is caramel with some slight roastiness and herbs. Flavor starts out nice with a round caramel character tempered by some herbal notes but the finish is quick to turn vegetal. I appreciate the creativity but the aftertaste tastes, unsurprisingly, like leaves. Very nice mouthfeel but I can't call the drinkability very good.","illidurit","Beers"
4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Had this on-tap at Jupiter in Berkeley. Very pleased to see this quite interesting beer as I'm a fan of evergreen spiked beers. I've never had redwood tips in a beer before and it's intriguing how different they are from spruce or juniper- much earthier and much less sappy and in-your-face than the pine is. This beer pours a murky copper with a short, creamy head with some nice lacing. Smells grainy with some spicy notes and a light banana and cherry sweetness. The taste also has a grainy anf fruity sweetness with the spicy/earthy notes of the redwood tips creeping up the backend. There is also some more sweet banana and cherry as well as some citrus and bitter flavors that I would swear were from hops. Ends with some smooth, tangy, lager yeast notes. Smooth, fruity, earthy, and easy to drink. Very interesting and delicious.","Georgiabeer","0"
3.7,-8.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"D- I like to try new stuff but I didn't really like this a while lot. It's not a horrible beer though by my tastes, and I still appreciate what they are doing here even though that doesn't suit my taste, which I reflect in my score (a bit higher than what I overall probably thought of it). I wouldn't have it again though.","MiScusi","May 26, 2008"
3.95,-2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability- Pretty yummy and quite different. I would definitely try this again.","GClarkage","May 21, 2008"
4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouthfeel is great--again, what you'd expect from an English brown ale. Mild carbonation and delicious taste make this one very drinkable brew. I'm impressed by the fact that the redwood isn't really the focal point of this brew; it's evidently simply used in the same capacacity that hops would have been used.","Rzzzzz","May 11, 2008"
4.42,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"D: Very good - I'd have drunk more if i have the option but there were other beers I'd never get to try calling out to me!","DefenCorps","May 05, 2008"
4.1,1.7,5,5,4.5,3,2.5,"You just have to try it, if not because its just as good as any moonlight brew, but perhaps just for the novelty.","DIYMonkey","Beers"
