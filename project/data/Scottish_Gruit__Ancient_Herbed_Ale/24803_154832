2.86,-24.5,4,3.5,2.25,3.25,2.75,"Mostly clear medium golden color with a huge bubbly white head with moderate retention. Lemony herbal nose that reminds me of honey lemon cough drops. Light clove and pepper with a hint of sweet honey like malt underneath. The flavor is quite clove-y with light sweet honey like malt and hints of lemon. Medium body moderate carbonation. This beer is really not my thing.","johnnnniee","Mar 12, 2015"
