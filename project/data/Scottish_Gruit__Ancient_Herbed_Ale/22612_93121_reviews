"A beer from Mt. Pleasant Brewing Company, my hometown. I actually tried the beer up north near Petoskey, The beer itself if full bodied and very sweet. It tastes of peaches and fruit but is a little too sweet for my palate. I enjoyed the beer I had but having just one was enough for me."

"O: I'm not usually into fruity beers, but this beer really hit the spot on this hot day. Super tasty and very refreshing."
