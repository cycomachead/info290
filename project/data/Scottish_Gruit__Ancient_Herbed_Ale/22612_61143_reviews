"This is my first gruit beer so I have nothing to compare. It pours a somewhat cloudy copper brown color. Very little head. There is not much aroma,  a little malty smell with a whiff of herb. The taste gives a little of the same maltiness/herbiness with a discernible rosemary taste in the finish. The overall effect is decent but I find my palate wanting more bitterness. This is an interesting beverage, I would recommend trying."

"O: The negative reviews are not really justified. Its a gruit, it isnt supposed to taste like the beer you know (there is a reason it died out circa 1500). The unique bitterness, and unfiltered sour component alone make it a worthy try. The herbal component is mild but present - a knowledge of the herbs would help in the appreciation of this brew."

"Mt. Pleasant Sacred Gruit is not a conventional ale nor does it taste like one. I bought it expecting as much but also hoped it would be more interesting; it's not its unique ingredients that distinguishes it from other beers, it's its totally forgettable, dismissible drinkability. Whether viewed as a novel experiment or simply a pleasant drink, it fails on both counts."
"people who go by the label and expect a ""pale ale"" will be disappointed. but people who are looking for something on the level of a low end jolly pumpkin sour might enjoy this flavor for the price. I really found it quite enjoyable and find some of the negative reviews to be mind boggling."

"This is by far the one of the most disturbing beers I've ever had, didn't smell very good or taste very good, I purchased it from the brewery in Mt. P so it should have been fresh, might be for some but most def. not for me. Bought two, gave second one to a friend, he didnt care for it either."

"O - This is a tough beer to judge mainly because you can't approach it like most other beer, but that being said there are some rough edges here. I was really interested to try a commercial gruit example. The only thing similar I've had is Williams Brothers Fraoch Heather, and it was decidedly better. The smell was the best part of the beer. I won't be buying it again."

"Definitely not my cup of tea. I would not buy this again and can't recommend it even for the curious."

"O: An interesting and refreshing beer. This is only the second gruit I've had and the first was radically different with juniper and lavender. This one is more like a Berliner weisse--tart and sour yet light and refreshing. Enjoyable overall, though."
""
"Shows no alcohol and some would like just for the refreshing and appealing tones. Light citric finish. I think this is a love it or hate it kind of beer; I love it."

"Overall I was pretty indifferent about this beer, I didn't hate it, but I for sure didn't love it, this is my first of the style so I don't really know how on par this beer is but if I had to guess I would say that it's pretty average. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, but the flavor really didn't hold my attention so one is enough for me, but this beer might hit the spot on a really hot day. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it wasn't bad and it reminded me of Nicie Spicie. What I liked least about this beer was that it seemed to be pretty average all around, no aspect stuck out as being really well done. I won't be buy this again, I could think of a lot of other beers that I would much rather have for the same price. If you are a Gruit fan then this is worth a try to see where it stands but I don't think I would recommend it to my friends as a good beer, even to the ones that don't like hoppy beers. I wasn't too into this beer, there wasn't anything about it that impressed me, but it for sure wasn't horrible tasting, just pretty boring and not exciting at all. This beer falls in the same category as most of Mt. Pleasant's beers, average, I am still waiting to really impressed by this brewery. My first Gruit didn't leave a great first impression, but I will still be looking for more of this style."
"DRINKABILITY: This is my first beer of this style and I qyite liked it. It is easy to dring and repeatable, somewhat memorable (maybe because it was my first; I really don't know) and provides good value for the money. I didn't know what to expect from this ""no hops"" beer and was pleasantly surprised. While a bit on the bland side, I'd definitely order it again."
"Mouthfeel was pretty good. Very light and easy to drink but definately didn't leave you wanting to come back for more."
"The best beer I've had from Mountain Town yet, you really need to try this."
"This was my first experience with Gruit. The girl pouring the beer explained that it was one of their newer experimental beers brewed in similar style to those before beer included hops. It had a light golden color with a thin, quarter-inch head. Easy drinking, this beer reminded me of a nice, light pilsner."
"D- Good I might have it agian. Fun to try"
"Overall, for a no hop 'beer' it was pretty decent. It was kind of bland, but alright. Not something I really want a lot of though."
