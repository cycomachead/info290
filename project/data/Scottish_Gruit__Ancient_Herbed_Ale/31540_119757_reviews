"Long finish. Good floral gruit-ness up front and in the middle of the mouth.  Juniper berries really stick out. Great sourness. Maybe a bit of saltiness on the back end. This is eating the enamel off my teeth."

"I see ""gruit"" and I think something herbal and uncommonly spicy and earthy, but this really came off more as a wild saison or something along those lines. I almost want to detract points from the ""overall"" category in that this was not a typical gruit in any way, but instead I'll just say, this was not your typical gruit. My question is: were hops or herbs used in this, and what variety?"

"De Garde has improved by an unreal amount in the past 6-8 months with their beers having evolved from glorious messy exercises to focused and well-defined beers. Comparing the two is like an exercise in comparing (early, messy) Darkthrone to later day Emperor."
"O-Another wonderful De Garde beer. Very thankful I was able to try it."
