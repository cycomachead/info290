"Poured a clear orange body with minimal head and little lace.  Aroma is spicy and not something one usually finds in a beer - anise and ginger stick out.  Medium bodied beer that is a little sticky and sweet, yet balanced with spices like anise, ginger and rosemary.  Clean beer, easy to drink, nice finish.  Not your typical beer (i.e. ipas, stouts) and was well worth trying."

"bodied.  The best gruit I've ever had! Find this and drink this. You won't be dissapointed"
""

"O: Unique and glad to say ""thank God for hops""."
"Bitter like Unicum Zwack. Similar in taste to a herbal bitter (underberg, etc.) would make a very nice digestif. Not a quaffable beer but a nice drink st the end of German. Soapy, bright, herbaceous taste. Golden straw appearance with an almost non-existent head. Overall, worth a try."
"Overall this is an exceptionally good beer. Very different but very good. I will drink it again, and again, and..."

"Flowing smoothly on the tongue and with a crisp bite that never fades, there's a dryness both from a leafy and woody feel and from a certain acidity that carries through without being harsh. The lemony tang and zest evens out the dryness and lingers well."
"An odd beer for sure, but very interesting. I'm not a huge fan of this, but I like the idea of the beer completely. I could see sipping on this instead of a hot toddy next time I'm sick with a nasty cold. I would hope all the herbs contain some sort of healing powers that I could extol among my friends when they're sick as well. ""Try this! It's strange and hard to drink, but has mysterious healing powers no one can explain!"" Yeah, I like this. Give me a 13th Century Grut anytime. Cheers."

"Overall, I really can't get past the medicinal taste and extreme astringency. I like to think I have a pretty expansive palate and there are very few beers I just cannot drink but this is one. This might just take the cake as the worst beer I have ever tried."

"Pours a hazy, straw color with thick, but short-lived head. Slight greenish hue to this one. My glass was devoid of lacing less than half way through, which made my glass feel naked. The nose is full of spices, citrus, and herbs. I get a face full of bay leaf right off the bat and hints of the rosemary and ginger. Looking for the anise and caraway, but couldn't lock onto any of those licorice-like aromatics. Taste is tart, but very herbaceous. Lemon and lemon rind, full of pith. Bitter botanicals from the steeping of the herbs and spices. The bay and rosemary really come through in the front, with ginger playing a supporting role, the caraway and anise are there if you really go looking for them, but are easily lost in the complex dance of flavors on this stage. The lasting finish is dry with a prolonged bitterness on the palate that reminds me of over-steeping lemon peels in hot tea. The bay sticks around for a long while. I don't pick up any of the wheat, nor much of the rosemary, but this is one worth returning to more than once, to ponder the depths of this polyglot brew. Mouth-feel is light and the carbonation is not very high in comparison to the initial head, but present enough to play its part."

"Overall it's a very interesting interesting quaff, and this ""Historic Signature Series"" is well worth seeking out. From the 500 ml bottle purchased at Mayfair Liquors in Denver. My first Gruit to rate, at least, though I've had the Scottish heather and seaweed ones."
""
"This is a superbly refreshing beer, similar to a Radler. I imagine this would be a great summer beer to relax with in the shade with friends. I was pleasantly surprised."
""
"Prost!"
""
"Kind of makes me glad to be a beer drinker today, not then."
""
"O: interesting beverage from the 13th century. A little bread note with hints of spice. bitterness lingers on the back of the palate."
""
""
"Overall, a style I'm glad to have gotten the opportunity to sample. It would be interesting to see other brewers' takes on the style, similar to how berliner weisse (another Professor Fritz Briem portfolio beer) has become increasingly popular in the last several years, it seems. This reminded me a little bit of the limited experience I've had with the Sahti style. Personally, I'll stick with hops for my bittering and flavor when given a choice."

"Overall this is probably the first or second Gruit beer I've ever had, and I enjoyed it. Not an everyday kind of beer but one that certainly deepens my appreciation for beer's long history and wide variety. It's also a well-made beer in its own right."
"O: I wasn't sure what to expect but I gotta say its superb. The spices really work as weird as they seem. A great easy drinking summer beer. I will definitely grab more of this. Cheers!"
""
""

"O: in my mind, this is the best of the more readily available gruit ales on the market....something that truly stands out, and it's so drinkable!...and only a German or (better) British yeast seems appropriate for this style (Belgian ""gruit"" is a waste/joke)...the yeast must have some hand in the flavor here, but it still allows the flavorings to come through....definitely try this if you haven't!"

"Bought from Tacoma Boys. Pours a hazy pale gold with a lot of sediments floating around. Smells fantastic. Tons of spices, cinnamon, rosemary, fruit and zest. Taste is slightly tart, with some ginger and rosemary notes. Pretty good dose of carbonation compared to the appearance. Very light body with an abrupt finish and absolutely no bitterness. Not bad and I love this style of beer. Always interesting and the history is intriguing as well."
"I am excited by the concept of gruits and the wild flexibility and variability they offer - the ability to flavor beer with just about anything and to get away from hops as the main character note. But this one went to a bad place. I'm a little discouraged because the Bros said in their review that this was one of the very best gruits they'd ever tried."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a clear honey amber with a hint of a head that dissipated immediately to a ring around the glass, no lacing. Amazing aroma of rosemary, bay leaves, ginger, apple juice, light citrus; other unidentifiable aromatic herbs. Much like a kitchen dried potpourri. Starts with apple and pear juice, light grape juice; slightly vinous, aromatic herbs dominated by rosemary, slightly sweet. Finishes abruptly with dry, earthy herbs, leaving a light, but pleasant dried herb aftertaste. Light bodied. A very enjoyable reconstruction of this ancient ale style. Although I have greatly enjoyed some of the other, sweeter, gruit reconstructions from Scottish and American breweries, this one struck me as more authentic. A part of me wished for a bit more ABV to bring out the intensity of the bittering herbs. I like this Professor Briem series and am glad that he is bringing these old styles back to life."

"O: Despite a couple of rough edges (the soapy astringency in the finish detracted from the experience slightly), this was a tasty foray Into the sort of beverage our ancestors enjoyed. Not a drink for everyday consumption, but a nice ""just because"" experience."

"Overall a very unique and interesting beer. I'd like to try some other examples of the style, but would probably not seek out this one again. I'm glad to have tried it, but once is enough for me."
"Pours a dulled golden straw, lots of haze and particulate, moderate cap of big bubbles, short lasting. Scent brings a deep bouquet of of presh picked herbs, quite a bit of ginger and sage on the nose, light sugary and fruity sweetness and faintly bready malt. Again, fresh picked herbs everywhere on the tongue, luckily all work well in conjunction with none being overly palate smashing. Little notes of sweet, juicy berries play well with the herbal notes. Lighter side of medium, moderately carbonated. Suprised by how well the taste came together, enjoyable."
""
""

"Still, the oddball herbalism that is contained within WORKS. I can tell that every component has been carefully counter-balanced against each other for the net gain of something better than the sum of it's parts. Well worth experiencing if you can get your hands on it."
"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy golden straw color with a small 1 finger foamy white head with decent retention, that reduces to nearly nothing. Minimal lacing clinging to the glass. Aromas of lemon, apple, wheat, pepper, clove, herbal, floral, earth, anise, and steak sauce; seriously, steak sauce. Some very interesting aromas with good strength and decent balance. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, rosemary, basil, ginger, pepper, clove, anise, and herbal spiciness. Very slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, spices, herbs, wheat, and pepper on the finish for a very short bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity; quite dry on the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present on the finish at all as expected. Extremely easy to drink. Overall this is a nice Gruit style ale. The aromas were certainly interesting; but the taste was nicely balanced and very smooth. This was quite enjoyable."
"Very interesting beer. Easy to dink. Low alcohol and low carbonation goes down easy. Not my favorite, but worth giving a shot on a hot summer day."
"I still have a few styles too try but this one brings me a little closer to hitting them all"
"O: Huge surprise in how much I like this beer. I would actually drink it on occasion! Not every week but definitely atleast once a month! Nice work Fritz"
""
"O- This is fun. This isn't an every kind of night of beverage, but this is just a fun and different kind of drink."
"O: A very good beer. Interesting to say the least, and full of great flavors. I would definitely drink this again."
""
"I'm glad to be getting this after hoping to see it for a while."
""
"The beer is a pale, dull yellow with a thin white head and huge chunks of yeast. This beer is obviously a living organism and smells incredible. There are strong herbal notes without anything distinct in particular along with a sour tartness that screams zesty lemons. Absolutely divine drinking with a thin watery, but zingy mouthfeel...which is rather unexpected. It's highly drinkable and reminds me of a mild ginger beer that would cool off the hottest of summer days. I would definitely recommend giving this beer a shot if you've never tried a gruit before, it puts DFH's ta hen ket to shame (and yes I know THK isn't technically a gruit...but it's full of funky herbs from the egyptian market nonetheless)."
""

"Pours a murky light orange with a 1/2 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain, herbs, spices, and some interesting sour/tart aromas. Taste is of grain, leafs/herbs, spices, and a sourness on the finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with an interesting history behind it but it's definitely weird in a good way."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a bright hazy looking yellow color with a big fizzy white head with lots of chunky sediment. The head fades but the carbonation spits from the top of the beer similar to how soda does. The smell of the beer is lemony with some herbal qualities to it. It smells refreshing. The taste of the beer is herbal with some citrus hints in the distance. The mouthfeel of the beer is light, very carbonated and a little on the watery side. Overall I enjoyed trying the beer, I can't say I'd buy it again but it was nice to have once."
""
""
"O: Very interesting style and a pretty good example of it. I have had a couple of others and this is probably my favorite of them - though not a style that I have frequently. I really enjoy the savory aspects of the smell and taste. Not a real sessionable beer but definitely good."
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a blonde haze with a fizzy white head. Aroma is unique of some ginger, peppery notes, herbs, and spices. Taste is more sweet than spicy. The ginger comes forth but not as prominently. The herbs are there but lean heavier on the rosemary. The peppery spices seem tamed as well. Sweet malt and wheat come through towards the back end. Body is light and refreshing with the carbonation being creamier than expected. Ends with more ginger and peppery flavors, light rosemary, sweet malt and grains. Definitely an unique beer from old Germany!"
"Pale malt and very watery up front. The spices kick in quickly and dominate the taste from this point onward. Mildly sour. Lots of effervescence. Surprisingly short aftertaste. Nicely warming in the throat and tummy."
"Overall, a lot going on the herbal/spice department but not enough to make me keep drinking. Good example of the style, perhaps just not something I want more of."
""
"This is by far one of my favorite gruits so far and a nice contrast to the often darker siblings."
"Overall: A very interesting concoction; I appreciated it much more than I liked it"
""
""
"Another vintage style from the Professor Fritz Briem series. A gruit is today's specimen. The beer pours a clear yellow straw color with a touch of white foam. The strong aroma is packed full of interesting herbs and spices. Bay leaves, sage, ginger, coriander and allspice berries. Very light and nimble on the palate. The flow is laced with similar components to the aroma. This an unusual and tantalizing brew. I would definitely drink again."
""
"At first I thought this might be like drinking soup base, but I was pleasantly surprised by the aromatic and gustatory aspects of this beer. I repeatedly thought how easily drinkable this was, and what an excellent apertif or dinner beer this would make. So it's not an over-the-top RIS or IPA; this is still delicious and a pleasure."

"While this isn't something I see myself purchasing on any sort of regular basis, it was a fantastically interesting beer and unlike anything I've had before. First few sips were floral and called to mind rosewater and coriander. As the beer warmed, a distinct spearmint flavor emerged. Mouthfeel was a bit thin with some wheat-like notes. Some ginger and other aromatics lurk. Final pour decanted a fair bit of unattractive brown sediment."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy and has a nice interesting flavor. I really like the lemon citrus flavor at the beginning. The spices are stronger than anything I've had before. This is not a bad thing, just something I think I have to get used to. Overall, I thought this was a really cool interesting beer. I think this is a style that a lot of breweries could really use to showcase their creativity, I'd like to see more of the style. I also, really like experiencing a beer that makes you feel like you are tasting part of history. I recommend picking this up. Even if you don't really enjoy it, although I did, it is still worth the experience."
"O: It's probably the best gruit that I've tried, but I still can't justify giving it a higher score. There's just too much ginger. The tartness is nice but I'll take a berliner weiss over this."
"Try it!"
"In the end, it's all lemon, and I'm finishing it, but I'm not really liking it"
"Quite refined, nice for toasting or as an apertif. Again, this begs to be paired. I was nervous it wouldn't justify the price. I'm still not sure it does, but I'm nonetheless impressed."
"I'm not sure I'd seek this out to drink on a regular basis. It doesn't really resemble beer as we expect it. But it's not bad. Paired with the right foods it might be a great meal-accompanying beverage."
"Pours a very light yellow almost pale. Amost no head .smells very interesting. Lots of caraway, anise and lot more on the nose. Very spicy. Taste light and bubbly lot of intestine spices. Carroway heavy with some other interesting flavours. Overall very tasty. Smething i would definitely have again"
"O (D) - This is pretty interesting. Not great, but a pretty good gruit, I think."
"The CPJ"
"O: The medicinal quality of the beer just threw me for a loop. I understand that spices are a part of what makes a gruit a gruit, but this beer was so hard to drink. Hopefully it was only this beer and not the style that I just don't like. Will try to get another gruit in the future."
"This is an odd beer but worth a try. The alcohol is low and the beer is light in body. For me, it is an acquired taste, mainly because of the anise. I would have to work at acquiring a liking to it, but I would prefer it to many ginger ales. I think it is a beer that could pair well with some foods. While it is a decent interpretation of an historical style, to me, it is more of a novelty beer than one I would seek out with any regularity."
"Overall it's quite nice, and drinks very nicely. It's almost like a dry cider in some ways."
"CHEERS!!"
"Price = $5.99 at Whole Foods (NYC)"
"O - Haven't had too many gruits, so my experience is limited, but I like this one. Very interesting array of aromas, flavors and feel. Nothing too overpowering and extremely complex too. My initial impression proves right for me with this being a warm weather beer...good discovery just in time for summer."
"O: Overall I think this is a really cool beer. I like that I got a chance to drink an old recipe. However, it seems a little too much like a basic ginger beer, and I'm not completely sold on the inclusion of the other ingredients listed because I didn't pick them up. Maybe a different palate would. I enjoyed the beer so I'm going to rate it good overall."
"Pours a very slightly cloudy orange with a rose colored tinge. Left about an ounce of sediment filled beer in the bottle. Nose is a complex mix of rose hips, salty smoked carraway and coriander, dill, a pleasant medicinal band aid note. Very juicy in the mouth with bright lemon notes, a mix of savory spices and finishes with a golden delicious apple flavor. Very drinkable at the abv (not the price) and is a very intriguing beer for a style i admittedly have never tried before. Very impressive."
"d: definitely worth a try, unlike anything that i have ever had; apparently things weren't that terrible in the dark ages"
"Poured into a mini-pint/tasting glass. Lemon/honey pale yellow. Smells of honey and fresh, clean spices. Think of like a honey-herb tea aroma. Lemonade sour with a bite of the spices. Spicey ginger flavors take the brunt of the load. The rosemary provides a nice back bone. Something grassy, too. Not sure if it's a sour or bitter flavor, akin to a saison. I was pleased to find they used anis instead of juniper berries, although it's not a dominant flavor. This a great, light drink. Perfect for the summer. Can't wait to have more."
"D-If you're going to drink a gruit (or grut) drink this one."
"An odd beer for sure, but not really strong enough to be offensive. Can I drink it? Yes. Would I reach for one from my friend's ice bath at a party? No. What would it even be doing at my friend's party?"
"Overall, it's quite a delicious beer, if one that is so far outside the realms of expectation. I'm so pleased to have been able to try this. I only wish I could have tried a Gruit from the past when all the ingredients were not only preservative, but also psychotropic."
"500 mL German bottle with no freshness date. Brewed at Weihenstephan from a base of barley and wheat, and spiced with bay leaves, ginger, caraway, anise, rosemary, gentian and ""pollinated wild hops."" Brilliant pale gold color, with an inch of noisy head that leaves no lacing. The bouquet starts with ginger and caraway and finishes with, well, ginger and caraway. On the palate there is mostly ginger and rosemary, contributing spice and pine respectively. A dash of malt is in there as well, along with some lemon and a slightly lower pH that helps keep the flavors bright. Its very light, very dry and highly carbonated body gives the impression of tonic water. I doubt that this beer is in any way historically accurate, as I have trouble believing that any beer brewed in the 1200's (including small beer) was this light in color, this dry, this lightly spiced and this cleanly fermented. However, it is possible that the gruit blend is accurate and I applaud Prof. Briem for at least spreading the knowledge of a long-forgotten family of beers. It is no doubt approachable and easy to drink - so much so that it could conceivably be a nice crossover beer for your macro friends - but I feel it lacks a bit in character."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It smelled really good if you like a floral, earthy beer. It was a light drinker that has some nice twists to it. I would drink this beer again."
"For those looking to experience beer of yore, this is a must. There's a lot going on, but it's delicious, highly drinkable and refreshing; it works well, and gives you a glimpse into beer geek palates of the 13th century. And though examples of the style are quite rare (we currently list fewer than 50 on the website), this is quite possibly one of the best Gruits we've had to-date."
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into my Chimay goblet. Short pour, so not much head, but what there was faded instantly and no lacing. Cloudy golden color with persistent bubbles. First smell off the nose is a massive whiff of mint. A hint of perhaps Belgian-ish yeast. Some lemon rind. On the mouth, weird. Very thinly flavored. Tart as hell, but not full on like a sour. Herbacious to the max. Citrus and something pleasantly medicinal. Pretty thin bubbly mouthfeel. I dunno. This is my first Gruit. I don't know what to say."
"O- Overall i would say this beer meets what the brewer was trying to accomplish. From what i have read about the style this one fits perfectly. While it would not be my first choice i would give it a second shot."
"D - Interesting, this is a very light, but heavily spiced beer. The wheat flavor is fairly dominant and there is some lactic tartness that helps to accentuate this characteristic. The spices are well balanced with ginger notes that are significant enough to lend the beer a little bit of hotness in the finish. This isn't quite as good as the Berliner Weisse, but it is something that must be tried, if only once. I am looking forward to whatever the Professor brews next in this series."
"ick..."
"A very odd beer. Tastes like a spice garden with a little lemon on top. The tastes are faint, yet the beer is not watery. The flavors are due to the grut style of brewing. There are no hops used."
"Pours a hazy, yellow color. 3/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of anise, strong spice, slight yeast, and slight wheat. Fits the style of a Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of spruce/ginger, anise/nutmeg, slight yeast, hint of tart malt, and lemon citrus. Overall, an unusual beer. I'm not sure how to rate this as far as it fits within the style. It had a good blend, body, and complexity."
"By the way, do not swirl the remains of this bottle and pour it in like it was a hefe or wit. You may get little chunks that look like dead sea-monkeys. You're welcome."
"Drinkability: I could drink glass after glass of this all night."
"To be tried at least once, cant say ill buy this again but didnt regret it."
"Pretty thin in body with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Luckily, the aftertaste leaves behind some of the ginger and not so much of the medicinal feeling. If you like the taste, you could probably drink this all day, but I imagine that it would be an acquired taste...not one that I plan on acquiring though. I'm also ashamed to admit that I passed on drinking the lees for a change."
"D - While I can appreciate the style, I think another poster said it best. ""This is a beer that would best be shared with a group of friends""."
"Notes - Try it to see what its like. Its worth having something new that you probably havent experienced yet. Definately a unique brew."
"F: Semi bitter, lots of light lingering spices, which seem to die rapidly after the nose. More orange peel here as well, a little anise, more bay leaf, and the lot. Pretty dry as well, with again a touch of creamy malt and some fruit lingering."
"D: Quite refreshing though the herbal funk does make this a bit difficult to drink too much of this; a nice venture into an old (and new for me) style"
"A little lower mark for drinkability, however. Although this was interesting, and not bad per se, by the time I got to the bottom of the glass, I was ready to move on. One was enough."
"On a more... useful note, when I serve this to beer geeks, which is often, I tell them to think of it as an herbal soda. It only remotely resembles beer, but is supremely memorable, mind-expanding and, dare I say, delicious. Surely the best Gruit I have had to date. Fritz Briem, I bow in your general direction. Keep taking orders from the faeries and I'll keep drinking."
"This might be worth trying to get a good idea of what beer was like 400 years ago. But its not at all drinkable. More gimmick than anything else."
"An intriguing and enjoyable beer; I will definitely take a chance on other interpretations of the style when I encounter them."
"I'm much more impressed with good ol' Professor Fritz Briem's Grut Bier than I anticipated. It's quite unique, has an interesting flavor, and a definite throwback feel to it. It does remind me a Sahti, but that's not a bad thing at all. If you're looking for an interesting experience, try this one on for size. It's a good one. Thanks, Dan!"
"This beer is really something special. It's like I'm drinking some ancient medicinal tonic. Quite refreshing. Sehr Grut, Herr Professor!"
"""Refreshing"" says my wife, and I agree--although the weirdly medicinal vibe has me wondering what illness I have. Kudos to Dr. Briem for keeping a centuries-old tradition alive. Not one I'd try again, though...but hey, nice aroma."
"Overall a very enjoyable and unique beer. If I didn't know it was a gruit I'd have guessed it was a very smooth and well made wit."
"Notes: Overall I find this beer to be interesting, complex and oddly delicious. For me this one pushed the limit of what is and could be."
"All in all, and interesting drink, but not one I will be rushing to revisit."
"Very hazy, amber/yellow sort of color. High carbonation level. Very floral and spicy aroma. Somewhat minty and grassy. Fairly crisp upfront with a lot of herbal and spicy notes. I cant place the main spice-if I think of it I will edit my review. Mild anise flavor. Quite the lively mouthfeel. Low abv makes this somewhat sessionable but the higher levl of spices and floral notes might make more then 1 or 2 difficult for some. Still an interesting beer and glad to have tried it after reading some favorable reviews in the press."
"D: This tasted pretty good by itself and I might have this again the next time I am looking for an interesting change of pace. It might also be interesting to pair with a salad during dinner. Like gueuze, it's definitely an acquired taste, but I am liking it more with each sip. It's also very refreshing and might make for a good drink on a hot summer day."
"My first time trying this ancient style of beer; pretty cool idea to sample something from the past. Pale yellow, slightly hazy color without much head. Medicinal aroma. Taste is pretty strange; savory would be the best description; ginger, along with some other herbs. Pretty ""fizzy"" mouthfeel; a fairly light beer. Not something I'd drink regularly, but nice to expand the palate."
"My first Gruit beer. 1pt., 9fl. oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Bottled opened with a gush. Poured a hazy gold with a three inch, loose, bright white head that gradually disperses into a mere skim of a cap. No lacing on this one. Nose initially presents with a big citrus character, but as this dissipates, a big herbal presence manifests - rosemary, sage, fennel; very interesting and complex. Taste consistent with nose; however, much more subdued in the flavor profile (thankfully). Mouthfeel is light-bodied with an easy carbonation and some acidity at the finish. Interesting and complex, but not something I would seek out again."
"Overall, went down ok. Nothing I'd really chase again, but you won't hate this. A Scottish Gruit from Gemany. Not bad."
"D: A sessionable tasty brew. I don't know how traditional it can be since it is golden, it's nice to try another example of this rare style which is one of my favourites."
"Really different & hard to grade because it was fascinating if not actually a great pleasure to drink. The closest beer I can liken it to is Orval, though Orval is much more enjoyable to me. Glad I had it, can't say I'd have it again. A concept beer."
"Pours a hazy lemon drop with at best a finger of white foamy head that doesn't have the drive to live a long, healthy life. Depression, maybe, I dunno. When my nose imbibes the aura beneath, it is as though a baker's rack has been spilt into a beer: peppermint (yeah, I said peppermint...but it could just as easily be wintergreen...I could never tell the damn difference), anise, nutmeg, honey, ginger, cinnamon, hops, and a melange of florals punch their timecards, beginning their shift at the olfactory. ...Sorry, I couldn't resist that...pun...?... At first, these workers are adrift in a sea of vague bitterness, but, of course, they wait until after work to let their hair down: At last, a wash of various flavors, anise, peppercorn, ginger, honey, nutmeg, and that minty bastard again, all dance toegether in such a harmony as to make a Benatton collection feel insecure enough to venture into a Wal-Mart or something. In Max's buddy Bobby's words, ""It's pretty scrumptious"". Look it up, dammit. As bodies go, this one is pretty lithe and readily shows its ability to glide through the mouth, in arabesque, of course, while not suffering from over-effervescence (don't you just HATE the overly bubbly ones? I mean, come on, you've gotta get angry at SOMEthing, am I right, guys?). Overall, I'd definitely partake in this experience again, if only I knew how to upholster scents..."
"D= Upon first wiff I was worried about this beer. Then I tasted it and there is nothing wrong with it. I sort of like it. The vomit smell never came through in the taste. Nice beer."
"This is another beer I'm very glad to have tried. I like trying unique things, and I won't hesitate to try other gruits in the future. I may try this one again -- after a long day in the sun? with a spicy cold fruit soup? some other unusual circumstance? But I'm not ready to go grab another just yet. Not when there are so many others to try!"
"D - Awesome. This Dr. Fritz Briem, who makes these historic brews at Weihenstephan, kicks ass. 1809 is a real winner, and this is too. Such an intriguing flavor; exotic, yet familiar."
"Served in pint glass. The color of golden straw...like Rapunzel's hair. Spicy-herbal aroma. Initially picked up a lot of ginger on the palate. As the beer warmed, other flavors came out to play like an herb garden dancing on the tongue: rosemary, bay, anise...and more ginger. Hints of citrus. Spritzy carbonation. Quite refreshing and flavorful."
"Pours very pale yellow with some white yeast cloudiness and much effervescence. Fizzy large white head subsides fairly quickly, no lacing. The nose is veritable spice cabinet here. Ginger, cardamom, clove, and a flowery honeysuckle sweetness. I don't find the nose particularly appetizing, however traditional it may be; I have had hopless beers that smell amazing in contrast. The taste is gingery with cardamom and cloves. Malt sweetness is balanced, but the spices makes it fairly crisp with a pleasant ginger finish. Light to medium in body with a high level of fizzy carbonation which seems to complement the spicing. Interesting to try a pint of this gruit, thank you but I have little interest in revisiting this one."
"I had NO idea what this beer would be like, and am really happy. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat. Maybe it's nothing more than a nice change of pace from all the DIPAs I've been drinking.. but I think not. This is a really tasty and really unique beer that everyone should try at least once."
"Wow. Nice beer. Friends and I agree this would be a nice summer beer. The combination of aromas and flavors almost seem a little lemony. And pickles. Very refreshing. Poured with small white head that lasts and no lace. Color is a hazy light yellow. Flavor is similar to nose but lots more going on and really quite good. A lot of this kind of beer I'm not so partial to but this works. Body is very good and great carbonation. Long finish of the same flavs. Don't really think it'd be a session beer though."
"Drinkability- I wasn't sure if I'd want to finish this or not, but the complexity and the act of thinking about (writing this review) kept me interested enough to do so. This isn't for everybody, but I suspect if you are a big tea drinker, this may be just what you are looking for (especially if allowed to warm up)."
"I've looked at this on the shelf of the local store for ages and finally bought it. The herbs are awesome, especially in the nose, though it gets a tad tiring in the taste. Either way, a solid and very unique beer."
"Another thing about this beer enhancing its drinkability is the relatively low alcohol ABV. This makes this beer very drinkable."
"D: surprisingly drinkable, light but would be a great summer beer, reminded me a bit of a very good shanty"
"Holy cow I'm in love with this beer."
"D: fun beer I can see myself revisiting. Tonight's food pairing (schnitzel) was perfect. It could go totally wrong with a different dish, though; and despite liking the taste I don't think I'd want more than one...time to seek out another flavor once you've ""gotten over"" the sensations."
"This is a fizzy yellow beer, and that's not a bad thing, I think. Poured from a bottle into a glass, there is absolutely no head, hte carbonation is a bunch of large bubbles and its steady. It is light yellow, the lightest i've ever seen a beer, and completely clear. The smell is of spice only, almost like Chai Tea. Interesting. Taste is sour and dry. Almost like lemon soda. Cloves, anise, rosemary, its hard to drink. Not feeling this beer. Too spicy, its overwhelming. Sorry Grut Bier, not a repeat."
"Edit.... this is taking me forever to gather my thoughts/palate on this one.. licorice is building as the glass warms.. I don't like anise in beer.. and this is making it harder for me.."
"Overall a fantastic brew that might overwhelm given the mix of spices and herbs. Surely reminiscent of a potpourri pot or a kitchen spice cabinet."
"Didnt like the body or feel of this one. WAY overcarbonated; mouthfeel of canned ginger ale. Really thin and watery and very carbonated. I could see this as a lunch time beer with food, possibly with a turkey sandwich or chicken salad wrap. I found the flavors okay for Christmas time, but any other time of the year, the flavors would get old fast. A beer to be consumed with Christmas dinner, but not really any other time."
"D: An airy, tasty, drinkable beer. Great for summer."
"After trying a few of the best gruits in the world, I can unquestionably say that this one is tops on my personal list. Seek this out and be prepared to taste something like you have never tasted before."
"D: This is certainly a different beer that I had to drink with an open mind. The pleasant herbalism combined with the low ABV make this beer go down easily. I'm really glad I picked this one up."
"D - refreshing but don't think i could put up with the different spices beyond a bottle, glad I tried this style of beer that is not represented very much on the market"
"I really am trying to be productive here. The spices working together in place of ""normal"" ingredients is a nice try, but I really think they ought to try again. I have been hesitant to review things I don't like on here in the past, but a B+ rating on BA for this beer is calling into question the integrity of the site in my opinion so I have ""sounded off."" People who use this site to find good beer as I do on occasion would be upset to go by this review in my opinion. Some stores even print ""BA shelf talkers"" and I want to have my opinion averaged in here. . . especially since I have three other beer lovers who thought I was being nice."
"Pours a hazy yellow with a decent white head. Rich aroma is malty and just a little bit fruity, rather appetizing. Flavor is mainly malty, slightly yeasty, with an undertone of fruit and a little bit of an alcohol bite. Smooth, fizzy, edgy texture helps it glide down the pipes."
"D: Different, but delightfully so. I probably wouldn't down several of these back to back. However, it's something I will definitely visit again."
"I don't know what this is supposed to look at. It's like yellow, very hazy, with loose bubbles and a thin head. Looks a bit like a Mt. Dew or something. I can't say I'm impressed, but I can't say I'm disappointed. I'm exited to dig in to something I've never seen before. The smell is what gets me. Just incredibly powerful on the floral notes, not hops, but just flowers, herbs. Maybe like rosemary, cardaomom, saffron cinnamon, coriander, I can't put my finger on it exactly, like I walked into some kind of herb shop or flower shop. Really out there, and not beery, but very pleasant. I do get a hint of sweetness, but mostly spiciness. The taste continues with the spiciness, but there's more beeriness to this one. I can taste a nice light, powdery maltiness, with some pils malt flavor, maybe some melanoids. Then the herbal, floral, spicy flavors hit full force - all the things I mentioned before, like fruity indian cooking almost - or like a really powerful and dry root beer. I can't say that it's my favorite drink on earth, like a strange tea that you enjoy drinking every once in a while. The body is thin, I didn't expect much different, but its not watery, there's enough to keep it together. Nice carbonation level to bring the herbs to the front. Overall, it goes down well, clean, a pleasant drink. I'm not sure this is a beer you'd want more than one of, but I'd recommend it for an interesting drink. I can't compare it to others in the style, but I would say this is an excellent example."
"Overall a very interesting beer, and certainly fits the style profile, at least as far as my extremely limited experience with gruit goes. An enjoyable and educational brew, but not one i will be drinking very often. Cool beer."
"Mouthfeel was nicely zesty. Medium to light body."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, although this isn't a style that I would normally drink, this is one of the best that I've had in it."
"D: Very enjoyable, light, refreshing, and rejuvenating. One 17oz bottle was perfect for me."
"Pours a very pale yellow color, slighly hazy, with a wispy pure white head that quickly settles into a light ring. The aroma is spicy and herby. Some banana and pepper, with Vick's vaporub. A bit bizarre but pleasant. The taste is like a Hefe spritzer, with lemon juice, more vaporub action, and other various herbs. A light and very spritzy feel, finishes sweet and tart. Most definitely a different brew, but it was enjoyable. Very light and refreshing. Flavors are a bit bizarre but they work together."
"D- This beer has strong medicinal herb and soapy flavors that make it a hot mess. The herbs and spices all taste like they are competing against each other and just make for a strange cough drop in a glass experience."
"Every BA owes it to him/herself to try this crazy shit."
"A very pale yellow with a slight haze. Has a good foamy white head that evaporates quickly. I agree with the bay leaf analogy from an earlier review (the first whiff from the bottle made me think of bay rumm after shave). The spice character is the first thing to hit you in the aroma. With the spicy hop notes and light malt character coming in behind. Bay leaf, rosemary and ginger are easy to pick up. The flavor is very light on the palate. With the ginger getting first not and the rosemary/bay leaf showing up on the back of the tongue. Served chilled this still had a marvelous aroma and quenching mouthfeel. I'll look for it again this summer."
"Pours light yellow with a whitish internal haze. Smells like bay leaf shaving cologne. Mouthfeel is both creamy and a tad sour with fizzy carbonation. Very interesting tastes, its a sipper until I am used to it, and then it goes easier. This brewery puts together some high quality products."
"Quite interesting, though, and worth a try to see how perfect hops are for beer."
"Picked up a bottle at Four Firkins. Pours a hazy bright yellow with a white head. I'm not sure what the boundaries of the style exactly are, but certainly is a spiced beer. It's a bit like a spiced wit of hefe in that there's a lot of lemon, ginger and pepper flavors. The body is drinkable and the mellow bready malts are fairly smooth. Certainly worth a try for something different in the style."
"A fun beer to drink as things always seem to be changing taste wise and at 4.6% the flavor profile is intense,lots of complexity and punch you in the face flavors to boot. Just wish it was prettier to look at, but I suppose there was more to worry about in the middle ages."
"Pours pale yellow with a white head that has some retention. Aroma is unique, unlike any brew I've had close to Berliner Weisse but way different. Ginger, lemon and rosemary dominate but it's a bbig salad of spice. Tastes like a ginger beer with some mint mouthwash and an almost medicinal aftertaste like alka seltzer. Finish is somewhat dry and refreshing. Not too bad, very drinkable."
"An ""interesting"" historical brew. Too overboard on the spices for me. A beer to share with a beer friend as a ""conversation piece"". I've had gruits that were more enjoyable, but this one goes in a different, interesting direction."
"Overall: Very interesting beer; fruity, carbonated, they threw everything they could think of in there but the hops (as synonymous with this style)."
"Overall this was an intresting beer if you can call it that. Not at all what I was expecting, though very nicely done. I could see this fitting in quite well and was a nice change of pace."
"Leafy, herbal taste, core root beer spices without the sweetness, mild popcorn kernel, all on a soft bed of wheat. So fresh smelling, like fresh cut herbs. Really something unique, it's hard to describe. Dry aftertaste that has a natural sweetness to it. Lots of character, and i'm at a loss for words this time. It's really effervescent and that carries it along well. Easy to finish the 16 oz."
"Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a medium sized fluffy white head with lots of suspended floaties throughout. Tons of spice and floral yeast esters make up the huge nose, notes of cinnamon spice, pumpkin pie, ginger, nutmeg, all spice, banana bread, white grapes and lemon zest. Crisp in body initially but rounded out by a semi-sweet and coating toasty wheat backbone. Lots of floral and grassy aromas and flavors going on also, herbal and slightly medicinal. Different, no doubt, but overall very pleasant, light and refreshing. Im a fan of gruit's but i must say beers that fall into this style may not be for everyone."
"The aroma is nice and floral with herbs, spices, bread, yeast, ginger, fruit, and barley malt. The appearance is cloudy and gold with a large white head. The flavor is slightly watery but balanced and complex with a hefe like bubble gum, clove, and banana taste. The palate is thin but OK. Overall a very very good beer."
"stews."
"Really a pleasant beer with great restraint in the uses of the spices. Could easily drink this on a regular basis."
"Drinkability: It's different, it's interesting, and it's even refreshing. A fine way to revisit the oft overlooked 13th century. Now I look forward to a beer representing the Protestant Reformation of the 15th and 16th centuries."
"D- An interesting beer from an interesting style. Another solid beer from this great brewery. Recommended."
"Surprisingly pleasant."
"This beer pours a cloudy yellow with a white frothy white head that leaves a nice ring and film across the beer with a bit of lace. The aroma is quite intense with rosemary and ginger. The flavor is not quite as intense as the aroma but displays many of the same characters along with a bit of citrusy notes and various other herbs. The body is light with lively carbonation. Overall, a fairly refreshing beer and the herbs are fairly balanced. Nevertheless, the spices would keep this from being drank on a regular basis."
"From a brown bottle - Pours a cloudy pale orange color. Not the prettiest to look at. Smells of flowers, spices, cloves. Below average carbonation and light on the lacing. First sip is very complex with flowey spices and herbs all making their presence known. Tastes like Patchouli or the inside of a Grateful Dead concert. A very interesting beer!"
"It is one the wives will enjoy as well."
"Turbid, milky lemon juice color with a thin white head. Aromas of citrus and ginger. First taste brought the words ""childhood nature hike"" into my head. Then I thought of a dirty lemon lollipop. Then I tasted the ginger, rosemary, and some caraway on the finish. Kinda light bodied. I have to seriously doubt they had a beer this light in color in the 13th century. Still - it's an interesting drink."
"This is actually quite refreshing. This would be an awesome aperitif, it gets the juices flowing and you ready for a meal. Gruit beers are novel enough that this beer gets props for being unique. I definitely enjoy tasting modern interpretations of history & I do like the mix of flavors that the specific herbs contribute to this beer."
"Very drinkable, especially with lean red meat"
"D: The ale is quite low and the cardamom burps that I'm having are quite enjoyable."
"Pours a foggy yellow with a small white head that falls to nothing. Nose is oddly spiced and floral. Very different. Flavor is twice as strange. Weird mix of herbs and spices with a mild sweet fruity tone to it. Feel has a lower carbonation and the liquid is okay. This is a strange beer. Try it once if you're daring, but don't really go for it if your palate isn't ready for some strange vibrations."
"D - This is one tasty gruit which seems like a chameleon of a style. The spice blend w/ the slight sour flavor is intriguing and the drinkability is very high for me. I could return to this multiple times since it is not a boring or bland beer. The closest thing I have tasted to this is Troeg's Scratch 10, but that is hopped - it just has a serious amount of anise. This gruit is mellower, but just as tasty."
