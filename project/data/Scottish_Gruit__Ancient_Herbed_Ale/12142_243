Aroma is toffee, light toasted malt, candy apple fruity, faint banana, lime zest & booze, no pine. Taste is malty, fruity & boozy comprised of toast, toffee, caramel, banana, apple, berries with a herbal, grass, bitter finish. Aftertaste could be called medicinal. Again nothing that I would call pine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with similar carbonation, silky, oily, juicy becoming slightly dry at the end. Unique & very drinkable.

I let three other people sample this as well, one said it tasted like rubbing alcohol, and I agreed. Another said it tasted like medicine, agree again. Very disappointing since I am half Scottish and really wanted this to be great. I realize it is an old timey recipe and that taste wasn't much of an issue in Viking days, but nowadays, it is, and this didn't have much to recommend it. Still, as is, I could imagine rough-hewn Vikings and Picts around a roaring bonfire on the north coast of Scotland in the ninth century, passing around a measure of this and having a high old time.

The aroma immediately took me to a direction I wasn't expecting from something called pine - this thing smells balls on like a barleywine. No difference at all. Taste immediately goes the barleywine route (sweet malty goodness) until from out of nowhere, a pungent tartness pops up. The finish is just a touch tinny with a slight bitterness lingering. Body overall goes from creamy to thin by the finish.

Aromas of orange, grape, apple, pear, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, honey, earth, bread, and molasses. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of caramel, honey, orange, grape, pear, herbal, floral, pine, earth, bread, and light spiciness. Lingering notes of citrus, grape, honey, caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and flavor complexity; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very enjoyable herbed ale! Nice balance and flavor complexity; and quite smooth to drink. Very tasty.","superspak","Jul 01, 2012"

Nose isn't distinctly pine, some fruity notes and sweet caramel and maybe something herbal in there, but not distinctly so. Taste has more caramel, berries and herbal qualities. Can't say the spruce or pine sticks out again, but there are herbal leanings here again. Bready and a bit of alcohol in the finish.

This came as one of four in the gift pack for 9.99 not a bad deal. Totally different beers than your mainstream offerings. Appears a pale ruby copper hue with a bright off white head maybe a light khaki tone, fine sparse lacing scattered on the sides of my chalice. Surprisingly a malt heavy nose with little to no pine aromatics, very fruity bright cherry ripened with some earthiness and a bit of noticeable alcohol. As it warms it begins to unleash more of the pine character in the nose. Flavor wise it starts out super fruity with hints of cherry coated in sugar in a reduction, and finishes bitter with pine/herbal/mint notes. Really balanced compared to most spruce tip/pine beers I've tasted, finishes with a moderate dryness. Little heat from the alcohol but the flavor is there in an almost medicinal nature with the fruity cherry notes. Carbonation is assertive but not overdone and body is definitely medium with a light reduced sugar near syrup texture. Overall a solid beer that I could offer up to somebody new to the beer scene and it would come off both new and interesting for me, this is more or less a mass produced version of something Yard's brewing as made exteme and craft.","WVbeergeek","Dec 16, 2011"

Very malty and sweet with tons of spruce and a little bit of rosemary as well. The 7.5 ABV is extremely well hidden making this really drinkable, especially for as sweet as it is. The mouthfeel is syrupy and chewy, but in a good way, with a nice tangy herbal finish. It reminds me a lot of a medieval beer I had at Gruut in Ghent, Belgium.

On second thoughts, maybe not, because at 7.5% ABV, I'd make for a terrible watchman, especially after a couple of these. Sweet on the finish with some pine, this beer is medium-full in body with a soft, gentle carbonation.

Specialty beers are normally not my cup of tea but this one is a must try if you haven't already. Instead of hops the Scottish brewed beer back in the day with Spruce and Pine so it is very different than a hop brew. The flavors come together for a heavier sweeter malt with a light fruit finish leaving a wonderful aroma and taste on the palet. It's a perfect start to the night, goes down extremely smooth and is delicious. My mouth is watering for one right now!! I only gave it a 4.5 on drinkability, mouthfeel and appearance and not 5's because modestly i have not had a beer that I would give all 5's to.

The scent was incredibly sweet, malty, and almost reminiscent of a tootsie roll. I got slight notes of pine in the first whiffs that rounded out to a fuller Christmas tree scent as the beer descended in the glass. The initial sip was again very overtly sweet. Pine notes are not very apparent up front, but they linger on the palate as you journey through this one. The body was very syrupy and coating, almost unpleasantly so. Interesting beer, I'm just not certain what the totality of it is supposed to be. There are notes here that don't fully communicate with one another.

Fruity aroma of blueberry and raspberry is a bit of surprise in a beer brewed with pine and spruce. The pine is barely noticeable. Tangy mixed berry and fresh bread flavour before a minty, herbal finish. A little bit sweet, but drier than its scent suggests. Alcohol warms the back of the throat. Somewhat light in body with low carbonation. Light yet syrupy at the same time. Alcohol has a bit of bite to it.

A faint cry of pine is detectable in the distance. The taste maintains a portion of this sweetness, but it is different than the nose's: this is more malt than berry, and the syrup has become more like sap, removing some of the initial sweetness, replacing it with a piny bitterness. The body initially feels high on the medium level, but dissipates about as quickly as the head following the pour, adding somewhat to the drinkability.","TMoney2591","Feb 11, 2010"

Small amount of chill haze but not enough to detract from the overall experience. Pine flavor is up front with a moderately malty middle and a surprisingly watery finish. Very little bitterness but also not as much malt complexity for a Scotch Ale. The pine flavor is well balanced with the malt and provides an overall tasty and drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is watery and drab for the style, not bad but not what I would expect...very little sweetness and tannic acid bite.

The first whiff that I get out of the bottle is like Scottish whisky - alcoholic and malty. The beer itself smells of caramel malt, a mild herbal essence, and some alcohol warming. The taste is very medicinal up front, the kind of medicine that I imagine holistics or naturalists employing. Tree root, dried sap, a pine tree branch across the face when hiking a bit off the path, all stewing in booze, uh, I mean medicinal alcohol, and caramel. Carbonation is fairly low, the body kind of light for how it looks and tastes, but smooth overall, and it finishes off-dry, with a strong pine essence - but this time, it has nothing to do with hops, and is more direct and, well, real. I'm sure I could get used to this over time, should hops no longer be available for the modern beer brewing process, but given my well-ensconced predilections for post 19th century UK beer ingredients, I have to view this as an interesting, but no longer useful artifact, like vinyl records or USB 1.0.

The taste is at first sweet and then you detect a spiciness and just the subtlest hint of pine. I'll admit I was a little scared of this beer, but it isn't so scary just sweet and clean and tasty. The taste also includes detectable malt. Finishes with a taste of greenery, more of an earthy finish. The mouthfeel is good it is well carbonated and perhaps just a bit sticky.

It has good alcohol presence and will benefit from warming a bit, room temperature. It hits you with a tart start but there is a presence of honey and oak among other curious qualities.

Rich grainy malt with pine, earth, and a bit of alcohol can be picked up in the aroma. The initial taste is of malt and pine wood that is just a little sweet with a bittersweet aftertaste. Both IF and aftertaste are like nothing I have tried before. There is a hint of oatmeal or grain in there too. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with pretty dry texture and a soft carbonation and a slightly metallic finish. You can pick up the alcohol, but it is not overwhelming. This is an interesting beer that I was pleased to try. It has a very different flavor from the malt and hop rich beers I am used to drinking. I would probably try it again but it definitely won't become a regular. I would like to taste it with some other beers of the same variety, but I have never seen one for sale. Try it with a rich aged cheddar and crackers or maybe some lamb chops.","walshclimb","Jul 18, 2007"

Sweetness is the first thing I noticed, with a flavor I'm not familiar with (I'm assuming pine) playing a strong role and a slight hint of alcohol on the finish, though otherwise it's very well-hidden. Medium bodied, not syrupy or sticky at all. Fairly drinkable. An interesting ale and definitely worth the try. Not something I'd seek out again, nor would I oppose having it again. A pretty unique solid ale.","MrHurmateeowish","Jul 08, 2007"

Pours darker than expected, almost a ruddy red wine color with tawny highlights, with very little head (just some impact bubbles). Aroma is a touch unpleasant with some funkiness that reminds me of mushrooms or manure... but as the glass warms some more fragrant, inviting aromas come out: pear, warming spices, tobacco, wood resin, caramel malts, candied oranges. Quite nice and comforting. On the palate, citric nips first off, subtle carbonation, tea-like mid-palate, sweetening as it goes along, and a resiny-sweet finish. Mouthfeel is quite still and a bit more watery than I expected. Overall, this beer is a very interesting trip through history. It's missing a lot of hallmarks of today's beers, but it makes up for that with originality. I've often said, after tasting historical ale reproductions, that I'm glad I live in the present time, but Alba could make me reconsider that bias.","geexploitation","Mar 04, 2007"

I noticed that others said they picked up a pine scent; I am not so sure I am finding that same smell. The taste is interesting, not sure I would say it is my cup of tea but has some interesting highlights. A nice maltyness is the underlying flavor with a spicy twang to it that highlights pepper and alcohol mixed. Again this brew was interesting just not what I was looking for I guess.

Much sweeter than I was anticipating. The pine smell was extremely muted. In fact, I really had to look for it. The taste was almost that of a slightly sweet IPA. It wasn't offensive at all. One can definitley taste the barley and I suppose the spruce sprigs are what lends the bitterness too this brew. This also leaves a dry ""earthy"" taste in one's mouth on the finish.

Bubblegum sweetness lingers on the palate long after the pine sap is gone. Malts are bready and toasted; carbonation bites the tongue, but is not too overpowering.

Ourside of that, the pine tips give very nice herbal and bittering qualities. Reminescent of many Christmas spices, the flavors go in a lot of different directions. Makes a good alternative to hops. Though not as pine-ey as I expected, flavors of corriander, nutmeg, allspice, curraco, ripe oranges and lemons all come into play; woven into a Wit-like base. A soft honey flavor rounds out the sweetness. Finishes very clean and airy. Aftertaste is wet and confection sugar like.","BEERchitect","Oct 14, 2005"

No pine flavor at all and is very fresh and earthy. I think this is much more drinkable than most of the English ales I've had. It's sweet and primitive yet smooth on the tongue.

Taste was consistant with the odor, and I must admit I thought this brew would be hideous, yet, it wasn't. The odd indgredients yielded a rather decent brew, yet didn't knock my socks off.

Not much bitterness due to the lack of hops. This is rather nice beer. I'm liking these 'historic ales'. Quite tasty. Nice mouthfeel too. Minimal carbonation and a nice medium to heavy mouthfeel.

The nose is slightly fruity and light molasses. Its mostly sweet, without much in the way of the pine. The flavor is interesting. I can definately pick the pine, but it is more woody than Christmas tree, fake pine as I had expected. The malts are very fruity, apple and apricot, almost candy-like. There is just a tinge of bitter upon swallowing the brew, but it really fades fast. The feel is moderate with a rather small carbonation. This is okay.

Taste is correspondingly interesting, there's a rich oaky character, caramel and maybe some pine smoke? wood make sense, if you'll forgive the pun... really quite nice, with some good bitterness, a sweet caramel backbone, and an elderberry? aftertaste. I love the mouthfeel, low but acceptable carbonation and a nice, coating feeling without being too thick. Great drinkability, yes it's meant to be sipped slowly, but I had to force myself to prolong the tasting, I could go through quite a few of these.

It has a very suble aroma that grows as it warms. (had I read the label more closely I would not have refridgerated it) The fragrance is lite and of a sweet pine. Very smooth tatse that easy to drink. It's a bit sweet but that doesn't linger in an aftertaste. It's called a triple but seems a little lite in comparison. Overall a really nice brew and definetly worth a try.","BCMan","Feb 25, 2004"

Very nice alcohol warmth without harshness.","beernut7","Jan 01, 2004"
4.09,8.2,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a deep and hazy brown. It retains a shadow of an off white head around the circumference of the glass. Aroma is a cacophony of pine, ultra-ripe fruits (plum and pear), molasses, woody resins, and flowers. Hint of alcohol and esters in the background as well. Taste is initially sweet, mid-taste reveals a woody spiciness. Full, soft mouthfeel and slight astringency that intensifies as you work through the beer. Very different and extremely entertaining. Considering how much is going on, it's quite drinkable, as well.","Suds","Dec 28, 2003"

3,-20.6,3,3,3,3,3,"Edit: so I saw this beer reviewed by Michael Jackson in his mini-Greatest Beers book, so I guess I disagree with the master. Anyways, the reason it doesn't have much in the way of hops is because it's made without hops. Just pine stuff.","oggg","Dec 09, 2003"
3.79,0.3,3,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This unique ""ale"" poured with virtually no head, which is not surprising due to the low level of carbonation. Indeed, at times the mouthfeel of this beer resembled wine more than beer! The colour is syrupy brown-red, and I see sediment floating freely in the glass(a WINE glass, as the bottle recommends). I am not certain what the sediment would be. The aroma is very sweet, and difficult to compare to any other beer I have tried. The taste is also sweet, with almost no bitter finish; a wood taste is detectable. A slight sourness is evident in the finish. I consumed it at room temperature as the bottle suggested, and indeed to drink this ale cold would be a major discredit to its unique palate. It would nicely replace a wine at meal time; it also would go superbly with a slightly bitter dessert, to balance its sweetness. It certainly does not feel like a 7.5% beer in the mouth! An enjoyable brew, one which I had to order specially from a local store. It is worth ordering a case, for it is quite a unique beer: a pleasant change from the regular barley, hops, water and yeast variety(though, of course, these ingredients create a wide choice of delicious aqua vitae, as we all know!).","Cwrw","Dec 08, 2003"

The more I sipped this beer the more it grew on me. Having more didn't change the above flavor and aroma profiles but it did change them from strange and off to intriguing and unusual. I look at the beer as another history beer in that it is a look at what beers were like before hops became the main bittering agent.

I was surprised, and I guess a little disappointed, when the spruce made very little impression on me in this brew. If you blindfolded me and gave this to me as Belgian ale, I'd have started off on a better foot. But, once I got over not being felled by a pine tree, I did like this beer quite a bit. Quite malty with pleasant yeasty esters. Some herbal/woody flavors (not pine, however) rounded the beer out.","Brent","May 22, 2003"

The smell is sweet entwined with alcohol and pine tar, though I may be imagining the pine tar. It tastes mainly of malts with an oaky flavor. It finishes with a spicy/herbal pine-like taste which lasts a bit longer than most. The alcohol is hidden very well. While not usually as important to me, the mouthfeel is unlike any other beer I have had. It is extraordinarily smooth and pleasant.

Less pine than I expected, but still very tree-like. A bit of caramel sweetness in the malt department. Quite nice. On the palate, we have another interesting array of characteristics. Pine is more noticeable, spruce is also easy to pinpoint. Slight bitterness from the pine. These take over moreso than in the nose, but the malt character is still big. Sweetness throughout and a bit of graininess. Wood character is big as well. Also a bit nutty. Alcohol is noticeable. The mouthfeel could be better if the head had stayed, but it's still nice. A great, unique ale! It's nice to be able to try something historic like this. I wonder if it's truly similar the ales of the past? If so, the old Scots must have been happy!","hyuga","Jan 14, 2003"

There are certainly hints of piney spice, but these are well balance by a nice malty presence and fruity esters. The alcohol stays well hidden until the beer warms up.

The finish is like wheat grass. Complex green vegetable flavors. Grass. Chorophyl. Green peppers. Not as piney as I had expected. Quite a malt profile to balance out (and to some degree mask) the unusual flavors. This tastes like a beer to which a shot of wheatgrass juice has been added. Not a bad beer but a little too esoteric for my tastes. Probably won't give it another try.","mickstepp","Jan 11, 2003"

Palate is sweet malt with wild floral notes (sort of a combination of Iris with a bit of Lilac) trying in vain to balance the beer.

Interesting beer, but surprised by the complete lack of piney flavors.","Realale","Dec 30, 2002"
3.93,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Hazy copper hue. Well retained one fingered off white head. The aroma is comprised of caramelized sugar w/ light diacetyl butterscotch, along with very mild notes of pine and sweet, dried apricot like fruitiness. Very understated aromawise. Light hop bitterness upfront leads into a smooth, somewhat, rich, caramelized malt presence, perhaps from the boiling down of first runnings from the sparge. Hop flavor is paltry, and an undertone of mellow pine takes its place. Full bodied and dextrinous, with the low carbonation lending a correspondingly smooth mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bready sweet, with a hint of pine laced bitterness briefly lingering. A simple, yet rich and satisifying brew. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. The judicious use of pine and spruce lend good overall balance and drinkability.","marc77","Dec 19, 2002"

Big fruity smells with some apricots, oranges, slight grape and others in there as well. Big sweet maltiness is very nicely accentuated by the fruity qualities of the brew. Big peaches, apricots, oranges, and many more that I cannot even pick out. Some nice surprising light spiciness towards the end of the brew before it finishes slightly sweeter than would be desired. The extra sweet finish makes this otherwise pleasant to drink brew a bit cloying. Overall a very nice brew that I wouldn't mind drinking again.","Murph","Dec 15, 2002"

Burgundy with an orange cast and a tight foamy light-cream colored head that holds quite well and leaves some minor lace. The aroma is fruity, with lots of berries. The body is medium with a gentle, very fine carbonation; giving it a nicely smooth & creamy mouthfeel. The flavor, like the aroma, is also very berry-like with some resiny character appearing in the finish. Very interesting. Quite unusual. The spruce and pine become most apparent in the aftertaste - very gentle, lightly resiny, and enjoyable. Much nicer than I was expecting. On the one hand, it's unique and very interesting on several levels, but on the other it's also quite one sided. And it does have a tendency to build on the palate. Certainly worth trying, and enjoyable, but not an everyday beer. Not even an every month beer.","NeroFiddled","Sep 16, 2002"

The beer was lively and moderately corbonated, pretty copper color and a thin white head that receeded quickly.  Aroma was all raspberries and spruce with alcohol evident.  I drank it at @ 60+ deg. and the flavors came thru - malt and earth mixed with alcohol, not overly sweet with interesting light tart flavors, from the conifer sprigs I guess.  The finish is slightly bitter that must come from the pine - a faint tar flavor lingers, similar to hop but different.  This is  what beer started as centuries ago.

A slightly hazy copper hue with a nice tan head that reduced to a pleasing rim around the beer as I drank it. The smell surprised me -- more like a Belgian strong ale than anything Scottish, with a bit of a cherry aroma and pepper, somewhat medicinal. I expected more of a pine scent, but it really wasn't very prevalent. Taste is also reminiscent of a Belgian strong ale, though the pine comes through a bit more in the finish. Flavors of ripe cherry and pepper as well, with a warm, alcohol, and slightly bitter finish. Not what I expected, but quite nice nonetheless.","mophie","May 31, 2002"
