"The beer color is black. The head is a light brown/beige. Dense but it disappear quickly. Elderberry... last time I tasted a beer with  that it wasn't good. However, this one is pretty decent. I think the roasted malts helps here. Some chocolate notes and dark fruits (elderberry). In the mouth, its complex. The finish is bitter that start light but finish strong... Chocolate notes and roasted malts. Delicious. A nice good beer."

"O: Does what it says: Elderberry and it delivers. I would think of it like a porter or stout in its scents and flavours. Worth a try, and would go well with elderberry pie."

"Overall- Drinks very light and has some interesting flavors going on. A worthwhile foray into the gruit field."

"O: This is a real interesting beer and one that I would definitely have again - interesting combination of aromas and flavors with well hidden alcohol."

"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight alcohol, hint of grass, hint of citrus, and hint of dry hops. Fits the style of a Scottish Gruit / Ancient Herbed Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a low carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of sweet malt, citrus, slight alcohol, hint of dry hop, hint of grass, and a syrupy sweetness. Overall, interesting beer that was pungent at first, mellowed by the finish."
""
""
"A fruit-forward, dry, and herbally black ale. A bit cloyingly dry at the finish. A bit off balanced, but this was certainly an enjoyable elderberry beer, showing off a good enjoyable ancient ale. 4"

"O: Pretty good dark ale."
""
"O: This bottles drink by date was 2 years past when I cracked it open so this probably isn't the best review. I think the dull / stale flavors I was getting was a dirrect result. Had it been fresh I think this would have been alot better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes just as roasty and fruity, with tones of chocolate, raisins, dried berry, and an unusual herbal tone. A curious melding of a roasty stout and a fruit ale, this one is well worthy of a try."
""
"Sure. I'll use it as the comparison. Seems like it is what it's intended to be. Doesn't knock my fastball out of the park, but I'm happy Ebulum reached base."

"O: Rich and unusual flavor. Carries the aura of an ancient ale."
""
"Overall. Probably the best from this Wiliams Bros. gruit mixed-4. Like I said, I'm happy Gruit Day is over. Not exactly my style of beer."
""
"Overall- Not bad. Worth the single price I paid for it. Actually would be nice in the summer."

"O - A unique and tasty brew that had a decent flavour profile and was easy drinking. Probably my favourite of the series, and glad I saved it for last."

"Final Grade: 3.98, an excellent B+. Ebulum Elderberry Black Ale is one fruit beer I wouldn't mind having another glass of. I often find fruit beers to be one-dimensional at best, and barely beer-like at worst - but this particular offering has proven to me that when combined with some spice and a decent dark ale base, they have the potential to become much more interesting concoctions. I am now halfway through this brewery's 4-pack sampler, and Ebulum is the second brew to earn an enthusiastic thumbs up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The flavor is good, but it is more reminiscent of a dry stout than a fruit beer. You never know what to expect with a specialty, historic style, but with fruit mentioned so prominently on the label, I wanted to taste it more."

"Review from 5/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours black with a thin tan head and light lacing. Toasty and dark malt aroma. Odd flavor transition. Stout-like dark malts and dark fruits up front then a dry vinous middle and then light stout with a strong elderberry flavor and moderate chocolate in the finish. Well balanced. Flavors are a bit thin, but still very interesting. Worth a revisit"
""
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by June 2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice fairly dense 1-2 finger khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of elderberry, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, chocolate, herbal, molasses, earth, and light spiciness. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and complexity; but are a bit weak. Taste of chocolate, elderberry, roasted malt, toast, molasses, bread, herbal, floral, earth, light coffee, and light spiciness. No bitterness noticed on the finish; with lingering notes of fruitiness, chocolate, toast, roasted malt, herbal, and light spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance and complexity; with a good amount of robustness and minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good ancient ale style. Good amount of fairly robust and balanced flavors; very smooth to drink. Very pleasant and enjoyable stuff."
"M - Light body with somewhat heavy carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied. Overall an interesting historic beer. Tasty and intriguing but nothing too exceptional."

"Overall: I'd take this beer over many standard dark/black craft ales any day, but it has some flaws. There is a lot going on the the flavour that I love (I'm a myrtle junkie), but the appearance and the mouthfeel are just underwhelming. I'd drink this everyday if it wasn't something that was so hard to find. As hard-to-find beers go, however, unless you need a hit of myrtle or want to try something a little different, this might not hit the spot."
"Overall: a little bland. This is the first I have had of the genre so I had no expectation. Its drinkable but the aftertaste may offend some."
"O: I think this is my first beer of this style and I would be interested to try more. This particular example is good but not great."
""
"Probably won't go for this again, but it was different and a nice change."
""
"330ml bottle. Pint glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Dark mahogany in color, ruby hues to the light. Quickly dissipated head. Notes of forest & chocolate to the nose. Toasted malt upfront, coffee hints. Smooth palate, low bitterness. Medium body, medium/high carbonation. Dry finish. Dark fruit infusion-like on the aftertaste. Very good option in winter days. Easy drinkability."
"Overall - Not my style for sure. The berry flavor is very mild and not the featured flavor, seems like spices, herbs and malts are the main flavor. Spices add a odd bold flavor, kinda like when you add herbs to a meal, and the top of shaker falls off and the whole container falls in the food and you try to scrape away as much as you can, but its still to much. Not for me, was expecting more berry flavor."
"O – Very smooth and easy drinker with some flavor that makes it appealing. My wife loved this one. My first Williams Bros beer and Im looking forward to more."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light to medium. Carbonation doesn't have much to say unless you hold the beer on your tongue. It isn't sticky or coating, nor is it dry. It's simple."
""
""
""
"Poured an eighth inch mocha colored head which vanished within a few seconds. The body is a clear burnt umber brown color, nearly coffee. Smell comes across rich and malty. Taste has the malt, an acidic zing which persists through the finish, and a touch of fruit which must be the elderberries. There's both coffee and cocoa coming across in the finish and the acidity adds a spicey nature. Body is fairly light. An interesting and somewhat unique beer."
""
"O - This is a very enjoyable beer. It has the perfect ratio of roasted malt to fruit presence. I get a little burnt aftertaste that slightly detracts from the overall experience."
"D: A solid ale but in spite of being a gruit; the elderberries are integral to the style, but I think that in this case it'd be better without them as a plain stout or porter. Still, it's far from ruined and worth a try."
""
""
"Notes: It's somewhat thin decent flavor and some decent sweetness. Cheers."
"Overall I picked this up since I like strange beers and an elder berry black ale actually worked pretty well. Would consider trying other things from this brewery."
""
""
""
"A very creamy texture. Well melded and balanced. Another winner from Williams Bros. The herbals are subdued in this one but it’s a pretty fine ale."
""
""
"It goes down so easy, yet there's a nice warming punch in the finish."
""
"Pours like a porter thick body dark caramel ruby almost black with a light tan mocha head, fine speckled lacing. Aroma has dark roasted malts with a light fruitiness, really roasty like a porter with dark chocolate and a touch of coffee roasts. Flavor is great a big rustic porter labeled as a berry infused black ale, that works to. It still tastes like a creamy dark chocolate/roasted coffee beer. This is probably the best base beer with the ancient ingredients having less effect than any of the other ancient ales. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy texture very enjoyable with mellow carbonation goes down easy the glass literally drains itself. Overall a solid black ale that regardless of the label they're putting on it, is damn good."
"Pours a deep dark violet, bordering on black but some deep shades of red come through in the light. Finger or so of bubbly mocha head sit atop this, a bit of sticky lace and mild retention. Nose has some roast, toasted/lightly burnt breads, some berry notes (elderberries I'll presume). Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Taste has more roast notes, dark malts, milk chocolate and subtler berry notes than the nose had presented. Slight metallic and smoke. Mouthfeel is medium, with a relatively low carbonation - similar to almost all of the other beers in this pack, but this doesn't detract from the experience at all, and almost makes this somewhat creamy. Although categorized as a gruit/herbed ale, this could pass as a black ale as well and is certainly much better than several I've had from that style. Nice."
""
""
"Deep brown, ruby highlights, light ring of soapy tan head, no retention or lace. Smell is incredibly roasted, malty, coffee, chocolate, forest fruit, berries, quite fruity and works well underneath all that roast, mild smoke notes as well. Taste is of roasted malt and a floral berries initially, some coffee, quite bitter, subtle chocolate, roast malt in finish with a fruity aftertaste that lingers for what seems like forever. Light-med prickly carbonation, medium body, thin at points, lightly creamy. Quite an interesting brew, some nice flavours and scents here, would revisit gladly."
""
"Quite a solid beer, I'd make this a go-to in the cold weather months if I could get it outside the Historic Ales of Scotland gift pack."
""
"This was the last of my taster pack from the LCBO and I enjoyed all four of the brews immensely. Will definitely seek out anything I see from this brewer in the future."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"Notes: This beer has less body than I expected it to. Slightly thin mouthfeel with a full flavored palate. It's definitely a drinkable beer and a unique experience, but nothing that stands out amongst other beers of the style. Still worth a try."
"O: An excellent dark ale. Very smooth and easy but really blossoms when you take the time to taste its subtler qualities. Very good."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Really glad that I got to try this beer. I would gladly drink it again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"this is a damn good beer for those who like a good malt forward beer. this is my idea of a stout."
"Overall it is a nicely balanec and enjoyable beer."
"O/D - I have to admit that this is pretty good. It's almost like a stout with roots/berries added. It drinks smooth and is quite enjoyable. The aroma is more fruity while the body is stouty-er so I'd prefer the fruit to carry on, otherwise good. I wouldn't reach for this for a session, but it's tasty and well-crafted. A nice suprise."
"O - Not a bad beer but hoped for something bolder from an elderberry black ale. Nice for a mild dark beer."
"D -- Good brew overall, worth trying, definitely different yet still familiar."
"O: This beer seemingly encompasses many different beer styles that I enjoy - stout, saison, porter, bock? Would enjoy enjoying again and multiple times in a sitting."
"D: smooth, rich, complex, but not at all overwhelming. Good."
"Poured out black with of hue of deep red. A small amount of head formed and then dwindled to nothing but a ring around the glass. Aroma is huge. A lot of molasses and earthy notes. Dark/fruity(elderberry,figs). Some roasted malt character but a lot of it is covered up by the molasses. Alcohol also cuts through the nose even though it is 6.5%. A carbonation tingle upfront with some elderberry fruitiness which leads to a metallic/sugary flavor. Shortly after roasted grains comes through with a subtle chocolate finish. Sweet and metallic at the end. Also very dry with a lot of the dark fruit characters coming through. A medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Complex flavors transition throughout sipping this beer. Interesting flavors you may typically find in a barley wine."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking black color. The head had some good body to it but didn't last very long. The lacing was scattered and thin. The smell of the beer has a faint fruity aroma mixed with some roasted malts. The taste of the beer had some Elderberry sweetness to it upfront that faded into a dark toasted dry flavor. The mouthfeel of the been is very smooth and had just enough carbonation to it. Overall I find it to be a pretty enjoyable beer."
"This was a unique beer. Probably the strangest thing for me was the mouth feel. It left my mouth feeling...raw (?), though not necessarily in a bad way, and even a little numb! It pours nearly black, which I always like! I, like others, am not all that familiar with the taste of elderberries. However, the unique flavor of the berries (i think?) shines through without being overpowering or too sweet. It's fairly carbonated (which I was surprised about). It's not really very bitter, though it does have a slightly sour flavor (that could be the alcohol peeking through at the end). I enjoyed it. If it were readily available, it'd be an occasional buy, but not a frequent fridge addition. As part of that Historic Scottish Ales variety pack, however, it was a great addition (the heather beer is awesome). I love trying beers from all over the world (and even beers from across time (ie: Dogfish)), and this was certainly a unique one!"
"Poured dark brown, nearly black, with a small whitish head. Smell of dried fruits, and a little bit of molasses. Taste was of dark dried fruits (I've never had an actual elderberry, so I don't know exactly what they taste like) and, but not very sweet, with some molasses and semi-sweet chocolate. Finishes off pretty dry with a tiny acidic twinge. Medium body, and fairly drinkable, but a little disappointing."
"O - I like this and found it to be an interesting ale. On cask it was very tasty."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for my taste, but overall a very interesting beer with lots of distinct fruity characters."
"Overall, it is simple, yet very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Notes: I found this beer to be very interesting. The fruit is light and delicate. I think it is better to be light on fruit vs. heavy and syrupy."
"glad i tried it but would not seek this out again. started out so promising."
"D: I didn't expect to like this beer, but I enjoyed it very much. Could drink quite a few of these with very little problems."
"D - Drinks alright. Overall it's a nice beer, but it's probably something I wouldn't order again."
"Pours a dark brown color with a bit of a garnet hue. Light tan head sits atop the brew for a bit before falling back down. The nose brings forward a good amount of the elderberry along with some floral notes and a bit of malty sweetness. The taste hits the fruit notes pretty well with the gruit herbs playing a supporting role. Done quite well. The body is medium with average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Overall, a nice beer I was glad to try."
"D - Stuff is different for sure, which is what I was hoping it would be. Not sure if I would want to drink more than one glass of this stuff though."
"This is an ancient beer and deserving of multiple tastes. Go for it!!"
"Highly recommended. Get out there and try a taste of history."
"Drink - I actually enjoyed this beer a fair amount. It had an interesting flavour and I'd drink it again if offered."
"D: Another riveting ancient Scottish beer to savour. I suggest you give it a try, not a must have, but fun to sample something rather uncommon. I could drink a 6 pack of these and really have a fun evening."
"D: not a whole lot going on here. A mangled flavor profile makes this a beer I probably wouldn't buy this again."
"D: The flavor profile is too strong and unconventional for this to be easily drinkable for me. I did find it to a good purchase and am glad I have tried it. This beer made me interested in other beers with elderberry more so than actually drinking more of this beer."
"D - Drinkability is high. This beer is pretty unique but doesn't suffer from trying to be different for the sake of it. It's a nice change of pace and drinks very easily."
"D- This is a very intriguing ale, and has a lot of flavors and aromas in it. Sadly while I was drinking it, the flavor profile seemed to start to fall apart and get watery and separated."
"Quite interesting overall, though it's not really something I'd want to have all the time."
"Small brown head of less than a finger, and fizzled away quickly. Scant lace, and not very clingy. Color is a very dark red, a 38 on the SRM chart. Sweet smell of berries, clover and grain. Sweet tart flavor of berries, caramel, and malt. Good bold feeling in my mouth. Not a beer to get drunk on, but a few in a night would be well worth it."
"Pours very dark brown, opaque beer with decent creamy tan head, almost no laces. Nose is smoky, elderberry, elusive dark malts. Taste is smooth, similar to the aroma, but more malty and roasted. All in all, decent and well drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is above average. Not your typical everyday beer, this elderberry ale. Quite a unique flavor experience, one that might take some getting used to. Wouldn't really down more than one or two of these in a given night, either."
"Eric"
"The first that I've sampled so far of the mixed 4-pack from the brewery. Pours an opaque black with a thin tan head. Nose is an interesting mixture of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate-covered raspberries. Flavour leans slightly to the sweet side; roasted malt is noticeable throughout, some coffee, dark fruit/red wine flavours? Nice crisp, slightly bitter/sour finish, in some ways reminiscient of a dry stout. Medium-bodied, nice soft/creamy mouthfeel. The aroma of this one seemed much more interesting than the taste itself, which lacked any fruity/berry character shown in the nose. However, still enjoyed this one and look forward to the other 3 in the series."
"Bought as park of a 4 bottle pack from this brewery. Pours an opaque dark brown colour with thin tan head. Nice head retention and some mild lacing. Smells of roasted malt with some fruit, quite interesting actually. Flavour has some bitterness from the roast, but more sweetness. Incredibly smooth mouthfeel. This is pretty similar to a porter or a stout, and it is quite nice. I think this is my favourite of the four beers from the brewery."
"D: It would definitely drink this again because it goes down smoothly and is rather unique."
"Ebulum is a drinkable if uninspiring beer. Worth trying once."
"this ale is decent at best, but its still how they used to make it, so for that i have a great deal of respect!"
"Drinkability - I think i can have one of these a sittings. I am glad i bought it as part of the Scottish pack at the LCBO not sure i would hunt down again as a must need."
"It has a decent drinkability with light crispness, light sweetness, and drinks well. However, the stickiness and dry finish don't bide well together and get a little weird feeling late, and almost gritty."
"This beer happened to suit my taste, but I would recommend this as an unusual venture to anyone beer-curious, whether or not I think it would hit home with them"
"D - I really like the taste a lot, but it is extremely dark and the sweetness could easily get annoying after more than one bottle. All in all, great brew from them (a favorite along with the Heather ale and the Midnight Sun)."
"Overall: I dont like this beer but it's a personal matter (my wife liked it), it was kind of flat and watery. I would have it again just to check if it's something wrong with the one I had."
"D-huge malt presence, the sweetness and fruits were less than anticipated. not quite balanced but still pretty tasty."
"D - This brew is a very flavoursome American stout like drop that is very impressive."
"Drinkability: Probably my least favorite of the Scottish Ales pack. This tastes like an ok dry stout with some additional berries. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would rush to get."
"Impressions: Tasty. After having the Fraoch and Grozet on different occasions (I'll review them later), I have to say that this is my favorite from this brewery. Stout lovers should definitely try this."
"I ll have this again!"
"Still a gentle quaffing ale, mild but interesting."
"A very nice, very easy to appreciate beer. Could easily see myself sitting down to several of these."
"This beer is pleasant for sure, but it could be far better with some stronger aroma and flavour notes."
"An enjoyable little brew. Not something I'd pick up too often, but certainly well worth a try."
"If there is a style I would like to see more of, it would be gruit. The nose on this is that of chocolate, raisins, and...is that root beer? The alcohol comes through on the nose as well, but is masked pretty well in mouthfeel. In fact, the mouthfeel is pretty flat, but that is probably due to the small amount of hops used in this. The flavor is sweet, the dark fruits take over on this one, and the elderberry is very subtle. All in all, interesting style...but probably won't be reaching for this one again."
"Drinkability: Great for an experience - not an everyday beer nor am I sure if I'll try again. Still glad I tried it though."
"This one isn't bad. It's a nice departure from what I usually drink, but I don't think it's an everyday thing. It probably would have been better before the date on the bottle. Maybe next time."
"As usual, these Scottish Highlands beers give the beer drinker a fun journey. Quite pleasant."
"The gloomy sky over the highlands on a rainy evening now sits in my shaped pint glass. Normally, I'd agree with you that that sounds at least a bit negative, but this time is different. The gloom is indeed heavy, but there is a glimmer of clarity, some vague smoky garnet highlights that shine through with the sun's dying rays. Beneath this furtively optimistic sky lies a meadow engulfing me with scents of tart berries, rain-soaked heather, fresh raisins, and sugared figs. It's just the right combination of serene invitation and a wild admonition, like the rugged highlands themselves...or so I hear. Bobby Burns can be pretty persuasive. Diving in, those berries, not as tart as they initially appeared, have found themselves enveloped by heather, dark wheat, and tea leaves. It's as new and strange to my tongue as attempting to mimic the accent of the locals. Again, if you've read some Burns, you'll know what I'm talking about. Similarly in this vein, strange though it may be, it's not altogether bad. Just new and unusual. Luckily, the immense weight of the clouds overhead is not mirrored in this brew, which maintains a lightly medium weight that slides nicely along like that babbling brook running through the nearby lea. Like the craggy highlands, this is an acquired taste; if you can get into it, you'll love it, and if not, well, let's just say you won't be attending any local Gaelic Games any time soon. I'd recommend the experience, though."
"Notes: Nice beer. Not as berry flavored as the name could make you believe. Just a very smooth easy going beer. Some stout flavors, but no real roasted bitterness, and some berry flavors but not really sweet or tart. Nice beer just to drink a couple if you want a semi-sweet beer."
"Even though I had already tried the heather beer, I took a shot at the four pack sampler and was pleasantly surprised by the elderberry brew."
"Black with brown highlights and a dense mocha head. Somewhat poor retention and no lace. Mild roasted aroma shows coffee and cocoa powder paired with fruit. Roastiness takes the back seat when it comes to flavour, with the elderberries planted firmly behind the proverbial wheel. Sharp, tangy, and sweet, their fruity flavour put a little bit of something interesting into an otherwise mediocre beer. It's like a generic macro ""dark ale"" with some berry flavour thrown in. Light bodied with soft carbonation. Feels slight, but not thin or watery. Easy drinking and mildly interesting. A more developed roasted malt character would really set this off."
"Overall: Overall, it's a good beer. Nothing about it wows me, but I'd definitly buy another."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of berries and fruit. Taste is also of berries, not to sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good brew."
"Pretty good beer that's not very exciting on the palate and on the basic side regarding taste; nothing really jumped out at me as I drank this beer, it's like there were hints of lots of flavors but nothing to really leave a huge impression. It fits either a dark ale or stout category. While it was quite drinkable and the flavor improved as it warmed, I'm not sure that this would be my first choice if there was a big variety at a bar or store. It was decent enough and I would have this beer again, but it would not be one that I sought out."
"This was probably great fresh."
"Drinkable enough, without having a huge amount of character. It has some uniqueness, which I appreciate, but I'm not convinced that the uniqueness in itself is enough to pull it out of mediocrity. It tastes a little bland overall."
"Well done, Id love some more of this. I could definitely get into trouble with these."
"D: Delicious and very drinkable, just wish it was less expensive. An authentic archaic ale, a must try for the Celtic beer lover like myself."
"Very nice creamy mouthfeel and highly drinkable. Without a doubt the best beer from the four-beer gift pack."
"It isn't bad. it just isn't good. Totally bland and, apart from the novelty of the use of berries for flavour, unmemorable."
"It's an interesting variation on a stout, and yeah. Not bad."
"Drinkability: this stuff is great. Why don't they sell it in sixers?"
"Final Thoughts: Well, this is tied for the worst of the pack but despite that, it is still pretty solid stuff. All in all, decent although I perhaps sweeter then I expect from a darker brew. All in all, after trying this pack, I heartily support bringing gruit back, and would not hesitate to pickup another gruit beer again."
"Overall, this was a very interesting brew. I can't speak as to how it compares to other beers in the style, but regardless it was enjoyable. It tasted very comparable to many Scotch ales. Hopefully I'll get to have a few more gruits to give it something to stand up to. Intriguing beer, though, that I think is definitely worth a shot."
"Complex mixture of flavors, wood, chocolate, roast, lots of roast in the back of the mouth, nice sweetness in the front. This has been my favorite of this vertical and I did not expect that. It is almost porterish in its way. A complicated and interesting beer. Drinkability high, mouthfeel average."
"An interesting if not revolutionary ale. Pours unctions black with a slight off color head. The aroma is fresh and malty, with a peat-like musky smokiness. The flavor is dark and malty, with a hint of fruit - blackberry and currant - and distinct peaty smoke. The mouthfeel is thin, leaving a smoky finish on the tongue. Interesting, drinkable, but perhaps an acquired taste."
"I really like the idea of recovering old beer styles, but this is a pretty average, to slightly above average beer."
"A little bit more full and pronounced in the taste then its other two brothers I've already had, but don't think this is my favourite of the bunch. A more pronounced presence of the dark fruits would have made this beer a lot nicer. 3 down and 1 to go in the Craigmil 4-pack. Hppefully the last will fair better than this."
"D: Great beer. A beer with a huge history and that still stands up very well between modern day brews. Will surely drink this again."
"Overall: Very surprising beer. Different from most beers I had before. I love it!"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, this one doesn't have as much spice or odd flavoring that other beers in the style have, but I still didn't find this beer to be very good."
"If this truly is what 9th century Scottish ale was like than it's safe to say the druids had some mighty fine taste. It is fun to be able to try ancient style ales and feel as though as you're peering back into time or being enchanted by the spirit of a lost people and their culture. Even better yet is when that beer is actually awesome in its own right!"
"Drinkability- This was very good. I will definitely drink this beer again. All those scottish ales have been very good, especially the ancient ones."
"D - One seems drinkable enough, but couldn't drink more than one. The flavor is just not for me, I guess."
"D - While not a terrible beer or drain pour, I think this is prolly gonna be my first and last experience with this one."
"drinkability is ok - this beer is nothing to write home about - i doubt i ever drink it again"
"Ebulum is a (barely) black ale with a red-brown hue. It has a splotchy, dense, light brown head that has great retention and leaves thick lacing on the glass. It has a very strong roasted aroma with notes of coffee and chocolate. It's medium bodied and smooth with a light, clean finish that's a bit acidic. It tastes quite roasty and there's a sharp, green bitterness that plays off that well. It's mostly a coffee flavor, with notes of dark fruit and a dry red wine flavor at the finish. It's unique and tasty."
"D - Fantastic layered ale, that delivers rich dark flavours. This is another beer that I will definitely be drinking again."
"Finish is smooth and has a wiessebier consistency and cloudy, grassy tang at the end."
"Picked up a single for $3.99 to try it out. Poured into a pint glass. Dark, cola colored body. No carbonation noticed, but a large white head formed. Thin lacing on the glass. Smell reminded me a lot of Dr. Pepper soda, with a certain spiciness to it. Taste was not as unusual as I was expecting. At first, it had a roasted barley flavor to it, like a porter. But one you have a mouthful, you can really taste the berry flavor. Goes down with not a lot of aftertaste. Somewhat cough syrup like coating on the palate at the end. Smooth and easy to drink though. On the light side for a 6.5% beer. It was an OK beer; I guess that I was just hoping for more than I got in terms of uniqueness of flavor and taste."
"Drinkability: Quite good. If I could find a six-pack of it as opposed to the Craigmill variety pack, I would certainly buy one."
"M + D: Creamy, but not rich... full, but not thick. In some ways, those statements seem intentionally paradoxical, but it's really how it comes across. It's ""robust," let's put it that way. Big enough to sip at and enjoy. A decent beer, full of flavour and rather unique."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Soft and very smooth, the texture tickles the tongue and provokes the nuances of the malts, hops, and elderberry to open up and really dazzle the palate. It's a very drinkable beer, with a moderate ABV and fantastic balance. I will be buying this again in the near future."
"Mouthfeel is way too thin, needs to be creamier."
"D - Honestly, I like this better than any of the other Ye Olde Scottish brews for the simple fact that it is much more like a ""real"" beer. In my mind, this is a tasty and well made porter with a good deal of milk chocolate smoothness. I can' fault it for its lack of elderberry notes because I have no idea what an elderberry is, but it doesn't really taste like any kind of berry to me. There is a gentle fruitiness that is not uncommon to any yeasty ale, but it doesn't immediately strike me as ""fruit"" per se. This is a really nice beer that I would buy a six pack of if it came in that format. Sadly, this is found as part of an ""historical"" exercise in beer brewing and he other members of the four pack are enlightening, but nowhere near as drinkable."
"Looks pretty similiar to an English stout, dark cola syrup to black. Tan, one finger head after pour that goes down to a ring of foam. Smells like soft scented berries in a dry cream and very light cocoa. Elderberries have a fruity and earthy and herbal smell to them. The taste is creamy and milky. Cold pass for a fruity milk stout easily. Plus the herbal elderberry and chocolate flavors. Creamy smooth and medicinaly herbal palate. The interesting flavors make this beer not very sessionable. But pretty good for a once and awhile enjoyment."
"The beer is black with a tan head. It reminds me a lot of a porter in more than just appearance. The smell is definitely of roast barley. It also has a slight aroma of alcohol. My husband claims he picks up a bit of the berry smell, but I can't find it. The mouth feel is well carbonated and still smooth. This is a beer that could also be aged nicely as well as enjoyed fresh. The taste is dominated by the roasted malts, smokey and maybe a bit nutty. A hint of a metallic note, I suppose maybe a bit like ""Burtonized water..."" Finishes clean. There is a subtle spice at the end, that helps lend a clean balanced bitterness. It's a nice beer and is very approachable for a new style."
"D = I liked this beer but it does get cloying by the end of a bottle."
"Not sure what elderberry is, didn't learn much from this beer. Maybe if I've had it before I could identify it better. Point is, if you like porters then you will probably enjoy this one. Recommended."
"it's definitely drinkable, and fairly enjoyable, although everything feels a touch muted and a touch muddled. there are some interesting things going on, but it just doesn't quite pull together enough for me to truly enjoy it. almost too balanced among its unique attributes."
"This bottle was pretty flat, I don't know if it is supposed to be that way or this one bottle was flat, so ill go easy on that rank. But like my SO said, wow that's nice, I could have a few of those. it is a very drinkable brew."
"Overall - Not something i'd be rushing back to... too many off notes and very rough around the edges..."
"D - There are some good flavors here, I'm not sure this is a ""bad beer," even though I find it a challenge. I think this would be far better served with some food. On its own, it's kinda sharp for my liking."
"Pours a four finger tan head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Totally black color. Slight malty nose. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is roasted malt, I don't get any elderberry taste. Best by Aug 2009. $3.00 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Drinkability: Yes. This is a beer that I would consider an all year beer. The flowery, fruity sweetness hints of summer, while the dark black ale carries us through winter. This is not a beer I would cosume on quantities because it warrrants taking time and enjoying, but it is easy to enjoy."
"Pours black with a red hue when help up to light. Thin tan head. Just a bit of retention and good lace. Body is on the thicker side of medium with some carbonation. Aroma is of smokey malts and coffee.Taste is the same with a hint of dark chocolate. Worth a try but I liked Sam Adams Black Lager better."
"This is a cool beer that reminds me of an English style old ale but darker. It pours black with a thick tan head that fades to a thin tan line (probably from the G string) leaving slow, long lasting lacing. Maybe the tan line is from the lacing... Never mind. Anyway, the nose is roasted malts with a musty woodiness. The flavor is a nice, pretty mild bitterness with roasted malt tones and notes of blueberry skin on the finish. Berry flavor develops a bit as it opens up. The body is a very nice medium mouthfdeel with great carbonation. Very cool brew."
"Take your time with this one. This is not a beer of over-the-top flavors or aggressive characteristics. Instead it is a quiet sipper with a depth of complexity to please even the most jaded of beer enthusiasts."
"Overall it was really challenging to drink, as I couldn't pinpoint any one defining characteristic. I don't think that I would reach for this again."
"Even though the taste was thin, I'm glad I got to try this beer. It was different. If you want to try new beers, then definitely try this one. You're not going to find many beers with elderberries and roasted oats in them. One bottle will do it for me, but at least it was fun to drink."
"Conclusion: This is a nice brew. It's not something I drink all the time, but rather something I come back to every once in a while as a special treat kind of thing. The elderberries add just the barest kick of fruitiness which really nicely compliments the smoky, earthy notes."
"Overall a terrific and unique ale for sure. The spiciness really suited itself nicely for the first real snowfall of the oncoming Christmas season. With that said, I think I might buy a couple more and enjoy them fireside next to the Christmas tree. I wish the body had a little more traction though. Great fresh nose and overall a great beer."
"D_The burnt and roasty notes make this such a tasty beer but not very easy to have many of. I would have another just for the taste, but it would probably really, really fill me up"
"I picked this up while grabbing a couple porters & schwarzbiers, listening to my wife's advice. The 11.2 oz. bottle poured a dark brown with a slight beige head & scotch-coffee-porter aroma. The head dissipated fairly quickly leaving little lacing, but a slight banana and dark berry smell soon added to the aroma's already rich smell. A stout-like feel to the mouth, although not to the Guinness level. The flavor definitely fulfilled the aroma with a Scotch porter taste with tasty earthiness to it. There was a slightly alcohol aftertaste, but not overwhelming. Definitely a fine pour for my mood!"
"Good, but I wouldn't actively go and seek it out."
"Very smooth in the finish, soft carbonation and full bodied. The texture is oily and thick. The carbonation is probably medium to low and very smooth. Fantastic beer. I'd love to have this with red meat or any kind of savoury dish."
"D= This was a dangerously drinkable ale with a serious amount of alcohol that is nearly undetectable. The sweetness of the berry flavors made this one more of a dessert beer, but a damn good one at that."
"I was facinated when I first read about Gruit, and have been anxious to try a really good version. Just thinking about drinking something that was passed around in ancient celebration of life is truly an enlightening experience."
"4 M&3 D: overall the mouthfeel is just ultra-smooth, almost the smoothest dark beer I've ever had; but the softness on top of a mild and rather simplistic taste of this black ale turns against itself, making it a bit boring to drink pretty soon... The small bottle, 330ml, is just about the right size, IMO~~"
"It drinks like a Schwarzbier, or a light American Porter. Sticky on the lips, with a modest carbonation level. Easy enough to drink, but i'd prefer a porter to this."
"D: This beer suprised me. The earthy notes made me expect a Belgian dark ale, but the taste was close to a stout with a lighter mouthfeel. A great, different brew that's good for a change of pace. Not quite a dessert beer, but certainly not a session beer either."
"D : It's a unique beer that was solid but not spectacular. Not something I would seek out but not something I would avoid."
"For a black ale, I swear this is more of a stout. Still, very delicious and the use of elderberries does add more of a well-rounded sweetness to it. Overall, very drinkable."
"A solid beer, but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: Not something I would go out of my way for but alright. It would be a sipper at best."
"I guess I don't like elderberry, if that is what is responsible for the horrid medicinal/herbal quality of this brew."
"smooth, with some acidic and faintly astringent textures. moderate carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable. Like a light porter with berries. There may be something to these elderberries."
"I wish I had a long, curly, dirty, beard braided at the bottom, so I could have Elderberry Ale drippin off my soaked locks. These barbarians could brew. Impressive beach bum head with a black abyss of a body. Smells of mocha and toffee; these crazy bastards would love Starbucks. Crisp, with a character reminiscent of a Robust Porter and a slight tart similiar too a rasberry or kiwi. The palate remains smokey yet suprisingly clean with no nasty Medeival off flavors. If I can't rock the helmet with horns or the badass facial hair, I can only hope the brewers of this magnificent ale do."
"Wonderfully complex interplay of flavors, a little red wine here, a little oatmeal stout there, not too bad at all and certainly on the interesting end."
"Taste is roasted with molasses and coffee and chocolate notes. The spices add ginger, juniper, gagel and a lot of other spices and they must add bitterness, because I taste a different kind of bitterness, more like bitternut or something. Not the kindest of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to thin and aftertaste is lingering bitter and roasted."
"Drinkability here is high, of all the Gruit I've had this is some of the best for sessions and hot summer days, as when its cold it leaves you feeling refreshed."
"This was a very unique beer. It reminded me of a hybrid between a sweet stout and a red wine. It was definitely quite different from any beer (gruits or otherwise) I have ever sampled."
"Got this in a ""Historic Brews of Scotland"" mix pack. Poured it chilled in my Samuel Adams pint glass (yay free glassware!) Looks straight up black as an eclipse with a minute black cherry color when you hold it up to the light. Smell is very pleasent, elderberries dominate with some dark chocolate and a whiff of roasted coffee. Taste much like a good porter with brewed coffee in the front but stinging on the tonuge and a finish that lasts forever. I enjoyed this very much."
"pours up black as night. brown tinted head with moderate retention. aroma of fruit (i guess its the elderberry) and roasted malt. tastes of roasted malts, dark fruit, brandy. light bodied, low carbo. dry malt with sweet fruit finish. scotland the brave!"
"Very nice fruit and floral notes; well-balanced and satisfyling."
"Drinkability : not very common beer, in the Scottish gruit style"
"Probably wouldnt seek it out again."
"What's not to like? A fruity smooth stout with the aroma of its roasted barley, good stout like thickness, no coffee. Good complexity, mild acidicty in the finish. And elderberries are as healthy as wine because they are blue, seriously.Oh, and chocolate too."
"Murky dark brown - almost black with a tiny cask head. Aromas of distant nail polish and pretzels at the mall. I found that rather intriguing. The flavor was similar with some tartness thrown in. Someone at the bar said, ""horse blanket."" I tasted horse blanket. Medium body and a slightly sour finish. The night it was on cask I had just missed one of the main guys from the brewery who was there to meet and greet. They said he was cool. Then I found out there was a half-empty cask (now fully up to room temperature) of Bell's Porter in the back that had been taken off the beer engine to make way for this new beer under current review. Which was not in the ""cellar temp"" cooler long enough to be any cooler than tepid. Then I got mad. The bartender said not a lot of people even showed up for this event either. Great."
"D - A very nice beer. Roasty chocolate and berries work well together. An interesting & complex beer without being overpowering."
"A bit dry in the mouth, but it works. Overall, quite tasty."
"D: It was very smooth and refreshing. The balance of spices and malts was pleasing. This is my first experience with this style and I will be back for additional brews."
"Great ale hope to find it again"
"Overall not bad, I'd get this one again."
"Drinkability: Interesting and certainly fine enough for a single bottle, but not something I'd want to make a habit of."
"Bottle from the LCBO, which was packaged with three other beers from the brewery. Pours very dark with a small tan head. Its appearance reminded me of a stout, and when I held it up to the light I couldnt see through, and felt like I was regarding the darkness of my own soul... Aroma is fruity, and reminded me somewhat of an abbey ale. This beer is thick on the palate, and in wine terminology it has long legs. The predominant flavour was a dark fruity sweetness, which conjured up images of dates. I couldnt 100% place it, and I suppose I should go out and taste an elderberry. A tasty brew, but not as satisfying as the Alba."
"This beer is definatly different from anything I've had before. Mostly dark flavors but also has fruity berry flavors as well. Not an instant favorite but I'd definatly buy it again. So far I've been impressed w/ every ale that I've tried by this brewery."
"Pours an opaque black with a dark tan head that leaves a lot of lacing. Nose is licorice, berry, and earthy. Flavor is smooth and with much depth. Hearty like a stout with roasted qualities, but just a bit of hearty berry edge. Feel is thick with character, but with a lower carbonation. Drinkable? This is one brewery that I want to try everything they put out. Unique, well balanced, and worth the time, money, and pleasure."
"I'd drink it again, but would probably pair with some food. I thought the taste itself was really overbearing sometimes. Tasty, but by itself can be too much."
"D - Quite drinkable; in fact, this may be the most drinkable ""historic beer"" that I have had. It kind of reminds me of a black lager (except for the coffee notes) with a nice, subtle fruitiness. The elderberries really add character to this beer and rise above the level of the gimmick I feared they might be."
"Tastes of sweet toasted malt, sour fruits, molasses and some chocolate."
"Pours a nice head that quickly falls thin and doesn't disappear. The lacing is very good, sticks great. The color is black and unsee-through able. Smell is dark roasted and a little earthy. Like a black ale with some mossy smells to it. There are some chocolate notes as well. Taste is slightly roasty with those mossy flavors and some off-flavors almost rubbery-like flavors. Good mouthfeel very pillowy. Overall, I wouldn't have another one of these. Unless I was in Scotland I can never know when these Gruits are still good."
"Overall, a very different kind of beer. Not really my bag, but very redeeming as a change of pace."
"The flavor is a bit more complex than I was expecting, with the burnt malts interacting well with the barley and oats, and what I assume is the elderberry. A nice tartness and a subtle red wine flavor rounded out the beer nicely. It reminded me a bit of a schwartzbier, which is not a bad thing. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but well carbonated. This is a really unique beer, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Seems a little watery to me. Moderate carbonation. Not the most drinkable beer ever, but it's certainly interesting."
"This beer is a complex melange of sorts. You'll start out with a very dark, almost porter like, color with very little head and only minimal lacing. The beer is medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. The smell is sweet molasses, charred wood, blackberry, maybe some cocoa in there as well. The taste is where the complexity really shines. It begins with a sweetish maltiness, a bit like caramel, berry, and tangy citrus. The mid section segues into a more semi-sweet chocolate, almond configuration, and ends with more of the burnt wood, smoky peat, and warming alcohol notes flavor. The mouthfeel leaves a bit of a film on the tongue, perhaps from the residual berry. The aftertaste is moderate and brings out the warming alcohol notes. Drinkability ... that's a question mark and it really depends upon the season and the dish that one is eating. Standing alone, this is a beer I wouldn't contemplate having more than one, but coupled with an entree, there are more possibilities I would be open to. This beer is characteristic of the Scotch ale style and would complement heavier pub fare. This beer is truly complex and for that alone, well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D: Tasty brew. Lacks some carbonation which would have made it a bit nicer in my book. Flavors are good but a tad cloying after a bit."
"This wonderful black ale pours out dark with a wonderful tan head, giving it a very porter-like appearance. It has wonderful malty/oaky/smoked peat scents with no one dominating smell, but rather a nice mixture of them all. This beer goes down smoothly and it would be easy to drink quite a few at one setting. It has a nice dark, oaky flavor with a hint of smoke and a tiny hint of elderberry in it. A wonderful dark ale to try."
"330 ml bottle, at Haket, Göteborg. Black colour, moderate but lasting creamy head. Strong aroma of roast malts, chocolate and elderberries. Flavour is mellow and rounded with chocolate and elderberries, surprisingly well balanced. Now also available in Norway at Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Good beer!"
"smooth and drinkable, but kinda boring."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable; while the berry flavour is noticeable, it's not overpowering and the base beer is quite well done."
"Drinkability: Smooth and easy to drink. I would like a beer with berries so prominent in the name to have a more fruity flavor, but that may just be what you get with elderberries. Though the beer lacks anything to make it stand out in any department, it is good. Not something to go out of your way for, but still good."
"Medium bodied, substantial yet refreshing, this is really a brilliant drink."
"12oz bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Rather opaque black-red body with a very thin light tan head. Aroma is dominated by nuttiness and fruitiness with a firm bit of roastiness in the background. Tastes like berries and chocolate more than anything. A slight nuttiness is in the background. as well as a smoky quality. Lots of stuff in this flavor. Medium body. A tasty complex beer, that's for sure. Not sure I'd ever be drawn to this one again, but definitely a very tasty solid ale."
"D - I bought this beer on a complete whim and I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least. This beer isn't just a weak ale with common berries added (like most fruit beers on the market). Instead, it's a rich black ale (much like a schwartzbier) with elderberries added. This leads to a much more complex character, and keeps the fruitiness completely in check. I'm glad I found this one! Looking forward to having one or two of these again on a cool evening as summer winds into fall -- this beer's perfect weather."
"Overall: Another off the wall beer, one I suppose is good for broadening ones historical perspective of beer, but a curiosity nonetheless. Worth a try."
"The flavors in this beer are fairly one dimensional some how. The berry note is nice, but is too dominant; the beer is also a bit too thin and the roast character only adds some acidity and astringency in the finish. If the base beer was more flavorful I think this would actually work. As it is, this beer is a touch boring, though certainly not undrinkable."
"D - A pleasant dark ale w/ sweet berry and roasted malts - what's not to like. I would consider this a good aperitif, but it would pair well with cheese or lighter fare."
"Aroma is strong and malty, with a hint of saltiness and a strong berry overtone - perhaps elderberry (I'm not sure what elderberries actually smell like). Pours a rich, deep, opaque sable with a thick tan head. Flavor is stouty and has a nice bitter edge with fruity/berry hints. It feels thicker than most ales although not quite as thick as a fine stout or porter, and is very smooth."
"truly unique ancient ale"
"FAR superior to the Fraoch Heather Ale. Well worth the $3.25 for 11.2 oz. bottle. (Would still prefer a pint size bottle.)"
"Notes: Ehhhh not for me."
"Overall, recommended. Was interesting, but lacks the complexity needed to get me to buy another bottle."
"Pleasant, peculiar, absolutely to taste again."
"T: there is an earthy coffee taste, and then a more sweet fruit taste as well. very layered and interesting, and yet very smooth and enjoyable too. I have no idea what elderberry tastes like, so im not sure if i can pick it up. however with a nice medium mouth feel and a good swish in the mouth this is a great beer thats very enjoyable to drink."
"Drinkability: Very nice. This is the second ale imported from Scotland that I have tried (first was Belhavens Scottish Ale) and I have to say that the Scots have brewing down to an art. I would definitely buy this one again and look forward to trying more from Scotland."
"D: I would definitely drink this again. Its complex flavors allow for a truly pleasurable experience. It goes down fairly well, and theres very little I can complain about."
"Pours pitch black with a foamy, bubbly brown head that thins out quick but keeps a hearty ring of big bubbles alive around the edges of the glass. Not much lace to speak of. The bouquet is, well, fruity. So THIS is what elderberries smell like! Interesting. I like this. I've never smelled a beer like this before, which makes sense not having had an elderberry beer before. Very pleasant aroma. I get some raisin and plum scents here too, as well as some apple scent. The taste is strange. It's really thin up front, but after it sits in the mouth and warms up a bit there is a noticeable change in composure. Perhaps it has something to do with the brewed qualities of the elderberry, but the flavor is very muted, almost nonexistent, at first. Then, after a second or two, the fruit flavors present themselves and the whole thing livens up a bit. Finishes fruity and tart with the slightest hint of hops. And then, after you think it's all over, it actually gives off a bitter coffee aftertaste. It's subtle at first, but the flavors here are much more complex than you think in the beginning. I am surprisingly impressed by this beer for a number of reasons. If you try this, be sure to let it sit a bit and warm up to really give the flavors a chance to make their presence known. Not exactly what I would call a session beer, but one that I would definitely try again. Would go very well with certain berry-centric desserts."
"drinkability is good. nice balance between the sweetness, alcohol, and light bitterness."
"Wow, I really like this beer. This brewery keeps pushing the edge with interesting and nearly forgotten recipes, and it continues to impress me. Give me a fridge full of this stuff!"
"Solid brew."
"Pours a clear black with a light tan head that laces very well. Aroma fruit esters and probably elderberries (as I don't know what they smell like). Taste was stoutish, with roasted malt, burnt toast, and a long dry finish, didn't notice much berriness to it though. Mouthfeel was smooth and dry. Had this in a gift set including Alba, Fraoch, and Grozet, and this one was definitely my favourite."
"Drinkability: Mellow tones with an interesting panoply of flavors make this one of my favorites from this brewery"
"This beer poured black with a hint of red. The red being most noticeable at the edges where more light could filter through. Any head quickly disappeared to leave a hint of lace at the edges. The nose was malty sweet with a hint of berry and some smoky notes at the end. Smooth mouth with a hint of after taste and very little carbonation. I tried it, won't drink it again, but I do not like dark beers."
"12 oz. bottle- color of brownish purple , with medium tan quickly departing head - nose of malts , mold , cocoa , hopps , and dark red fruit  taste of , dark red fruit , earthy , red wine , chocolate , and malts - body medium , and creamy  aftertaste of malts , chocolate with hint of jammy red wine (zin)"
"This was a great brew. The ale poured a deep dark mahogany with great lacing and a thick dark head. Fruity, hoppy aromas gave way to a perfectly balanced flavor profile- slight berry sweetness with an aggressive bitterness which lasts to the end. Slight earthy and cherry notes enhance the beer as it warms. Very well crafted, refreshing beer."
"I found this one and knew I had to try it. It poirs and very darkih red with a dense tan head that reduces down into a good lacing and a crown. The smell is rich and warm, with sweet berry accents. The taste is rich, with chocolate and berries flavors, and it finishes a bit tart. It goes down smooth too. A very good herbed ale and very enjoyable."
"This is an unusual drink and good for what it is. This is the fourth of a four-pack series I bought and it is my favorite. Not something I would want with any regularilty, but a nice ""something different"" rare treat."
"Overall, the aromatics of the elderberries are there but subtle, overtaken by the rich nature of the darker malts. Satisfying."
"Interesting and personally prefered to their spruce beer."
"Profile: Imagine a rich coffee stout infused with wild botanicals and musty berry fruit and you will nail this dark elixer...finish is wet and long and infused with the stout-fruit tastes but slightly bittering from the hops...very nice dark ale....more like a fruit and herb flavored thick porter or stout."
"Pours a very dark red/black, thick tan head forms, settles to a layer and ring with nice lacing. Smell is sweet and roasty, smells like a stout with a nice smooth berry aroma, coffee and chocolate. Roasty chocolate in the front, sour berries in the middle, chocolate and berries in the finish, really neat. Real tartness down the throat. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very creamy and smooth. I really enjoyed this, hopefully good things to come from this set of beers. Definately interested in trying more old school Scottish ales."
"really quite drinkable, and pretty tasty. i'd pick up a six pack..."
"Brew pours to a dark brown if not black color and does not seem to let much of any light through. Has a nice medium tan colored head that has some retention and leaves a fair amount of lacing down the side of the brew. The aroma has a lot going on, coffee, fruit (berries) and a wine like scent seem to be very noticeable. Notice chocolate and coffee flavors from the onset from the nice roasted/burnt malt. In the middle I notice some fruit/berry flavors coming through, a very nice tasting brew. Also has a somewhat dry finish to it. Overall I like this brew, reminds me of a porter but what do I know! I would get this one again."
"Body is medium, creamy, and very slippery smooth. The oats add a nice fullness and the carbonation is very gentle and soft. Much better than their Grozet."
"Pours dark brown/back, not too viscous. Modest head, yet nice collar and some lacing. Has a slight sour smell on the nose, but with obvious chocolate and roast. Given their other beers, i was expecting a little more from this one. Starts out soft with some chocolate roast, and a little tartness (elderberries?), tartness is coupled with the bitterness from the dark roast and melds well, drying off into the finish. Nice flavor, but relatively simple. This has a certain similarity with their other beers, common yeast maybe? Medium, medium light mouthfeel with soft carbonation. It is fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is my favorite of the pack so far (only the Alba remains). I'd buy this again, if it was available on its own. I did think the elderberry would be more prominent, though."
"Extremely dry beer as it hits the back of the both with a strong body to it that hits with sherry notes, fruity, and spicy. Dark black in color. I often have a hard time getting back to beers that I like--always distracted by the new beer to dry, but this is one that I often pick up a bottle of when out shopping to have again and again. Very good beer, and it warms up very well (not like an old ale but ok), so you can sip it for a while."
"It had a large, frothy, sand coloured head that actually stuck around for a while. Reminded me of 100's of porters and stouts I have had throughout my life. Smell is semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and plenty of roasted malt. If you are looking for it, there is a slight presence of berries hidden deep, deep down. Taste is sweet and malty with plenty of coffee bean-like bitterness following the initial malty sweetness. This is quite good and lovely surprise. Mouthfeel is very soft and gently with a medium weight body. I feel I could drink 3 or 4 of these in a sitting, and certainly feel it would accompany a meal well. I'll certainly buy this again."
"Can't taste the elderberry and the entire beer is a bit too weak for my taste."
"A nice offering easy enough to drink, and unusual in its taste."
"Surprisingly good fruit flavored stout. Well worth a try. Flavor is complex and enjoyable."
"A good one to try..."
"Aroma is mostly dark chocolate, coffee and elderberries in the background, with the taste being very much the same. Mostly coffee up front, followed by dark chocolate, coffee and a hint of fruit. The elderberries become more pronouced in the finish. Very smooth and creamy, with good carbonation."
"Mouth: Nice, dark roasty flavors co-mingle with the rich flavors of the elderberries. Unfortunately, the first flavors are the best. From there we go to a weak showing in the back of the mouth, with almost no bitter balance and a slightly plastic, very undesirable finishing taste. The mouthfeel is horrible - it's like a cask ale except thinner. There's absolutely no carbonation aside from a tine twinge on the front of the tongue. I won't be buying this one again."
"This is pretty tasty. It's too bad I only have one."
"This beer poured a rich black that was intriguingly flat with little head. The aroma was of dark fruit almost wine like. The taste was surprisingly light with a good dose of bittered fruit. The feel was heavy, and very dry. I purchased this beer because I wanted something different and this fit the bill. The lack of carbonation and the winelike qualities were nice. While I doubt I'll ever by a six, I'm sure I'll pick up the occaisional single."
"Enjoyable and nicely drinkable. I have a great appreciation for experimental and challenging brews, though this one falls a little unsettled. A medium viscous black hue with light head retention and fair lacing. Smells quite 'Schwarzbier'-like with a soft, powdered sugar sweetness. Stong with the berries (raspberries and blueberries) in the flavor and lightly in the aroma. Turns to vineous or wine-like midway through the drink with a grapelike flavor and sweetness in the finish. A moderate alcohol feel and flavor shows in the finish as well. Good, but off on the toasted quality and underlying sweetness. Lacks boldness for such character."
"A nice beer to have a lot of if you want a dinkable fruit beer with nice malts. I'll probably have this again sometime."
"The berries are mostly in the smell of this beer. Overall a very earthy beverage that leaves a sour taste on the tongue. More complex and malty than I expected and well worth a try."
"Poured a virtually black color with attractive tannish head. Nice lacing on the side of the glass as the head very slowly fell to a thick ring. Smell is porter-llike with nice toasted notes, chocolate and coffee undertines, and a bit of fruitiness (elderberry?). Taste shows miuch more of the fruitiness, and forces the toasted and coffee tastes to the background. Some alcohol presence is also noted. A nice creamy mouthfeel combines with a mild bitterness at the finish to create a very enjoyable beer. Very easy to drink. Would be an excellent after-dinner drink."
"This came from a 4 beer variety pack. It pours very very dark if you hold it up to the light there is no change. Very little head that fades quickly. Faint aroma with an almost sweet red wine smell. Mouthfeel is fair but the flavor is pretty weak. I would call this an interesting novelty beer but must admit I am not that familiar with the elderberry."
"Highly recommended. Hoping this is available outside of Christmas gift packs, as I'd definitely like to have some in stock!"
"Thanks to Christy and Vincent - purveyors of tasty delights."
"poured dark brown small tan head. aroma dark berries and molasses, alcohol, dark brown sugar and hints of coffee I hop the flavor is as good as the aroma. flavor sorry to say but no weak.strange as I tasted this I kept getting differant flavors with each sip.!st sip was molasses 2nd the berries came out, 3rd malts and honey.than it started over. It wasnt as sweet as I thought it would be. not a bad beer"
"D - I can't forsee this one matching with foods well. Sessionable? Not likely, it is too strong anyway. I don't think I'll partake in this one again. The fruit presence is subdued, this is more like a porter than anything. A not so good porter at that."
"It poured with a very thin layer of head, even though I poured fairly vigorously. That was probably the only disappointing part about this experience. The color is very close to pitch black and is certainly opaque. The nose is a highlight, malty/brandy/chocolate lends ideas that this may be a treat. The mouthfeel is syrupy and robust, expected from the look of it. There are mostly chocolate and toffee notes throughout, with underlying tones of elderberry (of course). But they act as a good compliment and as a character developer. The finish is a little more roasty with a wine-like dryness. Its surprising how easy to drink this beer is."
"Idiosyncratic beer that I'm guessing gives us a glimpse into the past & future of home brew. Seek it out!"
"Quite good."
"Pours a dark garnet with a short-lived one finger head in a Pokal settled down slowly to a thin collar. Good lacing in the wake. Aroma of berries was prominent as brew warmed later malt and alcohol surfaced, I was prepared for sweet blueberry pancake syrup but was pleasantly suprised with a dryish complex brew. There was some a hint of berries, maltiness, some dark chocolate black coffee and chicory or field greens and a touch of alcohol with a rather dry finish. A mostly satisfying brew."
"Pours near black with decent off white head. The aroma is malty and chocolately with a subtle berry scent buried in back. The taste did not contain as much elderberry flavor as I thought it would. The flavor of this ale is made mainly of chocolate malts and coffee flavors. The elderberry flavor, much like the elderberry aroma, is buried in the back and is not that noticeable. This is a pretty good ale that I wouldn't mind having a second round of."
"D: Great!"
"Pours Dark black/brown with amber highlights. The head is dark tan and the nose is old dried fruit and malt. I loved the full mouthfeel of this beer with all its jammy notes combined with a big malt backbone. Almost a rougher relation to Traquair's Jacobite Ale. Very tasty and unique."
"A really interesting beer, almost flanders red like with the fruitiness and tartness"
"Overall: Bears a great deal of similarities to a milk stout but enough differences to stand on its own feet."
"All I can say is that this one started out great, and really hit a wall with the taste. I will not be buying this again."
"Not my favorite beer in the world. The taste is very similar to a porter, but a little sweeter and not as offensive. If you like porters, it's worth a try I suppose. I probably wont be buying this one again."
"Not a bad beer, but not one I would probably seek out."
"Defiantly a departure from the beers I've tasted lately. Wont be looking for this anytime soon."
"Palate- Rich, bitter. Licorice, coffee, smoke notes pervade. Dry, but mouthfilling. Clean. The berry flavors are there, but restrained. This is anything but a foo-foo fruit beer. It is chewy and smokey. The bitterness is wonderfully satisfying."
"Black ale? Man they wern't kidding. This puppy is black with a slight 1/8"" head on top. Average aroma-some malt and a slight metalic note to it. Big malty flavor-slight bitterness. Doesnt have that underlying caramel sweetness you get in Scottish ales. The elderberries are there but in a muted presence. They come thru more in the after taste. Nice body. Overall a very well balanced beer. It has a great ""inky blackness"" to it and the fruit rounds out the whole thing. Would love to have this on draft."
"Didn't know what to expect when I saw this, but figured it was worth a try. Not nearly as sweet as most Scottish beers I've had. The berry comes through in the aftertaste. Very dark in appearance. Good balance, easy to drink. A unique beer, suited well for desert. I can't think of another beer to compare it with, maybe a Scottish Three Philosophers? Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a purplish brown in color with very little head. Aroma is very slight with hard to distinguish anything at all. Maybe smells like a brown ale or some caramel. Dark roasty hints barely detectable. Sip reveals mostly a taste of a black ale with no fruit. Dark coffee notes. Almost like a watered down stout."
"Pours like a stout, black with a coffee-colored head. Smells like dark cherry and old coffee. Taste is quite complex: dark fruits, stout-like bitter malts, and a medicinal, tart berry with a prominant coffee ground aftertaste. It was hard to pick everything out. I would have given a higher taste score if the flavors meshed a little better, but still enough to keep me interested. Really reminded me of a sweet stout. Says it's a black ale on the bottle, so that's kind of vague. Mouthfeel was smooth, a little undercarbonated for my liking, but alright. I don't know if I'd want more than one or two of these, but it was a good beer, kept me interested throughout, and certainly worth a try."
"Poured out to a coffee like black color with a minimal head, and some lacing. Low to very low carbonation. Scents of berries and roased herbs were noted, albeit theyn were very light. Flavor was smooth and medium bodies with flavors of cooked oats, dark berries and grassy earth toward the end. Decent mouthfeel, rather soft and creamy. Not a bad beer. Definitly a night brew, for after dinner or dessert."
"Dark brown beer with a light brown head. Looks like a porter. Foam eventually reduces to a ring around the glass. Roasted and chocolate maltiness with a fruity, berry aroma. More of the same in the flavour, but the berry character is more pronounced and the malt character is more mild. Finishes with a dry, roasted bitter twang. Slick mouthfeel, medium/light body, carbonation on the low side. A nice mix of flavours, quite enjoyable."
"Another historical ale from Brewery Craigmill, this style was supposedly brought to Scotland, by Welsh Druids according to the label. Appearance is a deep purple, almost black body that shines a clear, radiant ruby hue when held to a strong light. Small beige head quickly dissipates, leaving no lace. Aroma is subdued, with dark roasted grain notes and a hint of berry. Light medium bodied with low carbonation in the mouth. Taste has a mildly bitter coffee note, porter like in nature, and a softness from the oats. Mild berry presence could be a bit more assertive in this one, but the taste is well balanced and pleasant to sip. I wouldn't mind having two or three of these at a sitting."
"Pours a dark porter with reddish tint and no head and slight filmy lace. Smell is nice like roasted malt, coffee, and sweet alcohol. The taste is very much a dark ale with characteristics of malt and coffee on the front, dried fig middle and clean fruit finish. Well-balanced. Low carbonation leads to little to no head and thin cereal on the tongue with slight hop tingle on the finish. Nice sipping beer but balanced enough for more than one."
"Drinkability: Hey, it's not for me. Maybe you like elderberries. Or venison. It does have a cool, medieval bottle."
"Pours dark red, almost black. Almost no head at all gets me thinking this doesn't look too far from a very dark wine. Vinous berry and woody nose, with noticeable malt and subtle smokiness. The sweet berrries come in early and move into slight acidity as the flavor progresses. I'm enjoying the roasted grain and smoke flavors as they coalesce with the vinous berries. A little chocolate is there as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but the flavor is big, and I think that sounds appropriate for what this beer is shooting for. Finish is a little dry, and composed mainly of roasted grain, with a bit of acidity. Long chocolately roasted aftertaste. I thoroughly enjoy these ancient beer styles from Brewery Craigmill, and this one does not disappoint. Hell of a specialty beer, and way drinkable to boot."
"Wow, that's refreshing! I am very pleasantly surprised. Medium-heavy bodied, very wet mouthfeel, great condition. You get a grand tour of what an ale can be like. Imagine every great flavor you've ever had in an ale, rolling across your tongue.. with elderberries.. and there you have it."
"This is a different kind of beer but definately in a good way. It pours very dark/black with a dark brown head. The head on mine didn't last all that long. The taste was sweet and malty with a nice blend of dark fruit. It has a light bitterness to it as well. Good mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. I like this beer a lot. It's out of the ordinary which is always refreshing. I recommend trying this brew for sure."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a dark foamy head with average retention. I can only describe the aroma as a strange mix between roasted malt and semi-sweet fruit (kind of remind me of Weyerbacher raspberry impy stout). Taste is also a mix between the elderberry sweetness/sourness and the bitterness coming form the roasted malt. Overall, I would say that I enjoy this because it is out of the ordinary and that seems refreshing."
"Black. Very black. A shade or two lighter than Pepsi, but still black. No other colours shine through. No real head. Just a ring of lace around the rim of the glass. Still, some strings of lace manage to stick around. Tart berries, lemon, bread, and oatmeal on the nose. Somewhere, their is a smell of a campfire. I'm not sure what it is though. Burning wood? Smoke? Food cooking over the fire? Simply complex, if that makes any sense. Big taste of tart wildberries and lemon mingle with a malty sweetness. The oats come through with their soft, subtle tones. Not very many hops I can detect. The tartness is commanding. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. The blend of sweet and sour makes this an after dinner beer."
"D- This is an interesting beer. It has a nice balance of maltyness and bitterness even though there are no real hop presents in this beer. The fruit is a secondary character that compliments the grains very nicely."
"A bold beer to a historic recipe that is top quality."
"Pretty hard for one to get their hands on one of these without buying a Historic Ales of Scotland 4 pack, so that's exactly what I did. Poured into a chalice, a deep dark hue, more of an intense opaque brown than a black, ruby red highlights around the base when held to direct light, otherwise pretty damn opaque. Spongy tan head on the pour, big bubbles throughout, but it becomes more creamy as the ale settles in the glass. Sticky lacing. Coffee and roasted chocolate malt immediately on the nose, with a piney backbone to it, somewhat herbal, with notes of dates and currents, the aroma becomes a bit sour at the very end. Roasted malt and some espresso at first in the flavour, a herbal, woodsy taste in the middle, with bitter malt and some grassy, herbal notes on the finish, from the elderberries I would assume. The body texture is light, but the mouthfeel is smooth and a bit velvety, thanks to the good head retention. A nice sipping ale, malty with some herbal quirks, I enjoyed it even though I am not craving another one. I have a soft spot for herbal beers, and the Ebulum tickles it enough for the mean time. Those Welsh Druids knew what they were doing."
"Taste: Roasted malt, but with a nice sweet and tart blackberry twang, it sort of reminds me of Magic Hat's feast of fools, albeit a much more tame version."
"Last swigs: Raw Dr. Pepper and berry sweetness. 6.5% ABV is a surprise. I had this one in the 4-5% range. An authentic olde style which needs to be warmed above fridge temps. Never having had Elderberries, this has a slight berry suggestion at best. History lesson over. 75/3.86"
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan/brown color head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and malty scent that boasts of roasted barley, black and caramel malts along with a faint elderberry aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth and rich black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a slight tart elderberry taste. It's got a pretty unique taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It has a complex palate that is quite tastey and drinkable."
"A bit thin, and a unique taste that makes this a sort of finisher beer, one a night, but one I'd buy regularly."
"Drinkability- Pretty smooth and different tasting beer. Probably wouldn't try again, but I'm glad I did and would recommend it to those who like the smokeir type beers."
"Pours dark brown, almost black. A little head, good lacing though. Smells at first of some berries (elderberries I assume) but then there is a strong astringency from alcohol. Also, there is some malts present in the nose. Taste follows the smells, with some berriness in the background, some solid sweet licorice malts, and a strong astringency. It would be better if the alcohol was more incorporated into the brew. Overall, eh."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Best before Jun 2005. I hate to say I don't like this beer, but I do not. I would not recommend it and don't plan on having it again although I did not find enough flaws to rate it poorly."
"This is a great tasting beer. I was surprised by how large the flavor and body were - really impressed. Has a nice mix of dark roasted malts and a deep cordial fruit taste to compliment."
"Poured a dark solid brown, with ruby highlights and a tan coloured head. Aroma of berries, burnt coffee and slight alcohol. Taste was certainly distinctive. I expected a fruity beer, but this was it at all. It was dark, roasted coffee with a pleasant berry flavour that accompanies the bitterness. Excellent balance, great creamy mouthfeel. A unique ale. Recommended."
"Dark, rootbeery brown and pitch dark. Thick beige ring of head at the edges with a thin dusting swirling through across the top. Strong burgundy/port scent with dark berries. With that scent I really expected to get a sweet/sour flavor, but this is more of a dry and dark flavor. Dry house red wine, with a bit of black coffee in the aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel with low carbination. Maybe a hint of chocolate in the after-taste. Decent drinkablity due to the low carbination. Ok flavor, but not one I will be going back to again."
"Overall, enjoyable enough."
"M.F./Drinkability- This has that nice roasted feel on the palate. This goes down incredably easy, and is something I will want to drink many, many more times in my life. The only downside is that this style very filling. In my opinion this is a world class brew."
"This is one hell of a good beer. It pours a near opaque black with a vanishing head and no lace to speak of. The aroma is of roasted cereals, chocolate malts, and a subtle berry fruityness. The taste is an excellent blend of roasted barley and thick malts and dark berry notes. Its like a fruit stout. The hop rate is low but good. The mouthfeel is chewy and thick with low carbonation. This finish is an excellent blend of black malts, hops and an understated berry flavor. The fruit isnt overpowering at all, and very natural tasting. A great beer from a very cool brewery."
"Ink black appearance. Bubbly, yet thin, brown head. Lacing is better than average and the retention is adequate. Thick roasted aroma mixes with berries nicely. Char and burnt malt is evident on the nose. Mouthfeel is low on carbonation and body. Only slightly spritzy, barely noticeable. The taste is pleasant though. Blackened malts, char and burnt toast combine nicely with the dark berry characteristic. Pretty enjoyable. Worth a try."
"A taste thats difficult to describe. Muted fruitiness, oat flavours, & some roast grain. Medium bodied, light carbonation."
"I like Ebulum Elderberry Black much more than I thought I would. This is no pansy fruit beer, but is a bold, sweet-spicy, darkly fruity concoction that pushes my buttons and makes me say 'hell yeah'. If I ever decide to become a Druid, this will be my official daily quaff."
"Pours as black as night, small tan head dissipates quickly, leaving only a ring of bubbles around the top of my gobblet. Smell is a sour berry and hops scent, a little coffee-like. Taste is again very sour, probably due to the elderberries (I don't have a clue what an elderberry is supposed to taste like). Definietely a sipper, not seessionable at all. Still, not bad, I don't know about the whole elderberry concept..."
"Not a particularly strong fruit presence, but one that very nicely accents the porter qualities - a very nice little beer."
"Nice sipper of a beer, quite complex..not a session ale by anymeans."
"This would be a good compliment to a cooler evening where stouts and porters are being served. In fact, if you don't normally like the more robust stouts you might enjoy this, as it seems to take on the best characteristics of a fine stout without some of the harshness/bitterness of the style. Slainte!"
"A good beer to have on a nice warm evening kicking back watching the sun set."
"The pour is jet black. The beer does not offer much in the way of head, but proffers elegant lace throughout. Aromas are of roasted malt, mocha, and some fruity/berry notes as well. The mouthfeel is nice-medium to full bodied with a velvety texture-some-what slick in the mouth. Flavors fight between fruit and grain. I pick up loads of roasted goodness, and I pick up a kiss of tangy berry, and fruit tannin with each taste. This is an interesting drink. Perhaps this would be interesting to try with wild game dishes-boar, venison etc?"
"Pretty cool."
"Thanks"
"Deep and solid black liquid pours from the bottle with a thin tan head. The head doesnt last long, but leaves small tufts of foam clinging to the glass. The aroma is an unrestrained mix malt and fruit. The berry in the smell seems mis-placed at first, but as you start drinking the beer, it settles into a very nice harmony. The smell is hints at a sweeter beer than actually follows. The taste is dry, grainy, and full of roasted malts. Berry flavor is folded very nicely into every aspect of the beer. They did a great job of matching the sensations. Rich and complex with medium body. Mildly oily. Finish is dry and somewhat bitter, but has a nice berry follow-through. Nicely done."
"Not a bad fruit beer. Poured black with a very little head. Smell was distinctly malty and fruity, very pleasant. Taste was almost wine-like, with an alcohol presence, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel was a bit astringent which took away from the overall experience IMO. Drinkability was certainly passable, though you don't want to guzzle for sure."
"Although the flavor is not very juicey, the mouthfeel is extremely juicey."
"Combining toasted grain and berries must be difficult. One may easily overwhelm the other. I've smelled $50 Merlots that didn't have this much poise and sophistication. Chunky, brute surges of raw cocoa are decorated with flavors and aromas of deep, concentrated, pasty blackberry reduction. Gamy, wild and peppery attitude rises up from the dry, tightly organized palate. Very Scottish in the sense that it displays all of the coffee-tinged maltiness one expects from that country's ales. The berry fruit is strictly a condiment, but pure, natural and Good."
"Interesting beer experience."
"This beer is real, real dark, and leaves a scrummy brown lacing around the glass. Nice sweet, malty smell packs a punch. Eminently heavy hop finish balances the sweet roasted malts. I had no idea this was really made from elderberries and presumed it to be another Scotch dark ale. The 6.5% disappears in the rich taste."
"Drinkability&Notes: This beer had me scowling and looking at it repeatedly, I can't figure this one out. It's a fairly decent beer, it seems to pair pretty well with the chunk of extra sharp cheddar I was munching on. Not as good as a Bell's Cherry Stout, and a SA cherry wheat kicks the tail outa this one, but it's a decent brew, and just the off-the-wall factor gives it a few points in my book."
"Pours a deep chocolate color with no head retention. A smooth aroma wafts strongly of berry and a perfume of floral and chocolate tones. The body is smooth as is the malt flavor with deep hints of chocolate and potpourri. The berries finish the ale with a moderate bitterness. Very smooth and melded to be very tasty."
"This ale poured a very, very dark, almost opaque black with hints of red-brown near the edges with thin tan foam. The smell was mildly malty with a faint, sweet berry aroma. The taste was slightly sweet and malty with a nice, blackberry-like flavor. Very well balanced, and not overly sweet or fruity. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low carbonation. There was a slight tartness and a lingering malty, fruity flavor. This was actually a very nice and enjoyable ale."
"Very nice offering for the style. Will be happy to meet this brew again."
"This is really some far out stuff. Pours deep black like a stout with a minimal tan head. Nose is lightly fruity and sweet, but also tart. The first thing you'll notice when you take a sip is just how damned smooth it is. Any crispness seems to take a couple of seconds to formulate. The first thing you'll taste is a lemony-berry flavor. Then will come the sweet malts. There seem to actually be some stout characteristics to the flavor of this beer - perhaps its the roasted and toasted malts and oats. The beer also has a real warming effect. This beer is really hard to describe - in many ways the tastes are subtle."

"Comments  Ive never eaten an elderberry before, so its difficult to say whether this ale is picking up the correct taste. It is supposedly a dark berry, so in this manner it is right on target. Strange, but well done."
"Tasted 4 February 2003 at Max's on Broadway in Baltimore, MD. The firkin had been broached for 24 hours and then served on the bar, at 50*F, open to atmosphere, and gravity-drawn."
"Black with a tan head, like a regular black ale. Roasted aroma with elderberries and a little peatiness. Light maltiness. Almost reminds me of A1 steak sauce, oddly enough. The flavors are lighter than I expected, but it's tasty. Definite berry flavors with roasted undertones and spices. The malt is grainy and cereal-like. This reminds me in a way of Sam Adams Old Fezziwig Ale or Winter Lager. Or should that be the other way around? Not a bad beer at all, seems like it should be a holiday seasonal with the spiciness and the berry flavors."
"Very cool bottle cap and I liked the Celtic symbols and design on the label that hint at some mysterious origins of this beer in the Scottish highlands. Very little head appears what's there is a nice tan color. Body of the beer is black, not much light passing through this one. I don't know what elderberries smell or taste like, but I'm hoping to find out. Not much berry smell here, I smell some sweet malts, hint of chocolate [?]. Taste is very nice, a slight tang at the beginning with strong roasted flavors in the middle (barley and malts), some oily hops on the finish and a barely noticeable tangy aftertaste. Unfortunately I still don't know what elderberries smell or taste like. I don't think that I would classify this as a fruit beer. It's a really good black ale though. Seems that I should be drinking this at a renaissance fair out of a leather pint glass after eating a giant turkey leg."
"Overall: Certainly different and unique, as most of the beers from Heather Ales are. I was hoping for more Elderberries to be honest, but this is still a nice change and quite a pleasant drinkable beer nevertheless. Worth trying, but not one that I would purposely seek out again."
"A nice dark brown, but clear brown color, with a light ring of foam for head which quickly fades. The aroma is nice and fruity with a sweet and lightly hopped smell. The flavor is sweet and fruity with nice mellow feel. Its maltly and flavorful with very little aftertaste but a slight bitterness towards the end of the drink. Overall a pretty good sipping beer."
"Overall Impression: Definitely an interesting one. Not quite sure if I like it. Tastes like it might be good for you (beer can be pretty good for you anyway, but this tastes like it). Not as good as their Alba Scots Pine or Heather Ale which are transcendant!"
"This is one interesting brew. Very dark which I liked to see. Had an aroma of roasted flavors and berries. Tastes of some roasted woody flavors, then a strong sweet fruitness came through (elderberries, i guess) and chocolate was also detected. The finish was very dry which I didn't care for in this brew. It still was a good sweet tasting beer."
"Pleasing aroma of chocolate taffy brings me back to childhood days spent at the Jersey shore. Chocolate also comes through in the flavor profile along with hints of dark fruit. Poured a black cherry in color with absolutely zero head. No bitterness was percieved. Surprising light bodied considering the color and malt profile in the mouth. Very nice!"
"very tasty indeed."
"Elderberry. I like the way it just rolls off my tongue. Drinking this would bring me closer to Monty Python, or so I assumed. Poured a dark black color, with barely a head. Hmmmm. Taste was slighty sweet with a somewhat fruity taste. I couldn't really detect the elderberry, but that didn't keep me from saying it over and over again, in an aweful English accent to the chagrin of my wife. Of course, she had to point out it was a Scottish Ale, thus ruining my mirth. Bullocks!"
"Not a great deal of aftertaste, but I do notice a touch of astringency or sourness, maybe from the fruit juice. Outside of that, it has a rather clean finish, something you won't experience much is a beer as dark as this. I could make a night out of these..."
"Black in color with just a thin halo of dark tan head. Fruit doesn't come through much in aroma -- smells mostly just like any other black ale, with roasty, grainy malt dominating. The flavor, though is a really nice blend of roasted maltiness at the start, and slightly sweet elderberry mid-palate. The malt takes on a chocolatey flavor midway through which compliments the elderberry extremely well. Fairly creamy, smooth in mouth. I was surprised how well I liked this beer."
"This beer pours the blackest of black beers with a slightly red tone around the edges, almost no head and no lacing. The aroma reminds me much of a dark wine with hints of alcohol overpowering slight hints of fruits. The taste is very sweet and tastes of berries, but the alcohol is very apparent as well. This beer is too sweet for my tastes and the alcohol is very poorly masked. This is not a bad beer at all but I don't see myself drinking it again."
"Pitch black with a ruby glow visible at the edge of the glass. Dark roasted malt aroma with a ghost of chocolate. An interesting interplay of slightly tart flavors intermingled with smoky malt. Raspberry-ish notes ring out softly at the finish. I've had berry flavored stouts before, but this is the first one that really seems to work. Very tasty and drinkability is quite good."
"Pours stout-like, not as thick though. Almost black, almost opaque. Aroma is kind of a sweet cocoa and coffee, pretty enjoyable. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I don't notice any elderberries, whatever they are. I taste mostly sweet maltiness and roastiness. It's an enjoyable flavor, but maybe not a beer I would get goosebumps for."
"Pours out very dark with a light brown head. The elderberry taste comes through well. The malts are well balanced and the hops are light but enough to further balance the brew. Certainly worth a tasting as dark fruity beers don't come around too often. This beer would go great with a cherry or blueberry pie."
"This beer was given to me by a fellow bar patron who did not know what she was getting into. It poured a dark brown, almost black with a white head that held at about 1 inch. Reminded me of a Guiness. A different smell I could not put my finger on, I guess the elderberry. Licorace, almost Sambuca like, faint coffee, roasted malts. Very smooth mouthfeel, creamy, and dry. I'm sure a very drinkable beer, if you like the flavor. Interesting, but one was enough for me."
"The beer pours an opaque brown with highlights of garnet, the head passable in size, frothy in consistency, light chocolate brown in color, as it evanesces it leaves behind a thick and clinging sheet of lace. Lightly roasted grains, also the aroma of lightly burnt coffee beans, sweet and different to be sure. Start is loaded with malt, sweet, the top middling in feel, with the finish sparingly acidic, the hops personable but not overly so, very dry aftertaste. Quite quaffable, good but not great and well worth a sample."
"Definitely a night cap for me. Can't imagine drinking more than one in a row."
"I really liked this beer. I had gotten it for my fiancee, because she likes sweeter beers, and I gave it a go. I was suprised in the way that they didn;t over sweeten the beer from it's alcoholy roots. They balanced everything very nicely. Good blackish/purple color to it in the glass. Had a nice semi-dry finish, but not too dry, so it went down nice and smooth."
"Murky black color. Head was a dense explosive, beige pillow. Huge bubbles pop through. One of the more impressive visual beers I have seen. Think Imperial strout on the sweet side. Huge head left a foamy ring all the way down the glass. The smells were a rich, sweet combination of roasted plums, raisans, and elderberries. The elderberry tasted like an earthy roasted blueberry to me. Nice combination of fruit and carbonation make for an very tasty beer. Dark, rich, complex and full of flavors but very light bodied and nearly bubbly. A beer deserving of your attention. Highly recommended and very memorable. I was really impressed by this. A one of a kind fruit beer !"
"hmmm...  this is great.   Pours an incredible black color, slight tinges of brown around the edges, but you've got to look for them.  The head is short-lived and also darker than most beers'.  First whiff brings in a sweet smokey roasted sort of order.  Following this up on the taste are an initial authentic elderberry tang, followed by the roast flavour, and finishing up a moment later is a aftertaste like that of actual elderberries.  Kind of syrupy feeling on the toungue with a light spritzing carbonation.  certainly drinkable, especially with the bittersweet aftertaste.  A winner!"
"Interesting history lesson, but I won't be studying it again any time soon."
"Black in color, and quite opaque. The head is tannish with what seems to be a pink tint. Unfortunately, the head is fairly limited and drops quickly, leaving an average collar and very limited lace. The aroma expresses a soft fruitiness which is quickly overshadowed by roasty notes. Very intriguing. The body is medium and the carbonation is light; giving it a soft creaminess in the mouth. The flavor starts a bit chocolatey, becoming a bit wine-like toward the finish, and leaves a lingering, lightly sweet and creamy berry flavor. Very nice, and quite unique. Well worth trying. Makes a great after dinner beer."
"Okay, this is the Heather Ale I been waiting to try.  Growing up on a farm, we had elderberrys and dishes made from them like pies, jams/jellies, crisp/crumble and of course wine.  So how does a beer version fair?  It poured out an amazingly dark color and had a dark tan head.  I had it at a warmeer temperature that may account for that.  Interesting aroma of malts and elderberry.  The taste definately had elements of Elderberry and chocolate.  A good dark beer."
"Notes: Eclectic and complex with a juicy sweet-tart fruitiness within, I’d put this in my dessert beer category and pair this one with chocolaty and / or fruity desserts. Certainly a specialty brew and nothing less."
"Black as black can be in color. Opaque even when held to light. Little to no head after a vigorous pour. Deep, dark roasted malt aroma with the slightest hint of berries. Taste is again dark roasted malt with a predominate coffee bitterness...surprisingly so since one might suspect a sweeter brew. Finishes smooth, bitter. 11.2oz. bottle, BB date: June 2003."
"This is a really good black ale. Subtle dark malt character. low bitterness and just a hint of elderberry at the end. In my opinion it need more berries. If you enjoyed other beers from this brewery you have to try this one. If you are not into Heather Ale Co. beers you may want to try it anyway as it is a nice balck ale."
