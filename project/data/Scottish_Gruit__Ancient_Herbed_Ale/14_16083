It's a little thin in body and in malt flavor. I'll admit that I hung onto this one for a bit longer than I should have. It tastes a little soured. Gotta wonder what the shelf life is on this without any hops to act as a preservative.","ryan1788a5","Nov 15, 2012"

3.38,-9.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: All in all, this is a decent brew. It's definitely interesting not having a hop balance in there. It leaves the beer very thick and heavy. I'm not sure if I will brew a Gruit after getting to try one, but as a home brewer, I may do it just for the challenge of using spices in place of hops. Try if you're looking for something different or interesting.","steve8robin","May 05, 2012"

If this becomes seasonal I'll probably try a bomber every year.","CheezyBlaster","Apr 30, 2012"

It doesn't try to overpower with bittering herb (like I accidentally did with wormwood on my last homebrew Gruit). I really like how the herbs play in, just the right amount that doesn't overpower the rest of the beer and destroy drinkability, but at the same time doesn't disappear into the background of the other flavors of the beer. The esters, fruit, banana/clove like from the yeast, add a nice touch as well for a tasty nice drinking Gruit. Very well done IMO!","jlindros","Apr 21, 2012"

4.05,8.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured out a cloudy medium brown beer, with a big thick white head, that dissapeared soon after being poured out. Smelled sour, citrusy, and herbal. The tastemimicks the nose, sour, citrus, herbs, with a touch of something bitter (licorice?).

4.1,9.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"The gruit is an interesting ale. It doesn't have hops in it, but still somehow manages to be delicious. Having only tried one gruit previously (Fraoch, from Scotland), I had an idea what I was getting into. The Weekapaug Gruit (named after a Phish song) was a bit better. It's a deep, dark black with almost no head. The aroma is hard to put a finger on - some caramel, a bit chamomile. It has a unique flavor as well. It's malty and somewhat sweet. It seem non-beer until the wheat and malt kick in. I enjoyed it quite a bit.","sloejams","Aug 10, 2006"
3.82,2.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"An interesting style and one most are probably unfamiliar with. I know I am not and I approached the beer with an open mind having little if nothing to compare it to. Alone, it was a good beer. Slightly alla dopplebock, slightly alla rauchbier; this is for sure an interesting an enjoyable beer. I would say I would not rush to find as many of these as possible and drink them, but I would not shy away from the style when it presents itself either.","Sycodrummer","Jul 14, 2006"
4.12,10.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer is fantastic, very authentic and for those looking for sort of a history lesson of "ancient herbed ales" this is the text book. It poured a dark brown that left a thin tan lace that quickly disappeared. The aroma is very floural(rosemary, wheat, grass), chocolate, flowers, very aromatic. The taste is surprisingly sweet upfront followed by bitter flower/tree bark balance (if you ever have the chance to eat edible flowers that is the bitterness I'm talking about). It is then finished with a nice malty honey base that is so pleasing. This beer is great, with the combination of belgian yeast and the the fresh herbal tastes this is a treat.","Franchise","Jul 04, 2006"
3.95,5.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"my third time sampling this style, and i must say that i am quite fond of it overall, though this gruit was, to me, less adventerous and more watered down than heavyweight's two druids. it pours a light brown/amber-ish colour with a faint but sticky head. the smell is has an herbal tea feel to it, combined with some spice, fruit (sour apple or lemon, perhaps) and malt. the flavour is quite similar to the smell, with a slight sour flavour combined with a touch of ginger running throughout. the finish is tart and a touch sweet. this is definitely a different style that may take some getting used to. but i found this brew to be quite refreshing and tasty and very easy to drink overall.","SixpointJMH","Oct 24, 2004"
3.96,6.2,4,3,4,4,5,"Murky dark brown with small fuzzy patches on top that stay. Very floral and herbal aroma, with dandelions coming to mind over a toasty backdrop. Flavor is toasty caramel swamp-water with hints of rootbeer and a zing from an herb that is hard to place, but works well in the brew. Finish is just right in its compexity and lenth. Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth feel. Very smooth all around. Earthy. This is not as "different" as I was expecting, since the flavor focuses primarily on the malt. It was, however, infinitely drinkable and I enjoyed it very much.","waughbrew","Oct 11, 2004"
4.4,18,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Presents as a opaque belgian/dark ale in appearance, with little head [again I was having the sampler glasses on a lunch-break, so the light effervescense was probably hampered]. A light but pleasing herbal smell ('cus it's brewed with herbs [yarrow, gale, & rosemary] rather than hops). Sweet but not too malty and quite smooth. [heck of a lot more drinkable than the Benevolance...not that that wasn't fun, I just couldn't take more than a half-pint]. Very Good and downright excellent on a brisk autumn day!","brewhiker","Sep 29, 2004"

The mouthfeel was very dry and smooth and crisp with medium body and low carbonation. There was a citrusy feel and a malty, herbal aftertaste. This was a very interesting beer: nice and refreshing.","UncleJimbo","Feb 22, 2004"
