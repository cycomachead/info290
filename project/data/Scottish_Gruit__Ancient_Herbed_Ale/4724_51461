4.67,36.2,4.5,5,5,4,4,". I Had Heatherdale Ale at the GCBF in Victoria. It pours with a substantial but small amount of head.The carbonation is quite low making it light enough to drink a few. It has a light golden color to it. I was skeptical about this ale at first; heather flowers in a light ale did not seem to appealing. The smell was amazing thought; it had aromas of piney hops, a delicate malt aroma, and a flora smell that had a slight rose aroma to it. The taste was multi-layered and was delicate. The taste began with a smooth malt body which leads to a floral piney hop flavor which leads into the heather flowers. The flowers give it a natural almost sweet and sour taste to it that made the beer very unique and tasty. It's a shame it is only available at B Gardens, if you ever get a chance to try it go for it.","chumba526","Beers"
