3.44,-14.2,3.5,3.25,3.75,3,3.25,"The beer pours a clear dark brown with no head and a touch of sediment. The nose is tame with a caramel sweetness and no distinct herbal characteristics. The taste is a mellow brown ale, sweet raisins upfront, with a nondistinct lingering herbal finish. The herbal flavors are slightly tomato-y with a slowly building, lingering, tangy, metallic finish. The beer is light-medium bodied characterized as being sweet, weakly herbal, drinkable, and completely uncarbonated. There is very little bitterness. This is a drinkable gruit, but I would have liked to try it fresh as the carbonation and herbal pop were both missing.","ThePorterSorter","Oct 21, 2012"
4.46,11.2,4.5,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.5,"I had this beer before and remembered it to be good, but in fact it is really good, excellent. I usually criticize the Jopen brewery for having too many different types that are all somehow special but not really balanced and just not great. However, with this recipe from 1407 they are doing everything right","safaricook","Oct 14, 2012"
3.94,-1.7,3,4,4,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 18IC bottle code. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish brown color with a 2 finger foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lace. No lacing at all on the glass. Aromas of apple skin, pear, caramel, raisin, molasses, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, earth, anise, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and interesting aromas with good balance and complexity. Really wasn’t sure what to expect. Taste of big apple, pear, pepper, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, herbal, floral, earth, clove, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruit, raisin, caramel, molasses, pepper, herbal, toast, earth, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and flavor complexity; good malt/spice balance; almost zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly slick, prickly, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial gruit ale. This was very interesting and I wasn’t sure what to expect from it. There is nice flavor complexity and balance; and it is quite smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable and unique offering.","superspak","Beers"

3.48,-13.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Bottle was a gusher and lost about 40%. Poured with large (!) tan head and good lace. Color is a hazy medium amber.

Much better than the other Italian Chestnut beer I just had. But that's not saying a lot.","drpimento","Jul 31, 2009"

4.15,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Nice gruit from Jopen. Pours a rich mahogany with a tna head. Nose has a nice collection of herbs along with nutty malts.

4.12,2.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"3.5 M&3 D: slightly stimulating initially but overall quite smooth; the body is too thin and flavour too simple and timid compared with the promising aroma. I wonder if it's meant to be like this, and perhaps that it's nearing the BB date has to do with the lack of spicy intervention on the palate and in the aftertaste? It's an interesting brew all the same, though my curiosity and interest stops with this bottle (at 2.5pounds a bottle!!)...","wl0307","Sep 06, 2008"

4.17,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The taste is of caramel/toffee with spicy earthy bitterness (and without hops!) Anise, nutmeg, cinnamon spiciness blends so well and mesh with the toffeeish malt, yet stops short of being over-spiced, and allows the maltiness to dominate, but in a balanced way. Alcohol is not noticeable in taste, though becomes quite warming after half-way through the 750 bottle. Earthy, complex, yet not overwhelming, with a nice maltiness. It has a creamy, medium to full body. Drinks dangerously smoothly, though slows down to a very sippable sipper! This is unique, interesting, and well-done!","jwc215","Jun 28, 2008"

3.67,-8.5,4,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Taste is of alcohol (not well-hidden), some sense of dark sweet fruity malt, and a peripheral taste of the cinnamon from the nose. Aside from the alcohol, a very enjoyable beer, but the 8.5% should be better masked.","dogfooddog","Sep 15, 2006"

3.58,-10.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Wine colour with a little lace. Light mouthfeel. Aged past expiry by eight months, and still quite drinkable, and likely mellowed. Tough cork to remove.

Malt and alcohol on the front..belnding into a lightly biiter finish. Mouthfeel is suprising light for the high abv. Very easy on the drinkability scale, considering the high abv also.

Surprisingly cerealic aroma, like sweet wheat or oat cereals with a touch of brown sugar, accompanied with clove spiced toasted bread. On the tongue, the same show keeps on with that buckwheat pancakes alike malt worthy of praise. Very bready, incredibly well-hidden alcohol. Great alcohol hiding. Subtle yeast component. Fading balancing leafy bitterness. Medium body fits well. Well built.","Rastacouere","May 10, 2004"

4.29,7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"After this beer was passed over several times, it finally hit the basket for the ride home. Poured from a 750 ml bottle, it's a murky reddish-brown with an off-white head that disappears almost immediately. It's not the most inviting looking beer in the world. However, its modest appearance is more than made up for by the smell and taste. Gentle fruity smells are backed up by a very nice herbal/spice smell. The taste strikes an intriguing balance of fruity sweetness and medicinal herbs. The 8.5% abv isn't immediately apparent in the taste, but a pleasant and slowly developing warmth announces the alcohol's presence. It's not an everyday beer, but it certainly is worth a try. History in bottle.","mickeymac","Apr 06, 2004"
3.75,-6.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours a deep, clear, amber-garnet color and it is topped by a thick light brown head. Aromas of crystal malt, dark fruit (cherry and raisin are most evident), hint of alcohol, candied fruit, and allspice. This beer has a rich creamy mouthfeel to it. The candied fruit is in the taste as well, but this beer is not overly sweet for it. The gruit herbs/spices are quite muted, I can't pick out any individual contributions. There is no real balancing bitterness here, though there is perhaps a light astringency in the finish. This is predominantly a fruity tasting beer, it tastes like a cross between a fruit cake and a spice cake. This would be an appropriate beer for a cold winter evening.","Gueuzedude","Mar 18, 2004"

It finishes with a peppery dryness. I really liked this gruit. It is not the first hopless beer that I have tried, but it is one of my favorites. It is excellent for a cold winter night.","ark57","Jan 04, 2004"

4.02,0.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Beer poured with a tan, rocky head that resembled hardened, molded foam. The beer itself was cloudy and reddish amber. The nose consisted of fresh granny smith apples, but in a dusty cellar kind of way. Some brambly berries emerge, both in flavor and tartness, as the beer warms. The alcohol becomes apparent, too. It certainly was herbal in a wonderful kind of way. Nothing too over-the-top like once could easlity imagine a gruit being. Bready malt, slightly fruity, and a little toasty with a tea-like quality on the finish.","yen157","Sep 19, 2003"

3.9,-2.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"A very different beer this is enjoyable nonetheless. From the start to the finish this very different in taste and aroma. The look is dark thick amber with a nice tan head and lacing. The sweetness is balanced here by the fruity spices which appear in the nose as well. Cherry sourness, or rather, tartness seems to play off the maltiness in a way that limts the malt power. The feel is different and a bit hard to describe, but good just the same. Limited drinkability, I believe this to be an infrequent sipping beer, perhaps nicely paired with a dessert dish.","AtLagerHeads","Beers"
4.4,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,5,"This is a gruit, brewed without hops. It relies on herbs and spices to balance the sweetness of the malt. Cloudy. Brownish in color with a very fine and creamy 1/4" tan head that holds very, very well and leaves some good lace. The body is medium with a very fine effervescence that makes it quite soft in the mouth. The aroma is fairly full with dark fruit, cherries, tartness, a lightly peppery spiciness, soft caramel maltiness, and some herbal qualities that I can't readily define. The herbs do give a drying quality and the beer is well rounded. Some fruity & herbal maltiness lingers in the finish, but it's not sticky as the tartness balances it. The alcohol is well hidden, only emerging toward the end of the serving. A very unique, interesting, and rewarding beer. Quite enjoyable. Much more balanced and mellow than I'd expected. Absolutely worth trying.","NeroFiddled","0"
