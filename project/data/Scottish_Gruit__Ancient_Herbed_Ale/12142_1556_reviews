"O: Excellent brew. Love the bottle, style, and name. Seaweed lover myself living in Asia, the idea of a Kelp beer doesn’t bother me. The kelp is really in the background, and the flavor of this stout like beer is great."

"O: pretty good, well made, but could be more interesting... the brawny chocolate malt muscle is laid out, just pile on the seaweed - dry weed it, even - it has an interesting, distinct, somewhat umami quality that should be exploited and abused... could be a little more salty, maybe... I enjoy and advocate balance, but make this a little manlier, huh?"

"Pours a dark brown with a small head. Some lacing on the surface. Smell is very mild caramel malt. Taste is primarily a rounded caramel malt. Low sweetness. Underneath, but still fairly prominent, is what must be the seaweed. It's unlike anything I've ever had. Not at all unpleasant. Tastes like the ocean. Not salty at all... but then again, maybe there is a hint of it. Minerals. Makes me want to reread Innsmouth by Lovecraft- this is probably what they were drinking there. Or maybe rewatch the Wicker Man (the original). Low carbonation. Medium to light bodied. I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts in this case. Maybe this is just good and not great, but it's a must try all the same."

"O: first time for a Scottish gruit brew, interesting flavor, would drink again, easy drinking dark ale"

"I rank this ""Must try!"""

"O: Creativity in brewing is only a virtue when the result is enjoyable. This one tastes like an experiment, needing a few more attempts and adjustments to get it right."

"O- Swing and a miss."
""
""

"The flavor is lightly roasty, slightly bitter, a little bit herbal, all nicely balanced into a very palatable beverage. This was a cool treat."
""
""
"Overall: This is an old acquaintance, one of the Scottish druid / ancient recipe ales that I quite like. For me, they deserve points for originality (even if the recipes are ancient!). Many contemporary attempts at herbed or spiced ales don't produce similar results."

"There it is... my personal breakdown of this somewhat mediocre beer. At least in this advocate's eyes."
""
""
"A rather poor beer for me here, it was far too light on the nose and tasted with a cheap stout mixed with salt water. Nothing about this one really appealed to me and it won't be one I'll have again."
""
""
""
"O: kind of a novelty to have seaweed flavored beer, interesting revival of an old style, an average beer overall"
""
"Final Thoughts: An exceptionally well done beer that leaves me asking, why don't more brewers use various herbs in their beer? I can only guess that it's probably hard to get the right balance, however this brewery seems to have nailed it. You really can't go wrong with any of the beers in their Historic Ales of Scotland pack, and if you haven't given them a try and are still reading this, take this advice and seek it out."
""
""
"Taste is sweet and roasty, like a good session-worthy porter, and with a light body. There's a slight brininess in there, but it's quite subtle, as the chocolate maltiness and dark roasty qualities come to the fore. A solid and enjoyable ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, deep, ruby highlighted dark brown coloring with no head. Aromas of toffee and nut, with some earthy highlights. The nose leans towards a malt bomb of a beer. We shall see. Flavors are a bit more earthy than the nose lets on, with a rich, nut and toffee sweetness forming the backbone. Green, gritty highlights and a touch of brine keeps the brew somewhat light despite the heavy malt characteristics. Smooth and clean in mouth, the beer has a slightly tangy sweet and roasted aftertaste. Light, clean finish. Heavy flavors for such a light ABV, making this surprisingly drinkable."
""

"Interesting, but not overly exciting. I'd suggest only trying this if you are intrigued by the seaweed ingredient. Otherwise there is not much value to this beer."
"The beer pours a dark, dark brown that is pretty much black chocolate. There is a nice but uneven finger width head the color of cream with a hint of coffee. The head dwindles down to a slight half-finger width and slowly dissipates leaving a thin outlining of lacing. There does seem to be some good carbonation hiding in the blackness of this beer. The beer smells rich with chocolate malts and salt with an oh-so-slight brine tingle. The beer tastes slightly smoky with peat malts and chocolate. There is also a definite oceanic tint to this beers flavor with slight hints of salt and I assume the seaweed. It is a very interesting taste and actually quite pleasant, like a sea salt chocolate beer. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery, mildly reminiscent of the ocean, though that may be because I am thinking seaweed… While its thinness is a little disappointing, it makes the drink quite drinkable. The after taste leaves a weird lightly brine-like taste while leaving the mouth clean yet slimy, if that makes any sense. Overall this is not a terrible beer. The mouthfeel is definitely off but the taste is unique and refreshing which definitely makes up for it. It is more of a sipper than other beers though, despite its weak mouthfeel. This beer is worth a try if for nothing else than the fact that it has seaweed in it which is weird and different."
"An unusual brew, but goes down nicely. Could be described as oyster stout for vegetarians. The aroma has a distinct chocolate note that is rather pleasing, while the flavour is balanced but a tad less substantial. Lies somewhere between a brown ale and a porter, with plenty of dark malt character. The seaweed doesn't exactly come through, but it possesses a mild salty twist. Tasty, and well worth trying."

"This beer pouts out brown with a small, off-white head. The aroma is rich with caramel malts and chocolate. The taste isn't nearly as strange as I expected, this is just a solid English style brown with just a bit of salt on the end, probably from the seaweed. It's a robustly malty ale otherwise, with a touch of chocolate flavors that work well with the salt. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a solid brown ale made ever so slightly interesting with the touch of salt."
"O: I would never seek this beer out again, I find that the utter lack of body is incredibly off-putting, and the flavor is utterly nondescript. Just a boring, mediocre beer with no body."

"Overall: this beer really surprised me. To me, it is just a really wonderful porter. Whatever the seaweed is doing is right; given the chance, I could quaff flagons of this stuff."
"From the 500 ml. bottle stamped Aug 2012. Sampled on March 24, 2012. This is my 900th Beer Advocate review and I think I picked a pretty good one to celebrate it. The pour is a gorgeous dark ruby red brown with a moderate head. The aroma is wonderfully robust with dark smoky roasted malts, something akin to prunes, and something like molasses. It almost reminds me of a sweet porter. The body is medium to bold. The taste is also smoky goodness, a bit of chocolate, and a moderate bitterness."
"O - My girlfriend bought me this beer because it looked unique. The flavors are strange, but not unpleasant. It was worth trying, but I probably won't get it again."
""
"It was cool to see this in the Scottish Ales sampler instead of Grozet. Pours a clear dark mahogany with a whispy short lived head that musters a good amount of lace. The aroma is malty and nearly smokey with a good amount of sea air. The taste is of chocolate malts, roasted malts, chicory and some faint salt in the back. I cant detect any specific 'seaweed' flavors. Hops are quite restrained. The mouthfeel is relatively light with a prickly carbonation."
"Overall- A pretty good beer, seaweed may be more of a marketing tool than anything else, but the backbone is a good brown ale."
"Easy to drink & not quite like any other beer I've had"
""
""
""
""
"I would definitely be interested in trying this on tap. This would be a great ale to consume with good pub food."
""
""
"O – A tasty easy drinking beer that I am glad I tried, just don’t think I’ll be buying it again 3.5"
"O - Not a great beer but not the worst. I don't get anything out of the seaweed being there at all. If you gave me this beer I'd be hard pressed to figure out what it is supposed to be, let alone that there is seaweed in here."
""
""
"O: A good session beer. Definitely something unique; since I have not had a traditional version of this in Scotland, I have no basis for comparison when judging how true to style this beer is. Fun and easy to drink. I would have this beer again if offered."
""
"Pours out a deep dark brown in color which almost passes for black until you hold it up to the light for closer inspection. Two finger head is a creamy tan color and has solid retention but very little lacing left behind. On top of a roasted porter-like malt scent is an odd kind of clean salty brine smell that has absolutely no fishiness whatsoever to it. Flavor is once again like a weaker porter, well balanced with mild hopping on top of a roasted barley foundation, but it also has the slightly thicker umami feel that I have experienced from seaweed soup at a Japanese restaurant, only none of the seaweed flavor....Honestly I was bracing myself expecting to taste and/or smell seaweed and feel strangely disappointed. The seaweed really does just come across as a slightly heavier fuller body and a mild whiff of sea breeze. Otherwise, a fairly nice mild porter."
""
"Overall: it's a solid, interesting beer. It's a little pricey for what it is, though. I got it for $4.50 for a 16.9 oz bottle."
""
"All around a good beer, drank this first in a sampler of different scottish ales that was put out by williams brothers... I assumed it would probably not taste very good and would be a novelty ale, I was quite pleasant. It appeared dark, had a sort of smokey taste to it with a hint of spice. The barley flavor was the most noticeable element of this brew. It had a very full flavor too, and was not watery at all like some beers in this category. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was a fave, but I wouldn't pass it up if offered one again."
""
""
"Wary stomachs be not alarmed. Adventurous palates likely be disappointed. The Williams Brothers have made very original material from very unoriginal parts. It is an undeniably enjoyable ale and, to be fair, slightly distinguished but apart from the novelty aspect I can't see much other reason to lay the money down on this one. Maybe pass."
"O: A very unique and complex beer. Definitely worth trying to the complexities of the flavors."
""
"Overall a good beer with a slightly drifrent but good taste would buy agian prolly a case for sure"
"Overall a very nice beer, would make a decent session beer."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Well, I haven't had any other Seaweed Ales to compare this to, but this isn't as good as the Elderberry Ale that came in the mixed 4 pack IMO. Worth a try though. It's pretty easy to drink."
"Didn't get any seaweed notes. The malts are nice but are very mellow and a bit watered down."
"O: I didn't know what to expect going into this ale, but it definitely had a unique quality. I think maybe it should be renamed, to ""Chocolate Seaweed Ale"" ... but then that might confuse people. Overall, not bad."
"A quite OK beer, the missing hops are nearly not noticed."
"Overall: Just a thinnish, light alcohol porter is what you're getting here. For having the word SEAWEED plastered across the bottle, I kind of wished they'd have really let me have it with seaweed taste, but, hey, that dried seaweed stuff ain't exactly cheap and in today's global economy, well..."
"O: Didn't expect to like this one, but I did. I don't see myself getting this again because I've only seen it in the packs. Even if it was sold in singles, I probably would only drink 1-2 of these at a time."
"Best before date indicated is Nov. 2011. Into a snifter on 6.16.11 this pours the darkest brown color (practically black) under a persistent frothy tan head. Aroma is inviting with notes of deep earthy sweet dark chocolate malt, fresh oatmeal, and a significant milky note to complement. Smells like a more intense version of a chocolate milk. The general feel and taste on the palate is quite different that what the nose indicates. Deep roasted malt character is clearly present but mellowed out by the herbal (Seaweed?) and perhaps hop character that runs a smooth and lightly crisp agenda from start to finish with ending notes of dry cocoa and very lightly salted nuts. With a 4.4 % abv and an overall mild profile, this seems like it would be a great session brew."
"Medium bodied medium-dark ale with very little hops presence and just a hint of sea salt and ocean breeze from the seaweed. These brewers from Alloa are doing wonderful things: look out Brew Dogs! You've got competition!"
"Taste isn't bad at all. It's not outstanding either. If it had more of coffee or chocolate or roasted malt this would be a darn good porter. But it falls a bit short on all. Seaweed? Not sure. It does have a pinch of salt, which makes the coffee/chocolate stop short. Not sure what the kelp does to this beer. Oh well, it's still a good beer"
"The beer feels refreshing, but it seems that the addition of seaweeds did not improve the flavor in any way."
"This took all I had to try this brew. I was just hoping that this didn't actually taste like seaweed. The beer didn't taste like seaweed thankfully. That has the flavors of a good some faint chocolate in the mix along with the malts they've used in it. The mouthfeel was medium and pretty smooth too. The aroma of the been had a slight smell of ocean to me but mostly malts, hops and other traditional smells were coming off this one. The beer is not bad at all, I just don't see myself having it again anytime soon."
"Overall: I'd recommend this for sure, it's an interesting recipe with some pretty solid results."
"Conclusion: it was interesting. The mineral aspect seemed to make this distinctive. I'm glad I bought it, but I don't think I'll buy it again. This was a one-time only beer for me."
"D - All in all this is an interesting beer. Nice malty flavours with that slight salty addition. This is quite unique. I dig the seaweed in this, though maybe want it pushed a bit more with even more seaweed power!"
"Mashed in with bladderwrack seaweed, which is know for its unique flavor and supposed medicinal qualities. Dark, let's call it black... impressive lacing to say the least. Sweet treacle maltiness with a faint ocean saltiness in the nose. Smooth and wet with a delicate, moderately sized body. Small hop character is there to balance and nothing else. Dry toasted malt flavor seems to play the same tune but at least sticks to the palate. A bit of earthy yeast and vague fruit in the dry and lightly salty finish. A great example of what an extreme beer can be; dark ale with seaweed, BAM! Extreme! Aside from that, this ends up being a great session ale that lands outside of the box."
"O: This is something I have been looking forward to trying, and am really glad I finally got a chance to split one of these with my Pops. Having said that, I respect what is going on here and truly appreciate how different it is, but I can't say it is something I'll go back to. Give it a spin though, as I can't think of another beer quite like it."
"Pours a dark dark brown with a little crimson hiding in there. No head/lace to speak of. Aroma is a nutty cocoa flavor and reminds me of a chocolate porter. But that roastiness disappears when I take a sip. Mouthfeel is very very thin and not as chocolatey as the nose would suggest. I guess I can't hate on this beer too much, if indeed it is authentically brewed to style and tastes like it's supposed to. I just don't understand why you'd make a big deal about the seaweed if it's completely undetectable. All in all I wasn't impressed."
"The beer poured very dark with a poor head and lacing. The smell was mostly chocolate malts with perhaps a slight spiciness to it. It tasted like an English stout. Nice toasty chocolate character. The feel of the beer was very wet and watery. The beer had lots of flavour and it went down very easily. It was quite drinkable, but I paid for the novelty of the beer and was let down."
"D: The smell and taste of seaweed is very mild, which makes this beer rather drinkable. I would definitely try this again because it is a unique beer."
"D-to my surprise i enjoyed drinking every ounce of this beer. it seemed to get more friendly towards the bottom of the bottle. maybe the less desirable flavors started to mesh out. the low abv makes this a great drinker."
"16.9oz bottle with a Best Before Date of FEB 2012. $4.29. Here goes nothing...Pours about as dark a color I've seen on a beer in a long time. Basically black with a thin head. Some lacing. Smells like roasted malts, earthiness, and a bit salty. Surprisingly for being a ""seaweed ale"" this brew does not taste like Poseidon's beard. Almost takes like a porter. Somewhat smokey with some roasted malt flavors. A bit chocolatey. Not what I expected. Like I said before, it tastes like a low ABV porter. Not bad."
"Such a dark brown that it could pass for black. There are some mahogany highlights visible when held directly to light. About a finger of thick tan head that dropped to just a cover over the top of the brew but stayed throughout. The aroma is earthy and nutty. There's also chocolate and a mossy kinda briny note. Maybe I'm just adding this subconsciously, but to me, it was there. Taste is rich bitter chocolate up front with slight burnt sugar and roasted nuts. There's a smoky/briny note in the flavor as well, but it comes across more in the after taste than during the drink. Really creamy feel and very easy to drink. I had no idea what to expect from this, but it certainly exceeded the feeble expectations I had for it."
"Overall an ok beer but it doesn't have that interesting of a taste and the carbonation is too high."
"Drinkability: This reminds me of a weak English porter overall. If you were to put this in front of me and not tell me where it was from and what bottle you poured it from, I'd think it was an English porter and not a beer with seaweed mashed in. Went okay with a meal and I think it would be fine by itself as well. Overall okay but I think my favorite by this company is the Alba Scotch Pine ale."
"Drinkability: I suppose this is almost good but it doesn't quite hit the spot for me. The burnt flavor doesn't suit me. This beer really does seem like a porter and one that is just a bit above average."
"D - Overall not a bad brew. Defiantly a great Scottish craft beer and kind of high on the weird scale but it didn't deliver enough bang for my buck to bring me back. Also the 500ml instead of a 12oz is kind of a chore to drink for such a distinct beer so it was sort of novelty. Would pass on future purchases."
"D - you could drink this whole playing cards. The carbonatiom would get annoying though."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of coffee. Taste is good, malts and coffee, maybe a touch of chocolate. Feels full bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality brew."
"D - Quite an unusual beer and recommended"
"Drinkability - Easy drinking. Smooth beer with much more flavor than most 4.4% beers."
"Slainte!"
"I approached this beer expecting it to be hard to finish. I mean, really, seaweed beer? This actually was a pretty good beer. If anything, I didn't pick up enough seaweed. I would've liked to have the seaweed been a little more prominent in the brew."
"500 ml bottle, best before May 2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a brown color with a half inch light tan head. Not much head retention, but there is a lot of lacing. Aroma is peat, earth, chocolate, and a bit of salt and seaweed. It really does have an aroma that reminds me of being by the sea or lake. It tastes like chocolate, salt/brine, earth, nuts, and some roasted malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, but not watery at all. It also has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think it's a decent overall brew. For a brew that's only 4.4%, it has a lot of flavor and wouldn't be a bad session beer on occasion. Worth a try, but I don't think I'd buy this very often."
"This really is a good beer. Easy to drink, nice flavor and that unique chocolate/salty thing works very well."
"Notes: Really unique beer. Wasn't sure what to expect with this. Not too much seaweed flavor really, just some brine and soil-like flavor. A little disappointed as I would like to try a beer with seaweed front and center as far as taste, but this beer as it is isn't bad. A lot like a porter or stout with some interesting taste in the middle and at the end of the sip."
"D-this beer is certnly resfreshing but the seaweed can present a challenge to some people. overall its a beer i would enjoy a few of but would certanly not drink it all night"
"A brown ale edging towards old English stout, flinty and clean. But why talk up the seaweed then bury it in a dark beer? Definitely some salty twang, but nothing to get fussed about."
"D: Aside from the price this is a great session beer. A very enjoyable pint. Love these ancient ales that Cragmill is doing, I feel I'm in homage to my Celtic heritage when I drink them. A beer I'd love to have with oysters and a big seafood spread."
"Poured into a wheat type glass. Very deep dark brown with a tan head that slowly gives way to a thick film with minor lacing. An iron aroma to start and as it warms I did detect an oceany aroma. First sip is iron but after that I don't detect it. Hints of chocolate malt follow. Very well balanced and very mellow in taste. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would."
"d: i wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. i like the idea bt the flavor, etc. is just ok."
"Quite quaffable. Has a slight tickle at the back which is enjoyable, and flavour is subdued but balanced."
"Sorry guys, this just doesn't cut it for me - despite the uniqueness of the recipe, it doesn't have nearly enough on the palate, leaving it flaccid and weak. True, the main characters it has are dark grainy notes, but they exist in isolation with nothing else to back them up. Probably chuggable, but otherwise disappointing."
"Drinkability- Light enough to suck down but it gets worse as it goes"
"Beer has a lot of roast. Also beer is sweet. Beer is medium bodied and has a very small aftertaste. I don't really like this style of beer but this one was a great example of how to make a stout with ancient ingredients. There is no seaweed flavors or anything like that. A highly drinkable dark ale. Good job. Probably my favorite from this brewery so far."
"Overall it kind of tastes like an average porter that got steeped in a tiny bit of dulse with a pinch of salt."
"The palate is a little more traditional, porter-like with roasted malt, cocoa and burnt sugar with a nutty character. Unfortunately, the intensity of the flavors wash out the delicate seaweed character. This tastes mostly like an average English porter. Drying on the finish with a little bitterness and cocoa character, I'm going to attribute the mild green-ness I'm picking out to the power of suggestion. Light in body (almost watery) with a crisp carbonation, this beer is solid on the palate. The low ABV makes for one easy to drink beer too, one that I will revisit"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark mostly opaque brown color with a very thin light brown head. Aroma was very stout like, strong scent of burnt brown sugar with small amounts of mocha. Taste was like burnt oatmeal chocolate bread. Felt a bit thin and watery in the mouth, but not overly so. Not a bad beer to drink, but for some reason it begged to be a slow sipper, not sure why."
"Creamy and smooth up front with sweet chocolate center and a salty, spicy vegetable presence in the dry hoppy finish."
"For a light ABV this beer has some rich complexity: nicely carbonated and has nuances to ponder, making this a good session beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. It's a very dark brown color, nearly black. There is a small light brown head of tiny bubbles that does not stick to the glass. It's smells roasty and chocolatey, but also a hint of the sea. The taste has a flavor to it that reminds me of nori, the dried seaweed used in sushi. There is also a bit of bitter, roasted malt. There really isn't much of an aftertaste; it just disappears once you swallow. It has average carbonation and body. It feels a little creamy, moreso than I expected. This is a interesting beer. I imagine that most people, like myself, buy it because they are curious what a seaweed beer tastes like. The beer is of a high enough quality to make it more than a novelty. You could drink a few of these, but it's just not one that I would want to drink too often."
"D - For something with ""seaweed"" in the name, Kelpie is damn drinkable. I don't know that I'd sit back with more than one of these, but it's easy to get down and quite unoffensive. An interesting spin on a medium-dry stout/porter."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but not great. I could drink it again, but it's not something I'm going to run right out and buy again."
"While not the throatiest of dark beers, this seaweed brew is a little different, and very drinkable. Cheers!"
"2.5 did not think it would be so boring, or roast dominated."
"drinkability was ok but i would rather drink a real stout - this beer is a little to watery"
"This is an odd beer. More of a novelty than anything else. Worth a try, but nothing special."
"IF ANYONE HAS THIS BEER, PLEASE BEER MAIL ME!! I AM WILLING TO BARTER IN ORDER TO GET THIS BEER AGAIN!! I live in Ohio so Great Lakes, Thirsty Dog, and may even be able to venture to Penn. to get something if need be!"
"Sort of your typical porter, heavy on the chocolate flavors. It's a good porter on its own, even if it doesn't have any unique seaweed characteristics. Recommended."
"A most interesting beer this one and this brewery definately has a habit of producing interesting beers,this beer pours a coca cola colour with little carbonation and leaves a little head not even half a finger,when smelling this beer i can definately smell the sea with roasted malty backnotes quite interesting,it tastes just like a stout only lighter with a real unfull mouthfeel but definately quite smooth going down and suprisingly enough i quite like this ale ill definately be chasing down their other beers when i see them next."
"Due to a lack of glassware, I drank this out of a wine glass that was refilled several times. It has a lovely dark brown color, with little head and carbonation. The scent is rather unique, it reminds me greek olives, and a little bit of ocean air-- just the saltiness, I guess, though since its flavored with seaweed, that makes sense. The flavor is a lot like other darker beers-- not as rich as a barleywine or stout, but with a lot more flavor and weight than, say, Anchor Steam. I'm still not quite up to my beer knowledge to be able to pick everything out, but the flavor does have a little bit of bitterness to it, and in some ways reminds me of the brine of olives even-- though that might just be because of the scent. It felt nice in my mouth, a thick feel without too much carbonation, easy to drink. Its different, unique, and maybe not something I'd like a lot of in one sitting, but my one 500mL bottle? pretty nice serving size, especially since this particular booze is weaker than I typically drink. I wouldn't drink several in one night, but I would buy it again."
"D - I was surprised to detect very little character from the seaweed. This is by far the most drinkable of the gruits made by Heather Ale. Overall it comes across as a nice stout with an unusual, hard to identify earthy quality. A drinkable gruit, what a novelty!"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and dry. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This beer is very different. The seaweed is present but not over powering. It is a rather different beer but it is not too bad."
"Smells like ocean and tastes like ocean. Coming from a guy who loves the beach and beer, trust me you can skip this one. Just go to the beach and grab a Corona."
"Conclusion: This brewery just doesn't seem to know how to brew a bad beer. I mean, you see ""Seaweed Ale"" on a bottle and you're probably terrified; the mineral-y ocean like notes are very very mild, and under that is a fantastic dark ale that has complexity and drinkability written all over it. Good job to Heather Ale Ltd on another outstanding Scottish beer!"
"Final Thoughts - At $5 a bottle it is certainly worth trying. Beyond the initial unique experience, I don't see a point in revisiting this one."
"Overall - Not what I expected. If I had not read the label, I would not have appreciated the seaweed most likely. Good beer overall."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a deep, dark brown color with one-finger of tan head. The retention was pretty good, especially as a collar and the lacing was decent. The aroma was of roasted malt, a green mustiness (surely the seaweed, wild!), coffee and a light spiciness. The flavors were full of roasted malt, chocolate, light peat smoke, coffee, biscuity malt, a bit of saltiness, and a semi-bitter finish of hops. The aftertaste did indeed have seaweed in it and goddamn was it weird! It is to be noted I awarded rather than withdrew points for this weirdness due to the fact that it was supposed to taste like that. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation medium/light. Easy to drink and similar to an English Porter, only more herbal and, well, odd. But I totally think it's worth a try and did enjoy it."
"The beer is very intriguing, challenging, and surreal. The lack of hops make balance and complexity difficult. If you like the Scottish malty beers, then you'll find a lot of enjoyment here. By the way, I didn't get anything in the beer that even hinted at seaweed."
"T, M & D = Taste is very interesting, it tastes basically like a typical English style porter with the addition of a slightly sour, slightly salty but still slight chinese candy taste. There is a strong amount of bitterness past mid-palate. It coats the mouth decently but has a watery quality that starts mid-palate along with the appearance of the bitter, sour, salty tastes. Since it reminds me so much of a porter, I am having trouble deciding if I really like its differences or if it has problems meeting my expectations. I guess at the end of the day, I cannot mark it down for having some distinctive non-porter tastes, since it is intentionally an herbed beer. It is kind of weird though. I can see drinking this again and enjoying it, but it's not for quaffing."
"Overall I was expecting more. This to me is an average beer made with a different ingrediant"
"M&D: the palate is smooth enough but is always backed by decent carbonation to buttress the medium body, while in the end of each deep sip the palate does goes slightly thin, maybe due to the semi-sour aftertaste. Overall, this seaweed ale tastes really like a medium-bodied stout to me, with but a wee touch of sea-breezy saltiness at the tail. Pleasantly drinkable!"
"Not bad, but Black Cullin is a better example of this style of dark Scottish beer."
"D: Really surprised by this, brewed with actual seaweed in mash tun gives this a salty, beach like feel that is pulled off really nicely. Would definitely recommend for something different."
"this brew pours up a dark brown color with crimson edges and a big bubbly dark tan head. the nose is chocolate, peat, smokey aroma. the taste is subtle chocolate, earth, smokey, subtle salty flavor (due to the seaweed I assume). medium bodied, low carbo. A smoothe ale...."
"Good amount of flavour for the abv, and worth a try."
"Very drinkable, easy to down brew."
"I was looking forward to this one, and was a little let down."
"Pours the deepest of brown colors with an average dense tan colored head. The aroma is a very nice rich nutty/milk chocolate malt, though I am not picking up any seaweed like aromas. This is one malty beverage. Big nutty malt flavor, some milk chocolate and just a hint of sea salt or seaweed. This is one good malty brew, best out of the 4 pack. The feel is moderate, chewy yet drinks easy, finishes malty sweet and bitter. A real good malty brew that drinks easy with a 4.4%ABV all adds up to a brew that you can drink all night."
"Drinkability: Well worth a try. Excellent in the late fall/winter months. Could easily drink a 6-pack."
"Nothing to be intimidated by the unusual ingredient in this beer. Tastes a lot like a porter or stout. Nice low ABV for a robust flavored beer."
"At the end of the day, this is an okay beer. I feel ultimately disappointed. I was stoked try a beer brewed with seaweed, but it really has such a nominal effect that it goes virtually unnoticed. Bummer. For what it is, there's a number of other better beers, namely porters, that are preferable to this."
"Overall this is an interesting beer. I'd love to taste a version of this made without seaweed to see how much the seaweed contributes to the taste and mouthfeel. Worth a shot, most of all because there are not a whole lot of other beers that can claim to use seaweed in the brewing process."
"and only 4.4% alcohol by volume."
"Seaweed beer... interesting. Well it has a cola color with a light brown inch and a half tall head that recedes but sticks around for a little while. Smells lightly of roasted malt. Tastes again roasty, a bit of chocolate, hop/carbonation tingles a bit and finishes with a slightly salty, creamy, oily feeling with slight smoke/light coffee bitterness."
"very interesting. worth a try for the novelty factor alone."
"D- Easy to drink, would go good on a hot day despite the dark malts used."
"This is an easy-flowing ale. Very interesting. I'll definitely seek out another."
"i'm confused, did it improve with age or is this weird sea-beer actually good?"
"16.9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Best Before Feb 2009 etched on the label. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. The aroma is very similar to a porter with dark roasted malts and chocolate. The taste, like the aroma, features dark roasted malts and hints of chocolate and coffee, but comes across a little watered down. The mouthfeel, like the taste, comes across as being a little watery. Overall, Kelpie Seaweed Ale is a pretty decent beer, but there is nothing that really stands out to make me want to purchase again. I was expecting something to be different about this beer considering it was brewed with seaweed, but I really did not notice any effect."
"Earthy and smooth with a medium body. I'm getting a tad bit of salty notes, but not tasting any seaweed. It has more of a light porter characteristic, or a brown ale. The flavors are pretty cool, and it's tasting different whether I drink a little sip or a bigger mouthfull. A rather complex and interesting brew."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, it's certainly a unique beer and it's not too bad, but I'm not sure that I'd really want to drink it again."
"Drinkability- An excellent and unexpected beverage. Who would have thought seaweed? The Scottish, that's who."
"Pours out a deep, dark brown with some ruby-violet edges when held to the light. Head is like frothy cafe au lait and maintains very well. To me this is reminiscent of a solid stout/porter with good chocolate, roast, and fruity qualities. If I wasn't told this had kelp in it, I wouldn't notice probably although it does have a mineral thing going on. Flavor starts off with some roasted grain and light chocolate. In the middle there is that mineral presence again along with some raisin. Finishes very dry and with a touch of saltiness. Mouthfeel is rather light on the palate, but manages to not be thin. Very creamy feel to it. Really drinkable with the low abv and the refreshingly drying character it has."
"Eric"
"On a final note, approach this as you would a Schwarzbier, as its very dark but smooth and not that bitter."
"Drinkability : not very common beer, in the Scottish gruit style"
"Very dark brown - almost black, porter-like appearance with a very light tan head. Cream colored? Aromas of roasted malt, a faint hint of cocoa, and a dash of rum. Flavors of roasted malt, mildest cocoa, and a faint hint of salt (kelp?) between medium and full body with a roasty and oh-so-mildly seaweed finish. This could be a beverage for Scottish infants getting trained for future single malt scotch."
"All in all I was glad I revisted this beer and I would recommend it to Porter or Stout drinkers who are in search of somthing a little less filling with a twist to the brewing technique."
"Pours a dark brown that shows a little bit of light. No head. Roasted coffee nose with some brown sugar in there as well. Flavor is just the same. Like roasted coffee character. Not really getting any seaweed on here at all. Well bodied, but there is some minor aspect about it that seems a bit thin. Nice biting and pretty full carbonation. This is an easy drinker. Almost comes off like a porter."
"Opaque black/brown color.Small tan head diminished quickly. Roasty and iron-like flavors in foreground. Nice bitterness from roast malt and hops. Slight sourness/acidity present as well. Medium-bodied. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel despite low carbonation. Interesting beer."
"I didn't really know what to expect w/ the name ""seaweed ale"" but I was suprised. It tastes more like a porter or a bock than a scottish gruit. Very good over all, I would definatly recommend it to anyone."
"Worth a try for sure."
"Earthy, musty, and sweet. Reminded me of a quality schwarzbier. Dark roasted flavors bode well for the beer, but it never becomes too thick or heavy. Overall this is a very interesting beer that I would love to have again."
"D: Definitely not as bad as I thought it was gonna be. Fortunately the seaweed played a really mild roll. Beers a bit thin and could use some more body. OK but nothing special."
"Pours an excellent dark black color, very opaque. Has a good head and nice lacing (if a bit vertical). Great scent! A nice crisp and bold aroma with a great hint of seaweed. Great taste, too, crisp and clean as well, a nice balance of bitter and sweet, leaning towards the bitter side. Great hin of seaweed in the aftertaste, in a good way. Goes down fine, perhaps a bit on the rough side, but nothing out of the ordinary for this type of beer. It won't be my favorite, but it will be a nice change of pace occasionally."
"Recommended for novelty purposes only."
"D - I was sort of hoping the seaweed wasn't too strong but if someone poured you this you'd say it was a porter. Worth trying but nothing that makes it stand out."
"D: to astringent for more than the 1/2 bottle I shared."
"D- This beer has some dark malt flavors but the most memorable part is the watery texture, smell and taste. I was expecting some note of seaweed or something of interest. It does have some weak Bock notes but not enough to make me want another glass."
"Kelpie Seaweed Ale pours a very dark brown, almost black with a thick tan colored head from a brown 500 ml bottle. The aroma is mostly chocolate malt. The taste is a lot like a watered down stout, chocolate and coffee flavors are very noticeable, the mouthfeel would be a bit on the thin side for a stout however. I can't say the seaweed is noticeable in any way, but this is a very enjoyable beer. But for the price it would be a great session beer. Recommended."
"Overall, recommended. Would make for an interesting sessions beer - high flavor and low alcohol. Nice."
"Not just a novelty beer, this brew has enough going on in a good way to be worth trying. Due to its porter/stout like roastiness its certainly not going to appeal much to the BMC drinker, but this is an interesting ale that would have some appeal to those who like their beers dark, or are looking to get into darker brews. Glad i tried this one, and ill be drinking it again some day."
"The beer is a dark, rather flat, uncarbonated mixture with little head and no lacing or real retention. The smell is average, chocolatey or coffeeish and does have an alcohol tinge to it. The low ABV makes the smell a little deceiving on that score. The taste is very mellow, a bit watery, sweet, chocolate, raisin, coffee. The high point is the mouthfeel which is very smooth and very mellow. There are no real hops notes in this beer. It's all malt, some grassiness, and no real after taste. After the beer warms a bit, there is a very slight hop bitterness coming through at the very end. That something extra in the flavor is the seaweed, I assume, and if anything, perhaps the seaweed has an ameliorating effect that smooths out the mouthfeel and the aftertaste, but I'm making some assumptions here. The beer is interesting and worth exploring. L'Chaim."
"The beer is lightly sweet with a light fullness to it that belies the level of sweetness in this brew. The beer has notes of coffee in the finish, toasted grain, perhaps a touch of chocolate and a soft saltiness that could be from the malt, but I would hope was from the seaweed. The seaweed certainly does not leave a signature taste in this brew, or at least one that I can taste. This is actually a bit dissapointing for that reason."
"500 ml bottle, bought in Scarborough. ABV is 4.4%. Very dark reddish brown colour, nearly black. Moderate creamy tan head. Aroma of dark malts and something undefinable strange which I guess is the seaweed. Moderate carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. The flavour has moderate roasted malts and very moderate hops - and again (but this time very moderate) ""strange"" sidenotes which must be the seaweed. The beer is definitely drinkable, but Im still not convinced that adding seaweed as an ingredient in beer is a particularly brilliant idea."
"Has a very interesting aroma - malty and also salty. (Well, it is made with seaweed!) Beautiful deep, nearly opaque brown with a thick, tan head. Flavor is superb - rich, malty, with some sea tang and a hint of molasses. The finish is a little watery, but overall this is a very pleasant ale, smooth and distinctive."
"Notes: I tend to like this style. I've had maybe 10 ancient herbed ales and I can only remember one that I truly didn't like. The herbs and spices combine with some meaty malts to make this very interesting."
"500ml brown bottle from Ron's in Farmington. Dark brown/black opaque body with a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells chocolatey more than anything. Tastes like roasty chocolate with kind of an odd flavor I can't put my finger on with a bit of astringency. On the heavier side of medium-bodied. Tasty and complex, but not something I'd want everyday. Definitely glad I tried it though."
"Like I said, ""interesting", but in a good way. Certainly unique. Well-done, though I can't see having this with any regularity. But, enjoyable as a ""something different"" brew."
"Poured a nice dark black with a thin head that diminished to a ring and left slight lacing. The aroma was of chocolate and dark malts. The taste was truly unique, chocolate flavor with just a slight saltwater tinge to it. The beer was light and smooth. This was one I'm glad I tried and will probably have one or two more years down the line."
"Medium-bodied and very drinkable. Worth a try!"
"Overall: All in all, a must try for any beer enthusiast, but as a beer on its own it's nothing spectacular."
"Pretty, deep dark color. Not quite black but a very, very deep burgundy color. Nice-though somewhat subdued-robust aroma. Very hearty flavor-roasted but slightly peat-like. Somewhat salty tasting. Good mouthfeel. An extremely interesting beer. Very hearty and full for the low abv. Quite enjoyable."
"Pours jet black with a minimal tan, frothy head that dissipates quickly into a ring of lace. Big malty aroma with hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is malty, again with choclate and coffee flavors coming through as well, followed by a noticeable saltiness which I would guess is the result of the seaweed. The saltiness lingers on the palate for some time. A good if not somewhat odd brew."
"Pours very dark- surprisingly dark with nut much head. This looks more like a porter than an ale. What head there is fades pretty quickly. The smell is dark and roasty with some definite whisps of smoke,and some iodine in the finish. The taste is a little softer than you might expect, with gentle malt, chocolate, smoke, and a little saltiness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but supports the flavors fairly well. Interesting and subtle, a nice drink."
"D: Complex, drinkable and good."
"This one reminds me more of a stout or porter than anything else."
"The drinkability is somewhat lower, as this is not a beer that I would sip all night. I view this as a situational beer, which can provide wonderful enjoyment given the proper conditions."
"Overall - A pretty good beer... not something i'd drink all the time but certainly worth a try..."
"Overall, its everything I expected it to be. A dark brown ale ""hopped"" with seaweed. Very well done, albeit fairly light."
"Overall Impression: Very light bodied dark ale. To me it tasted like a watered down stout. Roasted character is distinct. A session beer for sure. Wouldn't run out and get another bottle anytime soon but well brewed."
"Poured deep black with a whispy white head, much like a porter. Had a salty, sea like smell, almost scotch whiskey-like with smoky overtones and just a hint of whiskey like aroma. Flavor has more roasted malt than I anticipated. Grainy, malty, very nutty flavor. Finish has a slightly oily and the wiht the nutty flavor that stays on the palate. I enjoyed its subtle chocolate flavors."
"A full-on Willy Wonka chocolate drink. It starts out very chocolatey and slowly dissolves into lesser amounts of cocoa with hints of caramel and miniscule amounts of salty plankton garflingus. Obviously it's malty and that's fine by me Ahab and should be by you too if you know and love the sea. I've seen reviews wishing it to be a stout, thicker and dense, but for an ale it is rather corpulent with all the right atmospheric qualities condusive toward multiple servings. Put the bottle to your ear and you'll swear that you hear the ocean in there calling you back home to Big Sur or to Carmel-by-the-Sea to become part of a neo-biblical Robinson Jeffers tragi-drama."
"Same notes in the aftertaste, with something dusty, and sweet cocoa."
"Brew pours to a dark brown color, almost black in color but it does allow some light to pass through. The head is of medium size and a light tan color, which breaks down quite rapidly but does leave some lacing around the sides of the glass. The aromas are of chocolate and smoked grains, more reminiscent of a nice porter than a so-called Scottish Gruit. Very nice smelling brew in actuality. The taste is very nice, chocolate malt, which tend to make it somewhat sweet. Has a nice hop finish, not much but enough to balance out the sweetness, while also noticing a salt lake flavor. Has a dry feel as well. Over all, I like this brew. I was thinking that it was a gimmick, could be I guess, as I am not sure where the seaweed is, but to me it seems like a nice brown ale or porter. I would get this again."
"Pours a dark brown with a fair tan head that dissipates quickly without much lacing. Smells a bit nutty, very slight carob, and definitely has this salty seaweed thing happening. This beer has a bit of acidic sourness to it, which i'm starting to enjoy more in more in the beers i find it. Also there's the carob again, slight chocolate and light, but dutiful hops. Everything's tinged by a slightly salty seaweed flavor(at least what i imagine to be). I like it and could tolerate a bit more. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, a tad thin with moderate to lighter carbonation. Nice beer, though i prefer the other two of theirs i've had prior."
"Good looking beer with nice complexity and really easy to drink at 4.4 % ABV."
"Aroma was roasted malt and something slightly sweet. No hops to speak of. Taste was reflective of above, a very mild brown ale. A hard to define, light sweet taste (seaweed?). An equally mild hop finish. Medium in body and carbonation, very refreshing. Out of date or not, an enjoyable ale, but there are better ones out there."
"I had this beer with spicy Mexican food and it went together fabulously. I was truly sorry to see the bottle drained to the last drop."
"As stated before, Kelpie is a tasty beast."
"Tastes chocolatey- deep, rich, not too sugary, roasted toasty flavors. A bit of biscuit going on, a hint of coffee. Delicious. Wish it was a biiiit deeper... but still very tasty. Mouthfeel is a bit smooth and creamy. Overall... a delicious brew. Surprisingly tasty. Thanks Jason!"
"""So this is the seaweed beer right?"" Asked the store clerk when I picked this bottle up...my only reply was ""yep."" Pours an almost completely black color with a large white/tan head that quickly became a very satisfying lacing to look at. Smell is quite interesting and nothing at all like i was expecting, very porter or stoutish with some roasted grains, malt, earty tones, a slight saltyness as well. Taste was quite nice as well, more roasted grains with some mild coffee and chocolate flavors coming through. Mouthfeel is light to medium...truly a very easy beer to drink. As for drinkability, the low alcohol content as well as the really nice flavors going on make this a beer that is more then worth having a few of, if only to see what new tastes and smells surface as it warms up a bit. Beers like this are the reason that I enjoy the stuff so much. Didn't really detect any strong seaweed in this beer, but what the hell, it still is a really fun offering to sample."
"(11.2 oz / 330 ml sleek brown Euro-style bottle)"
"The body is light and smooth. This is an easy-to-drink ale. It's a little light for my tastes, however."
"I can't really determine the effect of the seaweed, but this is a nice beer. Very sessionable."
"A very easy to drink beer that is really a Scottish ale in my book. Not nearly the unusual style that you might expect this to be. Nothing here but a quite good ale."
"D - I must say, I was intimidated by this beer at first, expecting a salty, briny mess -- sort of a ""dare"" beer. I was SO wrong, and pleasantly surprised to find a very well crafted, complex yet smooth and easy to drink product that's only real downside is the offputting word ""seaweed"" on its label."
"Dark brown, clear, with a thin brown head. The toffee aroma from the grain melds quite nicely with a peaty iodine character, very reminiscent of an Islay single malt scotch. Same in the flavour with a little caramel thrown in, but the malt is a little too thin to fully carry the more distinctive flavours. Salt and iodine really linger. Very interesting, but a little strange. Thanks Eric!"
"Thanks Eric!"
"This is one of the best of the Craigmill line due its dark flavour which lingers on the palate. Almost porterlike in colour and taste, I can detect a slight sea odor to the mainly malty taste . Old plums and blackberries also pop up in the flavour profile. Well made and very drinkable."
"A creamy full bodied mouth feel makes this brew a rare treat. It also makes it very drinkable."
"Overall: Really does have a lot of porter-like aspects to it except for the finish. A lot of the flavor seems to be present on the back of the tongue. I could drink this all night, but I have to admit that it's not what I was expecting from a seaweed ale - even though I really don't know what I was expecting."
"Drinkability: I can't help but enjoy this beer for its intriguing pedigree, if nothing else; but it also tastes good; if it were as rich as I would like I suspect it would be betraying its origins to appeal to modern tastes"
"Kelpie is a thick dark brown colour, seemingly black. The head, which was fizzy but still very consistent and creamy, is a cola-brown or root beer head colour. Lacing which moved rapidly in sheets. The aroma is not quite expected, but the chocolate and coffee maltiness is very strong. There IS a touch of something salty behind the malt. The cardinal aroma here though is milk chocolate. Raisins, root beer, and coffee grounds as well. Sniffing somewhat above the glass, there is a bit of a sea-water smell--a little sourness, metallic, reminding me just briefly of that difficult-to-define smell in Orval Trappist Ale. The aroma is not too noticeably different from some amber ales or stouts, but is still very appetising, and incredibly refreshing somehow. It also improves after breathing for a few minutes in the glass. My summation of the aroma: like a good malty stout but with a tad more salinity. The taste is fairly one-dimensional: soft dark malts, a little hard-water taste, and maybe the subtle hint of sourness or saltiness from the sea-weed. The malt adds some brown sugar, brown bread, and some chocolate, but there really is not much complexity to be had. Again, that is not entirely unexpected for such an old recipe, when taste was probably not as paramount a concern for the everyday person as much as slaking thirst was. The body is quite thin, a little watery, and the carbonation medium. Drinkable, but not something I would drink more than two of at one sitting. I, for one, am glad to have finally tried it, and anyone else seeing it should pick it up and taste a little history."
"A fine different ale, although I had expected even more of those seaweed flavours."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight creamy head. Aromas of veggies, sea salt, and roasted malt are present. The flavor is hard to describe because the initial taste is very much like an average porter, but the aftertaste is what destroyed this beer for me. My mouth felt like wet grass had been placed in it. The sharpness of sea salt and boiled veggies is what I couldn't get rid of. I did not enjoy this brew at all. I'm glad I tried a different style, but this was my first and last time. The whole concept of including seaweed is rather repulsive, but I tried to keep an open mind and was willing to try it. I definitely would not want another one of these. Good marks are only for the novelty of this style."
"Body is rather thin, lightly carbonated, and just plain boring. I'll take my seaweed with my sushi thank you. Leave it out of my beer."
"Drinkable, but nothing exciting going on here."
"The body is far thinner than I expected. Pretty high carbonation. The chocolate malt comes through with a nice balance of bittering hop. If there is seaweed, it only shows up as a touch of saltiness. I bought this as a novelty beer...I like it, but I don't sense the novelty."
"thanks to fellow BA mtanji for this gift from his beer of the club. Poured a deep brown, almost black color. Smell is similiar to a porter with rich chocolate notes and toasted malt present. Taste is also like a porter, with chocolate on the top and a mildly pleasant salty taste coming through. finish is moderately dry with salty notes present. A very good beer."
"Overall, pretty decent. My 1st Scottish Gruit so I really can't compare it to anything else. Not great, but worth a try if you can find it."
"Kelpie Seaweed Ale is not at all what I expected. Perhaps the brewers were afraid that a true seaweedy ale wouldn't be palatable, even to those beer drinkers adventurous enough to take a chance on such a non-traditional beer. Nevertheless, they didn't do themselves any favors by brewing an admittedly decent porter and skimping on the weed. Who knows if my pale ale/seaweed ale would be any good or not, but I'm disappointed that I never got the chance to find out."
"I found this an odd beer, but I liked it and found it very drinkable."
"And no, you can't taste the seaweed."
"Overall: Delicious beer. I dont know why this is listed as it is, since this appears by all intents and purposes as an oyster stout. My only negative comment is that I recently had the chance to try this off the hand pump, and didnt. I wont be passing up the kelpie again."
"In all, it is a fun beer that I rather enjoyed and will buy again on occation."
"Notes: Disappointing, not really any seaweed or salinity in the taste or smell. its very drinkable because there isn't much taste. The label gets your attention, but this beer lets you down."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich and creamy chocolate malt scent that also boasts of patent and roasted malts. The taste is decent. It has a thin, but smooth and flavorful, dark malt taste that boasts of pale, chocolate, and roasted malts. It goes down easy and finishes slightly watery with an earthy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a nice concept brew. I love the look and aroma, but it falls flat on the mouthfeel. All in all, a decent drinker."
"Very dark ruby black in color. Was suprised by this as I had no idea what to expect of ""Seaweed Ale"". Aroma was like old but not quite rotten ale. Smell of the sea, but not at all ""fishy"". Feel like I'm standing on an ocean pier on a cold damp day. Taste is like a stout with seaweed finish. After a few sips I can notice some hops in the background. Mouthfeel lighter bodied and more effervescent than a stout. Overall was suprised that this was drinkable at all. Not bad. Enjoyed the experience. Would not order a second one."
"I think this is a great beer! i'll be visiting scotland to see my brother in the next 2 weeks so i will definetly have to try some more styles like this when i'm there."
"The Kelpie seaweed ale has always held a mild fascination for me, trying to wrap my brain around a briney character in beer. It pours out a dark cola colour, reddish chestnut highlights when held to the light. There is very little head, deep tan the few seconds it lasts, with no retention whatsoever. I thought salt would add to retention. There are notes of rich caramel and chocolate malts on the nose before the salt barges in and takes over the show. After that the brine dominates, the malt only breaks through in small gasps. Curious, and not a bad thing, just very curious. At first the flavour possesses a rich sweet caramel malt character, even a touch of currants can be detected, but the brine picks up momentum on the finish, acting in the place of hops. The mouthfeel is watery yet full, it rolls over the tongue but possesses some body to it. The aftertaste is sweet at first, and then turns to salt. This is certainly not a session beer by any means, although it possesses its own charm of sorts, a sort of drinkable museum, replecating a style of ale that has long since become obsolete, except possibly in small pockets in Scotland with no export distribution or demand outside of local counties."
"I'm sure I was expecting more of a surprise than I got, but this was actually less strange than I thought it was. Pours a dark brown with a smallish off white head. Not extremely bubbly. Smell is where the seaweed comes in. Definately a briney seawater note to the nose, but it is replaced more by roasty chocolaty notes. Very Porter like. As it warmed a bit there might have been a little note of saline, but nothing that made me go MMMMm ocean water. Mouthfeel was a bit undercarbonated and a tad thin. Drinkability was OK, I would drink this again if it were offered. I dont think i will buy it for the cost, but it was not nearly as strange as I thought it might be."
"Meh. It is like a brown ale brewed with waterr piped in the the outer Hebrides coastline. A novel concept, but not neccesarily the best formula for a great beer. Flavor is dominated by roasted malt, with hints of salt chocolate and, umm, sushi. It is a little thin, but overall fairly drinkable. Worth trying, but not worth seeking out."
"Pours deep dark brown with a small coffee-colored head that quickly dissipates. Smells of malt, hops, hints of chocolate and seasalt in the nose. Taste follows the smell, with some heavy malts, medium hops, chocolate. However, the body is lacking. It's a bit bitter without the fullness of a stout. Reminds me of a Young's Double Chocolate that was left out for awhile and watered down. I don't know if I'd have this again, but it definitely could have been worse."
"Overall, well done. The taste and history alone are enough to bring me back"
"Drinkability- This was pretty tasty. I would recommend it to those who like porters, milk stouts or IRS. Worth a try for sure. Very enjoyable."
"Tasty all the way, easy to drink. I was sceptical, but it came though. A solid beer, a good drinker."
"Tag dated October '05. 1pt 9oz. Poured out a dark and clear rootbeery brown. Just a bit of large bubbled khaki froth that settled mainly to the one side as a thin ring. No real head to it. Toasty malt scents, merlot and chocolate. I was surprised with the tastes, very nice and dark. Roasty malt flavors, thin coffee, bit of burnt toast. Bit of house red wine left in the flavor at the end. Fairly thin mouthfeel, low carb. Easy drinker, the taste is not too intense and this is thin bodied enough to make it easy to down quite a few in a sitting. Very nice surprise in the flavor, I really did not know what I was getting into with this one when checking out the name, kinda went into it expecting a sea-water flavor, hey- ya never know with some of the experimentation going on out there! But even if it was, I probably still would have tried it!"
"Reflection: Kelpie is an interesting beer, it looks and tastes more like a porter than an ale but it's not as full bodied and it's highly carbonated."
"This is a dark brew with some red showing thru when held to the light a nice tan head falls quick. Aroma is good chocolate with hints of coffee and some musty ocean like hints in the background. Taste is roasted malt carbonation almost flat not a bad thing just different. Nice coffee flavors with chocolate hints kind of backwords from the smell for some reason. Some musty flavors also present assuming it is the kelp with some light citrus hops and a touch of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is mediumish a little flat like tasting but not bad at all, kind of adds to the experience in a way. Drinkability is good bought this because it sounded strange and didn't know what to expect, but I would buy it again its slightly different and good to boot."
"I'd drink many of these malty goodies."
"Medium, creamy body, soda like mouthfeel. Reminded me of a thin dry stout."
"What an odd idea for a beer. Seaweed. Hmm. Pours a dark brown color with a medium head that dies off quickly and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a coffee and roasted grains smell. The flavor was surprisingly good. Tastes like a thin stout - nice chocolate and coffee flavors. Finish is nice and slightly dry. Not sure where the seaweed part comes into this, but it's a good beer."
"Having not been familiar with this style of beer before today I would have guessed this beer to be porter. It definately has a lot of the characteristics of a porter."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Kelpie pours a solid coffee black color with a full, somewhat creamy head. Aroma reminds me of coffee with a hint of dark chocolates. Very strong and inviting. The flavor is very coffeeish, slightly roasted, with just a taste of chocolate. I only noticed saltiness at the very bottom of my glass and in the slight feel on my lips. Mouthfeel is moderately creamy and adds nicely to the expirience of this beer. This is something I would gladly have again anyday."
"Overall- not a bad beer. I was expecting a novelty taste (actual seaweed) but was surprised it wasn't such a bad beer after all."
"Pours a deep brown with a few deep orange hints thru out with a slight off-white head that settles nicely leaving a slight sheet of lace behind,kind of an odd aroma of roasted malt,chocalate and saline solution very different indeed.Taste starts out more like a nut brown ale some roasted flavors with some earthiness and then I picked up that ocean-like kelp flavor not heavy at all but I picked up none the less even more in the aftertaste.Not a bad brew at all some little oddities to it I am glad I gave it a try."

"Very dark mahogany appearance, seems clearish in the bit of light coming through on the bottom. Builds a greenish yellow head of 1/2 an inch for about a minute. Ring laces. Mocha aroma, slightly piquant but with a chocolate sense. Mouthfeel is medium but consistant with lower carbonation. Interesting profile for flavor, but slightly strange for me. Carob flavors, malted milk, huskiness early -- but a rather de-constructed soapy surfactant quality. The final flavors dominate the close and linger into the aftertaste. An interesting beer, differs in scores for traits widely to me -- not one that rings any bells, however."
"Beer is almost black, but there are streaks of dark ruby present. Bubbly light brown head caps the bitch off. And it sticks around for awhile. Aroma is quite chocolatey. And a little dank. The taste is also chocolatey. Dark grainy malts and slighy weedy notes add some depth. The malts are thick and chewy. Body is damn near full. And the carbonation is on the light side. This is enjoyable."
"Novel simply for the experience of drinking seaweed beer, but the price combined with the very average flavour will combine to keep this out of my fridge in the future."
"Pours out a dark, blackish color with a thick frothy almond colored head. After a few minutes the head settled to a respectable collar, but left very little lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is quite interesting. To me, it smelled something like spices, malt, salt, and chocolate. Wonderful complexity. The taste was excellent as well. Thick flavor of roasted and chocolate malts, delicately ballanced by hops and spices. It started nice and sweet, then finished slightly dry with lingering flavors. The mouthfeel aspect was slightly thinner than I expected, and left a slightly oily feel in my mouth. Not terribly unpleasant, but not what I was looking for. Overall, I feel this is a moderately drinkable beer. Not something I would drink 3 or 4 of on a hot summer day, but definitely a worthy beer for anyone who enjoys dark, malty offerings."
"An unexpected pleasure in this beer. Never got a chance to pour this one, but the bottle was cool. Smelled like mocha salt, and sea. Is that a smell? I thought it would taste like the seaweed I've had, but no, it wasn't salty at all. Did have a coffee like flavor to it, with a mildly, bitter tang. The after taste was where it kicked in that sea taste. Not sure how to describe it, but this is one I would definetly reccomend. I let my neighbors have a taste without looking at the bottle, and they loved it. When I showed them what it was, they flipped. Not sure I'd buy it again, but surely won't pass it by if offered!"
"This is a good beer to check out. It isn't at the top of my queue to try (ie. buy) again, but I'd definately drink one if offered to me."
"This is a quality product with a unique flavor that I really enjoyed. It makes me want to try the other offerings from this brewer and now I can say Ive had a Seaweed Ale."
"Drinkability: I think the novelty of this beer keeps it from being much of a repeat drinker. I think the Alba Scots Pine Ale from the same brewery is more interesting and more worthy of repeat drinking."
"Kelpie has a brief moment of budding potential, but the paint smock of an aftertaste and the coarse woolen mouthfeel destroy any enjoyment that may hope to linger."
"This ""brewed with kelp"" oddity was a gift from a friend that knew I was into beer tasting, and for that I thank him. Pours a very dark brown/black as tar color with medium tan head- not my favorite look, but actually well done. Aroma was moderately malty, creamy and toasty. The flavor was sharp with a hop afterglow, and I found myself reviewing not by what was there, but by what wasn't there- no kelp, no feelings of being at the seashore, no exotic Scottish notes, just a moderately heavy beer that was somewhat sharp and not all that exciting."
"It's very light in the mouth and the taste ends quickly and quietly."
"Me and my beer mates decided to order this out of more curiosity and fun than it acutally sounding good, but I have to say that after drinking it, it has become one of my favorite darker beers. The pour was nice and smooth and the beer dark with a nice creamy small head. Though the bottle with the squid on it might lead you to think 20,000 leagues under the sea and something that has over tones of a summer fish market...this is not at all the case. It has lovely undertones of carmel and coffee and faint green but delightful taste...it's very drinkable..i suppose i like my beer to get up and bite me...but it was very smooth to drink and bitter enough for my usual likings. I definitely would recommend this one."
"Aromas were malt, chocolate, coffee, and smoke. Tastes were malt, coffee, chocolate, seaweed (think salty spinach), metal, peat smoke. The mouthfeel was thin, I would have liked it to be creamier, to match the head and complex flavors. It finished up with malt, and faint seaweed notes."
"I knew this beer would be unique before I opened my bottle, but it's unique in a much different way than I thought it would be. Pours a deep brown color with a thin off white head. Although the aroma isn't some great scent, it's very complex, hence the high marks. Initial strong notes of chocolate and coffee in the nose, with the earthy maltiness following with the detection of the seaweed. Very robust in flavor, thought without any trace of alcohol, this is more of a porter than any other style. Bitter, dark, black coffee is the initial flavor along with some less bitter dark chocolate. The saltiness from the seaweed is detectable right in the finish, on the tip of the tongue. Just a bit of carbonation makes this brew pretty smooth. Definitely worth trying. Don't worry, it isn't fishy. Pretty tasty."
" Similar to a Porter, but with some wild historical twists."
"This brew was decent enough. This sample was best by August 2003, but I do not think that this affected the quality of this sample in any way. This brew was a dark brown colour with a nice off-white head. The aromas were simply malty (chocolate and caramel malts), with a bit of salty hops in the mix as well. The taste was very simple as well. This stuff tasted like a slightly salty porter or stout that did not have enough roasted malts thrown into the kettle. The mouthfeel was light and a bit watery and the drinkability was good. Decent, but overhyped and priced..."
"Wasn't sure what to expect from this beer. Given the exotic description of how the beer harkened back to days when grain was fertilized with seaweed, lending a seaweed flavor to the beer, I was ready for bottled sushi. While the beer was a rather good porter-ish or light stout-like beer, I really didn't get much in the way of anything that I recognized as being seaweed flavors. Some faint smoked peat flavors, and not at all salty. Good, but a bit overhyped."
"I kept looking at this at my local beer store and pondering whether to buy it or not. The term ""seaweed"" continually frightened me. What does seaweed taste like and how could it be good? Well, I finally decided to get it over with and drink it tonight. So here it my recollection of this brew. Poured much darker than I expected with a vigorous yet controlled frothy tan head. It smelled mostly malty but with a little musty, salty hint of something different. The taste was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything different either. Tasted like a thin porter. Somewhat malty with an underlying bitterness. Definitely an earthy tone to it but that's noticeable in many beers. I think that might have been the seaweed but if it was than it was weak. I didn't notice the seaweed or anything unusual at all. A decent, balanced beer but that's all."
"Heavy dark pour with an nice head. The aroma is surprisingly smoky with tones of chocolate and sweet malt. The initial taste brings , again, a surprisingly smooth body with a salty sweet chocolate malt very reminiscent of the sea. Very smooth ale with distinctive flavors. Very nice with sea-food."
"First sip reveals exactly what the aroma predicts, except I do notice a short hit of a leafy vegetable flavor on the back center of my tongue, maybe spinachy. this flavor hits and is gone very quickly so definitely dont worry if you dont like spinach. The body is light to medium and this is a very drinkable brew. Would definitely have another while hanging out etc. Low abv and ease of drinking make this a nice brew to have a few of."
"Small tan head that reduces to a thin bubbly lace. Very clean crisp airy aroma. I wouldnt have thought of it on my own, but as others have said of this brew, it has an aroma reminiscent of the ocean. Theres a slight hint of chocolate and a touch of citric hops on the nose as well. Very, very dark brown in color with some reddish brown highlights. The start is smooth. Chocolate notes are present in the middle. Salt notes pick up toward the end with a bit of roastiness. Salt and hops finish out this brew and linger for a short time. The mouthfeel is light to medium and seems a bit watered down at times. Theres an odd taste that intermingles with the others. Kelp? I dont know. I cant say that I would have any idea what kelp tastes like. All in all, a unique and drinkable brew, but not something Id have all the time. A good change of pace once in a while, but definitely not a session ale."
"I was quite dissapointed that it didn't taste like seaweed. Tasted like stout-light or an slightly thicker schwarzbier, only with a slight saltyness on the finish. Chocolatey malts, with a lightly hoppy, lightly bitter finish, nice soft roastyness. Not to bad, tasty."
"You know what I always thought would be a great flavoring to beer? Seaweed...wait, I never thought that. Luckily they gave a brief history on the label so it's not completely bizarre. It's a very dark ruby color, almost black, with minimal head and very little carbonation. Very chocolatey aroma and a bit of coffee. I could convince myself that I taste seaweed, but to be honest, it's not apparent. I think it would be best just to enjoy this as a porter. It's not bad, but let's face it. It's a novelty beer. You know you would have passed this by if it didn't say ""Seaweed Ale."""
"Other: A very singular experience. BA's should attempt to have the Heather Ale line just for the experience."
"This beer pours a clear dark reddish brown with a largish tan head that dissipates to become small and clingy. It smells faintly of molasses with a slight musty undertone. The taste has a slight smokiness is syruppy without the overwhelming sweetness and a mild earthy hop character with a thin body belying its color. Overall a decent beer with a dissapointing mouthfeel and an odd lingering aftertaste."
"Overall Impression: A surprisingly normal beer. I was a little taken aback when I first saw it on the shelf. Thought it would taste a lot more... I don't know... kelpie. Tastes pretty much like a porter, a good porter at that!"
"For the BJCP style, I imagine historical or experimental beer, this is definitely in the 4.8-4.9 / 5 range if not a 5/5 - interesting concept, very well conceived and carried out by a quality brewer."
"Interesting concept seaweed ale, I figured after searching though the shelves and taking nearly an hour in D's Six Pack one day, this beer found it's way into my selections. Pours a deep, very dark ruby brown almost black really had to hold it toward the light to see the ruby tinged edges of this black abyss. The tan creamy head pours thick but then dissipates rather quickly leaving trickled lace in my Gulden Draak 20 ounce tulip shaped glass. Aromatics are much of a coffee porter with deep roasts filled with dark chocolate and cocoa. A bit milky with an air of sea air in the background, I am not trying to force the seaweed but it is evident there not dominantly but traceable. Taste is creamy smooth dark roasts slightly bitter, slightly harsh from the dark roasted barley in this beer. The salty finish tingles the back of the throat, but it's not overbearing at all not like gargling salt water just reminiscient of it. This beer works suprisingly I didn't know what to expect here, but I am rather pleased. As for mouthfeel just a little thin bodied not much fireworks or exciting textures going on here. Drinkability is decent but I wouldn't put it on my must taste list something of a novelty beer, but not bad very drinkable just not a classic in my book. Creativity was flowing here and along with the other beers from Heather Ales brewing ancient beer is their art."
"If you see this beer on the Wicket  Snicket."
"Drinkability: I had no idea what to expect when I bought this beer. Fortunately, the seaweed aspect isn't noticable, and this comes across as a decent, if not too thin in flavor, porter. I could drink this again, though I won't actively seek it out."
"500 ml bottle. Best before date of June, 2004."
"Yeah! There is no seaweed smell, but definitely a sweet chocolate smell combined with some roasted malts. The beer is a dark, dark red with a short-lived head on top. The first sip brings the roasted malts immediately which is then followed by the chocolate flavors. Leaves a roasted malt feel on the back of the mouth. No hops are screaming at you by any means. The brew left a slight metallic feel around the tongue, but smooth and earthy in texture. A nice beer."
"Beautiful, persistent, thick head. Deep dark color (no green) Smells very fresh, a litte light for how robust it looks. Does not smell like a beach nor does it taste like seaweed! Tastes like a very good porter. Scoots across the tongue. And surprisingly drinkable. In lesser company, we would have been clubbing each other for the last drops of the stuff. Since I was with fellow BAs, however, we shared very well. A surprise find. It's now one of my favorite dark beers."
"The color a deep, I mean deep mahogany, the head is quite modest, the consistency frothy, the color a light tan and the lace left behind a thin sheet. The nose! Does remind one of Seaweed, putrefying on a beach, some malt noticed, musty, or musk like for that matter a different aroma for sure. Front is mostly malt, lightly sweet, top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a delicate acidity, the hops quite mild, aftertaste dry, a drinkable beer, but cant really say it rocks my world, nor harms it for that matter."
"I've been waiting for this beast for a while. When I say beast, I guess that's a little play on words, because everybody knows that a Kelpie is a Scottish mythical beast. With that said, time to move on to the review. This is a wicked awesome beer. It had a very nice dark color, but lacke the head retention that I desire with most of my beers. Other than that, it had a nice look to it, super dark. The smell was like milk chocolate, mixed with coffee, and ocean water. I'm a beach bum, so I like that little smell added to it. The taste was similar to the smell. The first initial tast was that of a mocha. There was the obvious taste of saltiness, but nothing too bad. This one also had a nice coating effect to it. I would recommend this brew with a nice sushi or good tuna steak. Ofcourse, swordfish would be good too!"
"I had this with an Ethiopian dish called Raafu, consisting of kale, carrots, potatoes, peppers, herbs, and spices. Went toghether well. And I thank UncleJimbo for sending it."
"This ale poured a dark brown (hints of red around the edges) with some tan foam that settled to a thin coat that left some lace on the glass. The smell was a strong molasses aroma with a touch of caramel. The smell lasted the entire bottle. The taste was molasses, malt, caramel, a hint of chocolate, and a bit of hops. It was not overly sweet. The flavor was not very complex but was tasty. There was a hint of seaweed (a hint of metallic iodine) in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth, clean, and dry, with medium body and low to medium carbonation feel. I found this ale to be very drinkable and enjoyable. Another nice one from this brewery."
"Pour is dark brown, almost black. Has a small tan head, almost all diminishing with no lace left behind. Aroma is of roasted and toasted malts, mostly similar to coffee. Flavor is of roasted coffee, light bitter chocolate. Body is medium, and a metallic flavor came through towards the end."
"Very dark brown, can just see through it. There's little to no head. Aroma is strong of chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. This is a very smooth beer, very malty chocolatey. I don't know where the seaweed comes in. I don't know what seaweed tastes like so I didn't know what to look for. I didn't taste anything odd, just a smooth and enjoyable beer...kinda like a porter but thinner."
"Pours blacke with a soft, foamy head. The head doesn't leave much lace. Aroma is of roasted chocolate malts. Textured, rough mouthfeel and a sweet malty taste. Grainy and slightly nutty. The bottle claims ""the aromS of fresh seabreeze""...I don't quite get what they're after here. But...I swear there's a saltiness that you can pick up on your tongue. I can't help thinking of the beer as a gimmick-brew, but it is interesting and worth a trying."
"pours a dark brown but ends up not being as heavy as it appears. the smell instantly reminded me of a misty day at the beach. chocolate and hints of seaweed readily apparent, as is a definite salty flavour. this is one strange beer, but one i'd happily enjoy again."
"Well retained tan head. Dark brown w/ clear, deep ruby hints when held to light. Rich, smokey deeply roasted black patent and chocolate malt upfront in aroma, w/ subtle notes of dark caramel and coarsely floral Kent Goldings. Be it the powers of suggestion, but there's a hint of ocean spray perceptible with a deep inhale. Flavorwise, Kelpie exhibits a well balanced malt and hop profile, w/ both residual and caramel malt derived sweetness balanced by hop and roasted malt sharpness. Mild diacetyl adds a buttery component that complements the chocolate and dark caramel malt. Smoothly smokey undertone adds depth and richness, and helps lend the impression of greater than actual strength. Finishes w/ an impression of bittersweet chocolate. Kelpie is quite an enjoyable brew. Agreeably heavy on dark malts. Reminscent of a session porter."
"I was really nervous about trying this one. I don't really know what seaweed tastes like, but it doesn't appear to be a main ingredient in this brew. Dark amber color with a thick beige head. Lightly malty/roasted aroma. Malt very present in the flavor as well, with a little chocolate here and there. As far as novelty beers go this one is pretty solid, but on the grand scale of things it isn't really breaking any new ground."
"Dark brown with a quickly disappearing tan head, this brew has a fairly complex aroma of roasted malt, molasses, dark chocolate, a bit of smoke and a slightly sour smell (but not in a bad way) that I can't quite place (the seaweed, I guess).  Less complex on the palate, roast malt flavors dominate and a touch of ""vegetal smokiness"" (don't know how else to describe it) on the finish.  All in all a good brew, but this beer loses points for being a bit too thin."
"Pours an extremely dark amber/almost brown with a good dark tan head that leaves a decent lace.  Has a slight roasted aroma to it as well as some caramel sweetness.  Brew starts off with more caramel maltiness with some slight diacetyl flavors floating in the background.  The roastedness of the beer then comes forward through the finish to make the sweetness take a turn towards chocolate before heading out on a coffeeish note.  The brew is rather creamy and has a medium to medium full body which is perfectly appropriate with the flavors and makes this brew rather drinkable."
"Okay, this beer pours out dark and has nice very dark color to it.  It forms a deep tan head, which is descent, but didn't hold.  I was skittish about smelling, due to the name.  But actually the aroma's not bad.  It smelled of hops.  The taste was a little sour and it's lighter than I usually expect dark beers like this to be."
"Pours dark with no head but is a lot lighter than it looks.  Smells earthy, could not taste the seaweed (what does seaweed taste like in beer?) but a distinctive flavor and worth trying.  330ml bottle."
"Notes: No fishy ocean flavours or aromas. There is that fresh ocean flavour and smell though, salty and earthy. With that on a beer that is somewhere between a hearty brown ale and a brown porter it is quite and intricate mix. An interesting beer to say the least and well worth a try."
"They are at it again!!! This time it is a beer made with sea weed. This is a dark beer bordering on porter. The sea weed give it a bit of a funk smell and after taste. Not the best idea they ever had. I do have customers though that have come back and bought this more than once."
