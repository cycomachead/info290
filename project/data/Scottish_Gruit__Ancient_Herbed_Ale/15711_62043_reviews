"Overall: Farewell Ale is certainly a very interesting beer and one I enjoyed drinking, but it is not something I could see my self buying again."

"Bottle: Poured a murky dark brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee and chocolate with some light herbs notes is pretty unique and very nice. Taste is a good mix between some coffee and chocolate with light dry fruits, herbs with a dry aftertaste. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Unique and quite complex beer that retains some drinkability."

"500ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Very dark amber color, deep ruby to the light. Beige, close, small bubbled, crown. Fairly good retention. Aroma profile is great: roasted malts, intense herbal & spiced touch, burnt coffee, burnt bread, hints of licorice…Smooth sweet malty upfront rounded by coffee, cocoa & bready hues. Bitterness in the middle. Oily texture. Complex & velvet palate. Medium to full body, moderate to soft carbonation. Coffee long finish. ABV well masked resolves into a refreshing & drinkable experience."
"Served in a tulip glass, a dark brown-black, opaque, with a bubbly, light tan head that receded to a thin layer within a few minutes. Aroma of dark chocolate, lightly smokey malts, spice medley, and indistinct fruits. Similar taste, dark chocolate, dark dried fruits, cinnamon, pepper, charred firewood, with hints of fruity candy. Medium mouthfeel, might remind you of a stout or porter, but lacks the full body inherent of those styles. Interesting and tasty."

"O - A very pleasant, warming ale. My first gruit and I like it."
"I can taste in this palate the beer this might have been. Unfortunately I have to look for it, as the best flavours here don't quite speak enough for themselves."
"Medium bodied but fuller than expected with some roasted malt, earthy hop, zesty spice and nut.  Slightly roasted with a earthy vegetal feel mixed with dry, bitter, earthy hops, sweet malt and boozy alcohol.  Sweet yet dry finish."
"I dug it's nearly opaque, gritty, blood-stained dark mud color. Had some foam, too. Gotta try some more of what this brewery has to offer..."
"A solid beer with lots of interesting character. The smokiness is a little surprising for the gruit but appropriate and the esters and very mild citrus notes add great complexity."
"Overall I was surprised by the level of roast in this beer. Very interesting and worth a shot."
"Overall: This was a great beer; inviting aroma, complex flavors, high drinkability and pleasing to the mouth. If you come across it pick it up or try a glass. Even for those that don't like stouts (though I know it isn't the style it shares similarities), this might suprise you."
"D: Goes down quite easily, nice kick, not too filling, I've never had this style before but I would gladly snag this one again!"
"Drinkability is hard for me to rate. I don't have another bottle, but if I did, would I drink it NOW? Yes. But I couldn't say if I would even finish it. Tastes more herbal the farther you get into a bottle. Hmm. Different. Definitely good in small doses."
"D: It may not always be great, but the guys at the HaandBryggeriet always do something interesting that expands your palate. This isn't a mind-blowing beer, but it is a good beer, dark, powerful, but ultimately a contemplative effort."
