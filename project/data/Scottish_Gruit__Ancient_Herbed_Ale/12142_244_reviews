"The beer color is pale yellow, a little bit cloudy with a very minimal head that disappear quickly. The aroma is fruity, some lavender. Nice fruity aroma very inviting. The taste is not very fruity. Its there, but very subtly. Woody, Earthy for the bitterness. Its bitter. Thin body. It warms the palate, the alcohol seems higher than 5%. A very nice beer."

"Overall. Really very pleasing and I can see why this beer was originally brewed to slick the thirst of the harvest workers. Fresh, light and crisp this is a really good drink. ‘A grand slooter fer yer drooth’ (A good drink for your thirst.)"

"The taste has a kind of herbal quality to it along with the toasted biscuit malts and clean, crisp hops. Gooseberry and wheat they promise. Not sure how much of either I picked up but maybe I just could not distinguish. It did have a uniqueness to it."
""
"O: Loving the concept as described above. Great labeling on the bottle- Came with LCBO’s Ancient Scottish Ales Gift Wrap pack with 3 others. Drank in January 2013."
""
"Firm hop bitterness upfront with wheaty malts and English pale maltiness. Fruity, somewhat. Cloudberry, pear, and tart apricot. Somewhat toasty. Bitterness almost turns into creaminess, late in the drink. Body echoes nearly the same with some mushiness that the carbonation tries to prickle up. A decent beer to pair with food."

"O - Not overly impressed, but it is a very subtle drink - not one feature dominates. With that said, I expect this to be my least favourite in the 4-pack, mainly because it is brewed with lager malt, which I don't have a good palette for. With that said, others may come to a different conclusion."
"Overall - For whatever reason, I just didn't really enjoy this, one of those situations (to me at least) where the sum of the beer was less than the individual components. I think this is a beer worth revisiting, as I feel that I might evaluate this differently in the future, but i definitely found it to be the weakest beer of the sampler pack."

"T: I don't know, kind of just tastes like a weak wheat ale. Underwhelming to say the least. Light slightly sour wheat note that kind of just dies. Some grain, chalky yeast and, yeah, off-tasting wheat. That's about it. Damn it."
""
"The taste is a little... not quite watery, but trending in that direction (p value not within significance), but I can't say it's thin because it actually has a medium to chewy body, which I find quite appealing. After smelling it, I was concerned that this would be kind of stale and brackish on the tongue, but it's actually quite crisp and refreshing. I find myself pleasantly surprised, and would certainly consider it again."
""
""
""
"Best when served really cold."
""
""
"O: I don't get much difference between this and a typical fruity wheat ale, but at least this better than some of the crappier examples of the style. Due to the fact that it's kind of pricey for what it is, I probably won't get this again."

"O- Very crisp, tasty beer. Not much to say about it."
""
""
""
"... this was an old bottle though and I'll reiterate the fact that I would love to get a fresh one. Just gonna have to take a tour of the brewery, I guess."

"A good light ale, interesting flavor, worth trying for its uniqueness."
"Pretty good - the light malt and restrained hopping complement the floral fruit flavours without overshadowing them. The label describes it as a brew designed to refresh, which the mild-tasting but sour gooseberry will certainly achieve. The lagering process adds depth to the beer's character. A decent effort that would go down well on a warm day. Worth sampling if you come across it."
"Enjoyable, and certainly not bad, just somehow underwhelming."
""
"Interesting for the style. Not a particularly great representation of the style, but it still works on its own. Worth a try."
"Overall. Interesting beer. Not the best tasting beer I've had, but not terrible. I think one time is enough."
"I found this to be a great beer. Tons of character and appropriate for the style. Very clean and flavorful from beginning to end."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep straw, light golden color with a smallish bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of mild spice rack with a light tart fruitiness and a it of sweet bready sugary malt. The flavor is graham cracker and pilsner malt with a light fruity tartness as well as a large amount of non descript spices. Light to medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. Another one that is quite different, but I liked it. The sweetness in the malt works well with the high level of spice."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
""
"O - A unique ale that has a heavy sour flavour that provides for a unique experience, but I can imagine would only appeal to a unique palette. Glad I tried it, though not certain it's something I would go out of my way to try again."
"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a small 1 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of gooseberry, cherry, apple, herbal, floral, honey, light caramel, bread, grain, and wheat. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, bread, pear, light berry, toasted grain, wheat, herbal, floral, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, bread, toasted grain, wheat, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Solid flavor balance and complexity; with a fair amount of flavors, but does border being watery a bit; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Slightly dry on the finish. Gooseberry flavor was not as prominent as I would have hoped. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice herbal ancient ale style. Nice flavor balance with decent complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. I enjoyed this quite a bit."
""
"Final Grade: 3.55, a B grade. Grozet Gooseberry & Wheat Ale is a respectable offering, but not a very memorable one. It sort of reminds me of an American pale wheat ale with a slight touch of herbs and berries; a borderline bland base with nearly enough accents to make it interesting, but not quite getting there. The wheat malt and herb flavours actually do work quite well together, and it's certainly quite drinkable, but I doubt I'll be clamoring for another any time soon. I'm not sure what gooseberries are supposed to taste like, but I do know that using more probably would have made this a bit more interesting. I'll give this brew a thumbs up, but it's a wavering sort of one - probably not worth picking up on its own, but not a bad inclusion in this sampler."
"3.5 D: I don't know what this would be like fresh, but with a lot of time on it, it's quite tasty."
""

"O - Overall, there is nothing wrong with this beer but it isn't particularly interesting either. Williams Brothers referring to this as a wheat ale sets expectations that aren't in line with the true style. This specialty is more of a curiosity than a must-try, but it is well executed and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"light drinkable beer but a full 5% ABV, this is my favourite from this taster pack so far."
""
"O: It's okay, tastes good if you're in the mood for dessert but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
""
""
""
""
"M - Light body with a slight bit of chew. Light to moderate carbonation."
"The feel is light, as I would expect. It's both crisp and smooth, but each mildly, and a bit more of either would make for a livelier sip. As it is, it's easy to drink and is semi-dry, straddling the fence a bit."
""
""
""
"For some reason I thought this beer would be much sweeter..? But then I have to remember it is from Scotland... (Is there anything that's fairly sweet tasting from Scotland?) Will try more beers from the William Brothers, this one was interesting to say the least. Gotta try some actual gooseberries. And try this beer fresher too!"
"Overall: Not a shabby beer at all. This is leftover from a sampler I gave somebody. Will have to try the other traditional Scottish ales from Williams. Centuries old beer styles can still be enjoyed today amongst other styles."
""
"Overall - Kind of reminds me of a wine cooler with the flavors it has. Its light, smooth and easy enough to drink, just not something id want again."

"I noticed the long neck bottle was mostly empty in the neck so I felt cheated out of a shot of beer. Poured a 2"" off-white head of medium life. The body is a clear straw yellow with a touch of orange. The smell is very light, just a hint of tart fruit. The taste is pretty interesting with gooseberry tartness up front and malted wheat in the midpalate and then an acidic grassiness in the finish."
"O: A very nice, drinkable, light and airy beer. Not much to write home about here, but it's nothing to complain over, either."
""
"I am pleasantly surprised with this beer. Going into it, I did not know what to expect. Good flavor, good balance and highly sessionable."
"Slightly hazy pale golden colour, collar of soapy white head, light lace on the glass. Smell has strong fruity notes, berries (I guess gooseberry?), floral, biscuity malt is present but second or third string to the floral and fruity scents that come off of this. Taste is grassy and herbal initially, berries in the form of blackberry and raspberry, biscuity malt with a long fruity finish. Light-med carbonation, medium body, decent weight overall. This was OK, not outstanding by any stretch but refreshing and drinkable, would maybe have this again if it was offered to me but not something worth seeking out."

"This beer poured out much like any other wheat beer. The color was hazy gold in color with a fluffy white head. The smell of the beer is lightly fruity with a nice light aroma of wheat on the nose. The taste of the beer was a little fruity but nothing overpowering. The grainy flavors of wheat and some malt make this beer pretty refreshing. The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly carbonated, it had a light body also. Overall it was a fun beer to try but not as good as some of the other beers from the Williams Brothers."
"Overall... I really enjoyed this beer. It reminds me very much of the pilsner style, with the depth and body character of an ale. Despite the fact that the flavors are lacking, the real experience here is in the mouthfeel and aroma of the beer. I will definitely be having this one again."
"Odd beer, but nice!"
""
"Appears with lively small bubbled carbonation very pale golden body with a thicket of white head forming and lasting nicely. Fine speckled lacing lines in layers around the sides of my glass. Aroma a distinct berry jam nose with some sharp wheat additions, some green herbal additions are noticeable as well. Flavor is interesting a big spicy layer combined with a sharp wheat beer notes and finishes with sweet jam with the gooseberries. Actually the best tasting and most complex beer from the 3 of the 4 I've had so far. Mouthfeel does have lively carbonation lighter bodied but not watery and finishes with an herbal dryness not bad. Overall I really like this unique twist on a wheat beer with fruit additions and herbal spiciness to balance it all out this is the most adventurous on the palate and diverse in flavors."
"Unique and very pleasant. Refreshing and drinkable."
""
"Pours gold with a bit of a yellow tinge to it, brilliant clarity but almost resembling a macro lager. Nice semi-soapy white head, and good retention. Nose has some berry evident, can't pin this one down as gooseberry (as this is my first experience with the berry). Some light grass, wet wood, cereals and general grain notes. Can't really pick up the wheat here. Taste follows along the same trail, more grassy, herbal, and earth notes with the berry as well, I guess gooseberry takes on some blackberry/currant characteristics. Again, I can't seem to find the wheat here but the malts is more cereal-y and crackery. Light mouthfeel and a carbonation that resmebles a macro. A decent beer, my girlfriend liked this more than I did thought."
""

"A nice change of pace and definitely unique."

"Very drinkable and refreshing ale that still has a lot of character and a satisfying earthiness. Started off a bit funky, but really opened up towards the bottom of the glass."

"D: A unique, refreshing, and easy-drinking gruit that's very accessible compared to more alien examples of the style. By the same token, though, it's less complex and sensual than other gruits. I've only ever seen it in the gift packs the LCBO stocks around winter, but it'd be wonderful in warmer weather."
"Very light, very crispy, very refreshing. There's almost a light bitter side to this beer that comes mid-way through the finish. It's a decent beer though nothing is terribly notable about it. I'd say it's worth taking a shot at. Michael Jackson mentioned it in his Great Beer Guide."
"Morey's Bottom Line: With the grape flavor and lower carbonation, this beer almost taste like wine to me. If you are a wine lover, you'd probably enjoy this one. A good introduction beer for your wine drinking friends/family."
"O: The flavour was sour/bitter without much else to compliment it. 3"
"this a very tasty beer. would recommend it to anyone looking for a session beer outside of the american pilsner market."
"Very easy drinking beer."
"Very average brew, and pretty lacklustre, although it has a few interesting upturns that give a bit of a surprise."
"D - Pretty distinctive taste. Not sure I could drink a ton of this but it is definitely a great try."
"Pours cloudy with a mild amount of setament. Havs a very mild aroma and only nice a mild hint of spices. Very like sweetness with wheat and finished with a nice spice and hoppness and smooth finish. Dark nice amber color and a mild caramel taste. Very good and unquie beer."
"O: From reading the description, I thought this beer would be pretty bad, but quite the contrary! Definitely recommended."
"O/D - Nice floral/berry mix. Not too bad. An interesting, different blend."
"O: Nothing too amazing. Glad I tried it, but I don't see myself getting this again or recommending it."
"Interesting to try but would not want this as a daily drink."
"Poured into a pint glass, a hazy copper with big chunks of sediment floating around (some people like this, some don't, personally I'm impartial). A small, quickly dissipating white head left a bit of lacing. Lots of carbonation. Bready nose, with a strong scent of what I assume is gooseberry...I've never tasted a gooseberry, but this is a gooseberry beer after all. :D Sort of a hybrid of pears, lemon zest, blueberry and mango. Distinctive layers in the taste: starts very pungent with fruit (described in the aroma); a bit of funk, and a little spice in the middle, with some citrus hops coming through; and then a final little unexpected blast of sweet & sour, which is the best way I can describe it. Crisp and dry, light mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable. Seems like it'd probably skunk pretty badly if left sitting around. Good beer."
"D-Overall this is a nice beer. The spices and wheat were well balanced and this was very drinkable. Good representation of this style."
"Pours a very light golden color with a very thin head and no lacing. Smells of light wheat, some malts, and some sort of astringent flavor. Tastes of wheat, mild hops if any, and some gooseberry (if that is what that sort of odd berry flavor is.) Mouthfeel is medium with very little carbonation. Drinkability is not very good."
"An interesting concoction with an historic past. Well worth the adventure."
"The CPJ"
"I was looking forward to something different that might stretch my palate a bit, but it was not to be. The label art is really cool."
"Pours a pale yellow with a small white head. Not much lacing or retention. Light aroma. Toasted grains and a hint of lemon. Flavor beings following the aroma. Toasted wheat and a hint of lemon start the beer off. Tea like flavor. Pale malt followed by a small kick of sweet berries to finish. Pretty mellow flavor. Oddly creamy mouthfeel for such a light brew."
"Drink - Although it isn't spectacular, this is definitely the best beer I've had so far from this brewer. Would be a decent summer refresher - worth a try."
"D: This is an interesting beer, excellent and flavorful. Very sessionable beer, bravo Scotland for embracing and sending out this beer."
"D: overall a pretty good beer for a pretty good price. Refreshing on a warm day and perfect for a cookout."
"Light body and nicely drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable; could actually be a decent session beer."
"D- This beer certainly is easy drinking, but the ever evolving flavor would deter this."
"Hazy yellow/orange body with little to no head. Looks rather still. Aroma is that of light pale malts. Very faint hoppy/earthy aroma. Not sure what the gooseberries do to this beer. All I am getting is a hoppy pale lager. Some earthy tones in the finish, but i feel as though this beer fell flat. Not bad, just nothing memorable."
"One finger head that didn't last long, somewhat clinging lace. Color is a hazy 7 on the SRM beer color chart. Aromas of berries, malt and roasted wheat. Flavor is sweet berries, with a slight citrus flavor, along with roasted wheat and barley. Medium body in my mouth. A little sweet for everyday drinking, but would be great with desert."
"Upd: And long-lasting astringent aftertaste, surprisingly"
"Looks and feels like any old macro lager, but has a unique yet largely uninteresting flavour profile that's tricky to describe."
"Bottle from 4 bottle pack purchased at the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a clear yellow colour with thin white head that dissipates fairly quickly without much lacing on the glass. Smells of mild wheat malt with some fruitiness from the gooseberry. Flavour is sweet, with a little bit of tartness. A very light beer, lighter than I expected. It is fine for a fruity wheat beer, but nothing too spectacular."
"With a colour reminiscent of old gold this is yet another beer which superfically looks like a pilsner. Not much smell. Foamy head with a reasonable amount of beading. The gooseberry element is very much in the background. Chewy, feel is very good. Supple but spritzy with an ever so slight tartness that you could miss if you weren't mindful. Nothing much like a fruit beer. Very satisfying, clean and refreshing. Perfect for a hot day. Not that we get many of those in Scotland."
"i could live in Scotland and drink stuff from this brewery all day long!"
"Ideal barbecue drink, would be great on a Mediterranean beach, but I like my beers to have a bit more body and flavours."
"Taste is interesting, ligh but very characterful with subtle complexity. It has full grain character, light zesty fruitiness, light wine-like character, some spiciness that is stronger at finish and aftertaste. Light sweetness up front with very light bitterness balancing it at the finish and after. Some of the elements are hard to pin down, but it is extremely enjoyable."
"Definitely worth a visit for the beer-curious."
"D: I always enjoy trying new beers / styles. This was fun. The beer is enjoyable, though one is plenty. It wasn't my favorite by any means, but the experience was worth it."
"D: It's very easy to drink this beer, and the low alcohol content makes it rather sessionable. I would definitely consider having this again if I was in the mood for a witbier but wanted a different flavor than orange peels."
"I got this as a bottle in a mixed four pack-- I wish they'd sell all of their portfolio in six-packs."
"Mouthfeel is medium body with some dryness and tart sourness in the aftertaste"
"A tasty beer I suppose but lacking in anything particularly interesting. Decent but not great."
"An interesting brew. Similar to a light pale ale, but with enough unique characteristics to make it enjoyable. Looking forward to the rest!"
"﻿Beautiful light orange, lightly hazy with a thick white head with great retention. The nose has a bright gooseberry tartness and light caramel sweetness. No hops, but the sourness does add a a lot of character to this beer. Some juniper as well? The palate opens with a blend of mild tartness, not very gooseberry like with heather and juniper. Mild sweetness with caramel and honey, drying on the finish with tartness and heather. Medium body, moderate carbonation an a long lasting finish with tartness and honey, this beer is quite exceptional"
"Notes: This is a nice beer to drink and an easy one to drink. Compared to the other beers they make that use more unusual ingredients, this one is a bit more tame. There is definitely a fruity flavor, but it doesn't overpower the drink, which is nice. The flavors are a little thin for me, but they are nice."
"This is nice light easy drinking fruity beer. Nice flavors, although I wish there was a little more depth and complexity to it, but good nonetheless."
"Personally, I expected more of a gooseberry tang up front, but the gooseberry is nearly absent. Interesting, not offensive, but not something memorable."
"Slightly hazy pineapple juice yellow with a fizzy and fast dissipating white head. Sweetish and mild aroma of bread malts, lemon, and tart fruit. I've never actually had gooseberries before, but I think I taste them now. No chemical aftertaste, so I assume its natural. Of course, the ingredients list says ""gooseberries"" and not ""extract"" or ""artificial flavour."" Aside from the sweet fruit flavour, it's a little bit tangy and shows some faint hopping in the finish. It's inoffensive. Light bodied with low carbonation. Feels thin and watery. I would have enjoyed this a whole lot more in the middle of July."
"Pours a clear straw-amber with an active bubbly foam of white head that leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. The smell has a vague sweetness to it, along with notes of berries, brown sugar, cloves, spices, and citrus. The taste attempts to follow, but the gruit-style spices dull the citrusy and sweet flavors, replacing them with a middling melange of herbal and spicy notes. The overall taste resembles a bitter piece of old pineapple, or the inside of an orange peel. Luckily, the moderate body and carbonation and slick feel allow this brew to rise above its lackluster flavor to maintain a decent degree of drinkability. Overall, though, an unimpressive gruit-style brew."
"This brew pours a pale straw colour with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and very sporadic lacing,the aroma is quite sweet with hints of wheat,lemongrass and gooseberries,it has an average mouthfeel with quite a sweet grassy,fruity taste to it with tastes of sweet wheat and grains and also at the end i get a little bittersweet hit of gooseberries mixed with hops,although this beer is no standout its very easy to drink especially on a nice hot day like today."
"Light body to the point of being watery. Extremely light beer. There's nothing really there, whether good or bad. It's drinkable, but there is just nothing to love or hate about this one. Inoffensive to a fault."
"Conclusion: An odd little number, but pretty tasty."
"Overall a solid beer. Nothing spectacular, but my guess would be this is how beer was served for quite a long time."
"The taste reminds me so much of a good pilsner, though not as hoppy. Has a pleasant herbal quality that is not too strong. Good for swilling on a spring afternoon."
"Goes down easy, pretty tasty, mild, no aftertaste."
"I seem to be a minority voice on the Grozet. I am also counted among the dissenters for the Ederberry and Heather offering, as well."
"An interesting beer worth trying. The ingredients list hops, I always thought that what classified a gruit was the absence of hops."
"A fairly simple beer lacking any real depth or complexity but definitely something out of the ordinary."
"Drinkability: I don't think that Grozet is ever going to be an everyday-type beer for me, but it is quite tasty and original."
"Final Thoughts: If this is representative of gruit beer, then sign me up. This beer was exceptionally easy to drink, and has left me looking forward to the rest of the pack. My thumb is way up on this one, however I would be naive to say it is for everyone. This beer would have been excellent training wheels in my youth to beer as a whole."
"Overall, an interesting and unusual beer, but nothing really popped out. The gooseberries were great and balanced well with the rest of the beer, but I think they could have been a bit more pronounced. 1 down and 3 to go from the Historic Ales pack, and this one, despite being mediocre, makes me look forward to trying the rest."
"Gonna put drinkablity above average. I'd have another if I had one around. Not sure how the staying power would be after a second, but overall, I'd buy this again."
"Medium bodied mouthfeel with mild carbonation with a bit of a spicy aftertaste. It's plenty drinkable and I'm glad I tried it for its uniqueness."
"Flavor is mostly that of a wheat beer, carbonation is not adding anything to the flavor, some Belgium character as well. Reminds me a lot of Loft ale from New Belgium. The beer finishes with a mild aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Very lightly carbonated and light bodied."
"Drinkability- It was pretty good. I would drink it again. I think I tatsed the gooseberries but I have never tasted gooseberries before."
"A great summer beer and very drinkable. A unique take on the style."
"D- Very sessionable and a perfect hot weather beer."
"Great, complexity. Give it a try."
"The flavours of gooseberry, etc act only as minor footnotes and suspend the belief that this must really have been what ancient Scottish Gruit was like. By making a most average, ordinary beer out of a unique, traditional style serves only to extend the problem this brewery means to solve; Grozet way ween people onto more diverse styles but it won't convince them they're worth drinking or saving - or that they're all that special."
" Poured a darker than expected, hazy amber color with a scant whitish head. Smells decent enough...somewhat sweet, but there is this lingering funk that I can't seem to put my finger on (not like a sour funk, just funk funk). Taste is flat, really flat....some weird malty tastes, really no sweetness..I don't really know what to make of this. MF is thin, and watery with no carbonation...Geez, I must've gotten a really bad bottle, kinda disappointed since I've been eyeing this one for a while, guess I'll have to get this one again..."
"Finish is extremely soft and really smooth, with a soft bite on the back end."
"Drinkability: This beer is good, but not great in my humble opinion. It is something I could drink again, but I feel there are better beers out there."
"A nice apertif to pair prior to a dinner course that will consist of farmhouse-style ales (e.g., saison). This makes for a nice, but logical, reasonable transition on the palate."
"The sweet and tart gooseberries are refreshing, but this is really a novelty beer."
"D: An interesting drink, and it's nice to see a brewer trying to recreate these ancient Celtic ales."
"D - A pretty good beer, though I do wish the grains had been a stronger focus. At the end of the day, Grozet is just one big hodgepodge of spices and herbs, hitting a wide range of flavors but missing the note when it comes to ""malt."""
"Moderate carbonation and a medium light body make this otherwise refreshing beer more satisfying."
"After reading the other reviews, I think my bottle of Grozet just aged too long. The bottle has a November 2008 ""best before"" marking, but I guess a lot can happen in three months. There was zero froth, lacing, retention, or anything of the sort. The beer had some carbonation but tasted a bit flat. It was slightly hazy, maybe a little dirty water golden in color. The nose is floral, a bit grainy, perhaps a bit of grape skin or vinous qualities. The taste is just too flat and thin to be overly interesting. I'm getting some sweet berry flavors, presumably the gooseberry, some hop in the background; this is just too thin, a touch on the tart side, a bit of a vinous grape skin quality, as the nose would indicate. I think I will need to try this with a freshness date within the proper range."
"Quite refreshing and I certainly enjoyed it. Too bad it was the last bottle in the City of Coor Lite and Clam."
"D - I could def. see drinking a few of these on a hot summer day, maybe in the woods? Interesting for sure. Definitely worth trying for the historical experience and the nice super-dry finish."
"D - Interesting, and I could probably have one anytime, but this probably wouldn't displace traditional hefes and witbiers from my typical wheat beer rotation."
"Drinkability: This has a different taste than other beers I have tried...There is just enough to know the beer is from Scotland as it has a light Scottish Ale taste...I could drink several because of its uniqueness"
"D - Interesting for sure. Definitely worth trying for the historical experience and the nice super-dry finish. I can imagine sitting in a 16th century Scottish alehouse and getting belligerently drunk on this old-time brew."
"A fun novelty beer to try. If you're feeling adventurous, give this one a try. How often do you see an Ale brewed with gooseberries? One of these was enough for me. Could it be a session Ale? Not unless you really like gooseberries."
"A sweet vienous quality, really nice unique mouthfeel, a slight sour tartness. A really nice brew, not a session brew, but a couple of these a year would be a treat."
"D- This has a great balance for not having hops. If you enjoy authentic scotch ales, this will be great for you."
"This beer pours a pale amber-orange color. The head is small, and there is no lacing. The aroma is of gooseberry, floral hops, heather, and faint caramel. The taste is maltier than the aroma with a lot more heather, and some gooseberry. The mouthfeel has a wonderful silky, soft texture, with appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer. It is flavorful, nuanced, and easy drinking. I would certainly drink this again."
"Clean moderate carbonation and a low to medium body. This is a really great beer, it would go really well with chicken or fish I'd say. I'd love to have this with a lemon chicken or lemon pepper salmon steak. Great beer!!"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden straw color with a small pure white head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is faint, some honey malt and a non-distinct berry scent. The taste is of sweet and sour berries, a flowery spice profile and an earthy bitterness. The flavors aren't bold but are quite unique and work well together, good range. The feel is light, with almost flat carbonation, finishes fairly crisp and dry. Quite the unique fruit wheat ale. A nice change of pace if you want an herbal brew with a different berry flavor."
"Notes: I could drink a few of these, certainly. I don't feel like it's a beer that would get tiring over the course of the night. I appreciate the subtle moss-like tones and the balance. Fruit beers make me nervous about sweetness, but this one is in check. I would like a little more carbonation, though."
"D= Not a bad ale, and would be very refreshing outside on a hot day. Very cool to try a historic beer style like this."
"An interesting take on a wheat beer. The gooseberries add a decent mix of sweetness and sourness to the flavor. The wheat seems well balanced. It's smooth and drinkable. This ale does not taste like a typical fruit beer."
"enjoyable, but again not an ordinary ordeal"
"D: Highly drinkable, not too complex."
"Overall a mellow ale. Delicate flavor and an alternative when something lighter is called for."
"a bit thin, but smooth. gentle carbonation."
"Pretty cool that it doesn't seem ancient or extreme in any way. Could be a pleasant wheat beer for any brewpub."
"Pours a straw yellow and peachy color, slightly hazy with a thin white head. Smells of wheat malt, fermented fruit and berries (almost a bit of chemical, wine-like fumes) and funk. The ingredients listed include: ""malted barley bree, wheat, gooseberries, bogmyrtle, [and] hops"". Tastes wheaty and sweet like wild berries and fruit, maybe even the slightest tinge of dark fruit/raisin involved, and a light astringent bitterness felt in the back of the throat. Fairly sessionable with light flavors, and a light to moderate slightly creamy mouthfeel. Don't let the oddness of this brew intimidate you it's pretty easy-going."
"pours up a clear, solid gold color with basically no head. the nose is very faint. subtle berries (gooseberries?), a lil wheat. taste of gooseberries?, wheat, subtle spice in the finish. light bodied, low carbo. this is definately a unique and sessionable brew!"
"So this is the third beer from the ""Ancient Beers of Scotland"" mix pack I got. Enjoying it in a hefeweizen glass. Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a wee head that melts quickly. Smell is sweet and floral with some honey and what I guess are gooseberries? Taste is suspiciously like their Heather ale, hmmmm. That sweet floral taste with some honey mixed in but mot that dried flower pedal aftertaste like the Heather Ale. Goes down fairly smooth with a tongue coating quality. I'd say a good after dinner treat."
"Don't know what to make of this ..."
"Overall - A very nice and slightly different brew... as i said this would make and excellent summer beer... well worth a try..."
"Very drinkable and good. Recommended.."
"Drinkability : not very common beer, in the Scottish gruit style"
"A medium bodied brew that is a little yeasty and sweet with a decent malt finsih. A very smooth brew, mostly a frtuiy wheat beer. I wouldn't mind having this again, but I thought I'd be getting more."
"Not sure why nobody on this site seems to favor this one too highly -- it's one of my favorite warm-weather brews. Easy drinking, with a bit of a flowery nose and a sweet start to the tongue before opening up to something more complex. It's fun to take the tastebuds on a history tour, as well."
"This is a decent fruity beer that is definitely worth a go."
"D - This beer is light and refreshing, but its medicinal qualities limit its overall drinkability. It starts out pleasant enough, but there is a lingering quality of bitter, chalky herbs that makes me less than eager to go in for another sip. It was interesting to have it once, but I don't see any reason to ever have another one of these."
"Pours a clouded gold with minimal head that doesnt stick around long. Nose is like berries and leaves. I dont know exactly what gooseberries are like, but I am sure that is what I am getting from the fragrance. Flavor is inky and sweet with a mild but nice berry flavor. Feel is pretty standard. Definitely drinkable, but of course is very unique. Might not be for all, but I certainly like everything this brewery puts out."
"Tastes clean and refreshing. I have never had Gooseberries but I think thats what I taste along with wheat and some malt. Another different experience from a brewery that I enjoy."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, mild kick, this really isn’t a beer that I would prefer to drink too many, the flavor just didn’t appeal to me."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden straw color with very little head. Smells of some faint floral spices but I'm not sure what they are. Taste is very mild. Can taste some of the spices in it but not very pronounced. And the gooseberry . . . that was almost non existent, possibly some tartness from them but not much of anything. In spite of it being a fairly bland and average beer I could easily see this as a summer quencher because it is so light in body and flavor. It goes down easy but nothing to get excited about."
"Very easy to drink, and certainly enjoyable, although I expected more tartness from the gooseberries. Not as unique as the ingredients promise, but still a solid, interesting beer. Give it a whirl."
"Pours a nice golden, with a slightly cloudy look. A small bit of head and little lacing, but not bad for a bottled wheat beer. It has a nice scent, a very sweet wheat with a slight fruit tang. Excellent taste, a nice malty wheat beer with an excellent unique (gooseberry) flavor, along with some nice hints of spices, most notably what I pick up to be coriander. Goes down very well and is a great ale."
"Well chilled I could toss an armload of these back. Anoter winner from the Scots."
"I usually do not like fruit in my beer per se, but the tartness the gooseberries added made it rather enjoyable. not something i could or would drink every day, but worth keeping a bottle or two around."
"Highly recommended"
"D - Nothing too complex but still an interesting, highly drinkable beer. Shame I've only seen it at one place"
"500 ml bottle, at Blackfriars, Glasgow, as ""Grozet Lagered Celtic Ale"". ABV is 5.0%. Brewed with crushed gooseberries. Golden colour, slightly hazy. Moderate head. Nice aroma of hops and gooseberries. Lagerish flavour (drank it too cold though), with moderate but decent hops and notes of gooseberries."
"d: this was a very different brew. rather easy to drink & certainly more tasty when it's real cold. like that the fruit flavor was subdued & worth a try."
"Overall Impression: Thirst quenching beer. I don't know what a gooseberry taste like but this beer, to me, could pass as being brewed with heather tips instead of hops. Great beer, well brewed but not on of those fruit beers that I would crave."
"12oz bottle from Ron's'. Translucent amber body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Berry dominates the aroma. A sweet and sour berry flavors come through with the flavor, with hints of malt. Lighter in body, but not thin. The berry is far from simple or bland, and it combines with the drinkability in this beer to make it a good easy drinking tasty beer."
"Overall, this is very intriguing beer. It's tasty and refreshing on a warm day. I'm not really familiar with the style, but it's enough to get me interested in exploring other examples."
"Drinkabilty- It was definitely a sipper it got better as I went along."
"D- Very drinkable! Very enjoyable."
"Very drinkable and sessionable for anyone who has enjoyed the supremely sour gooseberry off of the bush. Another fine example of how hops arent required to brew interesting and drinkable ale, as well as the grainy tastiness of this Scottish brewery. Definately worth trying."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark straw , with a white head - nose of straw , grass , floral , clove , and maybe soft berry quality  taste of yeast , wheat , some fruit/berry (blue) , and slight sourness - body is mild , refreshing , and with light carbonation  aftertaste of wheat , grasses , some fruit/berry (blue) , and refreshing"
"Looks like a cider,yellow alone. no sharpness in aroma however, a touch of wheat, adn the myrtle like a tea. No real visible head. Malted and wheat so no edge, indescribeable tea taste with a faint apple. Not too drinkable but worth the experience to see what people can brew."
"A bit of an oddity/novelty for a beer. Not something I'd take on a regular basis but worth a try now and then."
"Surely peculiar."
"Pours a clean light golden amber color with a thin white head. Spotty lacing in the tall pilsner glass. Nose is predominantly malty, with some sweet fruit and citrus notes going on. Over all, though, I expected a bolder nose for this one. There is just not much here. The palate is right along with the nose, unfortunately. Quite malty up front, with some notes of green apple, pear, and grape. Not very ""berry"" at all. All the flavors here are very subtle, leaving this beer oddly thin and uninteresting to me. Definitely not a challenge to the palate. Mouthfeel is thin ... too thin, slightly bitter and only lightly carbonated. Finishes dry. I feel like I should appreciate this beer more, given it's ancient origins, but this one is just wholly uninteresting to me. I had high expectations, and maybe I put too much into them, but I didn't enjoy this one. Maybe worth trying once, to say you did, but I didn't find much of anything here that is unique or particularly worth seeking out."
"By the way, what exactly is bree?"
"After the first few sniffs and tastes I wasn't crazy about this beer but I liked it the more time I spent with it. Mouthfeel is slightly watery with that very dry after taste that I mentioned before. The beer is fairly drinkable, but I'm not sure I'd have more than one in a single sitting. My only real complaint is that the beer isn't anything special to look at. Overall a decent beer."
"This isn't quite as good as the other offerings I've tasted from the brewers at Heather Ale, but I love the experimenting attitude of this brewery and attempts at reviving archaic recipes and ingredients. I prefer their elderberry, pine and heather ales, but this one isn't bad either."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Im not sure. This is weird. Um?"
"This beer pours very cloudy but is light golden in color. The aroma is very fruity, as one might expect from a gooseberry beer. The flavor is fruity and very tart, but that is almost overpowered by the sweetness which hits after the fruit. It is a very smooth with a farily light body. I'm not sure I would drink this again, but it was pretty good."
"drinkability is good. it doesn't really have hop bitterness to balance the alcohol, but there's lots of malt and a nice light fruity sweetness. really interesting beer that i'm definitely enjoying."
"Overall: A good conversation beer but little else. Good malt character, but overly thin. Worth a try."
"Nice color on the pour- thick head, sticky sweet aromas battle with grassy notes, some medicinal characteristics. Not too sweet, though the berry flavor is strong. Not sure if its the berries or some added wheats or herbs, but there is a pleasing sourness on the finish. Comes off dry, but refreshing- pleasing balance- the best of the multi-pack from this brewer."
"Pours a clear golden with a bubbly white head. Aroma of bubblegum and maraschino cherries. Taste was sour gooseberries and other berry flavours, lots of grapefruit and sourness. Mouthfeel was crisp and astrigently dry. A little puckering to drink a lot of, but still a very unique and refreshing character."
"Subtle citrus nose with spicy notes. Light and slightly carbonated. Refreshing, almostl lemony. A tangy balance with an unexpected complexity. Very drinkable. What's a gooseberry?"
"Drinkability: Different, but refreshing; another nice one from this very interesting brewery"
"A clear golden pour with no head. Interesting sweet nose with lots of berry and wheat. Very little carbonation that changed the flavor as it waned. It started sweet and had hints of cranberry sour at the end. After taste left me wanting to drink more. I like sour beers though. Good summer beer that is refreshing and simple."
"Overall, I don't know why this sample was lacking carbonation. Every else smelled and tasted normal. I will chalk it up to a bad sample and move on. Thank god I love gooseberries, which was well displayed in this case, not too strong and not too weak. If I can get a guaranteed fresh and carbonated bottle I will have to try this again."
"the overall drinkability is ok, but would only drink this beer occasionally, definitely not a session beer."
"Not a beer that I would have more than one of. Interesting brew."
"Golden-amber body with a frothy head - decent retention. Smell of cereal, some fruit, and of a lager. It doesn't have a skunk smell, but Heinekin came to mind after the smell. Body is light to medium. Taste of malt, some mild tartness, and a light hop bitterness. An average beer, fairly drinkable."
"Smells a little like Mary Juana and tastes a little like I'd imagine it would taste. Yeah yeah, I'm the last homo sapien who hasn't done the weed or pill thing. Hence my miraculous ability to say nothing of substance about the taste of beer. Oh well. What a funky little beer. Nothing like the other two Heather beers I've had. A foggy medium color with a synergy of bitter and sweetness accompanied by a menthol like face plate that straps you in for the ride whether you like it or not. It doesn't quite do it for me."
"Never really had a goosenberry beer before, but kinda liked it. A dominant wheat character sets the tone of the beer, but the berries give a rich and bold twist. Smells sweet with lemons, cloves and with the berries giving a grape, licorice aroma. Tastes rich with bready, yeasty, lemons, bannanas, cloves and with the same rich berry taste that gives a complex raison, blackberry sweetness, spiciness, and tartness. The berries give off a character similar to Belgian Strong Dark malts. Interesting, but odd in a Wheat Beer. Feels rich and creamy but cut nicely by the tart berries. Sweet and tart in the finish. Interesting, but just a little too unusual to rate highly."
"The brewer has obviously acheived their objective of mingling native Sctotish herbs/plants with traditional brews...very nice delivery."
"It's most distinguishing characteristic is its uniqueness. Not really my thing - a little too herbal and medicinal for my personal taste, but that's to be expected for style. Worth drinking for something different."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable. A tad on the light side perhaps, but it's still flavorful and interesting, so the lightness helps drinkability if anything."
"This is not as rich as the same brewer's Fraoch heather ale but certainly a pleasant and interesting diversion from the normal ales I quaff."
"All in all a very good ale with a unique flavor that is pretty smooth."
"An interesting brew, and quite enjoyable. Nice for a change of gears once and a while."
"Overall this beer is unusual and interesting. Worth the experience but a little too sweet for my pallet."
"Not to bad overall, would enjoy drinking this again. Very different."
"You can check my other reviews and see that I do, indeed, enjoy good and interesting and exotic beers. Not this one."
"Tastes more herbal then anything. Almost tea-like with some grape-ish qualities. Sweet at first, before turning slightly tart, it finishes kind of dry. Malts and wheat seems to be somewhere in there as well, but the herbal tea quality of thism is definitely the most dominate flavor. Fairly drinkable, with a smooth, medium-body."
"Pale golden / light straw colored in appearance, head is evanescent. Aroma is notably fruity up front, estery and vinous with hints of green apples, pears, and green grapes. Herbal qualities to the nose, as well as a bit of grass. Some pale malt in the nose, as well as the typical wheat aroma, along with very slight yeastiness. Flavor is smooth up front, but the grainy wheat comes in quickly, coupled with a lingering bready malt flavor that is felt more than tasted. Overall impression of the flavor is its herbal quality. Fruit comes in a flash of sweetness, but quickly moves to a slighly acidic flavor that lasts into the aftertaste, causing a minor drying effect, along with a bit of sourness. Much more tea-like than wine-like. A bit of spiciness balances the acidity, and mixes with the returning wheat flavor. Another interesting & ancient brew from Heather Ale."
"Taste; very herbal with a somewhat weet profile from the gooseberries. The wheat doesn't quite stand out as much as I would have liked, and there's a strange aftertaste, that I can't quite place, that I'm not really enjoying. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and the aftertaste makes this a bit hard for me to drink. This is something that I won't be seeking out again."
"11.2 oz bottle. Pours a murkey oranged khaki color with just a minimal head that falls to sparse wisps over top of the brew. This one is pretty hazy, with no apparent carbonation. Nose is definately fruity, what I have to assume is gooseberry, with a light spiceyness playing in there. Flavor is a nice blend between a good fruityness that fades to a moderately creamy and lightly spicey wheat character. I don't think that gooseberry is ever going to be a favorite fruit in my book, as the flavor is just not my bag. It doesn't seem flawed, I just don't enjoy it as much as I could. Feel is moderate with just a hint of carbonation. I'd like a little more bubble in this one, as it would add some sharpness that I think would work well with the flavor. Overall, this one is okay. I don't think I would do gooseberries in a beer, but if I hadn't tried this one, I'd never know that. Good show for giving it a try."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I will go back to this one."
"Mouthfeel was thin, moderately carbonated, and just bland. Not drinkable for me, I had to pass this one off to my mom, who liked it lots. Otherwise it would've been a drain pour."
"D: This has to be the most unique beverage that I've ever had, and I have no idea as to what to think about it yet. Is it bad? No. Is it good? I'm not sure. Is it worth trying? Absolutely."
"D - Well, it isn't hard to drink, but there really isn't much to it. The flavor is weak, but if it were any stronger it wouldn't be pleasant at all. The smell would be nigh unbearable if it were stronger. I would get sick of it after a few. A subpar beverage this is."
"My first beer of this style, and was quite unique, especially with the gooseberry flavor."
"Moderately amber in color, very sweet smelling - gooseberries are immediately noticeable. The berries are also heavily noticeable in the taste and the finish is citrusy. A nice brew, nothing spectacular. This would be nice in the summer as it is quite refreshing."
"I had good expectations for this one, and they were surprisingly met. This is a good brew for all seasons - light and refreshing, with enough body and character to keep your palate interested. Recommended."
"Hazy gold, thin frothy lace. Buttery, herbal-tea nose with just a hint of the wily and elusive gooseberry. This particular berry flavor follows through more in the flavor, and balances the bitterness from the herbs oh so very nicely. Dry and grassy at first, but does yield quite a strong malt profile considering the other flavors going on here. Reminds me very much of Heavyweight's Juhlia, and even moreso? A real Snakebite like you'd get in a real Irish pub, complete with the black currant on top, though certainly not that sweet. Carbonation is a bit lacking but I'd barely noticed due to the overall enjoyment factor I'm getting from this. Quite refreshing and an easy drinker for sure. One which I'd certainly quaff innumerable amounts. Cheers to the Scots!"
"poured a slightly hazy medium amber color with modet white head that rapidly fell to a thin ring. Smell is very difficult to describe. At first I thought it had a wine-like scent, then again maybe it was lime-like. Maybe this is what a goosebeery smells like?? I like it but i'm not sure why. Taste is very ordinary with maybe some medicinal?? notes. Very unique. Finish is very thin and a the flavor quickly dissapears. An OK beer, but not really something to try again."
"D: Fruit aroma is enticing, easily approachable, not too filling, and not too fruity."
"Drinkability: I think this is the first time I can say I've had gooseberries before, even though technically it's not physical gooseberries. Still, a beer that I'd suggest to try, as this is not something you encounter every day. But it's good, tasty, and thirst quenching. It's always good to keep your taste buds in check and flexible, too."
"This didn't really come together for me. A little to sweet and cloying. Bet you it went like gang busters a few 100 years ago"
"Not something I'd drink on regular basis, but great to try and definitely worth looking up for something different."
"Clear clear clear golden color. Pretty but a bit boring. Smells like... stale cigarettes. With lemon. Yeah... so... um... Taste- better. But better isn't really good. Tastes like dirt. Stinky cigarette-infused dirt. Mouthfeel feels kinda dirty, too. Grainy and not smooth. Not that drinkable. It just... it's dirt. This is beer dirt. Dirt beer. Yech. And it's fresh, it says it's fresh... this must be a big burly man Scot beer."
"D - Easy to drink, good everyday beer (if it was easier to find/cheaper).This beer isn't going to spur the microbrewed grozet revolution, but it's interesting."
"Notes: I find this one both unusual and highly unique. Im glad that I tried it once, but Im not sure Id revisit it for awhile. In spite of the high drinkability, I usually prefer something with more complexity. However, any beer aficionado should give it a shot, especially if you can find the whole gift set its included in."
"not a bad beer, not great. i'll try the kelpie next and continue to let the style work on me."
"This is definitely a slammer. It's not real complex, and I would personally like more of everything, but for the style, it's damn good. Recommended."
"D: personally I find it very interesting, but not so much as enjoyable, almost like fermented juice w/o the sweet edge. Need to try more of its kind to get used to it I suppose."
"Not much to look at, but this a prime example of not judging a book by its cover. Recommended."
"This is a good spiced ale from Heather. Its definitely worth a try, very unique and good use of unconventional ingredients."
"This is an interesting beer and would be refreshing on a hot afternoon. It is not a session beer, but one that I would enjoy again in the future."
"Keep it up alewives!"
"An very interesting, different and yet well crafted beer."
"Pours pale yellow in apperance with absolutely no head. Aroma is of dough and bread and wheat. I sure don't taste any gooseberry in this beer. Taste is thin without much substance. A bit of cardboard taste. Maybe a hint of cinammon or other spice. Beer indicates that it is good to 2008 but I wouldn't want to age or mellow this much more as it is already pretty docile."
"Appearance was a clear gold, almost khaki color. For a lager, I was surprised by the head retention - very full and lingering. Had a delicate, fruity smell that was very subtle. Initial taste was a very faint fruit with a surprising hop finish. Smooth on the mouth but the unfamiliar fruit taste requires some adjustment. Not sure I would have a few of these in one session, but definitely worth a try. A very interesting lager beer."
"I found it hard for me to drink this beer. It wasn't a bad beer, it was just a beer that wasn't very appealing to my tastes."
"This beer can be at best described as ok. It's not worth 2.59 a 11.2 bottle. It's basically very close to hefewiezen with some subtle differences. looks a hazy yellow. Smells of some sweet wheat. The taste is wheat malt with some different flavors in there, some sweet gooseberries. It's good and i would get it if was cheaper, but it's too subtle to comand that price. With a shot just don't except anything that different or anything."
"Grozet Gooseberry & Wheat Ale (good use of an ampersand) is a wonderful example of the gruit style. Some may find it bland and uninteresting, but I respectfully disagree. This is yet another beer from The Brewery Craigmill that I've found to be fascinating and remarkably drinkable. Perhaps after a few more bottles, ol' Robbie's verse will start to make sense."
"Not very impressed by this one. I've yet to have a spiced ale from the UK (or anywhere else for that matter) that has impressed me, despite not going in with any expectations. I think I'll give this style a wide berth from now on."
"Clean finish, a slight alcohol residue. Definitely will have again."
"Another cellared bottle from my stash, so Ill try and compensate for its age (at least 4 years old): Pours a dark murkish brown with a thin head. There is a nice berry smell. The taste shows a slight amount of oxidation, and a malt character that has deepend. Berry taste is slightly too sweet for gooseberries, but then it becomes more tart toward the finish. Any hop character is severly diminished, but I could have thought there were other bittering agents at work. Interesting, and Id say its aged out pretty well."
"Hazy caramel colour with a thin white lace of foam. Herbal aroma with some malt slightly hidden, also some white wine-like grape. Grainy malt flavour and sweetness, grapes, perfumy character, quite crisp. Finishes dry with fruitiness and slight bitterness. Low carbonation, medium body, initially crisp from the carbonation, but becomes more slick towards the finish. Interesting, unique brew to say the least, lots of flavour and quite drinkable."
"Pretty boring overall. I will stick to this brewery's Heather Ale, which I really enjoy."
"Body is medium with tiny bubbles lending to a creamy smooth mouthfeel. An interesting and tastey brew worth checking out."
"The tiny bubbles make for a very nice and creamy mouthfeel. In the end, one of the better fruit beers I've ever enjoyed. The fruit, spice and beer flavors/characters are all there in just the right balance. While the flavors are complex, with more to discover with each sip, it's also a very refreshing beer that is quite enjoyable to drink (sometimes complex beers just are too much of a workout for the palate to drink casually... but this one can be both deeply appreciated and simply enjoyed)."
"Bottle: Poured a light hazy brown color ale with a nice beige foamy head with pretty good retention. Aroma of gooseberries is easily detectable along with some malt and weird spices. Sweetness is overwhelming and well balance with the malt. Nice refreshing drink with some originality."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color that is slightly chill hazed with a 1/4"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale wheat malt scent that is enhanced with gooseberries and a herbal aroma. This is a not a typical brew aroma, but it isn't a bad one either. The taste is decent. It has a fruity pale wheat flavor with berries in the finish as well as a herbel aftertaste that is dry and earthy. This seems like a nice alternative to the usual beer. This is a brew for the ladies or on the hot summer day. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine gruit ale. It has good flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"An unusual and enjoyable beer which would work very well indeed as a refresher on a hot summer day."
"Pours a cloudy gold color thats a little darker at the top. There is very little head, even when poured directly into the glass. Interesting lacing...big bands that stay there even after you have begun sipping. The smell is weak, but hints at fruits and/or berries. Not much carbonation. The taste is flat as well...there are subtleties of berries (""Gooseberries"" I presume) but nothing that jumps out at you, so nothing that could be called anything special. GCLARKEAGE was correct in saying that it had a ""tea-like quality"" and that it is very smooth, but not what I would expect from a beer. This would be a great beer if you wanted to sit back and relax with something light, and aren't looking for anything that is too hard to swallow. Actually pretty enjoyable if this is the case!"
"Taste: Malty, almost cookiedough sweet, wheaty with a slightly acidic fruity finish. Just about no carbonation. Not too shabby for a primitive Hefe, but I'll stick with the mordern version."
"Easy drinking ale with an enjoyable flavour."
"Drinkability- I could drink these all night long. A great lightly fruited taste. This would be a great summer beer IMO. Will be going back for more of these. My favorite type from this brewery. Although, the seaweed ale and the Pine Scots are also quite refreshing too."
"OverallI am glad I tried it, but it was not stupendous."
"Grozet pours a hazy, barn straw colour. Head is almost a violent sea foam thickness, one finger thick and everlasting. Not much lace, just a little bit of foam that sticks to the glass. Smells more like a wine than a beer. A dry, fruit scent mixed with berries and heather. Their is a malt presence as well, which is the only indication my nose detects of this being an ale. Now, for taste, I must warn. This is my first time having anything gooseberry. And I've come to the conclusion I don't like gooseberries. So I must say, I don't like the taste. However, this is supposed to have the gooseberry flavour, so I won't give it a low score simply for containing something I don't like. Would it be fair to give an IIPA a low score if the reviewer hates a hoppy flavour? No. Strong gooseberry taste. I find anyways. Dry wine flavour as well, reminds me of a good red. Wheat, barley, and a bit of heather and honey as well. Mouthfeel is dry and a little granular. Drinkability is tough, for the same reason taste was tough. Would I drink this again? I doubt it, unless I aquire a taste for gooseberries. Personally, I'd give drinkability a 1.5. But, I gotta keep in mind the style of beer this is. I'll give it a three. Why? Well, if it wasn';t for the gooseberry, that's what I'd give this beer. And, if ever I do get an appreciation for gooseberries, I'll edit this review accordingly."
"Mouthfeel, like the taste, is light. Not much body or carbonation at all. Drinkability though is very high, but I'm not sure why anyone would want to have many of these. I'm happy to check out new styles, but there really is not a lot of good things I can say about this beer."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent beer. I think I prefer a heavier beer most of the time, but this was an excellent drinking experience."
"The taste was definitely different, this is definitely a wheat tasting beer along with a slight flavor of hops and herbs at first then sweet/tart fruits and a finally long a vinious dry hoppy finish. It was wonderfully complex, though one of these is all I could drink at a sitting,"
"Tastes of wheat malt. Is quite dry and crisp. Finish is sour and lightly piney/floral. I am guessing the odd taste at the end is the gooseberry. Not a bad flavor really but where is the rest of this beer. mouth is a bit thin with a bitter aftertaste. Interesting, but leaves me cold."
"There's not much to this beer. Mouthfeel is lacking, beer is flat."
"This is my reward beer for taking the GRE today. Purchased as part of a sampler Heather Ale Ltd. 4-pack for $8.99. Color is hazy golden-orange with light, frothy head. I can smell the gooseberry in the aroma, makes the beer smell a little like juice or flavored tea. Taste is slightly, but enjoyably tart, probably the effect of the gooseberry. Not much of a malt presence, but some nice herbal flavors. Mouthfeel initially has some bite, but finishes very smoothly. This is very easy to drink, I wish I had a few more for tonight."
"Pours a light golden with a decent white head that left some trace amounts of lace,very effervesent (spelling?) aroma like a spring meadow along with a touch of citrus very pleasing to the nose.Taste is delicate lightly sweet with a lightly toasted grain note a little tart in the finish but light.This would be a good summer refresher I think light and delicate glad I had the chance to try this."
"What starts off as a bland tasting fruit tinged wheat beer suddenly pops with what is presumeably the fruity flavour of gooseberries (sort of like tart grapes). Has a bit of a sour finish. Light body, moderate carbonation. Not really my sort of thing."
"The feel is a little thin, but still enjoyable and easy to drink. I'm still trying to figure out what a gooseberry is."
"Pours out a cloudy, pale, urine color with virtually no head. The aroma is a subtle wheat with a fruity background. The taste is definately different, and I am not so sure that is a good thing this time. There is nothing as far as taste goes. It is extremely flat tasting and the wheat presence almost seems rotten and stale. There is a bit of sourness followed by a dry, earthy, dirt-textured taste. I cannot think of anything positive to say about it. Glad that I got a chance to try this style of beer, but my god, this stuff is pretty bad."
"Very interesting and refreshing. I found myself enjoying this."
"I was rather excited to try this one, as much as I love the wheat beers. Poured a very cloudy amber color. No head, just some little bubbles around the edge. It looked thick, like a really good apple cider. You know the kind you get on those side stands in the mountains. Smelled sweet, fruit like. Apple-ish, but not apples. I thought the taste would be as cool, but yuck. Very tangy, almost spoiled tasting, like spoiled green apples with pepper, lots of carbonation, but where's the head? Not a good feeling in the mouth, I can't help but wonder if this beer is any good. It's expiration date is June of this year. But surely it's still good. I let this sit on the counter, and it got somewhat warm, it is a little better than cold, but I think I'm going to have to dump this one down the drain. Man, what a dissapointment! I think I'll try somethiing else."
"Light bodied, very different and interesting, but not something I'd drink very often."
"Light and easily drinkable for kids of all ages."
"A good pleasant flavor, wheat notes and malt hints. Fruit subleties that go from sweet to a slight tartness in the finish. If it were sweeter and not so thin (not that it is watery) it could be a desert beer. I do not think I would have this with a meal. Maybe some cheese or pie."
"Hard to describe the aroma of this beer - tangy and citric - I'm tempted to say lemony, but that's not quite it. Bright and lively flavor. I was expecting this to be pretty sweet, but there was just a tinge of sweetness, with a hint of red berry in the middle. A little powdery at the end, and a fairly pronounced bittersweetness that meshed well with the fadeout of the berry notes. Unlike any wheat or fruit beer I've had - an interesting excursion."
"Sampled 4/29/04"
"Overall, it's certainly interesting, I'm glad I tried it and I'm looking forward to the other brews in the pack, but not something I'd go out of my way to try again in the near future."
"Love my wife, but the other beers in the boxed set were better!"
"The finish has an odd tinge to it, more like a juice than a beer."
"Refreshing looking golden/orange with good splotchy lace and a soft/just capping head of snowy, somewhat creamy white. Aromas are at once both fruity and malty, redolent of peaches and cream. Medium bodied with a tangy, lively tartness that is cleansing, lingering and very refreshing. This brew exhibits a winey character with elements of New Zealand sauv. blanc-gooseberry. Malted hot cereal with butter, some red fruits and creamy peach flavors round out the taste profile. I like this as it is very unique, complex and satiating."
"This beer might be past it's date, so take this review with that in mind. It poured a cloudy yellow color with some sediment present. It formed a small foamy off white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, herbs, wine and possibly gooseberries. The flavor was of hops, wine and gooseberry. The finish was a bit sour and astrigent. Not as good as the heather or the elderberry, but a newer batch might prove better."
" This is my least favorite of this brewery's odd offerings. Too many bitter flavors going on here, and I can't even identify the culprits. I compliment the brewery for experimenting with these ancient styles, and I will continue to try these. Certainly, this is ale is one that is not mainstream, and might be worth a try."
"Interesting to try, but doesn't get me worked up in any way."
"A really enjoyable drink and probably my favorite, besides the Fraoch, from Heather Ales."
"As usual for Heather Ale, this is an unusual beer from the bottle, to the smell and taste. Best before date is October 2004. Ingredients are listed as: ""Malted Barley Bree, Wheat, Gooseberries, Bogmyrtle, Meadowsweet, Hops."" To be honest, I have no clue what Bogmyrtle or Meadowsweet is. Always ready for a new experience, I pour it. It's a slightly hazy gold with a small layer of fine yeast at the bottom. The white head is fairly thin but leaves a trace on top to the end. The smell is assertively fruity but not overly sweet. It also has an interesting herbal/medicinal smell. The taste is vaguely berry-like, but the flavor sort of lingers on the back end. The hops and herbs battle on the tongue for attention. Although it's a nice experiment, it's not the type of beer most people will want to sit and drink all day."
"A very different type of brew...cloudy, unfiltered light cider appearance, minimal lacing...some fruity bouquet with grapefruit and grape aromas. Taste was different...fruity, then tart on the finish, medium body....refreshing. Mouthfeel was good with the lightly tart finish giving it a rounded quality. Easy enough to drink, though a few would be just about right as the flavor is just a bit unusual."
"Drinkability: Buy it if you see it, it's that good. Also, this is the first time outside of a dictionary that I've seen the word ""convivial"" used, it was printed on a little blurb on the label, I showed it to a few people and we all got a good kick out of it."
"This is a relatively ordinary looking pale lager in colour and characteristics. The smell might lead to some early suspiscions of something odd going on here, something which is reinforced by the first taste. Of which there are two distinct parts as other reviews have noted, an initial ""grassy"" wheatish even taste and as it makes its way to the back of your mouth and throat there is quite a change. Spices and Goosberries (whatever they are or taste like!) begin to make their presence felt. To sum up, a tasty and different beer although I must admit not quite as bizarrely different as I might have hoped. (I might not have liked it half as much but I wish they'd left the hops out, - that would have been really interesting!)."
"drinkability for certain reasons lower. a nice beer in some ways but in other ways it also makes you say 'why?' it would probably make a good apretif with some shellfish or other seafood and cheese. a curiousity i recommend."
"Pours a hazy straw -colored liquid with a very thin lace on the goblet. The aroma of corn is paired with a peppery berry. A dominant yeast flavor starts off the brew with a lemony wheat spice. The entire impression of the ale is that of a clean and refreshing balanced brew. Very easy drinking and tasty with a peppery berry finish."
"Drinkability: Worth a shot on cask if you see it. I can't honestly say the beer is better for the treatment. Not anything worth seeking out, regardless. I had no problems finishing the pint I was given and could have had another, but I thought I should turn in."
"Okay, this one's a little hard to describe. Pours a pale orange color, with a deep haze. Very slight, almost non-existant head...big, balloon-like bubbles near the edge of the glass. The aroma is amazing...very fruity, but hard to place. The citrus twang of a wheat beer is evident in the aroma and taste, but it's subtle. There's a floral mix in the aroma too...I mean truely floral, like a flower shop. Tangy, perfumy, and soft. Truly unique and an absolute blast to experience."
"*This confuses me because, unlike Scots Pine, the Grozet does not contain pine or spruce sprigs. The only ingredient common to the two is malted barley bree, so perhaps that's the associating taste."
"Thx"
"I would go out of my way to buy another."
"If this brew had some continuity, it would be a real winner."

"A bit cloudy and honey color. Big head that quickly goes down to a skimmer across the top. Smell is nothing special..smells as I would think it would, fruity with a bit of honey thrown in there.Taste is mellow with no harsh aftertaste. Not a strong flavor nor a light one at that. Good taste, goes down easy. Could easily drink this with no problem one after the other. Not one of those beers that after drinking one that you are too full to drink anymore."
"Shockingly smooth going down, however, considering the flavor. And I do indeed taste a hint of gooseberry, so bonus points for that. Perhaps not destined to be on my standard drinking list, but certainly something I might reach for on special occasions."
"A vigorous pour yielded 2 fingers of white froth atop a hazy honey colored ale. Has a starchy muskiness to its aroma with slight citrusy wheat note. Head has settled down quickly and retains abit with lacing. Mouthfeel is rather flat feeling with a slight dryness. Flavor is completely unusual and a bit unpleasant. A bit sour and earthy with a staleness added to it. I'm not sure if I'll finish this one or not. Not a good tasting brew."
"The highlight for me is clearly the aroma. It's hazed, light appearance is an obvious prelude to the slightly wheaty, refreshing characteristics. But the nose is where it's at: An exotic mix of lemon, lemon balm, and rotting berries delights the senses and comes in waves to be savored and contemplated. The flavor is reminiscent of chewing on lemon grass and drinking chamomile herbal tea. Leaves a slight cottonmouth-ish feeling. The body is thin and slightly anemic. A little more carbonation and body would carry this really unique beer into the stratosphere."
"NOTE: OLD BOTTLE TASTED! Medium brown color, slightly cloudy. Small head. Aroma is fruity, more applish than berrish. A light bodied wheat. More apple cider like than beer. No real malt or hop taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is fruity. After notes were taken, I noticed the best by date was Oct 2000. This beer was tasted nearly 30 month after that date. Will need to re-taste with a fresh beer."
"Overall... I'm really not sure what to say about this beer. It was deffinatly interesting. Ale, meets cider, meets lambc. Not what you'd expect. In my notes I wrote gross but interesting, as if someone picked two styles of beer to mix together that shouldn't be mixed. It's not bad, but I probably won't be reaching for this on again."
"Nose of buttery, whole wheat and charred Alpine cheese. There is a smart, sunny tartness that lifts the ample maltiness and creates detailed, delicate balance. After sniffing at it for ten minutes from a wine glass there does in fact emerge a subtle smell of sweet, thick-skinned black berry. It is an enigma. The more I focus on it, the less obvious it becomes. A slight smoky graphite flavor emerges later too. Clean. hazel. dry dry."
"Thanks to JohynnyDuvel for the reunion!"
"For the BJCP style experimental or historical beer, I""d peg this around 4.5/5 - its very well done."
"It has the appearance of apple juice. That's not good. Overall it was a decent beer and I'm glad I experienced a gooseberry ale in my life. But I don't think I will be drinking this again anytime soon. It has a variety of flavors but they don't blend the best. I taste grains and a tartness to this beer. The gooseberries were definitely recognized, esp. in the aftertaste. This tasted better after the first couple of sips. Overall a decent, not terrific, beer"
"Overall: Different. Top Marks for recreating this brew style, and I hope it continues to be brewed so that others can try this auld Scots beer recipe. But, I for one will not be seeking, or even drinking, this one again though; its just not to my taste to be honest. Rather Disappointing."
"330 ml bottle. Best before date of June, 2004."
"Overall my least favorite of the Heather Ale products. Grozet has the least amount of complexity and character of their products. IMHO Grozet is way to thin for a re-creation of a 500 year old Scotch monastic brew. My hat is off to Heather Ale for their attempts of keeping historic brewing methods and ingredients alive; but this one needs to be reworked, IMHO."
"Overall impression: an interesting beer, no doubt... but to be honest I was a bit disappointed with it. I really enjoy their Alba Scots Pine Ale and the Heather Ale, so my expectations were high. Worth a try though, you might like it."
"a light ale and a bittersweet mead, this is definitely different from what you'd normally pick up at the gas station. It's not something that I'd drink every day, but definitely something that I'd think back to from time to time, and remember fondly."
"Pour is pale golden, with a small white head, quickly diminishing to nothing. Aroma is fruity and sweet, hints of banana. Flavor is mildly spicy, fruity, and quite sweet. Body was on the light side, strongly carbonated, finished clean. Fairly boring and unimpressive."
"Pours a light golden color, very clear. I was expection more out of this one. I bought it along with Fraoch, Ebulum, and Kelpie. Those three had some great flavors in them. This one is rather bland. I can sense just a touch of berry in there, other than that, it's just a little sweetness. Very easy to drink though, I could definitely drink a few if need be."
"Pours out a cloudy straw color with a bit of head. Light and sweetish... Tastes of berry and some other malts. Nice flavor balance. This is a very good brew for a fruity beer. worth a shot certainly. I could see how this could be a favorite brew for some lucky BA."
"Cheers"
"Crystal clear amber color on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the lace adequate to conceal the glass. Malt the major aroma, with an underlying ripe apple sweetness, start is quite sweet with adequate malt, top is skeletal. The finish has a ""Wee Bit of Hops", scarcely carbonated, and a dry lingering aftertaste. Not quite sure what I expected a ""Celtic Ale"" to be, but a bit more robust was one thing, disappointing."
"One of the tamer Heather brews (along with the Fraoch), but this is worthy in its own right. More of an interesting quencher than an experience."
"Poured a cloudy straw color with no head at all. A slightly fruity smell but no very powerful. The name is kind of fooling as you would think that it would be more fruity. Starts out sweet and ends a tiny bit sour in the finish, but still refreshing. I don't believe that I have ever had anything like this. I still think this is worth trying if you have never had it."
"Fairly hazy, light orange in color, with very low carbonation. No head at all to speak of from the bottle I poured. Tart, citrusy and very acidic aroma. The flavor is much sweeter than it would lead you to expect. Fruity and berry-like, with perhaps a hint of banana lingering in the background. The wheat flavors balance the beer out nicely, though, and prevent it from being cloying. Light-bodied, with a lightly sweet finish, with a mild berry aftertaste. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Good summer ale."
"This beer is straw colored and a bit hazy with a thin white head that quickly dissipates.  It has a slightly herbaceous aroma (gooseberries I guess. I've never tasted one before).  A light-bodied brew, the grape sweet tart flavors are obvious but do not overwhelm...balanced by crisp, dry grain.  Carbonation is tight, almost champagne-like.  This would make a good summer quencher."
"Poured a pale golden colour, slightly hazy due to the chill.  Nose is fairly sweet and tart.  The flavour had gooseberries, I'll agree, but I detected something of a more sprucey flavour.  Strange really.   We'll blame it on my stuffed nose due to the cold weather recently.  Still, I liked it.   And I'll have to try it again later.  I'm most intrigued by the bogmyrtle and meadowsweet which are listed in the ingredients...."
"Small brown bottle with September '03 expiration date. Pours a cloudy, pale, nearly peach color. Smell was somewhat metallic, and harsh. Very different. Taste was very oddly tart, overly tart, and highly acidic, to the point where my eyes nearly bugged out of my head.  There is a point when tastes fade from subtle to non-existant. This is such a case. Other than drinking a sweet-tart with seltzer water, I can't even describe this.  Very thin, watery, oddly metallic finish. Sorry I couldn't finish this one. It may be a bad batch, I read the article before drinking it, but just not for me. A horrible concoction never again to be sipped."
"I'm not sure if I like this beer... ... or I love it! Definitely unique. I wasn't sure about it at first. It needs to grow on you. Tawny golden color with a thin, lightly lingering head. I'm not sure of the aroma - I guess it's the gooseberry that's supposedly included. However, there's more of a citrusy side to it. It's not unpleasant, but curious. The body is light/medium and a slight tartness combined with moderate carbonation gives it a somewhat thin appearance on the palate. The flavor opens up much more than the aroma indicates with an odd, juicy, subtly tart character that is compelling. Soft and well balanced. Finishes with a lingering fruity dryness. Quite refreshing once you get past it's quirkiness. Not real complex, but memorable. A sleeper."
"I was less than impressed with this beer. The aroma was a little sour and overall not appealing and first sip reminded me vaguely of water (maybe because of it's lack of taste?) The second sip got better as did the following sips as I started to pick up more of the gooseberry flavor. Very little malt presence (says it's a wheat ale on the label)and the berry flavor dominates the flavor profile. After I had hit the halfway point, this beer becaem harder and harder to drink. Maybe I'm just not that big of a fan of gooseberries. Maybe I just don't like kool-aid mixed with my beer."
"Another interesting brew from Heather Ale Ltd. This one too follows the ancient style revival theme that other Heather brews do. Appearance is hazy gold with a dense head, suspended and precipitated yeasties. Lemon grassy, wheat aroma. Taste is very tart, crisp. I'm not sure I'd recognize the taste of a gooseberry, but the fruit seems to impart a sour, tarty flavor. Mellows a little when it warms. I can see this as a good warm weather brew."
"Thick, long lasting, creamy head - pour slow.  Tart but good.  Brewer puts it as a wheat ale with gooseberries but I couldn't taste the wheat.  I have no idea what bog myrtle and meadowsweet are or what they taste like.  Seems like it would be a good hot summer day drink.  The ABV is 5.0%."
"Notes: Another age old recipe brewed by monks and alewives since at least the 16th century. This is a complex, refreshing brew, with its mixed fruit characteristics. A ""must try"" for beer enthusiasts. ""Grozet"" is Auld Scots for ""gooseberry."" Brewed with lager malt, wheat, bog myrtle, hops and meadowsweet, then secondary fermented with ripe Scottish gooseberries."
"Not bad, pale yellow, little malt character, a little sourness from the berries. Not excatly my favorite from the Heather Ale Company."
