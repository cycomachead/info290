"Cheers!"
"O: Just OK for me."
"D - This was interesting, and I'm guessing this new batch is superior to the one(s) previously reviewed. It was very easy to drink and the heather tips were distinct but not overpowering. Not something I'd want often, but a pretty enjoyable gruit."
"Finish was smoother than I expected, like a good Earl Grey tea."
"Thanks to trbeer for delivering this one. Pours a one-finger cream head over a rust colored liquid. The beer is cloudy with floating bits, as I accidentally poured the sediment from the bottle into the glass. Smells earthy and floral (roses) and has some sweet orange. Has a vienna malt sort of taste with a downward acidic pull. Very aromatic and interesting. Tastes potently sour tart. Starts with cherries and pineapple. Sour green apple. Then an earthy tartness. Acidic and metallic. Has a dry sweetness below the potent sour. Throughout, there is almost an oily feel in my mouth that correlates with a flower taste. You know how roses smellthats what the floral tastes like. Medium to medium-light mouthfeel and medium-heavy carbonation. I'm truly amazed they were able to capture the floral essence so well in smell and taste. If they could tame that sour, this would be a truly fantastic beer. As is, I had a hard time choking down the last gulp."
"You really can taste what this beer is trying to be underneath, and Kuhnhenn's has served slightly off batches in the past, so I wouldn't be shocked if this isn't the desired final product. I kind of hope that's the case, really. Only OK -- by their standards at the very least."
