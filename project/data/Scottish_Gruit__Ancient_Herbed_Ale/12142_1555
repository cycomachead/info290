3.98,4.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Final Grade: 3.98, an excellent B+. Ebulum Elderberry Black Ale is one fruit beer I wouldn't mind having another glass of. I often find fruit beers to be one-dimensional at best, and barely beer-like at worst - but this particular offering has proven to me that when combined with some spice and a decent dark ale base, they have the potential to become much more interesting concoctions. I am now halfway through this brewery's 4-pack sampler, and Ebulum is the second brew to earn an enthusiastic thumbs up.","thehyperduck","Nov 08, 2012"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice fairly dense 1-2 finger khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of elderberry, roasted malt, toast, biscuit, chocolate, herbal, molasses, earth, and light spiciness. Pretty nice aromas with good balance and complexity; but are a bit weak. Taste of chocolate, elderberry, roasted malt, toast, molasses, bread, herbal, floral, earth, light coffee, and light spiciness. No bitterness noticed on the finish; with lingering notes of fruitiness, chocolate, toast, roasted malt, herbal, and light spiciness on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance and complexity; with a good amount of robustness and minimal cloying sweetness. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good ancient ale style. Good amount of fairly robust and balanced flavors; very smooth to drink. Very pleasant and enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Jul 21, 2012"

Aroma has dark roasted malts with a light fruitiness, really roasty like a porter with dark chocolate and a touch of coffee roasts. Flavor is great a big rustic porter labeled as a berry infused black ale, that works to. It still tastes like a creamy dark chocolate/roasted coffee beer. This is probably the best base beer with the ancient ingredients having less effect than any of the other ancient ales. Mouthfeel is medium bodied creamy texture very enjoyable with mellow carbonation goes down easy the glass literally drains itself.

Finger or so of bubbly mocha head sit atop this, a bit of sticky lace and mild retention. Nose has some roast, toasted/lightly burnt breads, some berry notes (elderberries I'll presume). Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Taste has more roast notes, dark malts, milk chocolate and subtler berry notes than the nose had presented. Slight metallic and smoke. Mouthfeel is medium, with a relatively low carbonation - similar to almost all of the other beers in this pack, but this doesn't detract from the experience at all, and almost makes this somewhat creamy. Although categorized as a gruit/herbed ale, this could pass as a black ale as well and is certainly much better than several I've had from that style. Nice.","liamt07","Dec 12, 2011"

A lot of molasses and earthy notes. Dark/fruity(elderberry,figs). Some roasted malt character but a lot of it is covered up by the molasses. Alcohol also cuts through the nose even though it is 6.5%. A carbonation tingle upfront with some elderberry fruitiness which leads to a metallic/sugary flavor. Shortly after roasted grains comes through with a subtle chocolate finish. Sweet and metallic at the end. Also very dry with a lot of the dark fruit characters coming through. A medium body with a good amount of carbonation.

I, like others, am not all that familiar with the taste of elderberries. However, the unique flavor of the berries (i think?) shines through without being overpowering or too sweet. It's fairly carbonated (which I was surprised about). It's not really very bitter, though it does have a slightly sour flavor (that could be the alcohol peeking through at the end). I enjoyed it. If it were readily available, it'd be an occasional buy, but not a frequent fridge addition. As part of that Historic Scottish Ales variety pack, however, it was a great addition (the heather beer is awesome).

Nice crisp, slightly bitter/sour finish, in some ways reminiscient of a dry stout. Medium-bodied, nice soft/creamy mouthfeel.

Normally, I'd agree with you that that sounds at least a bit negative, but this time is different. The gloom is indeed heavy, but there is a glimmer of clarity, some vague smoky garnet highlights that shine through with the sun's dying rays. Beneath this furtively optimistic sky lies a meadow engulfing me with scents of tart berries, rain-soaked heather, fresh raisins, and sugared figs. It's just the right combination of serene invitation and a wild admonition, like the rugged highlands themselves...or so I hear. Bobby Burns can be pretty persuasive. Diving in, those berries, not as tart as they initially appeared, have found themselves enveloped by heather, dark wheat, and tea leaves. It's as new and strange to my tongue as attempting to mimic the accent of the locals. Again, if you've read some Burns, you'll know what I'm talking about. Similarly in this vein, strange though it may be, it's not altogether bad. Just new and unusual. Luckily, the immense weight of the clouds overhead is not mirrored in this brew, which maintains a lightly medium weight that slides nicely along like that babbling brook running through the nearby lea. Like the craggy highlands, this is an acquired taste; if you can get into it, you'll love it, and if not, well, let's just say you won't be attending any local Gaelic Games any time soon. I'd recommend the experience, though.","TMoney2591","Mar 25, 2010"

It has a very strong roasted aroma with notes of coffee and chocolate. It's medium bodied and smooth with a light, clean finish that's a bit acidic.

Thin lacing on the glass. Smell reminded me a lot of Dr. Pepper soda, with a certain spiciness to it. Taste was not as unusual as I was expecting. At first, it had a roasted barley flavor to it, like a porter. But one you have a mouthful, you can really taste the berry flavor. Goes down with not a lot of aftertaste. Somewhat cough syrup like coating on the palate at the end. Smooth and easy to drink though. On the light side for a 6.5% beer.

In my mind, this is a tasty and well made porter with a good deal of milk chocolate smoothness. I can' fault it for its lack of elderberry notes because I have no idea what an elderberry is, but it doesn't really taste like any kind of berry to me. There is a gentle fruitiness that is not uncommon to any yeasty ale, but it doesn't immediately strike me as ""fruit"" per se. This is a really nice beer that I would buy a six pack of if it came in that format.

Cold pass for a fruity milk stout easily. Plus the herbal elderberry and chocolate flavors. Creamy smooth and medicinaly herbal palate. The interesting flavors make this beer not very sessionable.

This is a beer that could also be aged nicely as well as enjoyed fresh. The taste is dominated by the roasted malts, smokey and maybe a bit nutty. A hint of a metallic note, I suppose maybe a bit like ""Burtonized water..."" Finishes clean. There is a subtle spice at the end, that helps lend a clean balanced bitterness.

3.72,-2.1,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This beer is a complex melange of sorts. You'll start out with a very dark, almost porter like, color with very little head and only minimal lacing. The beer is medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. The smell is sweet molasses, charred wood, blackberry, maybe some cocoa in there as well. The taste is where the complexity really shines. It begins with a sweetish maltiness, a bit like caramel, berry, and tangy citrus. The mid section segues into a more semi-sweet chocolate, almond configuration, and ends with more of the burnt wood, smoky peat, and warming alcohol notes flavor. The mouthfeel leaves a bit of a film on the tongue, perhaps from the residual berry. The aftertaste is moderate and brings out the warming alcohol notes. Drinkability ... that's a question mark and it really depends upon the season and the dish that one is eating. Standing alone, this is a beer I wouldn't contemplate having more than one, but coupled with an entree, there are more possibilities I would be open to. This beer is characteristic of the Scotch ale style and would complement heavier pub fare. This beer is truly complex and for that alone, well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Oct 27, 2007"

The bouquet is, well, fruity. So THIS is what elderberries smell like! Interesting. I like this. I've never smelled a beer like this before, which makes sense not having had an elderberry beer before. Very pleasant aroma. I get some raisin and plum scents here too, as well as some apple scent. The taste is strange. It's really thin up front, but after it sits in the mouth and warms up a bit there is a noticeable change in composure. Perhaps it has something to do with the brewed qualities of the elderberry, but the flavor is very muted, almost nonexistent, at first. Then, after a second or two, the fruit flavors present themselves and the whole thing livens up a bit. Finishes fruity and tart with the slightest hint of hops. And then, after you think it's all over, it actually gives off a bitter coffee aftertaste. It's subtle at first, but the flavors here are much more complex than you think in the beginning. I am surprisingly impressed by this beer for a number of reasons. If you try this, be sure to let it sit a bit and warm up to really give the flavors a chance to make their presence known. Not exactly what I would call a session beer, but one that I would definitely try again. Would go very well with certain berry-centric desserts.","Atlas1","Apr 03, 2007"

Nice body. Overall a very well balanced beer. It has a great ""inky blackness"" to it and the fruit rounds out the whole thing. Would love to have this on draft.","lackenhauser","Oct 02, 2005"

Taste is quite complex: dark fruits, stout-like bitter malts, and a medicinal, tart berry with a prominant coffee ground aftertaste. It was hard to pick everything out. I would have given a higher taste score if the flavors meshed a little better, but still enough to keep me interested. Really reminded me of a sweet stout. Says it's a black ale on the bottle, so that's kind of vague. Mouthfeel was smooth, a little undercarbonated for my liking, but alright. I don't know if I'd want more than one or two of these, but it was a good beer, kept me interested throughout, and certainly worth a try.","Golden2wenty1","Sep 06, 2005"

Appearance is a deep purple, almost black body that shines a clear, radiant ruby hue when held to a strong light. Small beige head quickly dissipates, leaving no lace. Aroma is subdued, with dark roasted grain notes and a hint of berry. Light medium bodied with low carbonation in the mouth. Taste has a mildly bitter coffee note, porter like in nature, and a softness from the oats. Mild berry presence could be a bit more assertive in this one, but the taste is well balanced and pleasant to sip. I wouldn't mind having two or three of these at a sitting.","merlin48","Jul 09, 2005"

Vinous berry and woody nose, with noticeable malt and subtle smokiness. The sweet berrries come in early and move into slight acidity as the flavor progresses. I'm enjoying the roasted grain and smoke flavors as they coalesce with the vinous berries. A little chocolate is there as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but the flavor is big, and I think that sounds appropriate for what this beer is shooting for. Finish is a little dry, and composed mainly of roasted grain, with a bit of acidity. Long chocolately roasted aftertaste. I thoroughly enjoy these ancient beer styles from Brewery Craigmill, and this one does not disappoint. Hell of a specialty beer, and way drinkable to boot.","BeerFink","Jun 07, 2005"

Still, some strings of lace manage to stick around. Tart berries, lemon, bread, and oatmeal on the nose. Somewhere, their is a smell of a campfire. I'm not sure what it is though. Burning wood? Smoke? Food cooking over the fire? Simply complex, if that makes any sense. Big taste of tart wildberries and lemon mingle with a malty sweetness. The oats come through with their soft, subtle tones. Not very many hops I can detect. The tartness is commanding. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. The blend of sweet and sour makes this an after dinner beer.","slitherySOB","Apr 05, 2005"

Spongy tan head on the pour, big bubbles throughout, but it becomes more creamy as the ale settles in the glass. Sticky lacing. Coffee and roasted chocolate malt immediately on the nose, with a piney backbone to it, somewhat herbal, with notes of dates and currents, the aroma becomes a bit sour at the very end. Roasted malt and some espresso at first in the flavour, a herbal, woodsy taste in the middle, with bitter malt and some grassy, herbal notes on the finish, from the elderberries I would assume. The body texture is light, but the mouthfeel is smooth and a bit velvety, thanks to the good head retention. A nice sipping ale, malty with some herbal quirks, I enjoyed it even though I am not craving another one. I have a soft spot for herbal beers, and the Ebulum tickles it enough for the mean time.

It has a smooth and rich black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a slight tart elderberry taste. It's got a pretty unique taste. The mouthfeel is fine.

The malt takes on a chocolatey flavor midway through which compliments the elderberry extremely well. Fairly creamy, smooth in mouth. I was surprised how well I liked this beer.","mzwolinski","May 03, 2003"
2.57,-32.4,4,2,3,2.5,2,"This beer pours the blackest of black beers with a slightly red tone around the edges, almost no head and no lacing. The aroma reminds me much of a dark wine with hints of alcohol overpowering slight hints of fruits. The taste is very sweet and tastes of berries, but the alcohol is very apparent as well. This beer is too sweet for my tastes and the alcohol is very poorly masked. This is not a bad beer at all but I don't see myself drinking it again.","clvand0","Apr 27, 2003"
4.13,8.7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pitch black with a ruby glow visible at the edge of the glass. Dark roasted malt aroma with a ghost of chocolate. An interesting interplay of slightly tart flavors intermingled with smoky malt. Raspberry-ish notes ring out softly at the finish. I've had berry flavored stouts before, but this is the first one that really seems to work. Very tasty and drinkability is quite good.","Brent","Apr 06, 2003"
3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pours stout-like, not as thick though. Almost black, almost opaque. Aroma is kind of a sweet cocoa and coffee, pretty enjoyable. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I don't notice any elderberries, whatever they are. I taste mostly sweet maltiness and roastiness. It's an enjoyable flavor, but maybe not a beer I would get goosebumps for.","AudioGilz","Mar 07, 2003"
4.03,6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours out very dark with a light brown head. The elderberry taste comes through well. The malts are well balanced and the hops are light but enough to further balance the brew. Certainly worth a tasting as dark fruity beers don't come around too often. This beer would go great with a cherry or blueberry pie.","scottum","Feb 20, 2003"
3.58,-5.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer was given to me by a fellow bar patron who did not know what she was getting into. It poured a dark brown, almost black with a white head that held at about 1 inch. Reminded me of a Guiness. A different smell I could not put my finger on, I guess the elderberry. Licorace, almost Sambuca like, faint coffee, roasted malts. Very smooth mouthfeel, creamy, and dry. I'm sure a very drinkable beer, if you like the flavor. Interesting, but one was enough for me.","HopheadEd","Jan 30, 2003"
3.95,3.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours an opaque brown with highlights of garnet, the head passable in size, frothy in consistency, light chocolate brown in color, as it evanesces it leaves behind a thick and clinging sheet of lace. Lightly roasted grains, also the aroma of lightly burnt coffee beans, sweet and different to be sure. Start is loaded with malt, sweet, the top middling in feel, with the finish sparingly acidic, the hops personable but not overly so, very dry aftertaste. Quite quaffable, good but not great and well worth a sample.","Gusler","Jan 15, 2003"

4.1,7.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I really liked this beer. I had gotten it for my fiancee, because she likes sweeter beers, and I gave it a go. I was suprised in the way that they didn;t over sweeten the beer from it's alcoholy roots. They balanced everything very nicely. Good blackish/purple color to it in the glass. Had a nice semi-dry finish, but not too dry, so it went down nice and smooth.","JISurfer","Jan 02, 2003"
4.63,21.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Murky black color. Head was a dense explosive, beige pillow. Huge bubbles pop through. One of the more impressive visual beers I have seen. Think Imperial strout on the sweet side. Huge head left a foamy ring all the way down the glass. The smells were a rich, sweet combination of roasted plums, raisans, and elderberries. The elderberry tasted like an earthy roasted blueberry to me. Nice combination of fruit and carbonation make for an very tasty beer. Dark, rich, complex and full of flavors but very light bodied and nearly bubbly. A beer deserving of your attention. Highly recommended and very memorable. I was really impressed by this. A one of a kind fruit beer !","StevieW","Nov 12, 2002"
4.11,8.2,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"hmmm...  this is great.   Pours an incredible black color, slight tinges of brown around the edges, but you've got to look for them.  The head is short-lived and also darker than most beers'.  First whiff brings in a sweet smokey roasted sort of order.  Following this up on the taste are an initial authentic elderberry tang, followed by the roast flavour, and finishing up a moment later is a aftertaste like that of actual elderberries.  Kind of syrupy feeling on the toungue with a light spritzing carbonation.  certainly drinkable, especially with the bittersweet aftertaste.  A winner!","the42ndtourist","Oct 10, 2002"

4.12,8.4,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Black in color, and quite opaque. The head is tannish with what seems to be a pink tint. Unfortunately, the head is fairly limited and drops quickly, leaving an average collar and very limited lace. The aroma expresses a soft fruitiness which is quickly overshadowed by roasty notes. Very intriguing. The body is medium and the carbonation is light; giving it a soft creaminess in the mouth. The flavor starts a bit chocolatey, becoming a bit wine-like toward the finish, and leaves a lingering, lightly sweet and creamy berry flavor. Very nice, and quite unique. Well worth trying. Makes a great after dinner beer.","NeroFiddled","Sep 06, 2002"
4.03,6.1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Okay, this is the Heather Ale I been waiting to try.  Growing up on a farm, we had elderberrys and dishes made from them like pies, jams/jellies, crisp/crumble and of course wine.  So how does a beer version fair?  It poured out an amazingly dark color and had a dark tan head.  I had it at a warmeer temperature that may account for that.  Interesting aroma of malts and elderberry.  The taste definately had elements of Elderberry and chocolate.  A good dark beer.","Wildman","Jun 09, 2002"
3.7,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Eclectic and complex with a juicy sweet-tart fruitiness within, I’d put this in my dessert beer category and pair this one with chocolaty and / or fruity desserts. Certainly a specialty brew and nothing less.","Jason","May 25, 2002"
3.82,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Black as black can be in color. Opaque even when held to light. Little to no head after a vigorous pour. Deep, dark roasted malt aroma with the slightest hint of berries. Taste is again dark roasted malt with a predominate coffee bitterness...surprisingly so since one might suspect a sweeter brew. Finishes smooth, bitter. 11.2oz. bottle, BB date: June 2003.","John","May 20, 2002"
3.76,-1.1,4,3,4,4,4,"This is a really good black ale. Subtle dark malt character. low bitterness and just a hint of elderberry at the end. In my opinion it need more berries. If you enjoyed other beers from this brewery you have to try this one. If you are not into Heather Ale Co. beers you may want to try it anyway as it is a nice balck ale.","mattmaples","Sep 18, 2001"
