"O- Plaid to the Bone is a pleasant Ale that is a refreshing change from the heavily hopped brews I usually consume. It's got loads of pleasant sweetness without the hop-bomb to go with it. Although I can't say this will be a regular for me, it is a good brew and I could certainly see this as a summer refresher."

"Aromas of butter and toffee dominate the aroma and flavor. Light burnt caramel flavor. Little to no spice. There's supposed to be heather in here but honestly there is so much diacetyl in my glass I can't find much else. Not for me."

"Plaid to the Bone is pretty much just all skin and bone. It has a pale, frail, and plain profile that does no justice to its special ingredient nor the fantastic brewery that made it; hopefully Picaroons comes up with a different recipe for 2014 because they are capable of much better than this. This may be the first and only Picaroons beer I didn't truly enjoy."

"500ml bottle poured into pint glass. Very clear and pale with a lot of carbonation. Nice aromatic bouquet on the nose with a lot of herbs coming trough. Really pleasant flavor, well balanced and different because of the lack of hops. Really nice summer beer"
