"Overall : a good beer in the style traditional ale (old gruit)."

"O: This is a very flavorful and easy to drink gruit beer that is also a little more fuller bodied compared to other beers in the style."

"The beer pours a clear dark brown with no head and a touch of sediment. The nose is tame with a caramel sweetness and no distinct herbal characteristics. The taste is a mellow brown ale, sweet raisins upfront, with a nondistinct lingering herbal finish. The herbal flavors are slightly tomato-y with a slowly building, lingering, tangy, metallic finish. The beer is light-medium bodied characterized as being sweet, weakly herbal, drinkable, and completely uncarbonated. There is very little bitterness. This is a drinkable gruit, but I would have liked to try it fresh as the carbonation and herbal pop were both missing."
"I had this beer before and remembered it to be good, but in fact it is really good, excellent. I usually criticize the Jopen brewery for having too many different types that are all somehow special but not really balanced and just not great. However, with this recipe from 1407 they are doing everything right"
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, 18IC bottle code. Pours very hazy and cloudy reddish brown color with a 2 finger foamy khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a ring of lace. No lacing at all on the glass. Aromas of apple skin, pear, caramel, raisin, molasses, herbal, floral, pepper, clove, earth, anise, and yeast spiciness. Very nice and interesting aromas with good balance and complexity. Really wasn’t sure what to expect. Taste of big apple, pear, pepper, caramel, toast, molasses, raisin, herbal, floral, earth, clove, and yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of light fruit, raisin, caramel, molasses, pepper, herbal, toast, earth, clove, and yeast spices on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and flavor complexity; good malt/spice balance; almost zero cloying flavors present on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a fairly slick, prickly, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice imperial gruit ale. This was very interesting and I wasn’t sure what to expect from it. There is nice flavor complexity and balance; and it is quite smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable and unique offering."

"O: Like I've mentioned 10 times, soda/cola like. It's very nice, although barely resembles a beer."
"Pours a dark brown amber. Minimal head and no lacing. Nice dark Belgian aroma. Tasty dark malts with nutty flavors, dark fruit and unidentifiable, but pleasant herbs. Nice malty middle and finish. Medium bodied with creaminsess. Delicious. I really like this beer. Excellently integrated and wonderful."

"O- This is a great blend of characters with some faint flanders red hints and some nice bock qualities all come together. If I would have seen the date before I bought it I would have passed on it but it was quite a surprise to taste this good given the age on it."
""
"O: A very cool and different beer. The spices are very present and do their job well. My only complaint is that it's maybe a little too strong and would benefit (at least drinkability-wise) from being brewed to a lower gravity. Not sure if I'll be revisiting it any time soon, but it was definitely worth trying."
""
"You should try this one!"
"Overall, this is a nice beer. Didnt' think I'd drink the whole 750ml bottle...but I did."
"Exceptional example of what a gruit style has to offer. I was told that it is a 15th century recipe. If this is what beer was like before hops, then I say burn the hop crops and start growing herbs."
"D: I really liked this beer. first gruit beer ive had, so its hard to judge. but i liked it. would love to buy again."
"Bottle was a gusher and lost about 40%. Poured with large (!) tan head and good lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Aroma is a slightly sour yeasty malty spicey and bitter belgian style. Flavor's about the same. Decent body and carbonation (!) Slightly boozy at the end. Much better than the other Italian Chestnut beer I just had. But that's not saying a lot."
"D: Very drinkable and a very original one. Like a good dark trappist/abbey beer with a pinch of extraordinairy herbs. Will keep this one in stock."
"Overall a very good beer, not comparable to anything I had before. I read it is not brewed with hops in antoher review, but with herbs. The resulting spicy smell and taste reminds me a little bit of cough syrup, but than the nice one you can't stop drinking. A must try!"
"Nice gruit from Jopen. Pours a rich mahogany with a tna head. Nose has a nice collection of herbs along with nutty malts. Taste also has a nice grain profile, but the spice presence is a bit dull. Medium to full body, carbonation a bit high. Good example of the style."
"D: It's interesting to try this one, and imagine what people would think of it 6 centuries ago."
"3.5 M&3 D: slightly stimulating initially but overall quite smooth; the body is too thin and flavour too simple and timid compared with the promising aroma. I wonder if it's meant to be like this, and perhaps that it's nearing the BB date has to do with the lack of spicy intervention on the palate and in the aftertaste? It's an interesting brew all the same, though my curiosity and interest stops with this bottle (at 2.5pounds a bottle!!)..."
"sweetness almost approaches cloying, but overall remains quite drinkable, esp. with something like thyme-pepper-garlic seasoned lamb chops."
"The taste is of caramel/toffee with spicy earthy bitterness (and without hops!) Anise, nutmeg, cinnamon spiciness blends so well and mesh with the toffeeish malt, yet stops short of being over-spiced, and allows the maltiness to dominate, but in a balanced way. Alcohol is not noticeable in taste, though becomes quite warming after half-way through the 750 bottle. Earthy, complex, yet not overwhelming, with a nice maltiness. It has a creamy, medium to full body. Drinks dangerously smoothly, though slows down to a very sippable sipper! This is unique, interesting, and well-done!"
"Recommended. I can definitely see this being a beer with quite a history. I'd be curious to know how close this comes to the original versions. Unique - I like that."
"D: I split the 750 ml bottle with my wife. I would have finished the bottle if I were on my own. I'll definitely try this one again."
"D: I really enjoyed everything about this beer. It made me come back for more early and often."
"The Jopen pours a nice ruby brown mix and tops off with a nice thick three finger head. The smell was strong. It consisted of fruit, herbs, and spices. The taste was of berries, spices, herbs, and slight after notes of caramel. The mouthfeel was good. The flavors explode on the palate. It was very easy to drink with a little carbonation. I would definitely go for this again!"
"Taste is of alcohol (not well-hidden), some sense of dark sweet fruity malt, and a peripheral taste of the cinnamon from the nose. Aside from the alcohol, a very enjoyable beer, but the 8.5% should be better masked."
"Taste is caramel, tobacco, candy sweets and slightly sweet. A good maltiness and some flowery and spicy tastes. Could this be the gagel that I taste. I don't know how this tastes, but for me it is clear that this beer is really something special. The other tastes in here are so special that I don't know where they are coming from, but I don't mind, taste is good."
"Drinkability: I'm convinced I got a bad bottle. Will try to review again another time."
"Drinkability: As far as gruits go, this one seems to me more artificial. Actually, it makes me rethink how well crafted earlier gruits might truly have been."
"Worth a try just for the history but also enjoyable, even for a hophead like me. Alcohol content is not obvious but builds up a nice warmth over the course of a bottle."
"not the best example of a true gruit that i've ever had, more like a belgian ale. still, ill recommend this as a suitable starter beer for those intimidated by heavily spiced concoctions. makes room for depth and complexity while offering a solid malty brew in the background. good."
"Wine colour with a little lace. Light mouthfeel. Aged past expiry by eight months, and still quite drinkable, and likely mellowed. Tough cork to remove. Herbal and spicey, with clove and pepper, cinammon, good dark fruit soaked in there. Thanks Paul."
" Drinkability- I would not want drink another bottle until 2 hours after I had the first. This would be a good after dinner beer to have by itself."
"Pours a deep burgundy with a big fluffy off white head,wow the aromas are quite a treat cinnamon and clove dominate with a nice underlying cherry fruitiness both intermingle very well together.Seems to be quite complex,nutmeg and cloves really show up with a real grape juice flavor showing up with just a hint of green herbs in the finish.I have to say I have never had a beer taste so much like grape before it was rather pleasant.My second gruit and I really enoyed this one."
"My first Gruit, and I wasn't let down. Very interesting and amazing considering the absence of hops!"
"Amber with a quickly dissipating head. Nose is a blend of fruit, wine, malt and grassy elements...very nice. Tatse is excellent. Malt and alcohol on the front..belnding into a lightly biiter finish. Mouthfeel is suprising light for the high abv. Very easy on the drinkability scale, considering the high abv also. Some qualities of a Double...but without the abundance of port-wine like qualities. A very nice change of pace."
"Too bad for for foam and mouthfeel but all in all most certainly one I go for again!"
"Very slick in feel and flavor, rich in taste and texture, full in body and character...damnit, I like it, don't care what you say! I'm an unabashed fan of this stuff, and you can cuff me if you like, I'll still sing it on high (and try to procure a case for personal consumption!)"
"Chestnut brown, generous 1 inch light brown head, diminishing. Surprisingly cerealic aroma, like sweet wheat or oat cereals with a touch of brown sugar, accompanied with clove spiced toasted bread. On the tongue, the same show keeps on with that buckwheat pancakes alike malt worthy of praise. Very bready, incredibly well-hidden alcohol. Great alcohol hiding. Subtle yeast component. Fading balancing leafy bitterness. Medium body fits well. Well built."
"Corked 25 ounce bottle. The cork was near impossible to remove."
"After this beer was passed over several times, it finally hit the basket for the ride home. Poured from a 750 ml bottle, it's a murky reddish-brown with an off-white head that disappears almost immediately. It's not the most inviting looking beer in the world. However, its modest appearance is more than made up for by the smell and taste. Gentle fruity smells are backed up by a very nice herbal/spice smell. The taste strikes an intriguing balance of fruity sweetness and medicinal herbs. The 8.5% abv isn't immediately apparent in the taste, but a pleasant and slowly developing warmth announces the alcohol's presence. It's not an everyday beer, but it certainly is worth a try. History in bottle."
"Pours a deep, clear, amber-garnet color and it is topped by a thick light brown head. Aromas of crystal malt, dark fruit (cherry and raisin are most evident), hint of alcohol, candied fruit, and allspice. This beer has a rich creamy mouthfeel to it. The candied fruit is in the taste as well, but this beer is not overly sweet for it. The gruit herbs/spices are quite muted, I can't pick out any individual contributions. There is no real balancing bitterness here, though there is perhaps a light astringency in the finish. This is predominantly a fruity tasting beer, it tastes like a cross between a fruit cake and a spice cake. This would be an appropriate beer for a cold winter evening."
"I had this on tap in Amsterdam. I remember it being darker and a more intense. This bottled version was still an experience."
"It is a clear brown with a head that dissipates fast. The aroma is fruity and earthy. The medioum body is malty and has some fruitiness with some sweetness up front. It finishes with a peppery dryness. I really liked this gruit. It is not the first hopless beer that I have tried, but it is one of my favorites. It is excellent for a cold winter night."
"Overall, this is an amazingly interesting and complex beer, considering that it has NO hops. Hey if medievil beer was like this...send me back in time!"
"Beer poured with a tan, rocky head that resembled hardened, molded foam. The beer itself was cloudy and reddish amber. The nose consisted of fresh granny smith apples, but in a dusty cellar kind of way. Some brambly berries emerge, both in flavor and tartness, as the beer warms. The alcohol becomes apparent, too. It certainly was herbal in a wonderful kind of way. Nothing too over-the-top like once could easlity imagine a gruit being. Bready malt, slightly fruity, and a little toasty with a tea-like quality on the finish."
"Can't wait to age this one!"
"A very different beer this is enjoyable nonetheless. From the start to the finish this very different in taste and aroma. The look is dark thick amber with a nice tan head and lacing. The sweetness is balanced here by the fruity spices which appear in the nose as well. Cherry sourness, or rather, tartness seems to play off the maltiness in a way that limts the malt power. The feel is different and a bit hard to describe, but good just the same. Limited drinkability, I believe this to be an infrequent sipping beer, perhaps nicely paired with a dessert dish."
"This is a gruit, brewed without hops. It relies on herbs and spices to balance the sweetness of the malt. Cloudy. Brownish in color with a very fine and creamy 1/4"" tan head that holds very, very well and leaves some good lace. The body is medium with a very fine effervescence that makes it quite soft in the mouth. The aroma is fairly full with dark fruit, cherries, tartness, a lightly peppery spiciness, soft caramel maltiness, and some herbal qualities that I can't readily define. The herbs do give a drying quality and the beer is well rounded. Some fruity & herbal maltiness lingers in the finish, but it's not sticky as the tartness balances it. The alcohol is well hidden, only emerging toward the end of the serving. A very unique, interesting, and rewarding beer. Quite enjoyable. Much more balanced and mellow than I'd expected. Absolutely worth trying."
