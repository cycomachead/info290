"I definitely enjoyed drinking this beer. It had a fairly tasty and unique flavor. Given the cost and the rarity, this is likely not something I will get again, at least for a long while. Still, I love DFH's Ancient Ale series and love taking part in history by enjoyed these ancient brews."

"Overall, a light-drinking ancient ale with a magnificent history. Well-worth a try."

"Malty, smooth, refreshing. Reminiscent of a Barlywine but with a fruity twist. Very interesting...not bad, not bad at all!"

"Like the nose, the berry and juicy fruit flavors are the main thing one gets but then I pick up those roasted malts.  Mild bitterness.  A refreshing and easy to drink beer."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, I don't have a lot of the experience with this style, but when done right it's a style that I enjoy and after trying this beer I have no doubt that Dogfish Head did a good job with this beer.  It had good drinkability, it was smooth, not too acidic, crisp, the alcohol was hidden very well, slightly refreshing, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I don't think I would have a problem drinking the whole bottle since it's not really acidic and the alcohol seemed to be expertly hidden.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance, no single aspect ever got too overpowering, the balance was right where it needed to be.  What I liked the lest about this beer was nothing, there isn't a single thing about this beer that I disliked or would change.  I would for sure buy this beer again and I might consider seeing how it ages. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style or just tart fruity beers in general, it's for sure worth a try.  All in all I was happy with this beer and a little impressed, some of these beers from this ancient ale series were hit or miss for me, but this one was for sure a hit and enjoyed drinking it, it exceeded my expectations.  So far it's one of the better Dogfish Head beers I've had it's now my favorite of the style.  Good job guys this was one tasty, unique and interesting beer, keep up all the hard work."

"Definitely honey, faint cherry jolly rancher. Interesting."
""
"Overall:  A very interesting  beer, with a nice balance between the tart and sweet flavors; not something I am likely to try again, as the sweetness ultimately limits its drinkability, but I was glad to have experienced it"

"A solid effort overall. The berry and herb combination works better than I expected. I dig the idea of recreating ancient recipes for the modern world."
""
""
"I 'm not sure if I'd look for this one again but I'm glad I tried it once, I could've swore this was listed as a Kvass yesterday, oh well"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Since this is the first kvass I've ever had, there's no context for it. Still, this is an unusual beer with some great attributes. A typically off the wall Dogfish Head concoction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish orange color with a 1"" head that slowly falls. The aroma is of cranberry and other fruits. Big fruity flavor as cranberries and other berries create a nice flavor. Mild bitterness overall. Alcohol is well hidden here. Slow sipping but refreshing overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Overall a balanced beer. It tasted quite a bit like a hibiscus tea with hints of sweet-tarts and honey."

"Draft: Poured a reddish color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of berries and herbs is not the most enticing. Taste was also a weird mix between some berries notes, herbs with weird unrefined grainy notes. Body is light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting experiment but with such low drinkability I think I will avoid in the future."
""
""
""
"Orange-red color, good clarity, a few dishwater-like bubbles on top, but otherwise no head, and very little activity in the glass overall, indicative of low carbonation. In the nose, earthy wood, stale fruit, notes of cough syrup and solventy booze. I actually said *blech* when I took a sip of this. Rotten fruit, cranberry jam, cardboard, decomposing wood, a medicinal and almost vodka like booziness. Really messy, and the almost non-existent carbonation wasn't helping the mouthfeel either, which came off as slick and lifeless. Definitely couldn't drink this one, so I'm glad I only got a sample."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At first sip this played like a sour. The more I drank the more it seemed to open up. The cranberry is a bit more prominent than I'd like but I think that the subtle birch flavors play well with the fruit. Good body and quite smooth for how boozy it really is. I'm glad I made the purchase but I think one 25oz bottle will be enough for me."

"Initial reaction was non-plussed at first sip, but it grew on me more and more. There's a bracing grapefruit-rind-like bitterness on the back end that's really pleasant, and the fruit quite reserved, but there. I kind of wish they'd skipped the cranberries and gone all-lingonberry, as that would've fit the Scandinavian theme better. Herbs are well balanced, hard to place - either dill seed or caraway, maybe both in there. The more I drank the more it seemed to reveal - but most important, in a chilled glass it was just wicked refreshing on a hot August day. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, no doubts there. Gimmicky? Yes. A breakthrough beer experiment? No. Repeatable? Yes, for a pretty conservative price. Should you try it? Sure."
""
"I don't care for this beer in the sense of it being tasty and pleasing to drink. I love this beer in the sense that DFH allows me to take a journey back to fermented beverage history. Thanks for brewing."

"As a man of Swedish heritage I must say I was intrigued and excited by this beer. It poured as any darker ale with little to set it apart. The nose was nice with tinges of spice and malt. The flavor is what set this apart as it was reminiscent of a Christmas beer with nutmeg, spicy cinnamon, barley malt, tea leaves, prune, date and then a tangy cranberry finish. The feel was a tad thin when it comes to the overall style. I enjoyed this immensely, perhaps a touch jaded by the history, but it had great flavor."
"High in alcohol, but the tartness counters well. Probably one of the better big beers from Dogfish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
"Pours a rich, clear cranberry with a one-finger, off-white head that quickly dissipates. Only aroma I could get was faintly honey; not liking honey, this isn't a perk. Tastes mostly like carbonated cranberry juice with a bit of honey and a touch of cough syrup. Not for me."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 10/11/2013. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of tart berries, cranberry juice, strawberry, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, light woodiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of yeast ester, fruit, spice, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tart berries, cranberry juice, strawberry, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, light woodiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart berries, cranberry juice, pear, apple, red grape, honey, toast, bread, light pepper, herbal, light woodiness, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, fruit, malt, and spice flavors; with a great malt/fruit flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice fruit/spiced ancient ale style. All around good balance and complexity and balance of yeast, ester, fruit, spice, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer surprised me. I expected a lambic tasting beer that would be sour. It has a great balance of tart and sweetness that makes it so delicious. I definitely recommend trying it."
""
""
"Amber hued with good clarity. A quarter inch head of off white foam covers the majority of the beer. Brussels lacing. Aroma of cranberries and faint lingonberries. The body is surprisingly light but a bit sticky. The flavor is slightly tart cranberries balanced with a bit of sweet honey. You can also sense a light malt base"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very solid beer. It has good flavors and definitely isn't your run of the mill fruit beer."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Light fruity nose and flavor is tart fruit, some sweetness, high ABV is hidden. Take out the hops and it would be close to a wine. Pricey at $14.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tullys Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I thought that this beer would be quite tart with the cranberries and lingonberries, but the honey helps to balance things off and even adds a bit of sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"O-Not much besides cranberries and honey. Would have like more subtly or flavors."
""
" The taste is interesting with fruity cranberry providing a juicy slight tangy taste with an herbal flavor and mild sweetness of the honey and birch syrup noticeable on the palate with a sweet/sour complimentary taste. The yeast adds a light hint of dryness with the alcohol as it finishes with some fruit there after the swallow. Overall I really enjoyed this Ancient ale - it is kind of straddling the line between mulled wine and beer with the birch syrup and hone making for a smooth 10% ale - I recommend this for those who like historic beers"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is fairly thin, a little watery. Fairly flat or still. Overall...more a juice than a beer. But not bad. Maybe something to surprise a friend who believes all beer tastes the same."
""
""
""
"The enjoyable beer would be most appreciated with summer salads, feta cheese, cheesecake or bitter greens. That's because as a stand-alone taste there seems to be something amiss. Food and good company would provide answers."
"Overall this is a well balanced fruit beer. Not too sweet like most fruit beers. This strikes the right balance and I could see myself having a couple of these on a hot summer day. The fact that it is based on an ancient Scandinavian brew is a plus for me since I am a history buff."
""
""
""
""

"Surprisingly clear dark orange with an off white head. Cranberries on the nose, super tart and sugary sweet. The beer feels Smooth and balanced at first. It then takes on a dry tartness and hits you with the cranberry, which is the beers most dominant flavor. A very malty and plain backbone but rather pleasant and puts off no off flavors. The honey is somewhat there but this beer is mostly about the cranberry. A touch of alcohol in the taste but rather well balanced. ITs sweet at first and dry and tart later. A decent fruit beer and worth checking out."
""
""
"O: Overall sweet honey and tart cranberry, Unique, but more of a cranberry beer then anything. A bomber could lead to quite the struggle once the novelty wears off. For the record i picked this up from a local store which had 20 bombers on closeout at $3.98. A price always worth a curious buy when it comes to dogfish head, but dont expect to be knocked over. I understand the experimental aspect, but overall if i didnt know what i was drinking in a blind taste test, i probably wouldnt be to impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good fruit beer. Nothing funky or weird just a really nice blend of some unique ingredients. I think I will put a couple in the cellar for a year or two as they should age well."
""

"I appreciate the innovation beer and this beer does start to grow on you after a little while. That being said, its still not nearly worth drinking considering the other offerings in the style."
""
"cool beer here loaded with a bunch of unconventional berries for brewing that have stained it a grapefruit pink color and even the head a pale shade of pink. the nose on this is more herbal than fruity, with a lemongrass vibe and a moderate acidity. the flavor starts with berries, but its a bit thin. the grain profile is very light, but interesting too, not sure what all is in here, but its more than wheat and pale malt. i like how ripe this is with tart berries without being sweet at all. the grassy flavors come on in the finish, lush and well hopped for a fruited beer. long tart finish, maybe a touch of honey sweetness, very interesting. also, the alcohol is superbly well disguised, you cant get it at all. i would have guess 6.5% abv, not 10, no way. well carbonated and maybe a tad thin in body. i certainly like this a lot, and would like to see some of these berries resurface in other beers. i genuinely like these far out dogfish beers, and although they have faced some criticism, i think they are moving brewing forward in a cool new way."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Neither too sugary, nor is it too tart or boozy. Add in some appreciated suds and it's one of the better cranberry beers and one of the more likable Ancient Ales from DFH."
""
""
"Overall well it was definitely really unique and interesting to try. I did like the tart berry notes, really liked how well the cranberry actually came through unlike most beers, and tart piney lingonberry that really makes me think juniper berry, the birch sap led to a pine forest note with syrupy flavor mixing well with the nice malt base, and honey to really dry out the finish which didn't let it get too syrupy or sticky, but also let the booze finally cut through as it was mostly well hidden. A really interesting beer to try, but not sure if I would really buy it again, but I may want to bring it to a family event so the Finnish cranberry farm side of the family can try it."

"Overall- One of the better fruit beers I have had it does not try to be something else or copy someone else's style it is its one thing which I love, a good representation or take on an ancient ale and what it should be not aggressive and booze but soft subtle and tart"
""
"O: A really nice fruit beer from Dogfish Head. Definitely a pleasant surprise for me."
""
"O: Nothing bad here and with most of Dogfish Head's beer I'd recommend trying it, I just didn't get any of the notes mentioned on the label and for me it would not be one I'd seek out again"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an interesting entry in the ancient ale series. Instead of the super-sweet boozy mead-wine-beer hybrids like Sah'tea, Jaihu and the like, this is a relatively crisp and tart brew that is very interesting."
"D - This brew is quintessential Dogfish Head... Not great nor bad, but completely unique and challenging... The aroma is the best part of this offering... The flavor profile and mouthfeel are a bit rough around the edges... The end result is a beer worthy of the curious... Probable a couple notches below Theobroma in terms of my favorite DFH Ancient Ale..."

"Clear shiny amber with almost no head. Smells of cranberry, booze, and the medicine cabinet after a flood. Tastes of cranberry, herbal notes, sweet syrup, and warming booze. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Sweet but not very interesting. No reason to have more than once."
""
""
"Hand it to Dogfish Head to go far out on the craft beer limb with another Ancient Ale and this one I'd love to see more of."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Ok, better then most recent DFH stuff lately."
"O - Certainly unique, I'm glad I tried it, but I'm now ready for a stout. This is certainly very different. Closer to wine than beer. A strange combination that they made work, but not something I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Excellent, let a small amount warm up in the glass so the bouquet opens up as well."
""
""
""
"Tart and bitter, cranberry and lingonberry in spades. Malt underneath, lingering bitterness verges on herbal. Initially more carbonated, though it ebbs away towards the end. It drinks more as a Gruit, which is essentially what many of these attempts at ancient ales are."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is interesting, but not what I would call beer."
""
""
""
"Notes: Again, Bravo to DFH for pushing limits of beer and seemingly to always try new things. DFH Kvasir is an acquired taste in a beer."
""
""
""
""

"I love trying unusual and anciently inspired ales. This one was particularly good. The beer, from a heavy 750 ml bottle, is a burnt-copper color...clear, with a very fleeting head. Moderate carbonation. The aroma is rich with berries and honey. It smells like a a fresh forest harvest...meaty berries, wood, herbs, and very prominent honey. The taste is a bit tart, followed with a fruity sweetness. Dryish, with lots of flavor. It has an herbal bitterness up front, which does not linger. Medium body, and lightly carbonated. Very drinkable, and it really masks its ABV."
"O-defintely an odd ball of a beer. i'm liking it a lot more than many of their other crazy 750mL beers. it's not spectacular, i wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type of person (like me) that needs to try every DFH beer at least once. it holds the alcohol well, you can barely taste it at all. probably the most tart DFH beer i've ever had."
"Just another Dogfish Head fruit beer. Features the tart berries and captures that tartness at a minor level. Not very special, in actuality. Could be considered skippable amongst others in their lineup."
""
""
"O- Intresting and unique, not my favorite ancient ale, but not bad at all."
""
"Cheers!!!"
"750 ml bottle, bottled on 10/11/2013. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like sweet and tart berries (cranberries, other red berries), honey, sweet syrup, and some peppery herbalness. It tastes like cranberries, sweet and tart red berries, white grapes, honey, bready/grainy malt and some woody herbs. There's some nice sweet, tart and herbal flavors that mesh well together in this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit syrupy and creamy with moderate carbonation. The 10% ABV is pretty well hidden. I think it's a good, interesting brew. I'd pick this up again in the future, it's definitely worth trying if you've never had it before. $11.99 a bottle."
""
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium bronze amber with a two finger light tan head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of cranberry, mixed berries, light bready malt, lightly spicy and tart. Flavor is earthy; bark and light toasted malt to start, developing cranberry flavor and tartness with grape and berry elements and finishing with tart cranberry juice and earthy bitterness. Medium bodied with peppery carbonation. Another very interesting reconstructed beer that really does taste as if it were the result of an ancient brewer experimenting with flavors from the nearby environment. The profile of the base beer is reminiscent of a light Berliner Weisse, fruity and tart, but the rustic herbs have an interesting woodiness of putting your tongue on an unfinished pine board; woody without a resiny element. Likely due to a mint family herb like sage. Tart and refreshing with an odd herbal taste that I enjoyed despite its unfamiliarity. We don't know what these early brews tasted like, but a lot of the Dogfish Head attempts sure are convincing that they could have been brewed at the dawn of time."

"this beer has a good amber color with thin lacing. the smell is sour with a touch of sweetness. the taste is sour, but not off-putting. you can really taste the cranberry- which adds a nice bitterness. and the sweetness of the honey paired with the sour goes good together. this isn't my favorite dogfish head, but its a good one- if you see it try it."
"O: Better than some of their other ancient ales, but still nothing to write home about. Midas Touch and Sahti, if that's technically one of their ancient ales, are still far and away the best they've made in this category."
""
"M: Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather interesting brew with a rather interesting tart fruit and wine-like taste. At first sip I didn’t think I liked it much, but over time, the more subtle, hard to explain nuances and flavors became more apparent, producing a rather intriguing and enjoyable sipper of a beer."
"O- Interesting, as most DFH beers are, but there is just too much going on for me. I think it might be tolerable if the berries weren't so potent. I will give it credit for drinkability, especially as it warms up. for a 10% beer it hides the alcohol well. Lots of sweetness too."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 750mL into a snifter, the beer is a rose tinted copper coloring, slightly hazed and bright, with a frothy, filmy, off-white head. Aromas of cranberry and raspberry, but concentrated like they have been boiled for jam, with toasted grains and a kick of booze. Flavors are tart forward, with cranberry in the forefront, a subtle rich sweetness of honey, roast characteristics, woody notes, and a hint of booze. Bold, robust bodied, but it remains thin enough to be drinkable. The aftertaste is roasted and richly tart, with a subtle warmth building. Tangy fruit sweetness lingers into a thin, slick finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Real fun and neat creation, quite memorable and unique. Nice work."
""
""
"O: I believe this is my least favorite DFH brew I have had yet, it's really watery and just not really all there it seems. It's not terrible but it's not really good either."
""
""
""
"O: I find the Ancient Ale's from DFH to be a lot of fun, for better or worse. Never knowing what to expect from any standpoint is my main attraction to these beers. I'd say Kvasir is a hit in comparison to several of the others but perhaps not one of the top tier brews from the series. I really think any of these beers are worth a try and Kvasir is one that I could see myself buying again, like Theobroma, Sah'tea or Birra Etrusca. Worth a go for sure."
""
"i'm not sure if this was meant to be the ""new fort"" or just another crazy idea from dfh, but if fort was what you were expecting from this, it's not close by a longshot."
""
""
"O: A nice little experiment in brewing history yet again from DFH. Extremely drinkable for being 10%, it's almost like straight-up alcoholic herbal cranberry juice (with a few more nuances, obviously). Interesting and worth a try"
""
"By the way, it has an interesting description and history of it on the DFH website."
"O: Ok, but different like all of their Ancient Ales."
""
""
"overall: More kudos to Sam and team. Very interesting experiment and a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit more herb/spice forward than I was expecting. I was hoping they'd really let the berries shine through an be the star of the beer, but that didn't end up being the case. Nevertheless, this is still a decent offering that's worth picking up if you're a DFH fan. Not the best of the ancient ales series, but certainly not the worst either."
