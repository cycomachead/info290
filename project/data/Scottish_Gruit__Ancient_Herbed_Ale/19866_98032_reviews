"Pour is golden amber, light haze, with a tight off white head.  Nose is sweet, white grapes and golden fruits combine with a boozy note and a moderate spice to it.  Taste is much brighter and more integrated.  Strong peach notes come through, the booze is integrated rather than another contrasting flavor.  Strong herbal flowery spice throughout the finish.  Light body, enough carbonation, and a fairly dry finish."

"O: A very complex and delicious beer. The ingredients and barrel aging all worked together perfectly to give this a very well-rounded and unique flavor. Definitely work checking out."

"Overall: really good. I can't pick out herbs but it is damn good."

"The beer pours a slightly hazy yellow-orange with no head or sediment. The nose is subtle and herbal - predominantly highlights the lemongrass, but also has notes of gin, yeast, and oak. The taste has a mild herbal quality, modest lemony tartness, and a slight bite from the peppercorns in the finish. This beer is light and refreshing with approachable herbal qualities, easy drinkability that's perfect for summer (despite its relatively complex flavor profile), and a citrusy tart, slightly bitter, and semi-dry finish. This beer has a tremendous amount of interesting flavors, but is pulled off very well and is definitely a beer I'd enjoy again in the future."

"On the lighter end of medium body with dry puckering funk and a very prominent brett presence countered by spicy ginger, sweet juniper and earthy barrel notes.  Lots of dry oak and damp, earthy funk dominating the flavor.  Again, I'm picking up spices and wild yeast but not much peach or wine character.  Very dry but has decent flavor especially from the wild yeast, light fruit and gin."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Very easy drinking, I could kill a bottle of this pretty regularly if I had easy access to it."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is slightly sour and tart with malt, grain, herb, and spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sour and tart fruit and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great sour and herbal flavor that makes this one quite easy to drink."

"Overall: I had high expectations for this as a big lover of gin and they were exceeded. I wish I could get this more often. I love the berry flavor additions to the more standard light gueuze-like qualities. The gin and wine barrels have made this beer absolutely outstanding. Very complex, very well balanced, and outlandishly refreshing and delicious."

"Using gin barrels for a gruit is something that on the face of it seems a no-brainer, but is seldom done and ne'er so well. It's been a while since I was this impressed with a beer. Brilliant and inspired."

"O - Floral and oaky-barrel. Light and very tasty."
"M: Light to medium bodied."

"O: A terrific scent and flavour that's clean, crisp and refreshing. The interesting notes of the herbs bloom as the brew warms, well worth the wait. Would pair well with BBQ fish and a summer patio."
"Overall. Light and refreshing with plenty of subtle complexity. A winner for sure, very much enjoying it."

"On par with the sole comp version, one of the best from this brewery. The addition of peach balances and compliments the dry gin which dominated the sole comp batch. Great stuff."
