"Never seen a dark gruit before this one. A huge lavender and rosemary nose on this brown looking ale with an enormous cream froth head for an unhopped beer. I taste way more Pune than other herbs in it though, presumably from the rosemary. Real long taste herbal almost like green tea, a little floral, nice chocolate malt on it too, not used to any real grain character in the style, but it's such a great change of pace. Piney as anything for no hops. Drinkable too. This is a beer for the adventurous palate no doubt, but a reward worth having for sure!"

"Not sure how to rate to style here... But given the product as it is, it's not too impressive in the long run. Definitely worth consuming for novelty purposes, and while the flavors are seriously well placed, it's simply too thin, tannic, and not as hearty as desired. Would love to try the barrel aged version, however!"

"This is quite a dark gruit. Heather abounds on the nose. Flavor is quite deep. Much richer and less light than the few other gruits I have had. But hey, what do I know. Pretty smooth. Nice subtle herbal tones, but nothing really comes at you at 100mph. Smooth and easy drinking. Definitely a good stab at a rarely touched style."
"Cheers, and I look foward to enjoying it again in the future."

"I realize this beer has A ratings across the board, but I just can't see ever sitting down and drinking 16oz of this at a time. 3oz, fine, but it just got tedious. Maybe in due time I'll appreciate gruit more, but its really just a neat little oddity at this stage of my beer advocacy."
"*Note: Weekapaug Gruit is still being brewed--as of summer 2011, at least."
"Smoky, herbal aroma, sort of like Scotch whisky and stout-like at the same time. Oddly complex and unusual. Flavors of sweet honeyed malt, Indian spices, cookies, currants, tea, and possibly juniper lending a botanical impression. Smooth feel, medium bodied and lightly bitter. Overall it's rather unique and worth trying a pint of this oddity for sure."
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice mix of spices that all balanced out very well and tasted much more rich and complex than most other herbal ales."
"At a bar with 6 cask beers available, we went home with a growler of the Gruit."
"The smell is very good, bringing all sorts of herbs and spices. The brings a touch of fruit underlining the herbal flavor. The mouthfeel is spicy and pleasing."
"Drinkability: A tasty beer for a change of pace"
"I visited the Magnolia brewery while in Palo Alto recently and was absolutely blown away. As a beer journal keeper with over 400 beers under my belt, I was simply shocked that one brewpub could offer so many amazing selections. The gruit was quite possibly the best of their offerings. It is light yellow with a slight red undertone. The gruit is brewed with rosemary and other ""obscure herbs"" in the 15th century tradition. This beer is a seasonal brew at Magnolia and was offered on cask. The gruit has a light head that is mostly creamy trails across the top and the taste is simply immaculate. This drink tastes like what I imagine the ale in Tolkein's shire was like. The taste and smell are both very fresh and herblike, simply smelling rosemary will give it away. This beer is nothing like coriander flavored ales that are still brewed with hops (like Traquair) and is much better. It drinks very easily and feels very smooth and full in your mouth with a slight fruitiness. It is best very cold and the cask was responsible for amazing smothness, a truly unique offering. We went back for more before leaving town."
