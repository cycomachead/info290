"Pour is a maroon color with pink edges and a small amount of white head that dissipates immediately.  Nose has notes of berries, faint floral aroma, moderate oak, strong acetic acid and plastic smell.  Taste is rough, lots of acetic acid, mild plastic, heavy acetic burn, moderate sourness.  Faint oakiness, a bit of berry fruitiness, highly carbonated, grainy feel."

"Overall my second favorite gruit behind Special Herbs Batch 1.  Highly recommend this brew, kudos to Trevor for working with this style."

"O: Overall, I like the complexity of this beer, compared to the more singular intense fruit of most of the Bu variants, but it lacks a bit of drinkability due to the high acidity.  Normally, I can down a 750 of most de Garde beers without any problem, but this one is a bit of work."
