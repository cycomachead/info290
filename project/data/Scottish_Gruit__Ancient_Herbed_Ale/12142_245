Aroma is pale malt, honey, faint nuts, grain, floral/herbal & a hint of sourness. Taste is light but not watery: malt, honey, floral, caramel, fruitiness with a grain, herbal, floral, dry finish. Aftertaste is dry, fruity & floral. No hops in it and no hop character. I have no idea what heather smells or tastes like so I have no basis to determine if I detect it in either the nose or mouth. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, light but silky & juicy becoming becoming very dry at the end. Unique & oh so drinkable.","mothmanscott","Mar 01, 2015"

Smells kind of yeasty with some citrus (lemon maybe) and a sweetness I cant pinpoint. Taste is sweet and unique like Paw Paw fruit. Zesty citrus, honey, flowery or herb like, but not hops, and a solid malt base. Above average carbonation gives it a little bit of a crisp bite like champagne. Slightly slick/sticky aftertaste/finish.  Otherwise, medium bodied. Not a favorite by any means, but pretty easy drinking and enjoyable.

Flavour difficult to pin down and may be very hard to review for some.

At the initial sip it is sweet with distinct floral overtones. A slight twist of hops then appears, followed by light earthy malts- giving the beer its character. The aftertaste is slightly nutty and is strangely chalk like. Very good overall, a testament to the 4000 years its been brewed. I'd definitely go another.","SamKetchum","Jul 19, 2014"

Out of the whole lineup, the Fraoch Heather is my favorite. The pour is a clear amber, but the lack of head or lacing was originally concerning. Smells of sweet grasses and light florals. The taste... is.. spot on. Crisp and clean, Heather comes in for a quick kiss of herbs, sweet malt, and an earthy essence. She finishes quickly and leaves you refreshed, but wanting more.

Certainly not so different that it would lead your average lover of hops and barley would turn up his/her nose -nonetheless-- this beer is unusual. However, it retains enough elements present in "modern" beers to stand as a beer that is supposedly similar to what the Scots drank in 2000 BCE, but is still readily accessible to modern beer drinkers. Recommended for the historical elements alone, but this beer certainly is worth trying just to drink a great beer.","BeerDocT","Dec 07, 2013"

The unique flavour offers up enough spicy, herbal notes to keep things interesting, but never comes close to overwhelming or exhausting the palate, even (I suspect) after more than one bottle. Of the four ales in this brewery's sampler, this is easily the most drinkable, potentially the most well-integrated, and probably my favourite.

A strong honey aroma attracts attention of the senses, noting a sense of sweetness. Upon the initial taste, a sweet and smooth taste was noted. With a honey taste and aroma present, it brought to mind a honey mead. The backbone of the beer was the flowery heather notes with a slight wheat sweetness. In truth, there were few characteristics of beer present. On the other hand, I enjoyed the texture and was surprised by the taste. I am not certain it would be something I would drink in the future. It is still recorded as a positive experience.","JohnnyHopps","Apr 22, 2012"

Malt is clearly evident in both aroma and taste, but not quite as rich or pronounced as the “full malt character” on the label might lead one to expect. Floral throughout, including the aftertaste, this beer leans towards sweet, which seems in keeping with the floral flavor profile. Still, it smells sweeter than it tastes. The rather light and dry mouthfeel also work integrate nicely to produce a very refined and distinctive sensory experience from an ancient ale.","chinchill","Jan 11, 2012"

Also in the nose is a strong honey like note from the malt profile, I know there's no actual honey but I'm getting a light generic fruitiness with a strong presence of rich honey. Flavor is spicy with a long dry finish, upfront light fruit a touch of honey and caramel malts dance around with floral/spicy heather and floral additions.

The taste brings in more of the same, though the chlorophyll content is significantly diminished (thankfully). The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda creamy feel. Overall, not that bad, really. I remember having this years ago and nearly retching with every sip, but such a reaction was nowhere to be found here.

4.02,7.2,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"From a 500 ML bottle poured into a Brooklyn Brewery glass. I have had two other offerings by the Williams Brother's brewery, the Alba Scots Pine Ale, and the Kelpie Seaweed Ale. Fraoch ranks above Kelpie, but I have to give Alba Scots the top ranking out of these three. Fraoch pours a light, yet opaque yellowish color. The head is impressive, and lacing runs down the glass as I sip it. The smell is absolutely wonderful, bringing to mind flowers and, for some reason, the smell of a field on a bright summer's day. The taste is fairly bitter, with the Heather definitely coming through, especially in the after taste. It definitely has a very sweet feel to it, with almost a wine-esque character to it. The drinkability is really the beer's only downfall, it is tasty but even the 500 ML was a tad much. Overall it's definitely worth a look, especially for the novelty factor (the style claims to date from 2000 bc), but the taste is pleasantly surprising. I'd recommend the Alba Scots Pine Ale over this beer, but Fraoch did not disappoint.","ramseye4","Oct 05, 2010"

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, coats the throat and mouth, seems syrupy, but has a lighter feel thanks to moderate levels of carbonation.

The sweetness is slightly detrimental and I can't help but wonder if this is due in part by the lack of carbonation. My main complaint is that I wish there was some accompanying malt backbone to the heather that was used...the flavor was interesting but I think it could've excelled as more than a novelty if there'd been some interplay between malt and heather. In the end, this isn't something I'd drink all that often because it's a little too sweet and the flavor is a bit lacking. Still a unique and ineteresting beer, but I doubt it will ever ascend from novelty.

It is very refreshing, very floral, and the sunflower like tastes are obviously the heather. The beer is quite honey sweet, no hop bitterness in the least. The IBU on this beer would be in the single digits. The aftertaste is very light, sweet, and very un-beer like. The ABV is completely hidden.

Poured a light reddish gold color similar to a well aged scotch with lots a tiny bubbles rising up. There was a small white head that dissapated quickly. The smell was almost non existant until the beer actually warmed up then the heather blossom, honey, and malt notes came out. The taste was really sweet like honeydew melon but there was a flower petal like finish that dried on the way down. All around a good after dinner beer.","Portertime","May 15, 2008"

It leaves a sweet aftertaste in the mouth, but I find it amazing that there is no alcoholic aftertaste that I can detect. At 5%, this is definitely a plus.

An impressive creamy off-white head, rested on top like a beer induced cloud. A good swirl brings it right back to life midway. The nose was of sweet malt and cold biscuits, with traces of clover honey in the finish. This fantastic malty tasting beer had a very low hop presence, as it finished with a light, sweet, eucalyptus like cooling sensation, I'm guessing a product of the heather flower. Seeing as though I haven't exactly trampled through the highlands gnawing on fresh heather, I can't really be sure. It had a VERY smooth mouth feel, with a medium body that lent to easy drinking. This beer pairs very well with panko breaded pork cutlets, served with London chop sauce. A firm nutty cheese like Samsoe (a Danish cheddar), or the semi-firm Cheshire, with its buttery finish, would be great served as an appetizerEnjoy","Greenfloyd","Mar 05, 2007"

The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, but is a touch watery. Light to Medium Bodied. It is very drinkable, but not enough to become a session beer. The heather offers a different taste as to what Hops delivers. It still has a touch of bitterness though. I prefer the taste of Hops to Heather. Not a complex brew, but it is unique and tasty.

On the palate, a sharp floral character braces things up, followed by metallic carbonation and a sweet, tea-leaf mid-palate that finishes off half-sweet, half-dry, and unlike a conventional beer.

Honey malts with a very unique flowery quality that I will assume is the heather, somewhat earthy as well. Again, a slight smoke aspect, typical of many scottish ales. Very well balanced, the heather manages to contribute bitterness yet it disappears almost completely from the palate once you swallow. Very clean, crisp finish. Very interesting.

The aroma has slight floral tones with hints of heather (no suprise since fraoch is Gaelic for heather and this ale is made using traditional techniques and flavored with the flower of the heather plant). The flavor is very malty with no strong bitterness at the front but it does coat the tongue with a slight bitterness on the finish. The malty sweetness stays on the palate long after finishing the drink. Definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoys malty beers.","Silenus","Oct 20, 2005"

Only a negligible amount of thin lace ring. The smell reminds me of hops and oatmeal. Dry oatmeal. A good bit of malt, as well as a faintly noticeable grassy herb undertone toward the finish. Strange. Pleasant, but strange. The taste is fantastic. Great malty taste will herbs present there, too. I hate to be so vague, but this is really unusual stuff and I don't know how to describe it.

It has a mild pale malt scent along with floral hints and fruitiness. It 's herbal smelling with a tart edge. The taste is decent. It has an earthy flavor that boasts of herbs and floral hints. Pale malts act as the base, but the herbs offer most of the flavor. It seems a bit watery. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

Interesting: tangy, fruity, malty, caramel middle with a sour, bitter, finish. It's very "old" tasting (not stale, but like an "old-style" beer... if that makes any sense).

Sure, the bottle looks good, but this stuff is close to drinking Febreeze or sumfin. I'll take hops over heather anyday. This was like flowerpot runoff. I guess the taste is a bit unfamiliar and strange. Overall, one could drink this stuff. I probably will not buy this again, but it was unique for sure.

The aroma reminds me of camping in a wet forest. The taste is very mild, the hops are there, but nowhere near predominant. There is something else that I would assume is the heather. It is akin to a very, very, very subtle evergreen taste. Just the slightest of hints. The other flavor I notice is a bit of honey. The beer is pretty sweet and while I enjoyed my solo bottle, more than one of these would be kind of boring to the palate.","MuddyFeet","Jan 16, 2005"

Fortunately, it improves greatly afterwards. Dry malts, some herbal and bittering hops, floral scent, and heather. Taste is even better. The heather and floral taste evens out the sweet and dry hops. Aftertaste is a quick whoosh of bitterness that quickly fades. Slick and thin mouthfeel. Highly drinkable as a session ale and as a nursing drink.","slitherySOB","Dec 12, 2004"

The head was gorgeous, very finely beaded with a creamy look to it - great stuff. The mouthfeel was more robust than I anticipated given the other peripherals. It gives off a very dry, feathery malt taste that, at times, hints at brandy. The finish is more vinous, dry and pale I say. Overall, this a very easy-to-drink yet different beer.

Finishes somewhat dry, though not as dry as wine (as the bottle compares itself to). Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with fairly low carbonation.

4.15,10.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"A very unique and flavourful taste. Soft floweriness on the front of the tongue, mild in the middle with more of the same, but with some slight sweetness of the malt, and a balanced bitterness on the finish, with a very, very fresh barley taste left lingering on the tongue, heightened by the highly fragrant heather presence. The finish is by far the best part of the taste. For those of you who have been to Scotland and smelt the wild heather, you will know that the brewers have conjured the aroma of heather quite well in this treasured time-honoured beer. The mouthfeel is not powerful or off-putting at all; in truth I was actually expecting an altogether bolder feel on the mouth, considering the ingredients of this ale. I believe it could use a little more body, perhaps a strengthening of the heather flavour. This factor, however, makes it a highly drinkable beer, whilst perhaps sacrificing some more potential taste. This is hard to review with "style" in mind, because it is the only heather ale I have ever tried. I thoroughly enjoyed this, however. All I can say is that a stronger heather flavour would satisfy me all the more so. I believe they could make this a truly exceptional and very exclusive beer for only a select few people with discerning palates. Very singular, very unique. You may enjoy this more if you have visited Scotland.","Cwrw","May 22, 2004"

4.46,18.9,3,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Clear, light amber in color with a low, brit-style head, Fraoch Heather Ale presents little in the way of apprearance. However, the subtle but substantial floral bouquet brought about by the use of heather flowers is to die for. Light in body and alcohol, highly drinkable, pleasantly floral - this is an ideal beer for summer consumption. Without hop bitterness to mask the malt, the subtleties of pale malts has never been more pronounced. The yeast character is similar to that of Belgian brews, slight esters complementing the heather aroma.","Crotor","Apr 01, 2004"

Very cool logo and artwork - it made me expect something celtic in nature. Poured up a dark golden, almost orange or maybe red but had very little head. What head it did have was lost quickly. The color still looked nice in the glass however. The aroma was easily classified as floral, sweet with a hint of malty... something. A bit fruity maybe. The taste was sweeter than I expected. With the strong floral scent, I often expect a balance of bitter hops, but this one wasn't that bitter. It felt not flat in my mouth, but the carbination was pretty weak - it somehow fit with the light body though. I enjoyed the taste, but not enough to drink a lot of it. I could see this being something of a desert beer. And I bet it would be good with a sharp cheese.","bighops","Mar 31, 2004"

The smell is incredibly malty and has a lovely sweet floral aroma. the taste is very nice - the malts remind me of a typical English style pale ale or bitter, and the heather seems to augment it quite well. This is a bit of herbalness in the finish that reminds you that this is not a typical English style pale ale or bitter, but the malt structure is quite solid with caramelized and pale malt flavors being predominant.

They don't mention if there are hops at all (don't they need some to be allowed to call it "beer," so sweetness seems balanced by heather, giving it grassy notes and the dry finish, as advertised, plus a very faint citrusy aspect.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Taste is, not surprisingly, unusual but quite pleasant. The heather bitters the toffee/caramel malt characters very well, resulting in a nicely balanced and very drinkable ale.

Floral aroma that is hoppy, but then again, not quite hoppy. Interesting use of something other then hops as a bittering agent. From what Ive read elsewhere, there are no hops used in the brewing of this ale, just heather. Only a hint of malt in the aroma. Smooth brew with a medium mouthfeel and very light carbonation. Light bready malt notes with only a light sweetness. The finish has a mild bitterness that balances out the brew rather nicely. Due to the lack of hops, however, the bitterness is unique to this brew. The bottle says it has a dry winey finish. I didnt observe this in the bottle I sampled.

It has been awhile since I had the bottled version, but I recall the malt flavor being a bit more prominent. The aromas and flavors of the heather are a bit stronger in the cask-conditioned version. You could probably approximate the flavor by pouring the beer into a glass and leaving it in your fridge overnight.","ManekiNeko","Aug 30, 2003"
3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A very nice looking brew that is a clear deep amber with heavy hues of orange. The head is slightly off white and fairly minimal, but it does manage to leave a continual lace from the residual. This is clearly a very complex ale that provides many different sensory opportunities ranging from its earthy sense to the elegant spice notes and onward to the very malty and caramel dominance. The flavor is quite sweet with the underlying hops doing little to disturb the malty sweetness. Very smooth feel with little bite or crispness to the finish. Faint hints of the heather drift through the brew which begins to weaken on feel as the brew warms toward room temps. This is very enjoyable beer to be savored singularly on an ocassional basis.","AtLagerHeads","Jul 18, 2003"

For a beer that touts itself as being brewed with heather, I really expected quite a bit of floral notes in the aroma and flavor. The heather seemed to lend more of a stodgy herbal flavor. Quite typical of Scottish ale in the malt, which was substantial but overall bland. The heather never did anything to liven the beer, and my overall impression was "blah." Not bad, just boring.","Brent","Jun 13, 2003"

The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, with medium body and low carbonation. This ale was extremely drinkable! I was very impressed and suprised.

The taste is mostly of herbal tea (the heather I suppose) but there is also some beer under there. The malt that comes through tastes like your average low end pale ale so it's a good thing that only a little comes through. The herbal tones of this ale is what makes it good. Complex earthy and almost honeylike flavors nip at your tounge. Like hops, heather has a mild sedative effect so it is a good herb for beer.

A combination of mild hop and dried heather petal bitterness is perceptible at first, but dry biscuit and bread notes quickly assert themselves and diminish both light caramel and residual sweetness. Hop flavor is meager and masked by the spicy Heather flavor.  The light body and mild overall malt profile allows the flavors of heather and biscuit to dominate in a pleasant manner that helps with the drinkability.  Finishes very dry w/ lingering toasty malt notes.  Fraoch is an unusual brew-- the heather petals added both a bitterness and flavor that provided uniqueness to this otherwise unremarkable beer.

4.12,9.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Slightly hazed with a thin white lace. Nice use of the heather, perhaps a bit over carbonated for my liking. The sweet heather flavour plays well of the dry malt character.","Jason","Apr 15, 2002"
3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Best before date of Dec. 2001.  Real interesting old recipe -- heather flowers replace (or supplement) the hops.  Hazy brown with darker than usual sediment.  Small head that stays around for a minute.  Musty, winey aroma, a little clove maybe.  Impressive mouthfeel, a little spiced banana and apple-like flavor.  Interesting flavor with residual yeasty/fruity/flowery impression.  The smell works well with the taste on a deep drink.  Beer is a little on the sticky side, though.  Are heather flowers related to hops?","ADR","Apr 15, 2002"
3.78,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"This is a very interesting beer.  I enjoyed it, but it's not something I want to have when I kick back a put down a few pints.  It's got a nice cloudy amber-colored body, with a thick head that quickly fades.  The aroma is a bit thin, but spicy - a bit like the scent of a forest.  The taste is what truly sets this beer apart.  The herbal taste dominates (sage comes to mind) and has a very dry finish.","Viking","Apr 07, 2002"

4.12,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Upon first taste, I really liked this beer.  Unique and interesting, but very drinkable.  Smelled of woods and bark, which I guess is what this beer is know for.  Has a winey flavor as well.  I am not sure if this goes with any food, except maybe cheese.","AaronRed","Feb 17, 2002"

3.97,5.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Notes: For its uniqueness, we highly recommend this ale. As a beer, it is remarkable, extremely drinkable and refreshing. "Fraoch" is Gaelic for Heather. This is one of the oldest ale styles brewed in history (from heather flowers and Scottish malt).","Todd","Oct 05, 1998"
