"O: very forgettable."

"O: Well, it's not my bag, but it was certainly flavourful. That being said, it wasn't all that complex, so probably not the best of the style."
"Overall, this beer doesn't have any crazy features, but very refreshing and the natural favors blend well together. Worth a try if your in Victoria."

". I Had Heatherdale Ale at the GCBF in Victoria. It pours with a substantial but small amount of head.The carbonation is quite low making it light enough to drink a few. It has a light golden color to it. I was skeptical about this ale at first; heather flowers in a light ale did not seem to appealing. The smell was amazing thought; it had aromas of piney hops, a delicate malt aroma, and a flora smell that had a slight rose aroma to it. The taste was multi-layered and was delicate. The taste began with a smooth malt body which leads to a floral piney hop flavor which leads into the heather flowers. The flowers give it a natural almost sweet and sour taste to it that made the beer very unique and tasty. It's a shame it is only available at B Gardens, if you ever get a chance to try it go for it."
"infused with the aroma of Heather flowers from the Butchart Gardens. Mild with a floral aroma."""
