"Brewed with hand-picked herbs, sweet gale, yarrow and wild rosemary, this unhopped throwback to ancient days is a unique brew today. Some suggest mind altering. We’d have to agree. This is a must-try for those looking to expand their palates and minds beyond the norm; don’t serve too cold. Phish fans, rejoice."

"O: This is my first experience with a gruit, so I didn't quite know what to expect. This one seems to be lacking a little something though. It's a little thin in body and in malt flavor. I'll admit that I hung onto this one for a bit longer than I should have. It tastes a little soured. Gotta wonder what the shelf life is on this without any hops to act as a preservative."

"O: I really enjoyed this CBC offering. I'm glad they decided to bottle an odd stye that can stand on it's own accord. I'd drink this again."
"Overall, I like this beer. It falls a little flat , but I am not well sampled in Gruits and as such have little to compare it to. That being said, I would try this again, maybe after trying a few others."
""
"Overall you need to be prepared for a legitimate gruit with a huge herbal forefront untamed by sweetness, bitterness, or alcohol. Definitely an interesting beverage, although I'm not sure I'd try it again."
"Weekapaug Gruit is hard to place. It’s not the best beer, but then again it’s not a beer in the sense that I’m used to. It’s not something I’d drink on a regular basis. However, it’s definitely a brew aficionados should try and I applaud Cambridge Brewing Company for bringing the style back into the light."

"Drink- It was tasty. I like the heather ale a little bit better for the style but this was good."
"As a vegetarian, it's kind of nice to taste roasted chicken again, I guess."
"Well, I was hopeful. First sip was great, but this wears out its welcome quickly. Pretty decent beer, & one that should definitely comes in smaller packages."

"I have to say that this is not exactly my bag. Not my style choice. That said, it isn't unpleasant and not nearly as sweet as I thought an unhopped beer would be. Paired with food, it is actually not a bad choice at all."
"O: All in all, this is a decent brew. It's definitely interesting not having a hop balance in there. It leaves the beer very thick and heavy. I'm not sure if I will brew a Gruit after getting to try one, but as a home brewer, I may do it just for the challenge of using spices in place of hops. Try if you're looking for something different or interesting."

"Sweet, mildly herbal, can't directly pick out the wild rosemary, grassy and clean. It's definitely got the same herbal feel as say, Saison du Buff, but absent the hops it's smooth, and detectable bitterness is mild. Definitely a sort of fresh, seasonally appropriate feel. If this becomes seasonal I'll probably try a bomber every year."
"O: My first gruit, and honestly I'm pleasantly surprised. Obviously very different, fruity and malty while being loaded with herbs/spices instead of hops but still quite tasty. I enjoyed it."
""

"Tough to compare this to much else, as this is only the second gruit I've ever had. But, this is a very different brew worth trying. So unique, one should try this style when they get the chance anyway. But this is done well. Good job."
""
"Overall pretty good, a nice gruit that combines the over spiced gruits with a nice bock or Belgian style beer. it has nice malts to balance, mild sweetness, and just a touch of bitterness. It doesn't try to overpower with bittering herb (like I accidentally did with wormwood on my last homebrew Gruit). I really like how the herbs play in, just the right amount that doesn't overpower the rest of the beer and destroy drinkability, but at the same time doesn't disappear into the background of the other flavors of the beer. The esters, fruit, banana/clove like from the yeast, add a nice touch as well for a tasty nice drinking Gruit. Very well done IMO!"

"One of several Phish themed CBC beers I've been hoping to try."

"If you haven't ever had an ale brewed with gruit, you should certainly give this a try. If you enjoy herbal beers, or have a penchant for original root beer from scavenged roots, you very well may enjoy this. As for myself, I would rather have hops."

"This beer poured out as a brownish amber color with a creamy head on top. The smell of the beer give off some of the aroma that the Gruit has. The flavors were very good in the beer. I spicy Gruit adds that special herbal element that I really really enjoy in these beers. The mouthfeel was soft and lightly carbonated. Overall this beer was nice, it was something I was really happy to see at the EBF, and even more happy that I got to try it."

"Dr: Very drinkable, of moderate ABV, and decent quality."

"D - A great gruit, but I couldn't call it great drinkability-wise - a tulip or two would probably suffice. This is better than average for they style, just not for sessioning IMO"
"M - Thin and fizzy with a pleasant chalky texture."
"D) Nice and unique - normal beer fair. One is enough."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Honey-like sweetness up front with a strong backbone of herbs and spices, rosemary and anise shining through quite strongly. Tastes almost like an herbal tea with an alcoholic kick. Sweetness lingers from beginning to end, making it a definite sipper, but surprisingly enjoyable and unique."
"Loads of hops!!! haha, just kidding. This one, true to style, is brewed without any hops. I really enjoy this style, and hope more breweries experiment around with it."
"This one is Pure Delicious. A total pleasure to drink. It'd be great to enjoy this at CBC's beautiful brewpub if they could just learn how to interact with the general public (the one that doesn't wander in at 6 after getting off from its well-paying white collar job)."
"This was an interesting and unique beer but not one that I would likely try again."
" There's actually a warning on this brew, about how too much can lead to high intoxication and perhaps some aphrodesiac-like effects due to the mix of natural herbs that replace the hops. This is a wild brew that proves Will meyers of CBC is on th cutting-edge of brewing. a real treat."
"Poured out a cloudy medium brown beer, with a big thick white head, that dissapeared soon after being poured out. Smelled sour, citrusy, and herbal. The tastemimicks the nose, sour, citrus, herbs, with a touch of something bitter (licorice?). The mouth was fairly crisp and bubbly, the finish was long, with the sourness lingering."
"The gruit is an interesting ale. It doesn't have hops in it, but still somehow manages to be delicious. Having only tried one gruit previously (Fraoch, from Scotland), I had an idea what I was getting into. The Weekapaug Gruit (named after a Phish song) was a bit better. It's a deep, dark black with almost no head. The aroma is hard to put a finger on - some caramel, a bit chamomile. It has a unique flavor as well. It's malty and somewhat sweet. It seem non-beer until the wheat and malt kick in. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"An interesting style and one most are probably unfamiliar with. I know I am not and I approached the beer with an open mind having little if nothing to compare it to. Alone, it was a good beer. Slightly alla dopplebock, slightly alla rauchbier; this is for sure an interesting an enjoyable beer. I would say I would not rush to find as many of these as possible and drink them, but I would not shy away from the style when it presents itself either."
"This beer is fantastic, very authentic and for those looking for sort of a history lesson of ""ancient herbed ales"" this is the text book. It poured a dark brown that left a thin tan lace that quickly disappeared. The aroma is very floural(rosemary, wheat, grass), chocolate, flowers, very aromatic. The taste is surprisingly sweet upfront followed by bitter flower/tree bark balance (if you ever have the chance to eat edible flowers that is the bitterness I'm talking about). It is then finished with a nice malty honey base that is so pleasing. This beer is great, with the combination of belgian yeast and the the fresh herbal tastes this is a treat."
"my third time sampling this style, and i must say that i am quite fond of it overall, though this gruit was, to me, less adventerous and more watered down than heavyweight's two druids. it pours a light brown/amber-ish colour with a faint but sticky head. the smell is has an herbal tea feel to it, combined with some spice, fruit (sour apple or lemon, perhaps) and malt. the flavour is quite similar to the smell, with a slight sour flavour combined with a touch of ginger running throughout. the finish is tart and a touch sweet. this is definitely a different style that may take some getting used to. but i found this brew to be quite refreshing and tasty and very easy to drink overall."
"Murky dark brown with small fuzzy patches on top that stay. Very floral and herbal aroma, with dandelions coming to mind over a toasty backdrop. Flavor is toasty caramel swamp-water with hints of rootbeer and a zing from an herb that is hard to place, but works well in the brew. Finish is just right in its compexity and lenth. Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth feel. Very smooth all around. Earthy. This is not as ""different"" as I was expecting, since the flavor focuses primarily on the malt. It was, however, infinitely drinkable and I enjoyed it very much."
"Presents as a opaque belgian/dark ale in appearance, with little head [again I was having the sampler glasses on a lunch-break, so the light effervescense was probably hampered]. A light but pleasing herbal smell ('cus it's brewed with herbs [yarrow, gale, & rosemary] rather than hops). Sweet but not too malty and quite smooth. [heck of a lot more drinkable than the Benevolance...not that that wasn't fun, I just couldn't take more than a half-pint]. Very Good and downright excellent on a brisk autumn day!"
"Basically though, a good beer. Not my favorite, its just not quite as spicy as the heather ale, but definitely worth a try."
"I was sharing in the weekapaug gruit at the CBC's 15th anniversary party For a hopless beer, this is one balanced and spicey ale. The grainy body is complimented by a spice bouquet. There's a lot of rosemary and yarrow to give this golden and headless brew a pleasant kick."
"VERY easy drinking and refreshing. The beer was extremely complex considering there are no hops added. I loved it."
"This gruit ale poured a hazy amber brown color with white foam that settled. The smell was somewhat sour with a pungent herbal aroma together with some malt, grain, and citrus. The taste was citrusy and herbal with some dry malt overtones and no bitterness. The mouthfeel was very dry and smooth and crisp with medium body and low carbonation. There was a citrusy feel and a malty, herbal aftertaste. This was a very interesting beer: nice and refreshing."
