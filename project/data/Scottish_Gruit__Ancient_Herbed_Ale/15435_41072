I like the unique terrior and the myrtle certainly comes across, with some woody spicy notes, all round an interesting gruit, certainly pushing different. Worth a try maybe, yet the bitterness or tartness could be ramped up to improve complexity.","mick303","0"

Beau's Bog Water is an interesting diversion, if nothing else - I wouldn't mind another bottle on occasion, but it's not something I'm going to be stocking up on or seeking out. I enjoyed this glass, and while the beer itself would make a fine after-dinner digestif, it's not the sort of stuff I'd be interested in drinking in large quantities. If spiced beers are your thing then this is definitely worth a shot - cheers to Beau's for having the guts to brew an obscure, esoteric beer style, even if it's not entirely up my alley.","thehyperduck","Feb 15, 2014"

3.42,-6.6,4,4.5,3,3,3,"Pours a deep, rich raisin brown that seems fairly clear with a nice head that leaves very light lacing. Tons of belgian esters on the nose including barnyard aromas along with notes of chocolate. Body is quite sweet with raisin notes and some herbal notes along with tartness and a cloying finish. Tart & cloying mouthfeel over time... Holy hell this is sweet. While I appreciate the attempt, I do not really like it... Meh. So much initial promise.","kjyost","Dec 22, 2012"

It is a distinct but appropriate winter seasonal and, unless I'm mistaken, the first Gruit attempted by a Canadian brewer. Bravo. Not something I'd have frequently, but once a year sounds good.","biegaman","Sep 09, 2012"

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of light sugar and caramel notes with light herb undertones. Taste is a mix between a solid malt backbone with some herbs and some light candi sugar. Body is fuller then average with low carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting though some additional carbonation would have helped.","Phyl21ca","Dec 24, 2011"

Smell is yeasty with tons of banana, brown sugary notes, some earthy-herbal notes, very fain alcohol as well. Taste is full of banana followed directly by herbal notes, spicy with banana coming back as well, some sips give flavours of chocolate, mild bitterness with an earthy finish. Medium dry carbonation, medium body with a fairly nice feel. Not bad, unique with some good interesting flavours, would revisit gladly.","peensteen","Dec 18, 2011"
3.74,2.2,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a translucent maroon, with some big head as the glass filled but disappeared as soon as the pour finished. Nose head, no lace and some modest carbonation coming off the bottom of the glass. Nose has lots of sweet caramel, some interesting yeast/fruit qualities that almost resemble a weizen in some respects (lots of banana here). Some interesting herbal notes, with a hint of spice. Quite intriguing, maybe a hint of alcohol as well. Taste has some overripe bananas, a hint of spice, with a touch of cocoa and caramel. Sweet malts, somewhat of a banana bread character to this; a touch of spice as well. A bit of bitterness and some definite alcohol in the finish, although it isn't too prohibitive. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, and carbonation is low, but kinda helps this out. An interesting pint, I would revisit this.","liamt07","Dec 16, 2011"

3.42,-6.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall - This one actually reminded me a bit of their 'Dunkel Buck' but with a lot less sweetness and taste. It had a very poor appearance and there was really nothing exciting about the beer. It almost tasted like ""gruit lite"" if such a thing existed. It needs a bump up in the flavour department and some more sweetness in the aftertaste.","spinrsx","0"
3.42,-6.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Not exactly what I was expecting, but an interesting brew nonetheless. And hell, it's almost 7% - always a plus in my book. But not really the gruit fix I was hoping for. Worth a try at any rate.","JohnnyBarman","Dec 13, 2011"
3.49,-4.6,3,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"O/D: Quite a pleasant brew, but under-performs in a couple of areas. Would benefit from a more robust late-taste/aftertaste, more carbonation, and a little more substance. That said, one could enjoy a few of these in a sitting without too much difficulty at all.","Foddz","Dec 12, 2011"
3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is one of the more interesting and unique Ontario offerings I've had to date. With that being said, it's not an exceptional one. I prefer their Kolsch over this. I'd still say this is worth a try.","ludachris","Dec 07, 2011"
3.34,-8.7,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"O/D - Interesting. Not overly pleasant though. A small sample would have done. The Sahti similarity is cool and the novelty of it scores it points, but more malt backbone would have dones this good with caramel or bready notes.","tbeckett","Nov 30, 2011"
4.04,10.4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Reminds me of their Dunkel Buck a bit. A very nice wild ale that, for me, ranks as the brewery's best seasonal. Easygoing, but satisfying.","bryehn","Nov 23, 2011"

The waiter told me it was made with gale which is an aromatic bog myrtle. I had no idea what to expect. It starts with a minty taste that soon wahse into something like ginger and licorice.it actually reminded me somewhat of a real root beer. I'm not sure that i would drink more than a pint of this at a go, but with a meal it was a very welcomed beer.","shamus","Beers"
4.36,19.1,3.5,5,4.5,3.5,4,"A standout beer, especially in Ontario. Beau's has taken an ancient tradition and used it in a completely different style. Ottawans can say they've got a beer nobody else does. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy... or it could have been the beer.","CanuckRover","0"
