"Not a bad brew. Not a lot of complexity but tastes good. I would drink again."
"The name of the beer suits the appearance to a tea. Actually the taste is very harsh and unusual. Not an everyday drinking beer."

"If this beer had some brett in it I think it would be awesome, quite nice offering as is. I like the unique terrior and the myrtle certainly comes across, with some woody spicy notes, all round an interesting gruit, certainly pushing different. Worth a try maybe, yet the bitterness or tartness could be ramped up to improve complexity."
"Overall - Pretty damn good gruit, whilst being something interesting and fairly unique. This still isn't my style but this is a very good effort. Definitely may pick up a couple bottles when my more experimental friends come over."

"Final Grade: 3.83, a solid B+. Beau's Bog Water is an interesting diversion, if nothing else - I wouldn't mind another bottle on occasion, but it's not something I'm going to be stocking up on or seeking out. I enjoyed this glass, and while the beer itself would make a fine after-dinner digestif, it's not the sort of stuff I'd be interested in drinking in large quantities. If spiced beers are your thing then this is definitely worth a shot - cheers to Beau's for having the guts to brew an obscure, esoteric beer style, even if it's not entirely up my alley."

"Thx for reading"
"Overall- This brew has the elements in place for the style and the flavour profile is quite different then other beers I am accustomed to. This beer may not be for everyone but for me, I found it enjoyable."

"Overall: interesting. Though I'm not too familiar with the style. Seems over carbonated, making it a little harsh, but its quite palate able overall."
""
""
"O: Waited too long to have this beer. This is a great gruit. To me it's like a better version of a Wee Heavy."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"Medium-bodied with somewhat low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Nice beer, and I don't mean this as a complaint since I enjoyed it, but there really is something about it that makes it seem more dunkelweisse than dubbel. But hey, those Belgian yeast strains can be pretty estery and phenolic as well."
""
"Final Thoughts: Well, it's not quite as good as the Muskoka Spring Oddity, but I'm glad to see another excellent Ontario beer utilizing Gruit and other herbs besides Hops. I'd love to see these guys do a Heather Ale after this."
""
"O - I love this beer. I love it every-time I get it, and I will continue to get this. Beau's All Naturals is one of the best breweries in Ontario by far!"
"Pours a deep, rich raisin brown that seems fairly clear with a nice head that leaves very light lacing. Tons of belgian esters on the nose including barnyard aromas along with notes of chocolate. Body is quite sweet with raisin notes and some herbal notes along with tartness and a cloying finish. Tart & cloying mouthfeel over time... Holy hell this is sweet. While I appreciate the attempt, I do not really like it... Meh. So much initial promise."

"Bog Water has the mildewy, earthy, forest-floor profile that recalls the 10,000 year old peat bog for which it's named and the surrounding countryside of a wet, cold Eastern Ontario. It is a distinct but appropriate winter seasonal and, unless I'm mistaken, the first Gruit attempted by a Canadian brewer. Bravo. Not something I'd have frequently, but once a year sounds good."
"O - It's Dubbel like profile is pretty average but the use of myrtle instead of hops certainly gives this one an interesting flavour."
""
"O: Very interesting, and I'm always glad to see a gruit on the market. It's not super punchy, but well done and interesting, especially in Ontario."
""
"O: I'm going by style here, and in the spiced/herb beer category this is really a great beer. It's interesting, refreshing, and something I really enjoy drinking. That kind of cola, root/birch beer taste combined with the nice malts and the sour yeast is a great combination. I'd actually buy six packs of this if it was a year-round option."
"Overall: a very interesting and complex experiment, like a lighter Belgian Abbey, but the hops and length are missed"
""
"D: Quite good with a strong herbal-grassy farmhouse-like element as advertised. Might not be something regularly stocked in my fridge but certainly would occasionally pick this up again."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of light sugar and caramel notes with light herb undertones. Taste is a mix between a solid malt backbone with some herbs and some light candi sugar. Body is fuller then average with low carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting though some additional carbonation would have helped."
"An interesting concept and an enjoyable beer, but little stands out to make this different from the dubbel pack."
"Hazy brown/ruby colour, collar of off white head, no lace at all, not as ugly as everyone said it was! Smell is yeasty with tons of banana, brown sugary notes, some earthy-herbal notes, very fain alcohol as well. Taste is full of banana followed directly by herbal notes, spicy with banana coming back as well, some sips give flavours of chocolate, mild bitterness with an earthy finish. Medium dry carbonation, medium body with a fairly nice feel. Not bad, unique with some good interesting flavours, would revisit gladly."
"Poured a translucent maroon, with some big head as the glass filled but disappeared as soon as the pour finished. Nose head, no lace and some modest carbonation coming off the bottom of the glass. Nose has lots of sweet caramel, some interesting yeast/fruit qualities that almost resemble a weizen in some respects (lots of banana here). Some interesting herbal notes, with a hint of spice. Quite intriguing, maybe a hint of alcohol as well. Taste has some overripe bananas, a hint of spice, with a touch of cocoa and caramel. Sweet malts, somewhat of a banana bread character to this; a touch of spice as well. A bit of bitterness and some definite alcohol in the finish, although it isn't too prohibitive. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, and carbonation is low, but kinda helps this out. An interesting pint, I would revisit this."
"O- Very interesting style. Belgian dubbel in all aspects with a little ganja. Not bad, not great."
"Overall - This one actually reminded me a bit of their 'Dunkel Buck' but with a lot less sweetness and taste. It had a very poor appearance and there was really nothing exciting about the beer. It almost tasted like ""gruit lite"" if such a thing existed. It needs a bump up in the flavour department and some more sweetness in the aftertaste."
"Not exactly what I was expecting, but an interesting brew nonetheless. And hell, it's almost 7% - always a plus in my book. But not really the gruit fix I was hoping for. Worth a try at any rate."
"O/D: Quite a pleasant brew, but under-performs in a couple of areas. Would benefit from a more robust late-taste/aftertaste, more carbonation, and a little more substance. That said, one could enjoy a few of these in a sitting without too much difficulty at all."
"This is one of the more interesting and unique Ontario offerings I've had to date. With that being said, it's not an exceptional one. I prefer their Kolsch over this. I'd still say this is worth a try."
"O/D - Interesting. Not overly pleasant though. A small sample would have done. The Sahti similarity is cool and the novelty of it scores it points, but more malt backbone would have dones this good with caramel or bready notes."
"Reminds me of their Dunkel Buck a bit. A very nice wild ale that, for me, ranks as the brewery's best seasonal. Easygoing, but satisfying."

"On cask at C'est What. Pours a murky orange colour with hints of brown/amber. Head starts out thick, but dissipates to small ring on the top. Some lacing down the glass. Smells of berries and spices, can't quite put my finger on exactly what I'm smelling. Very sweet flavour, but still some tartness. Smooth mouthfeel. Quite a different beer, but nice."
"This has a wonderfully quirky complexity that is sure to be misunderstood by unseasoned palates but for those who can appreciate the melding of a number of uncommon complimentary flavors, this is a brew you can relish and not be shy about having a couple."
"Weird olden-times brews like this are neat to try, and I would probably drink more of this if hops were to suddenly vanish, but in the meantime, one is enough for my new-fangled palate."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. I dug this one, good stab at the style."
"D: Very drinkable for it's weight (and lack of hops!)."
"myrtle is lemony and adds a citrus tang to tea. As a hop replacement, this is odd and different and queer. Dark brown with off-white soapy head, and lacey. Horse smell in there, vegetable aroma and in taste. Medium mouthfeel and aggressive carbonation."
"I had this at the Black Tomato in Ottawa. I liked the Beau's Lug Tread which had a fresh cut grass or hay flavour, so I was more than willing to give this a try. The waiter told me it was made with gale which is an aromatic bog myrtle. I had no idea what to expect. It starts with a minty taste that soon wahse into something like ginger and licorice.it actually reminded me somewhat of a real root beer. I'm not sure that i would drink more than a pint of this at a go, but with a meal it was a very welcomed beer."
"A standout beer, especially in Ontario. Beau's has taken an ancient tradition and used it in a completely different style. Ottawans can say they've got a beer nobody else does. Makes me feel all warm and fuzzy... or it could have been the beer."
