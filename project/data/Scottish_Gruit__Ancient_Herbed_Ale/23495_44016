4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear orange body with minimal head and little lace.  Aroma is spicy and not something one usually finds in a beer - anise and ginger stick out.  Medium bodied beer that is a little sticky and sweet, yet balanced with spices like anise, ginger and rosemary.  Clean beer, easy to drink, nice finish.  Not your typical beer (i.e. ipas, stouts) and was well worth trying.","clayrock81","Jan 31, 2015"

My glass was devoid of lacing less than half way through, which made my glass feel naked. The nose is full of spices, citrus, and herbs. I get a face full of bay leaf right off the bat and hints of the rosemary and ginger. Looking for the anise and caraway, but couldn't lock onto any of those licorice-like aromatics. Taste is tart, but very herbaceous. Lemon and lemon rind, full of pith. Bitter botanicals from the steeping of the herbs and spices. The bay and rosemary really come through in the front, with ginger playing a supporting role, the caraway and anise are there if you really go looking for them, but are easily lost in the complex dance of flavors on this stage. The lasting finish is dry with a prolonged bitterness on the palate that reminds me of over-steeping lemon peels in hot tea. The bay sticks around for a long while. I don't pick up any of the wheat, nor much of the rosemary, but this is one worth returning to more than once, to ponder the depths of this polyglot brew. Mouth-feel is light and the carbonation is not very high in comparison to the initial head, but present enough to play its part.","logicalparadox","May 25, 2014"

Amazing aroma of rosemary, bay leaves, ginger, apple juice, light citrus; other unidentifiable aromatic herbs. Much like a kitchen dried potpourri. Starts with apple and pear juice, light grape juice; slightly vinous, aromatic herbs dominated by rosemary, slightly sweet. Finishes abruptly with dry, earthy herbs, leaving a light, but pleasant dried herb aftertaste. Light bodied. A very enjoyable reconstruction of this ancient ale style. Although I have greatly enjoyed some of the other, sweeter, gruit reconstructions from Scottish and American breweries, this one struck me as more authentic. A part of me wished for a bit more ABV to bring out the intensity of the bittering herbs.

Some very interesting aromas with good strength and decent balance. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, wheat, rosemary, basil, ginger, pepper, clove, anise, and herbal spiciness. Very slight tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, spices, herbs, wheat, and pepper on the finish for a very short bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity; quite dry on the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel that is nice.

First few sips were floral and called to mind rosewater and coriander. As the beer warmed, a distinct spearmint flavor emerged. Mouthfeel was a bit thin with some wheat-like notes. Some ginger and other aromatics lurk. Final pour decanted a fair bit of unattractive brown sediment.","Brent","Nov 01, 2011"

I think this is a style that a lot of breweries could really use to showcase their creativity, I'd like to see more of the style.

Not sure if it's a sour or bitter flavor, akin to a saison. I was pleased to find they used anis instead of juniper berries, although it's not a dominant flavor. This a great, light drink.

3.33,-12.8,3.5,3,3,3,4.5,"500 mL German bottle with no freshness date. Brewed at Weihenstephan from a base of barley and wheat, and spiced with bay leaves, ginger, caraway, anise, rosemary, gentian and ""pollinated wild hops."" Brilliant pale gold color, with an inch of noisy head that leaves no lacing. The bouquet starts with ginger and caraway and finishes with, well, ginger and caraway. On the palate there is mostly ginger and rosemary, contributing spice and pine respectively. A dash of malt is in there as well, along with some lemon and a slightly lower pH that helps keep the flavors bright. Its very light, very dry and highly carbonated body gives the impression of tonic water. I doubt that this beer is in any way historically accurate, as I have trouble believing that any beer brewed in the 1200's (including small beer) was this light in color, this dry, this lightly spiced and this cleanly fermented. However, it is possible that the gruit blend is accurate and I applaud Prof. Briem for at least spreading the knowledge of a long-forgotten family of beers. It is no doubt approachable and easy to drink - so much so that it could conceivably be a nice crossover beer for your macro friends - but I feel it lacks a bit in character.","mmmbeer","Jan 23, 2011"

At first, these workers are adrift in a sea of vague bitterness, but, of course, they wait until after work to let their hair down: At last, a wash of various flavors, anise, peppercorn, ginger, honey, nutmeg, and that minty bastard again, all dance toegether in such a harmony as to make a Benatton collection feel insecure enough to venture into a Wal-Mart or something. In Max's buddy Bobby's words, ""It's pretty scrumptious"". Look it up, dammit. As bodies go, this one is pretty lithe and readily shows its ability to glide through the mouth, in arabesque, of course, while not suffering from over-effervescence (don't you just HATE the overly bubbly ones?

2.83,-25.9,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This is a fizzy yellow beer, and that's not a bad thing, I think. Poured from a bottle into a glass, there is absolutely no head, hte carbonation is a bunch of large bubbles and its steady. It is light yellow, the lightest i've ever seen a beer, and completely clear. The smell is of spice only, almost like Chai Tea. Interesting. Taste is sour and dry. Almost like lemon soda. Cloves, anise, rosemary, its hard to drink. Not feeling this beer. Too spicy, its overwhelming. Sorry Grut Bier, not a repeat.","drabmuh","Sep 21, 2009"

I could see this as a lunch time beer with food, possibly with a turkey sandwich or chicken salad wrap.

People who use this site to find good beer as I do on occasion would be upset to go by this review in my opinion.

4.12,7.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy yellow with a decent white head. Rich aroma is malty and just a little bit fruity, rather appetizing.

4.01,5,3,4.5,4,3.5,4,"I don't know what this is supposed to look at. It's like yellow, very hazy, with loose bubbles and a thin head. Looks a bit like a Mt. Dew or something. I can't say I'm impressed, but I can't say I'm disappointed. I'm exited to dig in to something I've never seen before. The smell is what gets me. Just incredibly powerful on the floral notes, not hops, but just flowers, herbs. Maybe like rosemary, cardaomom, saffron cinnamon, coriander, I can't put my finger on it exactly, like I walked into some kind of herb shop or flower shop. Really out there, and not beery, but very pleasant. I do get a hint of sweetness, but mostly spiciness. The taste continues with the spiciness, but there's more beeriness to this one. I can taste a nice light, powdery maltiness, with some pils malt flavor, maybe some melanoids. Then the herbal, floral, spicy flavors hit full force - all the things I mentioned before, like fruity indian cooking almost - or like a really powerful and dry root beer. I can't say that it's my favorite drink on earth, like a strange tea that you enjoy drinking every once in a while. The body is thin, I didn't expect much different, but its not watery, there's enough to keep it together. Nice carbonation level to bring the herbs to the front. Overall, it goes down well, clean, a pleasant drink. I'm not sure this is a beer you'd want more than one of, but I'd recommend it for an interesting drink. I can't compare it to others in the style, but I would say this is an excellent example.","taylorhamrick","Jun 05, 2009"

Some banana and pepper, with Vick's vaporub. A bit bizarre but pleasant. The taste is like a Hefe spritzer, with lemon juice, more vaporub action, and other various herbs. A light and very spritzy feel, finishes sweet and tart. Most definitely a different brew, but it was enjoyable. Very light and refreshing. Flavors are a bit bizarre but they work together.","Gmann","Mar 26, 2009"

3.97,3.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A very pale yellow with a slight haze. Has a good foamy white head that evaporates quickly. I agree with the bay leaf analogy from an earlier review (the first whiff from the bottle made me think of bay rumm after shave). The spice character is the first thing to hit you in the aroma. With the spicy hop notes and light malt character coming in behind. Bay leaf, rosemary and ginger are easy to pick up. The flavor is very light on the palate. With the ginger getting first not and the rosemary/bay leaf showing up on the back of the tongue. Served chilled this still had a marvelous aroma and quenching mouthfeel. I'll look for it again this summer.","ybnorml","Feb 11, 2009"
3.92,2.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours light yellow with a whitish internal haze. Smells like bay leaf shaving cologne. Mouthfeel is both creamy and a tad sour with fizzy carbonation.

It's a bit like a spiced wit of hefe in that there's a lot of lemon, ginger and pepper flavors. The body is drinkable and the mellow bready malts are fairly smooth. Certainly worth a try for something different in the style.","tempest","Jan 02, 2009"

Ginger, lemon and rosemary dominate but it's a bbig salad of spice. Tastes like a ginger beer with some mint mouthwash and an almost medicinal aftertaste like alka seltzer. Finish is somewhat dry and refreshing. Not too bad, very drinkable.","mbrasi","Dec 29, 2008"

It's really effervescent and that carries it along well. Easy to finish the 16 oz.","emerge077","Dec 04, 2008"

Tons of spice and floral yeast esters make up the huge nose, notes of cinnamon spice, pumpkin pie, ginger, nutmeg, all spice, banana bread, white grapes and lemon zest. Crisp in body initially but rounded out by a semi-sweet and coating toasty wheat backbone. Lots of floral and grassy aromas and flavors going on also, herbal and slightly medicinal. Different, no doubt, but overall very pleasant, light and refreshing. Im a fan of gruit's but i must say beers that fall into this style may not be for everyone.","ATPete","Nov 16, 2008"
