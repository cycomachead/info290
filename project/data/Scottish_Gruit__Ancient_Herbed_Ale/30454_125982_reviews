"Overall it's enjoyable enough to try but I wasn't compelled to drink more."
"Overall: I don't know much about this style or its ingredients but I really enjoyed it. Props to Spiteful for attempting such a rare style and in my opinion executing it very well. Tired of the endless cycle of IPAs and big beers? This is a brew for you."
