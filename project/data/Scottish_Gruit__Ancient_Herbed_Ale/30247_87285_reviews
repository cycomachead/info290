"Draught @ Brewery: Stopped here after the Granite State Growler tour. This one pours a hazy amber color. There was almost no head or lacing with this one. It has an interesting nose. Earthy, definitely get some juniper and faint heather. The taste is good. Malty with no real hops noticeable. No real sweetness either. Some juniper. Unique and very good!"

"Poured from a 32oz growler into an imperial pint glass. Color was a medium amber with a fair amount of haze to it. Next to no head when poured, and nothing shortly there after. A few small occasional streams of bubbles rose from the sides/bottom. The aroma was a bit strange. Had a definite herbal smell, but reminded me of tuna fish. Flavor was surprisingly sweet and balanced. Some unherbal flavors up front, but then shifted to a berry flavor, but not overly sweet. Coated the mouth nicely, not that much carbonation however. Overall not bad, aroma was a kick in the face, but the flavor more than made up for it."
"Cloudy amber pour, with a thin off-white head; minimal retention and lacing. Herbal aroma, notes of pine and meadow grass. Taste reflected the scent, with a bready malt base, pine needles, juniper berries making an appearance but not overwhelming anything, herbal and earthy, and something almost woody in there as well. Medium body, lower carbonation, and a nice beer overall."

"The beer pours like murky swamp water, a gross yellowed brown, almost like cider. A light white head forms and fizzes away, leaving a slight head/scrim behind. The body is, as I have already said, murky and indiscernible. Honestly, if this weren’t a gruit I would say it was an ugly beer, but it being what it is, it just looks fascinating. On the nose this beer is light and earthy, with some great candy bread scents and a nice earthy must that I assume is heather tips and juniper berries. Almost sweet caramel is also present, and as I push my nose more into it and let the beer warm up I get more of a smell that is earthy and enticing. In taste, the beer begins with light sweet bread and then opens into spicy bread and herb notes. The taste feels fresh and herbal, with a slight minty tingle in the aftertaste, but still very strong earthy bread notes. The more I drink the more I notice that the minty fresh flavor actually is their throughout the sip, lying below the more forward flavors of the beer and adding a crisp refreshing bite to the beer that does give slight sweet berry notes. As the beer warms up I note caramelly sweet notes and very slight roasted flavors lingering in the flavor. On the mouth this beer is thin and highly drinkable, crisply kissing the tongue to refresh it, and leaving the mouth only slightly wet with saliva, but overall clean and refreshing. I’m not sure if it is the thought that I am drinking an herbal beer, or if it’s the actual beer, but I feel a lot of the tingling healthy affect that herbal tea imparts on my mouth, which is superbly refreshing and highly fantastic in a beer. Earth Eagle is a new brewery that is specializing in brewing (though not exclusively) gruits which are superb, and I am really excited to see what they do with them. William Wallace is a fantastic start to their gruit brewing, and I am really excited to see where they go from here. I may be stepping ahead of myself, but I feel this brewery may be one of the major starts of the American Gruit style, and I am excited to see where it goes! Overall this beer is terrifically drinkable, refreshing, and an all around great beer. A wonder gruit for sure!"
