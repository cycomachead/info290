3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before March 2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden amber color with a small 1 finger white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of gooseberry, cherry, apple, herbal, floral, honey, light caramel, bread, grain, and wheat. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, bread, pear, light berry, toasted grain, wheat, herbal, floral, and light herbal spiciness. Lingering notes of caramel, light fruits, bread, toasted grain, wheat, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Solid flavor balance and complexity; with a fair amount of flavors, but does border being watery a bit; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Slightly dry on the finish. Gooseberry flavor was not as prominent as I would have hoped. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice herbal ancient ale style. Nice flavor balance with decent complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. I enjoyed this quite a bit.","superspak","Nov 14, 2012"

3.55,0.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Final Grade: 3.55, a B grade. Grozet Gooseberry & Wheat Ale is a respectable offering, but not a very memorable one. It sort of reminds me of an American pale wheat ale with a slight touch of herbs and berries; a borderline bland base with nearly enough accents to make it interesting, but not quite getting there. The wheat malt and herb flavours actually do work quite well together, and it's certainly quite drinkable, but I doubt I'll be clamoring for another any time soon. I'm not sure what gooseberries are supposed to taste like, but I do know that using more probably would have made this a bit more interesting. I'll give this brew a thumbs up, but it's a wavering sort of one - probably not worth picking up on its own, but not a bad inclusion in this sampler.","thehyperduck","Nov 10, 2012"

Can't really pick up the wheat here. Taste follows along the same trail, more grassy, herbal, and earth notes with the berry as well, I guess gooseberry takes on some blackberry/currant characteristics. Again, I can't seem to find the wheat here but the malts is more cereal-y and crackery. Light mouthfeel and a carbonation that resmebles a macro.

Distinctive layers in the taste: starts very pungent with fruit (described in the aroma); a bit of funk, and a little spice in the middle, with some citrus hops coming through; and then a final little unexpected blast of sweet & sour, which is the best way I can describe it.

The taste attempts to follow, but the gruit-style spices dull the citrusy and sweet flavors, replacing them with a middling melange of herbal and spicy notes. The overall taste resembles a bitter piece of old pineapple, or the inside of an orange peel.

The beer had some carbonation but tasted a bit flat. It was slightly hazy, maybe a little dirty water golden in color. The nose is floral, a bit grainy, perhaps a bit of grape skin or vinous qualities. The taste is just too flat and thin to be overly interesting. I'm getting some sweet berry flavors, presumably the gooseberry, some hop in the background; this is just too thin, a touch on the tart side, a bit of a vinous grape skin quality, as the nose would indicate.

The feel is light, with almost flat carbonation, finishes fairly crisp and dry. Quite the unique fruit wheat ale.

The palate is right along with the nose, unfortunately. Quite malty up front, with some notes of green apple, pear, and grape. Not very ""berry"" at all. All the flavors here are very subtle, leaving this beer oddly thin and uninteresting to me. Definitely not a challenge to the palate.

Flavor is smooth up front, but the grainy wheat comes in quickly, coupled with a lingering bready malt flavor that is felt more than tasted. Overall impression of the flavor is its herbal quality. Fruit comes in a flash of sweetness, but quickly moves to a slighly acidic flavor that lasts into the aftertaste, causing a minor drying effect, along with a bit of sourness.

I don't think that gooseberry is ever going to be a favorite fruit in my book, as the flavor is just not my bag. It doesn't seem flawed, I just don't enjoy it as much as I could. Feel is moderate with just a hint of carbonation. I'd like a little more bubble in this one, as it would add some sharpness that I think would work well with the flavor. Overall, this one is okay.

Dry and grassy at first, but does yield quite a strong malt profile considering the other flavors going on here. Reminds me very much of Heavyweight's Juhlia, and even moreso? A real Snakebite like you'd get in a real Irish pub, complete with the black currant on top, though certainly not that sweet.

Their is a malt presence as well, which is the only indication my nose detects of this being an ale. Now, for taste, I must warn. This is my first time having anything gooseberry. And I've come to the conclusion I don't like gooseberries. So I must say, I don't like the taste. However, this is supposed to have the gooseberry flavour, so I won't give it a low score simply for containing something I don't like. Would it be fair to give an IIPA a low score if the reviewer hates a hoppy flavour? No. Strong gooseberry taste. I find anyways. Dry wine flavour as well, reminds me of a good red. Wheat, barley, and a bit of heather and honey as well. Mouthfeel is dry and a little granular. Drinkability is tough, for the same reason taste was tough. Would I drink this again? I doubt it, unless I aquire a taste for gooseberries. Personally, I'd give drinkability a 1.5. But, I gotta keep in mind the style of beer this is. I'll give it a three. Why?

The smell is assertively fruity but not overly sweet. It also has an interesting herbal/medicinal smell. The taste is vaguely berry-like, but the flavor sort of lingers on the back end.

Very slight, almost non-existant head...big, balloon-like bubbles near the edge of the glass. The aroma is amazing...very fruity, but hard to place. The citrus twang of a wheat beer is evident in the aroma and taste, but it's subtle. There's a floral mix in the aroma too...I mean truely floral, like a flower shop. Tangy, perfumy, and soft. Truly unique and an absolute blast to experience.","Suds","Dec 07, 2003"

Good taste, goes down easy. Could easily drink this with no problem one after the other. Not one of those beers that after drinking one that you are too full to drink anymore.","JISurfer","Oct 10, 2003"

1.93,-45.2,3.5,3,1,2,2,"A vigorous pour yielded 2 fingers of white froth atop a hazy honey colored ale. Has a starchy muskiness to its aroma with slight citrusy wheat note. Head has settled down quickly and retains abit with lacing. Mouthfeel is rather flat feeling with a slight dryness. Flavor is completely unusual and a bit unpleasant. A bit sour and earthy with a staleness added to it. I'm not sure if I'll finish this one or not. Not a good tasting brew.","BierReise","Aug 22, 2003"
4.32,22.7,4,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,"The highlight for me is clearly the aroma. It's hazed, light appearance is an obvious prelude to the slightly wheaty, refreshing characteristics. But the nose is where it's at: An exotic mix of lemon, lemon balm, and rotting berries delights the senses and comes in waves to be savored and contemplated. The flavor is reminiscent of chewing on lemon grass and drinking chamomile herbal tea. Leaves a slight cottonmouth-ish feeling. The body is thin and slightly anemic. A little more carbonation and body would carry this really unique beer into the stratosphere.","marburg","Aug 20, 2003"
2.58,-26.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"NOTE: OLD BOTTLE TASTED! Medium brown color, slightly cloudy. Small head. Aroma is fruity, more applish than berrish. A light bodied wheat. More apple cider like than beer. No real malt or hop taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is fruity. After notes were taken, I noticed the best by date was Oct 2000. This beer was tasted nearly 30 month after that date. Will need to re-taste with a fresh beer.","beerguy101","Aug 19, 2003"

In my notes I wrote gross but interesting, as if someone picked two styles of beer to mix together that shouldn't be mixed. It's not bad, but I probably won't be reaching for this on again.","taez555","Aug 05, 2003"
4.6,30.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Nose of buttery, whole wheat and charred Alpine cheese. There is a smart, sunny tartness that lifts the ample maltiness and creates detailed, delicate balance. After sniffing at it for ten minutes from a wine glass there does in fact emerge a subtle smell of sweet, thick-skinned black berry. It is an enigma. The more I focus on it, the less obvious it becomes. A slight smoky graphite flavor emerges later too. Clean. hazel. dry dry.","putnam","Jul 25, 2003"

But I don't think I will be drinking this again anytime soon. It has a variety of flavors but they don't blend the best. I taste grains and a tartness to this beer. The gooseberries were definitely recognized, esp. in the aftertaste. This tasted better after the first couple of sips. Overall a decent, not terrific, beer","granger10","Jul 12, 2003"

IMHO Grozet is way to thin for a re-creation of a 500 year old Scotch monastic brew. My hat is off to Heather Ale for their attempts of keeping historic brewing methods and ingredients alive; but this one needs to be reworked, IMHO.","purplehops","Jun 01, 2003"

The finish has a ""Wee Bit of Hops", scarcely carbonated, and a dry lingering aftertaste.

Starts out sweet and ends a tiny bit sour in the finish, but still refreshing. I don't believe that I have ever had anything like this. I still think this is worth trying if you have never had it.","CharlesRiver","Nov 22, 2002"
3.8,8,3,3,4,4,4.5,"Fairly hazy, light orange in color, with very low carbonation. No head at all to speak of from the bottle I poured. Tart, citrusy and very acidic aroma. The flavor is much sweeter than it would lead you to expect. Fruity and berry-like, with perhaps a hint of banana lingering in the background. The wheat flavors balance the beer out nicely, though, and prevent it from being cloying. Light-bodied, with a lightly sweet finish, with a mild berry aftertaste. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Good summer ale.","mzwolinski","Nov 20, 2002"
3.82,8.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer is straw colored and a bit hazy with a thin white head that quickly dissipates.  It has a slightly herbaceous aroma (gooseberries I guess. I've never tasted one before).  A light-bodied brew, the grape sweet tart flavors are obvious but do not overwhelm...balanced by crisp, dry grain.  Carbonation is tight, almost champagne-like.  This would make a good summer quencher.","johnrobe","Nov 01, 2002"

The flavour had gooseberries, I'll agree, but I detected something of a more sprucey flavour.  Strange really.   We'll blame it on my stuffed nose due to the cold weather recently.  Still, I liked it.   And I'll have to try it again later.  I'm most intrigued by the bogmyrtle and meadowsweet which are listed in the ingredients....","the42ndtourist","Oct 30, 2002"
1.56,-55.7,3,2,1.5,1,1,"Small brown bottle with September '03 expiration date. Pours a cloudy, pale, nearly peach color. Smell was somewhat metallic, and harsh. Very different. Taste was very oddly tart, overly tart, and highly acidic, to the point where my eyes nearly bugged out of my head.  There is a point when tastes fade from subtle to non-existant. This is such a case. Other than drinking a sweet-tart with seltzer water, I can't even describe this.  Very thin, watery, oddly metallic finish. Sorry I couldn't finish this one. It may be a bad batch, I read the article before drinking it, but just not for me. A horrible concoction never again to be sipped.","StevieW","Oct 16, 2002"
3.92,11.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I'm not sure if I like this beer... ... or I love it! Definitely unique. I wasn't sure about it at first. It needs to grow on you. Tawny golden color with a thin, lightly lingering head. I'm not sure of the aroma - I guess it's the gooseberry that's supposedly included. However, there's more of a citrusy side to it. It's not unpleasant, but curious. The body is light/medium and a slight tartness combined with moderate carbonation gives it a somewhat thin appearance on the palate. The flavor opens up much more than the aroma indicates with an odd, juicy, subtly tart character that is compelling. Soft and well balanced. Finishes with a lingering fruity dryness. Quite refreshing once you get past it's quirkiness. Not real complex, but memorable. A sleeper.","NeroFiddled","Aug 09, 2002"
2.46,-30.1,3,2,2.5,3,2.5,"I was less than impressed with this beer. The aroma was a little sour and overall not appealing and first sip reminded me vaguely of water (maybe because of it's lack of taste?) The second sip got better as did the following sips as I started to pick up more of the gooseberry flavor. Very little malt presence (says it's a wheat ale on the label)and the berry flavor dominates the flavor profile. After I had hit the halfway point, this beer becaem harder and harder to drink. Maybe I'm just not that big of a fan of gooseberries. Maybe I just don't like kool-aid mixed with my beer.","aracauna","Jun 09, 2002"

Appearance is hazy gold with a dense head, suspended and precipitated yeasties. Lemon grassy, wheat aroma. Taste is very tart, crisp. I'm not sure I'd recognize the taste of a gooseberry, but the fruit seems to impart a sour, tarty flavor. Mellows a little when it warms. I can see this as a good warm weather brew.","John","May 22, 2002"
