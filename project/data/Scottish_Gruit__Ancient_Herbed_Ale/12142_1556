Underneath, but still fairly prominent, is what must be the seaweed. It's unlike anything I've ever had. Not at all unpleasant. Tastes like the ocean. Not salty at all... but then again, maybe there is a hint of it. Minerals. Makes me want to reread Innsmouth by Lovecraft- this is probably what they were drinking there. Or maybe rewatch the Wicker Man (the original). Low carbonation. Medium to light bodied. I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts in this case. Maybe this is just good and not great, but it's a must try all the same.","burnstar","Nov 10, 2013"

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, deep, ruby highlighted dark brown coloring with no head. Aromas of toffee and nut, with some earthy highlights. The nose leans towards a malt bomb of a beer. We shall see. Flavors are a bit more earthy than the nose lets on, with a rich, nut and toffee sweetness forming the backbone. Green, gritty highlights and a touch of brine keeps the brew somewhat light despite the heavy malt characteristics. Smooth and clean in mouth, the beer has a slightly tangy sweet and roasted aftertaste. Light, clean finish. Heavy flavors for such a light ABV, making this surprisingly drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Aug 21, 2012"

3.52,-2.8,3,3.5,4,2,3.5,"The beer pours a dark, dark brown that is pretty much black chocolate. There is a nice but uneven finger width head the color of cream with a hint of coffee. The head dwindles down to a slight half-finger width and slowly dissipates leaving a thin outlining of lacing. There does seem to be some good carbonation hiding in the blackness of this beer. The beer smells rich with chocolate malts and salt with an oh-so-slight brine tingle. The beer tastes slightly smoky with peat malts and chocolate. There is also a definite oceanic tint to this beers flavor with slight hints of salt and I assume the seaweed. It is a very interesting taste and actually quite pleasant, like a sea salt chocolate beer. The mouthfeel is very thin and watery, mildly reminiscent of the ocean, though that may be because I am thinking seaweed… While its thinness is a little disappointing, it makes the drink quite drinkable. The after taste leaves a weird lightly brine-like taste while leaving the mouth clean yet slimy, if that makes any sense. Overall this is not a terrible beer. The mouthfeel is definitely off but the taste is unique and refreshing which definitely makes up for it. It is more of a sipper than other beers though, despite its weak mouthfeel. This beer is worth a try if for nothing else than the fact that it has seaweed in it which is weird and different.","Maxwell","Jul 25, 2012"
3.7,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"An unusual brew, but goes down nicely. Could be described as oyster stout for vegetarians. The aroma has a distinct chocolate note that is rather pleasing, while the flavour is balanced but a tad less substantial. Lies somewhere between a brown ale and a porter, with plenty of dark malt character. The seaweed doesn't exactly come through, but it possesses a mild salty twist. Tasty, and well worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Jul 16, 2012"

The taste isn't nearly as strange as I expected, this is just a solid English style brown with just a bit of salt on the end, probably from the seaweed. It's a robustly malty ale otherwise, with a touch of chocolate flavors that work well with the salt. The mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a solid brown ale made ever so slightly interesting with the touch of salt.","shand","Jun 18, 2012"

Two finger head is a creamy tan color and has solid retention but very little lacing left behind. On top of a roasted porter-like malt scent is an odd kind of clean salty brine smell that has absolutely no fishiness whatsoever to it. Flavor is once again like a weaker porter, well balanced with mild hopping on top of a roasted barley foundation, but it also has the slightly thicker umami feel that I have experienced from seaweed soup at a Japanese restaurant, only none of the seaweed flavor....Honestly I was bracing myself expecting to taste and/or smell seaweed and feel strangely disappointed. The seaweed really does just come across as a slightly heavier fuller body and a mild whiff of sea breeze. Otherwise, a fairly nice mild porter.","WastingFreetime","Dec 20, 2011"

Aroma is inviting with notes of deep earthy sweet dark chocolate malt, fresh oatmeal, and a significant milky note to complement. Smells like a more intense version of a chocolate milk. The general feel and taste on the palate is quite different that what the nose indicates. Deep roasted malt character is clearly present but mellowed out by the herbal (Seaweed?) and perhaps hop character that runs a smooth and lightly crisp agenda from start to finish with ending notes of dry cocoa and very lightly salted nuts.

Maybe I'm just adding this subconsciously, but to me, it was there. Taste is rich bitter chocolate up front with slight burnt sugar and roasted nuts. There's a smoky/briny note in the flavor as well, but it comes across more in the after taste than during the drink. Really creamy feel and very easy to drink.

The scent is rather unique, it reminds me greek olives, and a little bit of ocean air-- just the saltiness, I guess, though since its flavored with seaweed, that makes sense. The flavor is a lot like other darker beers-- not as rich as a barleywine or stout, but with a lot more flavor and weight than, say, Anchor Steam. I'm still not quite up to my beer knowledge to be able to pick everything out, but the flavor does have a little bit of bitterness to it, and in some ways reminds me of the brine of olives even-- though that might just be because of the scent. It felt nice in my mouth, a thick feel without too much carbonation, easy to drink. Its different, unique, and maybe not something I'd like a lot of in one sitting, but my one 500mL bottle? pretty nice serving size, especially since this particular booze is weaker than I typically drink.

The flavors were full of roasted malt, chocolate, light peat smoke, coffee, biscuity malt, a bit of saltiness, and a semi-bitter finish of hops. The aftertaste did indeed have seaweed in it and goddamn was it weird! It is to be noted I awarded rather than withdrew points for this weirdness due to the fact that it was supposed to taste like that.

Since it reminds me so much of a porter, I am having trouble deciding if I really like its differences or if it has problems meeting my expectations.

If I wasn't told this had kelp in it, I wouldn't notice probably although it does have a mineral thing going on. Flavor starts off with some roasted grain and light chocolate. In the middle there is that mineral presence again along with some raisin. Finishes very dry and with a touch of saltiness. Mouthfeel is rather light on the palate, but manages to not be thin.

The taste is very mellow, a bit watery, sweet, chocolate, raisin, coffee. The high point is the mouthfeel which is very smooth and very mellow. There are no real hops notes in this beer. It's all malt, some grassiness, and no real after taste. After the beer warms a bit, there is a very slight hop bitterness coming through at the very end. That something extra in the flavor is the seaweed, I assume, and if anything, perhaps the seaweed has an ameliorating effect that smooths out the mouthfeel and the aftertaste, but I'm making some assumptions here.

The taste is very nice, chocolate malt, which tend to make it somewhat sweet. Has a nice hop finish, not much but enough to balance out the sweetness, while also noticing a salt lake flavor. Has a dry feel as well. Over all, I like this brew.

3.65,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Kelpie is a thick dark brown colour, seemingly black. The head, which was fizzy but still very consistent and creamy, is a cola-brown or root beer head colour. Lacing which moved rapidly in sheets. The aroma is not quite expected, but the chocolate and coffee maltiness is very strong. There IS a touch of something salty behind the malt. The cardinal aroma here though is milk chocolate. Raisins, root beer, and coffee grounds as well. Sniffing somewhat above the glass, there is a bit of a sea-water smell--a little sourness, metallic, reminding me just briefly of that difficult-to-define smell in Orval Trappist Ale. The aroma is not too noticeably different from some amber ales or stouts, but is still very appetising, and incredibly refreshing somehow. It also improves after breathing for a few minutes in the glass. My summation of the aroma: like a good malty stout but with a tad more salinity. The taste is fairly one-dimensional: soft dark malts, a little hard-water taste, and maybe the subtle hint of sourness or saltiness from the sea-weed. The malt adds some brown sugar, brown bread, and some chocolate, but there really is not much complexity to be had. Again, that is not entirely unexpected for such an old recipe, when taste was probably not as paramount a concern for the everyday person as much as slaking thirst was. The body is quite thin, a little watery, and the carbonation medium. Drinkable, but not something I would drink more than two of at one sitting. I, for one, am glad to have finally tried it, and anyone else seeing it should pick it up and taste a little history.","Cwrw","Nov 10, 2005"

My mouth felt like wet grass had been placed in it. The sharpness of sea salt and boiled veggies is what I couldn't get rid of. I did not enjoy this brew at all. I'm glad I tried a different style, but this was my first and last time. The whole concept of including seaweed is rather repulsive, but I tried to keep an open mind and was willing to try it.

3.4,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The Kelpie seaweed ale has always held a mild fascination for me, trying to wrap my brain around a briney character in beer. It pours out a dark cola colour, reddish chestnut highlights when held to the light. There is very little head, deep tan the few seconds it lasts, with no retention whatsoever. I thought salt would add to retention. There are notes of rich caramel and chocolate malts on the nose before the salt barges in and takes over the show. After that the brine dominates, the malt only breaks through in small gasps. Curious, and not a bad thing, just very curious. At first the flavour possesses a rich sweet caramel malt character, even a touch of currants can be detected, but the brine picks up momentum on the finish, acting in the place of hops. The mouthfeel is watery yet full, it rolls over the tongue but possesses some body to it. The aftertaste is sweet at first, and then turns to salt. This is certainly not a session beer by any means, although it possesses its own charm of sorts, a sort of drinkable museum, replecating a style of ale that has long since become obsolete, except possibly in small pockets in Scotland with no export distribution or demand outside of local counties.","IronDjinn","Mar 03, 2005"

Poured much darker than I expected with a vigorous yet controlled frothy tan head. It smelled mostly malty but with a little musty, salty hint of something different. The taste was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything different either. Tasted like a thin porter. Somewhat malty with an underlying bitterness.

Overall a decent beer with a dissapointing mouthfeel and an odd lingering aftertaste.","fattyre","Aug 02, 2003"
3.9,7.7,4,4,4,3,4,"Overall Impression: A surprisingly normal beer. I was a little taken aback when I first saw it on the shelf. Thought it would taste a lot more... I don't know... kelpie. Tastes pretty much like a porter, a good porter at that!","GreenCard","Jul 19, 2003"
4.13,14.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"For the BJCP style, I imagine historical or experimental beer, this is definitely in the 4.8-4.9 / 5 range if not a 5/5 - interesting concept, very well conceived and carried out by a quality brewer.","KroMagnon","Jul 17, 2003"
3.55,-1.9,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Interesting concept seaweed ale, I figured after searching though the shelves and taking nearly an hour in D's Six Pack one day, this beer found it's way into my selections. Pours a deep, very dark ruby brown almost black really had to hold it toward the light to see the ruby tinged edges of this black abyss. The tan creamy head pours thick but then dissipates rather quickly leaving trickled lace in my Gulden Draak 20 ounce tulip shaped glass. Aromatics are much of a coffee porter with deep roasts filled with dark chocolate and cocoa. A bit milky with an air of sea air in the background, I am not trying to force the seaweed but it is evident there not dominantly but traceable. Taste is creamy smooth dark roasts slightly bitter, slightly harsh from the dark roasted barley in this beer. The salty finish tingles the back of the throat, but it's not overbearing at all not like gargling salt water just reminiscient of it. This beer works suprisingly I didn't know what to expect here, but I am rather pleased. As for mouthfeel just a little thin bodied not much fireworks or exciting textures going on here. Drinkability is decent but I wouldn't put it on my must taste list something of a novelty beer, but not bad very drinkable just not a classic in my book. Creativity was flowing here and along with the other beers from Heather Ales brewing ancient beer is their art.","WVbeergeek","Jul 13, 2003"

Fortunately, the seaweed aspect isn't noticable, and this comes across as a decent, if not too thin in flavor, porter.

3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Yeah! There is no seaweed smell, but definitely a sweet chocolate smell combined with some roasted malts. The beer is a dark, dark red with a short-lived head on top. The first sip brings the roasted malts immediately which is then followed by the chocolate flavors. Leaves a roasted malt feel on the back of the mouth. No hops are screaming at you by any means. The brew left a slight metallic feel around the tongue, but smooth and earthy in texture. A nice beer.","BigHead","Jun 03, 2003"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beautiful, persistent, thick head. Deep dark color (no green) Smells very fresh, a litte light for how robust it looks. Does not smell like a beach nor does it taste like seaweed! Tastes like a very good porter. Scoots across the tongue. And surprisingly drinkable. In lesser company, we would have been clubbing each other for the last drops of the stuff. Since I was with fellow BAs, however, we shared very well. A surprise find. It's now one of my favorite dark beers.","dwarbi","Apr 14, 2003"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The color a deep, I mean deep mahogany, the head is quite modest, the consistency frothy, the color a light tan and the lace left behind a thin sheet. The nose! Does remind one of Seaweed, putrefying on a beach, some malt noticed, musty, or musk like for that matter a different aroma for sure. Front is mostly malt, lightly sweet, top light to moderate in feel. Finish has a delicate acidity, the hops quite mild, aftertaste dry, a drinkable beer, but cant really say it rocks my world, nor harms it for that matter.","Gusler","Apr 07, 2003"
4.19,15.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I've been waiting for this beast for a while. When I say beast, I guess that's a little play on words, because everybody knows that a Kelpie is a Scottish mythical beast. With that said, time to move on to the review. This is a wicked awesome beer. It had a very nice dark color, but lacke the head retention that I desire with most of my beers. Other than that, it had a nice look to it, super dark. The smell was like milk chocolate, mixed with coffee, and ocean water. I'm a beach bum, so I like that little smell added to it. The taste was similar to the smell. The first initial tast was that of a mocha. There was the obvious taste of saltiness, but nothing too bad. This one also had a nice coating effect to it. I would recommend this brew with a nice sushi or good tuna steak. Ofcourse, swordfish would be good too!","JISurfer","Apr 05, 2003"

4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This ale poured a dark brown (hints of red around the edges) with some tan foam that settled to a thin coat that left some lace on the glass. The smell was a strong molasses aroma with a touch of caramel. The smell lasted the entire bottle. The taste was molasses, malt, caramel, a hint of chocolate, and a bit of hops. It was not overly sweet. The flavor was not very complex but was tasty. There was a hint of seaweed (a hint of metallic iodine) in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth, clean, and dry, with medium body and low to medium carbonation feel. I found this ale to be very drinkable and enjoyable. Another nice one from this brewery.","UncleJimbo","Mar 26, 2003"
3.43,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Pour is dark brown, almost black. Has a small tan head, almost all diminishing with no lace left behind. Aroma is of roasted and toasted malts, mostly similar to coffee. Flavor is of roasted coffee, light bitter chocolate. Body is medium, and a metallic flavor came through towards the end.","goz","Mar 24, 2003"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very dark brown, can just see through it. There's little to no head. Aroma is strong of chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee. This is a very smooth beer, very malty chocolatey. I don't know where the seaweed comes in. I don't know what seaweed tastes like so I didn't know what to look for. I didn't taste anything odd, just a smooth and enjoyable beer...kinda like a porter but thinner.","AudioGilz","Mar 06, 2003"
3.68,1.7,3.5,3,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours blacke with a soft, foamy head. The head doesn't leave much lace. Aroma is of roasted chocolate malts. Textured, rough mouthfeel and a sweet malty taste. Grainy and slightly nutty. The bottle claims ""the aromS of fresh seabreeze""...I don't quite get what they're after here. But...I swear there's a saltiness that you can pick up on your tongue. I can't help thinking of the beer as a gimmick-brew, but it is interesting and worth a trying.","Suds","Jan 25, 2003"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"pours a dark brown but ends up not being as heavy as it appears. the smell instantly reminded me of a misty day at the beach. chocolate and hints of seaweed readily apparent, as is a definite salty flavour. this is one strange beer, but one i'd happily enjoy again.","SixpointJMH","Jan 04, 2003"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Well retained tan head. Dark brown w/ clear, deep ruby hints when held to light. Rich, smokey deeply roasted black patent and chocolate malt upfront in aroma, w/ subtle notes of dark caramel and coarsely floral Kent Goldings. Be it the powers of suggestion, but there's a hint of ocean spray perceptible with a deep inhale. Flavorwise, Kelpie exhibits a well balanced malt and hop profile, w/ both residual and caramel malt derived sweetness balanced by hop and roasted malt sharpness. Mild diacetyl adds a buttery component that complements the chocolate and dark caramel malt. Smoothly smokey undertone adds depth and richness, and helps lend the impression of greater than actual strength. Finishes w/ an impression of bittersweet chocolate. Kelpie is quite an enjoyable brew. Agreeably heavy on dark malts. Reminscent of a session porter.","marc77","Dec 26, 2002"
3.28,-9.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I was really nervous about trying this one. I don't really know what seaweed tastes like, but it doesn't appear to be a main ingredient in this brew. Dark amber color with a thick beige head. Lightly malty/roasted aroma. Malt very present in the flavor as well, with a little chocolate here and there. As far as novelty beers go this one is pretty solid, but on the grand scale of things it isn't really breaking any new ground.","Dogbrick","Nov 06, 2002"
3.99,10.2,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Dark brown with a quickly disappearing tan head, this brew has a fairly complex aroma of roasted malt, molasses, dark chocolate, a bit of smoke and a slightly sour smell (but not in a bad way) that I can't quite place (the seaweed, I guess).  Less complex on the palate, roast malt flavors dominate and a touch of ""vegetal smokiness"" (don't know how else to describe it) on the finish.  All in all a good brew, but this beer loses points for being a bit too thin.","johnrobe","Nov 02, 2002"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an extremely dark amber/almost brown with a good dark tan head that leaves a decent lace.  Has a slight roasted aroma to it as well as some caramel sweetness.  Brew starts off with more caramel maltiness with some slight diacetyl flavors floating in the background.  The roastedness of the beer then comes forward through the finish to make the sweetness take a turn towards chocolate before heading out on a coffeeish note.  The brew is rather creamy and has a medium to medium full body which is perfectly appropriate with the flavors and makes this brew rather drinkable.","Murph","Aug 13, 2002"
3.63,0.3,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Okay, this beer pours out dark and has nice very dark color to it.  It forms a deep tan head, which is descent, but didn't hold.  I was skittish about smelling, due to the name.  But actually the aroma's not bad.  It smelled of hops.  The taste was a little sour and it's lighter than I usually expect dark beers like this to be.","Wildman","Jun 08, 2002"
3.37,-6.9,3,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours dark with no head but is a lot lighter than it looks.  Smells earthy, could not taste the seaweed (what does seaweed taste like in beer?) but a distinctive flavor and worth trying.  330ml bottle.","jdhilt","May 08, 2002"
3.75,3.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Notes: No fishy ocean flavours or aromas. There is that fresh ocean flavour and smell though, salty and earthy. With that on a beer that is somewhere between a hearty brown ale and a brown porter it is quite and intricate mix. An interesting beer to say the least and well worth a try.","Jason","Feb 15, 2002"
