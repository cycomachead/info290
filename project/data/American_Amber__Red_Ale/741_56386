Pours orange amber with a slight haze under a thick, 2‚Äù rocky, protein heavy head. The lace is thick and clingy. Light caramel to toffee joined by light fruit and malt spice roll over the tongue culminating in a light bitter accent.

It tastes pretty old school - old world hops, more bittering than taste/aroma hops and an earthy and char-esque maltiness. Mouthfeel is good, rich and well carbonated. Sweetness is pretty low.

Toasty roast gets a lot of attention as it passes across the palate like bitter grit. Flowery tea infusion notes are interesting, but somewhat harsh in position. There's a clunky alcohol presence that kind be tasted. Finishes with spicy bitterness and a second burst of carbonation. This beer is quite airy and of the crushing kind. The body travels at a medium speed, but features all kinds of texture. Drinkability is about a C+ to a B-. Fixed Gear is not a red ale I'd scoff at, nor one that I would recommend.","thecheapies","May 13, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep red-orange color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malts and citrus hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, light biscuit, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and citrus/grassy hop flavors; with a good malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and citrus hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 12, 2014"

I like the fact that hops are intertwined with the malts in it's taste. The malts definitely hit the tongue first but with a sudden instance the hops reveal themselves. The mouthfeel is moderate.

Very hazy and deep amber color. The smell is good and I pick up some grapefruit, but for a beer that's supposedly heavily dry hopped there isn't much there. Maybe the keg isn't as fresh as it should be. However the taste makes up for it with a very bold dose of crystal malt (without going overboard) layered with grapefruit and some spicey notes. The mouthfeel is surprisingly silky. There is not a ton of carbonation in this one but I think it goes well with the flavors. Overall I'd definitely have this one again sometime and would recommend it to any hop heads who like some balance in their beer.","neomantra","Nov 27, 2013"

The nose comprises bright grapefruit zest, orange zest, and buttery caramel throughout the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger rind component from the fruits, a less buttery caramel backbone, and a stiff bit of pine resin. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry and slightly sticky finish.

Aromas are caramely, malty, citric, bready, fresh-like hop. Tastes are a heavy dose of bready, caramel malt balanced with fresh citric hop and some pine that lingers on the finish.

Hints of pine resin, pink grapefruit, blood orange, toffee, caramel, sweet bread, and brown sugar. The balance is perfect and the drinkability is off the charts!

Some off flavors, malt doesn't seem to really nail itself down, hops are too earthy and don't really sit with the rest of the beer, and the yeast seems to have added some qualities that it didn't want to leave.","jlindros","Jul 09, 2012"

Taste backs off the pine somewhat in favor of grapefruit; it has a definite IPA taste and mouthfeel to it, even a little bit of a Belgian IPA taste. The label claims it has a bold taste and it lives up to that. The predominant note is pine, very clean but direct. I think the taste matches perfectly with the 6.5% alcohol content, as it is an enjoyable beer but not one you're going to want to drink down too quickly. This is definitely a beer I will return to.

Which kind of leads me to my problem here, and it's a bit of a Catch-22. If this beer weren't in bombers, I probably would have never bought it.

Hallelujah. /sarcasm","emerge077","Aug 24, 2010"
3.94,6.2,3,4,4,4,4,"Beyond the hoppy harshness of the finish, this was pretty darn good and was definitely the tops of the Lakefront beers that I tried on this day. This is surprisingly dark feeling for an Amber Ale but I didn't mind one bit. This is worth a look (at least on draft).","Kegatron","Jul 07, 2010"
4.03,8.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"A very well crafted amber. There are now several good hopped up amber and I would put this one in that same boat. Worth a try indeed.","jera1350","Jul 05, 2010"
2.68,-27.8,4,3.5,2.5,2,2,"O: I gotta say the name/label caught my eye and I probably wouldn't have bought this beer otherwise. As far as the beer goes, I feel as if it is very forgettable and I'm glad I have a Lagunitas Lucky 13 in the fridge and I live in the state of Surly Furious. Won't buy again.","optiontwo","Jun 28, 2010"
3.85,3.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall a pretty good beer with a nice amount of hop aroma and a beautiful red color. The grain profile left me wanting a bit and it could have been more balanced.","trevorjn06","Beers"
4.1,10.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"Initially purchased for novelty (a buddy of mine is a bike guy), I've been pleasantly surprised. On the whole, it's rather impressive. I would really like to try it on tap. A few mods would make this fixie the talk of the Short North.","Ryan011235","0"
3.8,2.4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: nice red ale that is easy to drink. If you are in the mood for a malty beer with some nice hop presence this one hits the spot.","Gavage","Jun 19, 2010"
4.03,8.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Big flavor, immense drinkability, ...very likable. Wish this were in a 6-pack of 12-ouncers, rather than an a bomber. But this is a bolder beer than Lakefront normally brews. So, cheers to that!","feloniousmonk","Jun 12, 2010"
4.38,18.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is the first "Wow!" beer I've had from Lakefront. There's a lot going on for the low ABV, it's unique, and there are absolutely no off nodes.","mynie","May 20, 2010"
3.57,-3.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"D- A good drinker with enough hops to satisfy many palates. A good all around beer that is another good offering from Lakefront.","Wisconsinality","May 19, 2010"
4.42,19.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Great hoppy amber ale; almost an IPA. Poured with a large cream colored foamy frothy head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy medium. Aroma is hop malt a bit of earth. Flavor is like aroma and the hops are not too fruity which the way I prefer it. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is very good with a tapering malty sweet hop end. Session beer.","drpimento","May 17, 2010"
3.83,3.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a nice dark copper color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with a slight hop note, lots of caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, slight hop note, slightly bitter, with a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, but more on the malty side.","Wasatch","May 15, 2010"
3.5,-5.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall it is a decent beer but not worthy of a bombee of this price point.","crossovert","Apr 27, 2010"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D - To tell the truth, I thought this was going to be a gimmick brew by the Lakefront Brewery. Their beers have been hit or miss with me in the past. I picked up this bottle (1 pint 6 fl oz.) for $4.99, which to me isn't a terrible price for a good beer. This bottle is going down so well for me that I kinda wish I would have picked up 2 or 3. I'll be recommending this one to my friends! A must try.","drizzam","Apr 08, 2010"
3.06,-17.5,4,3,3,3,3,"This really wasn't what I was expecting. I guess my scores correspond to my expectations. Maybe I need to go into each beer with no preconceived notions (?). Still, it was decent, just underwhelming is all. Thanks again, Andy!","Onenote81","Apr 06, 2010"
3.83,3.2,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall an above average red. For less then five bucks a bomber I could see picking it up again.","beerwolf77","Mar 19, 2010"
4.1,10.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"(D)- A solid beer that has a good drinkability to it. Its very similar to their best selling Riverwest, only a bit bolder. Solid stuff right here.","sweemzander","Mar 18, 2010"
4.01,8.1,5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Overall I'd say it seems to have a bit more dark malt than it should, without enough sweetness or hop presence for balancing. Very good, just a little shy of being perfect.","vs283204","Beers"
4.13,11.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"D- I could easily drink alot of this beer. Good thing it's in a 22oz bottle. Even at 6.5% it tempts at being sessionable, nice job Lakefront.","Pauly2X","0"
