Muddled citrus, floral hops, and light resin lie underneath. Not a bad beer, but not what I expected.","barczar","Aug 20, 2014"

It is a nice dark amber color. The head floats atop- an aesthetically pleasing addition. When it hits my mouth I think caramel. The toasted carmel hops are prime. It is a first class amber ale that all should experience.","Gabriel_Vaughn","Jun 28, 2014"

Pours moderately hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, bread, toffee, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, peach, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toffee, nuttiness, citrus zest, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice balance and robustness of malt and moderate hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. All around great balance and robustness of malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 15, 2013"

Nose is sweet malts, brown sugar notes, bread and earthy hops. Taste follows the nose closely and takes on a sweet/sugary front end. Fairly complex with the malts and hops that give it a unique taste. Perhaps a bit too sweet, but unique. Fairly well balanced. A touch hoppy on the end. Feel is just okay. A tad thin and carbonated. Perhaps a bit too dry as well. Overall- A pretty decent Amber that has some good/interesting qualities. Like the sugar/malty front, but distracted by the hop/dry finish.

A foamy, antique white/eggshell head of about 3/4 of an inch forms and dissipates almost as quickly, leaving lace around the entire glass. An immediate pleasing, mild hint of citrus that yields to a light roasted caramel malt aroma. Up front, there's a bit of a sour sensation (not necessarily taste) on the tip and underneath the tip of the tongue. Smooth carbonation over the top of the tongue, but a little scrubby on the tongue's edges. Nothing is overpowering about this beer, but if there is a prevalent flavor it is something akin to caramel, sorghum, and horehound. It finishes with a trace of pine on the back of the tongue. I was disappointed by how this beer tasted, because I expected something a little more based on what I had read. Otherwise, its not a bad beer. Quite drinkable.","DocJitsu","Mar 07, 2012"

Sweet finish too, though the peak of that sweetness lies in the middle. Mouthfeel medium bodied with a little bit of carbonation. I tried this because it was one of my friend's favorite beers but I definitely felt differently towards it.","denver10","Jan 23, 2012"

This beer had wonderful aromas of caramel malt and pine (hops). The mouth feel is extremely full, round and silky. A very full flavored amber.

4.22,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - Very drinkable, this is one of the best amber ales out there. There is an excellent balance between the citrusy hops and amber malt such that both are full flavored aspects of the beer but neither one every feels excessive or unbalanced. The hop aroma is particularly nice for a beer of this style and strength. I particularly like the way the orange flavors of the hops work with the toffee in the malt profile to lend the beer a refreshing, but substantial quality. A great beer and well worth seeking out when it is fresh.","nickfl","Apr 26, 2011"

The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, nutmeg, jolly rancher, and wet permed hair (WTF!?!?!?). It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I was not a fan of this one. What the Hell was up with the hair characteristics in the aroma and flavor of this one? I should have known not to drink it by getting hair salon in the aroma, but nooo, I had to do it anyways. Blah.

Some caramel but it is mostly dominated by the black tea smell. Floral hops are faintly lingering in the background but I think they mainly contributing to the tea aroma. A mild fruity taste of cherries but also a great mix of the roasted caramel and fruity/floral hop aromas.

The beer stays light and smooth in mouth, and transitions quickly to a slightly sour aftertaste. The finish is quick and light, and there is the slightest sour-film left in mouth after each drink.

Smells of cone hops and citrus with a faint blueberry-like bitter-sweetness. Tastes of caramel and bready malt and has a tasty hop bitterness throughout but crescendos throughout the sip. Call me crazy, but I pick up a taste of blueberry. The bittersweetness of a not completely ripened blueberry is evident and this brew is reminiscent of Atlantic Brewing Company's Blueberry ale. Tastes absolutely spectacular and has a really smooth feel to it, most likely due to the fluffy head. An excellent amber ale and one which should never be passed up!!","Beerbluesbiology","Jan 07, 2011"

Is it possible that different sizes of CANs are being used, or perhaps the micro-CANners are giving their patrons a little extra ... ? Hmmm. My pour created two fingers' worth of rocky light-tan head that was exploding with CO2 bubbles. The beer's color was a coppery-red, like a new penny, with NE-quality clarity. The nose was immediately malty sweet, but underlain with a piney hoppiness. Mouthfeel was medium and I caught a good bit of malty sweetness on the tongue and in the mouth.

Very approachable nose of pink grapefruit and tangerine juice, chamomile tea, hard caramel candy, as it warms you get more caramelized brown sugar, that said, balanced enough that you detect no favoritism between hops or malts. Medium-bodied, its unassuming serenity momentarily overshadowed by frothy carbonation through the attack. After that, it's fair shares of pink grapefruit, orange citrus, wildflowers, minerals, brown sugar and chocolate taffy. No unnecessary bite in the grain, oat components, and breadiness has a taken out of the oven a couple of minutes too early feel.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a noticable nutty taste and a lingering slightly bitter hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and has average carbonation. Drinkability is good too, I found myself picking up my glass for another drink quicker than I thought. If in the mood, I could have this as a session beer.

There is a nice balance between sweet malts (caramel?) and Celebration Ale style resin/pine hops. The hops flavor is stronger, but nothing jumps out at you. A nicely balanced beer. Mouthfeel is rich enough, a touch of Celebration Ale style resin / oiliness but nothing as pronounced as a good West Coast IPA. This is a well balance (for a hophead), crisp and tasty beer.

The aroma is pretty standard for an amber ale, medium malt background with a jumble of american hop aromas, mostly floral. The taste has a malt background that is a little exaggerated by crystal malt, it reminds me a lot of one of my first homebrews in this way. There isn't so much depth in maltiness, but more of one layer of crystal malt underneath the pale malt base making the caramel seem a little unnatural. The hops lack distinction, but are nice if you like a thick bitterness in your drink. Its hard to make it through a hole pint of this, and I won't be ordering it again. For beer that's supposed to be fairly drinkable, I think there's a slight lack of balance.","dbalsock","Aug 29, 2007"

The smell is very hoppy right after the pour, but becomes quite a bit more malty as it warms, almost bready and grainy. Initially I thought I was in for a very hoppy, caramel beer, but as things settled, I was deceived a bit. This is a beer which is better after it sits a little while. I tasted too much hoppy bite, too much oxidation, and an overall imbalance right out of the bottle. As the beer settled, its caramel, malty, balanced characteristic arises, and the warming bread like notes became more pronounced. This is a medium bodied, slightly carbonated ale that is quite drinkable and not overly strong for its 5.8 ABV. My suggestion is to be patient with this beer and it will insinuate itself in your good graces. The mouthfeel is modest and the aftertaste is slightly bitter, but just enough to keep it honest.

Again, its the hops that start off the big taste, but the malt is definitely what lingers in the back. There is a slight burnt taste.

Flavor hits with caramel malt immediately, followed by a peppery hop, moving towards a light orange citrusyness and very mild toastyness on the finish. What amazes me about this one is that it drys the sides of my tongue out really bad. It leaves just a hint of residual bitter after swallowing the beer as well. Feel is solid at moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty well where I wanted to find the feel. I find this to be a very enjoyable beer. Very flavorful, but nothing too big to dominate.

4.85,26.6,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"Drinkability: Not overpowering in any one specific area, this is a fantastic offering. AVBC done good with this one. I think I'll be picking up a few more of these.","JackTheRipper","Jan 13, 2004"

Hops are bigger--tart grapefruitk, acidic, bitter finish, with lingering biscuity malt flavors. Not bad, but not great.","alexgash","Oct 23, 2003"
4.42,15.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Had this one on a recommendation from a friend and since I am not usually a big fan of Amber/Red Ales I was a bit skeptical. But I was very happy with this beer indeed. It poured a nice medium to light amber color with a thin white head that left lots of lace around the glass. The smell wasa mostly of sweet carmel and also had a bit of hops sneaking though. The flavor was more hoppy than I was expecting, but not overly hoppy by any means. The slight bitterness was quickly thwarted by wonderful malt and carmel flavors. This beer was very very smoothe and had a nice medium thick body to it that would enable me to drink many of these at a single setting. If you are looking for a great drinkable amber ale, this is a excelent choice","Dmann","Oct 18, 2003"
3.76,-1.8,4,3,4.5,4,3,"A pleasing carmelized malt flavor was dominant with this brew. Malt and hops combine very nicely to keep this brew somewhat refreshing but also slightly bitter as well. The finish was straight hop bitterness which was very nice. Pretty impressed with this Amber.","Crosling","Oct 07, 2003"
4.08,6.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"A white creamy head topped off this garnet colored brew. This one looks great. A sweet fruity smell emanates from the beer, along with a pleasant maltiness. There are some cherries and oranges in there. The taste is slightly bitter, slightly fruity and finishes dry. This is a very flavorful and thin bodied beer. On the whole, I think this is a very well crafted and highly drinkable beer.","pezoids","Sep 30, 2003"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A very nice amber ale, tilted toward the ""robust"" end of the spectrum. Complex toasted caramel malt flavors and a potent hop punch to ""kick it up a notch."" Sharp carbonation kept the beer lively throughout. As I was drinking it, I was struck with the impression that this is much like a light version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale.","Brent","Sep 19, 2003"
3.65,-4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice amber (duh) appearance with decent head and lacing. Smell is both floral and malty. Taste is a slight bit on the bitter side, but balanced. Definite floral element. Mouthfeel was medium bodied but not overly smooth. Easy enough to drink. A decent offering.","edchicma","Sep 16, 2003"
4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Nice mellow amber with a cream colored head sitting atop forms nicely with full even rings of lacing. Aroma: Sweet caramel malt reaches out toward my olfactory nerves reeling me in closer to notice nice faint but present piney hops very nice. Taste: Perfect blend between the herbal, earthy, pine like hops with a the sweet rolling blend of caramel malt oh so nice and balanced a brew, doesn't beat out Troeg's Hopback but very good brew here. Mouthfeel is a medium body brew very smooth and decent carbonation perfect sensation of hops running down the palate as well.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Sampled while in Yosemite National Park. A very nice looking semi-dark amber colored beer with a nice foamy head. The head leaves behind nice lacing on the glass and itself persists as a thin layer for some time. The aroma is very pleasant and primarily malty, with a hint of some fruity hops--an overall mild aroma. Tastes of caramelly malt with a bit of hops, again as with the aroma, the taste is very pleasant. I found this beer to be rather smooth and highly drinkable. A good beer and definitely one I would have again.","tar","Sep 03, 2003"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The aroma of this one is definitely hoppy, with a floral expression. A deep red, clear, color and a light tan head. Lightly sweet to the taste, a very malty brew. The maltiness melds very well with the hop flavor. The hop flavor has light citrus notes to it, and it finishes with a nice hop bite. A very balanced brew, that has a fair amount of fruitiness to it (though this is not a strong flavor).","Gueuzedude","Sep 02, 2003"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The flavors are predictable, but well executed as they deliver scorched milk, wild grasses and flowers before succumbing to a gritty, roasted starch edge on the finish. If it were more concentrated, it might not come off so well balanced, but as it stands, none of the flavors dominates.","putnam","Aug 27, 2003"
3.65,-4.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: a little bit better than average. This beer really didn't stand out in my mind (or palate) as much above the norm for the style. Not much distinguished it from the rest. A decent brew overall.","Boilermaker88","Aug 16, 2003"
3.8,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Poured a browned red copper color with not much head, and otherwise looked like a thin and watery beer. Smelled of caramel scented malt, very nice hoppy fruit scents, and a sweet roasted smell like bbq nuts. Taste was amazing spice as well as savory roast flavors, combined with an almost citric twang; too tangy though. A dry finish reinforced the burnt toast tartness. Regardless, a solid moderate malt in the middle. Went down well enough but had some thickness as Id think an amber should have. A caramel and zingy hops interpretation of the style.","nomad","Aug 11, 2003"
3.93,2.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"True to its name in its color - a true amber, with highlights of orange where the light hits. A thick beige frothy head sits atop, and just haaangs in there nicely. Smell is mostly citrus and pine, a bit of light sweet malt. Flavor is fresh and clean, biscuity upfront and finishing with an orange peel zest, with sweet malt creeping in from behind. Thick cables of lace line the glass. Mouthfeel is round and creamy. Moderate carbonation. Orange zest tingle and pine lines the mouth in aftertaste.","far333","Aug 07, 2003"
3.53,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice darker amber color with a good looking off white head. Nose is flowery hop with a touch of citrus maybe. Taste starts with an underlying malt, but has a sweet fruit flavor that takes over, finishes with a crisp hop bitterness, but still some sweetness. Body is medium. I dont know if I can fully appreciate ambers, but this is decent on tap.","fattychubs","Jul 03, 2003"
3.2,-16.4,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer had a large white head with small bubbles that was mostly diminishing. The lacing was good on the sides of my glass. The body was clear and the hue was copper. It had a moderate malty aroma and a light hoppy aroma. There was no carbonation observed with this brew. It had a light bitter flavor from start to finish and it had a medium mouthfeel to it. This was a fairly smooth drink, but I was not very impressed with it.","hotstuff","Jun 30, 2003"
4.01,4.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"For favorites of the amber this one might take some getting used to. For hop heads this ale is a great change when one wants something different.","Rumrunner","Jun 28, 2003"
3.29,-14.1,5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Clear, brilliant ruby forming a poofy beige head atop fine bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. This is a gorgeous beer. Aroma is of earthy hops, amber malts, and a suggestion of alcohol. The taste, unfortunately is exactly the same. Mouthfeel is medium soft, with a wet finish and moderate carbonation. If only it tasted as good as it looks.","Mitchster","Jun 21, 2003"
3.36,-12.3,4,3,3,4,4,"Medium brown copper color, medium head. Aroma is malty and a touch sweet. A medium bodied amber ale. Fairly malty, with a nice hop bite. Milder, smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full.

4.33,13.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"An appropriate bright amber body is topped by a big, rocky, frothy off-white head. Nose is a mix of herbal hops and some cereal grains. Taste is malty caramel and herbal, earthy hops, all in dead-on balance. Nice toasty quality throughout, and a fast jab of hop smack at the very end. Creamy smooth across the tongue. Too many amber ales are strictly middle-of-the-road. This one heads down the fast lane. Enjoy.","RonfromJersey","Jun 07, 2003"

3.34,-12.8,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"This beer pours a nearly perfect copper color with a voluminous, tan rocky head. The head slowly fades until a loose layer of foam lays atop the beer, which displays excellent clarity. A loose, sticky lacing clings to the glass as you quaff. The aroma is a bit of an earthy hop presence atop a light caramel note. Actually sort of unisnpiring after the perfect pour. The taste is pretty much a balanced malt and hop ale, with a bit more roastiness and just a hint of anise in the aftertaste. Good bittering on the finish, but just a little better than average overall. The mouthfeel is good, and displays the barely carbonated traditional ale feel. The drinkability is average. It goes down easy, but I don't find myslef reaching for this one as frequently as many other beers. Yet another average offering from a company who's labels inspire me more than their beer does.","aaronh","May 01, 2003"

4.19,9.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Reddish amber color, slightly hazy, with a nicely creamy and clingy off white head. Inviting aromas of floral hops and freshly baked rolls. The aroma reminds me of boiling wort and steeping grains - good fresh beer smell. Great caramel malt flavor; honey and biscuit notes with some grain nuttiness. Mouth feel is light to med. with firm hop bittering and a slightly sour/ bitter finish. A highly drinkable Amber with a solid dose of hops.","Shiredave","Feb 23, 2003"
3.41,-11,3.5,2.5,4,3,3.5,"Coppery-red color with a foamy, off-white head with medium retension. Almost no aroma other than a mild hoppy spiciness.

Mostly malt in the nose, crisp and fresh with the start quite sweet. Top is lean in its feel with the finish crisply acidic in its bite and the hops apropos to the style, aftertaste dry and long lasting. Quaffable and a beer you could enjoy daily as it is tasty and well brewed.","Gusler","Jan 01, 2003"
4.18,9.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a delicious amber/honey color with an off-white head and medium head retention. Scents of caramel malt, pine, and a ""roasty", earthy aroma. Crisp hops and oily/silky mouthfeel give way to a charming malt sweetness. Sweet notes of toffee and fruit balanced by piney, yeasty hops. The classic west coast hops element is there but in a very subtle, understated way. The caramel malt and earthy notes are beautifully balanced by the crisp, clean hops without either won ever seeming to dominate. A very smooth and drinkable beer, but at the same time a beer with alot of character and charm.","Riggo","Dec 15, 2002"
3.48,-9.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Fairly good Amber, it actually seemed borderline Vienna to me. Sweet caramel malt aroma with a medium sand colored head that disappeared rather quickly. High ratio of malt to hops in the flavor which gave it some good body. This is definitely a solid, well-balanced Amber and I wouldn't mind getting it again.","Dogbrick","Nov 13, 2002"
3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured well - nice head. Supreme deep orangey-copper-amber color, looks great and healthy. Both malt and hops in the nose, but neither overwhelming. Lovely balance of caramel malt, hops and a lovely fruitiness that adds drinkability to this beer - like an engine adds movement to a car. Some light sweetness at first that makes way for a light malt, bitter dry finish. Solid mouthfeel, that leaves a light mouth puckering begging to be quelled by the next mouthful of beer, making this a very drinkable beer. This is now the 4th, or 5th, beer that I have had from Anderson Valley, and they are quickly developing great respect from me, for the excellent high quality range of beers they produce. They seem to do no wrong. No wonder these beers win awards, they must be truly brewed by a Drinker.","TheLongBeachBum","Oct 03, 2002"
4.37,14.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Deep amber coloring; no head due to the way the bartender poured it. Aromas of caramel malts and citrusy hops.

Deep caramel malt aroma.  Also some nuttiness, roastiness and grain.  Nice nose on this one.  The taste consists of a primary element (sweet caramel malt) and some secondary elements (toasted malt, spicy grain and some hops to balance the nice malt load).  The mouthfell is smooth and creamy and lightly carbonated, making this one easily drinkable beer.  Very nice amber.","Bighuge","Aug 19, 2002"

Just the right balance of fuit of bitterness on this ale.  It's not overpowering at all, but has enough assertivness to make it stand out.  I think a great summer beer to drink by the grill.","AaronRed","Jun 13, 2002"
4.07,6.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Handsome reddish amber color with full, delicate head. Wonderful malty caramel aroma with light hop spiciness and flowers. Quite tasty, although slightly lacking in complexity in the mouth, draws out to an excellent crisp finish. Well balanced for the most part; strong attack based on the terrific aroma, the middle is a bit bland, but the finish evens it out. Maybe more hops right off the bat? Mouthfeel a little watery for such a malty, sticky tasting brew. Warming and filling, I like this very much.","Thrasher","May 19, 2002"

Nice and spicy malt flavor, impressive medium body. The hop tang is also very good and balances the taste in an admirable way. Maltier than I expected. Very well done, the Anderson Valley brewmasters scored on this one with free throws to follow. Lots of flavor and mouthfeel for the style.","ADR","Apr 30, 2002"
