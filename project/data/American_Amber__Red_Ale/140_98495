Nice caramel underpinning. Hints of raisin. Bitterness is well balanced and hop flavor is in the lead. Nice pine, apricot and subtle melon notes. Bitterness lingers a bit on the tongue. The sweet caramel malt isn't overshadowed by the hops. Fair bit of alcohol warming that finishes dry with a mild bit of astringency. Overall a nice IPA.","slusk","Jan 03, 2015"

Smells very earthy like cool wet soil on a hot summer day, lighter on the hoppiness. Very interesting and nice. The taste has a delicate bitterness and hoppiness up front but fades quickly to fruit punch on the finish (like Hawaiian punch - really cool). Has a very sophisticated feel for what I consider a sessionable beer. The complexity of a great IPA with a drinkability that is all its own. Overall fantastic and well worth the money. This and Celebration Ale have really impressed me and have been two of my favorites here at the end of 2014. Kudos Sierra Nevada!","CIBoy10","Dec 23, 2014"

Hints of pine, brown sugar, tangerine, subtle grapefruit, and toast.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and incredibly well balanced with a subtle creaminess and smooth finish.

4.25,12.1,,,,,,"Poured a clear reddish brown body with two fingers of fluffy off-white head. An amazing looking ale, a combination of a red ale, an IPA and a brown. Scents of lemon peel, grassy hops, tropical fruit, especially mango with some pineapple, a light pine resin and a nice soft presence of toasted and bready malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully hoppy, yet deeply malty ale that feels like both an IPA, a brown and a heavily hopped red ale. It is unique and quite pleasant. Flavor begins moderately bitter with notes of pine resin, tropical fruit and dried orange peel, light lemon zest, a backbone of toasted malt and light caramel. This moves into a middle that is bitter and continues the previous flavors but adds a grassy hop flavor and more tropical fruit, especially mango. Flavor is dry with strong notes of pine resin, light tropical fruit, moderate toasted and nutty malt, light lemon zest. Aftertaste is toasted and nutty malt, light pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully rich and hoppy beer that has a pleasant toasted maltiness and the pleasant flavor of West Coast hops. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is resinous with light carbonation and a slick, oily finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, hop forward beer. Well done and pleasant. Overall this is a well done and rather unique beer. It combines the toasted malt of many Autumn beers with a nice hoppiness that adds balance. A very nice beer and a solid addition to the SN seasonals.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2014"

Diffuse spots and strands of lacing are present during the tasting.   Nose expresses rich malts and intense floral/citrus notes.  Taste is interesting - I almost get a coffee/carmel malt profile integrated with earthy/herbal/citrusy hop notes.  Finishes with an earthy, slightly medicinal bitterness that lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp carbonation and a light acidity.  Overall, there's just a little too much happening here to make it overly drinkable.  It's well-crafted, but not something I need to revisit.","Jwale73","Sep 14, 2014"

The taste is hoppy and floral, really solid.  At 6.2% and a very high drink-ability....be careful with this one!","oldirtycaffrey","0"

Grassy Centennial hops broke through on the nose, a bit of citrus, the ubiquitous SN fresh smell, and a bit of a bitter note. Refreshingly bitter to taste (maybe a bit too bitter), covered up the nice malt character some. Typical light/medium SN body to the IPA style. However crisp, with a nice finish. As much as I like SN, this seemed a typical SN beer. Quite good, but would probably choose something more adventurous next time.","Mikus","Sep 08, 2014"

Hop first taste, more grassy than anything else.  Smoother, malty citrus taste follows with a nice bitter aftertaste.  Good beer.  Leaves that nice bitter aftertaste I like with IPAs.  There is a little something off in the transition of malts and hops in this beer.","jngrizzaffi","Sep 08, 2014"

It almost has a lager-like feel to it, actually, as well as having a leafy, mildly dry element and almost a somewhat mineral feel to it that adds a bit of English, so to speak, in my mind.","Brenden","Sep 06, 2014"

Aromas of roasted caramel, toasted grains, tart grapefruit notes, and subtle hops resin notes.  Flavors are more richly sweet forward, with roasted caramel and hints of toffee, followed quickly by a citrus blast of grapefruit and tangerine, with a solid dose of hops bitterness, some piney highlights, resinous and dank, and a cracker backbone.  Pretty decently balanced palate, on a light, crisp body.  The aftertaste is bittersweet, with a tart highlight throughout.  Smooth, slightly dry, fairly clean finish.  Subtle lingering tart and bitter feel on the taste buds.  Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","Beers"

Aroma is tropical, quickly dissipating one finger wide soft white head, deep red color with moderate carbonation.  The initial taste is citra, it's signature fruit taste followed by the resiny, pine and citrus of simcoe all complimented by the grapefruit of centennial.

Not quite as roasty and malty as a black IPA, nor not as citrusy and bitter as a IIPA or even an IPA for that matter. Sierra Nevada continues to truly brew staples of each different beer style. A red IPA is mean't to blend together and blur the lines of IPA's and other styles. This particular brew does just that. There are a handful of breweries that just can't miss, Sierra Nevada is among them. To infinity, and beyond.","AC-Mivsek","Aug 12, 2014"

The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light pine sap, caramel, mild maple syrup, and a touch of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, the caramel and maple boldly defending against the massive onslaught of pine and citrus, though entirely in vain. Yeah, this means there's a bit of clash to the flavors, but it's not all that strident. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a nice ""red IPA"".

4.27,12.7,4.25,4,4.25,5,4.25,"I poured this from a bottle into an Ale glass. The color is great with a nice head which makes for great lacing. It appears as a deep red/brown kind of reminds me of changing leaves which makes it really nice for the time of year. There is a nice scent o this beer, you get some floral hops and even, am I nuts, maybe some spiced apple? It smells awesome! The mouth-feel is just perfect and very unique. There is a lot of carbonation but it works well here and I think they were going for something that had a bubbly feel as it keeps this IPA initially light on the palate. The taste...how did they do this? Starts off with light hops, different for an IPA, then YES I got some spiced apple and even some cinnamon finishing with more hops but not of citrus, more like light pine which works so well with the other flavors. This is one of the strangest IPAs I have ever had and its great! Would even be great for later in the season and I believe anyone who enjoys quality crafted IPAs will be very very surprised at this one. Entirely unique!","Khad","Nov 20, 2013"

3.88,2.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/16/2013. Pours lightly cloudy light ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, mango, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, and pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely crisp and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 10, 2013"

This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean and the flavor did a decent job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the malt base, I thought it was very well done. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop profile, it wasn't bad, but it's very typical for Sierra Nevada and it can be found in almost all of their other hoppy bees. I might order this at a bar, but I don't think I would buy any to keep at home and I would recommend it to people that like pretty hoppy Red Ales. Overall I liked this beer, but I wish Sierra Nevada would try something different when it comes to hopping their beers. This was a solid effort, but I prefer Tumbler over this beer and I'm sad to see it go, I just don't think Flipsise is on the same level, especially for the season.","StoutHunter","Oct 06, 2013"

Taste is hop forward with floral notes along with some citrus and pine. The malt backbone comes through next and features some toasted notes. Moderate bitterness towards the end. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium body. Overall, a nice IPA from Sierra Nevada, in the vein of their other IPA hop profiles.

Oh, the flavor! This beer grew out of the Earth, just like I did, and the taste is there to prove it. There is grain in this bottle, and it feeds and sustains you. There are hops in this bottle. They awaken your face and mind. There is yeast in this bottle. And now it's inside you, alive and teeming. You are no longer a purely human/Neanderthal mixture. Now you are part yeast. Its DNA is now in your DNA, in the nucleus of every cell in your body.","TWebb","Oct 01, 2013"

The aroma smells fresh and dank, with some pine notes and a tangy underpinning of bready malt and light tropical fruit character. The taste has a bite to it of zesty citrus and resins, which spreads lightly herbal and tropical notes out across the palate. The malts definitely have a presence here but aren’t overly intrusive on the hops, with a mix of caramel sweetness and doughy notes. Bitter and piney on the finish with some lingering herbal and malt flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall with an easy feeling creaminess to the carbonation. There is a touch of warmth here but those herbal and oily textures from the hops really keep this smooth.

Just bc what we think is summer and vacations are gone doesn't mean the hot weather is. Not just yet. In comes FlipSide and just at the right time. I will admit that I hope Tumbler remains their Fall Seasonal, but hey! If you want to keep your 4 seasonals and add an in between brew while we wait for the next then it puts a smile on my face.

Not quite as hoppy as Torpedo, but the gorgeous copper color and huge light beige head makes up for it by adding psychological flavor. Drinkable and sessionable. Hard to imagine a better replacement for Tumbler, if that's what this is intended to be. A happy choice for my 150th BA review and 600th Beer Karma point.","scotorum","Sep 15, 2013"

Very interesting mix in my opinion tastes like a mesh up between an amber from an established Michigan brewery and a SN pale ale... and it works. To me was a little too heavy in the mouth for either an amber or an IPA. A great addition to the fall lineup.","Jekyll","Sep 15, 2013"

Very clear. Smell is a little more subtle than I was expecting, but it's a nice melony, slightly skunky smell that you can get with citra in the mix. Not what you typically find in an amber, but it's interesting and it works. Taste was very good. Again, I'm a little partial to that classic cascadey taste in an amber, but this is a nice change up. Mouthfeel is excellent! It's got a nice smooth, slipperiness to it, that I really like. All told, a unique and tasty American amber ale that you should try if you dig that style of beer.

There’s a fantastic aroma to it—I can tell it’s fresh because the hops are just vibrant. I pick up a bit of pine and grapefruit that’s overshadowed by a sticky, dank, resiny note and held together with a caramelly-malty backbone. The aroma profile carries over to the flavor, with a smooth and surprisingly mellow bitterness lending some complexity to the lingering sticky-green-malty taste. It's good stuff. a little malty, kinda catty, slightly dank... it’s solid and scratches that itch, and for the price it’s a steal. One I will definitely seek out again.","elNopalero","Sep 09, 2013"

The aroma was not as hoppy as expected, which did have the benefit of some nutty, caramel malts show through. The taste was also a good deal sweeter than a typical IPA at first, with syrupy first impression. Upon staying longer in the mouth, the beer suddenly seemed to start to get citric, and the finish was quite bitter, with a drawn-out aftertaste. Quite a bit more complex than the first impression, but let down a little by a watery feel.","rajendra82","Sep 08, 2013"

There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel.

This is classic SN, not straying far from the hop profile that has brought them all their amazing success. As a result, it's not so unique from their core line-up, unfortunately. I've heard rumor this is replacing the Tumbler Brown as their fall seasonal; if so, disappointing. Tumbler was at least a change of pace from their mainstays. I see this as no more than their Torpedo with a bit of roasted malt as a change-up. It's good, yes, but all too similar. Following this up with their Celebration just means more of the same.","TheSixthRing","Sep 01, 2013"
