4.02,12.9,4.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,4,"Using a nonic pint (that's what's suggested by the label), a beautiful shade of red with a tannish head that was with me all the way to the bottom. Nose is fairly dank and spicy. Hop character is very vegetably, like a broth made with carrots, celery, and the like. I'd suggest this was related to the rye, but I've noticed this with Bridgeport's Conviction Pale Ale, Signature IPA, and Hop Czar Imperial IPA as well. In the red and the pale, it's tolerable, good even, but in the others it's overwhelming. Decently carbonated with a relatively high viscosity and a bitter, pepper-like aftertaste, this ale is surprisingly drinkable...in sips, not gulps...with a snack, which works well with the moderately high ABV.","Libeertarian","Mar 10, 2015"

4.2,18,4.75,4,4.25,4.5,4,"O - I'm not quite sure what BridgePort means by "triple hopped" with their double red ale, Kingpin but I assure you, there's a hell of a lot more hops in here than Miller's "triple hopped" Lite. Either way, while exponentially hoppier than that bladder-filling swill, Kingpin seems more balanced than anything which seems to work out great. Sweet, bready malt provides a nice body and smooth feel with predominantly earthy hops filling in the gaps and finishing out with dry bitterness for an easy drinking (and higher alcohol) red that won't destroy your taste buds in the process.","BeerFMAndy","Jan 06, 2014"

The nose comprises toffee, caramel, orange zest, ruby red grapefruit peel, and a hint of greens. The taste holds notes of dried maple syrup, light grapefruit peel, light caramel, and an overarching surge of some blandly bitter citrus rind. Let's be blunt, indeed. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty sad beer, one that has no idea of balance, let alone quality flavor expression.","TMoney2591","Mar 18, 2012"

The sharp, prickly carbonation is great, then it washes down leaving a malty glow. A bit of a grainy mouthfeel. The 7.5 ABV is not very noticeable.

Given that this is triple-hopped, I expected a stronger hop aroma. In flavor, the caramel malts come through and a grassy hop bitterness is more pronounced. Mid-taste, the alcohol is noticeable (but along the lines of what I'd expect for a 7.5% ABV brew). Body is light to medium, nicely carbonated, and has a crisp mouth feel.

This beer would be great for fall tailgating as well before it gets cold enough to warrant a bigger beer.

Strangely an aspirin like bitterness hits you hard in the aftertaste and really sticks around. The middle of the taste is a bit of a fruity, cereal like quality. Actually if not for the crazy bitterness in the end it would be quite nice. FYI, I love hop bitterness but this goes into medicinal territory.

3.7,3.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours out a translucent copper hue with dense 1-finger head. Leaves significant lacing. Emits a beautiful hop scent, citrusy, complimented perfectly by the sweetness of the red ale malts and a light caramel. The taste is bitter, of course, hoppy and malty, somewhat of a copper bite to it, and a touch of booziness. Tastes great, actually, but unfortunately the fullness of flavor falls off at the end. It has full body, quite viscous, but not too sticky. It's a strong brew and perhaps not the easiest to drink for that reason, but I could drink a pitcher of this with beer if it were available.","Chyren","Mar 02, 2011"
3.33,-6.5,4.5,4,3,3,3,"D - Very balanced flavor between the hops and the malts, with neither completely overpowering the other. With that said, this is a slightly boring beer. Nothing special going on. I have to admit this isnt my style of beer, but I thought there would be a little more falvor wise going on. Again, this isnt the style I usually drink so I'm not an expert at what the flavor profile should consist of.","beeragent","Feb 28, 2011"

3.26,-8.4,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Assertiveness kicked up a notch in the flavor, but the alcohol clashes against an onslaught of German style hops and a syrupy/spicy rye note. This beer is having trouble finding its identity, as it has the sweetness of an amber, the hop profile of a German pilsener, and the body of a double IPA. I can't say it really works for me. Mouthfeel is dry, but syrupy and sticky on the palate. Big bubbles of carbonation feel gritty going down. Not my bag. It's a decent attempt, but has too many stylistic and flavor errors for my liking.","wagenvolks","Feb 26, 2011"
3.23,-9.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark copper with a finger of off white head. Malty aroma with a hint of fruit and hops. Medium bodied. Malt predominates, but there is a decent hop bite. Bit of a tang that was off putting to me. Fairly dry on the finish from the hops. This didn't do much for me.","homebrewhawk","Feb 26, 2011"
4.07,14.3,3.5,4,4,4,4.5," Body is smooth and creamy, not nearly as still as the appearance would indicate. As full as a big red ale should be, without the stickiness of some imperial ales. On the whole, a very drinkable new offering from Bridgeport. While this is obviously an attempt to compete with Ninkasi's Believer, it fills a slightly different spot in the lineup by not being a complete hop bomb. Still, it's a very enjoyable brew.","ElGordo","Feb 24, 2011"

4.5,26.4,4,4,5,4,4.5,"Yet again another Bridgeport beer that I know I am going to drink a lot of. This triple hopped double red ale is exteremely well balanced with the hops and malts. Definitely shows some good hops but it isn't so intense that it takes away from the sweetness of the malts. In my opinion the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness from the malts coincide very well, with neither ingredient dominating the other.","WhatsNewinBooze","Feb 19, 2011"
3.46,-2.8,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Flavor is generally the same, with earthy and faintly sweet malt notes balanced by herbal hops. Nothing stands out here exept the overly thin body. Barely bitter finish recalls the six packs promise of triple hopping, etc. Not worth it.","BretSikkink","Feb 13, 2011"
3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Upon reevaluation a few months later, I found the dense, rich head significantly more pleasing and the malt profile admirable. The rye really added a different dimension and the beer came across as better overall. Still, though, save the Liberty for the American interpretations of German lagers.","bump8628","Feb 13, 2011"
2.76,-22.5,3,2,3,3,3,"This beer pours a red amber color with a slight amount of off white head that doesn't cling to the glass much. The aroma is missing... There's not much there, but if I imagine I can maybe come up with some fruity hops. The taste starts and ends malty, but very plain with a little hoppy bitterness thrown in there. For a beer that is so-called 'triple hopped' it is certainly lacking in the hops big time. The mouthfeel is about average. Overall I wouldn't really bother with this one unless you need to.","csiewert","Feb 07, 2011"

3.32,-6.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"The flavor is that of red ale with a slightly more pronounced hop character. (I realize that may seem a little "no Duh" but that's exactly what this beer is) The malt is traditional toasty caramel flavor with a bigger earthy, herbal hop presence than normally expected. Overall this is good but the hop flavor needs to be blended into the flavor better and the overall hop character to me is a bit one sided.","Thur123","Feb 03, 2011"

3.5,-1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"6 pack bought from Haggens store in Tualatin. $6.79 Kinda like the straight good looks of the beer., dark clear copper tones with a big thick creme coloured head. Aroma again very simplistic, earthy hop,nutty ,toasty malts Again a simple plain slightly resinous hop and a nice nutty maltiness, struggling to find any rye though that may be at the very end and lends a rather spicy finish. Ok on my palate, smooth long ending peppery spice. Overall a rather simple beer..far more simple than the dessription led me to believe. Slightly let down but it really is not a bad beer.","Reidrover","Jan 16, 2011"
