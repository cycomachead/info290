"Considering that this beer is one of the staples of The Bruery's lineup, it might play second fiddle to many of their seekers. Don't miss out; this one is a true gem."
""
"Hoppy nose, malty finish. Great local brew. Seems to have changed a lot over the past few years."
"Hoppy and bitter up front. Caramel malt on the finish."

"A slightly malt and caramel forward brew with hints of almost raspberries and grapefruit. A decent bitterness cuts the sweetness as the oak and bitterness combine to finish off the brew."

"Overall - Complex yet balanced. Not over the top. I think they did a very good job with this one. Very approachable and also complex. The Bruery can do no evil."
""
""
"Overall quite a nice red amber ale, and uniquely made and tasting."
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew that is explosively carbonated. Not that good, would not buy again. I cant believe this bottle didnt explode prior to me opening it. Im sure my experience is atypical of what the Bruery intended and what others have reviewed but I would never waste my money knowing this ""might"" be whats inside loakal red again."

"O - 4.5 - It's an interesting concept, and a great red ale, but I was expecting to get more from the oak barrels. I guess with only 25% being aged in barrels you'd expect it to be pretty mellow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O This is a fantastic beer; very impressive. I think this is in my top two or three from The Bruery."
""
"O-A solid beer, worth trying at least once."
""
""
""
"Overall - Really enjoyed this one. Lots of sweet fruity notes and vibrant hops. The wood is a bit subdued, but still gives it a certain something. Pricey, but worth trying."
""
"Pours a dark red / amber with a thick heavy white head glued to glass. Smell was a bit underwhelming for me, but some crisp hops, smooth caramel and bread hold it together. Taste is very good: chewy caramel sweetness up front, bread and malt in the middle with the oak aging coming through too, and some and some pepper, spice and hoppy bitterness bring up the rear. Feel is thick but a bit soapy. Overall, decent red, not my go to style, but Bruery made it a pleasant experience for me."

"Picked this up in a great trade with Mike! Beautiful ruby-mahogany pour with a huge three finger beige head with crazy retention and lacing. The nose is big and bold with loads of citrusy, resiny, piney hops along with hints of oak, brown bread, caramel, toast, tangerine, brown sugar, and vanilla. The taste just as big and just as bold as the nose. Mouth-puckering resiny hops dominate, but some great sweet bready maltiness balances it out nicely. Sweet brown bread, blood orange, molasses, pine, pink grapefruit, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and a really awesome herbal character highlight this complex and flavorful red. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and really oily with absolutely perfect balance and an awesome bitter-sweet velvety smooth finish. Overall, hands down the best Red Ale I've ever tasted!"

"Large three finger frothy head with excellent lacing on a hazy copper and amber body. Great retention as well. Aroma of tart grapefruit, caramel, earthy hops, bready malts and molasses. Flavor follows with much of the same with a nice bready and caramel malt base with both tart citrus and earthy hops. It isn't especially great but for the style its flavorful and complete. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Solid brew overall for both the style and flavor."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, toast, toffee, floral, grass, bread, clove, oak, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and very balanced hop, malt, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, toast, toffee, light pine, oak, clove, vanilla, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance of hop and malt flavors with moderate oak barrel presence; with a nearly perfect hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy, slightly sticky, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an awesome red ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - Solid red ale that is dominated in the flavor from the malt side. Would have liked to see the flavor have as much of the hops as the nose did"
""
""

"Overall, its a good red, not fantastic but super solid good."

"O: A super hopped up red ale. Definitely more ipa than red. This beer is awesome. I can’t imagine how the imperial version is going to taste."
""
""
""
"Overall - Nice treat from SoCal. Glad I got to try it. I would drink it again."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied. Round mouthfeel from oak addition."
""
"O: looks good, smells good, tastes great and drinks easy. A very good beer with good flavors and solid balance"
""
"The Bruery does another unique take on a common style. The 25% oak aged beer that is blended into the fresh beer really accentuates the natural pine characteristics of the centennial and summit hops that were used in this ale. This is quite the juicy and complex red ale. The Bruery did it again, highly recommended."
""
""
""
"A surprisingly decent offering from the Bruery. Not too much is trying to be done here and as a result, the nose is aromatic, the flavor has good balance, and the feel is spot on. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- This strongly reminds me of Bells' This goes to 11 Ale, but this one might have a better balance and a touch less of a massive hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"Though I'm not always an amber ale drinker, I was in the mood, and this went above and beyond my expectations. I always expect a lot from The Bruery, and they certainly deliver with this one. Glad they finally shipped it outside of OC!"
""
""
"A mighy fine red ale. Nice hop character with an even nicer complex enjoyable oaky malt body. I enjoyed this much more than the Imperial Loakal Red. This has a great balance to it with no noticeable alcohol. I'll definately buy this again when I see it."

"Overall quite nice, the oak is really interesting, nice malts too, hops are a little on the lighter side but not too bad. It also seems like it wants to be boozy but doesn't quite get there, tricky. The imperial version should be interesting."

"O: As straightforward as a Bruery beer can get, this red ale boasts wonderful hop bitterness built upon a standard red ale malt base. Although somwhat lacking in malt complexity this brew is a decent hoppy take on the American Red Ale."

"I'm glad I got the chance to try this ""loakal""."

"D - Very drinkable. The barrel aging really adds a great dimension of complexity to the beer that starys very balanced with the rest of the flavors."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is malty and fruity with some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt and herbal hops with a subtle caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"This is a great offering from the Bruery. It's a fine example of when a brewery takes a nice red ale and hits it with some oak. A well-rounded beer...my only significant complaint is the high price (as with most Bruery beers.) Will see how it holds up with another 6 months of aging."
""
""
"Overall - I think that being in-between a dry and a sweet sort of Red Ale is kind of holding it back. The finish is where I have an issue; it kind of trails off into a blandness. But the initial hit is fantastic and flavorful. I still like it, but I would only really drink it with a complimenting food."

"More hops than nose suggests. Subtle creamy texture with some faint citrus that gives off some sweetness to balance the  malt presence.  Hints of caramel, toffee and bready yeast but hops are still prominent.  . Decent amount of dry bitterness but still well balanced with above average drinkability."

"The Loakal Red is one of my favorite brews from The Bruery. The great color is an inviting sight, and the aroma that goes along with it really prepare you for the first flavorful sip. The head was impressive, and stuck around for a while. The first smell was typical of a red amber, and the second yielded a wood grain scent. The first sip was very flavorful, and the wood grain scent stuck around for the taste as well, giving a smoked grain aftertaste. Definitely a smooth taste that lasted for the rest of the glass."

"O - Overall I really enjoy Red Ales with this much flavor. I feel like CA does a good job producing ales of this type. See Hop Head Red by Green Flash. Very flavorful and well crafted. Delicious. (4.0)"

"The aroma was sweet, nice touches of caramel malts and an almost candy like sweetness that was wrapped up nicely in a bit of a grassy, earthy, hop like nose. The flavor was more of the same, but I have to admit I am impressed here with this. Lots of alcohol in the flavor here, a bit of a hotness that I have not seen in the rest of the their beers. Lots of grainy malts, touches of light caramel and a mostly understated hop flavo"
""

"O - Great beer, wish they would throw this into 4 or 6 packs so I could drink it regularly. I guess it's a bit of a process to make it unfortunately, as I'd love to drink a lot of this."

"Not what i expected, but overall, it is an ok beer for a tasting or a session. Drinkability was very good, taste was sweet and one dimensional."
"Overall: This is a really good hoppy red ale. The hop profile along with the malt backbone worked together well. I would have this one again."
"mouthfeel - medium and medium on carbonation and body. a bit of sticking in the mouth."
"The sweet amber malt in this beer is great in flavor, but it's overtaken by the oak bitterness that lasts forever, wiping the sweet taste from your palate's memory. This also happened with The Bruery's Batch 300 Tripel. They really need to rein in the oak flavors. The overcarbonation wasn't really an issue, but worth noting. This is so close to being a great brew that I can taste it (get it?). That said, this is probably the most drinkable ales that The Bruery has produced."
"This is what I expect from an amber ale. Delicious."
"Nice beer. The oak is a bit stronger than I had anticipated given the stated ratio on the bottle, but that's fine by me. Perfect for a New England fall afternoon."
"Overall: A tasty red ale. A bit heavy on the vanilla/oak charachter, but very complex."
"Dr: Drinkable for the relatively high ABV. Low quality."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a medium, cream colored head that slowly disappears. Scent is very hoppy with some nice caramel malt aromas. Sweet fruits and light vanilla with just a bit of leather. Taste is reminds me of fresh baked bread, quickly followed by hops and a lot of vanilla. Nice, subtle oak presence as well. Caramel and chocolate malt linger with each sip as the hops and vanilla blend nicely. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy with a nice, bitter-sweet finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I highly recommend drinking this beer with a fresh palate to really enjoy it and experience its complexities. I had it on tap at the brewery (after I had a couple bigger beers) and don't remember it being this good at all."
"Loakal Red was a very nice Amber, something I wouldn't have necessarily expected from The Bruery. It seems like this would have had to been made more than once as this is still extremely hoppy and bitter. I really enjoyed this one and think this would be a nice, crisp and easy addition to a year round line-up."
"Overall, this is a winner- and I though hottenroth was the best Bruery beer!"
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. This is one of my new/current favorite styles (Imperial Red) and it is taken a step further and merged with my favorite style (wood-aged beers), so for me this is pure heaven. It's a beer that I could and would drink 365 days a year because of it's big, yet dry and crisp, very drinkable. Highly recommend, if you can find it (because it's only distributed locally), trade for it or look for it on a few websites that ship to several states outside of California."
"O- Really good beer. I'm a big fan of red beers (Nugget Nectar is one of my favorites when I'm at school in NY) and this one is definitely one of the better amber ales I've had. I do prefer my red ales to be more hoppy. While this is certainly more hop heavy than others of the style, everything takes a back seat to NN. Will buy again if given the opportunity."
"Hoppy reds are right up my alley and this one is no different. I could use just a touch more hoppiness, but overall a great beer. Wish they'd distribute it nationally."
"Beer pours a dark amber color with a strong slightly off white head that lasts. The nose has a certin sweet and sourness to it, cherry, oak, hops. Taste is of tart cherries, hops, vanilla, oak, all vary layered. Great mouthfeel on this beer, it is well carbed with a medium body and a lingering taste on the finish. Petty awesome take on the style."
"O-pretty decent red ale. it has a subtle complexity to it, much like caviar. unfortunately, thats not how i like my beers. i'd still enjoy an entire 750mL to myself though!"
"Simply a very good ale with lots of flavour and an interesting interplay of malt, hops and oak."
"O: Creamy delicious oaky delight. The wood plays masterfully with the hops. Hop freshness blended with the oak giving this a drier hop experience. It really drinks like a gentleman's IPA, meant for consumption on polo grounds and private golf clubs. Though this isn't a gimmick, the complexity of the flavor is the real deal. Would love to taste this fresh alongside a fresh nugget nectar. Battle for red deliciousness."
"O- Overall not bad, probably one of the most drinkable beers from the Bruery but for the price it is not worth the price tag."
"An ultimately disappointing red, if only because the aroma was so incredibly special! I'll certainly try this one again, hoping for something different. That smell alone is almost worth the purchase price!"
"It's nice to see Bruery pushing it's bondaries, even if that means making something that EVERY other SoCal brewery does."
"Sweetness is light for a Red Ale, carbonation is firm and pleasant. Oak notes are solid. Offers some dark raisin and brown sugar on the close. A good and characterful beer that resides, somewhat, within a not very preferred style. Well done."
"Overall: I think it goes without saying that I really really liked this red to the point where it might be the best red I have had to date. Great flavor and incredible balance."
"The nose is wonderful, but the taste is less dominating than anticipated."
"Really glad I got to try this one. The beer pours an amber color with a huge white head. The aroma is classic red ale with a lot of caramel malt and a little bit of grass, but I also get a lot of oak notes from the barrel aging. While the aroma is good, the flavor is better and more complex. I get a lot of caramel malt notes, as well as some oak, maple and vanilla. I also get a little bit of cherry and other dark fruit in the aroma which is a welcome addition. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice, relatively low alcohol barrel aged beer."
"Overall its pretty good for a strong amber I like the buiscuity bready malts and the touch of rye with just a hint of oak."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. An excelletn example of the style."
"O: I can't believe that this is an amber ale, as it has a hop character that rivals some of the best IPAs out there and really does a fantastic job of playing up and balancing its flavors. I'm shocked people don't flip out more over this beer; as simply a beer it's fantastic and as an in-style comparison it's out of this world. I would try this again and again. Excellent drinkability and pleasure in this one."
"Keep up the good work , Bruery Guys."
"O - I enjoyed this, very unique and complex flavor all over the place, but they work well together."
"O - I would like to try this one fresh off the tap, I have a feeling it would be quite different. I love the 'outdoor' flavour component to this and would have it again for sure."
"D/O: There are a few beer styles that are more likely to cause a certain type-casting of their producer; the kind of association which, for better or for worse, will forever connect brewer to style. American IPA is one such style, and the Bruery seems intent on not having their reputation tied to it. The practical outcome is that they find all sorts of other, less-conventional vehicles for hops delivery. Here, they pack a hoppy red ale with a lot of assertive oak--it is definitely not an IPA, but it stands in well enough. If anything, it is one of the most reserved and understated of all their more popular hoppy beers: less focused on the hop profile than Humulus Lager, and less intense in general than Cornballer or Old Richland. It drinks easily, but lacks that compelling extreme-ness of its cousins."
"O- I will drink again, thinking about pairing this with some apple pie!"
"O - Did I say this is very oaky/woody? Too high for my tastes. I think the wood seems to be smothering the hops a bit. Earthy and caramel/toffee malty sweetness helps but doesn't counteract the wood enough. Cut back the wood...or maybe it will mellow (unfortunately as well as the hops) and smooth out a bit with time, but not sure that will do it any service either. Somewhat enjoyable, but definitely not up there as one of my favorites either."
"D: A bit strong in the oak tastes and is a bit outside the Amber/Red category. However, still a well made beer that I really would love to bottle as a fragrance (although the missus might disagree...)"
"This is a really enjoyable beer that I wish I could try on draft. Just glad I had a chance to have one while out here."
"Overall- A very nice red ale, a very enjoyable beer to drink especially with some salami and cheese."
"Drink- One of those beers again I forgot about how good it was because it has been so long. I will have this again for sure. Good amber with strong flavors and well balanced."
"The only downfall of this beer is that there is so much going on that one pint (maybe two) is probably enough. Once you spend a few minutes really focusing on what is going in here I am ready to move on. This is a great beer but drinkability suffers due to the immense hop malt and oak character."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer. The oak adds an extra layer of complexity not typically found in a red ale."
"(750ml bottle from Provisions Store). Pours dark copper with chunky 2 finger off-white head. Aroma has wood, orange and lemon pledge (perfumey). Taste has strong wood flavor, but the hops aren't as prominent as I thought they'd be. Medium bodied with a slick/creamy texture. Finish is smooth. Mouthfeel on this is fantastic. It just coats the mouth. I'm not a huge fan of oaked beers, but this one's pretty good."
"Huge chunky pour, had to wait forever to get this in the glass, but once it was in there, a beauty. Definate oak in the nose, but some stong hops as well. Just to put it out there, not much of a fan of the oak-aged beers yet, but this may change me. It wasn't overpowering with the oak, just a suttleness that adds a ton of character to the 6.9% brew, which is welcomed compared to many of the other over the top oakey brew on the market. This won me over on drinkablility, very easy to put down, and enjoy all of the flavors, and not be worried about being ripped, good stuff."
"D - It's a keeper. Looking forward to my second glass."
"D: Happy to had tried this but do not think i would seek it out in the future. maybe if enjoyed fresher it would have been better"
"Drinkability: None of us were crazy about this one, not my favorite Bruery offering."
"I wish this was a beer that I could find on a regular basis. Sharp hop flavors that are just so delicious and wrapped around a backbone of oak which is prominent. Sticky, waxy citrus resin, some vanilla and spice. Toffee and caramel maltiness which actually leaves a nice dry aftertaste which is long a delicious."
"D- I really think anyone who likes barrel-aged beers will enjoy this one. A fresh take on a classic style. Well done."
"Glad I picked this one up while I was in California, very delicious. I think it's better than Nugget Nectar."
"Overall, this wasn't really for me. I dig the hops, but too much malt here. Very dry. I won't have too much."
"D: High... Very high. Could've drank a whole bottle by myself... And reach for another! 5/5"
"A really great rye beer, get this one."
"This is one I could easily have more of. I could drink a sixer of this easily if it came that way. A lovely job of a good ol hoppy amber."
"D - Good. This beer is quite tasty and the flavors are balanced well. Its quite intriguing with flavors that I've never really tasted before, and it makes me want to continue exploring them."
"D: Tasty beer. I'd drink this again."
"Pours a dark amber-red color with a really nice light tan head and quite a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings a fair amount of citrus and pine hops plus a bit of oak and some sweet amber malt. The taste brings more of the same with a fairly-strong oak presence plus some citrus and pine hops. Body is medium with a slight bitterness. Overall, a decent beer but a bit time and the flavors and scents never really seemed to pop or meld. Hopefully The Bruery will stray out toward styles like this more often, as this was a step in a positive direction."
"Poured from bottle into a NB globe. Pours a slightly hazy red with a two finger white head that settles into a really creamy cap with good lacing. Smell is citrusy orange zest, lots of bright fruity hops, malty sweetness, some oak, and a slight homebrew tinniness. Taste is good, but I would have preferred more of the hops that were in the aroma. Some citrus and pine hops, malty sweetness, a hint of oak with a bitter finish. Medium bodied with a medium carbonation, a bit sticky. Very drinkable but not my favorite red. Smell was the best part of this beer, I bet it is amazing when it is really fresh."
"d - A very good red ale. Normally not a favorite style of mine, this is one of the better ones I've had. Lots of nice oak and fruit in the taste. Glad I got to try it and would like to have again."
"D: A very good American red ale, highly drinkable and very tasty."
"this is delicious. i love ambers.... this is nice and complex but very vivid. i would love to drink more of this."
"Drinkability - I have a feeling this may wear on me the more I drink the bottle and I may have wished I shared it with someone, but overall, was impressed by this beer."
"D: I think it's a little strong in the oak tastes and doesn't fit the Amber/Red category. However, still a well made beer that I would enjoy having again."
"D - This was very refreshing, and is one of the better Bruery beers I've had. There seemed to be a lot of oak considering only 25% of the beer was aged that way - after a half glass I felt I could do with a touch less. Still, definitely recommended, particularly while it's fresh."
"I had to try this beer a few times before I really got it. Although it's intended to be an easy drinking beer, it's pretty complex and unique. Recommended."
"D: very drinkable beer that was very tasty out of the bottle and on tap. Real solid amber from the bruery that was not belgian style. Seems like they can also get done on american styles as well."
"An enjoyable one to drink overall. If you're going to classify this as an amber ale, it's really the class of the style. In my opinion though, this is venturing more into the imperial amber category. If you classify it as such, beers like Troegs Nugget Nectar and Green Flash Hop Head Red are certainly superior."
"Drinkability: It's pretty tasty. The restrained hop bitterness allows the quarter-oak to come forward a bit more, which I like, though hopheads may be left disdainfully shrugging their shoulders at this one."
"Quite unmatched and fresh, but not altogether mind-blowing. There's something about the barrel-aging and the flavors it imparts that makes LR taste diluted. Interesting, nonetheless."
"D - Incredibly drinkable, I wish I could get more of this on a regular basis!"
"Overall: A unique hoppy red ale that's quite delicious and very drinkable."
"Loakal Red pours an impossibly deep maroon, to the point it's beginning to cross the line into brown. Cherry highlights are readily apparent when the beer is held directly up to light though. The khaki colored crown is enormous to begin with (four plus fingers), and retention is off the charts. The frothy cap never disappears completely, but slowly drops and collapses into the center, almost as if I had dropped a scoop of ice cream into the glass that was slowly melting. Nose is a very good blend. It's equal parts citrus and caramel, with just a hint of oak coming through as well. Caramel and grapefruit show up again in the taste, but are both overpowered by the oak influence. There's some straight oak flavor, as well as an almost sour tannic quality that is way too potent. I'm a little let down that Loakal Red's not a little hoppier seeing as it advertises itself as a ""brash red ale"" on the bottle. Mouthfeel is great, medium bodied, and exceptionally chewy for being so. This would have been a problem if the beer was as hoppy as I was anticipating, but with a more subtle hop flavor it works. Carbonation is just about picture perfect too, medium to high and with enough verve to elevate what Centennial characteristics there are, yet it stops short of being fizzy. I really like the idea of Loakal Red, blending a barrel aged version of a beer this style with a fresh batch is fairly unique, but the tannic quality from the oak barrels, not to mention the oak flavor, ran roughshod over everything and ruined what was an otherwise excellently executed beer."
"Really glad i got a chance to try this one. I have yet to be disappointed with a limited realease from The Bruery, this is a favorite of their line-up so far."
"(Update 8/11/11: Had again at Stadium Tavern. No band-aid nonsense, so I'm raising the score on smell, taste, and overall 0.5 points.)"
"D: Extremely easy drinking and the hop profile, while intense, is very well done."
"Aroma has a good base of caramel and some hearty malt, nice wood character, with a good herbal- orangey hop note. Taste is big as well, good amoutn of residual sugar, medium-full mouthfeel with good toffee-ish malt, oak character, caramel. The bitterness is relatively on the lighter side, but it's there. Some vanilla in the finish. It's a very nice beer with no real flaws- I'd be happy to drink it again !"
"This is my favorite red ale in the world. So many good red ales simply go for the ipa hopping. Sure, this has tons of centennials in it, and they are very complimentary, but this is no one trick pony. The 25% barrel aging really seems to be the perfect amount."
"Beer is pretty light in body and pretty fruity (in a good way) in the flavors. Its pretty hoppy and overall good. I like this beer, its not wonderful, its not an IPA but its a solid American red. Yum."
"D-Only 6.9%, but a very complex brew. I go to school in Orange County, so a trip to the Provisions store is a weekly occurrence now. Could see myself drinking this on a regular basis. Awesome beer, Bruery!"
"Overall I could go to a bar and drink 4 of these in a row. Very easy drinking and very good."
"Very drinkable. Shame it ain't bottled."
"D: One of the few new beers from the Bruery that I've really been impressed with lately (of course, it's not Do It To Gruit). I'd gladly have another glass of this."
"D: A solid red from The Bruery. I'm not usually the biggest red fan, but this was nice, I think the oak aging helped to round out the flavours making it almost a light barleywine."
