It feels smooth across the tongue, with no real carbonated bite. It has the aforementioned citrus zest, but it's less conveyed by taste than it had through aroma. The hops aren't as heavy-handed as in some of their other offerings. There's a light, creamy aftertaste, followed by a clean, dry feeling.

The smell has a nice moderate hoppy predominance and the maltiness is well balanced with citrus and vanilla notes. There is a pronounced lemony flavor which seems perfect for the springtime. This brew can easily be drunk in the summer months as well and is not too heavy for the steamy July and August months. I drank my most recent one immediataly after a Chimay reserve and it still tasted very good which is saying a lot as the Chimay reserve is on a short list of the finest ales(or any malted beverage for that matter stout to pilsner) on the planet. My sense is that Redhook overall is underatted by most reviewers on this site. Redhook seems to rate no better than B for most of their brew and I feel they should be ranked higher.","bill93063","Jun 18, 2009"

The flavor brings a bit more pleasant apple and light malt with some grassy hop bitterness. It has spritzy carbonation but feels a bit thin though there is a bit of depth to it. Somewhat drinkable but it has too much grassy tang that blocks the refreshment for me and leaves me feeling like I need to drink something better to wash this out of my mouth and my souring stomach.

The color is as promised - not just copper, but the most refined, polished expression of crystalline copper purity you've ever seen in an ale. The head is feathery and shows graceful retention and lace. The near-absent smell suggests bread dough. And the taste is a balance of benign timidity offering no conflict and a prompt exit.

Light-bodied, smooth but, in truth, watery. Upfront there's a honeyed concentration with orange citrus and pine notes but it falls off precipitously from there.

Very well balanced, hides the alcohol while also not overblowing with hop character, good malt profile as well. Smooth and easy to quaff, in spite of it's slightly higher alcohol than most APAs this is a sessioner for sure. Overall nothing incredible but this is a damn good beer.","TheDeuce","Feb 02, 2008"

Mild aroma that's pretty lacking in hops; instead, there's a doughy malt quality in its place, along with some grains and light fruits and a distracting cleanser-like note that's minor but a touch off-putting. On the palate, mild pale grains hit first, along with a bit of juicy sweetness toward the mid-palate. Slightly sour toward the end, with a flash of hop bitterness and a finish that goes sweet again. Overall, this is certainly an OK beer, easy to drink and hard to dislike. There's little here that's special, and not much in the way of strong flavors or panache, which I would ideally look for in an APA.","geexploitation","May 30, 2007"

The look is a slightly tawny golden / copper hue with the same head retention that I get out of most Redhook beers (slightly average). The aromas area mild blend of barley malts and American hops (Both are subdued). A lightly caramel / malt flavor is balanced with lightly spiced citrus and pine hops. The hops remain light enough, not to dominate the medium malt base. The feel is a thinner-than-prefered, grain base with a slight metalic feel deep into the finish. Progressing bitterness into the aftertaste, but never deters. A fine beer that is equal on all fronts, just light in all. A good one for the bar-b-q on the hot summer padio.","BEERchitect","Feb 12, 2007"
4.02,21.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a dark golden color, just slightly darker than the usual American Lager. There are a few similarities between this beer and Sam Adam's lager. It isn't quite a smooth (probably since it is an ale), but has some similar hop flavor. I got this in the bottle at Wal Mart in Auburn, AL, and it is quite fresh. It has a refreshing smell and taste, and they balance the hops well with the malt, so you can taste them both and enjoy the beer. It is a decent session beer, but slightly bitter, which may slow some people down. It has a slight sourness, but overall nice flavor, and a very light ale. I would say it is just slightly heavier than what I expect of a lawnmower ale, but that is probably right since it is a Spring ale. Great job Red Hook--even if you are affiliated with A-B, I still think this is a fine craft brew.","zymurgy4all","Feb 10, 2007"
