"This is a great beer to ease into a darker beer. The light amber nodes give the beer a toffee and caramel taste. I love this beer with a nice piece of steak with sauteed mushrooms. Highly recommend this beer...then ease into Bell's Two Hearted!"

"Very Smooth Beer and food for beer beginner."
""
"Smooth with a good level of bitterness and some toffee hints.  I liked it overall."
"Very smooth, a bit of toffee or coffee flavors making it bitter, but the caramel undertones make it sweet."
""
""
"Not a bad beer to have, but I did not enjoy the carbonation of this beer; it was rather overpowering."
"Have not seen the bottle pictured (with stork type bird), but instead image is various natural scenes (dunes, evergreen trees, freshwater). Overall an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Amber, sweet taste with slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall a pretty good beer."
"I really like Bell's Brown.  But, the Amber is a bit too bitter for my taste."
""
"I need five words to"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too much like an IPA for my taste."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
"O: Very impressed with the drinkability, it's balanced with a nice bitterness in the middle, slight hoppy aromas and flavors. This makes me want to revisit some amber ales as I has been awhile since I've had one, I could see this beer fitting in where I might not want an IPA or a Pale Ale, I'd reach for this. This is definitely worth a try."

"i love the new packaging on this beer, a landscape in watercolor, just beautiful and unassuming. the beer in the bottle is killer too, one of the better ambers out there really. its not sweet at all, but has all the rich froth of a good one, caramel malt, and probably some oats in here too, mildly tannic, really fluffy feeling, and remarkably dry for the style. the yeast is tough to place, it doesnt taste like an irish strain, but it could be done really cold. if its an american ale strain, its pretty darn flavorful still, which i think suits the style really well, i like a yeasty amber. the beer is clear and clean too though, for having so much flavor, and even brings some earthy dried bittering hops to the table, a pleasant way to finish up a beer thats not overly complex, but extremely drinkable. a six pack is the right dose of this, and its one of the better basic beers bells does. i had it in a bottle, but would love to get my lips on some draft. this keep my faith in bells enormously high."

"great beer, but not my favorite amber, very complex flavor bouquet with cocoa, coffee and hints of a smokeyness to it. mild bitterness comes in early in aftertaste but mellowed quickly. aroma doesn't appeal as much as taste does. overall would buy again, just not quite my favorite."
"This Red Amber ale is decent.  I've had better."
""
""
"This is definitely one of those beers that is greater than the sum of its parts.  I only was able to find one, but this would be a great beer to have a few of.  Nice balance.  Lots of bread crust type flavor.  Clean and very drinkable."
"KSticky heavy brown.  Honestly doesn't do much for me.  Missing the wow factor"

"One of my favorite beers ever!  More flavor and better mouthfeel of any Amber Ale out there.....love it!  The young microbrewery fans out there have no idea about the legacy that this beer is.  It was one of the first micro brewed beers ever and helped start the whole revolution.    Thanks Larry Bell for knocking down the door of boring American Lagers and introducing us to this great beer!  By far my favorite go to beer!"

"Overall: Excellent stuff! Bell's rarely disappoints."
"On tap at the lodge in Hilton Head. Great clarity with an off color head that just makes it that much prettier. Deep amber with a light brown tint. Nose offers up caramel and firm husky grains. Superbly balanced and delicious. Feel is supple and inviting. This is one I can drink all day and for enjoyment. Great solid beer."

"the amber to rate ambers by. malty, but refreshingly bitter. i could drink gallons of this!"

"Pours a cloudy amber with a creamier white head that leaves some nice lacing and has minor retention. The aroma is mild, but has some nice notes of sweetness (bread and fruit). The taste is also pretty mild, tasty, but lacking the malt depth of the style. The body is light but has a nice smooth feel to it, with just a little bit of carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was really good. No, the flavor or smell won't blow you away, but you'd be hard-pressed to find an amber ale that does. All around, this is a delicious offering worth having. I'd probably get it again."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 12oz glass. More golden-yellow than amber colored body with a small white head. A very nice balance of malts and hops. Not as watery as a Fat Tire, or as forgettable as Flat 12's Hello My Name is Amber. Makes for a great anytime beer."

"O = A good drinking beer.  Nothing outstanding like their Oberon...just a nice beer to have sitting around on the deck.  Bet this would be a good beer to win over Bud/Coors drinkers."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is good, and that coming from a guy not generally into amber ales. It has a great spicy, herbal and buttery bread malt character. Refreshing yet oily from the hops. A whole lot of orange juice in the nose maybe some cloves. There's a little veggie like fresh green herbal notes in both nose and taste. Alcohol is not very noticeable. Medium to light mouthfeel. Really nice drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very approachable ale.  Tastes like a light malty pale ale without much citrus. I would buy this again as an easy-drinking ale for sure."
""
""
""
"O/D - While this is a good amber, it's certainly nothing to write home about, especially given the reputation of the brewery. A decent kick at the can, but lacking in depth and hop character for sure. Not worth seeking out."
""
""
""
"medium body and carbonation."
""
"Mouthfeel is rich, layered and creamy with a cascading, buttery finish."
""
"Overall: Good amber ale overall, but it could be a great one if the flavors were amped up a bit. I feel like i need to take a gulp to really taste it, which i do any ways because it is so smooth! Another example of why Bells is a solid brewery"
""

"copper ale some suspended particles.  Caramel malt at the front, creamy smooth on the finish.  Solid"

"DATE REVIEWED: August 14, 2014... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint... OCCASION: more Shark Week...APPEARANCE: orange bron amber body; two-finger, creamy off-white head; slowly effervescent and rather hazy; a decent-looking pint; nice, thick lacing... AROMA: floral hops mesh with caramel malts; sweet confectioners’ sugar is front and center ... PALATE: medium-bodied, chewy and active--a pub draft, in its consistency... TASTE: strong malty presence; mellow hops roll off the teeth and take a backseat to the nutty, somewhat buttery aftertaste--a confident offering...OVERALL:a pint for conversing over or eating pubfare with--a sessionable beer that sits well in the Bell’s sampler case..."

"I will probably not revisit this beer unless it's the sole option, but that's due more to my preferences than the quality of the beer. If not obvious, if you're an ESB fan, I think you should give it a whirl to decide for yourself."

"Not until returning to my humid existence in rainy.. err.. sunny Florida, did I try Bell's original beer, the Amber Ale. WOW! this is an excellent beer. Hoppy, sweet and bitter, with unfiltered sediment in the pour. A tall, yet light head at pour. Yet not too heavy for the Florida heat. I love this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: my first experience with Bell's Amber was a good one. nice tasty and well balanced beer will not put off anyone except maybe those freaked out by cloudy appearance. not a favorite but definitely glad I tried it!"
""
""
""
"O- This beer is special to be as it is the first craft beer I was exposed to when I was a kid and saw adults drinking things that weren't BMC products. I really enjoy this beer as a nice sessionable malty beer and I also enjoy the history of this beer as it was Larry Bell's flagship offering back in 1985."

"pours a deep golden color with decent head. aroma is slightly malty and a touch of yeast. this ale is slightly bitter in a good way and has a nice balance that is not too heavy. Overall, a very nice beer and another winner from this brewery"

"Overall: This beer is very food friendly- It would go great with some nice red meat!"
""
""
""
"It was a little darker in color then I typically would prefer. The smell was very good, smelled of caramel and a little bit of citrus similar to Oberon. The overall taste was very good, although the alcohol content was a little higher it was very smooth and crisp overall very good."
""
""
""
"This is a very good amber style beer with great flavor. To me an amber ale is a very basic beer that is just well balance with an all around good flavor, and this embodies that. I enjoy drinking this beer in the Fall when is starts to get a little colder outside."
""
"Overall this is a very refreshing, well made amber. Well balanced and easy drinking."
""
"I could probably drink several of these in a sitting and would choose it over other sessionable beers."

"For what you get though, i felt overpriced. not on any lees, says unpasturized but mine pours very clear."
""
""
"A tamed yet flavorful amber. Has a feel of a pale ale but a nice honey malt undertone. There's a bit of a celery-type taste. A dark fruit hint; grape. It's very smooth and medium bodied. Easy going feel to it, nothing strong about it. A mild honey and hoppy scent. A lovely caramel brown color, hazy with tons of sediment."
""
""
"O- I should never be surprised by Bell's, but this is a very good beer that I will try again."
"Not an amber by today's standards. Far less American hop character than we've come to expect. The malt is nice, though. Wish I liked this more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: fantastic, unique amber ale - unique in that it has a ton of the right flavors going on, perhaps crossing into a few style categories with its rich maltiness and body... worth a try - I've witnessed some casual beer drinkers digging this a lot"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - the weird bitterness is too unpleasant to consider another., but I'd consider re-sampling on tap."

""
""
""
""
""

"This offering pours a deep burgundy color with a small off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is subtle but pleasant with a nice balance of malt and hops as well as an underlying alcohol note. It sips smooth and clean with a light to medium body. The flavor is pleasant and quite balanced between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the hops. This is definitely a beer that you could sit and drink a number of and enjoy each one. Not particularly complex or remarkable but very balanced and damn good."
""
""
""
""
"Might have again if I had access; a safe bet for a solid, generally enjoyable brew."
""

""
""
""

"I had high expectations on this, that is a very good beer, but far from blowing my mind."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and well balanced amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not bad, but nothing out of this world. I was more impressed by Bell's two hearted IPA, in fact was blown away so maybe my expectations were set a bit high. I thought this beer could have been more complex. As stated, still an ok brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Really good beer, lighter and sharper then typical amber ales.. but I can dig it, plus at 5.8% its rather intoxicating. Still, if Im in the mood for a classic amber ale, I'd have to look elsewhere."
"My overall opinion is this is a hit or miss beer. Something about the ingredients or hops/malts balance I just really dislike the taste of. Others may really like the way it tastes so YMMV. I'd tell you to get the fat tire instead of this. Would not recommend."
"Aroma is malts, fruit and tangerine/tropical fruit.  The flavor is  fruit/tangerine, very mild hop resin, malts and a bitter/slightly tart finish."

"O: Incredibly easy to drink. I hadn't had this in a while, but it reminds me of how a lot of people (myself included) treat Bell's Oberon in the summer- very sessionable (not in terms of ABV, but balance and enjoyability)."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All around great balanced beer."
"Overall: This beer is a nice example of this style. Don't know why it took me (a Michigander) so long to discover this beer - although I don't think it's overly prevalent in the stores and bars that I frequent. It will be my go-to beer when it's available and I want an amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not much too this one, but that doesn't make it unenjoyable. It's light and sessionable, so it has it's place in the beer drinking world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Spicy hops and rigorous toastiness melds in with rich amber malts. The maltiness is pretty dominant, yet curt on by-flavors, in an American way. Crispiness from the hops pulls out interesting hints of brown sugar and almost cinnamon or clove from the steeped grains. Hardly noticeable is any alcohol. Hops are more spicy and floral than anything else, however, there is a backdrop of citrus pith. No sweetness from the hops, and only a malty sugar sense from the fermented grain remains with still-persistent dryness. Fuller-bodied for an amber ale. A lot went into this beer to produce a fantastically clean, refined, and simple beer. Bell's Amber offers a solid-bodied drink with a crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that really pulls out all of the quality ingredients in their naked simplicity. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed amber orange. Cloudy with a loose head of foam that fell fast to a thin ring. Leaves soapy lace to fall as you drink. Nose is faint. If I dive right in I can get some light caramel and bread and the faintest hop floral. Taste is mild. The grain is toasted to amber perfection and has a nice round and full flavor that presents a natural sweetness but the caramel is almost too faint to be observed on the palate. it tastes like whole grain bread. As it warms it starts to develop a hop floral that is a bit sweet on the nose and in the drink. It has soda like carbonation so quite strong. It finishes with a bit of bitter but mid palate it's just bland. It could have used more malt depth and more malt sweetness. The body of the beer is thin and has a bit of slickness to it. Finishes semi dry with an aftertaste of flaked cereal grain. There is a hint of citric tartness also int he finish but it seems like too little , too late."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a random pick up in a choose your own 6-pack. I've had a few other Amber ales that weren't bad, but nothing I'd join a site just to review and remember. My expectations weren't too high, which made it all the better. It looks good, and smells great, but that's just the start. Slightly hoppy, slightly bitter, slightly smokey, great feel. Overall it has all the elements of a great beer, and they're in harmony unlike other beers that overkill one element. I think it's my new favorite all-season beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a damn good amber ale. Very easy to drink, very refreshing, and very tasty. Solid offering. I’d certainly get it again."
""
""
""
""
"I am drinking the last one now. I slow poured it into a Mason jar and let it sit for 3 minutes until the head was down and the lacing was left. The taste and the temperature were perfect. This is a fine ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall balance is key with this one. Is smooth and something anyone could enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O – 3.75 – It's alright, I'm kind of disappointed though because I got such great feedback on it from my friends back home in Michigan. It's an Amber Ale, for sure."

""
""
""
"It's been a minute since I've had this beer. It's a good example of the style."
""
"O - a real deal classic and what I consider the staple of American amber ales. It's very good stuff and enjoyable. There's nothing flashy or in your face with Bell's amber. Just a down right good tasting ale that's really stunning to look at. There's nothing bad to say about this. Ill continue picking this up throughout every year like I have for the multiple years that's past. One I can pick up and know exactly what I'm getting and one that always brings a smile to my face."

"Overall, this is a great breakfast beer. It's light and it goes down smooth. It doesn't feel like I'm drinking a beer. This is not one of my favorites, but for its style, I dig it because it's simple."
"overall: A highly drinkable beer from Bell's, also their first beer I think as well. Probably their most accessible, I'd find it hard for someone to not like this, yet it doesn't have any super complex flavor profiles to make it super interesting. But that's what their goal was, make a great well balanced beer that you can enjoy in almost situation. I wouldn't say seek it out, but it's widely available and cheap and you will not be disappointed. Perfect summer beer."
"D – The taste isn’t bad but the aroma really is hindering my enjoyment."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Works as a good summer beer, although it's a little maltier than I like my ambers. The toasted character is highly emphasized but doesn't seem to hold on all the way through, especially when the strong grainy bitterness comes around. I wish the hops were a little bit more present as well, and the same goes for the initial cereal flavors I found satisfying. Solid, but not my favorite offering by Bell's."

"Overall: You can't go wrong with this Bell's Amber Ale!"

"Maybe as well constructed as this particular style can be, but this genre has a lot of mushy, tastes-like-a-whole-heck-of-a-lot-of-nothing beers in it, and so really damning with faint praise here. Not awful, this is actually a higher score than I'd expected to give it, but I doubt I'd ever knowingly go looking for it again."

"This amber constraints on the roasted nutty qualities of the malt and doesn't showcase huge hops, as so many ambers seem to be doing. For that I say thanks."

"Pours a hazy amber/brown with tons of yeast chunkies throughout. Aroma is of light grain. Taste is big toffee, toasty grain flavor up front, followed by some earthy, fruity flavors, and a bit of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is rich. Overall a good Amber Ale that I would get again."

"O- I am not a Red ale fan so i did my best but i would have to say this is one of the better ones i have had. I love Bell's and i think they turn out quality beer regardless of style."

"The body is medium/light and crisp with mild carbonation. Very easy to drink as this ale is balanced so perfectly. No flavor over powers the other, making this ale a pleasure to drink. The only question that comes to mind is ""can I have another?"" because Bell's nailed this style."

"D/O: Goes down smooth. Easy-drinkin'. I could knock this back in large quantities. I'm attributing a significant percentage of the flavor here to hop addition, and therefore I do believe ""freshness"" would be a concern here moreso than for many other ""amber/red ales"". If fresh, I could blast a six-pack of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours up a nice coppery amber color with a small white head, decent retention and decent lacing. The nose is fairly subtle. To my nose I could really only pick up what smelled a little like cinammon. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation. Taste is nice. Kind of grass, biscuit, and hops. The malt upfront is kind of buried in the mix though. Not too bad. About what I expect from Bells."

"Not being a big fan of ambers, I enjoyed this immensely."
"Overall, I will say it's not my favorite beer. Not even close. But it is as close to the perfect straight Amber Ale as I've ever tasted. And according to the way we try to rate beers here, this deserves one of the best ratings I've given. Again, there are dozens of beers I personally enjoy more, but, that being said, this is far and away the best straight amber I've ever had."
"Give it a try if you find a single, pass on a six pack though."

"Overall, I thought right off the bat I'd be let down as soon as I caught a whiff. I was happy to see that the taste isn't much like the aroma at all. I actually enjoyed this beer the more I drank it, and I feel I'd just enjoy it more if I tried it again. A very good amber if you can get passed the smell."

"taste...is amazing! wow! this is the first beer thats really surprised (in a good way) me in a while! initially its pretty sweet and malty, almost to the point that you'd think it was going overtake the beer, but then after a second or two the sweetness completly dissapaits and you get some caramely malts and a very easy to drink smooth well rounded balaced beer. there is also this carbonated tingling... that is unexplainable but great, never expierienced that before but loved it! Move over alaskan and full sail this is my new favorite amber! Sessionable!"

"O- A decent beer but a little lacking in the aroma and maltiness for the style."
""
"The palate opens with a nice blend of toasted and caramel malt with some cotton candy, brown sugar and bread notes, all light and in great balance. The is accompanied by the hop character, which is soft and resplendent, with a blend of sweet grapefruit, pine and oranges. Medium-light in body with a mildly chewy feel and mid-palate, this beer is moderately carbonated and is a treat on the palate. This is a pretty excellent amber if you ask me. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Pours out a hazy amber color with a short lived but pretty-while-it-lasts head, no lacing. Smells of biscuit dough and a touch of caramel apple with just a whispered hint of pie spicing. Tastes about evenly of bready notes and fruity esters, with a clean bitter finish, crisp texture and medium carbonation levels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: You can't go wrong with this Bell's Amber Ale!"

"A very nice light beer here. Brings some nice flavor to the table but does not overwhelm. Should be good for the average beer drinker as well as people with a more refined taste."

"Bottle pours a deep reddish brown color with a cream colored head. Aroma includes a little funk, some floral notes, light bready malts, and a bit of fruit. Light mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Flavor is somewhat watered down for my tastes, light bready malts, just a hint of sweet fruit and caramel. Something about this just didn't seem right. Certainly drinkable, but nothing special."
"This is a decent beer, but simplistic. The caramel takes the forefront with a subtle hop character. It's easy to drink, but ultimately boring."

"Amber pour, hah, thin head, a little medium-fine lacing. Smells of pine, honey, sweet light citrus, bread. Taste is solid and has a non-overpowering balanced malt-hop ratio, excellent session brew, great signature, very solid taste, would buy again. One of my favorite non-ipa ales from Bells."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts. Taste is caramel malts up front, some hops, slight bitterness at the finish. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 3/22/2012. Pours a very hazy orange amber color with a nice 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of biscuit, toast, caramel, light citrus, floral, and nuttiness. Some pretty good well balanced aromas that are a bit muted. Taste of caramel, biscuit, grapefruit, orange, floral, toast, nuttiness, and light pine. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, grapefruit, toast, floral, and light pine on the finish for a short bit. Slightly dry on the finish. Good balance of citrus hop flavors with the malt backbone. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly crisp mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with pretty much no warming noticed at all on the finish. Very easy to drink as expected for 5.8%. Overall this is a very nice amber ale. Nice flavor balance and smoothness; very sessionable and enjoyable."

"This one by Bell's is a typical amber ale---well, typically good. Nothing really bad about it, but nothing stands out as better than the rest out there. Good balance of malt and hops, no bitterness, caramel smooth finish, and the cloudy appearance makes it somewhat different."

"A uniquely flavored amber ale - refreshing on a warm day, and well paired with a strong cheese."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and enjoyable. The beer is well balanced and could be sessionable (though it is approaching a touch too strong in ABV to have more than a few)."
"Pours reddish brown with no head at all. Aromas of caramel malt, a bit of bread and maple, vanila and a faint nuttiness. Taste is similar with a bit of hops thrown in. Pretty nice. I've had this in bottles several times, and it is noticeably more enjoyable on cask. Very smooth mouthfeel with a faintly bitter finish. This is a style I normally don't enjoy that much except for hoppier ambers, but on cask this is pretty enjoyable."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured true to its name...with a thin head that receded into a thinner cap and oily lacing. Some sediment and better than average carbonation. Very nice nose of malt and resin with a touch of caramel. Taste followed the nose with good bread and some grass. No aftertaste to speak of from this light to medium-bodied brew, tasted toward the back of the mouth. One of the better beers I've tasted recently. They call it the flagship of Bell's and while I haven't had the coveted ""HopSlam"" yet, it's the best Bell's offering I've had."

"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. Not my favorite style, but one of the better easily accessible amber ales out there. Not of toasted and bready malts in the nose and some sweet fruity malts in the taste. Very easy to drink, could see a lot of non-craft beer drinkers enjoying this. Wouldn't buy it too often but worth checking out."
"Pours a rich amber with a thick, frothy khaki head. Wonderful retention and lacing, shockingly so for an amber. A nice sweet bready aroma mixed with a little fruit. A sweet and smooth flavor. Sugary, toffee, a little banana, bread, and a touch of lemon. I usually dislike toffee but they do a nice job with it here, it isn't too strong and dominating. A creamy medium bodied to this, not too much carbonation. A very representation of an an amber, though not my favorite amber I have tried. I've long been wanting to check out some Bell's offerings so glad to have finally tried something by them. Still wish it could have been 2 Hearted instead though!"
""
"Deep copper hue, a little haze, but a great head that starts out fluffy and then collapses in on itself to stick around and stay thick. Malt and a bit of bread on the nose, I wouldn't mind a little bit of hops and some more complex grainy character. Incredibly delicious beer - the bread shows up here, and so do the hops, the malt doesn't bail. Wow. This beer has a great depth of flavor, and remarkable interplay and balance in the elements of its taste. A real pleasure to drink, decent bodied but doesn't require chewing, carbonated but doesn't try to jump back up your throat. Overall, a terrific example of what basic American microbrewing is at its best. It doesn't need to be crazy hoppy. This is a well-balanced, totally thought out beer. That being said, it is simply not the type to knock your socks off and be a once-in-a-lifetime. That's ok by me -- I'll happily keep this in my mental list of go-to basics for the rest of my life."

"it pours a slightly hazy slightly golden amber with a solid head that is hanging around. the malt is solid with a lasting taste. the hopy note is rather light with no real bitterness. it has the right refreshing fell in the mouth. nice and bubbly. i prefer a strong IPA. so this was surprising how good it was to me. i recomend this fine amber ale from bells!"
"Plenty of carbonation greets the tongue and lingers throughout the semi-dry finish. The body is on the light side of medium and the feel is slightly thin. There's no doubt this makes a good well-balanced session beer with enough flavor to stay satisfying."

"This beer pours a bold, clear amber with a thin head and lace lasting to the end. It's aroma is of sweet, roasted malt, dough, pine and straw. The flavor is fruity with notes of roasted nuts, bread crust, and a hint of toffee in the background. There's a smooth hop bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium. Bells Amber Ale is a good brew, refreshing and very drinkable. Recommended!"

"Pours an orange/copper color w/ a thin off white head. Good lacing on the side of my snifter. Lots of yeast hanging out in this brew- just enjoying life living in a Bell's beer. The nose is sweet malt, fruit, yeast. A very nice smelling brew- very balanced and pleasant. The taste follows the nose exactly, with hops being added to the mix. Very tasty for the style. Feel is medium, creamy, with a nice full finish. Overall, another solid brew from Bell's. Cheers."

"On Tap at Copper Cellar, Knoxville. Pours amber with a long lasting, thick white head. Aroma is of ripe fruit and caramel malt. Medium-full, creamy body. Taste is of caramel malt, ripe fruit and earthy hops, some hints of chocolate. Long, dry finish. Tasty session brew."

""
"Overall: A Very Good Ale not over powering but still with great taste, very nicely balanced. I definately recommend."
"D: A bit light in some ways, but oh well – it still has lots of flavor & character and is very balanced. A rather well put together & executed amber. It is very drinkable, but at 5.8% it is getting up there. One of many solid anchors in Bell’s portfolio."

"I was able to sample the Bell's Amber Ale at ""The Bank"" in Wheaton. The beer pours a clear amber and thin tan head which laced nicely. The scent was a sweet malt The taste included a sweet malt with floral hop finish. The mouthfeel was a medium body ale with good carbontation. Overall the beer is an easy drinking beer with good flavor and nothing takes over."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours clear amber with a small white head. The head fades slowly and leaves a moderate amount of fine lace throughout. On the nose, there are aromas of caramel, grain, toasted malts, and hints of fruit and pine. The flavor is balanced between moderately sweet caramel malts and earthy, piney hops. The finish is moderate in length, with toasted grain. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation. An excellent and easy-drinking amber ale."

"Pretty much the definitiion for an Amber Ale. Poured at about the right temperature for a small to medium, light tan head that soon settled out. Color is a clear honey amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is malt, beer, and a little roast, hop, and fruit. Flavor is similar to nose with just a little sweetness to balance the carbonic tang and slight roast and hop. Body is superb, with excellent carbonation. Finish is like flavor and slowly fades with no off notes. Super easy drinking beer."

"Solid Amber Ale."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent Amber Ale. This beer is exactly what a great Amber Ale should be light, great balance between malts and hops, great looks, great mouthfeel, and great drinkability. I could have drank a six pack of this in a sitting, its got good flavor and it goes down so smooth that I can't help but want to grab another one. This is also a great beer to have with dinner and goes great with a steak or a bratwust. What I like most about this beer is pretty much everything, it looks good, it smells good, it tastes good, and it feels good, its firing on all cylinders. There isn't really anything I don't like or would change about this beer, it is fine just the way it is. I will be buying this beer again as I have for a while now, it's a great example of it's style and I will always have room in my fridge for a six pack. This beer should be tried by everyone, and if you love Amber Ales, this is one of the best widely available ones. So far this has been the best Amber Ale I have had, it has the right amount of balance that to me makes the perfect Amber Ale. Bell's really does a great job at making a beer to style with great balance, I find a lot of Amber Ales are either malt forward or hop forward, but this beer was right in the middle and that is how it should be done, other brewers need to take note."
"This is a classic Amber Ale. The beer poured out with a nice reddish looking color with a pretty good looking head on top that isn't afraid to stick around for a little while. The smell of the beer is well balanced between the hops and malts. The taste of the beer was pretty good too, much like the nose. There are plenty of hops and malts working together to make this a nice drinkable beer. The mouthfeel isn't overwhelming at all it's drinkable and easy to have a few in a sitting if you want to. Overall this beer is worth trying I think."
"M./O. The mouthfeel is a smooth and creamy softness that gives the beer a buttery feel and overall it is a good beer to enjoy most anytime."
"My boyfriend strongly dislikes the new bottle art. That said, it's a good beer. Hazy amber with a huge head and a floral hops/bready malts kind of nose. Taste is caramel, biscuit, some nice zingy lemon/floral hops. Perfectly carbonated and creamy mouthfeel. Nothing standout but really a solid amber."
"It's deep, hazy amber color reminds me of cider, and it's frothy head retains shape similar to a nice cafe latte. The aroma smells of fresh baked bread with a hint of juicy grapefruit hidden beneath. When tasting the beer there is a nice balance of malt, grains, tropical fruit, and a piny zing towards the end. Reasonably full mouth feel - while it is not 'thick' it coats the mouth pleasantly. A good beer for any time."
"This amber brings out the best of its kind of beers, while utilizing hops in a more prominent, yet subdued role. Awesome beer and a new session beer for me."
"Over all I am impressed. This beer explained to me the rave about bells. Honestly I had to question it before this beer. Well done."
"Overall- It is a very good ale that is refreshing and has an original flavor I have not yet experienced in an ale."
"O - Very solid selection for an Amber Ale. Excellent drinkability with good balance between malts and hops."
"I've had this on cask before and very much enjoyed it. I think it is better suited in a bottle though. Being that this is Bell's flagship beer, you know it has to be well made. Sure, its a no frills, nothing special kinda beer, but it is done very well and easy to enjoy."
"An ok amber ale, the expected fruity sweetness turned on its head, opting for the acidic in lieu of the sugary complement."
"Overall I love a solid red ale and this is no exception."
"A good, classic amber ale."
"One of the best ambers I’ve ever had (at least rated). Another great beer by Bell’s."
"I decided to update my review after realizing I first tried this in a Duvel glass, which does not do this beer any favors. Tried in a standard pint glass, the flavor profile changes a bit, and for the better. The flavors became more intense, and a bit more complex. Drink this one in a pint glass, and you will find it to be a nice beer."
"O- It''s nice, nothing special but nice."
"O: Very drinkable brew. Would recommend to a friend."
"Overall: I like it. I am not a huge fan of hoppy beer (as of right now) but the balance of this beer with some hoppy bite may be a way to acquire that taste. Would drink this again and recommend to a friend."
"O-good solid beer I will get again"
"O: Solid amber ale. I was pleasantly surprised. I would get this again"
"O: This Amber ale is really drinkable, and I loved everything about it, but I do with it had a bit more of an aroma. Still, one of my new favorites."
"Pours a medium golden amber with a thin head that laces nicely. Has a light, clean malt smell with a hint of hops. Taste is light and malty on the front with a mild hop bitterness through the middle and back. Very refreshing with a medium/ thin mouthfeel and good carbonation. Good bitterness on the finish. A delightful amber ale."
"Overall: A beer for the drunk in us all. I could drink this beer all night...and the next morning. It has some nice balance to it-- in fact, balance is its strength. I wish I could have this one on tap. I bet I would end up giving it a higher review if the beer were actually taken care of by the retailer."
"O: A very sold beer. I can't remember what exactly it was like because it was at a pub and I have had several other drinks since then, but either way a solid brew and a first time for this one for me."
"Very surprised. This for a red beer is a winner."
"O: Overall, I'd imagine this would be a different story fresh on tap, but this 6 pack has been a bit underwhelming and falls short of what I expect / hope for in an amber ale. Decent but forgettable."
"Beer is medium in body and really malty on the forward, the finish is heavy and syrupy with a mild hop presence. The beer in the middle is a little heavy and still sweet with the malt. Overall it is a malty red, nothing too special but drinkable for sure."
"Bell's Amber is a classic, but I don't find it to be one of their better offerings. I could drink a lot of these and have at parties down in K-zoo when my friends were going to Western for college, but it is not really a beer I ever buy anymore unless it is the only Bell's available. If you are a big fan of ambers though, you may think differently"
"Appears cloudy with a thin white head. Smells malty and balanced, hop presence is muted. Taste is well balanced, biscuity and smooth. A little sweet citrus hop action in the background. Mouthfeel is average to good.... very pleasant and easy going. Carbonation is medium. Overall a decent amber ale.... not knockin' my socks off though just sayin. This would be nice to keep around for guests and easy drinkin' nights."
"Overall: A great amber ale. Maybe not my favorite (a title which belongs to Troeg's HopBack), but certainly worthy of trying. Balanced, drinkable, and plenty of complexity in the flavor. Would love to make this a staple in my fridge."
"D - A respectable American Amber... Simple straight-forward and fairly effective... Nothing special, but no real complaints either... A solid flagship brew for Bell's..."
"O: An okay amber ale, but not really any better than any number of amber ales I've had."
"Easy drinking with good flavor and nothing takes over. A good fairly subtle amber to drink a few of. Hoppy finish increases but not considerably."
"O - Overall pretty good, but doesn't stand above other good amber ales."
"This beers pours a hazy amber color, with a little bit of a lacey head, that did hang out for a while. The smell is malty, and a bit eartly. The taste is malty, a bit sweet, and very full, doesnt have that offesnive dirt taste like the smell may indicate. Good full flavor, doesnt stay on the paletee forever. Overall a decent amber ale, and enjoyable, I would get again, but didnt knock my socks off."
"Amber colored beer that had a head with some okay retention and some small lacing on the sides. It smells mostly of caramel malts and grain and has just the slightest bit of hops there. Taste is really a lot like the nose, although the hops are not quite as much as I thought they would be. Some medium-level carbonatoin and the beer has a good syrupy coating aspect to it while managing not to get too heavy. I found this to be very drinkable but I wish there was more hops in it."
"O: Bell's Amber Ale isn't by any means the best amber on the market, but it isn't half bad. I don't see myself reaching for this one often, but will make a point of returning to it down the road. In the meantime, there are plenty of other ambers I'll be grabbing over this."
"12oz bottle into a pint glass, a hazy amber body with 2 fingers of off white head that does leave some lacing. A nice array of citrus hops and sweet malts have been apparent from the initial pour. Well balanced on the tongue, the hops are upfront and fairly prominent ... but give them a few seconds as a nice malty finish is coming. Also a great feel to this Amber Ale, medium bodied and maybe a touch under average carbonation, and has a creamy texture - quite nice. I really liked this, another great beer from the folks at Bell's."
"O: I could drink Bell's Amber all day long. This would make a really nice beer to ween BMC drinkers off the big boys' teet."
"O. The flavor is better and more complex than I had hoped for. Definitely a buy again."
"Overall Impression- Not the best from Bell's. I'm hopping there was going to be more mouthfeel and flavor but too sweet for a amber ale. Won't go back to this beer but wouldn't sway someones opinion to a negative one about this beer."
"Taste - Bready caramel, fruit, very subdued and integrated hops flavours."
"O: Overall, I like this beer. While it seems a bit heavy after drinking it, I look forward to having another."
"O - I haven't had a beer from Bell's that I didn't like. This is a great example of the style, probably the best that I've had. At 5.5% I'd see this as a decent session beer. It drinks really well - wouldn't have a problem knocking back a few of these."
"An amber, copper colored beer with a nice thick white head that fades fast but leaves ok lace. Teh smell is of biscuits, caramel, and earthy hops. The balance is very well done. Hops make theirself known with some grassy, earthy notes and a hint of spice but dominated with caramel malts and a touch of cocoa. The mouthfeel is a bit thin with a creamy edge. Overall, a nice, easy to drink, crisp and refreshing amber ale. Simple, but great."
"O: As I keep purchasing this brewery's beer I can only say great beer and will go back to it time and time again."
"O: This is not one of my favorite Ambers. I tend to like them with more carmel flavor and a little more hoppy. Still, not a bad beer."
"12oz bottle. Batch 10159 - bottled on Jan. 19, 2011. Pours an uber-cloudy dark orange with a thin white head as a capper. Retention is lacking. No lace left behind. Boring. The nose is mildly sweet with notes of honey, caramel, crackers. Hops are surprisingly absent in the nose. Again, sort of boring. Nice medium chew to the body. Decent carbonation level backs it up and carries it through to the end. Have I become jaded by all the highly-hopped Ambers out there? This one comes across as mellow, albeit flavorful. Lots of sweet malts, mild hop bite, bready finish. There's a faint citrus tartness to it on the back end, but it's fleeting. All-in-all this was a good beer. I wouldn't stress too much to get some more, but not a beer I would ever turn down."
"O - A pretty solid amber all around, it's unique from others in that the yeast notes play a bigger role than other brews. It challenges the drinker with something other than a hop-loaded amber like the rest of the world produces. Well-balanced here."
"D: I polished this off pretty quickly. Probably would be a staple in my fridge. I think I had this recently. As in, last week. Going with Bell's Amber Ale (4)"
"Some malts present in the taste, not much by way of hops. Balanced taste-neither too sweet or bitter. Good session beer but a little forgettable."
"I wonder how this would taste on tap… most beers taste different on tap. Not saying they taste better, just different. Man, that aftertaste just isn’t going away. Bravo Bell’s!"
"Nice sweet malty caramel flavors which give way to some creamy nuttiness. Some nice hop bitterness finishes it off. This is a very smooth and easy-drinking beer. The hops contribute, but don't bite too hard. There are no questionable off-flavors or odd qualities. A good session beer with a nice balance. If you're a real hop head, you might be a little disappointed. Sometimes I get tired of all my beers tasting like IPAs, so I will definitely buy this again. It's a great example of this style."
"D: Very high. I really like this beer, it could become a new standard Amber for me."
"O: A good beer and a very nice everyday drinker. Surprised I haven't picked up one of these before, but I certainly will again."
"O - I might have found my staple beer. Whether you're a session drinker or not, this beer will satisfy both sides. It's something to talk about and something to have on hand to quench your thirst."
"Drinkability is high, this is a really tasty Amber Ale, just sweet enough to satisfy but not get cloying, the citrus note of the hops keeps it interesting, very well made. I'll have another!"
"Overall it's a good amber. However if i'm going for a sweet amber, i'm getting a Duck rabbit."
"Overall - This beer transcended my expectation and has opened my eyes to the bold and exhilarating world of red ale and I now have a longing for more"
"O: A little disappointing, but it made its way over 1000 miles from Michigan to Florida. Definitely tasted better when I had it on tap, or so I thought."
"This beer poured a very light amber color with a fizzle of perhaps a half finger of white foam on the surface. The aromatics are malty and pleasant. There's nothing much to them, but there doesn't have to be. A touch of caramel malt gives this beer the mild caramel sweetness to accent the premium pale malt used. The hops tingle on the palate upfront, but don't really leave much residual bitterness. It's a solid beer tastes great, very few people would find something wrong with this tasty yet simplistic beer. I have already recommended this beer, and will continue to do so."
"Poured this American Amber Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a cloudy orange color and produced a 1 inch white head. Head retention was below average. Lacing was very good. The Aroma of the ale was full of roasted malt with a hint of hop and citrus. The taste of the beer was outstanding. It was very drinkable, and had nice body. The beer was first and foremost filled with roasted and malt and it gave way to a nice sweet finish. High drinkability- Perfect session beer. This is the most outstanding example of an American Amber Ale that I have had to date."
"Overall: A decent version of a red but a little too light."
"super sessionable and easy to drink. i very much enjoy this style, mostly for its tasty simplicity. the aroma doesnt suggest a whole lot of flavor, but despite the lack of complexity, its quite tasty. i would drink this again if it was available to me, just not something id really go to much out of my way to try again."
"A really solid malty amber. Nice caramel and toasty flavors, usually not a fan of these beers, but this was pleasant."
"I mean, it's not unpleasant, but there's something missing here. I could drink more, but it leaves me wanting ..."
"Overall this is a decent example of an amber but nothing too extraordinary. I want to give it more credit than it deserves but find it just too plain. It is was it is supposed to be, a sessionable Amber/Red ale. I just wish it had more memorable characteristics."
"Overall-A very drinkable version of the style. Nothing memorable about it. A classic version of a midwest/east coast amber focused more towards malt than hops. I prefer the hoppier versions of the style. That being said, a very drinkable, full-flavored session all."
"Overall: Bell's makes so many great beers, this is not one of them."
"This Bell's beer pours to a beautiful red color with some cloudiness. The head was off white and just about 2 fingers and rolls down the glass with every sip. The smell was malty with a very smooth taste. I loved this beer from the first sip and will purchase many more."
"Bell's makes some of my favorite beers, and the amber is a great one. It has a beautiful copper color, and a nice clear appearance. The head is a decent sized off-white. It has a mild, but very tasty hops profile. I would describe the body as being on the lighter side which makes this a very easy beer to drink. I think this is better than any of the amber ales I've had in awhile. It might not be strong enough for some people, at least compared to other ambers, but I think most would agree that it tastes great."
"I'm wondering whether having it on-tap changed the feel, because it felt much thicker to me than it seems for most other people judging from the other reviews."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a bright, crystal clear copper coloring, with a thin ring of film for head. The nose is a very pleasant, mouth watering toasted caramel smell. In mouth, the beer has slightly sour caramel flavors riding on a mild bitter hopped backbone. Round and slightly oily in mouth, with a slick finish. Toasty and sour aftertaste, with lingering bitter and sour flavors in the finish. Decent beer, but not mind blowing. Very easy to drink, and drink lots of."
"drinka: see ""taste"""
"D- Very drinkingable beer. Really like this beer. Nothing amazing about this beer but very good overall"
"D - A decent beer here. More than I would have expected from an Amber. A nice sessionable drink."
"An average amber ale, not something that I would seek out. Drinks fine but the flavors don't blow me away."
"Drunkability - Could definitely throw a sixer down of these but it wouldn't be my first choice if I was craving red ale."
"D - At the price these were at a beer store ($9.89/6-pack) known for their notoriously great deals on craft beer, I cannot understand why this didn't come across as good as I was expecting. I'm no cheapskate, but these are simply not worth their value. Oh well. Overall, this is an average amber -- so it is very drinkable however I just don't see myself purchasing another unless the price comes down to par with New Belgium or Sierra Nevada."
"M/D Good carbonation, easily drinkable. Representative of the style."
"This beer should be a staple of all bars and pubs, I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"A good beer that is very well balanced. It would defiantly appeal to all types of taste."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, but a bit too sweet for me. I think I could only have one per sitting and no more than that."
"D - Easy to drink, for sure. Not my favorite, but it's no problem."
"Very sessionable."
"D: This is solid but nothing to write home about."
"D-very good. Done with my beer in no time."
"I love the color of this beer, a deep red brown. The immediate taste is on the bitter side but quite drinkable and enjoyable. Not a big fan of the after taste, which lingers. Not a very clean taste. Dark undertones of malt, reminds me of a dark chocolate or molasses."
"I was actually a little surprised to find that I've never had this ordinary Bell's offering before. Go figure. I'm havin' now, then, I guess. It pours a clear russet-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises thick caramel, grapefruit, orange peel, and flowers. The taste favors the orange over the grapefruit, but doesn't really deviate from the smell beyond that. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice amber, nothing standoutish but tasty and drinkable regardless."
"Pours a protein particle-infused amber. A tannish head soon becomes a ring. Smell is clean, toasted malts. I get some mellow hops at first taste, then that nice malty backbone. Smooth, silky sweetness it is. Then another round of bitterness, until finally mellowing out into an almost minty aftertaste. Carbonated well, and lively, despite not looking like it. Unique, but almost all Bell's are. Drinks good."
"Cheers!"
"Not a bad introductory craft brew, it worked for me. Nowadays I usually reach for something else, but it's still a solid standby option."
"D-Through the roof on this one. Amazingly more flavor than the original. A little on the thin side but the abundance of flavor carries it well."
"Cheers"
"I will try this again in the future, maybe we have some old or bad batches around here?"
"Good entry level craft beer. Not worth seeking out, but def. worth quaffing if presented with one."
"In the taste the hop bitterness comes through more, but with the caramel taste tames it some. It feels medium bodied. It taste great! The bitterness of the hops linger a little. Would make a good session beer, in my opinion, even though it's 5.8 abv.(slightly out of the definition of session)."
"Bottoms up, these go down easy."
"Drinkability - Pretty interesting brew. Not terribly complex, but nice-tasting and unique."
"Nice malty flavor with some light sweet citrus hop flavor in the background. This is a solid ""sessionable"" brew."
"First time having Bells Amber. Looks good sitting in the glass with a creamy off-white head and sharp clarity. Nose is subdued but smells fresh. Mostly caramel and bready malts but there is a bit of earthy hop aroma coming through. Palate is quite mild, even compared to the nose. Clean caramel malt flavor with a small hop profile. Moderate body with a proper level of carbonation. Easy drinking brew that could easily be sessioned. Although I enjoyed it, I was expecting a bit more from this beer in the flavor department. Nonetheless, worthy of a try."
"The previous comment takes away from last category. Too bad. It seems to be going for an everyday sort of drink - I believe it was referred to as the brewery ""flagship"" beer, in which it probably under-represents what this fine brewery is capable of producing. Nonetheless, a adequately drinkable beer, that I'd like to give a shot to fresh and on tap."
"D- Nothing special, but something that you can sip on regularly if you have an acquired taste for it."
"D: not a huge red/amber ale fan, but this is quite good. Try this offering by Bells."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium body with medium to medium high carbonation. Not much on the nose for a Bells beer but it makes up for it in flavor."
"Could easily drink several of these. Great beer overall"
"Overall: A winner from Bell's."
"D: Sky high."
"Drinkability: Being as this was my first Bell's beer, it was very enjoyable. Easily drinkable. Looking forward to more from this company, whenever I can get my hands on it."
"Drinkability: A good pairing for Indian. had this with Indian style meat loaf was fantastic. A good beer for higher surroundings"
"D: I felt like I was back in London drinking this lovely cask ale!"
"Drinkability: This was pleasantly drinkable with some nice complexity that will continue to develop over a session. Amber is not my style of choice, but there is good reason why this is their flagship beer."
"This is a highly drinkable brew - a crowd pleaser and caseworthy."
"D - Very high. Great beer."
"Very good amber ale, tremendous session brew. Another top shelf effort from Bell's, who are among the top breweries right now."
"The mouthfeel is spot-on as well. It's on the lighter side of medium bodied and about medium carbonation too, it works well with the flavor profile. Which is super-drinkable, by the way. It lends itself to huge gulps, and almost tastes like apple cider if I close my eyes and drink fast. A great beer and a worthy flagship for Bell's. Anyone should be able to enjoy this beer."
"D - Very drinkable, cask adds tons of character to this beer."
"D: Especially tasty when served fresh and on draft, this was an enjoyable brew."
"T&M: more breadiness then I remembered it. medium bodied, medium to low carbonation. touch of boozy in the aftertaste."
"This one sounds simple but its rather good."
"Deep brownish-orange color, short slightly off-white foam. Good head retention, and thick lace on the inside of my glass. Sweet, grainy smell. Fruity sweetness and a clean hop aroma. Full malt body, sweet but not too sticky or cloying, with enough hop finish keeping things in balance. Medium body, good mouthfeel, flavorful, crisp and lclean finish, easy to drink."
"M/D: Medium bodied with high carbonation. Overall its good, but I have had better in the style and probably wouldn't reach for it again."
"Drinkability is a wild card on this one. The menagerie of initial flavors is promising and the mouthfeel is really great, yet this is still a pretty unsatisfying beer. Even within the amber ale style, there are many other beers that I would rather be drinking. I love Bell's and appreciate a good amber, but this is not for me. Meh."
"Hazy, light brown or maple appearance, good tan head. Aroma is of a complex malt with a little sweetness. Light flavor, full malt, lots of grain flavors rolling around. Light, clean body, malt sweetness in the aftertaste. Easy to drink, light amber ale, typical Bell's malty style."
"Overall/notes: Good beer, sure. I'll admit to committing what some might call a sin: the first time I had this, I was in a ""contest"" that I lost, and was forced to chug. So, hey! Let's give it a try! That I did... Not surprised that this is a perfectly good beer. I like how it changes character as it warms a bit. Adds to the drinkability."
"Reviewed on: 11-02-2010 20:18:03"
"Sightly orange copper pour with a small white head. Definite not filtered as there's quite a lot of particles. Lots of toasty caramel, and honey character with hints of nuts and dark fruit. There's also a little bit of citrus in the aroma and the finish. Also, the finish has a slightly metallic/noble hop twang to it. Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation."
"D- Very easy to drink and great example of style!"
"Poured into a snifter to truly enjoy. Found the beer to be smooth, mildly hoppy, good carbonation, and nicely balanced. However, and it may just be my taste preferences, I found the beer to be moderately boring. Have had much better for the same price."
"i would recommend this beer to anyone that enjoys a good amber ale."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a small white head that left little to no lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is that of sweet malts, caramel, and a slight hop presence. It smelled pretty average for an amber ale. The taste was pretty mild. It was sweet and a bit fruity. There was also a subtle hop flavor. the mouthfeel was decent. It was kind of lighter bodied with low carbonation. The drinkability was good. It went down smooth and was pretty refreshing. Not my favorite beer from Bells by any means, but I think its pretty good. I would drink it again."
"Pours a deep rich looking amber color with a thick off white head and tons of lacing. Smells of a little hop aroma, a little malt, and maybe some vanilla. Tastes much the same with some caramel notes as well. Hops are well balanced to offset the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is great."
"D- Very good beer, one of the better amber's that I have had. Nothing too special but would make an excellent session beer."
"This has some things I love about amber ale and about beer in general. It's complex, it's doing its own thing, and it isn't overpowering you with hops (which I think can be left to IPA). Let me use the word again -- Balance -- you taste the awesome floral hops and even a bit of citrus, but you taste the classic amber malt body too. I'm not going to call it my favorite beer, but it's possibly my favorite amber. Good show!"
"Drinkability - This, all in all, is not a bad little brew. Nice bit of warmth at the end. The beer looks great and is very enticing. I'm glad I gave it a try. It's a brew that I wouldn't have a bit of trouble quaffing for and evening."
"D - Very drinkable, there is nothing remarkable going on here, but the beer is well made and enjoyable. The caramel malt character is particularly well done and makes the beer a touch more interesting. Not a beer to sit and think about, but it would be easy to drink these all night long."
" Goes down easy - very drinkable ."
"Bell's Amber pours surprisingly light for a so called amber ale, much closer to a burnt tangerine. Two fingers of fluffy white head rises up, and then fall by half before holding for a while. Lacing is serviceable, but nothing to write home about. Nose is pretty much devoid of hops, which I guess is to be somewhat expected with an amber that's approaching its ""best by"" date (listed on the Bell's website as six months after bottling), but there's definitely still some caramel and biscuit floating around. The hops are still appreciable on my palate though. The previously mentioned malty flavors lead things off, and a gentle suggestion of bitterness fades into a bitter grapefruit and pine finish. This beer is undoubtedly a bit hoppier fresh, but tastewise I think I like it with a more subdued hop influence. Body is solid, but not overwhelming, though the brisk carbonation is a nice touch. Overall I found myself reaching for synonyms for decent a lot while writing this review, and that's a good way to describe Bell's Amber. It's clearly a well made beer, but one that didn't wow me in any way."
"D- This beer pretty much grew on me at about the half pint mark. I couldn't really drink much of it but I also might have had a bad bottle. I will re-review this beer when I come back to it."
"D - I can actually find six packs of this which is great but since I am more of a stout kind of guy, I really would like more for my dollar. Very nice beer for the variety pack though. Simple and delicious."
"Albeit there should be a slight malt dominance, there is really no hop presence to balance the sweetness."
"This is a good beer. It's highly drinkable and easy to get in my area. Would make a great session beer or gateway to craft beer."
"I'll definitely have to get another bottle of this as this is almost definitely heading down the road to an infection; this is not actually horrible tasting though and is even somewhat enjoyable in its own right. Hopefully Bells is able to clean up this infection as I really like a lot of their beers."
"I don't find this drinkable, and am glad I purchased it a a single."
"Nice slightly off-white head atop a cherrywood coloered, clear beer. Steally carmel malt and pronounced bitter and floral hop aroma. Taste is well balanced interplay of hop bitterness and sweet chewy malt. Nice mouthfeel fits the beers flavor profile and adds to the high drinkability. A great session or six-pack beer."
"Pours amber/muddy red with white misty head. Sweet aroma of grains, sugars, vague peach. Strong flavors of light fruit punch, frosted grains, peaches, acidity, hop dryness comes through in the end but the sweetness overwhelms. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Sugars coat the palate and can get itchy but overall a good beer. One of the best amber ales I've ever had."
"Overall: Very good beer overall and one of the best I've had in the style. I would definitely recommend it. Another solid offering from Bell's."
"Drinkability: One or the whole six pack."
"D- Nothing spectacular but not a bad beer by any means"
"A good, solid offering from Bell's."
"It's actually a very tasty beer that does an excellent job of balancing the right amount of hops with malt. Awesome!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was an easy drinking beer with some nice flavors. Very solid amber ale overall."
"D - Very easy drinker. A bit earthy/malty, but could drink these all night. Not my favorite bells offering, but a good amber none-the-less."
"D: Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from this beer. It's a more than decent, but not anywhere near outstanding. I've had much better brews from Bell's and better amber ales than this. Drinkable, but not recommended."
"D: A solid amber ale, not overhopped and in this style I like that, more in the English bitter realm. We all know Bell's makes some amazing brews, but this a good staple to pay the bills."
"Notes: a very drinkable beer, a beer that you can drink either one of or have an entire six pack of. Either way you cannot go wrong."
"Expectations sometimes get really high with certain breweries. Although I was expecting something explosive, I shouldn't complain too much about this beer."
"This is crispy yet a little chewy along with a slight oily slickness. This makes for a good standby to go to for the American Red Ale genre IMO."
"D: this beer hits all cylinders and can transition across seasons and sessions."
"D: With a nice medium body, this is a nice session beer. Easy drinking brew, that has subtle thickness but still has the crisp freshness."
"Taste-Caramel notes,subtle spiciness, sneaky little hop bite. Creamy, tasty, robust and flavorful, with a sweet/spicy finish. Interesting and very drinkable. Would make a nice session beer or a perfect ""entry-level"" beer for someone interested in trying a craft beer."
"M - Very well balanced. Good CO2. Good drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is very good. Well-rounded beer."
"A restrained, easy-going Amber, which I like in the end. Far better than Bell's Pale Ale. Worth a shot."
"Notes: Very drinkable. The beer is balanced: not too sweet, not too bitter, and certainly not too heavy. I'd drink it again for sure."
"Not a bad brew at all. Very refreshing with lots of flavor. Well worth the money."
"D - One of the best Amber's I've ever had. Definitely coming back"
"Pours a copper/amber, very lightly clouded color with a small white head that settles very slowly. Smell a bit of caramel and sweetness. The malt smell is present, but the smell is nothing to write home about. The taste is pretty much like a typical amber ale. A hoppy taste with a stronger malt presence, with just a bit of grapefruit. The mouthfeel is fairly typical for you average amber ale. The drinkability is very high considering this beer is extremely light and crisp."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours copper with a minimal white head. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was comprised of only subtle hops. The flavor was of small hops and subtle sweet malt. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew was really smooth and was stupidly drinkable. It did not have the greatest flavor and could have been more complex, but it was still enjoyed and was really refreshing."
"D- its really drinkable because its nice and mild, doesn't beat you over the head with hops or mouthfeel. But...its not nearly one of my favorite ambers. Too sweet for my tastes."
"I've always maintained that so-called ""amber ale"" is a catch all style for brewers to throw their own innovative signature into it. This one, although not bad or cheap in any way, disappoints if for nothing more than its ordinaryness. I expected more from this brewer. On the upside the ale is tasty, balanced, properly conditioned and made for sessioning."
"Pours amber of course. Nice malty aroma. Beautiful carbonation really helps the mouthfeel and the balanced taste. Could be my favorite amber that I have ever had. So drinkable!"
"This is pretty light in body, but definitely full flavored. The alcohol stands out a little too much to make this an outstanding session beer, but I wouldn't mind stocking this."
"Hoppy taste, even for Bell's, and definitely for an amber. Makes it more interesting, even if it can be criticized as simply being a hoppier version of a traditional style. Cool with me. A little sweetness from the almost balanced beer. A little oily as well. Not hopped over the top, should appeal to a wide variety of drinkers. I used to think this was a little pricey at 8.99 a 6er, but now everyone charges that it seems."
"D: a great quaffer to pair with food. Less hopped than other ambers, though delicious in its own unique way."
"This is a great Amber Ale, very glad I went with a 6-pack instead of just buying a single."
"I have been drinking this beer since the only way to buy it was to bring your own growler to Larry at the window in the old warehouse. I grew up in Kalamazoo, MI, and it was a happy day for me when I could legally make that stop! The beer has always had a fresh amber taste, medium body and hops, and medium mouthfeel. Never heavy or light, a good, all-round example of amber ale. I used yeast from some of the first brewery bottles that you could buy to brew my first amber ale."
"D: nice full flavor and good balance, good for a session"
"First review: Copper in color, two fingers of head when poured into a room temperature glass. A mild smell, with a pleasant, well balanced flavor and mouth feel with little to no aftertaste. A very good, drinkable American Ale. One of those full flavor very drinkable beers that is not a watered down light but not heavy either."
"This is my first Bells Amber. Pleasantly surprised, I will definitely be picking this up regularly during the cooler months."
"This is still a very drinkable beer. The flavor is strong but not overpowering."
"If it wasn't old I would probably rate it at an a+ because I'm really enjoying it a few weeks old."
"D. Easily a sessionanble amber ale with some great flavor. Definitely gonna pick up a 6er real quick."
"DB - A pretty straight forward amber with a nice malt/hop balance. The light fruits are nice for a change. This one is certainly sessionable but not for me since I only have a six pack from PA. The price was good and the beer was of good quality. I will try more and more Bell's when I start trading or go back to PA."
"Notes: This beer doesn't do anything special for an amber ale, it just does things really well."
"D - Quite drinkable. I would certainly keep this beer in stock for a bbq or a pork chop dinner, maybe even a ham and swiss sandwich with mustard! 4.0"
"Pours copper, hazy with some suspended particles, with thin white head. Aroma is malty, camelly, with a sweet hop character. The flavor is sprightly, light carmel, spiced peach, a little bitter orange. It is refreshing and sweet, yet tart, almost like a good iced tea The mouthfeel is slick and prickly."
"This is a highly sessionable brew."
"Notes: A great beer. I am glad it was recommended to me by my local bottle shopman. I have been on an amber ale kick and find that I enjoy the balance between hops and malt. This beer is very drinkable, yet needs to be enjoyed, so sip slowly, or make sure you have a six pack."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Good carbonation and doesnt overwhelm the palate. It tickles the tongue and has a weight to it but allows you to sample other beers afterward."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a thin head which gives way to some lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt and caramel malt with a hint of citrus hops. The taste has a malt backbone, sweet malt and caramel malt with some breadiness, which has a backend taste of citrus hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. The drinkability is good, for an amber it has a nice flavor and is complex enough to keep you interested. One you will want more than a couple of."
"This one pours a deep yellow with a huge fluffy white head. Smells of yeast and more yeast. Tastes of yeast and not much else. Not a bad flavor, but out of balance. I'd have preferred to have a bit of malt in there. Not a bad beer, but I've had better ones in this style."
"Smells of sweet malts. First sip is that of a scotch ale in its overall malty sweetness. In fact, can be considered the majority flavor. However, this is by no means a detriment to the beer itself. This beer is a tasty brew, with a deep and complex malty flavors. A real pallet pleaser."
"A solid, yet not outstanding offering from Bells."
"It's okay, but I prefer ambers with a bit more body and hops."
"D: Very drinkable brew. I would've had more but so many more brews here to try and on TAP!"
"D: Very drinkable, ABV less than expected and even with the shortfall in the hops department I could easily drink more than a couple"
"Overall a very good, drinkable beer."
"A crisp, slightly floral amber full of round malty notes and a mild hop finish. It pours a classic caramel color with a moderate white head that develops into a light lacing by the halfway mark. Not the most interesting beer I've sampled, but it's smooth and supremely drinkable. A nice local discovery for this born and bred Bostonian who now calls the Midwest home."
"Pours an amber color with a moderate white head. Taste and aroma are both malty with a slight fruitiness (banana, citrus) and a slightly buttery/toffee character. Generous carbonation which lends to a very clean, crisp mouthfeel. Very easy drinking. Not a world beater, IMO, but a well crafted and enjoyable beer."
"A good solid drinking beer that exemplifies the style."
"Highly recommended for those times when you wanna drink some awesome beer that you don't need to put too much thought into."
"I got this from mrkanable in a trade. I poured from a 12 ounce glass into a standard pint glass. It is amber/orange in color with a moderate white head, a bit of lacing. The aroma is malt forward, sweet and roasty. The flavors a sweet breadish, a lingering sweet finish. A good all around beer that would pair well with most foods."
"One of the better Bell's offerings that I have had. This is a top notch Amber. Highly recommended."
"This is by far one of the best ambers I have had, and the only disappointing part was when it was finished."
"D- Really good drinkability. I could drink this beer all night. The lower ABV coupled with a well-balanced aroma and flavor lead to a really good beer."
"I got about a quarter to half-inch thick head that seems to be planning to stick around for good, or at least until I'm through with the beer. The bottle shows the ABV as 5.8%; not too bad, definitely sessionable. There's a little over a hint of an alcoholic taste coming through, nothing to fuss about. The body is a solid medium, appropriate to the degree of sweet malts. Every bar in the country should have this brew available. I really stand behind this beer, not just in defense of microbreweries and the culture of better beer, but for the fact that it is extremely drinkable, and could definitely be appreciated by the most close-minded, light beer aficionado. Bell's Amber Ale should serve as the gateway brew to better beer for the lowest common denominator of beer drinkers."
"by far, one of the best amber ales I've had, the balance and intensity of the flavors really makes this one unique."
"Served: in an imperial pint glass."
"The taste is pretty good, overall very drinkable for an amber ale."
"poured form the bottle to a pint glass nice head that stayed till the last sip, laced my glass and had a rich-golden brown color, there was quite a bit of sediment in floating around. smelled of malt all the way. Just the way it smelled, this ale tasted of malt with just enough bitter to balance out the sweetness. over all i enjoyed this beer and could easily knock a few back."
"Cheers."
"Absolute session beer here. I could make a night of this. Really well crafted beer that's available year round which is a bonus."
"Poors a nice reddish brown but not too dark. Decent sized head that mostly disappears but leaves spots of lacing. Smells sweet and malty with hints of caramel and molasses. Taste is sweet up front with malt and sugar. Back end is only slightly bitter. Carbonation and viscosity are great. Very drinkable but maybe a tad too sweet to drink a lot of this. Enjoyable brew."
"orange-copperish color with a thick head. Aroma has some sweet maltiness to it. Taste is a perfect mix of bitter and sweet. Initially a sweet malt taste with some hints of nuts and caramel, but by the time you finish, the hops kick in so the beer is not overly sweet. Only downside is that the taste could have been a bit stronger. Body was a good thickness. A bit on the expensive side compared to what else was available, but still cheap enough to be an any week beer."
"As always, I find myself impressed with Bells, and wishing it were easier to get in Massachusetts."
"D-This one is a personal favorite. I love a solid amber and this is definitely a fine amber. Very easy-drinking session beer."
"Drinkability: Great by the books amber. Shines high in it's category and proves how Bell's is one of America's finest breweries."
"Would be good with a steak. Beyond that, is there much of a reason this would be sitting in my fridge? Not so much. There are many other Bell's offerings I would rather drink."
"A very easy drinker, tasty and simple. Nothing to write home about, but a solid session beer for sure. My first Bell's beer, I'll try more of their offerings soon."
"Light medium body with carbonation right where it should be. Lightly sweet up front with a dry, crisp finish. This is very easy to drink with no off-flavors. Definitely enjoyed this more as I worked my way through it. A solid example of the style."
"pors a beautiful amber color as it should right? its perfect for the style it has a bready sweet malt caramel and hop smell ..the taste is sweet malts and bready spices with some nice hops and grass and citrus tastes..this is a really good amber it has a lot of nice tastes and flavors going for it.. it is highly drinkable and very flavorful a session brew ..i like this one..they say it is their flagship beer"
"D: Absolutely a session beer. This is the kind of brew I would (and will!) pass along to my craft-light/non-craft compatriots, but also drink a good bit myself. Another fantastic offering from Bell's."
"D- Very drinkable beer, teetering on the edge of a session beer, definitely makes me want another."
"D: I am happy to re-review this beer, and hopefully I'll get the chance to try it on tap someday. But I will not go out of my way to seek another bottle out."
"Very hop forward with a nice caramel malt backbone and slight crisp fruit. The hops dominate this beer and linger all the way through over the malt backbone and subtle light fruit notes in to a bitter dry finish."
"D - Pretty easy to get down, the bite at the end gives this beer a little bit of character."
"D: Easy to drink, but not a flavor profile that makes me want another right away. Don't get me wrong -- I like it and would be great to drink another, just not something I'm craving"
" ~ This is a good beer that can be consumed easily. I recommend it to all."
"Feel: Moderate"
"Soft easy drinker with pleasant malt balance."
"D - As already said, beer is very smooth and refreshing. Great beer for all occasions! Not too wild/crazy in variation to its style."
"Poured a yeast cloudy, medium amber with a one finger head that faded to a collar. The aroma was sweet. The taste was malty sweet, slightly smoky. No bitter aftertaste. I like it for it's subtle, not over-powering taste. Feel is light bodied with little carbonation. The drinkability is good."
"Drinkability: This was a beer I grew to like more and more as I sipped my way through it. At first I thought it would be OK for an occasional beer, but as I finished the beer I came realize it is nicely drinkable. I'll definitely seek this beer out for a few more before I decide if I'd be willing to drink it though out an evening of good food and good conversation with friends. However my suspicion at the moment is that I'll like it better and better the more I have it."
"Overall, a solid beer. This is a beer I've passed up in stores since...well...ever, and that may have to change. Good stuff."
"Drinkable brew - this was my first Bell beer, and I'd be interested in sampling some of the other varietals whould I get the opportunity."
"I bought a 6-pack for the amazingly low price of $4!!! The taste is really growing on me and each one is getting better. I've had this on tap and it seems better in the bottle, but very similar."
"This beer pours a hazy deep toffee color with a thick white head that recedes rapidly leaving minimal spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is primarily of caramel and toffee malts, with a touch of citrus hops. Taste falls in line with the nose, many layers of malts to it - caramel, toffee, with some roasted malts mixed in here, finish has a bit of a fruity sweetness and bite to it. Medium body, low carbonation, smooth and creamy with a bit of a chewiness to it. Easily a sessionable beer."
"This is an excellent beer...it really is. It is drinkable, and has just the right balance to make this beer stand out."
"D - Pretty much what an amber should be nothing crazy going on but thats not a bad thing a good drinkable beer"
"Drinks bigger than it is. I would probably go for other browns before this one."
"Drinkability: Very good beer. This is certainly something that I could drink on regular basis."
"Drinkability is great. This is an above average American Amber Ale, and focuses more on the malt profile than the hops."
"I find this very drinkable and yet different than most Ambers. Seems like a spring or summer Amber beer. Could be a great gateway beer."
"This brew poured into a pint glass has a hazy orange color (not red like I would expect from an amber) with very visible carbonation rising from the bottom and a decent white head that caps well. It is warm out so I am really looking forward to tasting this, but first the smell... actually a nice hop aroma on this. There is a sweet floral taste to this leaning towards the end of a IPA. I enjoy the flavor but am not sure if it is completely true to the style. Good brew for me, but might catch some by surprise."
"Bell's Amber Ale is a good session beer, as it manages to stay drinkable while packing in a lot flavor."
"a simply style that is always hard to rate for me yet so easy to drink...this brew is one of the better ambers that I've had to date...it's no Cindercone, but a good one nonetheless. Way to go Bell's!"
"Bells usually makes a good product, this is not one of it's best. This is a ""recommend slightly""."
"Poured from a bottle, the head dissolved at a medium pace. Left little to no lacing on the glass. Looks are as one would expect an amber to appear, nice orange glow unfiltered with lots of little particles hanging out doing their thing at the bottom of the glass. Smells malty, and low and behold so is the taste. Its malty sweetness is the first thing picked up with little carbination with bits of bitterness bringing in the rear. Drinkability is smooth and easy going, I like it."
" Don't get me wrong though, this is a far superior amber ale when compared to Budweisers'."
"Poured on tap into a pint glass, pours a rustic redish amber with a a bit of head that leaves minimal lace on the glass. Smell has that sweet hoppy smell with a bit of bread and clove. This beer has a taste of sweet bread with a nice malt tone and some nice earth hop flavor in there, very well balanced and the drinkability is high on this fine product. Overall a regular that I go to and a nice session beer."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of ambers, but this one is a pretty drinkable example of one."
"Pours a hazy, amber/orange color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight fruit aroma from yeast, and some brown sugar. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight hops, and some fruity flavors. Overall, a really good blend of flavors and a great drinkability."
"Drinkability is good, although the bitter finish could get old for some (including myself)."
"Had this on Cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus, Pa. Perfect two finger head and smells of roasted grains and caramel. Taste is so crisp and slightly malty. FANTASTIC!!! Mouthfeel is incredible and so much better than in bottle form. This is a session beer for sure!!! Bell's is no doubt an incredible craft brewer that the USA can be proud of! Well Done!!!"
"drinkability- wasn't impressed for a brand i've been waiting for. not much of a defining flavor"
"Comes out of the tap a hazy dark honey-amber with a thin but fine-bubbled off-white head. Appetizing malty aroma has fruity and hoppy hints. Thick, malty flavor has a hoppy undertone and a touch of banana. Texture is thick, smooth and fizzy. Definitely worth seeking."
"Pours a amber tinted brown, or I should say copper tinted red, with good carbonation although the head dies quick. Caramel malts on top of floral hops; textbook red ale smell. A lighter bodied red, the hops are rather subdued as this beer passes smoothly and slickly over the tongue, leaving off sweet malt tastes as it goes does. Caramel and roasted/toasted malts mostly, along with some other bitter sweet (chocolate) vibes are balanced (not evenly) with citric hops and the beer finishes w/ a crisp, hoppy backbite. This is a very good red anyone should try, but for some reason it seemed a tad for me. Coulda just been one of those days."
"Pours out hazy, kind of golden, definitely not amber in my opinion, maybe copper at best. A massive head sits on top, and is slow to collapse, but still the color is getting me. I want to see more red/amber colors. The smell is of biscuit, bread very full, a bit of sweetness. Great maltiness in this one. Then there is this orange smell, with some resinous hops, bitter citrus rind. The taste really kind of stands out. There is a really pleasant tart cherry taste which I like, a great maltiness, thick and bready, kind of a powdery dry bread, like crackers. Then a herbal, leafy finish of hops. This is a bit like a soda, but I'm loving it. The fruitiness is very nice. I wish it were just a bit more beery. The taste is a little watery, less than impressive, particularly for a style than can be built up to be quite malty. The carbonation is nice, though. An enjoyable beer. I'd recommend it, though I'd also recommend a few improvements on this one - namely in color and mouthfeel. This one is very easy to drink and pleasant."
"Overall - A fine beer worth trying, but not one I will revisit any time soon. It was not particularly good or interesting."
"Drinkability: Session. I love this new Bells beer we're getting here in SC."
"Drinkability - If priced right this could be a definite go to beer."
"Tasty and refreshing-sweet yet quenching and nice overall balance. More? Yes, please. Perfect for a warm spring day!"
"a very refreshing beer...nice balance...goes down way too easy"
"D: Superior to lots of amber ales out there and one I'd gladly enjoy again."
"I'm pretty sure Amber Ale is Bell's Flagship beer. It's not a great beer, but it is good. I'd prefer a little more hops. They'd add some zeal that it currently lacks. Other than that, the nose is a tad weak and a bit more body would be good. Truth be told, those modifications might just turn it into an animal that it's not intended to be. As it is, it's a nice session beer with a pretty good flavor. As easy as it is to forget sometimes, those have a place in this world."
"D - Excellent stuff. Simple but extremely flavorful and drinkable. A solid beer without hitting any extremes, worthy of having on any occasion."
"D- Nice, clean, and refreshing. Interesting flavor with a decent amount of complexity. Balanced pretty well."
"D: Excellent year-round offering from Bell's--for the most part, Larry and the crew can simply do no wrong."
"I poured into a pint glass to little head. It is reddish orange in color with some cloudiness. It smells sweet. The taste is surprisingly nice, citrus and malt. It is quite refreshing after the previous two ambers that I have tried this weekend. I could enjoy a few of these."
"D- An easy going amber ale that packs just the slightest punch, but is a good choice for almost any occasion."
"D- Decent drinkability but not my favorite. Taste could be better"
"D - Another solid brew from Bell's...I really liked how well rounded this beer was...I could drink this beer all day"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange color with a fluffy tan head. Sweet malty smell and no discernable hops smell. After drinking Nugget Nectar and Hopback within the week, I was fairly dissapointed with this one. I know Bell's has been touted as having some great beers, but this one just doesn't do it for me."
"A great brew and a great option for a sessional."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This would be a great summer beer for me. I've had better examples of the style, but this would have to be the most sessionable one that I've tried. It's really more of an Amber/Wheat if you ask me. Try one and see."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, would make a good session beer."
"Drinkability: With apologies to Nugget Nectar, I think I may have just found my favorite version of this style. Perfectly drinkable this beer seems made for me and may have been my favorite from my Philadelphia trip. An awesome mix of malt and hops. I could easily session this...Now if only Bells would ship to Massachusetts."
"A dark amber with huge chunks of particles flowing throughout. Head is initially strong but quickly dissipates, but allows for nice lacing while drinking. Sweet malts are present in the nose as well as in the mouth. Nice mix between sweet malts and bitter hoppyness. At 5.8% ABV its very drinkable, and a great year round session beer for people who are lucky enough to locate Bell's beer easily."
"Whipped milkshake in appearance head or off-white color, dense micro-bubbles, touch of stringy lacing. Murky glow to the bronzed orange to red brick color, holds the light inside of it nicely and retains hue fully to the rims. Crisp, almost forceful, nose without ever seeming exaggerated, rye and wheat with a touch of pumpernickel, steady lowgrade mixed citrus notes, apricot, nectarine and mango fruit scents without the excess juiciness, too erect to be smooth or creamy, same for bitter, just smells like an unadorned beer. Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation, however, unveils itself at a slow pace. More of a thick skeleton than dense flesh, tangerine and mandarin orange citrus along with floral tea scents come out first. Then the apricot, peach fruit, less tropical here in the mouth. The breadiness is fully baked with a thick crust. The malts never rise over a certain basic presence. The hops don't take advantage, content to stay in proportion to the former. Definitely a beer best imbibed as a whole rather than considered in its constituent parts."
"Good stuff..."
"Smooth feel, heavier than expected. Probably slightly heavier than medium body. Creamy texture, and appropriately carbonated. Very sessionable."
"This beer fits into a particular style that I enjoy, on the spectrum of amber ales this could almost lean towards that of an Oktoberfest. Almost."
"Drinkability- Excellent beer to have around the house, well balanced and refreshing. Probably a great session beer."
"From the tab, I get a slightly darker than amber cloudy beer with a fine off-white creamy head that sticks around for a bit. There is slightly toasted caramel and hint of hops in the nose, all slightly subdued. A big chewy somewhat-sweet caramel flavor greets me on the first taste. The finish is a bit subdued, nothing to write home about."
"mid body. coats the mouth. good carbonation. i like this beer. i will buy again. could be a session beer for me."
"Bell's Amber Ale pours an amber color with a medium head. The smell is of light malts and nothing else. The taste is weak with some malt and very little hops in the mix. This is a beer that I had high expectations for but was let down in the end. It's drinkable, but that's about it. There just ain't a whole lot of flavor goin' on here. I look foward to trying some of Bell's other offerings. This amber ale will not be purchased again."
"Fairly light bodied but not thin by any means. A good drinking beer that I would definitely go back to if it was not bed time."
"A thank you to deliriumfest for our recent trade (the first of about 30) which gave me the opportunity to try this beer. Bell's Amber is a quite good amber with a fresh full feel and a balanced earthy flavor. The color is spot on for an amber, whatever that means, but the head dissipated quickly and left little lacing in my DFH glass. The smell is bready and full of caramel malt. The flavor strikes an interesting balance between spicy, earthy hops and doughy, sweet malt. The feel is thicker and fuller than expected. It's rather chewy. There's some apple or raisin note in the background. Bell's Amber Ale is an enjoyable, sessionable and solid beer. Quick edit: I'm actually going to bump my taste score up a half notch. The malt flavor is really growing on me."
"Pours a nice copper color with some good head and nice lacing, and a fair bit of lacing. Good sweet scent, hints of rice, sugar, and caramal, along with a great tart aroma; the scent reminds me more of an Irish red than an American red. The taste, though, is more American; though there is a bit of Irish tart, it's mostly a great blend of malts and hops, sweet at first with a nice hit of bitterness as you finish each drink. Gets better with each taste. Goes down very smooth, if a bit overcarbonated. Excellent beer."
"D- SESSION BEER. This one fits the mold for me. It's got enough taste to satisfy, but a low enough abv. where your not tripping after two!"
"Cloudy translucent orange with minimal white head and little lacing. Aroma is floral, perfumy, and malty. Taste follows the nose. Reminiscent of spring flowers with a light spicey malt backbone. Carbonation is present in the body. Light, effervescent and sweet. A pleasant beer, but nothing special."
"Drinkability: I'd give it a solid 4 on this - it's not overwhelming and the lower ABV makes it easy to get through them. It's not an especially heavy beer either so I don't feel weighted down by it."
"Bell's was one of the first craft brewers in the U.S. and the first in the Midwest (at least they claim to be), and this beer helped define the American Amber style. I think still one of the best. Like I said I haven't had it in years, but having tasted it again it will be a staple from now on. Truly exemplary."
"D-This would be a great session brew; its smooth flavor and ease of drinking makes it so. Complexity isn't necessarily high, but the quality of the characters that this beer has is good."
"Drinkability: Very high and would pair well with a lot of different foods."
"12 oz bottle. Light red pour, whitish head. Sweet malt, some pine aromas. Malt and toffee flavors throughout, little raisin or something green fruit. Nice bittering hops through the finish. Well balanced and drinkable, but nothing outstanding. There are some pale ale tones in this one, which some will find off putting. One of Bell's more sessionable ales. Also pretty equal on draft or bottle."
"Overall- Very good, so easy to drink. Sweet like candy, my pint was empty in less than 10 minutes."
"Taste: It's just a damn good amber ale. Bitterness and hop flavors are dominant. Seems more bitter from the bottle than when I had it on-tap."
"I bought this beer because I never got to visit the brewery as I had planned when home in Chicago over Christmas. I should have assumed based on who referred Bell's to me that it would be hoppy. I'll be sure to avoid any pale ale's from that direction, but I wouldn't refuse this beer if offered again."
"Smells of red licorice and a slight bit of butterscotch. Pours to a slightly red light brown color with a multi-sized bubble head. Taste is again some red licorice, beer laces nicely on the glass. Very well balanced ale. Great body, silky smooth mouthfeel. Taste is neither sweet nor bitter, but both. A little more malty in the front end and slightly more bitter at the finish. Not overly bitter, though with malts coming through tarty at the very end. Very drinkable, tasty brew."
"Pours a beautiful hazy amber, full of fine particles gently suspended mid-body. A small tan head to top it off. Aromas are subtle but extremely good. Sweet drizzly malts like molasses and citrus hops. The taste is stunningly good. Perfectly balanced; complex malts with flavors ranging from tropical fruit to toffee, toasty goodness backed by equally complex hops that span the floral spectrum and with a touch of oranges. Extremely tasty. Medium body is sticky; its flavors linger long. I could become a evangelist for this brew. Exceptionally good taste in an eminently drinkable beer."
"Pours a good sized head, and it is lasting. Head color is creamy, white, with small bubbles. Has a very malty aroma, but not too strong. A sweet malty taste, Fat Tire/Newcastle-ish. Very malty, not a very balanced malt taste, not as much hops."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a bubbly white head that shows some staying power. Smells of caramel and dough, mild citrus hops in the background. Taste has much of the same with a more pronounced hop bite. Sweet malts mix up a grainy, caramel, bready taste. Citrus Herbal hops play a supporting role. Sweet sticky syrupy in the mouth, medium body crisp carbonation. Good little session ale, nothing spectacular, but definitely drinkable."
"A good amber ale. This is a balanced, very tasty and drinkable ale, light but full of character with subtle complexity. It's caramelly, doughy, and toasty with lightly toasted bread and light, caramel malty sweetness balanced with mostly citrus hops."
"Taste again brings the malt sweetness to the forefront. Sugary, busicuity maltiness greets the tongue, almost want to say there is a touch of maple syrup splashed in among the caramel sweetness and slightly toasted aspects of this beer as well. A soft, estery hop profile lingers in the background and only gives off seblances of bitterness. The only thing that really bugs me about this beer is that it tends to get a little grainy near and into the finish. A new sip is needed to clense this away but after each one, more and more of this taste tends to linger and brings down the overall enjoyment factor for me in the end."
"D - Reasonably quenching, but not exciting. Not sure why this is the Bell's flagship beer. I remembered it as the least impressive of the mixed case I had last year and it's setting itself up for a repeat this year. When Bud makes a beer like this I'm impressed; coming from Bell's it's just disappointing."
"date consumed: 10 Dec 2008"
"D= I like this beer a lot in the bottle and I liked it even more on tap. Very drinkable and quite sessionable, especially with food."
"Drinkability is very good, this is one of my favorite of this style and if I am in the market for an American Amber, I would go here."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: I would easily buy this beer again. It's a nice beer when you don't feel like blasting your mouth with hops yet want something that is not overpoweringly sweet. It has nice complexity yet is simple and refined at the same time."
"great drinkability."
"Very nice looking beer. Deep amber color, thin film of beige head, light lacing, looks like some sort of sediment suspended. Thick in the mouth. Smells slightly earthy and sweet. I now wish I had bought more than a six pack."
"Biscuity right up front and back-loaded with citrus hops. Outstanding balance of soft brown sugar-sweet malt with a crisp, controlled finishing bitterness."
"It was an easy drinking light bodied Amber Ale, but it was a little too peppery for me. It would have better if they would have decreased the peppery flavors and increased the malts a little bit. Just a decent offering from a great brewery."
"D- Very drinkable. Hoppy, but not overdone with a nice malty balance. Very sessionable at 5.5% ABV."
"D: Would like to try it on tap sometime. And maybe try it before having two others. Will definitely get again"
"trade via brentk56"
"Overall - This is a smooth and refreshing ale. Light in taste, but not watery or weak in character."
" I love the way this glows in my glass,kind of a copper penny color,kind of a thin white head but I poured it pretty carefully,dont want to spill any eh. Smells of sweet roasted malt, bread,toast,and mild hops,Taste,Oh my gosh is this stuff good, I could drink myself into a stooper every night on this stuff.Flavors of sweet malt and hops with kind of a sweet woody finish like candy,could I have another please ? THANK YOU Mr BELL."
"Pretty sweet with some mild hop bitterness, not much body to this beer, near the end it started tasting really bland and just bitter, no sweetness, but overall not a good beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: I truly enjoyed this beer. I can drink a few of these. It is a easy drinking beer. You will enjoy it."
"The taste is similar, mostly malty with some hops to round it out and balance it nicely. It's caramelly, doughy, and toasty with lightly toasted bread and light, caramelly malty sweetness balanced with mostly citrusy hops that have a light leafiness. The citrus has a clear hint of grapefruit but this is just barely prominent. It also has a light juiciness and hint of yeastiness. It has a slightly creamy feel but a crisp finish. It is light, but has complexity, good, lasting flavour, nice balance, and a defintie English quality overall. It is highly drinkable."
"Notes: Nice, light amber. True to style and very drinkable."
"I could definitely drink a few of these in a sitting."
"6/4/7/4/15 (3.6/5)"
"I poured this yummy beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees which was too cold. The beer was cloudy most likely cause it was cold. It was a pretty copper color with a nice big head. The smell was malty and of caramel and so was its taste. The beer had great lacing and this is another winner from Bell's I will buy again for sure."
"A nice amber, though not up to par with the rest of this brewery's beers. Aroma was all caramel malt. Pour was a nice cloudy amber with no head. Taste was all caramel malt with barely any hops to balance out the sweetness. Little carbonation. Bell's makes some outstanding beers. This is just decent."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle with an amber color with maybe a tint of red. It is sweet smelling and the taste had some nutty and caramel tones. I really enjoyed the smoothness of this Ale with a nice aftertaste. Had a couple more to confirm my liking to this one."
"A friend from work brought me this beer that he bought in St. Louis, it isn't usually available in New Orleans. Thanks dude!! This is the kind of beer I really like."
"M/D - Medium bodied. Very easy to drink due to the maltyness. Great brew to keep in the fridge."
"Medium bodied with good drinkability. This would be a great gateway beer for someone looking to get into craft beer. Good flavor, but highly sessionable."
"This is an extremely drinkable amber, in fact it is my favorite Amber I have ever had!"
"Not really much to say on this one. Thin and weak don't make a great amber ale."
"D- a great example of the style. no wonder this is bells flagship beer. easy to have a couple, but probably no more than that before i wanted something else. check this one out."
"Pours a foggy amber-brown with a two finger khaki colored head that sticks around for quite a while. A good layer of webbing clings to the sides of the glass. Smell is musty pale malts with a good caramel sweetness. A faint pine hop tickles the nose with an oak aroma as well. Creamy caramel up front on the tongue with roasted malts and some nuttiness. Midway, grains and bread emerge with a subtle pine hop that balances this out quite well. Aftertaste is sweet and a touch woody. Mosty smooth feel and light to medium body with a mild sting from the carbonation. Bell's makes some of the best beers out there and this is not to be overlooked. A solid ale that is very flavorful and drinkable, a combination that I'd like to experience more often. I've said it before and I'll say it again, we need Bell's in NY!!!"
"Nice carbonation keeps the mouthfeel full and excellent balance makes this extremely drinkable."
"The smell is quite sweet. The most noticable scent is malt. Almost a caramelly sweetness. Taste follows the smell, although not as sweet tasting as the smell. The hops balance the sweetness a bit better than the smell suggests. Overall, it is a very very strong Amber Ale selection."
"Slight sweet hints of sweet carmel malts with hoppy undertones. Very smooth and slightly sweet maltiness was first flavor followed by smooth balancing hoppiness. Finished smooth and was very drinkable. A very approachable Amber ale that is neither too hoppy or too malty. Very nice and balanced."
"I was expecting more flavor from this beer. Really, the malts are just light caramel and there's just a slight spicy hop note in the aftertaste. Yes, it's very drinkable and not really bland, but it's boring. It just sort of smells and tastes like a generic Amber Ale. There's nothing distinguishing."
"This stuff is really drinkable. I only bought a single, but I might have to get a sixer sometime in the near future. Bell's is my favorite brewery, and they've definitely got a winner with their flagship beer. Kickass stuff."
"this starts out with sweet carmal malt then gets a tuch sour befor finishing with a mild hop flavor, this one also has a fair amount of yeast to it that makes it heaverer and cloudy. this is a nice beer that drinks smooth, this isn't my stile of choise but for a stile i dont care for, this is a deacent repersation."
"Discovered at an obscure little airport cafe in Minneapolis this brew poured a cloudy amber color with a modest light tan head and outstanding lace. The aroma was mild roasted malts and peanut butter toffee. The taste was crisp grassy hops and sour malt, medium body, melon hints and a good peppery bite on the tongue. Not my favorite Bells but a good quality brew none the less."
"With all Bell's beer they are unfiltered and every batch seems to be slightly unique. The website allowed me to know that this batch was bottled almost 7 months ago."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. This beer had a nice fluffy, off white colored head. The color was very awesome, fading from a light orange to an amber orange at the top. I can definately taste that this beer is almost a year old and it makes me sad that I didn't get to enjoy the full potentials of Bell's. The beer tasted very skunked, so I am going to stop my review here and when I get a chance to try an ""up to date"" bottle, then I will write a new review."
"Overall I was once again impressed by Bell's. Hopefully they'll make their way to GA soon. Until then I'll seek them out anytime I can get my hands on them."
"this beer pours a nice clear amber with a thin pale head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. the nose is surprisingly full. not sure why i'm surprised, but i am. citrus notes and floral notes abound in the nose. some faint malt notes as well. the taste is agressive but pleasing. this is really a full flavored amber ale. much tastier than i was expecting, consistent with the nose. the mouthfeel is what i expect from an amber ale and i could drink these all night."
"D- Definitely sessionable."
"Mild malt aroma. Light amber color with a medium thin head, some lacing present. Smooth on the palate with an easy finish. Good flavor kind of boring especially from Bell's. There was a subtle creamy sweet malt presence and the beer is lightly hopped. Nothing great about this ""flagship"" beer but easily drinkable and pleasant."
"Typical 12 ounce bottle, w/o pours typical lighter amber, clear, light tan head, showing better then average retention and then leaving decent frothy lace on the glass. Faint malty, honey nose. Malty brew, smooth and balanced. Middle of the road style, and certainly not my favorites but this one is better then the rest. Balance is the central theme. Fine sessioner."
"I was surprised I hadn't tried this one from Bell's yet so I picked up a single and I must say it's quite good. It's not the best ever, but it's very sessionable. It's a very well balanced beer and I think someone who is at the beginning stages of the journey to becoming a hophead might really enjoy this as it's not too bitter but does have a certain kick to it."
"Mouthfeel is clean and smooth, drinks easy."
"Poured a deep amber color with an average off white head, kinda rocky. Nose was malt, hops and that was about all I could take from it. Well hopped and well balanced, smooth. Something was different with the malts, caramel malts and maybe some English malts. Not like most Ambers I had tasted but ok nevertheless."
"Drinkability: Clean and drinkable. Unremarkable though. Still a good choice for an amber ale if you're looking for one."
"This reminded me a lot of the lager, which people have rated lower, but with more of the same. Different from the masses, I really liked the lager (and its malt) but did not care for the amber. The amber is fuller and better balanced, but not special, for me. I did think it was a good beer, however, just not as good as others from Bell's. Maybe if it were more red, more hops, it would be a winner for me."
"Could drink these all night long."
"D- Easy to drink just not a whole lot going on."
"Good, good beer1"
""
"Well made, but just a basic malty red ale. Nothing wrong with having an approachable beer in your lineup, but it probably shouldn't have gobs of yeast floating in it. My wife will enjoy drinking the rest of the 6-pack, as this sort of beer is right up her alley."
"D: A really well put together amber. It is a rich and complex beer that comes together nicely."
"Fantastic Amber ale. Poured a huge head in my scooner and lasted till the last drop. Aroma of flowery hops pineapple and as it warms brown sugar. More on the sweet side and could use a bit more bittering hops. When it warms the flavor takes on a more dark malt taste. Overall just awesome for the style."
"I will need to revisit this beer again, and the aftertaste I am experiencing right now makes me with I had another. The beer is light to medium bodied, so I could easily see this being a session beer."
"Before tasting the Rush River Amber, I might have said ""Yeah, it's boring, but all Ambers are."" Turns out that's not the case. So although this is tasty, I'd probably turn elsewhere in the future."
"Bells Amber pours a slightly hazy orange brown color with a monster of an off white head. Some visible sticking and slow rising carbonation. The nose doesnt jump out at you, i gather a semi sweet earthy/fruity nose with hints of malt subtleties. Nice toasty caramel malty taste. Other tasting notes include burnt wood, rust, cherry, apple and a slight hop bitterness/citrus character. The burnt malt/grainy aftertaste lingers and its probably its weakest point. Its mouth feel on the other hand is definitely its strong point. Perfect carbonation with a medium/light body. I dunno, i wasn't crazy about this one, maybe a bad bottle, maybe im just expecting more out of this brewery, i mean come on HopSlam is nothing short of a work of art. Bells Amber is by no means a bad beer but for its style there are better choices, available in NJ or else where."
"This was my first beer @ Bell's last night. Seeing as it is their flagship beer I might as well give it a shot. I was impressed and delighted, especially after I had tried the Amber ale from another local brewery a few days ago and I could BARELY finish it. This poured a golden copper and had a slight head. The smell was nice and hinted to a great beer. The flavor was complex yet refreshing with hints of many great ingredients. The mouthfeel was nice and its certainly a beer I could see myself relaxing on the deck drinking a 6'er"
"D - I hate to repeat myself but these are just so ""crisp"" that I could see myself drinking this as a session beer. Really enjoyable and not too heavy, more light to medium bodied. After further thought I wanted to add that I think this would be a good beer to introduce someone into the world of craft beers."
"Taste is pale malty and sweet, with snappy carbonation, a tame minerally bitterness, and a little caramel in the finish. Underwhelming, but light and refreshing."
"D: Superb, very drinkable, definitely my new favorite session beer during the summer"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, this is a straight-forward beer with some good substance that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D-Mouthfeel of this beer probably makes it pretty drinkable. However, I am not a big enough fan of the taste to turn this into a session beer."
"Very nice, I would look for it in a pub."
"This pours a dark amber color with a nice head. Smells of sweet malts, with some toffee tones. Tastes pretty good. It has a delicate malty toastiness to it, with a bit of spiciness/pepper taste, and followed by a touch of hops. This is a pretty good amber ale and I definitely enjoyed it."
"I could drink a few, but my need for hops would make me switch"
"Pours a beautiful amber with a frothy foam head with nice lacing from a 12 ounce bottle. Smells of sweet malt with some citrus hop hiding nicely in the background. Taste is smooth sweet malt with some toasty grain and excellent hop balance. Perfectly carbonated and crisp with sweet malt and nice mellow hop balance. Very nice on the tongue. Drinkability is great, very nice amber. probably the best amber ale i have ever had. i could drink several of these. The cool thing is I took a chance with these and bought a whole 6-pack because they were bottle conditioned I figured there was a chance they could be decent. And I am pleasantly surprised! I love it when this happens! Like i said probably the best amber i have ever had. 5 more to go... CHEERS!"
"A delicious copper colored ale with a hearty malt flavor that goes down smooth as water.Nice aftertaste and no carbonation gives an enjoyable experience from the moment it hits your tongue to the moment it hits your stomach.Highly recommended I will be buying this ale again!!!!"
"Pours a murky amber in color, medium head with spots of lacing. Smell is good and balanced but all I think is buttered bread and toasted caramel. Some grain and light hops. Very delicate and balanced taste. A brief hint of bitterness up front but this is more of a malted amber. Toasted bread and light grain with some sweetness. Good earthy, light citrus hops. Smooth, lightly crisp but almost doughy mouthfeel. Carbonation level keeps it from becoming creamy or full. The hops keep this brew in check but malt flavor is the winner. Very drinkable, session amber. A vacation from the hopped up trend of ambers that seems to be going on, I like it."
"The aroma is nice, sweet with a faint hoppy smell. I detect some small pepper aroma and also citrus orange. The taste is very good, well blended malts and hops. The hops come into play at the tail end but are well received. The flavor also has a little pepper kick to it. The MF is medium bodied and very flavorful. Very good."
"D-Pretty high on the drinkability scale.This may be the best american amber I've had,usually a boring style in my opinion."
"Very drinkable, wish I had bought a few more."
"All around good amber ale. I would definitely revisit this one in the future."
"Batch 8274, poured a very cloudy amber/copper with a thick, foamy head. It had a pretty strong malty and slightly floral smell. The taste is more of the same--a pretty strong malty flavor with a slightly bitter finish. Overall this one is a pretty drinkable beer. Not too bad at all."
"Overall: A solid American Red. The taste is pretty solid and it is very drinkable. An Amber loving buddy of mine raves about it on draft."
"Drinkability is excellent. I could definitely session this brew and be satisfied. I'll definitely be drinking this one again."
"D-Smooth, nice and malty w/adequate hops to balance. Very enjoyable. I love Bell's."
"A great American amber. I've had bad luck with this style before - they're either too sweet or too bland or too something, but this one is excellently balanced, very robust, and very drinkable. Check it out."
"drinkablility is great. this is a rich and complex brew that has an excellent profile and a mellow finish. the flavors work well to create a complete profile, with a smoothness that makes it finish easy. cheers!"
"Taste is a bit weak in the inital mouthful but has a nice finish that stays with you with a hoppy finish. This is not a beer i would nessasarly drink all the time but not a bad amber as it is smooth and easy to drink."
"Fairly drinkable in that it's easy to drink. Not the BEST flavor and not the best I've had, but just sticks solidly to the style."
"12 ounce bottle, Batch 8259, bottled 12/5/2007. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an amber/orange color with a very small off-white head. Head retention and lacing is average. Aroma is a bit light, it smells like caramel and toasted malt. Luckily the taste is stronger than the aroma. It tastes like caramel/toasted malt, citrusy hops, and biscuit/bread/grain. Finishes with a slight bitter aftertaste. It's a mostly malty sweet tasting brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium with average carbonation. There's some substance to this brew, it's not thin or watery. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and easy to drink. It's good choice as a session beer. I think this is a good beer, I'd buy it again."
"D - This is a great amber. Makes a great session brew."
"Overall, this is a very nice sessionable ale."
"Not a bad American Amber Ale. Pretty tasty, and sessionable at that (barely). It's rather enjoyable, and I'm sure it goes great in the summer on a hot day or in the Spring on a mild day. Take your pick. Recommended."
"A nice amber ale that could be easily overlooked in the shadows cast by its bigger and darker brothers."
"Interesting enough and dry enough in the finish to make me want more. I would happily session this one and I could see it being a very versatile beer with meals. It's a pity this isn't available in Massachusetts -- I always savor my visits home so I can enjoy the offerings of this great brewery."
"d: It seems like many amber ales are watery, bland beers that primarily exist to offer BMC drinkers their first taste of ""craft."" This is not a typical amber ale, this is a more worthy amber ale that offers an above average hop profile and a pretty damn tasty session beer."
"Drinkability: Hech yeah!... have these all day long.... this one is all about sessionable goodness."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and, while this was a noisy beer on the pour, the carbonation is subdued. I rate the drinkability high due to the wonderful appearance, pleasant taste, and hop flavor."
"Rich muddy burnt orange colored pour with a creamy beige head. Looks gorgeous. Smell is predominantly tart, heavy malt. Taste is smooth, creamy, dense malt flavors with a mild hop bitterness poking out a bit. A nice drinkable amber although not too spectacular overall."
"Overall Impression: Wow, nice amber! Great flavors in moderation and balance let both the hop and malt characteristics shine. I think this might be my favorite Bell's yet!"
"Pretty good, it's kind of reminiscent of an Oktoberfest in the malt profile."
"D: I would have another of these in a heartbeat. There's not much more that could be done to make this any easier for me to drink."
"Moutfeel is very light and carbonated, nothing much to notice, same with the drinkability."
"Re-reviewed 2/19/08 after an especially enjoyable bottle"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden amber with a slight head (due to a chilled glass damn-it) that left slight lacing down the sides of the glass. The one thing that caught my attention in a positive way was the amount of suspended yeast in it. While its not consistent with the style, I find it a sexy attribute in a beer. I love me some suspended yeast. Aroma is slightly sweet with caramel malts but there is also a roasted smell to it along with some molasses. Taste is sweet but dry. My biggest issue with it is it has an almost saccharine quality to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation. I still find to this to be on par with the rest of Bell's lineup."
"Overall this is a very solid amber ale. Not the prettiest amber ale, but very tasty. I'd love to have this on tap. I agree w/ the other reviews stating that this would be a great session beer."
"This was a disappointng beer. I especially enjoy Bell's Two-Hearted Ale but this one did not agree with me nearly as well. It arrived a bit lighter than I expected for an amber ale. The taste was of sourish malts and bitter hops, but they didn't seem to balance or mix very well. It was a bit of a lopsided brew. Decent, but not extraordinary. Maybe it's better out of the bottle?"
"Drinkability: A pleasurable and sessionable amber offering from Bell's. I love the unfiltered look, which I think adds a lot with all the floaties, though I think that could turn some people off."
"MF&D: lasting carbonation, light to medium bodied and extremely smooth. Very drinkable, crisp and clean with an awesome aftertaste that left me craving more. which i guess would make it a great session beer."
"I really like this one. If you are serving this to a squeamish friend, beware of the sediment on the bottom of the bottle. It made no difference to me whatsoever but there was no mention on the label or I would have poured more carefully. Beautiful ale!"
"The best amber ale I have had and an overall top 10. Sessionable, affordable, and great tasting, just what I like."
"Overall this was a very good beer here from Bell's/ I had not really had much experience with their regular lineup, tending to stick more with the bigger seasonal offerings, but this may have changed my mine, really showing what they can pull off on a more mass produced level. This was very good and I would not hesitate to try it again on any condition."
"This beer poured a copper color with a thick off white head and nice lacing. The aroma was of malt sweetness and some yeastiness. The taste was great! Had a nice sweetness and hint of roasted malts. Probably the best amber I've ever had. Very smooth and very drinkable. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium carbonation. Overall a great beer!!"
"D: A decent malt bill with good drinkability making for a good session beer."
"It feels a lot like a well carbonated wheat beer. Finishes crisp due to carbonation, and leaves a citrus aftertaste. Easy to drink."
"Overall- I will have to say that this is definitely one of my favorite beers, if not THE favorite of this style so far. Very drinkable and just all around good. From what I have seen, Bell's really lives up to their reputation. I wish we could get it here in GA, but maybe one day. Thanks to my buddy, Aaron, for snagging a few of these from his wife to share with me!"
"This is a highly drinkable, sessionable ale that I will be purchasing again."
"This is precisely why Bell's is one of the best brewers in the U.S. They excel with their more sessionable beers as they do the high-ABV monsters. Long may they brew."
"D - Decent overall, but not my favorite offering from Bell's. Worth a try."
"Pours a pretty clouded orange-ish brown amber. Slight leafy nose. Seems very calm though. The flavor really brings it here. Even and firm bodied. Consistently earthy woody tones. Feel is very well bodied on the liquid and a good carbonation as well. I'm calling this as a good example of the style and an overall good brew to try."
"This one is okay, but there are a lot of other beers I'd rather drink."
"Orange amber in color with an abundance of fine bubbles. Orangish off white head is retained to almost the end. Good lacing. Plenty of hop presence, aroma is kind of agricultural. Taste is dry and clean, any sweetness from the malt is overshadowed by dry bitterness making it an excellent choice to accompany food. Feels like carbonated mineral water in the mouth. A good solid beer that I would happily drink again."
"Body is a hazy glowing orange amber in color. Hosts a light tan head that quickly fades. Nose is mildly vibrant with spicey wheat, and hints of nuts and orange marmalade. Enters the mouth softly tart sweet width tones of toasty wheat. A mineral hoppy feel greats the back of the tongue. A subdued malty nut feel also develops twords the end of the palate creating a even but slightly thick mouthfeel. Just the right amoutn of complexity for a amber ale. Very drinkable."
"A touch over-carbonated although thinking back to the head I'm wondering if I should have poured harder. The body is full but never heavy. This has been, and in my mind still is, one of the reasons this style exists. An often overdone, underwhelming beer that is taken to new heights here. Sessionable in every way and a Midwestern classic."
"D: I like this a lot, very flavorful and great mouthfeel, but not too overpowering. Definitely would have this again."
"D'ability - A nice American ale with some rich maltiness to balance out the hops. 4/5"
"Overall this is a pretty good amber ale. I would drink more."
"D - One of the better amber ales out there. This stuff is thirst quenching and relatively light, but provides enough complexity and depth of character to keep a beer lover interested. A very fine choice for a session brew."
"Overall- I've had this beer many times from the bottle or a regular tap and thought it was pretty decent. However, it's a whole different experience from the cask. It really seemed to up the smoothness of this beer."
"Drinkability: Nice and refreshing. Nice session beer. Another solid outing by Bell's."
"Pours a cloudy gloden orange with a good two finger head. Head retention is better than normal with moderate lace left behind. Smell was not too impressive. Smells of malt and grain, but I also detect an almost yeast like smell, similar to a Belgian. Taste is better. A nice malt profile and noticable grain presence. No real hop bitterness to this as expected. Moderate carbonation leaves a crisp and clean feeling with a slightly dry aftertaste. Overall not a bad beer. I admit I'm not a huge fan of Amber's but this was one of the better ones I've tasted yet."
"Drinkability: this is a staple beer for me and never disappoints. Solid all around and is very easy to drink."
"Pours a murky dark gold amber with a nice sized head. Aroma is sweet with herbal and floral hops. Some citrus notes. Tastes caramelly and sweet. Lots of herbal hops. Balanced and flavorful. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. Pretty drinkable. Solid amber overall."
"This is an Amber you could drink gallons of and not get tired of it. Some nice biscuity flavors going on here."
"Very drinkable and quite enjoyable. Remarkable smell, predictable taste."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a smooth carbonation. I will definitely have to revisit this one again."
"Not a bad effort by Bells though"
"I'll definitely be coming back to this beer after as I really enjoyed it. Great job Bell's, great job!"
"Visiting my brother in NC; he bought this to try. (Thanks D!) Beautiful deep orange deep orange color with decent head that laced the glass all the way down. Balanced malt in the nose with a very pleasant, spicy hops scent. So far, looks and smells like a Pale Ale. Taste was nicely balanced. Good mouthfeel with moderate to a bit more carbonation. Pale Ale-like hops taste at first, mellowing to balanced hops/malt and spicy aftertaste. Extremely drinkable and enjoyable. What a wonderful surprise."
"The smell was feintly of pear or fresh plum but not very strong. The taste was of citrus, yeast, all spice, mild hops. The mouthfeel was pleasant, well rounded bitter taste and finish, very tasty. I could go for another of these, it's a very complete and satisfying sample of the style from Bells, thanks again Merchant's in Dearborn."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Definitely one of the better amber ales I've drinken."
"Overall, a pretty solid amber ale. I enjoyed the mixture of malts/hops that went into this beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, and some caramel. The taste is malty and some caramel. Slight bitterness in the finish. Medium body. Drinkable, another nice brew from Bells, recommended."
"Drinkability: A nicely done, well-balanced amber ale. In fact, I've found the bulk of the Bell's line-up from top to bottom to be quite solid."
"Drinks pretty good, just didn't quite live up to the initial taste up front, not a bad amber though, just not a great one"
"A dark shade of amber with a dense, creamy off white one finger head, and super retention leaving lacing to the bottom. The nose is faint with notes of candied sugar, nutty malt, and a light fruit scent. A remarkably smooth mouthfeel thats even, creamy, slightly chewy and just enough carbonation to develop a fizzy build at the end. Flavors of toasted grains, bready, caramel, mild tartness midway through, and a flash of spiciness just before it goes down. The finish is semi-dry with much of the roasted malt residual and nuttiness."
"Really a great alternative for Fat Tire lovers. I am not a lover of FT, but this beer has a touch of the biscuit taste everyone digs. Less the hops. Another solid beer from Bell's. Great head. Good flavors--- touch of spruce. Not the least bit heavy. Good score from across the border. Can't wait to hoard it."
"Bell's Amber Ale pours a copper color with a white head from a brown bottle. There is a mild, malty aroma. The flavor is superbly well balanced. Toasted malt is evenly matched with hops, the malt is more prevalent in the finish leaving a caramel flavor. They call this the flagship of their line, and for good reason. This is an excellent, highly sessionable beer. Recommended."
"A very good example of the style, though I still like this brewerys Two Hearted Ale more, but this is a very solid brew that I would love to try on tap someday."
"A delicious copper colored ale with a hearty malt flavor that goes down smooth as water.Nice aftertaste and no carbonation gives an enjoyable experience from the moment it hits your tongue to the moment it hits your stomach.Highly recommended I will be buying this ale again!!!!"
"Pours a burnt orange cloudy mixture with some bubbly head that never really amounts to much. Maybe its because I had a batch 8000 before this, but I smell the spices of coriander, and ginger, as well as some pepper. Taste is smooth and lightly carbonated with some copper type of taste that is smoothed over by sweet malt. Another great offering from Bells."
"Extremely drinkable and refreshing."
"Drinkability: Excellent example of the style. Full of flavour and well-balanced, easy to drink quite a few."
"I've certainly had better amber ales from Dogfish Head and Three Floyds, but when you are in Michigan and its $3 a pint, hell give me five!"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is toasted fruity malt and some citrusy hops. The taste is a dry toasty malt with a nice bitter hop finish. Overall, this is a very nice Amber that is recommended."
"Pours an unfiltered, hazy, orangish copper color. Solid off-white head, a bit of lace. Aroma is pleasant with some toffee, butterscotch, citrusy hops, and a bit toasted. Taste is pretty well balanced with more of the citrus and malty sweetness noted in the aroma. Hops are a bit spicy. Medium bodied and an easy drinker. You can see why this is their flagship beer. Nothing too extreme and well-balanced leading to a beer that can be used to convert the BMCs. A solid amber but not the best I have had."
"Taste offers an impeccable balance between creamy smooth malt and a refined bitter finish. Really harmonious and makes for a great soft session beer. Not nearly as full-flavored as many other stellar Bell's beers, but this a a robust and highly drinkable American amber ale."
"M & D: Well-carbonated, and perfect for the taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and crisp with a great body. Again, balance is the key and its done so well here. For being a brewery that's mostly known for its stouts, this amber has sure proven its worth amongst the Bell's fold. This one is definitely a must-have for Amber fans, and the flavor will definitely allow you to drink your fill."
"Very bland beer...the smell (which should first draw you in) is weak and the taste just does not fit. It is almost flat to taste. I was very disappointed! It does have a good color and it may be better in draft form. I am waiting to try other beers in the Bell Brewery Family!"
"D: I first snagged one of these from a friend who's first beer choice is Shiner Bock. I wasn't expecting a bad beer, but needless to say I wasn't expecting something this good. Well rounded, and ballsy with the hops. A nice surprise. Hope to have it one on tap one day."
"Pours a nice amber color, a touch hazy, with a quality finger of white head on top that disappears fairly slowly. Nose is strong on toffee malt, maybe a touch of dried fruit and some light hops as well. Malt dominates, though. Taste is similar. Mostly caramel malt comes through throughout the drink. . A little stronger hop presence than in the nose - some comes through, especially lightly up front and in the fairly brief aftertaste - but this one is definitely a malt beer. I like this one. It's definitely not the flavor explosion that a lot of Bell's beers are, but it's a very drinkable beer for any occasion."
"Pours a thick and hazy brown in color. Fairly dense white head that evaporated down to a scuzzy layer. Malty nose with a slight evergreen whiff to it. Flavor is a nice solid malt backbone. Kind of an oakiness to it as well. Hops give a slight sprice and evergreen flavor too. Medium to almost full mouthfeel. odd for the setyle but I am really digging it. Nice almost-session beer."
"D: Nothing in this beer really stands out even though it is a solid beer. A good example of an amber ale but not one to write home about. Would make a good session beer though."
"Thanks to dekker0 for including it in our trade!"
"Really tasty amber ale, I like the hop punch. Bell's strikes again."
"B""ham UK"
"Overall, this was a great amber. Some of that unique Bell's flavor is there (the yeast I think) Balanced on the malt with a good afront oh hops and yeast bitterness."
"Pours an orangy / light amber color with a fairly large off white head. The head slowly shrinks down to a covering of the glass, lacing is minimal. This is a tasty and very well balanced ale. Primarily malty and very smooth, there is also enough bitterness to keep it interesting and keep the sweetness down to a manageable level. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fine. I had it with a barbequed ribs / chicken dinner and it held up fine. Would be a great regular beer or part of a regular rotation as well as a good session beer."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a light tan, stable but short head. The lacing it leaves is sparse and slick, but clings a bit. The body is a very hazy golden copper, with a significant amount of sediment floating about. I wonder why that's in a beer like this, but I'm sure it helps the flavor, and maybe it's even bottle conditioned. The nose is very malty-sweet, with a toasted bit to it as well. I pick up mellow citrus notes, too. The beer has a nice taste balance, with the hops leading at first, but, again, mellow. It finishes with a relaxed toastiness that invites another taste. A bit too acidic, though. The mouth is medium, with too much carbonation, despite being very fine. Overall, it's not hard to drink, but too many faults make me regret that I bought a whole case."
"an all-around solid beer from bell's. pours a hazy light amber, decent creamy head. this reminds me more of a bock than an american amber/red due to the malt/sweet balance of it. dough and toffee in the nose along with something i can't put my finger on. flowers? sweet caramel malts upfront with just barely enough hops to round it out before the sweetness comes returns on the back end. medium carbonation from the bottle conditioning, nice and creamy/crisp at the same time. almost medium in body. a nice session beer but for that i would prefer a pride and joy. sweetness can make this a little cloying after a while."

"D - Surprisingly drinkable, great example of the style. A beautifully balanced amber ale with subltle hops and a clean finish. Most definitely something you may want to session in my opinion."
"Overall, an amber ale that is up front about what it is. A good beer for when you're not in a heavy-beer mood."
"I guess Bells is big on bottle conditioning. I don't think I am a fan for that in this type of beer. The bottle poured with a cloudy amber color. Head was good and lasted most of the way. The hops were notable but nothing over the top. Taste was good and very fresh, but the yeasty notes just don't need to be there. I really think this might be a better beer if it were not bottled conditoned. Worth a try, but I think it could be better."
"Pours a hazy amber, off white head forms, goes pretty fast, leaves a few lace spots. Smell is sweet, vegetal, citrus, some bread, nothing special, bit of citrusy hops. Taste is sweet, some caramel, yeast, bread, very light, floral in the finish, light bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Drinkable, but a good example of mediocrity, maybe past its prime a bit? Thanks Jan!"
"MF/D - A solid representation of the style from a top notch brewery. A good value session beer that is definitely worth a try."
"Good, a better version of your average amber ale.Im not really a fan of these types of beers but its good none the less.I would have again."
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Adnams Tulip pint glass. Appears a hazy, deep amber color with an inch of off - white foam that leaves a decent lace on the glass. Smells of caramel malt with a crisp, fruity note. Initial taste is of sweet, lightly toasted malt, followed by fruity, flowery hops. Very close to full bodied with medium carbonation. A nice, sessionable amber."
"Pours a cloudy, orangeish colour. Not much head stays but could be easily called back with even light swirling. Spots of lacing left behind. A very musty aroma, lightly roasted caramel malts mostly. Smells certainly closer to a pale ale. Musty and unappealing. Not much flavour either. Some nice malts but hints of diacetyl. Perhaps I expect more from Bell's given their excellent lineup of offerings or perhaps just the limitations of the style, but this one is just painfully average (at best). Thanks Frozensoul 327!"
"D - Very drinkable, so smooth and subtle you don't even realize you just finished it."
"Poured into a pint glass. Looks very cloudy - the color is a deep amber with a nice finger or so of head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smell is slightly floral with some roasted character and maybe even a little sour apple fruitiness. The taste is very nice - malty up front with a generous hop backbone. There is an mingling of sweet and sour as well. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich - excellent for this style. Very easy to drink/session - good stuff. Recommended."
"Into a pint glass, pours a murky amber (duh) with a twinge of particulate floating around, a decent beginning head that recedes quickly to a thin foam, and pretty decent lacing. Aroma is malty, toasted and caramels, faint herbal hops. Taste is also more malty, biscuts, bready and faintly herbal hops, a little earthy, caramel is gone, fruits now, a twinge tart. The mouth is not good, thinnish and too carbonated, and the finish is too dry and there is straw in the finish, and I don't like it. Overall, a decent beer, not Bell's best, easy enough to drink, but not my cup of tea."
"D: This is a very solid beer, I could drink large quantities of this with ease and would do so if I could find them more regularly!"
"Overall, an impressive beer. This would be a great session beer."
"Drinkability: A decent beer, but not what I'd consider a flagship beer. Never the less, it is one of the better ones in this style."
"Batch 7779. Had this one right after the Bell's Pale at Flying Saucer and reviewed from notes. This is one of the palest ambers I have ever had, not much redder than the pale ale. The head was rather thin and diminished quickly leaving a small amount of spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma was of caramel malts and some very subdued hops. At least is was more noticeable than the pale. The taste was a good balance of caramel malts and subtle citrus hops. The mouthfeel had a slight alcohol bite, more than I would expect for a 5.5% beer. Decent carbonation. This would perhaps make a good nightcap, but it is not really something I would buy regularly."
"D - I can drink this often...very well-crafted beer."
"Its solid and nearly flawless (except for the mouthfeel) but its a bit watery and unremarkable. Still, its very drinkable with clean, easygoing flavors, which makes it a good session beer. Recommended, but just barely"
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"Broad, refreshing flavor with copious but unoffending biitterness from a surprisingly robust hop presence and a medium malt profile. A little metallic and tinny tasting in the finish. Mouthfeel could stand to be a little thicker but this still is a fairly solid amber ale (though the hoppiness almost makes you think it's a pale ale) with highly drinkable qualities, although maybe moreso in summer than in winter."
"Pours a cloudy orange/amber. A bit of very fine sedimet is floating around. Bubbly white head, about two fingers worth.. Smell's of faint hops and sweet malt. Very refreshing smelling. It makes me want to take a huge gulp as the first taste. Fairly sweet malt flavor with well balanced hop flavor. Very little bitterness. It seems like the sweetness might be sticky, but a nice crisp carbonation seems to scrub it clean. Excellent smooth, but crisp mouthfeel. You can easily drink three or four of these. After drinking so many stouts and IPA's this winter, this has been an awesome change. A perfect example of a simple beer that can please any craft beer enthusiast."
"I finished this, and thought, this is a decent, but different, amber ale. Good. Would be happy to drink it again (maybe fresher?), But I can't agree with my friend- it doesn't blow my socks off."
"A good one for getting again. Certainly sessionable."
"Pours a beautiful orange amber with alittle haze a short head, and pretty good lacing. The residual head sticks around for a while. The nose has some cereal grains up front and some malt in the background. The taste is very balanced and very nice. Creamy and spicy with mild but noticeable hops, and some fruit on the finish. Nice balanced mouthfeel and quite a session beer. Good solid standard."
"Notes: First good amber i've had. I would buy this again, hands down, no questions asked."
"D: A really great session brew. Heed the carbonation and sip don't chug, but as the carbonation settles more and more, you can chug more and more. I am not really recommending chuging though; (even if it is good enough for me to want to) take the time to enjoy it."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a batch ID on the back label that when entered on the website tells you when it was packaged. The odd thing is that the batch ID indicated that this was the Winter White and not the Amber though. Was a hazy copper color. Had a decent head that quickly dissipated but left some lacing throughout. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy - more creamy than I expected for an amber so a good surprise. The aroma was average - not really strong in any area but had sweet malt to it. For the style though, you don't really expect a strong aroma though so met expectations. The taste was excellent. Started strong and finished strong. Again, since an amber, there was no overriding theme just a solid great taste. This could easily be my session beer if available where I lived which sadly it isn't. Strongly recommend. (4, HR, T, Y)"
"Might be a little too oily sweet for my personal preferences to make me a regular buyer, but its still a quality amber."
"Another shining brew to Bells' repertoire. I would snag this if you are a big fan of the style."
"Bell's Amber would go quite well on a warm summer day, as it is definately a thirst quencing and refreshing offering of this style. However, while it wasn't bad, it definately left something to be desired."
"The drinkability is good pound a few.. No Problemo. Prosit MK"
"batch #7748"
"In the mouth this beer is creamy, that much became evident when I burped and some of the beer came up with the burp-very creamy. Carbonation is subtle and is not really noticed unless specifically focusing on that aspect of the beer. It does not interfere with this beers flavor profile and actually accents the malt characteristics of this beers flavor. Does not have a dry finish, and goes down quite easily. I probably wont buy this beer again(in the near future) just because there are so many other interpretations of this style. I am also not a big fan of banana and clove phenols in an American style."
"12 oz. bottle, batch 7713, which, according to the website, was packaged on 11/1/06. Sampled on 11/29, so it doesn't get much fresher than this. It pours an unfiltered caramel/amber with high carbonation and a voluminous head that is craggy as it recedes, leaving good lacing. It smells of juicy fruits (mainly white grapefruit) along with some sweetness, but it's a bit light. On the palate there are pale and caramel/toasted malts, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, oily/perfumy, pine, and possible Curacao hops along with a touch of yeast. The caramel quality really strengthens as it warms. It is tingly, yet medium and smooth on the palate, leaving a medium finish but thinning a bit as I progress. Overall a pretty good amber that would make for a good session."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky golden amber color with a slightly carbonated head. Smell is of amber and caramel malts, sweet. Taste is initially sweet, followed by a nice balance of hops that finishes dry. Beer is medium bodied, chewy, with creamy carbonation. Overall I would have to say that this is definitely a drinkable beer, but it doesn't really stand out to me as anything too special."
"At first sip, there were some lightly caramalized malts, and a nice fresh yeasty aroma, but by the end of the bottle it had become just another decent amber ale in a sea of amber ales designed to be friendly and approachable to those who are new to craft beer. Nothing wrong with that, but I can save a buck and support my local brewer to boot by drinking regular Dominion Ale, which is more of a British Pale Ale, but has more character. So yeah, Um, I'll just go an do that I guess."
"I had this beer on tap in a glass beer mug. It pours a pleasing amber with a frothy white head. Its smell like its taste is malty and slightly bitter. There are some solid citrus undertones, easy drinking. Light to moderate mouthfeel. Very drinkable. This is a good cross over beer for a macro drinker that like Killians."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with a nice layer of head and Is moderately carbonated. The aroma is a little piney and possibly some floral notes. It goes down very smooth and is rather malty. It is easy on palate even though it is quite bitter. This beer could use a litter better balance between the malts and hops but is still a good beer. This is the first time I've had it out of out a glass and it is much better. Having this one out of a bottle definitely doesn't do it justice."
"Higher and lighter in the mouth than some other amber ales that I've had. Very drinkable. An enjoyable beer and a fun introduction to Bell's, which has up to now not been available here in Virginia."
"The pour is an attractive copper gold with a short lived white head. Very little lacing with this one. Aroma is light malt with detectable flowery hop notes. Taste starts off with sweet light malt and light toasted grains. The finishes has a nice bitter hops taste. Mouthfeel is creamy with decent carbonation and drinkability is good due to the light body. Overall, this is a good example of the well crafted amber ale. Nothing that makes it a standout, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Nice body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very crisp with a biscuity malt and flowery hops finish. I could, and probably will, session on this beer."
"Drinkability: This is where the beer scores best. Somewhat complex upfront and clean in the finish makes for a great drinking beer. The lower ABV helps, but is perfect for this beer."
"An OK beer but not a great one."
"D: The slight sweetness makes for a good drinkability here."
"Cheers!"
"I have mixed feelings about this beer. But only because of all the other great choices from Bell's."
"D - Nothing spectacular. Drinkable, but leaves me wanting more."
"Overall - A great Amber that is very balanced and highly drinkable. Grab a six pack and enjoy."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very cloudy copper color with nice white head. Very surprised to find little if any smell at all. A touch of citrus and malt at best. Taste: Nice hop punch with malt backbone. Citrus is present. Very drinkable and very smooth. Mouthfeel is excellent with a little dryness in the finish. Carbonation is just a notch higher than expected. Interesting that this is an amber. Has the appearance of most APA's and could easily pass as one. Definitely worth sampling."
"Eric"
"This beer is as if someone mixed a pale ale and an amber. The beer is a cloudy golden orange. There is a fair head with minimal lacing. The smell is somewhat hoppy. The taste is good. Like stated above, amber and pale ale mix. The mouthfeel is smooth and there is a nice aftertaste. The drinkability is good as well. Bell's makes some fine beers and this is no exception."
"Thanks to Derbert for the offering."
"Medium to full bodied for an amber, this was just an excellent drinker for one or many"
"Thanks, murrayswine, for the opportunity"
"Drinkability: Not too heavy, I could drink this all day."
"A great session beer and one of many solid offerings from Bell's. This beer is a regular in my fridge and I would recommend it to anyone. This may also be a good crossover beer."
"A very clear rusty hue enteers my glass with some friendly bubbling. The aroma is a slightly thick amber malt with some real subtle English hopping. This mix gave the aroma a very biscuity aroma. The taste is equally biscuity that takes on a more sweet Hawaiian bread profile. A little grityy on the tongue but good carbonation to clean that up."
"Bell's continues to confound me with thier naming system. The Pale Ale is some type of wheat beer, while this ""American Amber"" is a classic ESB, IMHO. Weird. At any rate, this is still a solid entry and worth a try."
"Pours a murky orange color. A nice foamy off white head builds as you pour and continues building to a nice full one inch cap after you finish. This slowly drops to a nice think coating on the top of beer that leaves nice spotches of lacing on the glass. Sweet toffee like smell with some spicey citrus hops notes. It smells like a clean, smooth beer. The malt is really the backbone of this beer when you taste it. Everything else seems to go the the background but things are balanced so that it is not overly sweet. Some earthyness to the malt. Nice dry finish. Very smooth and easy drinking. Overall this has been my biggest surprise of the Bell's beers I've tried. It was the one I was expecting the least from but probably the one I enjoyed the most. Not a knock your socks off brew but a good solid every day beer."
"This one was kinda all over for me. It was orangish red in color with little to no head and some small chunks. Smell is exceptional, with a peach and plum smell up front with a bit of malt and hops to follow. Taste is a bit above average, nice and complex but reminds me alot of flavored sparkling water. Mouthfeel and drinkablity are very good goes down smooth and easy."
"Rich without feeling heavy. I could work my way through several of these without feeling overwhelmed or like I compromised for endurance sake. Welcome to the rotation, Bell's Amber."
"Drinkability - this is very good and goes down well. Very sessionable."
"I will look for a new bottle from the brewery, but I won't go out of my way to try it again...there are too many beers in front of it in line."
"Bell's self-proclaimed flagship brew. Pours a hazy orange with streams of carbonation and some tiny bits of yeast getting kicked around. The caramel malts dominate this one, but it does have a touch of spicy hops that add a little more depth to the flavor. Comes off a bit dry, with a slight metallic flavor. Overall, it's a solid amber with a good malt base, but Bells has a wide array of better brews."
"Overall, a fine example of an easy-drinking amber ale. Wow! Bell's scores big again!"
"A copper color with hints of a golden hue on the sides, a small head forms, white in color, a disappears very quickly. The scent of malt is very evident, not much in hop aroma. There are some fruity aromas that are there as well. The taste is mostly of the malt, which makes it very mild in flavor. The mouthfeel is thin and tad watery azt the beginning, then it gains more body as it crosses the palate. This an easy to drink beer, with the sweet malty flavor, making it favorable to drink. Overall though it needs some hops to balance out the sweetness. This would be a great session beer and even a beer to introduce someone to craft beer."
"great beer over all, old stand by for most of us michiganders."
"Verdict: It's pretty good, except for the distraction of the off-flavors. I wouldn't mind having another one."
"D--very good, but almost too sweet for me. Not sure that I could drink more than one more in a sitting as a result."
"New penny in color. Im sorry, forgive me, but I just cant get excited about Amber ales with no hop aroma. Subtle malt aroma, with a light hint of caramel and a suggestion of doughy yeast. Youd think malt magician Larry Bell could come up with something a little better smelling than this. Mild, mediocre malt flavor, which is very crisp, but overall husky. Caramel and toasted malt flavors, with herbaceous, weedy hops. Lacking bitterness and a pronounced hop flavor and aroma. This seems like an amber ale from a crappy brewpub."
"Clear amber capped with a short white head that settles into a solid ring. Some fine bubbles ended up sticking to the glass. Malty caramel and brown sugar aroma with a bit of toasted grain husk. Fruity as well, with floral and citrus hop character. Pleasant malt sweetness with balanced bitterness and moderate hop flavour. Some caramel into the finish. Medium/light body, medium carbonation with a solid mouthfeel. Quite nice. Another top-notch beer from Bell's."
"I've had better bottles of this beer - not as flat - so I'll probably have to review this brew again in the future to insure a fair whack."
"Drinkability: Nothing spectacular, I didn't really want another one, in fact, I could barely finish the first one."
"A really drinkable Amber Ale even though it's a bit undercarbonated. Some ambers are much hoppier (North Coast's Red Seal) while this is very, very similar to Anderson Valley's Boont Amber except for two important areas: It's less filtered leaving a lot more substance in each sip and this bottle was undercarbonated the bottle conditioned bubbles add a very nice texture and leave it feeling more ""crafted"" than AV's Boont. This may not get as much attention as Bell's many fine Stouts but it's just as well made."
"D: I could buy this again. I could drink a few. Does it stand out? Not really for me, but compared with BMC, this is an okay drinker."
"This brew pours a hazy, yet clear amber color. The head is one and a half fingers in height, creamy, and recedes slowly. The aroma is a lot more complex than most amber ales. It is mostly malt, but there is a hop presence which makes it so the beer doesn't smell sugary. The taste is incredibly balanced. Niehter bitter nor sweet stand out, but they are both there playing with my taste buds. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and most importantly it isn't sticky the way most amber ales seem to be. Overall, amber ale isn't one of my favorites styles. This brew is an exception. It is what I would like all amber ales to be: a beer than is less hoppy than a pale ale, but not so sugary that is it sticky."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Amber pours out a pale amber color with a medium sized head. The aroma is caramel with some toasted malts and spicy hops. The flavor starts off with some caramel, followed by husky grain. Some fruitiness comes in at the middle. Finishes bitter with a mild hoppiness that tastes just a bit skunky. Medium mouthfeel. Decent drinkability. This beer has nice balance, but the flavor is only ok. Just an average amber ale."
"Aroma is grassy with hints of drier hay. Light amber color with a very nice two finger thick white head. Flavor is all smooth malt with just a hint of sweet caramel in the finish. This will be overlooked because it doesnt have any wow factor, but this a damn fine beer. Excellent lacing a beautiful head and flavor that does what it is supposed to do."
"Overall: A great choice for a session brew. Just a solid everyday beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head above the clear copper brew. What head there was lasts pretty nicely, with abundant bubbly lacing. Aroma is well-balanced, with pronounced malt present. Taste is also balanced, with grain husks and hoppiness duking it out, ending more or less a draw, but with the bitterness lingering. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pleasing, and this one would make a nice everyday type of brew."
"Drinkability was quite good. This would make a great session beer. I could sure go for another right now. Thanks to Frozensoul327 for the trade."
"Slàinte!"
"Well-balanced and fairly complex for the style. The Bell's yeast is definately detectable and lends an interesting twist. One of my favorite session beers. A Michigan classic."
"Slightly cloudy copper-amber with a finger of tan frothy head. Special bready malts and s a little caramel kissed by a small hop note tickles the nose, tantalizing and and giving you a good idead of what is to come. Slightly fruity caramel and an unertone of biscuity malts. Hops are well balanced kiss of bitterness. Light body with a slightly slick feel and nice lively but not frothy carbonation. Wow drinkable. A new balanced session brew for me! Why has it taken me this long to drink this beer, it's all over around here! Even the grocery stores that consider Heineken a special beer have this!"
"Pours a deep, murky orange with a slight, foamy head. (It would be very nice to look at if there was more of a head.) Smells very sweet, but with a good balance of spices to keep it from being sickly sweet. Moderately plain, though. Given the nose, I wasn't expecting such a level of broadness and subtlety in the taste. Spicy and slightly metallic at first (but not overkill...ie Dogfish 90 IPA), the beer becomes honey-sweet and well-rounded. This is a beautifully crafted beer!!!"
"D-It's an unoffensive thrist quencher. It's quaffable, but not particularly special."
"I could drink this beer all day. The taste smell and sensation that rushed, not only through my mouth, but through my whole body was absolutely delightful."
"D-This beer has a nice hop taste with a good malt backbone. The hops are citrus flavors but they have depth so you can't really pick out one flavor. The malt has lots of pale but some toasted malt to give it depth and character. Nice smooth amber."
"Caramel malt, slightly nutty with a good dose of bitter hops for balance. There are some yeast notes ofbanana way in the back. Nice dry finish. The body starts off a little more than full, but the dryness and carbonation clear it without being too abrupt. A classic session beer."
"Tasting notes are peach apricot colored murk with no lace. No foam. Too flat. Straightforward amber maltiness with a good amount of hops.Way too flat !!!"
"Pours cloudy amber with tan head. My wife could smell the sweetness of this beer three feet away! It is sweet, but I like the citrus tang of this beer mix with caramel overtones at end. Thier is enough hops to give it a good balance. I could drink this beer all day."
"edit: you know, this is like some kind of crazy wheat beer only with the citrus already added in for you. Crazy, just crazy."
"Bell's Amber begins a nice dark-amber color. It is somewhat opaque, with a fine half-inch white head. There are sediment particles discernable through the hazy aura of the brew. It smells crisp and fruity. Malt and citrus notes are there right off the bat, followed by a light floral aroma. The taste is pleasant, but not terribly complex. There is little hop action. The taste of malt and fruity elements are there. Sweetness level is high, but overall the flavor is not exceptionable. In the mouth there is a tart feeling on the tongue. Not offensive, but the relatively high level of carbonation and lack of fullness make for a less than substantial beer. Overall this is a decent beer that is drinkable to a degree. It is not, however, the most flavorul or easily appreciated. While above mediocre, and certainly session worthy, it is not the best that Bell's has to offer."
"overall, a very solid but somewhat unexciting beer."
"Very, very drinkable any time of the year."
"I won't be running out to get more of this; and IF you are shopping for it, look at the bottles first, to see how how much sediment is in the bottom."
"Crisp, refreshing. Nice label!"
"hopback is my existing benchmark for ambers, but this has a nice focus on the sweetness, with enough hops to show through. i love munich malts...mmm. i also love the texture of this beer: the munich gives it a great chance to stick around while your tastebuds do their thing"
"Bready and biscuit malt flavors with a clean light caramel malt sweetness balanced by hop bitterness. Body is fuller than most of this style. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Butterscotch continues to emerge with warming. Finish is clean bittersweet with bready malt notes. Very drinkable!"
"Smooth, somewhat creamy with light effervescence, medium bodied. A good beer. My only wish was that the taste had been as complex as the nose was."
"Drinkability  Excellent drinkabilitydelicious with plenty of flavor, but not overwhelming. The long-lasting citrusy finish makes me want more and more: a beer for the long haul."
"Bright orange in colour with a slightly off white head. Surprisingly fruity aromas and flavors, mainly lemon, orange, and perhaps even a bit of peach. There are some nice caramel flavors, but little contribution from the hops. Fairly thick bodied, and mellow. Not really what I expected from this brewer, and not quite up to the regular high standards of this brewery, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"It's just been too long (five years) since I've enjoyed my first and last experience with Bell's. Way before I enjoyed all these styles, I made my way up to the Eccentric Cafe for one of the best beer experiences of my life. The good memories came back with this one. Nice orange copper hue with fruity maltiness that I could not get enough of."
"Overall, another great beer from Bells. They never cease to amaze me with their beers. Keep up the great work Bells!!!"
"D: decent beer. noticed that there was sediment at the bottom that I did not pour in, could have affected the review."
"Not a big fan of this style, but this is a really good beer. Bold, robust and malty. Good use of dark grains and malt. It's a liitle hoppier that most ambers, but it doesn't interfere with the sweetness or the body. Has more of a pronounced alcohol flavor and feel into the body and finish. Has some earthy / yeasty flavor along with hop flavoring. Less clean than I like, but still, good beer."
"Not quite sure what to make of this beer. Its the first Amber that I've had that is cloudy, with a little bit of sediment in it. The color is a dark orange. Pours a low/medium head that doesnt last long, aside from the edge of the glass. Taste is a little more bitter than I would care for, but still has decent malt to balance it."
"Pours a bright copper, the color of a new penny. Nice little foamy head that retains well and leaves plenty of sticky lacing. Malty sweet aroma, with hops taking a back seat. Whole lot of sweet, caramelly, doughy malt up in this beer. Hop bitterness is substantial with floral and slightly citric flavor, not at all overwhelming though. Really well balanced. I definitely wouldn't mind sitting down and sipping a few of these. Definitely a great example of the style."
"-UF"
"I decant the 12oz. longneck into an appropriate drinking vessel. A tan head of about 1/2"" rises up and slowly fades away leaving a persistent ring of lace. I immediately catch malt and hop aroma. The beer is fairly clear, and a pale copper color. I must have poured to fast as I have floaters in the beer. I have read that Bell's beers are bottle conditioned so I'm not alarmed by the floaters. Flavor is a nice caramel malt balanced nicely with American hops...although I can't make out the specific hop. The hop bitterness finishes nicely in the aftertaste. Overall a very nice drinkable beer"
"Pours clear with a copper/orange color and a thick, creamy white head with lacing that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Aroma is mostly malt with a slight spiciness from the hops. Flavor profile consists of big backbone of sweet maltiness with a bit of a caramel followed by bit of fruitiness. A mild spicy hops flavor and bitterness balances the flavor profile out. Overall, a rich creamy ale that is sure to please."
"A good transition beer. Not a bold strong Bell's but a very decent brew, better than a national brand anything. Nice hops like a pale ale. Well malted. Very good after fish. I am a missionary in people dropping white wine altogether, particularly after fish when beer is an ancient companion."
"Very nice Amber colored brew with an off white two finger head. Smell is just slighly sweet malt and grassy hops. The taste is so well rounded. Slighly sweet caramel amlt flavor with a perfect hop zing to balance it out. Delicious beer. I could drink these all day."
"Drinkability is good also a decent amber ale, don't know if I would call it the flagship of Bell's but still good enough for repeat buying."
"Overall a splendid example of a style that's been butchered and pimped for over 15 years. This is a model interpretation of an easy drinking, yet refined and calculated amber ale. Fill up an aluminum wash tub with this and fire up the coals, it's summertime baby. This is how we do it in Michigan!"
"This one pours an amber color with with a light tan head that doesn't hang around very long. It smells of malt and I can detect a faint hop aroma. The taste is mostly sweet malt and caramel. There is a light hop after taste. It has a good mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. Overall a good beer. I recommend it."
"Well balanced, overall, and very sessionable. Just not one of my favorites for the style."
"This beer pours a bold and cloudy copper color, not quite amber really. There is a nice head retention and it appears to have a nice amount of carbonation. The first smells are of caramel malts teasing my senses, and that later changes to a large wiff of hops that stays through the rest of the session. The tastes are strong of hops. A little bitter and souring, the aftertaste almost makes you smack your tongue on the roof of your mouth. After your frist few drinks there is a bready flavor sensed also. It doesnt have the ""red beer"" flavor or smell that I expected it too. But its not bad by any means, just not what I was expecting."
"Cascading into my pint glass, it forms an attractive looking dark copper color topped off with a generous head. Good head retention and good lacing. The smell was big on the malts with a slight hop bouquet. True to the aroma, the taste was long on the malts. Smooth and creamy malt was kept in check with some tight carbonation. Sweet malt, caramel, a little butter was first on the palate. Some good toasty flavor leads into crisp hops for a dry, citrous finish. After you have a few sips, you begin to notice a dry bitterness that is almost coffee-like. Surprisingly complex taste that I missed on the first sip. Well balanced and easy to drink. Good choice for a flagship brew. I really think this would please the masses."
"As with other beers in the Bells line the flavors are long lasting and the beer is well crafted."
"Pours a deep copper, not quite an amber in my book though. Looks nice. Very good lacing, and good head retention, it hangs out for a while. Smells slightly yeasty/bready and a mostly malted barley smell. Taste is very bready, sweet, with a pinch of hops in there. Mouthfeel is robust for style, carbonation is just right. This is a great crossover, or session beer."
"Very drinkable, not a bad beer at all."
"Amber in color indeed! With a nice lacing white head, as well. The aroma is malty, bread and caramel tinged with toffee, and light hops. As it warms the aroma shifts more to the hops with a definate citrus and pine scent, and a slight bit of diacetyl. The flavor is sweet, toasty, with fruity yeast in the background. Decent bitterness and a smooth mouthfeel finish this one off. Overall this is still a great beer, it's nice to see Bell's still getting the job done."
"Pours a hazy, but bright, amber color with a decent-sized cream-colored head. Loads of particulate matter suspended in this beer! Head dies back to a thin blanket of foam with good retention. Leaves a small amount of lace on the glass. Clean aroma of carmel malt and a hint of piney hops. Taste is more pine/earthy hops up front, some hop bitterness at the back of the tongue, and a solid malt base. Slightly sour aftertaste. Body is fairly light with moderate carbonation. I've enjoyed most Bell's that I've tried and this is no exception!"
"This, to me, is yet another disappointing Bell's beer. While it's better than some other Bell's beers such as Cherry Stout and Two Hearted (shudder), it isn't a beer I'd buy again. There are just too many good ones out there to waste my money on semi-drinkable brews."
"Tried this one on a recent business trip, with a heavy potato sausage dinner. It appears as an amber, hazy liquid with a thin, but firm and lasting white head. Aroma is very pleasingmalty and doughy, ripe fruit, and a little butterscotch. Caramel and some flowery hops. Foretaste is a little sweet, with a solid malt flavor. Hops really come out in the mid-taste and the beer finishes with a notable bitterness. It was a very nice accompaniment to my mealexactly what I imagine in a drinkable, flavorful ale."
"poured cloudy copper med. sized head that didnt last too long.aroma hops,malts hint of yeast a some sweetness,nice balance. flavor,cant put the buds to it but a slight sweetness almost like pineapple? than some bitterness. had a nice mouth feel and finish"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. It pours a cloudy orange with sediment floating in it that eventually settled to the bottom. The aroma is mostly of pale malt. The flavors is a light malty aroma with hop bitterness up front and sweet pear ending. The ending is crisp with a bready aftertaste but it is not pasty or overdone. This could definately be a daily drinker for those who have access to it."
"This is a good beer with lots of character. I would suggest to at least give it a try if you like slightly bitter beers."
"Final Thought: This beer tasted slightly better the longer it settled, so keep that in mind... Overall a solid ale!"
"Cloudy orange-tinged amber with a pillowy soft white head. Smells of sweet graham crackers, with a gentle hop backing. The taste reminds me of homemade cookie dough and caramel rolls. Very malty and yeasty. Medium bodied, low carbonation. Some hop presence (just enough to balance out the bakery sweetness). One of the best ambers I've ever had."
"This was a light/medium bodied brew with a smooth crisp start and a smooth caramel finish. Caramel and fruit tones lasted briefly on the tongue. Extremely drinkable and a simple session beer that has some nice flavor you won't get bored with."
"Next time I drink this, I'll do a better job of decanting."
"Solid offering, I can see why it is the flagship ale. Nice amber color and a decent head. The taste was more on the lines of a pale ale than an amber. Hints of fruit, a good malt base and a surprise hop effect in the background. Quite tastey, overall."
"This beer pours a nice golden amber color with a 1/2"" think head. The head lingers for a bit, but dissipates pretty quickly. My nose picks up some malt tones coupled with hoppy undertones. Quite nice overall. There is quite a bit of yeast floating in the glass...and even more on the bottom of the bottle. The first sip comes with a strong sweet malty flavor and a bit of hop bite on the finish. Biterness is hardly there...mostly caramel tones and a bit of a bready yeast flavor. It's quite a tasty ale and goes down clean and smooth. This definetly would qualify as a quality session brew. Bell's produces some fine brews and this one is no exception."
"Pours a cloudy orange amber color with an medium head that faded rather quickly. Lots of sediment. Good lace. Smell of sweet malt, with some citrus and perhaps a bit of caramel and vanilla. Taste is sweet malt with a nice crisp hoppiness, finishes dry. Very well balanced. Very drinkable. A very nice amber. Try some if you get the chance"
"orangish red in color. Sediment throughout the glass. An off white head that settled quickly. Lacing was non-existant. Aroma was of sweet malts and a slight citrus tang. little bit of caramel as well. Taste was of sweet grains, herbal spice, slight roasted bitterness. Carbonation has a real bite to it. Very dry. Caramel and roastiness keick into full gear towards the end when the brew warms up. A pretty soild amber in my book."
"The beer pours a light amber color, something like a weak tea. The head is about two fingers that falls quickly to a nice coating over the beer. The nose is citrusy hop with some malt sweetness. The flavor is not as sweet as I expected with the nose. It has a really spicy, almost peppery, hop finish...a very pleasant surprise. The beer is moderately thick, without a burning carbonation, overall good. This s nice drinkable beer. I would consider having a glass of it while out if it were offered. I can see myself revisiting it in the fall or early spring."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, yet malty scent with some floral hop notes. The taste is good. It has a dry, malty flavor that is bitter and toastey. It has a crisp finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine amber ale. It has it all; a good drinker."
"Mouthfeel, meh, plain, some carbonation, some body, but not much in either...drinkability was pretty good I have to admit, but like most of Bell's lighter beer offerings this just doesn't offer enough to bring me back with any regularity."
"Overall this beer isn't terrible but it's not that good either."
"Drinkability is OK, but this beer is way too yeasty, man am I going to be regular in the morning."
"notes: an ok beer, something I would repeat... but not that I plan to"
"Comments  Thanks to feloniousmonk for including this in a nice trade package."
"Orangey amber colored with darker colored flecks of protein in suspension. Fruity, biscuity, and caramel aromas and maybe a little bit floral in the hop department but not too hoppy. Smooth and well-balanced, fruitiness shines through in the finish. Drinkability is fairly good. I turned my brother onto this beer, a die hard Yuengling drinker. He doesn't understand the basic difference between a lager and an ale (funny how beer appreciation isn't genetically predisposed)."
"Nice looking beer, an orange-amber in color that poured a nice 2 inch head which left a nice lacing. The unfiltered nature of this brew lends to the interesting appearance. Nose is of sweet caramel malts. The taste was well balanced, starting with those sweet malts with a very light hop finish-a nice smooth taste. Mouthfeel was thin and gentle on the palate. This brew's drinkability was very nice, a good compliment to watching life go by on Deer Lake at Boyne Mountain."
"Medium body, medium dark amber color. Head quickly dissipates to a rim. Smells of subtle malt and caramel. Lots of carbonation. The malt and nuttiness is roundly balanced by hops with a quick bitter finale. A great amercian amber, though less flavor than I expected from Bell's."
"Uh, i'm in the Two-Hearted camp as always ... but maybe being nursed with this beer forever altered the place in my heart."
"Amber Ale is another tasty beer from Bell's. Although nowhere close to their best effort, its balance ensures that it will be enjoyed by malt lovers and by hop lovers alike. A good session ale that I wish was available in the Hawkeye state."
"Very nice. Poured a nice light amber with little head but very clingy. Light malty aroma. Light creamy malty swee taste with a hint of black currant, nicely offset with finishing hops. Surprisingly light mouthfeel considering the taste. Finishes a bit fuller than the start. Even though I prefer a hoppier beer, I could enjoy many more of these. Very well done."
"Pours a bland amber color with a minimal head. Ok looking beer just not my style. Smell has hints of caramel and malt with a little bit of hops sneaking up. This beer doesn't have the strongest flavor. It has a decent malt backbone but I usually like my beers with more of a kick. Drinkability seems to be high as this is not a very complicated beer. I guess i just haven't learned to appreciate ambers yet. This is not a bad brew i just don't think i will be getting much more of it."
"The first time I tired this beer it caught my attention. Bell says it's a ""cask conditioned"" amber which was unusual and demanded an additional tasting session! I was surprised with the cloudiness of the brew, almost weiss cloudy, but the taste! Slightly sweet initally with carmel overtones and a subtle spicy flavor that I really enjoyed. Hmmm, nice aroma, with a hint of fruitiness. Nice creamy head that made the experience even better. The aftertaste was clean, refreshing with a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and ejnoyable. I have moved this brew high on my list to a regular staple at the house for get togethers and have gotten many outstanding comments about this beer from guests. As the old TV commercial used to say, ""Try it, you'll like it!"" I totally agree!"
"Deep hazy copper color, creamy white head that leaves a layer on the top all the way down. Lots of sticking to the glass. Has a nice fruit and hops aroma. Taste is of carmel and hops. The bitterness is there, but not overpowering. I could difinitely session this one. Very smooth and drinkable."
"The scent and flavor are quite a mixed bag. I can pick out some yeasty bread flavor, some sugary sweetness and some apple sourness. And then there's a hop finish. There's a lot going on and none of it seems to blend together all that well. I enjoy it, but Amber Ale isn't what I thought it would be."
"The beer was poured with a thick off white head. The color was a light amber color that was slightly cloudy. The aroma was of a citrusy/fruity hop. The taste was yeasty with an estery taste with a bit of a fruity hop kick. It finished with a slightly sweet, yet slightly bitter flavor. But it leaves the mouth quite clean."
"I must say that I am amazed with this brew. What took me so long to try it? On the back it says it's Bell's ""flagship beer"" and I can see why. This beer pours a vibrant flourescent amber color with a medium sized white head. Good amount of lacing as well. Smell is caramel sweet and a twinge of bitterness as well. The body on this beer is thick, very thick for an amber yet quite smooth as well. Caramel is the main sweetness but I detect some honey in there as well. Citric qualities that mostly resemble tangerines are very noticeable. Slight buttery diacetyl and a yeasty spiciness come through. Hops aren't bitter but provide a solid base and background holding the body and other flavors together. The hops also seem citric and maybe floral as well. This is a real beer drinkers amber, probably too much flavor and too thick for most non-craft drinkers. Even though it is thick I feel that I could drink this as a session brew with ease. Well done!"
"A very drinkable beer with a nice even flavor. Definitely could have a few more!"
"Pours golden amber in color with a bit of an orange tint with an off-white head that fades into a pretty solid lace. Nose is sweet toasted malts and grains with some underlying notes of butterscotch. Medium in body with a bit of a buttery texture towards the end. Taste begins with notes of buttery toffee and diacetyl followed by some doughy and bready flavors with just the right amount of hop bitterness to balance everything out. A pretty nice American amber ale and certainly a beer that would make for a wonderful session brew. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the sample!"
"Drinkability: Another very well crafted beer. I wouldn't hesitate to have another one of these."
"in the end i have to say that it is a very good beer but a little less than i expected. it was like a tame pale ale and i'm not a huge pale ale guy to begin with."
"Subdued sweet start, some orange peel taste, sweet kick without being too overpowering, bitter chocolate-roasted coffee finish. Bitter aftertaste that lingers for a little while. Some hops to make it worthwhile. This would be an excellent session beer, I think. High quality and easy to kick back while still enjoying the taste."
"Served on premise at KBC. A little cloudy, and the color is a bit lighter than other ambers. A thin head. Good biscuity malt profile. Likeable, but really not quite the thrill I had been led to expect from a Bell's. But what the hey, Kalamazoo seems to be a brewpub heaven, on to another... and another..."
"Orange/Bronze color with a very thin and short-lived tan head. Pale and malty, with a slightly hoppy and slightly sweet aroma. Medium-bodied; Slight astringinent flavour with an ever present hoppiness and even the smallest of sweetnesses. Aftertaste definately bittered from the malt and suffers from the Astringent characteristics, but is not bad at all. Overall, this is fairly good for an amber. What kind of water does Bell use?? All his beer has a similar, almost erie, aftertaste."
"I originally had this beer at the BCCA Canvention, but didn't get around to reviewing it. Now I am, and it's as good as I remember it to be. A quality session beer, and the first of many Bell's I'll be having."
"Bell's Amber poured a golden amber with lots of big flakey particles, and a nice creamy thick head with nice retention - almost stout-like. The aroma was pretty underwhelming with some slight fruity tones. It was a nice tasting amber with a fruity initial flavor and a nice hoppy finish. Overall, a good drinking amber ale."
"Nice heavy amber color. Lots of sediment in glass, which is very appealing. Plenty of carbonation visible. Pours with medium head. Fruity, green apple aroma. Mildly sweet, with a thick/burnt toast combination to the taste. Slightly bitter. Malt over rides hops, but the hops which do come through are pleasantly received. Rest deliciously on the palate. The balance of malts and hops linger and fade away evenly, which entices you to another drink. Finishes with a hint of citrus, with a mix of straw. Overall, one of the most balanced, well tasting brews available."
"A vaporous orange on the pour with a bubbly and light tan head that is portly in size with a thin curtain of lace. Nose is butterscotch sweet, fresh and quite clean to the senses, the start quite sweet, nice malt profile and the top a light to medium feel. Finish is brisk in its acidity, hops mellow and pleasant with the aftertaste desert dry and long lasting, quite nice Amber Ale, from a World Class Brewery."
"Nice orange/red amber color, sticky head that stays around for the whole beer. Oily hops and malt on the nose. Taste is toasted malt, some sweet malt and touches of oily hop and that unique Bell's flavor...is it some special hops or special malts. I don't know...yet. Very tasty. This is by far the best amber that I've had thus far."
"This is a very tasty ale. Quite fruity (ala Two Hearted), but not very bitter. If I had access to this, it would be a great quaffer (first time i've used that!). Orangy tint, quite cloudy. Citrus flavors dominate, quite smooth and refreshing. Thanks for the sample, Al."
"Appearance: Orange tinted glowing amber hazed body with an off white orange cream colored head nice two finger sized head full thick and creamy in appearance, lacing is speckled through out. Aroma: Bready mix of sweet grain and yeast tones along with a very intriguing hop aroma especially for an amber ale earthy tones with a bite of citrus there. Taste: Great malt profile blends well balanced between the doughy sweetness, fuggle hops, and grain driven honey like sweetness with a brown sugar quality about the flavor. Mouthfeel: Sticky in a good way medium to fuller bodied for an amber ale, excellent carbonation nothing to knock gotta give it praise. Drinkability: Challenging amber ale I am definitely impressed by the flavorfulness of this if this is there flagship ale that speaks volumes about Bell's, they make flavorful beer, yum."
"Another Tip of the Hat, Sir to FM for getting to try this one."
"Drinkability: I can see why this is their flagship beer. Probably one of the best sane session beers I've had, second only to Oberon. If you need to show someone what pale malt tastes like, begin with this."
"Pours a flat clear orangish body with a faint head, moderate carbonation. The aroma is caramel malts and hoppy spice with a decent balance between the two. The flavors are also well balanced, malty sweetness followed by a moderate hop bite, a bit a green apples and sourness in the finish. The body and mouthfeel seems appropriate for the style. A decent amber ale, but not impressively so."
"cheers to feloniousmonk for the sample."
"ng"
"A nice balance of hops and malt make this beer easy to drink that finished with a nice aftertaste. Can't wait to try the other brews from this brewery."
"The lable states that this is the flagship beer of Bell's and it's easy to see why. Nothing fancy. It just tastes like a beer, only a good beer making it an excellent cross-over beer for the people looking to convert swill-drinkers. It has an orange-amber color with a head that slowly dissappears. There are flavors of toasted malt and very slight hops. It's mostly the maltly sweetness that dominates here."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this one."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy golden-amber color with 3 fingers of head. There is lots of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell has bits of flowers and pine to it, with a little fruityness. The taste is fairly malty with some caramel, apples, and a hint of alcohol. There is a bit of hops to the finish that balances it all out. The body is just a little above average, a little thin. The drinkability isn't that bad though. Not a bad session brew."
"Now, hours later, the beer is warm and less fizzy, but not a bad drink at all. A wild, crabapple tartness strips away the generous, packed layer of baked cake flavor just enough to reveal a slight aluminum nuance. A solid effort."
"Now appearing in a kitchen near me, thanks to Brent. Hazy, opaque apricot color with a thick orangey-beige head that settles in for the duration. Interesting aroma of sweet malt with a distinctive banana smell. Some hints of candy as well. Very thick and creamy mouthfeel, with big fat rings of lace stuck to the inside of the glass. Flavor is full, but balanced with malt, a bit of hops, and lingering pine and orange peel. Excellent beer, with lots of character for an amber."
"The flagship of Bells,pours a medium amber color with a nice medium sticky head,the aroma is is sweet with a good hop presence.A very nice balanced ale starts out malty sweet and fruity with a nice hop bitterness in the finish.A personal favorite and easy to find when Iam home in Michigan."
"Flavor: it's a very hoppy amber but it's offset by sweetness, too. This makes it quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is crisp & clean."
"A very nice, solid amber ale. Always a pleasure to drink some Bell's."
"Purchased at the Brewery's General Store on July 3, 2003."
"I had this beer on tap at Bell's and I really, really enjoyed drinking it. In fact, this is a beer that I would drink all night at a bar or party. In fact, one just wasn't enough as it went down very smoothly and I just had to have more and more and more. It ended up being a fun night at Bell's!"
"Ive had this beer a couple times and am quite impressed with it. Its a nice amber colored drink, good amound of lace left on the glass. Its got a nice sweet taste to it, along with roasted flavors. Also a hint of citrus is detected. This is one that i would recommend."
"This brew has a mild aroma if any at all. Its head died out very quickly. It has a nice amber brown color. My initial taste contained a hint of a fore taste that I later tasted on the back of my throat. It contained some carbonation and was a little watery in flavor."
"Copper colored beer poured with a huge, off-white head. However, it had a large amount of sediment chunks floating around in it. I've seen these before in other ales, and they look like little flakes of minerals. Usually doesn't affect the taste, but it isn't attractive. The aroma is hoppy, with a sweet malt aroma behind it. Smells like a sweetly scented flower. The taste had a bit of a strong pine note to it, with alcohol clearly evident. Surprisingly so for a 5.5% ABV beer. A bit of a sourness was present on the finish, with strong pine flavors as well. Very bitter as well, but in a bad way. Mouthfeel was decent, but drinkability was poor due to the off flavors. I'm presuming this bottle was of sub-par caliber. I'll re-visit this beer later in the year after obtaining another sampl"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a dark amber, with a small head that didn't last. Some fine lacing is present. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste is smooth and balanced. With a nice hop finish. Mouthfeel is smooth but there isn't much carbonation, but all in all a very good session beer."
"Poured to a chill hazed amber-orange color with a tan head. The aroma was of fruity/floral hops, sweet caramel malts. The flavor was fruity, and semi-sweet, with a bready malt flavor. It is a well balanced, medium-bodied brew that is easy drinking. A tasty brew."
"Bell's Amber Ale pours a cloudy amber with a thick puffy white head. Some sediment/particles were present, suspended in the glass (I've had this beer several times before and have never noticed this). A fairly persistent head leaves rings around the glass as it slowly diminishes. Very little aroma is present---a bit of hops comes through, and a hint of floral scents. This is mirrored in the taste, which is good but rather mild. There is a slight yeasty flavor in the finish. A fairly smooth, medium bodied beer which is pretty good, but not exceptional."
"Golden amber color with perfectly-suspended sediment and just a bit of carbonation. Head and lacing are minimal. Sweetness and floral hops combine for an appealing nose. Smooth, malty flavor quickly gives way to hoppy middle. Finish is surprisingly strong--crisp and even a bit warm. Another characteristically drinkable Bell's product."
"Taste was great. Some grainy (not adjunct) backbone. Nice malt sweetness. Just enough hops to make everything work. Beer had excellent carbonation. My only complaint (minor) is that the mouthfeel was a little thin. Easy drinking beer here. I had not had one of these for a year or so, so it was nice to revisit an old friend!"
"After driving 4600 miles to get a boat, and a pit stop in Chicago to get beer from Sams, this was my first Bell's beer that I get to try out of the variety that I purchased. It poured out nicely, keeping a good head, and had a good amber color with some cloudiness to it. Malty sweet and hop aroma with the hint of spiciness and fruit. A smooth flavor with a finishing bite that leaves my tongue feeling rough on the top. The beer is not overpowered by anyone particular flavor, with the malts and fruity hops balancing each other out nicely. The beer ends with a bready aftertaste. So far so good."
"Murky multi-shaded brown hue, a fingers worth of slightly off-white head, decent retention, some unorganized lace. Pleasant nose, fruity, bready, sweet yet tart, butterscotch notes too. Equally pleasant palate, earthy, bready, slight hint of spice, well-placed bitterness, the hops are floral, some sweetness interwoven. Fairly complex, none of the flavors outshine the others, subtlety effective. The malt only seems to grow as the beer warms. Medium-body, low carbonation, filling mouthfeel good overall. The finish is bready, sweet, earthy British in nature. Very drinkable. Thanks feloniousmonk for the bottle."
"Postscript notes: nose moves to caramel as the beer warms. Lots of cream sediment in the bottom of the glass. Please, go get yourself one of these."
"Coppery amber. A fair bit of flaky white sediment decanted, most of which stayed suspended, but the larger chunks sank to the bottom of the glass. Malty aroma, flavor is very bright and lively. Malty, tangy and moderately hoppy, all at the same time. Well crafted. A very nice example of the style - lots of personality without going over the top."
"This mildly hazy, medium amber beer was a true delight. The small head provided good lacing about half way. The aroma was fruity and sweet. Taste was clean and smooth, with a nice sweet middle and hoppy finish. Some acetic flavors were present in the aftertaste. A nice, easy drinking beer with good flavor and mouthfeel."
"Taste is very crisp and clean with a perfectly balanced combo of mild fruity hop and sweet malt. Oh, the finish is what got me going and wanting more, its a deep, earthy, even smokey, little pleasure that just gets slightly dry, and is just so smooth the whole way through its amazing. I just wanted to keep drinking it. Feel is a full-medium bodied delight, very nicely light and clean with that spectacular finishing quality I just had a weakness for. Great stuff!"
"On the palate, nothing but smooth, smooth, smooth. Malt looms large in this ale, but it's perfectly matched. Hops are tingly, tasty, and not quickly forgotten. I can see tossing back a million of these! Yum-a-licious!"
"F."
"Clear copper color with full white head. Slightly sweet, floral aromas and taste. Hops are citruicy, giving great aroma, and good taste. I have heard bad thing about it in bottles, but I drink it on tap quite often with no complaints. Really a great beer that everyone can enjoy."
"This is my first review, and its a lot harder then it first seemed.I hope it helpful, coming from the mouth of an amateur."
"I immediately notice lots of chunks floating around and settling at the bottom of the mug. The color is amberish orange and there is an ample, white head. The aroma is easy to tell that it's a Kalamazoo product. It's very enjoyably sweet, almost like a mellowed, less complex Two Hearted aroma. Malt sweetness is powerful and joyous to the tastebuds. There is also a citrus twang noticeable with the hops doing a great balancing act. This is a very easy to drink beer, easily an all-night drinker."
"Drinkability: Damn high...once they fix the sourness problems of late. I remember this beer being a lot better, and I hope Bell's gets their act together soon..."
"Very cloudy orange-amber brew with a big, chuncky head. Very balanced aroma consisting of spicy and citrusy hops, yeast, and malt. That nice balance carries through into the taste. Artful matching of restrained but kicking hops with the toasted, bready malt. Also, some esters hang in your mouth and nose after each sip. Carbonation is appropriate and the body is light enough for the style. Very well put together brew from Kalamazoo."
"Pale orange-amber color, nice foamy head leaves a nice lace. Cloudy with floating yeast. Clean mild hop aroma, very balanced medium body feels full on the palate, nice hop bite in the finish, a little sour."
"Like the Pale Ale, it's on the pale side for the style and has a similiar head. The body is a medium amber, but looks gold in some lights. Aroma is less hoppy than the PA and picks up some caramel notes. The flavor also has the slight caramel notes, but is still dominated by that crisp pale malt flavor (don't know what it's called). The hops are subtle to not there in the beginning but come out to give you a slow motion punch in the end. It's a very weak, friendly punch though. Seems like the hop blend is the same or similar to the one used in the Pale Ale, just in lower amounts."
"A very inviting looking beer.  Nice amber hue, just perfect for fall.  Hops are present, as is a clean malty flavor.  There is something very simple about this beer, but there is a rich hop note that clings to your tongue.  Very easy to drink and could be one of those ""anytime"" beers."
"Nice Amber color (duh).Thick rocky head, with great Belgian lace.  Very rich and creamy mouthfeel, with a smooth malt flavor.  Very well balanced, heavily malt, but with a noticeable hops bitterness to avoid the beer being too cloying.  Very easy to drink, and very well made."
"An exciting amber ale....a nice spicy hop nose...also some malt sweetness on the nostrils....orangish in color...cloudy...chunks of stuff flloating all over...beautifull!!  The taste is definitely dominated by the malt sweetness...but it is more of a Belgian style hard candy sugar type sweetness...the herbal hops lend a nice balance...I've had many ""amber ales""...most are OK but not real interesting...this one is veritable adventure in tasting...another dandy from one of the top breweries in the U.S."
"This is one great amber ale. Pours a beautiful, deep amber color with a sticky head that leaves big rings of lace on the glass. Has a great, somewhat sweet, but balanced malt taste with enough hops to back it up. It's got great body to it, and is fairly easy to drink, making it a solid candidate for a session beer. It's no wonder Kalamazoo sells more of this than any of their other stuff, and still, it's not even their best!"
"Nice surprise for an Amber Ale. I was expecting something along the Killian's line but this produced a hint of hops flavor I was not expecting, which made it taste like a hybrid of some kind. Very interesting. Rich color and good aroma. I am anxious to try Bell's other offerings. The only downside was a faint metallic taste toward the end. Not sure what that was about."
"Cheers to Deuce for the sample!"
"The dense, thick, rocky and billowy head tops a slightly hazy amber / light orange hued brew.  Quite appealing in appearance for an amber.  Signature slightly tart and fruity Bell yeast esters hit the nose at first, but light caramel malt and very mild but pleasant diacetyl butterscotch follow.  The hop nose is comprised of subtle, but earthy Willamette and/or Goldings notes.  Malt flavors are lightly bready and biscuit - like, while a clean light caramel malt sweetness dominates.  The well calculated hop bitterness is a hair shy of balancing the malt sweetness, leaving this brew pleasantly sweet.  Hop flavor is a touch earthy and floral and British in style. The body is more full than the typical amber, but still is light enough to provide for excellent drinkability. Bell's Amber finishes bittersweet, clean and w/ bready malt notes.  This is a flavorful amber, and could pass for a good ESB."
"The beer is cloudy deep golden with orange tinting.  Very slight head.  Not a lot going on in the aroma.  Some sweet malt tones are noted.  The beer has that trademark bready yeastiness to a small degree.  Pretty good maltiness, but it is not so huge with the caramel malts as some ambers are.  This is a refreshing example of the amber ale style.  Some nice little spicy hop notes.  Fruity tones are also of note.  Solid brew, but there are many other Bell's beers that I enjoy a lot more."
"Notes: This is an awesome example of the American Amber Ale Style, robust and very flavourful yet still not a problem having a few or even making it a session beer. Right up there with Full Sail or Anderson Valley in greatness in this style."
"Okay, it has a nice gold/amber color and creates a nice bubbly off white head. A little light for this style, but I beginning to feel this is what this company aims for. An aroma of malt and cirtrus. A flavor of malt, hops and citrus. A good beer, just lighter than I think this style should be."
"Man, this brew wants to ""rise", head like a custard with ""rocky mountains"" in the middle...Its a Bell's, so its murky but mostly grainy.  Aroma is slightly orangey with a little vanilla.  Nice smell...  Very rich taste, malts are big and last to the swallow.  A bit of butterscotch, satisfying body but also a bit of acidic hops.  Well balanced!  Big malt and a little sizzle, it has a lot of hand-pulled draught characteristics."
"Amber color was a bit 'washed out' looking.  Not as vibrant as I would like.  Nice lacy head that clings to glass.  Sweet (maybe a bit too sweet), malty taste.  Certainly not my favorite beer from Bell's, but definitely a good brew."
