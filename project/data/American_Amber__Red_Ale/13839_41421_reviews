"Incredibly malty. Doesn't hide the bite well. Imperial Reds just aren't my thing."

"Overall: This is not the red ale im accustomed to. The hop and malt varieties dont work together, and are all over the place. It also has a gritty and very dry mouthfeel; Overly carbonated. I love a great red, such as Nugget Nectar and lagunitas, but this is far from those. I thoroughly enjoyed Mongo, but im very dissapointed with this offering. It was actually hard for me to finish"

"A really by-the-book amber ale, lots of Westcoast hoppiness, rich malts, nice and balanced."
""
"Murky and overcarbed. Wish it were better."
""
""
""
"O: Maybe not my favorite, but not bad."
""
"If your a hop head this is a great red ale for you, I just don't like hops that much."

"Overall kind of a disappointment I had the Tidal Wave IPA and the Mongo IPA's both had exceptional flavor but this even though piney faded quite a bit with repeated sips. Very drinkable but not worth a repeated purchase."
""
""
"Had this beer during trip to San Diego, CA from tap (place called The Hopping Pig in Gaslamp area), it was decent, but not something I wanted to order a second time.  For an amber ale it is very strong so if you like strong red ales I'd give it a try."

"Hoppy red with a yeasty base. In short, the toasty malt takes a back seat. Very spritzy. Mild bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""

"I'm personally not digging the boozy sugary aspects, but hey that's me.  Has the imperial appeal that does have its fan base.  Kinda reminds me of Palate Wrecker in some way.  Nice abv that toasts this overall experience.  Decent brew nonetheless."

"A translucent copper colored beer with a red head, like my girlfriend. The aroma is sweet-hop  tied to some grassy flaves. The overall palette is somewhat  malty, but still with strong notes of hops. The alcohol % is a plus.  Subtle bitterness derived from the English Challenger hops with desired qualities from the  Crystal Malt give it a 'must buy more' note on the white board.   But folks, basically its a Belgian golden ale brewed with lots of hops, and heard that it was created for the brewers' wedding celebration.   I live on the coast near great white sharks, and this beer has nothing to do with all that, except the hint of blood."

"O: The toasted/burnt component comes across most but everything is balanced. Quite a tasty brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: A nice revisit as this one had really exceeded my recollections. This bottle was either uber fresh or Shark Attack is just way better than I had remembered it to be. Would recommend for a nice hoppy Amber."
""
""
"Drinkability: For every red beer fan like myself, I’m sure there’s someone who loves this. But for me, Shark Attack is just so, so. (Perfume-ey hops don’t anything for me)"

"Overall - Big smokey Red IPA. somewhat sweet and smoky and fairly drinkable. Another good offering by Port."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Body was medium as it should be. I got a little dissapointed on the carbonation though. Too much and lively for my preferences, filling the mouth with extra foam sometimes, which narrowed down the enjoyment of the beer sometimes. It did help though spreading out the aromas."

"Taste starts with caramel, then orange with a bit of grapefruit, then roasty toffee. Has a caramel/orange aftertaste. Has a heavy mouthfeel and slightly above average carbonation for a double ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This isn't by any means my favorite beer, but it's not the worst. It's not even that bad, really. That said, I wasn't expecting it to taste like this, and I think it's a bit unbalanced on the whole."

"O: Great drinkability. Port Brewing quality. ""California Über Alles""! ;)"

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the robust start of the flavoring. We began with a nice, toasty, buttery blend of pale and caramel malts, with eventual depth, grown from the plastic and boozy inclusions. These helped to flesh out the meat of this brew, and to hold up against the bite of citric and earthy hops with its own sweetness. Both the nose and the mouthfeel remain soft throughout the tasting, contributing equally to the final picture. This beer is actually quite representative for the style and well executed."
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good beer and a great beer for its style. Definitely a sipper at 9% ABV. Having this at 2pm may not have been the best idea."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a beautiful amber with a nice one finger off white head. Scents of caramel malt, floral hops and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is strong, with a high hop bitterness, mostly piney but with some citrus notes, balanced by a malt sweetness, there's also a bit of alcohol on the finish. Very high in hop character, with malt keeping it manageable, but still very much a hop-head kind of beer. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, with a thick, sticky feel, very good and akin to an American Strong Ale or a lower ABV barleywine. An excellent ale, it reminds me of Double Bastard, but with more hop character and less of the sticky sweetness."
""
""

"O: More IPA than red ale, although there is a markedly red tone to its color. Irish red ale crossed with a West Coast IPA. Too much bitter grapefruit for my taste."
""
"Overall, drinkable but a far cry from a top choice; we hold out for brews that are at least a 7 on our scale. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"This was a great surprise beer for me. I was drinking some Lost Abbey and thought I'd give this a shot since it's from the same area and it was great. The beer has some nice strength to it and doesn't leave you hanging. Nothing overdone as well, but at the same time, nothing revolutionary either."
""
""
"Wife stuck this in my stocking for christmas, Looked great when poured. had a nice medium red color. The smell was average. It was all downhill from there and then down the drain. This is not the the most hoppy beer i've had but mighty close. The mouth feel was fine, but the bitter aftertaste stuck with me after my next beer. if your a hop lover go for it. Otherwise go to something more malty"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- i really enjoyed this double red, i would def buy again and even order if i ever see it on a menu..."
"Mouthfeel is dry and somewhat gritty. Overall, this is pretty good."
""
""

"music - obituary : cause of death"
"Cloudy red beer with a soapy off-white head. The smell is a mix of spicy hops and an undercurrent of roasty malts. Some citrus and grass in the aroma. Caramel is distant. The taste is powerful...lots of warming and spicy hop bitterness. Some sweetness, but it's not really balanced. Full in body with a smooth feel. Doesn't hide it's abv, but it is still quite drinkable. All in all, this one is pretty good."
""
""
""
""

"O: A beer for the select that truly appreciate hops and the strength and intensity of flavors rather than subtlety and complexity. If the idea of being attacked by a shark could be bottled, then this is that brew."

"O - A bit overly aggressive if I must make a complaint. It is interesting being heavy on the hops and almost ""bleeding"" alcohol. I find it interesting for sure but I'm not sure that I would revisit."
"Pours a beautiful, hazy, nearly translucent amber-copper color. A very stubborn taupe, fluffy, foamy head forms. As it dissipates in an excruciatingly slow manner, suds cling to the glass like foamy glue. Toffee aroma with emerging notes of grass and pine. Medium-bodied, mildly creamy mouthfeel. Big caramel, a touch of emerging licorice, and some lingering hop heat late. Very good beer."
""
"When poured into a pint glass, the color was of a hazy amber brown, with a medium amount of tan foam and a load of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts and hops were evident in the aroma of this Red Ale. The taste of roasted malts and crystal hops were evident in the aroma. Also, there were a fair balance of sweetness/bitterness in this finish of this ale. Even at 9% alcohol, there was not that alcohol bite. Nicely balanced and nicely flavored."
"Overall - I like this beer. I would have preferred that the hoppiness would have been drawn back a bit as to not overpower the citrus and cinnamon, but nonetheless this is a pleasant beer to drink. 9.0% ABV packs a nice kick that is appropriate for a hearty red ale like Shark Attack."

"D - Lots of malt and lots of hops with an oddly balanced finish. The sweaty hops from the aroma are replaced by pine and a grapefruit note that works very well with the darker malt in the flavor profile. Overall a very drinkable and pungent red DIPA."
"Overall: This is a nice double red. Has all the characteristics of a good red, just doesnt hide the booze well enough."

"Pours a dark ruby with a bright reddish hue. Thumbs width khaki head that eventually dissolves and okay lacing. Aroma of toffee, some fruit, and alcohol. I dislike tasting the alcohol in this style beer and the alcohol is very present with each sip of this one alongside the toffee from the malt and some indistinct fruit. Some carbonation to the moutfeel, medium bodied. Overall, I was disappointed in this one. Way way too heavy on the alcohol presence and not enough other flavors to remedy that in any way. I did not make it through this bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Strongly hopped with a good strong malt base. Definitely worth a try."
""
"DOA"
""
""
"Mouthfeel is very nice also- medium heavy body with light to moderate carbonation. I'd get this again for sure."
"O- Looks great! Goes downhill from there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is packed with hop flavors but is rather well balanced with just enough underlying malt."
"O: Great beer for when you are having a hop head moment. I think the aroma on this beer is great and the alcohol is well hidden. Glad the flavor is not as intensely bitter as might be expected from the hop aromas. Very drinkable."
"Totally blown away by this beer. I have soft spot for Imperial Reds but this one breaks away from the pack. This level of sugary/caramel sweetness would be rude in another beer but the brewer has assaulted it with American hops to the point where it becomes most agreeable. I would have had more but would probably end up on the floor as a victim of this shark attack."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balance of malt and hops with some good richness from the toasted lightly syrupy flavors."
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy copper/amber with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some pine/herbal hops. Taste is pretty much exactly the same. There is a medium bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good red ale with some nice aromas and flavors."
""
""
"I think this would greatly benefit from a year or two of age. It is a slow sipper, for sure. The hops are more bitter than full of flavor. It goes straight from boozy to bitter, with just a quick glimpse of the malty goodness in the middle."

"Ive been wanting to try this for a while and with thanks to Beermasons i get to and it pours a very dark non see through orange hue with a creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is piney piney hops,boiled candy,grapefruit and ripped lemon leaves,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and coats the whole mouth with tastes of candied orange,marmalade,pungent piney hops and lots of them,graperfruit,lemon cheesecake,candy sugar,boiled candy and the finish is piney hop bitter but i find that the crystal malts really balance this drop out in a good way to just take that slight bitterness away and for me a really enjoyable American Amber that i could drink all night i just wish i had more of it cheers."
""
"O: I had this beer all wrong, it is a boozy, bitter, and very malty beast of a beer. This is not your hopped up amber ipa crossbreed. Honestly, I feel that it represents it's namesake quite well, both being a shark attack and a double red ale. Although I prefer the hoppier/less malty amber ales, I can't hate on this one for being different."
"amazing none the less"
""
""
"Overall: if you are in the mood for a hearty malt focused beer, this one will do it for you. Slow sipping but also satisfying."

"Bottle hit the shelves just a matter of hours before I purchased according tot he stocker at Parker Payless. I wanted to sample this while on vacation in San Diego but it didn't come to be at my visit to Port/Pizza Port. Anyhow, poured from undated (though I am assuming quite fresh) bottle to a pint glass. The beer pours a translucent ruby mahogany with a huge 3 finger creamy/off-white head. Amazing retention and gobs of lacing. Looks impeccable. The nose is quite hop heavy with a healthy dose of citrus aroma. Hints of pine and earthy hop character, though mostly the citrus you'd expect from the West Coast. A good amount of caramel malt sweetness as well. I really enjoy the aroma. The flavor continues on the nose with an initial surge of hop flavor as described in the nose. The beer takes a while to materialize on the tongue as all the flavors come to fruition. The citrus hop and medium bitterness are consistent through out. After the initial surge of hops the caramel sweetness enters and provides a nice compliment to the hop bitterness and flavor. I found the beer to be hop forward but relatively well balanced for the high abv. Smooth and full bodied. Good carbonation. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I don't know if it's just super fresh but I can't understand all the sub-4 ratings it's received. I think it's a terrific brew and would happily purchase again. Highly recommended. Hides the alcohol well and is very easy to put down."

"Fuller bodied than expected with a blast of dry, sticky hops that linger over the sweet malt backbone into a bone dry finish.  Very earthy and bitter with lots of dank pine needle flavor.  Hop profile is one dimensional and is countered by way too strong of a malt backbone. Sweet caramel, toffee and dark fruit notes as well as some zesty, peppery spice.  Some alcohol heat in the finish but abv relatively well masked.  The hop profile is one dimensional and theres too much malt for my preference."
""
"overall this was is good, albeit flawed on a few fronts and just didn't quite click for me. while it's not my favorite offering from port but i wouldn't turn one down, either."
""
""
""
"22 oz bomber pours a deep amber with fluffy white head. Smell is caramel with citrus hops and cotton candy. Very intense toffee malt flavor with peppery bitter hops. For a 9% beer the alcohol is very well hidden. Medium mouthfeel starts wet and finishes dry. I think I'd like this beer more if had more citrus and less bitter hops."

"This was a good beer, but the balance was just a little off."
""
"Pleasant beer; if that booziness subsided I could drink this all night."
"CODA: - interesting that I drank this being told it was around 5%. Now realising it is 9% removes some of the 'surprise big' factor in the notes above. No overbearing alcohol present quite clearly in the brew."
"Not convinced this works that well. Has a bold and interesting malt bill but a conspicuous lack of hop aromas and flavours. Seems only bittering hops come through to temper the richness and sweeteness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Personal note: The booze is strong with this beer. Greatness and uniqueness of flavor do not seem to warrant such high alcohol percentages."

"Trying the Port Brewing Shark Attack Double Red. The beer poured a hazy amber/red with decent slightly off-white head that is lacing nicely. There is some fresh hop balanced by malt. The taste is powered by a big malt with hop balance. The beer starts very malty then the hop come in to balance the beer and clean the pallet. I am thinking semcoe hop since it is a bit more fuller in body. The mouthfeel is full bodied with good carbonation. Overall the beer is very good....especially for those looking for a higher powered red ale."

"Medium thickness in the mouthfeel with an oily hop resin feel. Not extremely familiar with this style, but, again, seems very close to a DIPA."
"First time Ive tried a beer from this brewery. It pours a very nice deep amber color with a nice thick foamy head. The smell is quite nice with a bite at first then sort of mellows out. The taste is the same. It hits you with a ton of hops at first sip but goes down nice and smooth. The thick head leaves a ring around the glass. The taste is very well balanced of hops and malt. Overall a very tasty beer can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"Overall: Tasty, well done imperial red."
"overall - I guess I really don't know this style very well. I think that it makes sense to have a nice malt backbone to a Double Red. This is a substantial beer and one that although I couldn't drink a ton of, I'd definitely visit it again next time I'm in San Diego. Reminds me a bit of a larger version of Surly Furious."
"Very drinkable hoppy red. I'll definitely have it again given the chance, but nothing about it really wows me."
"The finish is very lightly hoppy for a ""double"" red. Not what I was expecting, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Overall very tasty red."
"Overall: Brash and heady, but it has some needed balancing components present to give aid in finishing off what is a big, hoppy beer brimming with alcohol."
"Shark Attack pours into the glass a very bold orange color with some light shades of bronze within. A nice inch of white stuff on top with good retention leaving spraypaint lacing. It does not go anywhere. Smell is on the malty side of things with sweet caramel and apple. A nice heaping of bright hops leaving a bold earthy scent. Some trace amounts of sugar. Sweet and earthy hops with some vanilla meld together with warming. Damn, this is good beer. Not risking a bottle, the draft version id bold tasting and caramel seeps through with some sugar. This would be a malty mess if it was not for some apparent dry-hopping bouncing off the sweet with some bitter dank hops that are both floral and earthy with sweet pineapple and papaya. I really like how this blends. The feel is to die for off the spout. A big bulky medium body with active bubbles going down. Pretty much perfect with no trace of alcohol. By god I wish I had a sixtle of this in my basement. It would be a once a day thing for me."
"A good beer definitly good to the last drop, but for me the ABV is getting into the defcon 3 area: use extreme caution."
"O- This is a very good double red overall. A slight alcohol heat lingers on the back of the tounge. Better for a fall/winter hoppy brew than the heat of the summer-but something I wouldn't mind grabbing again!"
"Final thought - at 9% and $5 a bottle. Being from Port Brew, this beer is a must. Plus I heard PB was discontinuing this beer, get it while you can"
"Overall, a nice flavorful red ale. It doesn't measure up to Nugget Nectar (but, how many beers do?). In the end, a decent interpretation of the style."
"A really good beer that if cleaned up a bit would be really excellent. I'm not sure if it was the bottle or what but It was sitting quietly in the fridge and wasn't jostled at all. I'd love to try it again a bit fresher (bottle date 4/2811)"
"The craft brewing scene is an exhausting race to a constantly shifting finish line; any lead is eroded quickly by imitation or superior offerings from competitors. One way to sidestep this is to redefine the terms of competitive advantage. Port Brewing was among the first to go HOPPY and, once others caught on, they were also among the first to go BIG. While most of those big offerings work, this one, not so much. Try one of their big IPAs instead."
"O - I liked this brew but will not go out of my way to seek it put in the future. I am happy to have tried it and would like to try more of Port's other offerings."
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed with Shark Attack. Perhaps it's the style that I don't care for. I think I prefer an amber ale to be more refreshing than I find here. I know that's not a very precise criticism, but it's all this newbie can muster. Maybe it's the time of year. I might enjoy this more in the winter."
"VERY NICE, WORTH SEEKING OUT!"
"Overall, the beer was good but I cannot recommend it fresh as it is just too over the top in alcohol and bitterness. I would like to see how it would taste in a year (or maybe more) to see if it becomes more balanced but the fact that it is not readily available to me (for a decent price) on the East Coast, I may never know."
"Pours a cloudy amber red color into my pint glass. About four fingers of orangish head rests above the amber. Smell consists of lots of caramel and malt. Mouthfeel starts pretty creamy and smooth and then ends with a bite. Alcohol taste and burn in the back of the throat. Not a fan of this in the least. A malt bomb with a booze finish. Poor attempt."
"Body is pretty thick and carbonation is fairly medium, but the alcohol strength keeps this beer from being overly drinkable."
"O: Good, but not great. Seemed like Nugget Nectar light light. Wish the hops had been a bit more present on both the aroma and flavor profile."
"Overall - At first the beer came across as a little harsh and boozy.. But as i made my way through the glass and it got warmer I was really enjoying the flavour. It's packed full of taste and I would suggest splitting a bomber with a friend."
"Medium bodied, fine carbonation, sticky and dry on the tongue. This is definitely a tasty one, although a bit boozy, but I was still into it."
"As with anything I've had from this brewery, it's got a ton of flavor but isn't a novelty, exhibits complexity but is also balanced, and is just totally delicious. ""I'm a shark fatality""...thumbs up!"
"The aroma was sweet, nice touches of caramel malts and an almost candy like sweetness that was wrapped up nicely in a bit of a grassy, earthy, hop like nose. The flavor was more of the same, but I have to admit I am impressed here with this. Lots of alcohol in the flavor here, a bit of a hotness that I have not seen in the rest of the their beers. Lots of grainy malts, touches of light caramel and a mostly understated hop flavor. Lingering taste of hot alcohol and grain left me hanging again as well as I really was expecting more from this here. then the hops come in and balance and smooth it right over. very nicely done"
"This is a great caramel/bready tasting beer that has a surprising, complementary hop attack."
"if you like bitter -- this is for you. but it is not a very balanced brew. this would go OK with a pepperoni pizza actually."
"It is a big, bold Red without apology."
"I really didn't like this brew. The balance was way off."
"Not an overly drinkable beer. The candy sweet malt and the muted hops don't make for a great combination in my mind."
"This is a great beer in a very open catchall category. I feel like I know what Port was looking for out of this beer and the vast flavor and aroma characteristics give the drinker something to think about and enjoy."
"D: The flavors make this seem lighter and more drinkable but the body makes it drink like a barleywine."
"Aroma is strong and hoppy, rather like an IPA, with hints of malt and herbs. It pours a clear, dark mahogany with a thick, fluffy, pale tan head that sticks around for a while. Flavor is fairly hoppy but barely bitter, and has some maltiness and subtle sweetness as well as a hint of wood. Flavor is silver smooth with a subtle tingle, and it leaves a bit of a fizz plus some hoppy hints."
"Sessionable? Heavens no, but if you're keen on imperial red ale, this is a fantastic example. Not enough to drag me from my beloved Lagunitas Lucky 13, but nonetheless an excellent bevvy."
"Great Red ale, was not sure what to expect but 9% abv I new it had to be big. Pours a huge rocky head very dark red almost black in color. The taste is exceptional, sweet caramel and a pleasant flowery hop presence a little spicy too!! I will be recommending this beer for sure!!"
"Thankfully the bitterness didn't linger or build, and the carbonation kept it fairly crisp. I probably wouldn't get it again as it's not one of my favorite styles, but glad I tried it."
"A solid red from the folks at Port. Try one."
"Over the top crystal and west coast hops give this beer a nice flavor profile. It's a little bit spicy and piny but with enough crystal to back it up."
"D - Not bad, but I won't pick it up again. Just a bit too boozy and sweet for my tastes, and the 9% ABV will sneak up quickly."
" ~ This isn't your dad's red ale. This is the red you should be bringing to a party or significant social gathering. This is one of the most impressive reds I've had the luxury of being able to enjoy. I suggest you get a bottle of your own and enjoy it."
"D: It was a sipper for sure.... but the most unique Port beer I've tried so far."
"The beer had a medium to full feel to it with the exact right carbonation. The beer was smooth, very creamy and very easy to drink especially given the elevated ABV. Overall, this is an excellent beer and one that I will be heading back to the beer store for very soon. So glad that Port Brewing made it to Georgia."
"D: Not quite as good as good as I remember it being back when I had this beer when I first started trying ""good"" beers. But, still one worth drinking..."
"Drinkability is pretty good for such a high abv beer. This is pretty darn good."
"Overall, while admittedly being a sucker for ""imperial"" reds, this beer exceeded my expectations. On-par with Gordon, this is a very good beer for the style and one well worth a shot."
"A pretty extreme red ale, but also pretty well balanced. More complex, interesting, and tasty than I expected. Enjoyed it."
"D: OK. The nose really hurts this one, but the dominating sweetness and then alchohol doesn't help the situation. I probably wouldn't recommend this one to friends, though I'm glad I got a chance to buy it (courtesy of Nejaime's in MA)."
"Poured on-tap at the Port/Lost Abbey Brewery. The beer has a beautiful deep, dark red-amber coloring with no head. There is a smell of caramel and hops on the nose, and it is nice and strong. The beer has a complex taste when you first drink it, with a blend of syrup (maple?) and hops. It is very well balanced, and the hops give the beer a very ""green"" flavor, which is odd for a red. The hops is especially present on the forward tongue. The beer remains smooth for the amount of hops flavors, especially into the finish, with a very light hoppy aftertaste. Very good beer all around."
"Overall, I remember this beer being hoppier last year, but it is still a nice offering from another great San Diego brewery."
"4.0 D: Overall a pretty good brew. No problems and good all around. I wonder what it tastes like fresh, but it's good now so whatever."
"O - In a long day of tasting, this was one of the unexpected highlights. I'll be buying more for myself."
"Pours a deep, burnt copper with hints of ruby and a creamy, off-white head with great lacing. aroma is great with huge cascade hop notes of pine resins, pink grapefruit, canned peaches, and light berry notes with hints of sweet toffee malts. flavor is ""wicked good"" with huge, spicy, piney hip notes up front backed by big, sweet, toffee malts, hints of passion fruit and sour cherry, with an herbal, mildly nutty finish. palate is thick and sticky-sweet with medium carbonation and a long, bitter, fruity finish. overall, a delicious, big-ass beer."
"D: it drank pretty damn good and I'm glad that I live pretty close to pizza port where I can also try some of their offerings that don't aren't bottled."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter a dark ruby red with a slightly off white head that dissipated quickly to a crown with a slight amount of bubbles on the beer. Smell is a good mixture of malts with some sweetness. Taste is much the same with a slight floral nature sneaking in behind. Feel is a good level of carbonation with a crisp finish. Overall a very good tasting red ale."
"Big and bitter as hell, but lacking the hop mouthfeel. Just super resinous, sticky and bitter. Underwhelmed my expectations. Alcohol was very hot. Was very challenging, and I like big brews. Not at all my favorite port offering, just hot, woody, bitter, but without any real appreciable dimensions and interplay. I might as well just take shots of hard liquor. Well, no, but this was below average for a Port beer."
"I was able to have a few sips of this on tap at San Clemente brewery. But this review is coming from the bottle. It has a great read appearance the lacing is heavey around the sides and remains. Smells of hops very nice smell even a bit floral. Taste! wooo very strong crystal malt flavor, very sweet but the hops quickly start to dominate in the bitter flavor department. This beer is grat at 9%! I'm a fan of anything that tastes this good and will get me messed up!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is good, it had some nice flavors to it and was a pretty easy drinking beer. I liked the hoppiness it had, which doesn't seem typical for the style but worked well."
"D- This was a nice surprise. Port Brewing to me is fantastic and have yet to let me down on anything I have had from them. Just wish they came to Indiana that's all."
"D-Pretty drinkable, a malty alternative to Port's regular IPA."
"Brilliant reddish amber color with a large head that hung around for a fairly long time before settling to a thick cap. Large amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. I smell quite a bit of citrus hops with notes of grapefruit and orange zest. This is complimented by the sweet malt. No hint of the alcohol. Plenty of malt in the flavor as well. It is needed to carry the hop load this beer brings. But it comes at a price, and that price is the alcohol. A lot of warmth and flavor that sort of spoils the rest of the party as it seems I can only taste the booze after awhile. It is out of place in a red ale and keeps me from enjoying the hops and malt. DIPAs can pull this off most of the time, but not this beer. The body is bigger than almost all others in the style and nicely paired carbonation. I am a lover of hopped-up red ales, but this one is just too boozy for me to enjoy."
"d - A decent amber ale. Would try again."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a crystal clear, red-tinged amber color. There was a very small off-white head on it that didn't leave any lacing. The aroma is pretty good. Some piney hops and a ton of malts. Some fruity esters hanging around in there also. The taste is really good. A ton of malts, without too much sweetness. The hops give a slight dryness to the finish to a slightly sweet start. Some caramel, dark fruits, very well balanced. This drinks very easy."
"D - This would be a very good beer if it wasn't so alcoholic in the taste I really enjoyed the rest of the taste I love big reds but its too hot for me"
"Overall the brew really threw me for a loop, I just didn't enjoy all the different fruity malt (and possibly yeasty) sweetness this brew had. I couldn't finish my glass and wouldn't try this again."
"CHEERS!!"
"Poured a caramel brown with a ruby red hue. Very hazy. Thin, small tan head that doesn't' last, but maintained a thin cap. Wet lacings on the glass. Big malt and hop aromas. Toasted malt, orange citrus, and pine in the bouquet. Citrus flavors in the beginning that lead to big toasted malt flavors and then back to citrus orange and pine. The alcohol is very apparent throughout, a bit on the sweeter side, and hit me quickly. Full bodied feel with medium carbonation. Enjoyed drinking this, but not one you'd drink too many of."
"Pours a nice, slighlty hazed ruby amber color with thin cap of off white head, decent retention and thin sheets of lacing. Scent is of huge piney hops and sweet carmel, backed with faint citrus and roast qualities. Taste is as anticipated, huge piney hops followed by a smooth, clean and sweet carmel backbone. Notes of alcohol combine with the pine to make a somewhat astringent tasting brew, faint citrus and roast cover it up only slightly. Medium bodied, bitter aftertaste and a dry finnish. Nice beer, a little too aggressive to be a regular drinker."
"Nose is very sweet - caramel and some citrus. Taste - caramel, grapefruit, piney hops, spices, dry roasted malt and alcohol warming. There is some interplay between the sweetness and the hops of this beer that initially wasn't appealing but luckily got better as I drained this. Mouthfeel - medium to heavy body with healthy carbonation in evidence. While I liked this, I don't think I could have more than one at a sitting."
"D: Decent drinkability. I ordered a second glass. With such big contributions of malts, hops and yeast, I am surprised by how prominent the alcohol component remains. It's just too aggressive for an amber ale regardless of the ABV. There are plenty of intriguing flavors and aromas that should, in my opinion, do a better job burying the heat."
"A: A light layer of thick creamy head, spots of foam along the interior of the glass, medium amber and with some very minor sediment - 4.25, S: Loads of citrusy hops - especially grapefruit and lime, hint of oak and/or woodiness, there is a dry subtle sweetness, a slight effervescence that reminds me of champagne - 4.50, T: Concrete hop bitterness, strong grapefruit pith, somewhat pungent, lots of caramel malts which provide a firm sweetness, alcohol is evident, what I perceive as candied sugar - 4.00, M: Medium bodied, quite dry and astringent - 3.50, D: A very big beer, quite enjoyable and drinkable - 3.50"
"Drinkability: Great mouthfeel but the pungent alcohol note holds it back for me. A good high octane west coast red none the less."
"Taste is immediately of an almost fruity hop, well mixed with malt, with a slightly bitter hop resin that sticks to the tongue. A nice beer that leaves me looking forward to the old viscosity waiting for me in the fridge."
"Drinkability: I went with a more moderate number here due to the higher ABV and weight of this beer. I really like the imperial aspect of the amber and think it's very much like one of my current favorites - Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster, just more boozy. An excellent offering and if I come across it, I'm picking it up again."
"Overall, this was missing something. Although it does present some raw and unabashed aggressive hop character, to my mind this needs to be balanced with something, and it was missing from the flavour."
"Anxious to try this after reading a good review on my daily beer calendar. Here goes... Pint glass pour with a hazy amber colored ale and an off-white ice cream thick foamy head that floats throughout the session. Hoppy, malty aroma with a candy presence and pine scents. Major hop kick on the initial sip followed by some maltiness and a kick of bittering, spicy hops on the swallow followed by a LONG, lingering bitter aftertaste. Major flavor in this monster! I like the overall bold bitterness on this brew. Drinkability was very easy as a bomber was consumed and two could have been taken down if I had another. Overall this is a beer I will be consuming again and a great take on the red ale category. Give it a shot and gaze at the sweet artwork on the label as you consume."
"A good dose of caramel and bready maltiness followed buy hop bitterness, a little grapefruit and alcohol. Overall a good beer but I would stick with some other of the breweries offerings."
"Very drinkable for 9%. And damn tasty. Nice hoppiness coupled with some tasty malts. Exactly what I want when i want a double red."
"Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Bomber into a nonic. Hazy, unfiltered, crimson-hued with a small bone-colored head. Pine and spice are redolent, it's like a fresh Christmas tree. There isn't much sweetness to speak of, a touch of burnt caramel perhaps, and a bit of juicy grapefruit. Very resiny on the tongue, the hop character is substantial with pine, red grapefruit and tobacco flavors. The malt foundation is solid, lightly roasty and more dry than sweet. It's a bit of a sipper, really; the combination of heavy dark malts, strong alcohol and even stronger resiny hop bitterness wear down the palate in time, but it's a fairly enjoyable beer. Reminiscent of fresh Double Bastard, but not as good."
"Pours a red amber with slight cloudiness, red hued tan foam, obvious carbonation. Aroma is hop-centric with pine, flora, and spicy notes next to a backdrop of toffee. Assertive hops in the flavor as well. Spicy, herbal hops as well as floral ones with rose and geranium. The spicy hops mix with the alcohol and this one is a bit warming with a cookielike malt and floral finish. Medium to heavy in body, maybe carbonation is a bit heavy, it clashes with the spicy hops a bit. I may prefer to drink this particular beer with a couple months of age on it to taste more like a traditional double red ale."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, I confess, as the sweetness of the malts tends to limit the drinkability for my palate"
"Bottle at Beer Bistro. Amber colour with white Caesar crown head. C-hop aromas. Taste of carmel and hopes, average mouthfeel and carbonation. Very drinkable, a good bomber to share if you are having just the one beer. Listed as 11% and obviously not, on bar menu."
"M & D - Pretty drinkable for a big beer. Bit of burn from the alcohol would keep non-craft lovers away."
"D: Very drinkable beer, almost dangerous considering its sweetness. Doesn't pucker the mouth with sweetness or hops. It's balanced nicely and is a nice take at a catch all style."
"Deep clear dark red/almost brown body, faint tan head, slow dissipation and average lacing. An interesting nose, citrusy hops more pomelo than grapefruit,balanced with bready and sweet malt notes. The taste is even more interesting, what appeared to be caramel malts up from took on a dried fruit, St. Anne cherry like ester towards the middle, and finished with a bit of spicy hops, not overly bitter. Mouthfeel isn't overly-crabonated, but need to be careful to keep residual yeast in bottle, really changed the clarity of beer on second pour. The drinkability is above average though a bit boozy, perhaps from the crystal malt cherry/winy like character. While not as balanced as Laurelwood's Deranger, my favorite Imperial Red, this is an exceptional beer. Worth driving from Beervana to the Couv for."
"My favorite red out there at the moment, until it gets warm. Keep this cool for optimum taste. I remember the first time I had this. I was really impressed by how dark and unfilted this red ended out to be. The smell really got me excited. It had that rich hoppy yet malty scent that most good reds have. The taste was rich and full bodied. The best red I have had in a long time. The mouthfeel was good. Not too carbonated but not flat. It was drinkable. However the next time I grabbed it I unfortunately allowed it to warm up a bit and it was hard to bear."
"OVERALL: This is definitely a great brew. A well balanced red that tells a story. Port makes some fantastic stuff, and this is another stellar one from these guys. Will be getting more of this one."
"22oz bottle. Dark red-brown with a thick beige head. Hoppy and sweet aroma. The flavor has lots of sweet, caramel malt and a good deal of citrucy hops, though the sweetness overpowers a bit. Thick in the mouth. Quite similar to the Yulesmith that i had the night before, though with a bit better balance. Still, just a bit too sweet for me."
"First sip reveals an average body and very mild and fine, spacious carbonation. Flavor is sweet caramel and brown sugar for a second or two and rolls to pine sap and herbal hops on the finish. Fairly bitter but distinct flavors can be ascertained each swallow. Not a very boozy beer even at 9.0% ABV."
"Man I luv these beers. Imperial reds, because that is what this is, are quickly becoming a major fav."
"Clear, deep coppery colour with an amber/red hue and a fine, light tan cap. Great head retention and lots of lacing. Decent aroma with lots of malt and caramel, citrus and grapefruit. Solid bitterness. Flavours of citrusy hops, caramel and grapefruit combined to give it a fruity sweetness. Medium bodied with fine carbonation, smooth, a bit creamy in texture. Overall, a good red ale with well hidden alcohol."
"Not bad. I had some homemade excellent peanut brittle beforehand so I guess my tasting apparatus is biased. Nonetheless. Poured with a smallish off white head and a bit of lace. Color is a nice clear walnut. Aroma is malty and hoppy. Flavor is fairly bitter and not all that well balanced. Some heavy dark bitter syrup. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is ok. Not my fav flav combo. Not so sure it'd work too well for cooking. Session beer --- mmm maybe, proly not."
"The beer is low/medium carbonated and has a thin mouthfeel. With that being said, it has just the right weight for the style which lends itself to a highly quaffable character."
"Pours an extremely dark red with a one finger head that has no real retention. Lacing is left even on this poorly washed glass. Smells and tastes pretty much like a Barleywine. Huge malts, sweetness, some hops, bitterness and an almost candy like smell. The malt sweetness is a bit too big for me. There is just nothing special here for taste or smell. The hops are earthy, no real citrus in here. Mouthfeel is pretty nice. Moderate body and creamy and matches the taste pretty well. Some alcohol warming compliments."
"Citrus and caramel explosion. This beer a bright, hazy red-amber with a creamy ecru head. The aroma is like a big citric American hop dipped in caramel. There's a splash of acetone, but it doesn't overwhelm. The hops dominate the aroma somewhat, but the malt comes out in the flavor. The beer is just the right level of sweet for its sub-style. I'd put this beer just a half step or so behind the wonderful Winter YuleSmith."
"I must say, 3/4 of the way through the bottle as it begins to warm. Its becoming a much smoother drinker and more enjoyable. Maybe i started this one at to cold of a temp. I don't know. Overall this is a decent beer. Nothing too overwhelming. I would love if it had a bigger hop presence but , it is what it is."
"Drinkability: Lovely flavoursome beer, with rich powerful flavours."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and would recommend this to someone who enjoys a brew with multiple hop profiles."
"D: Sure, you couldn't pound these back all night... but it's a great beer to share a 22 oz bottle with someone and slowly enjoy."
"Pours a hazy medium brown with a beige head that lingers. The smell is mainly malty, with some caramel and bready malts. I didn't detect any hops in the aroma at first, but as the beer warmed the hop aroma came out. The taste is caramel but also some piney hop character and alcohol. I would say the hops and alcohol are the two most detectable traits in the flavor. The beer has lots of carbonation in it, which works well for this style. For a beer that is 9%, this is pretty drinkable although I don't know if I could have more than 2-3 glasses in a sitting. I definitely recommend this beer."
"D: This is a nice red to sit with for a while."
"Do I like this beer? Well, sort of. It's tasty. It's challenging. But it is just do damned BIG that it becomes sort of hard to drink. Do I judge it on its technical merit, which is considerable, or do I judge it on how much I will be longing for a big glass of it at the end of a long day, which I will not be at all. Harrumph. Difficult to decide."
"A pleasing body coats the tongue, without being heavy or sticky. Drinkability is good but I'd probably get bored having more than a couple. Worth trying."
"Overall: Seems unfinished or maybe just not fresh. Out of a bottle at home. Seems like they just threw a bunch of malt+hops at this brew not really balancing out for a real style. I may just not be a fan of imperial red ales either though. Or it may be better fresh?"
"Trader's Note: Thanks again to RodBurg for hooking me up with this fine brew from Cali!"
"D - This is a big, bold red ale. The hops and malt are both vying for attention, and it comes across as a bit much for me. Not a poorly-made beer by any means (even considering the off notes on the nose), but I wouldn't seek this brew out again. It would pair well with a medium-rare steak, an English farmhouse cheddar, or with BBQ."
"Pours a very hazy amber color, it may be a bit of chill haze, as it cleared a little throughout the drink, but the second pour was hazy, and the tiny window of clarity was still a bit hazed. The head is very nice, big and pillowy, almost yellow colored, and it collapses to a nice little pad, which only surprisingly leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The haziness still gets to me though. The smell starts off with a bit of pungent hops - grassy and piney, with a nice resinous presence with notes of citrus peel and rind. But actually, the hoppy smells seem to get upstaged a bit by the malt complexity. I can smell a nice toasty sweetness, caramel, and even a sort of cakey smell, reminds me a bit of pineapple upside down cake, which really makes me want to dig in. The taste comes back with a bit of the upside down cake, too. But it sort of turns into something else quickly. There's a kind of sweet syrupy taste, slightly roasted and caramelized, hopped up with some grassiness, not a lot of bitterness, but plenty of resin in the taste. It turns back into cakey and bready tasting in the finish, along with some burnt pinapple and some lemon-orange flavor. The alcohol is noticable, but it isn't the same as in some other high ABV beers, the taste of it I mean. The body is nice and full. Almost too much so, but I really like it. The hops sort of help to keep it in balance, and the complexity is very good. I like the cakey feeling of it. The drinkability is good, I mean, it was very enjoyable to say the least, but it's a bit too strong for me to see myself wanting more. I doubt if I would want another one for a few days. But I would recommend it if you like hopped up red ales - it's one of my favorite styles."
"A murky cloud of reddish brown muck. The head is decent sized but disipates into a thin tan cover with a blanketing lace. The aroma is hugely malty and piny hop perfectly blended, thick and edible, sweet and serious. The taste is big and bold with tart piny bitterness and mellow chocolate malt in a thick flavorfest. There's grainy goodness and sharp alcohol licorice. This is smooth, a bit resinous, but powerful. Sweet but wholesome. Awesome job once again, Port has my attention! A little hefty to drink too freely."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed amber chestnut color with about two fingers of light tan foam. The head leaves a minimal lace on my glass. Nose and flavor are of sticky caramelized malt, alcohol, resinous citrus, lemon and grapefruit. A bit spicy which makes me wonder if any rye malt was used in this one. Sweet and boozy with a medium body and ample carbonation. Worth trying if you see it."
"The appearance of the beer was solid it was not quite red -a little darker- but it was close enough. Who really cares about appearance anyhow, you're not going to pour the beer into a frame! The carbonation seemed to be average for red ale: meaning that it has a decent amount of carbonation. The smell was strong and bold but what else would you expect from port brewing. A bold combination of hops and a strong mask of sweet malts are apparent by smell. The taste remains true to the smell. It was at first a tad bit sweet, it quickly turned to the taste of the creative hop blend; the blend was quite bitter but had a nice floral pine flavor to it. The malt was as sweet as the smell gave away. It had a nice balance of the hop and malt: each seemed to have equal force. Overall it is creative strong bold red ale."
"Pours a dark brown with a red tint... I guess. Lots of frothy tan head. Smell is exceptional. Potent piney hops, sweet toffee malts, and alcohol. Taste is sweet malts up front. Crisp toffee, sweet caramel, and ripe fruit. This is followed by a sharp, bitter hoppiness that fades to a strong alcohol. It's actually a very good blend tied together by the hops. I can't tell the variety, I think it's a combination of several, but it's very good. The alcohol aftertaste does take away from the drinkabiliry."
"Quite a strong beer and that isn't going to give it a super level of drinkability. Tasty beer but this is intense and quite thick, should only be drank by professional beer drinkers. That is only half in jest this is a Nitro Top Fuel Dragster of a beer, not something to let granny drive."
"Pours out a deep red, almost mahogany-brown color with a tan head. The aroma is highly of American hops and alcohol, but its hot aroma doesn't really give it a bad characteristic. The taste is also hoppy with a nice, rich maltiness. It finishes bitter. It has a medium body and is pretty silky in the mouth. A bomber goes down a little too easily. I bet Port could call this a ""Red IPA"" for marketing purposes haha. Anyway, it's a great take on the Red Ale that is so common on the West Coast."
"D - Quite a hoppy amber but with a huge malt counterpart. Good stuff from Port. I was expecting some competition for Nugget Nectar, but this doesn't come close, in my opinion."
"Overall: Although I'm generally prefer the IPAs over the reds, I find this beer quite exceptional. Cheers, cheesers!"
"Drinkability: This is a very large imperial amber, much larger than NN, YuleSmith, and others. I want to drink a lot of it, but I know my taste buds would eventually get worn out. I still can't give this any lower than a 4; it called to me."
"Drinkability= @ this abv. it's not a quaffer. However, the alcohol is not that present, the flavor is good, the mouthfeel is good. I like it."
"D - i was let down by this overall. too much booze and way too sweet."
"- Way drinkable and a must have... a favorite red for me for sure! Just smooth, and not nearly as strong tasting as it's stated 9.0%."
"Mouthfeel is bit thick and syrupy, low carbonation, which hurts the drinkability over all. That and the huge sweetness."
"Drinkable and Tasty."
"Overall a flavorful, and complex ale. Balanced and unified. Alcohol has a slight warming presence, but is well hidden. Reminded me more of an Olde Ale than a Red Ale due to the malty and musty quality. Hops lack the distinct sharpness I had expected. Certainly worth a try."
"Overall impression: Glad I only had to handle 1/3 of the bottle. Bordering on overly sweet- would have preferred some more hop balance."
"22 oz. bottle; brewed with a ""boatload of crystal malts"" and dosed with ""lethal amounts of hops."" It pours a dark scarlet, unfiltered, with light carbonation, and a finger of tan head that leaves little lacing. There is a heady aroma, with sticky/resiny/citric hops, pleasing caramel, a dash of chocolate, and a healthy breath of alcohol. Surprisingly malty later. On the palate there are faint fusels, lots and lots of sweet crystal malts, citric, tropical and piney hops, a touch of mint, and a long, bittersweet finish. It is sticky, almost sugary, lightly-drying, with ample carbonation permeating its medium body. Very hoppy, but the sweet crystals beat them down and help improve drinkability. Right now, the alcohol is a bit too prevalent, but this will probably mellow out to a nice barleywine in a year or two."
"Port Brewing strikes again; excellent beer. I've really liked every Port B I've tried, so I don't see any reason to stop collecting them now."
"D- A bomber is more than enough as the booziness really kicks in . I would definetly pick this one up again another impressive beer from Port Brewing."
"There wasn't a shark attack that day. Seems ironic, looking back, as though there should have been. But this is good enough. This beer is so original, so sublime. Powerful."
"Great looking beer. Dark Red color just a tad bit shy of brown. Nice billowing white headunky off white head. Big hop aroma, citrus and herbal notes. Lots of malt to back up the intense hoppiness. Hops are bitter throughout, mostly a white grapefruit with bitterness that lingers well beyond the clean, dry finish. This is well done, complex, and nice double red IPA."
"D- Eh, it's okay. I am a fan of the style and this is a decent representation of it. Worth a shot for sure."
"Upon revisiting, I'd say this is a pretty big miss for Port. Oh, well. I'll just have to drink more Hop 15."
"HV"
"D - Very drinkable, I love this beer. Very good red."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle. Poured cloudy red with an dirty white foam. Foam disappered quickly and left some small lacing. Good drinkability with citrus flavors and some bitterness. Good mouth feel. I liked this beer and would defintiely get another one."
"Overall - A pretty good brew if a little rough and harsh around the edges... not something you'd want to drink a lot of but certainly worth a try..."
"It's not for me."
"D= I really liked this beer a lot. Alongside Southern Tier's ""Big Red", I consider these to be my benchmarks for the Imperial Red style. Very drinkable!"
"Pours a deep murky crimson color with a slight beige head. Smells of some citrus hops and roasted malts. The taste is sweet citrus hops then a huge malt burst. The malts are very caramel and roasted flavors. The end is quite bitter also. Seems slightly barely wine-ish. It's medium bodied and low carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit oily. Over all it's pretty good. I think its slightly overly malty, I prefer more balance but it's good for the style."
"Drinkability - I'll pass on this one in favor of a great red ale, Brian Boru from Three Floyds. Too chewy and heavy, with a barleywine like feel to it for me. Oh well, can't win em all."
"Good but seems to be more of an American barleywine."
"Overall a good imperial red. Hides the 9% fairly well."
"Drinkability is not this beer's strong suit. It's a powerful beer that came in a large bottle and it is taking me some time to sip it. I do like the style, which is under represented, and would love to see more strong brown ales with a hoppy presence."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very crisp. Medium carbonation. The alcohol makes this one a bit of a sipper but at 9% that is probably not a bad thing."
"deep reddish amber with a creamy almost tan head. slightly hazy. nose was caramel and rum-soaked fruitcake. big sweet malts in the taste with an almost equally big spicy/peppery hop bitterness. full-bodied with a long, semi-sweet finish. warming alcohol is noticeable again. prickly carbonation underneath. overall alcohol presence brings this one down a bit."
"Cheers!"
"Ruby red color with a minimal white head that does at least leave a ring around the glass. Lots of caramel, toffee, and pine needles in the aroma. Hops are noticeable, but I'm not so sure about a lethal amount of them, especially coming from Port. Sweet caramel, toffee, biscuits, slightly toasty tastes, and a some citrus coming through in the finish. Thicker than medium body and medium carbonation. I enjoyed this beer and have to give it credit, it was very drinkable, and alcohol was non-existant in this 9% beer. Thanks to doubleo for the bottle."
"Bottle. Poured a dark reddish brown with a smallish off white head. Smelled extremely malty and caramel with slight hoppy notes. Tasted extremely malty, earthy with citrus and hop notes. I guess when I saw the label, I expected it to be a red similar to Oskar Blue's Gordon, considering it was overly malty and not hoppy like I expected, I did not enjoy it and will probably not be drinking it again."
"9/4/8/5/16 (4.2/5)"
"This is pretty tasty and I recommend fans of big hoppy ales give it a try. I am glad that Port is now in Chicago and can't wait to try some of their other offerings."
"They weren't joking when they said red. Rusty red, with maybe some copper highlights. What a color! Only a thin white head after the pour that quickly turns to nothing. What a heavy, orange citrus hop aroma. Its almost so bitter, its sweet. Great combo of heavily toasted malts and wet smelling hops in the aroma. Syrupy, resiny palate that plays well with the citrusy hops. Very orangey hops and well toasted malts with maybe a touch of cinnamon adds an herbal note to this beer. Sticky and hop stinky palate. This beer is potent and spicey. Long lingering hop bitterness after each sip."
"Original name is Shark Bitten. Clear, deep red with a short off-white head. Hoppy, citrus aroma. Good pine and resin qualities as well, with very little malt. More flavor that the Shark Bite, but still nicely balanced. Grapefruit, oranges, wood, malt, and a little caramel."
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a deep ruby red with a big creamy head that leaves just a slight bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma of the beer is grassy hops, tangerine, and a underlying subtle maltiness. The flavor follows suit with grass, pine, and just a bit of citrus coming from a very strong hop presence. The part of the flavor profile that I really don't dig is an over whelming booziness. This beer is really hot. Its 9% ABV really makes itself known. The mouthfeel is boozy, leaving a astringent feeling on the mouth. Honestly, this is a beer I won't be revisiting. While its not a bad beer, the alcohol was just too prevalent for me."
"Pours a murky reddish/iced-tea color, tiny tan head fades out very quickly, spotty lacing on the glass, and lots of tiny floaties in the beer. Massive amount of caramel on the nose of this beer, some juicy citrus hops lurk in the background...which is surprising, because on the tongue, this is one aggressively-hopped Red Ale. Huge tangerine & grapefruit notes, slightly piney, and a thick & chewy caramel backbone. Some heat from the alcohol on the way down, belly-warming....this is a serious brew here. On the lighter side of full-bodied, lots of lingering hop kick, and some mouth-coating/warming alcohol spiciness. This is not your average Red Ale."
"Poured from a 12-oz bottle, the color is a brick red, with a quarter inch of head. Smells lightly of malt. Taste is a big sweet malty flavor, with a hint of cherry, a bit of hops, and the slightest trace of vinegar. Bitter, bready aftertaste. Carbonation is just right. A fine red ale, very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent bev. I'm not a huge fan of reds, and this one didn't change my mind about the style. Still, it's very enjoyable. I think it got a little muddled, and would have preferred a more focused taste."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly hot with alcohol, and bitter cocoa. Citrus lingers in the finish."
"D- a great hoppy red. too much alcohol to consider drinking more than one in a sitting. the one i had to myself was finished rather quickly. im glad i picked this one up and gald to see port brewing on my local stores shelves. ill check this one out again sometime soon."
"Reminds me a hell of a lot of the Yulesmith I had not too long ago and it really helps me understand what Yulesmith was shooting for with their beer. They were looking for balance which is what the beer in front of me seems to be shooting for as well. Big sweet, cakey and pie malitiness, sweeter hop profile than most double beers, cherry, pineapple and pine resin seems to be the dominate aroma grouping instead of that familiar grapefruit/citrus bite. Taste is undercut a bit the bitterer aspects of this beer. Quite hot, sharp, biting bitterness that sticks to the back of the throat during the drying finish. Subsequent sips even out a bit but could be because my tongue is coated in thick hoppy goodness, but even so the malt bill begins to show itself and makes me much happier. Good lacing, nice cap. Nice and cloudy, deep cherry amber. Decently chewy mouthfeel, but I wish it was the slightest big more substantial. Drinkability is great, one of the better offerings I've had from Port, seems to be a bit more balanced, where hops and malt have a more even relationship with each other."
"D: Good considering the obvious alcohol presence. Hops, alcohol, and malt...gotta love it!"
"glad to try this. enjoy this style. compares favorably with terrapin's big hoppy monster. would love to have this on draft next time i'm in socal."
"A nice choice. Great brew for a rack of dry rubbed ribs. Worth trying if you can put your hands on a bottle. Just be aware of the alcohol punch."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good high-octane red ale that is quite similar to a hoppy ABW. Overall, it's a good beer to drink for a while."
"D: Not all that drinkable of a beer. It's big and raw but I still enjoyed it."
"D - This is not a beer for wussies. As advertised, this bad boy goes in for the kill. Will not leave survivors. Overall, good, but could dumb down the alcohol flavor and bittering hops."
"Evidently Red X 2 = Brown, because this Double Red appears cloudy and brown. Thin but wonderfully creamy head saves it from looking like...well, let's not go there. Big malt nose with some spice detected as well. Bold Caramel malt flavor with enough hops to balance it out. Medium to full bodied and easier to drink than I would have imagined."
"Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is on the light side, it finishes on the bitter side and has a longish aftertaste. Good stuff."
"Beer poured a deep amber with a smallish off white head. Nose is good; malty with a health dose of citrus hops. Taste is a whopping blast of malts balanced by a generous amount of hops - nothing overly complex. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This is a pretty smackable beer that i would try again if offered. Price was a bit steep as I can get a six pack of the Shark Bite for cheaper at Total Wine."
"Definitely scores for style, strength and substance... Too bad this one isn't more downable..."
"It's extremely strong on the hops, but nice. A little sharp and harsh at times as the only real drawback to drinkability, well, and the abv. Tasty!"
"This is one big beer, sip it like a cognac during shark week."
"Overall, almost an awesome beer. The flavor was a bit subdued and didn't do it for me."
"Would drink again but only because I already have another bottle."
"In conclusion, this beer is quite drinkable for such a strong ale. It is a solid strong definitely American beer. But not a work of art."
"Pretty solid beer overall. Nice balance of hops and sweetness but the sweetness almost seems artificial. Worth a try either way."
"Pours a cloudy dark amber color, some carbonation, small fizzy off-white tan head, some minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, some spices. The taste is slightly sweet at first, hoppy, malty, with some spice's. Medium body. Drinkable, this reminds me of a Arrogant Bastard."
"d - this would be a mouth killer b/c of the hops so end of the session beer. would be good maybe to have 2 over the course of a football game lets say."
"It was great. Definitely recommend."
"Drinkability- Like I said above...the hops really saved this beer. Sugar is nice, but this was a bit overwhelming. Not sure I will try again."
"Overall, Shark Attack Double Red is a solid brew that is worth seeking out. Recommended."
"Worth trying, but not a regular ale to keep around."
"Pours a hazy rich brown/red with nominal head, and only a few soapy bubbles for lacing. Nose-sweet candied fruit and pine. Taste- initially very sweet caramel and then a wallop of hops- grassy, woody and pine. Finish is quite hot and dry. Impressive dry finish considering the initial sweetness. Very little carbonation and lighter in body than expected. This is a balls out beer- no question."
"It's possible I don't/won't like this style of beer. I know I like Port's other offerings so I don't want to say anything unkind about this offering, but, what the hell, I don't like it."
"When a beer is big bodied, gooey, fruity, deceiving, and hoppy, but not bitter, I call it a ""gummi beer"". That's a good thing because I love that kind of beer, the kind that pleases your tastebuds while asking to be soaked in the liquid again and again."
"Drinkability isn't too bad, for a big ass red it comes together as pretty smooth and easy drinking, but with some decent complexity. Pretty good for tonight's chilly summer evening, it started out really good but got to be a bit heavy and rougher towards the end, ultimately leaving me with hobo breath. I bet it would be great if it were super fresh, with more hops cutting the sweetness of the crystal, I just got this today from the fridge of the store."
"D- complex and recommended, awesome imperial red"
"Somewhat hazy though very red in color. Quite the malty aroma with a bevy of hops to boot. Great malty flavor. Nice tongue stripping bitterness. Quite the heavy piney and citrus flavors going on. Great meld of flavors. Solid mouthfeel all around. Very, very drinkable BIG beer. Might sneak up on you."
"Is Shark Attack Double Red an Imperialized version of Sharkbite Red? In the end, the hoppiness and drinkability of the smaller beer is preferable. The malt sugars in this one dull the sharpness of the hops and take away the thrill of venturing into shark-infested waters. This is good beer, but hopheads will probably be frustrated if they're expecting their tongues to be torn to shreds."
"D: This is a big, bold beer. Very nice balance between the sweet and bitter flavors, and a great smoothness that makes it fairly easy to drink despite the big alcohol and huge flavor. Reminds a bit of Double Bastard or Yulesmith, although more on the sweet side than those two. Doubt I could drink more than a bomber, but a damn good bomber it is."
"Very Nice!"
"Drinkability was OK, and it was an enjoyable brew, but it could have scored a bit higher if the alcohol wasn't so harsh in the finish."
"Drinkability- Not 100% what I was expecting but still good. I was thinking Nugget Nectar but it seems like a bit more; both in body and ABV. Although I prefer the latter, this is still really really good. Pretty much another winner from Port!"
"Mouthfeel is thick, chewey and syrupy.ALcohol and hop bitterness linger on and on. Nice. Original. Good job ""again"" PORT!"
"I'm a little offended by the score so far for this brew; the BA hive mind usually pins a pretty accurate score. Sometimes I like something a lot better or worse, but there is no way that this is a B while Red Rocket and Hop Head Red are Top 10 for style. Shark Attack might have a dorky theme and label, but this is every bit as good as those two brews, and if you slipped the average beerdrinker a snifter of this and a good American Strong ale, say, Arrogant Bastard, I would be surprised to hear a clear, level-headed preference for either. Well done Port."
"Pours a slightly hazy red hued amber color. Poured aggressively, yields a shallow, light sugar dough colored foamy head that resists fading and leaves a descent amount of lacing. The smell indicates a deep rich sweet syrupy malt soaked with piny resin. Lightly carbonated and singular, but alive with tart hops, the mouth feel is medium bodied. Full flavored, the heavy malty sweetness is over whelmed by the bitter piny hop taste that lingers significantly. A real hop bomb; the 9% ABV is a quite a warmer. Definitely worth a try!"
"Not sure what I think of the new imperial red trend. It tends to cover up the things I love about DIPAs. But this is a good one for the style."
"Thanks goes to seaoflament, one of the most stand up BA's I know of, for this brew."
"Pours a rich dark purplish red with thin off-white cream colored head, ok retention and spotty lacing. Smells of grapefruit, caramel, toasted malt, bread, peppermint, pine, and alcohol. Tastes of caramel, toasted malt, and bread up front followed by peppermint, peppery spice hops, grapefruit, and spruce with a strong medicinal alcohol finish. Medium full in body with good carbonation. Bready sweet with lots of citrus and pine notes and a big boozy finish. Good flavors, but a little too alcohol tasting for my liking."
"This is supposedly a fresh bottling, within the past few weeks. Dark tawny/deep red/autumn colored beer. Nose is fairly nice, dominated by hops of the pine-like, resinous kind, with some malt notes of caramel. Flavor is also nicely hoppy, oily and bitter, well balanced with a malt character of caramel and honey covered fruits. Hop notes of resin, orange rind and dark grapefruit. It's not as hoppy as I was expecting, but it's a nice ale."
"Smooth and silky mouthfeel and a nicely hopped red ale. The toasted malts and the hop assertiveness make for a highly drinkable beer."
"Hqave had a number of great big red ales lately. I really enjoy the hop bomb with a nice balance and this was a good one also. Pours a dark ruby color witha good white head. Not too much carbonation, rather it is very smooth. Some decent hop aroma, but also some malt and bready smells. Good full flavor with some bitterness up front, but then a sweeter caramel or candy type finish. Leaves a bit of bitterness on the tongue, but again, very smooth and maybe a bit oily. Pretty drinkable. Could see this being a decent session beer if it were not for the 9%."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Pours a deep red, and a bit hazy. Decent head that settles to a ring. Smells quite malty and creamy with some roastiness and a slight graininess. Tastes creamy to start followed by a bit of grain and a substantial slightly soapy bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth and even perhaps a bit slick. Decent, and a nice lingering bitterness, but the slight soapiness is a bit bothersome."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and make this a little harder to consume than your average red. Overall this is a good beer, it keeps you wondering whether it is a big red ale, DIPA, or a Barleywine. I like this quality. If you can find it pick it up."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head over the clear red brew. Head is promptly down to a skimmy uneven layer of bubbles, with average to good lacing. Aroma is sweet maltiness, piney hops, and ample alcohol. Taste is hoppy bitter from beginning to end, with undertones of sweetness at the beginning, and alcohol warming towards the end. Mouthfeel is smooth, but drinkability is limited by overhopping. A victim of too much hops just to be bitter, and not leaving much room for flavor to be appreciated."
"D: 9% is pretty hefty and a highly exposed alcohol sting definitely lowers things further. Tasty but I don't think it could ever replace Nugget Nectar or Red's Rye. Thanks again for the trade, Mike :)"
"D: not bad but i probably won't revisit. My first ""disappointment"" with Pizza Port/Lost Abbey"
"Hmmm, I hate to say it but this was a complete disappointment for me. A little too much of some character and not enough of others helped make this one big sticky mess to the point that I had trouble just finishing my half of the bottle. A rare miss for me from Port Brewing."
"Drank easy but the dryness & ABV would put me off after a few pints"
"D- I have never had a double red, so I don't have a comparison. I do like this one, but the etoh heat is a bit much for me to drink more than this 22 oz."
"Tasty brew that is surprisingly strong and maybe even a bit too drinkable at 9%. Goes down too easy."
"I was a bit disappointed with this one. I was expecting a red beer, not an IPA brewed with red malts. I also felt that sea water was used to brew this beer, it almost seemed salty. I wasn't too happy with this beer. Don't get me wrong isn't too bad an IPA, but when you read red ale you don't expect to be drinking their Hop 15 brew. I think I will have to give this beer a second chance with the knowledge that it will be an IPA instead. Enjoy it though, Port Brew makes some pretty tasty beers."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer, but being simply good makes it one of Port/Lost Abbey's weaker brews. It's also a beer that doesn't seem like it needs such a high ABV to taste the way it tastes."
"The characteristics of this beer is dark copper, some decent lacing on the sides of my S.N. pint glass and minimal head. I like it, although it is a little on the heaveir side. Returned from a trip and cracked it open before eating, and its 9.0% did have its effect. I would definitely like to drink this after a great meal or at either location with a pizza. It has a great taste going down, and a decent taste afterwards. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle bought at B.M. Would definitely buy again and get on tap at either PP in SD county."
"I could be convinced to purchase a 4th, at least."
"Drinkability - This is a big dissappointment. I must have gotten a bad bottle. Doesn't seem like it met the quality standards that I expect from Port. I will have to get another bottle and re-review. Some form of carbonation would have saved this beer."
"Not one I would pick up again from Port Brewing. I really like the things I've tried from them but this just doesn't do it for me."
"D: At 9%, this is a good nightcap. The flavors are big and tend to wear out the tastebuds quickly."
"Big ups to SacodeToro for hooking me up!"
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability. Loses points for the strong bitter taste and noticeable alcohol. Not too bad overall."
"Pours a ruby red and amber color, very small gathering of tan foam quickly dissipates. Sweet juicy hops hit the nose right away. A blend of sweet tangerine, cotton candy, berries and pine and alcohol as well. Taste shows a bit of the berry and citrusy sweetness up front, a big chewy caramel maltiness is cut by a piney bitterness that slowly grows to a peppery zing. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, fairly low level of carbonation allows the larg malty body to feel heavy on the tongue, what carbonation there is lends to a somewhat creamy body. Hoppiness is both peppery and drying on the tongue and an alcohol warmth is noticeable in the finish. A good beer, very drinkable but very sweet as well as the low carbonation really allowed the big maltiness to feel heavy on the tongue. The hops helped balance and the 22ozs was gone without any trouble."
"This beer was somewhat drinkable but I wouldn't recomend drinking the whole 22 oz by yourself. I passed it around the table to 7 different people and it came back half full, so I dumped the rest of it in my roomates glass when he wasn't looking."
"I decided to track this down because I am really digging this style lately thanks to Yulesmith, Dead by Dawn, Gordon, and Red Devil. The color is no surprise, reddish-amber with almost no head. The intiial aromas are of pine needles, not cones, serious hops. There is a slight caramel aroma as well. The taste is a blast of green, leafy hops that I enjoy. I cannot seem to find the malt backbone to this beer, just blistering hops. There is some astringency in the mouthfeel that needles the palate. Overall, a nice flavor and aroma but a sipper due to the ABV/mouthfeel."
"D: Goes down quite easy and does a really good job at hiding the 9% that it packs comes at a pretty decent cost as well. High marks here."
"Probably not going to seek out more, but totally worth trying."
"Not a bad beer at all, but not something I could drink too often."
"D: This is a very drinkable red ale. Very tasty, very balanced, and with the alcohol being so hidden, it could be easy to drink a few of these without even realizing it. A very tasty brew from Port Brewing."
"Drinkability is high, this is a nicely balanced amber ale with big malt and hop presence (Malt/Hop Bomb!), alcohol is well masked, I'm a fan of Imperial Red Ales and could drink this one all night long!"
"Recommended. Far from the best Tomme has put out, but solid nonetheless."
"NOTE 7.25.13 Trying it again. Nice head, good carb, beer is tasting pretty good!"
"Very enjoyable."
"And with those 4 faults, you know what? This is one really good beer. I like it a lot more than it's cousin, Sharkbite Red. Highly recommended."
"Pours a dark ruby with a tiny paper thin off white head that quickly turns into nothing. Lacing is weak too, not much stickiness to speak of what so ever. Smell is rich caramel malt and big slick pine aromas. Strong booze and earthy hops find their way in the nose as well. I don't really enjoy the smell of this one either. Alcohol flavors up front really seem to linger for a while and distract from the other flavors. Underneath the big booze taste is some gritty hops, dry grass, metallic notes, and oily rich malts. Could use some citrus hop sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick with a flat carbonation, not a very enjoyable combination. Very difficult to drink with the alcohol all over the place. I'm pretty disappointed with this one. I've really enjoyed all of Port's beers up until I gave this one a try. Not sure if I can finish this beer to be honest, but at least there's some Nugget Nectar in my fridge, a true ""Imperial Amber""."
"D: A nice beer from Port, not a beer I'd seek out, but I'd drink it anytime it was offered, a quality product."
"Sharbite Red is a decent beer and this hyped up version is a little too strong malty for my taste, overwhelming on my palate at times, cool artwork nevertheless, nice description on the bottle about whether or not you are worthy to be in the ocean or not too, would like to try again some time, maybe even on tap, recommended for fans of bold red ales"
