AROMA: floral hops mesh with caramel malts; sweet confectioners’ sugar is front and center ... PALATE: medium-bodied, chewy and active--a pub draft, in its consistency... TASTE: strong malty presence; mellow hops roll off the teeth and take a backseat to the nutty, somewhat buttery aftertaste--a confident offering...OVERALL:a pint for conversing over or eating pubfare with--a sessionable beer that sits well in the Bell’s sampler case...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2014"

3.94,2.9,4,3.75,4,4,4,"This offering pours a deep burgundy color with a small off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is subtle but pleasant with a nice balance of malt and hops as well as an underlying alcohol note. It sips smooth and clean with a light to medium body. The flavor is pleasant and quite balanced between the sweetness of the malt and the bitterness of the hops. This is definitely a beer that you could sit and drink a number of and enjoy each one. Not particularly complex or remarkable but very balanced and damn good.","lochef81","Mar 04, 2014"

3.8,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.75,4.5,4,"Spicy hops and rigorous toastiness melds in with rich amber malts. The maltiness is pretty dominant, yet curt on by-flavors, in an American way. Crispiness from the hops pulls out interesting hints of brown sugar and almost cinnamon or clove from the steeped grains. Hardly noticeable is any alcohol. Hops are more spicy and floral than anything else, however, there is a backdrop of citrus pith. No sweetness from the hops, and only a malty sugar sense from the fermented grain remains with still-persistent dryness. Fuller-bodied for an amber ale. A lot went into this beer to produce a fantastically clean, refined, and simple beer. Bell's Amber offers a solid-bodied drink with a crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that really pulls out all of the quality ingredients in their naked simplicity. Good.","thecheapies","Nov 25, 2013"

If I dive right in I can get some light caramel and bread and the faintest hop floral. Taste is mild. The grain is toasted to amber perfection and has a nice round and full flavor that presents a natural sweetness but the caramel is almost too faint to be observed on the palate. it tastes like whole grain bread. As it warms it starts to develop a hop floral that is a bit sweet on the nose and in the drink. It has soda like carbonation so quite strong. It finishes with a bit of bitter but mid palate it's just bland. It could have used more malt depth and more malt sweetness. The body of the beer is thin and has a bit of slickness to it. Finishes semi dry with an aftertaste of flaked cereal grain. There is a hint of citric tartness also int he finish but it seems like too little , too late.","utopiajane","Nov 19, 2013"

My expectations weren't too high, which made it all the better. It looks good, and smells great, but that's just the start. Slightly hoppy, slightly bitter, slightly smokey, great feel.

But that's what their goal was, make a great well balanced beer that you can enjoy in almost situation. I wouldn't say seek it out, but it's widely available and cheap and you will not be disappointed. Perfect summer beer.","Roman5150","Jun 06, 2013"

Some sediment and better than average carbonation. Very nice nose of malt and resin with a touch of caramel. Taste followed the nose with good bread and some grass. No aftertaste to speak of from this light to medium-bodied brew, tasted toward the back of the mouth. One of the better beers I've tasted recently. They call it the flagship of Bell's and while I haven't had the coveted ""HopSlam"" yet, it's the best Bell's offering I've had.","maleman","Apr 15, 2012"

Not of toasted and bready malts in the nose and some sweet fruity malts in the taste. Very easy to drink, could see a lot of non-craft beer drinkers enjoying this. Wouldn't buy it too often but worth checking out.","mdfb79","Mar 19, 2012"
3.62,-5.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours a rich amber with a thick, frothy khaki head. Wonderful retention and lacing, shockingly so for an amber. A nice sweet bready aroma mixed with a little fruit. A sweet and smooth flavor. Sugary, toffee, a little banana, bread, and a touch of lemon. I usually dislike toffee but they do a nice job with it here, it isn't too strong and dominating. A creamy medium bodied to this, not too much carbonation. A very representation of an an amber, though not my favorite amber I have tried. I've long been wanting to check out some Bell's offerings so glad to have finally tried something by them. Still wish it could have been 2 Hearted instead though!","denver10","Mar 19, 2012"

3.96,3.4,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Deep copper hue, a little haze, but a great head that starts out fluffy and then collapses in on itself to stick around and stay thick. Malt and a bit of bread on the nose, I wouldn't mind a little bit of hops and some more complex grainy character. Incredibly delicious beer - the bread shows up here, and so do the hops, the malt doesn't bail. Wow. This beer has a great depth of flavor, and remarkable interplay and balance in the elements of its taste. A real pleasure to drink, decent bodied but doesn't require chewing, carbonated but doesn't try to jump back up your throat. Overall, a terrific example of what basic American microbrewing is at its best. It doesn't need to be crazy hoppy. This is a well-balanced, totally thought out beer. That being said, it is simply not the type to knock your socks off and be a once-in-a-lifetime. That's ok by me -- I'll happily keep this in my mental list of go-to basics for the rest of my life.","kc44","Mar 18, 2012"

On the nose, there are aromas of caramel, grain, toasted malts, and hints of fruit and pine. The flavor is balanced between moderately sweet caramel malts and earthy, piney hops. The finish is moderate in length, with toasted grain. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and soft carbonation.

Color is a clear honey amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is malt, beer, and a little roast, hop, and fruit. Flavor is similar to nose with just a little sweetness to balance the carbonic tang and slight roast and hop. Body is superb, with excellent carbonation.

4.46,16.4,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall I thought this was an excellent Amber Ale. This beer is exactly what a great Amber Ale should be light, great balance between malts and hops, great looks, great mouthfeel, and great drinkability. I could have drank a six pack of this in a sitting, its got good flavor and it goes down so smooth that I can't help but want to grab another one. This is also a great beer to have with dinner and goes great with a steak or a bratwust. What I like most about this beer is pretty much everything, it looks good, it smells good, it tastes good, and it feels good, its firing on all cylinders. There isn't really anything I don't like or would change about this beer, it is fine just the way it is. I will be buying this beer again as I have for a while now, it's a great example of it's style and I will always have room in my fridge for a six pack. This beer should be tried by everyone, and if you love Amber Ales, this is one of the best widely available ones. So far this has been the best Amber Ale I have had, it has the right amount of balance that to me makes the perfect Amber Ale. Bell's really does a great job at making a beer to style with great balance, I find a lot of Amber Ales are either malt forward or hop forward, but this beer was right in the middle and that is how it should be done, other brewers need to take note.","StoutHunter","Nov 03, 2011"
3.63,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a classic Amber Ale. The beer poured out with a nice reddish looking color with a pretty good looking head on top that isn't afraid to stick around for a little while. The smell of the beer is well balanced between the hops and malts. The taste of the beer was pretty good too, much like the nose. There are plenty of hops and malts working together to make this a nice drinkable beer. The mouthfeel isn't overwhelming at all it's drinkable and easy to have a few in a sitting if you want to. Overall this beer is worth trying I think.","Knapp85","Nov 02, 2011"

3.88,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"My boyfriend strongly dislikes the new bottle art. That said, it's a good beer. Hazy amber with a huge head and a floral hops/bready malts kind of nose. Taste is caramel, biscuit, some nice zingy lemon/floral hops. Perfectly carbonated and creamy mouthfeel. Nothing standout but really a solid amber.","lstokes","Oct 26, 2011"
4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"It's deep, hazy amber color reminds me of cider, and it's frothy head retains shape similar to a nice cafe latte. The aroma smells of fresh baked bread with a hint of juicy grapefruit hidden beneath. When tasting the beer there is a nice balance of malt, grains, tropical fruit, and a piny zing towards the end. Reasonably full mouth feel - while it is not 'thick' it coats the mouth pleasantly. A good beer for any time.","Neorebel","Oct 25, 2011"

The nose is mildly sweet with notes of honey, caramel, crackers. Hops are surprisingly absent in the nose. Again, sort of boring. Nice medium chew to the body. Decent carbonation level backs it up and carries it through to the end. Have I become jaded by all the highly-hopped Ambers out there? This one comes across as mellow, albeit flavorful. Lots of sweet malts, mild hop bite, bready finish. There's a faint citrus tartness to it on the back end, but it's fleeting. All-in-all this was a good beer.

The hops tingle on the palate upfront, but don't really leave much residual bitterness. It's a solid beer tastes great, very few people would find something wrong with this tasty yet simplistic beer.

3.68,-3.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"Bell's Amber pours surprisingly light for a so called amber ale, much closer to a burnt tangerine. Two fingers of fluffy white head rises up, and then fall by half before holding for a while. Lacing is serviceable, but nothing to write home about. Nose is pretty much devoid of hops, which I guess is to be somewhat expected with an amber that's approaching its ""best by"" date (listed on the Bell's website as six months after bottling), but there's definitely still some caramel and biscuit floating around. The hops are still appreciable on my palate though. The previously mentioned malty flavors lead things off, and a gentle suggestion of bitterness fades into a bitter grapefruit and pine finish. This beer is undoubtedly a bit hoppier fresh, but tastewise I think I like it with a more subdued hop influence. Body is solid, but not overwhelming, though the brisk carbonation is a nice touch. Overall I found myself reaching for synonyms for decent a lot while writing this review, and that's a good way to describe Bell's Amber. It's clearly a well made beer, but one that didn't wow me in any way.","axeman9182","Oct 19, 2010"

The body is a solid medium, appropriate to the degree of sweet malts. Every bar in the country should have this brew available. I really stand behind this beer, not just in defense of microbreweries and the culture of better beer, but for the fact that it is extremely drinkable, and could definitely be appreciated by the most close-minded, light beer aficionado.

A lighter bodied red, the hops are rather subdued as this beer passes smoothly and slickly over the tongue, leaving off sweet malt tastes as it goes does. Caramel and roasted/toasted malts mostly, along with some other bitter sweet (chocolate) vibes are balanced (not evenly) with citric hops and the beer finishes w/ a crisp, hoppy backbite.

A massive head sits on top, and is slow to collapse, but still the color is getting me. I want to see more red/amber colors. The smell is of biscuit, bread very full, a bit of sweetness. Great maltiness in this one. Then there is this orange smell, with some resinous hops, bitter citrus rind. The taste really kind of stands out. There is a really pleasant tart cherry taste which I like, a great maltiness, thick and bready, kind of a powdery dry bread, like crackers. Then a herbal, leafy finish of hops. This is a bit like a soda, but I'm loving it. The fruitiness is very nice. I wish it were just a bit more beery. The taste is a little watery, less than impressive, particularly for a style than can be built up to be quite malty. The carbonation is nice, though. An enjoyable beer.

Murky glow to the bronzed orange to red brick color, holds the light inside of it nicely and retains hue fully to the rims. Crisp, almost forceful, nose without ever seeming exaggerated, rye and wheat with a touch of pumpernickel, steady lowgrade mixed citrus notes, apricot, nectarine and mango fruit scents without the excess juiciness, too erect to be smooth or creamy, same for bitter, just smells like an unadorned beer. Medium-bodied, lots of carbonation, however, unveils itself at a slow pace. More of a thick skeleton than dense flesh, tangerine and mandarin orange citrus along with floral tea scents come out first. Then the apricot, peach fruit, less tropical here in the mouth. The breadiness is fully baked with a thick crust. The malts never rise over a certain basic presence. The hops don't take advantage, content to stay in proportion to the former.

Bell's Amber is a quite good amber with a fresh full feel and a balanced earthy flavor. The color is spot on for an amber, whatever that means, but the head dissipated quickly and left little lacing in my DFH glass. The smell is bready and full of caramel malt. The flavor strikes an interesting balance between spicy, earthy hops and doughy, sweet malt. The feel is thicker and fuller than expected. It's rather chewy. There's some apple or raisin note in the background. Bell's Amber Ale is an enjoyable, sessionable and solid beer. Quick edit: I'm actually going to bump my taste score up a half notch. The malt flavor is really growing on me.","popery","Mar 06, 2009"

Good sweet scent, hints of rice, sugar, and caramal, along with a great tart aroma; the scent reminds me more of an Irish red than an American red. The taste, though, is more American; though there is a bit of Irish tart, it's mostly a great blend of malts and hops, sweet at first with a nice hit of bitterness as you finish each drink. Gets better with each taste. Goes down very smooth, if a bit overcarbonated. Excellent beer.","JamesS","Mar 05, 2009"

Sweet drizzly malts like molasses and citrus hops. The taste is stunningly good. Perfectly balanced; complex malts with flavors ranging from tropical fruit to toffee, toasty goodness backed by equally complex hops that span the floral spectrum and with a touch of oranges. Extremely tasty. Medium body is sticky; its flavors linger long. I could become a evangelist for this brew. Exceptionally good taste in an eminently drinkable beer.","droomyster","Jan 29, 2009"

Sugary, busicuity maltiness greets the tongue, almost want to say there is a touch of maple syrup splashed in among the caramel sweetness and slightly toasted aspects of this beer as well. A soft, estery hop profile lingers in the background and only gives off seblances of bitterness. The only thing that really bugs me about this beer is that it tends to get a little grainy near and into the finish. A new sip is needed to clense this away but after each one, more and more of this taste tends to linger and brings down the overall enjoyment factor for me in the end.","bluemoonswoon","Jan 13, 2009"

The citrus has a clear hint of grapefruit but this is just barely prominent. It also has a light juiciness and hint of yeastiness. It has a slightly creamy feel but a crisp finish.

3.73,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Bells Amber pours a slightly hazy orange brown color with a monster of an off white head. Some visible sticking and slow rising carbonation. The nose doesnt jump out at you, i gather a semi sweet earthy/fruity nose with hints of malt subtleties. Nice toasty caramel malty taste. Other tasting notes include burnt wood, rust, cherry, apple and a slight hop bitterness/citrus character. The burnt malt/grainy aftertaste lingers and its probably its weakest point. Its mouth feel on the other hand is definitely its strong point. Perfect carbonation with a medium/light body. I dunno, i wasn't crazy about this one, maybe a bad bottle, maybe im just expecting more out of this brewery, i mean come on HopSlam is nothing short of a work of art. Bells Amber is by no means a bad beer but for its style there are better choices, available in NJ or else where.","ATPete","Jun 19, 2008"

I was impressed and delighted, especially after I had tried the Amber ale from another local brewery a few days ago and I could BARELY finish it. This poured a golden copper and had a slight head. The smell was nice and hinted to a great beer. The flavor was complex yet refreshing with hints of many great ingredients.

Smooth, lightly crisp but almost doughy mouthfeel. Carbonation level keeps it from becoming creamy or full. The hops keep this brew in check but malt flavor is the winner.

It tastes like caramel/toasted malt, citrusy hops, and biscuit/bread/grain. Finishes with a slight bitter aftertaste. It's a mostly malty sweet tasting brew.

The one thing that caught my attention in a positive way was the amount of suspended yeast in it. While its not consistent with the style, I find it a sexy attribute in a beer. I love me some suspended yeast. Aroma is slightly sweet with caramel malts but there is also a roasted smell to it along with some molasses. Taste is sweet but dry. My biggest issue with it is it has an almost saccharine quality to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good carbonation.

I pick up mellow citrus notes, too. The beer has a nice taste balance, with the hops leading at first, but, again, mellow. It finishes with a relaxed toastiness that invites another taste.

This slowly drops to a nice think coating on the top of beer that leaves nice spotches of lacing on the glass. Sweet toffee like smell with some spicey citrus hops notes. It smells like a clean, smooth beer. The malt is really the backbone of this beer when you taste it. Everything else seems to go the the background but things are balanced so that it is not overly sweet. Some earthyness to the malt. Nice dry finish. Very smooth and easy drinking. Overall this has been my biggest surprise of the Bell's beers I've tried. It was the one I was expecting the least from but probably the one I enjoyed the most.

The mouthfeel is thin and tad watery azt the beginning, then it gains more body as it crosses the palate. This an easy to drink beer, with the sweet malty flavor, making it favorable to drink.

Mild, mediocre malt flavor, which is very crisp, but overall husky. Caramel and toasted malt flavors, with herbaceous, weedy hops. Lacking bitterness and a pronounced hop flavor and aroma.

It is mostly malt, but there is a hop presence which makes it so the beer doesn't smell sugary. The taste is incredibly balanced. Niehter bitter nor sweet stand out, but they are both there playing with my taste buds. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and most importantly it isn't sticky the way most amber ales seem to be. Overall, amber ale isn't one of my favorites styles. This brew is an exception.

The taste is pleasant, but not terribly complex. There is little hop action. The taste of malt and fruity elements are there. Sweetness level is high, but overall the flavor is not exceptionable. In the mouth there is a tart feeling on the tongue. Not offensive, but the relatively high level of carbonation and lack of fullness make for a less than substantial beer. Overall this is a decent beer that is drinkable to a degree. It is not, however, the most flavorul or easily appreciated.

A little bitter and souring, the aftertaste almost makes you smack your tongue on the roof of your mouth. After your frist few drinks there is a bready flavor sensed also.

Sweet malt, caramel, a little butter was first on the palate. Some good toasty flavor leads into crisp hops for a dry, citrous finish. After you have a few sips, you begin to notice a dry bitterness that is almost coffee-like. Surprisingly complex taste that I missed on the first sip. Well balanced and easy to drink.

Hmmm, nice aroma, with a hint of fruitiness. Nice creamy head that made the experience even better. The aftertaste was clean, refreshing with a slight bitter finish.

This beer pours a vibrant flourescent amber color with a medium sized white head. Good amount of lacing as well. Smell is caramel sweet and a twinge of bitterness as well. The body on this beer is thick, very thick for an amber yet quite smooth as well. Caramel is the main sweetness but I detect some honey in there as well. Citric qualities that mostly resemble tangerines are very noticeable. Slight buttery diacetyl and a yeasty spiciness come through. Hops aren't bitter but provide a solid base and background holding the body and other flavors together. The hops also seem citric and maybe floral as well.

3.78,-1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Murky multi-shaded brown hue, a fingers worth of slightly off-white head, decent retention, some unorganized lace. Pleasant nose, fruity, bready, sweet yet tart, butterscotch notes too. Equally pleasant palate, earthy, bready, slight hint of spice, well-placed bitterness, the hops are floral, some sweetness interwoven. Fairly complex, none of the flavors outshine the others, subtlety effective. The malt only seems to grow as the beer warms. Medium-body, low carbonation, filling mouthfeel good overall. The finish is bready, sweet, earthy British in nature. Very drinkable. Thanks feloniousmonk for the bottle.","bditty187","May 05, 2003"

4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Coppery amber. A fair bit of flaky white sediment decanted, most of which stayed suspended, but the larger chunks sank to the bottom of the glass. Malty aroma, flavor is very bright and lively. Malty, tangy and moderately hoppy, all at the same time. Well crafted. A very nice example of the style - lots of personality without going over the top.","Brent","Apr 29, 2003"
4.05,5.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This mildly hazy, medium amber beer was a true delight. The small head provided good lacing about half way. The aroma was fruity and sweet. Taste was clean and smooth, with a nice sweet middle and hoppy finish. Some acetic flavors were present in the aftertaste. A nice, easy drinking beer with good flavor and mouthfeel.","jaz","Apr 26, 2003"
4.18,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Taste is very crisp and clean with a perfectly balanced combo of mild fruity hop and sweet malt. Oh, the finish is what got me going and wanting more, its a deep, earthy, even smokey, little pleasure that just gets slightly dry, and is just so smooth the whole way through its amazing. I just wanted to keep drinking it. Feel is a full-medium bodied delight, very nicely light and clean with that spectacular finishing quality I just had a weakness for. Great stuff!","tavernjef","Apr 21, 2003"
4.2,9.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On the palate, nothing but smooth, smooth, smooth. Malt looms large in this ale, but it's perfectly matched. Hops are tingly, tasty, and not quickly forgotten. I can see tossing back a million of these! Yum-a-licious!","feloniousmonk","Apr 13, 2003"

3.82,-0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"I immediately notice lots of chunks floating around and settling at the bottom of the mug. The color is amberish orange and there is an ample, white head. The aroma is easy to tell that it's a Kalamazoo product. It's very enjoyably sweet, almost like a mellowed, less complex Two Hearted aroma. Malt sweetness is powerful and joyous to the tastebuds. There is also a citrus twang noticeable with the hops doing a great balancing act. This is a very easy to drink beer, easily an all-night drinker.","AudioGilz","Feb 09, 2003"

4.09,6.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Very cloudy orange-amber brew with a big, chuncky head. Very balanced aroma consisting of spicy and citrusy hops, yeast, and malt. That nice balance carries through into the taste. Artful matching of restrained but kicking hops with the toasted, bready malt. Also, some esters hang in your mouth and nose after each sip. Carbonation is appropriate and the body is light enough for the style. Very well put together brew from Kalamazoo.","yen157","Dec 05, 2002"
3.71,-3.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pale orange-amber color, nice foamy head leaves a nice lace. Cloudy with floating yeast. Clean mild hop aroma, very balanced medium body feels full on the palate, nice hop bite in the finish, a little sour.","maxpower","Nov 26, 2002"
3.75,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Like the Pale Ale, it's on the pale side for the style and has a similiar head. The body is a medium amber, but looks gold in some lights. Aroma is less hoppy than the PA and picks up some caramel notes. The flavor also has the slight caramel notes, but is still dominated by that crisp pale malt flavor (don't know what it's called). The hops are subtle to not there in the beginning but come out to give you a slow motion punch in the end. It's a very weak, friendly punch though. Seems like the hop blend is the same or similar to the one used in the Pale Ale, just in lower amounts.","aracauna","Nov 01, 2002"
3.98,3.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A very inviting looking beer.  Nice amber hue, just perfect for fall.  Hops are present, as is a clean malty flavor.  There is something very simple about this beer, but there is a rich hop note that clings to your tongue.  Very easy to drink and could be one of those ""anytime"" beers.","AaronRed","Oct 29, 2002"
3.76,-1.8,4,3,4,4,4,"Nice Amber color (duh).Thick rocky head, with great Belgian lace.  Very rich and creamy mouthfeel, with a smooth malt flavor.  Very well balanced, heavily malt, but with a noticeable hops bitterness to avoid the beer being too cloying.  Very easy to drink, and very well made.","jackndan","Sep 28, 2002"

The taste is definitely dominated by the malt sweetness...but it is more of a Belgian style hard candy sugar type sweetness...the herbal hops lend a nice balance...I've had many ""amber ales""...most are OK but not real interesting...this one is veritable adventure in tasting...another dandy from one of the top breweries in the U.S.","ZAP","Sep 04, 2002"
4.21,9.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This is one great amber ale. Pours a beautiful, deep amber color with a sticky head that leaves big rings of lace on the glass. Has a great, somewhat sweet, but balanced malt taste with enough hops to back it up. It's got great body to it, and is fairly easy to drink, making it a solid candidate for a session beer. It's no wonder Kalamazoo sells more of this than any of their other stuff, and still, it's not even their best!","Jon","Aug 08, 2002"
3.45,-9.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Nice surprise for an Amber Ale. I was expecting something along the Killian's line but this produced a hint of hops flavor I was not expecting, which made it taste like a hybrid of some kind. Very interesting. Rich color and good aroma. I am anxious to try Bell's other offerings. The only downside was a faint metallic taste toward the end. Not sure what that was about.","Dogbrick","Aug 07, 2002"

4.23,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,5,"The dense, thick, rocky and billowy head tops a slightly hazy amber / light orange hued brew.  Quite appealing in appearance for an amber.  Signature slightly tart and fruity Bell yeast esters hit the nose at first, but light caramel malt and very mild but pleasant diacetyl butterscotch follow.  The hop nose is comprised of subtle, but earthy Willamette and/or Goldings notes.  Malt flavors are lightly bready and biscuit - like, while a clean light caramel malt sweetness dominates.  The well calculated hop bitterness is a hair shy of balancing the malt sweetness, leaving this brew pleasantly sweet.  Hop flavor is a touch earthy and floral and British in style. The body is more full than the typical amber, but still is light enough to provide for excellent drinkability. Bell's Amber finishes bittersweet, clean and w/ bready malt notes.  This is a flavorful amber, and could pass for a good ESB.","marc77","Jun 15, 2002"
3.73,-2.6,3.5,3,4,4,4,"The beer is cloudy deep golden with orange tinting.  Very slight head.  Not a lot going on in the aroma.  Some sweet malt tones are noted.  The beer has that trademark bready yeastiness to a small degree.  Pretty good maltiness, but it is not so huge with the caramel malts as some ambers are.  This is a refreshing example of the amber ale style.  Some nice little spicy hop notes.  Fruity tones are also of note.  Solid brew, but there are many other Bell's beers that I enjoy a lot more.","Bighuge","Jun 13, 2002"
4.35,13.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: This is an awesome example of the American Amber Ale Style, robust and very flavourful yet still not a problem having a few or even making it a session beer. Right up there with Full Sail or Anderson Valley in greatness in this style.","Jason","Jun 11, 2002"
3.95,3.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Okay, it has a nice gold/amber color and creates a nice bubbly off white head. A little light for this style, but I beginning to feel this is what this company aims for. An aroma of malt and cirtrus. A flavor of malt, hops and citrus. A good beer, just lighter than I think this style should be.","Wildman","Jun 01, 2002"
4.17,8.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Man, this brew wants to ""rise", head like a custard with ""rocky mountains"" in the middle...Its a Bell's, so its murky but mostly grainy.  Aroma is slightly orangey with a little vanilla.  Nice smell...  Very rich taste, malts are big and last to the swallow.  A bit of butterscotch, satisfying body but also a bit of acidic hops.  Well balanced!  Big malt and a little sizzle, it has a lot of hand-pulled draught characteristics.","ADR","May 26, 2002"
3.92,2.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Amber color was a bit 'washed out' looking.  Not as vibrant as I would like.  Nice lacy head that clings to glass.  Sweet (maybe a bit too sweet), malty taste.  Certainly not my favorite beer from Bell's, but definitely a good brew.","Viking","Mar 04, 2002"
