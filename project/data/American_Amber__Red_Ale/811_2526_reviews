"I truly cannot make up my mind on ambers..One second I think I'm just done with them, and then I try one like this that changes my mind...very very solid brew"
"This was a great amber, and I never say that."
""
""
"Just not my style. And, I was required to write something."
""
""
""
"Mild slightly hopped amber. Very drinkable"
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts are present. Taste is hops up front, malts at the finish, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
"May not be ground shattering but is a very good selection to pair with food and is extremely drinkable and good for meeting with friends and shooting the breeze."

"Incredible beer that I need to pick up and give a deep analysis on."
""
"Not really a fan of highland"
"One of my favorite beers. Best from the tap."
""
""
"Very drinkable and food-friendly. This is a go-to red ale as it is now readily available in my area. Stirs up a craving for brats or sausage sandwiches. I keep this in a wine cooler at 50 degrees and the flavors and subtle complexities really come out at that temp."
""
"It's a fairly drinkable beerâ€”though I wouldn't quite call it ""sessionable," despite its fairly light body, since the sweetness outweighs the crispness, respective to Gaelic's malt elements (and malt is the crucial component of an amber, as far as I'm concerned).  But, as stated, it's a little disappointing, given that I've liked other products from Highland, and this is their ur-product.  I've been told that on draft it better matches its promises, both in terms of official description and critical profile, but I suppose I'll believe that when I taste it; from the twelve-ounce bottle, it was decent, but underwhelming."

"One of my favorites from Highlands. Very drinkable"
"Great taste, more filling. Great local brew."
"With a bearded bag-pipe player set against the mountainous backdrop of Asheville NC gracing the label, how can this lose? Filled on 10/7/14. The beer pours with a bright amber clarity, and a rocky manilla head. 2 fingers of foam recede, leaving lavish lacing on the glass.  The nose is dominated by biscuity malts. Tart cider-like notes and piney hops battle for second fiddle. The flavor delivers caramel sweetness, and a buttery toffee that reminds me of an English ale. However, the tangy hop bite quickly takes over, washing away the malts and leaving only nice toasted grain in the finish. The mouthfeel is a tad watery, with tame carbonation, though it doesn't detract from the experience. This brew achieves a very respectable balance.  A classic American Amber, true to the style. Nothing earth shattering, but a delightful and well-crafted treat from the Tarheel State."

"Has a strong taste like it has more kick then it does."
"Very food friendly, well rounded amber ale with slight sweetness, medium body and dry bitter finish. Its less hoppy than many west coast amber ales but more hoppy than many east coast red ales."
"Pours a dark orange or amber brown with a head that leaves quickly. Lacing stays around on top and clings nicely. Smell is bready and malty. Taste is awesome! Clean and refreshing ale with a hint of hoppiness. This is a taste that I think many people would enjoy (ala Sweetwater 420). Feel is superb. Clean, refreshing,  and tasty. The three headed combination I prefer. Overall I would gladly drink this again - one of the more superb sessionable craft beers I've enjoyed. Cheers!"
""
"Probably favorite beer tried so far"
""
"Nothing outrageous stands out but I really like it. Could drink a bunch of these"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  A terrific ale, one I'd drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is similar to the nose, with some grainy malt and a bit of toffee.  Finish moves to hops with that same herbal almost tea leaf flavor coming through the sweet malt. No hints of any booze and the beer finishes clean with just a little lingering hop profile. A well balanced and highly drinkable brew.  Well done."

"O: This is very good amber ale. Maybe the best I can think of. Highland has a hit and at $8/6 it's a no brainer! Extremely good."

"Pours amber with a nice off white head. Aroma is caramel and toasty, grapefruit, a little floral, and pine. Flavor follows suit with a nice balance between malt and hops. Smooth and sessionable, especially for an amber ale. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, my into to Highland and I am very pleased seems to veer the line between what I consider an amber and red (in a good way). Will have to check out some of their other stuff, especially their oatmeal porter."

"o - very complex with earthy roasted and perfect amount of hop notes"
"Pours a clear mahogany body with dense, craggy head of tan foam with excellent retention and lacing. Aromas are very rich in toasty malts, earth, ether, and autumnal leaves. Extremely flavorful in ways that remind me of some oktoberfests: very malty and big on the toasty notes. Sweet toffee up front, toast and browned biscuits on the midpalate, before giving way to almost tea and bitter walnut skin-like flavors on the finish. I like this a lot and plan to make a part of my fall lineup."
""
"Overall, I really like this. I will definitely buy it again."
""
"I wanted to love this ale because Highland Oatmeal Porter and Stout are so so good, but I didn't prefer it at all. Having spent so many happy months drinking Scottish ales in Scotland, maybe I am spoiled. I just did not find this ale to be rich and tasty, but just very average. I will try it again at some point to be fair and to make sure I am not missing out on something really good."

"I'm from Louisiana , a really close friend brought me a party pack of the Highland brewing company. I enjoyed this, for an amber/red ale. I have a dark beer preference but enjoy a refreshing caramel malty lighter beer with good body on occasion. It was right on"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a vibrant, slightly hazy, amber-copper coloring with a low profile, clingy, filmy, off-white head. Aromas of toffee sweetness, caramel and nut sweet, roasted notes, and subtle earthy notes. Flavors are roasted and richly sweet forward, with toffee and caramel creating a tangy sweet blend. Hints of roasted notes, honey, wood, and thistle help round out the palate. The body is smooth and light, with a tangy sweet and roasted aftertaste. The finish is slick, smooth, with a sweet linger. Solid brew; well balanced and tasty."

"I've moved to North Carolina a little over a year ago from Rhode Island and have been introduced to MANY great beers in and around the state. There are many different types that I like for many different reasons. While I am out on a mission trying the many craft beers in the state I keep finding myself coming back to this one. It is also a favorite of my wife as well and is kind of our go-to beer. It never fails in its consistency of great color,smooth malt taste and clean finish. This beer hits on all the marks for me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my favorite offering from Highland. Gaelic Ale to me is an outstanding beer. It is complex enough that it can taste quite malty or quite hoppy depending on what I am pairing it with. It is not too strong to be a session ale either."

"The name of this beer sounds like it's straight out of an Elder Scrolls game. A crystal clear red/brown color. Smells of strong wheat. Tastes sort of like a cross between an Amber and a Wheat ale. The aftertaste is quite pleasant unlike some other beers I've had. I personally Loved it!!! I am always impressed with Highland's creations!!! Prost!"
""
"Poured out a deep clear copper with a moderately creamy tan head. The head has great retention and leaves some nice lacing. The aroma is malty with some mild earthy hops. The taste is very similar. There aren't any notes that lend themselves to ID, but it it is still an enjoyable quaff. It is not as thick as other ales, but it does make it a little easier drinking. This ale comes off better than the sum of its parts"

"Session beer you say?? Yes! This is MY new favorite session beer. Grab me a six pack on the way to the party please!"
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, barely sticky on the back end, and has good carbonation levels. Overall, this is a good amber ale, with nice complexities and good flavor. Nothing blows me away here, however, and was hoping for a bit more."

" I applaud the use of Chinook as a bittering hop and it drinks as a nice session beer that straddles the divide between an ale and an IPA. It's a good session beer that will appeal to those who don't necessarily like the IPA hop smack. A medium mouth feel makes this a nice afternoon thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale reminds me why I always enjoy trying the amber ale style; you never know how the brewer will interpret this vague style. This is one of the best."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is an ok offering, that I could take it or leave it in the future but wolkd probably opt for the later."

"Overall: This is a really solid Amber Ale and perhaps the best beer I've had from this brewery. Definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Personal preference, but the malt starts too strong. It finishes very well and the aftertaste is great. For a red ale, it is above average and is definitely enjoyable. I feel like the carbonation is high, similar to a pils, but not overwhelming. Definitely a beer worth buying. Pair it with a cabbage based meal and see if you turn green."

""
""
""
"I had this beer for the first time tonight with dinner and I gotta say I enjoyed it. It had a good sweetness balanced with a tale end hop bitterness. Made for a good ale. A good ale but not my favorite I've had. I'd drink it again if it was available to me. Enjoy!"

"Amp this thing up and it's a great ale but at its present form it is just above average."
""
""
""
""

"Pours a deep, amber red color. Crystal clear, with a good half inch of very fluffy and creamy foam. Smell is malty sweet, with caramel and oak notes. Very slight hop aroma. Taste is well balanced, with a malty beginning fading to a nice lingering hop bitter finish. Medium body and carbonation, makes this beer very easy to drink. Smooth, and fairly thin mouthfeel. This is a good beer overall, however, Highland has several others that I prefer and will be sticking to over this one."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good overall, nothing too ground breaking."
"Overall: I love this beer. Such a complex flavor profile, but nothing is overpowering. Really a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well balance and simple. An easy drinking ale to throw back after a long day of work. The spicy kick at the end really makes this. Without it I think it would be dull."
"Well done Highland"
""
"Malt is definitely dominant, with bready, roasted caramel notes surfacing throughout. Slight bitterness at the finish rounds out the flavor profile well. Malt complexity is somewhat lacking, though, as well as hops for an amber. There's a metallic tang that is offputting."
""
""
""
"Deep amber color I can barely see through. Not much head. Subdued malty nose. Bready caramel taste up front with a sharp hop kick in the middle with a malty finish. Pretty tasty and well balanced. Dry light mouthfeel highly carbonated. Overall a good beer."
""
"overall, i think this beer-and just about every other highland beer is underwhelming for the style it is. i think people tend to overhype this beer when its just an average beer. its not nasty, but its not great. i think this beer is like the guinness of asheville/nc because people come up to asheville and drink it because its one of the more popular beers here, just like how people go to ireland and drink guinness even though its an average beer. im not saying highland brewing are gimmicky, im just saying their beers are overhyped and just average."

"O: picked up a sixer in nashville as i have heard very positive things about highland brewing. i was a bit underwhelmed with this particular style. solid american amber, but nothing all that spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: highly drinkable. Well balanced blend of malts.the hops are lacking but ehh thats not always bad. Its not bad.. its good.. but its not great. I do urge you guys to try it."

"It only took one Gaelic Ale before organizing a small militia amongst my neighbors to fight against big beer and praise craft brew FFRRREEEDDDOOOMMM!!!"
""
"Overall: A nice amber/red ale. I have hoppier versions from other breweries, but this one firs the suit. Top bad I can't get my hands on another bottle anytime soon."
""
"o: very drinkable. very well balanced between the malts and hops. just nothing about it makes it stand out against the others in the same category."

""

"O - A very drinkable amber ale. Well balanced, and good."
""
""
""
"This is a good everyday beer, perhaps best with a sandwish. I suggest roast beef on rye."
""
""
"As it warmed, the malt just became more pronounced, so it just gets better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O= This beer is avery well done red ale that isn't the overly hopped variety. This beer has a nice grain flavor and a solid mouth. This is a solid beer that you should seek."
""
""
"The initial taste was sweet and malty, not overpowering or overly bold. The finish was a light grapefruit taste but did not last too long. Overall it had both the malt and hop flavors associated with an ale, but they were light, which makes this beer enjoyable for the taste, and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid ale, above average but not incredible. It is definitely drinkable and enjoyable, without some of the overpowering flavors of other ales. I'd enjoy it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out."
""
""
""
"O- tasty. I would get it again"
"Part of the mixed 12 pack, one of the overall best ones in their IMHO. Beautiful amber color, nice frothy head. Hoppy aroma. Taste smacks you with caramel upfront, a nice sweetness balanced with hops and a good malt backbone. Finishes smooth and clean, just a great beer all around. A very common style but this is one of the better interpretations I've had, worth seeking out."
""
"O- Friend brought some back from Ashville. Its a good brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There are beers that just get your attention because they are strong and powerful and there are beers that get your attention because their qualities are a little more understated. This beer is the latter. It pours a beautiful copper with a large taupe head and substanstial lacing left over. The smell is pine, citrus, grasses and bread. Mouthfeel is good with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is very sweet on the front seamlessly giving way to some subtle hoppiness on the finish. This was my first beer from this brewery and if this one is any indication of the overall quality, then I will certainly want to try more."
""
""
""
""
"O:Definitely a good beer, a nice balance of the malt and hops characteristics. The body makes this a very drinkable beer. True, there's nothing outstanding or special about it, but it's a good, solid drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like that this contains a bit more hops than your average amber but it still falls short of greatness."

"O: Very drinkable take on the style. Very well balanced and mild enough without being watery. I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable, high-quality ale, with more malt complexity and full flavors than a pale ale. On par with the very best ambers â€“ highly recommended."
""
""
"O: This is an amber ale with substance. Great on flavor but not overbearing in weight or feel. Will definitely buy again when I'm craving this style."
""
""
"o- an average beer , decent flavor, sessionable but a little lacking in body"
""
""
""
"I'd say this is more of an Amber Ale than it is a Scotch Ale. It's tasty, has good balance, and is on the hoppier side of the spectrum."
"Very sweet and full bodied. Hints of toffee caramel accent what seems like a light Scotch Ale. Very smooth and full bodied. This would be my go-to if it were available in more places. Plus Rally Drum Red from Great Lakes is just plain better."
""
""
"http://www.dudeletter.com/?p=1000"
""
"Overall: On the roasty side of things. Not exactly pleasant and/or savory. Not memorable in other words."
""
""
"An excellent fruity, well balanced between hops and malt, easy to drink session ale. Delightful finish. Has a slight caramelly note. Rich and complex enough to be interesting but never dull. I recommend it very highly. And it is reasonably priced here in East Tennessee."
"O: Period, this beer is great. one of my top 5's. not just in style but over all. i enjoyed every aspect of this beer."
"O: A really solid amber with great balance. I can see why this ale has remained so popular over the years."
""
""
""
"O: More complex and well-rounded than the vast majority of reds out there. I enjoyed it and appreciated it, but most beer geeks would probably just gloss over it and move on."
"Ok, a little above average all around, solid classic amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is not a bad beer, but I have seen all the elements which compose it in great lights. Not quite the beer for me, I prefer an amber from Bell's or perhaps even Smutty."
"O - This is a tasty brew. It kind of reminds me of Conways Irish Ale. Not quite as good, but would work as a poor man's substitute."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I find this one extremely easy to drink. This beer is a solid example of a beer for all seasons. It's nothing overly fancy, but you're likely to tell all your friends about this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An enjoyable malty red ale. Smooth and easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This was a pleasant surprise and I would love to see more Highland brews in VA. Glad I took advantage during my trip over Spring Break."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked my beer, but that was a pretty expensive trip. Yardhouse checks can get high quickly."
""
""
""
"Overall: Fairly robust beer, and certainly quite drinkable. Not a bad choice for a starter beer of the evening, or just a good solid beer to have in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nicely balanced brew, that is very drinkable. Could use just a little less bitterness on the back-end, besides that, it's a fine tasting brew!"
""
"O - A decent Amber that is typical of the style. I'd be happy to have this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down easy, good amber ale. Worth a try."
""
"The beer pours a nice caramel color with a short white head that recedes to a bit more than a film. Leaves a bit of lacing, but not much. Very nice looking. Aroma is nice, biscuit, a bit of caramel, and some floral hops. Flavor is a bit nutty, mildly bitter, nice earthy, floral hops, very mild cocoa, but nothing outstanding. Good beer though. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation, could be a bit fuller, but not complaining. Overall, nice beer. Really easy drinking and refreshing."
"Overall: Not a standout but i ended up liking it. Definitely a viable option as compared to bland beers."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very solid amber ale. Hopier than most reds, but still quite good. I'd definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- Easy going brew with light character and all around nice amber ale. Could enjoy many of these back to back but definitely wish there was more hop and character to them. Above average overall and definitely know there are much better brews from Highland. How should I say this without be cliche? Session ale?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-well balanced that really shows the style well"
""
"Although it's not that complex, it's an AAA, there's no need for it to be. Tipping my old worn out Dale Earnhart hat to you Highland Brewing, for a great American Amber !"
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable, good balance. I enjoyed it."
"thanks to louisb for this extra. pours a brilliant transparent amber with some ruby hues very striking color. the head is white and produced one finger from the pour and quickly fell but shows great retention. the aroma is very subtle of apple covered carmel, grain minimal hops and some toasted aspects. maybe some cinnamon spice as well. the taste has that same apple covered caramel to it then goes into sweet spice and malt character with a touch of hops with almost no bitterness. alcohol is not present. the mouth feel is medium, very clean with a moderate amount of carbonation and is refreshing. overall this is well made brew lacking the hops or it could be outdated, no date found. anyway i would look at this as a gateway craft brew for individuals wanting to get their feet wet. thanks again louis"
""
"O - this review is long overdue ( was reviewed on another beer review site a while back). This has been one of my ""go to"" beers for many years. Definitely recommended. An amber ale with some additional complexity while being highly drinkable."
"picked this up a little less than a month ago when in NC. poured into my blue point snifter. poured a deep shiny crimson red with a off-white frothy head that was gone quick leaving spotty lacing. smell and taste are somewhat bland, with a subtle mix of caramel toastiness. very easy drinker, but a bit watery. very unassuming and unoffending, but certainly not attention grabbing. the most noticeable thing about this beer is how even the taste is. ambers can be a turnoff if they are too aggressive and this one is pretty likeable."
"Medium bodied and mildly carbonated. Great drinking for any time you are in the mood for one of the best American Red's you can find. Go get some!!!"
""
"A decent beer from highland but not really my favorite."
"Overall a solid Amber Ale with a solid malt backbone. This one goes down easy."
""
""
"O: very nice beer and well balanced. This is a good beer from highland. I would def recommend it to many. Very easy to drink."
"O- A really nice, easy drinking beer with a great creamy mouthfeel. Very balanced between the hops and malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark red color with very little foam head. Very unique flavor. More hop character than a lot of amber ales but same sweet caramel malt flavor. Very good and unique taste. Highly recommended, even from someone that is not a big fan of this style."
""
""
""
"O - Weird pool water aroma detracts heavily here. Otherwise not bad...flavor is much better than the aroma, but still only really rates an average for me. Not undrinkable by any stretch, but not particularly satisfying either. Glad to try it, but likely a one and done for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent ale that fails to achieve greatness only because it is so easygoing and...average, but I mean that word in the best sense. A great casual drinking beer; recommended."
""
""
"Average one to two finger head with a thick cloudy copper color with good lacing throughout. Only the slightest bitterness with a smooth malt taste. Very little carbonation. The mouthfeel is full and robust with just a hint of hops. A very enjoyable well balanced beer that gets better with every sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good ale from Highland that's a bit unconventional but very tasty. I would highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice sweet malty brew with a nice emphasis on hops at the finish."
"O: very good amber overall, this had the sweet malt and hop crispness that makes an amber interested and multi-leveled."
"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
"Brownish amber beer with a very small head and very little lacing. Nice sweet aroma and taste that reminds me a bit of a Bock beer. Earthy raisin, toffee, and also a bit of grapefruit zest from the hops. The medium mouthfeel and balance makes this a drinkable brew almost anytime."
"Overall (4.5): Iâ€™m definitely impressed with this beer. Red Ales usually arenâ€™t my thingâ€”I can dig super hoppy American Amber / Red Ales like Nugget Nectar, but I generally donâ€™t derive much joy from Irish Reds, for instance. This is pretty tasty, though. Nice mix of Old and New World takes on the Amber / Red category. Definitely not the Nugget Nectar hop bomb type of AA/R, it leans more towards the Irish side of things. Maybe because of that, I bet this would be killer on cask, too. Surprised by how much I liked this, actually, especially after not liking the Oatmeal Porter very much. Nice work, Highland."
"Drinkability is good, a a tasty amber, nice maltiness."
"Overall: I had this while watching a Penn State game and it served its purpose well. It's good, but not very interesting."
"O: This is a very easy drinking ale. It is a beer that is good for any weather and is one that someone who isn't into more craft like beers could easily handle. Pretty Good stuff."
"The flavor is slightly sweet and grainy with a nicely balanced hoppy zing. Primarily, the flavors I get are toast, marmalade, and a touch of citrus. The flavors don't really last though and the finish is a bit mild. Still, what flavors there are tend to be balanced and refreshing. There's also a sizeable punch of cascade hops. I used to homebrew and know cascade when I taste it (it was practically all I could get at the time). It's unmistakeable."
"Medium mouthfeel - sweetness flows out to envelope palate. Clean malt flavor profile. Not overly complex, but again - clean malty profile. A hint of clover honey. Just rich enough to satisfy. Flavorful with out being complex - an easy drinking Scottish style ale. Not overly true to style - but it works nicely."
"This brew is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Â It's easy drinking and not filling.Â "
"CHEERS!!"
"A fairly nice example, perhaps not the traditional American Amber/Red, but quite good nonetheless."
"Poured bottle into Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass. Aroma was malt, but was subtle. Appearance was an orange amber hue with a finger-breadth tan head that dissipated in a minute leaving behind a small smount of lacing. Good carbonation with hops and initial bitterness greeted the palate before the malty sweetness provided the balanced finish. Overall, a very nice ale."
"I think this is a very good beer. I come back to it again and again when I want something rich, balanced, and highly drinkable."
"Overall, one of the better Amber Ales I have had & very nice on the wallet @ $1.49/bottle or $8.49/6pak."
"One of the better red ales I've had of late."
"O (D) - this is a strange beer. Nose and tongue are not in line. I do not care for it."
"Pours a really nice deep clear amber with a thin head which leaves a little lace. Smell is slightly dry white grape, yeasty malt and a bit of hop. Taste is light, malty, dry, and a little hop bitterness on the finish. Slight chewed aspirin on the finish. Fairly thin mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Not bad, but not quite as big a beer as I prefer. I prefer their Oatmeal Porter, but I heard recently that they were gonna stop distribution here in Florida. Oh well.."
"A good malt forward beer."
"The beer has a very great combination of flavoring and drinkability. The aroma is nice and the tones are solid as well. I didn't see to much of the bite that I read about, and a little more carbonation would have been nice. All around, I will buy it again. And make sure to serve it around 45 degrees!"
"Overall I am not normally a red ale or amber fan, but this beer really turned me on to the style. The beer pours a reddish amber color with a finger of foamy head that retained ok and left some lacing. The aroma had notes of caramel malt, bread and a good amount of hoppiness. The taste starts with the caramel and bread maltiness and then becomes slightly bitter and hoppy. This really is the pale ale / IPA man's amber. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and the flavor lingers just the right amount of time. Overall a great beer."
"I donâ€™t know if this beer epitomizes old Scottish tradition, but if so, then Iâ€™m feeling pretty Gaelâ€¦"
"The beer is light orange, with a mild haze. The head is a finger or so thick, leaving a fair amount of lacing upon the glass. The nose brings malt, some sweet caramels, and some vanilla. The flavor is reminiscent of cream soda with some malt flavoring. I happen to like cream soda, but this isn't my favorite quality in a beer. The feel is creamy and smooth, with a growing sweetness. Not a repeat for me."
"Overall i will buy this beer again, not from a ""wow its good"" but just to have a ""good"" beer. Not my favorite, but i can say this; i hope one day i can brew some beer this good. So therefore i definitely enjoyed it. Recommended, at least to try my beer friends."
"Beer is sweet and medium in body, the back is moderately bitter, finish is not dry. Overall a below average tasting ale. I won't have it again."
"Pours a clear amber color with a small white head and a thin collar on the way down. THe nose carries an average amount of bready malt with a touch of caramel in there. The flavor has a light sweetness along with some bread crust and a bit of toast. Light caramel there and some very light hops. Light body with average carbonation; finish is slightly-dry and bitter. Decent enough, though nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"Its a caramel amber color with a creamy white head that fades fast and leaves spotty lace. Smell is of brown sugar, biscuits, caramel, and grassy, herbal hop nose with a touch of sweet chocolate. The taste is mellow, smooth caramel. Bready malts, and clean hop finish of grass and earthy hops. A touch of sweet chocolate makes this interesting. It is very well balanced between the malt and hops. Very drinkable."
"O: I probably wouldn't pick this one up again."
"This beer had a nice dark red/caramel color and malty nose, but it surprisingly didn't have the taste to back it up. It was also on the thin side for me. It wasn't what I expected based on what I had heard about it, but it would still make a nice session beer nonetheless."
"Good beer."
"O: This is a decent hybrid of Amber Ale and Wee Heavy."
"O - excellent for style. Easy recommendation, even for beer aficionados, but particularly for newcomers to craft beer. (verified on sept. 16, 2011 -- pairs great with chocolate.)"
"This is a great beer, and one I'll come back to again."
"Overall a tasty and very sessionable beer from what I think is one of the Southeast's better craft breweries."
"Highland Gaelic Ale is the first beer I've had from the Asheville brewery and it is not a bad beer but definitely not a great beer either. This is deep burnished copper with almost no head, despite the rough pour. I think that any beer especially an American hopped amber should have the carbonation and head to bring up the aroma. The bee smelled mostly malty, with a bit of fresh hops, but mostly just grainy malts. The taste was mostly the same dominated by a biscuity malt and balanced only by a modicum of hoppiness. I think that this style (and not the double) should have an assertive hop character with grapefruit and tropical flavors and medium-high bitterness, which I find lacking in this beer."
"If you like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, then you'll like this beer - both seemed nearly identical in appearance, smell, and taste. Gaelic Ale is a tad darker (a dark cooper) with a bit less head and lacing, and the scent was weaker. The taste is nicely balanced, with a light grapefruit flavor from the hops. A good beer, but nothing that stands out as exceptional."
"Draft pint at Sine Irish Pub at the Pentagon City Mall. Red copper color arrived with 1/2 inch white head. Malty sweet fruit cocktail (candied peach, pear, cherry, and orange) aroma with a kick of grapefruit hops. Fruity taste with grapefruit zest. Remarkable balance of sweet malt and bitter hops. Really enjoyable!"
"The Gaelic has been a favorite drinking beer of mine for a long time. It is my favorite brew from Highland in Asheville. It pours a deep golden color with a burgundy tint. The head is light and fluffy and the beer laces lightly on the glass. The smell is average and carries a solid blend of hops and malt. Drinkability is missing from the scale these days and I think that is one of the strengths of the Gaelic. It has a slightly bitter feel but a smooth malty finish. I think it is a solid go to beer for entertaining and for good afternoon hang. Delightful despite it not being an ""A" beer."
"Pours a clear dark orange with one finger thick white head, a few splotches of lace left on the glass. Smell: predominantly toasted grain with some caramel, hopping is leafy with a little citrus peel. Taste: toasted grain, caramel, kind of a graham cracker thing going on, a little grapefruit and spicy hopping with an earthy finish. Medium bodied, caramel, apple, and earthiness in play at the finish."
"Nice beer - balanced for pretty much any season, tasty and well made."
"Thank god this comes in a six-pack, because it's a very tasty, very drinkable beer."
"Pours out a nice deep amber color, almost ruby. The head is about 2-3 fingers but doesn't linger long with traces of lace. The nose is full of floral aroma and sweet like honey. This is where the Cascade and Williamette do wonders for the aroma of a beer. The taste was on the upper bitter end for an amber, but it while I thought it was well balanced with the malts, the bitterness lingered a little too long. A tiny hint of earthiness, spice and fruit came through in the taste making it a nice light-bodied, flavorful, semi-sweet amber with character. I'd say while it's drinkable for me, it may be a little complex for those seeking a session. But if you're looking for a unique amber, definitely give this beer a try."
"D: I find this one very easy to drink. Nothing too fancy that it's easy to down before you realize how many you've had."
"Very strong aged taste with yeast and ginger after thoughts. I can't get enough, somewhat dry, but totally drinkable. Good beer..Looks like NC does it right! Thank you CBlack85"
"D: This one disappeared quite quickly and I would not have hesitated to have another, were it available!"
"Overall: a flavorful yet highly drinkable session beer that's rightfully the flagship of Highland Brewery."
"The mouth is slick and well suited to the beer. It is an easy enough drinker, served a bit to cold but it improved as it warms."
"Pours a beautiful deep dark red color with medium foamy tan head. Aroma is very caramel sweet with a touch of citrusy hops. Flavor to me is lacking, of course I was told it was a Brown Ale, and I didn't believe him, so the Hops now make sense, now that I see it's a Red ale. some sweet caramel, some bitter hoppiness, but nothing that really stands out. Overall, not bad, but I'm glad I didn't pull the trigger and trade for these 5 different Highlander beers I just got for free from a friend."
"Notes: excellent, light American amber"
"Pours out a nice ruby looking amber color, decent head forms quickly, then fades. Moderate lacing remains on my glass as the minutes pass. Has a very floral and malty sweet aroma to it, definitely some hoppiness going on in this red ale. Some piney, earthy hop flavor to start, bitter floral aftertaste that lingers around on the tongue nicely. This is a very malty tasting beer, quite bready and biscuity, with a pleasant sweetness and a very dry finish. The mouthfeel is quite thin, leaning towards the light-light medium body with a perfect level of carbonation. All in all, this is a good beer, very flavorful in the hop department, nicely done and easily drinkable."
"Verdict: Pretty nice brew. Fairs not too intense on most levels and bolsters a closer balance of malts to hops without going overboard on either ingredient. Hop lovers should notice and appreciate the presence of good quality decent hops in fair amounts in this brew, while those who don't feel for hops shouldn't be turned away. Pretty nice, Highland did well with this. B+ (3.8)"
"I felt this was a good beer, but could have used more malt characteristics to be in better balance as the style goes."
"This insane balance is both this beers high-point and set-back. The character is neither a hoppy and bitter nor smooth and malty, which is pleasing balance, but it is also a bit underwhelming. Deciding which way to think about this beer is a little like deciding between two really great movies you want to watch: once you settle down and pick one, you miss the other."
"great drink ability....def. a nice session beer"
"Pours a very beautiful amber with a fluffy two inch head. The lacing looks like a paint splatter on the glass. Not much going for it in the smell area. Slight malts, tiny willamette scent. Eh. The taste is interesting. The bigger the mouthful, the heavier the taste. Very nice malt background with a fat burst of hops. The flavors mix together quite well. (Beats out my old amber session beer, Fat Tire.). There is almost no carbonation on the mouth, I have one more 12oz. so I'll see if it was a bottle defect. Other than that, very smooth. Super easy to drink. I could throw down a sixer (if I could get it here in SF.)"
"D: Drinking a few of these in a single sitting wouldn't be that difficult because it isn't that filling and doesn't have a high alcohol content."
"It has a bread like aroma with a slight hint of herbal hops. The body is a deep amber with average tan head but great lace. The body is full and has a normal amount of carbonation. There is a bitter but not too bitter taste with some malty bread like sweetness at first. It finishes with a some what herbal and roasted finish."
"The Highland Gaelic Ale is a great amber. The Ale has a great nose. On the nose it has some light malts, with some very light floral. The mouth feel is very light, but with lots of flavor. The Gaelic Ale has a good balance of malt and hops, not one overpowering the other. It finishes very clean and crisp. At 5.8% ABV is could be a good session beer."
" Recommended try."
"D: Quite drinkable, a nice twist on the style."
"A delicious Scottish-inflected ale but with an American twist."
"I'm becoming a bigger fan of Highlands as I try more of their beers, especially when I can foray up into North Carolina and get them pretty fresh. Another solid offering from a brewery that's growing on me."
"Anemic malt with a hint of roasted flavors. Hops give very little to the aroma and leave a dishwatery aftertaste. I'm not sure what they're after with this beer. There are so many better amber ales, I can't believe this one should rate in the top 20."
"D: Easy to drink and well worth it when you can find it. Fortunately, I'm in Asheville, and this one is an easy find for me."
"It's packed with flavor, but not too heavy or chew-spitty. Simply put this beer exceeded my expectations and is a must try if you ever find yourself in Ashville, NC."
"Overall - Enjoyable beer. Malts up front with balanced, background hop profile."
"Pours a dark red brown color with a tan head and a little lacing. Smells of malts and some hop aroma. Tastes sweet with a strong hop flavor for a well blended smoothness. Mouthfeel was smooth with a crisp, clean finish. Drinkability is really decent."
"D - Good, not great. A little sweet to session, but it's the style, not the beer."
"D- Geez, I just caught myself gulping this stuff. Its not the best beer by a long shot, but for what ever reason, it drinks alarmingly easily."
"Good beer. I'm a fan."
"Totally drinkable."
"Very balanced it is, I just didn't enjoy this one as much as everyone else."
"D: Lots of nicely balanced bitter and sweetness, which is not overpowering."
"A beer like this makes North Carolina shine within the robust American craft beer scene. A slow-grilled dry-rubbed pork loin with baked sweet potatoes is a perfect pairing."
"This was easy to drink and it would be easy for me to drink these all night."
"D - Overall, excellent. Would go well with several different foods, and I would enjoy a nice session evening with this beer. Great job Highland!"
"very drinkable"
"I like this one as n every day drinker. Not too adventurous, but good to drink with a lot of the food that I cook. I'll be keeping at least a few of these in the fridge at all times."
"Pours an amber color with a one finger head which disappates to skim with a small amount of lacing. The aroma has a nice caramel backbone with piney hops and dark fruits. The taste is of caramel malt and sweet malt for a backbone there are hints of dark fruits, the middle and back have a nice hop kick of piney and earthy hops to really round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated with a creamy finish. The drinkability is good, it is well balabced and a fairly easy drink. Its complex enough that it keeps u interested."
"I'm quite intrigued by the Highland beers I've tried so far. They seem to have a flavor profile that doesn't immediately give what you'd expect for the style brewed. This results in something both unique and refreshing. The Gaelic Ale has a perfect balance of rich malts and zesty hop bitterness. The complexity of the malt is much more that you get from a typical amber ale. I found it highly drinkable. Recommended..."
"This is my favorite American Amber/Red Ale so far. It pours a rich reddish brown with a generous head. This beer is wonderfully malty and creamy, with enough hops to balance it nicely. It is full flavored and rich, but not overly heavy. The smell is very malty with hints of caramel and nut. A very balanced red ale."
"The nose is decent. Plenty of caramel with brown sugar and a little toffee. There really isn't a lot else going on here, some hop character is present, but this is mostly just sweet.Hops are mildly chalky. The palate opens with a moderate bitterness with some citrus hops with more pith-like bitterness than flavor. Again, there's a moderate malt character as well, with a hodgepodge of caramel, brown sugar and toffee, all rather muddled. There's a moderate sweetness on the finish, along with a rather surprising coffee note. A touch of citrus as well, there's some bitterness present. Medium in body with moderate carbonation, this is decent on the palate. Decent stuff."
"Picked up a few of these from a beer store in Kill Devil Hills as part of a mixed pack of Highland Brewing company. Pours a deep orange/red color with a fluffy inch tall head. Malt character was very well balanced with a few toasted malts hiding in the background. Hops were not to overpowering and gave a nice grassy touch to the brew. Very drinkable because i wanted to down a few more after this one was done. Not overly filling at all. Great Buy from Highland Brewing."
"This one's not bad at all."
"I ended up drinking all of these from the sampler, and although Highland did redeem itself somewhat, this one did not work for me. No recommended."
"F: Finishes slightly dry with a slight sweetness, slight bitterness with a little grassy mild hop flavor, and some earthy flavors lingering. Crisp ale flavors also linger."
"Well balanced, easy to drink."
"Body was a bit thick with a good amount of carbonation gave this a very full mouthfeel. I thought this was a solid beer."
"Served from bottle into Stone nonic. Pours deep copper with one-finger off-white head that lingers. Maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, slight fruit, and nuttiness. The flavor is comprised of smooth and crisp malt notes with a subtle nutty flavor mixed in. It has a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is a very nice brew from Highland. It is quite drinkable and enjoyable. Worth a shot if you get the opportunity."
"D - overall, a decent take on the style. malt heads will enjoy the loads of caramel, while hop heads should be pleased with everything else going on here."
"D - Highland's Gaelic Ale is a really nice amber ale. Meets my definition of a session beer (albeit the abv is a little too high) _ nice flavor that doesn't destroy your palate, as well as being on the lower end of the abv spectrum. Well done Highland!"
"I really like this beer. It is simple, smooth, and has some character, but I have to admit I'm not blown away. I think either the addition of more intense hops, or malt (or both) would really allow this ale to stand out. If you're looking for something other than a Yuengling on a hot day, this would be a nice alternative. I'd love to see the difference on-tap. Fantastic house ale..."
"This is a good beer on tap. I have had the bottle as well and it's not so good. I really like a cold tap though. Great with pizza and the taste can hold up to rich food. It has a great orange-rust color with a lot of bitey carbonation. Give it a try on tap... a lot better than the bottle."
"Reddish gold in color. Smells slightly malt-sweet with a kiss of hops. Toffee & floral hop bitterness in the taste. Finishes slighly dry. A nice, sessionable amber ale, and one of Highland's flagship beers."
"Overall a less than stellar brew. Just another average beer to lump in with all the other ones."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Pours a slightly reddish amber, with a golden head. Smells slightly nutty with caramel malts. Tastes very malty, slightly metallic and pretty smooth with some alcohol at the end. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but okay. Pretty drinkable, I could put probably 3 down."
"D: A rather uneventful scottish style ale (regardless of what the bottle says, this tastes like an american style scottish ale). Nothing to write home about."
"D: This is a lawnmower beer if ever I've had one. Lightly sweet, little hop bitterness or aroma and refreshing carbonation."
"D- This was a average drinker which isn't a bad thing. I would gladly buy a sixer of these if they were here. Would recommend as a good intro into craft beers."
"D - This is a nice ale. My first Highland brew and I enjoyed it."
"The taste is a little better than the aroma but there is some lingering skunk. It starts out pretty boring then brings some rye and a light hop finish."
"Overall, this is a nice take on the style, though it's very much a subdued beer. Because I'm in North Carolina, I sort of took for granted that I'd be getting a fresh beer but now that I'm looking I see it's been past it's prime by about a month. Still, I've had this beer several times before and I've always enjoyed it. This is definitely a brew worth trying."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy. A nice surprise."
"D: Goes down smooth and clean! Nice example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is medium and well carbonated. Drinkability is high, could use some more hops though. Rather muted in that department. Otherwise, a good beer."
"About a finger's worth of tan head, mostly larger bubbles which dissolve swiftly, the lacing broad but also slides down quickly. Full on amber red with enough brown to darken it into near opacity, more brighter orange around the rims. In the nose there's a lot of interplay between the caramel, molasses and the pine, herbaceous hops, orange peel, milk chocolate, brush of peach and apricot fruit, long presence in your nostrils. Full-bodied and broadly set, as in the nose it's impressive for its sheer stature and weight. As a result, it is a good thing the carbonation is very active. The molasses, brown sugar, caramel sweeter upon mouth entry, the overall finish is dry. Very leafy, almost twiggy, the pine and orange, lemon citrus elements drier than expected. Here you get a touch of softer, creamier bread dough with a few lactose accents. Easily drinkable while in no manner simple."
"D - Drinkability is awesome. This is a nicely balanced beer with plenty of good flavor. I do like that it is fairly hoppy. Easily recommended."
"The mouthfeel is pretty thick for the style, with carbonation on the low side. Smooth and fairly sticky. A very nice American amber that I could see gladly sessioning if I lived in the area. I like it better than the Duck Rabbit amber that my dad bought me on the same trip."
"Overall, a good beer. I would gladly drink these again. The BA grade will be lower than it should be simply because i did not rate the smell favorably as it was super subtle. Tastes good though."
"D - This is an easy drinking beer that few could object to."
"Overall - Pretty good, I'd buy it if I were out and saw it but I don't think I'd grab a six-pack of it. Even just a little bit of bitterness to counter that sweetness."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I am glad I bought a six pack and I will deffinitely drink this more often."
"I had this beer at the Lighthouse in Wrightsville.This beer is clear in body. Amber and Red in color. Off-white head is ok and pops butt does not last long. Big malt in aroma backed up by s light citric flavour. I wonder what hops they use. Flavor is malt with moderate hopping. Not a bad North Carolina beer."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"Overall impression, is that this is a very nice, well put together beer."
"D- Wow, couldn't finish this one at all. I hope I just got a bad bottle."
"D-great mouthfeel on a rather pedestrian tasting beer."
"This one got MUCH better as it warmed. When cold, it was quite dull and 1-dimensional, but came to life as it warmed in the glass."
"Drinkability is great! Its a tasty brew that goes down easy and would make for quite a nice session beer. I look forward to having quite a few of these in the future."
"D - this brew was given as a christmas gift but ended up being one of the best gifts i received! nice job by this small brewery in asheville. will purchase more of this brew when i'm in the area again."
"I have had this beer on tap a few times before and was not impressed. But poured out of the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised with this beer and found it not to be another one of those bland, boring Amber Ales. Definitely interesting enough to enjoy a few in succession."
"D - This was my first offering from Highland and I am very pleased...I wish I could get this around here regularly...a good malty yet slightly hoppy amber...I'm looking forward to more from Highland"
"Very drinkable. Too bad the store I found this in only had individual bottles and no sixers."
"D: Highly drinkable. A well rounded beer balanced nicely between malts and hops as well as creaminess and carbonation. If I lived around here I could definitely use this as a basic session standard."
"d-could have a few of these a night and not regret it.."
"The real star of the show, though, is the mouthfeel. Its medium-full and creamy and pushes what is clearly a good beer into another realm. Terrific on a cool fall evening."
"Easy drinking."
"The taste is better than most. I particularly enjoy the balance. There's a solid (lighter) malt base with a pleasant hop counterpoint--not really bitter or biting. The body is okay, but the carbonation seems to be a little high."
"Very nice beer to drink and goes down quickly. Highland Brewery lives up to it's reputation!"
"Highland Gaelic Ale is my first beer from Highland Brewing. Nice amber color but appears a little thin. Makes up for the watery look by being pretty flavorfull. Malts and caramel are present with just a touch of hops. A better than average American Amber Red Ale. Excellant drinkability."
"drinkability is decent, but it ends up a bit bland without any real character to call its own. just another amber beer without any redeeming qualities. drinks easily though."
"Drinkability: Overall this is a very nice ale and offers exactly what I expect from the style, though it may not necessarily be enough to be considered outstanding. A nice find at Kroger, and definitely worth it when shopping at a place like that."
"Drinkability: A solid ale. Definitely one of the better Scottish-style ales out there. Give it a shot!!"
"drinkability: I liekd it once I realized what it was. A good traiing beer for the rookies and well made. Like I said this is a better Fat tire"
"D: Very nice. Not sure I'd pick it up every week. But a good beer for a change of pace. Tasty, I would drink it again."
"This is a beer that I keep all the time in my fridge."
"-Bye"
"Nicely done!!"
"	I really enjoy this beer and have had it on multiple occasions. I think it really represents a good example of the American Amber Ale Style. It is not a ""clean"" beer but a lovely malty and hoppy beer. Has great drinkability."
"D: Not bursting with flavor, yet this would is nicely done and would make an ideal session beer."
"Overall, I'm highly impressed with this beer. Most beers I try that have such fancy packaging suck. I'll definitely look for it in the future, and I'll definitely have to go back to the store to try their IPA that was sitting next to this stuff."
" The carbonation in this brew was perfect and was a nice compliment ot the overall character of the beer. The density of this brew was also in great balance, not thin and not syrupy. This is a good brew cold a well above average as it warms. The fruit and malt slowly builds with temperature.red with a meal much more than standin alone."
"Next up in the highland variety pack tasting is this Gaelic Ale. Popping the cap the first smell is earthy hop tones then followed by sweet almost butterscotch smell. Pours to a deep transparent reddish brown with a multi size bubble head with lots of action. Head laces nicely upon receding. Taste is very earthy, peaty hops with a big malty backbone. Mouthfeel is solid. This brew approaches chewable. Definitely a different hop approach, much more earthy, with flatter bitterness. Tastes more like an English ale than an American ale to me but so be it, it is a very good beer."
"D: Definitely a session beer. Good flavor, but it's not over the top. Everything's in balance here, and in a very good way. I'll definitely look out for this one in local bars, stores, and the like."
"The mouth feel was slightly prickly from the carbonation, with a medium-light body. It was easy drinking and went nicely with the bbq chicken pizza I was eating."
"Tastes like it smells. Toasted caramel malts up front, sweeter near the middle with medium nodes of biscuit and jam, moving into a lightly bitter hops near the end. Decent hops, good balance, but they play second fiddle to the malt. And that is fine by me."
"Drinkability: very sessionable"
"Drinkability: Smooth enough for a meal and quite versatile. Try it with a haggis or some neeps and tatties...it's a spot on scottish ale."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy amber with a creamy tan head. Dissipates to leave a nice cap and good lacing. Smells of nice caramel malts; sweet and with just a hint of yeasty spice. Impressive thick caramel maltiness; medium bitter hop character in the background gives it a slightly dry finish. As full-bodied as it is full-flavored. Pretty pleasant overall."
"This would be a great fall brew on a crisp morning sitting and setting up at a tailgate."
"Mouthfeel was thin and wet. Disappointing. Flavor was a big let down as well. Very malty and sweet. Finishes like toasted brown sugar. There was very little bitterness in this at all. Pretty bland overall. I was sorely disappointed with this beer as I've heard good things. I'll give the bottle a try and see if it is any better..."
"This beer has a solid, unique character. It's respectable, but as far as drinking a lot of them, it's really not my cup of beer."
"D - A reasonably drinkable, malty beer. There is very little hop character and while the beer remains balanced due to a surprising level of dryness. Unfortunately this robs the beer of complexity and causes the toasted malt character in the finish to become cloying."
"D - A great session beer that we are lucky to have in this area. Props again to Highland!"
"Nice creamy head in my 2009 Masters tumbler fades to a little outside line of bubbles. Looks like dark iced tea. Roasted malts dissolve to West Coast hops. Go ahead, have 2 or 3 of 'em."
"Medium-full body, smooth, slightly chewy with a nice fade out. Effervescence is not strong at all. A very good brew."
"this is one hell of an amber. very rich and vibrant all around. very easy to drink and very enjoyable. low ABV means this is a GREAT sessionable beer."
"D- a nice smooth clean beer. This is one you could pound back a sixer in a few hours but anymore than that and you would feel like you ate an entire 3 course meal. very filling beer."
"the bottle reads: ""a deep american amber colored ale, featuring a rich malty body. cascade and willamette hops add a complex hop flavor and aroma. this ale is exceptionally balanced between malty sweetness and delicate hop bitterness.""...overall, i think they nailed it...cheers to highland for this one...."
"all in all, one of the better ambers I've had. appearance is incredible, and flavor doesn't fall far behind. the delicious mouthfeel really makes it enjoyable, and just goes to prove that highland can make some fairly impressive brews. Nothing amazingly out of the ordinary, but a damn good amber."
"Another winner from Highland Brewing. This one is full-flavored and nicely balanced. A good all-around ale."
"Overall, a good bier but not a great one. I do recommend it; do yourself a favor and try this bier. Prosit!"
"Solid brew from an underrated brewery."
"Drinkability is below average because the malts make this a relatively heavy amber ale. Not that I expect to drink reds on a hot summer day, but I don't expect reds to conjure up images of Willy Wonka. A good beer, but one of the first I've come across about which I've questioned the style."
"D - This brew is easy drinking. However I could see the hops being a bit much after several of theses if you're not a fan of bitterness."
"MF/D: A little bitter in my opinion, finishes smooth and clean"
"D - Easily sessionable, if I could get more of this in Ohio, I would put it in regular rotation."
"Very drinkable, and the amber stays with me for a bit on my tongue, which is great."
"D- It's a touch rough around the edged but a very drink able brown/ amber I like this a lot."
"D: Not a bad ale but the balance is off."
"D - I had 2. Thats about all I could have, but def enjoyable."
"Poured a deep amber/copper color with a small sirty white head. Nose is malt forward without a doubt. Taste os malty, taste much like a scitch ale than an amber. Hints of deep malts perhaps crystal, 2 row and hints of light cocoa, caramel and toffee. Some biscuity notes as well. Mouthfeel is nice, coating, light cocoa and toffee, Good indeed. Worth a shot."
"Picked up a six-pack at Whole Foods in South Beach. Appeared a dark amber-red, not far from a brown ale, and with a white head. The beer drinks dry, yet it feels a bit heavy at the same time. The flavor has a mix of herbal and citrus hops with light toffee, caramel, and biscuit malts. Overall, it comes off light an American red ale with a twist. Well made and certainly worth a try."
"M: easily drinkable. Very smooth and crisp. Good carbonation."
"Wow, this is an extremely tasty brew. Very smooth and creamy. Citrusy hop flavor is much more pronounced in the flavor. Has a nice corn flake touch to it that adds a bit of toasty complexity. A very nice beer that I would love to have access to on a regular basis."
"Overall, this beer looks great and smells inviting. The mouthfeel is a bit watery for me and the flavors are not quite what the nose hinted at. Still a decent brew."
"Overall I'm glad I revisited this beer, as when I had it from the bottle on numerous previous occasions it had a metallic taste that turned me off for a while. A new recipe or the fact that I had it from the tap make this beer a whole lot better. Worth a shot."
"Wish this was more of a scotch ale, but just not there."
"Highland Gaelic Ale pours a reddish copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I like the aroma, it's mostly malty. Toasted malt up fr;ont and at the end with a nice amount of hops in the middle. The mouthfeel is on the thick side, especially for this style, but I find it enjoyable. Pretty good."
"Pours a light red/ruby tinted body with one-finger head and some lace. A mild sweet malt smell along with minor hop notes. Medium-bodied although it straddles being light-bodied, the malt notes and hops are subdued for a light, sweet sensation that gives the tongue a minor prick on the backbite. Caramel malts and citric hops are present but nothing overpowering. An alright red that I could have again."
"Feel is very smooth. There's a nice creaminess. Medium body. Excellent balance. Quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Despite the sweetness/unusual flavors, it's a very easy drinking beer. This would make an outstanding base for a winter warmer, and has more flavor than any amber/red I've had so far. Outstanding beer."
"Easy to drink, left me wanting another one."
"I'm a fan of Highland, but this isn't my favorite of their offerings. Still, not bad."
"trade via brentk56"
"Easy."
"Drinkability on this one is good. You could drink a few of these and enjoy all of them easily."
"D - I love this beer, and I could drink a lot of it. I've become a real Highland junkie, and the Gaelic Ale is one of their better offerings."
"D really well balanced and the hop flavor is like smelling pellets but not overwhelming great stuff"
"The aroma has rootbeer, caramel, malt, and a hint of hops. The appearance is amber with a smallish sized head. The flavor is sweet and closely matches the aroma. The palate is smooth. The finish is slightly bitter and cardboard like. Overall good but with imperfections."
"Bottle thanks to tronraner. Pours a bright and clear amber color with a medium tan head. A sweet nose of rich caramel, some toasted malt and sugars. The flavor is also dominated by loads of caramel malts, some balance is achieved by a decent hop profile. A soft and fizzy mouthfeel. A light bitterness in the finish. Fairly earthy and nice."
"This beer pours a clear amber/red into a pint glass from the bottle. Gaelic Ale has about a Â½ inch thick tannish head that stays a while, leaving very good lacing on the glass as I drink it. The nose is a caramel malt with some spicy hop notes added in. The taste is a clean maltyness with a pleasant hop bite as the mid-note, ending with a bit of clean but biscuit flavor. Wow, very nice! It has a medium mouthfeel with a medium carbonation bite. It is a very drinkable beer. It is a mainstay as one of my session beers when it is available. Have not had a bad Highland beer!"
"D - Dinkability is really good. This would make for a great session brew. There is more than enough going on in this beer to keep it interesting and it is simple enough to put away all night long. Alcohol is hidden behind the flavors pretty well which just adds to the overall drinkability. Kudos to Highland for a tasty brew."
"Amber-red color under a tight off-white head. Balanced aroma of sweet caramel malts and citrus and floral hops. Great hoppy flavor...a mixture of sugary tea and citrus that doesn't get too bitter. A rich maltiness rounds it all out nicely. A little dryness in the finish makes me practically chug the whole glass. Firm, medium body. I can't believe I've never rated this one. It's pretty darn tasty."
"D - This is a great beer once it reaches about 50 degrees fahrenheit. I'd love to grab this again next time I need a growler fill at Riverside and they have it available."
"Thanks to michaeld23 for this one."
"Good on-tap choice in NC"
"Pours a deep amber with reddish hues and a medium head with good retention and lacing. Smell of caramel malt, light fruit, and spicy, earthy hops with a light citrus. Taste is much of the same and adds a toasted bread to the mix. Very well balanced and quite flavorful, more so than from the bottle it seems. Good lighter body with solid carbonation and just the right amount of bitterness to counterbalance the sweetness of the beer. A session Amber if there ever was one."
"D, notes: This is a good drinkable red."
"The fine folks at Highland Brewing Company have a fine line of brews with this one being my favorite."
"Reddish sort of hue to it. Nice lacing left on the glass. Moderate amount of hops in the aroma. Slight maltiness to it. Definate malty flavor with a slight caramel/toffeish flavor. Decent hop bite to it. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. I have lost my taste for an amber/red ale in my old age. This could help restore my faith."
"Received in trade from limesmut and mikesgroove, thanks for the opportunity guys. Pours a deep amber color with a nice size dirty white head that stick around a bit and laces the glass all the way down. Aroma is caramel malty with some citrusy hops in there as well. I smell loads of caramel and some mineral in the background. Tastes malty, caramel and hops round it out nicely. Maybe a touch sweet. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, medium body that finishes quite dry but lingers with bitterness in the finish. Decent brew for an American amber, I'm not sure what makes it a Gaelic Ale though. There are better brews out there, but this one is pretty good, I'd drink one if it was offered to me."
"Thanks to unionturf for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a deep, translucent amber with a one inch, frothy, off-white cap that almost crested the lip of the glass. Head eventually settled into a thin, broken skim with only a few spatterings of lacing preent during the tasting. Nose was malty with a light floral hops aroma in the background. Taste follows nose. Very malty with a toasted caramel character. Maybe even an earthy/peat-like quality in there. Mouthfeel is between light and medium with a hint of carbonation and a nice, unexpected creaminess. Excellent drinkability; so flavorful and easy drinking with more malt than hops coming out (just the way I like it)."
"This is a handsome beer as far as your standard amber ale goes - deep, clear amber color with a light tan-yellow-ish head. I'm sticking my nose as deep down into the glass as I can go, and I'm not picking up much aroma - perhaps some mild caramel and nutty action, or maybe I'm just imagining it because my nose is all jammed into this thing. Thankfully it does have flavor and there is more of a hop presence here than in most typical amber ales. An almost sweet caramel malty taste followed by a bitter tang of hops. This went better with food - grilled chicken thighs seasoned with sage, oregano, basil, etc. and salt-n-peppa. I think this beer will go well with leftover Thanksgiving food."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied, a touch on the thinner side of things. Not a remarkable brew but still a very solid session beer."
"Definitely a great session beer where you should drink at least 3 to appreciate it."
"D- easily drinkable, bought a single from a farmers market in NC."
"Had this particular glass on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. A beautiful looking red ale- especially on draft. Coppery red with strawberry highlights, a nice 1 inch head that leaves some lacing. Very light aromas of somewhat bready malt, and a bit of yeasty tanginess. Deeper flavors than suggested by the nose. Bready malt with a touch of fruitiness and nuts and some citrusy hops. Not seemlessly integrated, but done pretty well nevertheless. The mouthfeeel is chewy and a bit sweet, but overall this is a pretty solid beer."
"D - Very high drinkabilty. Could be paired with anything foodwise."
"Pours a clean copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet maltiness and balanced with a small hop. In the taste, a dryer malt, and almost a bit peet like. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a dry maltiness in the aftertaste. A ballsy ale, feels big, a nice flavor for a ale."
"Confusingly, the piper in the picture is holding a boastful mug of some lighter color brew than the one that came out of my bottle. He ought to be drinking what I am, for it is uncommonly good."
"Certainly worth a try. Everything I've had from Highland has been pretty good."
"Overall-a malty sweet version of the amber ale style. A fine beer with an interesting off flavor, I wonder what that is. Either way, an ok beer."
"This is a smooth, medium to full bodied beer with a good balance of sweetness and bitterness."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a light tan head. The aroma is sweet malt, caramel and a touch of smoke. The taste is sweet malt with some caramel, smoke and some hops in the finish that helps balance this one out. Overall, Highland Gaelic Ale is a pretty decent brew that I wouldn't mind drinking again. Worth a shot."
"Good beer, something in there I can't quite get my arms around."
"The draft version of this beer arrives with a clear garnet body alive with numerous trickles of active carbonation capped with a thin white head that leaves a little lacing. The drink smells and tastes much sweeter and spicier than the bottled version, with less carbonation and a stickier mouthfeel. A little slick and sticky. I preferred it in the bottle, where it seemed less sweet and much hoppier."
"Drinkability: This is a great session beer. Its sweetness is never cloying, and its alcohol content is low, so it's very easy to drink a lot of these. So drink up!"
"deep amber in color with a thin head of foam. delicious sweet aroma of molasses. smooth even mouthfeel. well balanced, deliciously sweet taste on top finishing with a mild hop bitterness. very smooth and very drinkable. could drink this beer all day. an excellent example of an amber ale."
"Big shout out to my buddy Mike for hooking me up with a 5'er (yea i said 5'er) of this after his recent trip to NC. It pours a brilliant ruby brown color with a big brown and white spotted head, awesome sticking/lacing. Nice nose of wood, chocolatey sweet malts, some spice and some cherry and other fruit notes. Mostly malty, semi sweet malts at that, pretty crisp fruity feel to it, a bit of smokey wood chips and tobacco, a touch of citrus and hop bitterness upon the finish. It leaves a very woody, malty, bitter aftertaste, im loving it, this may turn some people off though. After it sat for a while the aftertase became a bit metallic, not very offensive. Good medium mouthfeel, decent complexity, light carbonation and pretty damn easy to drink. Good beer!"
"Taste starts out malty then is nicely balanced by the hops, not overly hoppy, some citrus elements."
"Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Gentle carbonation enhances the mouthfeel. Great session beer with enough flavor to keep you interested. Can easily stick with this all night."
"Great body. Thick mouthfeel compared to most reds/ambers -- which seems to play better with the malt-centered flavors. Carbonated well. Highly drinkable beer. Certainly one of my go-tos. One of the best locals around."
"D: While I generally prefer my red ales to be hop heavy, this was still enjoyable, drinkable, and very well done."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a cloudy amber color. The head is one inch in height, bright white in color, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma of caramel, toffee, and grapefruit. The taste is like the aroma, and very sweet. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but it is nothing special."
"D- I think this has potential to be a session beer, for me its a bit sweet to have too many of. Highland makes some good stuff, and this is certainly a good one as well. This is only the second time I had this and I remember liking it more the first time, but certainly good."
"This is a nice beer overall, it's just not one that stands out from the pack of not only the Highland lineup (or at least the four or five that I've sampled), but ambers/reds in general. That said if this is the worst thing a brewery has going for it than that's not a bad position to be in as this is still a good brew. Another nice once from Highland."
"A highly quaffable, moderately hopped ale. Not a monumental brew in flavor, but balanced, delicate, and pleasant."
"D - good drinkability."
"Pours a pretty dark red with a small to medium head that leaves nice lacing on the surface and sides of the glass. Aroma is mild and malty. Caramel. Bready maltiness. Toasty. Not overly sweet. Just the right amount of hops to balance things out. Medium bodied. This is a really solid beer. Definitely one of the better American ambers I've had in a while."
"Pours a great deep ruby color with good initial head (goes away quickly), and some slight lacing. Decent malty aroma, but it's not very strong. Great taste, a nice deep, filling malt flavor with little hints of a scoth ale thrown in, along with a very slight butterscotch flavor. Goes down very smooth, if a little thick. An excellent beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. The deep amber and nice foamy head are a great presentation for this beer. There is only a mild carbonation. The cascade hops come right through in the nose, very distinctive. The taste is has a slight burnt characteristic. There is a balance of hops and malt, but then on the back end there is an astrigent taste. The body is mild, which allows for a lot of drinking, but after two I'm ready to move onto bigger and better."
"Overall: A great flagship ale from a strong local brewery. Equally satisfying as a session beer and an all-around food companion. Perfect with pizza; try with other Italian fare as well!"
"Lighter side of medium-bodied, with soft to medium carbonation, this is a well-balanced amber ale that is very quaffable."
"Overall: not quite what i was expecting, but mostly a good beer, with a little kick"
"It comes out of the tap a rich, translucent mahogany with a fine-bubbled tan head. Aroma is mainly malty with a hint of spice. Flavor is rich and malty and has a strong spicy undertone. This ale's texture is smooth, but it goes down with some sass and zing."
"Perhaps a little overcarbonated, but there's a lot to like here."
"Quite a nice drinker with enough flavor to keep you interested. Light and dry on the hops makes me happy here and there and this one works well."
"drinkability is good. well balanced. solid malty base. good stuff."
"Recommended. I was not expecting too much from this, but this is one of the better ambers I have had. I like the smoky undertones in this one."
"This all led to a nice long bitter finish that was rounded out by the malty sweetness. A darn good beer."
"T: Very malty, full bodied beer and in general very pleasant to drink. Slightly sticky with persistent aftertaste of bready malt and a little hops. Caramel from nose is also present and finish has a little hop bitterness for balance. Carbonation is present but in background. Overall, not my favorite amber, but for what it is, very good. My favorite Highland brew I've tried so far."
"This is Highland's flagship ale and in my opinion their best. It poured with a pretty deep amber hue and a big appetizing head. The smell was very good, a great mix of bready malts and hops. The taste retains the breadiness of the smell with a good measure of Cascade and Willamette hops keeping it in check. I find this style to be tempermental and easy to mess up, but Highland has a brew to be proud of."
"A great drinking beer I'm going to go have a pizza with it right now will probable grab another one while I'm at it"
"Overall, nice, easy-drinking beer. Not overly complex, but enough is present to please the palate."
"Overall, not too bad a beer. It isn't the most complex beer I've ever had, but it has a good bite and is surprisingly refreshing."
" This is really very good for a style that is ofter mediocre at best. And the bagpipes, man you gotta love the bagpipes!"
"Very nice. I really liked the interaction of the roasted and caramel malts in this guy as well as the pleasant bitterness it ended with. A fine tasting and very drinkable Amber Ale."
"D - This is a very good ale that I really enjoyed this one a good taste this is worth trying sometime"
"A red ale with a touch of roasted malt that makes it on the Scottish heritage given Highland's theme. It's in the aroma, and the aroma gives off a booziness far behind its ranking. Quite malty and cinammoney and medium plus mouthfeel, with hop bitterness rounding off the finish.Reddish brown colour with white foam covering."
"The Highland line is generally one of my favorites but this particular ale is closer to mediocre. Not bad, generally enjoyable."
"Very tasty beer, just not a true amber. I buy this stuff a lot, usually on-tap and it never disappoints. Really good if you can't decide between a malty or hoppy beer."
"My first highland brew. Lovely reddish brown color, retains a consistent two-finger head. lots of malts, maple, caramels,sugars on the nose. Fruits, predominatley apple flavor, sweet malts, slight caramel on the finish. Sweet on the initial mouthfeel but has a bit of a tart finish. Good flavor, but maybe a little sweet for my liking. A good offering of this style, not too hoppy and quite enjoyable."
"A very tasty beer that I will definitely seek out next time I am in the region."
"Great beer. I did not expect this to be as good as it was. Could drink this one all day."
"Overall- This is a nice offering, but not on the top of my list. Of course, I am not too big on this style of beer either, but I was really excited initally with this one. Toward the middle to the end of this beer, I was let down. It was like it fell flat on its face after the first taste or two. BUT, I did like it, and I would definitely drink another."
"A pint on-tap at the Red Drum Taphouse in NC. It arrives a clear chestnut, with low carbonation and a half-inch of khaki head that leaves decent lacing. Smells earthy and smoked, fruity, with some caramel, light hops, and a dash of currants. It is a fairly malty beer, with earth, caramel, toffee, and toasted notes, barely balanced by herbal/minty and grassy/spicy hops that impart a medium bitterness. Nearly full on the palate, smooth and coating, with light carbonation and a medium finish. Overall a tasty brew, and well-balanced despite the large amounts of malts."
"Easy enough to drink several."
"This one drinks bigger than what it is, and that's a compliment. It's not overly sweet or caramelly, as far too many ambers or red can tend to be, but neither is it too roasty, like a stout with a serious pigmentation problem. This is a well balanced, fruity, malty, chocolatey beer. Well made, and worth trying."
"Cloudy orange/brown with a dense foamy head. Leaves some lacing too. Nose is simple sweet malts and some alcohol. Taste is mild hops with molasses sweetness, some spice, and toasted malts at the end. Mouthfeel is good and drinkability is pretty good too."
"Pours a nice amber color, nice carbonation, nice fizzy white head, some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, slight bitterness, and a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice above average amber ale."
"Very good drinking beer, glad to have had the chance."
"Update 07/30/08: A dark copper color ale with a solid off-white head and some goodly gobs of lacing. The aroma is a mild malty cereal deal, hard to nail down and not particularly strong. The flavor is much more definitive in great malt character with some clove and raspberry/cherry and chocolate. Really complex and fun to drink. Well carbonated and not heavy in alcohol so it is easy drinking for the style. Medium feel, maybe even a bit light for this type of brew but very enjoyable. Definitely try this one as something easy to like and a little different. Malt is the theme and it's a good one."
"Drinkability: Highland's given us a pleasant, easy drinking amber, which is awfully decent of them."
"The taste was quite good. A big malty backbone with touches of carmel and brown sugar dominated the palate, while a decent hoppiness rounded off the flavor. A slight fruitiness rounded out the flavor. Mouthfeel was smooth and light-bodied, with a lack of bitterness to it that was more than made up for by the malty sweetness. Drinkability was superior as well, I could've had a few of these if time had permitted."
"This is an excellent beer that I can find pretty readily at the bars in my location. It's got a nice refreshing and crisp feel. It tastes very well balanced with a light malt touched with a bit of piney hop that is far from over the top. Smells similar with a bit more emphasis on the hop. The beer looks like a beer. It has a light head ontop it's amber body."
"Overall quite drinkable. Nicely balanced. I would certainly have again."
"Drinkability: Good beer. The sweet and nutty flavors blend well with the hops at the end for a tasty combination."
"D: Pretty good job on this amber ale, definitely stands out. The balance of this beer is what makes it a great choice, and the malt character is one for those who are looking for that bread-like fix."
"D: Very good beer, if I could get this beer I would drink it quite often. I think I need to find a clone recipie so I can try making this beer cause I think it would go over pretty well with most everybody."
"A very nice sipper or a hot afternoon brew."
"Light to medium body,grainy,on the rough side. Had a hard time finishing the bottle. Liked the two other beers i tried from this brewery this one was nothing like the two others i had tried."
"Notes: Like I said at the front of this review..I just love the offerings from Highland..this is no exception this was a great beer for a relaxed evening..If you have the opportunity to pick some up..it's a can't miss"
"Drank really easy, colud session on this, no problem!"
"Drinkability/Notes: Highland Gaelic Ale is a very drinkable beer. Plenty of malty goodness with a fair amount of hops in the finish to lend a bit of bitterness. Lots of dark fruit and sugary sweetness with a light, citrusy bitterness and flavor thrown in for good measure. At 5.8% abv this might be on the high side of what most people consider a session beer, but I could easily put a few of these back without any complaints. A very good amber ale that is worth seeking out. Glad I was able to pick this up in NC. Seek and Enjoy. Now I wonder what the Imperial version whs like..."
"Smell was pleasant with a nicely balanced offering of herbal hops and toasted cereal malts. Taste was well balanced, too, with a nice blast of bitter hops up front followed by a nice malty dry finish. This was very drinkable and a great brew on draught."
"D - A tasty and easy drinking red."
"D- Average ABV leads to a nice possibility of drinking more than one which I would be more than glad to do. However, only have one. Will have to get a sixer next time I'm in the Outer Banks for the beach. Good stuff from good brewer."
"Orange-amber colored with a light caramel head. This beer is translucent, but not cloud, which was interesting (the translucent part) considering how light the color is. Head does fade, but there's solid lacing. Smell was a combination caramel/brown sugar with a very faint bit of orange/citrus. Nice combo. Hops kick in with the taste but the maltiness doesn't die down either. Still mostly caramel, but also some roasted quality blended in..Solid balance. The hop bitterness is there toward to finish, but doesn't actually linger, which may make this beer seem too sweet for some. Nice medium mouthfeel. This is a beer that seems longing to be served on draft."
"Drinkability: definite session ale here as several of these can be had in a single session. I had this on tap and it seemed quite fresh so the flavors were nicer than what you may get in an older bottle."
"Poured with a rather limited cream colored head that disappated quickly. Not too much aroma; just a slight cascade hop presence. Taste is where this ale shines. Got some roasty caramel notes from the malt with earthy citrus hops on top. The Gaelic does a good job of unifying these disparate flavors. In the mouth, it's a bit stickier than called for, but that doesn't make any less drinkable."
"My 1st Highland beer. I was a little underwhelmed with it, maybe I was expecting too much, maybe I just picked up the wrong offering. Either way, I will visit this beer again and will certainly continue to try Highland offerings. This brew is very drinkable but is nothing spectactular."
"Gaelic Ale pours a nice amber hue with a finger thick khaki colored head which dies down to a thin lacing pretty quick. Stickiness is spotty, but there. Smell is a bit weak, but a toasted nut malt seems to dominate the nose. A small bit of earthy hops seems to emerge as well. Taste was quite a surprise, but a pleasant one at that. Very nice caramel malt with a good balance of citrus hops which gives this one an overall sweet character to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is definitely there, but the sweetness may take away from it after a few. Possible session beer. Thanks again to Sean for this one."
"D: Great. This is a good beer that really goes down smoothly. Nice session beer, for sure."
"Dark copper color with a nice red tint. Creamy off white head that holds nicely. Smell of bicuits and caramel with maybe a hint of figs. Taste is very malty but somehow manages to avoid being cloying. Finishes stong with some wood notes that hang around in a pleasant aftertaste. I'm impressed with this one."
"Malts seem to rule the base of this brew. Sweet caramel and biscuit malt flavors. Smooth on the palate after an initial carbonation blast. Slight bitterness that continues into the finish, but it's not very prevalent. Thin body to this brew--almost watered down in my opinion. It wants to be more thick than it is, but it just doesn't have the legs. A session brew that didn't wow me as the mouthfeel isn't very good--too thin. Highland does good things, but this may be the most pedestrian of their offerings."
"Served a crisp deep ruby amber with a thin frothy head. The aroma was mild with caramel malts and citrus hops. The taste was a good balance of caramel malts and citrus hops, the beer was light and crisp. This is a very refreshing beer and definitely makes for a great session."
"Drinkability: One of the best NC session brews out there; nice all around"
"Taste is similar to aroma, but malty sweetness is complimented by some hops bitterness. Not spectacular, but still pretty tasty. And very drinkable. I would make a good session beer for me."
"Medium-dark ruby color with a touch of amber and a small, off-white, milky, quickly-diminishing head. The smell has a good balance of toasted malts and citrus and piney hops. Brown sugar sweetness in the nose and taste. Caramel, grainy bread and doughy yeast. It has a medium body, dry texture and low carbonation. Smells better than it tastes, but itÂ’s still refreshing and above average."
"Taste: The hops actually are blended in nicely. Almost like an extra hoppy ale but not so far as an IPA. Very easy to drink. No alcohol taste present. Good balance on the aftertaste with fruit and malt. A good choice."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with a slight haze. There isnÂ’t a lot of head and no lacing. The smell was caramel and malty with a hoppy freshness. The taste is malty with a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel is full without being heavy. The carbonation is noticeable. This is a smooth beer which is quite drinkable."
"Drinkability is my favourite category. This one wins hands down. It goes down smooth and easy. This is a good session beer. Maybe a six pack with a platter of junk food in front of the TV to watch the game of your choice."
"D - I like my beers on the maltier side and this one worked great for me. Yes sir, may I have another?"
"Poured dark gold slightly rust colored from a 12oz bottle. Smells very hoppy with a strong whiff a citrus. Not much head and there is medium lacing. First tasteÂ…quite smooth but less hoppy than I thought base on the smell, but more hoppy than malty. I cannot wonder what this ale would be like on draft. Another fine showing from the folks at Highland!"
"Bottle courtesy of Loki."
"Poured a dark amber/reddish hue with a nice cream colored head. Smell was sweet caramel malts with a hint of a corn or grain in it. The taste was very much sugary malts with again a bit of a grain or earthy back to it. Very nice actually. This is very nicely carbonated and goes down smooth. A good beer from Highland, this could easily be an all night beer as it is light and tasty!"
"D- Very nice easy drinking beer. Nothing to complex or strong. Great for a beer to sit and relax with, making it a great every time beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium, soft and dusty, very drinkable. Not much about this one stands out but it is perfect for a rather neglected and underappreciated style and would make a great daily fridge staple."
"Bottle provided by the almighty oberon, shipped to him fresh from North Carolina -- many thanks! Ever-so-slightly-hazy burnished copper with an effervescently noisy onionskin-hued head. Mild citric hop-tea scent (bergamot and bitter orange) with an earthiness atop some biscuity malt aromas. Doughy and toasty -- the before and the after of bread? -- malt flavors come to the fore at first, followed by some mellow lemon and bergamot flavors; leafy hop flavors through and through. Bit of biscuity taste at the back. Solid taste, for sure. Medium light body, eminently quaffable. I know Irish Red Ales are supposed to be easy-to-drink, but this one here just about defines sessionability. Very nice ale."
"Medium bodied with big crystal malt flavor, then spicy American hops running up the back. Finishes with lingering crystal malt flavor. A decent if, but not really exciting beer."
"When I first started on BA, I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever be able to try this beer. That just shows you the power of trading. I wasnâ€™t disappointed at all. Looking forward to the other two Highland beers that I got in the trade and then trading for more."
"Drinkability: good, could drink a few in a night"
"Strong malt profile in the taste with deep, lasting coffee flavor tempered by caramel and a touch of Cascade hops at the front of the sip. Delicious, smooth, chocolaty aftertaste. Lots going on in this tasty brew, and none of it is like any Irish red I've ever had. Still, this is a quality, easy drinking brew with character and originality."
"Even though the ""style"" is irish red ale, the gaelic is on another level of red ale excellence. It's distinct and should be the first thing you order when it's on the menu. Enjoy."
"D: Very drinkable with a nice hop flavor."
"D - tasty little beer, flavor is a little ""quiet," could use a little bigger body in all respects. Another solid offering from Highland, give it a try."
"Pours a reddish copper with a thick robust head that leads to a good amount of lacing. Smells of spices and hops. A bit fruity as well. Taste is sweet with brown sugar and caramel with a strong hop presence. Very tasty. Will have to incorporate this brew into my regular rotation as well."
"thanks goes to Ross from another site for this. Poured a nice copper with a big light tan head that left some good lacing. aroma, malts, brown sugar,I swear, cererly, hops, a nice sweetness. flavor, a nice caramel comes out than the hops and malts, brown sugar as it warmd got a touch of alcohol. this was a very drinkable beer could throw down a few of these. Thanks again Ross you ROCK ON"
"This beer has been a staple for me over the years because it's just damned good. A: Pours a tawny auburn with creamy light tan head. Solid carbonation and lacing persists. S: Carmelized malts dominate the nose with some hoppiness. T: Smooth with enough body to provide a sweet foundation that is evened out by a moderately hop laden finish for crispness. M: Slight viscosity with medium body D: Excellent flavor and medium body add up to a very drinkable smooth Irish Red. As with all Highland products, I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"Pours a deep redish copper color with a three finger width tan head. Smell is malty with a nice soft and rounded hop aroma. Taste has a nice maltyness well balanced with hops (cascade and at least one other). Mouthfeel is good, the beer's thinkness on the tongue is well balanced with its carbination. Good drinkability."
"This classicaly-colored Irish red has a big head that quickly vaporizes but leaves a nice lacing. It offers up quite fresh aromas of sugary malt, earthy and fruity hops, wood, light spices, and fresh baked bread. Great balance of deep malt sweetness, metallic dryness, hop bitter, and fruitiness. Fruity hop finish makes this one a bit different. Mouth and gut feel are both just a tad heavy, but I'm sure I could still do some damage to this."
"Nice head with good color and body. Has caramel aroma that blends nicely into the taste and a nutty, smooth, clean finish. I found it very easy to drink, with not a lot of aftertaste, but enough to get it by. Received in a trade, and I sure wish we could get it up here all the time."
"Overall impression: Very nice amber - just a bit too sweet to be a session beer for me though."
"Foggy bronzed orange. Popping, tall head of small and medium khaki bubbles that slowly settles to a frosting spread of fine bubbles. No carbonation streams. Caramel malts and fruity sweet hops with just a touch of grapefruit rind tartness. There is a slightly sweet malt character that bridges to the fruit and slightly peaked citrus hop finish that lingers for the blink of an eye. This is balanced to the point of equilibrium, but nothing stands out. There is no carbonation present which gives this a bland, flat mouthfeel that is not appealing. Medium to light body, but overall the mouthfeel was sub par. Merely mediocre, balanced, but neither the malt nor the hop component were distinctive. The missing carbonation did this one in."
"Pours a deep amber color with about 3/4"" head that quickly fades. Smell is earthy but with a hint of freshness. The malt is the first thing I noticed when drinking but some fresh hop flavor hit me at the end. Very high drinkability. Could definitely drink several of these. This is my first Highland brew but will have to check out more."
"Yet another fine offering from Highland Brewing."
"Poured a deep reddish ruby color with a nice one inch head that left some sticky lacing on the glass. Aroma was malty with just a little bit of a hop/pine smell. Taste was very malty and caramelly at first and ended with a good dose of hop spiciness in the finish. This beer was very smooth in the mouthfeel and easy to drink. Definitely a good session beer and I'm glad it was available on tap. The other choices were all bland macros in the particular pub I was visiting."
"Pours a hazy deep amber/mahogany color with a thick tan head. Good head retention as well as some belgian lacing. Sweet malty caramel like aroma with just a little citrusy hops in the background. Flavor is nice caramel malts, spices of clove and a little pepper, and earthy hop bitterness. My first Highland beer, but I hope to try many others."
"The body is mid to light. Some wispy flavors that arenÂ’t exactly watery but close to it. Very easy to drink but could use more malty caramel flavor. Nice enough to enjoy in the Scottish hills of North Carolina."
"Not sure if I would order this again or not. It wasn't a bad beer, but there are lots of other beers out there that I've liked better than this one."
"Gaelic Ale just might be the best Irish red that I've had yet and is another wonderful example of the brewing brilliance on display down in the Tar Heel State. This one is a keeper, but then these guys only brew keepers. Slainte!"
"I really enjoy this brew.. One of my first of this style and will deff. be revisiting."
"drinkability: real easy. fans of balanced beers will love this ale. drinking this beer brings me back to my parents garden, smelling all the flowers around me."
"This beer pours a dark garnett-red with a frothy off white head that laces a little and leaves a bit of film the whole way down. The smells seems to be a mixture of pale and subtle roasted nutty malts. The taste brings back the same flavors present in the aromas however there is also a dimension of balanced subtle hoppiness that adds a slight bit of bitterness. There is a good amount of carbonation that combines nicely with some thickness that makes this beer have a good mouthfeel. Overall another good offering from the Highland Brewing company out of Asheville, NC"
"Wow - what a great looking beer! Pours a beautiful deep amber/mahogany color with a thick tan head. Good head retention as well as some sticky lacing. Sweet malty caramel like aroma with just a little citrusy hops in the background. Taste is a near perfect balance between the rich, sweet malts and hop bitterness. My first Highland beer and certainly not my last."
"Good stuff that you could enjoy a few of in one sitting."
"A solid beer from Highland, courtesy of NClifestyle. A bit more hoppy than the customary Irish Red, more in line with the American amber. Poured a chestnut with amber highlights. Not a lot of head on aggressive pour. Hopping was firm, but not excessive for the style, with a hint of grass and mild herbal notes. Went just a bit acidic at the finish, which helped clean up."
"Body is medium, smooth and silky, with sift carbonation stemming from a constant stream of tiny rising bubbles."
"Drinkabilty: heck yea get you some!I think its a great amber that should appeal to most beer lovers"
"drinkability: limit of about 4 for me"
"The taste started off interestingly, somewhat bitter and quite hoppy, but quickly faded into a watery, tasteless beer. It had no tatse of being skunky or anything like that, but just finished with litle or no taste at all. The mouthfeel was also relatively flat, watery and uninteresting. it was a decent beer to have with friends but nothing very impressive."
"Gaelic Ale is a terrific ale that's all-things- Amber, Irish, and Red. It rewards the palate but never overwhelsm. Its remarkably balanced and embraces boldness. It's simply what American Amber Ales should be- and not just around St. Patrick's celebrations only."
"[Thanks to mntlover for sending me this Asheville gem]"
"Had this on-tap at the Olde Hickory Taproom last night. It came out to me with a average sized head. It was a nice red tone. It had a good aroma as well. The taste was very close to Killian's. The drinkability was good as well. I could have drank several more. I would order another one of these in the future."
"This is a great example of taking a style and adding something just different enough to get your attention (the sourness) yet complimenting the other expected flavors quite nicely. All in all, a very tasty beer, and more than sum of its parts."
"Pours a brilliant medium amber with a 1 finger head and good lacing. Aroma of an earthy malt with good caramel notes. Slight citrusy hop aroma. A nice earthy caramel malt with citrus and pine flavors. More hoppy than other Irish reds I have had. A nice example of the style. Try some if you get a chance."
"Amber as you would guess with a name of Gaelic ale. An Irish red style--ok fits that description to a tee. There is a nice 1 finger thick head. No lace. Smell is malt with some sourness too. Very straightforward malty taste with a woody character. There is some chalkiness too. Mouthfeel seemed thin at first but after a few sips seems to improve. Not exactly a style I am particularly into, but it is a fine example of what an Irish red should be. Ok for drinkability. I dont think I would want more than 1 or 2."
"Highland is definately my favorite NC brewery, and this brew puts some nice NC mountain twists on the irish red category. I dig it"
"Pours a copper penny color with orange hues. Light foamy tan head with good lacing. Has a sweet malty smell, with a slight fruit back ground. Tastes are malty, bread flavors, with some spicey fruit background, raisins? Has a nice floral hop flavor. Smooth, slick mouthfeel. Somewhat watery, and thin. Would like to see more body to this beer. It's a good session beer to drink among friends."
"Poured a bold and vibrant burnt copper color with a filmy head and lots of spotty lace. Nose is kind of malty and not much else. Flavor is surprisingly complex, but muted. I got some taosted grains, biscuits, and dark chocolate. Hops are very mild and are mot noticeable in the finish where they provide a slight bitter kick. Mouthfeel is thin and watery--not much to hold this beer together. Great brew to share among friends."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the dark orangey amber brew. Head shrinks but still leaves something at the party, with average to good lacing. Aroma is sweet grains, with some fruitiness. Taste is dominated by the maltiness, with some light hops and fruit coming in at the end. Mouthfeel is great with all the malt smoothness, and drinkability is on the same page. Could be a regular drinker if it was local to me."
"Translucent red amber with a soft white two finger head. Smells of sweet biscuity malts with just a litlle spicy and citric hop aroma and some subtle fruity esters. Much more citric hop flavor than aroma. Citrusy hops are the first and last flavor, with soft bready malts in between, not sweet, but very biscuity. A bit of alcohol in the finish, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is soft and doughy with very little carbonation. This beer is extremely well balanced and highly drinkable. I wish I had more to make it a session. Thanks to mntlover for this fine brew."
"Bottle provided by GCBrewingCo, thanks for the opportunity! Pours a single finger tan head over a nearly clear red/rust orange liquid. Smells rich caramel sweet, toasted grains, and a tang that I think is citrusy hops, but it also comes across as kinda pine sol-ish. A hint of chocolate and some bready biscuit. Tastes caramel and toasted grains with mild hop bitter and an interesting citrus hop flavor. The hops have some grassy character, but also a piney flavor, too. Chocolate begins to rise late and persists as the primary flavor in the aftertaste. The finish is baker's chocolate dry. Medium easy downing mouthfeel with moderate carbonation."
"Edit: Ok, ok, the taste is good and has been upgraded! Still, it's not a beer that I'd go out of my way to get - _for_me_ it's a very pleasant session beer..."
"Crisp and bold medium feel with a smooth carbonation and flow. Good subtle flavors, tones, and dryness makes for some fine drinkin'. A pretty solid red ale, which are few and far betwwen."
"Cheers..."
"A clean cooper/amber beer. Has a small creamy off white head with some lace. The aroma was a bit of sweet malt with a caramel note. There was a salty seaweed aroma in the back ground. The flavor starts with a bit of sweet malt with a hint of smoke in the background. The finish has a quick promise of hops and then its gone. The label says "" a wee bit different"". That difference did not capture me."
"A very nice session brew, worth having several."
"Really a spectacular looking beer, deep amber/mahogany color with a thick beige head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. Smell is sweet caramel malt with a fruity background, maybe strawberries or cherries. Taste really doesn't live up to the smell, this really isnt that complex of a brew but it is tasty nonetheless i was just expecting a bit more frankly. Taste is your basic irish red with a very slim hops profile that isnt very noticeable. Begins with a sweet caramel/molasses flavor and a light fruitiness that resembles strawberries and a barely noticeable piney hops flavor that is very much in the background. I think this beer could be really good if they upped the hops a little as it would balance the brew out alot more. The mouthfeel is appropriately creamy and smooth with somewhat low carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, and this could be a session brew but there are alot better irish red's out there (really King David's Red by edenton is a much better choice)."
"Drinkability - a tasty and hearty beer, a great meal companion. Thanks to merlin48 for this one, too!"
"Pours a clear red/amber colour, low head, no lace that I can detect. Smells of sweet malts, apples, little bit of hop aroma near the end. The taste is kind of sweet and malty, with a solid hoppy bitter finish. A nice tasting ale, very smooth and easy going, I would definately try this one again. Thanks DrJay."
"Notes: Good body. Solid beer but not too outrageous or anything. Just very drinkable."
"This brew pours to a red/amber color with a fair sized head that broke down quite quickly leaving very faint lacing along the side of the glass. The aroma seems to be mostly of malt that has a toasted and sweet smell. Can notice slight hop scent but it has a hard time breaking past the malt. The taste is heavy on the malt that leaves a somewhat sweet taste in your mouth, while seemingly having an ever so slight hop taste. This is a nice brew, one I would get again."
"Red amber color iwth a quickly dissipating head. Fresh hoppy aroma, inital flavor had a brisk balanced flavor up front that gave way to a sweet malty flavor. Aftertaste was brief. This ale goes down smooth but is not very exciting. It was available at every restaurant I visited in Asheville NC. For flavor I would opt for the St. Therese Ale."
"A very nice dark golden orange/copper color with a small light tan head which reduced to the thinnest of bubble layers. Aroma is very balanced with hops and malts. The hops are mainly grapefruit and fruity in nature. This is well balanced with a sweet malty smell. There is also a slight caramel aroma. Taste is mainly hop oriented consisting of pine hops which lead to a nice bitter finish. Similar to the aroma there is a nice balance to this which makes it really drinkable. Overall the flavor is light and refreshing. Coats the mouth well and is relatively full bodied for a red ale. This is a good beer overall and is quite quaffable. I can see myself enjoying this easy drinker on a warm summer dayÂ…definitely worth a try."
"Solid oatmeal colored head. Transparent dark amber colored beer. Mildly sweet biscuit malt aroma. Soft mouthfeel on this moderately thick bodied beer. Biscuit malt carries over into the flavor, which is barely sweet and mixes in nicely with some caramel malt. A nice drinkable beer, lots of malt in there, easy drinking."
"The hops don't seem to play well with the malts, but worth a try."
"Drinkability: Tasty and I would definately recommend it."
"12 oz. brown bottle with no freshness date or abv listed."
"Pours a nice dark crimson with a smallish eggshell head. Nice lacing, little retention. Smells hoppy and a little bit like fig. I'm miffed on the fig but it smells good. Nice hop to malt balance here with the fruity malt coming out slightly ahead. Grassy in it's texture and body. Nice little citrus hop burn in the finish. Solid, yet different amber."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with interesting internal strands under a two finger beige head that is creamy smooth and slow to fade. Very nice lace on the glass. Good strong English hops aroma, crisp and clean. Well carbonated and substantially bodied mouth that is a bit sticky. Good barley malt opening with a touch of caramel. Nice crisp hoppy bite accompanies. Mild bitter aftertaste. This is a very good rendition of a British ale."
"One of my favorite North Carolina beers that I first tried in the mountains and was glad when I saw it available in Charlotte. A very drinkable amber that can be enjoyed all evening. Floral scent with flavor to match, not too hoppy. Great Irish Red. Nice frothy head and lacing around the glass . . . would like to see it in the stores as well."
"Pours with a full, light brown head that sits atop a clear deep amber-ruby beer. The aroma is sticky with malt notes and a hint of herbal, grassy hops as well. The aroma is quite intoxicating, with its sweet caramel malt notes. The taste is malty as well, though it is not as sweet as the aroma suggests, and it has lots of toasted malt notes. This is almost quite dry in its maltiness, perhaps there is a hint of smokiness as well. The finish is quite drying with its mix of toasted, cracker, roasted, and smoke malt flavors. This is a solid enjoyable beer."
"Pint at Barley's in Knoxville. I doubt it is an Irish Red Ale, more of a bastardized Oktoberfest. Very malty and well accomplished."
"Overall, I had a bit of a tough time with this offering from Highland Brewing. I guess I've had other amber ales where the flavors have meshed better. Still, this isn't bad; just nothing all that exciting."
"This is a very tasty, nicely balanced Scots/Irish style red ale that I'm becoming quite fond of. Very well balanced."
"From the bottle poured a deep reddish/copper color with a white foamy head. The head disappeared rather quickly. There was a fair amount of lace present in the glass, as was a great amount of tiny bubbles making the way to the top of the glass. The smells was toasted, almost to the roasted point, along with a slightly woody smell. Nice caramel flavor in the malt, with a modest amount of hop bitterness, but still balanced. Nice dry finish. Seemed a bit too carbonated, but I would say it was a pretty decent brew. I would not pass this one up if offered."
"A great tasting beer that needs to be served a little warmer than I got it. Try it if you can!"
"All and all a very drinkable and refreshing beer that would go well as a session beer or with dinner."
"Once poured it is a nice amber/ruby color. The aroma is very fragrant. The taste is smooth. A good blend of flavoring hops with the malt (some caramel and sweetness). According to the label the hops used are Cascade and Willamette.The finish is just a little dry. All in all a very flavorful and enjoyable beer."
"Pours a deep orangish-red with a very small head and minimal lacing. I'm actually wondering if the bottle was somehow damaged, the carbonation was so low. Aroma of roasted malt and light caramel. Palate is dominated by malt, with a flourish of light sweetness before a sharp bitterness on the finish. Overall I'm not a huge fan, but I'll have to try this one again. The bottle must have been old or damaged or both."
"12 oz bottle.Poured a dark amber color with a moderate head, that quickly faded leaving a fine ring of lacing on the glass. Aroma is hoppy with muted malt. Taste is slightly sweet, with a slight bitterness on the tongue. It finishes clean, with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a good session beer. I could sit and drink alot of these easily. Thanks Loki!"
"A clear, reddish amber body is topped by a short but creamy head of off-white foam that holds quite well and maintains a thin lid throughout the glass, but leaves little more than some transient, spotty lace. Toasty and sweetish caramel malts and citrusy/earthy hops combine with a touch of yeasty fruitiness to lend a sweetened-fruit and malt character to the nose. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, natural carbonation from bottle-conditioning leaves it dextrinous, creamy, and smooth across the palate. The rich maltiness found in the nose returns in the flavor, but this time it's more toasty than ""sweet"" caramel, with a very subtle roasted edge and some low-level diacetyl. Its tempered with more earthy/mineral hop flavors than citrus; and a solid bitterness balances it quite nicely and leaves it rich and satisfying but still drinkable as the sweet malts are no longer able to become cloying. It can, however, build on the palate a bit with its fullness. Still, a splash of water, nip of cheese, or crust of bread can instantly take that down. Impressive!"
"Thanks for the unique amber AKSmPort"
"My favorite everyday ale.Nice clear amber color pours with nice head that almost vanishes. Smells wonderful malty sweet with slight hops aroma. Taste is smooth and sweet with slight tingle of hops at the back on the way down. Light carbonation smooth wonderful to drink. Great amber ale my favorite, love the Cascade and Willamette Hops flavor use them for my homebrewing.If you live in North Carolina area have to try it, just leave me a six at the store."
"One of my favorite North Carolina brews. Great session beer. Get kegs of it for cookouts during the summer."
"This unusual offering pours a dark amber with a fading beige head and threads of clinging lace. A malty aroma pushes forth and a trail of floral hops lingers, then fades. A sweet malt body is fairly substantial with some caramel and fresh bread tastes. There's a bit of grapefruit bitterness along with light peppery spices. A lightly peaty and mildly astringent medicinal taste can be detected throughout. The alcohol is noticeable, though not over-bearing. All in all a nice, different sort of beer."
"I lived in Western North Carolina for 2 years and this was certainly my favorite local brew. Can't add much more to what has been said already except that I know it is brewed with a healthy dose of Special B malt. That is apparently the source of this beers excellent and unique malt flavor."
"Pours a reddish deep amber color with a tall and fluffy off-white head that clings to the sides of the glass as it fades into a creamy lace. Nose is dominated by toasted malts with additional notes of light floral hops. The same toasted malts are also the key players in the taste with flavors of sweet caramel and lead to a slightly chewy texture. Some faint hop bitterness is present towards the end but isnÂ’t enough to balance out this beer. If youÂ’re a malt lover, then I definitely recommend this brew. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Mouthfeel was nice and slick...I could drink a few of these...Thanks to Loki for this sampling"
"All-in-all a good beer. I enjoyed the Oatmeal Porter more but this is a very good effort."
"Tastes of lightly roasted sweet malt, much like a like Scottish style ale. Subtle caramel flavor with a delicate hop finish that seems just enough for balance, but not for a truly hoppy flavor. Beautiful and unique, definitely deserving of flagship status. Medium body with light carbonation that goes down smooth is crisp, clean, and very, very drinkable. A great beer."
"Thanks Loki!"
"Overall, I like this one. A good, balanced beer with a nice flavor and some character."
"Clean looking reddish/orange...not a lot of head....nose is fabulous...scottish ale type maltiness minus the smokey/peat smell...that is combined with a real fresh hop accent...great maltiness similiar to a lighter Scottish Ale....The hopping plays a secondary role but in a way really makes this beer as special as I believe it is....Mouthfeel is perfect...balanced...sweet but not overdone....a nice hoppiness lingers on the finish.....this is dandy...I am totally surprised as I did not know what to expect with this one....I would put this in my top 250 beers for sure...maybe top 100....( I don't have a list..I'm speaking in general terms)"
"Rich amber in color, with a little head. Nice malty aroma, with a bit of hops in the background. There is a decent medium bodied malt flavor, with a nice finish of hop bitterness, although not overpoweringly so. Overall, a pretty decent brew. I could sit and drink alot of these!"
"The Gaelic Ale is a deep copper in color with an average sized head. Nothing particularly impressive to view. I find that hops are the dominant quality of the aroma. Quite piney and citrusy to smell. Taste is initially of malt then quickly followed by intense hop presence. Very IPA-ish and definitely contrary to the sweet, malty Scottish style I expected (being named Gaelic and all). Do not interpret as disappointed, but rather surpried. I like hops. It has a sweet and spicey flavor, followed quickly by the pine-like hop characteristics."
"Tasted: 07/29/03"
"Drinkability: I liked this more as it warmed. There was an aftertaste I just can't figure out that was on the unpleasant side. Not one that I'd ask for again, but drinkable in its own right."
"Color here is a dark ruby, but there is no head that I can report. Aroma is sweet and fruity. Malt is huge in this ale, hops have a small role, but still, the body is full, and the mouthfeel generous and tasty. Much more flavorful than other ales I've encountered recently. Worthy to associate itself with Irish reds. Thanks to Uglyradio."
"My thanks to johnrobe for sending this to me. This was pretty good, deserving of this brewery's ""flagship beer"" status. Pours a deep amber color with a medium and foamy light tan head. Aroma of malt and caramel. Medium-bodied with an assertive malt flavor and a touch of hops. Finish is sweet but not overly so. Not bad at all."
"This beer pours a hazy, orange copper color topped by a generous tan head. The head fades to a layer of film interspersed with pillows of foam. A sheeting lace is left on the glass. The aroma is strong roasted malt, with caramel and a touch of peat. A bit of fruit and fresh bread smells are also mixed in. Hops are not discernable. The taste is very appealing, with the strong raosted malt dominating, but with a decent smoked peat component. A hint of sweetness and carmelized sugar chimes in as well. A bit of bitterness lingers on the finish, but it is faint enough to make one wonder if it is hops or just bitterness from roasted malts. The aftertatse reveals a bit more of a pine note, verifying that there really is a low level hopping in this brew. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, with mild carbonation accentuating the buttery feeling on the tongue. The drinkability is very good, and I wish I had more than one of these beers. It is an excellent brew that I will purchase again."
"This brew looks stunning in the glass...a clear deep reddish amber with a cream colored head that reduces to a cap. The smell is of caramel malt and a combination of fruity esters and citrusy hops....I can pick out some grapefruit, pineapple, maybe grapes. There's a nice hops bite to this one and it continues to be quite fruity in taste. Some candy-nougat sweet malt comes up for support but lacks some oomph, IMO, which contributes to a slightly thin mouthfeel. Still the taste is pretty good and this would make an excellent session pale/amber ale."
"From my perspective, this is a nice combination of malt sweetness and hop balance that makes for a very refreshing brew. It pours a nice amber color with malt and hop overtones dominating the nose. My first thought was Pale Ale but after further review, it was definately an amber ale at heart. I like it. The nice smooth hop finish and sweet malts give you something to come back to."
"Nice mahogany color,decent,had a musty somewhat fruity smell.A well-crafted brew like better on tap,its a little more fruity.Has a light touch of hops to finish it out,with no real lingering aftertaste.Highland is a nice brewing company have been to Barleys taproom to try many of theres on tap."
"Another great beer form the South! These guys know thier stuff about brewing. It's ashame though, that I can hardly find it here in Va. It is abundant down in my home state of SC. It's golden and has a little head to it, but that goes away after a few minutes. But the head doesn't necessarily make the beer and this prooves it. They have a good line of quality beers, so give 'em a chance if you can."
"Slightly mired amber nether a thin grasping head. Nose is alternately big toasty malt and floral hop. Nicely balanced mild roast malt back to citric hop front. A mite fizzy, but good."
"Highland's Gaelic Ale pours a deep amber color with a short-lived white head. Smell is of citric Cascade hops at first, accompanied by a lingering malt aroma. Taste is more on the malty side, but the balance the hops provide is appealing. Pretty smooth mouthfeel with a medium body. Easy drinking, it's not hard to quaff more than a few of these. A pretty solid amber ale all the way through."
"Beautiful, clear body somewhere in between deep amber and ruby. Off-white head is ok, but doesn't last long. Big malt in aroma backed up by citric hops. Flavor is nice toasty malt with the support of moderate hopping. Not a bad beer at all."
"A very average amber ale, not the best but worth drinking again. Nice malty taste, not much aroma and very good appearance. Its a good beer for the novice who drinks mass produced crap...............CHEERS"
"Don't let the amber ale style throw you off. This is quite a unique offering indeed. Malts impart the perfect level of sweetness and deep amber color. Full bodied and balanced exceptionally with Cascade and Willamette hops."
