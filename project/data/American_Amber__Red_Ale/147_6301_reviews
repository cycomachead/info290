"O- this is probably the most flavorful beer that I've had under 4.5%, sad that I waited this long to try it as it's one of the best session beers that I've had"
""
""
""
""
""
"Hops are the most prominent flavor. Has a pleasant citrus and pine tatse. I like less hops for the style, but Stone didn't over do it. The maltiness is hiding in the background. Pretty good!"
""
"Levitation is a great beer, without a doubt a Stone beer. It has hops and a malty flavor. Lighter then Stone's other brews, but still fantastic."
""
""
"Pours dark reddish black with very little head.  Has a light coffee aroma.  Watered down roasted malt taste ending in a more bitter coffee taste.  Okay beer.  More of a porter than a red ale.  A little watered down but decent."
"O - It's really sad to see this one go. Very un-Stone, but in a good way. Subtle without giving up complexity."
""
""
"Poured into a Stone gargoyle pint.  Pours a medium coppery amber with a fine two finger light khaki head with good retention and heavy lacing. Aroma of caramel male, citrus and piney hops. Flavor is piney, lightly resinous hops with light citrus, mildly caramel malt with some biscuit; finishes with pine resin, citrus rind and black pepper. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A quite hop forward amber ale, but the resinous hops are well supported by the malt and the peppery finish is great. Sessionable ambers are not one of my go to styles, but this is quite nice and I'd have it again if it wasn't being discontinued. Glad I got to try it while it still is around, it is very flavorful and hoppy for its ABV."
"This is probably my favorite amber ale.  It's a shame it's being discontinued.  Wonderful citrusy aroma and very nicely balanced.  It has a much bigger body than many of the numerous new session ipas around these days.  I guess it's designation as an amber sealed it's fate.  I rate my beers by style, and I think this is as good as it gets in this category."

"12oz. Straight from the bottle. Grassy, fresh, hoppy nose. The front is bitter hop, with an smooth earthy finish, and a smooth slightly carbonated mouth feel. Although low on the ABV% scale, very good overall."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is drinkable, and, well, it's a very Stone-like take on an Amber. I'd drink it again given a choice, but a bit more malt character would improve the experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"The somewhat low ABV is pretty apparent in this one. It's not bad, but it felt and tasted a bit weak to me."
"Poured a nice clear red body with a half finger of bubbly off-white head. Quite nice looking, a good amber ale. Scents of piney, grassy hops, earthy, dank hops, moderate toasted malt and light amounts of grainy malt and caramel. Overall impression of aroma is of a rather hop forward amber ale, quite unbalanced and very much a Stone version of the style. Flavor begins quite bitter, following the aroma with pine resin and grassy herbal hop flavors mingling with toasted malt and a very faint presence of caramel. Middle continues to be bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel, grassy hops and light amounts of toasted malt and caramel in the background, very faintly discernible. Finish is dry with notes of pine resin, bitter floral and herbal hops and grapefruit peel. Aftertaste is bitter with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and light cracker-like malt. Overall impression of flavor is of a rather bitter amber ale, balanced very much towards the hops with just enough malt to provide some basic semblance of balance. Not horrible, but a bit simple. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a resinous, drying feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a drying beer that urges you to drink more. Overall this is alright for an amber. I feel it is a bit too hoppy at the expense of other flavors and comes across as unbalanced even in comparison to other hoppy ambers such as Marble's. Not bad, but lacking."

""
""
"O:  Good beer.  Could've been better, though.  Somewhat too light for my palate."
""

""
""
"Pretty hoppy for an Amber Ale.  Taste okay, but very watery, thin feel.  Disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer, the malts and hops are perfect together in this beer"
""
""
"O -  A good amber, have had this before and thought it was solid.  A good low ABV beer that could only be improved with a touch more heft and substance."
"A great choice for a sessionable Ale. Has great flavor for such a low ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great looking pour.  Subtle aromas with outstanding hop flavors and a hint of hops on the back end."
""
""
""
"Sampled from bottle.  Rich brown with a whisper of head.  Cloudy with sediment floaties.  Nose is very vegetal, celery smell rushes from the glass.  Behind the celery, malt and hazelnut are apparent.  Taste is that of rich malty brown bread with a brown sugar sweetness.  All in all solid but not at all special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice  dark amber color. VERY Hoppy, with the pine and grapefruit flavors being very prominent. Not one of the better ones by Stone I've had but that's because of the style of this brew."
"O: Not bad. Most of Stone's beers are aggressively hopped, and This is less of an amber ale than it is a Red IPA, albeit sessionable. I think the low alcohol content makes the beer taste watery and makes the hops stand out a little more than they should."
""
"Outlier detected. Please enter a review."
"Bitter, dry, non-descript.  Disappointing given Stone's reputation."
""
""
""
""
"Final score: 3.98"
"taste like a grass cliping tea...."

"Overall: A+ 94-97; Shocked but not shocked. It's a Stone product so my expectations were high, it surpassed them. I would say that this will be my go-to session beer from now on. So smooth, so much flavor, lovely hop profile."

"O: Stone offers a lovely take on this style, substantially beefing up the hop presence in this style to really add their signature touch on it. While I wouldn't reach for this all the time, it serves as an absolutely perfect beer for BBQs, game night, or just any night when you're looking for great hop flavors in a beer that doesn't weigh you down too much."

"Always enjoy Stone's Beers. Always full of flavor and an all around great beer. This one does not disappoint but there was a slight turn-off. As the flavor was ok and the smell and appearance were really nice, I felt that this beer was way too carbonated. I do not see a dateon the bottle so I do not know how fresh or how old this is. Too much carbonation spoiled the overall flavor but still a decent beer. As far as the Stone beers I have tried, this one is on the bottom of the list"

"Notes: A session beer that is easily drinkable yet flavorful."
""
""
"Very nice flavor profile, and goes down very easily. Kudos to Stone. I had been down on them lately with their base IPA, and the Go to IPA, but they have redeemed themselves with this one."
""
""
""
""
"Mahoghony brown with a half inch thick tightly knit beige head. Great clarity and Brussels lacing is present. Aroma of caramel and tropical fruit scented hops. The flavor is more tropical fruit hop forward with caramel malt. While there is a long,yet mild hop fade there is more of a caramel malt aftertaste. The body is lighter and yet lightly sticky and moderately carbonated. I think it must be due to the lighter ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"looks good smells ok. the taste is way too spicy for how light mouthfeel and alchohol is has. stay away from this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2010 On tap. The dark color portends the caramel rich flavor, both of which belie the easy going body. Too bad I'm not more taken w/the flavor as this could become a fast friend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but not awesome. It’s a good beer, not the best by stone. Would go well with pizza."

"O: more complex than some ambers, a very nice, big tasting beer, particularly relative to the ABV."

"D really nice hop blaster - but honestly if I had known about the low abv I wouldve gone with another stone selection."
""
""
""
"This pours a caramel amber in color. It’s much darker than I remembered, with a thick cap of khaki foam. There’s a light and lemony roast aroma. The flavor has an upfront piney bitterness with a bit of burnt caramel, and something which makes me think of burnt popcorn as it finishes. There’s so much flavor for such a low abv!"

"O: I'd love to try this fresher - right now it seems a touch 'stale'. That, and I could use some more estery action to make it properly great. Stone makes other beer that I'd go after first, but this would make a decent fallback nonetheless."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer, carmelly to start, grapefruit in the main body, and pine to finish. Definitely enjoyed drinking it."
""
""
"O: Very flavorful with a really nice hop presence and quite sessionable due to the low ABV. Definitely one I would grab again and I can't believe this is the first time I have tried it."

"O - A very very solid drinking beer, great balance, and a very good balanced hoppy amber, unfortunately the mouthfeel left a bit to be desired and the taste was missing just a hint of something."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Overall, this is a very solid beer. From start to finish, I found it to be very enjoyable and very drinkable. Although this beer is available year round, I recommend it be enjoyed in the waning Summer/early fall months (as many amber ales are). Not quite a session drinking beer, I wouldn't mind having a few of these around to enjoy from time to time. All in all, this beer was a pleasant surprise. From start to finish, I found this beer to be very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On the palate it drinks quite thick with a burning fast bitterness that fades before the clean aftertaste."
""
""
"Much more malt character than expected, but it's nicely countered by both hop flavoring and bittering. The bittering is a touch more than I prefer, but depth of malt flavor and citrus keep me content."
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer( to sum it up). Could use a little more depth in my opinion but still worth having again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has a good hop flavor. I would prefer some more presence from the malt, but that would most likely push this beer farther from session territory. If you want a beer with a low abv and big hop presence, this is exactly that. For me personally, with this amount of hops, the lack of body from the lower abv takes away from this one."

"This ale pours a gorgeous deep reddish copper color with a thick white head that lasts well into the beer. It does finally give way to a nice film and spiderweb lacing. The aroma is more subtle than I've come to expect from Stone but delicious none the less. There is a lot of sweet malts on the nose with an underlying hoppy bitterness, mostly citrus and pine. The flavor is quite sweet at first with lots of malt and caramel notes this is followed by a bit of a bitter hop bite that resolves to a nicely balanced finish. The ale sips quite light and easy, almost too much so. I'd honestly like a little more coating and lasting flavor with this one. This is a nice amber/red ale but nowhere near the best of the offerings out there."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: very balanced and tasty - has a nice hop profile and is very robust for a session beer"

"O - It's a good refreshing ale. A lot flavor for %4.4 ABV. A nice choice if you want to kick back a 6pk with a buddy but don't want to get smashed and don't want a lager."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - While not my favorite Red Ale around this is still a good solid beer. With an ABV of 4.4% this would be a decent brew to kick back and enjoy a few."
""
""
""
"Good middle of the road, standard ale.  Color is reddish, caramel.  Nose is clean, but not floral in the least.  Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, with a mild bitterness on the end, which is welcomed.  The carbonation is well balanced.  This is a very drinkable, daytime beer when you want to enjoy multiple drinks over an extended period of time.  With a 4.4% abv, this is expected."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber color with a big cloudy puffy marshmellowy head. Smells like hops and citrus. A somewhat chewy, thin mouthfeel. Very refreshing. Hops and citrus are balanced nicely with a faint malty undertone. Lots of flavor and super sessionable, a great beer for working in the yard on a hot day."
"O - not bad at all, but not my favorite from the category. Still favoring Censored from Lagunitas in Northern California."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Pretty good. Less bitter than many Stone offerings but plenty of flavor. Pretty boozy for the low ABV. It’s not the first amber ale I’ll reach for, but there’s a good chance that I will reach for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm a hop head and I'm surprised it took me this long to try Levitation Ale. There's a great amount of piney, sharp, citrus-y hops. It's definitely more towards the bitter side but not as bitter as some other ales I have had. There's also a pleasant lightness to the beer."

"O: nothing terribly unique about this beer.... like a fool, I imagined maybe this would be the black sheep Stone beer that wasn't hopped to high hell.... on the other hand, this might just be the most drinkable and my favorite of Stone's lighter-hued ales that I've had"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: The mouthfeel is similar to other inferior beers with similar alcohol contents, but not much else is. This is a solid session beer with a nice balanced flavor. I honestly had to double check the label to believe it was only 4.4%. If Stone's goal was pack as much flavor into a low-alcohol beer as possible, they accomplished that masterfully. This would be a great beer to introduce your non-craft drinking friends to. It is solid, but doesn't overwhelm in any way."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was unexpectedly light. I know it is 4.4, but I wasn't expecting it to be so tame. There was some good flavor there, but nothing to write home about. If most commercial beers were like this, we would have a better world in general, but for a Stone brew, not impressed."
""
""
""
"Like the nose the taste has an exquisite pine, grass, and floral character that is a bit more forward than any biscuit malts but they still do not take everything over. Drinkable and fascinating."
"O: This beer is so good and I think it deserves a way better rating than the one it has. The taste and feel is so refreshing that I'm going to start buying packs of these for a go-to beer. This is truly some good stuff."
"Overall: I love this beer. The only thing holding back my scores is that I would like the malt to be a little more of a factor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this and at 4.4% ABV this is a great session beer, and one I should have reviewed long ago as it has always gone down easy."
""
""
""
"To me, this brew competes with other full bodied brews that are absolutely sessionable, and wins. This is my new favorite ""light"" beer."

"O - This is a very light and drinkable beer. Given what Stone does with beers, like beefing them up, this is quite a light beer. Not much to say, if you're looking for a nice introduction to the craft beer world from one of the finest Craft Brewers in the world, this is a great start. Can't go wrong. I will have again."
""
"I'm not thrilled. It's just OK. I don' think I'll get any more. I find the watery lightness is not completely compensated by the sparkle. There's a bit too much grain bitterness for my taste. A larger proportion of a lighter carmel grain would help remove some of the grain bitterness, boost the alcohol and add some body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice amber ale for the hop heads, refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""
""
"I was hoping that this beer, at a 4.4% ABV, could offer significant flavor and be a highly drinkable beer while keeping that low alcohol level--something that today beers seem to be having trouble doing as the only flavorful beers are rising in ABV. This offers a good smattering of flavors, with some uumph from the hops and malt flavors that don't back down, but it's not nearly as flavorful as I hoped. Worse, the mouthfeel is too thin. Overall, the beer lacks a solid body and distinctive flavors. It would have been nice to find a fairly low ABV beer out there that offers what the higher ABV beers bring to the table, but this one doesn't."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a pretty great session-type beer. I really mean it when I say it drinks like an approachable ""Bastard"" because the hop profile is so similar to Arrogant B, albeit a bit toned down in this format. I also enjoy the mouthfeel; this beer manages to drink well, while providing some substance on the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouth: Dry and evenly carbonated, this beer is easily drinkable. Could maybe use a little more body to make up for the acidity of the hops. It's only 4.4% ABV too."
""
"Aroma: fresh citrussy hops, herbs earth and metallic amber malts. Appearance: deep, brownish purple with a thin foam. Taste: strong bitter hop overtones which is is not typical of amber ales (expected from stone though). Other notes of deep caramel, molasses, sugar, metallic notes and syrupy maple. Overall, I'm typically not a fan of amber ales, but this is hopped up to my tastes, it's very enjoyable."

"This ones a mixed bag, while it's low ABV makes it a great session ale it also hinders it in the amber field. The aroma seems to be the strongest aspect of this one with its IPA like hop smells. There's better ambers out, much better."
"This brew is a deep amber color with a pretty sad off white head almost no lacing on my glass. It smells of sweet caramel malts and some nice piney hops. There is a very pleasant aroma to this brew. I found the taste to be quite malty but it has some definite hop bitterness that balances it out nicely. This beer is not yellow, it’s not fizzy and it doesn’t taste like water but it clocks in at a measly 4.4% abv. This is good and I’m happy drinking but I would just step it up to the IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good session beer, but way too expensive for what it is. I try to not let my wallet influence reviews, but when I'm paying what this costs, I would prefer to be satisfied with one beer. I would have this around often if it was more affordable. But still, it is overall a very good brew."
"o- a good session amber. Better cold."

"Overall - an amber ale for the hop head! Stone hits a home run with this one in my opinion!"

"Pours a clear mahogany, with a creamy off-white head. Smells of pinecones, and a hint of oak. Taste begins with a sharp grapefruit peel bite, then some rye bread, and finishes with a long piney bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall an excellent amber ale. It is really a nice beer for hop-heads, it is as hoppy as some of the new 'session' IPA's ive had."
""
"O- This is a pretty good beer. Very good session beer. Not the strongest flavors in the world, but excellent for what it is."

"Pours a pretty dark amber color with a 1+-finger tan head. The head doesn't last long and settles down to a very small head mostly around the edges of the glass. Leaves lots of lacing when sipped. The aroma is mostly of hoppy grains. the taste was pretty much the same with a hint of some dark fruit. A bitter aftertaste hits you right up front from the hops. Does linger around until the next sip. LOL!"

"Roast beef and potatoes would make a good food pairing with this beer."

"O-I enjoy the beer, but it isn't a great representation of the style. Too hoppy and not nuanced enough, IMO."
""
""
""
""
"Session character: Levitation clocks in at a modest 4.4% ABV - hurrah! Thanks to Stone - no stranger in the hoppy, high-octane ale movement for producing a beer with this much flavor, while being so friendly to drinking 'by volume'!"
"D: Very drinkable. A great hoppy fix with big bready malt presence and all wrapped in a very light little package. This is one of those beers I often underestimate just how good it is. Great balance and loaded with flavor for a sessions."

"Mid. 2011 Review: 25 cl. drat @ Stone vs. Moeder event: red amber with an off-white head, smells like grapefruit & pine hops, light caramel, taste is moderate but full pine & grapefruit hops, malty, slightly fruity, caramel, medium bitterness, pretty damn good given its abv."

"Pours a deep red with small to no head. Aroma of big earthy hops. Flavor is very dry with earthy piney hops and a big biscuit malt backbone. Slick and dry mouthfeel. Steers away from most ambers with the big bitter hop presence and I love that. Medium high carbonation. Solid beer that I would be happy to have any time."

"Overall a really good beer. One of the most flavorful ales I've had."
""
""
"Overall- Solid beer. I wasn't even sure what style of beer this was supposed to be but as I was expecting something lighter, I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth a try."
"Appearance was a nice orange/light amber, lots of carbonation and a nice lacing. Smell is very hoppy up front, but not so strong in the taste. Taste was hoppy but with a nice malty and bready aftertaste. Sits well; very drinkable and has become one of my favourites to session and from Stone in general."

""
"Im going to buy a case next time and I will try to update. One interesting note is the modest ABV. The beer tastes strong and powerful but with a listed ABV of 4.4% it is a step back from the 6-10+% brews that fill the rest of my fridge. A strong beer would fit this drink well, but the Levitation Ale sits right. Its the perfect mid-afternoon drink."

"Bought a six-pack at Table and Vine in West Springfield, MA. Beer poured with a nice amber appearance with medium retention and decent lacing. Aromas had an initial hint of caramel and malts, while subsequent breaths brought up smells of wood and bread. Flavors definitely highlighted the bread with some malt and sweet citrus. Great mouthfeel; really liked the carbonation, which helped make the drink really refreshing to drink. A very great beer and a pleasure for the evening,."

"One of Stone Brewing's most sessionable beers, only 4.4% but in no way does Stone relinquish their intense flavor. Pours a dark red copper with good retention. For a Red Ale they use a lot of hops but I really appreciate it. It's a pretty complex beer, good combination of both malt and hop. Has a slight oily mouthfeel. Overall a great brew with high drinkability because of the low ABV and the amazing taste."
""
"o: Screams quality in its look and smell, and the lingering bitterness grows more interesting. The low ABV makes it eminently sessionable, and served cold on a hot day this could be a real welcome winner, as it was for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall, one of the best hoppy red ales I've ever tasted. I like it better that Green Flash Hop Head Red. Definitely give it a try if you can find it fresh."
""
""
""
""
"I can see the appeal, it’s a very good session beer. Another solid offering from Stone."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not enough malt for what I am normally looking for in an amber, though what you would expect from a Stone beer. Nice aroma but needs more in the flavor profile. If I was looking for an IPA I would judt get one of their other options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I very much enjoyed this beer. It’s very light, refreshing, and tasty. A lot of my enjoyment came from the aroma alone. I could easily drink a few of these and not get tired of them. I would have maybe liked to see a tad bit more maltiness or something to balance out the bitterness."

""
""

"Pretty flavorful beer, but a bit too hoppy for my tastes. This would be a great beer for those who like hops, as the low abv means you could drink several easily."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Fair to middling' IPA disguised as a red ale. Kinda grows on you as you get to the tail end of the beer, but I am not sure if I would buy again. It doesn't seem to know what kind of beer it is."
"Aroma is piney hops, citrus, malts and mild fruit. Flavor is citrus, grapefruit, biscuit/earthy malts, fruit and a tangy/bitter finish. Among the best session ales I've ever had, this is a great every day ale and even with the low abv its the best amber ale I've every had."

"Overall, a delicious session ale. I can think of very few beers less than 5%abv that can stand up to the intensity of flavor, and balance of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite Stone brew, but it's still a very good beer. A perfect beer for anyone who likes the taste of hops, but doesn't enjoy the bitterness and explosion of a ton of hops. I do enjoy beers like that, but there are times when I want a lighter, more crisp tasting hoppy beer, and this beer does the trick. Highly recommended."

"O- A well done hoppy amber. Low abv makes this one of the more favorable sessions I've had. Not quite as bold as most from the Stone line, but a solid beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Gruff earthy hops and crisp orange and toast notes. Roasty, actually, with bitter pith and flavorful pine woodiness. So smooth and wonderful in the mouth. Chewy with a presence of dextrins, but light enough to never coat and always deliver with that spiky carb and gentle hop oiliness on the tongue. American hop heaven for a lighter early evening opener. Magically drinkable. Exceptional stuff, certainly deserving of all the accolades."

"Flavors of bitter hops, grapefruit rind, persimmon, grassy hops, white pepper. Despite the relatively low abv this brew has significant flavor and punch. A respectable hoppy session brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dig this brew - it's not going to impress anyone at a beer-drinkers hipster party, just a solid drinkable beer for a session."
""
""
""
"O - This was pretty tasty. More hop forward than I was expecting which was nice. The only place it fell short was in the mouth feel which I cant ding it to much being such a low abv. This would be a great session beer that I could drink all day and not get too hammered."
""
""
""
""
"There is nothing unique or exciting about this beer, but dang if I didn't enjoy it. It poured up a deep amber/copper color with a small head, not a lot of lacing, but decent retention. The smell is very pine, floral, bready, citrusy. Taste is about the same as the nose. Citrus is the predominant flavor and it is all I can do to savor and enjoy it. It's sort of like a SNPA. It's hardly thr greatest beer ever brewed, but it sure is enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
""

"a lot of ales i've had have that hoppy bite- which is good, but this levitation ale from stone is just smooth, and drinkable and somehow full flavored. it has great color and a nice smell....smells like a good ale. this beer doesnt have the bite that a lot of stone's beers have, but sometimes you dont need to be drop kicked in the face. i like this beer a good bit."

"Levitation Ale is pretty much the lightest beer Stone offers, and is a great light beer. It's probably still on the stronger end of the spectrum of American Ambers, which is to be expected from Stone. I've only had this once, because it's difficult to find in my area."

"The beer pours a light caramel red. The body is incredibly clear and free of sediment, and the head of the beer is light and soapy white, but bubbles away quickly to leave a light scrim and some thin wavy lacing on the glass. The beer smells terrifically big and bitter, with gushes of pine, citrus, and a light note of juicy mango mingling with the candy caramel malts beneath the hops. It smells tremendously hoppy for a 4.4% Amber Ale, which is what Stone bills it as, personally, thought, I see this beer as a sessionable IPA with a darker body. Stone calls it an amber ale though, and honestly, style doesn’t really matter. There is a nice resiny touch to the smell of the beer when agitated, which further marks this beer as an IPA to me. On the palate, this beer continues the IPA trend. The beer begins with light bitter pine before opening into big bitter citrus with a sweet caramel traveling beneath the hops and balancing this beer beautifully. For all its bitter flavor, this is a lighter beer that finds a beautiful balance with the light alcohol and malts keeping the hops to a comfortable and thirst quenching bitter bite and enough flavor for you to compete with beers far bigger than it. The finish of the beer is bitter and full of hints of grapefruit and light cereal malts. On the mouth, this beer feels light to medium in body with a nice little fizzle from the carbonation, which smoothes the beer onto the tongue, leaving the mouth with a very thin sheen of cool spittle, and a light dry bitter lingering in the mouth. It is actually quite refreshing in feeling, which may stem from its lower alcohol percentage. Overall this is a superb beer. Its hugely hoppy, yet balanced, yet completely sessionable. Stone has really done something neat with this beer, and I really hope that others continue to follow suit because this is something I could sip all day and it would not make me fall over at the end of the day. A session beer for the hop heads, and a delicious success for Stone. It is a little too hop-forward for me to consider it an amber/red ale, but really that’s just semantics. The beer is good. Drink it."

"Dark reddish amber in color. Not alot of head, recedes rather quickly leaving some lacing. Very nice aroma. Very hoppy, citrus and pine resin. The taste is very mild and leans more toward the hoppy side for an amber ale. Light bodied with a bitter, somewhat roasty finish. A bit unbalanced I think as the bitterness is a little dominant and I don't pick up any malt sweetness at all. Still, very drinkable and a good session option for sure."

"O: This beer gets worse the more you get into it. It looks great, smells pretty good, tastes weird, and goes down like water. Very disappointing. I get that Stone was trying something different by making a light, low-ABV ""session"" brew loaded up with hops, but it just doesn't work that well, and it's certainly impossible to imagine drinking a lot of these in a session."
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with medium to low levels of carbonation. The beer could stand to be a bit more carbonated without suffering. The resultant mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, crisp, somewhat smooth. Closes dryly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I kind of like this beer. Especially since it has a low ABV and has some nice hop flavors. I wish it was thicker. It's basically a light IPA."

"Garbage, hot trash, red lobster dumpster, garlic, onion, just garbage."

"Reviewed from notes"

"bottle to pint glass. Pours a rich dark amber with half a finger of foam. Poor retention, moderate lacing. Smell of hops, citrus, caramel, and a biscuit malt. Tastes of hops, brown nut, and caramel malt. Thick body, very chewey. Overall it's not too bad, pours red but taste is reminiscent of an ipa. Not a lot of flavor going on, though. Unless I'm looking for a session ale I don't think I'll be drinking much of this"
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: It's nice that Stone released with low ABV beer and they definitely prove the point that 'light' beer doesn't have to be light on flavor. Would I drink it again? Possibly on tap during a session."
""
""
"O - I was excited to try this beer. Friends mark this a one of there ""go-to"" session suds. I'm hesitant to do so, so quickly. I am impressed with the amount of flavor packed into such a low ABV brew though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I like this beer, and would recommend it. But I think the intent of this beer was missed - the low malt backbone makes the hop flavor and slight roast flavors so high that it makes the beer fairly unsessionable and to me (right now) borderline undrinkable."
""
""
""

"Poured this red ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear amber color, produced a thick creamy off white head. Excellent retention and lacing left on the glass. The aroma consisted of toasted malt, and earthy hops. Medium in body, this ale has a foundation of fresh baked bread, roasted malt, citrus and piney hop flavor. Overall a nice example of this style, well balanced. Great session beer."
""
""
""
"this is the most flavor you can possibly get into a beer under 5% abv, im convinced. it pours clear dark amber in color, surprisingly dark after a swig from the bottle. theres a fluffy lazy white head patiently fading. smell is red malts without the sugar, fresh resiny hops, some grapefruit. lots of hops for a red. flavor is balanced amazingly, malt flavors and aromas first, hop bitterness at the end. almost fresh from the vine hops, really pungent, dank, and yummy. some copper in the aftertaste, minerally, long lasting. theres great carbonation, feels likghter than it really it. this is one of the better session beers ive had, a 10 dollar 6pack is a perfect monday night football pick. cant believe i waited so long to try this one."

"There's nothing particularly captivating about the anything here. If you want a session beer that's an amber ale, you could choose far worse brews -- in both the craft and macro worlds -- than Levitation. You can also do much better."

"O-One of my least favorite Stone's...that says a lot about the brewery, but not too much about the beer."

I love to just sit and sip on this enjoyable brew.... On the strong side if you're not into a beer with hoppier taste, but I can promise you that this is one of the tastiest beers out of the Stone Brewery.... A must have."

""
"Impressive beer for what it is - definitely sessionable, low ABV, but excellent flavor for this category. The deeper flavor reminds of some of the English pale ales yet low ABV. Definite hop flavor but they are mild and very dry. This beer is not new - at least a year old yet the flavor is still good. Brown to amber color in the glass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a very good straight ahead beer. The balance is perfect. And, at an incredibly low ABV, a perfect session beer."
"Overall: When you want a quality, well crafted beer with not a lot of alcohol, Levitation should be near the top of your list."
""
""
"Pours an inviting hazelnut with some light tan foam etching the surface. Nose pulls give me hints of orange and lemon zests, light malts, hints of cola and tea. Flavor is yummy english like malts and plenty of citrusy hops. The citrus cannot be understated in this one for me - it's really on the back end when I breath: nice orange rinds with some hints of grapefruit. The malts are pekoe in character. The beer is carried in a medium weight with lively carb and a wet finish. Nice beer - really drinkable and I wish Stone would can this one."

"O- A good offering, but at the price-point ($10+ 6-Pack) for a 4.4% ABV beer, that seems a little excessive. If the price was paired down to $6-8 a 6'er, than I'd be singing (and slinging) its praises for a wonderful year-round, session beer."

"O: Dissappointing, overall. I wanted to like this, given the look and low ABV, but it just doesn't deliver. Has that strange bitter hop/sweet taste I just can't get into. Not a drain pour, but I won't be buying or drinking this again soon. More interesting then a macro light lager, but at 3x the price and the same ABV, I'll take a Bud Light."
""
"O- Every time I head to Buffalo I see this and check the date, I bought this in early July and the BB date is the freshest I've ever seen for this so I took a chance. I'd love to try it fresher but being in Canada and relying solely on Buffalo stores I think this is good as it's going to get..."

"The beer pours an opaque hazy red with a bubbly white head. The smell is light floral hops, very nice. It's very carbonated, a little too much... the hops are in front in the taste just like in the smell, definitely bitter - I guess I shouldn't expect any less from Stone considering their other offerings. I was expecting a little maltiness since this is an amber ale but I can't pick out anything over the hops. It's a supremely drinkable beer, a nice feat considering the hop-packed flavor."

Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice rings spotty lacing cling to the glass as you drink. Aromas of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, mango, floral, pine, herbal, pineapple, and toast. Pretty nice and well balanced aromas; but a bit muted. Taste of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, caramel, pine, herbal, floral, and toast. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, herbal, caramel, and toast on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop flavors with caramel malt sweetness; almost perfect contrast. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is not really noticed at all, as expected for 4.4%. Overall this is a very nice amber ale! Very flavorful and balanced; and extremely easy drinking of course. If I am looking for a nice session beer I would not pass this up."

"By far one of my top beer! Very hoppy but has a great malt balance. Seems like a lighter ipa. If your not quite ready for ipas yet this is where you should start. Goes down very smoothly and has a high drinkablilty. I could definitely use this as a session beer."

"O - This is a pretty good beer. It’s well-balanced like a good amber ale should be, but it’s somewhat confusing because the nose was more hop-heavy while the taste was more malt-heavy. It’s also a little on the lighter side in terms of body, but that kind of makes sense considering the low ABV. Despite these characteristics, this is a really nice session beer. Stone never disappoints."
"This style is hit or miss with me and this time it definitely was a miss. I did not find this beer enjoyable or flavorful, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to turn in my Stone Fan Club pin just yet. This brewer has several outstanding beers. In my opinion, this isn't one of them."

"Overall – While only at 4.4 % this beer has some really wonderful characteristics. It has a nice look, smell, mouthfeel and taste that are all much more characteristic of a beer of a much higher abv. Very well done."

""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, for the strength of this brew is sure packs in plenty of flavor. Maybe a little too expensive to be a regular session brew but it is great on occasion."

"O/D-Overall, a pretty solid Amber. Well hopped but excellently balanced. Not my favorite Stone brew but its damn tasty the most of the other regularly available brews."
""

"O- A good, but not great amber ale. I'd certainly have it again if offered it, but wouldn't seek it out vs. others such as NB Fat Tire."

"This beer won the 2007 Gold Medal Winner in the Great American Beer Festival. It has solid taste, and great feel. Easy drinkable, but as the warmer weather comes, it is not my preference. In the past I have never been a fan of Stone brews, but this one definitely changed my mind about the quality of brews from this brewery. Like most great beer, this beer has great head. I poured from a bottle to a pint glass and it poured with ease. It is definitely a beer I will buy more of."
""
""
""
"O - Good variant of an amber that stands on its own. I'd have it again. Just another solid brew from the folks at Stone."
"Overall another solid beer from Stone. Maybe not my favorite style but I can imagine this pairing well w/ a good stinky cheese or a burger. And 4.4% ABV = great session beer. One more please!"
"Pours a translucent dark amber with no head. The bouquet is very nice with tart citrus, cabbage, and pine. The flavor is vibrant but has that signature Stone overwhelming hop character. The mouthfeel is nice, but adversely impacted by the intrusive hop presence. I've had a lot of Stone, but the only one I've found to be good is Sublimely Self-Righteous."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours slightly hazy amber with an eggshell colored two-finger length head. The head dissipates slowly. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption as well as a light cap of lacing. The aroma of piney hops is strong. There are also citrus and malt aromas as well. It's a very earthy smell. The big hop flavors hit up front to perfectly support the mild malt flavors. The citrus and sweetness are subdued, but present. It's incredibly well balanced. There is a slight bitter aftertaste. The body to this beer is actually surprisingly quite light, though it would be more light to medium. The carbonation is not strong, but this beer is still very easy to drink. Overall, this is another solid offering from Stone. It's a sessionable hop forward ale."

"O - While it is light bodied, that's the point. And for that, it has great flavor. I really appreciate the balance of malt and hops. This is a great job and would be the perfect session beer. Flavorful enough not to be boring, light enough to have pint after pint."
"O: Hop water with hints of caramel sweetness. Body feels more like water as drinking at room temperature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep red color with a good size white head that leaves sporadic lacing on the glass. Aroma is citrus, pine, and fruits. Taste is malt sweetness followed by citrus, earthy and piny hops and a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel medium to light with easy drinkability."

"Pours a nice deep amber chestnut color with dark golden orange hues. White foamy head that forms a ring within a few minutes. Aroma of bitter pine hops and citrus. Taste is pine and citrus followed closely with a touch of maltiness. Medium bodied and easy drinking."

""
""
"Overall - A fairly good red ale offering from Stone. Reminds me a bit of Red Tail Ale, though not quite as sweet or astringent, and better rounded. The low 4.4% is a bit surprising considering the brewery, known for aggressive, high ABV beers. This is a nice change-up that finds it's way for a strike."

"O - One of my favorite session beers. For the 4.4% ABV, it's very hoppy and delicious."

""
""
"Dark amber color with a tan head and moderate lacing. Big citrus hops in the aroma. Flavor was citrus hops with hints of pink grapefruit. A little malt in the background but a good hop finish. Just a little thin, flatness in the finish. Overall good amber."
""
"This is a great beer with excellent flavors and aromas to entertain the senses without the higher abv associated with similarly flavored beers making it great for sessions."
""
""
"Not bad - pretty tasty with stacks of hops (as expected). Mouthfeel would have benefited from higher carbonation. A good blend of malt and aromatic hops, though the bitterness is perhaps over the top. Decent but not as good as other Stone offerings - try it once."
"Overall the beer is above average but it is not a staple in my beer diet. There are better beers that come from the Stone Brewery, although this one is not bad."
""
""
"Overall: I don't know if i'd get this again... i like a brew with a little more body and flavor. Nonetheless, its pretty awesome given 4.4 ABV. A session beer if ever there was one."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass, best by 5/1/12. This pours a nice reddish brown color with a nice tan head which leaves a nice lacing. The smells are of good and caramel, other malts pretty good. The feel is medium with a mouth coating hop resin. The taste is good, nice mid hop bite with a caramel backbone. I really wish they had these in Texas because this would be my go to session beer."

"overall - 5/5 - I feel it is more than the sum of its parts because it's a session beer that tastes like an IPA but looks like a red."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- After enjoying the Tornado Alley, I wanted to compare to one I haven't had from Stone yet. Not much different! Had quite a bit of hop character and smoother finish than Charleville's brew but would definitely hit others from Stone before this one. Will give it a good over-all rating because it hit most of the categories."
""
""
"I had this on tap at Rattle and Hum. Fairly dark for an amber ale. The head was about 1 finger. I was surprised by two things; the large amount of hops and the low ABV. Also, this beer is very drinkable. Not the best that Stone has to offer but certainly a nice session beer that is not very representative of the style."
""
"Decently tasty brew from Stone, but this one really stands out as being a nice, sessionable, low-ABV beer, while still boasting a ton of flavor. Certainly atypical for the brewery, but that's perhaps part of it's popularity. Extremely quaffable and good enough to warrant throwing back a couple from time to time."
""
""
"O- Starts slow, but gets better near the bottom of the glass. Glad I lucked into this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer was great! Easily one of my top 5 for flavor and drinkability. This is definitely going to be a regular in my arsenal from now on. I love the excellent quality of this beer compared to beers with a comparable ABV. I suggest this to anyone wanting to broaden out to bolder more adventurous beers because it is a tame stroll into the depths of Stone beers which I have found all to be good to date in my experiences."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. The hoppiness was excellent, with fruit and sweetness, to make is nicely inviting. We must have fallen off the trail somewhere between the nose and the mouth. The flavors were flat throughout, and the heavy bitterness made the taste seem detached from what was set up for by the aroma. Additionally, there was a flattish feel to the palate, leaving not only the taste buds board, but the mouth bored as well."

"A 12 ounce bottle of Levitation pours a clear, deep copper color, leaving quick light foam that lingers on the surface, alongside an excellent lacing. It has a hoppy, straw-like scent, and a taste that is punchy but fleeting. It is full of hops offering little to counter, yet it is not obtrusive, nor insistent. A mouthful is fizzy but dissipates quickly. This is pretty much the entry level brew from Stone Brewery, but like most of their other entries, it is an excellent example of style."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a pretty good brew. It's nothing to put on your ""wants"" list or go way out of your way to try and find, but it is certainly deserving of a pint or two. I would serve it to my guests, for what it's worth, but it didn't blow my hair back."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light texture in the mouthfeel. A very solid sessionable brew."
""
"On tap at Stone's Public House in Ashland. Served in a standard pint glass. Light orange colored body. Barely had any head, but with moderate lacing though. Smell had hints of pine and citrus. Taste was refreshingly good. Nice level of hops for an amber. Enough hops to notice, but not overly hopped like some West Coast beers. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a balanced dose of malt to give it some body. I guess the one thing that surprised me was the low abv. Seeing this now as I review it, I would have never guessed Stone made this beer so low. Didn't taste like a session beer. A new beer for me when I am looking for a flavorful yet low abv choice of beer."
""
"Overall, wasn't sure how this would be. Wow was I blown away. Low abv- yes but great flavor both piney hop and rich caramel malts. Stone comes through again! Great brew!"
""
""

"Overall this is worth trying."

"D - Well built, well balanced, and it's the best Stone brew I've had."

""
"12oz bottle poured a dark amber/orange color with a small off white head. The aroma had a light hop nose with a decent amount of caramel. Taste was mild, had some bitterness with some caramel and roast tones alongside a dry finish. Overall this one is good and has a nice amount of flavor and character in it. Definitely would drink again."
""

"Great brew for a lighter beer."
""
""

"Would go as far as calling this one of Stone's most balanced beers, though definitely not as ridiculous or fascinating as others they have released. The fact that it is sessionable makes its consumption all the merrier."
""
""
""
"O: I really dig Stone's Levitation. As a closet session fanatic, this is one of the better session brews on the market. I have and will continue to drink this tasty little Amber, and recommend checking it out for yourself."
""
""
"The most enjoyable red/amber I've had - far hoppier than most. Almost like RIPA - red IPA."
""
"O - Very underwhelming, not worth noting. Not sure I can recommend this one. Nothing sticks out."
""

"Dr: Drinkable and refreshing, if a bit full-bodied. Not sessionable, but certainly worth a go for any beer fanatic. I do wish it weren't so coarse."

"From Family Beer and Liquor; East Dubuque, IL. Nice pour with huge white head; not much going on with the aroma for me. Flavor is somewhat hoppy and balanced very well with the malts. A very easy drinking beer with a low ABV; good introduction to craft beer with this one."

"I think this beer may be one of the best introductory beers out there to introduce non craft drinkers to the world of craft beer. The low(er) alcohol percentage is a rarity for Stone, and I don't feel they skimp on the taste at all, despite it being the alcohol content that the average beer consumer would be used to. It's hoppy, but well balanced. The style is one that the average beer consumer has probably had before, but this is a good, well hopped up version, and still contains all the signifying traits that make up Stone. Great for a session beer. Overall I think this is a beer to bring the average consumer and a craft drinker together and see common ground. I see it as being a big success for that reason."
""
""
"Overall - Behind it's rather intimidating bottle is a welcoming ale. It's different flavor combined with it's smoothness make this a beer that's easy to recommend for pretty much anyone!"

"This is a good example of an amber ale. Opaque dark amber in color, delightful hoppy smell and taste, the mouthfeel is smooth and light. This would be a good beer to accompany a heavy meal. This is a tasty brew and it goes down easy. I'd recommend it for almost any beer drinker."

"I poured this beer into a perfect pint, it has a dark amber color body with a nice brown color head that lays down quickly to a nice lace. The smell is of floral hops with some pine hints. The taste is nice of hops with that give off some pine notes. Has a little sweet taste. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and overall a very drinkable beer."
""
""
"In conclusion, this beer, at 4.4%, would make an excellent session beer. It is easy to drink, but flavorful, and you can finish a six pack without toppling over. Totally respectable, but I wish the price was lower."

"Found this beer to surprisingly be a bit complex. A sharp hop bite that quickly moves to some tasty roasted caramel and bready malts before a quick dose of some citrus hops that really brings it full circle. Gives it a nice bitter finish. Full-bodied and a little thick and fizzy on the palate, this beer makes me think more of a well-balanced Pale Ale rather than an Amber but pretty damn good nonetheless."

"D/O - Drinkability is moderate. I have to say that on-tap, this is one of my favorite hoppier beers that I can regularly get without much trouble, but it seems to lose something out of the bottle. It's still a pretty good beer, and it still have about a week to go until its Best by date (yeah, not the freshest but it's better than it being well past), and I could see this being a great transition into IPAs given the lower ABV and IBU and cleaner feel."
""
"Poured into standard pint, levitation is a deep red, clear ale, with a wispy, modest creamy head lingering on top. Earthy, citrusy hops hang over top of a sweet, slightly roasty malt aroma. A taste reveals much of what the aroma suggests: grapefruit, bitter, biting citrus hops on top of a firm malty base. A very slight roasted malt character is present. Nice medium/full body for a lower gravity beer, with moderate carbonation that compliments it very nicely. This beer is quite drinkable overall, and seems as though it would be a hophead's ""session beer"". It has a lot of the bold characteristics of a big hoppy beer, but keeps it in control with a lower alcohol content. Very nice beer. If you like hops, give it a shot."

"Color is dark amber with a light tan head. Head retention is outstanding, lasting to the final sip, and there's lots of lacing down the glass. Strong citrus hop aromas make this smell like an IPA. From the scent, I'm expecting a very hoppy taste. It is highly hopped relative to the style, but the malt character comes through strongest with bread and caramel flavors. There is a nice surge of piney hops in the finish. The complex flavors all balance together very nicely. Mouthfeel seemed a little thin. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"O: very, very drinkable but not one of my favorite ambers, wont be buying this beer again and would recommend other ambers to people over this one. Most definitely my least favorite stone to date."
"O: In just a few words, this is one hell of a session beer. Put this in 12 packs, drop the price, and make this the go-to Stone beer. Please."
"O- Been wanting to try this for a while, Its the least intense and probably the most drinker friendly of all Stones beer's. Sure to not dissapoint but dont expect anything epic."
"Overall- This is probably the most hopped an amber ale will ever be, and I'm sure Stone has no regrets about that. It's true that scores are not going to be mind blowingly high on this amber, but damn is it a good, easy drinker."
"This is a very balanced and easily drinkable beer. Don't come to it expecting complexity or quirkiness and you will be rewarded. The hop presence is enough to separate it from other amber ales, but not powerful enough to bring it out of the style. I could drink this all day, and at 4.4% it's one of the best session beers I've had. I just wish it wasn't so expensive for a six pack. If they ever make a 12 pack of this, I'm all over it!"
"I pretty much did give two Schlitz for this bottle of Levitation. I don't know if I would do it often."
"Overall this is a solid session ale from Stone. There are definitely Amber Ales out there with more depth and complexity, but you can't beat Levitations drinkability. Reminds me of a weak Surly Furious. Highly recommended for anyone new to Stone or craft beer in general. Cheers!"
"Stone Levitation Ale is a very good amber/red ale. a great balance of malt and hops. The beer got docked a 0.5pt due to floaties....I hate floaties. I even cut the beer off early. The color is a nice rich red with good off-white head that is lacing. The smell includes some spice and bitter citrus. The taste is a great blend of malt with hops that cleans and tingle the pallate. The mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation and good balance. Overall it is decent...could session this one, especially with the lower ABV."
"O: At times this thing tastes like a West Coast IPA! Really impressive beer @ 4.4%. Stone...respect."
"O: Can't ask for much more from an amber on this one. Stone nails it, balanced with just enough hops."
"Overall: I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I consider it a rare, yet appreciated, ""sessionable"" offering from Stone. I enjoyed it with pork chops and stuffing, and the beer complemented the meal extremely well. Not A+ material, but still a good, solid, enjoyable beer!"
"O- A very good beer for such a low alcohol content. Well balanced and tasty."
"Insanely drinkable, quenchable and quaffable. This is an insane session beer, one of the most flavoursome and exciting beers under 5% ABV I think I've ever had. And despite the lightness on the palate, it never feels empty. Great brew."
"Overall: I wanted to like this beer more than I did. It just didn't marry the flavors as well. I enjoy sweetness and bitterness but you get each separately; the sweetness upfront and then the bitterness at the end and it stays with you. Not a bad beer by any means, just not my favorite."
"I am quickly becoming a fan of stone! First of all, I'm not sure how old the bottle was that I bought. If it still has ""The Great American Beer Festival Gold Metal Winner 2007"" on the neck then it's current. This is just one of those beautifully rounded malt and hops, push and pull, yen and yang if you will. I see me going back and buying more to age a little and try more!!"
"Overall I liked this beer and didn't get to try it now since my area is prone to old beer and this one was finally restocked without sediment without a best by date so I am unsure how old the brew is but it was still mighty tasty. Would love to try this fresh, it would improve the review and perspective."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Certainly enjoyable. I finished the pint without a problem, but thought the hops and malt flavors clashed. Though it says something when Stone makes a balanced beer. I just wished it meshed better for me."
"Pours reddish-brown with at least a finger of head that maintains well. The smell is reminiscent of a West Coast pale ale - some citrus and nicely hoppy. The flavor is bold for a beer with such low alcohol. It has a pleasant hop finish as well. This beer is a gem for sessioning with craft brew friends or to pair with everyday meals. It would also be great for a party where most guests were not craft brew enthusiasts."
"D -Overall a very drinkable."
"O: Who the hell knew that low ABV beer could taste this great? I'm astonished. I think I might pick up a 6 pack of this stuff next time I see it."
"O - One of the most flavorful beers I've had with such a low abv. Levitation is an utterly delightful amber ale and a strong contender for my premier ""go-to"" beer. A perfect example that drinkability and low ABV don't require corn in a can. This beer is awesome!"
"Wow this is one light abv beer packed with flavor. This is a living breathing example of a very solid sessionable ""like"" beer."
"Happy to run into a Stone take over at DeCicco’s in Brewster, NY, this brew shows a dark mahogany color, semi-translucent with a decent tannish froth on top and good lacing. The aroma is a nice citrus brightness with earthy pine and subtle flowery sweetness. The taste is very bitter, raw grass and subtle pine with lots of biscuit and some caramel malt. It’s peppery with crisp carbonation and a fairly aggressive effervescent feel. But it is a little thinner than I expected. Medium light bodied at best. Medium drinkability. Decent but a bit harsh for the style."
"All and all excellent beer!"
"Deep reddish gold / garnet in color. It's clear and has a white head that dissipated slowly leaving lacing on the glass. It looks stunning (OK, I just happen to love this color)! Aroma of grapefruit hops and caramel malt. Flavor similar to aroma. While it leans toward the hoppy side, it has a nice caramel backbone. It's light bodied, has a smooth mouth feel, and is very drinkable. For a 4.4% ABV brew, the aptly named Levitation packs in a lot of flavor and makes for a very sessionable beer."
"Overall, a good tasting amber that is low enough to session with the BMC drinking buddies, if only it was readily available it would be my go to beer for sure."
"Overall:. Excellent brew, another great one from Stone."
"Another really good drinking brew from Stone, much like their Pale Ale and IPA, this brew falls into the same basic catagory. The beer poured out as a nice looking amber color with a decent white colored head on it with a good lacing also. The smell of the beer is malty, much more malty than most stone brew that I'm aware of. The taste of the brew does have a good hoppiness to it along with some nice caramel flavors too. The mouthfeel is drinkable and overall I think this brew is pretty damn good."
"O - A pretty good amber ale, but I think it is a little too hopped for the style."
"Medium body and carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. Exceptionally drinkable, nice flavor, a solid west coast take on the amber ale."
"I think next time I would not get the six pack, maybe a bomber."
"O: Overall, pretty good. I feel that it may be a little 'watery' in terms of mouthfeel, but quite good other than that. The taste is a little light, but it's still pretty good."
"O - Didn't really think the taste lived up to the smells. I think I owe it to myself to try it again and reevaluate"
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Head stuck around for a while. Color is that classic amber I'd expect. Clear, I'd assume filtered. Smells strongly of hops and an earthy malty aroma. Taste is really good for the style and ABV. I'm not a huge fan of ambers but at 4.4% and a good dose of hops, this is going to be a new standard. Hops aren't as strong in the taste as the smell, and the mouthfeel is a little thin, but that's expected. Overall, I really like this beer and will be bringing it to family get-togethers and trying to convert everyone."
"Great color, great flavor, aggressive but not overwhelming bite, very good lacing."
"Glassware: FRESH growler into snifter"
"Overall: On the watery side of red ales which I am not a fan off."
"Despite the intensity, this is a supremely drinkable beer. It reminds me of an Extra Pale Ale since the hops are more aggressive than most amber or red ales I have tasted. Pretty amazing stuff here."
"O: Looks really nice and smells good. A little too hoppy for my tastes. I would have liked more malt structure."
"A well constructed and well balanced beer. Tasty, drinkable, and enjoyable."
"D: I guess the drinkability is pretty good but not my favourite Stone brew."
"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark amber body, multiple streams of carbonation rising up side of glass. Big hop aroma especially for the style, piney goodness, balanced by caramel malt sweetness. Taste is pretty sweet up front, leading to a quite bitter finish for the style. Mouthfeel is medium, good effervescence, and fairly dry finish. I used this as a palate awakener and while the patrons who don't enjoy fairly hoppy beers were in flux there were a number of return tasters. A fairly unique Amber, one of the hoppier examples of the style ala Troegs. At this ABV extremely drinkable. Worth a try, especially for those looking for a hoppy session beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, some notes of citrus. Taste is very hoppy, considerable bitterness, I am not tasting any of the citrus in the smell, or anything else for that matter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."
"O: Decent. Second time I have tried this. I don't believe there will be a third. Simply not my favorite from Stone."
"O: Although this beer isn't that remarkable, it's easy to follow the first glass with several others. I appreciate the low abv, and this is one of the better readily available beers out there at less than 5%."
"Nice deep color. At first it smells a bit overpoweringly of hops, but that fades. It certainly doesn't taste too hoppy. It has a very bold flavor that fades slowly in the mouth and lingers for a good while. A tiny hint of carmelization is there, but only a little. I would recommend as a good solid no-frills beverage."
"M- Very...average. Nothing exceptional, but nothing to write home about. Good carbonation and body."
"Picked us a six pack of this on my anniversary weekend in Phoenix. I was surprised to find out that it was a red ale, because drinking it from the bottle in the hotel room it had more of the taste characteristics of a pale ale. Oh well, hop head will rejoice in the red ale. An all around very good beer that packs alot of flavor and mouthfeel into a beer with a modest alcohol content. A bit pricey for what it is, but certainly one of the better red ales i've had."
"Overall, a decent take on a Red/Amber. What makes me enjoy it is the fact that it's 4.4% ABV but still relatively flavorful. Definitely a good beer for someone looking for a bit of a hop fix on a hot summer day."
"Levitation ale is a very enjoyable beer that is a bit confusing to me, but tasty none the less. I can’t really see myself picking this up instead of an IPA or pale ale, but perhaps if I was in the mood for something different I would. One thing is for certain, this is the hoppiest amber I have ever tasted."
"It poured a hazy medium brown that supported a large light brown rocky head that was bellowing above the top of the glass. It dissipated at a rapid pace leaving just a little residue behind, although it was enough for some really excellent lacing. The aroma was unusually complex with a mild scent of toasted malts, a nice dose of piney hops and an earthy yeast with hints of sweet fruit, honey and a nice citrus note. The taste had kind of a sweet-acidic flavor with a slight fruity note from the onset. Then it slowly but firmly became extremely bitter with a nice strong hop presence and a touch of citrus at the end. Mouthfeel was somewhere between light and medium in body and nice and dry in texture with a subtle soft carbonation. Overall a unique tasting brew that was very enjoyable. A must try for a Hop Head."
"Overall this beer really keeps you guessing. For what simple ingredients they brag about on the bottle (“nothing but barley, hops, water, and yeast”) this is very complex."
"O - No Doubt to why this is an award winning beer. Would definitly buy again but I can no longer get Stone in Wisconsin."
"Honestly, everything about this, from the aroma, to the taste, to the mouth feel, screams big beer. It’s truly amazing that Stone packed this much flavor into this type of package. Most of the time session beers can come across as bland, watery, and without much in the way of flavor. With Levitation, Stone has turned that assumption on its ear, creating a full-flavored Pale Ale / IPA / Red Ale beer that doesn’t have that huge ABV punch. Over the years the boys in Escondido have produced a number of extraordinary beers that I’ve enjoyed, but quite honestly Levitation may be the best of the bunch."
"I love stone, and I love this beer."
"This won't be my last six pack of Levitation. Thanks to Stone for continuing in this excellence."
"O: One of the more powerful Red Ales I've had."
"My favorite amber so far. It's got plenty of hops, plenty of flavor, and is light enough to drink all day long. This beer accomplishes all it seeks out to accomplish."
"The beer pours out a cloudy woody brown color with a nice off-white head on top. The smell of this beer is light at first, but as the beer warms a little you get light citrus and grapefruit tones from the dry hopping. Thanks to the dry hopping, the hops are forward on the drink but quickly allow the malts to take center stage. The beer finishes clear and dry with a resurgence of the hops on the swallow. To me, this is a San Diego-West Coast take on an American amber ale. There's a lot more of a hop profile, which can be refreshing for hop heads looking for a break from the IPA norm at the bar. This is also a great starter beer."
"Good offering. Sessionable and refreshing for a hoppy beer."
"O - Very tasty for a low abv beer (4.4%). Therefore, very high drinkability. Well done Stone!"
"Overall this is an awesome low abv beer but it's pricey for a sixer.. more than a stone IPA sixer.. so yeah.. doesn't quite compute really"
"Overall, there is no doubt why this is an award winning beer. There is a depth of taste here that I am not qualified to describe. And because this is an ale, make this a session beer and enjoy!"
"I always really enjoy this beer and it is great for a hot day coming in at 4.4% ABV."
"O: I was surprised how hoppy this was for this style – but I am not complaining. It was well balanced and refreshing."
"overall a great beer i am keeping this one in the fridge when i can for sure"
"O - Very good session beer. Reminds me of an incredibly hoppy lager."
"I've noticed that this is my 500th review. Huzzah! Unfortunately this beer has no particular significance, it's just an enjoyable drink, not such a bad way to round off to 500. Just a little too dry for my liking and could be a little hoppier in aroma, but otherwise there is little to complain about - it's a damn tasty amber ale."
"O: Very drinkable and sessionable. Nice flavor(especially for the low ABV). I'd gladly drink again and share with friends."
"Overall a really nice session beer for a hot day when you want something a little darker."
"A very nice, refreshing, low abv beer. It doesn't sacrifice taste because of the lower alcohol content."
"Overall it's an outstanding session beer and that didn't change any when I had it live and in person at the brewery."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Cloudy amber in color - simialr to apple cider. Light citrus aroma with a hint of biscuit. Very smooth and a bit creamy, but a little on the thinner side. Citrus and light pine hop aromas with a light malty caramel and bready undertone throughout. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness, but not unpleasantly bitter. Light and easy to drink. Less malty than other red ales I've had."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"Packs a nice amount of flavor for a low abv beer, delicate hops and lightly malted lead to a very refreshing beer with everything you expect in a nice hybrid between amber and pale."
"I really enjoyed this offering and would def recommend trying it!"
"Overall- An excellent beer, with loads of flavor, especially considering the low ABV. Essentially Arrogant Bastards little brother."
"O: Not bad. It is easy drinking and flavorful."
"overall a nice beer but nothing overly exciting would definitely have it again..."
"Overall, this is a nice offering from Stone.  It's very well balanced, smooth, and totally sessionable."
"This beer pours a clear ruby color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine resin, and caramel. The taste is slightly maltier than the aroma with some nice caramel, and toffee notes. There is still plenty of grapefruit and pine too. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is one enjoyable beer. I'm not the biggest fan of Stone, but I can see myself drinking this beer again."
"Pours a murky dark brown, creek water color with fair amount of visible sediment (reading others reviews and wondering if im drinking the same beer; ""clear amber red"" huh? anyways) comes topped with a big fluffy head that left a big slimey lace. Righteous stinky hops on the nose with a big caramel malt backing. Smells much like an APA or an IPA. Bitter on the tongue, watery, slight caramel, ends with a lemon zest that stays around for a while. Light, watery smooth in the mouth. Eh, this is ok, if only the taste lived up to the smell it would be awesome."
"Pours a pretty golden brown in my tasting snifter. Little bit of head, little bit of lacing, but not a lot. Smell is great. Good piney floral hops but not a really strong nose. Taste is exceptional. Really great flavor for such a light and highly drinkable beer. I want this to warm a bit so I can get more subtle flavors, but it goes down so good!! Very thirst quenching an drinkable. Nice hot weather choice. I could drink a 6 right now."
"Overall: Stone's beers are really hit or miss for me, and this falls closer to the latter category. I totally get (and really appreciate) the whole 'low abv, tons of flavor' thing. This just doesn't really quite work for me; I was expecting something closer to a really hopped-up American-style Bitter or something of that ilk...I'd like this more w/a bit more caramel/toast, and a bit less bitterness. The hop flavor/aroma is great, but the bitterness needs to be balanced out a bit better IMO. Not something I'd pay $10.00 a sixer for."
"D: Quite high, low ABV, and tasty to boot."
"Overall: Get it. Now. Great beer, sessionable, full of flavor, and you can drink several without going overboard. If this wasn't so darn expensive and more readily available, I would drink this regularly."
"Pours dark amber with two fingers of off-white foam. Decent head retention and beautiful lacing. Big piney aroma and a good dose of caramel maltiness. Taste is similar but more muted than the smell, with a moderately bitter finish. Good carbonation and body. Overall, this is a tasty beer whose drinkability is only hurt slightly by the bitterness."
"Overall, an easy drinking and great tasting beer."
"O: really enjoyable on a hot day mowing the lawn."
"A well balanced brew that is built pretty well. It went down easy and left me wanting another. A great session beer for those long summer days with family and friends"
"D - Very drinkable, they packed a lot of flavor into a brew with a relatively low abv (especially for Stone). Glad I got a sixer of this, it definitely garners a recommendation from me for a nice easy to enjoy beer."
"Great beer, highly recommended."
"O - Overall an easy drinker. Not as much depth of flavour as I would have hoped and kind of grain flavoured. A decent session but nothing I'd plan a day around."
"VI) Concluding thoughts: Stone, yet again, has really impressed me. I would and will return to this beer. Overall very well balanced and full of great flavor."
"The alcohol also made me feel that this was more of a soda than an alcoholic beverage. Session beers don't get any more easygoing than this in the booze department and although it would seem obvious that a few of these could be consumed in one session, I would only have one of these at a time. Something was missing here and it seemed like this tried to cover a lot of bases at once. While this wasn't a bad choice, I almost feel that it's not in the right category. It's worth a try only because I haven't had anything like this and probably never will again. Like anything the levitates, this defied conventional wisdom and expectations."
"O - A very good amber/red ale. My only knock on this beer is the light body. Would seek out again, if only to see if they characteristics change on tap as opposed to bottle."
"D: Fantastic, as great a session beer as I've found, but I think there are better out there."
"Unique amber ale both in flavor and composition. Nice ""sessionable"" ale which may be an acquired taste with its dryness and non-sweet character."
"A great session brew, amped up flavor. Good drinking for sure."
"Drinkability: A very hoppy Red ale. One is plenty for me. I need more malt to balance out all that hoppiness. It also needs less carbonation and a little more body. I probably wouldn't seek this one out again, but it's not horrible either."
"Overall / Drinkability: A very hop-forward ale. One is enough for me with this one - I need more malts to balance out all that hop flavor. Not bad, just a bit unbalanced in my opinion - great if you're a hophead though."
"Pours a brown color with a visible carbonation near the edges of my glass, the dark color does not permit me to look all the way through. When held up to light it shines a beautiful redish hue. Head is a nice tan hue and about one finger tall, retention is pretty decent and it slowly dissipates to a splotchy foam atop my beer. Smell is of caramel malt, also I smell some grassy hops. Taste is thinner than I expected considering the color and fullness of the smell. The beer hits the tongue with a taste of light malts, then it fades into some hops. Aftertaste is slightly piney and bitter. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, it seems a little bit watery, but I have to remind myself this is a session beer, not a double IPA. Overall, this would be a great sessionable beer for those who enjoy slightly darker beers. Drinking this on a warm fall day sounds just right."
"It was alright. On the take home scale, I'd leave it on the shelf."
"O: A very sessionable beer for hopheads. Very surprised how much flavor can come out of a 4.4% ABV beer."
"Very delicious, and surprisingly session-worthy."
"overall a great beer and one that i would buy regularly. if you are looking for a great session beer this is it, very little alcohol and a great smell and taste."
"Overall I think it is a very good ale and can make for a perfect sessions beer. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: Initially I doubted Stone's ability to brew a sessionable beer that would live up to the standard of their other big brews. Plainly put, this was stupid. For those who are sticklers for drinkable, sessionable beers, this is one area where Stone delivers. One of my new favorite ambers, no question."
"Overall, I can't say I'll ever buy this brew again."
"O - Very tasty beer. Definitely will drink again, but will search out a known fresh source. Recommended red."
"Overall one of the most flavorful American Ambers that I have had in a while. Truly qualifies as a good/drinkable/flavorful session beer at 4.4%."
"Always looking for a great session beer and this one fits the bill for me. Great bitter citrus aromas with just enough malt balance on the taste to keep the acidity in check. Great piney hop character with a nice citrusy finish. My only complaint on this one is the price, for $11.99 a six I would prefer Stone keep the etched bottles and give me a 4% abv beer at a more reasonable price."
"Great Light Ale, easily one of the best sub 5% beers out there. I especially like the English Malt quality of this beer."
"O - I really enjoyed this one. Great strong taste of hops; long finish; and entirely pleasant to consume."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a low carbonation level. There is also an unwelcoming film left in your mouth after each sip. Overall, this is another respectable brew from Stone. I really didn't find anything overly impressive here, but it is definitely a sessionable brew."
"O: I had never had this beer, but friends raved about it. I finally had the chance and was not disappointed. The low ABV scared me off for some time, but I went to a bar where this was the only decent beer on the menu so I was forced into it. Glad that happened."
"This is a perfectly find and well crafted beer. I understand the idea behind the brew, I just don't find the flavor all that great."
"An amber for hop heads."
"O: Overall, a quality brew. 4's all across the board for this one. I appreciate what Stone did with this one. I can get my hop fix without being knocked on my ass and having no tastebuds left after three or four. Very approachable ABV. I will drink plenty of this over the coming summer months. Worth seeking out."
"O – This is a nice solid brew and typical of Stone. I have found people love or hate Stone. Its very drinkable. Enjoy."
"D - Great big flavor for a low ABV beer. This could make a nice session beer by virtue of the ABV, but may be to strong in flavor for some. I will definitely drink this again."
"Overall: This is a little more hoppy than I'd like an amber/red ale to be. That being said, it is a very good beer. This tastes a whole lot like an IPA to me, although I'm used to drinking Abita Jockamo IPA, which I'm told isn't entirely representative of the style. This isn't my personal favorite, but I can definitely respect what Stone has done with this brew. It's definitely worth a try, and I will most likely buy this again."
"O: Honest, simple, impressive beer. I can definitely see this becoming one of my go-to’s. Powerful, smooth, and definitely worthy of that Gold Medal."
"This was a decent amber, not really among the best, but overall an easy to drink beer."
"Very good American Amber. I will definitely be searching for this one again."
"Gotta love beers that pull off being this light without sacrificing flavor, I'd be happy with sessioning this one."
"Stone Levitation Ale pours a big stiff head over a clear burnt orange brew. Carbonation is spritzy, and the nose is bright, spicy, resinous, marmelade hops. The hop-forward theme carries through to the flavor- hoppy hoppy hoppy and a little oily, almost, up front, with barley hulls and nutty notes off the back. Mouthfeel is light, with a long grassy hop aftertaste. Very much a session ale for hopheads- low in alcohol (4.4%ABV) but lots of flavor, though with those oily notes I prefer the nose, personally..."
"As a Red Ale I would take several before this...but I am not sure I've had a better lower ABV red ale....A 12 pack of this would work nicely at a summer BBQ when in the mood for some hops."
"I rarely stray from the ipa arena....but tried Levitation on my son's recommendation I was pleasantly surprised. Levitation is a mildly hoppy and smooth drinking ale. I'm impressed. Levitation would make a good session beer with it's low abv. Stone Brewing is yet to let me down."
"Finish: Bitter citric with a bit of stickiness on the lips"
"overall - i am very impressed with this and i think i might have found my new go to session beer and beer to give to craft beer newbies to try"
"Easy drinking, and low alcohol will make this a good session beer for me."
"This is really tasty, light brown-slightly amber, nice head, a little lacing, there is a sour hop smell that comes through slightly in the taste...but pleasant. I really love the smooth graininess that this beer has. It has a distinct malt taste but it isn't overly toasty or sweet. The light body would make having a few very easy."
"Easy drinking and low in alcohol, truly sessionable!"
"O- Very hop forward for a lower ABV beer, but I kind of expected that from Stone. Overall this a great session beer for hopheads."
"Stone Levitation Ale has a red colour and a crappy 1 mm head that fades quickly. The smell is hoppy with some sweet, woodiness. The taste is malty with some bitter hoppy woodiness. It has a nice frothy mouthfeel. Overall, I liked this red ale. Tasty, woody, hoppy."
"O - This beer shows potential, but needs tweaks in the flavor dept. With a more dynamic or intense flavor profile, this would be a big winner."
"O- Impressive to start, but falls short in the end. Had hoped it would be sessionable, but the dryness and sharp finish detract from the drinkability."
"Finally got to try Levitation from Stone. I'd avoided it before on trips out west because I'm not a big fan of ""ambers", but I was pleasantly surprised. Nice hoppy flavor without going into the metallic taste which has steered me away from ambers/reds in the past. Good stuff."
"Overall: A solid version of a red."
"D=This one is pretty good for sipping on for awhile."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Deep mohogony pour with little, quickly fading tan head. Excellent lacing. Aroma is nutty, with a good barley smell. Mouthfeel is of a medium body, a good dry feel, but the high carbonation seems to steal from the taste which is fairly hoppy, dry, but slightly yeasty- bread like. Overall, it is an ok beer, but not at all close to some of Stone's best."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. The earthy hops are a little over the top and I would like a bit more of the malt presence. Has to be one of the absolute hoppiest amber beers out there."
"O= This is a really nice low ABV beer that I could drink a ton off. Really flavorful and sort of ""fun"" to drink as strange as it sounds. It's not something you ponder forever and think about it's just a nice beer that has a ton of flavor. Excellent beer."
"O- so much flavor for 4.4 ABV..its a very good amber i thoroughly enjoyed this one"
"TREAT YOURSELF, NOW!!"
"Notes: Levitation, for as low in ABV as it is, actually posesses some body. It has a creamy mouthfeel and fine carbonation, wich makes it a very sessionable brew. Solid by all means, and might be a go-to brew for long weekends. This is the ideal session brew. Full of character and body, this is one that I will be re-visiting time and time again."
"Light body that feels a little heavier with the creaminess of the soft, full carbonation."
"O: major props to Stone on this one.. a low abv brew that doesn't sacrifice flavor! A true session beer!"
"Medium bodied, with just a hair below medium carbonation. The low abv makes this an easy beer to drink. There is a lot of flavor for a beer with this low of an abv. Another nicely made beer from Stone, which I would gladly buy again."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and one could certainly drink quite a few given the lower ABV."
"EDIT: oh yea, also drinking it with a snack of swiss cheese and wheat crackers...certainly a great night snack"
"O: Dryness is a useful plus, hollowness is a detriment. I think perhaps freshness is a bit of an issue here, so it gets the benefit of the doubt."
"Overall: Good solid beer but a little to one sided for me."
"D: Off the charts. This is the best session craft beer in history! Day in and day out, this is my goto beer. I absolutely love it, especially if I am just chillin' and not feeling adventurous or in the mood for a fancier, less drinkable brew."
"Overall I really enjoyed this single 12 oz. bottle. Thanks to Jeff from my favorite bottle shop for the sample. I have overlooked this beer for years because of the price for the alcohol. Maybe I should tuck my alcoholism in my pocket next time and buy this great drinking baby of a beer."
"Never age. Drink now."
"Overall: Very good beer that I would drink again. It has a nice complexity and is easy to drink. It was a little pricey but I would definitely drink again."
"Notes: Almost like a watered down Bastard but in a nice way. i.e. making a good session brew out of it. Not one that I will look out for particularly, but would not mind grabbing and is a good choice for an informal social gathering."
"M/D) Medium body, slightly carbonated but relatively smooth mouthfeel. A bit of a lingering bitterness. Very easy drinking beer. A nice, crisp, hoppy session beer from Stone."
"M - Light. Touch watery. Pleasant carbonation."
"Wait, why is my glass empty?"
"Drinkability is ok. The abv isnt high so I could drink a bunch of these. However, this beer isnt really all that complex to make me want to come back and keep drinking it. Im not loving the watery finish either. Within the style, this is a pretty good representation."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This Stone beer is done really well. Great flavor well balanced and very easy to drink. This is why I am a loyal Stone follower, no real let downs in their brews."
"This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"This has poured usually very, very bubbly, overly carbonated, hard to control head. Once it dies down a bit it's a nice looking beer, deep copper, blood reddish, a big frothy white head that leaves really sticky lacing. On the nose, I'm getting a big hit of piney hops, surprising given the style and ABV, and beneath that are caramel, bready malts, and some yeasty note. In the mouth, the bready and nutty note is foremost, but as that fades a nice, big pine bitterness hangs around for a long while. This beer is proof that low ABV does not mean low flavor, and I wish that there were more such beers on the market."
"d-very drinkable and enjoyable. Nice session beer"
"Overall - Aside from a unique appearance and pleasant smell, this doesn't bring any unique or exceptional tastes to the table. I can find 10 other American craftbeers in my liquor store that are close twins to this brew and probably $1-2 less a 6-pack as well."
"D - Overall a worthy offering, and definitely worth a try. The flavours are quite unique and provide for a memorable amber ale."
"T: Malt and caramel with a ton of hops that are a little unbalanced. This beer ends up being bitter and not in a good way. The worst part for me was definitely the mouthfeel, which was waaaay too thin."
"Drinkability. Great drinker. I could drink a bunch of these ...and will do the first chance I get!"
"Overall: A beer I rarely drink, but it has a lot of flavor for the low ABV and is pretty tasty. There are simply too many other options."
"D- One of the most drinkable beers I have had from Stone."
"M - light and refreshing but herbal and astringent makes for an interesting brew, very drinkable"
"Bottle. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a pretty dark, but still clear, copper orange color with a large antique white head that is rather slow to settle but as it does leaves some lace on the glass. The is made up of rather tiny little bubbles and makes me be patient to take my first sip. Nice hoppy citris/pine aroma in the nose but not overpowering. Some biscuit like notes as well. Medium mouthfeel. The taste is rather nice, slightly bready sweet beginning gives wasy to hoppy and floral notes that linger on. Very refreshing."
"Yum!"
"Easy to drink, a bit timid in terms of mouthful and the aftertaste was almost non-existent"
"D: Pretty high. Nice taste and low ABV make this go down pretty easy."
"Light and carmelly and very tasty. Pours brown with a big fluffy head. The aroma is negligible, but the taste is strong - carmel and toffee and a wonderful candylike malt. There is a strong yet hard to identify hop bitterness - a little floral, a bit earthy. It is sweet and clean and strong without letting on how low the ABV really is. The moithfeel is thin, but hidden by the high bitterness. A lovely bit of brewing trickery - a lawnmower beer for the hophead."
"Levitation does what it sets out to do - a true session beer with big flavor and a perfectly appropriate title. I love starting out with this before a game or a party, or anytime I'm not feeling like sinking into my chair."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Aroma of hops, grapefruit, pine, and a little bit of pale malt. Poured copper/deep orange in color with a small, tan head that lasted throughout. Clear. Slightly sparkling. Good lacing. Flavor is light to medium bitter and lightly sweet. Tastes of hops, pine, grapefruit, and pale malts. Medium body. Average texture. Average carbonation. Light to medium bitter, grapefruit, pine, and hop finish. It's lacking something. Disappointed of this beer out of all the Stone offerings."
"I need to get a six pack of this."
"Mouthfeel is ok, as carbonation is at or above average, and tingles are nice throughout. Drinkability is very good, and at 4.4% you won't get many beers with a better flavor:abv ratio to session."
"The mouthfeel is crisp, with a medium body and a medium level of carbonation. And the drinkability is superb, this is quite drinkable. A bit more ABV would be expected for the amount of flavor this has, but I'm sure it has it's place. Looking for something high on flavor, but low on ABV? This is your brew right here."
"D: It's a very drinkable beer. Low ABV and a pretty good taste."
"T: Clean, crisp, and lightly hopped (for a Stone beer). Not very complex, but clean enough to be refreshing."
"""How 'bout the power of flight? That do anything for ya? That's levitation, homes."" It pours a clear sunrise russet topped by a finger of staunch light cream foam. The nose comprises pine, oregano, grapefruit peel, light toffee, and red pepper. The taste holds notes of pine, grapefruit, light caramel, honeydew, and a small pinch of pepper. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly drying finish. Overall, a very nice hoppy red, one that pleasantly runs the gamut from spicy to piny in terms of the hops involved. Good times. Now they need to make a new one called Telekinesis (something about mind bullet killing a yak from long distances is floating around in my head for some reason)..."
"D- Fairly high. I'm going to try and get some price quotes on cases.. at $13 a 6er it's a bit much but it's very tasty. One I'll be revisiting. Worth seeking out."
"I will be rating this beer probably higher than the average BA. Poured from the bottle a dull amber to dark orange color with a thick rocky head that receded slowly and left nice laicing on the glass. Smell is wonderful for a red ale pine and grassy hops mixed with tropical fruit notes. Taste is so complex for such a simple low abv beer. Hops up front fresh cut grass and sour apple with a malty middle that has a dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is light and dry not too heavy like some red ales are, good carbonation that brings out the hop. Drinkability is fantastic and for a low abv this is a great session beer for hop lovers!"
"D It would be easy to drink several with the sweet taste and lighter mouthfeel."
"Drinkability-Great ale, wish it was a little stronger but I loved it."
"D: Easy drinking beer with a lower abv. A good beer to get non-craft drinkers into."
"Excellent Amber Ale although very hoppy for the style."
"D - I really liked this brew. Stone Brewing really shows us they can make a low ABV beer with full flavor. I think it's very very drinkable and goes with so many dishes that you can have a couple or more with just about any meal. I definitely say give it a try, and I'm pretty sure I'll be back for more of the Levitation Ale, very tasty. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is fine but not as great as i expected for an Amber at 4.4 ABV. Picked this up for 8$ at Total Wine in Rancho c CA, worth it, i'd say. A dollar more and i'd be on the fence."
"Off tap this beer was a beautiful mahogany color with lots of rising carbonation. The two fingers of khaki colored head retained itself well and left lacing like lace-topped- fishnet stockings. The aroma was nicely balanced, a combination of pale and biscuity malt with just a hint of caramel coupled with piney and grassy hops. The flavors were refreshing and balanced as well. Toasted malt and some caramel malt held their own against the hops profile that sported elements of grapefruit, light pine and some grass. Hints of butter also appeared as it warmed up. Very tame compared to most stone beers and quite accessible. The mouthfeel was smooth, the carbonation appropriate and the body medium. Very drinkable for a Stone beer but not as impressive as their usual offerings."
"Overall: Just tried this brew for the first time. I am actually quite impressed at how well balanced it is. Looks like I found a new regular, granted I can find it again."
"Poured on tap at the Stone Brewery into a pint glass, the beer is a light cloudy brown color with no head. The beer has a nutty-malt nose; very aromatic. First sip gives a malty-hop punch in the face of flavor, which is unexpected, but very welcome. There are nutty undertones to the flavor, as well. The beer's flavors are very well balanced. The beer is smooth and crisp in mouth, and there is a hops aftertaste to the finish. Very drinkable beer."
"D: Real good. Sluggin it back. Nice drink."
"D: I would consider this an ideal session beer, great tasting compared to BMC and other alternative session beers"
"D - Easy drinking, nice low ABV beer. It would be easy to put several of these away. I wish it was more affordable on this side of the country and I'd pick this up more often. I'd drink this again for sure."
"D: This is a sessionable brew in my opinion and that's a refreshing twist from Stone. This is a beer you could drink several of with some buddies without getting completely blitzed. I'll be getting some more of these."
"D: Rather drinkable, but I wish this had more body to back up the taste."
"Buteer earthy, piny hops up front that linger throughout without much balance into a tongue assaulting dry finish. The malt presence is minimal as best and their is an odd spicy character that makes this beer pretty bad in my opinion. One dimensional with a bone dry finish. I usually like everything Stone makes but this was a wreck."
"D - Sessionable. Pleasant but not remarkable."
"I love hops and personally belive this is classified properly as an Ameican amber rather than an American pale ale. Although not my own first choice, it would be an excellent beer to introduce someone to the possibility of hop flavours without blowing their socks off. It's well balanced and mild - and very drinkable."
"Pours a dark amber color, with a solid 2 inches of fluffy white head on top leaving lots of lacing. A nice amount of pine and citrus hop aromas, mixed with some sweeter malts. I was really surprised the first time I tried this beer, how hoppy it tastes. Such a great hop character given the low ABV. It does have a well balanced finish to it though. Medium bodied, nice amount of carbonation, and extremely drinkable - this is the first thing I reach for if I plan on a long session."
"I think this is a great beer, especially as a session ale. At only 4.4 you can knock a few of these back without sacrificing and skimping on flavor. I dig."
"D - Drinks just fine for an ale, very balanced and can be had with pizza just fine, I had 2 of these at Sammys pizza."
"D - I could drink this beer all night, its a lighter red ale, it looks great and tastes great"
"Was at Whole Foods in Portland, saw this was on tap, so just had a quick half pint of this. Pours a bright amber colour with off-white head. Nice smell of sweet caramel/toffee malt with a pronounced hop aroma. Both sweet and some bitterness. A very nice hoppy amber ale. I've had this several time, won't ever pass up a pint of this."
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, smooth across the pallet, lingering spice on the back of the tongue, nice taste makes it easy to drink but its complexity also makes it a little harder to drink"
"D: Majestic. Expensive for a six of 4.4%abv, nonetheless it is worth every penny"
"Overall- Definition of a high-quality session brew with just enough hop bite to make you remember it for the next round."
"D: a real nice american amber ale. Definitely on the hoppier end. I agree that this is essentially ""the little bastard," when comparing this beer to Stone's more well known strong ale. I really liked this beer. Definitely one I would grab when looking for a more hoppy amber ale."
"D-At 4.4% this is one of the best session beers out there"
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down easy, and it is very refreshing. It reminded me more of an IPA than a red, but either way it's a good beer. I recommend trying it if you haven't yet."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a thick white head and a really large amount of lacing. Smells of citrus hops, passion fruit, and pine. Tastes like bitter hops, passion fruit, pineapple, pine that makes it really tasty and it finishes really dry. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation to back it up. Drinkability is high."
"I have yet to be disappointed with Stone brews. Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorites, and this is pretty much a similar, sessionable version. Definitely recommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, probably a bit too much. It drinks pretty smoothly with good carbonation. This is a tasty and drinkable beer overall, very sessionable."
"Brown pour with a slight ruby highlight and a 1-finger, loose, tan head. Nutty, toasty, earthy caramel malt aroma with a good balance of spicy pine and citrus hops. Floral and spicy hop notes punctuate the flavor with hints of orange zest, almond, and a robust caramel malt background. There's a touch of dry, toasted, biscuit that lingers afterwords too. Medium body with a nice amount of carbonation that gives it a crisp finish. This is a nicely crafted session beer."
"Poured a deep, rich amber color, with an impressive cap of off white foam. Big hoppy aromas (resiny pine, citrus, grassy) with a little sweetness as well. Light bodied and easy to drink, with good hoppy flavors (citrus, floral) up front and a light caramel backbone. A big flavorful beer, considering its meager alcohol content; a six pack is perfect for any occasion."
"D: Really great thanks to the low ABV."
"Upon hearing Stone's is pulling out of Wisconsin, I had to try this one which I had never seen before. It pours a medium dark amber color as a semi-strong scent of hops tickle your nose. The hops continue well into its taste as well. Not quite to the strength of an IPA but still very evident. It does finish rather smooth though. If you are trying, don't expect the typical amber or ale flavor here."
"D: Best described as Arrogant Bastard's little brother. If you like that, you'll probably like this."
"Drink - Another above average beer from Stone - worth seeking out."
"Drink ability is okay. I can't see myself wanting more than two of these. The aftertaste is what ruins it. It tastes like I swallowed a bitter pill. While drinking it, it tastes good but the lingering taste deters me away."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a creamy tan long lasting head. Aroma of citrusy piney hops, sweet caramel malt with some slight fruitiness. Taste is citrusy hops, sweet malt, some light fruity spices. A nice med body palate, very nice carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, some sweet spices, ending with some grapefruit, citrusy hops. Overall a smooth and very nicely balanced and flavorfull amber ale. Very enjoyable, nicely done."
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, a little lighter than I expected. Pretty well balanced, but like I mentioned, lighter than I expected, for both the style and the brewery. It has a clean bitter finish and even though the head was so huge, the carbonation level is good. Drinkability is good. It would work well if you wanted to sip it or have it as a nice refreshment on a hot summer day. Not as big and bold as most Stone brews, but a very good beer none the less."
"This beer pours a dark, yet slightly opaque, brown. The head is a fluffy white with very nice retention and leaves a beautiful lacing. Hops and a 'beady' smell are present in the nose. The hops in the aroma don't manifest themselves in the flavor, but there are some hints of a nuttiness. The finish is almost nonexistent. This would make a great cold weather session beer because it's dark and flavorful but still light and has a pretty low ABV."
"D - I am really digging this. Too bad I do not have more of these because this would make a great session beer at 4.4%."
"This is a good beer any time during the year, but probably even better during the warmer months. With the citrusy, crisp taste and low alcohol, you can really have at this."
"This beer pours a bubbly, clear, auburn color with thick, tan foam. The aroma is mainly pine with a hint of fruit followed by a very bitter, acidic flavor. It has a very thin almost watery mouthfeel. Stone Levitation Ale is not an easy beer to drink. NOT recommended!"
"Drink- I had to drive home but would have loved to stick around for a few more pints of this nice little beer."
"Update 9/29/11 - This is more impressive today than a year ago when I first had it. The flavor is more complex with each bottle. This is beer number two to earn a permanent placement in my refrigerator."
"Overall a very easy drinking tasty beer. Definitely doesn't blow you away by any stretch of the imagination but that doesn't mean it's a bad beer or not what the brewer intended. Wouldn't recommend for a tasting but would certainly pick up a six for a get-together."
"if i can find it one of my sessions. this is a nice blend of malt and hop. a bit citrus bitter and malty toastiness that is backed by a good feel. nose is pine and malt. the beer is quite simple but has a nice malt back that is a bit more defined than a APA. a tad grassy bitter with a nougat sweet malt."
"As far as an amber ale goes, this certainly would register on the hoppier side of things. It's drinkable, but probably not a top pick from me for the reason stated above. Just too one-dimensional and boring. If this is one of the least hoppy beers Stone brews, that's saying something."
"Overall a medium hopped brew with mildly sweet and smooth maltiness and carbonation all blend well. leaves a mild hop dry bite with some alcohol warmth. A good brew but not a GOOD brew."
"There is not a ton to say about this beer but it is a great every day drinker. Very tasty. I will probably continue to buy many more 6 packs."
"Fabulous beer...Very hoppy, although, it is a more ""earthy"" type of hop note. Wonderful balance of malt/hops. I highly recommend this beer, it is one of the best beers I have ever had. Stone beers never cease to impress the hell out of me. It seems like they just don't miss! Although their pale ale was not great, but not bad either."
"D - I enjoyed this one pretty well, and it could easily become a session beer. Nice down to earth beer."
"Will have to try again, I think this could be high on my list if the carbonation wasn't so screwed up."
"Some very conflicting ratings, I think some got bad bottles. This a pretty stellar Stone Beer. Some Others are better, but I would get again."
"D: This is flavorful, refreshing, and perfect to session."
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a medium foamy off-white head that recedes rather quickly. Small patches of lacing. Piney hops along with caramel and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with hops, toasted malt and grapefruit flavors. The finish is balanced between citrusy hops and sweet malt, leaving a roasted malt aftertaste. Interesting take on an Amber Ale, leave it to Stone to put a spin on it like this. Insanely drinkable..."
"Drinkability -- I really do enjoy this one. Quite drinkabile, and about as balanced as Stone is *ever* going to get. Granted, it's no Ruination, but that's probably why I like it. It fills a necessary niche: a hoppy, flavorful ale that won't put you down after two or three glasses. Might be a good crossover beer for one's non-craft fans."
"d- great, really tasty stone brew, the best amber that i've had in a long while. i would and will drink this again for sure."
"dont know why i have missed this one in the past but it was stellar no doubt."
"Good balance between hoppiness and sweet malt- you expect Stone to have strong hops and this was lighter than expected. The beer was quite refreshing despite the expected strength based on color alone. Very floral nature but not overwhelming. Nice overall."
"This is a very good beer. The smell is not like most beer. This is one you shouldn't pass up."
"D- Exceptionally drinkable. Goes down smooth and easy. Excellent brew!"
"All in all, this is a decent brew. Probably my least favorite of the Stone I've tried. Guess I'm more of a big beer guy, but, this is a solid beer for the session brew lover!"
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. You rarely get this much flavor from a low ABV beer. This is one you need to try. I will be buying many more in the future."
"This brew pours a nice deep mahogany hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a smoggy two finger head that stays with a rim of lacing on the outer,the smell is a perfect vibrant balnace of fruity stonefruit hops and sweet toffee,caramel malts,the mouthfeel is just under medium and has tastes of raspberries,stonefruit,sweet caramel candy and leaves you with a bitter stonefruit finish which makes you want another sip,overall im so glad ive tried it but given its nearly the same price as the rest of their range we have here id rather have a ruination but in saying that there really isnt too much wrong with this and i could drink it all night but i just prefer their other brews cheers."
"D - Considering the low ABV and the great taste, you could drink these all day easily."
"Pours a dulled coppery amber color with nice fluffy cap of off-white head. Scent is of grapefruit, mango, hints of pine with a nice sweet carmel and roasted nut backbone. Taste brings the components of scent... fruity tropical and citrus hops from the begining, with a nice sweet carmely malt backbone. Medium bodied, good carbonation. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in balance and drinkability, an excellent amber."
"drinkability - hard to believe that a beer with this much flavor is only 4.4%, makes it very drinkable"
"D - this is a solid amber ale. Nice hoppy profile with the perfect amount of malt backbone. This is only 4.4% abv?! If I could get this on a regular basis, this would be my go-to session beer. I really enjoyed this one."
"An easy drinker that is perfect for a session."
"This is a miss for me, but those who want a low ABV hop monster may enjoy this."
"Pretty one-note. Hops hops hops. It's drinkable, yet boring."
"D: Wonderful flavor made that much more attractive by it's session-worthy strength. Stone packs a ton into this 'little' beer, making it certainly among the most 'drinkable' of any I've had to date."
"Another awesome one from Stone!"
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a medium foamy off-white head that recedes rather quickly. Small patches of lacing. Piney hops along with caramel and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with hops, toasted malt and grapefruit flavors. The finish is balanced between citrusy hops and sweet malt, leaving a roasted malt aftertaste."
"It's light enough to session, and is packed with toasty malt flavor with Stone's trademark hoppiness. Definitely has it's place in their lineup, this is what i'll reach for when i'm thirsty and don't want a huge DIPA or Imperial Stout..."
"Drinkability - Too weak. Its like a waterdown stone ipa. Low alcohol, low flavor, low malts = low drinkability. This is the first stone beer that i dont care to drink again"
"D - A very drinkable amber beer, the only thing slowing me down is the insane level of head on this brew. It's border-line outrageous and keeping me from drinking it. Time to spoon it out..."
"Stone Levitation poured clear, ruddy amber in appearance with two finger of beige foam that subsided to a little layer on top. The foam is sticky leaving a mesh of lacing on the side of the glass. The beer smells like brown sugar, caramel and piney. The beer is very dry with toasted malt flavor and a smooth bitterness. As the beer warms, it has an earthier smell and taste like portobella mushrooms. The mouth feel is rounded with pleasant carbonation."
"All in all, a great light beer for packing such a large punch. Would definitely recommend it to anybody."
"Cheers.."
"Drinkability: Admittedly my distaste for red ale clouds my decision, however this one really was not terrible. Better than most red ales I've had."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a small grapefruit hop, quite fresh as well. In the taste, small citrus like hop and a nice balanced maltiness. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer, small grapefruit hop aftertaste. Just a decent ale with a touch more hops."
"D - Good beer, but nothing spectacular. I could drink a few of these, but would most likely reach for something else with either more hop flavor or stronger."
"This is a good red ale. Nice balance between the piney/caramel flavors"
"Since I am a hophead, I would seek this out again. Alas, I am in Utah and they do not distribute here. I really like Stone, they brew good, if very hoppy, beer."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells strongly of citrus hops, sweet malt, citrus (grapefruit), and an unknown but familiar aroma (yeast strain?). Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, hint of pine, hint of mango, sweet malt, yeast, and possibly pineapple. Overall, good appearance, body, and blend."
"Only Stone could pack this level of hopping into a session ale. I don't think I've ever before encountered such a relatively-low ABV beer with such bold but complex hop bittering. Also surprising that the malt is sufficient to withstand the hops onslaught, yet the overall mouthfeel is quite moderate. This will be a future go-to when I need a hops fix, but a bit less horsepower."
"D: This was a nice strongly flavored amber ale with great body. It was very easy to drink, but I wish it had more juicy hops and less metallic (like a smaller version of the 13th Anniversary beer). This is still nicely enjoyable, but not amazingly good."
"D: A highly drinkable session beer."
"Overall very tasty and interestingly simple."
"D- Very sessionable beer, light hops and even lighter malt with no alcohol presence is very nice for drinkability..."
"I believe that this beer is the younger brother of Arrogant Bastard. It has less hops, less malt, and less alcohol, but it's flavors are very similar. An excellent beer from stone, and one which I will definitely revisit soon."
"This is a great beer to really excite your palate, but I'm not sure I'd want to drink more than two back to back before getting a little palate fatigue. There is a lot to appreciate about this beer, and it really commands a lot of attention for a beer of this ABV. Great stuff."
"Pours a nice dark amber color with a loose foamy head. Nose hints at a hoppy bitterness which appears at the first sip; however, it is a less than satisfying, one dimensional hoppiness which predominates. The prevailing flavor is ephemeral, leaving a mere intimation of what might have been. Could drink more than one, but it's not an ale to savor."
"M & D - Nice light body with great flavor and balance. Very drinkable."
"d-still surprised. how does stone do it? so much taste in such a small abv. adjunct brewers, take note."
"D: Easy to drink this amber ale...low abv and big hop taste make this easy to session for me. I know hops can range from small amounts to large amounts for amber ales and this one had a ton of hops and not so much malt."
"Served from tap into a tumbler. Pours a brownish red-orange with a one finger off-white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and a massive hop note. The flavor was of malt, citrus, and a very subtle hop. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. The aroma was very nice for hop-heads, and the flavor was very nice for all other beer drinkers out there. It went down really smoothly. Kudos to Stone for this one..."
"Really enjoyed this on cask, now I get to try it in a bottle. Pours a really reddish brown color with a mega Head, I mean mega that is 4 fingers and leaves ridiculous lacing. Aroma is on point with what I am looking for in a red ale. Has a solid hop prescence with some nice caramelized malts and a spicy herbal note. Has a grate malty hop taste that I can't believe come s from such a low abv brew. Caramel, spice, pine and vanilla come through. Perfect carbonation as it is low or at least has silky sewer bubbles. Drinkability is great. Low abv and has a huge flavornprofile. Gotta keep this in my fridge."
"DB- Very refreshing beer with lower ABV. It has that signature Stone hoppy taste but malt is mixed in very well. I could session this one any day, I might depending on how much money I want to spend. Stone is solid."
"D - Super drinkable. Great session beer. With a nice low ABV and a great flavor without being too in your face, this is one I'll certainly revisit."
"D - The perfect session beer and possibly the best amber that I've ever had."
"Like a top-quality British pub beer: This beer exactly fits my beer-drinking needs -- it's available in a small bottle, it's low in alcohol, it has a bitter complexity that sustains interest, and it is impressively easy to drink. Beautiful clear, dark-brown appearance. A formidable head, like beaten egg whites. Hoppy, honeyed taste. I could easily drink three of them with no palate fatigue (and no hangover)."
"Overall this a very easy drinking beer that has some wonderful mild flavors going for it. The malt base reminds me of a good English mild or brown ale but the hops remind me of American pale ale, a great combo."
"Moderate carbonation and a slightly thin (or pleasantly light, depending on your mood) mouthfeel. Brief caramel sweetness followed by a nicely bitter finish of pine and citrus. Wasn't initially impressed, but this one grew on me -- the finish is this very drinkable brew's best quality."
"D: I'm going back and forth here b/w a 4 and a 4.5. Decided to bump it up because of the low (4.4%) ABV. Flavorful low-alcohol beers should be rewarded a bit, and it's only 10% of the score."
"Very nice beer, well hopped. I gave it a little extra for mouthfeel just because I thought Stone did a lot with a 4.4% ABV beer."
"Drinkability: This is probably the worst beer I've had from Stone so far, yet it's still pretty good. Not the best Amber Ale I've had, but surely better than many. Worth a taste."
"My first but not my last"
"Bright amber red (surprising) in the glass with a thick head that required a slow pour, a lot of lace and the beer itself is quite clear. The smell is west coast hops with a bit of a bready grain malt in the background maybe a bit weak overall. The taste matches the smell. A fair dose of hops come to the forefront with a decent backing of bread and grain. The malt character is a bit one dimensional and maybe a bit thin for the amount of hop in this beer, given the style. Mouthfeel is good carbonation is tight and lively the hop oil gives a drying, lasting bitter sensation, slightly slick due to the hops. Quite sessionable complex yet easy to drink and enjoy overall pretty good."
"Notes: While this beer may not be super complex or the most flavor/bitter/whatever ale out there, it is damn good. It fills a very necessary gap for me at least...a nice hoppy session beer."
"Overall a solid stone brew, maybe not my favorite style, but it works."
"D - Eh this just doesn't do it for me, has a lot of hop bitterness and that is about it, definitely one dimensional."
"D- Pretty drinkable. You have to keep in mind that this beer is only 4.4%. For a session beer this low in alcohol it is huge in taste."
"This is a run-of-the-mill amber ale that's way over-hopped. No complexity of flavors, the sweetness does not integrate at all with the hops which really just take over the beer. Not sure what Stone was trying to do here, or if they bothered to think about what they were doing, but this one does nothing for me."
"D: This was definitely an interesting American amber/red. I understand they were attempting to show good flavored beers can come in small packages (4.4 abv) and I feel they did that but the hop-character strongly out dueled the malt in my opinion. Without the hop in this beer would be pretty flavorless, but could be a side-effect of the freshness of the bottle. I would drink again."
"A great, lacing, long lasting off-white head until the very last sip. This is a great looking beer. The aroma lets you know that this is a Stone beer and the hops are coming despite the style and low ABV. Light bodied and refreshing. Awesome balance in the flavor profile. A semi- sweet, toasty caramel malt battles a nice blend of pine, citrus and earthy hops. The light pine hops shine though again on the finish. Nice bite. The near perfect hop/malt balance and light profile make this a very drinkable ale."
"Pours a brickish dark orange color, tan head with some stick. Smells of glorious, piny hops. Taste hits with a pile of grapefruity, citrusy hops and ends with even more. Finishes smooth and a bit sweet, kind of dry, but not as much as I'd expect. I'm missing some malt in this beer, though. This is an impressive stab at a lower alcohol amber ale, for sure, but it tastes like a low body ale that's disguised by a ton of hopping and dry-hopping. A quality brew, but I'd rather reach for something else if I'm in need of a lighter beer. It's just too ""thin."""
"A nice session amber that you should when you're just looking to kick back a few."
"One of my Father's day gifts. Pours about 1/2 inch foam into the stemmed glass. A nice coppery near brown shade. Wonderful piney smell and an equally piney hoppy citrusy taste. Nectar of the gods. Extremely drinkable, I could have three or four at a sitting."
"D - dangerously so! :)"
"D- all day."
"D. A very easy to drink session beer. It lacks complexity in the taste but is still a nice ale. This is the least complex tasting ale I have had so far from Stone but it is the weakest in strength so one would expect that."
"D: i found it to be a little filling. i could not drink a whole lot of these. i might buy it again. not first pick."
"When most people think of Stone they think of big bold beers with a ton of hops. This is the everyday drinking beer that clocks in at 4.4 % ABV and has more malt than hops on the finish. Very drinkable and well made this is a great amber ale that sessions wonderfully. I don't always feel like an 8% hop monster or a big stout and I am glad Stone make this beer"
"SERVING TYPE: BOTTLE"
"D - This could be an every day beer for me. It would be spectacular if I had a keg lying around the house for my own use. It's so boss."
"My impression is that it's good, but I won't hand over its medals. I'll order it again. The best I had, and if you can find it, it's very well worth ordering, is the Epic '08. I'll review it soon."
"Drinkability - A nice beer all around."
"D - I would consider this a nice year around option. Big enough flavor for winter and light enough alcohol for summer (4.4% ABV)."
"M/D: This beer is pretty thick with nice carbonation and a lot of small bubbles. It is a really nice beer for a such a low abv, and is a little brother to some of the other Stone beers. It is a great choice when you need a beer to unwind with."
"D - I wanted to keep drinking it, but held off to let the experience linger. How does that sound for drinkability?"
"My only thing I would change is I would make the taste a little stronger, maybe more malt, but that is being picky."
"D- Very poor. I don't know, I hated the taste of this. I don't want to drink this again."
"Buy Again? Yes."
"Poured bottle into pint glass. Good finger and a half of off white head that lasted the duration, with plenty of lacing. Great deep reddish brown colour. Faintly sweet aroma with some floral hops and little else. Smooth drinking,medium bodied with some sweetness, the aforementioned floral hoppiness and then some bitterness in the finish. Enjoyed this very drinkable beer and would certainly drink again as a session ale. Think this would be quite versatile with food, since it's not a total tastebud-assault."
"And yet I enjoyed this beer much more than I expected. It's refreshing, it's bitingly fizzy and the low alcohol content makes it a bonus at dinnertime. I will happily drink the six-pack I dragged home, but I probably won't buy another one. Worth a try, but keep your expectations in line with the brewery."
"D: This is a true session beer. Easy to drink, light but with a well balanced flavor. This is the kind of beer you should find in most traditional bars, as opposed to BMC. But were a long way from those large, macro conglomerates taking a back seat to any beers that are actually good, since the majority of beer drinkers drink beer for the alcohol, not the taste. Too bad. Nonetheless, this is a solid beer."
" I'm down with mellow, mild's and lighter brews but this one is all over the palce with no direction home. oh well."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Had a 3 finger light frothy head that ate at itself from the inside as it lessened. Head lasted 5-10 minutes Large streams of carbonation rose from the bottom. Color was a dark orangey amber with a slight haze to it. Aroma was hoppy, small amount of brown sugar sweet. Also hints of a molasses type aroma. Flavor was hoppy spicy with a touch of vanilla. Felt solid in the mouth, coated a bit to well, was almost to sticky. Very pleasant to drink, well balanced with a mellow finish."
"Overall, another good offering from Stone. To be honest it seemed like a toned down Arrogant Bastard in some ways. I would drink it again on tap."
"D: Very intresting interpretation of an amber ale with a spicey twist. Drank well an was really enjoying this offering from stone."
"D: this is a great session beer. Loads of flavor and one hell of a hoppy nose. As I said before, the only down side is that the flavor doesn't deliver the same hop punch as the nose."
"D- Its pretty drinkable...very low ABV, but on the same token, the flavors aren't as potent as I'd like either. There are other ambers I'd go with being from the east coast, but if you're out west, I guess this would be a decent option for the style."
"Damn fine product! Poured a small to medium sized light copper tan frothy head that mostly faded and some lace. Color is a clear copper amber. Aroma is hop caramel yeast caramel old leather roasty. Flavor is like aroma and quite tasty. Not overly hop fruity thank god. Good body and carbonation. Great finish that's like flavor and of medium length. Most definitely a session beer."
"I felt this was a very good beer from Stone. Again."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good. Would make a great lawnmower beer."
"This is a very drinkable IPA for the IPA lover, as it isn't overboard on the ABV. Dare I say- ""Arrogant Bastard Light""??"
"drinkability - the flavors aren't incredibly robust but it's an easy drinking ale"
"Drinkability: very drinkable beer. I could drink this all day."
"M/D: Keeps a grasp on a lot of the flavors, this is a low abv amber ale? It has so much kick/flavor."
"Drinkability: This has quite a full character, which I enjoyed. This is a good beer to relax with, even though I do not get into this style that often."
"D: A very easy-drinking, refreshing beer. The pineapple flavor is quite pleasant, but I would expect a little more malty sweetness for this type of beer."
"D - This is a very tasty and flavorful beer for it only being 4.4% ABV. This is a nice alternative to Arrogant Bastard for those who are new to Stone or want to take it easy on the bitterness level for the night."
"If I have to say so myself I'd say this is a weak Arrogant Bastard. But I do have to say that this is a damn good brew and I'll be sharing it with my friends at later dates."
"Overall, this is another good offering from stone. This is one of the most flavorful beers i have had at this low of an abv. I will definitely be seeking out a full 6 pack of these soon."
"D - I could probably go through a whole bunch of these, especially with the low ABV. Tasty enough to not get too boring, but not overwhelming either."
"Pours out a hazy amber brew with smallish head. head dissipates quickly. Mild carbonation. Smells very nice ,mostly earthy type hops. Mildly hoppy beer nicely rounded. Very slight tartness that works well. Mouthfeel is blah {in all fairness i dont know how old this beer is, not dated}.A very drinkable beer good just about anytime."
"D - I for one like big beers and refers to 5.5% abv beers as session beers because most under that lack flavor in my experience however this one kicks some ass its one of those beers that if I had to choose five beers to drink for the rest of my life it would be one definitely worth trying"
"I love this beer. Just what I'm after. Lots of flavor and something I can have more than 2 of and not need a nap. More like this please."
"D: could definitely drink more of these but overall I am somewhat disappointed in Stone on this one."
"All in all-- This is highly drinkable. Low ABV makes it sessionable enough (considering I'm finishing my 4th one right now), and the flavor is plenty good. I might buy more of this if only to hand to my Fat Tire drinking buds and hear their opinions."
"Drinkability: Very nice to sip on, could easily drink a number of these."
"Overall, a decent ale."
"Stone Levitation, the misunderstood baby brother of the Stone family. Pours a ruby amber with a creamy red-hued tan head with very good retention and lacing. Aroma is tea-like with a floral nose, grapefruit, toast, and caramel. Tastes of geranium, grapefruit, earth, pine. Finish has more flora, and a dry cookie taste. Medium with a prickly carbonation. I drank this pint well, and will do more in the future. Levitation is a fine, fine beer."
"D - could be more balanced. tasting blind I would call it an IPA, not an amber ale. similar to arrogant bastard."
"drinkability: Been really excited to try this. Whay a great idea. a session beer for real beer lovers have when they don't want to get buzzed. Because I have to work at 6am tomorrow. perfect!"
"After having this a few times on tap at various spots, I'm finally getting down to rating it (based on a bottle I picked up a couple of weeks ago). Levitation pours a hazy red, with a big, fluffy eggshell head. There are a few spots of lace, here and there, that get left on the glass; the head subsides to a thin layer / ring of creaminess. Smell is dominated by hops: grassy, herbal and hemp are big. Taste has some light caramel malt notes (very light) - the herbal hop character takes center stage. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but what would you expect from a 4.4% brew? Carbonation is a bit high, but seems fitting. Based on the abv, drinkability is up there... The fact that it's a good beer helps, too."
"This would not be a session ale for me."
"A great beer. I'm in the CHI and we just got some Stone distribution, like, this week, so I'm pretty psyched about this while trying to review objectively. A little less roast, a little more body, but hey, I'm not complaining."
"D-I have a really hard time drinking these slowly. Really nice, flavorful, and thirst-quenching. Stone came to Chicago just in time for summer, and I have a feeling this will be a go to beer for me in the upcoming warmer months."
"355ml bottle at Bar Volo in Toronto, ON. Pours a burgundy red hue with dark ruby edges, two fingers of cream coloured, off-white head, and speckles of lacing on the flute glass. Smell and taste are strong citrus, tangerine, and clementine, slight yeastiness, pink grapefruit, burnt caramel, light nuttiness, toast, and a bold hop bitterness to finish. So much flavour for such a light beer, very impressive. Mouthfeel is medium, lush and slick, spicy hop punch mid-body, lingering dryness with a mildly citric aftertaste. The ideal session beer. If this were available in Ontario stores, it would never leave my fridge."
"I have to assume this is the lowest ABV beer stone makes, so theres major drinkability to it. It's tasty too, so that helps."
"D - Somewhat harder to drink than expected for something with such low ABV. Maybe it's just the stronger than expected flavors."
"Drinkability: Huge flavor for such a low abv ale. Not really what I would think of as an Amber Ale - seems more like a very bitter, American hop version of an English Bitter. Very tasty and sessionable due to the low alcohol, but the bitterness and tartness is off-putting for the light body and hampers drinkability."
"This is a session beer for hopheads."
"D - It is very drinkable, but in the same way that a lot of other mediocre beers are: you can drink a lot before tiring. A good but not great beer."
"Very sessionable. The hops are quite strong. This reminds me of a DIPA in taste and smell."
"D- another winner from Stone! one of the best light beers I've ever tried"
"D: Could have had this one all night. I found this beer to be one of the more enjoyable beers I've had, not technically flawless but it was just fantastic. The dry finish with the wonderful ballance of hops and malt allows you to drink several."
"Drinkability - Bought this as a single and am very pleased. At 4.4% abv this beer has loads of wonderful flavor and goes down smoothly. As this is only my second brew from Stone this beer has me hooked on trying their other beers. Great color, inviting aroma, the taste to match, and easy drinking."
"I definately recommend this brew to anyone, nice and refreshing, high drinkability."
"This is a very good beer. It will be great during the summer when you want something crisp, light, and without much alcohol, but also full flavored and hoppy. I would buy this again for sure. Recommended."
"For such a low abv and lighter body, this has some well defined flavor. This would make for a great session brew."
" Very Good brew!"
"cost 10.99 for the sixpack... not crazy about that"
"D: Great flavor + low ABV = a great session beer. Now if only I didn't have to buy it in Tennessee at 13 bucks a sixer..."
"Decently drinkable beer, goes down easy."
"Not sure what happened to this one. Overcarbinated, freshness? Not what I'd come to expect from the fine brewers of Stone. I'm willing to revisit this one later."
"D: Low ABV and packed with flavor this is an excellent session beer. I could easily drink a 6pk of these in one sitting without getting tired of it. Another great offering from Stone."
"D: It a great beer. Great for food pairing. Very light on the palate so would be perfect for lighter fare."
"D: lots of flavor for this abv, sessionable."
"Drinkability is good. I'd be honoured to have a session on this one."
"Drinkability: I think this is a pretty sessionable hoppy brew. With a relatively low ABV it's one you could drink more than one of."
"D - Actually a nice session beer that is not too heavy and the alcohol level is nice and low for a change."
"Did they invent a new style here: 1/2 IPA?"
"O: A very good introductory IPA, but that is about it. A low alcohol, yet refreshing brew."
"A solid session ale, definitely more geared on the hoppy side. This is a pretty dry beer, not much sweetness despite being an amber ale. I would've liked a little more sweetness, but still a nice beer, and very sessionable."
"Taste, despite being I guess what you could call their ""light"" beer, this one still packs a lot of flavor. This is how entry level and session beers should be done. Ample malt and hops for its style. Mouthfeel, interplay of hops is even nicer than many Stone's as it doesn't smack you in the face (which is nice sometimes). Very drinkable, not pretentious, it is what it is, a very good beer that isn't ""to the extreme""."
"for a hoppy amber, i'd take Nugget Nectar over this anyday, since we're talking flavor, not abv."
"Overall, this is hands down one of the best beers I have ever drank that was under 5% ABV."
"Medium-bodied and lightly carbonated, the Levitation is a deliciously easy to drink brew."
"This is a fine session beer!"
"The body was very light for this style. Drinkability was good, I could see having several of these without a problem. Overall, a very good beer that I like a lot, but as a red ale it's lacking. Perhaps if they called this ""Red IPA", or something along those lines, it would give people a clearer idea of what to expect."
"Slainte."
"The beer is very drinkable but lacks a full-bodied mouthfeel I was searching for from this award-winning brewery."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a clear orange/ amber wtih a medium white head, slight lacing. It has a pleasant floral, piney aroma. It taste bigger than it is with strong pine that mellows out in a smooth finish. The beer is medium to light in body and has average carbonation. A very drinkable, hoppy, sessionable beer."
"Pours a nice clear mahogany with a fairly thick creamy off-white head. Aroma is strongly hoppy with cinnamon and woody undertones. Flavor is more hoppy than malty, only slightly bitter and with a warm woody/spicy undertone. Texture is smooth and edgy, fairly tingly, leaving a hoppy but not bitter finish. Another winner from Stone!"
"Levitation is an interesting beer. It's hop forward, but has a nice, mellow sweetness to it."
"Bottle to shaker. Pours a deep amber with medium tan head. Caramel malts on the nose. Medium body and veery smooth on the palate. Tasty but not overbearing, typical of the style. All around a very good beer for sessioning. Superior quality IMO - cheers!"
"4.4%??? Yea, Stone made a big deal about it on the bottle, but there really is a hell of a lot going on in this beer. Whats better than an excellent beer? An excellent beer you can drink the hell out of before your senses dull completely."
"Overall this is a beer that will find its way into my gut again sooner rather than later. I'm glad Stone put out something everyone will enjoy, even my motha."
"M/D: The beer is a little dry, which affects the mouthfeel, particularly with the lightly bitter finish. Medium body, low ABV and overall experience makes it quite drinkable."
"drinkability is great. well balanced. tons of complexity and flavour packed into a relatively low ABV beer. this would be a regular drinker were it available to me all the time, and it's one i'll certainly be picking up again. good stuff!"
"Overall - Tremendous head retention and creamy mouthfeel out of a bottle. Lots of great flavor for such a low-octane beer. Definitely one I will come back to."
"Pretty good beer, and good flavor-to-abv ratio, they did a good job on this. 12 oz bottle to glass. Darker than I expected, a bit like a dark ice tea. Smell is a little bit of hop and malt. Taste is a bit dry, quite a bit of carbonation, but otherwise has a typical west coast pale ale flavor profile. Not sure what the calories are but would be interesting to compare to, say, Sam Adams light."
"Beer is medium bodied and has a good hop character to it. There is a lot of bitterness at the back end. I love session beers, I truly and seriously do. This is one of the best session beers available. Its cheap and wonderful. Second taste, some sweetness up front, mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"Cheers!"
"O: Everything about this beer is nice except for the feel. It needs more body IMHO. I'm a big Stone fan, but I think they missed the mark a bit with this one. However, at 4.4% abv it's still a decently tasting brew that's easily sessionable."
"The liquid is extremely smooth and well-balanced, hitting the tongue in one fell swoop with a tiny burst of hop scratch at the end. The mouthfeel and low ABV make this one dangerously drinkable and Stone's ability to walk the line between sweet fruit and strong hop is a delight to behold."
"Stark hop bitterness but it is not overwhelming. Thin body with a high level of carbonation--it feels like a seltzer. Smooth crystal malt flavor on the initial sip. Quite dry."
"D: I will try this again, but for now, it gets an average rating, which hurts as everything else Stone I have had has been great!"
"Low ABV and a mild pleasant flavor coupled with a soft yet just-substantial-enough body makes this immensely sessionable."
"Overall this is a great session beer from Stone that still has enough flavor to keep thing interesting. If you're looking for something that is a bit lighter, while still retaining some nice hoppy flavor, consider this beer. Recommended."
"While it didn't have an extremely full mouth feel, it still seemed very flavorful, and the payoff is that it did not go to my head at all. It hasn't been since I last had an Anchor small beer that I have satisfied my thirst with a beer and not felt any noticable effects of drinking a beer. So it drank like a light beer, with none of the limitations in other areas."
"D- If I'm looking for a lighter, flavorful amber then I may go to this again in the future. I have no problem putting this one down but something about it is just a little disappointing. I would drink this again if offered to me but I can't say I would purchase this again in the future."
"I love Stone's beers (Arrogant Bastard and Imperial Russian are the reason I love craft beer today - hell, they are the reason I started homebrewing), but I'm having a hard time with this one. Oh well, I'll know not to grab it next time..."
"D- Easy drinking hoppy amber ale. I've had better from stone though..."
"An interesting and easy-drinking Red from Stone. Not the best out there, but pretty solid."
"A bold beer for such a low abv. Very drinkable if you enjoy hops. My introduction to Stone, and well worth $9.99 a sixer!"
"Poured into a snifter, left 1/4 to 1/2"" tan head and good lacing. Brown with red highlights. Smell is very hoppy and grainy. Taste is mild hop with a bit of a wet blueberry thing to it. Very good! Aftertaste is good and bitter. Mouthfeel is medium and very wet. Drinkability is awesome."
"Extraordinary flavorful beer. It has a burnt charcoal taste. Very bitter, yet has a smoothness, too. Some vegetable taste that gives it a hint of sour. For such a low abv, this has a very thick flavorful taste."
"Levitation is easy to drink, with great aroma and flavors. It will work well as a compliment to casual food. This may become my go-to beer for any occasion, and is easily sessionable. This is my favorite Stone offering to date."
"D: It's okay, flavorful and low ABV, but would lose interest after a couple."
"D: HOPS+LIGHT? Let's see, I think you could drink one after another of these, and with the 4.4 ABV, not hit the floor at the usual midnight (2AM here I come!)."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable amber brew, very tasty very well done."
"Pours a clear ruby with fading two finger whitish head. Smell: caramel, pine and citrus hops. Stone yeast character. Taste: leafy, green tea, lemon and grapefruit peel, caramel, slightly buttery. An enjoyable change of pace from Stone. Best by 2/9/10."
"Beer pours dark orange-red with a white head. The aroma is certainly more hoppy than your standard red ale, but that is to be expected from Stone. The aroma is hoppy, with some pine and earthy hop notes. The flavor is definitely hoppy, with some piney hop flavor as well as some caramel malt. This beer is very drinkable and packs great flavor into a low alcohol package."
"However, I can't get over the stigma that it's basically an Arrogant Bastard Light and at $11/6-pack, I'd hope for something a little more worthwhile. Still a solid ale, but not something I'd pick up regularly or order on-tap if other Stone offerings were available."
"This beer was a surprise. Lower in alcohol that most Stone beers that I have had, the flavor and the hop prowess were not diminished. The strong hop character with a slightly caramel flavor of malt made for a good combination and also made me want many more of these. Strong drinkability."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a plain old pint glass. Nice deep, dark red color, with an 1/8"" head that faded away to just a skimming. Pleasant grapefruit/citrus hops with a sweet malt smell underneath. taste is a flip flop of the smell. Lots of sweet malt with a good light balance of hops. good body for the style. A little light for this time of year but I can see myself drinking a lot of these next summer. Overall a tasty, very drinkable brew. I'm always looking for full flavored lower alcohol beers and this one fits the bill perfectly."
"A big tasty amber from Stone, definitely worth trying."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is floral hops.Taste is pine and grapefruit.This taste like a mix of a beer and a pine cleaner.This is not something I would recommend or purchase again.Ahhh nothing like the taste of PineSol early in the morning."
"I haven't had a Stone that I didn't like...going to have to drink and review more!"
"Stone comes through again, good stuff ... and I just noticed I happen to be wearing their T shirt thanks to biegaman bringing me a souvenir from his visit to the brewery, thanks Jan, much appreciated!"
"I think you're really gonna have to have a thing for those floral/pine notes to enjoy this. I didn't."
"Drinkabilty? A decent hop presence, medium body...at 4.4%? From this brewery? Certainly packs more of a punch than beers at that ABV. This is great. I could easily have a couple"
"A nice hoppy Amber ale that is a delight to embibe. Well rounded flavors and a modest alcohol content makes this good for sessions."
"the drinkability is good, it's a nice sessionable beer that's hop dominatted, but easy on the tongue."
"D: This is a good beer. Smell, to me, is a little off-putting, but the taste makes up for it. A nice red ale and I'll enjoy a few of these."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. Easily sessionable."
"D: A Stone beer at 4.4% ABV ???? WTF. All the flavor and low ABV. So drink away."
"Drinkability is excellent...the consumate session beer for hop heads!!"
"D - Not as easy going as most ambers, but this is Stone, so you expect a kick in the flavor profile. Drinks like a hybrid IPA and red ale. Pretty sessionable."
"Drinkability: Interesting beer. I could have several. This does have Stone's hop bite."
"F: Pretty dry but leaves a slight juiciness. Semi bitter as the hops climax on the finish but not over bearing. SOme lingering citrus, a little pine, earthy and fresh musty hops start to come through more and more. A touch of tangerine and orange too."
"D: Sessionable beer from Stone? Not in Texas, but be thankful those of you who live in states unencumbered by such idiotic legislation."
"Kind of flat lack of carbination I think. A resin like after taste. Goes down easy though."
"Not bad. Not bad at all."
"Like all stone, a bit on the high priced side."
"Tasted at 53 degrees F."
"Pours a red, slightly copper color in the pint with a white froth. The nose shows a piney, herbal, citrus, grapefruit character followed by caramel malts. Light and easy to drink with louds of hops and a long finish...a classic pale ale. Honestly, I'm kind of surprised that this is a Stone beer...it's good and a nice beer, but kind of forgettable. It's really just another pale ale...nothing special."
"Overall a nice brew but it doesn't distinguish itself enough to rise to the top eschelon of the style."
"D - The taste of this beer was fantastic, this overtook Red Seal as my favorite Amber Ale, thank God Stone is here, I love these beers"
"Feel and Drinkability: Carbonation is low and is perfect for the beer, it allows everything to come out without getting in the way. Body is medium. This is quite a drinkable beer, no doubt about it. This beer is a very good session beer. You could be drinking on this all night without getting into too much trouble. This is one that I'll definitely be picking up again. I recommend this beer to anyone that wants a break from cascade, its quite unique. I'll be coming back to this one. A great beer that is still hoppy but different than every other hoppy beer out there."
"D: Very good drinkability and very good enjoy ability. A wet hoppiness married with a nice toasted grain backing makes this go down with relative ease and enjoyment. A great session beer that satisfies hop wise with wet, lemony and piney hops. Case worthy."
"Medium bodied with light/medium carbonation. A very unique sessionable beer overall. A light offering with a lot of flavor. I'll be drinking this a lot more often now that Stone has made its way to LA."
"The taste is grapefruit up front, with light, fleeting caramelly, toasted bread and hint of orange zest. At first, the bitter-sweet character is balanced, with light sweetness and bitterness, but the bitterness soon takes over a little too much by the finish and lingers. The finish is lightly bitter with strong grapefruit & faint orange zest. An aftertaste of lightly bitter grapefruit and faint toasted grain follows. The feel is rather thin like mineral water, the character is thin, one-dimensionally grapefruity-orange-zesty hops with nothing to balance. It promptly reveals itself to be superficial in taste/character and lacking complexity. What character it does have is fairly strong, holding up well, so this would be fairly good to have with some mild foods, but drinkability is not very high despite the lower ABV."
"Drinkability is outstanding at this ABV. This is just a very nice session beer from Stone."
"A deep amber color a very consistent color all the way through. A light tan head forms on top, a half inch high, lacing slowly down the glass. A strong grassy and pine fragrance stands out from the glass. That is followed by a slight sweet malty scent. A bread, malt and cracked grain flavors starts out the taste. That is followed by the grass and pine flavors, bringing a tobacco flavor at the end. A strong grassy hop flavor lingers, long after each taste. A medium bodied feel, that gradually gains weight slightly, finishes with mild dryness. This may be the most hop flavored session beer I have had, period. The colorful and enticing look, along the unforgettable aroma and intense flavor, make this the hop heads choice for a session beer."
"I'll take this over a stone pale ale anyday."
"Overall, a good beer worth a try... though I'd probably prefer one of Stone's other brews to this one."
"Stone Levitation Ale is a great offering for those who - for whatever reason - choose or are limited to drinking lower alcohol beers. This doesn't really taste any lighter than standard offerings and is still at least doubly hoppy (read: flavourful) than most commercial beers. Levitation definitely raises the bar way up for lower strength, easily quaffable beers."
"I would really enjoy this beer after a long day at work in 115 degree desert weather to kill my thirst."
"An all around good beer, kind of lite for stone but not bad. Taste is bitter, intense of hopps. The smell also shares this chracteristic. This beer is pretty smooth. The drinkablity is really good. Kind of Reminds me of Magic Hats Roxxy Roles as it is also a red and hoppy."
"D- As usual, Stone comes through with a great beer. Buy many and drink them all at once."
"Everything about this screams 'SESSION'. Its a remarkable achievement, and probably my favourite Stone beer - Arrogant Bastards be damned!"
"Drinkability: Great drinkability thanks to the 4.4 percent ABV. Thanks Stone for my new session beer."
"I enjoyed Levitation after working in the yard on a hot day; however, it wasn't a worthwhile ale experience. Next time I work up a thirst, I'll have a club soda and follow it with an Arrogant Bastard. Now that's worthwhile."
"D: highly drinkable, i could finish the 6 pack myself."
"I paid $12 for a six pack of this. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Effervescent on the tip of the tongue,dry finish, somewhat crisp, medium bodied. Sadly, I disagree with the GABF judges of 2007. It's good for an IPA but not up to the usual Stone Brewing standards by my accounting."
"Deep and dark caramel malts with a dark fruit, maybe cherry flavor. Something chalky mixed in here too, but the juicy malt profile is thick and the hop presence is crazy bitter. Classic Stone Brewing aggressive hop feel with a massive malt punch and piney/peppery finish."
"Hoppy and easy to drink but the sum of flavors doesn't work for me. I like that Stone is selling a low abv beer, and they're doing a pretty good job at packing a big flavor into a little beer. However, something about the combination of citric hops and spicy caramel malt doesn't really work for me. The beer pours a medium mahogany with a nice head that laces the glass well. The aroma is heavy on American hops with a good grapefruit flavor. There's also a very nice, light caramel malt note. I love good session beers, but this one doesn't quite come together. The flavors just seem at odds with each other on the palate. Carbonation is good, and the beer is otherwise well-crafted. It really comes down to some kind of ethereal, entirely subjective reaction. I think that I'm mostly reacting to the malt choices, but it could be anything. So, I'd recommend this beer, but I'm also not going to go out and buy it for myself."
"D - Wow I just found one of my new favorite beers...this one provides you with a great aroma and good flavor and it's only 4.4%...you have to appreciate how well Stone could craft this beer and only weigh in at 4.4%...I will be having more of this one!"
"Mouthfeel: Could use more carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light in body and more carbonation than I would prefer. In fact, this would be awesome on a nitro tap. Great session beer. I could drink this all night. A fantastic hoppy amber from long before that was the rage."
"Moderate mouthfeel, even carbonation, finishes dry and tingly. Tasty and drinkable beer."
"Stone finally gets to CT... and man this was a solid beer right here. I was surprised they made a beer with 4.4% ABV but it has more flavor than most 6 or 7% ABV beers. Super hoppy, but a tad on the lighter side, though it tastes more like a pale ale then an amber/red ale but hey, a good beer is a good beer. A little on the pricey side but definitely will be checking more stuff out from this brewery."
"This one is definitely drinkable, I was a tad disappointed it reminded me of a Arrogant Bastard with less body and lighter, I was expecting a more subtle beer. This is the light beer for the hophead."
"Drinkability: for the style, I quite like this beer. I could definitely quaff a couple of these down the pub sometime, and the relatively low ABV would make this a good sessioner."
"A nice solid brew from Stone. A good offering of an amber ale with a nice hop profile. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Its very drinkable since it is such a light beer; it goes down smooth and easy; and I could definitely session with this beer no problem."
"Overall: A light beer from stone? Not a robust flavor one would expect from the menacing gargoyle but enjoyable nonetheless. The hops were a surprising treat but can they ever make something that has NO hop characteristics? The answer is: No. That is why they rock."
"D- It's an easy drinker. It's a tad out of balance, but would be good for those more inclined to the hop side of the spectrum. It's an interesting take on an AAA, that really works."
"Lots of flavor for such a low ABV beer, which just goes to show a beer doesn't need to be big to be bold. Stone's Levitation reminds me how another exceptional brewery, Surly, absolutely jam-packs flavor into low-ish ABV beers. A highly drinkable beer, obviously."
"Although, I have to say: enough comparing this as a ""lesser"" Arrogant Bastard or some such. As a Fred Eckhart disciple, I agree we need to give ""small beer"" a lot more love. I'm so sick of the ""it's a good beer *even though* it's only 4%"" jive. Who really cares that it's not Extreme Beer? Not this BA."
"Overall, a good brew from Stone, but rather bland when compared to their other offerings. However, extremely sessionable."
"Recommended..."
"Served in a pint glass. Pours a nice clear amber with a thick soapy tan head that laces significantly. The aroma is bright and hoppy with floral and citrus and a hint of malt. The flavor is fruity and malty sweet with a nice balance of hop bitterness. Carbonation is perfect, and it's really easy drinking. I find it much easier drinking than some of Stone's other hoppier beers."
"A 'light' beer from Stone? This one pours a clear red color that has a medium head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is less dominant than expected with some pine and some grapefruit hops and not much maltiness. The flavor has a nice balance of the sweet caramel malt and the citrus hops. It's a fairly refreshing drink. The body is medium and the drinkability is pretty good."
"D - In my opinion, perfect. It's such a good balance of flavors that it goes down really smooth and tastes great!"
"D: This is a nice stone that mellows well as you sip."
"All in all a good very drinkable beer def enjoyed sitting down to a six pack of this"
"From a 12 oz bottle decanted into a pint glass. Pours a solid deep copper. Thin white head. Aromas of rich pine and citrusy hops, maple syrup. Tastes much the same: those big west coast hops, although the flavors disappear quickly. Disappointing lack of aftertaste. Medium bodied - seems good. Overall, very drinkable. A heavily-hopped, west coast amber. Very good."
"Not Stone's best by any means, but not a bad beer at all either."
"Light in body for the style, pleasant, unobtrusive and quite quaffable as a result."
"i think this is stone's worst offering. it seems like they couldn't really make up their mind and overhopped what could have been a fairly decent irish red."
"M/D: the feel is perfectly carbonated with a smooth velvet on the tongue an a slight dryness picking up in the throat after the swallow. The drinkability is good but not for multiples enjoyable none the less."
"Good ale. I like their standard IPA better though."
"Drinkability: While not an earth-shattering brew, this easily would've caught me as a 6-7% brew, and yet it's only 4.4%. I can't tell if it's skewed my ratings at all due to thinking it better for only being that low, but I certainly am glad to have it around for a good sessioning on a relaxed night. Certainly nice to have for wanting flavor and lower-ABV so you can put another one (or more) back after, or use is after drinking a nicer beer as a finisher. Recommeneded to try, it's got more than enough flavor for the ABV."
"The feel is quite light for a Stone beer. A nice soft crisp refreshing beer that is still strong in flavor."
"Mouthfeel is chewy and feels too full, but not bad."
"I finally got around to buying this ale,it had been long enough.Poured into a standard pint glass a lighter shade of amber with a thinner but well retained clingy white head.Almost all pine and grapefruit rind in the nose wich is fine by me,just a faint whif of sweet caramel is there as well.Lighter mouthfeel with hop dominated flavors,quite citric with some lighter pine notes,the caramel base gives off some blancing sweetness.A easy drinking hopped up amber ale,nice."
"I guess I've come to expect a thwack over the head from Stone's brews. This particular beer has the appearance and aroma of their big hitters, but mellows out considerably in the follow through, which would make this their de facto session ale. And as far as lower-alcohol, relatively milder session ales go, this is stellar. It does indeed defy the law of (specific) gravity..."
"d - a great session beer with a lot of body. if i didn't know the abv i would have guessed 6-7%."
"Pours dark, crisp amarillo with a nice thick head. Weak aroma had me inhaling a bit too much. Hints at something good, but is never found with the delivery. Taste is okay for an ale I suppose. Less than desirable feel. All things considered, I wouldn't complain if offered, but wouldn't be high on my purchase list."
"Like I said: not bad, and probably one of the hoppiest session beers out there. But hops by themselves can't carry an entire beer. This is the proof."
"D - Based on the low ABV I could see this one being had more that once."
"Drinkability: serious session ale here that anyone can drink all night. A nice example of a lower alcohol beer with some flavor and depth."
"Drinkability: Stones light beer. I appreciated the idea of having a lower alcohol session-able beer having flavor. My problem with this is it really seems like Arrogant-Bastard stripped of its masculinity. Sure its session-able and you could throw back a few without feeling to bad, but if one arrogant bastard bomber or 12oz is enough to satisfy me then so be it. Quality over quanity. However this is much better then many companies beers category aside. Really an introduction to stone, or craft beer for outsiders. Maybe boosting the flavor a little even if that means a 5% alcohol content."
"Levitation is a nice mix of amber with some slight red thrown in as well as slight orange. The head was nice and lasting but did not have any legs to stand on, no lacing. The smell was pretty bland with just a hint of malt and hops but alot of grain imo. The taste was not all that and really tame with some grain and sweet malt and even less hops to bring about any disernable flavors. Not to much going on here. The feel was light with alot of carbonation leaving a crispness. The alcohol is low making this very sessionable, but I had a hard time finishing my pint. I know this is a light styled brew coming from a company that likes to push the envelope, but i've had other low abv/simple style beers from other company's that have blown this out of the water. It just did not grab me, that's all."
"3.0 D: Body is too light and not complex enough in terms of malts for me to want another."
"Dark syrupy colored body, somewhat hazy. Small tan head doesnt last for too long. Rich malty scent, hints of bitter hops. Taste is mostly red ale malts, touch of bitter hop rounding out the back end. A bit of a metallic taste to it. Very wet mouthfeel, fairly full bodied. Not as impressed with this offering from a very solid brewery."
"drinkability is great. easy going, concentrated, fresh and dangerously session-able. cheers!"
"D - A very assertive brew that has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, especially considering the modest 4.4% ABV... Unique and enjoyable... Another well crafted ale from Stone... Kudos..."
"D- a great sessionable beer. lots of flavor and lots of hops. ill check this one out again whenever i get the chance."
"D- Very, very drinkable...great tasting beer with a lot of character...and with a very mild ABV...good sipping evening beer...that I can drink more than a few of...and be quite content!"
"M/D: Nice medium body that goes down easy. Low ABV gives this one extraoridnary drinkablillty."
"Yes, you can make a high quality, flavorful ale under 5% abv. It's almost like an Americanized version of an English session beer. I bet this would be killer on cask..."
"Reddish orange in color with an enormous head that lasted for 12 ounces. The aroma was coppery and, I don't know, almost dusty. The taste is on the bland side; a little citrus, a little sweet, a little of everything but nothing really out front. Medium bodied with carbonation still left for the throat after most of it was spent in the foamy head. Drinkability was good."
"Drinkability: Carbonated malty water, perhaps a meal would bring out more flavors; a bit disappointing"
"D: Very drinkable!!! This is one of my favorites because of the low ABV despite a TON of flavor. Maybe my favorite session beer."
"D: The lightest of all the Stone brews, but not my favorite taste-wise."
"Overally, this is a real nice drinker with a lot more flavor (mostly hops) from such a low ABV beer."
"D: An okay beer, better than most, but probably my least favorite Stone offering. Nothing overly exciting and missing that over-the-top hop character I have come to love with Stone beers."
"Poured a clear copper body with a two-finger white head. An interesting hoppy and caramel malt smell, but the smells are light (not faint). The aroma seems to be passive. An easy-drinking, thin but flavor packed body with a a very large citric/grape hoppy taste but not like usual Stone beers. The hops are not overpowering and not the only focal point of the beer; coupled with some light sweet and roasted malts the beer is a balanced drink that leaves both hop and malt sensations with a slight dry edge. A very enjoyable beer that is worth trying."
"HV"
"Drinkability: very drinkable. alchohol percentage is reasonable, so definitely a beer that can be consumed for a good while."
"Always intrigued by Stone's brews but sadly, being a lightweight, always put-off by the higher ABV numbers, I was pleased to see this on the shelf. Bought the 6'er on the spot. Very good decision. Very impressive, right from the awesome bottle graphics (including a 2007 GABF Gold Medal logo on the neck) to the last very last sip. Nice brown to copper in the glass, with some rising bubbles visible. Decent, tan colored head that stayed through the first few sips and laced the glass nicely. Hint of light biscuity malt in the nose, but the taste matched with a nicely balanced malt and notable hops bitterness that made your mouth water from first sip. The flavor wasn't complex in the sense that it changed or shifted, but it was consistently well balanced and flavorful, with the nice bitter kick at the end. Nothing cloying or ""sweet"" or fruity about it. A definite session beer. Light mouthfeel and carbonation only added to the refreshing nature of the beer; and since it was just 4.4%, it was easily quaffed and enjoyed. Definitely a unique Ale. Almost (dare I say it) reminded me of an Altbier, in the way hops were used. Will be a regular in my fridge."
"A pretty good session beer from Stone. Its only real flaw is that it is a little pricey for a six pack."
"Wow. I've often avoided this beer because it's a low alcohol option from a brewery that seems to specialize in high alcohol beers. But this is very good. You often hear about how hard it is to get a really malty rich beer at below 5% alcohol by volume but this one nails it. Great color, great flavor and aroma and you can drink a whole bunch of these. Bravo."
"Overall, I kind of like this offering from stone. A great session brew, a good choice to bring to a party or something. Very drinkable with alot of flavor and a moderate abv. A well made beer that does what it was meant to do. Not gonna blow your mind, but tasty and easy to drink. A nice beer. Pricetag is a little high for a sixer, but a nice beer."
"Man, given the good look & great smell I thought more flavor would be coming, but it was something of a let-down. This is a gauche way to put it, but it kind of gave me beer blue-balls: great build-up, but then ended with a fizzle where the good stuff should've been."
"This one did not blow me away, but it is a really solid session brew that is easy to drink. Enjoyable for sure."
"not bad at all and very easy to drink. id like to see a little more hop flavor. this may be better when its very fresh. solid"
"This beer works really well...the flavors are pretty well balanced, and it is a beer that can be enjoyed all night long...not just because of the low ABV. I first tried this at Bob's Bar in Columbus...they had it on tap and I'd never heard of it before. My buddies and I proceeded to drink several rounds of them...and I was excited to see that this has now become a regular in bottles."
"won't be a ""go to"" beer, but I liked it all the same."
"Drinkability: Impressive that a flavorful beer is kept at this low of an ABV, but this catch all amber ale style seems to lack definition. Not bad, but not something I would seek out again."
"Great drinkability here. Glad they started making enough of this stuff to send to Ky."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have another, considering Stone makes some strong hoppy brews. (i.e. Arrogant bastard, IPA, Ruination)"
"D: On the whole, a drinkable beer, but Stone has definitely done more dynamic work."
"a really great beer for one of its low alcohol. a lot of flavor, i could be happy with one but easy drinking so i wish i bought more"
"Drinkability: It's a little too fruity for me to get on a regular basis, but it's good enough to get again if I'm in the right mood."
"Appearnace is dark copper with plenty of carbonation. Aroma is a huge, floral hoppy treat. Very surprising. Taste is big and hoppy. I had to check the label again to verify this was 4.4%abv. This is a really big beer for a session beer. Finishes very clean without an overwhleming hop note. This has got to be the little brother of Arrogant Bastard..."
"The beer is very new to the area so the bottle couldn't have been too old. I plan to revisit it on tap when I get the chance to see if I just had a bad bottle. It wasn't an awful or undrinkable beer, but it wasn't a pleasant experience and I walked away pretty disappointed."
"D- at 4.4 abv this is in perfect session beer territory. Flavorful and low abv. Nice mix."
"In my opinion, this one should be classified as a pale ale. But what do I know?"
"Poured from bottle into pint glass, best buy Sept. 09 date. Not to much head but did leave quite a considerable amount of sticky web like lacing on the glass. After it warms it has a dark fruity smell. The ale is a nice lighter addition from Stone but full of flavor. Very drinkable and mild mouth feel although slighty chewy and malty."
"Poured a very nice deep copper color with some nice head and good lacing. Nice scent, very bitter with some nice citrus and floral American hops, but with little of the nice sweet, clean red ale scent I expected to go with it. Nice hoppy, pale-ale-type flavor, nice American hops, with enough malt to keep it near to balanced; much hoppier than a regular red ale, but that was what they were going for. Goes down fine, if a little rough from the slight unbalanced aspect. Pretty darn hoppy for such a low ABV red ale."
"A: Thin wispy head, spots of sticky foam, deep copper colored - 4.00, S: Wonderfully hoppy aroma, a little leafy and woody, also some breadiness and yeastiness - 4.50, T: Loads of hops, quite spicy and a little peppery, significant caramel malt backing, extremely dry, some pungent pine - 3.50, M: A little creamy which provides some mouthfeel but otherwise a little thin - 3.00, D: You gotta love the hops, hands down one of the more heavily hopped ambers that I've had, as an amber ale this is a solid beer, if we had a category for hoppy session beers then this would be near the top - 3.50"
"All in all, it's not terrible, but I will not be buying it again."
"D - really good. Nice to have such hoppy nosed good tasting beer that comes in under 5%. Tasted better than some of the bigger ABV beers I've had. Very drinkable and will be having more of these!"
"Amber color, nice lacing, head recedes to a ring. Aroma is redolentof citrus and piney hops; delicious smell, like an IPA. The flavor is more restrained than a super-hoppy IPA, which makes it quote drinkable and nice. Still a bitter finish which is also nice. A good balance that keeps this in the amber ale zone, but the hoppy oomph makes it particularly enjoyable for people who love hoppy IPAs."
"Solid beer. Not a style that I drink much of, so take my review with a grain of salt.  Not mind blowing, but Stone has put together a nice beer here."
"Overall I've always liked levitation and it's somewhat of a light version of the Arrogant Bastard made by the same people. Good stuff."
"Wasn't sure what to expect with this one as American Amber/Red Ale is an ambiguous category. With one whiff I knew exactly what I was getting. The great thing about this ale is the amount of hops, but it's also in the sessionable category with a 4.4%ABV rating. Usually I find these to be 6% or above. Recommended."
"D- light and goes down easy."
"Overall I am disappointed with this beer. I'm not saying a low ABV deserves low scores, but even low ABV beers can have high taste. Yards Brawler is the perfect example. To me, this beer was very average and ordinary lacking body and taste. Shame because this was my first disappointment from Stone."
"Due to being pretty flavorful and low in alcohol, this scores pretty high in the drinkability category."
"Highly drinkable and accessible enough for most new craft beer enthusiasts. A very nice attempt at a session beer by stone--at 4.4% I could and would drink a lot of this."
"Poured to about a 1 inch head. Pretty dark, almost brown in color. Head was slightly offwhite. Had some lacing but not alot. Smelled of hops and had a slight citrus smell. Actualy the whole smell was light. Tasted slightly bitter and hoppy. Slight bitter aftertaste hung around a while. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was about right. Overall good tasting. I thought maybe to bitter of an aftertaste."
"Very drinkable. I find myself taking the first swig right out of the bottle with out even noticing. Then I look at my empty glass and realize..."
"12 oz. Nice amber pour with a tan head that slowly fades to white. Piney citrus aromas with some malt accenting. A pretty hoppy amber, some citrus and grass notes. Real good flavor for basicaly a light beer abv. Great drinkability, a good amber ale. The session beer to end all session beers."
"Drinkability: All day. This is good stuff. Just a regular old good beer from a big beer brewery."
"I'll have one of these as a change of pace, but I can't see it becoming something I regularly crave."
"Easy to drink and pretty good."
"The feel is medium body, a little dry and bready. That yeast helps. It's like an English Bitter, loaded with yeast and a flowery, citrus hop. A damn fine selection."
"Drinks very well, is refreshing on days both hot and cool."
"D- A nice beer, nothing too over the top..easy drinking, but worth drinking (if you know what I mean...)"
"Hard to believe this is a 4.4 abv beer. All aspects of this beer point to it beeing a slightly lighter version of Arrogant Bastard. Complex flavor, great mouthfeel, awesome aroma, and great drinkability. This is truly a fine choice for a session beer from one of my favorite brewers."
"Better than average Amber Ale from Stone here. Shore up the nose and body a bit and this would be damn good."
"This beer pours a clear, deep amber color with a one finger offwhite/light yellow tinge to it head. Nice head retendtion with spotty thick lacing left behind. Nose is predominantely of citrus hops, grapefruit is most detectable, and a good representation of pine. Graininess and light toasted malts are also detectable. Taste is of pine,spice and some earthiness at first. It gives way to mild toasted malts and a touch of grains before finishing with a nice citrus kick - grapefruit again is the most detectable.- Light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation, some what oily with a sticky finish. This is a nice beer to sit with for a night!"
"I didn't know what to expect, but this is a very well made session beer that does not overpower."
"Amazingly drinkable. At 4.5% you really can't go wrong with this guy. The flavors are great and it very satisfying."
"MF&D - a thinner than expected body, which is a little thicker than water. not a bad beer by any means, but not my cup of hop filled tea."
"The mouth on this is weak. Very thin and wet. I see plenty of rising bubbles in it, and a decent head, but there is no carbonation crispness at all. Disappointing. Flavor is pretty tame as well. I expected more from this. Some bitter hops right away, but this gives way to bready sweetness. I expected more along the lines of a NN, or something of that sort. This was far short. I won't seek this out again."
"Pours a deep copper, almost amber color, and very clear. There's a dense off white head sitting on top, which leaves good lacing throughout the drink. The smell is almost pure Amarillo on my end. There are resins, quite a bit of grapefruit, but the pungent smells are almost leafy, grassy, and earthy. Way more in the smell than you would expect from a 4.4% beer. Though there isn't as much of a malt presence from an Amber ale, a bit of some toasty sweetness though. Still, I'm exited to taste after smelling. The taste starts out a little toasty, but become very heavy on the breadiness, with a nice kick of caramel sweetness. A lot more malt body to this than in the smell. There are tons of sticky resins, which combined with the smell, suggests that there is quite a bit of dry-hopping going on in this beer. There's a nice bit of orange juice sweetness thanks the the malt combining with the hops, but a great balance and fairly low bitterness. The mouthfeel is just great for such low ABV. It's quite full, without ever being too sweet. And I just love the resnious feel. This one is a great American session beer. Not as low in ABV as some of its British counterparts, but still very impressive. The flavor entirely delivers, and deceives you into thinking you're drinking something much stronger. You have to love a beer like this. I know I do."
"Slightly thin head, very dimpled and reddish-brown in color, solid lacing, evaporates at a semi-rapid clip. Lightest gauziness, otherwise clear in spite of the darkness of the amber red color, more burnt orange around the rims. not a lot of visible carbonation. Dry nose, some pumpernickel but more like dried cake, the caramel and toffee fade in favor of pine, mixed white citrus and crushed flowers, not much by way of fruit scents, overall dryness contributes to increasing perception of grassiness. Medium-bodied, very persistent prickle to the carbonation, almost like fine sandpaper. More of a scone, muffin or biscuit sort of sweetness, the malts don't take hold deeply, you get caramel, mocha powder and a light glazed thing but it's really a showcase for the grapefruit, lemon citrus, pine, hay, metallic tap water stuff. Astringent finish as the body drops off, tacky residue weighs heavily on the tongue. Kinda watery, not sure what others see in this."
"Quite sessionable and plenty of hops to please the hop enthusiast. Well balanced all around."
"Notes: A great sessionable beer. Best way I've heard it described is an ""extreme session"" beer. Light, but packed with good flavors and layers."
"I beleive it was on a thread i heard someone refer to this as ""Arrogant Bastard Light"" and while there is nothing ""light"" about this beer, when compared to AB, this beer is exactly that, a big beer, in a little package. enjoy!"
"A bit bitter for the style...I happen to agree with this being Arrogant Bastard Light. Still a good beer though..."
"D - A drinkable, hoppy example of the style. The lemony hops are kind of sharp, but that seems to be typical of stone beers. I think drinkability and balance would improve if the finish was a bit sweeter, but there is a lot of character here for a low ABV session beer."
"Drinkability- Great. There are lots subtle flavors going on that keep you interesting."
"Tried this beer at the Stone Brewery gardens just north of San Diego. Found the beer to be a bit bitter and a little thin compared to most Stone brews. So I personally would not just sit around drinking this beer. I think there are better beers that the Stone Brewery puts out including their IPA."
"Pours a beautiful deep amber bordering on garnet with a nice frothy beige head. The aroma is nice but subdued, with some caramel and breadiness as well as some pine and citrus from the hops and your typical ale fruitiness. The flavor is nice but not overwhelming, with some caramel and toasted bread maltiness upfront and some piney and citrus hops on the back end along with a nice estery frutiness. The finish is a little sweet but in no way cloying. The mouthfeel is rich and luxurious without being heavy. The drinkability is off the charts on this one. One of my favorite amber ales, and one of the more balanced examples to boot."
"(D)- Really crisp and refreshing! A solid drinker that a 6 pack would not stand a chance. Its even a great summer beer if you want something with a bit more oomph to it. The hops addition really creates an interesting complexity from dry to crisp sweetness. I did hope there were was more maltiness to it, but still a great beer."
"D- this is a good beer from Stone and i have become a fan. i could pound these back all day."
"The drink is medium-bodied and silky with enough carbonation to keep the quaffability factor quite high. Levitation Ale is a superb session brew from one of my favorite breweries-- the gargoyle never disappoints."
"But, then again, everything else about this beer is lightyears away from the usual ""session"" territory. It's time to rethink session beers altogether."
"D - Initially I was put off by the lack of sweetness as that's something I often associate ambers with, but the drying aspect of Levitation works well. While maybe not quite at the level of mindblowing, Levitation is very unique for a beer of this strength (or lack thereof). Tons of hop flavor without any meddling alcohol burn. Functionally this is sort of like low ABV IPA. I really enjoyed putting back a few of these with some buddies last night and I think it's even better revisiting it tonight. Probably one of the hoppiest and most flavorful (and unfortunately most expensive) 4.4%, truly sessionable beers out there. For the price tag though, I'll take Stone's PA over this any day."
"This one is a tasty little beer though. Great look, a deep maroon color with a huge billowy head that leaves excellent lacing. Perfectly balanced red, with some nice spicy caramel malt with all kinds of fun fruitiness. Appropriate body. Highly drinkable, one I would session."
"easy to drink this one. another session beer i could have more than one of quite easily."
"D: I could definitely knock a 6 pack of these back."
"From the darker than usual color to the pine hop outbursts Levitation seems appropriately Stone. The only thing that doesn't seem quintessential stone is the low 4.4% abv. This beer reminds me of Scrappy from Scooby Doo in the sense that it's small yet hyper aggressive. Very flavorful despite a low abv. Huzzah."
"The most drinkable red I've come across. At times, I'm a homer, but I'd have to say this tops Greensboro's own Red Oak. It's the closest thing to a malt bomb you can take to an afternoon picnic...except an ice cream sundae, I guess, but we're talking about beer...."
"So-so for me, kind of weak."
"J"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a nice amber with a decent off-white head that diminished to a ring and left spotty lacing. Aroma was a nice amount of citrus hops and sweet malts. The taste was a wonderful amount of hops against a nice subtle malt backbone. The beer is quite light and sessionable while retaining its hoppiness. This is a textbook session beer!"
"Poured this into a pint glass, pours an amazing brilliant reddish copper with a foamy fluffy head that leaves nice fat lace on the glass. Smell is of malt and nice hops aroma coming from the glass. Taste is a nice balance of highly hopped with a malt backbone, this feels like a less agressive AB. Overall an extremly nice session beer, low alcohol with a nice strong taste."
"D- Extremely drinkable. great session brew."
"D- Very drinkable. A great brew to session--lots of flavor in a low ABV beer."
"D- This beer is a bit softer than most Stone beer I have had but it would make a nice session beer that still has plenty of flavor and aroma hops. It goes down really smooth."
"Mouthfeel was light to medium in body. Adequate carbonation. Very drinkable. I'm glad to finally have this one distributed in the area. For a very long time one has been able to buy Stone here but only recently can you now find Levitation."
"Stone Levitation Ale pours a dark reddish copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very hoppy and rather nice. The flavor is also quite hoppy, there is some caramel malt hiding in the back, but hops are the star here. The body is light and this beer is very drinkable. A nice session beer. Recommended."
"- Easy to drink, has high marks here... but that is because it is so mild... but overall not much to speak of... if an Amber.. it's low on my list of fav's.. I'll take a Full Sail please."
"Drinkability is ok, easy enough to suck down, but I don't like that it's almost all bittering hops. Ultimately I'm a little disappointed, but whether or not the problem is the recipe or the age of the beer I don't know..."
"So much flavor with such a low ABV--it looks like I've found a perfect session beer. Truth is, I'd been wanting to try this and I finally found a sixpack. I'd have rather picked up a single, but after tasting it, I don't mind having another five waiting around. In fact, I'm glad I do."
"Very good beer, and thanks to everyone in this thread (http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2077723) who recommended it!"
"Overall this is a bitter bomb."
"D= Though the ABV was very sessionable, the super dry hop bitterness would be a bit hard to take all night. Still, for those who want hops and not too much alcohol, thgis is the one."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and crystal, and bisquit malt scent along with a nice hop aroma that balances it out nicely. The taste is good as well. It's bitter up front with a bisquity finish. The hops really make this beer. It's a low alcohol brew with tons of flavor. It's easy drinking with a dry,hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great session beer. It's complex, yet low enough in alcohol that you can drink a sixer and not be loaded."
"A good, drinkable option from the Stone Brewery. I could drink a few of these."
"The aroma was nice and had a caramel nose to it with some citrus hops. The taste was crisp and sweet and had a little hop kick at the end. This is one of my favorite amber's to date. I not that big of a fan of this style but I am now thinking of cloning this one."
"D - Could definitely be a session beer. Nice and refreshing, lower on the abv level, and has a nice balance of flavors."
"This is a great Red Ale. Poured up a nice dark red colour with a frothy, soapy, khaki coloured head that stayed in place for several minutes. Smell is rather assertive citrusy hops and some sweet malts hiding deep down. Taste was pleasant citrusy hop bitterness with a moderate malt backbone. A very solid, well crafted red ale with terrific drinkability. Another solid offering from Stone."
"D: Highly drinkable with the low ABV and crisp, clean finish and feel with plenty of West Coast hops flavor."
"D- A flavorful session beer. I could really see myself drinking a few of these."
"d - the lightness of flavor combined with the piney hops give a very refreshing beer. i'm not a hop head but this seems like a great intro. Seems dark for a summer beer but I have a feeling I will be enjoying a few more this summer."
"D: I had 3 of these real fast, they were tasty."
"D: I could totally sit down to a few of these. One of these hot summer nights I'll have to pick up a few of these."
"A very nice example of the style. Sessionable and almost like drinking an IPA (but not quite)."
"D- Light bodied, low alcohol, tasty, hoppy, easy to drink. What's not to love? Levitation is a great session beer. Recommended!"
"Clear dark mahogany body. Caramel malt, nutty notes and fruity hops. Caramel malt with a fruity citrus hop note. The feel is light and refreshing. Light, smooth, easy drinking, but not plain or typical. A low alcohol, hoppy session beer. Too bad it's $9.99/6pk, that is a bit too much for a session beer IMO."
"taste is creamy, oats, malt, caramel, some spice, and a touch of citrus, ends on the dry side."
"D- For a 4.4 percent beer, it gives you a ton of flavor. Great session brew. At the price I think I would rather have one of their other offerings though."
"Drinkability is high if you like this kind of brew you could probably go through a bunch of them. I only bought one on a mix sixer but next time I think I will try a couple to see if I warm up to it more."
"D: Terribly drinkable. I think I might go find myself a 6er..."
"D: I haven't been dissappointed by Stone yet. I enjoy drinking this even though I don't think I could have more than one."
"Overall, for Stone I was honestly a little disappointed, being used to bigger beers. That said, if I wanted to drink a bunch of something at a bar (not very commmon for me), this would be a great candidate because of the good flavor and low ABV."
"pours a medium brown that has a copper glow around the glass with a creamy white head that dissolves into a broken ring around the shaker. Aroma has caramel malt, tart cranberry and earthy hops. Very unique aroma for an Amber. Flavor is a little watery upfront but develops into a caramel and toffee, once it shows itself, and a mild bitterness. It has a light-medium body that coats your mouth with every sip. Extremely sessionable and unique ale but the nose leads you to believe it may be more complex than it ends up being."
"Dark amber copper color, relatively clear, consistent carbonation. Moderate, frothy butter colored head that diminishes to a thin film with thick sticky rings of lacing. Aroma is...light? Not in a bad way, has a strong hop aroma and malty background, but nothing is overwhelming. Light body with heavy carbonation and a strong hop bite in the finish. Taste has backbone of caramel malt and a very dry hop bite that lingers forever. Entirely different hoppy amber than say Nugget Nectar, this is much thinner and lacking something in the body. Not even really so much an amber or a pale, just seems like a missing body with a hoppy kick. That isn't to say this isn't a nice session beer but it pales when compared to other Stone beers or others in the hoppy amber category."
"Pours a brownish amber with a solid white head. Wow has a great mix of smells I can't exactly place, but some citrus and hop and malt--yum! The mouthfeel is a little thinner than I was expecting but not bad. The flavor is much like the smell--a delightful mix of many different tastes, and in the end it's very good. Definitely a drinkable brew. Very glad I tried it. I'm not usually an amber fan but stone came up with something original and delicious."
"pours a dark rich amber color with a one finger beige head that held up very well and a light sticky lace. mild pine aromas in the nose. very hoppy taste with a bready grainy mouthfeel carbonation crisp. hops dominate if you are a big hop person you will like this beer and the low abv makes it a good session beer. i am not a big hop fan so the 3.5 for drinkability."
"Deep reddish amber with some sticky white lace. Green, piney hops dominate the nose, with barely a trace of sweetness. Hops dominate the flavor as well, with bright, lemon/pine bitterness. The malt body is delicate with hints of bread and dough, which soften as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is light and thin, but not watery. Finishes very clean with lasting hop bitterness. Similar to an English bitter, but with American hop flare. Delicious session beer. One of the best sub-5% abv beers out there, but must be consumed fresh... I imagine the bright hops would dull quickly in this."
"D- Malty overall and dull hop bitterness. Makes for an ok sessional, nothing special here."
"Poured a chestnut hued amber with a rapidly disappearing head. Aroma is mostly hops, a bit raw like this beer could have used a bit more aging. Taste comes across initially as bitter hoppiness followed by the slight sweetness of the malt. This is quickly followed by an earthy flavor that I couldn't place, almost like smoked peat. Overall, it's a strange tasting brew and after having one I really wasn't interested in having another. Not one of Stone's best offerings imho."
"Drinkability- I have to say i was surprised when I found out the alcohol on this beer because not many stone beers are gonna be under a 5 alcohol level but this is a fantastic session beer, had it on tap in nyc and it was just so enjoyable first on its own and then with a nice burger, had such rich full finish, probably the best beer I have ever had with under a 4.5 alcohol thats for sure and even better on tap then when I had it later out of the bottle, a well done beer again by stone"
"Overall a very tasty hop forward amber."
"It paired real well with the order of hot chicken wings that showed up just as I ordered my second. At that point the taste buds were dulled and the hop bitterness still managed to appear through the burning taste buds. I was pleasantly surprised with Levitation and it makes a nice session beer with plenty of character and still guaranteeing that I am not calling a cab that night."
"Stone Levitation Ale is a very clear amber with a thin, yellowed, off-white head that leaves good lacing. It has a resinous citrus aroma that's loud and fresh. It's medium-light bodied, sudsy and smooth with a clean, crisp finish. It's quite bitter. There's a touch of caramel in the flavor, but it's mostly resiny pine and citrus. It's a strong, clean flavor. It's top-heavy, but it's great."
"Bottle #3 of the night. Second time in as many days I've had one, just keeps getting better. This beer has got to be the hoppiest 4.4% I've ever had! It's on the nose and palate and goes down so easy as it should. The hops make you believe you should be getting messed up, but the finish is light and refreshing. If stone weren't so expensive, this would be my everyday summer beer. Exceptional!"
"M&D: quite soothing on the carbonation, though a tad fizzy for my preference, while the body remains medium to echo the balanced flavour profile. This low-gravity ale (by the US standard, of course) packs loads of hops with a surprising balance, a factor that greatly appeals to me in person. Be it ""American Amber Ale"" or ""English Premium Bitter with a US twist", this proves to be one of the most quaffable and lovely hoppy beers that I've had recently. I'm really happy to have tried it, but I uphold my opinion: ""Better serve it cool""! The bottle also bears the mark ""2007 Gold Medal Winner - The Great American Beer Festival"" - a well-deserved award, I think."
"D- Really a terrific session beer. One of Stone's only sessions, but a damn good one."
"D: this is a great beer from Stone. One of the more timid brews by the Stone crew but has some big muscles! Nicely balanced and tasty brew. Could use a bit more juice...but I imagine they had drinkability in mind...they got it!"
"Would buy more when I am looking to session a great craft beer."
"A solid choice for a more modest brew."
"Poured a nice dark amber with thick soapy head. Smelled some citrus hops and toffee. I could taste light caramel, toffee, citrus hops. Kind of surprised of the flavor for a 4.4% ale. Even with that said it was not an excellent beer. It was very thin and did not have a big amount of flavor. Overall this beer could very easily be a session brew. Polishing off a six pack would be easy since its similar to a light beer. Overall I would probably not search this out again but I am glad I tried it. I love stone and I will stick with the ruination, arrogant bastard or RIS when I buy from them. Cheers."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours a clear amber brown with a thick creme head. Nose is wood, sawdust, and citrus. Flavor is a tight citrus with wood. Thick malty tone, but bringing muted hop character. Interestingly subdued. Feel is thick enough on liquid. Carbonation is a bit boisterous. A nice ale. A bit tight, like mentioned before, but still worthy of going for."
"So.. going into this beer I'm really wondering what to expect, considering its got such a low ABV, but I can't imagine stone would put something out thats bland or typical.. for the low abv it certainly is impressive.. a floral, piney hop aroma (not as robust as Ruination or such, but present and nice).. Pours a deep auburn amber with foamy light-tan head. Looks like iced tea or such. Taste is, as you may expect, like a lighter verysion of their ipa.. its not thin by any means, just lighter with a touch of hops and a deep amber-type base. Mouth feels quite light.. The mouth and drinkability are like a light beer, sort of, but just with a decent hop character. I suppose the high price tage (for a beer at 4.5% abv no less) takes off from its ""Drinkability"" for some, but I'm not factoring that in."
"Drinkability - The levitation's highest praise. This stuff is eminently drinkable. With only 4.4 percent alcohol this is the type of big flavored but still solidly sessionable beer I would like to see more of from stone."
"Mouthfeel is kind of watery. Overall this was a disappointment after such a stellar opening."
"D: All day long. A great intro beer for macro drinkers. I was impressed by what Stone did with the style and the lack of ABV on this beer."
"Overall: Good drinkability, nice refreshing beer, not much going on but is a good beer to relax with. The bitterness plays well with the roasted malt and slight sweetness from the malts."
"Maybe the name Levitation Ale has something to do with the light body. Maybe not, but it sounds like it could work. Fairly dry finish with a lingering piney bitterness. Extremely drinkable. I found a sessionable Stone. Who knew? It may not appeal to ""extreme"" beer lovers, but I'm really enjoying it."
"It certainly is a tamed down offering from Stone, but is still a very fine beer. Something I can truly enjoy several of without getting totally rocked."
"Mouthfeel is quite good, just like with most of Stone's beers. Despite the slight strategic mishap with this beer, it's very quaffable."
"Very nice beer. Thanks to brandonbaer for this one."
"Drinkability: A good session brew from Stone. Will try again."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: A destined-to-be-classic session beer for me."
"This brew has the same characteristics of an Arrogant Bastard just to a lesser extent. It pours a deep copper/brownish color. The scent of toasted malts and earthy hops stand out in the nose, and the taste acts accordingly with the scents that I detected. Lighter bodied, but carbonated and smooth. Finishes crisp and hoppy. This is basically a sessionable Arrogant Bastard at 4.4% ABV that you could drink right out of the bottle and not feel the least bit bad about it. You could also drink a whole 6 pack of it and not be totally hammer faced. A solid brew."
"light body, average carbonation. nice easy drinker. good beginer beer, but id still recommend this to the expert. good beer."
"Drinkability: Well, it's definitely a hop-forward West Coast amber. Personally, I'd have preferred more (well, any) malt sweetness to temper the hop character. However, the 4.4% ABV is most appreciated!"
"Pours a hazy brown copper color with a small yet dense khaki colored head. The aroma is fantastic. Nice juicy hops, grapefruit, fresh pine with hints of honey or caramel. Beauty. More of a bittery resiny hop in the flavor, some grapefruit. A weakish caramel malt struggles to support the bitter hop flavor. The body feels a bit thin, almost watery. I was expecting a bigger body but at 4.4%ABV I guess that is a trade off. The carbonation is on the softer side; finishes a tad bitter. A fantastic smelling brew that slides in taste and feel. I appreciate the low abv but this could use a bit more of a malt presence."
"Pretty good beer but a bit too much hop flavor for the style in my opinion. It's a good session beer for people that love a ton of hops but are looking for something lighter to drink a lot of."
"Overall Impression: I'm glad this beer finally arrived in Indiana. I really enjoy how easy it it is to drink while still maintaining the complexity and uniqueness of a Stone brew. However, I do admit that the lingering hop bitterness is getting a bit tiresome as I finish the pint. It's a good brew, but not in the realm of a ""light"" session pale ale like Pride and Joy."
"This beer poured copper with a two-finger head. The smell is mostly hops with some grassiness and floral character. The taste starts off with some sweet bready malt that gives way to some citrusy and piney hops with a pretty decent balance. The mouthfeel is a little watery with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a reasonably complex beer that happens to be quite a bit less daunting than some of Stone's other offerings. I good one to try if you don't want something that will consume your whole night."
"This one packs a lot of flavor yet somehow is very light and drinkable. Well done."
"The one word I'd use to describe Stone's Levitation: Impressive. An impressive amount of flavor in an ale with only 4.4% ABV. Yes, after tasting this the first time I couldn't believe it's only 4.4%! Nice nose and aroma, excllent taste with undercurrents of nut and slight fruit. Now, not a flavor powerhouse, just not possible with a low ABV, but for what you get, and don't get, with Levitation, this one is a definite keeper. The one to have when you want the taste but not the alcohol."
"Very drinkable, well-balanced. Finishes well. No problem enjoying an entire 6 pack with ease."
"d: Super easy going down due to the low ABV (or at least low by Stone standards)."
"EDIT: I'll admit, I tweaked the numbers. Upon a post-review looking at scores I've given recently, I realized that my review for this beer placed it well above a beer I liked as much if not better. The numbers reflect my thinking, while previous numbers were more good-beer mainstays that I am trying to shy away from."
"D- This is a very sessionable beer which is what Stone was going for. Not bad but nothing that I would seek out on a regular basis. Good beer to drink with friends who aren't into the craft beer scene."
"D- overall a very nice beer, average in some ways, but above average in some others, for instance drinkability. the extra 1 or 2% alcohol this baby lacks is made up for by the fact that you can actually have a session with some delicious hoppy beer without gettin shitfaced... as quickly. put it in the pub!"
"Nice to have another tasty low abv option. This one from Stone is just the ticket for an afternoon beer when you've still got something to do. Pours reddish dark amber with a slight head. Smells dry, light, and spicy with hops. Clean and pine scented with very little malt sweetness. Almost austere. The taste is similar. Quite light and clean and surprisingly bitter and dry. Lean and quenching with an herbal, piney finish. Nice."
"D- Very, very drinkable due to low alcohol content and nothing overwhelming to the palate."
"Good entry-level beer for Stone."
"Another solid offering from Stone. One of my favorite amber ales."
"This one went down really easy. The bitterness was something that caught me off guard, but as you start to get thru the pint, you realize it is nothing to get hung up on. I'm not doing backflips about this one, but I did really enjoy it. Glad it is available out here in 6-ers -- I might stock a couple."
"Thanks for Reading"
"There's not much I can say about this beer that hasn't been said. I used to drink this all the time, haven't had it on 5 plus years, now I remember why stone rules and this beer kicks ass. Just a good red ale, with a solid hop taste and smell. Makes you burp hops. Good on ya Stone."
"Drinkability: Does this mean it's also lower calorie since it's only 4.4%? If so, that's a bonus, because I would've easily said, without knowing, that this was in the 6% range. I imagine I'll be drinking more of these this summer. It'd probably go great with some barbeque also. Stone continues to brew great stuff. Not that that surprises me."
"Nicely drinkable. Not a bad beer, but didn't live up to what I had hoped."
"Overall this is a very sessionable beer from the boys at Stone. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: A good, drinkable, amber ale."
"This is a very drinkable amber and they certainly crammed plenty of hops into a fairly light beer. Very good."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"The aroma and flavor to this one are very nice but very much muted compared to Stone's usual. This is simply a pure brew and as natural as it gets. With its low ABV, it makes a great session beer."
"Without a doubt, the most full-flavored, complex ale I have had at only 4.4 ABV. There is no watery flavor here. I now understand the name of the ale: as the back label states, an ale with this complexity does defy gravity."
"D=Easy to drink, lighter alcohol heightens drinkability."
"A little to sweet to knock back many..."
"This is by far my favorite of the Stone selection. I get the taste without feeling like I am trying to prove something. I am writing a paper for college and thought I would start with a review to help get the neurons firing. This ale poored smooth with a thick, foamy head of about an inch and a half that never fully disapated, but melted down to a skim on top. The colour is an amber tone. The smell is very nice, not to over the top. The taste is the same, rolling over the toungue with out to much bitterness, but hitting the back of the throat with a bite, there is a definate earthy taste that I have come to appreciate from all of Stone's selections. I rated the drinkability of this beer as high because for the amount of taste you get out of this beer it's not filling. I recomend this ale."
"D: If you like the flavor you'd probably down many, but unfortunately I don't."
"Drinkability- Lots of hops and flavor overall. Well-balanced, focused and clean. Highly drinkable."
"Color is a very rich red/amber. When poured out, has a nice foamy head that stick around for a while. Decent lacing as well, drips down fairly quickly. Some moderate carbonation visible. This beer also has a great citrus/grain smell to it. The guy below me made an excellent observation of a grapefruit taste. Not my favorite Stone brew but great to have for a meal or just hanging around."
"Drinkability: Very high. Great taste and low ABV make a good combo, and it's really good with just about any kind of food."
"D- I couldn't imagine a better beer after a day of snowboarding. It's crisp and refreshing, but still complex enough that it's not boring. I wish I could find this back home, it would be a great golfing/summer beer too."
"Woo Hoo! I found a Stone beer I like!"
"D: I never thought I'd criticize a beer for being over-hopped but the lack of balance between the flavor and bittering hops hurts this one despite the low ABV."
"Overall a good representation of a style that is not my favourite. Try it, you'll probably like it."
"Leaves a very nice aftertaste and it's just so chewy. It's nice to see another beer from Stone that doesn't blow you out of the water."
"D- Overall a solid beer that may lack just slighly in complexity. Packed full of flavor, and easily my favorite ""light"" beer."
"Levitation Ale is very good beer. It has Stone written all over it. It's not quite the stunner that some of their beer is. But, for a 4.4% beer, it has a good flavor and a ton of character. I think it needs a little more of something to improve the flavor a little. Perhaps a little more of a sweet flavor. All in all though, it's pretty impressive. Easily recommended. I'm pleased to finally see the bottles in Ohio. But, I recall liking this on draft a little better."
"Notes: Levitation Ale is a straight-forward, full-flavored, well-hopped amber ale that left me satisfied. Nothing special here, just a very good session beer that I would love to drink all night. Another winner for Stone Brewing!"
"This isn't my favorite brew, but it isn't bad by any means, just could have been better balanced and more drinkable especially considering the style. I felt it was over hopped and did not allow me to taste the other complexities in the beer. I would have an IPA if I wanted a hoppy brew, Stones own IPA is quite a bit better than this one anyway."
"Future outlook: A very decent, flavorful, low ABV brew that would be a great alternative to pounding BMC on a night of mindless drinking (not that I have many of these anymore!). I could see getting this again for just such an occasion...."
"Exceedingly drinkable. A session beer for the hop lover. Big hop flavor and bitterness and low alcohol. This is a hoppier if not the hoppiest version of an amber/red. I find it wonderfully easy to drink and thoroughly enjoyable."
"D- light and clean but the bitter finish hurts the refeshing quality"
"D - even though I didn't enjoy this beer. I'd drink it as a session beer to replace those foul tasting macros. It was pretty easy drinking and though the flavor wasn't that off-putting, it got low marks because it did not seem like an Amber Ale at all. It seemed more like a Stone attempt at a macro style beer. The only possible way that this beer got a Gold at the Great American Beer Festival would be if no other beers entered in its category. Stones beer continue to disappoint me."
"This is a great everyday drinker. I can't say that I'm not a little shocked to see this from Stone, but way to go. Finally a session beer from these guys!!"
"Not my cup o tea. Light beer feel with super strong hop flavors."
"Overall, a bit disappointing if you are expecting the usual Stone bitch-slap to the taste buds, but certainly easy to drink and sessionable at 4.4abv"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a fairly light body. The pine tar nature of the hops makes the flavors stick in my mouth and makes the beer seem bigger. This is a very easy beer to drink. I could see tacking some of these into a series of sessionable beers."
"Drinkability: Kind of mediocre when it comes to Stone, but overall it isn't a bad beer. I probably won't go out of my way to get this in the future, but I really don't mind drinking it. The low ABV would easily allow for a fair amount to be consumed in a sitting, so easily sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 4/9/09. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with a half-inch off-white head. Lacing and head retention are both average. It smells like piney and grassy hops, along with a little bit of malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, pine and grassy hops with a bit of malt. There's also a nice lingering hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit oily and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, I think it's a decent choice as a session beer. I didn't know what to think of this beer at first, a Stone beer at just 4.4% ABV? The flavor is good and it's easy to drink, so that's definitely a good thing. But for the price I don't think I'm getting my money's worth. With that being said, I definitely wouldn't turn one of these down but I don't think I would buy it very often."
"I was going to save my hoppy beer for the finale tonight - guess it sneaked on me early. Clearly Stone is a good go to for delivery of the ol' Alpha acid, but I have to say if I would want it in every beer I would always order a ruination."
"D- Has a good amount of bold flavours even with the lower ABV. Very easy to drink."
"Good session brew."
"Drinkability - actually, this is a little *too* flavorful for extended sessioning in my book, but a fantastic option after some extended sampling, when you want something that can hold its own taste-wise after some prior potent/bigger brews. Toasted on Inauguration Day, 1/20/09. Congrats to President Obama and his cabinet!"
"Pours deep russet, quite clear, with an off-white two finger head. The smell is pine, moss, and toffee. The taste is eucalyptus, leatherwood honey, smoke, and tangelo -- very complex, with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is excellent, finely carbonated but robust, with a medium body. It's powerful for such low-alcohol beer, but the drinking is rich, full, and easy."
"I am loving the low ABV on this beer, but the price tag ($9.49 per six-pack) is a deterrent for me. It's like a solid IPA in the beginning and end feeling like an Amstel Light. Strange, but drinkable."
"This smooth easier drinking Stone could be the most sessional hoppy beer I've tried. Though I don't know if I'd session a hoppy beer, but if I'm ever in the mood this would be a treat. All in all great beer that just misses being exceptional."
"Notes: Not one of the most complex or full flavored beers from Stone, but certainly one of my favorites. The taste packed into this 4.4% brew is what really sells it. Very drinkable, it is the quintessential session brew in my book."
"Pours a pretty clear, reddish-brown colored body with a off-white light brown soapy head, small but lasting. Citrusy aroma, hoppy, dusty, malty maybe some hoppiness. Watery palate, dusty, hoppy taste. Light on the harsh carbonated taste."
"Just like Sam Adams Boston Lager and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, this beer shows the brilliance of the craft beer movement. A crisp, flavorful and versatile session beer. I would love to see this become their flagship session beer and available nationally."
"Fans of the style will enjoy this but I don't find it particularly accessible."
"Tap @ the Stone Beer Garden. They offer this from time to time. Pours dark brown with a short off-white head. Drier malt aroma but now with the chinooks. Toasted hop flavor (new) that gives it an ashy/dry flavor. Biscuity malt/hop mix. Dry, clean finish."
"Overall - A decent enough Amber ale - not something i'd rush back to but certainly worth a try..."
"D: I really like this beer for a ""buy a sixer on the way home"" beer! Im very glad I bought this single!"
"recommended"
"I could drink a lot of these, but honestly prefer the other offerings from Stone, such as their Arrogant Bastard and Smoked Porter. The Levitation ale, however, is a good session beer if you want good flavor without the high alcohol found in Stone's other brews."
"And since this was tasted from the OBF sample mug, further research is required."
"D - Fantastic drinkability here which is exactly what this beer was designed for. Plenty of flavor and only 4.4$ abv. This beer is different from anything else I've ever had but it is good."
"D-Being 4.4% I have to give this brew some props. I am a sucker for low ABV beers that pack in flavour. To me that is what beer is about flavour...not ABV. If you are looking for AB light so you can kick more than a few back during an evening look no more! Feel the quaffable lightness of Levitation Holmes!"
"Bottle bought in Grand Junction Colorado at College Liquors. Pours a deep amber color with a small white head. A nice aggressive aroma of rich bitter hops and caramel malts. The taste is quite nice; smooth and rich caramel malts, a nice hoppy flavor, lightly bitter. Some biscuit and grapefruit flavors also. Very quaffable and nice."
"Golden yellow color with a small frothy head. Slight floral smell would soon reveal itself in a subdued sharp floral hoppiness. Some carbonation gives it crispness. Have to imagine this is a toned down version of an over hopped stone offering. It works well as a warm up, session beer, or beer that goes with just about any food. But a bit thin to be a standout brew."
"5 5 09 Addendum: Had on tap again earlier tonight into a Stone Levitation silver rimmed glass (the glass of the month at Winking Lizard in Mentor, Ohio). I am updating my rating of the appearance to a 5.0 since it cannot be improved upon. It has a great looking body and the coolest lacing of like a sugary coating). I previously had it at 4.0. I am upgrading my 3.5 for smell to a 4.5 for the balanced complexity of the nose of this beer. It smells inviting and interesting. I am upgrading the taste from a 4.0 to a 4.5 since this is a really nicely balanced beer with a hops kick, not the hops centric beer that it sounds like I describe above. I am upgrading the mouthfeel from 3.0 to 4.0 since this is a big, almost sugary balanced beer with plenty going on to keep my interest. Drinkability is at least a 4.0 (up from a 3.5) due to low ABV and an interesting profile, complex tastes. Notes: Great beer from Stone, might be my favorite!"
"Huge drinkability here. The 4.4 ABV makes this one of the best tasting lower ABV brews I've had in a long time. Huge props to Stone for making a great session brew. Cheers!"
"Overall a really nice beer. A ton of flavor for a sixer, and one of the more approachable Stone offerings. That being said, I miss the increased abv and the accompanying flavor. This is a nice beer, but a little more oomph and it could be a classic. But I guess that would make it a whole other beer."
"I've always been a huge fan of stone beer and I've desperately wanted to try this as they don't send it to kentucky or anywhere out east. After trying this I must say this beer NEEDS to make it out here. It may not be their best beer, but it is the craft drinkers light beer, only without that terrible stigma that the macros have created. Now just don't tell Greg I said it. He already chewed me out for it twice :)"
"The beer poured a deep reddish-amber with a thin, white head into a pint glass. The aroma was of fresh, piney hops - reminiscent of a Sierra Nevada IPA. The taste had loads of hop bitterness, surprising for such a light ABV beer (by Stone's standards, anyway), which was fine for a hop-head like myself. There was also malt sweetness, of course, but the hop profile really stands out, and lasted long after the last swallow - very nice."
"I was a little disappointed by this one. In the Levitation's defense, it's a really good beer by itself. I however was expecting something different. To me it tasted like a toned down version of Bastard. Not a bad thing if that's what you want but like I said, I was hoping for something unique."
"D - Extremely sessionable."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: More bitter than the typical amber, but I like it. Flavor is pretty complex yet not overpowering. Looking forward to the rest of the six pack."
"Not one of my favorite Stone offerings, although clearly a good beer. If I'm going to get a strong beer flavor like this then I want the accompanying head change. Just greedy I guess."
"After a great Amber from Bear Republic I had to try another and thought to try my favorite brewery, Stone. This is new to Vegas and I was excited to try. Pours a clear amber with an off-white, creamy head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is good. Some caramel but a nice hops presence as well. Taste is on par with the smell. Although there's not a much malt as I'd expect from this style it was still great. Nice caramel malt backbone with a good hops kick at the end. Overall I think this could pass in most circles as a Pale Ale or English IPA. Nice light body to it as well, not too light though. Overall very drinkable. The low ABV and smooth taste makes this a great session beer."
"Definitely sessionable...has the Stone signature on it so will be more drinkable than most in the style."
"Super drinkable. Great session beer. I drank half the 6 pack last night while tailgating on location at the Chargers vs. Cowboys game. Highly recommended. Great Stone intro beer."
"O: Stone doesn't make a bad beer. However, this one is definitely on the mild side of Stone brews. Still a great beer though. Very easy to drink, and with the reasonable alcohol content, easy to pound back a few."
"Recieved this in a trade and this is by far the best Amber Ale I have had to date. Others that I have tried left me wanting. This beer comes through with a nice beginning, middle and end. Strong enough to let its presence know but also smooth enough to not have any one taste command the whole thing."
"Drinkability: Decent, but in my opinion a little one-dimensional. Maybe I'm being unfair, as it's not really my style. Still, definitely worth a try - one of Stone's most award-winning beers, if I'm not mistaken."
"this one is good, its not as strong as its cousans, arregant basterd or ruinnation ipa but it holdes its own, it is nice to have this amber bitter brew, this one is for ""everyday"" consumption with out having to worry about the abv. this is a beautifull blance form start to finish with the hop blast that i expext from stone at the end. get this one and you wont be dissapointed."
"D: Drinkability increases as the ale warms. Take time to sip and you'll be rewarded for your patience."
"well recommended especially for the hot summer months, this brew chilled would be a very refreshing treat during the day."
"I've not been much of a fan of Stone's ""Big"" beers. Their large alcohol presence and sweetness tend to be just too much for my tastes, however this was an enjoyable brew."
"D: Very good especially for a lower abv beer."
"D-Very good. A nice complex beer that you can drink in reasonable quantity."
"D- I think that I have known about this beer for a longtime, but have just overlooked it. Interestingly enough, this isn't Stone's usual aggressive beer. This is a very sessionable beer. My next growler will be this guy."
"Thanks to David H. for bringing this beer back from the brewery. I have longly anticipated this brew. It comes as a surprise to me what I'm about to experience. This increadible beer begins with a deep amber / nearly brown hue with creamy off-white head formation, retains very well, and leaves lacing all over the place. Modest carbonation gives the beer a cask ale-like demeanor. Sharp aromas of pine and citrus hops promises agression, while very light notes of nuts, toast, and cocoa tells me that the beer isn't only hops. The taste of the hops hit up front with a juicy burst citurs, then pine. After the hops die down a bit, the dry toast, chesnut, and light cocoa powder flavors come in. Interestingly, there are no real sweetness to this beer- it has fully attenuated so that only the dry malt, hops, and fermentation character shows. The mouthfeel is both creamy and dry, making it very drinkable, albeit bitter. Finishes with a crisp bitterness- part from hops, but part from toast and nuttiness. This beer has a lot of character for a 4.4% sessionable, bone-dry beer. A pleasure to drink, but a bit of sweetness would have scored it higher."
"Looks impressive, a nice, dark amber almost ruby color. Smells mostly of hops, with some fruity citrus notes. Taste was very good, much like the aroma, mostly hops with some orangy citrus flavor. Nice bitter finish. I like to have a 6 pack of this in the fridge most of the time. One of my everyday beers. I like it a lot."
"T + M + D: A similar profile to the aroma. Grapefruit flavours in the hops, with a touch of pine or spruce. A soft malt backbone provides a nice rounding to the overall body and flavour. A lighter, more accessable flavour and feeling that makes this a very approachable, easy to drink, friendly beer. At a tame 4.4%, it would certainly be a session candidate."
"Slightly watery mouthfeel with good solid carbonation. Overall a very attractive and drinkable Amber."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and clean but rather watery due to the aforementioned lack of a solid maltiness. Very easy to drink and a nice sessionable option from Stone."
"Wow, I forgot how interesting this beer is. There are some really odd, but pleasant herbal garden hops notes with the citrus that remind me of Surly's Bitter Brewer (again). Of course, the malt is a significantly darker here, adding a light roasty finish in with the juicy hops. Heck of a beer."
"Sweet malty fruity backing with a assertive hip of the citrus the nose has shown. Mouth is oddly thin and hurts things. A very nice easy drinking amber ale with a great resiny refreshing hop approach."
"Poured a dark amber with a light tan head. The head looks like it will never go away. It leaves thick laces. It smells like citrus, and maybe flowers. It smelled hoppy., but not too over the top. It tastes slightly malty. It has a spicy floral taste. It is lightly carbonated. It is smooth. The taste lingers im my mouth. This beer can go all night long. Chewy, It is very low in alcohol content, so you could drink quite a few of them but the ABV tasted more than it was, perhaps because it was so full bodied. It is a little too hoppy for my. Not an amber fan but this was pretty dam good."
"A nice beer for sure, but it could use a tad more residual sweetness. It was worth seeking out this one time, but I'd probably go for Stone's other offerings on a regular basis."
"-Kevin."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a deep transluscent maroon with a light beige head. Smell is big sweet maltiness equally matched however by a nice blast of fresh fruity hoppiness. Similar smell to a nice IPA. Very nicely balanced sweet caramel and hop flavor for an amber. Nice rich body, great flavor, and well hopped for an amber. Very good, very drinkable, and recommended for sure, even for non amber fans."
"Medium body, smooth carbonation. Very easy to drink. As close to a session beer as you will get from Stone I guess. Pretty nice."
"Overall impression: A balanced, sessionable American ale. Seems tame for a West Coast amber. However, this is highly poundable. Inspires me to try to clone an interesting quaffer like this. Recommended."
"Initial burst of malty, floral and hoppy aroma that became more subtle after a few seconds and included hints of caramel and vanilla. Clear, amber/brown color with frothy tan head that dissipated into a minimal head fairly quickly. Malty, roasted flavors with some floral hop character and slight caramel. With each sip, there was a powerful spike of bitterness that only lasted a second and settled into a pretty well balanced flavor. Medium carbonation. Medium-bodied."
"D - flavor gets a little bit fatiguing, but I could polish a sixer easy."
"Nice for such a low ABV beer. Aromas of flowers, pine, malt and honey. Pours with a very small head that goes. Initial flavor is of honey and sweetened tea, followed by malt and pine. Does taste a bit watered down. Medium but watery textured body with soft carbonation. Very nice for something that can legally (in the U.S.) be called a beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin with some bitter and toasty aftertaste but then again this is meant to be a session beer so one should not expect a big and heavy mouthfeel. Goes down very smooth and leaves a slight dryness on the palate which makes you want to take another sip. A very decent session beer."
"D: If you like hops, but aren't quite in the mood for an IPA, this is your beer. If you don't like hoppy beers, look elsewhere. I found this quite drinkable and would buy it again."
"Enjoyed courtesy of Barefootbrewer. Poured a nice dark amber/copper color with nice white head that lasted quite a while. Aroma is of citrus hops. Flavor is also of citrus hops with a bit of maltiness coming through. This is a nice sessionable amber ale with a high degree of drinkability. Mouth feel was good and lacing on glass was light."
"Overall: Nice hoppy brew that is so easy drinking. I love stone and if I could get this one by the sixer, I would pound em down all summer long. I'm beginning to believe Stone don't make a single bad beer."
"M/D: A light, semi-watered down body. Carbonation is a little high. Drinkability is pretty good on this one as it is low ABV, pretty tasty and easy to go down. This amber ale really showcases the hops. Not in a IPA way, but they are here in numbers. I would have liked a little more maltiness, but it is not bad."
"Another great beer from Stone!"
"Smell is nice.. Hops and evergreen - a touch of malts. Taste is of hops as well. Nice hints of citrus. Finishes quite well. Very smooth. Pretty nice brew. I want another."
"A good beer, but not my favorite from Stone. Somewhat raw."
"Root Beer brown in color with a quarter inch beige head. A rich smell of hops with hints of a sweet malty aroma. Definately can not mistaken the hops in this beer. A smooth finish compared to the initial hit of hops on the palate. A very drinkable beer that comes with the usual quality that Stone puts into their beers. I also find that I sit and end up concentrating more on the beer than writing my comments."
"EDIT: Finished the glass with some cheap chocolate chip cookies. The chocolate was a good pairing with the bitterness and the sugar made the dryness more enjoyable."
"Thanks to mmmmBEEEER for sharing a bottle. This beer pours a deep amber color with a medium foamy off-white head that recedes rather quickly. Small patches of lacing. Piney hops along with caramel and malt in the nose. Medium-bodied with hops, toasted malt and grapefruit flavors. The finish is balanced between citrusy hops and sweet malt, leaving a roasted malt aftertaste. Interesting take on an Amber Ale, leave it to Stone to put a spin on it like this. Overall its not necessarily something I would try again but its a decent session beer."
"D: This could be a session if one remembered to eat to make sure the taste buds are intact."
"Sidenote: Roxy Rolles from Magic Hat is a much better example of a hoppy amber ale. I think it'd be interesting to trade some Roxy Rolles to a west coaster that really likes this brew and see what they think."
"D - Outstanding! The ridiculously dry finish could be a bit taxing for a long session, but I could definitely drink two or three of these with some tangy ribs or spicy brats. This is a brew that is drinkable and can also stand up to some really spicy food. This is hoppier than many IPAs, yet it's listed as a red ale?"
"Poured a nice rich carmal color with about an inch of creamy head. It has a nice aroma of hops. Honestly I think its a little off balance. The beer is really hoppy but (I think) needs more of a malt backbone to balance the beer. The bitterness is a little much but it does not affect its drinkability."
"This beer poured a clear deep brown/amber color with a nice cream colored head. The aroma is initially of fresh hops followed by a sweet caramel smell. The taste is bitter (but not overbearing) from the hops. It is definitely full of flavor, but I would prefer a little more sweetness for balance. The mouthfeel is a bit more than medium bodied and seems quite appropriate for this brew. Overall, Im enjoying drinking this beer, but the bitterness needs could use a little more malt backbone."
"Want to try this on tap soon"
"Drinkability: This has to be the premier American session beer. It manages to be low abv and super drinkable without sacrificing hop bitterness or a solid malt backbone. Good work Stone. Thanks for not pussyfooting around with this style like so many other breweries have."
"D - Taste is decent and full, but not excellent. This is one I would probably resist buying again. It is just not as intense as most of their portfolio. It is a tasty ale, though and very drinkable, definitely sessionable, just not my taste I guess. This went well w/ my teriyaki salmon."
"ah...an amber that smells, tastes, and looks like an IPA. This basically is an IPA with lower ABV and a bit less body. Instead of a Stone IPA with citrusy aromas and flavors and and golden color, this is more like HopDevil or something of that sort. Great deep amber color, nice snappy head. Stinky hop aroma, sharp bitter hop bite, good mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability. A bit rougher than the Stone IPA, like a brasher and more unpredictable younger brother. High IBU's with low ABV makes this a hophead's session ale."
"I had not been able to purchase this one form stone before, what a shame. There was a great color and body to this brew, lighter brownish red, with aromas of caramel malts, some unripe fruits and extremely clean hops- I love stone's hops- theyre very unique among all of the other hop-bomb breweries. Flavor was light and subtle- raw leaf hops, citrus and piney, so fresh I feel like im eating them straight off the plant. There is some malt there to balance everything out, but it definitely plays second to the hops. Very reminiscent of their stronger brews, but this one leaves your taste buds intact and with a lower ABV you can drink more than a couple- ill be purchasing this one as go-to from now on."
"Mouthfeel is a tad thin with good carbonation. Oily slick coats my tongue. Easy to drink brew, but I don't feel that this one measures up to the Stone offerings. Maybe this is intended to be their ""gateway"" beer...and if it is I can understand. Overall, not a bad beer and I wouldn't turn one down."
"This might not be the kind of Xtreme beer that most people would award a high score to, but it is so amazingly crafted that I have no choice but it give it a great grade."
"For the chance for my BA annv. ! BA members are top notch!"
"The hops come screaming through til late in the game, finish is bitter but smooth, and dry. Body has good thickness, even chewy, with a slickness from the alpha oil hops. Damn good American Red that brings enough hops to keep it lively."
"Drinkability: This is Stone's most sessionable brew. Easily one of the most drinkable and sessionable beers I've had, and probably the most overlooked and underrated beer in the Stone repertoire."
"Pours a clear brown/red, small off white head forms, some lace on the glass, settles to a very thin ring. Smell is sweet, perfumy, some floral, light pine, not bad considering the alcohol. Taste is sweet, light honey, some pine, toast, floral, pine, very light finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Smooth, okay, maybe expecting more from a Stone beer, but its decent for a mild."
"The taste on first sip is kind of strange. The initial flavour is rather empty of flavour, kind of watery but then, thankfully, the grapefruit hoppy goodness moves in near and through the finish though it's at a subdued level. Hey, this is only 4.4%abv so I expected some kind of reduction in what was going to hit my taste buds and it sure makes this Ale a good for sessioning candidate *if* the flavour that's there is enough to please. Imho, it passes that test. I'd buy it again."
"D: Low in alcohol makes this a good session beer choice, but I found myself really not wanting more than one, a beer I'll have to revisit at some point though."
"Thanks Boutip for studying what I have not had, in our sixth trade.Citrus, and 4.4% sessioanbilty appreciated so that I could have a follow on beer."
"This one poured a reddish amber colour, pretty clear, with a light beige head. Good head retention with some clumpy lacing. There was a pleasant caramel aroma that balanced the hops, which were a bit fruity, but mostly herbal, grassy, and woody. Solid bitterness with an herbal, minty hop flavour. Toasty malt gave a light sweetness and there was some fruitiness in the background as well. Nice balance. Medium/light body and carbonation, quite refreshing. I could see this making a great session beer. It's got a nice flavour profile that's not overpowering, but is still interesting enough for a few pints."
"I'll start by saying that I am a fan of Stone. Not this Stone. Wonderfully striking in the glass. Nice dark brown that lets the light dance through, topped with a pale yellow head that outlasted the beer. Bravo. Then everything else. Smell was soft and hop forward with metal, citrus, and almost the smell of wet dirt (just before it becomes mud). Mouthfeel was ok, dry and lackluster. Taste was somewhat of a mouthfull. Blast of hops on the tongue mellowed slightly by caramel, stale bread, and citrus. Pretty bitter ending, not hops bitter ... (you ever spray stuff with ""bitter yuck"" you know to keep a dog or cat from biting it?) yeah .. weird bitter. Anyway ... ok beer. I wouldn't seek this one out."
"Bottle courtesy of Naven: Poured a deep amber color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of light piney hops with some caramel malt. Taste is somewhat hoppy with some light caramel malt notes also noticeable. Body is fuller then average with some medium carbonation. I understand that the brewer wanted to have a session beer with limited alcohol but there also too much limited taste  not something I thought I was going to be saying about Stone someday."
"Flavor is some caramel and citrusy hops that finish with a crisp bite. Very easy to drink. Seems almost like a mild ale not a red ale. Easy session beer. Wouldnt mind having a few of these in a sitting."
"This is not a beer for me. Disappointed, as I am an avid Stone fan and this being my first opportunity with the Levitation Ale. While the prose was sweet as ever, the brew itself was exceedingly oppressive, strongly hopped -- I would hands down prefer Ruination to Levitation when it comes to high hops from Stone. A pleasingly aesthetic amber red in a glass, this one just didn't have it in flavor to warrant another buy from me anytime soon."
"well, never had an amber ale like this! certainly punches above its weight, and does it well. more hops in this 12oz bottle than most cases of bmc."
"This beer is the worst in Stone's otherwise excellent lineup, which is unfortunate because those who try this beer first may get the wrong impression of this fine craft brewery. It looks right, and the smell is there with some piney, earthy notes, but this beer falls flat on its face when it comes to taste. Frankly, the taste is insipid at best. There's just nothing there except water and metal and lot's of carbonation. Maybe it's the low alcohol, but this beer has no character whatsoever, and is nothing to write home about."
"After awhile, all of Stone's ale taste about the same. This one was no different. Poured a medium dark brown with some white foam. The smell of Piney hops was all I could get out of the aroma. As far as the taste, it was average with the tart piney flavor of the hops and that was about it. Not impressed, just average at best."
"ASS-HOLE!"
"This has got to be my favorite ""session"" beer and it is perfect for poker night. It is orange in color with a decent head. It smells hoppy and grassy. The taste is grassy and delicious. I can't believe it has this much flavor for such a low ABV beer. It also tastes a little like Bastard."
"Many thanks to mymrngjckt for throwing this beer in as an extra from our recent trade."
"It pours dark red into a chalice. The head that froms sits on top of the beer the whoe way through. The smell is crisp and sweet, with caramel, hoppy, and vanilla flavors rising from it. In the taste, it's bready, mostly with a hoppy taste goes from start to finish. A hint of sugar cookies sneaks into play towards the end. Not much of an aftertaste. This beer goes down nice, easy, and creamy. This beer's a little deeper in flavor than what I expected from a 4.4 ABV beer."
"D: Easy enough to drink if you can stand the bitterness. It's not a good hop-bitterness, it's just plain bitter. I normally like Ambers, but I will NOT buy this again. Wayyy overrated."
"Stone makes some incredible brews, but I am beginning to think Amber Ale might be one of the most challenging types to make really well. This poured a dark amber with a fat, slightly off-white head that left sticky-looking lacing in rings around the glass. Nose of malts, hops, citrus, flowers, and something else I cannot quite get to. The hops dominate and so you have to look for everything else. Mouthfeel is very smooth and better than most ambers. Flavor is of malts, caramels, and of course hops. Finishes smooth . At only 4.4 % you could knock back a few of these in an evening, and enjoy every bottle. Interesting and well done."
"The gargoyle brings forth session fare, and it works. Appearance is a rusty amber with considerable transparency. Smell is very potent for a beer of diminished gravity. Great blend of caramel & coffee malts. The taste follows suit, bringing forth a predictable dose of hoppage, and leaving a slightly unfortunate aftertaste of cold coffee. The mouthfeel is thin for obvious reasons, but I still really dig this beer. The complexity they managed to squeeze out of a beer with 4.4% abv is pretty astonishing. They could rename this beer Unassuming Co-Dependent Bastard. Or maybe The Bastard Who Loved Me.... Accomodating Bastard? The Kinder, Gentler Bastard? I'll stop this now, and I apologize."
"Very tasteful, good hop and malt balance. A little watery for a stone but no doubt enjoyable. Reminds me of a lite Arrogant Bastard, kinda sorta. Good beer for any occasion just make sure you have enough sixers."
"This beer poured a cloudy red and there was a fair head. The smell is wonderfull. Hops, brown sugar, maple syrup. Mmm. The taste is smooth with just a little bit of a watery finish. Bitter, this seems to flirt with pale ale. The mouthfeel is smooth and drinkbility inviting. As a lower abv brew, several of these could be consumed easily. This is the shy nephew of an arrogant uncle."
"D: The closest that I've seen to a session ale from Stone. The malts are strong and well-represented, taking control of the ale from start to finish."
"As usual, Stone goes for an over-the-top beer, rather than an interesting beer. I'd rather get their pale ale and skip the malts here that are a bit too sweet. (This almost seems like their pale ale with malts dumped in.) It's not a bad beer, but I can't think of a good reason to get this again."
"Drinkability - A somewhat disappointing beer from Stone. Not at all undrinkable, but it lacks a lot of complexity in the taste. The smell seems to promise a lot that just isn't followed up once it is drunk. Decent, but probably won't be having this one again."
"This ale pours a nice rich amber brown with a nice off-white head with good head retention and lacing. The smell is rich in malts, grains and hops. A bit earthy and tree-like. The taste has some nice caramel qualities to it, with a bit of a piney bite and a dry finish. Very tasty and it drinks quite soothly. Rather drinkable and easy to down a six-pack with friends."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Not bad, not great. Most people will like it as long as they don't have some bizaar averdsion to hops."
"D: Not bad and frankly unique enough to seperate itself from the pack. The grainy aftertaste doesn't do it for me though, never does."
"Very good. Reminiscent of an IPA, but a little darker, really nice deep orange color. The nose was great, fairly hoppy. Had some citrus to it and the usual floral aroma. Great ale from Stone and they made it stand out much more than other amber ales. Mos def give it a try."
"Many thanks to Marvz and boolshot from the Double Trouble BIF."
"D: Tasty, easy-drinking, not filling, this one is a good basic beer. I found this beer to be good for its simplicity. Stone knows how to knock you over with their big beers, but with this one they show that they know how to give you something easy. It’s yet another excellent beer from Stone."
"The beer pours an opaque reddish-brown. Expected something a little clearer, maybe this was dry hopped? Head isn't that big and fades very quickly. The smell is pretty pungent for an amber ale, with resiny hops. Duh, this is Stone. It's a pretty good hopped up amber ale... hops still dominate the added maltiness. Carbonation and body are medium. Tasty and easy to drink for sure."
"Another winner from Stone. They can do no wrong. Pours a nice bronze color with some distinct red tones. Head cascades up to a nice level even with a soft pour. It drops to leave rings of lacing that mark your way down the glass. Smell is typical Stone west coast hops and ohhhh so good. Citrus and nice piney notes. Taste kicks in with a nice caramel malt balance. The malt becomes more and more prominant as you drink more of this one but the hops never goes away. Taste becomes bready and earthy. Mouthfeel has a perfect carbonation level. Beer finishes with a light bitter aftertaste. Overall a very nice beer. Of the Stone I've had only the IPA is comparable as an every day drinker. With the low ABV this is my new choice for drinking more than a couple in a night."
"The body has a mid feel, but personally I feel is light for style. Not bad, but there is some chalkiness at the tail end as the beer warms which is more of a deterrent. The beer is very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Even with the bad ""sea monster"" pun."
"Slainte!"
"A super session beer. Leave it to Stone to fit such a big taste into such a light (body & ABV) beer. If this was available in MD, it would be in my fridge all the time. My only knock on this is the appearance, I just don't like the look of the floating sediment."
"Drinkability: It's odd, because this beer only has 4.4% abv. It sort of doesn't surprise me because the alcohol presence isn't very strong, but the beer still has some oomph. It's simply arrogant bastard without as much balls. Around 45-50 ibus i'm guessing. Did they just water down arrogant bastard and sell it as levitation?"
"drinkability: this one is quaffer for sure. A very quality beverage. Nice on an Autumn afternoon."
"D- a very drinkable beer,goes down nice and easily, got this one in a mixed 6-pack and i'm wishing i had another, lowest abv on any stone, nice to know stone can make a nice session beer, almost like an Arrogant Bastard Light, if there ever could be such a thing"
"The head is a white yellowish color and it has a good stickyness to it. The head is still half the way up my glass and the beer is all most gone. It has a nice hoppy taste to it with a rich malt flavor. The color is a lot dark amber then other amber beers I have drank and the mouthfeel is very light. It is a very drinkable beer and it is a good year around beer but it is not as complex as most other stone brews but very good and highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is a touch thin to me. It sticks to the cheeks well but is a touch watery. Decent carbonation though leads to a crisp edge. Good drinkability though. I'd recommend this to someone who was just getting into craft beers, for me though there are others out there on the same level."
"D- It's a very good beer. Goes down with ease and its a good job since I have a 2L growler ahead of me."
"Overall- an awesome session brew."
"The 4.4% makes this pretty drinkable, but for my taste, it's a bit one-dimensional to have very much."
"Stone deserves endless props for supercharging the craft beer industry these last few years, but I'm afraid they've fallen victim to their own devices. It seems they feel every beer they make, even the lighter ones need to be hopped to all hell. It's time for Stone to break their own mold."
"Thanks to Bennetj17 for the trade!"
"This is one of my favorite ""everyday"" beers. Great flavor, as drinkable as can be, very pretty. Perfect amber color, slightly thin, bubbly head. The aroma is not strong, but there is plenty of roasty, hoppy flavor. At 4.4% it could be a bit stronger. The taste is mostly up front, though the aftertaste is nice, too. Not a strong beer, but a very good, high quality beer."
"A coppery red ale that pours out fast and has a tan head that dissipates fast. A pleasant brew on the whole, that combines both bitter and sweet flavors. It'll never be one of my favorites, but it's a half-notch or so above the middle of the curve. I'll probably buy it again."
"Very drinkable and makes for a great year round session beer."
"Drinks quite well, I enjoy this as much as some of their hi powered ales. I think this a nice one to enjoy while listening to/watching a storm blowing off the rockies"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an expansive carbonation that engulfs the mouth and gives a nice creamy sensation. Easily drinkable, would make a nice session brew if I had access to it. Might serve as a nice crossover beer for those new to craft brew as well. Thanks to Callenak for the chance to sample this one."
"Nice dark bronze color, but the head looks weak... almost watery... Is this a sign that Stone has finally gone wrong, by producing a <5%ABV beer?? The smell, though, puts things to rights. Big American hops, but solid malt underneath. Very balanced taste. Hoppy, maybe this is to most amber/red ales what SNPA is to your standard pale ales. Personally, I tend to like beers that focus more on the malt side of the equation, but this is very nicely done. Solid mouthfeel, but light enough to give good drinkability."
"Fine Stone offering."
"Very crisp feel on the palate, and with a relatively low ABV and not nearly the bitterness of most of Stones beers, this one is definitely highly drinkable, but without the sacrifice of flavor. I've been drinking Stone for years, and can't believe I've never tried this brew before. It's not what I was expecting, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"Not as complex as Stones' other beers but still good. goes down nice on this hot summer day"
"It's got a medium body with a creamish mouthfeel and a very mild ABV that make this a very easy drinker for just about anyone. It is a very tame beer coming from Stone, but it's not yellow and fizzy, yet a wuss should be able to handle this one!!!"
"Very dark and rich color for an amber. There's not a ton of head on this but it makes a nice crown that keeps its presence throughout the duration of the glass. There's a much bigger presence of hops in the aroma then I expect from an amber. Aaah! So this is Stone! It's well-hopped to give it a serious character, but malty enough that even those who fear the IPA's should find this easy and enjoyable to drink. It is rich and flavorful and the beer itself seems to consciously be making the choice to linger on my tongue before moving on. I had high expectations for Stone, and I'm not disappointed. If this were available to me locally, it would probably be in my fridge at all times."
"Overall a different beer, not my favorite stone beer. Not a bad session beer, but I would have liked it to be a little more balanced. Worth a try if you are a stone fan."
"Crimson amber body, frothy head leaves lace etched to the glass as it goes down. Floral hops, citrus and sweet malt take the nose. I find the flavor profile to be somewhat deadened on the tongue initially; it seems as if the flavors meld together in the back end. Bready biscuity malts are the most prominent flavor, with a dusting of hops to balance the lemon tartness. Mouthfeel is right on for the style, mildly carbonated and very clean. Obviously a very sessionable brew, especially given its relatively low ABV. I could see this being a delight on cask, as the flavors seem to become more pronounced as it warms."
"Taste was smooth, sweet at first, then a good bite at the end leaving a crisp palate feeling. Little aftertaste, a bit filling. Definitely more of a pale ale in my opinion, nevertheless, it's very good."
"The flavor was very mild, pretty balanced hops/malt. Not a bad session beer if it was easier to find in Ohio. But very replaceable so it's not worth seeking out."
"Drinkability: This is not as refreshing or as flavorful as other American reds out there, but nevertheless, a sixer would make for a nice session."
"D- With that 4.4% abv this is a perfect session beer for hopheads. Though for for amber/red ale fans, this might not be up your alley. Some malt flavor might be nice."
"who knows.. it seems to be ultimately overlooked in favor of specialty/big beers."
"Rich amber hue, thin light head with decent retention, nice carbonation, slight haze. Medium hop aroma with a slight nuttiness. Notes of caramel and grape flavor from the malt also. Not particularly inviting. Taste begins with a mild sourness and bitterness with a caramel nut flavor coming through. Semi-sweet only. Light to medium body with solid carbonation. The drinkablility of this is average or so, I really am trying to grasp the amber/brown malt flavors but it's not that intriguing. A decent mild ale overall..."
"Bought this one at the brewery and it is fresh. It has great clarity, a tight tan head and a rich copper/amber hue. The aroma is well balanced, nutty & buttery with mellow hops. Definitely not the same hops as the Stone IPA or Arrogant Bastard. The mouthfeel is smooth from the diacetyl and has a little CO2 bite that detracts from the flavor. This beer does have great lacing, though.The flavor is balanced like the aroma and it finishes slightly nutty in the front and dry in the back. The aftertaste is where I can really enjoy the hops without the diacetyl. This is a good beer with an aftertaste that will keep you thirsty for more. It is a little filling though with the diacetyl and slight overcarbonation. I'd get it again."
"a gargoyle beer, only seen in my city in magazines and the net, a retailer from tijuana offer this beer and i buy a six from stone brewing IPA, Pa and levitation, and i was surprised that inthe uncle sam land the country is not only good for make the war, too is good for brew beers of excelence, like this, and others. this say with respect of course; i try this with mexican food and is a good option for me, little different but is good, i recent discover the craft beer world and this is the top of the iceberg. 85% recommended."
"In conclusion, while Stone's other beers are highly-held for their wild, in your face flavors (as they deserve to be) this beer deserves attention in it's own right. A fantastic, highly drinkable session beer that is also nicely complex. Being available in six packs is a godsend...I'll be buying this again."
"Drinkability: An aggressive amber with an interesting flavor profile, but the astringent finish knocks it down a notch in my book"
"Pours a nice deep clear amber color, nice carbonation, small tan head, and some lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malts, caramel, and citrus. Nice taste for an amber ale, very exact to the style, sweet and slight hop taste, nice little bitter bite at the end. Medium body. Very drinkable at the ABV, would make a nice session brew."
"Off to the store to buy this again!"
"Drinkability gets a lower score because of the aftertaste; It kind of becomes a chore just to finish one of these, much less to reach for another."
"Decent no-frills amber from Stone. Maybe a tad bit much on the bitter side for my taste in ambers, but really what I would expect from Stone."
"Last swigs: Candy root beer barrel smooth beer from Stone. A little less ""bawlsy"" than most other Stone brews, but a pleasant change up, clocking in at an un-Stone like 4.4% ABV. Gotta read that crazy rant from Greg on the back."
"Cheers!"
"This is a great beer overall; an excellent beer for the style. Very well balanced and not too sweet. With the low alcohol, it would make a great session beer. It's great to try a mellower, but still well-crafted, Stone beer."
"Tasted hoppy up front and in the finish but in the middle its a complex circus of taste. some toasted/burnt but not bold just a smidge, wet but in a good sense not watery. I can't believe I've waited this long as this may be the best lower alcohol beer I've had and it can be sessioned for sure. Puckers ya up in the midst of pleasure. I will bow at the doorsteps of stone in honor of this product. A near perfect example of tasty, complex low abv session Mcgillicutty."
"Great Amber? You bet your bippy!"
"Some might disagree but the Levitation Ale stuck me as a good session beer (though slightly on the potent side) It pours a deep amber with an eggshell head that sticks around. The nose is mostly malt but it finishes with a deep bettering hop character. The hopping of this beer is rather interesting. As a departure from some of Stones other brews the malts provide most of the flavor and aroma but the hops, which hang low aromatically, balance the abundant malts well. It is not the most interesting beer in the world (or that Stone brews) but it has the sort of sturdy simplicity that is too often overlooked in American brewing."
"12oz attractive silk screen bottle. Reddish amber body with a small light tan head that stayed around. Light aroma all around with some caramel malt and light hoppy notes. Not too much else was there. Sweet malty taste with a light bitterness and some earthy hops. Mild notes of pine and nuttiness appeared at times. Light bittersweet finish. Pretty smooth and a bit lighter than medium, which works for this. I could make a session of this. Solid all around."
"Oh man, I just moved to Colorado and they have lotsa *wicked* beers out here. Picked up this bottle down the street from Total Beverage and consumed it the next evening in July 2005. Pours a fluffy/clingy finger and a half light tan head over a crystal clear dark rust brownish liquid. Smells are almost imperceptable. Some piney citrus hops and weak caramel, but only with searching. Tastes weakly piney with some grapefruit pith. Hardly hop bitter. The aftertaste is smooth with faint chocolate and nut. Md-light body and mildly carboanted. The carbonation is a bit sharp, so I will swirl to release it...loosing the acrid sting usually lets me pull other flavors out of a beer."
"For fans of brown ale (such as myself), and mild beers (such as myself), this is a really interesting and enjoyable take on the brown ale style. Very nice!"
"Drinkability- This one kinda tastes more like an ESB to me. Especially with the hops in this one. Not a bad brew considering though. Good job by Stone regardless of the style."
"The smell is mostly of malts and fairly rich. The taste is nice and solid, with hops really taking over in the finish. The mouthfeel isn't quite as rich as it could be, but the drinkability is very good."
"I haven't had all of Stone's creations yet, and I haven't fallen in love with all of them, but this is the first one that I don't have any interest in revisiting."
"Overall impression: Yet another quality offering from Stone. This is a very well balanced beer, with a good malt backbone and plenty of hops without being overwhelming. Much more approachable for the uninitiated than most of Stone's other offerings. Not a bad brew for review number 150!"
"Levitation Ale is the only Stone beer to come (exclusively) in 12 ounce bottles and is the only regular offering to score less than 4.0 on this site. Don't be misled, however; this is excellent beer. Doubly so if you love hops. Beefing up the body would do wonders, but then the Stone gargoyle would have a more difficult time levitating on the front of the classy, silk-screened bottle. Lean and mean and hoppy as hell. Recommended."
"It is clear that this is a balanced beer and the lighter alcohol level and body make this one of Stone's most drinkable. While not my favorite stone brew, it certainly tastes damn good."
"This beer pours a dark amber with a light tan head. The head looks like it will never go away. It leaves thick laces. It smells like citrus, and maybe flowers. It smells hoppy., but not too over the top. It tastes slightly malty. It has a spicy floral taste. It is lightly carbonated. It is smooth. The taste lingers im my mouth. This beer can go all night long. It is very low in alcohol content, so you could drink quite a few of them. It is a little too hoppy for my. I might drink it again, if I came to your house and it was all you had."
"Pours a clear amber to brown color with a big 3 cm tan fluffy head on top. THe aroma is nice and malty with a just a slight bit of floral character. THe flaovr is citrusy with orange and a spicy malt flavor. There is some hop bitterness at the end along with floral hop notes. The maltiness dominates the flavors with the hops playing a back seat role. Good but not great. The malt profile tastes very one-dimensional without any surprises or unique complexities."
"Pours a dark reddish brown, cloudier than the one in the picture. big fluffly orangish-whitehead that's leaving lace as it recedes. It has a good amount of hop aroma. It smells fresh, a little spicy, floral, with a dark sweet maltiness. Very rich, full bodied. Light carbonation, mild bitterness pulls through and get stronger and stronger. It still lingers on the back of your tongue after you swallow. This beer was probably dry hopped, it's hoppiness is sorta like an american pale ale because it is a little piney and citrusy. Another great beer from Stone. Only complaint is that the bitterness seems too strong for an American Brown."
"Toasted malt dusted with powdered sugar sweetness up front. Slightly nutty and caramelly. Bitterness comes in near the finish, with a spicy, citrusy flavor. Nice. Medium-bodied, with a minerally feel. Lightest drinking Stone, but still full-flavored and well made."
"IMHO: an OD on the hops."
"Clear ruby dark amber. Long-lasting 1/2 -cm beige head. Very light nose. Citrus, almondy. Hoppy from the beginning although not agressive. Dry woody and earthy flavors. Sharp bitterness with pencil shavings and leafy edges. Thin-medium body, moderately high carbonation. Mineralic aftertaste, ironoxide like. Alright low gravity ale with a hop oriented flavor balance. I would prefer it with a more defined malt crunch, more biscuity and firm, but it serves its purpose."
"Overall, I was let down a bit. I like how the sweet and hoppiness blended. But it seemed a little off. It's very close to being an excellent brew, but not quite there."
"Some people get pissy with Stone for all the rave reviews they receive for their beers, but with each one I try I feel there's no reason to consider Stone overrated. Solid product from a well-run brewery."
"Pours a deep rusty-amber with an unfiltered haze, a decent, if thin tan foam, some sticky lacing. Aroma is a plethora of roasted malt, fresh, chewy sourdough bread  and, HOPS!! This is from Stone, remember. Despite the 4.4%, this is not a truncated Arrogant Bastard, in that it has almost none of the chocolate and coffee spikes that punctuate that ambrosial brew. Pine resin, oak, and citrus hops greet you initially, followed by a solid middle that I found a little lacking in the malt promised by the aroma. It is not sweet, but rather bitter. The carbonation is just right, and the finish is nicely dry and speaks of roasted grain. All in all a great session beer."
"on draft at the Blind Tiger NYC. Pours a healthy dark amber. Tiny bubble film was all the head I got. Medium hoppy nose. Notes of solid malt base, grainy hops very present from start to finish. Sort of like ""Arrogant Bastard light"" As close to a session brew as I've sampled from stone. Good ale, worth a try."
"This reddish-brown brew poured a nice head and is leaving a nice lacing in my pint. Smell is a heavy dose of sweet malts and a hint of floral hops. Taste is very good with a nice play between the smooth malts with a mild hop finish. When I saw the 4.4 abv I did not think this would have the traditional Stone quality but the qualiy is there I am quite impressed with the drinkability of this beer."
"At 4.4% this makes a nice session beer."
"A tasty brew, the mild alcohol and hop levels almost make it hard to believe Stone brewed it."
"The finish is clean and leaves an excellent sweetness on the palate."
"This is the only Stone beer that I have tried that did not impress me that much. It poured a nice dark amber color with a great head that left lots of lace down the glass. The smell was quite malty with a hint of piney hops in there. The taste...well I can only describe it as ""Arrogant Bastard light"". It does have quite a bit of hop kick and a good malt backbone but it does not tase unique enough to give it a higher score. This beer is very easy to drink though, just not all that exciting."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown colored body with a nice two finger deep cream fluffy head leaves a web of evenly strung lacing, can't beat the appearance here. Aroma: Awesome piney hop character with sweet caramel and fruity ale like characteristics, nice mild abv for a Stone brew but the aromatics come together for this one. Taste: Wonderful American style pale ale with Stone signature bitterness but more of a session Arrogant Bastard ale. Very creamy tone applied to the bouquet of hoppiness that this beer has malts are nice toasted to perfection with hints of caramel and fruit good combonation for this beer. Stone doesn't disappoint and this milder beer that they produce is no exception still extremely flavorful wish it was more available to me. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied packs a slippery oily hop resin tone that glides right down the palate. Drinkability: Wow, nice beer not the most balanced of pale ales but for Stone this is a great beer that I can get down with because it's not shy on flavor or aromatics good stuff. I owe one to beergeek279 and cupbeerman for this sample."
"Ah yes, this is much, much better. The malt has been kicked up a bit now, creating a slightly sweet middle to the beer, which lingers with just a hint of nuttiness in the aftertaste. A swirling eddy of hops dances around the mouth from start to finish, with a teasing tingle leading into a slightly sharp lemon-like flavor at the finish. As the beer warms, the malt flavors gather strength, and a toastier quality. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, despite the abundant carbonation. I can see now what they were going for on the first run, and theyve nailed it. Good, good stuff."
"This one is definitely drinkable, easy to drink and not overbearing on the alcohol content. This is the light beer for the hophead."
"12 oz. bottle: This pours an amber color that is almost clear with only a little head. Hint of grapefruit in the aroma. Definitely some hoppiness to this beer. Slight taste of grapefruit in the beer. Not too heavily malted. Stone Light? maybe in comparison to some of their others, but definitely a very good beer!"
"The King recommends drinking this beer with smoked tri-tip."
"Is it just me or is it hysterical to write that about a Stone brew?"
"A strong malty aroma wafts from the glass as I pour, caramel malt perhaps. Pours with a thick tan head, it is pretty clear and a dark amber color. The aroma of hops is dominant in the aroma but a solid malt presence is there as well. Definitely a bitter beer. Some sweetness is here but not really perceptible as the hops dominate the residual sweetness. A certain fullness in the mouth from this ""light"" beer from stone. Not enough hop flavor is in this beer for me, it would help to balance this beer out. This beer is super hoppy, but it needs more flavor hop contributions (or perhaps different ones). Pretty well balanced for a super hoppy low gravity ale. The malt notes really help to carry this beer. As it warms up, I realize that this beer may be a bit old, it tastes like it might have begun to oxidize (Stone where is the bottle date?)."
"Thick,sticky,puffy head with glue like lacing.The appearance is almost like a shiny copper candy bar wrapper.Great balance of sweet candy and citrus aroma.Great flavor which finishes with a nice and easy hop kick.Suprisingly easy drinkability which helps the beer live up to its name."
"Drinkability: A great ""session"" beer from Stone. Would be my house beer if it was more readily available to me."
"Thanks goes out to xlperro for the bottle!"
"Drinkability  This is a good drinker, and a great choice if youre looking for a tasty ale with a low ABV."
"Good beer."
"Notes: Beautifully made; six thumbs up."
"Medium brown color. Large head. Aroma is malty. A medium bodied amber. Malts are lively, slightly nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are fairly bitter. Very drinkable, Lots of flavor. Nicely balanced. It not your typical Stone brew, but it's a very nice beer. Very drinkable. Very cool etched beer bottle. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"Thanks to winomark for bringing me Arrogant Bastard Ale's milder, little brother!"
"Who beat up the Arrogant Bastard? A less powerful, more sessionable offering from Stone, yet still complex. I like it, and I'd like to see more brews like this from them."
"While the low %ABV makes this beer an attractive choice for session drinking, the lean towards bitterness makes this style hard for me to go to regularly. Not bad but nothing I'd go out of my way for soon."
"Big thanks to xlperro for this ""extra"""
"Thanks to aaronh for the sample of this one. It's a shame that this beer couldn't normally survive the trip to the East Coast since this the best low ABV beer I've had! I wondered if I would ever give a 5 for drinkability, but this certainly earned it!!"
"Stone has crafted another great individual unique ale. It feels great and drinks smooth with all the hops. Very well thought out."
"Deep amber color topped by a tan head that slowly fades to a rocky ring of foam. To be honest, I was expecting to see a paler colored beer. What a nice surprise. A nice malty, fruity aroma laced with some hops greets the nose. Very inviting. The taste is surprisingly bitter, considering the hops played a supporting role in the aroma. Some roasted malt and caramel notes come thorugh after a few sips, with a touch of sweetness playing on the tongue in between slaps of hoppy bitterness. A touch of pine, some saopiness, and a dab of citrus all dance around, overpowering the malt. Slightly unbalanced, but still enjoyable. As the beer warms (or as my tastebuds get seduced by the hops) the malt comes through better and the beer shows better balance. The mouthfeel is lighter, but smooth. The carbonation is perfectly done. Not noticeably harsh, yet not flat either. And the drinkability is superb. This has a lot of Stone's signature attributes, yet can be consumed on a regular basis for the duration of the evening. And most beer drinkers would still not be worthy of this beer. A great session beer."
"Off white/tan head on an nice amber/red body. Bright malt and fresh hop aroma. Burnt malt intensity with roasted nut flavor. The burnt flavor is surprising considering how light in body the beer is. Amazingly long lasting. Rich thick and chewy, a bit rough. Excellent, if rough beer. Gimme another."
"Lightish in body and mild carbonation equal a highly quaffable beer. A pretty basic, straightforward, but quality pale ale from the guys(and girls?) at Stone."
"ReRate (bottle sample) 22 February 2003: Celebrating Washington's Birthday with a sampling of the newly-forumulated Levitation. This is a winner. It has a nice long-lasting tan head, clear reddish-brown color & a great balance of malt & hops in the flavor. This is Stone's ESB, IMHO. The reformulation is a major improvement over the original Levitation."
"My review of this version is that it is much better in all categories and more like the ""Stone"" brews, I come to know and ""Love""!"
"Bottom Line: Call me a wimp. I still prefer London Pride as a lower-ABV alternative."
"Personally, I like this beer. It's a great alternative to other lower alcohol ""session"" beers as it actually has some hop presence, even if that presence is a little overboard. But hey, this is Stone..."
"If I can match the Standards of Stone, I would be a very happy man."
"Pours a nice copper color with a big creamy head that holds pretty well. Lace throughout. Big aroma of hops right off the bat, as expected. Creamy mouthfeel, and a dry, bitter, big hop finish. This is their less alcohol ale, but the no skimping on the hops! Nice ale. This definitely could be a session beer, if the hops don't get to you first."
"It looks much like many APAs on the market:  brownish-red with an off-white head that dimishes but sticks on top to the end.  The smell is pretty much all hops with just a trace of malt sweetness and slight notes of citrus.  The taste is almost all hop bitterness.  I kept searching for more as I emptied the glass but was left disappointed.  It tastes like someone was making a pale ale and accidentally dropped in a triple dose of hops.  Any underlying flavors disappear almost on hitting the mouth.  Even at 4.4%, I'd have a hard time putting away more than two of these in a sitting."
"Charged with anticipation, I eagerly went out and grabbed this on the first day that it was (truly) available here in Arizona. After I pour, I observe a mouth-watering amber colored brew with a cream-colored head that thins, but stays at just the right level, leaving scattered lace. I soak in the aroma, which is huge, as can always be expected from a Stone brew. Juicy citrus and Christmas tree hops and caramel maltiness combine for a wonderful and unique aroma. I take the highly anticipated first sip, and discover a suberbly balanced malt and hop profile, consisting of citrus and rind-like bitterness, which make the aforementioned Christmas tree-like character, along with caramel and grainy malt character. Bitterness leaves a unique impression in the middle of the palate. Hops also provide a nice and sharp bite. A crisp and satisfying flavorful brew."
