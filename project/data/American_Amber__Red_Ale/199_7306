My bottle was pretty fresh and had bite so I'm not sure how much has faded out, but I can imagine this being better super fresh. For now it's just ok.","RyanK252","Apr 03, 2015"

This is a nice, complex beer that I enjoyed and any aficionado of red's should as well.","Pourharddrinkslow","Mar 26, 2015"

I could hardly even taste the hops and malts anymore. More boozy than any barleywine, quad, or imperial stout I've had. No balance at all. This beer pretty much turned me off on anything Ballast Point.","sa93","Mar 24, 2015"

I find the recent wave of New England style hoppy Red Ales more to my liking, finding the Simcoe for hopping and dry hopping more appealing personally (Lawson's Steve's Back Yard Red Ale and Fiddlehead Ruby Claire  are my favorite examples of this style). I'd recommend trying it if you can handle a beer that was designed to challenge your palate to a duel!","Hendry","Jan 15, 2015"

I love the big amber style of beer, and I will say that this does not come close to Nugget Nectar or Lagunitas Mondo, which are two of my favorite examples. Overall, I think it falls short because it lacks that clean, crisp and fresh hop character that the others have.","antott0523","May 02, 2014"

Pours a deep, clear blood red with a thick fluffy off-white head. Smell is boozy caramel malt, completely overshadowed by hops. The hop scents start off with some mild pine/citrus rind, followed by tons of sweet fruit. Taste is sweet toasted malt, a sudden wave of booze carrying tons of juicy and bitter hop flavors with it. Finishes with sticky sweetness rolling in bitterness and the heat left over from the alcohol. Definitely a sipper, but great if you like big hoppy beers.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Aug 10, 2013"

The taste has a mild caramelized sweetness, which is overwhelmed by the abrasive and intrusive hop profile. I have no respect for >100 IBU beers that can't mitigate the gross, grapefruit rind bitter aftertaste...which this one seems to push to the max. As the beer warms the malt sweetness pops a bit more, but it really doesn't do much to cut down on the insane bitterness.

The nose comprises sweet caramel, light leek, pine resin, and light spicy greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with less leek and a light menthol character in the finish. Unfortunately, what is present--in abundance--is the clash between the caramel and the resin, which are apparently acting out a centuries-old feud right on my tongue. Buckle, my ass, it's a fucking raze job! The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this just didn't work for me, as the hops and the malts just clash far too much for any enjoyment to result.","TMoney2591","Beers"

Pine explodes and quickly turns into tart grapefruit then plunges into caramel/toffee with a hint of grassy bitterness and some notes of black tea (almost like unsweetened iced tea) that all fades out into a bitter orange and caramel that clings onto the tongue and doesn't let go.

Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops and moderate caramel malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Moderate amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/pineapple hops and light-moderate caramel/bready malts; with balanced and crisp malt/bitterness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red ale! All around great complexity and balance of bright hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV.

The hops never let this big viscous malt take over, and bite along the way. A little drying impact to clean up the cloy and some tropical notes to ""juicify."" If I sit the last tiny sip out overnight, I will have a sticky/gummy yield in the morning. This is not a clean tasting beer, but what pirate wants that?!?!

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear, dark amber red color with a LARGE off-white egg-shell color that goes down slowly. Scent is quite malt forward, with plenty of sweet caramel malt aromas. There is also a ton of hop resin in the nose. A little bit of that lovely cat piss aroma we get from some hoppy beers as well. Taste is initially sweet, and the sweetness actually lingers. Very bitter in the middle, but starts out smooth and ends rather smooth. Nice malt profile to compliment the intense hop profile. With each sip, the bitterness tends to intensify, which is rather unique. Definite lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue, while the front of the tongue leaves a nice sweet candy flavor. Burnt malts as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated for this particular style. Drinkability is scary for how high the ABV is. Overall, this is another great hoppy offering from Ballast Point. Sweeter than I had expected, but not overly sweet.","DovaliHops","Beers"

Finally, the bitterness, likely thanks to the residual sugar, was far too balanced for anything with the name ""Tongue Buckler.""

The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Nice aroma going on here and a very complex flavor. This one made the citrus shine throughout. The alcohol on the followthrough was very noticeable. Everything seemed to work really well together.

The flavors were caramel and citrus sweet touching down on the front tongue, but they are quickly overpowered by bitter and sour flavors around the sides and back of the tongue.

There is a little alcohol in the finish, but the burn balances the malt well. Very enjoyable, with a medium body and creamy carbonation that is perfect for this beer.

Well, it's not THAT intense, but it is one bitter mother of an amber ale...a friend compared it to Nugget Nectar or steroids. However, what I enjoy about NN is that it utilizes more hop flavor, whereas Tongue Buckler focused more on hop bitterness, as it coated the tongue with raw, leafy hop cones and alpha acids galore. The amber malts are sturdy in the background, giving the body a medium-thick consistency and semi-creamy mouthfeel. Lingering bitter bite lasts throughout the finish.

Perfumey as hell in the mouth yet the tongue buckler sensation was omnipresent. Rich, malty taste and I get hints of bittersweet chocolate and toffee somewhere.

I enjoyed this brew but couldn't drink more than three","chargerfanjess","Dec 21, 2004"

I was filled with trepidation. However, I will happily state that this was a very tasty treat, far from overpowering, sickly or alcoholic. I rate the brews from Ballast Point very highly; they consistently produce high quality products and always make an effort to add a Review for them whenever I can. This really should be bottled.","TheLongBeachBum","Apr 19, 2003"
4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer hit the spot the other night and I hope to come back for more. Had this on tap at the San Diego Brewing Co. and it was great. Poured a great amber color with a great head and nice lacing. The smell leaned more towards the IPA side of things with a nice wiff of hops and a little carmel malt scent in there too. The taste was very good and was a perfect mix between a strong amber and an IPA with a nice healthy hoppy flavor backed by a sweet malt that broke through very nicely and came to the foreground to ballance. I too hope they bottle this one someday, I'll buy!","Dmann","Beers"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"XLPerro turned me on to this brew, it's an Imperial Red according to the brewery. Aroma and taste profile was hoppy, that's for sure. There was a bit too much sweetness or I would have really fallen for this one. Color was a deep amber, head was tannish. Nice solid mouthfeel and decent drinkability. A very interesting beer that I'm glad I tried.","Mark","0"
