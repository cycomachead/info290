"Little too sweet, but ok"
"O: easy to drink; flavor wasn't all that complex; I liked that there was more bittering hops than in most ambers;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A pretty good  American Amber / Red Ale, I would drink this again if I come across it."
""
""
""
"Almost as good, or comparable to Red Rocket!"
""
""
""
"Pours sunset orange with a eggshell one finger head.  Lots and lots of little bubbles defying gravity.  The smell is mild, bready, lite hops, overall nothing earthshaking.  The taste is of bread, herbal hops and malt.  It reminds me of a well hopped Wee Heavy.  Prretty good, I'd have another."
""
""
""
"overall: a good beer to play beer pong with"
"-tastes watery and a little over carbonated but apart from that a smooth bubbly feel"
""
""
"Whoah really aromatic. Pungent spicy and hoppy. Tastes great! Better than Red Seal."

"O: This is one of those times I'm glad I picked out a beer other than the one I was intending to buy.  Too hoppy to call this refreshing, but certainly sessionable.  This beer with half the IBU's would be off the charts.  Why force the bitterness in there North Coast?  Flavors are amazing in this one."
"This hits the spot like nobody's business. The malt provides a good softening background for the reasonably intense hops, which are pleasantly bitter and citrusy."

""
""
"North Coast Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale -----4/5."

"I love this beer.  It's the perfect brew for my palate.  I think I'd be happy drinking this everyday."

"Floral and medicinal notes, but balanced and tasty"
"12 oz bottle.  Pours amber with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of hops, grapefruit and stale bready malt.  Body is medium and crisp.  Grassy, herbal hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long and dry.  Taste was improved as beer warmed up. Overall it is a good brew"
""
""
"Initially sweet caramel malts with a bitter hoppiness that has a bite to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: LOVED the Classic Look and Enjoyed the Taste....Might have benefitted from a bit more of a Hoppy Aroma and an increase in Carbonation.....But All-In-All I ENJOYED it!"

"bitter flavor and easy to drink"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice foamy, amber color and left a good lacing on my shaker glass after I finished drinking.  Definitely going to include this into my rotation."

""
"3.39/5: Pretty good...one could do far worse for the style"
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite, but not a bad brew."
""
"This is one of my favorite beers. It has an almost perfect balance. The malts make for a large rounded mouthfeel then the hops give it a bitter clean finish"
""

"Poured into a tulip glass after taken out of fridge for ten minutes. Slightly nutty, rich,smooth."

"Poured a slightly clouded deep red. The head burns off pretty quickly and leaves on the slightest amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is not malty but nondescript, with a light funky earthy quality. The taste is deeper with the malt with some darker fruit notes and caramel malt breadiness. There's a nice moderate weight to the body and overall this is a good-to-very good red ale that doesn't blow you away but is very well made."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Slightly above average pale ale. More hop characteristics would have been nice based on what the label says."

"This is a good example of an amber/red ale which meets the style characteristics quite well. The malt is not overly sweet or cloying but just right. I’m not a fan of this style, but this is one I could drink all day."

"O: I always find myself trying to pair light yet flavorful beers with foods. This beer should be your ""type O"" : IT GOES WITH ANYTHING. Fact: You could drink this at the tailgate or with a fantastic filet... and no one would be upset. A true jack of all trades. Completely drinkable. A must try for anyone who enjoys North Coast.... but not their best outing."

"Interesting that it has a medium bitterness that does not goes away and both malt and hops are melted together. Though it felt a bit too thin, but this makes it very sessionable."

"O: Easy to drink and flavorful with now dominant or overpowering flavors/aromas - leading me to believe this would be a good beer to have with meals. Well balanced and drinkable - definitely could have another of these."

"O- Though there are many better examples of the style out there, it's not a bad red ale and it's one of the first beers I had when beginning my craft beer adventure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This wasn't bad. I felt everything was mixed together very well, but nothing really seemed to pop. I may give it another go down the road to see if maybe mine had too much age on it."

"Ruedrichs Red Seal Ale pours a reddish color with a very large lacing head. There is a malty undertone, with lots of floral hop notes in the aroma. The taste has a bold malty backbone, with strong notes of floral hop flavors. Full flavors, nice body. Overall a very nice and hoppy red ale."
""
""
"There's an interaction between the malt and bittering hops that gives the impression of burnt bread, which is fairly offputting, but the malt and hop flavor profiles are nice. Lots of floral hop presence, as well. not your typical west coast American amber."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer can be appreciated by all beer drinkers."
""
"Wow, I don't know if I got a bad bottle, or what happened here. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit hoppy, some malts are present. Taste is pure bitterness. No balance at all. No citrus, pine, floral notes, just a whole lot of bitter. Feels medium bodied and bitter in the mouth and overall I did not much care for this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and well balanced red ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Food match: Great thing about a balanced beer is that it works with practically anything; dark meats, light meats, salads, cheese platters - I would personally lean towards Thai but that's just my preference."

"O: A wonderfully balanced beer that makes for a refreshing session ale."

"In a great tasting lineup, this beer was the surprise standout."

"O: A great beer, would be wonderful companion on a spring picnic."
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall I think I may have drank this in the wrong glass. With such a strong aroma I should have had this in a tulip. It is an easy drinking “red”/ amber and I like the balance of hops and malt. I would order this again."

"Overall Drinkability: Another very good North Coast beer."
"Overall - I wouldn't consider myself a hophead, especially in the winter when I usually want a malty beer, however, this is a great hoppy beer. I think it will please hop-and non-hopheads. This is a solid complex red ale that I would highly recommend. Its definitely worth picking up. Another winner by North Coast."

"Delicious on the palette. Complex, hoppy, crispy beer with a balanced malt body, high(er) carbonation that allows for a flavorful, refreshing/savory finish. Other flavors present, spices balance the hop to make this one of my favorite beers in awhile. From a famous, well respected brewery - if this beer had 7.5% abv or more it would be one of my favorites. Amazing for what it is, whole 6 pack consumption."
""
"overall, another brewery with some decent brew, but nothing extra-ordinary. the stout was good, the pilsener was okay. but this ale is hoppier than i would expect it to be. it's still decent, and a drinkable brew. as much as i go against the hop-py standard, i do like this and could actually do a few in succession. i thik that part alone warrants a 4.5."

"O - For a session ale this beer is a must for any hop head. If you just want a good hoped up beer to drink throughout the week this one would also work. Only downfall is the date; for it being a beer with hops and low abv it should have a date for the consumers. If it had one I am sure I would have picked one up sooner or been buying it more regular. It will get docked for no date on the bottle. As is, its a really good beer that will be in my fridge from now on."
""
"It's a world class beer.  One of my all time favorite!!"
"got a sixpack of this baby for the furthur show last nigh at red rocks. it poured a nice red copper color with a two inch white head. the smell is nice west coast hops and red malt, hoppy for a red ale. it has a crisp bitter flavor at first, but the malt mellows the finish with some caramel and bready notes. its very well balanced, and slightly unconventional. the mouthfeel is nice too, medium body and very drinkable, intensely carbonated. lots of flavor packed into this beer, one of the better north coast products ive had. an excellent concert beer as well, hearty and drinkable at the same time, nice!"
"O- If I had to describe it I'd call it a Pale Red Ale. Great balance leaning slightly hop-ward. A beer I've gone to multiple times and have always been satisfied with."
""
""
""
"O: An awesome, round, balanced ale that does everything and anything. Pair it with meat, fish, chicken or just drink alone as a session ale. Simple yet complex, and highly recommended overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium vicousity with a taste that lingers for a good 20 seconds after a drink."
""
"Very good for the style, over all, good."
""
""
""
""
"O: This was a good beer. Very refreshing and a good equal mix of hops and malt."
"Medium bodied, warming from the swallow on, crisply effervescent though not overpowering, just noticeable. A solid, tasty, refreshing beer that could easily fill many roles."
"Overall - It's a beer that you can drink just about in any setting, from watching a football to a nice dinner thanks to it's simple yet enjoyable flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"I remember this beer very clearly. It was a mystery beer that I had once and I knew it was from California and I remember this same dirty kind of earthen tone to it. Seems a bit nicer on the bottle than it was on tap. As far as the earthen tone goes, I mean. A decent amber, but too earthy. Decent."

"I liked this but I don't see why it would be world class. Seems more like the brewers reputation being rewarded than the beer. Poured a 3"" custard head which took a long time to start to recede but once it did lost wind fast. The body is a clear deep golden yellow, which is nice, but doesn't at all look like an amber/red ale. Smells mildly of hops and malt, no surprises. Taste is good with a very mild butterscotch and mild malt, followed by a persistent hops finish. Good beer."
""
""
"Overall: A very solid Red Ale. Has the hop presence of a IPA with a strong malt character to balance it very well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A wonderful amber from North Coast. Really nice, approachable flavor and smoothness."
"Overall: quite a smooth and sessional ale, though I wouldn't want to have a whole heap of them in one hit unless I came into more money than I'm currently worth."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper golden color with a small off white head. The head dissipates rather quickly leaving an off white cap. During effervescence, the beer's bouquet is of mild floral, but mostly citrus hops. I love the greenish tint the beer has around it's top edges and in the foam as it's being poured. As the beer settles, the grain presents more prominently. The moutfheel is very nice. Smooth, wet, and perfectly carbonated. Very mild flavor. Light toasted malt with appealing mild hop flavor in the background. The maltiness does eventually succumb to the citrus hop that prevails late. What's left in the finish is a mild, unoffensive hop perfume in the palate. Very good and drinkable pale ale. That from a fellow who nearly never likes malty pale ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really like this one. I pick it up quite often when I find it sitting in the local Whole Foods."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Enjoyed it a lot, I recommend trying this."

"Price Point - $2.25/single 12oz"

""
"B-"
""
""
""
"Overall, I feel a little let down by this beer as I was hoping for a little more malt presence. That aside, it is a drinkable beer and something I would probably have again."
"O: This is a fine red ale. One of my go-to beers when looking for something refreshing and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer for the style. Goes down way too easy. Well worth checking out."

"A cherry amber appearance with a thumbs width white head and nice lacing.A sweet aroma of toffee and honey alongside a touch of floral. Flavor matches the aroma quite with a mildly bitter finish to this. A very smooth, medium body to this. Overall, this feels like it is toeing the line between an amber and a red. I guess the hoppy finish to this makes it a red but I get a big amber vibe from this one otherwise. That said, I really enjoyed this one. High up there on my list of ambers."
"Mouth feel is clean and crisp. This beer is also pretty smooth throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The amount of hop flavor in this beer is insane, and the malt isn't a pushover either. An immensely enjoyable amber."
""
""
"O - Great balance and a nice example of the style."
""
"O- This is a great beer. On the shelf, it doesn't look like much and I doubt I would have ever tried it had my friend not bought it and shared a few. This brew has a good flavor, its easy to drink and keeps me interested. Another winner from North Coast."
"O: Really great stuff. I may be looking at new session beer here."
""
""
"Amber light brown colour. It is pleasantly cloudy. Two finger head, but dissipated to a foam still resting on the surface of the beer. Smells of peaches and grapefruit, with a floral smell intermingled. Tastes of floral, grapefruit and peaches. Smooth with sour notes, a slight bitterness at the end which lingers. Moderate carbonation. Medium body. There is a final fragrance in the nose reminding me of Thai food-its lemongrass and bergemot. My first first American Amber, and first from North Coast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: Great beer from a great brewery, definitely one of the best Red Ales out there, especially for the price ($8.99/6pack where I work)"
""
""
""
"Overall – Crisp, clean, enjoyable. This is a refreshing beer I would love to try on tap but the bottle is definitely worth many more purchases."
""
""
"I think this is a great red ale style with a bit of a hoppy taste and a average head...carbonation is good and i recommend this as a great session beer.I am a big fan of North Coast Brewing Co.and see myself picking this beer up many more times in the future."
"Pretty tasty red ale, this. Maybe not on the same level as other North Coast offerings such as Old Rasputin and Old Stock ale, but you won't be disappointed."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours amber with a thin, off-white head that holds some retention, but eventually ends up a thin layer atop the ale. Aromas and tastes are similar: spicy & floral hops, caramel malts, toasted grains, sharp but not too aggressive citric bitterness from the hops. Well balanced. Mouth-feel is creamy and medium bodied. Overall, I've always said this is a great introductory/gateway craft beer. You get a taste of the hops, but they won't blow away the palate of someone new to craft beer. Always a good west coast amber to come back to now and again."
"Pours out a cloudy copper-amber color with a decent fluffy off-white head (two fingers) that sticks around for about a minute and a half, but leaves behind some really nice lace curtains. Smells of caramel malts and some zesty citrus peel. Tastes of the same as the nose but also includes a fair helping of yeasty spice as well. Body and carbonation are medium strength, texture is smooth and creamy in the mouth. Overall a really nice amber ale with a somewhat ""west coast"" hopping bill."
""
"It has a beautiful looking red color (although color doesn't mean much to me), it has a nice sized head (about a fingers length, as others have stated) that dissipates quite quickly. The taste is pretty nice. It is a little bit bitter but it is still pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer has an excellent balance between the malt and hop flavors. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these at a time because it goes down easily and the taste has quite a bit of flavor. It would probably make for a good beer to pair with food because none of the flavors are overpowering."
""
"On tap at Mitch's Seafood in San Diego. Coppery amber color in the, um, plastic pint cup. Decent head and well carbonated on the tongue."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Light hop nose and flavor is fruity hops, some bitterness. $2.79 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"O- I was not expecting one of the best beers I've reviewed on this site from a bottle that cost me a buck fifty. Try this one if you can get your hands on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy amber with a medium off white head. Aroma of caramel malt, yeast and earthy hops and some fruity notes. Taste is sweet malt, yeast, earthy hops, with some fruity notes. Palate is a medium body with lively carbonation. Finishes with sweet caramel malt, some yeast and fruity notes, followed by some earthy hops bitterness for balance and a slightly nutty ending. Overall a good drinkable nicely balanced brew."
"Single finger head on a slightly hazy golden amber body. Nice lacing circumferentually. Aroma is mostly malt and breads. Flavor is very interesting and unique with an initially malty and bitter taste which transitions to a floral and herbal finish. Medium in body and moderate to high carbonation with a dry finish. Overall a very good and complex brew. I will be having this one agaIn"
""
""
""
""
""
"definitely quite drinkable in multiple. maybe 3, 4 at the most in one sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish, copper color with a fluffy, foamy head. Some slight lacing with pockets of carbonation rising to the top. Some slight scent of dry malts and hops. Crisp and clean taste of malts and slightly bitter hops. Dry and mildly bitter finish. Full of flavor in this well made, sipping beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a swell go to in the American Red category."
""
"Although this isn't a style I try often, I have to say this beer really didn't seem like a finished product to me. The hop character is confusing in this brew and seems forced upon the palate. Although I'm a big fan of north coast, I probably won't try this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. It makes me sad that I cannot regularly get this beer. Utah brings in most everything from NCB, why not Olde Stock Ale or this one? This one is good enough to be a special release. Fortunately, the brewers make this one all the time and it is widely (outside of Utah) available. Enjoy this one if you have not tried it before."
""
""
""
"I've been trying all kinds of beers at Kroger's where you can ""build your own six-pack"" and discovered I seem to enjoy the red beers the best. I've seen Red Seal Ale many times and decided to give it a try...wow....what a pleasant surprise!! Most beers are too much this or too much that, but Red Seal Ale, for me, has the perfect balance of tartness, sweetness, and hopiness...just right! I will be reaching for this one many more times in the future. Would like to try it on tap if I could find it too."
""
"A nice orange-redish beer with about an inch head. Lots of spicy hops in they nose. Tastes of spicy pine with a fruity background. Some lemon and biscuity notes are present followed by a nutty finish. There is a bit of a mettalic bite present which isnt great but it isnt ovewhelming. The mouthfeel is very dry but slightly oily from the hops. A very good amber ale!"
"O: Short notes in part because I was distracted, in part because it just wasn't anything special."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer, but nothing too memorable."
""
""
"It Christmas Eve....Eve....and I am trying the Red Seal from North Coast. I had had this beer many years ago and it is nice to try it again. The beer poured a very nice amber clear color with 1/2 finger thick slightly off white head that is lacing on my pint glass. The smell is not powerful...subtle nots of malt and hop. The taste is slightly bitter and has a very crisp finish. Malt is present throughout and a hint of roast at the beginning. The mouthfeel is a niceemedium body Amber with above average carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer."
""
""
""
"Overall: After all the hype, I really wasn't that impressed. This is a decent session beer that's smooth and drinkable. Just nothing to get excited about."
""
"Spent a few minutes at the cold beer store looking to try something new, and I found this beer. There is little to no head and a slight fog when in a glass. When tasting it starts slightly sweet but finishes bitter. A hoppy aftertaste. This brew was a nice surprise!"
""
""
""
"I am thoroughly impressed with this offering from North Coast. If I could, I would keep a sixer of this around at all times."
""
""
""
"Overall to me its a pretty drinkable amber ale but nothing really to reach for again and again. Ok beer overall."
""
""
""
"O: Not impressed."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: One of my top beers, primarily because of consistent quality over the years. First had it in the early 90s while stationed in Maryland / Pennsylvania / DC area. Finely balanced between malts and hops, all ingredients complementing each other. It's all about the flavor up front and the alcohol hiding in the background. A great ale all around."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It pours a deep red orange color with a nice 1"" of white head. It smells of citrus hops and mild,bread like malt. The taste is nice and crisp. This was one of my regulars in college. I credit this as one of the beers that really got me interested in beer. Good stuff."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a creamy smooth feel and light level of carbonation. Overall a very solid take on the style. Very clean and easy drinking, there would be no issue throwing a couple of these back."

"Smells like a sea fog, and not too high of abv... it might just be able to save me from my double i.p.a. addiction which will probably lead to my demise."
"Overall: I admit to overlooking this beer as i forgot that it was so hoppy and well constructed. A classic american craft beer. Recommended."
"A nice beer but not my favorite example of the style"

"I am gushing a little bit, so let me say that the generous hopping does add some flair, but is a detractor from the mouth feel. I have also had highly hopped ales that have had more personality on the palate, but if balance is what they were going for, then they got it."

"Massive bittering hops without any malt to reign them in results in a beer which is a bit much on the palate and one I'm not in a hurry to return to. Nevertheless a good rendition of the style."

"A nice fruity easy-going session beer."
"Overall Drinkability - Might make a decent session for newbs just getting into hops, but I find it a little to boring and unbalanced. Not a bad beer, just thoroughly forgettable."
"A small taster convinced me to venture for a full serving. Pumped into a pint glass, a slightly murky, ruddy copper color with a huge puff of active white head that displayed excellent retention and left some crusty lacing on the glass. Fresh, zesty citrus on the nose, with a good balance of malty sweetness. Caramel sweetness on the tongue, with a good mixture of fresh citrus and piney hops, with a pleasant fruitiness throughout, and a simple, mellow bitterness. Medium body, crisp, dry, and very drinkable. Very good cask-conditioned."
"O: A solid beer, but is on the verge of being too bitter for my personal taste. If you like a very hoppy/malty beer, this would be one to try."
"O: this is a solid beer, but it doesn't do too much for me. I'm glad I tried it again, but I won't give it another chance, there are better beers out there."
"Pours a lighter golden-amber. Just slightly cloudy, off-white ring stays around. Only category I'm rating below ""good"" because it's a little light in color for the style. Smell reminds me of honey biscuits. Taste is very good. Simply a well-balanced brew, with generous enough amounts of toasted malt and floral hops to satisfy. Reminiscent of a pale ale in its hopitude. Mouthfeel is just right. It's sweet and bitter. Again, balance. Excellent brew."
"O-Great example of the style and very drinkable"
"This has got to be, hands down, the best amber I've ever had to date. When it comes to an amber ale all I really, really want is a crisp, clean beer with a good taste with a little bit of bite to it, and this beer fits the mold perfectly. Sadly this beer isn't readily available in Vancouver (from what I know); if I had my way, it would definitely be my go-to amber ale, absolutely."
"Mouthfeel is about as good as it gets for the s. Lighter side of medium. Carbonation level is good with a clean, strong, and bitter finish. The whole beer itself has a clean, fresh, and pure feel to it. Overall a great beer, I've had it dozens and dozens of times and it's a great representation of the style."
"O: This beer really impressed me. Instantly I fell in love with it and grabbed a second. I thought it had the perfect balance between the big maltiness with the hop finish. A definite go to beer for me."
"Overall - It's not bad but it's not really my thing.."
"I got a massive three fingers of thick tawny head with great retention from my pour. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose had a citrusy scent up front, underlain by a mild biscuit maltiness. I was beginning to slaver from the smell. Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but the hops were right there on the tongue. I began to feel better right away. I should mention that the hops worked well with the malt to create a slightly bitter honey-like sweetness in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry and very tasty. The sticky lacing that began to appear was going to require a jackhammer to remove."
"Bottom line, I like it better than I thought I would, and I would drink it again."
"A great amber ale that I will continue to patronize. A well done craft ale. Highly recommended."
"O- Pretty well crafted brew. For some reason I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised by this one."
" The taste has a nice fruity yeast tang in the initial entry with slightly piney flavor from the hops with mild floral accents that is indicative of noble hops. The taste has a spicy finish after mild malt which helps to augment the yeast flavor with gentle sweet flavors. The beer has a good amount of flavor but the bitterness is smooth which adds to the overall refreshing quality of the amber. I liked this and the finish is nice and crisp with lager like finish. This comes off like an amped up anchor steam to me with some lager qualities but nice spice and yeast flavor-it is a pleasure to drink."
"Pours a clear amber color with a decent white head. The smell are of floral hops with a nice caramel malt backbone. The feel is medium. The taste is of floral hops with a nice malty after flavor, not too hoppy, but still pretty good."
"overall - a real quality ale with lots of flavor, but also very drinkable. highly recommend."
"Copper orange in color with a reddish hue and a deep haze. Poured with a stiff, frosty white head that reduced to a thick cap that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet caramel malt aromas with lightly pungent herbal and citrus hops. On the lighter side of medium bodied and creamy smooth. Sweet caramel malt flavors combined with floral hops from beginning to end. The pungent aroma translates into a similarly pungent taste up front but fades as the assertive carbonation rolls through. Finishes with a light bitter pine hop aftertaste. A very smooth, pleasantly drinkable red ale."
"The froth didn't last very long."
"Overall it is a refreshing, social beer; doesn't require much thought."
"O: enjoyable red ale. It's dryness drinks more like a pale ale than the wetter red ales I've had. Not at the same level as Bear Republic's Red Rocket or Ithaca's Cascade, but tasty and interesting nonetheless. Could easily drink a few of these."
"Notes: Definately a straight forward beer very tasty and drinkable as well. Cheers."
"D: Well crafted and reallly good when it's fresh on cask."
"Taste is also biscuity with a sort of weird metallic undertone. Feel is pretty sharp with high carbonation. I wanted to keep drinking if only to figure out what I was tasting. After a few sips I got into it a bit more. It's fairly unique and every now and then I like this kind of taste and feel. North Coast has a good thing going on."
"This is how beer should be as a standard. Easy drinking , flavoursome , dare I say , yummy ."
"O: Great to look at. Smells wonderful, and the flavor has just the right amount of hops. One of my favorites."
"Medium mouthfeel that is very drinkable. Would gladly have this again."
"Overall this is a big disappointment, it really felt like a good beer was coming but this did not deliver."
"D - Simple but drinkable red ale. A bit more hoppy than I had anticipated. I'm not really a big fan of hoppy beers, and there isn't a lot going on outside of the hops here, but this ale went down pretty easy."
"Thanks to DW for the trade. Looking forward to trying something from North Coast. Poured from the stubby bottle into a standard pint. Appetizing red ale color with a nice one finger head. Fruity, slightly hoppy aroma. Hop forward flavors with that ""red"" factor balanced by sweet malts. Just basic for me but certainly would try again."
"A solid Amber Ale with a complex flavor profile-quite tasty. The aroma could use a bit more hop character, but on the whole, it's a good beverage, and a great example of the style."
"12 oz into a bottle...let me say that I'm usually pretty hard on red ales, it not being one of my favorite styles. However, I do like this beer. Plenty of head on top of a bright burgundy body. Spicy hops in the nose and following up more of the same on the tongue, with a great malt backbone that forms the dominating tone of this brew;s flavor. Great mouthfeel. Would expect no less from NorthCoast. Cheers. Recommended."
"Overall-Really liked this beer. Bought it as a single, but will definitely buy this in 6 packs as well. Good year round beer."
"I've had this beer elsewhere, and I've tasted the same soap taste. I was hoping it was different this time since everyone else seems to enjoy this beer so much. In the end, I think I have to disagree. This beer is simply alright in my book. In a market with so many delicious ambers, this one fails in comparison."
"Drinkable little beer, and probably more so for the clear and thin palate. It doesn't feel like a really well-rounded brew, but it certainly has enough character to make it worthwhile drinking a few."
"I have to write this sentence to meet the 250-character limit."
"O - Super tasty, big flavour but a delicate hop malt balance, all of the parts add up to a beer I need more of"
"Overall: This is a complex ale that should not be underestimated. It is easy to drink and goes well with any meal that comes to my mind. Right here, North Coast Brewing demonstrates the uniqueness of their grains and hops, which do not really taste like any other West Coast beer."
"Hmm - unsure about this one, tastes almost like a past-it IPA. This beer is not the reason NC are imported to Aus (!). Would love to have fresh, but that really ain't gonna happen here :-0"
"Twelve ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. A translucent copper/red color with about a half inch of bubbly, off-white head. Looks decent and leaves a little lacing as the head fades. Smells a bit skunked though, for lack of a better term. Perhaps algae-like would be a slightly better adjective, but still not a completely pleasant scent. It does have some faint grassy hops and toasty malts behind it though, which are welcoming. Tastes a bit bland, with a bit more emphasis on the malt than in the nose, the same bit of hop character, and that subtle off flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and under carbonated. Overall, not a beer I’ll pick up again as there are some other options that just sit better with me. I'm not disappointed I tried it though."
"I tried this for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was responsible for giving me a greater appreciation for dry-hopped reds - they're quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. While the hops and malts are at center stage in this one, they don't obscure the fact that a complex set of flavors is at work here. I noted a mildly spicy aftertaste. All in all, a great brew and a good value."
"O: nice representation of the style and quite enjoyable"
"The cpj"
"Overall- This beer just didn’t do it for me, it could have just been a bad bottle I suppose. But nothing about it really called for a revisit, except to see if it was a bad bottle."
"This brew pours a very light see through amber hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger frothy head and sporadic lacing here and there,the smell is pineapple,piney hops,lychee and boiled candy,it has a light bodied well carbonated mouthfeel and has tastes of citrus,passionfruit,lychee,goosberries,boiled candy and finishes with a hit of piney hop bitterness and overall i was definately hoping for way more abit of a let down and couldnt recommend."
"Citrus and piney hops are most present in the taste. Both combine into a very strong hop character for this beer, with a nice balanced bitterness that would satisfy any hop head. Lemon and orange rind come to mind as well, especially in the dry mouthfeel. Its creamy and dry at the same time, making for an interesting feel. All around its not necessarily balanced due to the bitterness of the hops, but it is very delicious. The hops are definitely potent all the way through and really combine nicely to form a very solid pale ale."
"A decent amber ale but nothing special. Easy drinking and a good autumn beer."
"Carbonation is too high in my opinion."
"On tap. Pours a semi translucent dirty copper color with an inch of head. Some lacing. Aroma is malty and floral. Grape aromas as well as maybe some apple. Taste is almost like a light apple cider. Very malty. More apple flavor at the end. Somewhat floral but not as much as i thought it would. Crisp, refreshing, easy to drink and flavorful. Slight bitterness to this one. Overall, its a solid red ale that's perfect for the summer. Worth getting again."
"Caramel everywhere in this beer. Caramel color with small head, nice lacing. Smells of carmel and malt. Tastes of caramel and apple, quite nice. Nice carbonation on the tongue. Very nicely balanced. Bitter aftertaste that I could live without, but overall a very nice beer."
"O - Quite tasty and flavourful. A solid amber with a nice dose of hops to keep you entertained. Easily sessionable and definitely a pleasurable experience. I would certainly take down a 6-er of this any day."
"This beer enjoyed at the abner pub in Norman, OK. The beer pours a nice red amber color with a trace of white foamy head that leaves good lacing on the way down. The aroma has malty caramel notes, but is quite light. The taste starts very caramel sweet and then finishes malty with a slight hint of citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated. Overall worth a try."
"This beer poured out as a nice red color, the head was a light orange and was pretty large at first. The lacing was good too. The smell of the beer has a good mix of malts and hops from what I could tell. The taste of te beer followed the same basic structure as the aroma did. Malts and some piney hops. The mouthfeel was pretty good too, just a bit heavier might have been good here. Overall a decent brew worth trying again."
"Overall-balance balance balance, it’s something more and more ignored in the Craft movement, which is shameful since it’s so important. This is a very good Amber, worth your time."
"this beer goes down smoothly and is a good mix between red ale and IPA, wich is two of my favourite styles of beer."
"Overall, a delightfully hoppier amber with great West Coast character. Great for meals and equally sessionable. Thumbs up!"
"Finally taking the plunge after passing on this so many times at the store. It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, grapefruit, flowers, and pine. The taste holds notes of grapefruit, orange peel, pine, light caramel, and grass. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid red, but nothing that makes me wanna come back and grab another one. Not bad, though."
"O: Very nice brew. A real good amber at a decent price. I'll have this again."
"The taste is really like it smells with the earthy hops showing a bit more than can be detected in the nose. Grassy pith finish that lingers. A candy taste like old school hard ribbon candy. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a solid malt chewiness."
"Food Pairing: Pork, BBQ, Sandwiches (this would be a nice bread, meat, cheese beer.), Roasted Chicken, Mild Cheese, Ham, Earthy Greens"
"This is one of my favorite beers. I really enjoy the malt and hop notes that this beers brings. Nice head with a equally good bitterness to it. Very balanced. I really like how hopped, malted, and creamy/frothy this beer is. One of my top 3 if stranded on an island."
"Wonderful beer. Picked up a single at CostPlus. Shoutout to CostPlus WorldMarket where my dogs at?! I wish I would have bought a six pack. As I said its very drinkable. The alcohol is not too empowering but makes itself known which like. It really reeks of hops but doesn't taste like a hoppy beer. I really liked this one, go pick it up at your local WorldMarket. Stay thirsty my friends!"
"Overall: Flavor really lasts with this one. Overall a decent easy drinking beer."
"O - I read a lot of hype over this beer, so I am a little let down. I am particularly fond of good hoppy red/amber ales. I think this could be a little better balanced. However, it is a very crisp, hoppy and refreshing beer, and these are my biggest criteria for a go to beer. Well done, North Coast."
"Finish: Earthiness with fresh grass and a hardy citric that lingers for some time"
"Overall, it is a good beer. To me this beer screams that it needs a pairing with a cheese or meat. I definitely think that would make this beer a better experience."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable and possible sessionable as well given the ABV content. The unique flavor allows Red Seal to stand out among the other Amber ales. Furthermore, I think that the Red Coast Red Seal is certainly worth a look because it is a good cheap alternative to Oskar Blue's Gordon because of it's price."
"d: again..this brew is refreshing. the bitterness of the hops make you want another sip...though the watery taste i get towards the end makes me feel a bit more quenched. It is a bit of a tug of war. I could certainly drink a few of these, though there are things I prefer over it. Overall, a fun one to try and I'd revisit at some point down the road."
"Slainte."
"D- I love good amber ales, but this stands out. I love everything about this beer. I would drink a 6 pack any day because of how refreshing and easy drinking this perfect ale tastes!"
"D: Leaves me a bit underwhelmed... I'd rather have a DIPA anyday."
"D- I could sit with a six of this and enjoy myself. Easy to drink with quality characteristics. Solid brew!"
"Picked this one up at Trader Joes over the weekend. Poured a very solid amber color, not a lot of head. Very nice hoppy aroma. Great taste. Good amber flavor with a bitter finish from the hops. Went down smooth, good mouthfeel. Very drinkable, I'll be looking for this beer again in the near future."
"D- Definitely drinkable, and worth sitting down to have more than 1 in a row."
"Nice medium bodied not too light not too heavy. All and all a very nice American amber. I'm glad I've ventured outside of Ol' Raspy. North Coast is def no one trick pony."
"Drinkability is probably good for many people, however I found the taste uninviting and even a little off-putting. So it took me a while to finish it. I had to have some nuts with this to make it passable."
"Drinkability - This is an ok brew. Solid all around and pretty straight forward. Not the best, but far from the worst. Worth a try if it's available. I could have a few of these without fan fair no problem."
"D - I prefer a darker beer, but this definitely has the ability to be an every day beer"
"Drinkability: Now this is one that I can drink because I want more of all those hops. The bitterness is not enough to cut into the drinkability; it's the flavor and aroma hops that gets you hooked."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours clear red orange color with a 2 finger off white head with decent retention. Aromas of citrus, floral, pine, caramel, and some spices. Taste matches the nose very well, with a nice crisp clean bitterness that lingers for a bit on the finish. This goes down very well, and is very drinkable. Very nicely balanced flavors. Medium body and fairly high carbonation. Overall this is highly enjoyable, and full of flavor. Before I knew it my glass was empty. Excellent stuff."
"Beer is lead off sweet with an immediate hop character opening up on the midpalate of the beer. The finish is moderately to lightly bitter. Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied, minimal carbonation, nice connectivity. I used to have this beer on draft all the time in FL, one of the few craft beers available and the time, and I loved it. I'm glad to return to it now getting the same enjoyment from the bottle. I'd have this again."
"another solid beer from these guys, not my favorite brew from them but well worth drinking"
"Notes: A brew that I´d gladly pick up out there but that I doubt I´ll ever bring home again."
"FourthBeer potential: ABOVE AVERAGE. Not very heavy, and the hoppy character is a good complement to the maltiness expected with the style."
"drinkability: Very smooth, it was lighter than expected and very drinkable."
"D - good, but doesn't draw me back, but I would recommend it..."
"Overall, Red Seal is a pretty good example of an amber ale. It's not a potent, super flavorful brew, but it is a nice-drinking, easy-going amber ale that was well enjoyed by me."
"Highly recommended."
"D: it drank good and was tasty and crisp. I recommend it paired alongside BBQ chicken."
"A pretty good amber ale, sporting a nice hoppy edge - but nothing over the top.  It would make for a good repeat offender at the pub, I imagine, should this ever arrive in Alberta as such - I only suggest this particular conceit as a concerned, beer-appreciating citizen, y'know."
"This is a classic craft beer.. great for people being introduced to the craft scene."
"Summary: Good session beer, that won't bore. Good for everyday drinking"
"d - Something I definitely enjoyed, nothing crazy but a good beer."
"Drinkability- While most beers I rate on BA are not my first time tasting, this one was and am shocked of how great it was! Not a beer for everyone. If your into English Ales/Lagers or Brown Ales, this one is for you."
"My ""go to"" for the style. Consistently pours with a white, creamy head which is thick and stays around nicely. Drinkability is outstanding, even for the style. A great summer beer with plenty of balance and enough going on in mouthfeel to not disappoint or bore you."
"Notes: This is a great drinking beer with very good balance and flavor."
"The beer pours a slightly hazzy copper color, with a white head. The aroma is of citrus hops and caramel malt. The taste at first is bitter, and then switches to a malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a medium light. Overall this is a drinkable beer with the way it finishes sweet."
"D: This went well with my meal and was very refreshing. I've only ever had a few beers on cask so it's hard to say exactly how this matches up, but I was impressed with it at the time so there you go. I would order it again."
"Overall, what was most striking about this beer was the wonderful symmetry of the hops and the malts. As suggested by the label, the brew is created with only the most basic ingredients, and that idea certainly comes through to the finish."
"It's about as drinkable as it gets, especially in light of its sessionable 5.5 abv. It has substance and a distinctive flavor, but is never aggressive."
"This would be a great session ale. It is flavorful without being filling. It is more on the average side of beer because of the lighter body."
"Very smooth drinker -- citrus flavor might wear after a while, but still very enjoyable."
"Easily drinkable"
"D: I've heard rumors that this beer is now about half the beer it once was after some drastic recipe changes. I wasn't into craft beer back in those days, so I can't judge. However, I DO know that the version I drank was sub-standard."
"D - This beer would have been more drinkable if it werent for the bitterness at the end. It was also a bit watery. I had high hopes for this beer after having other beers by North Coast, and I was sadly disappointed. This beer was alright, but I dont think I will be picking up any more."
"Final Notes: My first sort of disappointment from North Coast. It's not a bad beer, but for this price you could probably find a better amber ale. It's OK, but I'm not likely to buy it again."
"D - reasonable...probably a lot better fresher."
"A lovely orange beer smelling of grassy hops and caramel malt. The taste itself is very sweet, with some fruity esters and spicy hop sneaking in over the caramel. The mouthfeel is kind of a mess, as I was expecting more of a clean finish--it gets bitter and sort of unbalanced towards the end--but overall it's a nice solid red ale."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy orange brown with a finger of ecru foam that fades into a thin layer upon the surface of the beer. The aroma is of nice fruit esters, particularly of red apple and orange zest. In addition there is a nice aroma of caramel that when paired with the apple smells wonderful. The first taste hits with a strong bitter flavor that does slowly fade away, but yet still leaves you with the fact that it is a bitter beer. Though the beer is nice and crisp there are notes of both cloves and caramel. The mouthfeel, while well carbonated, is in my opinion a bit on the watery side, but not too much that the beer is unpleasant. Despite all of the set backs it's a very nice drinking beer and one that I wouldn't have a problem telling people to get. The only concern I have is that it's not really a Red ale it's more of an EPA, or APA. But as a beer, it's not bad."
"overall: I like this beer, it has a real unique flavour that I can never quite put my tongue on. A very dynamic beer, it has a polished feel that seems to be missing in many macro brews."
"D - This is a drinkable red ale with a thick malt character. The hops fall a but too far on the musty side if the spectrum for my taste, but they serve their purpose by balancing the malt. A reasonably nice amber ale, but not nearly as exciting as the some other north coast beers."
"d again the carbonation makes this less than a superstar beer. It is highly sessionable unless you find burping to be a big problem."
"This is a very good session beer and another great beer by North Coast. Keep em' coming."
"A hop-forward Amber that isn't too big to be enjoyed in quantity. Now only if North Coast would date their products so that I could confidently enjoy this at home."
"Overall, a good-tasting and well-balanced beer that is rather subtle in all its traits, making it easy to drink several of these at once, if you wanted to (""sessionable"")."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've heard that this brewery makes quality beer, and as far as this one's concerned, it appears to be true. One of the better red ales that I have had."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Not sure about freshness but if it is a julian code on the bottom then this bottle is four and a half months old. oops. Pours a cloudy amber orange. Moderate carbonation is visible as well as bits and clouds of yeast. 3/4 inch of head forms and quickly dissipates. The nose is nicely balanced with fresh and spicy hops up front and a more subtle malt. Medium body. Carbonation is a bit low. A good dose of hops greets the palate; not too much. Just enough for you to appreciate the flavor and then it gets balanced out by a fairly clean malt. Definitely session material. Despite being well past its prime the hops are still relatively lively with a mild resiny texture. I had this on tap a few months back and that was definitely a better experience. I won't be too harsh since I can imagine what this is like when it is fresher."
"O: Easy to drink, but nothing special. Remember it as better, maybe I had a fresh bottle as It feels this doesn't get better with time."
"On hand pump at the Brick Store Pub. Pours beautifully bright with a nice amber color and a creamy head and excellent lacing. The smell exhibits alight slightly sour graininess, some gentle sweetness, and some earthy hops. Quite a nice taste on cask. Slightly sweet and earthy, with nice earthy hops, and a firm but mild bitterness, which lingers nicely. Firm, but with a soft finish in the mouth. Quite pleasant."
"I'd never refuse one, but I wouldn't have dreams about it."
"This was a solidly less-than-average beer with a pretty label and too much hype. It had an attractive copper color and a puffy head that looked comfy enough to float a beach raft, but it had an odd lack of aroma. I detected some soap and some yeast, and a little something that could be construed as malt. But the taste... what taste? Aside from a flabby, soapy, bitter flavor, this was nearly taste-free. It had the nippy fizz of an amber, but that's where the fun ended. Phooey."
"RJT"
"M-D: The mouthfeel is very smooth all the way from the tongue, down the palate, all the way to the stomach. I can definitely easily drink this beer. This beer would definitely be part of another session, another day."
"I had thought this was an APA before...but saw it is an amber/red ale now. When I taste it, I can see why it's a red ale, even if it has the hoppiness of a typical APA."
"A decent balance of mild hops and malt flavor make this beer a pleasant SoCal beer. Not much complexity, but the simplicity definitely works for the beer. A smooth carbonation with a mild bitterness. Definitely a solid brew."
"d - A decent red ale. A nice combo of hops and malts, would try again."
"Taste-Spicy, toasted malt, rye notes, and a nice hoppy bite that complements, rather than overpowers. Nicely balanced and sessionable. A good match for a cheeseburger or a pizza."
"All in all an excellent representation of the style and very easy drinking as well."
"Feel wise this is crisp but a little powder. However, this is still a refreshing brew."
"I've enjoyed this on tap before but usually avoided seconds in my quest to try everything else available. probably a mistake, since this is a good, good beer. Perhaps next time I'll eschew the variety and go with something that's just good. Like this."
"This has become my favorite ""go to"" beer. It has beautiful reddish color with a perfect amount of head. A good hoppy upfront taste with a soothing after taste. Very well balanced. Not complex, just a straight-forward enjoyable beer. I continue to search, but have yet to find a better everyday beer."
"This is pretty true to the style with a nice color and decent flavors. Definitely not my favorite amber ale, but a solid brew to keep in the fridge, especially if you're planning on having burgers or other bbq'd food. More good stuff from North Coast."
"D - this is a pretty solid session beer. Nice flavor profile, but I don't think I would have more than a couple just for the sake that I thought this could have been a little more flavorful."
"D - This is one of the better offerings from North Coast; I appreciate its understated qualities (by North Coast standards) and that it is so well-balanced."
"Overall, not the tastiest beers around, but definitely a beer you could drink exclusively for the entire night and not be disappointed."
"D - Extremely drinkable. It is extremely hoppy but it doesn't leave the tongue numb. It's medium bodied and very dry and crisp and I imagine you could drink a few of these in a sitting if you wanted to. A very, very, very good brew and the best I've tried from North Coast (the others I've tried include Rasputin, Pranqster, and Old Stock). Will DEFINITELY be getting this again. I think this might be my very favorite beer."
"Tastes a little washed out. I honestly thought I'd never say this, but it's short on malt. And I'm almost never feeling that way with these types of beers. I recall liking this beer much more in the past. Maybe it just suffered from being poured after the Acme IPA, which I thought was a bit more flamboyant (but hardly a monster). I don't know."
"D: Feels likes it's a malty adjunct. Wasn't great, big let down."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and will gladly be drinking the rest of the pack."
"Rolled through a few bottles of this recently. A nice beer but unfortunately the taste and mouthfeel don't hold up to the malty goodness of the smell. The smell is wonderful. Very concentrated malts along with nice balancing hops. I expect the flavor to be more intense. Instead it is a bit watery which is exacerbated by the early carbonation. As the bubbles ease, there is a bit more flavor but I want more. A beer that has a smell for deep thoughts but the flavor is a little bit simple. At the right price I still would enjoy this beer."
"Overall a simply average beer. Nothing really stands out to make it memorable."
"Reddish amber white head. smells of malted barley and fresh hops. tastes like a pale ale should. piney, slightly bitter but malty and lively. mod-light body make drinkabality very nice. This is a great session beer. A true Go-To."
"On tap into a pint glass at Map Room...Pours a light amber, mostly gold light white head, nothing special...Aroma is light rye with hops. Taste is mostly hops, but not tasty. The feel is ok, not very drinkable. Pretty boring in geneal, not a good effort."
"D-Really let down by this one. I expected a lot more from it/ North Coast. Just a really bland, almost macro seeming version of a pale ale even though it's supposed to be an amber."
"Really great Pale Ale (West Coast style), well balanced and full of complex flavors."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours copper with a one finger white head that lingers. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of hops with a small hint of malt. The flavor was of milds hops and a partial malt aftertaste. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was very nice for a red ale. It was more like a light IPA in my opinion, but still nice. It is worth trying for any IPA or red ale lover out there."
"Pours a clear coppery-red in color. Aroma gives hints of bready sweetness & hoppy snap. Upon tasting, flavor follow with breadiness in the aroma, coupled with a nice balancing hop bitterness on the finish. A simple yet deceptively tasty ale my friends and I have tried to replicate in our homebrewing."
"D/M: Very drinkable... but so is water, and Gatorade... and they may have more palate flavor than this."
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. This is a great all-around beer that I could recommend to just about anyone."
"12oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. No freshness dating on the label. Poured a hazy copper with a frothy, one inch off-white head. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim with some bands and spots of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose suggests caramel/toffee, a hint of citrus, a faint earthy hops presence and a slightly metallic character. Taste consistent with nose; however it's a bit muted and there is also something of a spicy character - not sure if it's the carbonation projecting into the flavor profile, but that's what I get. Finishes with a light lingering bitterness; however, metallic quality from the nose seems to have dissipated. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation. Not my favorite amber, but solid, respectable and flavorful at 5.5%."
"D: Very well balanced -- listed as a red ale, but taste more like a pale ale. Nice session type beer to have more than one."
"D - ya its pretty drinkable"
"O Definitely recommend. The draft version has more hop aroma and flavor than the bottle version, but both are good beers."
"This was recommended to me by the bartender at my local bar. I think I've had it in bottles and I'm also a fan of some of the other North Coast Brewery beers but I was not that thrilled with this one. Color was a little light for an Amber/Red, more like a pale. Good carbonation but neither the maltiness or the hoppines jumped out at me. A good session beer but not too exciting."
"D - Good drinkability, easy to drink, not too filling, lighter without sacrificing taste"
"The May bonus selection for the BOTM."
"Really good atmosphere. Appearance in pretty simple, but deep rich color and great lacing. Nose is also simple but very rich and full. It does what it does well. Flavor has a certain complexity of grain components, with some subtle spice and a little citrus. Really dry feel, but light and refreshing. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Appearance is light brown with a red hue, lots of carbonation. The head is white, about 2 finger high and laces the glass. Smell is nice, with hops standing out. Taste is good. Not much bite from the hops. Smooth and malty taste. Very drinkable."
"D- Low ABV, refreshing hop flavor, and thin body combine to make it easy to drink. It seems like this beer would be appropriate for most any occasion. I could probably drink a six-pack by myself and still want more!"
"D: One of the best examples of of American Amber I've tried. Refreshing without sacrificing flavor. A perfect session beer."
"D: a great example of what an American red ale can be; hoppy, malty, and refreshing all at once. Definitely a session-worthy brew"
"D - A good beer. Not over the top like some American Pale Ales. Balanced and refreshing. Good by itself or with food. Doesn't wear out your taste buds. Just makes them very happy!"
"This is definitely a West Coast interpretation of an American amber ale. While not terribly complex, it was one of the more notable session beers I have tried in a while."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. The beer has a nice light brown color with plenty of carbonation rising withing. On top sits a modest head of tan bubbles. It leaves a very slight coat on the sides of the glass. It has a deep floral hop aroma that is kind of woodsy. Behind this is the scent of pale malts (not wheat, but other light colored grains). The flavor is very balanced. The malts are bready and slightly sweet. The hops provide just a bit of bitterness to the finish. I wouldn't call it a bitter beer; the hop level is just right for a pale ale like the Red Seal. The mouthfeel is just right for the style as well; medium body, light carbonation, and a normal level of coating. It's a bit sticky but not sweet or sugary. It's supremely drinkable. This is the kind of beer almost and craft beer drinker could enjoy multiple rounds of. Plus, it's appropriate year round. I like this beer a lot. I've bought it in the past and will certainly continue to do so. Give it a try if you haven't yet."
"The body was good, full and smooth. Drinkability was very good, this is a day long partner of a brew. It's been a while since I've had one of these beauties, and Ill try not to let it be so long again."
"D - Good beer, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again."
"I just can't get into this one. The first sip shows a lot of promise but it disintegrates quickly. I would like to try it on tap sometime and hope for a different effect."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color with a 1-finger off-white soapy head. Tiny bit of sediment seen floating. Stays in decent shape the whole time, leaves a tiny amount of lacing. Smell is good, hops and caramel, pretty spot-on for the style. Taste really doesn't do anything for me, much too watery and bland. It definitely could use some more hops, the slight flavors I pick up are a light fruity malt and a bit of bread in the aftertaste. I think I'm even getting a hint of booze which to me is unacceptable for a 5.5%. The hops along with some buttery-like sweetness seem to make themselves more known about half-way through which helps this beer a bit. Mouthfeel is definitely thin, a watery malty taste lingers afterwords. Aftertaste starts to reminds me of Magic Hat's #9 for some reason. Easy to drink, quite inoffensive, not terrible, somewhat refreshing, but overall pretty boring and watery. You can get a 6-pack of Nugget Nectar for 2 bucks more than a 6-pack of this. A pretty easy decision if you ask me."
"D - The drinkability for this one is there...I would have more than two of these but it would not be my go to"
"a good, hoppy amber which sets itself apart from others due to its spicy and pepper hop character."
"D - Falls between an amber and an APA, which works out nicely for what could be a decent session beer."
"A clear amber color body with a thin off white head , medium carbonation , little to no lacing . Aroma is hoppy , pine and spicy hops with a toasty bread dough malt sweetness . Flavor is bitter spruce hops , spicy with hints of citrus , malty backbone is toasty and moderately sweet nice level of bitterness , good balance , long hoppy finish , smooth crisp clean mouthfeel , I would call it full bodied for the style. Very drinkable and a very good APA ,"
"pours a beautiful amber copper with a fluffy, one finger off white. smell is wonderful with aromas of granny smith apples, citrus hops, and a solid malt back. taste is malty, stingy sweet alpha acids and pine hops. simplicity and balance. lingering pleasant bitterness. incredibly drinkable. a sure go to beer."
"~Cheers"
"Drinkability is super high, this is an outstanding beer made to drink all night, and if I wasn't at Bailey's, I would certainly be doing so from this cask."
"A nice and drinkable Red Ale."
"D: I really liked this ale - a really solid amber, with a great sweet flavor of vanilla caramel notes and a nice lemony, sharp bitterness to keep everything balanced. Subtle, flavorful, and fantastic."
"the bittering hops on top of a watery and somewhat balancing maltiness doesnt do much for me. its drinkable, but given the option, id quickly choose to try something else. when i appreciate red ales a lot more, i will revisit this one."
"Pours a red amber with a nice white head and little lacing. Aroma is of slightly-sweet amber malt and a bit of citrus hops. Taste has a bit of citrus hops along with caramel. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and pretty typical for the style; drinkability about the same--nice and crispy without all that much coming through."
"D i could enjoy a more than one, it seems like an early summer late spring beer. for the price, a great staple"
"Pours a really thick head, nothing frothy but thick and luscious. A golden amber red body, thick with nice color. As always, my sense of smell is awful, but mostly just a malt aroma. Simple yet solid, I'd say, or maybe complexly simple. As the bottle touts, the beer contains only water, malted barley, hopes, and yeast, so they take pride in this. Very good body to it, and easily drinkable, probably anytime of the year."
"Could have sworn this was an IPA with the hop taste and smell, not that I'm complaining...this is a great brew that is a regular in my fridge."
"D- Good beer, but not something I would go out of my way for. The carbonation really takes away from this beers' potential, but all in all a drinkable beer!"
"Deep amber color with a chunky white head that melts into a fine lace. Yeasty malt aroma with some mild lemony hops. Malt dominates the flavor. Dry, slightly nutty, with muted fruit esters reminiscent of apricot and peach. Dusty and yeasty. Hops are mostly bittering, with a dry, lemony quality-- just enough to clean up the finish and bring the malt flavors out. A classic west coast style quaffer from one of Norcal's best breweries."
"Indeed, a fine American Red Amber Ale."
"Overall - A good experience"
"D: OVer all a very nice pale ale, will definitly buy again. Would like to try on tap."
"This is one of those beers that can be crossed off the list. I wasn't very impressed. Would I have another if someone bought it for me? Absolutely. I wouldn't seek it out on my own though."
"D: Very disappointing. Weak smell, mild flavor, weird finish."
"OVERALL: Excellent beer. This is one of the few North Coast beers that is relatively easy to find here in Chicago (You would be surprised at how difficult it is to find Scrimshaw here). It is a standard for me, for good reason. Delicious, not too high in ABV, fantastic session IPA."
"Value: $9.99 for a six pack. Price should come down a buck in my opinion, though obviously that's not North Coast's fault."
"Body was medium, crisp carbonation throughout and a somewhat creamy feel. Great beer, measures up with Sierra Nevada Pale."
"D - good, nothing outstanding or fancy off the cask"
"Pours light brown with a lingering white head. The aroma is citrus and pine hops with some malt as well. The flavor is similar with strong citrus hops and a nice malt backbone. Medium body and high carbonation. Very good beer, kind of a mix between an American Red Ale and an American Pale Ale. Great take on the style."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no lot code or expiration date. Sampled on Christmas Day 2009. The pour is amber-red with nice clarity and about a half-inch of creamy, foamy head with clinging lacing. The carbonation remains active throughout the tasting. The aroma is mostly hopped but there is a kind of cherry-like note in there. The mouthfeel runs about medium. The taste is full of bitter hops, caramel malts, and a mixture of toffee and honey. Pretty nice."
"Drank it quick"
"Bam, taste, like a hybrid Pale/Amber Ale. Has the malt backbone of an Amber, but doesn't come off heavy, earthy or woody, and has the hop presence of west coast pales. Develops as you drink it, and makes you want another. A good session+ amber beer, made from what used to be one of the best breweries in the world. Those days are long gone, and there is no reason to visit their expensive low quality taphouse they have going. Just buy their beer at the supermarket, better that way."
"Thoughts- This is a hoppy red ale."
"D- This is another one done in my book. Flavors stand out in this beer and not always good. Not a bad beer but there are many others to pick from that are better in the style."
"D - Very drinkable and very good drink. Would definitely drink more in the near future."
"D: This beer is interestingly spiced, for a sessionable beer a touch overspiced but it does go down easily with a bit of a kick. Nice to have one or two."
"D: This is a very good Pale/Red Ale, kind of straddling the borderline of the two styles. I don't now why I haven't had it in such a long time, good flavour and well priced."
"One of the best Amber beers that I have tried. It has a lot of citrus that is reminiscent of earl grey tea, and it finishes with a medium-light bitterness, then the flavor lightens and dissipates. It is a dark amber color with a thin white head. It smells malty and citrusy. Overall, this beer is excellent for its style and would be a great refreshment during the summer. it is also nice that it is reasonably priced!"
"D - Still pretty good, but I'd proly order the regular Red Seal 9 of 10 times. Something is lost here with the cask - shocking as most beers are stunners on the beer engine."
"The feel of this beer is light but does tease at being a heavier flavor is to come. Have a bit of a robust signature but does not take too much away from it's quiet presence. It is enjoyable and is not too overwhelming on the pallet."
"Obviously I really enjoyed this beer. It's what I would consider a beer advocate's go-to brew. Along the lines of Stone Levitation, a very solid, slightly under appreciated, delicious beer."
"This beer pours a hazy orange with a small white head that left minimal lacing on the pint glass. The nose is weak, mostly some spicy hops, some grapefruit, and malt. It tastes much more maltier than I remember. The hops don't really jump out as this beer is mostly dominated by the malt. The mouthfeel is pretty creamy. This beer is very drinkable given its average abv. Overall, I was disappointed in this beer, it was nothing like I remember it being. This was one of my early favorite craft brews but now it just seems bland and too dominated by malt to be considered one of the essential American Pale Ales. Maybe my bottle was a little old. One day I'll drink another and update this post if needed."
"Not what I was expecting...Smooth, malty, and creamy with very little hop influence. Pours a clear dark red color with a bit of head. Nice thick chewy malt flavors abound. Definitely drinkable and a bit on the sweet side. I'd definitely go back to it."
"D- I drank this one as the beer got warmer. I will say that the best flavors were on the colder side/right after opening where as the beer towards room temp began showing its ugly side"
"D: High drinkability. This beer is a good example of a amber/red."
"D: I only had one bottle, but could easily have thrown back a few more of these while watching the Pats beat up on the Jets."
"Nice piney hop finish that kinda lingers on the palate. Beer had good carb and was medium bodied. Very plain compares with my first homebrew, but with less taste."
"D-mediocre Amber ale at best. But an exceedingly good APA. That is what I thought I was drinking from the label. It was not until I saw the brewer's website and the style classification on this site. I liked this beer. A lot. But, it is not a very good Amber. Not dark enough and not enough malt presence in the aroma or the taste. If an APA, I would rate it 4.25 overall."
"Tastes significantly hoppy, herbal tea overtones with strong citric secondary hop and plenty of bitterness. Soft clean malt with soft roast and softer nut undertones. Soft fruit ester. Smooth mellow overall. Hop bitterness balances. Finishes with moderate bitterness. Spicy leafy bite. Tastes good. Feels good. Good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is light and very thin, almost watery. Easy to drink."
"A very drinkable amber ale, easily sessionable, not my favorite from North Coast but very good and recomended! Drinkability increases as does the creaminess as it warms."
"Drinkability is good. Easy to down a few of these. It's a good beer, probably a repeat buy. Great for the fall."
"D- Really spectacular beer for a tough style to master."
"Not a bad bev, but not a favorite. Seems a little unbalanced."
"Drinkability is high for the style as I like the boldly hopped twist on the style. 5.0 in drinkability for my preference but it's more like a 3.5 according to the style."
"Drinkability is OK. I'm not much on the style but I think there are better ambers."
"Overall very solid and a nice sessionable, and malty ale. I was actually quite happy with this one and glad to have grabbed one for sure."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full with some creaminess."
"I don't think this beer is an amber or red ale - simply a pale ale. From that perspective, I think its okay. But if I'm looking for my hop beat down, I'd probably look elsewhere."
"D: This is an excellent session beer."
"Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale from North Coast Brewing Co. is a very good beer. The color is absolutely beautiful. On the tongue I can detect a malty, earthy combination. A few hops are present but nothing to satisfy a hophead. The drinkability is high and I could drink a few of these. A nice amber ale."
"Poured a dark orange/brownish color with a one finger fizzy head that dissipates quickly. The beer left no lacing behind at all on my glass, not the most appetizing looking of beers. Smell and taste is pretty good. Malty sweetness up front, some fruits in here too, a good hop balance to the malts and a slight hint of raisin. The mouthfeel is also good, medium bodied with a creamy feel, it is also pretty highly carbonated which throws the mouthfeel off a bit, but still good, mouth is coated with good bitterness and no alcohol is picked up. Drinkability is decent, toward the end of the glass the sweetness started to overtake the beer and it started to lose a lot of flavor, still a good amber, not sure when I will get this one again."
"From the bottle into a pint glass. Poured a hazy copper color with a nice big white head. The head reduced to almost nothing but was barely there. Left little to no lacing. The smell was hoppy at first, more hoppy than I was expecting. The taste was hoppy and sweet, had a ibt of caramel in there. Pretty good stuff. I've been wanting to try this for a while so I'm glad I finally did. I'd pick it up again no problem."
"D: Very. Great for an almost hop head I think."
"Drank it fast and then had another. Well worth buying."
"Color is amber-copper, translucent, with an off-white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was light with notes of orange and pink grapefruit citrus and caramel malt. Flavor was mild, but pleasant. Bready malt flavor up front with a light citrus and spice hops flavor coming through in the middle and a dry, bready malt finish. Aftertaste was light, a bit grassy/spicy. Nice balance in flavor, but could be a bit more pronounced. Medium body was noticeable in the mouthfeel, smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall, although a bit mellow in flavor for me, this was an easy drinking beer, not overpowering in flavor or ABV. Could have several."
"Drinkability: while I call this far more drinkable than most other beers of the style, I don't see myself drinking them all night. I'd have no problem ordering a second pint, however, when presented in the correct context; I bet this beer is great with a meal."
"Nice drinkability. Hop bite lasts a long time and can get old fast. Would benefit from a cleaner finish. Still a really solid hoppy beer."
"This is an American amber that is an interesting example of the style. The beer is gold amber with a white head. The head leaves lovely lasting lace down the sides. The aroma is yeasty with a hint of fruit. The taste is fruity, malty, nutty. The yeast resembles apricots or maybe peaches. This is very drinkable beer. I think the yeast profile sets this beer apart from many other reds."
"This is an extremely drinkable amber at a relatively low ABV, and I'd happily follow it up with another, so I guess it fits the definition of a session ale."
"D: Extremely good brew to just relax with or to cut through heavier, more favorful foods."
"overall more of an IPA than a Pale Ale."
"Due to the light mouthfeel this is a dangerously drinkable beer. I could drink this 'til the snowflakes fly."
"Pours a dark copper with a orange hue. Beige and bubbly head that quickly fizzles away. Has a slightly sweet aroma, but nothing too strong. Where the beer earns its points is in its taste with a perfect mix of sweet and bitter. The sweetness is a mix of spice and citrus while the hops take over at the end and can also be sensed in the beginning. Light tingly mouth feel that has the right thickness. Overall definitely a beer for any occasion."
"D - Other than Nugget Nectar, this is my favorite Amber Ale in existance, and since it is readily available in La, it is one of my go to beers; however, this is one I enjoy out of the bottle rather than tap"
"D - Easy to drink with enough going on to keep you coming back for more."
"D: This is a great beer. I will buy it again and again."
"M & D - Creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel with low to moderate carbonation. This is a tasty selection and one I will recommend to my friends."
"Notes: Possibly the standard bearer for the style."
"D: Definitely a session amber. Flavor is accessible, yet enjoyable and the body isn't too heavy. Easy to quaff, yet substantial enough to sip. A solid amber."
"Had this one the other day after work. Poured a copper color with pearly head that left decent lacing. Smelled of caramel malts, bitter hops and fruit. Tasted malty, nutty, and slightly hoppy. A little bit dry feel to it, but otherwise pretty sessionable."
"This is a very nice beer. Nothing overwhelming, easy to drink, something to enjoy multiples of while still getting good flavor."
"Very drinkable, but nothing to look forward to."
"A- Nice amber color with two finger, cream-colored head. Excellent lacing. S- Even the smell is balanced between hops and malt. Taste is very hop forward, but it mellows with the balance of the malt. Overall mouthfeel is smooth and makes me want to continue drinking. My favorite part of this beer, besides the taste, is the price. Very affordable for the quality."
"Pours a reddish amber color. There was a nice one finger head that gave way to some decent lacing. The overall aroma was of citrusy hops with malts at the end. The taste was up front of hops that were floral or citrusy. The end of the beer went to a malty taste. The mouthfeel was a little harsh...there was a slightly heavy amount of carbonation. The overall drinkability was average. The hop taste wasn't as clean as I would have liked and was a little harsher than I wanted. Overall though it was a good solid beer."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination makes this beer still pretty good. While the appearance is not overly impressive, the taste and drinkability of this beer makes it nice, especially in the warmer months."
"D: Very complex little beer, the scent and taste are not one and the same like many beers, which can be a good thing. Very drinakable."
"Crisp and refreshing with a medium amount of carbonation. A very enjoyable amber that was surprisingly easy to drink. Tried this in the bottle before and wasn't nearly as impressed as when I tried it on tap. Overall this is something I'll probably have again."
"Tastes a bit more like a red ale than an amber ale to me with a bit less toasty flavors than a typical amber and a bit more hops and a nutty malt presence. It has a fairly well rounded feel and carbonation is about right. Tastes like another solid offering from North Coast."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Awesome! This beer isn't complex, but it just had this freshness to it that I haven't had in a beer for a while. It reminded me of my first Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, only better! I loved the robust flavors of this beer, and the outstanding, overly inviting appearance! I could really enjoy a couple pints of this stuff on any given day, this beer wont leave you wanting something more robust, it's full flavored yet very drinkable. I highly recommend you try it. Cheers!"
"D: Drinks well. Would go well with a cheese platter. Not too rich or too weak."
"Thanks For Reading"
"A clear light red body with good carbonation and small head. Great citric hop notes as some sweet malt. Keeping it simple, this beer is smooth and has a medium body. The hops pass easily and are well-balanced with a chewey, semi-sweet malt base that still has some carbonated crispness and a somewhat dry backbite to complement the beer. Just a great red that is easily sessionable."
"D - Refreshing and very nice but not my fave."
"drinkability is good but i doubt i will drink this beer much in the future"
"Earthy hop with malt aroma. Tan head with poor retention. Dark copper appearance. Tastes of roasted, caramel, malt with a good balance of earthy hops. Good hop bitterness. Medium body with a mild spice finish. Good, hoppy, red ale. Nice malt/hop aroma balance. Mild hop bitterness, but finishes clean, with just a hint of warm spice. Good session beer. As the beer warmed, malty sweetness became more apparent."
"It's been a long time since I've had this one. Red Seal pours a rich mahogany with a cramy white head that slowly settles to a few millimeters thick. Carbonation is vigorous and very fine. Very nice lacing. This beer has a wonderful boquet. Toast and toffee are on the forefront, with floral, fruity aromas lingering in the back. This is one of the hoppier reds I have tried. Sweet maltiness hits the tongue with flavors of fresh-baked bread, followed by a clean, crisp hop finish. The finish is reminiscent of fresh fruit, yet with an almost steely character. This beer is very clean. It goes in and the flavors only last while on the palate. Red Seal is one of the best examples of this style of ale. Will I buy it again? Most definitely."
"D- So easy to drink. This beer is so smooth and subtle with its complexity. Not your average American Amber. Hop flavor is amazingly clean and complements every other aspect of the ale brilliantly."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear light-amber color with a solid cap of creamy beige foam. Aroma is standard red ale: crystal malt sweetness, tangy orangey hops. Flavor is a little more adventurous, with a solid caramel/maple syrup malt base and a nice dose of grapefruit and orange hops. Finish is dry and piney with a decent bitterness. Pretty much a good, drinkable red."
"Thanks to everyone in this thread for recommending this great beer! (http://beeradvocate.com/forum/read/2077723)"
"The Red Seal Ale is very drinkable, I wanted another! I could definitly have a couple in a sitting. Would absolutly have one (or two) again."
"Definitely a style I'm beginning to enjoy, however. Not quite as hop-assertive as Green Flash's Hop Head Red, but I'd definitely acquire the Red Seal again as an easy drinking alternative."
"Nice hop presence. Solid malt base...neither sweet nor dry. Long bitter aftertaste. Full bodied. Overall, a very nice pale ale beer."
"the drinkability is good, as i was saying before about it being polished, it's just clearly a well crafted beer. a red for people who aren't fans of reds."
"D: Very good. Went down easily with a slice of pizza."
"I particularly found this to be great with a dark fish such as a grainy swordfish or salmon."
"This is a tasty, easy drinking quaffer."
"D: Easy to drink, good body, great flavor that doesn't overpower, and a perfectly carbonated example of a red ale."
"D: Well, this one has a great hop nose, but the flavors just aren't very pronounced, though I don't believe that was ever the intention. Overall, I find this beer to be a little light for my tastes, but with that lightness, comes an easy drinkability. Very sessionable."
"Pours to a generous head and plenty of lacing all the way down. Color is copper-red and almost crystal clear. Aroma is of sweet and toasty malt and citrus hops. Flavor comes on strong with sweet maltiness balanced by a solid hop bitterness. Medium-light mouthfeel. Easy to quaff. Reminds me of a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but with more complexity in the malt. Good Call."
"On tap at River Street Alehouse for $2 during happy hour. Served in a standard shaker glass. Appears a hazed crimson / copper color with about a finger of creamy light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of fruity, floral hops, grapefruit, resinous pine, bitter lemon, and sweet caramelized malts and grains. Red Seal is medium bodied with ample carbonation. A pleasant bitterness stays with you into the finish. Another good one from North Coast."
"on cask at hamilton's. a nice redish hue with a nice two finger head. left some lace but not a lot. the smell wasn't very strong, and it was really hard to get a good whiff. it had an almost ""milky smooth"" quality to it. it was very very smooth, but not very flavorful. this isn't something that i'm going to go back to any time soon. somewhat of a disappointment to be perfectly honest."
"Good reddish hue with a good head retention and lacing. Appearance is fairly hazy. Excellent aroma, it's apparent that there's a fair amount of dry hopping. Flavor is predominantly from the hops, with a light maltiness and caramel flavor. If you're a fan of west coast style ales, you'll enjoy this beer. For those of us in light lager dominated countries, it's an absolute treat."
"Continuing on the previous theme, mouthfeel is light and very pleasant. This is one of the first beers I've observed with hop bitterness in the finish (albiet a small amount of it) that doesn't leave my mouth overly sticky and dry. Overall, the delicious, moderate nature of Red Seal Ale's smell, taste, mouthfeel, and ABV make this one of the most drinkable beers I've had. Highly recommended."
"Poured into a mug as a reddish amber color with two fingers of frothy white head. Smell of hops is apparent as it poured. Taste started with some creamy with some sweetish malts. Evolves into a bit of spice and then finishes off dry. Very drinkable, my glass was finished before I realized it."
"Overall, this is a good beer, but nothing about it is exceptionally notable."
"Appearance pours out a hazy dark orange with a slim head. Smell of sweet malts with hops. Taste has a good amount of hops giving it a good bite, piney and grapefruity with light caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not bad, but a little on the hoppy side for not being an IPA."
"D-Not hard to finish one"
"D- I am very pleased with this beer. superbly balanced. i could drink a lot of this. highly recommended."
"poured from 12 oz bottle into a room temp pint. poured a golden amber color, with decent head and retention. smells of grapefruit rind and honey. the taste is very interesting, definitely has some stuff going on here. nice and hoppy, with sweetness balanced by the grapefruit bitter. i don't know exactly where the sweetness is coming from but it has kind of a burnt honey flavor that is quite appealing. lingering bitterness at the end. feels medium bodied, fairly carbonated, with that crisp zing at the finish. quite drinkable, i liked the flavor and really haven't had another beer like this to compare it to. another good job by north coast."
"Leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Very tasty, pleasing brew. Balanced with a nod towards the hops."
"Overall a highly drinkable beer. Wonderfully balanced taste and flavor and a barely detectable alcohol sting makes this an easily sessionable beer."
"D- This could easily be a session beer just because of the weak taste. Would be easy to suck down a few of these without problem, but prefer something with a little more flavor."
"Overall an amazing beer, this beer truely defines the style and is easily sessionable."
"overall this is pretty powerful for a red. it's like a big slap to the palate. the hops are obvious. drinkability is great. a very balanced beer."
"This is a solid, on-point offering from North Coast - not particularly innovative, but exactly what a good American Red should taste like."
"D: It's a decent beer. The hop character is a bit too raw and unpolished."
"Overall, I'm ery pleased with this beer."
"Overall, this is a flavorful amber that doesn't go overboard on the hops and lets the caramel malts do their work. Very nice and worth a shot."
"D - It is very drinkable. I need to go get a sixer."
"Will I buy it again? No"
"Overall there isn't much here. It was okay but for about $11 for a sixer, I was expecting a lot more."
"I've had this many times, maybe possibly in the past they had twist offs, I'm impressed with this one, a solid cap. Definitely a session beer with a twist."
"Nice example of a craft pale ale. I will drink more of this."
"ah, good, not spectacular. my ability to drink these is in question."
"Drinkability- good. Overall a great beer. One that I will surely get again."
"Overall: where the hell did I put that Arrogant Bastard?"
"Big old head of two to three fingers, mainly comprised of a sheet of micro bubbles with larger bubble dimples, leaves a pretty lacing behind. Sinewy profile in the nose, direct and to the point scents of forest floor earth and underbrush, dried grapefruit and lemon peels, crème brulée and unshucked corn, the dryness gets arch at moments but always relents, a general maltiness softens the dissolve and stifles an encroaching salinity. Medium-bodied, the carbonation more of a big expansive foaminess than finer prickle. Pizza crust, wheat bread, general toasted dough quite prevalent with a noticeable grapefruit, orange citrus thrust to it. The poor brown earth, stone and matted grasses components evoke a meadow field. The dryness begins to wear out the palate after some time, here the malts a little roasted to smooth out the ride. Still, has a liveliness to it and certain purity of spirit. Could put down 2-3 of these before having to switch to something else."
"Proof that a complex, entertaining beer need not possess an off-the-charts abv. I'm impressed."
"D - A good Ale that I probably wouldn't drink everyday. I'll definitely be drinking it again though. Kinda one of those brews that when it happens it happens. Not really gonna hunt for it again."
"Overall I love this beer. I enjoy a simple, balanced amber in these times of imperials and hop head infused reds."
"D - A fine drink of beer. I'm kicking myself for not trying this sooner."
"-Dotson"
"Nikki"
"Couldn't get a clean glass. Has a smallish head in the dark bottle. A malty sharp flavor, with a somewhat smooth aftertaste. Poured a little cold, decided to try it again after warming up for a bit. Warming up, nice & malty. Has a very malty aroma."
"Smooth and creamy. Very crisp. Solid beer. Very drinkable."
"D - A tad too bitter for my liking, but yet a respectable brew... The taste is quite memorable, but the beer slightly dissappoints in all other facets..."
"Off the tap at The Daily Planet this beer was an orange/amber color with a off-white head that displayed moderate retention and left broken bands of sticky lacing. The aroma was a very appealing balance of floral and slightly herbal hops with rich malt. The flavors were also well balanced and I instantly thought 'session beer.' Wet grains, slightly musty malt, toasted malt and some hints of wood balanced by a bold hoppiness on the finish. Crisp and solid and a great flagship. The mouthfeel was good but a little fizzy/foamy due to the carbonation (a tap thing?) and the body was medium."
"Really nice overall. Nothing really struck me as spectacular, but this is a solid beer and would do well during any season. Might also be an admirable gateway beer for a neophyte. One really can't go wrong with this one."
"This is the perfect domestic session beer. There is plenty of flavor, yet the alcohol is low enough that you could kick back a couple of pitchers of this stuff with your mates. If I was going to be around for the superbowl, you better believe this is what I would be drinking. Impressive."
"D: lingering dryness is borderline ""sessionable"" for me. very well balanced tho."
"Light copper color with a medium to thin light tan head. Aroma is citrus hops, piney, touch of caramel. The flavor is lightly grainy, with some roasty and light caramel notes, and a decent NorthWest hop presence to keep it pretty dry. Finishes hoppy, but not too crisp or bitter."
"Nice amber color with a nice initial head. Smell is nice and malty. Taste is very refreshing - nice carbonation and malty undertones. Feel is great and I could drink several of these. Not a ton of original character, but sometimes its good to have a beer that isn't intensely flavorful and is just a good pleasant drink. $8 bucks a six-pack - I'll be getting more."
"This beer has a fine drinkability and would be a great accompanyment to a hearty meal."
"Drinkability - high because nothing is too overwhelming. Most will be able to enjoy this beer because it's in no way off-putting or obnoxious. Kind of like the name..."
"Poured Amber with a half finger of fine bubbled head. Smelled pungent and earthy. Medium impression of hops and light malt roasting. Drank clean... but I didn't crave another. I recall liking this more in the past... perhaps the hops have changed."
"D: good, esp. for the abv, a bit sweet for me for too many"
"Overall a very good beer, tastes like an amber ale should and would stack up with the best of them but if you are looking for complexity look elsewhere."
"Decent feel and drink per se. Carbonation is high initially yet settles in the end, leaving a somewhat viscous finish."
"The beer poured a light copper with an off white head. The aroma is simply of malt. The taste is light malt, with no real hops flavor, but it is evident in the dry finish. The feel is medium and dry. I was really impressed with this beer. It is one of the most pleasant session ales I've had in a while. I know I'll be drinking more in the future."
"On draft at my local last week, man what a nice beer. The aroma of malt and a good hit of citrusy hops was very nice, the mouthfeel like a good English Bitter, and it tasted as close to Meantime IPA as I have found in the states. A great session beer with that elusive ""moreishness"" that a good beer should have."
"D - This is one of my favorite session beers."
"Overall impression: This is a good example of the classic american pale - there is a bit more hops than I would expect in an amber, but that is just a quibble on the classification. Very nice, very drinkable."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"(rated Jun 12, 2008)"
"Overall: A very good example of a West Coast Red Ale."
"Pours a orange amber with just a hint of red. The creamy bone colored cap is a little small,but retains well for the style. It leaves a quarter inch cap that is still hanging strong and leaving some patchy lace. The nose is sweet and malty with some underlying flora/citrusy hoppy aromas. Lots of bread crust flavors here with a good amount of hop bitterness. A nice balance that leans slightly toward the citrusy bitter flavors. The mouthfeel has kind of a dirty dry feel,and borders on very dry. If readily available in your area Red Seal could be a good friend."
"Overall: This beer as an astringent mouth feel and the finish is a bit bitter but acceptable with this style of beer. I Enjoyed this beer very much."
"This is a wonderful beer, and I'm glad I picked it off the shelf. It pours a beautiful clear amber color with a huge creamy, thick foamy off white head that laces and retains very well. The nose on this beer is just perfect. There are very nice bready malts, enticing caramel hints, all rounded out with a great hop presence. The taste is fantastic. This is a great beer, it comes off a little more like an IPA than an amber, as there aren't any of the tart reddish notes in the flavor characteristic of the red style. This is a creamy, bready, earthy malt beer with a very well balanced hop presence. The mouthfeel leaves just a slight bittering hop presence and there is little aftertaste noticeable. L'Chaim."
"This beer has great balance. Very smooth from front to back. It has a very beautiful honey amber appearance with a nice cream colored head. Pretty strong lacing as well. Smells very apple like with strong scents of pine, sugary orange, bright citrus. There's also a hint of minty like cleaness. Similar to how spearmint gum makes your mouth feel fresh. Like I said it's one of the most balanced ipa type beers I've tried. It doesn't have a ton of hop bite nor a ton of malty sweetness, but it seems to blend the two perfectly with the hops dominating in the end. With that said, the sweetness never totally goes away. It's midbodied in mouthfeel and goes down very smooth. Coats the tongue and tingles nicely. Good Beer, great brewery. Definitely try the Old Rasputin and Old Stock Ale that North Coast puts out. Both are excellent too."
"Pours a dark cherry red color with a thin foamy off-white head. Aroma and flavor both consist of a nice balance of malt and hops. Very drinkable session beer that starts off smooth and finishes off with a dry hoppy bitterness."
"This ale rises above the current glut of ""amber"" ales available due to the pleasant bitterness that complements the rich malty profile. I place it along side my favorite amber, Bell's Amber Ale."
"North Coast offers a solid lineup of beers including some, Red Seal Ale among them, that should appeal to the palate of any beer drinker, no matter their tastes or experience. This is beer done well, period. Like I'd recommend their Old Rasputin and Old Stock to those learning to become connoisseurs out there, I'd recommend this as a first step along the way."
"good, drinkable amber but not the hardest beer to get down for someone looking at a good staple beer. gives a sweet peachy smell that combines what it says on the label of, water, barley, hops, yeast and that's all. as said above, very easy to drink with a mixture of hops, the sweeter taste of heavier malt, and semi-dry bitterness that ends with a floral nose as you set it down thinking of the next one. expensive though for its price in MO for 9.50 a six pack"
"D: quite sessionable, esp w/ some spicy food, could easily become a staple - very satisfying"
"From a 12 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is caramel and pine. Color is a copper amber with a half inch tan head. Crystal clear. Malty and toasty but with bitterness to back it up. Some hop flavor in the finish with more pine and citrus. Medium bodied and dries in the finish. A great beer, one of my favorite Amber Ales."
"hop finish. Mouthfeel is crisp but fairly full."
"all and all i would finish the 6 pack, but doubt i would buy it again. north coast has other brews that tickle my palate more than this particular brew."
"This soft pretzel-hued ale really threw me for a loop when I compared aroma to taste. It smelled nice and hoppy, with juicy orange scent. The beer's flavor profile was very much more balanced, leaving the hop blast forgotten in the creamy maltiness. There was a whisper of hop acid but it was overpowered by a significant metallic twang. Some buttery biscuit in there too. Smooth enough to drink several with just enough bitterness to keep my attention. I would like this with a grilled panini sandwich or maybe a casual thin-crust cheese pizza."
"Definitely worth trying. An exceptional interpretation of a red ale. Impressive taste, impressive mouthfeel, and overall pretty dang impressive. North Coast never fails. This may not be my favorite Red, as I prefer a bit maltier and sweeter, but it's an impressive interpretation and gives some great variety to the usual amber/red category. Go give it a shot."
"M/D: WAY too much carbonation for my taste. I think it slightly took away from the beer's character, but the texture and ABV make this a sessionable beer by any definition...I just wish that I had bought more than 2 bottles..."
"Overall, I was rather impressed by the appearance and smell, but then was just let down with the taste. Despite this, still is great session beer."
"Nice that this is now available at our local government liqour stores as it is a great session beer. Malty in profile but with plenty of hops on the finish this is a well made drinking beer that has enough complexity to make it interesting. Add this to Alaskan amber, Full Sail amber and Fat Tire as great drinking beers from the U.S."
"This is a great example of a American pale Ale. The balance between malt and hops is spot on. This could be my new go to Beer(sorry Sierra Nevada) if it was more available in my area. The places that do sell Red Seal don't sell it COLD! You need a beer cooler Trader Joes!"
"Drinkability: A great easy drinking sessionable beer. As is my tradition I tend to drink beers with ""Red"" in the name during Nebraska Cornhusker football season. This RED Seal Ale fits the bill and I find myself going for it this fall. I have been able to get this for $7.49-7.85 a six, not a bad deal."
"The taste has very light malty sweetness, mostly caramelly fruit, with mild but far more dominant, hop flavour and bitterness, mostly grapefruit with some other citrus and a light, stale piney quality. The bitterness is not strong in absolute terms, but it certainly dominates the whole beer, since the body is thin, the malt exceedingly weak, it lacks compelxity and it's watery and bland, with a thin character completely lacking anything underneath the thin surface flavours. It seems thin and has an old, stale quality, which makes no sense given my proximity to the brewery and its presnece in the region."
"A hazy light amber beer with a nice diminishing head. Can definitely pick up some citrus tones in the scent. Tastes just great, just a little bit of bitterness, very well balanced. I'm loving that grapefruit-citrus aftertaste. A little more carbonated than I had expected, but very high drinkability."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable, but seems a bit heavy. Good example of an American Amber."
"Pours a hazy reddish amber with a medium light tan head. Smells strongly of citrus, like a fresh grapefruit. Taste is also very citrusy, with a nice toasty malt middle, and a light piney finish. Nice bitterness that clings to your tounge. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation levels medium. Very drinkable, this is a great beer for sitting around and relaxing. One of the best Red Ales I've had, tastes a lot like an American Pale Ale too IMO."
"D - Certainly enjoyable and drinkable. I'm not a big fan of amber ales but this one is better than most."
"drinkability- easy drinking"
"Drinkability: Definitely not true to its style; tastes more like a pale ale. If it weren't for the stinging carbonation, this one would rank much higher."
"D: I can't describe this beer particularly well. The taste and smell are great but not terribly powerful, making it a great session beer. Picked a six-pack off the shelf not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised."
"Taste- Full mouth feel, with a large rich malt flavor. This bier has a more hoppy taste than I thought from the smell with a slight hint of grapefruit. This bier drinks smooth and crisp with a slight bitter back end. I real enjoyed drinking this bier and will definitely have it again."
"v: oz3 al3 3.625"
"The great thing about this beer is its mix of fresh hops and sweet malt. Its very easy to drink, with a pleasant amount of alcohol, and still rich in taste and character. Its great in the summer, as well as on a rainy autumn day."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied, a touch thin. Crisp and smooth and very drinkable."
"D - Abover average, nice session brew."
"Very good and not overly hopped. Could go for more complexity with this one. It kind of just is what it is."
"Feel is maybe a bit too thin for the style but not too bad at the same time, carbonation makes up for it."
"Drinkability: Very good! Have been impressed by all of North Coast's beers so far. Just wish this was more readily available in my area."
"A nice amber ale from North Coast. More subtle and pleasing than the average bear."
"12oz bottle served in a pint glass. A really pretty beer: red/orange color, thick off-white head, plenty of lacing.Not much aroma, a little sweetness. Taste was an improvement over aroma. Sweet fruit, good malt presence, ending with a hoppy bite. Good session beer."
"D- I suspect this to be a very refreshing brew for a hot day, which surprises me as an amber is not usually my first choice for something to drink on a hot day."
"I venture to say this is one of the best amber ales in the US, if not the world. It's light & smooth enough for regular enjoyment with enough malt & hops as to not grow boring. Extremely well-balanced & well-rounded brew."
"Overall: More hoppy than you'd expect from an American amber, that's for sure. But even with that in mind, I rather enjoyed this one."
"Nice bear overall and will become a regular in my fridge...!"
"Drinkability: a nice light bodied, well made, with good hop flavor that is not too overpowering. A good beer to drink on a hot day, very refreshing."
"Drinkability is definitely high. Despite the hoppiness, this is very smooth and for only 5.5% ABV, nearly as hoppy as an IPA. I like it."
"Only other experience with North Coast is Ol' Rasputin and this one doesn't disappoint. Some good flavors and a nice hoppy beer."
"I really like this. A very nice beer that I highly recommend, and can usually be found in my fridge."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy light amber-red body with a good inch of off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma consists of equal parts pungent sweet caramel-honey maltiness and crisp citrussy American hops. Wow. Tastes sweet and malty initially, with caramel, honey, and slight biscuit notes, with a fair bit of support from grassy and citrussy American hops and a semi-dry finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with a fair bit of carbonation which is just subtle enough to enhance the drinkability. Super-drinkable, though not so much so that any of the other attributes, most notably flavor, take a back seat. Unbelievable. Practically perfect in every imaginable way. Tastes to me like home-brewing smells. For the style and for any beer, this is about as perfect as they come - it's the first perfect '5' I have ever given. Amazing."
"Smooth medium mouthfeel that goes down really well. Could be fairly sessionable as the hoppiness is well balanced."
"D: Crisp and refreshing."
"The simplest beer I've had from this brewery. Would make a fine session brew, but wouldn't stand out in a crowd."
"Found (warm) in Acton at Colonial Spirits (Great Road)."
"Pours a medium amber color, good clarity, with just a fingers worth of off-white head. Aromas are extremely hoppy, all pine and herbal with little grapefruit or other citrus. I'm struggling to find any malt notes but getting just a touch of dark crystal malt sweetness coming through. On the palate, however, the malts make themselves much more present. Rich Munich and crystal malts really round out this beer with a bit of bitterness to finish. Hop flavor is quite a bit more muted than the aroma. Carbonation and mouthfeel are spot on for style. This is quite a nice drinker, next to St. Rogue Red for my favorite. Very high drinkability, I could hit these all day."
"Well balanced American Amber Ale that is drinkable enough to order a few pints. None the less, I prefer a bit more character from hops and malts in my amber ales."
"Pretty good."
"Served a crisp orange with a nice head that lasted as a thin layer and left decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was citrus hops and pale malts. The taste was a nice crisp balance of sweet malts and sharp citrus hops. The beer is very light and refreshing and almost perfect for Summer weather. This is a very enjoyable amber ale"
"Overall I did enjoy this beer on a warm summer afternoon, however it is not one of my favorite Ambers in the market due to the predominant bitterness."
"Rides a fine line between approachable and something more challenging, which is exactly what I think of with this style. I could easily bring a 6-pack of this to a party and enjoy it all night. Amazing balance; it's hoppy, but not too bitter, and malty, but not too sweet. More hop character than most Canadian IPAs, and better too!"
"The ale is slightly red with more brownish colours. The head was about a centimeter in height, with a bit of retention. The nose on the beer is of sweet malts with hints of hops. The beer tastes of sweet malts with a nice bittering from the hops to finish the beer. It is very balanced and smooth. The sweet malts are quite tasty and make the beer drinkable. The mouth is creamy and slightly carbonated. This is my type of red ale, nice and hoppy, but a great sweet malt to go behind it."
"Mouthfeel is tight and clean, goes down very easily, lending to a high drinkability."
"D - Very good example of a good beer without being as overpowering or strong as an IPA. A great introduction to craft beers for those who aren't very experienced."
"D- pretty aggressive for a red, even in america. similar to hoppus maximus in sheer hop force, easy in session due to relatively low ABV. i finally got to use my red seal pint glass!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark amber with a slight reddish tint to it. Head was initially 3 fingers, but dropped down to 1, and consisted of off white foam, almost like a meringue that clung very well to the sides. Aroma was hoppy, maybe a bit of vanilla, and reminded a bit of a good deli pickle for some reason. Tasted initially sweet, then shifted to buttermilk pancake, then became slightly bitter. Mouthfeel was a little lacking considering the initial sweetness. It was a little too watery for a beer that tasted this way. Very easy to drink, probablly go down much faster than expected."
"D - Drinkability is quite good. It tastes good, smells good, feels good...that pretty much drives the point home. The low alcohol combined with just the right amount of hop bitterness really makes this one a solid beer from the North Coast Brewing Co. Recommended to anyone looking for a bit of a hop bite in their red ale."
"drinkability: not like you had to choke it down but it wasn't all that special either, nothing really superb or really bad either. Just pretty good."
"D: Goodness gracious this is a fine brew. I could drink several of this superlative ale. North Coast has to be one of if not the finest brewery in America."
"Appearance is a deep orangy copper color with two fingers of head that dissolves down to a thick film, leaving some light lacing as the beer drains into my belly. Lots of fruity hops and caramel malt. Almost a perfect balance. Flavor is likewise. This is really an excellent...oh, I thought it was an APA, but apparently not...in any case, it's delicious. A nice explosion of fruity hop bitterness mixed well with smooth malt. Man this is drinkable. Had this on tap before and thought it was delicious then as well. A good session (if a little high in ABV), and also good for a hot day."
"Notes: This became an automatic staple,but not easy to find. I will buy this as often as possible because it is so well balanced and so good. I try a lot of beers and this beer is just so enticing."
"Taste is very refreshing! This beer has that nice crisp and fresh tastes of hops but not that mouth puckering intensity of an india pale ale. The main tastes I get are floral hops and some powdered sugar sweetness. Nothing too intense. The malt backs it well and makes this a very balanced beer. This is a simple yet very delicious ale."
"I want more. Oh how I want more."
"D: Excellent brew and worthy of a slower session."
"flavorful and sessionable, kinda reminds me a little of SN celebration"
"D - Easy to drink, except for the heaviness....something I'll be looking forward to in the future."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will definitely be back for more. It's certainly worth a try if you happen to come across it."
"D-Darn close to perfectly suiting my palate seems better than the last time I tried it.Outstanding."
"D - This is a good beer that I would drink again sometime it has a good taste to it worth a try"
"Pours a slight hue darker than a regular pale, with a creamy off white head. A little different on the nose, really showing pineapple rind as the dominate characteristic! Brown sugar, and subdued red apples on the background. Palate shows about the same as the nose, but on a little darker side with a little bit more scorched malt characteristic. The hops were pretty well infused behind the malts, to show a lively character from mid-palate to the finish. Not a bad choice for a different type of a pale!"
"O- One of the best beers I've had in a long long time. A very worthy pale ale. For those who like sierra nevada pale ale, this seems to be a step above."
"Very nice APA and one that could be enjoyed frequently."
"single bottle from Trader Joe's Cary, an old favorite"
"Over all, a slightly above-average APA. Very drinkable, worth trying, but not the most intriguing APA."
"For me, this is the APA against which I will judge all other APAs. It is in no way over-the-top: unlike some APAs, which give me the distinct impression that the brewer fell asleep at the hop-pitching switch, allowing gallons and gallons of hops to enter into the brew, Red Seal is perfectly balanced and nuanced. Nothing unpleasant or brash or harsh at all. Nice complex hop notes, this is one to satisfy the Hop Head and the traditionalist alike. Bravo."
"This beer seems to have good balance. I wish that I had one more sip left to take in the whole thing one more time, but alas. There is no more."
"Drinkability: Thoroughly drinkable."
"This is very tasty pale ale. I will gladly and easily work my way through a six pack. I especially like the presence of malts here, as it gives it an overall more balanced flavor--something you don't regularly get with a pale ale."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium-light bodied with higher levels of carbonation than the previous two, though given the lighter body it seems appropriate. This beer goes down easily enough, and I do recommend it. However, it is as I have said previously in this session(the horizontal tasting) it is just another one of the guys. Worth checking out, but it isn't good enough to get me to buy it again; I'm glad that I did give it a try, by no means do I not like it, but as far as this style goes I've had beers that I found to be much hoppier, and much better-all around."
"Smells of orange spice, slightly metallic. Some hops lingering in background. Palate is simple and satisfying. Lively carbonation, creamy texture. Nice dry/bitter finish. Slightly toasted grainy malts kick it off, a good dose of hops in middle, and short metalic finish. Some sweeter candy notes, slight lager/belgian taste."
"This was a typical pale ale. The flavor was pretty one-dimensional with decent hops, but not a whole lot of bitterness. Pretty easily drinkable, but there just wasn't much to it. I'd call it average. (Drunk from a bottle, so I don't have any notes on the appearance.)"
"Overall, this is a drinkable beer if you like APAs. It has a pretty bitter taste, but it's likable nonetheless."
"mmm. very drinkable. I think the bitterness would be a little drying later on in a session, but pleasant and enjoyable in moderation. recommended. One of the better pales i have had lately."
"M/D: A we bit strong on the bitter do to the huge amount of hops but I would not take that away since the flavor was so good. Other than that it had a great feel in the mouth and I really want to drink this one again and again. I'll also be trying many more beers from this brewer they definitely know what they are doing."
"Definitely recommended."
"This poured a beautiful copper/red color with nice head that lasted a while. Smell is a pleasing blend of hoppy and fruity aromas. Taste is a well-balanced blend of initial maltiness that subsides to a nice hop bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel of this beer is good, as it has a thick, chewy character to it. Drinkabilty is high."
"Well, what can I say? I've liked and enjoyed this beer before, but sitting down with a ""review"" copy, and thinking about the beer as a whole, has made me see it as one of the weaker offering's in North Coast's lineup. Drinkable? Sure, yeah, I could do another. But I can think of a handful of other pale ales, APAs or otherwise, that I'd prefer a second round of."
"D: Not bad. just not complex enough to hold my interest."
"If you're bored of the cookie cutter APAs, give this one a shot."
"D- Its an ok beer, if thirst was an issue i could drink this beer again, but otherwise i wouldent buy it."
"Poured red with an inch or two white head. Smelled of grapefruit: taste was grapefruit hops with a hint of pine and a sweet caramel undercurrent. Not much going on here. Three Floyds and Mad River have really impressed recently with pale ales. This: not so much."
"Not something I'm looking forward to having again."
"D-A smooth drink that is very agreeable."
"On fist taste the maltiness comes throuogh followed by the hops and a bitter dry finish. As it warms though all the flavors come out to play: pear, apple, nice slightly roasted maltiness, and good hops undertones. I could drink a lot of these. I don't know if I would crave this beer a lot, but after I've had one, another one sounds darn good!"
" ~ I must admit I do like this brew. I'd certainly have another and would love to try it straight from the tap. Maybe the next time I'm in California I'll be able to indulge in a pint."
"Great Stuff... Definitely Recommended..."
"Cheers!"
" This beer is a nice reddish amber drink with loads of floral hops, and a great balanced caramel malt backbone. Crackers pours it in a big 20 ounce pint which is just enough to make me want another. North Coast Brewing has a good roster of beers and Red Seal is the best daily drinker of the bunch. Perfect with food, perfect without food, just about perfect."
"I had this one on cask at the brewery. I was supraised by the level of carbonation, there was more than I expected. There were tons of really small bubbles and a decent head that lingered through the whole pint. It poured a light amber color, somewhat cloudy though. The aroma was much more intense than this same beer in a bottle or on tap. The hops really shine and have an intense floral citrus smell and taste. Mouthfeel was very smooth. All in all a very drinkable beer that is made even better by the cask presentation."
"D= This Red Seal Ale is extremely drinkable. It is crisp and fresh tasting enough for a hot summer day yet has enough flavor and body to be great choice year-round."
"Orange amber pour with a really nice big offwhite fluffy, creamy head. Mildly sweet, nicely soapy, piney, hopped big smell. Taste is a nice mild hop taste, and a sweet caramel backing and a very smooth creamy, yet nicely carbonated great beer. Mild bitter finish on a great all around pale ale and one I will definitely have again."
"Drinkablity: Very tasty and sessionable. Good flavor and consistency."
"Overall, this beer is fairly decent. The toastiness of the malts rounds the beer out. I think the hop profile could be a little bit more aggressive. Did I get an old bottle?"
"I feel bad about all the 5s, but for a pale ale, this brew excelled in many categories. It has the appearance and mouthfeel of an American red, except with all the flavor that an A.R. generally lacks (in my opinion). Despite the metallic aftertaste, the rest of the beer excels in its style, making me wonder why I don't see more of this on tap in Chicago. Distribution? If we can ever rectify the distribution conundrum faced by my city, I would appreciate more of this Pale Ale in my bars over the summer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I would prefer a bit more balance but not bad, overall"
"Have been meaning to get around to this one. Always catches my eye when I'm browsing, but for some reason or another I always pass it up. Pours a light amber with a one-finger off-white head that sticks thick with some nice lacing. Smells of citrus and hops and faint malts in the background. There's a little sourness coming through...wait..no, that's my BEARD! Damn. A slither of sweetness comes out upon the first taste. Second taste reveals faint spice, orange peel and tea. The hops aren't too big leaving this a very drinkable and tasty IPA that would be perfect for sessioning after you've finished with the big beers."
"Defintely going to be purchasing again, so long as I can find it...appeared to be the last 6 pack."
"A very good session beer, quite flavorful and satisfying, but it doesn't become cloying. Alcohol is restrained so I can have a couple for lunch and then go back to work."
"D- I am soooo glad this beer is finally available locally. This is one of the best west coast pales I have had."
"Hazy copper color with a nice foamy white head. Very nice sticky lacing that really clings to the glass. Nice fresh hop smell. Very floral with some citrus note. Strong biscuit malt background. Taste follows suit. Medium body. Overall I was surprised by this one. For some reason I wasn't expecting something this enjoyable. A nice drinking APA."
"Overall a really good APA, I liked it more than I thought I would. This is my first 6'er of Red Seal, but I will definitely buy more in the future."
"D - Very high on this one. Easy to consume and enjoy. This will be a definite staple in my fridge from now on, highly recommended."
"d- sweet and it was $6.99"
"The aroma is floral hoppy with a slight malt smell and a honey in the finish of smell. The flavor of the beer is smooth and cool. It is very well balanced. With the mouth feel it leaves a nice bitterness all around the inside of the mouth. A malty aftertaste lingers on the tip of the tongue. I would buy a sixer of this and enjoy it any time of the year."
"Pours a yellow/ orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet, grapefruity hops. In the taste, sweet to dry grapefruity hops and a touch watery. A smooth/ small light bitter mouthfeel and a dry grapefruity hop aftertaste. Good nose, but a bit lighter and not as bitter as expected, but good."
"Chicago"
"Beautiful orange-amber color with lively carbonation and a nice lingering head. The aroma is decent w/ a solid hoppy smell. Floral with a spicy note. A hint of maltiness is present. The flavor is very solid. Nice citrusy bitterness. Some fruitness and a little butteriness. Not overly bitter and goes down easy. Light and crisp body. Finishes nicely. A nice pale ale. Very drinkable. Not quite as awesome as some others I've had though."
"The taste is a pleasant surprise given the underwhelming smell. It has just enough hops to make it work. I'm usually not a fan of overly sweet beers, and this one starts down that road but is saved by the hops on the finish. Ends up be a fairly enjoyable, highly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Comes of as an ale that can be enjoyed in a numerous amount of occasions, however fails to become a prime choice due to its artificial aftertaste."
"Although an APA in style, Red Seal has stylistically always fooled me into believing it was a British style ESB, and while I won;t split hairs I *will* get down to the bar and have another pint of this before a new beer replaces it in the rotation. It's well worth seeking out on draught, and worth paying the premium price I paid for it as well."
"recommended"
"North Coast is a class act... I enjoy Red Seal often... and for some strange reason, it is available in Boise often on cask... now that is all together a different story... a Fresh cask and my above compliments are racheted up at least a grade. This another brew that I introduce my macro friends to; and while it may be a little much at first, by the time it warms up a bit... everyone is always throwing out praise. Now, somebody just needs to hook me up with the barrel aged Old Stock and I will be a very happy camper... Any takers?"
"Poured with a dark, murky, amber-brown color with a thinned head. The citrus aromas with it had lemon-like flavors very heavily floating from it. The drink had a perfect, sour-bitter balance. It also had a medium body that gave it an average carbonation. Overall, this was an excellent pale ale."
"Drinkability: A fine pale ale when just a little more hops are required."
"D: A-motherfucking-one!"
"A light amber color with a quater inch off white colored head forms. The scent of malt comes out at the start. Then it is followed by the dominate aroma of citrus abd pine, that hits the nose and lingers there for some time. The taste is a bit surprising, it starts with a citru bitterness, nothing to strong or overbearing. That is followed by a malt mildness, that hits halfway across the palate. This flavor dominates till almost very end, then the bitterness brings itself out again at the end. The feel is very medium bodied at the start, and as it crosses the palate it gains some heftness to its texture. There is also the slight tingle of carbonation at the back end. A fairly decent beer, very solid aroma, is almost let down by an inconsistant flavor. The feel is let down a bit by the carboanation. Though it does seem I being negative to this beer, it still is better than the average brew out there. This has potential to become a go to beer."
"Final thoughts  Very nice, complex brew."
"D- I found myself enjoying this less and less the more I drank of it. Not bad... just not my favorite for the style."
" I think ""not bad"" fits."
"D: Amazing smell and great taste but I think I'd get bored trying to drink a whole six-pack in a night."
"This beer pours a hazy red-orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of citrus, and grapefruit with a hint of caramel. The taste is of very well balanced, but with enough hops to make it very interesting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic APA. It is endlessly sessionable with enough character to remain interesting. I would certainly drink this again."
"from a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass, pours a golden caramel color with a nice frothy white head. smells of sweet caramel malts and piney hops. tastes of caramel malts and has a nice bitter hop finish and just a tad of sweetness, this is a very tasty beer. mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with medium carbonation. this beer is very drinkable, i would reccomend this to anybody."
"D: Taste is on the subtle side but it's definitely not tasteless... controlled would be a good way to describe it. This would make a great introduction brew and an excellent session beer."
"It poured an amber with about a finger-head that didn't last for long. The smell reminded me very much of malts with just a little bit of citrus sweetness, flowers, and yeast. The taste is very robust with the malts being very present and the hops only appearing to me as a little bitterness towards the end with a fairly dry finish that leaves an aftetaste that I didn't find to be entirely pleasant. The carbonation in it was interesting and different, since the bubbles seemed to be quite a bit smaller than normal that provided a different mouthfeel than I expected. The drinkablity is pretty standard, but it seems to be sitting a little heavier in me than most ales. This was an interesting beer to try, but I can't imagine picking it up again. I have a feeling this is a good beer that just isn't for me."
"More like a mild version of a West Coast IPA than a pale ale if you ask me, but overall certainly a quality ale."
"Creamy and smooth mouthfeel but still a bit thin. Nice american pale ale."
"I'm curious how many unwary customers buy this thinking they are getting a red/amber ale, and wind up with a hoppy pale ale! Personally, I'd rather have a hoppy pale ale any day of the week. I would definitely drink this again, as it's both a satisfying pale ale and also would be a decent stand-in for an IPA if the selection is lackluster or none are available."
"I WOULD like to say ""what happened to this beer", but I can already tell you, and I am shocked. This was one of my favorite session beers, but guess what, take away my malt syrup, and you'll lose me as a customer. This beer about a year ago, was terrific. It is now dummied down and I am disappointed, especially coming from North Coast. You can taste most of the same flavor, but without the same bite to it. Very watery, still has some malt to it, oh, and isn't nearly as hoppy. Sorry, guys, you lost me on this one. Please leave Old Rasputin and Pranqster, as is!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint... Clear reddish copper hue with a lasting off-white head that left little licks of lacing here and there... Smell was mainly hops; piney and a little grassy, a hint of orange/citrus. The solid malt backbone also made an appearance in the nose, but is much more noticeable when tasting... First sensation upon drinking this beer is the sweetness of caramelly malt spreading over the tongue. This nice malt base is quickly followed by a strong hop finish; grassy and citrusy at once, and very complimentary to the malt... Mouthfeel begins smooth then becomes a little rough and almost harsh at the end, though not uncomfortably so... A very drinkable a refreshing beer; nice for rapid consumption on a hot day!"
"Yum."
"Pours perfectly into my pint glass a yellowish-orange with the recommended two-finger head. Aroma is a bit piney upfront, malt dextrin then takes over. Taste has mild esters and a touch of caramel, making way for a piney and grapefruit note from the hops. It starts to become more hoppy than malty before bready flavors pop up in the back and stick in the aftertaste. No flaws here, it passes the test."
"Could drink a lot of these because it is a lighter beer and the taste is not too much"
"Good mouthfeel with nice carbonation, finish is solidly bitter without sacrificing any drinkability. Just a very nice West Coast style pale ale."
"This is a great beer"
"your basic big hoppy west coast ale. Not bad at all."
"easy to drink, probably about to have another :)"
"North Coast again puts out a solid and rich (for an APA) drinking beer. You cant go wrong with them, wish all the styles were readily available here."
"The pour is amber/copper, with excellent clarity and lacing from the off-white head. It smells fresh and sweet with caramel and citrusy/floral hops - More than enough for an amber, just short for a pale ale. The taste is very good, again full of caramel with a nice yeasty, bready full smooth body. Rich and full of flavor. Hops show themselves as grapefruit in the finish and combine well with the crisp carbonation. Extremely drinkable, and I can't think of an occasion when a Red Seal wouldn't seem like a damn near perfect beer."
"D - One of the best session beers ever IMO. It's simple, but elegant, hoppy, and well made. It's not going to blow your mind with complexity or off the wall insane flavors, but that's not really what APAs are about anyway. This is one of the top ""grab a sixer to take to my buddy's backyard BBQ"" beers!"
"This beer poured an orange/brownish color with a thick, rocky, retentive head. The aroma is malty and caramel with hops noticeable in the background. The taste is malty with a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and suits the beer well. Overall, this is well balanced pale ale with the bitterness noticeable, but not overpowering  definitely worth trying if you like a hop flavor that isnt overpowering."
"Overall: a very well done American PA. While still citrusy like most APAs, the hop profile is well rounded with other hop flavors. The malt does just enough balancing to make this one a great session beer."
"Pours a clear copper/reddish tinge, thin white head forms, leaves some decent lacing, solid ring, looks okay. Smell is sweet carame, pine/citrus, lots of floral, very nice and balanced, great APA aroma. Taste is similar, nice maltiness at first, then floral and pine hits, citrus in the finish, smooth flavour, balanced bitterness, quite nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and refreshing. A solid APA."
"D - A decent ale. I like deep, complex beers, and this has hints of that but stays light. Would probably drink again."
"D: Quite drinkable. Not the best pale ale I have ever had, but then again, I have had some fantastic ones. I picked up a 6 pack of this, and I look forward to the other 5 bottles I still have yet to drink. I drink a lot of midwest APAs (Alpha King, Founders, etc..). The west coast interpretation is definitely different, yet still great. Complexities abound, yet still drinkable. Love this brewery."
"Nice strong aroma, malty with hoppy overtone. Color is a nice dark orangy amber with a thick white head. Flavor has a nice balance of malt and hops, leaning towards hoppy, with a smoky hint and some good bitterness. Lively and zingy in the mouth, this is a pleasant ale to drink - fine by itself, or at a party, or with supper."
"I think this is an example of your standard, tasty American craft brew. Lots of great qualities, but not quite amazing. It's has a nice balance of malt profile with hops and bitterness, all the while been overall tasty and quite drinkable. It's a pretty red color with a little lacing. The aroma gives away the flavor with its fruity citrus and roasted caramel malt. There's a nice lingering bitterness, that I think is just right. It lingers, but not unpleasantly. A well made beer, worthy of a good session with friends."
"Side note: I paired this with sweet bell pepper chicken sausages from Trader Joe's and a stout mustard from Sierra Nevada for a delightful lunch. The Red Seal easily stood-up to the sausages and mustard without overwhelming. It did an excellent job scrubbing the palate after each tasty morsel as well. (Incidentally, these guys have a great website too.)"
"D - A good APA. A nice balance of hops and malt."
"A bit thin, but good. Somewhat dry. Thickens as it warms up, but stays dry. It's a good ale. Dry, bitter, malty, sweet. English ale with a little something extra."
"served on-tap, this was a clear light reddish-amber in the glass with appropriate head/lacing. some sweet malts in the nose, a little caramel/toffee and a hint of american hops. also some fruity aromas. this has a bit of sweetness but is still somewhat crisp from the moderate hop bitterness. light/medium mouthfeel. finish does not linger that long. a very drinkable offering, one you could have a few of."
"I had this on tap at Newport Beach Brewing Company. It had a nice dark copper color. The thin, bubbly head, disappeared after I took my first drink. The taste was a nice mix of toasty malt and bitter, slightly spicy hops. The finish was clean. This is a very drinkable beer."
"I would definitely buy it again."
"B'ham UK"
"D: This beer tastes nothing like remember it. What a disappointment. Ill need to try this again in the future to make sure the keg or lines werent dirty."
"This ale pours dark amber in color with a fresh white foamy head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is a combination of hops and pine. It has a nice flavor with hints of malt, hops and citrus. It goes down smoothly and the combination of flavors should satisfy a wide range of beer drinkers. The aftertaste stays with you for a little bit, but in this case its a good thing. Overall a very satisfying APA."
"D: A really nice red ale on-tap with plenty of flavor but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Overall, a nice beer with a good hop aroma and flavor."
"A tasty West Coast APA - flavorful, smooth and well-balanced."
"Pours a deep amber with a one finger head and moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet malts and citrus hops. Taste is pleasant blend of grapefruit and sweet malts with very little to no bitterness. Very creamy and smooth and super drinkable. Great light APA that makes you want to grab another."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a 3 fingers worth of head, and leaving light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is strongly of sweet hops. Not really complex. If there's anything else there, its completely covered by the hops. The taste is smooth hoppy citrus flavor. None of the harsh aftertaste associated with other pale ales. Medium mouthfeel. Yet another great beer from North Coast. A very smooth, easy to drink pale ale, full of flavor."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I could drink quite a few of these, but personally I would prefer a little stronger of a hops presence. Nonetheless, this is a good beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I was suprised and very impressed. Quite complex but nicely balanced. A good session brew. Looking forward to having another."
"D: Oh yeah, an underrated APA, one of the best I've tried. Stacks up nicely to SNPA, the benchmark of this style."
"This beer is a nice golden brown color, the head is thick and offwhite. I couldnt detect a strong aroma, but nothing unpleasant either. The taste really suprised me. This is a very clean hoppy mildly sweet ale. Not dry or too bitter, just an all around good tasting beer. This is a very drinkable beer and one that is worth trying."
"Red Seal Ale pours a hazy copper with a sticky head. Aroma is sweet, fruity malts, as well as a slight citrus hop aroma. The taste is delicious, a great balance. There is a slight caramel malt flavor followed up by a light citrusy and maybe slightly metalic bitterness. The finish is dry with an almost berry like flavor. This is a really solid beer from North Coast, a great session beer."
"D - Are you kidding? I would drink the whole growler tonight if I didn't want to save some for another time. I know North Coasts' flagship brew is Old Rasputin, but this beer is the most drinkable and well-rounded beer in their lineup. I'm glad I have a growler of Red Seal, b/c this is now one of my favorite Pale Ales."
"The beer poured a hazy amber color, with a half inch of tan foam. It smelled flowery of hops. The hops burst out in the mouth, but was well balanced. It finished dry. It was a bit fizzier than I care for, but acceptable. Overall, this is a good example of the style, and is quite enjoyable."
"The flavor surpirsed me...too watery for having such a hoppy aroma. However, it does hit the buds well with notes of caramel, oranges, and some roasted sweet malts. Could use a bit more carbonation, perhaps a bigger bite on the finish, but overall it's a helluva drinkable Pale."
"Poured hazy amber/gold with a big sturdy coarse head. Aroma is understated, hops and grain. Taste is less aggressively hopped than a typical APA -- for which I personally am grateful -- in fact I would call this a more British kind of PA. It's got only a glimmer of that obnoxious grapefruit quality that so many other APAs are so redolent of, and the quality is more balanced in this brew."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Just a bit too aggressive at the outset... it tames quickly enough to release the flavors and be more slick than prickly in the mouth. This is now my new favorite pizza beer!"
"M&D - wold make a great session beer due to its nice but low profile flavor and easy drinkability, easy to kill a 4-6 of these on a porch in the hot summer, you can be sure of that"
"I like this beer and would drink this all night. This is a very nice clean smoothe hoppy beer that could compete with some of the bigger hoppy brews. Wasn't expecting anything but coming away pleasently supprised."
"A hop balanced American ale, attractive reddish color, but seemingly lacking a freshness. Maybe it didn't have a good trip to the East Coast."
"A pretty Solid Bevergae. Poors a solid reddish copper with an 1 1/2"" head after a fairly vigoris poor. Smells mostly of sweet malts, with a hit of the hop. Taste is a little lighter then i remeber, and more or less replicates the smell. With its Medium this becomes a pretty deacent session beer."
"Verdict: The malt wasn't quite as full and chewy as I would have liked. I like my APAs to stay balanced all the way through the finish, but maybe that's just personal preference. Regardless, this certainly isn't a bad stab at the style."
"A extremely drinkable beer. VERY session worthy. It's not great, but it's certainly good, and very refreshing. This could easily be one of those beers to always keep around in your fridge."
"I'm a big fan of the North Coast beers, but for some reason, I haven't had the chance to grab this one. Poured into a Newbury Comics pint glass an amber color, with a lasting white head...great looking overall. Aroma was a little bit bland, but the hops made it a bit better. Taste had some biscuit notes, and some toasty grain as well. Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Drinkability...this would make for a great session beer. Glad I tried this one, but I think once will be enough."
"A very dry ale...very hoppy....some floral in there. decent flavors...but all are perhaps a little overdone. while i can appreciate some of the flavors ...i do not find this to be very drinkable. decent head decent lacing...active carbonation and cascading bubbles...very bitter!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is an orange-copper color with a one finger sudsy head. Smell is sweet with malt; crystal and caramel, slight yeast smell. Taste is initially sweet like the nose, quickly followed by a bitter finish. I'm usually a fan of bitter beers, but this was not a very enjoyable type of bitter. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a very creamy carbonation, nice. The overall drinkability of this beer is reduced (at least for me) by the overpowering bitterness."
"D - Great. I will have this again probably. I've been impressed by every North Coast offering I have had an oppurtunity to try so far. A real top notch brewery, keep up the great work."
"I rate the drinkability about average because I could handle a glass of it. I'd drink it again if it was given to me, but I'd not go ""out of my way"" for this one. If other ales were available I'd prefer those."
"I thought this beer was quite nice when you want an APA but not a challenge."
"Pours a golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice creamy head which lasted a long time, and leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. Scents of sweet malts, hops, and caramel. The taste is malty with a nice hoppy bite in the finish. Medium body. Drinkable, remind's me of an amber ale though."
"Pours an orangish amber color with a creamy off white head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. This beer has a delightful aroma of sweet malt and floral hops. The taste begins with sweet toasted malt that is soone joined with a citrusy hop finish. Overall, this is a pretty good APA that was enjoyed."
"Poured to a hazy golden copper color with minimal off-white head and okay lacing. Nose was citrus-grassy hops, and the flavor was much the same. Mouthfeel was somewhat tangy, and the finish was dry and bitter, as expected, but just a tad stale. Not a bad beer at all though."
"A fine, if somewhat unexciting, beer. However, at $6.49 a six-pack at Trader Joe's, this is worth a look."
"Very tasty APA. The color is a reddish amber. Aroma is a a tasty scent of hops. Flavor is predominantly hoppy, without going overboard like a West Coast IPA. Even with the hops, there is a nice balance of malt in the background. Red Seal leaves a clean aftertaste, and goes down very smoothly. My idea of a prototypical session beer."
"One of my favorite beers. Lots of taste, lots of bitterness. People often compare this beer to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but Red Seal is much more excentric. This is the bad guy of beers."
"This is a really nice beer. While it does lean towards the hop side of the spectrum, I really like the balance interplay between the malt and hops here. I was definitely not giving this beer enough credit, at least I haven't had it in almost 10 years. I definitely should not have waited so long."
"i like it but i have had better i tend to stick to the ipas but i like some pale ales every now and again"
"Drinkability: Nary a bad drop of beer flows from North Coast. This is one of the best breweries out there, and this is probably their best session fare."
"D: Would be able to have another round, but it feels like a beer with not very much to offer in the way of flavor or mouthfeel. Given the option, I'd probably opt out of another one of these."
"The mouth is complex, again that great interplay of textures and flavors, slightly bitter but creamy and malty as well. It really sticks to the palate, finishing up slightly sweet. Drinkability to the moon--a great all occasion beer."
"NCBC is becoming one of my go-to's. This is another relaxing, very drinkable beer. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up a six of Red Seal and make a night of it."
"With a good spicy,white pepper dry finish.I like the fact the maltiness is not to sweet. And the hops give just enough bite to keep things exciting. But what really helps is the huge carbonation that lift up your palate.This is not your typical (APA) !!"
"Just comes in as an average beer. This one is good to wash down American food such as a burger or a hot dog. Definitly not something to try and find. Would stand out against the macro crowd, but not a winner against best in the style."
"Not too many bones to pick here. Relaxed, easy drinking, well made, California pale ale. I'll have a few more methinks.. Another winner from North Coast."
"Mouthfeel was zesty toward the middle of my tongue. Slightly watery. Thin finish. I will probably pass on this one in the future."
"Pours a very reddish amber with a sticky yellow tinged head. Aromas are very hop driven. Some piney resin smells in there, but the nose is pretty underdeveloped, mostly a nonspecific hoppy nose. Still, the palate perks up from there. Warming bitterness up front, present alcohol and citric hops in the mid-palate. A pleasing American Pale Ale palate; nothing special, nothing bad. Mouthfeel is much the same: middle of the road carbonation, imbalance toward hops (par for the stylistic course), dry on the finish. Overall, a decent pale ale that is easy enough to drink, but won't cause any revelations."
"D- always nice to have a pale ale, that isn't a toned down IPA. Sessionable, great flavors and flows smooth over the palate. I would have another if not a couple others."
"Pours a lightly hazed copper with an almond colored head. Leaves some broad lacing. Smells of pithy citrus and resinous pine with a background of pale and slightly toasted malts. Up front is a bright sweetness from the malt which segues nicely into the big citrus hop finish. Finishes with the lingering aftertaste of citrus rind and pine. Really crisp and bright. Not really all that bitter, considering the all that hop flavor, but it cuts the sweet just fine. Mouthfeel is of moderate body with rather soft carbonation. Really a refreshing, tasty, and sessionable APA."
"This is a nice drinkable APA with enough carbonation to cut through a greasy basket of fish-n-chips."
"Drinkability - this beer is as refreshing as a walk in summer rain. This is a wonderfully balanced beer. Unfortunately there's now only 108 bottles left, so I'm off to buy some more."
"D -"
"D- This beer has a nice little spicy hop burst and a soft malt backbone. Not much depth of flavor but very drinkable."
"12oz. bottle. Slightly hazy, amber colored beer, which sported a large, light-tan head. First impression of aroma was a Belgian style spice - coriander? This faded some, and then the hops came into play with a floral character. Phenols and malty sweetness were present, but secondary to hops. Flavor was a biscuity malt, with the hops moving to second place. Hops offer some balance throughout, but were most noticeable in the finish. I believe I picked up a hint of green apple in the flavor, and some pepper at the finish. A fairly light bodied beer with medium carbonation. This was a very sessionable beer which I enjoyed quite a lot. Not the most complex in the world, but simple pleasures are often underrated."
"Overall a very nice ale. Will it replace SNPA as my everyday? No. Will I buy it again? Maybe not, but that's only because the only place that sells it is also the only place that sells Indica (and many other things). Definitely worth trying though, and you can chalk up another victory for North Coast. Seriously though, try the Old Rasputin."
"The appearance is clear amber with a shrinking white head. The aroma has sweet fruity malts and grassy and citrusy hops. Fruity malts lead the way, picking up more caramel in the middle. Grassy hops come out just after the malts. Both contribute to the dry finish. This probably is a pale ale, but it has a bit of red ale in it. It's nice to get a malty APA thats still hoppy."
"Drinkability: For anyone who likes an APA, this is either known territory or something they should certainly have on their list to try. Its a good all around beer, no complaints from me."
"Dark amber to orange. Sweet honey, rose, and floral nose. Taste has plenty of fruity nuances; orange, pineapple and nice heavy hops that right up front. Medium body with cloying mouthfeel. The wonderful hops notes are retained in the finish. Excellent balance with malt notes of smoked barley, molasses increasing towards the end."
"While I wouldn't place this in my top tier of beers tried, I would say that the universality of its appeal makes it a winner; something that a mixed gathering of aficionados & Natty Lite drinkers could agree on."
"D: A wonderful example of a pale ale, and something I drink frequently. I highly recommend this to any fans of this style."
"Pours a nice burnt orange color with a 1 inch head, decent lacing. Smell is of faint floral hops and carmel. Taste is first a nice sweetness followed by some bitterness from the hops. A very nice mouthfeel and very drinkable during the miserable humid summers of the midwest. Overall a solid APA that I would drink again, although there are others that I would pick over it."
"Pours a copper-amber color with about a 1/2"" head. Looked decent on the pour. The smell is a little different than most pale ales. I noticed some mustiness which didn't please my senses; there's some hops in there too. Taste, luckily, is good. Hoppy with a hint of some fruit. The carbonation here is a little bit weird. Stings the back of your throat a little when you swallow. Medium to light bodied, and pretty easy to drink. The one I had a few months ago impressed me more than the one I'm drinking right now, so I think I'll go back to another Red Seal."
"I enjoyed this and would gladly drink it again."
"this copper brown ale features a foamy white head that's built to last. The nose portends of hops, hops, and more hops. Upon first sipping, you're taken aback, because the hops from the nose are not nearly as pronounced as expected. It actually comes across well balanced. There isn't much to the beer as far as mouthfeel goes, but it finishes fairly smooth and refreshing. Something you can drink all night long."
"Had this on tap tonight at Eli Cannons. Nice red color with a good smell of citrus but not to much as you would expect out of a red ale. Decent mouthfeel that did not linger in your mouth so that you were tasting it five minutes later. Was hoping for a little more head to get some more smell out of it but didnt see any, might have been the way it was poured."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium brown with some amber, a 1 finger head and decent lace. Smells of caramel malt followed by a nice hop floralness, neither of which over powers the other. Nice caramel malt upfront followed quickly by a hop flavor and bitterness. Beautifully balanced. A very nice example of the style."
"A well crafted and very enjoyable session beer. North Coast is quickly becoming one of the my favorite breweries."
"The same fresh tasting citrusy hops, with good caramel malt backing it up. Finish is fairly sustained, with grassy herbal hops with the citrus. All very smooth and balanced, without being at all wimpy. A pleasure to drink."
"Eric"
"D - not quite enough flavor to merit more than a 4, but defintely a worthwhile beer."
"I did think the finish left to much of a grainy texture on the palate hurting the mouthfeel."
"d - pleasant to drink and finishes very well."
"I'd probably throw this in the ""Amber Ale"" category, but as it is, it's a hoppy pale ale that is heaven-on-earth if you love Cascade hops."
"Just had some on talp, and it was one of the better APA's that I've had. The name pretty much sums the appearance of this beer, red. Had a good nose. Could definetly smell some ""C" hops in there, as I could taste them too. I thought it could have used just a bit less carbonation, but overall a good beer. I will definetly have again."
"Great example of a pale ale, and one that'd be good to introduce ""convertees"" to. I need to find this on tap."
"I was pretty unimpressed with this North Coast offering. It may be due in part because I've been drinking a lot of Alpha King and GD Fresh Hop, so that's not really fair. A drinkable, easy to find beer, just not very interesting."
"Overall, the maltiest apa ive ever had, i think (i wonder if this is an older bottle where the hops have mellowed out). Very nice though. very good balance."
"D: A quaffer to be sure. Always thought this was a red ale, what ever the hell you call it,it's damn tasty!"
"no flaws - a good everyday choice"
"This beer pours a beautiful dark ammber with a giant tan foamy head. Really nice. The smell has a real ""bisquity"" aroma,almost bakery like. The taste has a subdued hop presence along with some sweet malt making this highly drinkable. This really is an everyday beer that I would have if I lived on the west coast. Excellant job North Coast."
"This works very well as a session beer, as it is not too strong and quaffable, but with enough flavor to savor."
"CRUX: THIS WOULD BE A DBF STANDARD if I could get it where I live. Recommended Red Ale, and one of my favorites, as it's a simple way hopped red ale. Sessionable, indeed. Note: found a dust covered 6-pack in a local store once, was so glad to find it, I bought it; it was so-so: THIS BEER IS BEST FRESH! It's gotta be fresh. Live and learn...."
"Pours a beautiful amber ale with a nice head that stands still. The beers has a hoppy perfume with citrus overtone. Thick biscuity flavor and scent is also present. The beer is chewy with good carbonation. This beer I paired with different cheese's and is wonderful with each one. This is a great pale ale and a regular in my fridge!"
"always one of my faves for the warmer months. I actually think I prefer it out of the bottle however. still.. another winner from north coast."
"Drinkability: Red Seal is one of my ""go to"" beers that is always in my DBF. A highly drinkable session beer that is well balanced and with a 5.5 abv, one that is a tailgating favorite during football season. This is a beer that I have turned many macro drinkers on to with great results. One of the better APA's out there and one that I highly recommend. Seek and enjoy."
"Taste is heavy on the malt for a west coast APA. With a hop kick on the back end. Nice dry finish. Extremely drinkable. Should be a summertime staple beer that's always in the fridge."
"I love this beer. Great looking, a deep red hue that is a bit different than your typical pale ale. Some red ales are mild- this one is not. Nice hit of bitterness and somewhat tangy taste upfront, and the flavor continues until the end of the glass. This beer has good body as well- but it'snot too heavy and you can have multiples without feeling weighed down. This is such a consistent beer- great for warm weather when you want something a little more."
"Pours a cloudy red-amber color, with a sticky off-white head that retains very well. Aroma is sweet, toasted malts, with mild a hop note, and fruity esters...apple and pear I think. Taste is toasted malts up front, followed by a nice dose of hop and fruit notes. Mild alcohol bite warms the palate (pleasant), then finishes fairly clean with a slight hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is clean and slick, due to the medium body and subtle carbonation. This beer is closer to the English style pale ale, rather then the American style, but in any case, this brew is top notch! Very drinkable....I could kill a 6'er of this on a Friday night with ease! Great beer, nothing flashy, just damn good."
"An interesting brew. I first tasted this at Wild Wing Cafe in Marietta after a RedHook tasting, and i was pleasantly surprised then, so i decided to pick up a sixer and see what was waiting for me. For starters, the beer looks good: slightly cloudy red-orange color, cuddly off-white head with formidable retention and penny-penched lacing. An herbalesque nose, with a touch of coriander, orange citrus, and earthy (on the idea of peaty) maltiness. The flavor is wonderfully balanced, with a crisp bite and quenching burst of dryness. Obvious malt and trumpeting hops. Red Seal has a linger to it, but it's a welcome one. Almost a smokeless (natural) tobacco and fruity finish. This beer is, in my opinion, lightly weighted, which allows for easier drinking. You could put down a six pack of this with ease if you are a moderately seasoned beer drinker. Good beer. Period."
"Moderate mouth that has just the right amount of carbonation. While the nose falls abit short, the flavors make up for it resulting in a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability- I hope this one hangs around for a while in my area. This is one of my absolute favorites, every time I drink some I like it better."
"Clearly used American hops, which I like. Good to feel the hops taste and scent."
"overall, this is a very exceptional little ale. I love the hop flavor and balance in this one, a real winner! i could drink these all day long."
"Overall = A decent beer to sample. I think there's better out there though and probably would not have more than one of these in a sitting."
"Overall- a delicious Ale that you could pound! Going from the gym to the bar and ordering this I easily polished it off under 2 minutes! The perfect beer for a hot spring afternoon!"
"Beer pours with one fingered head atop a gorgeous clear red body. Not a ton going on in the nose of this one, some slight hop aroma and and a touch of maltiness can be detected. A fairly well balanced beer with a good blend of mild hop bittering and malt undertones. Not overly chewy or cloying. Carbonation is perfect in the mouth and it finishes as strong as it starts. This could be a great session beer."
"Red Seal was erecently introduced in the Swedish Systembolagets stores. Considering the richness of American beer making today there are to few US beer available here, so this is a welcome addition. The beer smells like a ale should and has a nice amber color. The first taste is of sweet malts followed by a hoppy bite. After that the bitterness dominates. It is perhaps too bitter for my taste but it's definately a well crafted and well balanced beer."
"For a red/amber ale, it is not so hot, as I more so expect a less hoppy, sweeter, malty, darker pale ale from the bottle--more akin to a mild brown ales, even. But I don't enjoy most pale ales, so I was a little disapointed here. I absolutely prefer this to most if not all straight (truly pale) pale ales, but that is more a style preference. If this is instead just a ""dark"" pale ale, well, okay, than for this is fairly drinkable within that style. As an amber, per what I was expecting, it misses the mark. So, different than I was anticipating. By itself, apart from all stylistic expectations, this is a good beer, granted."
"I think this one may spoil me...it is very, very sessionable and one I think I'll be keeping in the fridge."
"Color is a wheat field of amber. But what really seems to shine is the head, well maintained and very solid. Only about a finger and a half worth from initial pour, but maintains a very thick foam throughout the entire beer. Not to mention some very consistent lacing. Smell was a 60/40 balance of hops and dry malts, the hops making up the 60%. taste was just the same, a little more hops than malt in the balancing act. Not bad per se, just something I noticed. Hints of seltzer water mixed in with the dry malt flavor."
"Medium boied, easy to drink and enjoyable if you like this kind of hops (I do). Well worth a try."
"This is a solid well hopped pale ale but I dont really like it. It has a solid hop kick (in fact, more so than most of the style) but I dont like the hops used and the malt backround does not balance this beer well at all. Tastes like the finishing hop is cascade. I wish I knew what the other hops used were. This has notes of grapefruit, flowers, cellar mustiness, tangy and spicy hops and a pretty long and lingering, but unpleasant, finish. Also, for being 5.5%, the alcohol is pretty noticeable."
"-SS"
"The flavor was better than I expected. Nice moderate hop character with a malt backbone that stood up to give it a balance that most American amber ales lack. Nice and smooth across the mouth, the hop flavor expandes across the tongue and deep into the swallow. Nice finish, slightly dry but not so much as to leave you parched. Easy drinking amber ale that I would recommend."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and generously carbonated."
"Deep red/copper body with a head that stayed around for a while. The nose was citrusy and had a nice caramely base to it, the malts smelled exceptional. You get more delicious malts with caramelly tones with the citrus hops there, but not in the way to make this beer experience too dominated by either the hops or the malt. A very well balanced beer, and another I will be seeking out again, great beer I could have had many more pints of."
"Red Seal is a hazy copper with plenty of carbonation. Head is tall, creamy, and tan. Retention is very good. Aroma is of a enticing citrissy hop atop a sweet caramel malt. Citrissy hop is the first flavor noted, which is soon taken over by a combination biscuit and caramel malts. Finish is nutty. The is exactly what I desire in an amber ale, full flavors that are nicely layered coupled with a great drinkability. This is easily one of my favorites of the style."
"Such a straight forward pale, near perfect. Right up there with Sierra Nevada Pale ale in my book. A bit milder in the hop profile and oh so complex that it doesn't ever get boring."
"Got a growler of this last evening. More or less just got it on a whim, as I wanted to try something that I have not had before on tap. Luckily I was not disappointed in the least. The color of the beer in the growler was a amber/orange color. When poured from the growler a nice head was formed that was the color of off white hedging on a tan color. Had a good retention leaving lacing around the sides of the glass. The aroma is very nice, citrus and floral hop smell. Definitely can pick up the grapefruit like esters. Also has a nice malt scent of caramel malt that is noticeable, as the hop scent does not seem to be overpowering. Brew has a very smooth taste; nice amount of hop flavoring is noticeable and does leave some of its essence on your tongue. While the hops is most noticeable they dont seem to dominate as I am able to clearly pick up the balancing of the malts that lead to a somewhat caramel flavor. Over all this was a fantastic brew, one that I can/could drink a fair amount off. The growler was gone quite quickly! Will look for this one again in the future."
"Poured out a nice , dark hazy copper-amber , with a 1/2 inch head. Taken to the nose , flowery-fruity hop smells , also some sweet malt. Taste is an exellent blend of the malt and strong hops. Starts of with a slighty sweet breadness then quickly turns to citrus, bitter, mildly herbal, and a floral hops punch. Beautiful west coast APA. A superb, great tasting and hoppy beer that is in my fridge almost all the time. I appreciate beers like this one sooo much. This is my pen-ultimate session brew , Damn! , what a fine job the brewers at North Coast did with this beer."
"Opinion: I really like this beer. I am not a hop-head, but this beer really agrees with me. It has an assertive hop bill, but manages to have enough malt to give it a run for its money. I will be drinking this one in the future...guaranteed."
"The mouthfeel is generously carbonated. Prickly and stingy. The drinkability is good also. This might have a shot at becoming my favorite red beer. Definitly worth a try. Cheers!"
"north coast is such a hit or miss brewery. However, I know alot of people who like this beer so what can I say: different strokes ..."
"Another winner from North Coast."
"Flavor starts with some caramel but rolls to grassy and herbal hops quickly. The beer is smooth and very easy to drink. Still a winner in my book!"
"Pretty much a solid session ale. Nothing too good or too bad about this one. Fairly refreshing. Could make a good cross-over/bridge beer between a BMC offering and a nice IPA."
"This beer came in a stubby twelve ounce bottle, it poured a hazy orange color with a thick off white head. It has a citrusy hoppy smell. The taste is pretty fairly balanced between hops and malt. It has somewhat of a lighter mouthfeel than I expected. Overall, I'd say this would make a good session beer, I could drink this all night. Recommended, I wouldn't go looking for this, but I would probably buy it again."
"This beer pours a bright orange amber with a light white, smooth head. Smells like powdery, lager-like caramel with a clover floral hops. The flavor begins with an oatmeal and honey malt with the big grassy organic floral hops accompanied by a fine electric sourness. Finishes with a lager-like dry pastiness and a hint of pine. The mouth feel is light bodied with lots of small bubble carbonation. This isnt a bad beer at all, but it isnt very inspiring."
"A red ale that is amber in color with a thin off white head on top. Aroma is light of hops and malt, nothing overwhelming. Taste is the same malt up front with a light hop feel in the end. A very crisp finish in the end, nice and noticeable. Balanced is a way to describe the flavor of this brew. Nice feel in the mouth and very easy to drink, little weak in the aroma but makes up in flavor sums up this brew."
"Drinkability  Very refreshing. Not overwhelming hops but plenty to satisfy. A bold interpretation of the style. Try it if you can get your hands on it. (No freshness dating)"
"In short, another fine North Coast brew with alittle something for everyone."
"An interesting interpretation of its style, and a very easy-drinking beer with a respectable amount of flavor."
"This is a great burger beer. Hell, give me some grapes and cheddar cheese and Im happy. This beer surprised me. I had it before but I just drank it without thinking about but, I put my beer cap on it tasted much better! I love when beers fool me like this. Im happy I can get this beer in Council Bluffs, IA. I will get more. It is a good drinker. Try one."
"Pours a soft brown color with sublte red hues. A strong head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing behind. Aromas of yeast and different types of sugar seem to come out. The taste is as would be expected for this style with a more balanced malt & hop profiles. However, the taste does not linger; it quickly engulfs the tongue and is gone leaving little evidence to suggest it was even there, including an aftertaste. Without compelling flavors or unique characteristics, this beer isn't something I would want on a regular basis, but in a single sitting I could have more than one."
"All and all, a good drinkable beer."
"Medium body, somewhat chewy, crisp hop finish, lingering bitterness, goes down easy. A well-balanced beer that still shows off some malt and hops. Nothing spectacular, I think this'd be a fine choice for a friend who hasn't tried much besides macros. Session starter."
"The mouthfeel is thin, slightly metallic, and has a decent bitterness to it. Not too great, but it's a good drinkable ale for when your palate doesn't need to be completely bludgeoned to death by complexity."
"Pretty average in my opinion, didn't really stand out. I'm not a huge fan of this style though, so take it for what you will. Pours a reddish amber, decent head. Light floral hops and some sweet malt present. Tastes slightly hoppy, slightly ""buttery", and a little malt sweetness in the end. Really a nondescript beer that could have been made anywhere really. Not one of North Coast's finer offerings. This is what I consider ""safe beer"" that places looking to give the appearance of being ""up scale"" use by offering craft beer, then taking each brewery's most boring, nondescript offering and stocking it. But at least they're trying, right?"
"Served in a pint glass, this is a bright orange-red with some chill haze, a slight head, no lacing. Nose is a sweet slightly caramel malt overlaid with light floral hops. Taste is caramel malt, slightly buttery, with a slight amount of flowery hop flavor. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth drinker. This isn't a bad beer, but nothing really stands out and makes me want to order it again."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent session beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Red Seal ale pours out a slightly hazy amber color with half an inch of head. The aroma is malty, creamy, and fruity with grapefruit-like hops. Fruity malt flavor with a little caramel. The malt tastes just a little toasted. Some grapefruit flavor from the citrusy hops. Good balance between the malty sweetness and hop bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel. A simple, but delicious pale ale. Good drinkability. This would make a great session beer."
"Stumbled upon this one at a small corner beer and cigs store.Sparse head,light carbonation nice medium amber color.Solid malt start,excellent hop finish,very balanced,a little thin not to complex,very drinkable.Going back for some of Red Seals' other offerings.Love this web site,first review"
"Very agreeable amber with a gentle flavor and smooth balance that is quite enjoyable. One of the best within the extensive amber style."
"Medium bitterness with a healthy dose of sweet malts. Mildly crisp fruity notes and esters make it resemble a pale ale. Mouthfeel is very chewy and creamy but gives way to a bitter hop finish. This makes the red seal extremely drinkable. It is well balanced and with a smooth front and crisp finish. Im not sure that it will please the hardcore hophead but its certainly a nice sipping/session beer for me."
"Drinkability is good a nice tastey amber ale from North Coast. If available would be in my DBF. Want to thank RedwoodGeorge for this sample."
"Great all around malty + hoppy; Good to have....all the time."
"A much nicer beer than the Redhook IPA that I just drank. The colors are very nice--maroon or burgudy, very clear, well headed with some lace. Aromas are a nice balance of solid malts and American hops. Spicy and grassy in the nose with a plumb and dates like sweetness. The flavors are malty and hoppy as well. Good complex malt flavors bring out ripe plumbs, light syrup, and a light grain flavor. Hop bittering is big. This beer should be an APA rather than an Amber (if it were not for the color). The body is medium with much roundness in the clean malt texture and the hop bittering. Never astringent. Finishes clean and modestly dry. A very good beer for any occation."
"As a big fan of ESB, I think this beer qualifies as a good drinkable example. I realize it's categorized here as an American Amber/Red Ale, but I think American-style ESB would be appropriate. It's well-balanced between malt & hops, with a bit more emphasis on hop bitterness than on hop flavor. Aroma is malty/bready and quite pleasant. Definitely a beer I could sit and drink happily while watching a football game. Much better on tap than in the bottle. I'm a huge fan of North Coast's Pranqster & Old Rasputin, but Red Seal is the best ""session"" beer they make, in my opinion."
"as the beer exited its very attractive stubby bottle with the red seal on the label, it entered the glass as golden amber liquid with sparse white head that quickly fell to a thin ring. Smell is a fruity hoppiness that seems unique and very enjoyable. Taste is a nice mixture of flowery, fruity maltiness and background hoppiness that slowly becomes more prominent.The two blend to forn a nice taste. Finishes a little more dry that I would expect ( and would have enjoyed) but is still pleasureable. Nice easy drinking beer."
"I could make a night of drinking this."
"Pours a nice deep copper cdolor with a small head that falls to a very slight cover over top of the brew. The nose is slightly spicey from the hops with a slightly biscuity/bready background. Very interesting. The flavor is just okay. The flavor follows the nose very closely. Biscuity and bready with a mild spiceyness behind it. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, an okay brew. It doesn't so anything to stand out to me, but its not bad."
"Copper-colored, slightly hazy with a low but thick beige head that seals the liquid below away from the air. Aroma is sweet bready malt, some ripe fruits and cinammon, and pineapple hops. Flavor is nice and malty, bready and even, not sweet. Citrusy hops give a slight pucker followed by a spicy tingle, and a bit of a tannic fruity finish. I'm enjoying the simplicity of this one - doesn't try too hard with any of the aspects, but has a good balance of malt and hops. Damn tasty and very drinkable. Good session beer, would go well with lots of foods. Thanks to Brent for passing it along."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer. Although not quite at the level of O.Rasputin or Pranqster, still a good and recommendable beer from N.C.B.C. A bit pricey to have on a regular basis, but good change of pace from I.P.A.s every once in a while."
"It is a very good drinker. This is surely one of the more fortunate amber ales I have had the pleasure of consuming. Another solid diplay courtesy of North Coast."
"Overall: A really nice brew that is well balanced and displays both malt and hop chracteristics nicely. Could definately be a staple in my fridge."
"Bought a pint of this at the bar adjacent to the brewery. Bronze coloured with a big head and marvellous slightly citrus, very herbal nose. Hops dominated with a very distinctive lemon rind flavour to the fore. Malt was apparent, but very much in the background. Good carbonation helps to make this eminently drinkable."
"Notes: I like this, a nice American ale."
"A pretty solid Red Ale and just about spot on for the style."
"Slight amber hues with medium head. Aroma was generous portions of malt with little else. The mouthfeel, being cask-conditioned, was the highlight.Taste was malt-loaded with minimal-to-nothing hop character. Not too much balance. For me I like a little more balance in my pales. A good beer for those who fall on the malt side of the fence."
"This would be a great ""session"" beer. It has interesting flavors and smells, and I could drink this all, or probably not quite all, day. Recommended."
"Deep copper-colored Red Seal is a very standard brew, resembling a pale ale with training wheels--hops in moderate doses, more than a macro but less than a braver micro. While I love hops, the hops in this one weren't well-chosen. There weren't many other tastes in this one. Nothing wrong, but nothing special about this one."
"Nice red ale. I'd have it again, especially if it was fresh on tap."
"Appearance is medium amber, nice white foamy head that reduces quickly with a minimum of lace. Aroma has notes of plums, honeyed malt and hops. Initial taste is about like drinking half and half straight, slightly sweet from malt, but soon replaced by leafy hop esters. Finish is nice and dry, slightly bitter. Interesting!"
"Overall: Nicely put together and pretty drinkable to boot. Cant believe that I never picked this one before now. Tasty stuff. Recommended."
"Drinkablity? Again, some of the notes to a red didn't seem like they were there, but this is still a good ale , no question, but not enough to make me want another when there are more definate styles/lower priced beers. Still, an average drinker."
"Bronzed amber, like a red seal's coat perhaps? Topped by a small, tight, light tan head. Nose of caramel, rich cookie dough, sweetish pear brandy. Solid, sappy, Westcoast bitter hop nose. Very nice. Modest malt flavors up front. Cookie-ish with caramelly sweet tones. A dash of fruit. Toasted bitterness follows. Deliciously bitter resinous hops into a bitter, crisp finish. Some lingering caramelly malt. A very good American amber. Very solid"
"Deep copper color with an ample head that laces down the glass. Faint malty aroma, good burst of carmel malty flavor with a good jolt of hops that comes in at the middle and stays for the finish. Very smooth with an excellent balance, If this is a red ale it is the best one I have had of the style."
"Typical red ale here. Not bad, not great. Poured out to a darker amber color, with hints of redness when held to the light. A touch of lace around the glass was noted, otherwise lower carbonation. Scent of barley and hops were present, as was a touch of yeast. Taste is good, but a bit on the blah side. Bitterness of hops and malt are detected, but a strange pine like quality is also noted. Finished rather clean and crisp, with a bread like aftertaste. Worth a try."
"Chalky malts and fruity hops fill the flavor. Has body to it. Very slick and buttery on the tongue. Finishes warm for something with such a low ABV. Drinkable, but in an uncomplicated way."
"Taste is citrus hop laden with a mild astringent twang at the end. The lemon and orange rind taste is couple well with the hop bitterness. All in all a pretty decent brew, although I don't see what all the fuss is about."
"This is a descent ale. It pours a nice copper-red color. The head was minimal. The smell has pleasant with a nice mixture of malt and hops. The taste was on the bitter end. While not a bad ale, this isn't something I would really suggest (considering all the options for a good ale of this class out there)."
"Not bad, but there's better out there."
"Pours as a copper-amber color with a bubbly, foam-like white-ish head. Slight hops in the aroma, but nothing pronounced. Theres a wood and dry nut character in the smell as well, with a dryish alcohol undertone. The taste takes the hop experience up a few noches. Very pronounced hop bittering, thats eveident from the first sip. Its very nice indeed. Theres some pine and tart citrus in the finish. Just a small amount of sweetness in the front, but overall the beer is fairly dry. Medium body, with notable carbonation. All in all, this is extremely drinkable."
"This is a very good amber and I've been passing it up for years. Yikes? So I'll be getting this more often, only if I know for sure its as fresh as this sixer I got today was. It just came in, so... It's good stuff."
"Pours a golden, amber color with a frothy white head that settles in a minute or so, with little lacing. The aroma is a floral hops bouqet, followed by a sweet caramel malt scent. The taste beings with a bready, and sweet caramel malt taste followed by a grapefruit and overall citrus hops flavor. The finish is a grassy, eathy hops taste that lingers on your mouth leaving a dry, bitter finish and a warming sensation. This is probably the hoppiest red ale i've tried and its quite good if not overly complex. Quite drinkable and very enjoyable it has the makings of an excellent (if somewhat pallate numbing) session brew."
"Comments - This is an awesome ale - there is nothing mellow about it. Highly recommended."
"Tastes of crisp fruity malt. Lightly sweet. Pervasive understated bitter hops. the bitter and sweet interwine and come to a static balance. Very nice. Medium bodied with a crisp dry aftertaste. Very good. Really drinkable."
"Overall, I found it unexciting and rather mediocre. I'd take a Levitation or a Cinder Cone Red over this any day."
"Pours a deep amber reddish color. Thick off-white head. Good retention, not much lace. Smells are slightly grapefruit, and apple. Caramel malt flavor, with a good amount of bitterness. Citrusy hop flavor. Not overly bitter for an APA. Medium body, moderate carbonation. A good APA, very good session beer. Not overwhelming."
"Taste is light to medium-bodied, highly drinkable pale ale. Dry malt character. Strong but well balanced carbonation dominates alot of the taste. Bitter after with unpleasant metallic edge."
"Bitter and hoppy. A palate cleaner, and good after fish and tasty salad. Was good at below room temperature and at it. Fresh and refreshing. A smooth drink and our group could have handled this all night. Medium mouthfeel, a session ale. Some malts, piney floral. big hop bubbles in bottle."
"Sparkling orange, capsized & carbonated head with some mean lacing. Light nose, mainly floral hops and some grapefruit rinds. Sweet and twangy, bitter hops backed large citrus offerings in the way of freshly squeezed lemons and orange juice. A pretty decent malt based backbone, patches of caramelized sugar with warming. Pretty laid back for an APA, dont be taken though, tasty and session-able all the way!"
"I find this to be a great session brew. I poured my 12oz bottle into a pint glass which showed a nice copper/amber hue. The aroma was a pleasant piney hops which seguayed to a great taste blending the hops and barely. A great balance finishing on the hop side. A good light to medium body... I think I could drink this all day. A damn good brew."
"Out of 12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. Color was a dark orange with a reddish tint. This was a very good beer. One of those red ales that leans more to the hop side, almost like a little heavier bodied and bitter pale ale. Similar to Stone Levitation than any other red/amber ale I can think of."
"This is a fine American micro-ale with an interesting fruity taste and a mouthfeel that is more common among cask conditioned ales than bottled ones."
"Such a great beer! Pours a hazy red-orange with a sticky white head. Smells malty and plenty hoppy. The taste is very balanced. There is enough citrusy hops and barely to go around. Has a tangy aftertaste. Meduim mouthfeel. I must say most west coast pale ales tend to go over board with the hops (which I do enjoy), but sometimes it is nice to drink a West coast pale ale that is balanced. A top notch brew, very well done!"
"I feel like I've had this beer a million times but I've never reviewed it. It's on cask regularly at a couple bars around town (Moon & Sixpence, County Cork) but the bottle has a lot to offer too, with a smooth crisp refreshing mouthfeel and a slightly more outward hop quality. This is another fine California pale in stubbies (Sierra Nevada, Steelhead) which are all quite distinct, but interchangeably good. Red Seal is maybe the darkest of the bunch, even approaching robust red ale territory, with lots of malt and lots of hops. The hops do leave a lingering mark on the tongue which I personally am not crazy about, almost a burnt rubber quality, but many a hophead will love this very same aftertaste. Another very good beer from North Coast, and a bit stronger-tasting than Sierra Nevada so it might not win as many converts."
"Good beer, nice apa, though its not really my type."
"Notes: light-medium body and has a very light astringency. It's good, but I wish it had more hop flavor."
"Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, a perfect beer for mass consumption. Finishes with a touch of toffee malts quickly overtaken by floral and pine hops bitterness. An excellent beer, it has certainly made it's way back into my regular rotation of beers."
"Body is medium, carbonation average, and texture is clean."
"Drinkability- A bit better than SNPA. A bit different though. Still would be a good session beer."
"The only thing about this beer I didn't care for was the clean mid taste, it was too much like water for me and just destroyed the character of the beer. But all and all it was a quite enjoyable beer that I would recommend to anyone."
"My co-worker gave me a few bottles of this one night after work and I must say I was impressed. It pours a cloudy orange with a cornbread colored head that was nice and creamy. The head sat about a half inch and disipated about a quarter of the way through the drink. The aroma is predominately malty with a light hop smell. The taste is very well balanced between the maltiness and hops. It carbonated just right with a medium body. It is a very drinkable beer and I would recommend it to anyone."
"This is an exemplar of almost perfect hoppiness, especially since a lot of red APAs can be way too bitter. A very nice beer."
"Pours a cloudy orange brown with a decent loose formed head that is fed off of 4 or 5 lines of carbonation, A hoppy and fruity smell greets the nose... head retention is great.. first sip is mildy bitter followed by a rose?? petal style flavor that works its way back into a majority hop aftertaste with very minor undertones of the malts. A good hop!! Hits the major areas of the tongue but doesnt hang around... mouthfeel is normal."
"Pours out a deep copper color with a nice 2 inch almond-colored, frothy head. Gradually settles to a thin collar with some average lacing down the glass. Smell is pleasant, but not very well expressed. Notes of malt and perhaps a slight hop floral aroma. Taste is definitely one of the stronger suits for this offering. Nicely balanced maltiness with well expressed hop bitterness. Finishes sweetly, but contains a complex bitterness that lingers long after the final swallow. Overall, a nice flavor. Not world class, but well above average and true to the style. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy with just the right amount of carbonation. I would consider this a beer worth trying, and definitely one I could see myself drinking again and again."
"Average, there are way better red or pale ales out there."
"Drinkability is certainly high - I can't wait to go get some more!"
"Overall, this is a good brew. Definite session material here."
"A pretty drinkable beer with a meal. A very good alternative to a macro, but you can do better in the beer aisle for the same price."
"It's very full-bodied for the style, without being at all offensive or hard to deal with."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: It has a medium body and decent but not active carbonation. It doesnt feel overly heavy in the mouth and that makes it a good session ale."
"North Coast makes some seriously great beers, I don't know who they're trying to woo with this one."
"Pours a nice amber red with orange highlights. The head is a nice off white then resides to a fizzle. Lacing will coat the glass. The smell has a great hop ping, with pine and strong citrus blessing the nose. The tase is a nice smooth caramel malt then a blast of lemon and grapefruit take to the buds, hoppy and crisp, a refreshing ale goes great with meals. Very drinkable."
"The Taste starts with a very clean hop taste, very similar to the smell, with citrus, pine, etc, then clears up to leave a very nice balanced malt taste. Very clean and refreshing. Mouth is very smooth with a medium body. I really wish I had more then just one of these, I enjoyed it thoroughly after work and would love to polish off a couple more."
"Cask at the brewery Tap House in Ft. Bragg, California. To me this had more interest than the regular tap version, basically due to the cask character, the hops and malt seemd to have more character, but in saying that, it wasn't a giant leap above it. Citrus and caramel were still there, just had a touch more character."
"Served in a pint glass. Nice crimson/copper color with a nice amount of carbonation that turned to lacing around the glass after a while. Smell was hoppy, malty, spicy with some nice citrus and fruity tones underlying. Taste starts out quite hoppy and citrusy with some big malts mixing in the middle to make this a big, bold, flavorful beer. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel was medium. Quite good, I had this when I had some cod in lemon and thyme crust. Went well together. I have to buy a 6 pack of this stuff next time I go to Town & Country."
"This was an awesome pale ale from beginning to end. It poured a darker color than I was expecting for a Pale Ale with a dark amber color and a great frothy head that lasted till the end. The smell was quite full of citrus backed by a slight malty presence. The flavor was totally unexpected with a very big hop presence that was perfectly balanced by its slightly sweet maltiness and very creamy mouthfeel. One of the best West Coast APA's I've had."
"A very enjoyable and very drinkable brew. I'll be enjoying this one again."
"The Red Seal poured a medium copper with a nice medium density head. The lace played about the glass like a childs toy. The head did not, however, retain for long. The aroma is a fruity hops with just a hint of malt. The taste yields a sharp citrus bite up front, that mellows to a hoppy middle. Just a hint of the hops on the back of the tongue where the malt comes out. It has a great medium to light mouth feel. Great drinkability. I have a 12-pack in the fridge fortunately"
"Very flavorful ale from a great brewery, excellent drinkabilty."
"I had this on tap at Hard Times in Herndon Virginia. Pours a slightly murky deep copper color with a finger worth of white foam on top. A ring of lace hovers around the brew after the head dies down a bit. The aroma is an even mix of sweet caramel malts and citric bitter hops, very nice and very balanced. I would say the taste is exactly like the smell you get hit with sweet caramel flavors at the front before it fades into a nice citric bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good and on par with what you would expect of a good APA. This stuff couldnt be more drinkable, it is tasty and very easy on you palette and it goes down oh so smooth. I could easily drink this stuff all day. Great all around beer that may not challenge you but it will satisfy you."

"This is not a masterpiece on par with Old Rasputin, but a stylish workaday brew. The finish is broadly bitter without being too demanding on the palate."
"Pours a very different-looking cloudy deep copper in color with a lasting layer of white lace that hung around for the duration and contributed to the appearance by ringing the glass with lace. Aromas are mostly citrus in nature, though there is some caramelized sugar in there as well. Flavor is a balanced blend of malty sweetness up front that quickly tapers off to an earthen/citrusy bitter aftertaste. Nothing too complex with this one. Very easy-drinking and one I'd love to try again sometime."
"A dark amber ale with a creamy off white head. Has a sharp hop aroma with just a hint of grapefruit. The taste starts with a little malt at the tip of the tongue.Then a sharp hop bitterness with a light touch of grapefruit rushes over the sides of your tongue followed by a crisp easy finish."
"I like North Coast's use of the stubbie, and this pale ale pours out a breathtaking deep ruddy semi-hazed copper hue, a rich gold/amber when held to the light. Minimal head, but I hardly missed it staring into that enchanting body. Thick, chewy caramel malt on the nose, blended seamlessly with flowery citrus hops, just an enticing sweetness to it all. The flavour delivers everything that has been promised so far, the malt and hops dance step for step in balanced unison, sweet malt and sweet flowery hops in a star-studded blockbuster musical from the 40's. Full mouthfeel that becomes almost but not quite oily on the finish, maintaining that smooth velvety character while the texture alters slightly but holds its integrity. I was a sucker to only buy one of these, and given the chance over again, would be laying down cold hard cash for more to fill the fridge with. A fantastic pale ale, and a fantastic intro to what North Coast is capable of producing."
"Poured a Thick white head that subsided moderately atop a deep copper pale ale. Aroma was strong of hops but just as the head subsides the whiffs of hop aroma dissipated leaving one desiring more. The taste is excellent and i believe to be a prime example of an American Pale Ale with a northwest touch. Malt profile like an english pale ale but generously hopped with American varieties. The body is just a little light but overall this beer is a good pale ale that exemplifies the style."
"Bottle: Poured a dark red colored beer with a nice head with medium retention. Aroma is quite nice with floral hops. Taste is even nicer with a hops heavy taste leaving a quite important bitter finish. Could have profited of more spice and a bit less hops; I believe taste would have been more subtle and complex. Im still looking forward to trying more products from North Coast."
"I like that they have put more into this than just hops I love hop, but in a Pale Ale I typically want some balance."
"This one is good to the last drop. Highly recommend."
"Notes: This is a staple beer in my fridge. I like it a bit more on tap, but I will certainly never pass up a Red Seal."
"This has some pretty favorable reviews here, and i was sucked in by the ""one of the ten best breweries in the world"" on the label, but i can't say i was overly impressed. I found this to be a fairly solid, but unspectacular brew. I enjoyed the nice, but typical amber color with a nice fluffy head. The smell was dominated by what seems to be cascade hops. The taste was good but typical pale ale, not all that well balanced, but there was some malt. The mouthfeel was rather nice, medium body with carbonation that awoke the mouth. All in all very solid but unspectacular. But good enough to motivate me to try something else they offer to see if they warrant the 10 best in the world ranking."
"This beer was solid in the categories of appearance and smell. Nothing special, just done very nicely. Red Seal really sets itself apart in taste though. The hops come through very strong (stronger than the alleged IPA that we had had earlier). The taste finishes surprisingly dry. In fact, this is one of the more dry beers I have tasted. I highly reccommend Red Seal."
"Comment: I'm sold! a great beer, the most impressive thing was the big hop flavor without oppressive hop bitterness"
"This is just a great after-work relaxing kind of beer, certainly one that will become a staple in my fridge. It is much better than SNPA and will likely replace that."
"The body on this beer is a little thin for my liking, but this does give the beer a higher potential for long drinking sessions."
"I remember absolutely loving this beer when I first tried it. I still think it is a great pale ale, but these days I detect a certain ""roughness"" in the overall presentation. The hops are balanced by the level of malt, they don't really seem to meld together as well as they could. This, however, is just nitpicking at a very nice American pale ale, There are certainly tons of pale ales out there that can't touch Red Seal with a ten-foot pole."
"Easy drinking beer with perfect crisp mouhfeel and carbonation. An enjoyable beer here!"
"Red Seal poured clear and amber/red into a glass with a small head that disappeared into some wisps of white by the time I took the third drink. I didn't get much of a smell off of this one except for a little hop bitterness. There's pepper-smooth and then there's the bitterness, that's its gig. Tastes fair but not amazing, worth trying out."
"The head is cream-colored, dense, medium in size. It's a clear, red/amber beer with nice, sticky lacing. Nice hops in the sweetish nose. A touch of sour milk creaminess too. A bracing, hoppy front sweetens to a milky middle. Just a little watery tasting when cool. Dark malt turns hoppy bitter in the finish. Some pepper makes an appearance. A nice, bitter but refreshingly mild APA."
"Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale falls a notch short for me. The promise of the aroma and the initial several seconds on the palate isn't realized in the end. However, it's still a well-made, drinkable beer that gets a Red Seal of approval from me."
"Medium body, good carbonation. Malt sweetness combines with a crisp hop feel and moves to a light bitterness along with a very light bread flavor. Leaves a light bittersweet aftertaste. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a glowing amber color, nice thick head of large bubbles,decent lacing. Sweet candy grapefruit, hoppy aroma. Medium body, soft and creamy mouthfeel, beautiful hoppy citrus and caramel flavors, a great session beer, very easy to down a few. I am glad to have this available again."
"A random and welcome sighting because I have heard good things about this brew. The best thing about this beer was the deep golden clor of the beer. The beer smelled of ripe fruit along with the hops. It was very smooth. Not bitter at all. Along with a pretty good hops flavor, the beer was smoothed out with a sweet malty flavoring. The finish was quite good and I would have happily ordered another but I was driving home."
"Thoroughly enjoyed the quality, wonderful taste, and accessibility of this beer. Poured into a goblet, beautifual reddish amber color with a cascading foam, nice carbonation and a wonderful nose. I detect fresh baked bread or fresh cut lumber. Residual sweetness hits you at the beginning but finishes in a nice mellow way, distinctly dry and very pleasant. could I say that this is a wonderfully balanced beer. I think that this is a very good representation of the style. I would very much like to have this on draft as I think that drinkability is exceedingly high. I also think that this would be a good beer to transition people to craft brews. I will be buying and drinking more of this in the future."
"This beer pours darker than any other pale ale that I remember experiencing. It's burgundy red in color with a medium sized super white head. Smell is quite bitter which threw me off a bit and maybe yeast, or atleast some kind of spicyness/slight sourness in the smell. Taste is very complex and big for a pale ale. Hops are the first thing I experience. Intense bitterness up front. Malts come in and add depth to this beer. Caramel is the main malt flavor I detect. Barley comes in next. Hops smooth out and are more flavorful towards the end but finish bitter once again. Very thick body, ingredients are a little rough with one another. This wasn't as refreshing as I had hoped, but I still got to give them credit for producing a pale ale of this depth."
"Drinkability is very high, could polish off a six-pack with some tunes on a Saturday night pretty easily."
"Red copper ale under a low white head, that soon vanishes. Sour hops aroma and taste. Tastes a bit syrupy, with a musky rinse of an old sock in the finish. It's not enough to be objectionable, but I'm not interested in having another."
"The beer pours a reddish amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent with a citrousy hop aroma that is very pleasant. The taste is good. It has a nice balance of pale and crystal malts as well as a dry bitter hop finish. It has a watery mouthfeel, but it is still a damn fine beer. It is low bodied and well carbonated. This is a fine red/amber ale. It has nice hop content and malt balance; a good drinker."
"Overall, Red Seal is a nice, drinkable, tasty brew. Many thanks to Shiredave for recommending it. I could easily add this to my regular selection of friend friendly brews."
"Pours out with a rich cream colored rocky, sticky and bubbly head that slowly takes it's time receding over clear medium amber/rusty liquid. Fresh bitter hoppiness mixing with an underlying caramel maltiness and fruit notes makes up the nose. The taste is a very flavorsome blend of perfectly balanced hoppiness, both bitter and very flowery fresh. Gentle maltiness coats the tongue, and some light frutiness tasted...very appealing! Drinks just way too easy, finishing on a long balanced hoppy/malty note. Fantastic stuff, one of my faves that I'm glad to become reintroduced to, it's as good as I remembered."
"I've been waiting to try this for some time now, wish I had it on tap but had to deal with bottled instead. No problem. Pale Ales are one of my favorite styles and it's very hard to find one that really stands out without becoming something different like a light, boring IPA. This is a true west coast Pale Ale (APA?). Poured a deep amber with a red hue and light wispy off white head with nice solid lacing down the glass. The smell was pretty hoppy with a nice fruit nose (citrus, but not acidic) and grapes, maybe? The taste was heavy on the pine and citrus hops, very nice juicy fruit notes and a very solid malty caramel backbone. A little chewy (which I like) and full bodied but crisp ---- the fruit overtones were right on. The mouthfeel was very bright and crisp with bitterness lingering way after the last sip but I wanted more of the same after the first bottle. This is very drinkable brew and with a decent ABV (just right, not enough to kill a horse) this is clearly one of the best sessions brews as well as a serious Pale Ale/APA. Right up there with SNPA, Liberty Ale and that's about it."
"More hometown goodness. This one shows a nice pumpkin orange body with ample carbonation and an average tan head with good retention and sticky lacing. The aroma, as expected, is dominated by piney/citusy hops over a quite warm malt background and a subtle alcohol smell. The taste is superb, and better balanced than many APAs. A flavor of toasted wheat greets the tongue, and then the flavor becomes progressively more bitter before closing with a tingle on the tip of my tongue that has a distinctly medicinal feel. Notes of sweet citrus are here as well, and a distinctive malty aftertaste that lingers long. A very fruity tasting APA. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style: just slightly chewy and coating in action. Drinkability is top-notch. Distinctive!"
"Jen at MacGregor's always does this to me. I ask her to pick one for me, and it's always the perfect beer. North Coast Brewing always makes a great beer. This is no exception. It pours a beautiful orange amber colour with a moderate head. The aroma is citrusy with a huge blast of hops. The taste consists of hops hops and more hops. Citrus, pines, orange. Fantastic. It has a wonderful spicy finish that can't be ignored. This is a great pale ale. Something that should be tried at least once in everyones life."
"Strange thing is I expected this beer would suck, Nice that it did not ""Suck."""
"Crystal clear, with a dark orange amber color. Head is full, and recedes into a thin layer on top of the beer, leaving little bits of lace trailing the sides of the glass. THe smell is very sublte with hops and malt and yeast (perhaps ringwood...?) present, and a sweet appley smell with hints of fresh flowers and spice comes under further inspection. The taste is quite complex, although all the flavors are very light. There is a butter taste, some good malt hints, and a citrusy tone, with the typical hop flavor blending into a nice light bitter aftertaste. There are very subtle floral grassy hints. The mouthfeel is wonderful, and as I drink this, I can only picture myself enjoying it on a nice warm summer night, sitting on a porch on a lake. It would be a wonderful light summer beer, chilled to perfection."
"Pours a hazy orangeish golden color with a small creamy head. Beautiful aroma of hop bitterness, along with some oak and and light citrus. Amazing hop profile on the palate, again with some citrus, grass, and light astringency. Nice, creamy mouthfeel, finished with a lingering bitterness from the hops. Along with Mirror Pond, I'd say this is the perfect American Pale Ale."
"An awesome brew, and a brew built this solid deserves accolades. The near perfect amber color is set off nicely by the sticky lace and just right headage. A superb balance of malt and hops, with the hops in the lead, while the malt takes a best supporting role. The nose tells the same tale. Gorgeously refreshing and fullfilling, this is a beer pretty much without flaw, though it ain't spot on perfect, and it doesn't want to be-a beer for all. It has been gone from the Chicago scene for a year,and now it is back. One of my all time faves. Welcome back you slippery seal, and stay on shore awhile this time."
"I saw this on the top of a shelf in the back of a local beer store and it was not priced but i decided to buy it and give it a try seeing who i never hear of it, i think i bought it for a quarter. I was very suprised when i poured it out, it was a nice pale ale and it was full of hops aroma and flavor. When i drank it i just sat back and sipped it tring to enjoy every drop. When I bought one for my friends to try I got them hooked on it. Well done."
"Pours an amber-copper color with a gorgeous beige head that lingers, finally settling and leaving lightly stickly sheets of lace. I'm not going too deeply into the smell as I am a bit sick, but there is sweet, sophisticated amber malt with a nice blend of cawscade hop presence. The taste is quite intruiging. The hops take the real presence. A brilliant mixture of cascade, and... dare i say it, sweet saaz hops perhaps? I am very happy. Very nice pale ale."
"This is one of my favorite beers to drink, one after another."
"Dark orange with a half-rocky white head that settles to a ring of suds. An occasional patch of lace forms on the side of the glass. The aroma isn't as big or complex as I'm used to with good pale ales, but it's certainly not bad. Nice rind-like hops with cereal-like malt in the background. The flavor has all of the great things I expect from a west-coast pale ale, very crisp with cereal grainy malt and great rindy bittering hops. Perhaps not as hoppy as some, but still excellent. Hops do come out more at the back, leading to a crisp dry finish with a slight sweetness to help it down. I'd definitely have several more of these. I'd be happy drinking this all night. Dangerously drinkable, very crisp, and downright tasty. A great pale."
"It's hoppy, it's malty, and oh my is it good! I was happy to find it locally after some nice reviews by a friend in CA, and I am not disappointed. There's no olfactory rocket science here; there's a malt/hops balance, with each element trading dominance a few times, making for a refreshing ale. There's no muss, and no fuss, just the basics, and there's no way I stop at just one of these. It just goes to show you: sometimes, simple truly is better."
"The flavors work well, but are a little heavy going down. Still, a great brew."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is a rare combination of light body and big taste, which makes it a great session brew. A unique, enjoyable red ale."
"Served from a bottle, cold. Appearance was an orange/copper with a nice tan colored head. I found the smell to be quite hoppy with caramel malt undertones. The taste was a nice bitter hoppiness, very well balanced with the malt. I also detected some citrus and slight alcohol flavor in the back ground. Mouthfeel was excellent, the carbonation had some bite and it was crisp. Drinkability was excellent also. I wish I had more than one in fact. I will defiantly try this one again in the future."
"Poured a murky, dark ginger and caramel color with a khaki head. There's a distinct hoppy aroma, coupled with a tangy lemon substrata and some malts lurking around somewhere beneath that. The initial taste is less hoppy than I anticipated from the smell, but the hops become increasingly assertive as the taste lingers. Bubbly carbonation creates a tingly mouthfeel."
"Pours a clear copper red amber with tightknit beige lacing. Bubbles rush to the top of the pint glass. Head has excellent retention and laces all down the glass. Aroma is tart and citrus, while floral hops creep through with hints of orange blossom. Well carbonated and light to medium in the mouth. Taste is well balanced, pine and grapefruit mingle with a subdued malt background of darrker fruits and a touch of toffee. A solid, good drinking pale ale that has many characteristics of an IPA. This would be a nice one to stock the fridge."
"Pours a clear golden copper color with a thinnish beige head that leaves good lacing. West coast hops and biscuity, crystal malt in the nose. Tastes malty sweet with a hint of tea with the floral hop pungency showing up near the finish. Definitely not overwhelming; good balance to it. I always thought Red Seal was an IPA, but I guess it's a pale. Too thin to be an IPA in by assessment. Nonetheless, a quality beer that I""ve enjoyed for years. Now if we could only get more Old Stock ale sent to my neck of the woods..."
"Wonderfully drinkable."
"The amber beer arrived at the table with a low and very persistent head which laced the glass. The aroma was hops, malt, and caramel. Excellent hop bitterness and caramel flavor. The finish is caramel and dry bitterness. The bitterness dries even further on the tongue. Good drinkability."
"If you had a pocketfull of cash, this would be the perfect session beer. It is rich without being overly sweet. It is hoppy but no overly so, even though I might argue that its malt exoskelton isn't as thick as it could be. Overall, the beer just has a pleasing taste that is well-hopped. Mouth-drying but refreshing. The paradox of the hop."
"Little 70's album rock humor there."
"This is a solid west-coast offering, comparable to some brews from Lagunitas or Stone. The very bright hop character does limit it's drinkability, however."
"This is what a pale ale should be. Malty with a lot of caramel coming through, just a hint of diacetyl, and a nice balanced hop finish. Very clean and tasty. Nothing takes away from this brew."
"was a bit disappointed with this one, though it's still not a bad brew overall. it pours a light amber colour with a minimal head that leaves a slight stickiness but dissolves rather quickly. smells mainly of hops, with malt present along with floral, earthy and citrus smells. the taste is rather hoppy, more than i cared for. it was closer to an ipa than a pale ale in my opinion. a subdued malty flavour was evident in the background but the hop dominance was just too much here. again, not bad, just not as good of a balance in the flavour as i had hoped for. it's an easy drinking brew that i'd visit again, but have to remember that it's got a bit more of a hop kick than a traditional pale ale."
"This is not one of the best beers I have ever had but it is pretty good and I definitely like to try it again."
"Although the hops play around in my mouth for quite a while, there's not a whole lot going on here besides the hoppiness. So it loses some points for complexity in my book. I certainly wouldn't mind having more of this, but I won't go out of my way to do it."
"Overall Impression: A good beer with classic Pale Ale citric hop notes, but the hops are a bit over the top for me. I love hops, so this isn’t a fatal flaw, but I was hoping for a bit more of the malt to come through. Drinkability was impared a bit by the bitter."
"Nice head to start but not much lacing. The nose on this one is great, sweet hoppy goodness. The malt is up front but a nice west coast hop zing to follow and not over powering. Has a great malt flavor that really sets a nice base for the super fresh hop attack. Hops are citrusy and lingering, a great pale ale, circa Sierra Nevada. This one has a delicate and light mouhtfeel Really like this one more and more."
"This ale poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled. The smell was a nice balance of floral hops and malt. The taste was malty with a good dose of floral hops. There was also some bread in the taste, and a decent amount of hoppy bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and relatively clean but with a nice, lingering mild flavor. The body was medium. This was a very nicely drinkable ale."
"It really does look spectacular and is well deserving of the perfect 5.0 rating on Appearance. I found it to be more balanced this time around both at the nose and especially at the taste. My fasted beer of the night comment that I wrote under Drinkability still holds true. It is difficult not to gulp down this ale. Another gem from North Coast."
"Pours a vibrant clear copper with a thick off-white head that just won't die. Nice lacing with some clumpiness as the head finally does recede. While I wait and watch, an almost toasty malt aroma hits me followed by an inviting floral hop aroma. There is a nice contrast of malt and hops in the flavor as well, with a crisp finish. Hoppy bitterness lingers on the palate, but is not unpleasant. Overall a nice example of the style."
"Pours with a red-copper color and an off-white head that slowly diminishes into a fine lace. Aroma is malty with a woody hop character. Hops are abundant in the taste, but not overly bitter. Caramel flavor come through making it quite enjoyable and drinkable. Send some more of this east."
"Beautiful coppery color with a beautiful head that laces well....Smell is beautiful floral hops with a hint of malt. Taste is very nicely rounded..initial smoothness followed by a hop essence that is just right and that lingers just the right amount of time. Mouthfeel is good with a medium body and a nice crisp feel. Very easy to drink...excellent balance...a real treat...I'm glad my store stocks it!"
"Pours amber in color with a creamy white head. Floral hop and citrus aroma hits the nose right away along with a light scent of caramel malt. Medium-bodied mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. The hop flavor shoots immediately to the forefront and remains the dominant characteristic throughout. Malt background is subtle. A light fruitiness can be detected just before the bitter hoppy middle. The finish seems to thin out both in hop flavor and texture. An easy drinking American Pale ale, just not overly complex."
"Overall, a good American pale ale. Leaning a bit too far into a bitter hoppiness for my particular taste but still a pretty tasty brew."
"Another quality California Pale Ale; as good as Sierra Nevada, though sadly not as widespread. This is certainly a beer that I'd drink again."
"Pours a warm copper with light orange highlights. It's light tan head starts strong and holds well with solid lacing. The aroma is a bit subdued, but has a good balance of citric, earthy hops and crackery, caramelly malt. I detect a slight minerally presence. The flavor balance is skewed towards the hops, with the crackery malt providing a very solid backbone. There's a fair amount of bitternes and lots of citric hop flavor: grapefruit and lemon. Some pine resin as well. Medium in body, with a touch of acidic dryness that appears on the tail end. The flavor thins out a bit towards the end, but still manages a decent finish. A solid example of the American Pale Ale style."
"Pale Amber Color, medium white foamy head. Spicy hoppy aroma. Medium bodied Amber ale. Roasted malts, heavily hopped ale. Fairly simple taste, good flavor, nice balance of hops and malts. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly spicy, somewhat bitter."
"A very tasty pale ale....Pours a deep golde with a big pillowy off white head...rims the glass very nicely..nose is more floral and herbal than citric...a nice bready malt profile on the nose....smells like an English Paler Ale...Relatively hopped up on the taste...still getting more English Pale Ale qualities than West Coast American but this is definitely got a better hop bite than most English style pales...maybe a bit of pine like notes on the buds too....mouthfeel is very tight and crisp....medium bodied...very drinkable...a quality pale ale....not one of my all-time favorites but one I could certainly enjoy every day of the year for the rest of my life...a, solid, quality pale ale a tier down from the elite ones...."
"Wow, I love this beer--even more than I thought I did before I sat down to review it. I don't know who Ruedrich is, but this brew makes me want to kiss him (or her--which would be better for me, anyway)."
"Hazy, dullish copper. A soft and creamy off-white head recedes to a thin film rather quickly. Great nose. Spicy hops and thick caramel malt mix together wonderfully. And they are present highly detectable levels. This is a nice tasting amber. Heavy and sturdy caramel malts lay the foundation. Spicy hops do their thing. And some bready and yeasty qualities add complexity. And a bitterness to linger as well. Nice medium-full body and creamy mouthfeel. Highly drinkable."
"Excited to try this beer. Cool label with a red seal on a stubby bottle. Poured copper color with a soft white head that receded into a mass of sticky lace and thick slick. Smell was pretty decent, with floral hops and a bit of metallic malts. Hops were subdued in the taste representing a nice bittering effect and plenty of rose petal like notes. Malts kicked in with bready sweetness sharing space with a toasted, buttery effect. Mouthfeel was crisp but appropriatly subdued. Very tasty pale ale in my book. A steady, easy drinker that I could have all the time. Pale Ales are a great style."
"F"
"I'll admit to feeling like I was finished with this style of beer about 10 years ago, but this is a prefect example of raw, rustic American craft pale. Obvious, but thoroughly competent at that."
"The Rathskeller Wine & Beer Fest:A small sized white head with fine sized bubbles.The body was clear with no carbonation observed.The hue of this APA was amber and the flavor was bitter from start to finish and it had a lingering aftertaste to it.The mouthfeel was smooth, thin and medium bodied."
"Flavor is mainly hops, with a slight yeasty breadiness and an adequate malt foundation. Slight grassiness, with plenty of citric tang in the finish. A bit coarse, with a grainy aftertaste. I guess i really wasn't into a hoppy beer at the time. Tasted like a light IPA to me."
"Excellent bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. I imagine this would be stunning on cask. Many thanks to MJR for toting this sample back from his vacation!"
"Very drinkable, not complex, hoppy."
"It's a bit too bitter and sharp for me to give it a better drinkability score, though. But, a good beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a reddish-amber color with two fingers of head, and lots of lace. The smell is rich in hops and citrus, much like an IPA. Smells very enticing. The taste is a reflection of the smell, just a little weaker, but very well balanced. Hints of orange and grapefruit blended with the right amount of hops. The mouthfeel is very nice and strong for a pale. The drinkability is fantastic, and I want more!"
"Notes: Very good example of a West Coast pale ale; slightly overhopped to be considered well-balanced, but quite tasty nonetheless; not dramatically dissimilar from a good number of high quality APA's out there."
"This beer pours a dark amber color with a small head and almost no lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice - some spices and maybe a little orange. The flavor is nice and hoppy with some US hops with some caramel as well. The body is moderate and the drinkability is ok"
" A perfect starter beer for the new commer to craft beer."
"Served in a pint glass, this reddish orange beer was topped by an off-white head the clung tenatiously to the sides of the glass. The lace looked like little lines of plaster on the glass. The aroma was a good balance of caramel maltiness and sharp hops. The taste was also very well balanced, with just a bit of sweetness slipping between the very smooth hoppiness. Long, lingering bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is also enjoyable, and this 20 oz glass didn't last long in front of me. I've bypassed this beer for a long time, and now wish I would have given it the respect it deserves. This is a very solid session beer. Truly good in every respect."
"Very drinkablle stuff indeed"
"Full bodied and very creamy with sweet malt up top that is quickly knocked out of the way by the hops. Slightly spicy, definitely bitter and all hops. Raw hops that finish somewhat dry, but are balanced on the end again by a slight sweet malt finish and some alcohol notes. Very nice, orginially I didn't not like this ale before I became more accustome to hops. This is a hop heads pale/red ale dream. Great brew."
"I enjoy this ale. It is definately worth a try. North Coast, ""Keep em' coming."""
"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy amber, with a smallish head, that quickly receded. Some lace on the glass. Aroma is all hops. Taste is just the right blend of sweetness, and hop bitterness. smooth clean finish. Very good mouthfeel, a very good session beer."
"This beer poured a nice amber that was clear and offset well by its relatively thick white head. The lace clung to the side of the glass long into the beer session. The aroma was of hops as was the taste. It did not overpower me. Of course I had just finished an IPA and a Loft both of which come much hoppier. The citrus still makes the top of my mouth dry and I left the bar an hour ago. It is a good pale ale one that I would recommend someone trying to find an example of style."
"A good beer, however, and one that I know I will have again. My plan is to start with something milder and finish with the Red Seal."
"Pretty straight-up American pale ale, a la Sierra Nevada and Co.. Hop bitterness is detectable in the nose via some citrus fruits and an kitchen herb garden from across the room. Bitter throughout with a crisp, quick, dry finish. The hops definitely push the malt aside a little. Flavorful but not overkill, this is an easy-drinker. Not at all balanced as far as I'm concerned -- this is hop attack after hop attack after hop attack from first scent to last drop. Very crisp."

"This is a truly great beer! I knew, after the first sip, i knew that this was a finely crafted brew. Poured out a bright amber color and had a thin and creamy white head. Big citrus hop aroma with hints of flowers there too. Nice malt body beneath all those hops with some oak and caramel coming through. Finishes very clean, crisp and dry. Very tasty! An excellent beer that's almost perfect in my book."
"Had a solid session-ale mouthfeel and a moderate length dry finish that left salty and leafy bitterness behind. Very tasty as you can smell and taste the high quality ingredients and craftmanship. Easily a favorite for me in the everyday kind of ale category."
"After consuming nearly two cases of my own homebrewed red ale, I was a little tired of the style. I worried about my objectivity, and fairness in rating this one. But overall, the Red Seal met or exceeded any expectations for the style, and I enjoyed it. From the bottle, it poured a light red, almost orange color. A majestic appearance, it held a thin but fluffy head, and really impressive lacing. A pretty nice hop bouquet was evident in the smell, with just the right touch of malt. Interesting grapefruit or banana smell somewhere in there, too. The taste held a nice hoppiness...bitter but counterbalanced well by a sweeter malt presence. It reminded me somewhat of an IPA with obvious red ale characteristics. The crisp, clean mouthfeel was full of flavor, and nice and fizzy on the tongue. My homebrew didn't kill my taste for the red ale, and the Red Seal has kept me interested in this appealing style."
"Dark amber with an orange hue. The off-white head is frothy and foamy and fades to a thin covering. The lace hangs around awhile and sticks in a few places. The sweet malt and fresh hops vie for king of aroma. The caramel malt is sweet and a little doughy. Citrusy and floral hops are in abundance and well conceived and expertly executed. The brew is well balanced and very drinkable. Improves throughout!"
"*I also reviewed this beer in bottle and cask-conditioned... in my opinion, the draught is the way to go."
"(almost three years later, I finally tried this again. What a difference three years makes. Not bitter or dry, a very nice Amber. I'll have to test it against Dead Guy and a couple others of the style, but this is one ""good drinkin' beer!"""
"I've heard good things about this ale so I gave it a shot on a recommendation. Poured a copper red with a short but adequate beige head that dissapeared quickly. A surprisingly malty ale and a little heavy on the bittering. Noticed an immediate bitterness at the back of my throat and a slight aftertaste I didn't care for. Slightly higher in carbonation than other ales I've had recently in the same style. Has a wonderful creamy mouthfeel to it, although the bitter aftertaste will probably prevent me from buying again."
"Pour is a medium red, with a medium sized, medium diminishing white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is floral, piney, grassy, and citrus from the hops, with some mild caramel maltiness in the back. Flavor has light caramel start, some apple poked through in the middle, and then a bunch of hops come in to leave a wonderfull bitter and lingering aftertaste."
"A good beer. It was not what I expected, but it was a very good beer."
"The nose is highly hopped and gives just a hint of malt. Taste is much the same with a high level of bitterness. Good body and some cream sense, but a long bitter aftertaste takes away from the overall enjoyment. IMHO this is an OK beer but rated too highly in the style."
"Pored a nice orange/copper/red color. Nice head that lasted a brief time. The aroma is that of yeast and malt. I noticed a strong floral taste that hit me right away. That is followed up by a nice hop bite. There are quite a number of tastes which makes it hard to categorize. I call it delicious!"
"This is a nicely done beer, that melds english and west coast hop characteristics."
"A delicious blend of hops here. Just enough spiciness to keep the hops in domination at the start. Then the taste begins to get malty and it is just great. I did not use to like red ales, but I have really started to get a liking for them with the help of Humble Patience and this brew. Very smooth with light carbonation, this is a great beer to drink. You could definitely have a few at a sitting."

"This pours a nice tan color. The head was weak. There is a moderate hop nose. The flavor is very strong aggressive hoppiness. If this one is too cold it won't be god. It like a barely wine needs a chance to warm up a bit if served on draft. After warming a bit the flavor is exceptionally well balanced, the malt and hops close the gap and just tickle the palate with complexities. The very bitter after taste tend to linger excessively."
"While living in California this summer this beer was at my fingertips, they stalked it at the local grocery store. I somehow managed to pass on it every time we visited to pick up a sixer. Here I am back on the East coast, and I am still able to get it thanks to D's Six Pack. The Red Seal Ale pours amber with and orangish tint, and it's complemented by a nice full cream toned frothy head. The lace forms with the first sip and continues to stick throughout this beer's existence in my pint glass. The aromatic hops leave me wanting to sip on this beer, but there is also some malt sweetness detectable in the background of the aroma. The first sip, very well balanced with the sweetness of the malts attacking my tongue, and the hops being there to wash everything but the mellow bitterness on my tongue. Very enjoyable, complex with a dry finish that makes these flavors all work together very nicely. I am a fan of other brews I tried from North Coast, namingly the Imperial Stout. This proves they have range, with a medium body this beer has a semi chewy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, could picture how this stuff tastes on tap. Wouldn't mind enjoying a few of these at a time, but one is just as enjoyable, well made handcrafted brew here folks."
"Color is dark orange, head is fine, off-white, but a bit short. The nose, however, is in a league of it's own. Bristling with hops, bursting with fruity and spicy notes. Citrus, grapefruit, peach and more. An aggressive, and tasty, hop attack on the palate, suitable malt back-up, but hops are really everywhere and what this delicious ale is all about. Warm, rich, and rewarding, Red Seal is among America's top ale's, hands down."
"Caramely gold in appearance, topped off with a finger's worth of cakey off-white foam. Light but persistent carbonation cuts up through this clear pour. Wonderful hoppy, floral nose with a bit of spice thrown in for good measure. Malty and full up front with a semi-bitter effervescence that builds and seems to crawl back along the tongue. Fuller in feel than many pale ales but still possesses the requisite crispness. This one was a pleasant surprise; its reasonable price made me expect less."
"Noticeable reddish and very cloudy hew once poured into the glass. Just the whispiest of heading bubbles which quickly subsided. Aroma was a great abundance of hoppiness. First taste provided a rather bold bitterness; subsequent sips revealed much more malty character with fine balance. I am not sure of this one; hence my 3.5 taste ranking. I suspect my bottle may have lingered around a bit? My first North Coast Brewing (Mendocina County, CA), hoping some day to try more."
"Pours a clear amber with a small, white, foamy head that comes back with a simple twirl of the glass. The aroma is mostly hops. Malt and hops come through well balanced in the taste. The hops take over quickly and then provide a long bitter aftertaste. It's very crisp and enjoyable though, not overly bitter. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a very refreshing and smooth beer. I will be buying more of this when summertime finally rolls around."
"pours out a hazy, cloudy, darker amber color. thin, wispy head that leaves a nice bit of lace. delicious malty aroma, balanced with some of those aromatic and pungent northwest hops. tastes absolutely delicious....a fine balance between the bready, nutty, caramel laced malts and the chewy citrusy hops. what's nice about this american pale ale is that it seems to lean more on the malts rather than the northwest hops. a nice balance between the two gives way to a nice full mouthfeel. wow is this a fine brew!! full figured body....ample balance...beautiful taste...sweet smelling...smooth finish...teasing aftertaste...high drinkability...what more could you want? a top notch american pale ale. i'll be drinking more of this!"
"The slighty chill hazed copper body is topped by a rocky head more than three fingers tall. Outstanding lacing. A strong, grapefruit nose, with a hint of background pine. A nice malty backdrop starts the taste, but the story here is the grapefruit grove of hops which arrive shortly thereafter, and hang around long after the actual beer has departed. Rich and silky and oily, the mouthfeel is wonderful. Drinkability? One of the few quality beers I've had four of in an hour. Simply a great American Ale, whether pale or red. Welcome back to Jersey."
"Pours an orange amber color with a bubbly white head that dissipates into a nice amount of lace. Nose is dominated by sweet grains with notes of floral hops and a bit of fruity citrus. Taste starts sweet and crisp followed by a strong amount of hop resins, acidic citrus, and bitter grapefruit rind. Malt backbone does a nice job of holding everything together. Finish is crisp and dry. This is an outstanding American pale ale. Possibly my favorite example of the style."
"I enjoyed it. Cheers!"
"Well, this was something on the shelf so I decided to grab a sixer and try it out. Nice copper color and there was a great head on the initial pour. Head fizzled out after a couple of minutes though. Decent amber taste...almost like a McTarnhan's. Hints of carmel and citrus on the nose. This was a decent beer, but probably not worth the $8/six-pack the store was asking for."
"If you're ready to jump into the world of west coast American style Pale Ales this is a good place to start."
"Honey colored with a sticky white head. It gives you a nose full of hops with a bit of sweetness. The taste is a real pleasure: a little citrus with nice malty sweetness and a good dose of hops. It has a terrific creamy feel, contributing to a very nice experience overall. Why would someone ever buy ""Poker Beer"" when beers like this are already out there?"
"First, this beer looked great while being poured.  It was a true thing of beauty to watch the head being formed.  The head is three fingers tall and caps a copper colored brew.  Citrusy smell predominates.  There is more maltiness flavor then I remember the last time I tasted one.  Ah, there it comes.  The hops is staring to ramp up after a few sips leaving a bitter taste on the tongue.  Still I'm surprised at the maltiness flavors, I remember this being more hopped than I taste.  Of course, I just finished an IPA so that may have something to do with it.  Maybe a hint of caramel?  These go down easy."
"This is, by far, one of my favorite brews on the market.  It is crisp and clean with some noticeable hops going on as well.  It has as well balanced flavor and mouthfeel that allows it to be paired well with just about any kind of grub.  If you can get your paws on it, do so.  You will not be disappointed.  Prost!"
"A cloudy deep orange-amber with the head is voluminous in size and the texture semi-creamy, the color a toothsome light tan and the resultant lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt with a definite hop floral aroma, citrus crisp and clean, start is sweet with a pleasing malt profile and the top light to moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has a stinging acidity with the hops powerful in their spiciness and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting."
"Red Seal Ale: wonderful looking beer, deep amber color, and thick off white head that leaves substantial lace down the sides of the glass.  Full aroma, markedly of hops.  Very nice taste, very prominent hops, with more than a hint of malt sweetness, notably caramel. Warm aftertaste, with a dry crisp bite, and alcohol warmth.  Very nice ale."
"Red Seal was a pleasant surprise for me. It pours a nice copper hue with an orangish tint. The head is off-white and rather creamy. The nose is of hops, some citrus, and a bit of malt. This beer tastes great. It has some of the citrus aspects in addition to a well balanced hop-malt combination. The mouthfeel is creamy with an oily character near the end. The drinkability is quite good, also. For me, this one definitely has ""session beer"" written all over it."
"Clear amber with a reddish-orange tint and a full, fluffy off-white head that has excellent retention and leaves some good lace. The aroma is mainly of floral, grassy hops above a light caramel malt background. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is nicely creamy. The flavor offers a good combination of malt & hops. A gently caramel malt is backed by a solid, well balanced bitterness, and full of hop flavor with just a slight citrus note. A long lasting bitter and hoppy finish rounds it out. This beer is restrained enough to act as a cross-over beer for the uninitiated, while offering enough character and bitterness to hold the beer aficianado's interest. Extremely well made. A very drinkable, and enjoyable beer."
"Slightly hazy reddish / orange hue, topped by an off white well retained heterogenously bubbled head that leaves sparse lace. The aroma is a combination of medium caramel, berry like fruity esters and a crisp, citrusy Cascade hop nose. Flavorwise, this brew is skewed towards hop bitterness which is assertive, but not overbearing. Caramel malt sweetness & biscuit malt offset the hop bitterness, leaving this brew fairly well balanced all around. Expectedly citrusy hop flavor. Moderately bodied, w/ carbonation lower than the norm that adds to the drinkability. Finishes w/ a fading extension of caramel malt & moderate hop bitterness. Red Seal Ale exhibits balance, excellent drinkability & has a touch more malt character than the typical pale. It could serve as both a flavorful session brew and an enjoyable pale ale to be savored."
"Red Seal Ale on-tap was very smooth and had a slight sweet velvety finish. Beautiful golden color with tight foam around the glass. As it warmed up it seem to creat a different complex of flavors! Very little bitter after taste! But, hoppy enough to enjoy."
"Slightly better than average Pale Ale. Some of the strongest hops flavor I have ever experienced. Is that the norm for West Coast Pales? Dark gold in color. Crisp with a nice finish."
"Pours a copper color, with a sticky, frothy off-white colored head. On the nose is a wonderful floral hop aroma. On the palate the hop spiciness is pretty much the whole story, along with a light/sweet fruitiness. Very enjoyable thougha very good pale ale."

"Had this on tap here in North Carolina,poured a deep amber with a creamy slightly off-white head.Nice balance of roasted grain and caramel mixed with a citrusy west coast hop profile on the nose,flavor like the aroma is very nicely balanced roasted and lightly caramelly sweet up front but a healthy dose of pine and grapefruit in the finish makes a great beer.."
"Very nice amber - reddish color and very average on the aroma.  An easy beer to drink that won't make you beg for more, but that you would not hestate to try again........CHEERS"
"Advocates i'm sure you will all agree cask is where it's at. My apologies to my pal Jaybeerman who is probably wanting to kill me right now. this is a fine beer that of course is even better cask conditioned.  It takes on a much smoother mellower quality in this form.  For all you California advocates get up to Fort Bragg.  For everyone else, if you're ever out this way this fine brewery is worth checking out."
"It poured out a nice reddish gold color to it. It formed a nice dark white head which it held with a considerable amount of lace. It had a nice aroma of hops and another aroma I couldn't place. The same was true of the taste. Had a nice taste and finish to it, but the flavor I couldn't place, which may have to do with my preferance for dark beers over red ales. A good beer and worth checking out."
"Deep tea with a persistent head and fine lacing. Hop fruity nose. Citric Cascade flavor over a smooth malt spine. Ignoring the weighty price, Ruedrich's is a perfect food and session brew. Hop and clean."
"Rich reddish brown color contrasts nicely with a thick off white head; sticky lace rings the glass.  Pleasant spicy aroma with strong hop notes, sweet aroma, and fruits.  Tasting yields a rich malty flavor, followed by strong hops and bitter citrus, slightly sweet towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy.  A very pleasing pale ale."
"Pours a nice reddish orange with a creamy off white head that has good retention and rings the glass.  The smell is this beers weak point as it is a little thin but there is a nice hop presence in it.  The taste is excellent.  Nice smooth hoppy start that is balanced by just enough malt.  Nice citrusy hops stay tangy on the tongue even after you last sip is gone.  Very clean and smooth in the mouth with an excellent drinkability.  This is definitely one of my favorite APA's right up there with New River, Alpha King, and Poleeko Gold.  With the exception of their pilsner this brewery doesn't make anything but great beer."
"Excellent golden-amber brew.  Nice, thick head that fades just a bit too quickly for my taste.  Still, a thin lace covered the top of the beer until the end.  Hoppy aroma and taste.  Malty caramel taste also present, and even begins to become prominent as the beer warms.  Went very well with a chicken parmesan sandwich and a few games of 9-ball."
"Nevertheless, quite easy to drink and enjoyable.  All complaints are superficial.  This is pretty choice stuff"
"This may top my list for favorite American pale ales. Not quite as malty as solid stand-by Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and not quite as hopped as trusty Anchor Liberty Ale, and thereby a pretty darn perfect balance in my book. Very smooth and well crafted. Hopsters - seek this out. Will be a regular in the garage fridge."
"Light amber color, sticky head. Butterscotch malt with a high hop spice to balance. One of the more complex Pales I've had -- cascades and caramel flavors dancing back and forth. Pleasant enough to drink though there's not a lot of distinction here. I've had some that tend to sour..."
"Copper colored beer with a thick bubbly slightly off-white head that kept very well. Spicy hops in the nose with hints of clove and caramel. Awesome balancing act with slight grapefruit and clove-like spice in the hops and a slightly burnt toffee and caramel taste to the malt. Very slight esters from the yeast, mildly strawlike and bready. Easy drinking, beautiful, exceptionally well balanced beer... easily a true classic and favorite..."
"Firm bitterness with enough malt to go around, great mouth feel that is pretty crisp which is key for the pale ale style. Shame we can't have this one around the Boston area ... this is one beer I really miss."
"My god, this is an impressive brew.  Rich, complex, satisfying.  Red Seal is a potent interpretation of the American Pale Ale.  Spicey and herbal notes on the nose.  Love that sediment.  Beautiful!"
"This was at one time a mainstay in my fridge until distribution in NY was discontinued.  A fabulous, hoppy but balanced pale.  C'mon NCB, bring it back to NY!"
"Notes: This could easily become a regular in the fridge. An outstanding interpretation of a Pale Ale (West Coast style), well balanced and full of complex flavours. Thanks to NCBC for supplying fresh samples to review."
