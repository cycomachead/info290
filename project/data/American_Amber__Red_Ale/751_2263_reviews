"Golden and light amber. Half finger off-white head with low retention and spotty lacing. Lightly spicy aroma, some maltiness, some floral notes. Not very aromatic in general. Tastes of coriander and moderate bitterness accompanied by a malty finish. Smooth mouth feel with some carbonation. Somewhat acidic feel on front of tongue. Leaves a mildly drying sensation, with very slight chewy character. Overall, good winter style ale that is not overwhelming to palate and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable nonetheless."

"Spicy, malty nose. Pours brilliant copper tinted amber with a 1” finely bubbled, lacy white foam cap. The palate is creamy, fruity, with some bread, citrus and light melon. Light sweetness on entry that dries out by the finish with light traces of astringency. It has a medium body and carbonation. The carbonation is natural and not harsh. Easy to drink."

"Pretty nice winter warmer and think it rates slightly higher than the current 82 it's receiving on BA...cheers!"

"Smell wasn't very potent but smell and taste was very good. Went down very smooth especially for this abv."

"Overall – A rather tasty and nice brew overall.  Good flavor with a lighter alcohol hit and a good sweeter and maltier taste."

"Doesn't taste like an Amber Ale, more like an English-style Pale Ale.  It's an excellent beer!!"

"Poured a nice slightly-lighter-than amber color from the can in to a nonic pint glass. 1 finger of dense off white head. Earthy hop aroma. Taste matches the nose with a warm alcohol finish. Flavor is influenced by the yeast, it gives a slight warm doughy element. This is classified differently on different sites. Big Sky says it's a style they came up with. But really, it's just a high abv pale ale that uses very earthy hops. Not bad, not something I'll have again."

"Pours a pretty amber in color with a small off-white head that lasts a while. A good amount of lacing is seen and stays around. The aroma is of hops, citrus and chocolate malt. The taste which has a lot going on with roasted malts, caramel, citrus and some spice. A slightly dry and bitter finish but drinkable."
"Overall: a pleasant sipper on a cold winter day and appropriate to the style."

"Pours from the bottle a clear amber with a big foamy head. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is of biscuits and caramel. Both come through predominately in the taste, along with a bit of coffee. Hops give it a touch of bitterness and warmth. Medium mouth. This is a really nice beer for a cold winter evening."

"Overall not a bad brew, especially for a cold fall or winter day."

"Poured into pint glass. One of my top Montana beers, and a stiff one at 7.2% abv. Darn near fully clear in appearance. Very refreshing, almost a fall ale more than winter. Its got warmth but its not fireplace heavy. Good and bitter, almost pale ale ish. Love it."

"Poured light amber with white head that fades into thin lacing. Doesn't smell or taste like much. Alcohol dominates the flavor, and there is relatively not that much alcohol. I've drank this beer since high school and it has either gone down in quality or failed to keep up."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Dark hue, continual effervescence, slight head and lacing. Nose is Yeasty with some pine hop. Yeasty, hoppy, and a little sweet. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"O: Decent overall, a pleasant amber ale with a nice underlying hop presence."

"Overall an unusual amber. Almost an Impy Amber if such a style exists. Needs more spiice and malts for a winter warmer. Otherwise a tasty brew."
""
""
"This beer strikes me as more of a pale ale than a red (perhaps an ""Imperial"" pale?). It's very drinkable and quite good, and makes a good session brew if you don't mind a little buzz..."
""

"light and sweet and awfully german for the style. not a winter warmer in my book, too light on the malt, an almost golden brew, not much head to speak of, but an impressive aroma of german hops and honey sweetness. the flavor matches well. its balanced but easily malt forward, not spiced like so many are, but warming in an alcoholic sense, and for the fact that this is not particularly drinkable, and improves with temperature. unfolds if you will, like origami, really works for what it is, but it is not a conventional winter warmer. about what I would expect from big sky, quintessentially Montana. big and bold, unique but conservatively decent. a good match with February, less so with November, but it was cold tonight and it did it well enough for me."

"This beer was a pleasant surprise. It got buried in the back of my fridge somehow over the winter. Unburied it last night. It seemed almost like an IPA with the floral hops and hints of orange, lemon and tangerine. There's a caramel-sweet edge to it. It goes down really easily. Ironically, fit my hot summer night really well. Maybe next time I'll get to try it on a cold winter night. Well-made brew!"
""
""
"The Verdict: I like it. Instead of the typical winter warmer, this is more like Sierra Nevada's Celebration. Not nearly as good, but similar. Good balance of hops and malt, good flavor."

"Poured this amber ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, poured a clear amber color, produced a nice off white head, decent retention and it left a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of caramel and lemongrass. Medium in body, this ale had a foundation of malted grain, sweet caramel and some citric lemon hops. Somewhat bitter- Dry finish. Overall, not very flavorful- its decent for a session beer but for a ""Winter Ale"" i was expecting a bit more umph!"
"Yet another solidly crafted and enjoyable offering from the most consistent brewery I know."

"Winter Ales for me can be very hit and miss so glad this is an American Amber without the spices so should be interesting and pours a clear amber hue with a two finger creamy head and lacing here and there,the smell is very malty with hints of caramel,toffee,dried fruit,a hint of raisins and fruity hops in the background,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and has tastes of toffee,candy,marzipan the slightest hit of piney resinous hops followed by a nice citrus bitterness and overall i like this as a winter ale and as the old saying goes less is best definately applies in this case,a very drinkable amber."
""
"Do they have skiing teams in the Big sky conference? Regardless, this stuff pours a clear amber topped by a finger-and-a-half of cream-white foam. The nose comprises very light grapefruit peel, mixed greens, light honey-dripped biscuit, and very light toffee. The taste brings in more of the same, along with more greens, a touch more sweetness for the honey and biscuit, and an added hint of grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, an alright, if thoroughly nondescript, little beer."
""
"Ahmen Ahmen I shouted hahlellujah! This beer is excellent. It even has a nice scene with a husky and some snow on the label. Belltown is were I found it, jus a single but would definetly get a sixer! floral smooth not too spicy goes down great!"
""
""
"Overall: Received a few bottles as a gift. I think they may be a little old but reviewed anyway. This beer reminded me why I usually avoid ""amber ales"" and ""winter ales"" unless they are highly recommended. An uninspiring mix of fruit and toffee flavors, at least it didn't have metallic hop flavors like my least favorite red/amber ales."
"O: Again, a very enjoyable beer, not too aggressive, but presents itself enough to make its flavors know. While perhaps not a 'traditional' winter ale, still very enjoyable."
""
""
"Eh, I wasn't really feeling this one. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good, either. A little to unbalanced with the malt in my opinion, and the sweetness just wasn't controlled or able to stand all on its own. Decent, but certainly nothing special."
""

"overall, for a 7.2% i can hang with this one. it does appear the hops in american beer is to hide the abv and make it easier to drink but this one hasa decent balance of pine-y to abv that i can handle."

"O - Powder Hound has a beautifully painted label that evokes strong outdoors-y feelings of winter in the northwoods for me but that's about where the ""Winter"" character of this beer stops. It seems to me more of a higher octane amber with a nice little hop push and solid malt body, suitable for tailgating during those cold winter games."
""
""
""
"Overall - Too bad the flavor doesn't quite match up with the rest of the qualities this beer presents, otherwise this thing could be a monster of a winter release. It's just missing one thing that would really set it off. Maybe if it popped a bit more on toasted notes? A pinch more chocolate malt, maybe? In any event, it's a pretty darn good beer."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style, it had all the things that I look for in a good Amber Ale and the balance was pretty nice. This beer had very good drinkability, it was very smooth, crisp, a little refreshing, and it had a decent amount of flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a few of these without a problem, it's a pretty easy drinking Red Ale and I like that. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability, it was very good and better then most Amber Ales and it also hid it's alcohol very nicely. What I liked the least about this beer was how sweet it smelled, it had me preparing for the worse but luckily all that sweetness didn't make it to the taste. I would buy this beer again to keep around in the fridge since I think it's a good example of the style and it's always nice to have a quality easy drinking Amber Ale on hand, I recommend this beer to just about anyone, fans of the style should really appreciate it. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought it was very solid and a good example of the style. the last couple Big Sky beers I had weren't too impressive so it's nice to get one that I enjoy. My only problem with this beer is that I think it's miss marketed, I don't really think of this as Winter Ale, it has that nice Amber Ale flavor that is perfect for the summer and fall and I think this beer would do much better if marketed as a year round Amber Ale instead of a Winter Ale, but that's just my opinion. Either was this was pretty solid and I'm happy I tried it."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
"This was a pretty good beer. But after it poured out from the bottle with a decent head, it lost all head quickly. I also had trouble placing the Amarillo hops, which I generally love. Still, there were overall good flavors involved. I liked it enough to try another bottle to see if that holds carbonation more."

"Poured out a darker amber with decent clarity, two fingers of foamy head that stayed around for a minute and a half, with medium levels of lacing left behind. Smells like an even blend of citrus peel, chocolate malt, and a garnish of vanilla on top. Tastes has a gentle toasted nut and vanilla character combined with a citrus / earthy hopping garnish. Noticeably absent is any kind of 'holiday spicing', for better or for worse. Feels thicker in flavor than the body actually is, gently carbonated and creamy in texture."
"O - tastes like an IPA, called a winter ale, categorized here a red ale, i don't know what the right answer is but I do know this is a very tasty treat that i will keep going back to while visiting Montana"
"Nice, drinkable hoppy beer. Wouldn't be complaining if there were more, but it's still decently put together."

""

""
"Overall, a pretty nice hoppy American amber ale. It's smooth, and the malt is perhaps a little less pronounced than it could be, but it's a good, if somewhat middle-of-the-road example of the style."
"O - A decent amber/ winter warmer, though the bitterness isn't particularly desirable in this case."
""
"The powder hound is a beautiful beer. Poured a clear perfect amber with slighly off white head that is at least a half finger and is lacing really well. The smell is a good heavy carmal malt with tinges of spice. The initial taste was an alcohol explosion. The second taste allowed for the malt and carmel to begin to blossum. The mouthfeel is medium body with good carbonation. Overall this is a decent beer....the alcohol content is not masked as well as I would like."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 02/15/2012. A bit of a gusher upon opening. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some decent lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, orange, pine, herbal, bread, pine, toasted malt, and light spiciness. Some nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of orange, grapefruit, pine, caramel, herbal, toasted malt, bread, and spiciness. Decent amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bread, caramel, herbal spiciness, and citrus on the finish for a bit. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish. Very drinkable and smooth for 7.2%. Overall this is a very nice and drinkable amber ale. Nice hoppy and spicy flavor, with good malt balance."
"O: A decent beer, though nothing special. I'd like a bit more hop presence in the nose and flavor."
""
"Overall a nice bold Winter Ale that had just the right amount of spices and a great hoppy finish."
""
""
""
"I got more of an American Strong ale impression from this beer rather than a amber/red due to the bitterness and alcohol twinge. I did enjoy the balance it provided and would purchase again"
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight citrus hops, hint of floral hops, and a hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, floral hops, slight citrus hops, hint of earthy malt, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, body, complexity, and blend."
""
"Overall: Nice ale overall that does not seem to fit any known style. Kind of an English Strong Ale, kind of an Amber Ale, kind of a Spiced Winter Warmer (despite the lack of spices). This seriously confuses the hell out of me, but if I put my beer reviewing hat away, it is clear that I really enjoy it."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
"O: I feel this brew is worth trying for sure. It goes down easy and has a medium hop intensity. Overall I feel it was a decent winter beer, but was lacking in certain areas to make it a great beer. I would recommend trying this beer, but I wouldn't expect it to become anyone's favorite."
""
"Overall- I got this beer as an extra, so I am thrilled about it. Its really good and I recommend trying it."
"It's a more simple than you'd think high-gravity chugger. Sometimes it's what a brewer doesn't do that factors in more than what they did, and they didn't broadcast strength in particular here. Wouldn't fight anybody over it, but it works."
""
"If Powder Hound were a snowfall, it would be about four inches. Not too deep, but enough to enjoy. A well-balanced, drinkable amber."
"Overall, this is a pretty decent beer, and a somewhat different style of winter brew, a welcome change."
""
"Overall - Like I said before, it's really just a spicy amber ale. Not bad though."
""
"Another no-nonsense winter ale. Just a decently crafted strong version of a traditional style. And I really love the folk art label, it reminds me very much of the paintings my grandmother used to make."
"O: Overall good beer with a bit of a boozey bite to help fight off winter cold blahs and bring in the holidays."
""
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed. I like that they're going for something other than a spicy winter ale, though."
"Yeah, this is pretty good beer. After one glass I'm still not sure exactly what to think. Would I want this on tap at the house? Sure, but I'm not sure I would pick up another six pack with all the other winter selections out there. Several would go down easy whilst standing around the smoker on a snowy afternoon, but I wouldn't count on it to get me through a January night in Montana."
"M - Smooth, clean, low carbonation. Medium-full body. Very drinkable. Fairly high ABV for this style but the booze barely shows. Awesome example of the style and perfect balance of malt to hops for the season."
""
"The mouthfeel is fluff! Totally like that fake snow stuff that they use in diapers."
"O: Man, I don't want it to appear that I don't like this beer because it's good. But to style as a winter amber/red? This is more of a hoppy red. Wouldn't have it be my winter seasonal if I was Big Sky. That being said (and I'm a hop-head) I do enjoy it."
"Really a better beer for fall or spring than winter. Unless you need a break from big ass beers."
"Feels medium to full in body. Good carbonation as well as wetting to the palate. For a higher ABV brew, there is little to no alcohol burn, which is always a plus in my book."
"O: Meh, okay, sessionable. Would drink if already drunk. Really unobtrusive."
"Overall, I rated this 2.63 the last time I had it, but I think it's really good this time."
""
""
""
"D - The balance is way off in this beer. The aroma doesn't match the flavor, and the entire thing is off kilter. It's not bad, but something is way off with this one."
""
""
"O: There isn't anything about this beer that is remarkable, but it is solid in almost every way. The appearance could use some work, but other than that, this is a quintessential example of an amber ale- nice hop profile, toasted malts, slight fruitiness. Look no further if you're searching for a solid amber. Well done Big Sky."
"Great beer that is worth having a few time throughout the year."
" aroma was full of hops creating a large sweet aroma. thick malted backbone that was full of deep earthen grains and roasted malts, and a nice caramel coating that seemed to tie it all together very nicely. resin pine with a sugary caramel sweetness balancing it very nicely. The backbone being the roasted malts consisting of a nice spattering of cereal grain and earthy grasses. All of this seamlessly blended together in a thick mix of almost chewy goodness."
"I wanted to like Powder Hound more than I did. I love winter warmers and Big Sky brews quality beers but this one you can pass on for all but the coldest of nights."
"A peculiar but good beer. It has a certain twang to it"
"I could swear that this an attempt at an imperial pilsener."
"I think what I enjoy most about Powder Hound is the mouthfeel and balance of flavor. Hops are most prevalent but there isn't too much bitterness. It's very nice though. Instead it has a more earthy-spicy flavor that's not overwhelming. Mango citrus tang follows the hops with malty sweetness and a light roastiness. When drinking this I think of sitting by a fire after being outside in the cold and snow. In this case I guess the Powder Hound has done its job of being a winter ale since it makes me imagine drinking it in the winter. :P Hop bitterness and citrus do linger at the very end in the mouth. There's nothing like good flavors lingering to help you have a more lasting enjoyment of the beer. Although I don't think this beer is extraordinary, it is definitely very good. It's a great example of a quintessential winter ale. If you're snowed in then get this one!"
"Appears amber in the glass with a thin white head- disappears quickly and leaves little lace. I can smell the maltiness immediately. A bit of herbal hops and some spicy notes detected as well. It tastes as it smells. This brew is crisp but gets syrupy as it warms. Dry finish and is medium bodied while cold but thickens warm. Low carbonation. This ale is perhaps a little above average but not great."
"D - A very tasty amber ale. I really enjoyed many of the amber ales I indulged while visiting Montana, as many struck a nice hop/malt balance. Easily sessionable."
"Thanks, sholle, for the opportunity"
"Overall, I'd been avoiding this one as I thought it was a winter warmer style but it's not. Glad I finally tried it as it greatly surprised me with it's rich aroma and flavor. Highly recommend. Avail here in TX. Rotation - it's an Oct-Jan seasonal. Worth a 6 pack spread out over that time for sure. [R; Y]"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and could easily drink several before the 7.2% ABV caught up with me. Gracias to my nephew Chad who introduced me to this beer."
"Beautiful looking, deep ruby-brown with light tan head. Spicy aroma, with a nuttiness and notes of clove. Taste didn't live up to the nose, but did have a nice hoppy finish (guessing noble hops). Thick, rich mouthfeel and a good brew overall. Certainly on spot for the style."
"I enjoyed this as just a good tasting beer, but not sure it qualifies as a winter warmer. Lots of flavor, but on the light side rather than full bodied, and while it is spicy, I don't usually associate pepper as a winter spice. Whatever it is, it tastes good and is easy to drink."
"Big Sky's version of a winter ale enters the glass, revealing an amber colored liquid with a dishwater head. The color is lighter than I expect for a winter ale--portentous it seems. The aroma is a nice mixture of caramel malt, biscuit, and citrus and pine from the hops. As I take the first imbibition hops race across the palate making this beer feel more akin to a pale ale than a winter ale. The pine and citrus from the hops is not able to overpower the caramel and nuttiness from the malt. The interplay between the hops and malt is just right. This well balanced brew is a winter delight. Drinkable indeed."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Pretty light on body with quite a bit of carbonation. Not overly impressive. Overall, this is a beer that seems fairly unique to me for the style and is very easy to drink."
"D - A solid offering from Big Sky. I could drink more than one in a sitting. Definitely worth a try."
"D: I like it but I can't get over the idea of a ""winter ale"". It's good, but not winter."
"This is a very enjoyable winter warmer, I could drink these fairly often if they didn't sell out so quickly. I think I'll make it a habit of drinking Powder Hound every winter."
"D- It came across as an amber that's had everything ratcheted up a notch. Very flavorful. As a winter seasonal, it's a nice seitch from some of the overly-spiced, alcohol bombs out there. At first I thought this would be some kind of a ""sessionable"" seasonal. However, it ended up a little too bold for a bunch in any one sitting. Not really a sipper, but definitely not a chugger."
"Overall, this is a decent little beer, worth a shot if you see it."
"When I opened the beer I was expecting a winter warmer. It was a surprise to see a lighter colored amber ale, but the beer was still enjoyable."
"Don't let the color fool you, this one has plenty of gusto. The body is pretty thick with a nice stickiness. Carbonation is crisp from start to finish, and the lingering dry bitterness keeps me sipping. The 7% ABV is evident, but totally acceptable. It adds the extra warmth that elevates this beer to the next level. The style it falls into could be highly controversial, but forget where it fits, and enjoy."
"Over all it is a good buy I would not want to drink these in quantity or really with a nice dinner but with a nice big steak or a piece of blackened salmon, something with a-lot of flavor to stand up to it would be a well suited pairing."
"D: Solid winter beer, definitely more in the Celebration realm for winter beers. Tasty, but nothing more."
"Overall: I would buy this beer again. Balanced, hoppy, spicy and a great after taste."
"Drinkability: Tasty stuff. Another decent holiday warmer. Too bad it can't cure my cold."
"Drinkability - might be a little too bitter for me to enjoy on many occasions, but I'd keep coming back just for the complexity of it. Nice brew."
"D- A simple beer that drinks alright, but is quickly forgotten."
"A little different than what I expected from a winter ale. It seems to fit the profile of a pale ale or maybe even an IPA with the hop domination. Even still, it's a satisfying and tasty treat."
"2010 Version 2 12 oz. Bottle. 7.20% ABV. 40 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Winter Ale? Off white lacy dense half inch head. Rich clear bright gold color. Delicate malt spice aromatic winter hop spice front. Crisp tangy rich cloying caramel mild sweet spicy rich pine hint mildly fruity rich malty hoppy body. Clean spicy earthy mildly bitter mild citrus clean bright odd British hop spice end. Sampled on 11/14/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $7.99 @ PCC--Fremont, Seattle on 11/6/2010."
"Notes: an American amber made with British hops? not sure what technical category to put it in but it is a great hoppy amber (ESB maybe?)"
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. A good winter warmer."
"The ale pours a light reddish color with a small head. The smell is kind of nutty/Smokey, it also smells a bit like orange peels; there is also a slight herbal fragrance to the ale. It tastes of rich roasted malts: the ones that add a slightly bitter Smokey quality to beer. The beer has a noticeable amount of hops; the hops mostly add to the bitterness but there is a slight citrus flavor to them as well. The malts and hops blend nicely with no element really overpowering the other; the carbonation which was low helped the flavors blend together. It is an excellent wintertime beer."
"The color when poured in a glass was of a medium dark amber. Nice medium very light tan foam with a nice amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of light hops witha hint of roasted malts filled the nose with a nice pleasant aroma. The taste of light hops, roasted malts and a hint of citrus was nicely balanced. This is a pleasant winter warmer that's not overpowering on a hoppy flavor. Not overly bitter, just a please feel in the mouth."
"Pours a clear copper color with a one finger head that recedes to an ok film of foam. Nice toasted bread and grain aroma with some light grass hops in the nose. The starts with an oily malt of bread and some cooking oil. The middle mellows the oilyness on the palate. As the beer warms, the palate becomes more grainy and malty. Pretty nice session amber ale."
"D: The lightness of flavor and body make this a decent session beer."
"Either the recipe was changed or the beer is different than I remember or I got a bad bottle. This one is a medium copper with some floaty sediment. The aroma is hoppy with some citrus. The taste is peculiar, it's hoppy but settles to a somewhat earthy feel with a peculiar tartness that wouldn't fade. The body seems too light for the style. The aftertaste has that tartness and seems a tad sour. I'm not impressed with this release."
"A very solid ""winter warmer"" if this were that style."
"This is a nice sessionable Winter Ale. Not quite what I consider a Winter Warmer nor a Strong Ale, but very mild and enjoyable. Malt flavor is balanced with a nice hop presence, but not anything like the hoppy brews I lean towards. I've had this 3 times this week as it's a nice every day brew to have with food. It compliments bbq and give you a warm feeling without the big alcohol kick."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking beer, but nothing exceptional. I find so many amber ales to be kind of ""meh"" and this one follows suit."
"Drinkability: While it's definitely not the most engaging or alluring of wintertime offerings, it is fairly acceptable for a relatively light seasonal offering."
"A really good beer. Big Sky continues to impress me. Highly recommended."
"Easy to drink. Could drink several in a session if the opportunity presented itself."
"All in all, this is an easy drinking and sessionable beer. My only question, why is this their winter ale?"
"Taste is pretty good with a wide variety of maltiness on the palate...grainy, toasty, nutty and even a bit of cocoa. Decent hop bitterness lingers a bit on the back of the tongue. A bit light bodied and flavored for the 'Winter Ale' designation on the label, especially from a snowy, cold northern state. It is a pretty easy drinker and tastes great for an amber ale, which is what I am rating it as. I would drink it again and me thinks it would be even better fresh off the tap."
"Overall Impression: The bitterness is too prominent for the malt back bone; it is a little out of balance. The malts never show up."
"Not a spiced winter brew, but a nice malty (but with a hop balance and a hint of warmth) brew. Could see how it fits with ""winter", though did well on a cold, rainy spring day. Easy to drink despite hint of warmth. An enjoyable brew!"
"D- Okay beer; I would drink it if offered, but probably won't buy one."
"Powder Hound is a dog. Too bad, I love Big Sky's IPA. Moose Drool and Scape Goat ain't bad, either - but this dog don't hunt. Maybe I don't know what a American Amber is supposed to be - but I don't think this is it. There is nothing that stands out about this beer - everythings OK but nothing is great! There's too many better beers to try."
"I've yet to do a side-by-side tasting with Moose Drool, but really, with the days getting noticeably longer, our attention turns to beers of a hoppier nature ... maybe next year."
"This is a nice beer, but honestly, it tastes like the wasabi I mix with soy sauce when eating sushi. Oddly enough, I love the taste when eating sushi... sometimes I drink it straight. But it's weird in a beer!! It's mostly in the finish and smell. Overall, Powder Hound still resembles a winter ale, with a deep nutty maltiness and a bit of hoppiness (less than most winter ales)... but I never want to buy a 6-pack of it again. Not that it's bad, it's just a spooky reminder of eating sushi."
"D - Pretty damn good stuff. It won't wow you or knock your socks off, but it is a really solidly built brew."
"Enjoyable in its drinkability, but probably not for a repeat run."
"D: A great beer to have in winter months. Probably could have a couple but the sweetness may get to be too much after this."
"D: As a Winter Ale, Powder Hound needs to be taught a few new tricks. Just not inspiring enough to warrant session drinking."
"Aroma is of herbal hops and toasted malt. Taste is hoppy - herbal and piney with a good amount of bitterness. Caramel sweetness and toasted sourdough bread. Not too light, but could be a bit heavier and creamier for a winter warmer. Decent mouthfeel with ample carbonation and peppery finish."
"Notes from and tasted on 02/01/08."
"Big Sky always has had good beers and this ""winter"" seasonal proves it."
"D - This is a nicely balanced amber ale with good doses of sweet malt and spicy hops."
"Pours a dark amber, almost brown with a creamy one finger brown head. It has a slight clarity, darker than some other ales. Aroma is simple, malty sweetness and fruity. Very smooth taste, a lot of malt but well balanced sweetness. Hints of chocolate and coffee with a slight hoppy bitterness. Good body but not heavy with a slight chewy texture. A very enjoyable ale, highly recommended as a session beer and one to try."
"D: One of the weaker winter seasonals I've had. A decent beer nonetheless that holds it's own away from other winter offerings."
"Clear brown pour with no head. Caramel-sweet aroma makes you think this is going to be sticky sweet. The malt and hop profiles, however balance this one out into a very smooth, slightly spicy beer. Only problem was that I expected more from a winter beer, either in the alcohol content or overall flavor. Kind of weak in both areas, but still an enjoyable brew."
"D-OK drinkability. I wasn't terribly impressed by this beer. Still, it's an enjoyable brown/amber ale that's easy and enjoyable to drink."
"Poured into Samuel Smith pint glass. Pours a medium dark amber-orange color, with about 1"" of tan slightly rocky head. Head dissipates pretty quickly leaving a thin layer of foam and no real lacing to speak of. Aroma is light and sweet, mostly caramel and malt. Tastes a little sweet up front, caramel, touch of hops balanced nicely. Finishes dry with a little earthy hoppiness that tends to stick around. Mouthfeel is pretty light, creamy, low carbonation. Light mouthfeel makes it easy to drink, the finish gives you a little more to think about after each drink. Nice winter seasonal."
"Light, simple and refreshing... NOT a winter warmer & too much caramel to mow the lawn with. But I still liked it. The best I've had from Big Sky."
"Drinkability: It is probably one of their better beers."
"Deep amber in color with flares of red and brown in the light. Heavy and thick mocha colored foam head after pouring into a pint glass. Still. Mild malty nose. . . so mild that its barely detectable. Smooth clean attack that almost creates a sweet sensation. Finishes with some hops that continue to grow bitter all the way through the aftertaste. Mild nut flavor seems to be present. I would rate it a B- myself."
"This pours a dark amber color with ok head and minimal lacing. Smells super sweet and malty. Taste is very much the same. Dark fruits when it's cold, but warms to a caramel, chocolate, raisin, prune flavor. Good carbonation, but it's can't overcome the thickness and syrupyness of this brew. Not the best winter offering I've had."
"Drinkability: meh... I guess I'd drink it, but there's so many other better winter beers out there. Then again, I guess this is an amber. For an amber, it's alright."
"Roasted malt flavor jumps out of right up front with a touch of candied fruit in the end. The mouthfeel ends a little wattery but nice overall."
"The heaviness of the drink allows this to be enjoyed at a slower pace, but the flavors of the drink push for faster drinking. Nice dilemma, huh? I enjoyed this. This brewery makes really accessible beers. Overall, while not blown away, it's good, reliable beer that I'll never turn down."
"This beer has a moderate brown color with a slight purple tint when held to the light. Semi transparent with a nice thick tan head that is creamy and laces well. This beer has a slight oaky smell with definite malts and an earthiness. The taste is of rich roasted nuts and has a warmth to it. It has a deeper taste that the color would lead one to believe would be evident. The finish is not as smooth as I like, but the flavor makes up for that. This is a decent brew, glad to have tried it."
"D: Not a bad brew, but for Big Sky, it falls a bit short. I'm not entirely sure what's missing, but I'm sure a healthy dose of additional hops wouldn't hurt. (has it ever?)"
"This beer pours clear amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, and grapefruit. The taste is of sweet with only a hint of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, but is somewhat sticky. Overall, this is a nice beer, and I could drink it again."
"Drinkability: Got two bottles as part of a mixed pack. Very enjoyable, although at just over 6% I don't know if I would be able to session with this. Still it is a good beer to sit back and enjoy one (or two) on a cold winter night."
"Drinkability: Well, I have a 6 pack... but this is most probably going to be offered to guests... and not my guests but my roommates guests. Not very good, but not the worst."
"D- nice season, though neither fascinating or repulsive"
"Smell is mild malty. Taste is clean. Very subtle, I taste some dark fruitiness - cherry on the back? Brew is has some sweetness with a nice pleasant finish. I actually expected more from this one, but it really didn't deliver much past average. It is a decent beer, maybe its just not cold enough here in Arizona to get the full effect. But all being said, it is a decent beer."
"I have to admit amber/red ales aren't my forte. In fact, I usually avoid them like the plague! Big Sky's Powder Hound Winter Ale is pleasant to drink and contains a breadth of interesting flavors, even if it doesn't meet my silly expectations."
"overall, this isnt that bad of a brew but it could use more hops"
"This is a good beer and tonite the high is 25° and the low was around 4°, so the odds of this gal having a good show were pretty much spot on. Never once did she disappoint..."
"Came with a bit of head and lacing from the firkin, but I couldn't pull must aroma or flavor out of it, even as it warmed. Maybe some beers just aren't made to go on cask. I just got a little cocoa malt with decent hops bitterness. Felt nice and easy to drink, but I wasn't particularly inspired to drink more."
"Pours redish brown with good carbonation bubbling up into a nice two-finger thick tan head. Head sticks around a while with a good consistent lacing left behind all around the glass. Smells of malts, tea leaves, and a faint hint of spice. Taste isn't as complex and spicy as other winter warmers, but is very drinkable with some sugary sweetness, spicy apple, roasted malts and hoppiness involved. Very drinkable winter warmer from a consistent brewer, but with so much good competition out there in this style it's hard to overlook some of the others."
"A clear mahogany color with a big fluffy light tan head with good lace. The aroma is a light nutty sweetness with some malt, but very mild. It has a mellow woody-nut flavor, some vanilla with a full body feel but sort of flat at the same time. I detect a little smokiness and there is a slight hop bitterness at the back of this. Drinkable enough and definitely worth a try."
"Notice of a slight crisp aftertaste, malt lingers a bit."
"Powder Hound is one of those Holiday brews I pick up every year (I have a soft spot in my heart for Montana breweries). I like all Big Sky brews, especially the special releases available at the brewery, but Powder Hound I've always though needs work .... just a little work and quite a bit more hops. I would get bored fast drinking more than 1-2 of these in a session."
"I would probably recommend trying this beer but I do not need to ever again, nobody should be in a big hurry to do so, it is average at best but if you are curious like I was about another Big Sky seasonal, then you should grab some when you see it"
" Forgettable but not regrettable."
"I like this beer but it's still average compared to other holiday beers. Good beer to drink if David Byrne is attacking you."
"Drinkability: Decent brew. Accessible flavor and alcohol content. Decent example of the style, but not a standout."
"Finish has a metallic grassy characteristic."
"Drinks pretty easy, this isn't as good as it was, but I could still easily session on this. This works better as winter warmer than an amber, but I'm not sure I'd agree with the original call"
"The taste has a good caramel malt flavour up front followed by a bit of spice and some citrus hops and an earthy backbone that kind of throws the flavours out of whack. A few more sips in and that earthy flavour now dominates the flavour; too bad because I think this had potential to be a good winter ale and pretty darned drinkable but as is, I won't look for it again. Pretty messy, imho."
"D - Not a bad beer at all. Taste is simple but good."
" Adam"
"Beer poured an amber brown color with a nice off white head that is leaving a lacing behind. Nose was noticeably of floral hops at first and has faded into a maltyness as the beer warms. Taste is malty with a strong acidic oilyl finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth across the palate. Drinkability is OK. The residuall acidic oilyness is a bit too heavy on the palate. This is a nice beer to try with desirable attributes."
"just about right for a winter warmer. Well worth a try."
"From a 12 oz bottle, this poured a dark amber color with a nice slightly off-white head that left good lacing. Nose of malts and some hops. Mouthfeel was average and flavors strong on caramel and overall a little on the sweet side. This brew as drinkable but not exceptional."
"D: An enjoyable ale, this makes for a decent sipping ale."
"Into a pint glass, poured a solid orange amber with good head, a solid thicket of head for the whole time, ok lacing. The aroma is full of roasty malts, some not so active hops, citric like, maybe some chocolate. The taste is also pretty decent, kinda roasty malts, kinda caramel sweet, some chocolate, a little hop citrus and bittering. The mouth has decent body, carbonation, really a good beer but nothing too special. Just glad it wasn't called a winter warmer, cause it didn't. That said, a decent beer."
"Cheers!"
"Deep reddish amber body topped by a thin, ecru head. The head gradually fades to just a loose grouping of larger bubbles ringed in tight foam. The aroma is almost all caramel malt notes, but there's just a hint of woody herbalness. Light caramel flavors are supported by a slight alcohol note, then wrapped up with some bitterness. Slight, very slight medicinal/metallic note on the finish that's just a bit astringent. Mouthfeel is solid, but a bit over-carbonated. Drinakbilty is ok. A solid beer, but not exceptional."
"Poured cool (not from-the-fridge cold). Medium-firm pour into a Westmalle chalice produces a full one-fingered, pale tan head of medium duration and moderate lacing. Nose is fairly rich with esters of dark fruit, caramel, cocoa, and rather minimal hop. Smells creamy. Brilliant amber in color, fairly dark, and with a touch of crimson. Fruity and mildly-sweet on the first sip, with more dry biscuity malt notes than rich, roasty malt. VERY creamy. Lingering bitterness, with plenty of fresh piney, resiny hop aromatics, and a drying quality as well. Malt is fairly juicy on the second sip, and the alcohol is warming and nearer the front of the palate . . . tingly. Stronger than I recall it as being (and it drinks a bit stronger than 6.2%), but my overall impression is that this brew has changed a good deal since I first tried it five years ago . . . I really like the way they've balanced the juicy, aromatic, and bittering hops with the pale and roasty malt. Mildly roasty, cocoa notes tend to linger along with the both the hop bitterness and resiny quality, all to a rather pleasing affect. Light notes of cherry and caramel, cocoa and vanilla. Mouthfeel is light and creamy tingly as opposed to scrubbing/cleansing, and it is very *readily* drinkable, almost too much so. Carbonation is lower than I recall, with the brew being softer and more refined than I recall, definitely an improvement. Seeing as I haven't tried this in a good while and as it was on sale -$4 / six pack!- this made for a great buy for a cold day in February. Seeing as how their flagship brand (Moose Drool) has really come into its own in recenet years, it's no surprise that this brew would do likewise. Big Skys Powder Hound is worth enjoying again and again!"
"I was a little disappointed in that I assumed that as a winter beer it would have been more along the lines a traditional winter ale-but all in all next year I will pck up a few sixers"
"Pours a nice clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, nice sticky lacing afterwards, and hangs around for awhile. Nice scent of sweet malts, slight hops, and caramel. The taste is malty with a nice bitter bite in the finish. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew from Big Sky, could drink a few of these."
"Overall, it is somewhat complex and interesting, though I have to say it bombs when looked at as an American Amber Ale. There is an utter and complete lack of hop aroma and flavor, which definitely takes it down a notch... I gotta say, Big Sky: I'm a little disappointed..."
"D - I wouldn't really rush out to find this again, but I'm glad I got to try it. It's not bad - just pretty average. Thanks JohnGalt1!"
"All-in-all, I would recommend this beer."
"A very drinkable brew, definately sessionable. Would be a great brew to drink with friends or family that would normally stick to BMC or Molbatts, as long as they have to courage to try something new. May look for this one again if such a situation arises."
"Probably not what most BAs are looking for in a hearty winter ale, but it's an easy drinker that could make for an unobjectionable transition beer for your friends, as well as an easy pairing with your typical pub fare."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. It is very drinkable, and session worthy. Certainly worth a try."
"Malts and spices come through strong in the smell. The taste starts with malts and finishes with a combination of spice and cherry that come together well. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is good."
"This is a drinkable beer, but not the best red ale I've had. Still it's one of the better beers I have had from Big Sky. I would have Powder Hound again, especially if it's on sale."
"Mouthfeel is thin, not ideal. Drinkability is good, its an ok, non-objectionable beer that you could have a few of."
"Drinkability is very good. I would recommend it."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"The body has a mid to light feel that has a not quite dry finish to it. There is also a light chalky finish which is a deterrent. Carbonation is good though. Overall its a good beer with room to improve."
"Kind of a strange offering. It seems very light and so not a hefty winter warmer. It's so fruity that it seems more like a warm weather thirst quencher than a winter beer. That said, it does go down easily but it's really not what I'm looking for in a winter beer."
"D: Eh. I like where they are going but the execution isn't stellar. Not huge into the ""earthy"" flavors as well."
"The White Elephant BIF strikes again."
"Originally reviewed February 22, 2005. On tap at Old Chicago, Duluth. Slightly murky hazel brown pour with copious off-white head, complemented by thick sheets of lacing. No aroma. Extreme caramel and toasted nut flavors. The malt in this beer is fantastic. Smooth on the palate, with a smack of sweet cinnamon and apple. Extremely drinkable and rich."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a solid tea color with a small and sparse head that is patchy over top. Very good clarity on this one and a light carbonation can be seen in the liquid. This one really looks like iced tea. Smell is caramel, light buttery diacetyl, with a touch of darker aromas from a tough of roast and melanoidan toastyness, with even a touch of nuttyness in there. I'd like a little less nuttyness and a light graineyness to put a touch of an edge on it. This one is a touch closer to a nut brown in the aroma. Flavor is a bit more interesting than the nose. Caramel, light butter, moving towards a melanoidan toastyness and nuttyness, finishing with a very mild bitter. Its okay, but I don't like the nuttyness in here. It doesn't work well with the other flavors in my opinion. Feel is on the light end of moderate, with a carbonation that is moderately strong. It works very well with the flavor of the beer. Overall, this one is okay. I don't like the nutty character in it, as it seems to be fighting with the sweeter notes, not compliment them. I'd like to see this one go a little darker and hit the nutbrown category."
"It poured with a nice pillowy and largely beaded head. The dark amber color it displays is muddied by further ruby and brown colors. It looks good. The nose is malty fresh and bread-like. The body is straight medium but there is a clear rough edge to the mouthfeel that robs a bit from the drinkability. The over-riding chestnut flavor drives the beer, but the background consists of a cinnamon spice essence that I would expect from a winter offering. The finish i smore malty with the clove/cinnamon presence more pronounced. Ultimately, it leaves you leafy dry. Its ok, but proves somewhat pedestrian by the time you're done."
"Taste carries a raw malt presence, backed by a light fruitiness. The taste eventually rounds itself out into a fairly interesting ending to the brew but for the most part its rather forgettable to me. I liked the raw mash type aroma, and it was easily put down without a second thought, hence the problem."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a dark, amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is a strange sour smell with some caramel and spice. Buttery toffee flavor with pineapple and some nuttiness. A soapy flavor nearly ruins this beer, although some pleasant maltiness still comes through. Finishes sweet with very little hop flavor. This beer is not malty enough, and there are too many off-flavors. Not a complete waste, but I wouldn't recommned it either."
"Overall: I was disappoint by a thin body, an overly sweet smell and a one dimensional roasted taste."
"A very drinkable Scottish ale here. According to the website they call this ""a Northern Rockies Strong Ale"" but taste wise this is a malty and smoky Scottish ale in my book. A surprisingly drinkable beer that I really didn't expect to be as good as it was."
"Ok, taste is malty, and sweetened possibly by honey. Finish is dry. Not a bad sipper, but nothing really ""wow's"" me here. Pretty average."
" drinkability: great, walking the line between a sipper and a session. I would go so far as to call this a great session ale, but it is 6.2 percent after all. Great beer. I haven't been let down by this brewery yet, and they seem to get low marks. Give this one a shot. It's probably the most drinkable winter warmer i've had. (much more drinkable that jubelale, winter solitice, anchor's)"
"Not my kind of session beer due to bitterness & interesting but strong seaweed/straw taste."
"Overall impression: A nice winter beer - very drinkable with a good balance of flavors."
"Drinkability  This is a drinkable beer, if not an overly interesting one."
"Pours a light amber color into pint glass. Nice brownish/white head, light carbonation, slight lacing down the pint glass. Smells very nutty with some roasted grains as well. There is also a scent that I can't quite put my finger on, possibly like a cream/buttery smell. Taste is sweet at first with a nice bitter hoppy aftertaste. The aftertaste was very much unexpected, I didn't really smell any hop scents at all. This beer goes down very easliy, has a great mouthfeel to it. A very solid winter beer by Big Sky."
"Overall, it's nice and is drinkable, but not too exciting. It seemed like more of a fruit beer than a pale ale."
"Powder Hound, described on bigskybrew.com as a ""Northern Rockies Strong Ale," is a clear reddish-brown color with a small, off-white head that quickly dissipates. Smell has a nutty, slightly buttery character and a caramel sweetness with a tinge of apple; it's a great scent but a little different, and I'm struggling to describe it. Almost smells like ice cream. Tastes pretty good, but not as interesting as the smell. There's a slightly hoppy finish, but Powder Hound tastes for the most part like a generic, malty amber ale. Does have a nicely creamy mouthfeel. Pretty easy drinking for Northern Rockies Strong Ale, I must say."
"A very nice beer for style. Has the look of winter ale--lood of sticy without thickness. Nicely browned with ruby highlights. A dirty off white head that persists shows body. Smells toasty and maty. Toffee and chocolate malt round out the nose. Tastes malty, toasty, slightly roasty, slightly chocolately, quite nutty, vanella-ey, and a little caramel-ey. Light buttery and candied. Big body per style that dominates with creamyness and carbonation. Finishes cloying and tacky with light tones of bittering that shows grainyness."
"I've been pleased by Big Sky in the past. Powder Hound isn't bad, but a few tweaks are needed to bring it up to the level of its stablemates. I feel like a broken record sometimes, but more hops would improve this beer immensely... more hops would improve this beer immensely... more hops would improve this beer immensely..."
"This brew is a brown to dark-brown color, medium tan head with some cascading action. Fair amount of lace. Some caramel malt action on the nose, touch of hops. Sweet malt front, caramel, punctuated in the jaw by some bittering hops. Fairly thin mouth, I can see where they were thinking about going with this beer, but they need some more of everything. Not bad but could surely be better."
"A clear, ruby-orange copper body and yellowish tan head welcomes you to Big Sky's Powderhound. Its head retention is good, and it leaves rings of craggy and spotty lace about the glass. The nose is fruity with citrusy hops (and yeasty fruitiness?), and malty with a hint of chocolate-drizzled caramel. In the mouth it's delicately zesty with a median carbonation and medium-light body; becoming somewhat creamy as it warms in the mouth. The flavor is fuller than the nose suggests, and it's loaded with rich, chocolate-accented deep-caramel and toffee malt washed by citrusy hops and backed by a rock-solid bitterness and cusp of roastiness. It finishes dry with some lingering tangerine-like fruitiness and mild pine from the hops; some mildly sticky toffee and caramelish malt; and a restrained but lingering bitterness."
"Chestnut amber with a light tan head. Smells of butterscotch cookie dough with a dash of vanilla and Christmas wreath. Shortbread cookie flavors up front, along with butterscotch, and sweet vanilla. Hops enter, resinous, but mostly astringent and raw. Bittersweet finish. Medium-bodied, with a soapy feel. Not as good as I had hoped."
"This beer pours a reddish brown color with a nice head that lasts throughout the drink. Aroma is nice, sweet toffee and hops. The taste is sweet toffee balanced with hops, kind of an english hoppy flavor. This beer has a very thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is fine, I wouldn't have too many because they are a bit sweet. Seems like it is alot stronger of a beer than it actually is."
"The beer pours a beautiful ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, victory, and bisquit malts. It is quite toastey and breadlike. The taste is excellent. It has a sweet, yet dry and toastey flavor with a bitter breadlike finish. There are hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer. It has awesome aroma and taste; a great seasonal brew and a great drinker."
"Pours a light brown with a little orange tint to it with a thin wispy head,aromas of chocolate and roasted nuts most prevalent with some orange and citrius in there as well.A malt tilted flavor a little sweet and nutty a little chocolate in thee with some pine and citruis in the finish wich becomes more pronounced as it warms a little.A decent brew big in the malt department tastes alot better as it warms."
"Other comments: Reminds me of a barley wine without the high abv, if that makes sense. Same sort of maltiness : hoppiness balance and similar esters. Like a scaled-down version of Old Saguaro Barley Wine."
"Update  The 2005 was a lot maltier than years before. They really are working on this recipe. The flavor is grainy but beefy malts. Straight 3.5s seems to be this beers home so Ill leave it as such. Its a nice ale though and I would definitely recommend."
"A rich copper-red with a thin tan head, smelled like malted milk balls. Tastes like cinnamon and brown sugar, heavy on the malty sweetness, maybe a bit of nutmeg in there as well, they didn't overdo it one the spices, which is nice. Not much hops, but what there is adds a pleasant citrus bitterness. Quite smooth and drinkable, went especially good with Yam Yam's BBQ (Portland, OR.) I wouldn't really call it a Winter ""Warmer"" though."
"It's less than medium bodied, and less than worthwhile as a winter seasonal...or any seasonal."
"Drinkability- Extreme drinkability. Had this for the first time a couple of years ago and it was the beer I most crave from Montana. Awesome beer!"
"A nice dark red ale with a fat off white head. The aroma of citrusy hops and crystal malts. The flavor is a bit maltier than the aroma and the hops come on strong towards the end. I was going to rank this beer a bit lower, but as I sit and sip this brew it is making it's personality known and I am growing fond of it. It is not as strong as most winter brews, but it is definitely drinkable."
"It's a great winter ale. Would be refreshing, especially with a hearty winter meal."
"-Nice sweet aroma...Nice malty sweet ale...hops balance perfectly and make this an easy drinking tasty winter ale..solid malt base...a good solid tasty easy drinking ale."
"Ruddy bister hue, topped by a beige head that recedes into a lean, but steadfast layer. Frothy, loose lace remains. The aroma is a combination of mellow cocoa and tepid, slightly tart lemon like citrus. Floral hints arise as it breathes, but as a whole the aroma is understated and functional at best. The flavor is a facsimile of the nose. Mild cocoa and citrus are prevalent, although an undertone of caramel sweetened, dark biscuit adds depth. Hop bitterness is paltry and leaves ample, but inobtrusive residual sweetness. Virtually bereft of esters, save a trace figgish complement. Lightly bodied and conducive to easy quaffing. Needs more dextrins to bolster the malt backbone. Finishes squeaky clean, with only a ghostly hint of roasted barley. An innocuous, well crafted, albeit unimaginative brew. Excellent drinkability, limited savorability."
"Not a bad beer, by any means, but I had hopes that this dog had a little more bite. Thanks to Bighuge for the sample."
"Powder Hound was served from a 12 oz bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a very attractive deep ruby-orange, and was topped by an off-white head that left very nice and ornate lacing. The underpowering nose was sweet with a delicate strawberry maltiness and a subtle citric hoppiness. The taste was also rather bland for a winter beer. The malt character was quite mild and not as sweet as the nose suggested, with no roastiness to be found. Instead, a Belgian strong ale-like focused strawberry essence presided, and held up throughout the mild bitter finish. I am reminded somewhat of a wimpy version of the Victory Grand Cru. My conclusion is that this beer is an experimental variant of the Belgian pale strong style (though there was no spice), perhaps an attempt to blend this style with another, altough with what I don't know...maybe with an amber/red ale as the style designation suggests, or an English pale ale. The result is not very inspiring, but isn't bad, just bland. The body of the beer is decent, though carbonation seemed fizzle out to quickly. An interesting beer, but fails to make a splash."
"This is moderately drinkable, but I find nothing essential about it, especially when viewing it as a winter brew. I doubt this will replace Anchor's OSA or Celebration in many people's heart's anytime soon."
"A sweet malty beer good for keeping out the winter chill. Darkish red-amber with small dwindling head and some lace. Malts are very nice, warming, leathery and a touch smoky. Lots of biscuit sweetness and a sweet currant fruitiness that slowly becomes apparant. Lots of Irish red ale malt character too. Hops are not very substantial but they do the job with a definite herbal character. A long, lingering sweetness entices you to take another sip. I was surprised how good this beer was. It at first seemed like an average malty winter brew but as it asserted itself I was more and more impressed with its complexity. This beer would go well with foods, maybe smoky meats, but I also wonder how it would do alongside a sweet caramelized dessert. It tastes a little like the burnt top of a creme brulee."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color, with a fluffy white head. More of a floral smell than anything else I am getting.Tastes of caramel sweetness and a little hops finish. Also has that little floral hint in the flavor. Pretty tasty, maybe not enough intriguing factors to be considered 'great'."
"The bottle did not give any guidance as to the style, and all the way through the beer, I kept wondering ""what are they trying to accomplish here?"" Not a bad beer, but it seemed to lack direction. Lightly sweet overall, with some bitterness at the front which quickly mellowed. I couldn't decide if this winter seasonal was an amber ale, or a very, very mellow old ale style. Nice, but not much ""oomph"" for a winter seasonal."
"Super nice color which seems dark chestnut brown, ahh but hold it to the light and it becomes a lovely glowing amber agate with a deep reddish tone, gorgeous color. Head is tannish and thin, leaves very minimal lace. Aroma is all malts, sweet, dulled citrusy-like, fresh, touching on some caramel and nutty bagel dough. Taste has a smooth and easy malt profile, very drinkable, lightly sweet, some caramel, lightly chewy, bready light, some notions of dulled citrus melon, nutty dryness and dried hops come in late with some light dryness and calm bitterness. Solid medium body feel with a smooth, lightly creamy start and center, a bit chewy, finish goes to lighter drying of hops and nuts with a touch of bittering bite. A nice drinker this one! Quite subtle with a good amount of easy hefty malts. Its like taking Capital's Autumnal Fire and blending it with their Amber."
"Medium brown color, medium head. A medium bodied brown/amber ale, spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon. Slightly sweet malts, slight orange taste. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice warming beer."
"I was surprised how much I liked this ale even in the early summer..pretty drinkable in my books."
"Cheers to budgood for the sample!"
"This is another great brew from Big Sky. The Powder Hound had a really inviting look with a dark, almost garnet like, color and a two finger head that had nice retention and lace. The taste is nicely balanced with a slight empahsis on the malt giving it a toasty flavor. Mouthfeel is full but not overpowering. A very drinkable brew."
"Pours a deep dark auburn with a thin head. The heavy aroma of toffee and sweet malt reminds me of some of my favortie British ales. A distinct bitterness is the first thing to hit the palate followed quickly by heavy deep chocolate and toffee flavor. Fairly smooth body supports the well-rounded taste. Very much like Sam Smith's Winter brew with a bit more solid bitter. Very taste and worth the shipping."
"Amber in color with an off-white head. Aromas are caramel malts, bready, spicy and a bit fruity. The flavor is spicy, bready and malty. Light-medium in body, with a spicy, medium bitterness in the dry finish. The alcoholic warmth is also present in the finish. Overall, a decent winter brew."
"Pours a clear dark amber/copper with a small off-white head. The aroma reveals a light malt and wet dog aroma (?). Must be the hound ;-). The taste is a toasty bread taste with mild hops and finishes with an alcohol tastefortunately no hound this time. This is a light bodied brew that is decent at best. It is not highly complex and not extremely appealing. Thanks nonetheless to budgood1 for sending me this brew! Cheers!"
"Light mahagony in color with a tan head. Malt aroma. Roasted malt flavor up front that is well balanced by hops. Finishes pretty well and has good drinkability. Overall a solid beer with a flavor I enjoyed."
"Besides the quirkiness of this beer, (and the odd flavors that come along with it), I'd say it is actually very drinkable. And although a bit strange, it's a good strange."
"Later notes: the malt profile of this beer seems to get stronger every year"
"Ruby color, smallish head. Aroma: plum, cherries, some dark fruits. Medium body, lingering pleasant finish, slightly sweet, and very mellow. Normally, I like my winter ales to be on the spicier side, richer and toasted, and stronger. We'll have to wait 'til Anchor Our Special comes in...not a bad beer here, though."
"The pour a deep brown color, the head light chocolate, the lace in average sheets.. Nose is malt, slightly sweet, the start is sweet, the top flimsy. The beer finished with a potent hop spicy bite, medial carbonation, and a tad dry. Not a great beer, but quite quaffable, although I think it could or should have more body for a ""Winter Warmer""."
"clear dark bronze in color, poured a medium head that stuck around and left a good deal of lace. muted malt aroma with some spicy hops. tastes very good. a nice blend of roasted caramel and chocolate malts with a bit of spices and finishing hop bite. a little thin in mouthfeel but very drinkable and warming. i'm a fan of this style/flavor of winter brew. it needs some backbone, but the malt flavor is great. recommended."
"This is the first year I tried this one.  Beautiful mohagony color.  Great malt taste.  Very good.  This beer tastes as if it was aged in oak.  Nice warming winter brew."
