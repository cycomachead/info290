Taste gets slightly more malty with warming temps. Definite caramel finishing yet still more biscuity in my batch. Enjoyable beer.","Kyseber","Apr 02, 2015"

Lives up to every one of the 70 IBU's.  A hint of caramel from the malt but not a lot.

4,0.8,,,,,,"From a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours Amber to ruby with a tan rocky one finger head. The aroma is light with notes of grapefruit, pine, and salty sweet caramel malt. Although this has an excellent balance of hops and malt, it is generally malt-forward as an amber should be. The hops don't remain throughout, giving way to the aforementioned salty sweet caramel malt that dominates to the dry finish. This beer has some of the best malt flavor of any I have tried. However, the hops, as well as the overall flavor tend to diminish as it warms, which lowers the score a bit for me. Very good, but not my favorite red ale.","doublenaughtspy","Nov 27, 2014"

3.48,-12.3,4,4,3,3.75,3.5,"Unfortunately I lost my early review, where I took notes before Green Flash had played with the recipe.  The beer still has a lot of the same qualities - crisp, bold hop presence, citrus notes, nutty rye and a sweetbread balance.   But with the amped-up ABV and bigger malt-backbone (albeit more hops as well), there's a cloying, molasses aspect that make this brew much less drinkable.  With all of the big, hoppy beers out there, it seems unnecessary for Green Flash to mess with a classic.  Maybe it was to make a  clear line of demarcation between their big beers and their tasty session brews.  Either way, this just isn't as tasty.  Oh well.","rand","Nov 03, 2014"

I was listening to some Pink Floyd and drinking this and I`ve got to say this is a very good Red ale.Not quite as good as a Lagunitas Imperial red ale but still very good.Go buy you a 4 pack and you will see what i mean.Hoppy beers rock,Motley.","Motleydrunk56","Sep 16, 2014"

Aftertaste is lingering bitter citrus hops. Palate is medium and somewhat sticky. Overall nice balance with some sweet maltiness playing well with the big hop punch.","BeerZar","Sep 15, 2014"

A beautiful color with crystal clarity.  I really need to do a side-by-side with Founders Red Rye since this is pretty close for a red IPA.","Tuck_leepulin","Sep 01, 2014"

I would definitely drink this again, but I am not sure that it is up there with Lagunatis Mondo, which is probably my favorite example of this style of beer due to the more prominent hop presence.","antott0523","Apr 26, 2014"

3.81,-4,4.25,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and nice example of a Hoppy Red Ale and it had pretty much all the quality's that I look for in the style, the hop profile was nice and the malt base was identifiable as a Red Ale. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these especially when the weather gets a little warmer. What I like the most about this beer is the mouthfeel and appearance, I thought they were both pretty good and they were what I expect from a good hoppy Red Ale. What I like the least about this beer is the bitterness level, it's a little low for the style and I think the malt base can support a little more bitterness. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a hoppy Red Ale, but I'm not sure I would buy a whole six pack. I would recommend this as a solid hoppy Red Ale. All in all I enjoyed this beer and I thought it was pretty solid all the way around, but I still think a little more bitterness might take this beer to the next level. So far this is my favorite beer from Green Flash. Nice job guys, this was a very solid Hoppy Red Ale, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Mar 07, 2014"

3.84,-3.3,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Let's start by saying ""I love Green Flash"". This brew blends two of my favorite styles of beer, red and ipa. It pours a cloudy red amber hue with an off white head that gives way to a gentle white film and slight lacing. The nose is fresh and hoppy with citrus and grassy notes abounding. There is also a substantial malt background that reminds one that this is a red ale. It sips smooth and light light with a very pleasant bitter coating to the palate. The flavors are refreshing and easy on the palate. Definite citrus hops notes and a refreshing finish that reminds me of faygo red pop. This is a delicious hybrid from one of America's best brewers. Can't wait to enjoy another on a hot summer's day.","lochef81","Feb 12, 2014"

The beer has a floral smell as well as a bit of pine resin. The hop smells are balanced out by a bit of sweet malt but still has an overall hoppy smell. the beer tastes similar to the smell but is less hop forward. The sweet malt taste is stronger than the smell and has a hint of breaded malt. The beer also has a strong bitter hop taste with hints of pine resin. The pine lingers in the mouth afterwards. The beer has a medium body with a smooth feel even though it is a little thick. Overall, a pretty good amber ale that I would like to have again in the future.","HattedClassic","Nov 27, 2013"

Aromas of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop and malt flavors; with crisp and quite balanced malt/hops with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent red IPA. All around great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

While I was impressed with their other IPA offerings I find myself a bit disappointed with their Red IPA effort. The flavor just seemed to be missing that sort of spark that makes me want to take another sip. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'm always willing to give a beer another try if it's from a brewery that has earned my respect like Green Flash has done.","JamesMN","Oct 12, 2013"

Overall, it is far more estery than BD and the palate hints at a possible close-to-expiry-date freshness for this bottle, but still I find it an extremely enjoyable experience with this beer style with an ironic name, Red India Pale Ale…","wl0307","Jun 09, 2013"

Pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrusy with pine also and sweet malts. This beer is far above average and is solidifying red ipa's becoming one of my favorite styles. Taste is awesome bitter grapefruity up front, balanced by sweet bready malts, pine on the back end. Mouthfeel is almost creamy. Overall pretty awesome beer, would definitely pick it up again.

Bready with a healthy dose of toffee and just a faint roastiness. Hops lend a big spiciness and floral note backed by orange flesh. Bitterness is balanced pretty evenly.

It's actually not bad if it were just a big red ale or even an old ale...it reminds me of a slightly more bitter version of GD Hibernation. As a ""red IPA", however, it falls short. This was given to me as a single. GF does date their cases so be on the lookout for a date if you are purchasing it in that format...for sixers and singles you've gotta hope to get lucky. I didn't this time around.","AdamGarcia","Apr 02, 2013"

4.04,1.8,4.25,4.5,3.75,4,4,"Served on tap at the Saucer into a snifter on 3/23/13. Pours a deep, solid reddish-amber like well polished cherry furnitures. The head is full bubbles of dark off white stacking about 3cm with incredible lacing. The smell is full of resinous hops and sweet cane sugar. There is vibrant tropical fruits and malty sweetness, pineapple core, and pine cone resin. Great smell overall. The taste is heavy of malt with very good hop backbone. The taste is a little hefty on the sweet overall, which just slightly calls detriment to the overall tast. The mouthfeel is very full, thick with oily hops. Overall, this is another beer that wins much on draft that it lacked in the bottle. It's a truly good beer overall, especially fresh.","estlinska","Mar 29, 2013"

I don't get much of the Amarillo hopping either, old bottle perhaps. Overall, a loosely held together beer that isn't quite the sum of its parts.","rawfish","Jan 10, 2013"
4.13,4,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,4,"It pours a semi-clear, medium brown color with a beige head. There is a good strong scent of Amarillo hops. The taste is rich with a complex blend of hops. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a mouthful of grains that finishes with a mild bitter after taste. The texture is smooth and keeps you coming back for more. Not quite a red ale and not quite an IPA, but very tasty nevertheless.","Lemke10","Jan 09, 2013"

The hop seems too subtle for a standard american IPA, but does have a nice hop malt balance which seems more characteristic of an amber ale. If you're looking for a standard hop bomb, this is not for you. If you want a beer that blends sweet malt with a mild hop bitterness, then this is for you. Not a bad beer by any means, but not an IPA, IMO.","steve8robin","Dec 23, 2012"

They come in about midway through the sip and not in a pleasant way. They just make the beer taste bitter. I know that's what hops do, but in this beer they don't really add anything to the flavor. It doesn't taste hoppy, the beer just becomes bitter. The roasted malts save the beer considerably and saved the beer for me.

Flavors are more scotch malt on the palate, with a peppery and floral hops blast at the end of the palate, leaving a bitter and resiny aftertaste.

Bready and caramel malts can be detected in the nose as well. The beer tastes like a sweeter West Coast IPA. The citrus and floral hops really balance up front with the sweeter and bready malts. The piney bitterness comes out in the middle and back end, leaving some in the aftertaste. The flavors are well balanced. The body is medium with some carbonation.

As you'd expect, the nose was very hoppy with traces of resin, grass, and grapefruit. An alcohol/phenol blast is the first thing that registered with me taste-wise with a strong aftertaste of hops in the finish. Average carbonation and near medium-bodied. I was a bit put off by the strong alcohol tinge up front after getting so excited over the smell. Sadly, this beer does not perform as well as it's cousin West Coast IPA.","maleman","Apr 27, 2012"

Aroma of herbal hops, citrus and some pineapple. Flavor is hop assertive, with citrus hops overwhelming a moderate sweet malt backbone. Finish is citrus hops, a bit metallic.

4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with fluffy head and lacing. Aroma is floral and citrus, typical heavy Green Flash dry hopping. Loaded with juicy citrus and floral hops, Green Flash sure knows how to put together a great hop profile, but more caramel malt base than a typical IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous, with dry finish. Green Flash made some slight recipe changes to this beer in redefining it as a ""Red IPA", but it's still delicious.","coldriver","Feb 04, 2012"

Medium bodied with a remarkable balance between the rich maltiness and the hoppy bitterness. The malty backbone hits the palate as do the hops, followed by a semi-sweet finish that is not cloying.

You don't have to stick your nose into this one to get a whiff of the potent hops and grassy notes in this beer. Great smell, and my first taste didn't disappoint either. As a professed hophead, I was pretty satisfied with this beer. The hops are the main attraction and the beer finishes very nicely to make it very drinkable, lingering on the back of the tongue. Medium mouthfeel lightly and drinkably make this one that you can have multiple of in a night. I imagine this is even better when enjoyed straight from a fresh tap.","mfavoino","Jan 07, 2012"

For me I think my palate has gone more places, but I respect the fact that this is one of those southern California session beers that craft and BMC people alike could appreciate. For what it is, it's hard not to appreciate it. That said, it comes off a bit too tame to me now.

There is just a touch metallic flavor in the hops, but it is super minor. Mouthfeel is nice with a good body and a nice medium carbonation. Sits a touch sweet on the tongue.

4.12,3.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark copper, lots of yeast dregs float around with an off color white / light tan head, it leaves a nice lacing. The smell is of pine hops and caramel malts. The feel is medium light, the initial taste is of hops, you get some of the caramel malts on the way down and then it leaves you with plenty of hop bitterness and a slight alcohol burn. Overall a pretty good beer but I prefer the flavor and higher hops of their regular IPA (the true hop head).

Poured with a frosty off-white head that slowly reduces to a wispy cap and a few sticky lacings. Very fresh hop aroma, like sticking your nose in a bag of hop pellets. Floral and pine hop aromas along with caramelized malt. Medium bodied with a lighly resinous feel. Fresh floral hop flavor up front with a hint of citrus. Floral hop continues through the middle with the citrus flavors transitioning to pine and sweet carmelized malt coming thru.

4.02,1.3,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The theory behind this beer is that the sweet, malt characteristics of a red ale would balance out a substantial IPA bitterness and a huge IPA dry hopping. For the most part, this works, but sometimes the hops overrun the malty body. The body has a medium consistency, but still hints at oily hops. The malts are indeed sweet and bold, but each sip easily yields to floral and piny hops. Several minutes after a sip my mouth still tastes like it was dry hopped, which is spectacular for a hop-lover like me, but probably won't work for everybody. This is definitely an intriguing beer, but you shouldn't try Hop Head unless you qualify as one.","HarrisonDean","Feb 18, 2011"

The piney hop character was also dominating the palate with cirusy, nutty, caramel, grassy accents and a good sweet malty balance but had a touch of booze to round out this brew. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, piney hoppy, slighty nutty, and crisp finish. It was drinking very good and was really tasty.

3.98,0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Popurs a deep rusty red that's slightly hazy with some yeast floaties meandering about. Light tan head doesn't last long. The aroma is abundant with both grapefruit and caramel. There's also some floral hoppiness and a hint of chocolate. This extends into the taste as well. It doesn't really get to a point where one smell or taste dominates the other. Pretty well balanced, I guess. I don't get a lot of pine, personally, but it is there if you look for it. Rich and creamy with a slightly resinous feel to this medium leaning toward full bodied beer. Goes down extremely easy.

The pour is good with a nice, fluffy off-white head contrasting with the red body. The aroma combines those citrussy West Coast hops with a light bit of malt (and unfortunately a touch of dustiness). The flavour comes down to a balance between citrussy, piney, resinous hops and the caramel, toffee malts of the red ale.

Pours a deep, semi-translucent, amber with a rocky, two inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Delicate clumps of sticky lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose is pretty subdued but implies caramel malt, citrus and an earthy hops quality. Taste consistent with nose; flavors are nicely interwoven. Malt comes out initially, followed by citrus acidity towards the middle, and culminating in an earthy bitterness towards the back that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency that lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks. A very good Amber - perhaps a little slanted towards the bitter end of the spectrum, but solid and quite drinkable.","Jwale73","Sep 21, 2010"

This is obviously a blend of styles as they've brought IPA like hoppiness to the often moribund Red Ale category. As with all blends however, there are compromises. This is especially notable in the maltiness which tends to neutralize the complexity that is so successful in the WCIPA.

Nicely rich amber color, fully opaque, slightly more orange at the rims, tiny beads here and there, looks like there could be a catfish living in there. The nose has a welcome relaxed quality about it, semi-laconic unfolding of malts, caramel and milk chocolate segueing into pine, sweet and sour grapefruit to orange citrus, spring blossoms and a croissant, danish flakiness, the green nature of the hops bristles without lunging for your jugular. Medium-bodied, the carbonation adds a slow churn that allows for both palate pressure and measured pacing forward. This is a dry and hoppy beer, no doubt, simply not out to bludgeon you with the fact, gets grassy and piney while always leaving room for chocolate, toffee, bread and caramel. Orange to white grapefruit citrus is tight and lean, neither decisively sweet nor sour. The apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, green apple fruit ekes out a marginal presence, not a focal point. it's not keenly balanced but better for it, particularly with the general lack of pushiness.

How nice! The only other beer that I know uses Amarillos like this is Gumballhead, they are a nice, fruity hop, grapefruity hop, with a slightly spicey edge to them. This beer has a great balance to it for such a hoppy ale, due to the reddish malts, which add a touch of sweetness. Beer has a thick, rocky head with lacing that sticks all of over the glass. The beer is not so much just another big IPA, but complex, red ale. The mouthfeel is very full with oilyness from all the drop hopping.

If you want an IPA/hop fix with your reds go w/ this beer b/c while their is mild sweet malt and a biscuity/breadiness there for a slightly chewey medium body, there is a distinct hop bite that is sharp and leads to a real dry finish.

Has a one-finger light tan head that seems to have good retention and left some good lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma here is strong of hops and they are very enticing, the dry hopping with the Amarillo gives a nice floral scent. In the background I think I am picking up some roasted and caramel malt aromas. The flavor is very good, hops dominate and give a real nice flavor, very floral in flavor and seem to tail off to a almost tea like flavor. The hop resin seems to coat the tongue and wants to stick around as for several minutes after I still taste hops. The malt is hard to pin point except for a sweet feel that is there.

The taste and palate are hop oily and a carbonated hop oil with maybe some bread. The hops are just a bit over done and just linger on my palate way to long.

I love hoppy beers like this that are really really bitter. This one is dry, hoppy, and did I mention hoppy? Mouthfeel is about medium, with the malt barely noticeable (at least for me).

The head is a very substantial light tan bit of topography that collapses into a thick lace. The aroma brings a very nice citrus pine blend over the sweet malt, very enticing. The first swig is WOW with crisp citrus bite that settles into some of that green pine that was evidenced in the aroma. The malt is a more bready variety and the woodsy pine really grows, taking on a medicinal tingle that is very likeable. The carbonation is lively and tasteful in a solid mid-bodied brew that is refreshing and dangerously drinkable. The hops are just lovely here as they settle in a dry sheen on your tongue with a pleasant horshound sort of sweetness. This is my style of red ale! Sweet and bitter married and mellowed, yet lively.

The smell is great, bright citrusy (orange and pineapple) hops and some malt sweetness comes through after it sits a bit. In the taste I get more bitterness in the hops, which was a bit different than the smell which was more citrusy. The hop bitterness is balanced out with a bit of malty caramel sweetness. Believe the name. Nice smooth body of a red ale with a good bitter aftertaste that will sit in the back of your mouth. A very nice brew although this site has it at 6% the bottle is claiming it's 6.4%. I'd recommend it.","psurandy","May 04, 2009"

Excellent hop taste bursts through with malty and floral hints; it was hoppy on the sweet side, and had a dry crisp finish. Overall a great brew that should be in the IPA class as it has too much taste and too many hops to be a standard ale. It went down easy and I look forward to enjoying more of these!","CHickman","May 03, 2009"

Color is brown with ruby red edges. A nice hit of oily hops excites the nose with a bit of citrus hanging around underneath. A little earthiness is also detected. Tastes of oily hops with a spicy and malty undercurrent and some alcohol heat at the very back. The malts balance out afer a few drinks, and overall the components interact well with each other. Mouth-feel lies on the heavy side of medium, and there's a good amount of carbonation. This one really works for me.","stephens101","Apr 28, 2009"

They aren't kidding about calling this hop head - I'd swear it was an IPA from the smell and not a red ale. Tons of hop aroma, with pine being the most dominate character. This beer has a big body that sits thick in your mouth until the bitterness overwhelms all of your taste buds. There's no questioning that this was dry hopped. The finish is slightly lingering. This beer reminds me a lot of an IPA, but with a stronger malt presence.","curasowa","Mar 06, 2009"

Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. So far this beer has a lot of promise; if well done this might be my favorite style of beer. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Bitterness is present but not overpowering and a dryness is noticeable and fairly strong. Tastes strongly of hops and then some sweet malt come through. Slight biscuit flavor is present in the finish and there is a hint of fruit throughout. A general dryness prevails and makes you want to drink another and another. Wow, what an unexpected find - this is a great blend (heavy on the hops). Definitely worth a try!","Tone","Mar 05, 2009"

The feel is moderate to thick, with a good amount of carbonation to cut the maltiness. Definitely finishes bitter but there is a nice balance between the hop and malt. A real nice hoppy amber ale.

The head stays around and leaves good lacing. The smell is probably the best part. Says on the bottle ""dry hopped with Amarillo", and I believe it. I can smell them for days, and it's really great. There's also a whiff of sweetness and maltiness underneath. The taste is nice. There's a good maltiness, like a bready, nutty, biscuity taste filled with some sweetness from caramel malts, but definitely not overly sweet. The malts are balanced with a nice hop bitterness and there's some hop flavor in there, but not as much as there could be. In the mouthfeel, there's kind of a chalky taste from the bitterness. And there's something else, almost like an alcohol burn, but I can't seem to imagine it being that because of the 6% and the malty/hoppi-ness, maybe it's the carbonation, a bit too much and it burns the tongue. The drinkability is good. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't go for a whole 6-pack in a night. I could handle two or three though and enjoy it.","taylorhamrick","Jan 14, 2009"

I might just be a sucker for these hoppy beers, but I'm a happy sucker. Green Flash certainly does a good job with hops. This beer has good citric bitterness with some balance provided by sweet caramel malt. I don't know what else to say about it. My reviews of hop-heavy beers tend to sound similar. This beer has a strong hop flavor but doesn't overwhelm the palette quite as much as some. It's not the crisp bitterness of Stone's Ruination but more of a smooth bittersweet flavor. The feel is nice and oily from the hops but also tends to get a bit watery on the finish. The drinkability is good but it feels a bit heavy for a 6% abv beer.","popery","Nov 26, 2008"

Pretty well balanced but finishes on the bitter side, which I would expect from a beer with such a name. Hop cone aroma and taste is dead on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated.

A smaller malt base than the bottled version as well. Just a bit of caramel and a biscuity undertone to support the delicious hops. A nice bitterness with light dryness. Good carbonation leaves a tickle on the tongue and it's so refreshing that you can't help but take another sip soon after.

Good hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and dry, slightly thin *for the style*. Drinkability is good, if your a hophead that is. Overall, this is a very nice tasting clean, well made beer. I always debate whether or not to reem beers like this though, because to me, this is more like a red IPA (ala mars, celebration, furious, etc.) than it is like your average, stereotypical amber/red ale, although there are some amber ale characteristics in this. They clearly wanted to express the hops in this one, as stated on the label, so I gave it an honest rating, as they let me know, hey this red ale has some hops. Really though, who gives a shit what the *actual style* is if the beer tastes great, which this one does, so go get some, its good.","AKBelgianBeast","Sep 07, 2008"

With the name of this beer, the aroma is hardly unexpected: a hugely hoppy nose, full of citrus, pine-resin notes--but there's also some sweet, lightly caramel malt. Flavor is better than the IPA, more balanced. There's still a very high bitterness, load upon load of hop flavor, but also some lightly toasted, sweet malt.

The citrus hops come in, with a lot of grapefruit, and it is followed up very lightly by the malt. I'd say the malt in this red is a lot less pronounced than many in this style.

It looks innocent enough and the hops are certainly the signature taste (hence the name) It paired well with the spicy chicken we were eating and I would probably drink this again.

If you're looking for a sweeter malty red or American amber then this will probably be too hoppy but as the label indicates if you are interested in a variation on an IPA then it will not disappoint.

Smells very well integrated with caramel malt and spicy hops with a touch of cinammon. Nice. Quite a bit more hops in the taste. Immediately there are earthy, piney, spicy hops with lingering bitterness. The malt definitely plays second fiddle here. On the finish, there is a bit more of the red character from the malt. There is a creamy smoothness that rounds the dges a bit that you sometimes get with some of the better reds. It is definitely here. Quite enjoyable, especially for a red, and the amazing thing is that the abv is kept well in check for all the flavor here. Kudos!","Georgiabeer","Jul 27, 2008"

Grassy with a hint of pine in the nose as well. A creamy honey scent blends in well with this one. The sweet malts begin on the tongue but are quickly dominated by the hop character. A good amount of pine and earthy hops midway that lead to a pretty dry and bitter aftertaste. Damn, this is an Red Ale? Slick medium body with a full, creamy feel and a stinging carbonation.

2.88,-27.5,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Poured a very clouded amber. Not much in the way of a head. Smell is rather mild. Which is a bit surprising when you get the first sip which attacks you with dry hops. You would expect something this highly hopped to have more of an aroma. Odd. There isn't much to this beer other than hops. This is a decent beer to get your hop fix on but nothing extraordinary. Kind of a bit raw tasting. Mouthfeel is decent enough. Medium body medium carbonation.","barleywinefiend","May 27, 2008"
4.32,8.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours dark amber with a thin head. Nice lacing. Big hop smell which is borderline IPA. Taste is very hoppy but has the amber ale flavor as well. Mouthfeel is smooth & it has a good bite to it. Cheers to a fine brew from Green Flash.","SkinnyElvis","May 26, 2008"

3.95,-0.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy deep amber with a thin head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is deep pine hops and burnt caramel in a nice balance. The taste is bitter pine hops followed by a nice caramel sweetness that lingers as a nice balance. The beer is on the light side of medium with low carbonation, just a little bit on the bitter side. While not the best hoppy amber ale I've had, it's the best (and I'm pretty sure the only) one I've seen here in NC.","atsprings","May 19, 2008"

3.86,-2.8,5,4,3.5,4,4,"The taste was good, but a bit too bitter for the style. Sweet caramel malts hit first, but were soon overpowered by a pungently bitter hoppiness. As I said, I love hoppy beers, but this one probably fits the IPA category a little better. The mouthfeel was light in body as per the style, smooth, slightly sticky, and left a whopping, resinous pine note on the back of the tongue. Overall, though, I liked this beer. Green Flash certainly lives up to its ""west-coast hop bomb"" credentials, although I would've liked to have seen them tone down the hops (or turn up the malts!) a bit in this one.","wagenvolks","May 19, 2008"

4.27,7.6,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz Harp Glass. Color is a wonderfully deep mahogany. Almost a ruby red when held up to light. Manly pour results in a 3 finger fluffy head, that slowly reseeds leaving moderate to light lacing. Smell is absolutely a hop heads dream. Massive citrus floral bouquet. Rich is probably the best way to describe this beverage. Malt backed coppery ale, with massive amounts of hops. Very well balanced, nice dry finish. This is a very nice beer!","Kraken","May 16, 2008"

4.02,1.3,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"On tap at Stone for the San Diego Storm. Dark cherry color with a foamy and rocky light tan head. The smell was so unique that I've never experienced it before. It was the smell of hop pellets straight from the homebrew store. Very dank and volatile. The taste was malty, maybe more toasty toward the end of the sip, and quite a bit citrusy and resiny. An interesting beer, overall a bit much for me to drink a lot of but the glass was pleasant.","MiScusi","May 15, 2008"
4.27,7.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"This is a very good ""red ale."" I don't really see how it's all that different from an IPA, but I don't really care either. It's good, and anyone who likes hops should give it a try. Recommended.","vtfan77","May 15, 2008"
4.41,11.1,3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer poured a dark reddish-amber (with small chunks of Amarillo hops used to dry hop, I'm assuming) with a thick tan head into a pint glass. There was an intensely resinous-piney aroma of hops - awesome. The initial taste was of sweet malt, but shortlived, as the resinous hop flavor took over, followed by a clean, crisp hop bitterness at the finish. A great IPA and another success by Green Flash. You can't beat the IPAs coming out of California right now (i.e. Green Flash, Stone, Lagunitas).","pershan","May 15, 2008"

4.22,6.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Color is a dark brick-red brown with a moderate white head. Smells of citrus, almost like an IPA. Tastes of malt as you would expect, as well as a decent dose of citrusy hops, as if it was blended with a hoppy pale ale. But the hops don't overwhelm--the blend of flavors is right on the money. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer.","PhxHorn","May 12, 2008"
4.23,6.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Quite a likeable ale but it is strong hoppy stuff and completely unsuited to lager drinkers. If you like hops and Brown Ale you will love this stuff.","Zorro","May 12, 2008"
3.68,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Very nice reddish color. Off white head. Aroma is somewhat muted-not as out there as I would have thought. Quite grapefruity. Big hop flavor and bitterness. Harsh hop bite in the finish. Slight trace of caramel sweetness. The harshness knocks it down a notch for me. Decent body. A decent beer for the most part. If this is strictly amarillo hops its good to see them stand out on their own. I know some folks here dont care for them. ABV listed @ 6%.","lackenhauser","May 11, 2008"
4.35,9.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"reddish brown with a tan head that held well and left pretty nice lace. nose was caramelly and citrus hoppy with some earthiness in the background. very nice. taste was the same with a little nutty woodsiness. i found it to be very well balanced. hops were just enough to feed the jones, but not enough to destroy the balance. medium full body with a nice bitterness in the finish. very easy drink and perfect for the time of year. another top notch brew from green flash. it might not please someone who is expecting a super hop bomb that will knock them on their ass, but it should very well please anyone hoping to enjoy a few nice, well balanced beers that contain a few subtle nuances.","timtim","May 11, 2008"
4.2,5.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Dark amber/ reddish-brown color with a creamy light tan head. Aromas of pine bark, cedar, toasty caramel malt and brown rice syrup. Pleasant balance of woodsy coniferous flavor with the caramel malt. This has a sort of Pacific Northwest ESB kinda thing going on. Great with a crisp spring or fall day and a flannel shirt. Some hopheads might wish this had more IBUs (only 45) but I think that any more would upset the balance (even though say - 60 IBUs might be more to some people's liking for a 6% alc. beer). Medium-to-full body with a nice bitter finish on top of the caramel malt. This beer grows on you, but only if you let go of any hopes, ideas, or preconceived notions of a hop orgy, and just tune in to what's actually going on in your glass.","dedrinker","May 09, 2008"
3.68,-7.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I always look forward to a good hoppy amber/red ale and Green Flash is the shiznit so I really was happy to pick up a few of these bottles yesterday here in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear deep bronze borderline amber color with a thick fluffy two finger slight off white head that never totally settled,deep chocolate notes in the nose with a some herbal hop but the malt to me is stronger than the hop presence.I love the Amarillo hop and this was dry hopped with it but in all honesty it doesnt play a huge impact flavor wise at least in my mind,its deeply chocolaty with a leafy herbal hop presence finish dry and prety earthy.Its a decent brew but maybe a bit underwhelming.","oberon","May 08, 2008"
