3.77,0.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Enjoyed from the bomber in a Liefmans snifter.  This holiday ale pours a bright ruby red with a tenacious off white head that lingers long till dissipating to a thin layer and thick ring of foam with moderate lacing.  Nose of spicy hops, sweet raisins and caramel, and an underlying earthy tone.  Flavors follow the nose with a rich caramel and juicy hop notes that vies for dominance.  Sweet raisins are noted in the background but are overtaken by the bittering hops.  Light carbonation to moderate carbonation and a smooth mouth feel finishes wet and bitter.  Remember past years being a bit sweeter, but then again only have this once a year.  Reminiscent of a red Mogul ale which is  an awesome brew.  Improves a lot with warmth.  Nice.","Brutaltruth","Feb 27, 2015"

It did not compliment the food I was eating in any way. It was not refreshing or warming or palate cleansing or anything I would want out of a simple holiday dinner beer. If you are going to put Santa in your title, at least give me a little spice! It was, as the 65 IBUs suggest, somewhat bitter, but I like my bitter with some flavor before it. Perhaps I made the mistake of drinking this with dinner. Perhaps on its own it is better than my review suggests.

3.77,0.5,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style it had pretty much everything that I look for in the style along with the nice balance that I expect from a good Red Ale.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little crisp, a little creamy, not too filling and the taste did a good job at holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a couple of these and I think it makes for a nice change from the typical Winter Warmers.  What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was and the balance, to me those were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was that more of those citrus rind hop aspects that I got in the aroma showed up in the taste.  I would buy this beer again and I'm pretty sure I'll get a couple bottles when it's released next year.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Red Ales, it does a good job at representing the style.  All in all I was happy with this beer, there was nothing fancy about it, it was just a good and straightforward Red Ale and I enjoyed drinking it.  It's up there as one of the better Rouge beers I've had and I think it's above average for the style.  Good job guys this was a tasty Red Ale, keep up the solid work.","StoutHunter","Nov 24, 2014"

4,6.7,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"Bomber decanted into an American pint glass. A rich cloudy bronze color with a copious quantity of light tan head, and a snappy, tangy, yet sweet aroma of caramel, pine, grapefruit rind, peppery spice, and faint pineapple. Tastes rather roasted and bitter, with an amazing green and spicy hop bouquet a la many of Rogue's offerings. Evokes orange spice black tea, young sweetish pine needles, red berry, nicotine, and an emergent butter tart sweetness. Fairly chewy and with a rather smooth mouthfeel despite the aggressive resinous hops. Reminds me of Captain Sig's albeit a touch thicker, roastier, and spicier, certainly less sweet. The Rogue farm hopyard varieties convey this peppery, grassy, juicy resin vibe that is borderline addictive. I will go ahead and say it, Rogue makes my favorite red ales to date. The combination of sweet malts and piney hops is tricky, and these sometimes nutty beek geek hippies out there on the farm have cracked the code and figured out how to do the style to near-perfection. Its probably best to pretend Voodoo Donut doesn't exist and not deprive yourself of these gems. YMMV of course.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 15, 2014"

3.68,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass; no bottle dating, but is a 2013 release. Pours fairly hazy ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, floral, grass, herbal, pine, light nuttiness, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, nuttiness, floral, grass, pine, herbal, and floral/toasted earthiness. Good amount of earthy pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, caramel, toast, biscuit, brown sugar, floral, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber ale style. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Nov 20, 2013"

Piney/gently citrusy and lightly fruity. The body is medium with a fine & median carbonation. The flavor starts softly fruity and lightly nutty. A nicely sweet caramel maltiness comes through before becoming engulfed in resiny hop flavor and bitterness. And yet, the bitterness never really builds on the palate. Extremely well balanced for such a boldly hopped beer! It finishes quite dry with just some residual maltiness and a bold lingering bitterness.","Serge","Dec 19, 2012"

One detects mild hints of amber and a slight level of tartness, but not much else. Toward the end, a sense of grapiness develops which continues into the aftertaste.

If you like hoppy reds or IPAs then this is one to try. If you were looking for a more maltier winter ale this beer probably won't scratch that itch.

This was nice to try once, but I don't think I'll seek it out again.","tdm168","Nov 20, 2012"

While there are some spicy notes and a nice dollop of malty/caramel sweetness, the beer seems over-hopped and just doesn't come through on the mouthfeel. As I said before, this doesn't really taste like a holiday ale. It tastes more like a weirded-out IPA. Although I will give it a few bonus points for being made with locally sourced ingredients and having ""no chemicals, additives, or preservatives"" (per the bottle).","cjoc83","Nov 13, 2012"

Smell is of malt and some herbal and grassy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 09, 2012"

Good toffee and sweet aromas, with a slight hopping in the background. Flavors are more hop-forward, with a good caramel malt backbone and some roasty characteristics. Slight spicing throughout the beer gives a more festive flavor profile. The aftertaste is a slight resiny hops presence, with a caramel blend once again.

The Chinook hops in this one are evident as there is a piney bitterness to this brew. Malts are there and taste more on the toasted end where they should be. The mouthfeel is crisp and it has a nice medium body, some spices thrown into the amber make this a nice middle-of-the-road Christmas ale for those not into winter warmers or strong ales.","Prospero","Feb 10, 2011"
3.13,-16.5,4,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured a nice rosin color, not unlike that of the bottle from which it came from. A nicely formed off-white creamy head that faded to a thin ring and left a decent lace on the glass. Quite clear. Aromas of spruce, pine sap, and a touch of nuttiness. Slight caramel as well, but not very pronounced. It seems a bit lacking/muted in this department, but the pine character is pronounced. The flavor is mainly bitterness, a touch of medicinal bitters, and something like pine cone extract. Pretty interesting, although I'm not completely sold here. There's just not much going on here. And I do not enjoy the mouthfeel for this beer at all. Thin and watery. A decent carbonation bumps it up half a point.

The aroma was of roasted malts,a doughy yeast and an herbal hop with a note of caramel and some spiciness. It tasted mildly sweet with a caramel overtone at the start and matured into a sweet-bitter-malty flavor that had a nice hoppiness at the finish.

Pretty decent head retention, it looks like it wants to hold on for dear life. Smells... hoppy. deep pine and earth notes are stepping up on this one, all over my nose. Also notes of zesty orange rind, the best I've ever smelt this particular aroma without it coming off as a spice. The orange flavors come through as well. There's a lot of citrus hop flavor going on. I want to say burnt grapefruit and pine. My focus is drawn mostly to this hop flavor. It's pretty present, but not super strong. The medium-light text almost leaves a syrup like after taste I almost wish was there from the start. Caramel, pound cake flavors from the malt, like the cookie part of a Black and White. There's a cake batter smoothness to the texture as well. The hops seem to do most of the talking, which is nice for this beer. It's a little hard to get past the hops, which give the taste of winter spot on. You have to do a little more searching for the malt, but it's there. This achieves similar things to some of the Scandinavian spiced/winter brews, which I like.","100floods","Jan 09, 2011"

Flavor remains true to the aroma, on a light to moderate body that is a refreshing change from the usual heavy holiday ale.

Taste is a medium-dark toasted barley mixed with smokey and bitter hops. There is a lot of hop action in this brew, including some roasted bitter hops with the bitterness increased by the roasting. The aroma doesn't reflect the darker and more bitter taste of the hops, but the herbal note of them works with the winter beer approach. Strong, bitter mouthfeel, which makes it a bit less drinkable than it would be otherwise. Overall a good beer, but slightly overpowered by the roasted/burnt hop flavor.","Zodijackyl","Dec 07, 2010"

(JK about the hippies, we don't put them in our beer) and there is a decent malty smell in there too. Taste is mostly malty, but pretty easy-going. It also has a prevalent hop and spice taste. Mouthfeel is smooth, average carbonation. Drinkability is decent.

Can have 2 or 3 of these in a sitting and still function and not be totally weighed down. Still gives the warming effect that the high ABV beers give but because it is so complex.

Lemon grass, grapefruit, lemon, pine, and pith characterize the aroma. Hops hit the palate first, with pine, lemon, and pith the most notable flavors. Malt isn't far behind though, with with just enough flavor to balance the hop presence - caramel, nut, and dark chocolate notes within. Malt take the lead toward the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, just enough to enhance the drinkability. Wow, in a sea of ESBs, spiced beers, and stouts, this one stands out from the pack. Perfectly balanced, complex, and super-drinkable. Nothing wrong with this brew.

Lacing is alright left in high quantities before I take a sip. Smell has a pretty large portion of hops, piney ones, and some pale malts can be picked up. Eventually it is just pale malts that dominate the nose. Nothing very special about the smell here. This beer has one of the strangest hop flavors to it. The individual elements of this beer are nice but they don't really blend well. The hops seem unchecked even though this isn't a hop bomb. I think there is too much piney hops and nothing else. Some citrus hops and sweets too. Also pick up some citrus peel and spices. I guess it reminds me of Xmas but the piney hops bitterness are just too much for me here. It is still better than average I would say because of the malt backbone once it shines through. Mouthfeel is way too light and I can tell right away. The carbonation is fine and there isn't any warming but it reminds me of water upon the first sip. Drinkability is not to bad besides the extreme pine hop bitterness factor.

The Chinook (10-14AA) and Centennial hops (7-11AA) used to brew this beer probably adds to lingering bitter flavor experienced afterwards. One thing that I noticed about the beer that it interesting is that; the malt is slightly apparent at first, it is overwhelmed by hops/spruce, and then comes back slightly as you breath out.

There's some notes of other spices present, but I really get the full effect of the multiple hops as the main characteristic in the taste.

The flavors were very malty with excellent depth, all the aforementioned malts with some roasted notes and nuttiness.

Neither is dominate, but instead a good blend of flavors. The aftertaste is mostly the bitterness of hops. A strong combination of malt and hops with an ease in the drinkability.

3.58,-4.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,"A hoppy red ale with a taste that runs more toward the bitter than the rich. For me, this does not have the professional feel of other Rogue beers. The taste is underwhelming and somewhat bitter without enough of the favorable characteristics of hops. It's hardly without positive aspects, though, and I'm only being so harsh because of my expectations for a Rogue release. For one thing, it's a great looking beer. It has a spot-on color for an amber ale and a huge white-amber head. The nose is malty and sweet. It's nice but lacking the holiday stylings that I associate with a holiday ale. There's little spice or complexity. The taste is not incredible but far from bad. There are a fair amount of hops. They mostly come through with bitterness, which is rather unbalanced with an understated caramel malt. The mouthfeel is somewhat watery. As a somewhat watery and unbalancedly bitter beer, it's not the most drinkable brew in the world. The lack of spice and underwhelming flavor really hurt my enjoyment of this beer. I'm trying to evaluate it merely as an amber ale but Santa is right on the bottle. It needs some nutmeg, desperately. At least, a bit of cinnamon. I mean, why does Santa keep a private reserve of over-hopped amber ale? I need a ginger cookie.","popery","Nov 30, 2008"

The aroma is a nice juicy fresh hop, some grapefruit. Good for an amber ale. On the taste, the hops are the dominate flavor; some piney and metallic hop flavor. The malt doesn't really add any flavor, it is just kind of there. Despite the look and apparent malt presence, the flavor reminds me more of an east coast IPA or EIPA. The feel is moderate to full, with good carbonation, finishes with a good hoppy bitterness. By the appearence the malt is there but it really doesn't come out in the flavor.

Color is more a clear brown than an amber, maybe copper. The Tan colored head is largish and stays a bit. Lacing is only Okay. Taste is nutty and malty and too bitter for my liking with a lack of character to the bite. Astringent and unbalanced. The mouth feel is a mixture of sandpaper carbonation and water texture.

A toasted bread flavor hits the palate at first, but soon after grapefruit, grass, and pine flavors take over and dominate the flavor till the end. The feel is watery at first, it soon becomes heavier to become more medium bodied. At first I felt this was an okay beer, but as I drink more, the flavor and aroma begin to grow on me.

The first sip almost reminded me of one of my favorite breakfast dishes, half a grapefruit with honey drizzled over it. Wonderful hops in this matched with that sweet malty background with a trace of spices make this delightful. That grapefruit flavor lingers on the palate for a while.

Waltzing into a small, non-descript Morris County liquor store, I stumbled across two bottles left in the cooler, and was absolutely shocked after searching high and low for this one and continually coming up disappointed... Although this brew is considered a winter selection, it is nothing like a typical winter-warmer at all, and very much indeed an American Amber / Red Ale... no sweetness detected here, but instead, strong hops followed by a crisp, clear, slightly astringent taste with subtle bitterness... as the style name suggests, pours an amber-red color with minimal head... smell is full of grains and hops, with a bitterness noticeable in the aroma... good, clean mouthfeel and decent drinkability for this 6% ABV... good stuff from Rogue...

The color was (obviously) amber with red undertones, and it poured with minimal head. Carbonation level was low as well. The smell was musky, syrupy, and spicy. It tasted exactly like it smelled, and I could only get a third of it down. It was way too sticky/syrupy for me. I know Rogue puts out some excellent brews, and I'm sure this one is up to par.

Earthy hops, huge malt aromas, lots of grapefruit, orange and lemon peel, with a bit of pine in the background. Almost perfect. Now lets taste this bad boy. Tons of juicy hops with tons of citrus along side them, lots of sweet balancing malts, and a bit more pine that was noted in the nose. Very fruity.

Kind of pine like with a sweet touch on the tip of your tongue, but the dominant presence here is, surprise, the hops! Mouthfeel seems a little too carbonated. And I would put the drinkability higher if it weren't for the mass of hops that are there, just to be there.

Very pleasant to the taste buds but with a little more bitterness than I expected (perhaps the roguish side of old Kris Kringle). The aftertaste offered a spruce-like recognition that was risky for Rogue, but successful in my opinion. Very drinkable in a winter seasonal kind of way. You probably do not want to sit down for a session of these, however, it was good enough for me to recommend to several friends and buy a couple more bottles for future personal enjoyment (despite the somewhat higher per bottle price).

This deep garnet brew has a big fluffy whites head on it like an IPA. Malts and bready goodness really show through on the aroma with some piney hops there in the background. While the aroma focuses on the malts, the taste is very much rooted in the hops. It starts out a tad sweet, then the hops take over with some big hop oil flavors.

Arrived early and got to try some goodies downstairs and made my way up around the upstairs and right up in front of the cask for a while. After blowing up to the ceiling, it mellowed down enough to let them pour and what came out was just great. A nice and hazy, thick dark brown poured into the glass leaving a good two inches or so of tan colored head on top. This rested nicely down and laid on top to form a good half inch or so that lasted until the end. Smell was nice and richly spiced with an evident dry hopping to it. Lots of very fresh pine and cinnamon aromas coming off of it. This translated perfectly over to the taste where a nice rich brown ale was welcomed and mixed with a generous amount of hoppiness. A great creamy and smooth feel was nice and full bodied and never let you down on the carbonation. An almost chewy consistency could be detected as well. I wished I could have had more, but this was a one pint per man night so I loved every last sip. Overall this was really fantastic. It was very rich and fresh tasting and just had a tremendously good texture and feel to it. I could have made this one all night, but alas I had to go home. It was great and I am glad I made it.

Taste is a dry maltiness, the same dark fruits as in the aroma, but more subdued, as well as plenty of bitterness. There is a light roasted flavor in the finish that works really well with the grapefruit citrus flavor of the Chinook hops.

After the foam settled down, the brew had a dark red appearance and a wonderful aroma of citrusy hops, pine and candyish malts. Taste was just as good and my fears of infection vanished. Grapefruity hops along with flavors of caramelly malts, juicy apricots and evergreen. Mouthfeel light to medium and quite smooth and silky in the palate.

The rest of the beer doesn't hold up its end, though. The aroma is slight, a shadowy Christmas aroma of spices, while smelling light and refreshing. The taste is a bit dry and watery, dominated by the hops, for a bitter finish that lasts and lasts and lasts...which makes it not the most pleasant drinking experience. I did not expect this IPAish finish. It is decently carbonated but feels thin, especially compared to what it looks like it should feel. Overall, it's OK, but I don't finish it wanting any more.

Some mineral twang mixes with grapefruit hop flavors as well, eventually giving way to a dark bready malt component. Acrid (but delicious) bitterness lingers for a long time in the sharp, dry aftertaste. Crisp and sharp mouthfeel overall; certainly much more brash than I'd expected. I just picked up a single tonight to give it a whirl, and I know I'll be picking up a six-pack or more before the year is through. This may be one of my new favorite winter seasonals.

The caramel malt really dominates the flavor overall. Medium bodied, soft creamy carbonation, leaves a bit of sweet coating on the throat.

This is a delicious ale; beautifully balanced with moderate bitterness and a trace of honey on the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly oily and creamy, just right for the various taste elements interwoven within this impressive offering. Although somewhat full bodied, the medium weight of this brew and the generally lean composition make for spirited and effortless consumption, with fresh hops never tiring the palate.

Flowery and piney hop smells are at the center of this brew. Theres a lot of competing hop smells in this one, backed with a grain and toasted malt. Its not quite a hop monster, but with a little more intensity it would subscribe to that description. The taste is balanced and semi-sweet. Malt and grain come out a little more in the mouth, with a earthy character. Hops still dominate, though, with a moderately long finish. Medium body, with moderate carbonation.

Maybe cause it's been about a month since I have had a ""good"" beer but this one is real nice.sweet, smooth and musky up front with a hint of some spiced organics.

The mouthfeel is chewy but not overwhelming with moderate carbonation that keeps things crisp and the finish is lingering and bitter. Drinkability is also pretty good.

Well balanced, with a medium/full body and a creamy smooth mouthfeel.

For the taste, sweet and sour hops come first, then a doughy malt flavor appears when held in the mouth with a fluffy carbonation, then it finishes dry and almost piney. The mouth feel is a little thin, but it works well with the flavor. This is a really tasty beer thats fun to drink, but I kept thinking of ginger snaps and sugar cookies while I was drinking it.

Otherwise the beer was a nice red and appearance was OK. The aroma was fairly heavy in caramel with some hoppy notes as well, a spicy almost cinnamon kind of hoppiness. The flavor was great - it has a hard, robust maltiness that is balanced and complimented by the hops.

The mahogany, amber colors, carbonation, and head criteria are consistent. To the nose, the hops still jump out with spruce-like, floral aromas. Flavors are high in the amber malts, spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnemon), nuts (almonds and walnuts), and hops (citrus, pine-ey, ginger-ey). Still a full, round mouthfeel; leaving mild drying and alcohol sweetness behind as the beer disipates. I beleive that the hops had subsided a bit leaving the beer more nutty, malty, and smoother.

The aroma was like most rogue beers, nice and crisp northwestern hops but this also had a honey-like sweetness too, which didnt prepare me for the taste- the taste was absolutely black liccorice. This is something that I had never tasted before in such abundance. Sadly, I have always hated that taste, but I still say it tastes damn good because I know a lot of people like that taste, and I am impressed that they can make it so pronounced.

Malts are similarly smooth but muted in comparison to the hops, which are somewhat citrusy at first and then more evergreeny during the finish.

Flavor is tangy, almost biting upfront, morphing to a sweeter taste of light brown sugar and toffee and cinnamon as it rolls over the tongue, turning back to a bitter twinge of citrusy hops and clove in the finish, perhaps a little smoke.

The head is off-white and rolls up impressively a nice fingers width of head manages to retain and leaves fat clumps of lace on the glass. The nose on this beer is very nice, the malt is soft and subtle with tea-like aromas, overborne by the brash aroma of piney, citrussy (grapefruit) and apricot smelling hops. Up-front on the palate are the soft and caramelly malts, again the hints of tea-like flavor are present. The bitter character of this beer is middle of the road. The finish is dominated by pine-sap/floral hop flavors which are almost a bit perfumey in their bite. The mouthfeel is spot on, a tad velvety and smooth going down. This beer almost reminds me of a cross between Dead Guy Ale, and their American Amber Ale. A nice seasonal that I will be looking forward to trying again.","FormatKid","Jan 02, 2005"
3.15,-16,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Not bad but Rogue has others. As far as style, to me more like IPA/barley/winter-warmer. Pours a hazy orange/ruby with off white head. The smell is of pine and lemon zest. The malts are sublte and light, caramel detected. The taste is of citrus and floral. The hops are definetely strong in this one, not to over-the-top however. The malts kick in and round out this beer, Medium bodied and good for one bomber.","beertaster13","Dec 27, 2004"

Taste is a nicely balanced (at least from what I hear about all the different products by Rogue) mix of tasty hops and mildly nutty malts. Hops are diffenently emphasized here, but aren't overwhelming. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great as predicted. So far this is one of my least favorite beers from Rogue and it's still great.

This is the best Red I have ever had (I have reviewed 16). Deep brown/red color, fluffy off-shite head that fades to form a thick layer of nooks and crannies. Smells of grapefruit tinged hops, and slight carmel sweetness. I served it at cellar temp, so this stuff was bursting with flavor. Taste matches the citrusy/carmel of the smell, but adds to it nicely, making this beer as excellent as it is. My new definition of the style, and what I will judge all other reds against.","TastyTaste","Dec 23, 2004"

There is some malts in the mix which give off bits of caramel but they are clearly overwhelmed by the flavor and bitterness of the hops.

Taste was disappointing. Uncomfortably out of balance. Toasted, nutty malt up front but very, very subtle; so subtle, it's crushed by a monstrous bitterness that dries the mouth.

The lacing was decent to look at too. The aroma was very piney Rogue signature hops from the US Pacific Northwest and a roasty and caramel malt presence. The taste possessed a creamy honey like sweetness and a peppery resinous hoppyness. Neither overpowered the other but stood in a near perfect harmony. The mouthfeel was rich and full, and aftertaste was on the dry side.

Very similar looking to SNCA. Not a ton happening with the aroma. You can pick up the obvious hops, but not a lot more. The taste and mouthfeel are very satisfying. There is the ever-so-loved Rogue taste with a nice shot of bittering hops. There is a drying spice taste in the background, but I cannot exactly pinpoint it.

Some piney, nutty flavors are present as well, with a nice bitter finish. This beer is big, and the hops were unexpected for me. However, I love big hoppy beers, so this one no problem for me!

Taste begins with a toasted nutty malt sweetness followed by just a hint of smoked wood before bitter hop resins with notes of grapefruit rind and pine oil take over to dominate the tasting.

It pours a deep reddish amber and sports a light tan head that reduces quickly to a cap. The flavor profile is comparable to SN's Celebration although the hop bitterness seems more astringent and the mouthfeel a bit more thin in Santa's PRA, a bit of aging would take care of the former. I thought I detected a bit of diacetyl in the nose but if it's there, it is easily overwhelmed by the truckload of hops in each bottle. Yep, this brew is all pine, and to a lesser degree citrus, on the tastebuds. The barest hint of caramel breaks through a sea of hops to gasp for air but quickly sinks beneath the surface.","johnrobe","Jan 02, 2004"

The most noticable aroma was hops....strong resiny hops. Since I love super hoppy beers like 90 mintue, I found this to be very pleasant and promising on what was to come. Taste was hops and more hops...almost like an imperial IPA. Also present was roasty malts and some charcoal. The flavor of this brew was like a cross between an imperial IPA and a winter brew. Not a bad combo, but not quite all it could be. Still, a very tasty choice here. Mouthfeel was ok, with a medium body. I found it to be quite drinkable. Overall an interesting and tasty brew that tries to please hopheads and roasty-philes.","HiroProtagonist","Jan 01, 2004"

The scent was hoppy but also had a very detectable scent of yeast. The taste was great, over hopped just enough to give the beer that extra kick. Also had a great citrus overtone to the flavor. This one is not as dry hopped as some of the seasonals I've had, and it is a refreshing beer indeed.","Dmann","Dec 19, 2003"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"My kids got a kick out of seeing me come home with a beer with Santa on the label. It's billed as a variation on St. Rogue's Red and certainly tastes like it. They say double the hops. It's certainly hoppy, but it doesn't taste like double St.RR. After giving my olfactory senses more than enough time to give it a going-over, I kept smelling something that reminded me of adhesive tape. Somehow, it worked with the robust malty smell and the abundant hops. The hops don't bushwack the tastebuds and the malt is enough to keep things at least closed to balanced. This is good beer, but it didn't strike me as a Christmas beer in any way.","mickeymac","Dec 17, 2003"

Tons of sticky moth-holed sheets of lace. Smell has a terrific caramel sweet malty aroma with some grassy hop notes. Taste comes across completely different from what the smell gives way to. A dry mild roasty feel and flavor lays immediately across the palate dropping notes of burnt buttered toast and caramel drizzled biscuits. Hops are super dry and leafy with a pine wood dryness and quick dry wood bittering that fades into the finish leaving hints of caramel and cocoa. But overall, quite dry and woodish.

A fresh hoppy, fist full of buds aroma burst out. Sweet malt, berries and light wisps of warming alcohol play a solid supporting role. The dark roasted malt is a sweet biscuity delight. Sharp grapefruit bitterness, peppery spices and a bit of metallic bite makes way for a taste of berries and piney esters. Notes of toffee, bittersweet chocolate and alcohol provide a bit of balance to an otherwise wild and sharp-edged winter brew.

I thought that this would be a dark, spicy beer considering the name, but it wasn't. So I went on the site to see that it was an amber, now the flavor and color makes a little more sense. It looks really nice, with a ruby color and a huge tan head that was frothy. The taste left me to wonder if this really was an amber. It was definitely good but more pale ale style to me. Once again Rogue's hops are quite noticeable. Slight amber taste in the beginning but the hops take over midway through and last for the duration. Great balance and more malts come in and out the longer I drink this but it's definitely hop dominant. The mouthfeel was a little too sharp for my liking and that brought the drinkability down a bit too.

I was smelling hops as soon as I popped the top, without it anywhere near my nose. Enormous citrus aroma just floods the nose. Taste opens with a solid malt base, but is quickly engulfed by rush of hops. The hops are much more piney in the taste as contrasted with the aroma. Could use more malt balance, make this a fairer fight. Mouthfeel is full, but too hoppy to be considered smooth. In fact, at times it seems you almost have to come up for air from the hops.

Taste is not unlike biting into a pine tree (wasn't there an old guy on TV about 20 years ago who used to eat pine trees in a commercial?), though it's slightly offset (I wouldn't say balanced, because that would be lying) by a malty sweetness.

Hop flavor is more citrusy than piney in nature. Light to medium bodied with a typically smooth, dextrinous mouthfeel aided copious use of speciality malts.

I would be willing to try it again, because Rogue puts out quality products and it's unusual for a beer to be nasty made by them. Sorry.","JISurfer","Dec 24, 2002"
3.99,6.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Sludgy brown with fuzzy head. Aroma of big caramel and chocolate malts with intense bitter hop. This is a big malty beer upfront, with a strong chocolate element and roasty malts reminiscent of a chewy doppelbock. That however is blown away by huge hops, with grapefruit and pine flavors. There's nothing especially Christmasy about this beer except for a tree-like element in the hops and the general extreme-ness which fits in with many winter brews. It's out there. The hops turned me off at first but the beer grew on me as it warmed. A nice, once-a-year treat. Now with this out of the way I can move on to my much anticipated bottle of Samichlaus. Ho ho ho.","Thrasher","Dec 24, 2002"
4.37,16.5,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"Dark garnet/ rich,ruby color, big, creamy head. Aroma: hoppy, spicy, dazzling array of fruits, grapes, cherries. Sits wonderfully in the mouth. Tangy, sour taste. Bitter finish. It's described by Rogue as having a ""hoppy, sprucy finish", and I obviously blinked on the spruce. I like it very well, but, although you can call me a hophead, I wasn't expecting quite so much hops in a brew of this style. Although, to be fair, the ""winter beer"" style is increasingly a broad one. In sum, I thank Santa for sharing!","feloniousmonk","Dec 22, 2002"

3.23,-13.9,4.5,4,3,2,3,"Rogue's 2002 x-mas offering pours a wonderful chestnut orange with a tan head. The aroma is a complex blend of malt and spice followed by notes of apricot and hops. Poured into a tulip glass I could sniff this all night long. The taste starts with a nice crisp carmel malt warmth and a stinging hop bite. The finish is very very very dry with a slight hop bitterness that lingers for a moment. The after taste is a very faint note of hop spiciness. The mouthfeel starts very bold and drops like a rock into complete nothingness. I feel very disapointed by this ale. Its aroma and appearance are so wonderful. The taste starts wonderful also but then it just disappears into a watery hop flavored aftertaste. Everything about this product screams wonderful except the lasting pleasure of an aftertaste. This ale makes me thirsty instead of quenching my thirst. IMHO","purplehops","Dec 12, 2002"
4.63,23.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"2002 release. A deep, thick, syrupy amber brew, with a very large off-white head that stays quite well. A good amount of lace is left behind as it is consumed. Thick, rich malty aroma with many types of hops mixed in. Citrus and pine are the most noticeable products of the hops, with leafy and earthy tones directly beneath. A bit fruity as well. Wonderfully complex hop character in the flavor profile! Leafy and earthy hops are noticeable at first, rushing in with the big malt character, which is sweet, a bit roasted, and slightly bready, combining well with those hops. Rind-like bitterness follows closely behind. Pine and citrus are also present, but subtlely. Crisp and sweet at the same time. More crisp in the finish, though. This hop and malt combination makes for a great and pleasing mouthfeel. Spicy hop character is abound, and stays in the aftertaste. Well, I should have expected a lot more from this beer, I'm quite impressed! I love it! Extremely tasty in that earthy way. Not your typical winter beer, but it does warm you, and the hops provide spiciness where spices would be in other winter beers. I'd really love to have this beer available to me year-round. I might just stock up so I can keep it around for a while. Another winter must-try!","hyuga","Dec 09, 2002"

The aroma is very malty with a hint of fruitiness. The dominate taste is grapefruit. It finishes dry. This is a very different beer for a winter. I enjoyed the taste of this one more than the dead guy ale. A very taste beer.","Amdahl","Dec 09, 2002"
3.91,4.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a clear, deep, dark garnet color with a light tan head. Aroma consists of hops, caramel and a touch of maple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Initial mild hop front to it. Smooth, yet, bitter hop & fruit dry finish. There's also a bit of pine or spruce that lingers toward the end. Flavor seems more like an IPA than a traditional red ale due to the intense amount of hops in this one. A tasty winter seasonal offering for those who like intensely hop-flavored beers. I wouldn't mind stocking up on a few of these.","Winter","Dec 07, 2002"

4.35,16,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Golden amber with a thin, but lacy head. Aroma is a beautiful combination of spice, grapefruit, and pine... with a touch of breadlike malt. Flavor is straight on with the nose... some sweetness balances the hop bitterness, but there is an ample amount of bitterness... also some pine and citrus. Medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. This is quite unique, and since it's brewed as a winter warmer, I can't really dock it for not being like other Amber Ales. Very good stuff!","zerk","Nov 28, 2002"
3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The first Rogue brew that I have tried. Santa's Private Reserve is a very red ale, and extremly hoppy (not that that is a bad thing!).

4.32,15.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Probably the most aggressive ""red ale"" I've tried, Santa's Private Reserve is a typical Rogue brew. Big on hops in both the nose and taste with a variety of malts backing them up along the way. The finish is dry and quite bitter, making for a nice change-up on the traditional amber/red ale style. Looks great in the glass with a well-retaining head, too. A delightful wintertime brew if you're into hops. If not I'd suggest you leave this one on the shelf. Personally, I'll imbibe again.","Jon","Nov 26, 2002"

Nose is citrus, hop floral, malt under tones and quite a Sniffer. Front is sweet malt, the top slender, the finish is strikingly hop spicy, pleasantly acidic, droughty aftertaste. Good drinkable beer for the Hop Heads in the audience, and well worth a sample. Ranks #361 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Gusler","Nov 26, 2002"

Piney/gently citrusy and lightly fruity. The body is medium with a fine & median carbonation. The flavor starts softly fruity and lightly nutty. A nicely sweet caramel maltiness comes through before becoming engulfed in resiny hop flavor and bitterness. And yet, the bitterness never really builds on the palate. Extremely well balanced for such a boldly hopped beer! It finishes quite dry with just some residual maltiness and a bold lingering bitterness. This beer reminded me of their St. Rogue Red but with more hop character. Very nice. An excellent choice for the hop lovers among us!","NeroFiddled","Nov 16, 2002"
4.25,13.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Clear cinnamon brown/red with a nice rocky ochre-colored head.  Spicy aroma, some cardamon and some sharp clove blends in with malt sweetness.  Interesting, a solid but diminished malt, tinged with maple (but backed by good body) runs hand-in-hand with a decided hop backbone...like a fight between small but aggressive (hops) and big and lazy (malt).  Both are there throughout the sip.  I liked the approach to balance and throw another thumbs up to Rogue and their good to excellent products.","ADR","Nov 14, 2002"

The smell is strong of piney tones, different but interesting.  A sugary-sweet malt that is thinned and then overtaken by the very striking, piney hops.  starts with the sweet malt and quickly slides into sharp hops.  The mouth is medium, but scored with sharp, biting carbonation and hops.  This brew is not to be taken lightly.  This is a solid red Rogue, with double the hops.
