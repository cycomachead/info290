But so far as I'm concerned this hearty combination of sweet malt and multifaceted hops is a gustatory masterpiece. The fact that it's so irresistibly drinkable even at 8% alcohol tells you something about just how much flavour it offers. Here's hoping this fall release is eternal.","biegaman","Jan 09, 2015"

The taste was a bit more mellow than I thought it would be considering the smell but still very nice. The taste had toasted malts with some hops, and then a bit of burn on the end. I liked it quite a lot.","WhiteHillsStore","Jan 02, 2015"

Aroma is citrusy with sweet caramel malts, and a tiny bit of pine. Reminds me of a very subtle barleywine, minus the booziness. Not quite what you'd expect from a Red. Taste is a little subdued....very lightly toasted malts, with some sweet caramel. A bit of pine. As it warms, the sweet caramel comes through a bit more, and bitterness starts to linger on the tongue. This one is thin, but starts to get a sticky resinous as it warms. Pretty easy to put down for a 8%er. Overall one of the more tasty red ales you'll find.","majorbase2","Oct 23, 2014"

Taste is a strong caramel malt and toffee flavor, yeast with a good dose of earthy hops for balance on the end. A medium body, smooth mouth feel with good carbonation. The finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity, some toffee notes and earthy hops bitterness. This brew goes down smooth considering the bitterness and alcohol.

Upfront bitterness on the nose, some crisp, malty notes, but rather light aroma overall. This might be the weakest area of this excellent brew. The flavor made up for the weak nose... delicious malt presence with a bit of a bite (I would swear there was bit of rye in this), and a nice, balanced bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, with a nice, clean finish. Crisp and refreshing overall. My new favorite fall beer, different. Get some, get some now, and get some fresh.","Mikus","Sep 13, 2014"

Flavor follows suit with the flavor but hits heavier in both the malts and hops. Moderate bitterness to this thing but the sweetness from the malts keep the hops in check. A fuller mouthfeel. Overall, a very solid beer from GL here. Glad I went with the 4 pack over just a single, though not sure I can drink more than one of these in a night.","denver10","Sep 06, 2014"

Aroma of sweet fruits, dirt, grass, caramel malts. Flavor follows with a grassy fruit flavor, massive malt bill, just a tinge of earthy hops, with a lingering bready malt on the palate. Slick mouthfeel, lowish carbonation. Very crisp pleasant finish, very easy drinking. Cannot believe this is 8%. Nothing especially complex in the flavors here, just a nicely crafted brew.

It's not often that a beer can be this complex and incredibly smooth at the same time but this fit the bill and on its own, paired with spicy foods, or as a dessert, this would be a great choice. It never warmed me but it never felt weak either and it's not often I find an offering that combines chocolate and fruit flavors so well, without being dark and powerful.

Very well balanced with a medium mouthfeel that is also slick. Well carbonated. This is an example of how to properly hop a beer. The hop flavor is pronounced but without a harsh bitterness against a full caramel background. The taste lingers of fresh hop resin. Increase the malt bill a bit and this becomes a Gold Medal exceptional ale. While medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel, the finish is crisp from the carbonation leaving you with a slightly sweet aftertaste over a noble hop bitterness with a touch of smoke.","tillmac62","Oct 10, 2013"

They, too, were sweeter, giving an ultimate impression of a sweeter beer, all around, to the drinker. The feel is really what did it for us.

Pours crystal clear reddish orange color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Thick foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, mango, pine, herbal, orange zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, and floral. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, pine, caramel, orange zest, pineapple, toast, floral, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, toast, floral, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance as well. Slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale. Great hop flavor complexity and malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Sep 17, 2012"
4.08,0,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into a pint glass. Nice red amber in color with maybe a one finger head and little lacing. This beer is very malt forward which is about the only thing I pick up in the smell and it dominates in the taste. Very well balanced in flavor and besides the malt I get the hops, some toffee, and sweet tart fruitiness. It comes off very smooth at first but has a bitter dry aftertaste that is non-offensive. My overall opinion is that it is a really good beer but it lacks distinctiveness and for a seasonal I was expecting it to be a bit more bold all around. Because of this I can't say it justifies the higher price of it, which was close to $12 for a 4pk.

3.75,-8.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: I love the beer but think that it could be improved probably without a ton of effort. I have to assume that this beer was meant to taste this way but the bitterness is just off in this beer. It is a clean beer until it was overbittered. Take away the astringency and the pungent bitterness and this is a great beer.

4.35,6.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Nosferatu is a unique beer. I haven't encountered a beer that so demonstrably integrates both malt and hop flavor. It's a beer in conflict...an IPA blended up with a Scotch Ale/Octoberfest hybrid. And it's delicious. It leans a little on the boozy side and I'm not sure I would want more than one or two of these at a time, but there won't be another Fall where I don't think of this beer. Perfectly matched to the season in which it is released, Nosferatu is an outstanding Strong Ale.","siege06nd","Nov 09, 2011"

I liked the wide variation of hop flavors present, especially with more prominent grass, floral, and tropical notes happening. This really was a hop story for me, honestly, which is not what I was expecting (or remembered from last year). Malt was simple but did the job more than well enough. This was a great beer, looking forward to next year’s already!","fmccormi","Nov 05, 2011"

Also a layer of peppery yeast and earthy, resinous hops. The hops shine through immediately, similar to the nose. Not overwhelming but balanced out with the wave of rich caramel, biscuit malts come through. Some of the yeast character comes out for the finish but I am mainly tasting rich, toasty, bready malts and piney bitter hops. Dry finish makes me want to keep quenching my thirst.","DrinkingDrake","Nov 02, 2011"

On the nose I get a hoppy upfont bouquet with piney and earth tones followed by a malt nose of sweet caramel malts, a little fruity too. Palette is as the nose: a good dose of hops upfont similar to the nose and equal amounts of maltiness with a hint of fruits in the finish. A well balanced ale. The feel is medium with a dry bitter finish. A good beer be it a red or old, one that I'm sure I'll be drinking again.","micromaniac129","Oct 29, 2011"
3.88,-4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer pours a medium bodied dark amber in color with a one finger off white head. The aromas are pretty traditional for an imperial amber. You get a lot of malts, light cherry, more malt, maybe some oak. It's solid. The flavors too of a complex malt bill. It's just hard to pick apart it's sweetness, which is smooth and not over the top. It drinks medium in body and has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It's deceiving really. You don't get anywhere near 8.0%. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice imperial amber. It is what it is.","aasher","Oct 28, 2011"

Suprising that the taste leads with an almost Scotch Ale like malt profile... toasty, nutty and caramely... before becoming a carrier of a significant amount of American hops... grassy, piney and citrusy. Medium bodied, bright carbonation, could use a touch more heft. A solid all around showcase of solid malting and hopping.","rfgetz","Oct 24, 2011"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer, for some reason I was pretty sure that this beer was going to be heavy on the spices and possibly a pumpkin beer, but instead I was given a pretty hoppy and biscuity Imperial Red Ale, this was unexpected but I ended up liking it so it was a good surprise. The high amount of bitterness doesn't make it that drinkable so I don't think I would have more then one of these in a sitting. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, I haven't had the combo of biscuit malts and floral hops before and I thought it was different and went well together. There wasn't anything that I didn't like but I thought that the bitterness could be toned down a little to enhance the drinkability and enjoyment. I might get a bottle of this when it is released next year but a four pack may be too much for me to handle. I recommend giving this beer a try it's pretty unique, and if hops are your thing I am sure you will dig it. This looks like another good beer from Great Lakes Brewing Company, not the most mind blowing beer, but all in all a good change of pace.  After having this beer more than a few times, I had to bump it up to a solid 4, all aspects are equally good and it stands out as a nice Fall seasonal, I buy a four pack every year.","StoutHunter","Sep 26, 2011"

Almost like a hoppy rum cake (sounds weird, but its good, I'm not doing it justice). Taste reminds me of an American Barleywine. Sweet, but not cloying or dry, with an assertive, but not overwhelming, hop profile. Sticky, oily hops mixed with a raisin and caramel background. Not boozy though, not surprisingly, and somewhat spicy. Feels lighter than a barleywine, though still somewhat viscous. Not that highly carbonated, but not flat. I liked this brew a good deal, so much so that my notes weren't taken as well this time because I was too busy just enjoying the beer. Definitely a good thing.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, and caramel hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The aroma on this one was pretty good if I'm honest. The flavor however was decent at best. Really wish some of the sweet alcohol from the aroma would have carried over into the flavor. However, the sweetness aspect was pretty big on the flavor though.

Smooth malty body, big kiss of sweetness to start but then the malt rails in hard with a pleasing toasted graini- ness, which stays. Some rounded dark caramel adds to the sweetness, as does the dark, fruity alcohol. Hops may not beat this beer down with bitterness, but the oily resin flavor keeps things in check.

Mouthfeel is rich, creamy-smooth, fuller than medium, lasting bitter astringency, wet and biting finish. A stand-up American Strong Ale that seems better suited as a winter release rather than a fall seasonal.

The flavor starts with notes of grapefruit, pine, and grass. The malt then adds its contribution of caramel and a little toastiness. Finishes dry and boozy.

The taste goes in a slightly different direction, with notes of grapefruit, light caramel, heavy pine sap, and cedar. The body is a solid medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a thickly watery (or watery thick) feel. Overall, I gotta say I wasn't enthralled with this brew, but it's not all that horrible either.

There are some citrusy hop aromas most similar to orange zest, but that's not nearly as strong as the burnt notes. The flavor is strongly of burnt biscuit. A slight malty flavor comes in on the back end to try and rectify the damage done, but it is too late. The burnt biscuit flavor is really off putting to the point where I truly don't like this beer. The mixing of the hop flavor with it makes it seem like someone lit hops on fire before putting them in this brew. The good thing is the bitterness doesn't translate too badly on the mouthfeel, but it is still there to a point I don't care for, despite the smooth nature of the drink. This beer is all sorts of intense, that I really don't care to go into. It's harsh in a number of ways and honestly some might enjoy drinking it, but I could go either way.

Head retention itself was great, the lacing however did not maintain itself, but that doesn't really matter to me. Really strong citrus hops aromas with a rich malty background. I got some grapefruit coming through but balanced out with the malts, smelled fantastic. After a couple sips I couldn't help but think about just how balanced this beer is. While you get plenty of hops at first, they are never overbearing or offensive. The wet and sticky hop goodness is quickly followed by a slight sweetness and malt flavors. Very well carbonated but it still coats the tongue with it's flavors and character, after a while you get a little bit of alcohol warmth going down. Deceptively drinkable and delicious!

The hops were absent in the nose, but they show up with lots of bitterness on the palate. The toasted malt gives decent balance, but that bitter hop bite lingers and overpowers for the most part.

Medium-bodied, there's more foaminess than expected during the mouth entry, after that the carbonation settles down. While very much in balance, the hops come out ahead by a good bit, grains, pine, pressed flowers and an herbaceous bite evident throughout, especially at the end. That said, the strongest element is the white grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus. Milk chocolate, toffee, honey and clove drift in and out, never truly making it taste sweet at any given moment. Blend of apple, pear, peach, banana, cherry fruit, yet, with minimal sweetness. It's an unusual beer which certainly holds your attention.","farrago","Jan 18, 2010"

The flavor jumps out with a curious herbal hop with evergreen and malty evergreen with licorice hilights. But it's mostly a beautiful blend of herbal hops, roasted nuts and peaty malt. Delicious, one of the better stock ales I've had and this is arguably one of my very favorite styles. It's reasonably carbonated, mid-bodied and drinkable enough considering the ABV. Great stuff.","Durge","Dec 29, 2009"
3.65,-10.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A fast pour resulted in a big creamy head that dissipates into some nice lacing. The color is dark amber, and the carbonation is nice and even throughout the beer. The main scent is a big, strong malt with some nice fruity smell underneath. It reminded me of dried apricots. The fruit flavor explodes in your mouth and, according to my wife, is almost too much if you don't know it's coming. Personally, I thought it was a nice treat. The sweetness causes the drinkability to be a little lower then normal, but it packs a punch so you probably shouldn't sit and slam them all day anyway.","billyzoom666","Dec 20, 2009"

The flavor starts off similar to a bold IPA but finishes more subtlety with smooth malt. The mouthfeel is great and drinkability high with no noticeable presence of alcohol.

Anyway, it pours a dark rosy color, with a little less than a finger of white heading. The head does seem to stick around for a while too. In the nose I get some maple syrup, roasted grains, toast and honey. Flavor has many of the components of the smell, however there is a more bitter hop taste going on here that almost comes across as burnt. The texture of this beer is medium, but rich in complexity. Although this is an older bottle, (best enjoyed by November of last year) it seems to have stood the test of time pretty well. Still, I would love to try a fresh bottle, and compare.

3.9,-4.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"I picked this up last month but noticed today the best before date 11/27/08 on opening. Higher ABV usually means longer storage capability, so I wasn't too worried about that. Red with a tan head, quickly receded to a thin wispy veil that covered most of the surface. The carbonation appeared quite low but a swirl quickly regenerated head and that was for the duration of the glass, impressive. Thin ring and minimal lace, but for the swirl. Earthy smell reeks of alcohol, corn mash, barley, caramel. Hops are yet apparent, high bitterness with a dryness, boozy but balanced. Warmth is unmistakable and the stronger alcohol puts me off a bit but behind that is a well balanced hop-malt bill that makes it all work rather well. This one was five months overdue, according to the brewery label, I'd love to try it again fresh. Also a pretty cool label, just don't store these near garlic.","ThatWineGuy","Apr 19, 2009"

A little raisiny but it also smells like a sewer. Maybe the taste will clear this up. Strong on the alcohol at first with a good raisin character. Finishes very dry with a slight lingering hop bitterness and acidity from the alcohol. Maybe some honey or candy sugar in the front too. Has some Belgian qualities to it.. but to me that just mean it tastes a little like windex. Exceptionally smooth. By now the head has given way to the alcohol. I'd say this beer turned me off at first but I grew to like it quickly. An interesting and daring take on an American Strong Ale.

Good hearty aroma, wine-like sharpness with a generous helping of hops. Pour is a medium dark ruby red with some amber tones, minimal head and little lacing. Due to the higher abv I can't complain too much about how this looks. Mouthfeel is powerful and unbelievably clean it hits you then melts away. Hops-a-plenty round out the high maltiness creating a nice sipper of a brew. Bitter and citrusy at first you think this doesn't work but as you go forward it all melds too easily.

The taste is a wonderful balance of brown sugar, caramel malts and pine hops that quickly give way to a sweet brown sugar finish, but then mysteriously return at the back of the tongue a few seconds later.

The hop character is strong and it gives it a lively spark while the sweet caramel malt puts a nice smooth spin on it.

Lots of lacing. Looks great. Nose is alcohol, candy, light sweet malt, cranberries. Nice strong aromas coming off of this one. Flavor is similarly interesting and powerful. Lots of grapes and crazy fruits of all varieties, light drying hops, and a touch of alcohol. Solid flavor. Body is full and creamy with perfect carbonation and a nice long aftertaste. This one is a really excellent beer, I'm looking forward to finishing my four-pack.","soupyman10","Sep 22, 2007"
4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark ruby color with a nice amount of foam which takes its time to settle down, also has some good lacing. Hop aromas of grapefruit, citrus and pine are well represented as well as some dark fruits and sweet cherries. Some caramel and toasted malts support the hoppy profile to make a nice salad of citrus, dark fruits, and biscuit and caramel malts. Taste is similar to the aroma, which is good. I get some dark and ripe fruits with some sweet and malt finish. Hop bite is more subtle than I expected from the aroma. Mouthfeel is just a tad on the thin side but the carbonation is very good and helps to hide the alcohol wickedly well.","seaoflament","Sep 17, 2007"

It tastes very sweet as well. Lots of rich maltiness. Almost syrupy. It does finish with a nice bitterness though, which dries the palate a bit. Some alcohol is noticable.

3.76,-7.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Cellared for 6 months. Pours a pale orange-maroon with bronze highlights and terrific clarity. Three finger beige head holds very well leaving thick blotches of lacing. Deeply malty nose; crystal malt, dextrin, dark fruit notes and a background Chinnok and Cascade aroma. Heavy caramel and dextrin taste upfront, followed by a hint of peat and strong ripe fruit flavor like plum or dates. The aftertaste balances out this robust malt with an equally boisterous hop bitterness, but the hop flavor/aroma seems to have faded and retains only a shadow of citrus/grapefruit finesse. While this beer continues to evolve and hold up well-past it's expiration date, in my opinion this is best consumed fresh. The body is med-full and the carbonation is moderate, but somehow the mouthfeel remains very fluid and not at all viscous. Finishes with ample residual toasted malt/fruit complexity and an even level of bitterness - but lack-luster hop aroma/flavor. I will probably review this fresh in the future.","PBRstreetgang","Mar 27, 2007"

The first few times I've had it, it had a great hop presence, a nice malty backbone, and a bit of rye flavore. However, this time, it was much less hoppy and the malt and alcohol seemed to have taken a more dominant position. It was still good, but not as good as the first few trials. When both are fresh, I slightly prefer Founder's Red's Rye (which tastes quite similar to me), but to me, this beer seems to age a bit better (still rather have it fresh though).

Some strings of small bubble chains pouring through the glass and a nice clingy lace made a good starting impression on this one. Smell started off with some bread and yeast tones, but soon warmed to reveal a nice hop presence. Grapefruit and orange. Very sweet and well balanced. The taste started off very hoppy, Grapefruit, Pineapple, fresh tasting. Fely a bit slick when sipping, not watered down at all though. A slight hint of alcohol, but not bad, just enough to let you know it was there. The sweetness and bitter/sour were very well balanced off of each other, and in the malts vs hops war, there was no definitive winner in this one.

It was nicely carbonated and felt OK in the mouth, but overall something had me weirded out to the point that I was disappointed and didn't really see myself going back to it, unless it was to make sure that being past the freshness date didn't ruin it.

Big juicy pine sap juice flavor at first, with an unmistakeable alcoholic sharpness all around the palate. This yields to a surprisingly mellow grapefruit acidity and an earthy mineral twang at the finish. Slight alcohol slickness in the mouthfeel, dry tannic finish that lingers as a sticky bittersweet malt character. A very flavorful strong ale, not nearly as rough around the edges as some of its West Coast counterparts, yet still bearing many family resemblances -- just a bit more ""refined," perhaps.

It starts with a hoppy bitterness and ends with a malty sweetness, and the aftertaste lingers a long time. It tastes like citrusy hops, spicy flavors, pepper, and raisins.

Smell is bread, alcohol, cherries, and zest. The taste starts with a high octane hit of malts then changes character completely to finish with a bitter hop bite. If these flavors were blended a bit more it would improve things, as I am sure will happen with age. The mouthfeel is medium with the carbonic bite preventing it from feeling full.

This brew is an example of flavor balance that is nearly perfected. I say nearly because at odd times throughout the glass, the alcohol steps out from behind the flavor curtain to proclaim its presence and intentions. I can handle it, but I wish the delicious malt and hop harmony were not thrown into temporary dischord by the alcohol flashes that pop up intermittently. Hey, it's an 8% concoction I know, but we have to have goals for continuous improvement. Other brews have succeeded in completely veiling their alcohol contents ( some at higher abv's ) and I just wish the same for this otherwise extraordinary brew.

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Served into a tulip glass, Nosferatu pours a hazy orange body with a one inch beige head. Good head retention and some island chain lacing. Lots of active carbonation on view in the glass. Aroma has toffee and caramel for the malt profile, citrusy hops with a pine accent for the hops. Hops also lend a grassy and herbal note. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, nicely carbonated, with a mild bite of alcohol. Taste features a bigtime malt influence of toffee and caramel. The hops are quite assertive, as well, more pine cone than citrus, with some grassiness for good measure. Some honey drenched apple and pear flavors are noted in the middle, and the malt veers toward buttered bread with toffee toward the finish. Pine resin adds a bitterness to the finish, and the aftertaste winds up smooth and evenly balanced. Alcohol is well concealed inside the assertive hops and malts. Lots going on in this one. Some barleywine and double IPA character are present. Very nicely constructed, and one that I would have again. Thanks to brewedlyhooked for the bottle.","merlin48","Mar 24, 2005"

4.33,6.1,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Copper colored with a fat foamy head of off-white meringue. Aroma is a combination of sweet biscuity malt and citrusy hops, neither flavor overpowering the other. Also some sweet fruits and candy, and I do believe some alcohol rising up to the nose as well. Flavor is also well-balanced - many flavors, all a bit understated but definitely making their presence known, and all playing off and with each other very well to create a well-rounded and interesting beer. There's malt, citrusy hops with some piney accents, sweet pear, ripe apple, butterscotch, and caramel. Every sip is a great mix of all of these flavors dancing around the mouth. This one's got some power, but it's highly drinkable because of the interesting flavors.","far333","Mar 06, 2005"
4.47,9.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"pours out a copper color with a dense creamy layer of foam that slowly subsides. Smell is a balance of malty sweet caramel and citrusy hops. One of the most appealing smells ever. Taste is initally bitter, yet a massive sweetness backs it up. This stuff tastes like a pale ale on steroids with sugar dumped into it. Delicious. The hops taste slightly piney and citrusy. I wish I could try this stuff fresh as this bottle is past its prime date, I am sure the flavor and aroma are that much better out of a fresh keg. Drink this stuff on the warmer side, the flavors come out much more, especially the caramel. I am really jealous of you people who live near this brewery, it is without a doubt one of the best in the country.","bnuttz","Feb 16, 2005"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"I had this in the bottle a couple of times but also on-tap last night at Logan's Alley. It pours a brilliant, shiny auburn red color, not much head but a thin white layer across the top. Smell is really hoppy with some alcohol notes and maybe some caramelly undertones. Taste has more hop bitterness but its not quite the punch of hops I get in the aroma which suggests its dry-hopped. The alcohol, however, is much stronger in taste then it was in the nose. There's also a fruity estery flavor in the mix with the alcohol. The sweetness comes from a caramel/butterscotch maltiness. Honey seems to appear towards the finish, which is drawn out. This is a good beer, nothing less nothing more, maybe with time it will improve.","granger10","Dec 01, 2004"

The smell sorta seems malty at first, but there's also a good amount of hops in there as well. The taste has just that little bit of maltiness, but holy shit watch out for the hops! Really citrusy hops, with lots of alpha acid bitterness on the finish. Could be Arrogant Bastard's twin brother, just with a little less grapefruit. The body is thick and heavy, coating the mouth well. The drinkability is great for a beer of this magnitude. Great stuff.","SheepNutz","Nov 15, 2004"

Hints brown-sugar crusted fruit appear and biscuit settle in, until a substantial wave of pine needles and spicy hops take over and carry into the finish. Finish is warming and bitter, with lingering sticky sweetness. Full-bodied and chewy, but not too thick. I'm a big fan of this style and this example doesn't let me down in the least. Another great Great Lakes beer.","alexgash","Nov 14, 2004"
4.6,12.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Interesting label on this beer with a picture good old Nosferatu looking in desperate need of some beer. This poured out with a rich copper body with about three fingers worth of off white head slowly forming. The head stayed are for a bit as it laced the glass in rings of foam. Aroma was a mix of earthy hop and equal part sweet caramel malt with a touch of alcohol in the background to complete it. Very tasty smelling beer overall that had a good strong aroma. Taste starts off with a malty sweetness with a touch of molasses and a bit of earthiness to it. This finishes with a bitter after taste that has a lingering warmth to it. Mouthfeel is just about full with a syrupy sticky feel to it. Drinkability is damn good as this has enough hops that they add to the taste and keep this from being overly sweet. One I would definitely make a regular if it was around here. Thanks again to garthwaite for another awesome beer.","meathookjones","Nov 10, 2004"

Giant hop nose, but not overbearing chilled out smoothly by sweet malts. The taste is outstanding. Generous hop fangs suck all other flavors out of the mouth (Over the top?). Malt sweetness finishes off the selection gently with a decent caramel flavoring. An alcohol finish warms the soul, not huge but nicely placed. Mouthfeel is heavy and slick leaving residual malt around for memories. Loved this and have no problem ordering a few more.","Ahhdball","Oct 18, 2004"
4.08,0,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Nosferatu: an extremely mellow extreme ale? Perhaps. Copper penny brownish-red brew with a good dosage of piney hop aromas with a smattering of sweet maple syrup. Straightforward. A kind of obvious beer, the flavor is similarly parcelled out neatly into two compartments: a malty chunk full of caramel, syrupy, sweet flavors and a hoppy chunk oozing with pine bitterness. This is in many respects absurdly hopped, but to their credit, they do a good job of maintaining a sense of balance. A lot of the potential nuance in this may be lost, but I doubt they were going for that anyhow. A fine example of a strong, hoppy ale maintaining some drinkable, balanced character. Not as thick and full bodied as some others in the style, and that lends to a sort of crispness that this style requires to stay drinkable. Better than some of its more aggressive brothers.","marburg","Oct 13, 2004"

Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of yeast and maybe some hops, crisp and clean to the senses, start is sweet and rich in malt, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to medium in acidity, the hops potent in their spiciness, also a hint of alcohol bitterness in the dry long lasting aftertaste, a belly warmer and a very nice beer for a fall afternoon when the works day is done.","Gusler","Oct 06, 2004"

4,-2,4,4,4,4,4,"Appearance: Ruby caramel hue with a nice sized off white vanilla beige head leaves full webbed lacing blotches around my glass. Aroma: Strong pine presence with a bready mild malt sweetness touches of caramel and nuts but more stand outish is the alcohol presence. Taste: A dominant piney hop flavor flows throughout this becoming a bit one dimensional at times and overbearing on the palate seems very concentrated and not as balanced as some of the prior batches I've tasted of this big brew. There is still a spiciness beneath the hop flavor along with a tone of syrupy rich caramel malts with alcohol backing all of this that's going on. Mouthfeel: Medium to full body range doesn't sit heavy on the stomach but the flavor would probably become somewhat abrasive after multiple bottles of this brew. Slight syrup and touch of an oily quality about it from the hops 85 IBUs, definitely the bigger brother of the Burning River. Drinkability: Nice treat definitely an old ale in my eyes, when is Great Lakes going to start bottle conditioning their brews b/c this one was released in September and the bottle says it only supposed to be best by November 20, 2004 I'm sure it will last a bit longer with the alcohol and massive dose of hops it has.","WVbeergeek","Oct 02, 2004"

The head disappeared quickly than I would have hoped, not leaving much lace on the glass. Smells like a hop bomb, slightly citrusy and grassy, with a rich malt nose as well. Despite the hop dominance in the nose, this is a very balanced beer. Strong carmel malt which is very rich at first, followed by a dry grassy finish. Bitterness is high, but not overpowering. Medium to full body with a low amount of carbonation, combined with what I would call stickyness. Overall, another great beer by GLBC. Very balanced and tasty.

A wonder aroma to it, with elements of pine, citrus, and a candy sweetness of a malt background. The flavor was of malt, hops, with some caramel elements with a hint of the alcohol present.

The flavor is instantaneously, simultaneously sweet and bitter, with malt sweetness up front being crowded by a piney resinous bite. More citrus flavors are revealed in the mid, along with a decent caramel note. Nice strong bitterness on the finish cleans the malt away fairly well. Mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy, but not to the point that it makes drinking the beer laborious. On the contrary, drinking this beer is so easy that a couple will disappear quickly. The combination of intense sweetness and hard-hitting hop bitterness is a true joy. Brian and the crew at GLBC should make this more often.","aaronh","Dec 30, 2003"

It came to me a lovely dark amber, and I could smell the hops wafting over all the other enticing aromas at the table (there was an Edmund Fitzgerald Porter across the way and a Burning River Pale Ale next to me). I confess I didn't tarry too long on the aroma because I wanted to taste, and it did not disappoint. Like the Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA, I could almost believe there was grapefruit in this, but in a balanced way, as the subtle malt sweetness supported the bitternesswell.
