"Overall - Though a bit more tropical with the hop profile, this is quite remeniscent of Deschutes' Red Chair. This is a good thing. Quite delicious. I can only hope California starts getting Odell distribution."
"Great beers are when you are trying hard to find something wrong and you can't, while at the same time you might not be able to point out exactly what you like about but you do..this beer falls into that category. If I had a gun to my head I would say it had a kind of flat finish but that is outweighed  by the initial feel or sneaky hoppy rush."

"Reddish amber colored with a touch of haziness to the look.  A half inch of beige head is present.  Brussels lacing. Aroma is fresh dough and judiciously used piney hops.  The flavor is a well balanced presentation of amber malt but the hops seem more piney tasting than citrus.  The body is moderately carbonated and overall fairly light for the style."
""
""
""
"Overall:  A pleasant hoppy ale that while having a good hop profile is nicely tied together by the sweet bready malt build.  The more pine like hop notes meld really well with the malts and I’d even like to see a more of the pine than the lighter citrusy notes.  Runoff Red would be a good work week IPA to stock in the fridge; hits all the right notes without dragging.   I’d really like to see what an imperial version of this with a bit of rye and Amarillo hops."

"O - 4.75 - REALLY awesome representation of the red IPA style. Once again, Odell impresses me with their IPA game! Highly recommend this one to fans of IPAs looking for something just a little bit different from your normal IPA."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall:  Odell makes a lot of good beers, this one is another solid one.  Nice balanced IPA with a little more heft than I was expecting.  Worth a shot."
"Pretty awesome IPA, nice amount of hops flavor and alcohol"
""
""
"This beer is exactly what it says it is - a red IPA.  Not super-hoppy, thanks to the malty balance of the red, but definitely not just your standard red.  The color is a nice dark mahogany, again not quite your normal red.  There's a lot of lace on this one too.  This is a winter/spring seasonal and I'm glad I picked up a six-pack, even though it's not my favorite beer style.  I'll try anything from Odell, and this is no exception."

"Beautiful looking beer, deep Amber color with great clarity and Lacing with afluffy head. Sticky sweet malt profile with heavy floral notes, and a toasty oat finish."
""
""
"This brew is an amber color, clear,mand capped with a frothy white head.  The smell is a blend of malt and musty hops.  Nice balance.  Caramel and bread...peppery hops.   Lingering bitter finish it has a firm and medium mouthfeel.   This is a fine Amber ipa."
"While certainly not an especially aggressive beer, nor acutely expressive of its specific ingredients, it does seem pretty expertly expressive of the nuanced season when a somber quickening burdens each snowfall with the steady implications of spring."
"Hops and pine.   The more I drink, the more I like it, but it's still just too hoppy for me."
"Pours a nice reddish color with off-white head. Pine, malts, and citrus on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a nice caramel malt note."
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely deep, clear red with a nice tan head.  Aroma is of toast and citrus notes.  Good hop presence.  Slightly bitter then caramel malt notes dominate.  Followed by good hop bitterness and floral notes.  Finishes dry with just a hint of alcohol at the end.  Very nice beer slightly thin mouthfeel otherwise excellent by all standards."
""
""
"Pours  clear red color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are both good.  Has a piney, grapefruit aroma.  Big floral notes.  Maybe some apple.  Nice, smooth malt to hop transition.  Resin, maybe some apple taste at the end.  Can detect some caramel.  It is seems to have the right amount of malt to hops for me.  Good beer.  Would definitely purchase again."

"overall: easy drinking but substantial...tastes like a hoppy red should.  Doesn't do anything that really grabs your attention...in fact one might think it a little muted, but in fact, there is a great balance and subtlety that over the course of one or two, really pleases."
""
""
""
"Overall: A very pleasant IPA all around, more balanced than is typical without too much sweetness.  The hops is nicely presented without too much bitterness. Would definitely buy again."

"Not as dank and resinous as some Red IPAs I've had, but this is more fresh and lively instead. Well balanced - another winner from Odell!"
"You have to have it if you appreciate reds"

"Pours a nice dark copper color with a tan head. It's a pretty clean, clear beer in the glass, medium body. At first smell it's mostly citrus and hops that hit you. A nice, easy drinking beer. Caramel, grapefruit, and blood orange hints here. Finish is incredibly smooth, not too bitter.  Very good seasonal release from Odell, a nice standout. Hopefully it taste the same next year!"

"Interesting take on a ""Red IPA", I do not know that this is really a ipa, more of a hoppy amber but either way it is tasty. Glad to have tried it but I will stick to there regular IPA in the future."

"Mouthfeel is good. Heavy medium body, like a nice hearty amber ale. Like most everything I've had from ODell, this has a very clean fresh and close to crisp feel. Soft but strong enough carbonation level with excellent balance. Fresh feel that's got a natural sweetness leading to a nice clean bitter finish that's just the right amount of dry. Really drinkable, a great flavorful beer that's very easy drinking. Another nice brew from ODell. Huge props to Geoff for sending me this one, thanks buddy!"

"O: Aroma improves and hops emerge as it warms. Not the best hoppy red I've had, still not a bad beer."
""
""
""
"It's a pleasant drink and one I could drink far into the summer. I could easily finish a six pack on my own."

"Overall: A very solid take on a red ale. Bold with both the juicy hops and caramel malt. Its what you expect for the style."

"A really nice beer from Odell and one that I would have again. There is enough going between the sweet malts and the tropical fruits to keep you interested and the balance between the two is excellent."
""
""
""
""
"Taste was hoppy, it led, the red malt flavor that I'm not necessarily a big fan of played second fiddle, I liked that it was carbonated and hoppy enough to prevent any soggy wood mouthfeel that is typical of marginal red ales to creep on me. This is a better than average red ale, in fact, its probably a top 20%er."

"This beer had its moments but I think something was just a bit off. That being said, I’d probably give it another try."
""
"Light to medium bodied with modest carbonation. Another nice ber from Odell. I am very glad they distribute to Minnesota."
""
"Overall, this beer is one of my favorite offerings from Odell. As I sip on it, I am instantly transported back to my glorious days in Fort Collins as a CSU grad student... This was a beer that I always looked forward to every year, and I always had plenty on hand to share with guests at outdoor events and BBQs. Brings back memories of some of the best times of my life, and for that, I have to give this an obligatory two thumbs up."
"Very well rounded red here. Great execution all around. The malts blend very well with the hops and yeast providing a tasty drink from front to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Odell Red Ale is a beer tha a lot of people will love for the intense piney bitterness and roasty dark caramel maltiness. For me, it was just a bit too much plum and caramel flavor in the end and it didn't work as well with the intense pine and resin hoppiness for me."
""
""
""
""
"O - If you see this get it! It is well worth a try. Very drinkable, amazing aromas."
""
""
"D/O: Very well balanced, it's biggest attribute. Drinkability high."
""
"O- I would order this ale again. I found myself looking for more than what was there which may be because I like bigger ales. Probably not very helpful in this review but it is what it is. Cheers."
""
""
"A nice amber red color holds a cream colored head that retains well and leaves good lacing. The nose is hit with woody spices, earth notes, and hops. The beer tastes earthy and woody up front. Some subtle toffee sweetness mingles in before a citric, bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium in weight. Overall, I'm overwhelmed with the hops and lack of malty caramel tones."
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation levels of medium intensity, resulting in a smooth, slighty foamy mouthfeel. Closes dry, with little residual stickiness lingering on palate."
"Pours a perfect red/amber color, with a nice head and just a bit of cloudiness (as I like it). Smell is delicious hops, but not overpowering. The taste is the same. They nailed the maltiness a red ale should have and then kicked the hops up a bit too. Hop profile is more like an American IPA. It's really tasty! Mouthfeel is great, perhaps a bit overcarbonated, but not much. This is one of the best American amber/red ale's I've had and another really impressive brew from Odell! I wish I could get their stuff regularly!"
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a well-done red ale with good looks and good drinkability. The smell especially hits all the right notes with lots of spice and herb character, but there is enough malt here to distinguish this from an IPA. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
"Odell's makes some fine hoppy beers, and their Red is no exception. Rich and flavorful with good balance and complexity makes this a beer to look forward to year after year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a beautiful clear red color with a cream colored head on top. The lacing is good as well as the retention. The smell of the beer has a really nice hoppy pine aroma coming off of it with a slight sweet toasted aroma in there too,. The taste of the beer is moderately sweet up front with a very nice bitter finish. The mouthfeel is sharp but remains highly drinkable. Good carbonation and body. Overall it's a very good brew. Really enjoy this one."
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Definitely!"
"Overall though it's still an enjoyable brew from these guys and I can see myself drinking a lot of this very casually."
""
""
""
"o - terrific red, well balanced."
""
""
"What can I say? It's fantastic if not completely true to style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Wonderful beer, too bad it is only a seasonal offering, but it just makes this beer that much better. Perfect balance, brings subdued local winter spice to a nice and hoppy beer. A+ Odell."

"Doesn't really become fully intergrated and remains a bit all over the place. Could do with more definition and precision but still delivers some impact though not as much as I would hope."
"Bottle enjoyed in Estes Park, CO...quite stunning. The beer pours deep amber/mahogany with a well-made head of sticky bubbles. The aroma is pine and herbal grassiness with just a hint of brown sugar peeking through. Flavor favors malt more with caramel, shortbread, and biscuit. Hop flavor and bitterness is still firm with another hit of pine, some citrus, and an earthy element that separates it from other big American reds. Slightly resinous, oily mouthfeel along with the pine makes this perfect for a spring evening in the Rocky Mountains."
""
""
""
"This is a nice brew. The balance is very good. I was surprised not to get a strong citrus flavor like the aroma suggested."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good. I could see how this would be an excellent beer to pair with some ribs or a pork chop."
""
""
"Pours a slightly reddish amber color with 1 finger of white head. Wow, this has a much larger aroma than I was expecting, it almost smells exactly like their IPA. Lots of bright citrus (grapefruit) up front with a strong pine behind it, a touch of caramel malt sweetness at the very end of the aroma. The taste is interesting, the malt presence is much more prominent and clashes ever so slightly with the hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable. Overall this is a good brew but I prefer their IPA. The hop profiles were very similar but I thought they matched better to the dryness of the IPA vs. the maltiness of this beer. Still worth seeking out especially if you like maltier IPA's or Hoppy Reds."
""
""
"Another nice hoppy beer from Odell; this one, along with Lagunitas' Imperial Red (and others) seem to be retorts to the wild success of Troegs' Nugget Nectar. Not quite as good as the original but pretty damn tasty. I am continually impressed with the quality of Odell's beers."
"This a good amber. Very crisp and clean with nice bready notes. Overall a good refreshing example of the style. Good malt backbone with great floral hop kicks."
"O: This is a flavorful yet balanced and drinkable beer, but at 6.5% abv, I expect a bit more."
""
""
"Pours a dark ruby with a thumbs width beige head. Nice lacing. Wow... what a wonderful wonderful aroma. Sweet and hoppy and incredibly balanced between the two. Nectarine, grapefruit, a little pine. I could just sit and sniff this all night I think. Flavor is just as good. The grapefruit and pine seem to hit you in the forefront but its balanced extremely well by the malt backbone which provides some delicious toasty graininess and caramel sweetness, with a touch of some berry in there. A nice silky mouthfeel with an appropriate level of activity from the carbonation. Medium bodied. Overall, my favorite red ale. Love the marriage between malt and hops in this one. Odell with a grand slam."
"O - Incredibly tasty red ale, solid hop presence but nicely balanced with the caramel malts. Highly recommended and incredibly drinkable. This stuff on tap, I would imagine, would be irresistible."
""

"This is an amazing brew from Odells in Colorado it smells great reminding me of the aroma of a glass of Guava juice that i used to have when I was a kid in other words it has a very fruity smell.I had taken it out of the fridge and poured it from the bottle into a pilsner glass, this beer isn't the best too cold as i first found the cold numbs the flavor out and all you are left with is a very bitter taste with no flavor. Let this beer sit in your mouth and warm up and you will find a wonderful bouquet of flavor with a taste full of hops, pine, and that fruity flavor you could smell. Overall i was very pleased with my purchase and very happy I still have 5 of them left in my fridge."

"This January to April seasonal brew pours a rich, ruby red with a creamy white head, and about one inch of frothy foam. A surprising IPA like aroma is created with piney and fruity notes, as well as a little biscuity malt hints. A lot of the nose is noticeable on the pallet, with biscuity and toasty malt sweetness giving way to quite a wallop of citrusy (grapefruit and orange) and piney hop bitterness. A medium-light amount of carbonation is augmented by a medium body that finishes a little spicy and sticky finish. For our money, Odell's is executing the beauty of the hop better then anyone else in Fort Collins."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours red-amber with a huge foamy cream colored head that laces nicely throughout. Hoppy aroma of citrus and pine, balanced by caramel and bready malts. Flavor suggests the same as the aroma. Medium body with moderate carbonation, finishing slightly bitter and dry. A decent red ale. I actually liked this better the second time around on tap!"
"O - Another good beer from Odell. This is sort of a cross between a pale ale and IPA. Has a nice sort of fresh hop bite to it but has more of a malt backbone than a traditional IPA. Great spring seasonal."
""
"O: Really good beer pick it up and drink it, more of an IPA than a malty red"
"This is a fine red ale that is heavily herbal/spicy/and piney with catty and sweet notes."
"O: Still have yet to meet an Odell beer that I don't like. This isn't my favorite but it's a solid beer for sure."
"Overall: Just another great beer from Odell. Did you expect something different?"
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice, hoppy amber, worth seeking out or including as an extra."
"O: So balanced. Drink this!"
""
"Tangy! I totally get the grapefruit flavor everyone mentions on here. This is a very good red. The hops are all over the place, shaming many a so-called ""ipa"" My head didn't retain on this particular pour but it is leaving some nice lacing on the pint glass. The beer smells quite hoppy as well. A nice, easy drinking red that I will definitely come back to in the future."

"back and better than ever (or so i hear)... pours a not fully red and perfectly clear amber color lighter than expected. nose is piney hops and a dusty caramely red malt. more hoppy than sweet, and in fact more hoppy than most red ales. taste is epic, huge depth and tons of hops for the genre. agressive and lasting. just short of an ipa, or rather, much too much going on to be just an ipa, like drinking a the redwood forest. this beer rocks. mouthfeel is way up there, fuller bodied and strong, but drinkable like no other. what a session! odell is blowing my mind every new one i try. wow. this is a fantastic early spring seasonal"
""
"Odell Red: I am a big Odell fan, and this seasonal does not disappoint. The body is a deep leather red in color. There is no haze, but it is dark enough that it is hard to see through. A big off-white head forms on top, and leaves a nice lacing during your drinking experience. The Red provides a big aroma as well, with lots of flowery hop notes. There is a firm malt base to the flavor, and a big hoppy finish. This beer is closer to an IPA than a traditional red ale, so depending on your tastes you may really like it, or be disappointed. I liked it. Also, it has more carbonation than most brews of this style, which gives it a lighter feel. Very enjoyable."

"Copper ale with an off white head that falls with a nice lace. The American amber ale has a great nose with lots of toffee, caramel and strong hop spice. Big malt shows up in the taste w/o some of the other flavors in the nose. Hop bite is light but pleasant. Overall, a nice amber ale that gives the senses a nice run for the money and is still very drinkable. Might not buy for home again, but would gladly get a pint in a bar for a refreshing change of pace or a great go to beer for a place with a limited selection."
"Overall, not as good as Extra Special Red, but this is an excellent american red"
"Born on 5/24/11"
"O: Not the best red ale I've ever had, but to be fair, it's a little past its best by date of 6/15/11. I would really like to try this again fresh and rescore."
"O- This is a very nice, balanced amber ale, with no real points to complain about from me."
"D -- A textbook Red, worth a try and a repeat. Solid brew."
"This just goes to show you the forgiveness i will give a beer if it is bottle dated. the hops started to fade but it is MY Fault that I drank past expiration, therefore I rated it on what its original qualities would have been"
"Overall Impression- Huge maltiness and a caramel character like no other. I wish the hops were more dominant but this wasn't a bad characteristic. Drinkable and enjoyed before the U2 Concert @ Busch Stadium in St. Louis, MO. Pumped!"
"I'm not much for ambers/reds, and the first taste is a pleasant surprise. Nice and light, great carbonation across the tongue, some drying hop bitterness across an otherwise sweet finish. Didn't take long for me to finish this one, and wish I had a couple more on hand."
"Like Red Rocket without the hops. I could see it as a spring seasonal - it's both March and May. Unusual, but up to Odell's high standards."
"Overall/notes - A good slow-drinking beer, if you ask me. I haven't had many ambers that have been this bitter, and while it's a nice change of pace, I'd prefer that amount of bitterness to stay in American Pales, myself. Not too bad on the whole shot."
"Conclusion: This is a fine ale, however if something is called ""red"" I expect to taste some fairly rich malts, which I don't really with this beer. The hops are juicy and flavorful. If there was more balance with this beer I would probably love it. I don't feel it is over hopped, but instead that the malts are not rich and complex enough. Alas, it seems that for the typical American palate, any style that is overrun with American hops becomes a new favorite. Just hop the junk out of it and it will earn an 'A' on BA, no matter how far from the original style it has drifted..."
"Candy-like flavors are balanced by the bitterness. Makes a bold statement if you want an assertive brew. Let a couple of fingers warm up and it's a good exercise in hop tasting, whatever their blend might be."
"Final Notes: A lovely interpretation of the style, with a kicked-up hop presence. It would be a good utility beer since it's hoppy enough for spicy foods but malty enough to go with anything else. I'll be returning for more."
"I need more malt in a red and while I enjoy the hops here am not excited by this beer. I don’t like rating to style, but keeping style in mind this beer is a weird malted IPA or an over hopped and under/poorly malted red."
"The beer is pretty average overall and there are many many red ales to go for if you are looking for something impressive in the style."
"Overall- Odell does good stuff. This is yet, another solid beer from them. 4/5"
"O - This brew is very drinkable and is an excellent ale for any hop lover."
"Pours a clear copper/amber color with a 1 inch bone colored head that fades to a thin cap. Good rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of malt and spicy citrus zest hops. A very simple but good smell. Taste is of sweet malt followed by a citrus zest bite. Little hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel is a bit flat and thin. Overall, this is an above average amber ale but nothing too exciting."
"O - A nice red with colossal drinkability and very low bitterness. Would be easy to drink a ton of these in a sitting."
"Beer is medium to light in body with a nice sweetness and a mildly dry finish. The midpalate has a mild ethanol flavor with a mildly bitter finish. Overall a decent beer that I'd have again."
"The beer is transparent and orange / brown in color. The aroma brings dank hops, alcohol, and pretty much smells like a red ale. The flavor is decent, with alcohol more prevalent than expected. The beer is growing on me the more I drink it. The feel is a bit on the thin side. Overall, a solid example of the style. I'd drink this again."
"I would recommend this as a good red, not fantastic, but good. Odell's does a decent job most times and this fits that category. If they could boost the flavors I would be a huge fan."
"Pour yields a red-amber brew that is nearly see through with a good white head and loads of spotty lacing on the way down. The nose straight from the bottle after popping the cap screams hops with loads of pine and a bit of citrus. Really inviting. Great start. A bit of light amber malt in the background, but nowhere near balance. The flavor isn't quite as nice, adding in a bit more malt and just a touch of sweetness. Medium body and really nice bitterness in the finish. Quite a bit of piney hop flavor. Really nice brew overall. Super glad I finally got to try this one. Cheers."
"O: Even as it warms this 6.5% isn't noticable. The extra hops help to put this beer into the elite category of Red Ales. Wonderful lighter style beer."
"Finish: Bit of grainy with a dark citric on the back and a little sticky on the lips"
"Pretty impressive stuff. Subtle, complex, with an easy to drink attitude. Odell knows how to make the simple styles seem just a bit more so, which is great. And this is definately one of those brews."
"Another great beer from Odell!"
"Big thanks goes out to jmkratt for this one as an extra in a past trade! Dated 4/26/11B. Served from bottle into a Warsteiner mug. Poured a deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine resin, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, bitter hop, caramel, and slight cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice red. Not a lot missing on this one for the style. Pretty good aroma and flavor both. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness on both accounts. Worth trying and really glad I got a chance to try it as well."
" Overall-Glad I tried it,I am glad there is more from them than this also"
"This is a bold aggressive wake up for spring kind of beer. Very drinkable and will appeal both to malt and hop fans. One that I just wish were available all year."
"D= Another home run from Odells. They may be becoming one of my favorite breweries quickly. These guys do awesome work. Worth checking out. I went into the liquor store today hoping to just find something drinkable and I got it. Awesome beer!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Quite easy drinking and enjoyable. This is quite the hoppy rendition of a red ale. In so many ways this reminds me of a scaled down version of Nugget Nectar. This really is a good representation of the style. With the best by date being still 2 months out, I am curious how one of these would have tasted when it was super fresh. This is only my second experience with Odell and I am liking what these guys are doing."
"Drinkability - Good tasting, but not terribly complex, as most of the taste is just hops. Very drinkable though."
"The mouth is moderately full. Good heft to it, but drinkable still. There's a bit of a hop smack at the onset, but this flavor is fleeting and short-lived. There's not a lot of depth to this one. Mild sweetness on the finish. Bready. This is a stellar drinkable beer, but I thought aspects of it could be more pronounced. It's not a palate-torcher, which is fine, but there needs to be a bit more ""pop"" to the flavor. Still, I could see myself having this again and again. Good beer."
"D - This goes down readily and willingly. I could drink quite a few of these."
"Had a glass of this one on tap this afternoon at the Odell Brewery in Fort Collins. Nice aroma here, citrus hops and sweet malt. On the palate, this one is fairly medium bodied with flavors of citrusy hops, caramel, sweet malt, spruce and milk chocolate."
"I like this beer and think it would be well received even in a large group situation. A little something for everyone. Red Ale is an all around solid selection."
"This is good, but not quite as impressive as the others I've had. I've noted that some hoppy beers fit the winter and others the summer, and I think this fits the later better (for some reason)."
"It seems most of Odell's beers just fall a little short of being great to me. This one is no exception."
"The Red is a vibrant amber red with a lasting two finger head. It is as described above, a blend of goodness that could be 'ol trusty if it were around more often. Something I love to drink after a day of enjoying CO's many outside activities but with dreams of sipping on one at a hot summer Rox game. We all have dreams but at least today I have Red. Cheers."
"Drinkability: There is a healthy dose of hop here that's restrained in a good way by the malt. Starts hoppy, gets slightly malty-caramelly sweet in the middle and finishes slightly bitter and dry. Keeps the palate fresh and it's both enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Love this stuff. So drinkable with a great hop profile. Top notch red ale."
"Supreme drinkability, long hoppy finish. Quite satisfying, very easy to turn to another, and quickly empty it."
"While I still definitely prefer the old ESR, this is a solid beer that's a pretty big jump over most typical red/amber beers floating around."
"I had 3 pints in 2 hours. Yeah, it's pretty darn drinkable. A nice unexpected find at my local watering hole."
"This beer pours a clear bright red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing lingers for a while. The aroma is a great balance of malt and hop. There is a ton of grapefruit and a ton of caramel. The taste is maltier up from with a solid bitterness coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a really good beer. It is very flavorful and aromatic, however, the spectrum of those flavors and aromatics isn't that deep. Still I would happily drink this beer again."
"I feel a bit robbed of my $10."
"Overall, an amazing amber that is the best I've had for the style. I'm a fan."
"Notes: This beer is very tasty, and quite easy to drink. If I had one complaint, it would be in the mouthfeel. It's just a bit on the lighter side for the style. Overall, a pretty rock-solid effort by the folks at Odell."
"Drinkability: Fantastic Non-Imperial Red Ale; actually the best I have had for the style. Highly recommended."
"D: Best beer I've ever had from Odell. Happy drinking!"
"D: Enh. I could drink this to drink, but I'm not a huge fan overall. The flavor isn't great, which is my main complaint."
"D- so drinkable with a hop and malt explosion that is very nicely balanced ,,really liked this one and will be going back for a sixer or two more"
"A bit of a wake-up-style spring seasonal. Odell keeping it true with an old-school hoppy Red Ale."
"Despite being so dark and crystal malt influenced, this beer ends up with a very well done balance between malt and hop. There are ample hop flavors here to keep me happy and, while I was expecting it to, the crystal malt notes never get out of hand. This is quite well done and I would happily drink another couple of these."
"Overall, A fairly well put together american amber ale. The 6.5 abv is very well covered and doesn't hinder the drinkability whatsoever. It doesn't stray far for the style, however, It could use more aromatic hops in the nose and more carbonation. Still, worth a try."
"Extremely drinkable. I wish I bought more than just one bottle of this, on my last trip to Junction City, KS."
"Notes: One of the better Red Ales I've had. Definitely American with the sticky weed hops, but true to style with the roasty malts too."
"The beer pours a clear reddish-brown color with a tan head. The aroma is resiny and piney hops with some caramel malt. The flavor is piney malts with some caramel and bready malts. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice hoppy red ale."
"Extremely drinkable, and I find myself having it with almost any meal. Time for another!"
"dated 05/21/10"
"D: A very nice amber ale. Definitely on the maltier end, but that is what I like about it. Lots of complex, malty flavors. Quite enjoyable and even more drinkable. I will buy this again."
"If you prefer not to detect hops in your beer, skip this one. If you're looking for a nice complement to a roasted veggie sandwich and vinaigrette-marinated olives, you're in. There are clearly many shades in between, but I think the point is clear enough."
"Thanks, tturaiders, for the opportunity and, SalukiAlum, for the re-visit"
"Beer poured a deep copper color with a nice off white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is very good, strong malt presence combining with a very pleasant citrus aroma. Taste is pretty balanced; caramel hops form a nice backbone, hop finish is citrusy and piney. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth for the style. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very good beer that is well balanced and easy to drink for fans used to an IPA level of hops in their beer."
"Overall= This beer is a great spring classic, not a light spring beer, but not that of many spring barley wines, a blend of what we all love of winter and must say good bye, with a touch of summer, showing its temptation for a nice beer to be enjoyed in the warm sun."
"Overall it tastes like a hoppy pale with a well balanced malt character. I think this is a drrrn good beer. Very drinkable, reasonably complex."
"Note: The mouthfeel may have been affected by bad handling in shipping or by the store, but I have had at least 12-15 of thee beers."
"This is pretty tasty, and I could throw back a few, especially since it is quite well balanced."
"Worth a try! One of the nicer spring seasonals for the midwest."
"An awesome American Red Ale. I'd take this any day over their 5-Barrel or 90 Shilling."
"D - It's good."
"D- Eh. This doesn't taste that good. How can I drink a beer that doesn't taste good? I didn't buy it to look at or smell. It doesn't taste bad, it's just not good. Low drinkability in that case."
"Overall a really nice red ale. I'm usually not a big fan of red ales, but this really redefines what I thought of them. It has some nice malty caramel sweetness, and combined with a great hop character, despite being a little too much on the nose."
"D: A very drinkable and nicely hoped brew; another great offering from the guys at Odell"
"Overall I' am disappointed with this beer, hopefully I get to try this beer when it is more fresh."
"D: This is a really nice beer. It reminds me a bit of the Extra Special Red that Odell did in '09, only toned down in the alcohol department. That's a good thing, as I enjoyed that beer and am fond of this one as well."
"Easy drinking. Solid."
"Pours a sexy amber with off-white head that is thick at first then recedes to a thin layer that remains for the pint. Nose has a very nice fruity component, perhaps passion fruit or at least a very mixed batch of fruit aromas. A generous toffee sweetness is welcomed onto the palate at first, with plenty of ""juicy fruit"" hoppiness in the balance. There's a slight candied quality to this ale too. Finish is toffee sweet with lingering citrus. Very drinkable and quite delicious."
"D - Another tasty brew from Odell. Definitely leaning towards the hoppier side, but enough malt to maintain a nice balance. Enjoyed this one a lot, and will definitely have to revisit it."
"D - Easy drinking. Just enough hops to keep me happy. If you'd like to try a delicious malty IPA, try one of these. My new favorite amber/red. Another outstanding job by Odells."
"Hop flavor outshines the hop bitterness here, which is just fine by me. Malt provides plenty of backbone and this one has a smoothness I have not seen from some of the other big reds I have had. I like the fact that the sweetness is kept pretty low, which contributes a somewhat thinner than usual body, but in this case it makes the beer that much more refreshing. I would like to get my hands on another, fresher sample sometime soon as this beer is quite tasty."
"An American Red with a nice hop balance. Alcohol very well-covered. An enjoyable American Red!"
"Overall a bit hoppier then normal for the style I have to say, but it worked well. It made it stand out from the crowd a bit and I really enjoyed it. I wouldnt mind a sixer of this one."
"D=extremely, very enjoyable beer, moderately high alcohol content but still on the border of sessionable for some, definetly for me."
"M/D - Light to medoum bodied, a little on the thin side. Sweetness leaves a light coating in the mouth. Carbonation could stand to be a touch higher."
"Pours a very nice amber color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight citrus even. The taste is very nice, a nice little hop bomb, with some malts, citrus. Medium body, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Very drinkable, this brewery surprises me just about every time I try something from them, way to go Odell, thanks Bill."
"i previously didn't care too much for ambers, i now see them in a new light and highly recommend this beer to both red fans, and hop-heads alike"
"Odell makes some great beer and they raise the bar for the standard styles every other brewery around the country brews. The Red Ale keeps that tradition going with its great flavor and drinkability. Thanks for another treat, Bill!"
"forget fire tire hype this is the best amber from CO. and probably the best in the states."
"nice amount of carbonation in a smooth yet bitter beer. They really have a nice balance between IPA and Amber ale here. I really like it."
"D-This is one I will miss when its gone and just reminds me why I love this brewery so much."
"MF and drinkibility are great, if I could get this beer it would be in the fridge all the time! Again, this blows Red Rocket, Green Flash Red, Big Hoppy Monster etc away...."
"Mouth is on the higher end of medium bodied with a tingling and slightly oily finish. Great carbonation level! truly a wonderful brew. This will surely be a regular in the fridge."
"Mouthfeel was good with a high degree of drinkability; good thing I had a lot of company to share them with!! :)"
"D: Pretty hoppy for the typical red ale, but pretty easy to drink. Bought a six pack of this stuff, and I will easily be able to finish it off."
"Overall a Good beer."
"Drinkability - They did it again. I hate ambers/reds... but Odell's has now made a second one that I like a lot. The nutty character is what seals it, but this beer is mostly balanced, with a slight edge towards the hops. I am loving it, and I will be buying this again. And again."
"Taste is very hoppy. Very good pine and citrus flavors here. Some light caramel, and biscuity malt. Medium body that was well cabonated. A slightly dry finish. Very easy drinking. A great red ale. I will purchase again."
"nice spin on a typical red. Odell went a little hop happy. almost to the point of an IPA, which i assure you was not a problem. perhaps the best amber/red ive tried. excellent beer, try it"
"Overall, a very nice drinking well balanced beer. It has some great hop flavors."
"Medium/full bodied, smooth and very drinkable."
"D: At 6.5%, this beer is just at the threshold of being too strong for a session beer. However, I will say that I've very comfortably killed my 6 pack in two nights, and I plan on going down and buying up a case while it's here. Highly recommended if you're a fan of reds."
"As always Odell's knocks another homerun."
"D - This is one of the hoppier red ales that I've had. It is a really good one."
"Overall - This is a scarey beer, because it tastes so good and drinks so smooth. The ABV will sneak up on you. I like this beer almost as much as the Odell IPA (flip a coin). I would take either one."
"Pours a clear, amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops and some slight sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber/Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth, crisp, and a low carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops throughout (especially in the finish), some earthy malt, and slight sweet malt. Overall, a really easy drinking beer but nothing special."
"I will pick this one up when I can, scratches the hop & malt itch..."
"Blipped ""Turned to Red"" by Killing Joke"
"D: This one could be a session, a little strong in the alcohol, but a really flavorful beer for the style. A lot of good things going on. Probably won't appeal to the masses like Levity, but definitely is a nice change of pace for what is sometimes a very boring style of beer."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable, some good flavors. This seems like a mellower version of their Extra Special Red."
"This could easily be mistaken for an IPA.. Great transparent red color and smells like the grassiest fruity hops. The taste is bitter grassy hops again, fruit and bitterness. I guess you could call this red based upon the color but the smell and taste say hoppy IPA."
"Certainly one of the more hoppy American red ales I've had and all the better for it. I could also see it being called a red IPA. Either way, another great beer from Odell."
"The body is between light and moderate. A bit light for style, would have like to see more depth. The carbonation is light but balances well. Overall this is very similar to the IPA only darker and some caramel/roast notes backing it up. The body is lacking but still a good beer."
"Color is spot on to what a red should be- it's red. Really red. Smell is mostly forgettable, it's just too basic to be interesting. Mostly hops, some malt fighting through. Taste is better. A predominant caramel maltiness (you know, like a red) that ends in a citrusy and floral hop finish- very reminiscent of an IPA."
