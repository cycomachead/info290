"I'm not a hophead, but this is an awesome brew.  It's a beautiful balance between malt and hops.  Dare I call this a gateway to becoming a hop head?"
"Awesome beer!! Smiooth great blend of Amber and ipa. Beautiful marriage that makes people weep"
"Pours an amber transparent. Light carbonation. Smells a bit astringent with malty tones.  Taste is an even throughout subtle malt with slight biscuity aftertaste. Taste gets slightly more malty with warming temps. Definite caramel finishing yet still more biscuity in my batch. Enjoyable beer."
""
""
"Malty background with a nice hop presence"
""
"Overall, this is a very well thought-out and well-made beer."
""
""
"great red ipa. I haven't had all that many but this is my favorite in the red ipa style beers that I have had."
""
""
"-RED-"
""
"More of a red than an IPA, but definitely palatable. Just the right amount of bitter, and just a hint of something floral."
""
"I just love beers from Green Flash! Deep orange-brown in color. Bitter, but no lingering aftertaste. If you're looking for a bold flavor, this one's for you"
""
""
""
""
"I am generally not a big Red Ale fan (too one note), but this one breaks the mold for me the same way DFH Indian Brown does for brown ales.  Hop Head Red is still a red, nice amber rust color and sweet caramel malts on the nose and palate, but there is a great (and subtle) hop profile to add balance and complexity.  Really nice."
"Really enjoyed this one. Green Flash is doing some great things... looking forward at continuing to try their stuff. Definitely would re-buy in this world of 1,000,000 beers if I am feeling red."
""
"The bottle better describes the style (double red ipa) than does the one listed on here (amber). Yes amber in color, but this brew is a serious ipa. Nice malted base flavors and good hops."
""
""
""
""
"Deeply hoppy, complexed by the lightly carameled barley. I've had beer with a higher abu's not taste as hoppy as this beaut. Hoops are not incredibly citric or piney. It's a perfect balance in the bitterness profile."
""
""
""
"Kinda brown looking, smells great, smooth bitter then super bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely orange red with a good off white head.  Big hop nose.  Lots of floral notes with a faint fir note as well.  Big hop bitterness from the very beginning.  Lives up to every one of the 70 IBU's.  A hint of caramel from the malt but not a lot.  Finishes bitter and I agree with a  previous reviewer's comment of an ""iron-like"" finish."

"O-  Green Flash continues to amaze me.  They are becoming one of my top companies.  I likey!!!"
""
""
"I Liked this beer a lot. The more I drink Green Flash the more I like their Beers. I could go on about mouthfeel or whatever but I tell you what. 10 bucks. 4 beers. Good luck finishing all 4. 3 and I was satisfied. Not many beers can do that. I love satisfaction and this beer delivers."

"Big on malt flavors and big on bitterness, this beer packs a lot of punch. It seems a bit overdone and it affects the drinkability, but there's still enough good flavor to enjoy this beer from time to time."
""
"This is the amber that taught me to appreciate the style."
""
""
"Had this on tap at Ramsi's. Color was a dark, deep reddish, brown. The taste was unique, plenty of hops and malt, great smokiness too. Very rich mouthfeel. Soft head. Really liked this one, good early spring beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer was a treat! I thought it was hoppy and sweet.. But not a malt bomb sweet.. More of a Caramel or raisin sweet! I'll be buying more."
"A good red ale, but not as crisp and hoppy as expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great reddish amber. Big frothy head. Big citrus smell with a dash of pungency. Big bitter bite of citrus rind and pine. Lots of pine. This is great. I'd get it again."
""
"Medium bodied and bittered."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty nothing over the top, but another good beer from green flash"
""
""
""
""
"Aroma of malt, grass, spice, pine, brown sugar. Taste herbal, grassy, caramel malt, faint spice & resin. Nice Strong Ale"
""
""
""
"Sort of an imperial ipa taste but really hoppy which is great"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a lovely dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops, pine. Taste is hoppy, grapefruit, pine, bitter, some caramel malts as it warms. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."

"From a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours Amber to ruby with a tan rocky one finger head. The aroma is light with notes of grapefruit, pine, and salty sweet caramel malt. Although this has an excellent balance of hops and malt, it is generally malt-forward as an amber should be. The hops don't remain throughout, giving way to the aforementioned salty sweet caramel malt that dominates to the dry finish. This beer has some of the best malt flavor of any I have tried. However, the hops, as well as the overall flavor tend to diminish as it warms, which lowers the score a bit for me. Very good, but not my favorite red ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, it is reddish brown in color with a tan long lasting head. Smell is mostly floral. Had a nice lingering pine and caramel flavor along with a little citrus tang. Overall a very enjoyable beer!"

"Would get again."
""
"Pours hazy amber, red tint and off white head that dissipates quickly. Very floral/citrusy nose with caramel malts. Grassy/pine grapefruit up front, resinous pine throughout. Medium heavy body, a little spicy taste fades to sticky hop resin in the aftertaste."
""
"A decent brew, but in my opinion, more of an IPA than a red ale."

"Unfortunately I lost my early review, where I took notes before Green Flash had played with the recipe.  The beer still has a lot of the same qualities - crisp, bold hop presence, citrus notes, nutty rye and a sweetbread balance.   But with the amped-up ABV and bigger malt-backbone (albeit more hops as well), there's a cloying, molasses aspect that make this brew much less drinkable.  With all of the big, hoppy beers out there, it seems unnecessary for Green Flash to mess with a classic.  Maybe it was to make a  clear line of demarcation between their big beers and their tasty session brews.  Either way, this just isn't as tasty.  Oh well."

"Overall: I wasn't impressed by the beer. It wasn't a ""Hop Head"" beer in my opinion, and it wasn't that great of a red ale either. Very disappointed in the lack of Amarillo flavor and aroma. I would skip this one."
""
""
"Overall: I like! Plenty of hops and enough malts to match them. Great taste and mouthfeel. Aroma is good, although it doesn’t steal the show."
""
""
""
""
"On Tap at Rattle “N”  Hum.  Pours dark red with white head.  Aroma is of citrusy hops and caramel malt and ripe fruit.  Body is full and tangy.  A lot of citrusy, herbal hops, caramel malt, sherry and alcohol fill the mouth.  Finish is long and hoppy.  Great brew."

"Overall, this beer has the basics of something good but is just missing a bit in the flavor department. I would love to have some more malt and hop flavors come through and the bitterness toned down."
""
"The mix of sweeter malt and resinous bitterness doesn't work for me, or at least it rarely does, and this is no exception.  This beer isn't a surprise given it's a Green Flash beer, so if you like their stuff, this could work for you."

"12 0z bottle & on tap at the Yardhouse.Let me Explain.I had this beer at the Yardhouse about 3 weeks ago and I liked it so much I wanted to wait and drink it again before I wrote a review.Well I got to say that this is a great Hoppy red ale.At 8.1ABV it will get the job gone in more ways than one.Very Hoppy beer with a hint of flowers and citrus. I was listening to some Pink Floyd and drinking this and I`ve got to say this is a very good Red ale.Not quite as good as a Lagunitas Imperial red ale but still very good.Go buy you a 4 pack and you will see what i mean.Hoppy beers rock,Motley."

"Pours dark amber with medium beige head. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and citrusy hops. Taste is resinous hops upfront that fade into some sweet caramel malt notes. Aftertaste is lingering bitter citrus hops. Palate is medium and somewhat sticky. Overall nice balance with some sweet maltiness playing well with the big hop punch."

"Overall:  A nice red ale with a lot of hop flavor upfront.  There isn't as much malt as I would of expected but it is still well balanced.  This beer just downright looks perfect.  A beautiful color with crystal clarity.  I really need to do a side-by-side with Founders Red Rye since this is pretty close for a red IPA."

"O: I don't mean to call a brewery out for this but it seems like they took West Coast IPA(phenomenal beer btw) and added some specialty malts with the same hop bill. Either way it's really good if you like your American Ambers on the hoppy side"

"Overall: This is a great beer. It is very well balanced between sweeter notes of malt, and bitter notes of hops. I would definitely drink this again, but I am not sure that it is up there with Lagunatis Mondo, which is probably my favorite example of this style of beer due to the more prominent hop presence."

"Hop Head Red pours a diarrhea brown color, with a nice large lacing tan head. There is a strong earthy aroma with some hop notes. The taste has a stronger malt flavor, with some notes of hops, very earthy notes. Full flavors good body. Overall its a good red ale, but its strongly hoppy and strongly malty, not sure what was going on ."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and nice example of a Hoppy Red Ale and it had pretty much all the quality's that I look for in the style, the hop profile was nice and the malt base was identifiable as a Red Ale. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these especially when the weather gets a little warmer. What I like the most about this beer is the mouthfeel and appearance, I thought they were both pretty good and they were what I expect from a good hoppy Red Ale. What I like the least about this beer is the bitterness level, it's a little low for the style and I think the malt base can support a little more bitterness. I would buy this beer again when I'm in the mood for a hoppy Red Ale, but I'm not sure I would buy a whole six pack. I would recommend this as a solid hoppy Red Ale. All in all I enjoyed this beer and I thought it was pretty solid all the way around, but I still think a little more bitterness might take this beer to the next level. So far this is my favorite beer from Green Flash. Nice job guys, this was a very solid Hoppy Red Ale, keep up the good work."

"It's intensity, maltiness, and hop character would hold up well with spicy, fried food, Cajun, buffalo wings, etc. Or devils on horseback...mmmm!"

"Must try from great brewer."
"Very good American Red Ale, malty, yeasty and hoppy ale. Bold and bitter, also on its relative price though."

"O - if you read review you'll know I fell in love with Hop Head Red. It's just an amazing ale that may well be my all time favorite all around everyday brew. I'm just stunned at how Green Flash nailed this. Almost like it was brewed specifically for me. Sure most people rate it very high, but its not considered a real gem, but that's good for me considering I can find it any time I want. Which will be often, I promise you that. Green Flash Hop Head Red = my favorite brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid red ipa. Very easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Let's start by saying ""I love Green Flash"". This brew blends two of my favorite styles of beer, red and ipa. It pours a cloudy red amber hue with an off white head that gives way to a gentle white film and slight lacing. The nose is fresh and hoppy with citrus and grassy notes abounding. There is also a substantial malt background that reminds one that this is a red ale. It sips smooth and light light with a very pleasant bitter coating to the palate. The flavors are refreshing and easy on the palate. Definite citrus hops notes and a refreshing finish that reminds me of faygo red pop. This is a delicious hybrid from one of America's best brewers. Can't wait to enjoy another on a hot summer's day."

"Overall, this is a great drinking beer. There is nothing here that is abrasive. It is smooth and balanced and is likely one of the most enjoyable versions of this class that has ever graced me palate. All too often things are overdone, but this one seems just right. I will be visiting upon this again with haste."

"Distinctive taste familiar to other green flash beers, a litte more accessible that the ipa, slightly less burnt toast taste, more malt. Well balanced and still substantial, not too thin or bland. Looks and smells great, taste is dintinct but not quite my favorite personally. A very good beer."

"Medium amber pour with a ruby hue. Served on draft and arrived with a small head and almost no lacing. Nice nose of pine hops, tending towards spruce. Almost medium bodied with normal carbonation. Nice almost slick mouthfeel. A nice spruce flavor over a slight sweetness is found in this well crafted and balanced ale. This one is hop flavor, rather than bitterness, focused. Crisp finish of spruce and sweetness. A slight bitterness lingers. Quite nice!"

"O: A great 'red IPA'. Alcohol is apparent, though it still drinks very easily thanks to the hefty but smooth malt body. Well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has a ruby red color that is clear and filtered. The head is slightly tannish and creamy that dissipates slowly after a while. The beer has a floral smell as well as a bit of pine resin. The hop smells are balanced out by a bit of sweet malt but still has an overall hoppy smell. the beer tastes similar to the smell but is less hop forward. The sweet malt taste is stronger than the smell and has a hint of breaded malt. The beer also has a strong bitter hop taste with hints of pine resin. The pine lingers in the mouth afterwards. The beer has a medium body with a smooth feel even though it is a little thick. Overall, a pretty good amber ale that I would like to have again in the future."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be pretty fresh. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy ruby copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, grapefruit, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop and malt flavors; with crisp and quite balanced malt/hops with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent red IPA. All around great balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Don't get the grapefruit that others talk about. Good flavor, nice silky head. Interesting flavor from the Amarillo hops. Color is redish gold. Smell stays during entire drink. Definitely a woody citrus smell to me. Would pair with blue cheese, arugula, crackers. Almost a light spice after taste. Good Fall brew reminding me of October. Nice beer."

"Overall really good. I would have expected more hops considering its name. High drinkability for me. I would rather have an Oskar Blues G'Knight, but I'm not complaining"
"O- not bad but a little lacking in flavor"

"Final Thoughts: Green Flash has only recently begun distributing to MN so I've been trying to try anything I can find from them. While I was impressed with their other IPA offerings I find myself a bit disappointed with their Red IPA effort. The flavor just seemed to be missing that sort of spark that makes me want to take another sip. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'm always willing to give a beer another try if it's from a brewery that has earned my respect like Green Flash has done."

"Where the hell is the freshness date? Pours to a thick, rocky beige head that lasts as a half inch topping and leaves ample lacing. Color is a nice reddish amber. Aroma is mostly straight up Amarillo hop pellets and not much else. Quite nice but no malt. Flavor is hoppy, citrusy and has a roasty, malty backbone. Finishes bitter and floral. Mouthfeel is medium and slick. Overall, a good quaff for those who like both malt and hops."

"I may have liked this beer more before they jacked up the hop levels. Just a West Coast IPA that appears to be in red ale form. Sort of like the label claims. Overpriced and no bottle dates so I will not buy it again."
""
""
""
"O: Had this beer many times, but first time review. This beer is exactly what I look for in a red IPA. Very delicious. Well balanced. Have yet to be let down by Green Flash."

"over all this was a good beer. not my style. loved their ""west coast ipa""."

"12oz bottle ( like the shape of the bottle) from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $2.59 Darker amber in colour, great looking frothy, rocky inch high head. Crème coloured. Strange aroma, toffee, cream, figs, coffee, and some resin like hops. Tsste is really nice chewy yet balanced, toffee and fig come through strong. Low bitter ending. Hops go on for a while in this low profile. Nice thick and interesting mouth feel. Very nice beer that I had passed by many times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Once you open the Hop Head Red you are instantly hit with a citrusy hoppy aroma. It poured a dark reddish amber/copper with a huge head with a taste that was heavier on the malts with a full toffee flavor. The hops were not as intense as I would have expected from the aroma, but the bitterness is still present. The malts definitely assert themselves and keep the hops at bay. Overall the Hop Head Red was a tasty brew."

"O: My least-favorite offering from Green Flash Brewery so far. Although the appearance was excellent, the rest of the package was lacking. Although I had several gripes with the beer, the lack of balance was the biggest gripe. It was certainly drinkable, but not worth spending money on. Apparently, even good breweries can make mediocre beers."

"First, let me say my smell sucks, and only works on potent or pungent aromas. This one must have been mild. It poured nice with a thin layer of chestnut coloured foam. That taste was not bitter and no strong flavor one way or another, but went down smoothly. Overall very drinkable and provides a pleasant buzz."
""
""
""
"Taste is bright and packed with rich, full, citric hops goodness. Finishes more piney and bitter. Quite a delicious and worthy ale -- as close to an ""red IPA"" as I've had! Hah!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice take on a hoppy red that kinda reminds me of a cross between a Lagunitas Strong Ale (any of them really) and Deschutes Jubelale. And that is a-okay with me."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark copper with two fingers of tan head. The head retained for some time and left nice layers of lacing in its wake. The nose is pungently hoppy. The upfront flavor is a bit of a disappointment, however. The malt flavor is rather weak, but the hop profile roars back on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, very disappointed. Would like to try this beer within a month or so of bottling, but thats the only way I would give it another chance. I have had many ipas, (yes I know this is an amber) up to 6 months from bottling date that while perhaps not as hop potent, still tasted very good. Hoping the Rayon Vert, West Coast IPA, and Palate Wrecker in the fridge will be better than this. Watch this space."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I love the hoppy, bitter flavors on the palate. To be specific, the flavor is winter-green. It displayed a clean, fresh finish, which is very much to my taste. I had it with Chinese food and it paired well. I would purchase this beer, again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A fine hoppy ale, even if it does suffer from too much of a good thing (hop overload AKA a dose of astringency). The big sweetness isn’t my thing – making it good but not great in my mind – but it pays off in this beer for balance’s sake. Finding a fresher bottle might be nice, but it won’t be a priority any time soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I really like this beer. Very similar to Lagunitas Mondo Red Ale being that it's a hop forward red. I think I actually prefer this more, and with less alcohol you can crack another!"
""
"Starts out tasting like a classic IPA. Brings on tincture of vanilla in the mid-taste morphing to smokiness at the finish. Long lingering, distinctive aftertaste yields a sensation similar to eating blackened BBQ. Robust mouthfeel. Congrats to the brewer for creating a unique tasting and thirst quenching brew."
""
""
"The Verdict: Delicious. A hop monster at 70 IBU, but well balanced with a nice malt character. Combinations don't often work well, but this hybrid of red ale and DIPA treads that fine line perfectly. I can see this becoming a favorite."
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel & Overall: medium-bodied, very attenuated on the carbonation yet not overly flat, this “Red India Pale Ale” tastes like a numbed-down version of a barleywine using predominant American piney hops and of course dry-hopped to add more depth of bitterness and resins to the overall flavour profile. Overall, it is far more estery than BD and the palate hints at a possible close-to-expiry-date freshness for this bottle, but still I find it an extremely enjoyable experience with this beer style with an ironic name, Red India Pale Ale…"

"O: Great brew – nice and hoppy with a caramel twist."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Hop Head Red has a spicy aroma characteristic of the Amarillo hops used currently for dry hopping prior to bottling. Plenty of malt flavors to balance the hops and certainly bitter on the finish which sugests a lot of hops throughout the boil as well. Overall a versatile beer that can be enjoyed with or without food, summer or winter."

"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Awesome I got this stuff about 4 weeks old, I had passed on it a few times because it was seriously dated. Pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrusy with pine also and sweet malts. This beer is far above average and is solidifying red ipa's becoming one of my favorite styles. Taste is awesome bitter grapefruity up front, balanced by sweet bready malts, pine on the back end. Mouthfeel is almost creamy. Overall pretty awesome beer, would definitely pick it up again. Wish it came in 6-packs. Best thing I've had from Green Flash so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This red IPA had less hops in the aroma yet was more bitter and earthy. Disappointing and clearly less appealing than the Westbrook IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Too bad there are only 3 left in fridge...lol"

"A medium-bodied brew, the mouthfeel is well-balanced, both crisp and smooth."

""
"O: This one is surely awesome. Much better than most I've tried of this style. Balance through and through, very smooth. Not much harshness to speak of here. The complexity is great. Hop heads might complain that there isn't enough hoppiness. What it lacks in that department, it makes up for in the synergy of the ASTM categories."
""
""
""
""

"Hop Head Red is a classic. Maybe it's the addition of its parts that doesn't do well enough to represent the whole. Mighty tasty. Respectfully so."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Would love to get this a little bit closer to the bottling date but the aroma still popped. Appearance follows the name appropriately. Taste was wonderfully complex and had great balance. Perfect feel. I judged this beer based on what I thought the brewer was trying to produce versus the American IPA style guidelines"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste follows the nose. Piney hops, floral hops, sweet and slightly roasty/nutty malt, ending with lemon and orange. Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy, with low carbonation."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Some astringency coming from bitterness. No alcohol."
""
"Deep crimson, light khaki head of creamy foam. Not quite the blast of hops I was expecting from Green Flash, but the sturdy malt backbone is probably partly to blame. Bready with a healthy dose of toffee and just a faint roastiness. Hops lend a big spiciness and floral note backed by orange flesh. Bitterness is balanced pretty evenly. Clean, West Coast style all the way. A big red ale loaded with character. Another properly brewed American craft ale from Green Flash."

"O: Ok. this beer isn't what I remember, although I think every time I've had this in the past it has been on tap. I'm assuming this one has too much age on it. It's actually not bad if it were just a big red ale or even an old ale...it reminds me of a slightly more bitter version of GD Hibernation. As a ""red IPA", however, it falls short. This was given to me as a single. GF does date their cases so be on the lookout for a date if you are purchasing it in that format...for sixers and singles you've gotta hope to get lucky. I didn't this time around."
"O: I'm a big fan of the bittering portion off this beer. The late addition/aroma hops are OK, but the aroma was lacking and no indication of the flavor.. though i kind of liked that. A solid IPA if you like IPAs, and if you like IPAs you wont trust my IPA review any way because you want to try more IPAs... like me Cheers!"

"O: A great beer. Not the best red ale, but an eaay to drink and quite tasty beer. I love beers that are malty and hoppy at the same time."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Unique, great look, unique name, good taste, great company."
"Served on tap at the Saucer into a snifter on 3/23/13. Pours a deep, solid reddish-amber like well polished cherry furnitures. The head is full bubbles of dark off white stacking about 3cm with incredible lacing. The smell is full of resinous hops and sweet cane sugar. There is vibrant tropical fruits and malty sweetness, pineapple core, and pine cone resin. Great smell overall. The taste is heavy of malt with very good hop backbone. The taste is a little hefty on the sweet overall, which just slightly calls detriment to the overall tast. The mouthfeel is very full, thick with oily hops. Overall, this is another beer that wins much on draft that it lacked in the bottle. It's a truly good beer overall, especially fresh."
""
""
""
"O- Nicely balanced American amber"
"Overall - Not bad, good blend, worth a try. I can understand what they were going for here but not quite a bull's eye."

"12 ounce 4 pack. Nice red pour with a big tan head that sticks and laces a ton. Fresh hop kick in the aroma right away with citrus and bubblegum and follows with a touch if deep caramel and roast. The flavor shows more hops and bubblegum, slightly sweet, with some citrus and bitterness. There’s also caramel and a touch of chocolate. Nice!"

"Overall: A really nice and readily available Amarillo showcase that changes it up enough to stand out a bit from the standard IPA."

"O - This tastes like a a home brew actually, not that its bad at all. Its a different taste, and the malt back bone is a good change of pace for a hoppy beer."
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom embossed short twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"It nails the ""red ale"" and ""IPA"" in a good way."

"Overall – The mouthfeel, look, and smell are all quite nice, but the very bitter aftertaste it leaves at the end is not the most pleasant. The taste starts very nice, but just doesn’t know when to quite. Overall though it is a nice beer and one to try."
"O: Very nice beer. I would definitely recommend if you come across it."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Overall, the high carbonation hurt this. The nose was pleasant, but the taste was a bit of let down for an IPA. Better than your average IPA, can't hold a candle to the top IPAs."

""

"Overall - A very good IPA. Nice balance. Not overly bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent beer overall. There is a good balance between hop and malt profile."
""
"Ugly brown with flecks of yeast and a solid sheet of fine creamy foam. Smells like malt, some spice and more malt. Not really picking up any hops on the nose here. Taste is bitter and malty with some bits of tea and bitter - well bitter. medium bodied with medium carb and a dry finish. Not impressed. Wish I knew how old this was."
""
"O: Delicious IPA with a twist on the malt; I'd like to see a little more irish red malt character to compliment the hops in future batches."
""
""
""
"O- this one seemed a bit watery and lacking in the hop department, very drinkable but just seemed off balance"
""
"Ultimately it is a good beer but a bit pricey at $10 for 4; worth a try if you like the sound of the name but otherwise not a must have."
"Paired with the roasted corn clam chowder and corn muffin."
"Overall: certainly not the best AIPA I have had - too much hop bitterness and not enough discernible flavour. But hey - not bad as either a sipper or a few gulps of ABV wipe-out."
""
"O: This is a decent example in a style that I'm not a huge fan of, with one glorious Hershey chocolate-covered exception. This will satiate me nicely 'til Nugget Nectar arrives in my area, but I doubt I'd buy a 4 pack of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Explosive hop character and big bitterness over a creamy medium sized body. Raw leafy hop flavor up front followed by bright citrus character and sweet roasted caramel malts. Dried sugared papayas on the back end of the tongue balanced by a bit underlying earthy hop bitterness. Giant beer packed into a medium sized package. Long spicy finish lingers in the mouth, almost tannic in quality."
""
"A thick and cream colored head compliments the beers brownish red tint nicely. Rusty hops aroma. The first sip was smooth at first, then the hops bitterness pushes through and stays with you, but not as bitter as I was expecting. Also, a smooth mouthfeel that is surprisingly mellow. A very good IPA that fits my tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer. It makes me think more of a hoppier, less-malty amber ale than a red IPA, but I suppose that distinction is a bit semantic. Either way, it captures elements of both classic styles. As a side note, I do prefer the new, reddish-clay branded packaging to the older green label with red lettering. Seems to fit the style a bit more for some reason."
""
"Reddish-copper pour with a small cap of bubbly white head that receded to a thin layer and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Lots of citrus and pine hops in the nose, with a definite malty sweetness in the background. My taste buds scream ""WEST COAST!"" upon the first sip, grapefruit and pine hop elements obvious, but quickly balanced out by a generous caramel maltiness that reminds you that this is not actually an IPA; sweet and bitter duke it out for the session, and perhaps the hops win overall, but not by much. Medium body, a bit resinous, but nothing a few sips of palate-cleansing water can't cure. Very good overall."
""
""
""
"O: Kind of a 'WEIRD-BEER'...Also, I think it is mis-categorized. This one is more of an amber than an IPA. The hop seems too subtle for a standard american IPA, but does have a nice hop malt balance which seems more characteristic of an amber ale. If you're looking for a standard hop bomb, this is not for you. If you want a beer that blends sweet malt with a mild hop bitterness, then this is for you. Again, too weird, no thanks!!"
""
"Eh, ipa hoppy but really doesn't impress, color, malt profile and just the overall feel of this beer doesn't fit right. I don't get much of the Amarillo hopping either, old bottle perhaps. Overall, a loosely held together beer that isn't quite the sum of its parts."
"It pours a semi-clear, medium brown color with a beige head. There is a good strong scent of Amarillo hops. The taste is rich with a complex blend of hops. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a mouthful of grains that finishes with a mild bitter after taste. The texture is smooth and keeps you coming back for more. Not quite a red ale and not quite an IPA, but very tasty nevertheless."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Interesting beer, and it would be hard to pinpoint this one with an exact ""style"". I enjoyed the blend of fruitiness but it may have benefited from just a little more bitterness all-around, to help offset some of the intense sweetness spikes that come through. Thanks again to Johnny for this one."
""
""

"O - pleasantly surprised. While I probably won't drink this on a frequent basis, it is a very balanced beer and something I can imagine using to convert someone to hoppier beers. Very well done and not too overwhelming in any aspect."
""
""
"RJT"
"Delicious! I love the spiciness from the amarillo hops and they use plenty in this beer. The yeast plays of the malt to create and dense and sweet base and as strong as the hops are they meld instead of stick out like a sore thumb like other hoppy ambers I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I am a fan of red IPAs. This one pretty damn good. I would/will seek this out on a pretty regular basis after trying it for the first time on this review. Pretty pleasant discovery.

""
"Pours dark red with medium head. Heavy sediment in this one. Aroma of heavy caramel malt and fruits, with some pine notes. Flavor is malt forward with pine hop bite on the way down. Medium mouthfeel, slightly slick, and something off about the palate. Pretty unique brew, and not sure how to characterize this one. Pretty good, but not crazy about it."

""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great aroma and tasty flavor."

"Beer is a murky deep copper color. Aroma is of hops, bread, and an interesting burst of apricot. Taste is quite good. A good punch of hops along with pleasant spice from the rye. The beer has a dry taste/mouthfeel and seems slightly astringent, in a pleasant way. Overall, this is a nice red IPA. Crisp, nicely bitter, and fairly complex."
""

""
"Good beer. Will purchase again."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied, actually a big medium."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy garnet with dense one finger thick khaki colored head. Settles to a thin layer, streaks of fine lace down the glass. Smell: resinous pine, citrus rind, sweet back with biscuit and caramel, lightly fruity. Taste: juicy grapefruit and pine, then sugary caramel, toast and cherry notes, a little grassy, then grapefruit again in the finish. Nice!"

""
""
""
"Overall this is good. Maybe this is just an older bottle, but not a hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: it's nice, as the bottle bills, a red IPA. It's definitely more of a hoppy red ale but, unfortunately, it doesn't match up to some of the better hoppy reds. A good beer but not a great one."
""
""
"Medium bodied with above average carbonation, and not much aftertaste. Definitely a solid beer, but a bit sweeter than I would like. May need to review again, this bottle may be past it's prime. I expected this beer to be much hoppier. Still good though."
""
""
""
"Overall - A hybrid amber / IPA. Probably closer to an IPA, but I'm not digging it very much, regardless. Too much earthiness muddles things up a bit. I'll drink it, but I doubt I'd buy it again, especially at the price for which it retails."
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium to full bodied, moderate carbonation, lots of resin. This is very much a west coast take on the amber ale; lots of hops, not too much concern with bringing out the malt profile. It's good, but not my favorite amber ale."

"O: A good red ale, very well balanced with the hops and malts. Definitely worthy of a try"

"This is a very drinkable beer another hit. Hop heads unite on this one."

"Has a nice herbal bitterness reminiscent of ice tea. Bitter citrus and ruby red grapefruit swirl around the palate leading to a nice chewy malt backbone with some sweet caramel notes. A nice well balanced IPA."
"Overall: a nice beer. Very drinkable and flavorful. Nice contribution to flavor and both feel from the malts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of earthy hops with some citrus and resin is quite nice. Taste is totally dominated by hops with some resin and citrus hops though notes of earthy hops are really powerful. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Not bad though grapefruit notes of Amarillo were not as dominant as I had expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"I want to drink this one mega-fresh; I'm not sure this bottle is doing my first taste of the beer justice. At any rate, it's up there with the best of 'em for Red IPAs, a good example of the clarity and hoppiness of a pale ale style mixed with the heartiness and sweetness of a red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a hazy red color with foamy off-white head. Smell is a rather pleasant malty aroma. Taste continues to showcase that nice malt character, but where are the hops? They come in about midway through the sip and not in a pleasant way. They just make the beer taste bitter. I know that's what hops do, but in this beer they don't really add anything to the flavor. It doesn't taste hoppy, the beer just becomes bitter. The roasted malts save the beer considerably and saved the beer for me. I didn't have a hard time drinking it; I just wasn't particularly enjoying it as much as I had hoped to."
""
"O - With a name like this, I expect the hops to be much more assertive (a la Nugget Nectar). Not just on the back end of the taste. Still good, but could be more hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a superior blend of an IPA and a red ale. I am starting to wish I bought the four pack and would have no problem having this again any time any place."

"O: Overall, extremely well made brew. I'm not sure if the classification is correct, but a great easy to find, year round brew."
""

""
""
"O- More IPs than red, but a nice beer on a warm day."
"The aroma and bouquet for this one is much nicer than the actual taste"
""
"O- A slightly above average IPA. I'm not sure what the red part does for it other than try to separate it from the vast crowd of IPA's out there."
""
"This is a well made beer. It would make a lovely IPA. However, I just can't get into the American approach to reds. The malt is completely lost here, I'm quite skeptical of anyone who claims this is a successful melding of styles. Hops are at war with malt here, and they win."
"Pretty tasty, but an odd lack of malt backbone in a good red. Still a repeat buy will be coming, I like this one."
""
""
"Comes out of the tap a dark, nearly opaque reddish amber with a thick, fine-bubbled, light tan head. Hoppy aroma has a hint of malt. Flavor is more hoppy than malty, leaning towards an IPA, a bit bitter with subtle notes of caramel and fruit. Firm, smooth texture has some good fizz and life."
"The only thing lacking is that i wish it was a bit hoppier. Otherwise another great beer from green flash!"
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a ruby-copper coloring with a thin, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that sits a solid half an inch on the top of the beer, clinging everywhere it touches. Aromas of wet, resiny hops atop a malty, rich, caramel sweet backbone. Flavors are more scotch malt on the palate, with a peppery and floral hops blast at the end of the palate, leaving a bitter and resiny aftertaste. Roasted characteristics throughout, giving a more tame profile to the caramel backbone. The finish is drying and bitter, cleaning the palate and puckering the mouth slightly. Very tasty brew."

"Drinkability: It is good stuff. The hops dominate, obviously outshining the malt complexity, but it is a tasty brew. And it’s from San Diego, a world-class city."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours reddish amber with a tall, khaki head. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass, but not many. The head leaves some nice lacing behind on the glass as it retreats. The head retains very well during consumption. The hops bring grapefruit, pine, and floral aromas to the table. Bready and caramel malts can be detected in the nose as well. The beer tastes like a sweeter West Coast IPA. The citrus and floral hops really balance up front with the sweeter and bready malts. The piney bitterness comes out in the middle and back end, leaving some in the aftertaste. The flavors are well balanced. The body is medium with some carbonation. The finish is dry. the drinkability is high. This is an excellent example of a West Coast IPA. This is an IPA I could drink on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"O: Decent red IPA, could use more hops. May prove too dry for some tastes."
"Lightly toasted caramel malts up front. Piny, resinous hop bitterness starts to crescendo. Meanwhile, big fruity, and caramel-y malts make for a sweetish palate. Candied apple into the finish, with plenty of herbal, slightly orange-y hop bitterness in the end. Medium-full body with a creamy, thick, soft feel. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""

"Overall: It's an IPA, it's red, and it's hoppy -- folks are into that these days, right? It's also a tad expensive, but some folks don't seem to mind that either."

"Pours a pretty dark reddish color... darker than other IPA's I've had, but I guess that's why it's a red. Carbonation seemed to be high and the head stayed around for a fairly long time. The taste is hoppy as expected but not overpowering to my IPA-loving tongue. There is a bit of malt but not much. Overall it was rather enjoyable, but it was a step below the best IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a very dark red with some haze and an off white head. The nose is dominantly hops, very citric and quite vibrant. The taste of the beer starts off with a nice bitterness and graces your palate with a fresh hop profile. The hops are citrusy with pineapple and grapefruit being dominant. The malts are more present then their standard IPA, the have some caramel tastes as well as toffee. The beer drinks about as well as an IPA should and wont give anybody a hard time. This is a decent green flash, not up to some of their other brews but still a solid beer."

"Overall: interesting combo of ipa, and amber. Not quite dialed in though."
"Hopped-up Amber Ale? Red IPA? Whatever it may be classified as, it is quite good. Nice hop kick, robust malts, just wish for a bit more in the aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a pretty tasty beer. A nice alternative to the typical IPA or IIPA. A more earthy, herbal style of IPA."
"A pretty good beer overall. I might have low-balled the taste a bit, but I would definitely try it again."
""
""
"o: while this is not a bad beer, it's not a great IPA and it's not a great Red Ale. I'm kind of undecided here. I'd get it again if I saw it on a store shelf, but I wouldn't seek it out. That being said, if you haven't tried it, it's worth at least that. Since there's only 4 in a pack, I think this could pass for a very short session."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, the hop flavor pretty much negates a lot of the malt character. Very drinkable beer, but definitely leans toward the ipa side rather than a balance with a red ale."

"Pours a ruby amber with a large long lasting tan head with very good lacing and head retention through out to the end. Aroma of floral piney hops, some grapefruit and citrus notes with some caramel malt and yeast. Taste is floral piney hops, citrus and grapefruit notes with some caramel malt and yeast. A medium to full body with very good lively carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Finish is caramel malt, yeast, citrus notes followed by a good amount of floral piney hops on the end for balance. This brew is dominated by floral piney hops but balance well by the caramel malt and yeast to make it a pleasant drink. Overall a very good full flavored and nicely balanced brew."
"O - I enjoyed this beer. Green Flash makes some great beers, I just wish they would use some form of bottle dating. This one probably wasn't fresh, but it was still enjoyable. A bit malty, but very easy drinking. Nothing to really set it apart from the vast sea of IPA's, but it is good."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: Like I said before, was expecting much more of a hop bomb and got a malty beer. Disappointing."
""
""
""
""
"A very enjoyable IPA, my first thought when I smelt this was that this is something I would definitely consider buying more of."
"O: A good, very drinkable brew. Now that Green Flash is available around here, it will likely be a regular. That being said, I remember liking it much more on draft than out of this bottle."
""
""

"O/D - Fairly tasty. Hoppy and rich with a nice balance. Hop forward and very drinkable."
""

""
""
""

"O- Nice ipa or imperial amber which ever floats your boat. Like the citrus and sweet malts."
""
"On the whole, this seems to marry some the less attractive aspects of a Red Ale with an anemic IPA. However, the manageable bitterness along with the nice sudsy mouthfeel makes it quite drinkable. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Best Damn in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a malt forward hoppy beer. A good transition beer for those trying to get into IPA's. I've had other bottles that were hoppier"
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Deep red with a two finger off-white head that was slow to recede into a one finger cap. Thin lacing. As you'd expect, the nose was very hoppy with traces of resin, grass, and grapefruit. An alcohol/phenol blast is the first thing that registered with me taste-wise with a strong aftertaste of hops in the finish. Average carbonation and near medium-bodied. I was a bit put off by the strong alcohol tinge up front after getting so excited over the smell. Sadly, this beer does not perform as well as it's cousin West Coast IPA."

"Pours a really dark amber with a thick creamy head. Nice lacing. A nice, balanced aroma of earthiness and some sweet fruit. Flavor is earthy, a touch of some toffee, and a little fruity. A nice crisp, active thinner mouthfeel that suits the beer quite well. Overall, a solid brew but nothing that has me needing to go out and grab some more."

"O: Great drink that goes down way too easy. Well worth checking out."
""
""
"O- Nice and enjoyable across the board. A great example of a hoppy red ale that's not too intense."
""
""
""
"Another solid brew from Green Flash. Not sure about all the naming conventions and what not, but this to me is more an IPA than a red ale. The characteristics of a red ale does peak it's head out and in some interesting ways though, but IPA characters take priority here. A little more balance would've been absolute amazing."
""
"This is another tasty Green Flash brew. I can't say I'll get it often at the price though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just really solid, really pleasurable, really a great example of a basic amber and balance between hop and amber malt goodness, and just flat out delicious."
""
""
"O - I used to not like red ales until I had this. Nicely done Green Flash!"
""
"Medium to full-bodied with a heavy dose of hops to finish this out. Still with the malty characters and sweetness, this comes out fairly even. I enjoyed this but wasn't really sure where to place it on a scale of IPA vs. West Coast Amber Ale"
""
""
"Overall, this is a baffling step down from Green Flash's West Coast IPA. This beer tastes like an ineffective attempt to re-create Nugget Nectar or something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red brown amber with a half finger off-white head, quickly dissipates, leaving moderate lacing. Aroma of herbal hops, citrus and some pineapple. Flavor is hop assertive, with citrus hops overwhelming a moderate sweet malt backbone. Finish is citrus hops, a bit metallic. The hops are nice, but overpower the malt to a degree that is unbalanced. An adequate red ale, but not one I will return too soon."
""
""
""
"O - I tend to make up words for awesome beer, sorry. Delicious, piney explosion. Just the way i like it..."
""
"Overall: this is a decent red IPA (or hoppy red ale -- whichever), and, while there are some flavor flaws I don't particularly like, overall it's a good beer."
"DOA"
"Overall it's an OK beer in a crowded market. Not a blast of hops, but reasonably balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes great, with this up front hop and a smooth malty finish. Like … a red ale and an IPA, go figure. There’s a spicy zest to this (brew a rye version of this and I’ll be in love all over again), with a pleasant citrus-pine bitterness and just enough malt to bring it all down to earth. Great finish. Bravo!"
""
""
"Carbonation could be a little creamier."
""
""
""
"O: I had never heard of this before but saw it at my local beer store so I picked up a couple. Glad I did."
""
""
"Overall, it already takes a lot for a Red IPA to win me over, and to add a flavor that tastes like car tires squealing just takes it in a worse direction. It could be worse tho, at least that character is a secondary and not primary flavor."
""
""
""
"Not that complex but good all the same."
"O: A very solidly made, drinkable red ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very good red. I've had a few of the members of the amber/red family, and this is a good one. Its not the best, as that distinction goes easily to the Troegs Nugget Nectar, but this is a very nice offering and one I could see myself drinking again if the opportunity so afforded itself."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great beer. I expected it to be all about the hops, and this beer exceeded my expectations. I hope to try some more Green Flash in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So all in all, a decent beer that tastes pretty good but doesn't do the style as perfect as I wish it would. I'd have it again, though."
""
""
"Even though the hops rock through, in the end a little on the sweet side, a nice change from a straight up IPA."
""
""
"O - Is it a hoppy Amber, or a malty IPA? I don't know, nor care, because it's just a really nice drinking beer. Great balance with big aroma and flavor for me. I appreciate that it's ""different"" enough to stand out from the huge collection of IPAs out there."

"Overall- really enjoyed this beer. I an usually not impressed with Red Ales but I loved this one. Solid beer."
"I may just be sucker for an over the top hopped red ale, but this was one of those first sip, put the glass down and say ""man, that is good"" beers. Deep amber pour with some sweet malt aroma. Bright hops flavor with a distinct clover honey sweetness lending balance. Just a touch of white pepper at the finish from the alcohol. This immediately called to mind a bit toned-down Hopslam - heresy, I know."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Loved this beer. I am looking for more tomorrow. Something about the dry hopping and the heavy malt just hit it right for me. Trying to be subjective, it seemed balanced and overdone in the right way. Not sure how."
""
""
""
"This is a great, enjoyable, drinkable beer. The malt is strong and forward and the hops add balance and a very mild bitterness. I would definitely drink this again."
"12 oz bottle pours a deep amber with fluffy head and lacing. Aroma is floral and citrus, typical heavy Green Flash dry hopping. Loaded with juicy citrus and floral hops, Green Flash sure knows how to put together a great hop profile, but more caramel malt base than a typical IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, resinous, with dry finish. Green Flash made some slight recipe changes to this beer in redefining it as a ""Red IPA", but it's still delicious."
""
""
""
"O: More hop-forward on the nose, amber-forward on the taste. A great drinker, and I'm not sure this bottle was the freshest. Good stuff."
"O: This is an excellent American red ale/red IPA, and unlike many beers of this type, has quite a bit of personality. I could see this becoming a staple in my refrigerator."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For one, I appreciate a well balanced amber ale, but these more hoppy versions appeal much better to me as the hop-forward nature of the beers give more intrigue and better offset the caramel sweetness and weight of most beers of the style."
""
""
""
"O - Nice hoppy red. Was pleasantly suprised with this one."
""
""
"Good carbonation that makes for a full and creamy mouth feel."
""
"Overall, it's an odd one. Genial, but without a whole lot of substance, and some weird ideas about what the style's supposed to be. It looks like an IPA, but comes off both saccharine and washed out at the same time. The Mitt Romney of IPAs?"

"This is one of those beers that I keep coming back to. It's just an easy to drink, great tasting red. Pours a nice copper, smells fantastic and has an amazing taste. Not to much wrong with this one. If you're not into red beers, I'd suggest trying to get back into them with this one. A go-to 4-pack I pick up on a regular basis."

"It's hard to find a thing wrong with this beer. Beautiful pour, tons of lacing down the glass. Needs to be cleaned, the glass does, after each pour! Craggy tan head with outstanding retention. Scents of pine oils and cherry juices. A very dark beer for a red ale. Medium bodied with a remarkable balance between the rich maltiness and the hoppy bitterness. The malty backbone hits the palate as do the hops, followed by a semi-sweet finish that is not cloying. An absolute masterpiece of a brew that can be drank anytime of the year and multiple brews in a session!"
""
"O - Good, but not great. very drinkable."
"Appearance is very deep crimson color with a fluffy two inch head. You don't have to stick your nose into this one to get a whiff of the potent hops and grassy notes in this beer. Great smell, and my first taste didn't disappoint either. As a professed hophead, I was pretty satisfied with this beer. The hops are the main attraction and the beer finishes very nicely to make it very drinkable, lingering on the back of the tongue. Medium mouthfeel lightly and drinkably make this one that you can have multiple of in a night. I imagine this is even better when enjoyed straight from a fresh tap."
""
""
""
"Awesome beer. Though I don't quite put it up there with Nugget Nectar this is damn close."
""
"Taste is strongly caramely, slightly sour, and hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Crisp green finish with no residual off flavors."
""
"This beer pours a hazy, copper color with very little head but lace that lasts. The aroma is fruity with a hint of caramel, It's flavor has notes of grapefruit, caramel, toffee, and a strong hop bitterness and mild malt sweetness. The bitterness, while leaving an aftertaste in the finish, mellows as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium. Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale is a decent beer, smooth and dry. Recommended."
"Overall. Pretty nice and big ipa. I'd drink it again for sure."
""
""
"a bright red amber ipa with a 2 inch white head. smells like a west coast ipa, extremely hoppy with a touch of malty sweetness. taste is much sweeter than the nose, with a rather heavy feeling sucrose element. very little bitterness for such a hoppy beer, more resin like and sticky. mouthfeel is pretty good, plenty bubbly and medium bodied. overall a good ipa, but because of the sweetness i wouldnt want to drink them all night."

""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a beautiful bright red, with 3 inch Tanish red head, with excellent retention and lots of lacing. Smell pineapple, tangerine, carmel, and pine. Taste is all of that perfectly balanced with a little grapefruit in the finish. Body is wonderful, pretty chewy for 7%, easy drinking, and plenty of life. I really like how the kicked this up a notch and made the price feel better do to the abv being higher and the taste being even better."
""
"Appearance is ruby with a two finger head. Its` nose has caramel, grapefruit and pin. Taking a sip of this bright colored red ale, I taste a sweet aspect right away. Not sweet like some stouts or other beers, but a really nice hoppy amber. The mouthfeel is light-medium, with moderate carbonation to it. It drinks easily and is a tasty beer."

"O: As the title suggests, hop heads may enjoy this beer, as that is all there is. Only the bitter hop taste with nothing other than its looks to be its saving grace (kinda like Katy Perry). A good beer is a balanced beer. This one is just a bit top heavy."
""
""

"This is an excellent beer & one damn solid red that avoids the dreaded Malt Coma. This uses the malt & the hops to weaves a lovely dance, sans pole, that I could watch for hours. Brewers dream of creating a one-celled organism that tastes this good. Only my third Green Flash beer, & they're 3 for 3."

"Overall: Surprised to see the lower scores on this beer; though this is a very fresh bottle. I imagine that this beer suffers dramatically from age; there's some really great subtle interplay in the nose and taste, and the Amarillo dry-hopping certainly adds some great citrus qualities to an already great beer. I'll definitely seek this out in the future..."
""
""
"O- A powerful beer that has a lot of flavors to sift through and digest, but still doesn't feel heavy or as alcoholic as it is. A nice example of the style."
""
""
""
"O: I am a fan of red ales with a hoppy finish. Green Flash make a valiant attempt to take a step further with mixed results. I would like to try it on tap since hops that have been on the shelf for a while can become harsh and lose their balance. Right now I find the Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale a much better beer than the IPA version."

"The body was medium to full bodied. Adequate carbonation."
"make. I think that a little bit more malt complexity would go a long way. I admit that I'm a sucker for a hoppy red ale, but there are a few others out there that I would choose over this one."
"Cheers..."
"Solid red ale. A plethora of hop flavors similar to their IPA, nice malt presence too without being overpowering."
"O: Hop Head Red delivers on exactly what it is supposed to be. High hoppy bitterness balanced out by smooth candy caramel malts. Appearance, nose and mouth-feel are exceptional! Pine, citrus, florals and grassy hops are very well balanced."
"Green Flash's West Coast IPA is a personal favorite. Hop Head Red follows that beer's lead nicely. This was a very strong pickup."
"All in all, not my favorite style but this is a very good beer."
"Overall: While I am not the biggest fan of Amarillo hops, this is one of the better Red IPAs I have encountered as the balance is excellent; Green Flash is one of the kings of the west coast style and this beer is no different"
"Overall: Being a red ale, it only seems easy to borrow some references in describing this beer. Sure as a redhead is to captivate you with her looks and ultimately steal your heart, this beer does it. She's got red hair and curves, watch out."
"O: This is a really good beer. I love the hop kick at the finish. The carbonation really helps to carry this beer through."
"Overall, a good red ale that is a nice session beer and very drinkable."
"O: Well it's much better than Killian's, which according to Untappd, is what this beer is comparable to. Realistically speaking though, this beer was too old, the hops are just gone. I bought a sixpack of this years ago when it was fresh, and I was blown away by how intense and bitter it was. Unfortunately I didn't write reviews back then, so... looking forward to a fresh batch and a new review!"
"O: A really nice, complex red ale that lets the hops shine through without skimping on a nice, bready and sweet malt backbone. A little off-kilter and boozy at nearly 6.5% ABV, but it's easily replaced Cascazilla as one of my favorite hopped out reds."
"An accessible, delicious, super hoppy red ale."
"This is a solid beer. I'm fast becoming a big imperial red/red IPA fan, and this is a great example of the style. More of an IPA with amber characteristics, it's very hoppy, and the hop flavors and aromas are balanced well with the malt. Nothing too complex, but definitely a good beer to reach for now and again."
"Pours a clear red with a big airy tan head. Smells of earthy, dank hops. Taste is a biscuity malt up front, followed by a sweet toffee middle and a big citrus, earthy finish. Big hop flavor, not a lot of bitterness though. Mouthfeel is average, slightly low carbonation. Overall a quite good red ale."
"Serving type: Bottle (poured into a pint glass)"
"O- I really like this offering from Green Flash. The new packaging bills it as a ""Red IPA"" and it lives up to that classification. A great hop profile balanced with a nice malt bill make this a very tasty and drinkable ale."
"All star worthy."
"Dr: Very drinkable, above average ABV, and fairly priced. I'd certainly have it again if it were on draught."
"Overall this is a really good beer. I like that it's got IPA levels of hops, but in a slightly different framework. A good hop fix with something more than just hops."
"The Green Flash Hop Head Red is a GOOD beer...definitely worth a smackerle. The appearance is dark ruby read with white frothy foam which laced beautifully down the glass. The smell was subtle and not overpowering with any one theme. Certainly malt and hop were present. The taste was a very nice full bodied red ale that had good malt character with hints of hop that balanced the beer very well. The mouthfeel was good and certainly will try this again if I can find it in my local beer store."
"O - Very solid beer, that is on the verge of great. A bit more aroma and carbonation (probably not Green Flashes fault) and this would be exceptional...still very, very good."
"Overall, I consider this to be an Amber/IPA hybrid that, to me at least, is closer to the IPA side of things. It has the malts and color of an amber, but the hops profile of an IPA which definitely stands out more. It definitely lives up to its name. A nice hybrid, but there are definitely individual Ambers and IPAs I would prefer to the Hop Head Red. That being said, I would have it again and it is an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark ruby red hue which leaves a two finger creamy head and heaps of clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is medicinal piney hops,boiled candy and sweet toffee,the mouthfeel is medium bodied,sticky and resinous with tastes of piney medicinal hops,grapefruit,orange zest,boiled candy,sticky toffee,a touch of marzipan and finished with a sticky piney bitterness and overall it looks brilliant smells alright and tastes good and with a few tweaks could could be right up there would buy again though cheers."
"O: Pretty good amber ale. A little too hop-forward for my taste as far as ambers go. Very smooth though, and it looks fantastic."
"O: This is a good beer, and some time ago I think it might have been seen as a very good beer. For me I think my palate has gone more places, but I respect the fact that this is one of those southern California session beers that craft and BMC people alike could appreciate. For what it is, it's hard not to appreciate it. That said, it comes off a bit too tame to me now. Still a good combination of resiny pine and light candy sweetness, not hard to drink at all."
"O - This is an outstanding red ale. I really was impressed with this one, although it really could just be called an IPA."
"O/D: A great beer! Very hoppy but not out of balance; pretty drinkable, too - quite a bit of taste packed into this 6.4% beauty."
"Pours a deep copperish red color with nice head... Smells like fresh hops, piney. citrus/green apple. This beer starts out with a faint sweetness.. nice smooth mouth feel... good carbonation.. then come the hops... and finishes very bitter. I really like this beer... at first I was kind of skeptical because I do not like their west coast IPA.. so I'd say go out and try it.. it's really good!"
"Overall this is an above average brew and worthy of a go. The sediment doesn't bother me but may be a turn off for others."
"Overall I expected more from this. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I wanted more West Coast IPA but got more Red. My bad. This brewery doesn't have misleading labels. Their West Coast IPA is named West Coast IPA. A must try if you can."
"Pours a translucent red-copper-brown color with an off-white head. The nose is toasted and caramel malts, with a backbone of hops. The flavor is layers of strong hoppiness and toasted malts, with the hoppiness being more dominant in the front and the malts in the finish. There is just a touch metallic flavor in the hops, but it is super minor. Mouthfeel is nice with a good body and a nice medium carbonation. Sits a touch sweet on the tongue. Overall, I think this beer is pretty decent. Substantial hoppiness for an Amber. I am enjoying it probably more than I will rate it, but it is nice on a hot day. High overall as it was a great beer to grab a 4 pack of and drink it all."
"OVERALL: This is a strong and complex beer that keeps things interesting. Each sip allows the drinker to learn something more about the beer."
"Reddish amber color,red to the light.Foggy.Ivory foam.Close & dense.Good retention & nice lacing rings left.Yeast & slightly hoppy aroma.Toasted malt hints.Malty flavor,gentle bitterness.Coffee notes at the second sip!!.Smooth bitterness on the aftertaste.Refreshing.Wonderful drinkability.Some hops makes sunny & hot days worth living.Say ""thank you Amarillo"""
"Great beer, although a bit pricey. If it were a bit more reasonably priced, I'd probably buy it on the regular."
"overall this beer is good but it is one and done for me...."
"A very nice red with ample hops to drown out the typical too-malty red style. Worthy of multiple pints and should please most hop heads as the name indicates."
"nice compromise of the two styles."
"Hop Head Red is a bit too pricey to enjoy on a regular basis, which is a shame as it's a real pleasure to drink."
"O: This beer is as advertised. Hop Head Red has more of a bitter edge than many of the beers that boast these bloated, high IBU levels. I am SHOCKED to discover that this beer has a meager 45 IBUs, making this beer a real curiosity."
"Pretty unique here and it does what it says on the label. Like it but the straddling of styles gives me the impression of being sort of four square. Despite the minor whinge this is still prettty fannytastic."
"M: medium to strong body, lighty carbonated and rich."
"O: This is a well balanced beer from a brewery that I find to be in love with hops and hoppy beers. I too love hops and over-the-top IPAs, but I really appreciate when a brewer can put together a well-balanced and very drinkable IPA. This is one of those IPAs."
"One of my favs for the style. Super hoppy with that stylistic caramelly nuttiness and very quaffable. Excited for Green Flash's expansion and more to come."
"Overall - Very nicely hopped red ale. Good alternative to an IPA if you don't quite as much hops. Being a hophead, I really enjoyed this and would recommend it."
"Overall: A nice hoppy American Red. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a good hoppy beer, though I do find that several quick mouthfuls in a row produces a pine tar sensation at the back of the tongue that can be distracting. Sip slowly, then, and enjoy."
"O: The sweetness is a bit much for me. Two max, but the beer is obviously well crafted. Nice alternative to an IPA."
"I quite enjoyed this one; it should tempt me to get down to their new brewery/tasting room to try a few of their others out."
"O – This was the first offering that I’ve tried from Green Flash. I enjoyed it enough that I will be seeking out other styles from this brewery."
"Next to only NN in my book of hoppy reds, I've finally found a Green Flash beer I'm eager to drink again. Got a few bottles of it for the trip home."
"I like hoppy ambers much more than more traditional ambers. This one is pretty good, but a notch below the best."
"Notes: This beer is a full-flavored, full bodied red. Complex flavors, yet very well-balanced at the same time. Incredibly drinkable, yet it does show a bit of heat on the tail end. Nonetheless, it's a tasty brew."
"Overall this is a pretty good Red. Definitely better flavor, balance and depth than the Alpine Red I had the other day. It's a solid representation of the style although it's not my favorite. I do recommend a try though."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very good beer and definitely a hop forward version of the style. I really enjoyed the big hoppiness to it. Very solid beer all around."
"O: If I'm feeling Ambers for the night, definitely a beer I will gravitate towards in the store. Green Flash can't be wrong."
"Pours a hazy dark copper, lots of yeast dregs float around with an off color white / light tan head, it leaves a nice lacing. The smell is of pine hops and caramel malts. The feel is medium light, the initial taste is of hops, you get some of the caramel malts on the way down and then it leaves you with plenty of hop bitterness and a slight alcohol burn. Overall a pretty good beer but I prefer the flavor and higher hops of their regular IPA (the true hop head). I've been pretty impressed with the beers I've had from this brewery, I hope to be able to find more."
"Since it is more prevalent here and I am more familiar with Lagunitas, this beer has Lagunitas similarities- like brown shugga without the brown sugar or all the booze."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Deep reddish brown with a deep haze, actually similar in color to a dopplebock. Poured with a frosty off-white head that slowly reduces to a wispy cap and a few sticky lacings. Very fresh hop aroma, like sticking your nose in a bag of hop pellets. Floral and pine hop aromas along with caramelized malt. Medium bodied with a lighly resinous feel. Fresh floral hop flavor up front with a hint of citrus. Floral hop continues through the middle with the citrus flavors transitioning to pine and sweet carmelized malt coming thru. Pine hop and sweet malt flavors carry through to the end with a lingering pine hop bitterness. Complex aroma and flavor profile. This was awesome."
"This is an amber for IPA drinkers, and that's why I like it. Reminecient of a Nugget Nectar, but not quite as awesome. Not for the normal amber beer lovers, but a great brew nonetheless."
"Really happy to be able to get this one on a regular basis."
"I'd love to try it on tap some time."
"Solid brew. Find it and buy it."
"O - i've heard people say this is a decent comparison to nugget nectar, i hope thats not too true as i really want to try that one, and this beer is good but not really worth seeking out. i expected more of hop presence and even more malt i guess a much bigger beer. although i feel my expectations were too high and that may have hindered my experience, this is a well crafted brew nonetheless."
"HV"
"O- Awesome hoppy beer, i drank it a lot but i find fall is the best time of the year for this beer."
"A good mouthfeel, but I wouldn't want more than one of these at a time."
"If you like red ales, it's definitely worth a shot. Maybe my thoughts sound harsh.. it's well crafted, but simply average. I expected more from Green Flash."
"One of the best red/amber ale's around. Highly recommended."
"Notes: Maybe not the most impressive I have had from them. But in its sense of balance it sure is in the upper bracket. Maybe it is a touch too hoppy for not hoppy aficionados but it could be a nice and tasty entry point."
"That's not to say that there isn't any noticeable alcohol in this - there is but it doesn't detract from the taste. It took a while to get this beer down but if I wanted something with hops after dinner, this would fit the bill nicely. This beer has a bit of an acquired taste but it's well worth seeking out in a sea of hop-bombs and powerful brews. There's no doubt that this can appeal to quite a few segments of craft-beer enthusiasts."
"Little too bitter for me, good flavor gets a little buried and sidetracked."
"o: winner for me! great stuff from GF!"
"Looked and smelled nice, but ultimately a disappointing beer from Green Flash."
"O: There are very few who do these types of hop bombs quite like Green Flash. It was a pleasure to drink this!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. The brewer did a very good job in making it. Oh, and it did pair very well with the food."
"A red ale through and through. Balance is the name of the game here. A sweet malty start is followed by a hoppy aftertaste. A moderate carbonation level makes this an easy sipper. Not my favorite red, but something I would drink again"
"O: not that good of a beer. The flavor lacks depth and the very dry body is a bit odd for the style."
"very smooth and balanced. nice and bitter up front. some of the usual grapefruit and citrus. nice carbonation tingling on my tongue. wish this was fresh. PLEASE POST DAMB DATES."
"(12oz bottle). Pours hazy amber with thick off-white head. Nice lacing and light carbonation. Aroma of hard candy (like an orange tootsie pop), florals, and caramel. Taste is sweet malt with sharp hop bitterness and a bit spicy. Medium bodied with an oily texture. A pretty good beer, but not my prefered style."
"Other reviewers have noted its similarity to Nugget Nectar, and I have to agree - but was left feeling like this had a slightly harsher hop bite to it. Still a great pint, though I'm not sure I'd be willing to follow one with another."
"O - A solid red that I would drink again. Not better than West Coast IPA, but a good sub for Nugget Nectar in San Diego."
"Overall impression: An aptly named beer. Bests Nugget Nectar in the “this is basically a red IPA” category."
"Their west coast IPA is amazing!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. It is not a typical American Amber. Has the feel of a much bigger beer and lives up to its name."
"The CPJ"
"The liquid was reddish brown with a thin, bubbly, white head. The smell is sweet with caramel, grapefruit, sugar and a hint of peach. The taste consists of pine and mango with bready malt and a bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied, very smooth and it has a dry finish. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, the sweet malt is a perfect compliment to the amarillo hops."
"D: good example of an american amber but not my favorite. frankly i was a little turned off by the amount of hop particulate that was in my glass and i wasnt really blown away by any one aspect of the beer."
"O - Could be a little more flavoursome but worth a shot"
"O - an interesting beer, not one that i would session with but certainly tasty and was enjoyable with cheese and cold meats."
"Overall - Pretty interesting brew. A little complex and good-tasting."
"pours a deep amber, burnt orange with an off white cream tan head. Mellow malt aroma. Smooth malt start that collides with a hoppier finish. There's a light creamy middle that eases your way into the hop finish. Toasted malt provides a nice bite that compliments the hops. Can't really say much more about this beer. It's pretty good, one at a time. I wouldn't want to drink one after another. Probably pretty good with some mild spicy food."
"Food Pairing: Filled Pasta, Roasted Chicken, Roasted Pork, Munster Cheese, Goat Cheese, Sausage."
"This beer came around after a spell in the glass. Ultimately though, this was a yawn fest. Nothing stood out on it. Incredibly drab and boring. I see I'm the minority here on this review. I live in a state that makes Furious. This beer could not even be considered Furious's inbred cousin. Skip it."
"O=Very drinkable and satisfying"
"O Not may favorite Red Ale but far from bad I actually think it is pretty good and would drink another,"
"Overall a very good red ale for anyone not expecting a bland Killians. A delight for a hop head."
"D - The drinkability here is pretty good. It has nice flavor, and it goes down easy. I expected this one to be a little more hoppy. Overall, I think this is a good beer. I'd try it again, but I probably wouldn't pay for it again."
"I think this is a great beer. The only reason I didn't plow through the six pack I bought is so I could savor each bottle. I would buy this beer all the time were it available in Maine. For now, I'll just have to continue to make regular trips to NH."
"Good beer! I think I prefer the West Coast IPA for the sharper hops intensity."
"d: Just a delicious palate wrecker, I really enjoyed this."
"D: I'm am really diggin this beer, but I wouldn't expect anything else from one outstanding brewery. THis beer measures up to their West Coast IPA and Stout. I highly recomend."
"Malty, hoppy smell with some fruit notes coming through as well. Taste is is similar to the smell but MUCH bigger and maltier than I expected. Lots of sweetness comes through from the malt. Overall, a very clean beer that packs some great flavors. Aftertaste lasts for a solid 20 seconds as the hops go on and on."
"While I've not been terribly impressed with Green Flash brews in the past, this one is nicely bitter and tasty. Definitely recommend!"
"D-I'm not a huge red ale fan but I went into this open-minded.Just not as well-put together as I had hoped."
"Well done, guys. This is an above average amber that I'll be drinking again."
"Drinkabilty - It felt a little stronger then 6% which was impressive. You could drink many at a sitting for sure. Its very soild but lacks something to push it over the top. Maybe more malts? Another good beer from west coast but not there best."
"The beer pours a hazy reddish-brown color with a decent-sized tan head. The aroma is very heavy on the pine and grapefruit hops. I also get some malt mixed in, mainly bread with a little bit of toffee. The flavor is a mix of bread and biscuit malt with some pine from the hops. There is also some grapefruit and other tropical fruit mixed in. There is a medium amount of bitterness. The beer is very easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Aroma seems pretty linear...only some light unidentifiable hops, and only a faint whiff of that characteristic amber malt profile. The taste, however, is a little more smooth in comparison. Slight sting of bitterness, and a hint of lemon peel and brown sugar. Taste concludes with bitter orange. Bitter hops stick to the palate between tastes. Certainly a nice beer, but not my favorite Green Flash. Lagunitas Lucky 13 still wins my heart with red ales."
"D- Nothing unique about this one. It's a solid drink, one that I could throw down with a bunch of friends and have a good time."
"M-The body is unfiltered and gritty, fitting the aggressive hop explosion very well. Moderate carbonation and a sweet malty finish make is an awesome go to beer when you're in a hoppy mood. Great!"
"I'll drink the other bottle I have, but I won't go out of my way for more of this beer. Green Flash is pretty hit or miss for me, and mostly miss. Ballast Point is still king of the San Diego scene in my eyes."
"Pours a really nice dark amber/deep red grapefruit color with a big off-white head. Great lacing and retention. Grapefruit aroma, hint of sweet malt as well. Pretty big hop bitterness to start. Some hidden citrus hops, but mostly big pine and earthy notes. This is followed by a thick, creamy caramel malt with just a speckle of toffee flavor. Hop bitterness comes full circle on the finish."
"D - Overall much better than the Green Flash ""west coast IPA"" but still overly hopped with a solid malt balance. I can't say its worth the A rating but at least its drinkable."
"The theory behind this beer is that the sweet, malt characteristics of a red ale would balance out a substantial IPA bitterness and a huge IPA dry hopping. For the most part, this works, but sometimes the hops overrun the malty body. The body has a medium consistency, but still hints at oily hops. The malts are indeed sweet and bold, but each sip easily yields to floral and piny hops. Several minutes after a sip my mouth still tastes like it was dry hopped, which is spectacular for a hop-lover like me, but probably won't work for everybody. This is definitely an intriguing beer, but you shouldn't try Hop Head unless you qualify as one."
"Try this beer."
"Re-revisited again 8-18-11. Still great stuff!"
"D - I like it. Great example of how a beer should be built for a hop lover."
"Wow- The taste of this beer is fantastic. Hops are there in force, but the malt, caramel and orange are there as well. Really well done! This is the first time I've tried this beer, and it doesn't disappoint. The mouthfeel is also fantastic- hoppy, creamy, caramel, bitter and smooth at the same time. Some roasted malt in there as well. Drinkability is pretty good, but I think I would stop at two for maximum enjoyment. I love the Green Flash West Coast IPA, so I figured I'd love this one too. Great beer that I will definitely pick up again!"
"D: Heavy malt base make this quite filling and the spicy alcohol character and hop bitterness/resin make this a slow drinker for just 6% alcohol."
"In terms of palate, carbonation is pretty strong and aftertaste is nicely clean and bitter. Love the body of it, as it is smoothly solid and very easy to drink."
"D - I know this tastes more along the lines of a pale ale with the large hop profile however this has to be the best ""red"" ale!! Not as balanced as I would have thought between the hops and malt but nonetheless an awesome tasting beer. Highly sessionable!!"
"D: I was a supreme advocate of hop heavy IPA's (I know this is technically a red ale). However, now a find balance is what I've been appreciating more. This beer is a fine balance of what you'd look for with lots of West Coast hopping with a good malt base. Lacks a bit in complexity."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Clear medium amber red color with a large, frothy, good lacing, mostly lasting, off-white head. Aroma is moderate to heavy malty, caramel, moderate to heavy hoppy, pine, grapefruit, orange. Flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter with a long duration. Body is medium, texture is oily to watery, carbonation is soft. A great Red Ale that's among my favorites!"
"Poured a reddish amber brown with pale brown highlights and had a thin bubbly head leaving a little lacing sticking to the glass. There was lost of piney grassy hops in the aroma with plenty of malty sweetness, citrusy, nutty, and mild boozy notes. The piney hop character was also dominating the palate with cirusy, nutty, caramel, grassy accents and a good sweet malty balance but had a touch of booze to round out this brew. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, citrusy, piney hoppy, slighty nutty, and crisp finish. It was drinking very good and was really tasty. This brew was my favorite of the bunch when I hit the brewpub this past weekend."
"D- Excellent. I had this after my disappointing encounter with a Northwest brand's IPA and it reassured my confidence in west coaster's ability to craft damn fine hoppy beers, even if it technically is a red. Maybe not? Had half the brew by itself and finished the rest of it with spicy stir fry. Awesome pairing!"
"Taste-Toasted malt, caramel, good strong hop bite that follows you to the finish. A tasty, hoppy red ale that would be a good match for spicy fare. Buffalo wings or tacos come to mind."
"Overall, this beer is trying to do too much. The overall hoppiness balanced with the red ale style gives a less refreshing, and more palate confusing beer. It is interesting, and there are some unique flavors here, but it seems to be just off the mark."
"Overall - An exceptional Amber Ale and one of my favourite US beers..."
"D - Pretty good, perhaps a bit sweet for my tastes."
"It pours a dark red and was a little lighter than I was expecting. I'm a fan of the taste throughout."
"Overall I like this beer, and would recomend"
"M: Soft mouthfeel, but a very thin, watery beer."
"D - Pretty decent session beer not noticing any strong alcohol taste...all in all a pretty good offereing from Green Flash...I would drink it again forsher."
"Popurs a deep rusty red that's slightly hazy with some yeast floaties meandering about. Light tan head doesn't last long. The aroma is abundant with both grapefruit and caramel. There's also some floral hoppiness and a hint of chocolate. This extends into the taste as well. It doesn't really get to a point where one smell or taste dominates the other. Pretty well balanced, I guess. I don't get a lot of pine, personally, but it is there if you look for it. Rich and creamy with a slightly resinous feel to this medium leaning toward full bodied beer. Goes down extremely easy. While I appreciate the well balanced nature of this beer, with a name like Hop Head I expected it to be completely hop dominant. All in all, it's a good beer, I was just hoping for a different profile."
"D: Higher than I would expect from the smell. Smoother drink than your average Red Ale."
"Another great Green Flash!"
"I really enjoyed this beer and I'm especially glad that I had it on tap. Everything about it was enjoyable, including the color and head on this beer, which was superb and perfect. Also worth noting is that this beer has an IPA, almost DIPA feel to it."
"Wet (versus dry mouthful). Medium to full bodied in flavor. Slight amount of alcohol heat mixed with a wave of fresh, pine-filled hops. Very refreshing, a meal in a bottle! (I know because it was my dinner tonight :)"
"Heady brewing company. Like a hoppy Founders (who makes excelent similarly priced malty beers.)"
"Great refreshing beer from Green Flash. I got my daily hop fix from this one."
"Drink - A really good brew; it reminded me of a scaled down version of Pliny the Elder. Worth seeking out."
"Overall, this is a beer that every serious hop head needs to check out. That said, I wish it were a bit maltier. I like reds for the malt and even though I expected this to be hoppy, I didn't expect it to be THIS hoppy. Still, definitely worth checking out and I'll probably end up having this guy again. Cheers!"
"D: a little underwhelming. As mentioned in the taste, I would characterize this as one of many hop bombs out there. Nothing much distinguishes this from the masses, and I'm not sure what is red about this apart from the color, but it also has decent drinkability, so I can't hate on it too much. My only critique is that it's a little unoriginal and it fails to deliver as a red ale."
"Overall a nice balanced red ale."
"12oz bottle with no Freshness date. Pours a murky rust color with some sediment floating around. No head and some good lacing. Great aroma of piney hops. Slight hint of malts. Taste is more of that big hop aroma. A good piney flavor with a nice bitterness. This is a great hoppy red ale."
"Hop Head Red is one of those beers that strikes you because it keeps up the high hopping levels that I love in a beer while teaming it with a great malt profile that supports the beer and the hops. The pour is good with a nice, fluffy off-white head contrasting with the red body. The aroma combines those citrussy West Coast hops with a light bit of malt (and unfortunately a touch of dustiness). The flavour comes down to a balance between citrussy, piney, resinous hops and the caramel, toffee malts of the red ale. The body is neither thick nor insipid which is nice in a beer like this and it helps to make it feel like you can drink more."
"When IPAs have gotten too monotonous, this is a great beer to turn to."
"D - Even though very good this is really the only category that leaves something to be desired. While these are very easy to drink, I feel they could sit a wee bit better with my palette. Overall, an amazing brew."
"D-- Well hidden ABV and just plain drinkable. Can have 2 bombers easily and would want more. One of the styles Australian breweries just do not do and they should."
"D - I could drink this all day long. Until I fall over anyway."
"Drinkability is high. Good solid flavor, and the ABV is reasonable to session. The price is high for this brewer in my area, which doesn't necessarily influence my score, but is a little unfortunate."
"Excellent drinkability. The flavors are a little two dimensional, but each element is executed extremely well. I wasn't expecting this brew to make as much of an impression as the West Coast IPA, but was very pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is a nice solid medium-bodied beer that is smooth and creamy going down. Drinkability is high, this is an extremely balanced beer that is not too heavy and flat out nice all the way around."
"D - Drinkability is relatively high. Nothing really detracts from the beer too much, and is balanced to the point of preserving the palate, but it doesn't really push any envelopes. For a beer in this price point, I'd definitely be looking for more distinguishing characteristics. The beer is good, but not really memorable."
"Poured with a giant, foamy, frothy, fluffy, light tan head that lasts a long time, lots of big bubble trails, and loads of lace. Color is an almost clear red medium amber. Aroma is hop, grapefruit, pine, and a little malt. Flavor is like aroma, plus a little butter, wet leather. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor and very long with lingering hop bitterness. Not as balanced as I'd prefer, but not bad. Don't think I'll have another for a while."
"IMHO This drinks like a good brown ale that has a generous addition of hops. makes it interesting. Not a bad brew if you like both brown ales, and hoppy style brews."
"D: A nice beer all around. A really tasty green flash treat!"
"D: A good beer I'd drink again. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the Green Flash West Coast I.P.A. I just had, however."
"Pours a dark reddish amber with a large beige head that left a ton of lacing. Nice bright citrusy hops with a little bit of a resiny accent. Lots of caramel maltiness here too. Biting bitterness hits you right away and never lets go. The maltiness emerges mid swallow with some caramel and crystal malt. Pretty full bodied with a fairly thick texture and a slight resiny stickiness on the finish. Nice soft fizzy carbonation. A nice hoppy red that's as hoppy as an IPA..."
"Picked up a six pack of this one for ten bucks, and I was very excited to try it as this brewery has rarely let me down. Here, they continued to impress. Pours a dark reddish-orange color with a half inch or so of medium tan head. Good hops here, both on the nose and on the palate. A Piney, grapefruity (and other assorted citrus) nose leads nicely to a well-balanced palate, featuring more of the same, along with caramel and a little dark brown sugar. Very enjoyable."
"Poured into and 8oz, sampling glass. Pours a nice orange -redish color. clarity is great considering its a bottle conditioned beer. Head retention is great a 1/4 inch he is still present 5 minutes after pouring in glass. Smell is of piney, grassy, hops with a hint of earthiness. thinking citrussy hops such as amarillo and simcoe. First sip i get a strong bittering hops, get more of the citrus hop present in the back of the palate, caramel notes are present at the end of the drink, very little malt character is present in this beer. The bitterness does not linger in the mouthfeel as does an ipa. Overall this is a great example of a west coast red ale. I would buy this on a regular basis if i could have access to this beer more often."
"Good drinkability, and an all around great red!"
"Not my favorite of this style (this is my favorite style by the way) but I'm definitely a fan."
"D: This beer delivers fresh hop flavors but is able to pair with most foods better than an IPA. The intensity of flavors here are comparable to those of many imperial red ales, such as Oskar Blues Gordon, while the abv remains in the neighborhood of the typical IPA. As a result, the drinkability found here is truly superior."
"D: Viciously hoppy and delicious. I think this little number may have redefined ""agressively hopped."""
"12oz. bottle served in my Harpoon IPA willibecker. No freshness dating. Pours a deep, semi-translucent, amber with a rocky, two inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap. Delicate clumps of sticky lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose is pretty subdued but implies caramel malt, citrus and an earthy hops quality. Taste consistent with nose; flavors are nicely interwoven. Malt comes out initially, followed by citrus acidity towards the middle, and culminating in an earthy bitterness towards the back that lightly lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively, almost prickly carbonation and some astringency that lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the cheeks. A very good Amber - perhaps a little slanted towards the bitter end of the spectrum, but solid and quite drinkable."
"I was slumming around looking for the last remnants of some nugget nectar. I was able to pick some up last weekend but I guess that was the end. So I came across this so called Red IPA. Overall a good beer. First pour was excellent dark amber with a great lasting head. First taste was very caramel and malt with a hoppy after taste. Could use a bit more carbonation. As drinking continued it lost the sweet and hung on to the bitter without the spice notes of solid hops and more bitter from unripened citrus. I would recommend if you can't find the nectar but not at all its replacement."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer and something I would recommend to try."
"Poured a reddish amber as suggested. Lots of head and great lacing through the glass. Tons of citrus hop aromas. Actually balnced. nice beer. Had a soapy finish but it did not ruin the beer. Very nice."
"Nice mouthfeel. Slightly sticky, with medium carbonation level that complements the beer nicely."
"The hops faded too fast and the malt was a bit boring to keep me intrigued. though there is little to no alcohol burn, and no off flavors or anything detrimental, it just comes up a bit short of being amazing. above average? yah."
"Pours a lovely redish brown color with perfect cap of soapy off white head, good retention and amazingly sticky lacing. Scent is hops hops and more hops... heavy notes of pine, aggressive rye like spice, fresh cut grass, herbal tea. Taste brings exactly what the scent dictated... hugely aggressive hoping, very fresh but simply off putting. Faint notes of a heavy carmel backbone do little to cover the taste. Heavier side of medium bodied with a coating presence and long libgering spicy aftertaste. Not for me at all."
"Appearance is a darker red/amber, good amount of carb, nice 1 finger's worth of white/reddish head. Smells are caramel malts, slight citrus and pine hops. Tastes are sweet5 malts then hops with a bitter hop finish, good! Mouthfeel is kinda thick and syrupy. Drinkability is good."
"I have to remember this one. First rate hop head stuff."
"D - A good red to be sure, Hop Head blends the hops and malts nicely together without being on one side or the other. This would pair well with some original brats and crisp fall weather."
"O - Beer is refreshing and delicious and very easy to drink. In my opinion it is up there in the style. This battle Founders REds Rye PA for my favorite beer of all time."
"I don't love Red Ales, but this is a really good beer--not Nugget-Nectar-good--but really good."
"Definitely a mish-mash of styles, a decent red ale hopped to the nuts. Tasty stuff."
"This was my first Green Flash beer and if the rest of theirs are as good as this one, I'll definitely become a follower."
"There should be more beers like this. I'm tired."
"Pours dark, muddy red like ocean clay topped by milky off-white head. Gorgeous aroma of citrus notes, wet hops, grass, mint, lemon, and soap. Deep flavor of hops, citrus, spice, lemon, some soap, some earth in the aftertaste. Thick in mouthfeel with medium carb but highly enjoyable and drinkable for any season. A great accompaniment to my turkey dinner as well. Real good ale."
"A nice drinkable caramel malt amber ale hopped to what seems like 70+ ibus. A most enjoyable brew if you like amber ales and hops."
"Pours a deep dark red. two finger head which quickly disappeared. Good amount of malt, carmel, citrusy. Thick bodied. Good balance on the bitterness. Just gets better as it warms. Very drinkable. There's just something about amber beers that are hopped up that I definately like!"
"Easy drinking but unique enough to want to savor."
"Pours a beutiful cloudy brick color.Nice foamy head with delicate lacing. Nose is a strong hoppy smell. not unlike their West Coast IPA. This is obviously a blend of styles as they've brought IPA like hoppiness to the often moribund Red Ale category. As with all blends however, there are compromises. This is especially notable in the maltiness which tends to neutralize the complexity that is so successful in the WCIPA. Still, it is an excellent looking beer which elevates the often lame Red Ale to a higher status. While I'd choose the WCIPA over this one, it's still a damn fine effort."
"All aspects of this beer were solid yet unspectacular. Glad I tried it but would pick other Green Flash brews over this one if I had the choice."
"A red IPA, as the label succintly suggested."
"So nice! Drinks way hoppier than the 45 IBUs. Might not quite be up to Rocket Red, though...."
"Big, whipped up head passing two fingers, mixture of all bubble sizes, craters as much as dimples, basic tan to eggshell white color, better retention than you'd think given the larger bubbles, plenty of small splashes of lacing here and there. Nicely rich amber color, fully opaque, slightly more orange at the rims, tiny beads here and there, looks like there could be a catfish living in there. The nose has a welcome relaxed quality about it, semi-laconic unfolding of malts, caramel and milk chocolate segueing into pine, sweet and sour grapefruit to orange citrus, spring blossoms and a croissant, danish flakiness, the green nature of the hops bristles without lunging for your jugular. Medium-bodied, the carbonation adds a slow churn that allows for both palate pressure and measured pacing forward. This is a dry and hoppy beer, no doubt, simply not out to bludgeon you with the fact, gets grassy and piney while always leaving room for chocolate, toffee, bread and caramel. Orange to white grapefruit citrus is tight and lean, neither decisively sweet nor sour. The apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, green apple fruit ekes out a marginal presence, not a focal point. it's not keenly balanced but better for it, particularly with the general lack of pushiness. A hop head beer that you don't have to be a hop head to enjoy."
"This is a wonderful beer and I can only imagine how good it would be fresh from the source or on tap."
"This is one of those wow beers. I cracked open the bottle, poured into my Sam Adams glass, loved the scarlet red opaque translucent glow, after of course being greeted by a nice floral, citrusy, resinous Amarillo hop whiffs!Call it a wow beer cause I couldn't stop saying, wow, this is nice! How nice! The only other beer that I know uses Amarillos like this is Gumballhead, they are a nice, fruity hop, grapefruity hop, with a slightly spicey edge to them. This beer has a great balance to it for such a hoppy ale, due to the reddish malts, which add a touch of sweetness. Beer has a thick, rocky head with lacing that sticks all of over the glass. The beer is not so much just another big IPA, but complex, red ale. The mouthfeel is very full with oilyness from all the drop hopping. I can't say these are extremely drinkable at 6.4 abv cause there is a thickness to this one....you owe yourself a six pack of these now."
"As I mentioned before, this beer has an identity crisis. It's either an extremely hoppy American red ale or an IPA with a strange flavor profile. Neither of these would be a bad thing, especially because these two styles have a lot in common, but by straddling them both this beer ends up a bit bland. I'd like to have it again, but since Green Flash already makes a really nice IPA I'd probably just be content with that."
"D- The fact that the hoppiness sits on your tongue prevents you from knocking back a few, but one or two would not be a problem at all."
"D - Pretty good, but the sweetness keeps it from being a knockout for me."
"Bought a single; beginning to think I should've got the 6-pack. This and their West Coast IPA make a great tag team."
"D- Dry finish to compliment the sweetness. Quite drinkable."
"Excellent beer, a must try if you haven't yet."
"If the color wasn't red it could have been a DIPA for my behalf."
"A highly hopped amber ale that lacked the dusty notes that I sometimes find in amber ales."
"Notes: Very nice amber ale, and exceptionally easy to drink"
"OVERALL: A really solid offering from Green Flash. A red ale combined with some IPA qualities. This one is plenty hoppy with more bitterness than the IBU suggested. One I'd have again for sure."
"I think this is a really nice beer."
"Pours a tawny 1-finger head that dies slowly on top of a reddish brown body. More hoppy than malty in the aroma; leafy, citric hops are prevelant but still some mild caramel sweet malt in there as well. If you want an IPA/hop fix with your reds go w/ this beer b/c while their is mild sweet malt and a biscuity/breadiness there for a slightly chewey medium body, there is a distinct hop bite that is sharp and leads to a real dry finish. A good beer but it's more of a ""mild IPA"" than a red/amble ale."
"D - Very drinkable with the good taste, lightish mouthfeel and a dry, flavorful finish. One of the better well-hopped red ales. The bottle says they used Amarillo hops for the dry hopping. Comparable to a Founders Centenial IPA."
" D- The nice complexity of malt and big full green hops makes this big beer very drinkable. The fruity sweetness compliments the hops but the dry malt flavors keep it crisp with a nice depth."
"D: For a red ale, it definitely has character. Not very sessionable, though, because the hops dried out my mouth after a glass. However, I would buy it again, for sure."
"Overall, a very solid beer from G.F. Not sure I would seek this out over the IPA, but I am very impressed with the great blending of malt flavors here. If you're at all curious, don't hesistate to give this one a try."
"D-great refreshment on a hot day. A nice switch from the IPA's I've been addicted to lately (while still staying with hoppy beers)."
"thumbs up to my second green flash brew."
"Poured a clear dark brown color with an average fizzy white head that was mostly lasting and had good lacing. Good citrus hoppy & malty aroma. Medium body with slick texture. Heavy bittersweet smooth flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. Good brew."
"Redish Amber color with a lasting finger of head. This is a very balanced beer, with alot more hops then any other Red Ale i've yet had, but after the initial sip the Hops fade and malt is still lingering, with a caramel sweetness, and i'm getting some cinnamon and spices hidden in there as well. there is a subtle earthyness or mineral quality in there, which i cant tell if it's from the malt used or water, but most likely the malt. the mouth feel has a light-medium carbination that fades with the hops into a smooth light syrupy texture and doesn't leave the cleanest feeling. This beer has a pleasing aroma and flavor profile but for my subjective tastes is lacking the mouthfeel i desire to get through more then a single bottle in a sitting."
"D: This beer can be considered sessionable given its low alcohol content."
"overall: another winner from green flash do they brew a beer that is just average? I don't think so they always brew stuff that is good great or blows me away and this beer was great!"
"One of the better amber's I've had, but nothing special overall."
"D - Aftertaste fades quickly, actually too quickly. Agaist the amber style, I quite like it, but looking at it from the point of an IPA, it is surely a more middle ground."
"Green Flash makes great beer. What is it about San Diego?"
"D: Very nice hoppy example of a red...I love this beer!!"
"The feel of this beer is pretty drinkable and goes down well but does leave a bitter aftertaste. It is harsh and it might be a good idea to have a glass of water nearby just to make sure it make not feel too bitter. A great hop experience all in all."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer. Great aroma, and a change from the usual IPA for a hoppy fix. I'd have it again, although I'd probably be more likely to go for their West Coast IPA."
"Notes: Wow what a hop bomb I am dam glad I picked this one up. Cheers."
"D- I could drink these all evening if I didn't have to wake up for work."
"I hope there's Hop Head in Heaven!"
"D: A very delicious example of the style. Fairly-nice complexity in an emerging style that is one of my favorites."
"One finger tan head, fairly slow dissipation, significant lacing. Reddish amber clear body, multiple trails of carbonation rising from bottom of the glass. Pretty balanced nose, caramel malts vs. piney and floral hops, neither dominates. Taste is pretty sweet up front, a bit of melon sweetness, but sharp hop hit in the middle, finish is a bit bitter. Mouthfeel is full, good effervescence. Pretty drinkable. Not my favorite Red Ale, but certainly quite tasty, a nice San Diego interpretation of the style. Recommended."
"d: Good drinkablity, one that I would get again. I like the 22oz format, which is good for sampling and sharing with friends."
"Drinkability: Hophead's delight. Definitely not a typical amber ale, but I like Green Flash's hold-nothing-back approach with the hops, but the monster hop flavor slows me down a little bit."
"D - In small amounts sure. This is true to its name, but make sure it's what you want."
"Also, Id like to do another rating on this when I grab another bottle, right now at a B- Id like to take a bit more time to really take this one in."
"Drink: This can be very tough to drink or very easy depending on how you drink it. The bitterness can be overwhelming if you let it build up on your palate, as to be expected from a beer dubbed ""hop head"". A careful tasting will find a lot more in the rich malt character than if its gulped down in a session."
"D - A decent amber hoppy beer. I'm not sure if it's the fruit or the malt... but something comes in a bit sharp for me. I'm just being picky here though... a great beer overall."
"Pours a nice amber color with a one finger white head present which gives way to some nice lacing. Lots of sediment is present. The aroma is of citrus hops and a hint of pine hops over top of a backbone of sweet malt and caramel malts. The taste has a solid sweet and caramel malt backbone with a hint of rye. Up front cirtus hops hit you with a hint of pine, the taste isn't dry though like an ipa. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall its a very drinkable amber ale, a nice amount of flavor and aroma to keep you interested. A good beer to enjoy over and over."
"Notes: I like my hoppy reds to have a stronger malt foundation. This is good stuff, just not my preference for the style. Call it a ""San Diego Red Ale"" and it makes sense."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty drinkable."
"This beer is fairly drinkable but has enough teeth to it to not make you need more."
"D: a very nice hoppy offering from Green Flash, lives up to its name... this one leans a bit on the bitter side for me to consider it highly drinkable, but overall a great beer with a bit more balance than their West Coast IPA"
"My bottle may not be very fresh, so I would like to try this one fresh to see the difference in the hop profile."
"Pretty good if you like your ambers hoppy."
"Maybe this bottle was not up to snuff, as I was expecting a lot more from this red. Will have to re-review if I can get it vom Fass or frisch abgefüllt."
"D: I would be more than willing to review this again, maybe on tap? This was just a disappointing experience for me."
"Really, I wanted to like this beer because the mouthfeel and aroma were so good as well as the malt tastes. However, by the bottom of the glass I couldn't really see my self having another."
"D= Good Hoppy red ale. I could drink a few more of these."
"Overall: A powerful, punchy, well-balanced beer. Like many of the well-reviewed ambers, it's a little hops-forward for the style, but the hop flavors are beautiful and complex."
"Poured into a straight-sided pint glass. Very hazy red. Lots of lace. Smells of fruity Amarillo hops, but not as much as I thought it might. Very smooth, with fruity hop flavors, caramel and coffee in the mix. Fruity, soft, moderately bitter finish. A touch oxidized. Very drinkable. Hop was generally more fruity than specifically citrusy."
"Overall: This beer reminds me a lot of a lower alcohol American Barleywine. It about as rich and sweet as it could be to maintain a good level of drinkability but I had no problem with this one. Nice hop character, bold but not harsh or enough to overwhelm the malts. Really great beer."
"Mouthfeel, remains consistent, but weakens in a tiny amount. Drinkable, maybe not for a typical red drinker, but I liked it a lot."
"This is drinkable, but not as balanced as my favorite ambers. If you want hops without any complexity, this one is for you."
"Notes: A unique beer that grew on me more as it warmed. The last 1/3 of the beer was amazing."
"The medium to full body was nice and sticky and had a fluffy/ cottony texture. The carbonation was sharp and the finish was dry and tingly. This beer beer seems the perfect hybrid of a good IPA and a full flavored rich Red Ale. Awesome beer"
"D - An out of style hop forward Red Ale, made for hop lovers. Well I liked it but it wasn't great to me, I was very disappointed in the absence of the malts in the both aroma/taste. I suppose I could drink a couple pints before I grew tired of it, but If I want an Amber than okay, if I want an IPA than I'll get one. I have to say this one didn't please me, great brewery & I loved there IPA, but I still don't recommend it."
"I've always liked a well-hopped red but this is the first one that really matches the intense bitterness and aroma a lot of top-notch pales feature. I don't if its the darker and sweeter malts that drown it out in other beers but for once the hops stand out and make this a hop head's red. It pours with a nice light off-white head and light to medium amber color. Naturally the flavors change as the beer goes on and by the end the hops mellow and you get more of the caramel character you normally see in a red ale. Worth a pint or two at any bar."
"taste is smooth and creamy, grapefruit, citrus, caramel, some pine, and pepper, ends a little bitter."
"I would reccomend this beer to anyone who enjoys red ales or IPA's as I feel it is a near perfect blend of these two styles."
"D - Very drinkable. I would not hesitate to recomend this to IPA fans or anyone for that matter. I would definately buy this beer again."
"Brew poured to a brown color with red/amber highlights, quite cloudy and also has a lot of floating sediment. Has a one-finger light tan head that seems to have good retention and left some good lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma here is strong of hops and they are very enticing, the dry hopping with the Amarillo gives a nice floral scent. In the background I think I am picking up some roasted and caramel malt aromas. The flavor is very good, hops dominate and give a real nice flavor, very floral in flavor and seem to tail off to a almost tea like flavor. The hop resin seems to coat the tongue and wants to stick around as for several minutes after I still taste hops. The malt is hard to pin point except for a sweet feel that is there. While this brew is not balanced IMO, it does have a great flavor profile and is easy to drink. Nice offering from Green Flash."
"Nothing has described the aroma and flavor so well to me as fresh cut grass. It is unlike a lot of the typical west coast styles that are using more ""C" hops. It has a different, less citrus flavor."
"Poured into a sampler glass. Nice red/ amber color with a decent head that quickly goes to a thin ring. Not much lacing. Very herbal and hoppy aroma, pine scented too. Very powerful flavor that just was not for me. Tasted like fresh mowed grass, hoppy grass that is and an herbal tea. Maybe this one did not mix well with the other beers in this session for me. I will say my son loved it."
"Fantastic. My new favorite red ale. To be fair, I haven't had any notibly great red ales, but this is a good brew regardless. Imperial Red? I.R.A.? A great beer regardless."
"D- This beer is definitely quaffable while still being very tasty and full of flavor. Green Flash is a new brewery for me but after trying their lineup of beers, I am now a big fan. They are making some gooood stuff."
"Wow. This beer redefines the red category for me. First, it is an immaculately crisp red color- quite impressive under the light. The nose has a little to be desired, but that's not really a high point of the style anyway. After that, though, it's phenomenal. The sweet malt comes through just enough to be a perfect complement to the Amarillo hops. Having homebrewed with Amarillo before, I was excited to see how they came through in this Red, and they did not disappoint. Do yourself a huge favor and buy a bottle (or six)."
"D-this beer is pretty awesome! i forgot how good this was. big flavors, a touch of malt and then an onslought of hops! top notch for the style!"
"D: This beer is light and refreshing, but also has great flavor and depth. I could drink these all night."
"The flavour is nicely balanced. 45 IBUs deliver a nice floral and juicy citrus bitterness, but its more than countered by a rich caramel and sweetbread body. the tropical fruit come into play with hints of lychee and mango, also adding to the sweetness. All of this culminates ina dry finish with a light lingering bitterness. Medium body and carbonation seems about right. I could imagine this being a nice easy drinking beer that I could drink a few of in an evening."
"Overall, a very good brew, one worth some effort to try if it's not readily available to you. I'll have to try a couple more of this breweries beers to see if the hype is true, and I'll be happy to do so."
"drinkability is ok - there are better reds out there - i was expecting more since GF's IPA is one of the best"
"Cheers!"
"D: True to style, a very nice balance of hops and malt, very easy to drink. It will be interesting to see if the other bottles in the sixer have chunks as well. Like it, don't love it. Worth trying."
"Pours a dark yet clear copper amberWith a great, well sustained head and foam. Cathedral like lacin sticks to my glass after each sip.Smells like super rich hop oil. Almost like they through a ton of hops in the brew kettle and some hop oil as well. Maybe just a hint of bread in the aroma. A bit too oily smelling for my taste. The taste and palate are hop oily and a carbonated hop oil with maybe some bread. The hops are just a bit over done and just linger on my palate way to long. For a beer I was thinking might be sessionable, is just almost oppressive to my nose and palate."
"If the six-pack goes on sale GET it!"
"D- a fine drinking beer, nicely balanced yet a bit more on the hoppy side, a delicious amber all around"
"D- Hoppy American red ales rock my world and this is no exception"
"D: Damn this is a good brew. A bit hoppier than I usually tend to go, but I find this very well balanced with a hop bite, and a good sweet malty overtone. Well done fellas, I would definitely buy this again."
"Drinkability - Really glad I was talked into picking up a six pack of this because it's fantastic and will certainly be picking up more. It has a great amount of character and personality but low enough in abv to be enjoyed as a session beer."
"My first from Green Flash."
"I really enjoyed this beer. The combination of IPA level Amarillo with rich, malty, dark ale is awesome. Makes me want more and makes we want to check out more Green Flash brews!"
"Pours an amber color that for the most part would have been clear but a slightly ignorant pour made the yeast come up a bit from the bottom of the bottle and cloud the clarity up a bit. Almost a full 2 finger head sits on top of this brew with fair retension and a bold amount of lace all over the place. Sweet malt aroma is paired nicely with citrus and floral hops. Taste is what the nose leads on, a nice mix of both malt sweetness and hop bitterness in the finish. Linger bitter taste is somewhat resinous and warming. Lightly carbed and a med to light feel. Very nice brew."
"Always love a good amber or red ale. This one has a very nice rose color, with not a whole lot of heading. From the nose, one can smell the Amarillo hops (one of my favorites), and some caramel. Taste is damn, very hoppy, much hoppier than I was expecting. I love hoppy beers like this that are really really bitter. This one is dry, hoppy, and did I mention hoppy? Mouthfeel is about medium, with the malt barely noticeable (at least for me). Drinkability is pretty damn awesome, but it will kill your taste buds without a doubt. This was a really nice surprise from Green Flash. It totally exceeded my expectations, and went particularly well with some jalapeno stuffed olives. Cheers"
"drinkability: good"
"D: Pretty high. It's super tasty and relatively low ABV, a nice little combination."
"D - A nice west coast red ale. The hop aroma is great, but the flavor is a bit subdued. Great malt character and a balanced finish. My only complaint is that the citrus character in the finish leaves a cloying acidity that sticks on the palate long after the beer is gone. A nice beer that I would certainly drink again, though I can't help but think that it could be better if it was fresher."
"D: Another fantastic Green Flash year-rounder. These west coast folks really know what they're doing with the hops!"
"D - Good and hoppy amber ale. Sharply bitter which tastes really good, but makes it hard to put down a lot of these. Very enjoyable beer, but I think in smaller quantities...but I wouldn't mind having another one soon."
"D: A nice beer, but I would probably try something else for a second drink."
"This is delicious and fresh tasting. Alcohol is not noticable at all. This is one of the better red ales out there."
"Good malt backbone to offset the hops, lighter feel than expected, good carbonation, nice drinker, but better with a spicy dinner than alone."
"D: Very good red ale. Tasty and I like the heavy hand on the hops as most red ales fall into the ""malty"" category. If I didn't know any better, I'd say this one could pass for an IPA."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a good bite of carbonation."
"D- very easy to sit back and enjoy a few of these. the bottle suggests that this is like a red IPA, and i think theyre dead on. check this out of you get the chance. i dont think it gets the respect it deserves."
"HOLY SHIT! This beer is DRY! I coughed after I drank it. I was not expecting that, how interesting. Hops are way more presents in this beer than the aroma would indicate. Drinkability of this beer is high (especially if you like dry beers). The dryness is so great that is interrupts my enjoyment of it, but I see hwat they are doing with it. There is an unfortunate aftertaste as well though. Another slight deduction. Check it out if you like hoppy reds that are dry, otherwise avoid."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - would definitely have again, a good alternative to an straight IPA"
"This is one great tasting red. Pine, citrus, the malts there but the hops just over power everything (I mean that in a good way). Should of bought more."
"Happily encountered at the Flying Saucer in Carlotte, NC, this great brew shows a dark brown root beer-ish color with a slight orange hint. The head is a very substantial light tan bit of topography that collapses into a thick lace. The aroma brings a very nice citrus pine blend over the sweet malt, very enticing. The first swig is WOW with crisp citrus bite that settles into some of that green pine that was evidenced in the aroma. The malt is a more bready variety and the woodsy pine really grows, taking on a medicinal tingle that is very likeable. The carbonation is lively and tasteful in a solid mid-bodied brew that is refreshing and dangerously drinkable. The hops are just lovely here as they settle in a dry sheen on your tongue with a pleasant horshound sort of sweetness. This is my style of red ale! Sweet and bitter married and mellowed, yet lively. Beautiful!"
"glassware: pint"
"M/ D - Medium, chewy mouthfeel. Great malts and nice fuity hop bitterness. Closer to APA, but tasty!"
"D - This beer is very drinkable. I could down a sixer (or two) without even thinking much about it."
"Taste is very bitter and and hoppy. Some citrus, grapefruit. This really seems like a dark IPA. Awesome beer, I'd seek this out on tap."
"Drinkability: This is a great hoppy red with good malt backbone. Its almost like a low alcohol barleywine. Really nice stuff."
"D - An okay beer, but a bit disapointing."
"- A very drinkable red ale... and different.. almost could be dubbed a west coast red ale.. although all the reds I have had like this are only from CA... OR reds are much different and not so caramelized."
"Recommended."
"D- If I had my eyes closed and tried this this 10 different times, I would havw guessed IPA (west coast style) every time...I don't think I would have ever have thought red. With that being said, its good and tastey. If you want a ""regular"" red/amber, not this one. If you want a tasty hoppy beer, this one."
"Overall, this seems to me like a hybrid style of beer that has some potential as either an IPA or an Amber Ale (does a new catagory need to be created for this??) They suggest Red IPA on the bottle but I don't know that the name fits perfectly for me. Anyway, I would pick it up if you get a chance although I would definitely pick the west coast ipa over this for a pretty easily found 6er of Green Flash"
"Overall, while very hoppy, this beer remained well balanced with the red ale malt flavors."
"edit: 1/29/2010 ... Just tried this from the shorty bottle ... still an A beer in my book .. very solid!"
"Wow, a very well balanced treat of an Amber and quite drinkable by a few or more."
"My main criticism is that it's a little rougher around the edges than I'd expected. If you like hoppier brews, approaching IPA bitterness, give this one a turn if you come across it."
"I also almost felt like my tongue was getting torn up a little bit from all the bitterness of the thing, and for that reason it's not the most drinkable beer. A spicy burrito was just the thing to cut the bitterness and will up the drinkability considerably."
"Drinkability: Sitting at only 6%, a few bottles of this could easily be had, but I'm sticking with one. This would make a nice session beer."
"Arrived in a standard shaker glass. Appears a clear rich amber color with a finger of off white foam. A sticky lace is left on the glass as I sip my way to the bottom. Nose and flavor are of ruby red grapefruit juice, pink grapefruit, citrus such as tangerines and lemon, nicely toasted bready grains, caramelized malt in abundance to balance everything out, some pine as well. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation. Really nice stuff!"
"Not really sure why this only scored a B+ in my first review. This is easily one of the best Red Ales out there. Amazingly hoppy and even fruitier than Green Flashes' own IPA. If just smelling this beer is heaven imagine what it must be like to taste it!"
"The mouthfeel is medium with a slick finish that leaves some bitterness."
"Billowing tan head that puffs up above the rim of the pint glass. Creamy texture to the surface, and and intricate ring of lace inside the rim. Slightly hazed reddish amber, micro-sediment in suspension. Traces of citrus in the aroma, rounded and pleasant malt dominates, leading me to believe this isn't a ""just born"" beer. No punchy Amarillo citrus that I was craving...However it isn't completely lost. There's a firm hop bitterness in the flavor, again traces of citrus, light sweetness of bready malt lingers. Good feel from steady carbonation, and perfect for a session. I've got to track down a fresh bottle, and then re-rate..."
"D: I drank several of these, and with good reason. This beer borders on a red IPA, and I found it to be incredibly enjoyable."
"Drinkability is hell good not really what i would buy if i were looking for a red ale, more a red IPA."
"this is a great frickin' brew. malty, hoppy, sweet, bitter and damn nice to look at"
"D: Very impressive beer that definitely brought me into the Green Flash fan camp (though I do think they're a bit overhyped still). This was an excellent Red Ale and is a nice comeback for me on this style after a few disappointments. A really well put together brew that will appeal to both Red and IPA fans. Looking forward to trying some of GF's Stouts and Belgians to form a better decision on them. If you come across this brew try it (but don't go too far out of your way, ha)."
"I could drink a few of these. Overall very tasty and drinkable red ale."
"Super Tasty and very drinkable. Excellent hoppy bitter Red ""IPA"". Amazing complexity to the amarillo hops. Great ""red"" malt character. The sediment floated around but did not really take away from the beer until the final sip."
"The smell was citrusy and evergreen. The taste was good but unique. It had an odd malt taste, possibly rye in there? Buscuity. The mouthfeel was nicely ibu'd. Overall a pretty good drinker."
"This one grows on you. After the first couple of sips, I thought this was an over-hopped, unbalanced ale. As it warms it certainly improves. Did I mention the large amount of sediment floating in the ale; a rather unattractive but tasty ale."
"This isn't an IPA folks. Its a Ryle PA, so don't give a low score because you hate the style. I love this beer. Dark copperish red with yeasty chunks suspended in the beer and has the consistency of glycerin. Smells faintly of hops and citrus. Hop Hed REd has a great pale ale bite of the hops and sharp floral citrus flavors but also has a unique rye taste that is fantastic and has a great slippery mouthfeel. This beer has opened my eyes up to new possibilities for Rye PA."
"While it pours beautifully with a deep copper color and wonderful head, this brew is all looks and no personality. I hate to say it, but its nothing more than beautifully hopped dishwater... For anything more in depth just read the previous low reviews. I couldn't agree more with them. (And I love Reds... and strong or highly hopped beers)"
"On draught at Callahan's in San Diego. This brew pours a luminous amber color with a medium and foamy beige head that lingers for some time. Rings of lace on the glass. Floral hops aroma with touches of sweet fruit. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with flavors of floral hops, grapefruit and malt. The finish is hoppy with a lingering bitterness. Pretty good overall."
"Drinkability: While only 6.4% ABV, this beer's sweet malty character and taste will keep it from being that sessionable for me. Others may look at it different, but I don't feel like this is the best example of the style for me."
"Drinkability: Definitely on the higher side. The bitterness is very pleasing, and the overall taste is solid. Very decent beer."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable, I've been impressed with the Green Flash brews that have made it to North Texas."
"Pours red-amber, hazy with noticeable particulates. Head is dense, leading to lace that sticks to the sides of my glass. Grapefruit and grain in the nose. First sip is hoppy up front, with a bit of the alcohol coming through. Big mouthfeel middle, thick. Finishes bitter, again on the heavy side. While the hopping is noticeable, there's enough sweetness in malt to make it characteristically different from an IPA."
"The dark body with the brown head was most enjoyable. The smell is something that I would expect from a hoppy ale, the taste is perfect for my taste although may be a little strong for others. This was certainly a enjoyable sit down beer paired with a gamey dinner, this makes an excellent conbinbation."
"Appearance is very very dark amber, had a healthy two finger head that lasted almost the entire way through the beer.. Lots of heavy lacing on the glass. Smelled almost like Bell's Hopslam to me (one of my favorites) The hop note is VERY noticable. Strong strong hop taste, yet still smooth and not overpowering. Seems to me like it could be higher than a 6% ABV.... Drinkability is great for a hop-head.."
"Found it in a 12 oz bottle at a very reasonable price."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable. Red ale style is not my favorite but the nice hop mix on this one makes it very easy to drink."
"Thanks to Alen for this one!"
"Overall: A-"
"The body is moderate to dry. Carbonation is light (could have used against the hops). Overall this is a hop bomb red. Not really to style per say but more of a red ipa. Great hop notes that a hop head would smile but I personally would like to see a bit more malt and bitterness to balance the finishing hops. Still tasty though."
"D- I just started to explore red ales and i think this is my favorite so far. drinkable, yes, very refreshing session!"
"A very nice taste from the start. Definitely felt more like an IPA than an Amber, but still very good. Citrus and pine hops meld together for a refreshing taste. A little dry and bitter in the aftertaste, but worked very well for the beer. Would have appreciated some more malts in this, but they were obviously going for the hops, given the name. Never had this out of the bottle, but I probably will give it a try now just to compare."
"Served: in an imperial pint glass."
"M - Moderate carbonation, medium body"
"The beer is definitely creamy, it has a nice bready undertone to it, but the hops are just too bittering, too drying, and too leafy for my tastes. I'm rating this in terms of an IPA because I'm not getting enough of the maltiness of a red ale to real label it as such. This beer doesn't have enough red ale character and the hop is too bittering for a good IPA. I'm a bit disappointed in a beer that doesn't seem to be able to find itself."
"A great cross between a red(amber) ale and a IPA, though it is very much skewed toward the IPA."
"Apart from the slightly darker colour, this could easily pass as an IPA. Surprisingly, considering its classification, this seems unbalanced towards hops, and the malt base that the top IPAs is missing here. Still, it's very drinkable for all that, and I could easily go for a second."
"This beer is a little heavier in than it appears, but still very crisp and drinkable. The mouthfeel is nice as the malty sweetness is more than balanced by bitter dry hops. This beer is one that I will definitely return to and try to keep in the fridge more often than not."
"A dark read mahogany color, and a fruity and very hoppy aroma. It had a full thick body, and up front the Hop flavor was overpowering and bitter which was then nicely balanced with a rich malt back flavor."
"Verdict: Well, the bottle really says it all, this is a generously Amarillo hopped Red Ale with a lots of caramel malt. It may blur the line between Red Ale and Pale Ale a bit, but who cares?"
"A nice balance of hops and malt considering that the hops are not quite subtle. If you're in the mood for a hopped-up Red Ale, this one won't disapoint."
"medium body, good amount of carbonation, very smooth drinking. a little bit of oiliness from the hops, very nice. very easily an all night sessionable beer."
"Pours a dark red amber color. Lots of grapefruit aromas and citrus. This is my favorite hop smell. Very bitter taste, surprising for only 45 ibus. This is a beer I can really sit down and enjoy quite a few of. Not an overpowering ipa by any means but still a solid flavorful beer."
"D- Great example of the style and quite drinkable..."
"D= Really a very drinkable ale here. Nothing too overpowering, just a great meld of flavors. At 6% this is quite sessionable too!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice deep red/amber color with a nice little creamy head, decent lacing. The smell is great, bright citrusy (orange and pineapple) hops and some malt sweetness comes through after it sits a bit. In the taste I get more bitterness in the hops, which was a bit different than the smell which was more citrusy. The hop bitterness is balanced out with a bit of malty caramel sweetness. Believe the name. Nice smooth body of a red ale with a good bitter aftertaste that will sit in the back of your mouth. A very nice brew although this site has it at 6% the bottle is claiming it's 6.4%. I'd recommend it."
"Poured a red copper color, with no head, but had a potent hoppy aroma. Excellent hop taste bursts through with malty and floral hints; it was hoppy on the sweet side, and had a dry crisp finish. Overall a great brew that should be in the IPA class as it has too much taste and too many hops to be a standard ale. It went down easy and I look forward to enjoying more of these!"
"From a medium pour an explosive burst of bubbles leads to a two-finger airy tan head. Retention is good, with a nice thick layer of lace left behind. Color is brown with ruby red edges. A nice hit of oily hops excites the nose with a bit of citrus hanging around underneath. A little earthiness is also detected. Tastes of oily hops with a spicy and malty undercurrent and some alcohol heat at the very back. The malts balance out afer a few drinks, and overall the components interact well with each other. Mouth-feel lies on the heavy side of medium, and there's a good amount of carbonation. This one really works for me."
"The relatively-low abv% (6.4) and the resiny mouthfeel make this an affordable go-to brew when I'm unsure of my palate's mood. Although, the experience is somewhat dampened by the high alpha acid aftertaste, Hop Head Red is characterized by great aromas and flavors, even better mouthfeel and good drinkability. A quality beer that most will like and some will love or hate."
"Mouthfeel is full and very nice with a lighter carbonation than one might expect. I think if the dry hops were changed and maybe a little more carbonation might help the drinkability for me. Still a nice beer."
"D: I was having trouble finishing this one. It might have been because I was 6 beers deep, but I wasn't really feeling it."
"Mouthfeel is on par for an amber ale, though the hops want for an astringency that's lacking (which could be considered good or bad). I think it's too bitter to be very drinkable, especially for an American Amber. I plan to let my palate mature and revisit this, but only to see if I missed something the first time around."
"D - This is a well balanced beer...the hops are big as the beer is cold and the malts shine through as the beer warms...could drink this anytime of the year"
"This is a highly drinkable beer - just hoppy enough and blended perfectly to soften it up a bit. This is one to sit with for a while."
"Extremely well balanced, quite refreshing, and given the low ABV (relatively speaking), worth enjoying a couple of these blissful amber ales."
"On another note, I have not tried many Red's. I find them to be too sweet or cloying with flavor, and have stayed away from them in the past. But this beer threw it all out the window and will be a good add session beer to my fridge. Cheers."
"Drinkability - Very refreshing."
"Notes: Resinous piney and citrusy hops all over. Malts give some balance, but it's definitely hop-forward. This is a rock-solid hoppy brew that would definitely work as a session staple at only 6.0%."
"A sturdily bitter brew. Want a hit of hops? You got it."
"A great beer, one of my favorite go-tos. If this beer were about 30% lower in retail price, I would never be without it in my fridge."
"Feels a little gritty and grainy, but works with the red part of the beer. It's a nice amber/IPA hybrid. Goes down very easy but not wimpy."
"It has been a while since i have drank a red. It was a toss up between this red and their ipa. although i did rather enjoy this very much. the hops were nice and not overpowering. i hate it when a beer is what my mother-in-law calls perfumey! this hop head would definitely purchase this hop head red again!"
"Pours cloudy dark amber with ahuge off white head and plentiful lacings. Aroma is floral hops. Taste is sweet rich malts with a very strong earthy leather hop bitterness. Very powerful amber, would see this leaning toward the IPA camp. Nice beer will probably drink more when available."
"D- extremely smooth, drinkable, well balanced and easy to drink. possibly one of my new favorites. I just wish it was a little easier on the wallet."
"D: I thought this was a very good beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. I am torn on the classification, I believe it to mimic an IPA more so than other ambers I have had. Either way, its a solid, smooth, and enjoyable beer."
"easy drinking and good flavor make for a beer that would be good for sessioning. a damn nice american red."
"Great beer I would drink more if I could buy some in Wisconsin."
"D: This beer was extremely drinkable. It had a nice blend of malt and oily hops that I found very refreshing. I could definitely drink several of these."
"D - This is a good hopped up red that I found enjoyable if your a hop head this is a beer thats worth trying"
"Overall a very good beer for hopheads looking to enjoy something other than a full-on IPA. Not overpowering on any front, with what I consider a quaffable ABV."
"D-This is very drinkable, and if there was another in the fridge I'd crack it open. Somewhat one-dimensional, this is a good everyday beer...very thirst quenching and a good overall effort. Will pick up some more if I see it around."
"New brewery to me but very impressed with my first experience!"
"Very drinkable. Absolutely delicious. Could definitely see myself drinking a few of these. Pretty similar to Nugget Nectar in my opinion but can't quite match up. A great hoppy red ale. My first beer from Green Flash and I am quite impressed."
"The aroma of hops comes as no surprize, also caramel, cane sugar, a hint of molasses sweetness. The taste is very hop-forward and I would have guessed the IBU's as higher than the 45 stated on the label. Nonetheless, it is all nicely held together with a resiny bitterness and a malty finish, long drawn out aftertaste that lingers for some time. Nicely refreshing for the hop admirer, this beer has substantial body and flavour and is well crafted. I could drink a few of these every day."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Very good. It's above average, but not the best. I still like Nosferatu and Red's Rye a bit better. None the less, I would definitely purchase this again."
"D - Green Flash has a winner with this one. Definitely worth having again and one that you could easily have a couple of these."
"Pours a dark reddish amber colour with a thin head that nonetheless leaves plenty of lacing. A very yeasty, bready, grassy aroma wafts out of the glass. The hops head-butt you hard at first, then fade slightly and reveal a subtle maltiness, but the hops come back as the beer makes its way to the back of the palate and down the gullet. Very bitter, slightly sweet, very nice. Medium-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. I'll be seeking this beer out again for sure."
"Hazy amber in color with a thin white head. Definite Amarillo aroma, subtle and not overwhelming. Hops dominate over the malt aroma. Seems like a fairly standard west coast hoppy red ale. 45 IBUs provide a solid bitterness, but nothing over the top. Definitely a tasty brew, and I wouldn't mind buying this one again."
"D - great! Greenflash rocks the Casbah regularly, and this beer is no exception. Is it more of a ""red IPA"" than red ale? Sure. Does it still kick much ass? Definitely. Highly enjoyable. I think I'll rock another one now actually"
"Poured a cloudy copper color with some suspended solids and 1 fingers worth of head that faded with a lot of lacing. They aren't kidding about calling this hop head - I'd swear it was an IPA from the smell and not a red ale. Tons of hop aroma, with pine being the most dominate character. This beer has a big body that sits thick in your mouth until the bitterness overwhelms all of your taste buds. There's no questioning that this was dry hopped. The finish is slightly lingering. This beer reminds me a lot of an IPA, but with a stronger malt presence."
"Pours a hazy dark amber color with some suspended yeast. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of hops, biscuit, and sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. So far this beer has a lot of promise; if well done this might be my favorite style of beer. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Bitterness is present but not overpowering and a dryness is noticeable and fairly strong. Tastes strongly of hops and then some sweet malt come through. Slight biscuit flavor is present in the finish and there is a hint of fruit throughout. A general dryness prevails and makes you want to drink another and another. Wow, what an unexpected find - this is a great blend (heavy on the hops). Definitely worth a try!"
"D- I could drink a 6er of this 6%er for a session no problem. I'm glad green flash made it's way to philly as they know how to brew. Not a trace of alcohol in taste but this could drown out your taste buds after a few."
"drinkability: i'm digging this brew. i'm into rye ipas, and this reminds me of the style. i could easily get knee deep in a sixer if i had it. i will definitely seek this one out again."
"D: Makes for an easy drinking brew. But I had hoped for a bit more character."
"Taste has a malt up front with a hoppy ending. I think it is very well balanced. I would say more of a well balanced IPA than an amber ale, but very nice. Mouthfeel is nice and full, and I will definitly seek this one out again."
"A pretty straight forward beer nothing to go crazy for, but nothing to turn down either. After a few you will probably be looking for something new to try."
"Beer poured deep red with a nice long lasting tan head with secondary yeast floating when held to light. Nose initially was of pungent citrus hops. Malts become more prominent as the beer warms. Taste initially was extremely well balanced but is showing IPA characteristics by mid bottle as the dry hopping is becoming more prevelant. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and is extremely smooth for this style of beer. Drinkability is good. This is an interesting beer that blurs the style lines. Nice experiment and definitely worth trying if you enjoy a hoppy red beer."
"An this is an IPA to be sure, wonder why they even label it as a red?"
"That little hop bite at the end ruined it for me a little. It seems like the flavor gets sucked out midway through, then all you're left with is a bit of drying bitterness. While this one is certainly worthy (and I'm not referring to the score category on this site), I feel other breweries have done the ultra-hopped Amber/Red Ale better."
"Had on tap on 3/19/09. Beer was a lot fresher and tasted and smelled a lot better than the bottle I reviewed. Freshness with this beer is a key factor. Scores represent the fresher sample."
"that being said i downed my glass in the time that it took to review this beer so i upped the drinkabillity a little bit wish i had more to further dissect this beer and style."
"overall this is an amazing hopped up amber ale. one of the best i have had. once again, the west is best."
"Nice offering from Green Flash."
"Very full bodied, a lot more so then the 6 percent abv would suggest. Very creamy with beautiful caramel all throughout. This is an excellent beer, with tons of refreshing floral tastes from what I am assuming is an under use of cascade hops. Some very pleasant centenial bitterness but nothing over the top. This is an incredibly refreshing red ale, that really sits well as an easily session-able beer. Hats off to Green Flash as they've done it again."
"Green Flash Hop Head Red is a cloudy, orangish red ale with particles in it. The off-white head fades to a film and leaves nice lacing. It has a fresh hop aroma, like juicy citrus. It has a medium-light body with low carbonation. It's a little papery, but pretty smooth. The finish is loose. It's nice and bitter, with notes of grapefruit peel and orange peel. It's very top heavy, so I can't really tell what's going on with the malt. It's pretty invigorating."
"This is a pretty decent beer. Reds aren't my favorite. It's more red than IPA. Pretty decent overall, but nothing special."
"Pours a chill hazed copper with a foamy head of mixed bubbles. Wow. Straight-up grapefruit pith all the way in the nose. Flavour is also lots of grapefruit with a bit of a grain in the background. Not a lot of toastedness or fruitiness in this one - could be that the hops are just obliterating anything else. Quite a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with a bit of a zippy carbonation. Drinkable if you like big grapefruit hops."
"Overall, a decent amber ale, but it i think that the Amarillo hop is a bit astringent and hop bitterness overwhelms the hop flavor. The Caramel malt presence just kind of hangs out without really melding with the rest of the beer."
"Mmmm, hop juice in a bottle. Similar hop flavor and bitterness as the WCIPA, but with a stronger malt profile. Sticky, resinous and delicious! Green Flash manages to make ultra-hoppy beers without being over the top bitter and always clean and crisp. I actually like this one better than their IPA."
"D: This would be a great sixer to watch a game with. I really really like this beer, and will continue to have it on hand. Excellent amber, highly recommended."
"D- ok with a good amount of complexity"
"Pours a dark amber color with plenty of yeast floaties that seem to be typical of Green Flash brews. Somewhat small head settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a nice juicy orange hop, not very strong but nice. The taste is more of a sprucy, resin hop; quite bitter but the bready malt helps balance it out. There is quite a bitter aftertaste. The feel is moderate to thick, with a good amount of carbonation to cut the maltiness. Definitely finishes bitter but there is a nice balance between the hop and malt. A real nice hoppy amber ale. The hoppier the better for this boring style. The hop bitterness is a bit harsh and the look could be better but still a very nice brew."
"D-	Its drinkable, but I wish it were smoother. I can't see myself drinking more than two of these in one sitting. Green Flash brewery is definitely a force to be reckoned with and one that is rising to the top of my list."
"The bottled experience here was surprisingly more pleasant than the experience i had with it on tap. I will be buying more of this when I return to Sams, as this probably ranks in with my top ten current beers."
"One of my favorite inexpensive, ""small"" IPA's. A great way to get your hop fix, and then some. A go-to beer for sure."
"Pours the color I expected, reddish and amber. Small creamy head that was very thin. Smelled piney and of grapefruit. Taste was good and refreshing with the flavor mimicking the smell...grapefruit and pine. Mouthfeel is medium with adequate carbonation. I enjoyed the beer as it was very well balanced between malts and hops. Overall a good beer that I could enjoy several of over the course of an evening."
"D: Not the best IPA in the world, but definitely enjoyable and worth a try."
"Very drinkable beer. Light and dry, with good but not overpowering taste."
"D - Very good. I'm getting to like this substyle - the bitterness and hop aroma of an IPA, but with a more assertive malt backbone and richer mouthfeel."
"Quite easily the best beer I've tasted of this style. It reminds me more of a good brewpub IPA however. Highly recommended if you are looking to stray from your normal routine/styles."
"I've been on quite a good streak with good, hopped Reds of late--Southern Tier Big Red, Santa's Private Reserve from Rogue, and now Hop Head Red. If only more red were so beefed up. Hop Head Red is outstanding, one of the very best from Green Flash."
"D: Very drinkable, I can assure you that it makes a great session beer. Recommended."
"D: A very sessionable beer. I could really knock these back."
"Quite a unique little drink! This one hits each area of the tongue in clearly distinct phases. The hops bitterness with slight malt sweetness stayed in my mouth for a full half-hour after I had finished!!"
"Pours dark red, fades to copper at the bottom of my tulip glass. High carbonation, this beer is alive! Reminiscent of Old Chub, beginning to become a fan of reds, yet I still haven't found the one red ale to pull me over. Very heavy red, thick and viscous. Nearly no head, but lacing is prominent. Sweet notes of cherries and grapes."
"Pours a deep red color with a nice off-white head. The beer has little floaties in it from the bottle, but the liquid is clear otherwise. The head stays around and leaves good lacing. The smell is probably the best part. Says on the bottle ""dry hopped with Amarillo", and I believe it. I can smell them for days, and it's really great. There's also a whiff of sweetness and maltiness underneath. The taste is nice. There's a good maltiness, like a bready, nutty, biscuity taste filled with some sweetness from caramel malts, but definitely not overly sweet. The malts are balanced with a nice hop bitterness and there's some hop flavor in there, but not as much as there could be. In the mouthfeel, there's kind of a chalky taste from the bitterness. And there's something else, almost like an alcohol burn, but I can't seem to imagine it being that because of the 6% and the malty/hoppi-ness, maybe it's the carbonation, a bit too much and it burns the tongue. The drinkability is good. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't go for a whole 6-pack in a night. I could handle two or three though and enjoy it."
"Overall a solid beer, but I enjoyed it better from bottle. Still another solid offering from Green Flash that I would drink any day of the week."
"One of the hoppier red ales around. Very enjoyable."
"Cheers!"
"A: Thin layer of frothy head, visible particles, the color of a light iced tea - 4.25, S: Heavy on the hops, lots of pine, solid malt backbone as well, some citrus and grassiness is present - 4.50, T: This beer tends to stray away from the typical malt happy amber, loads of hops that dominate the beer, piney and some orange zest, malt is present but it plays second fiddle - 4.50, M: A little resiny - 4.50, D: Yes, I would happily drink another Hop Head Red Ale - 4.50"
"D= high. Feels and tastes like an imperial ipa. But lower in alcohol. Great beer. I loved it and a huge thanks to kadonny for providing it"
"12 oz bottle at the Bier Stein. Very attractive dark red pour with a sizable dirty white head. Pretty carbonated, but not unpleasantly so. Very tasty, almost IPA like in hoppiness and flavor, pine and citrus predominate. Dry finish. Extremely tasty especially for the style."
"Wow! This is so goood. Thank you Green Flash Brew for this hoppy amber brew. The Lord bless the hop harvest!"
"7/4/6/4/13 (3.4/5)"
"A great go-to beer."
"A very nice Red Ale from Green Flash with a big hop/sweet malt balance."
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. It would be my go to beer if it was easier to find and the price tag wasnt so high."
"Drinkability is good with a very nice hop taste. The hop taste is really great on this beer and it is slightly toned by good toffee malts. Definitely a lot of good tastes to this beer, but still able to drink these in a session. Grab a 6 pack if you can."
"NOTES: BBCSD-E2"
"D: This one is quite enjoyable. Nice flavors and aromas that are simple but very enjoyable. This is a highly sessionable brew that I am glad I have another bottle of. This is an easy drink that has some great flavor, but doesn't kill the palate."
"Pours a red, dark red brown color body, and a huge foamy cream-colored head, good lacing, and lasting. Has a hoppy aroma, grapefruity. Dusty nose. Strawberry fruit taste, some malts. Has a bitter aftertaste. A fizzy palate. Very harsh grapefruity taste and aftertaste. A little smoother as it warms. A very good heavily hopped ale."
"Pours clear red with a massive off-white head. Grass, pine, and grapefruit all over the nose. More bittersweet than expected. Lots of resin and grapefruit with a strong bitterness from the Amarillos. Expected biscuit maltiness that did not overwhelm. I was happy with this selection."
"overall: the more green flash i try the more i like. I believe this is another elite micro brewer in this great country of so many of them. Easily one of my favorite session beers and just o so good if you like hops of course, if not why are you trying a beer called hop head red?"
"This is a very decent American hoppy ale. Lots of flavors, but hops are definitely in the front."
"Decent mouthfeel, but not my style of hopping."
"A very hoppy, deliciously bittersweet red ale. The beer pours bright red with a nice beige head that leaves behind quite a bit of lacing. The smell is superb, lots of hops and lots of caramel malt. The hops smell oily and citric, like essence of orange peel. There's some spice, maybe coriander seed. The taste is very hoppy. I might just be a sucker for these hoppy beers, but I'm a happy sucker. Green Flash certainly does a good job with hops. This beer has good citric bitterness with some balance provided by sweet caramel malt. I don't know what else to say about it. My reviews of hop-heavy beers tend to sound similar. This beer has a strong hop flavor but doesn't overwhelm the palette quite as much as some. It's not the crisp bitterness of Stone's Ruination but more of a smooth bittersweet flavor. The feel is nice and oily from the hops but also tends to get a bit watery on the finish. The drinkability is good but it feels a bit heavy for a 6% abv beer."
"Thanks to stumac for the trade."
"Somewhat hazy in the body...the color glows red merged with hues of orange. Frothy head on top is healthy and good to look at, and great lacing on my glass. Aroma...sourdough bread, big smack of hops on the nose. Bits of caramel and orange. This red ale has a tropical fruit juice flavor that makes up the meat of the flavor, similar flavor to their IPA, but not as much. Caramel and bready in the malt department for balance...hint of pineapple and burnt sugar. Super smooth mouthfeel....good all around beer."
"A big hoppy beer, quite enjoyable. I'd have another."
"D: A very tasty beer. A great version of a hoppy red and fans of Amarillo hops will really enjoy it."
"D: A nicely hopped amber, I really enjoyed this one."
"This Green Flash gets the green light from this thirsty camper - oh, Canteen Boy...."
"Overall a superior hoppy ale. A ton of flavor for a relatively small beer."
"pours a reddish brown color with a brown tinted quickly fading head. the nose is a blend of floral and spicy hops, slight sweet malts, and some citrus. the taste is piny, spicy hops, very dry but with sweet malts mixed in, grapefruit. a very awesome red ale"
"Overall, this is a really good beer. More like an IPA than a Red in my opinion but good whatever you call it. Glad to see this one hit Texas. Recommend and worth an occasional spot in the rotation."
"12 oz bottle. Nice amber looking brew with bubbling rising to the top of a pretty decent sized head. Smells strongly of pine and caramel malt. Taste follows the nose with hop oil, caramel malt and a slight roasted edge. Citrus with a pear like sweetness. Pretty well balanced but finishes on the bitter side, which I would expect from a beer with such a name. Hop cone aroma and taste is dead on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Overall this is a pretty drinkable brew but would not reccommend drinking more delicately flavored brews after this palate crusher."
"Medium body with a lovely hop bitterness. This one is almost like Big Hoppy from Terrapin, except better, and more tame, and less alcoholic. That makes no sense, but whatever. A very good beer."
"The beer pours a dark red color with very good head retention and lacing. The beer is pretty malty and roasty smelling on the nose, with a hint of hoppy bitterness. The flavors of the hops are more noticeable. The beer has the roasty/malty qualities I expect in a red ale, married with the hoppiness of a good IPA. Not bad at all. The beer is surprisingly soft on the palate, and I get almost a creamy mouthfeel on the finish. The finish is impressively long and bitter."
"D: I'm intrigued to take sips because Green Flash couldn't have made something I dislike this much could they? They did :-("
"Overall a damn fine beer."
"A delicious hop-juice brew."
"D - Hoppy for an amber but like this take on the style. Very easy to drink if you like your hops."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep red amber color with a two finger fluffy off white head that leaves lots of lace on the ride down the glass. Lots of floaties in this one, hop residue maybe? Smells of citrus hops and a bit of caramel. Tastes of citrus and pine and a little malt shows through here too. Definitely a hop forward brew with a lingering bitterness in the aftertaste. Resinous oily mouthfeel. Medium body, ample carbonation. Great hop juice. I enjoyed it."
"This beer pours a reddish, carmely color with a thin head. The nose is of hops, malts tones, a slight carmel sweetness and mango notes. This brew has an initial taste of hoppy bitterness that tastes like (what I imagine) fresh hop juice would taste like. And finishes with a citrus peel note. It's full bodied with crisp carbonation."
"Enjoyable but not overwhelming. Needed a bigger finish. West Coast IPA remains the Green Flash fav."
"Moderate carbonation and a medium mouthfeel create a very drinkable brew. I understand why this won gold for the style at this year's GABF."
"As a hop head, I love these style beers."
"Overall this is a very good amber ale. As the name implies, it's certainly hoppier than most, but there's also a solid malt backbone to this beer. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability is pretty good, by the smell alone, this is one of my favorite beers of all time! Unfortunetly, the taste is not as satisfying, and while it packs a big punch in a small package, it's not my ideal for the hoppy red, which is big, bright resiny hop aroma and flavor. Still, it's cheap and fresh."
"this was recommended to me by a sales associate at a local table & vine after i was looking for green flash west coast ipa, which was sold out. being somewhat reluctant to try this brew i'm glad i did! the smell alone told me that this was going to be a great ride. the taste was even better. it is hoppy...but not offensive. this is ,to me a masterpiece!"
"Nearly two inches of bready tan head turns rocky as bubbles pop leaving scattered lace. Body is a brick reddish brown. Nose is full of crisp citrusy hops with orange rind and a hint of piney sweetness. Initially enters the mouth with a sweetsmooth almost creamy feel. A layer of malt comes through to add depth and nice balance. Then the hops show up to add a nice little even bitter bite which hangs on nicely to the back of the tongue. Hop feel is more on the citrus side but does have a rustic feel also. Mouthfeel is bold and thick leaving you wanting the next sip. Wonderfully drinkable. I could use a fridge full of this."
"D - Highly drinkable... A terrific brew... At 6%, I would still consider this highly sessionable..."
"Pours a nice hazy golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some very nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy with a nice balance of malt, with some nice citrus/pine notes. The taste is hoppy, slightly sweet, malty, nice citrus/pine notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is another awesome GF brew."
"This is a terrific beer, the best I've had in a while, and worth trying for anyone who appreciates well balanced, brilliantly crafted brew. Looking forward to more Green Flash stuff soon."
"Pours a burnt orange/copper color with a few floaties. Two fingers of fluffy tan froth has great retention and provides excellent sticky lacing. Smells of dried grass, pine needles, caramel, citrus rind, and ripe fruits. Tastes of grapefruit and orange peel up front with a nice caramel malt backbone and a dry bitter pine finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Smooth and sticky with great balance and a nice hop kick. Sweet with a dry and bitter finish. An excellent red ale, made West Coast style."
"Sessionable as all get-up. Drinkability is off the charts for something so big. Amazing!"
"I always enjoy a hoppy red and this didn't disappoint. I may have to try and get my hands on a few more of these soon. Thanks for the bottle Russ!"
"Bottom line: This is definitely one of the better Red/Amber Ales I've tasted to date. I'd like another please. ;^)"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff this one. Nice hearty red ale that everyone should drink."
"M + D: A full bodied brew, by all means. It almost goes a little heavy and doesn't seem to lighten up on the finish, making it feel a little weighty. This isn't a horrible attribute, but it was a little bit unusual, I found. That said, I could do another - the hop presence does do a number on the palate, though. Not one to try another tasting after!"
"Hop Head Red's a hell of a good beer. One of the better and more interesting red ales I've had. Something about the fine hop flavor kept me wishing for a little more bitterness. But, it's very tasty and enjoyable as it stands. Definitely recommended."
"D: Nice drinkability, I could go for a few here with an ample amount of complexity for a red as well hoppiness."
"Afterthoughts: I think I figured out what bugged me about this beer; it's a Barleywine Lite. The basic characteristics are there, juicy hop oil, big sweet base malt, but it doesn't have the weight to carry all the hops leaving it seemly thin, bitter and a touch too sweet."
"D - Goes down smooth, just bitter enough to keep the sweetness from setting in, would do well in the long hall. Very enjoyable."
"Overall better than average for my tastes. This brewery hasn't disappointed me yet. Drinkability is good, but it tastes higher than 6% for some reason."
"Grapefruit aroma fom the fragrant amarillo. Initially big head. Smooth easy drinking, I can just picture the guzzlers downing 6-paks. A nice bitterness that is left on the aftertaste. Well balanced at 45 IBU.A fresh and bold taste, can use to transition to craft."
"Overall a nice hoppy amber style brew. It has a great flavor and is I find it to be very easy to drink. Green Flash continues to impress."
"Bright, glowing amber with lively carbonation and a medium head that fades somewhat quickly. It leaves spots of lacing down the glass. Smell is nice fresh hoppy goodness. Much more of a distinct hop presence than from the bottle. This stuff seems super fresh or maybe it's just that different on-tap. Juicy, citrusy hops. Lightly sugared and quite tasty. A smaller malt base than the bottled version as well. Just a bit of caramel and a biscuity undertone to support the delicious hops. A nice bitterness with light dryness. Good carbonation leaves a tickle on the tongue and it's so refreshing that you can't help but take another sip soon after. I think this is much better on-tap and even though there were a few beers I had yet to try on the board, I stuck with this one after the first pint. Great stuff!"
"That is the best way to describe this beer. It's sooo well balanced. The hops and malt are perfectly matched and neither overpower the other. Floral, citrusy hops and toasty cereal malts. Great flavor, the mouthfeel is relatively light and fades quickly. A great session beer, too bad I only have one..."
"On tap at Mission Pizza in Fremont. Wow, this is great stuff. Deep red with a creamy white head that paints the glass with some very impressive lacework, all the way down. Malty flavor balanced nicely with a crisp hop bitterness. Hops definitely make their presence known, but do not overwhelm this beer as is the case with many other Green Flash offerings. Great balance, medium body and simply a terrific quaff for a hot day. Destined to be a heavy rotation beer for me."
"cheers!"
"Pours a nice deep red color with some orange highlights and a nice, unusually tan head that leaves good lacing. Nose is quite hoppy with slight biscuity malt. Taste follows with quite a bit of hop flavor, a nice citrus hop profile with a decent malt presence, but I would have expected a bigger sweetness from and amber/red ale. Good hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is nice and dry, slightly thin *for the style*. Drinkability is good, if your a hophead that is. Overall, this is a very nice tasting clean, well made beer. I always debate whether or not to reem beers like this though, because to me, this is more like a red IPA (ala mars, celebration, furious, etc.) than it is like your average, stereotypical amber/red ale, although there are some amber ale characteristics in this. They clearly wanted to express the hops in this one, as stated on the label, so I gave it an honest rating, as they let me know, hey this red ale has some hops. Really though, who gives a shit what the *actual style* is if the beer tastes great, which this one does, so go get some, its good."
"Drinkability: One of the better Green Flash brews, in my opinion. The alcohol is, of course, nice and low (6%), making for a sessionable and tasty beer. The bitterness may perhaps be a little high (45 IBUs), which covers up a few of what I imagine are some pretty tasty hop notes, but by and large it's a pretty tasty brew."
"Poured into a 12-oz mug, this beer is a fairly dark reddish-mahogany color. Only a small head forms on top, but it provides modest lacing. With the name of this beer, the aroma is hardly unexpected: a hugely hoppy nose, full of citrus, pine-resin notes--but there's also some sweet, lightly caramel malt. Flavor is better than the IPA, more balanced. There's still a very high bitterness, load upon load of hop flavor, but also some lightly toasted, sweet malt. The sweetness is forcibly dried out by the finish, but it still makes a good flavor component. A pretty darn good ultra-hoppy ale."
"D - Very good, I could drink several of these. Probably one of the best red ales I have had."
"if you like hops this is a great session beer -6% alcohol is pretty nice -though if it was higher i would consider this an american strong ale."
"Most of the hoppy red ales I've had usually hit you first with the malt, then the hops come into play. This one seems to be the opposite. The citrus hops come in, with a lot of grapefruit, and it is followed up very lightly by the malt. I'd say the malt in this red is a lot less pronounced than many in this style. It's a good, hoppy, beer that leaves the grapefruit taste in your mouth for a while."
"This beer is the perfect example of why big flavor doesn't necessarily need to come with a big ABV or big price tag. (Says 6% on this bottle.) Since this is relatively obtainable, I might just buy this by the case and make it my #1 every day beer. Perfectly balanced, ridiculously flavorful, completely outstanding."
"Had a pint of this on tap at Blue Smoke BBQ in NYC. It was one of the few things on tap that I hadn't tried. This was a little bit of a conflicting beer for me. I like Red ales but not a big fan of the heavy hops. I was pleasantly surprised. It looks innocent enough and the hops are certainly the signature taste (hence the name) It paired well with the spicy chicken we were eating and I would probably drink this again. This beer is well done and although the strong taste of hops is prevalent it's not overpowering enough to take away from the beer itself."
"This is a god beer, but it doesn't stand out in my mind among the other hopped up red's. The body is a bit thick with caramel and lightly roasted malts. The hops form a collection of pine, citrus, and pineapple flavors that finish with a big bitterness. And while this is all good and tasty, I'm left feeling full with this beer. The body and bitterness overwhelm me to a degree and as a result I'm not wanting more."
"D- Pretty solid brew, different and easy to drink."
"8/28 edit - my second bottle was a better experience. Still too bitter, but I was able to drink it without additives. Anyway I bumped a few scores to reflect that, Taste +1.0, Drink +1.0"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp. A little heavy on the malts for my liking."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I've had better hoppy red beers but this is still a good beer to drink for a while."
"not sure the abv on this one, but drinkability is fantastic. not far behind nugget nectar, if it is at all. i'd love to have access to this beer."
"If someone told me that I could only drink this beer until I died, I wouldn't mind all that much."
"Poors a beautiful ruby color with an amber / buttery head. Strong hop taste really cuts through nicely without offending. Extremely drinkable mouth feel. This is a 4 season brew....enjoyable year round. I'm rating it lower in a bottle than I did from a Growler as it didn't hold a candle to my previous taste from the tap."
"Green Flash seems to specialize in hop-soaked beer. Extra Pale Ale, West Coast IPA and Imperial IPA are great. Nut Brown, Ruby Red and Trippel... not so much. Hop Head Red is the best one yet. It's a tour de force of flavor and bitterness that every hophead should seek out. Highly recommended."
"A highly drinkable beer for hopheads, and something that all beer lovers should at least try. They do big, hoppy beers at Green Flash, but every one I've had so far has been delicious. The Hop Head Red is no exception."
"D - Easy to session but overall not going to be at the top of my list in the style to grab."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle bought as a single for $2.50 at Andersons in Columbus. The beer is dark copper colored with a thick tan lacing foam. The smell is mostly hops. The taste is OK, more bitter than I like even for a hopped ale, not enough flavors from the hops, just the bitterness. Overall OK but not exceptional, nowhere near as good as Nugget Nectar."
"Great West Coast beer. I wish this were easier to get in GA. We will probably be picking up much more of this and other Green Flash beers on our winter trip to CA."
"Overall impression: A big, well balanced, hoppy amber. Probably one of my favorite ambers. Glad to see Green Flash in OH!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a trusty pint glass. Poured a nice dark red color with a thick amount of white head that sticks to the side of the glass. Smell is spicy hops with plenty of that very specific Amarillo hops that you love/are sick of. A lot of malty aroma is powerful as well. Taste is hoppy with some strong malt. Very creamy mouth feel that coats my tongue. I would drink more if the price was right."
"Very flavorful and the bitterness in the finish may reduce drinkability, but a very interesting red ale."
"Umm, looks kinda red with the tan head but oh my god is this hoppy unlike any other Red ale you will ever taste. Big ass hop nose and a big ass hop taste. A dryness to the finish and a lack of big malt backbone make this a hopheads dream. Even hoppier than the IPA this is one of these HOP beers that is unexpected."
"Pours a dark cloudy almost ice tea color. Big frothy beige head that smells of hop and malt, yummy. I let the head disappear before drinking, and it left big sticky lacing all around. I let warm up pretty good before drinking, if its going to taste anything like it smells and looks, I want to taste it. Big hop up front, with some oily pine bitter finish. Wow, big floral hop with citrus and malt. Super good warmer, makes this a sipper, I don't want this to end. I think I could drink a few of these, if I could get it."
"D: Tasty, even with a bit of off flavors. Not sure how I feel about sessioning this."
"Appears a deep caramel amber hue with a large off white head foating above the body, at least two fingers worth of head develop with lacing left behind evenly in thick bands. Aromatics have a huge grapefruit mix with pine accents from the raw west coats hops a sweet caramel and brown suga malt base exists as well, the flavors comes off earthy, herbal, and citrus peels with pine accents a healhty amount of flowing bitterness with just enough minimal; sweetness to balance it out. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with hop oils streaking across the palate and an even natural carbonation level to boot. Drinkability is hoppy in your face red ale that I've enjoyed both from the bottle and tap with some finnesse to deliver across my palate one pretty friggin' good hop bomb available to me thank god."
"De Vinos/$11/6 pack"
" A bit too bitter for my taste, but the malt sure does try to balance the situation."
"D: The best comment that I can make about the drinkability goes back to a night at Beachwood. I sat by the wait station and every thrid beer that they poured (out of 21 taps) was a Hop Head Red."
"Cheers!"
"D: Drinks alright, but it's hops and little else. Would be a lot better if the flavor lasted longer and had some fruity aspects."
"Pours a clean deep amber/ copper color, with a tan head. In the aroma, big grapefruity hops, with a small sweet malt. In the taste, mainly a sweet malt, and kind of sticky. A smooth, medium mouthfeel, with a small, dry, grapefruity hop aftertaste. Smells like an IPA, drinks like a red ale. Nice and good."
"I think getting a good beer from the tap is better than any other serving type, and so it goes that I would love this. Want to try it in bottle before I annoint it fully as my new favorite, but if you find this gem, but it, drink it and brag to your friends."
"D: nothing stopping you from having a few of these unless you wanna give your tastes buds a break."
"great, hoppy red ale. could pass as an IPA"
"It's a great beer and certainly a hop head's dream amber beer."
"12 ouncer, no freshness info to be had. Pours typical darker amber, medium tan head and spotty lace. Nice whiff of fruity hops in the nose. Not usually a big fan of Amber/red ale (sort of boring compared to the DIPAs I crave) But this one obviously kicks up the hops and doesn't disappoint. Dry hopping adds the desirable hop fruitiness and bitterness. Notes of pineapple hops, darker malts and overall beery goodness, fine high class and tasty brew from SD's GF"
"D - This is a big, bold hop monster of a brew from Green Flash with tons of flavor packed in. Glad to have tried this on tap!"
"D - A really great beer and a good showcase of hops with balancing malt. A bit of an intense experience; I probably wouldn't have more than two at a time."
"Mouthfeel is of heavy grapefruit with medium bodied brew with a spritzy, bitter yet balanced brew."
"I had listened to allot of ""hype"" surrounding this beer so I was prepared to be let down, but to my surprise it was actually better than expected! This is a truly delicious brew that despite the copious amounts of hops is really very balanced. It has a very deep reddish-brown color with just enough malt to balance the hop profile. If you're looking for a sweeter malty red or American amber then this will probably be too hoppy but as the label indicates if you are interested in a variation on an IPA then it will not disappoint. It's rare for me to drink the same beer back to back as I have a case of beer drinking ADD but as soon as I finished my first Hop Head Red I was reaching for a second."
"Pours a reddish amber/brown with a fairly thick, pancake head that settles to a cap eventually. Some decent lacing as well. The bottle says 6% and Amarillo dry-hopped. Smells very well integrated with caramel malt and spicy hops with a touch of cinammon. Nice. Quite a bit more hops in the taste. Immediately there are earthy, piney, spicy hops with lingering bitterness. The malt definitely plays second fiddle here. On the finish, there is a bit more of the red character from the malt. There is a creamy smoothness that rounds the dges a bit that you sometimes get with some of the better reds. It is definitely here. Quite enjoyable, especially for a red, and the amazing thing is that the abv is kept well in check for all the flavor here. Kudos!"
"For a proven very capable San Diego brewery to release a dry hopped beer named 'Hop Head' it wouldn't have been unreasonable to ask for more hops. Yes, the beer is hoppy but both smell and taste left a fair bit to be desired. I didn't take it to be quite red ale nor quite an IPA, and although quite good, it didn't really have enough of the character of either style to really work for me. That being said it is yet another solid offering from Green Flash."
"Well balanced and drinkable, though I'd stop short of calling it sessionable."
"Drinkability: I only got one bottle but I'd easily get a six-pack in the future. Green Flash continues to kick ass and brew some truly west coast beers."
"Drinkability: Drinkability suffers a bit in my opinion, from the sweetness and overall massiveness of this brew. Pretty decent overall."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a nonic. Dark copper but not too dark to see that it's perfectly clear. Light tan head leaves ample lacing. Aroma is on the hoppy side, with a rather herbal quality coming through more so than the typical grapefruit. Flavor is similar. Lots of dry leafy hops with a touch of citrus, and only a bare minimum malt profile. Lack of malt makes this beer thinnish."
"Green Flash has done it again! And in style..."
"My favorite Green Flash beer so far and one I'll be looking for in the future."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a very nice off-white head. The aroma is sweet malt with a ton of resinous citrus and piney hops, tons of grapefruit! The taste is amazing, I have had very few beers as smooth. Extremely well balanced, with a good malt backbone supporting a delicious hop profile. Overall, Green Flash Hop Head Red Ale is a delicious beer that is highly recommended."
"I love this beer, but it certainly isn't for everyone."
"A slick creamy start to the mouthfeel followed by a rough twinge almost metallic, dryness to the finish. I'm not an overall fan of this one but it is interesting enough to try again and I do recommend to others for at least one try."
"I can see how the bitterness could begin to wear on me if I were to session this which brings down the drinkability, but still a very nice beer. Red IPA? An apt description in my opinion. Cheers!"
"The second bottle is a bit lighter due to the recognition of flavor combination. A nice beer to enjoy really COLD too."
"Overall- A big hoppy amber! Very smooth and very drinkable."
"Draught at Falling Rock. Very dark red color with ample foam. Big time hop nose, impressive smelling. Hints of grapefruit and big time resin. Basically it smelled like a big sack of hops. Flavor is big on resinous hops and packs a punch. Nicely hopped, but also a nice malt backing as well. This was a very nice red ale."
"Overall: As the label says, it's definitely a red IPA. So if you're looking for a standard red ale, look elsewhere. If, however, you're looking for a beer that packs a punch with the hops, look no further."
"Finally got to try this beer on cask at Taproom in PB. Came out almost like it was on nitro with a cascading bubble appearance and tight frothy head that wouldn't disappear. Nice aroma packed full of hops. Can definitely tell the difference that this one is dry hopped with about a half pound of amarillo or something. Tasted like the same Hop Head Red I'm used to but packed full of hop flavor and aroma with a nice maltiness that balances it out just right. Luscious mouthfeel from the cask conditioning and this thing is so drinkable I couldn't take it away from my face. I had two of them, and I usually never get the same beer twice at a bar."
"Feel and drinkability were above average. Surely part of this is due to the firkin factor, I'll try again on CO2 soon."
"D: An unusual representation of the style that's a nice change from a usual weak red ale, but I prefer something from in the Troeg's style a little more for drinkability where hops are understated and complex rather than hammering your palate."
"Overall, a one dimensional brew for the hop lovers. I prefer a little more balance and the brighter hops."
"D/O:As I mentioned earlier, the fact that this beer leans so heavily on the bittering hops may be great for some, but I'd prefer a bit more balance, especially after all the great floral and citrus I detected in the smell. I could drink a few of them, but would probably switch it up after that."
"A nice hoppy big red from Green Flash. I bet this tastes even better on a cask engine."
"On tap at The PB Tap Room. I've had this beer many times but the best was at PB Tap Room. Juicy hop aroma with some grapefruit. The dry hopped Amarillo works great in this beer. Creamy mouthfeel with a hint of vanilla. Bitter with a good amount of malt sweetness to back it up. Good stuff."
"Good body and carbonation. Easy to drink. Pretty balanced. Solid."
"I wouldn't really consider this a Red Ale at all. To me I tastes just like another typical IPA. Decent balance of flavors but it definitely doesn't stay true to the style of beer."
"Notes: Good brew,Good hops and I look forward to having some more as I love the style and felt the hops were just right. Simply a good session beer."
"Had this at the Brickskellar in DC. Light brown head, fully diminished, frothy. Aroma - pine, spruce, resin, not heavy. Taste - light initial with long aftertaste. The hopiness lingers on the tongue. Not much in the way of grapefruit/citrus. Kinda dry."
"Drinks good, but I think this one either over power me or my taste buds after about 4. Super amber! If they used different hops to dry hop, I'm sure this would score higher (for me)"
"Crisp and refreshing with a big bolt of savory bitterness. Green Flash makes good beer!"
"Flavorful beer that is well balanced and a pleasure too drink."
"Pours an unfiltered ruby red with a pillowy head. Note the citrus grapefruit hop of the amarillo hops. american amber? Wow this beer screams hops n the taste-hops coating my tongue-oily resin with a citrus sharpness-malt? its there but is hidden-mouthfeel is medium and drinkabilty very good. nice to see this in 6-packs-had it at the brewery last year and I am very happy tp find at my local beer store"
"this is a nice reddish amber color with a nice off white head that fades but doesn't completely disappear. the little bursting bubbles give off a nice piney citrus aroma, leading into the taste which is also quite quite hoppy but with a nice toasted caramel maltiness to it. the mouthfeel is quite well balanced, in fact i think I'll shut up and drink."
"A good brew but I'd have to agree with RblWthCoz that it is a bit tight and lacks complexity"
"Flavor is earthy as well. Very leaf and soil like. Robust and deep, it's a bit more open than when I had it on-tap. I felt it was a bit too tight then and this is a bit looser, but it's still a bit uptight. Call it curt if you will. Feel has a good liquid body and the carbonation is decent enough. A robust hoppy red. Nice to drink, but not really bringing any mass of complexity."
"Pour a dark red hued tea color with a big foamy light tan head that fades fairly quickly, leaving a nice sheets of lacing. Visibly effervescent, tiny pools of bubbles scatter about the surface. The smell is aggressive, fragrant and piny over a fundamentally earthy malt.The mouth feel is bright and medium bodied. Full flavored piny resin and caramel malt taste lingers really well. The dry hopped nature is vibrant and it dominates the caramel malt beneath. I appreciate the suggestion that it's a Red IPA. A bit on the pricey side, but the 6% ABV is very sessionable. This one has potentially significant recreational opportunity. A lot to this one, highly recommended!"
"D: Fairly easy but the high bitterness and slimy feel hurts this one."
"D - Fine, fine red w/ plenty of hoppiness deserving of the name and very easy to drink. This is a top notch Red ale and I wouldn't hesitate to grab it if I see again"
"Overall a very fine brew. Big enough that the hopheads will love it, and balanced enough for everyone else. Flavor is rich and full with an excellent mouthfeel."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head over the slightly cloudy red brew. Head falls ever-so slowly, with sporadic chunky lacing. Aroma is pretty much totally neutral for me. Taste is follows along with the nose, but doesn't overdo it, everything flows together nicely. No evidence to me that we're playing 7.6%abv ball here. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, and drinkability is great for a brew that touts itself as being hoppy. Those usually seem to overachieve. Will find this one again."
"D - I can see this being a good session beer. I think tho I had my expectations set too high. None the less, this is a really great beer."
"Pours a murky dark amber hue with particles floating in here and there. The thick one fingered light khaki colored head slowly dies down to a rocky layer of bubbles. Stickiness is insanely good, lots of webbing left on the sides of the glass. The initial smell is floral hops with a touch of caramel malts with a slightly metallic undertone. Grassy with a hint of pine in the nose as well. A creamy honey scent blends in well with this one. The sweet malts begin on the tongue but are quickly dominated by the hop character. A good amount of pine and earthy hops midway that lead to a pretty dry and bitter aftertaste. Damn, this is an Red Ale? Slick medium body with a full, creamy feel and a stinging carbonation. A good beer, but I like the style more on the malty side. This is clearly a West Coast version of the Amber/Red Ale. This could easily pass as an East Coast IPA, whoa hops."
"Deep copper-red color with a thick creamy head. Sweet hop aroma with citrus notes. Flavors of citrus, pine bitterness linger on the tongue. with an underlinging malt sweetness. Hops are pretty evident but not overpowering. The finish is pretty long and dry."
"Pours a ruby brown,with a fluffy tan head. Excellent retention,and laceing. Aroma is of grassy piney hops,and some carmel malts. Body is medium with some carbonation. Taste was a bad mix of hops and malts. Just didn't taste right to me. Finish left a bad taste. I expected a lot better. Looks like I'm in the minority though.maybe I got a bad bottle."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a brown/ruby red color with about an inch beige head. Lacing and head retention are both very good. The aroma is citrusy/grassy hops, bread and caramel malt. It smells nice, but the aroma isn't very strong. Luckily the flavor is much stronger than the aroma. It tastes like it smells, and there's a good balance between the hops and malt. Good bitter hoppy aftertaste, too. The aftertaste does linger around a while! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and rich with average carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it wouldn't be hard to put away a few of these. I think this is a good brew, I'll have to buy it again the next time I find it."
"Hoping Green Flash makes it to RI soon."
"On-tap at Zeno's in State College... now smoke-free! This beer is all around good representation of the style. Nothing really stands out in my mind about this beer (in both a positive and a negative way) I left the bar, thinking it was a decent drinkable beer, maybe not as hoppy as the name would imply. But as I'm walking down the street the citrus bitterness was just never ending. Maybe it was just because I became aware of it, but it felt like the bitterness was growing instead of fading. 20 minutes later I still had a wonderful flavor in my mouth. Loved it. It's worth a try, I think."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark cloudy amber/brown with floaters (not sure if its suppose to have that...) with 2 cm foamy off white head. Aroma of rye and some hops. Initial flavors fruit and rye. Flavor ends more hoppy. Aftertaste is bitter and metalic. Lots of lacing, some carbonation, light body, and couldn't appreciate the alcohol presence. Overall kinda disappointing, but still a solid rye, too much build up."
"This is a nice one to try, but be sure to try the West Coast first!"
"Hoppy as hell with a bitter, lingering aftertaste. Lots of grass, pine and citrus. There's a big malt body behind it all but it's not really a fantastic brew. Damn, I really wanted to love this beer but it's just average. Nice to drink on a hot day but nothing I'd go out of my way to buy."
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid roasted and bisquit malt scent along with a mild hop aroma. It's dry with a good dose of bitterness. The taste is great. It has a smooth crystal, roasted, and bisquit malt flavor that goes down toastey and finishes with an excellent hop taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very good beer. Hoppy red ales are really flooding the market lately and I couldn't be happier. This is an exceptional beer. Recommended."
"Finish has grapefruit bitterness and is somewhat dry."
"Another fine offering from Green Flash."
"Poured from bottle to a shaker pint. Pours a nice red/auburn color with a huge fluffy head with an aggressive pour. First aroma is of swet caramel or malt then some nice citrusy hops. Good full flavvor with some malt smoothness but ending with a bitter hop bite. Lingering bitter aftertaste with hints of alcohol. Overall, very drinkable and a great effort on a hoppy red ale by green flash."
"D - A nice hop fix that goes down easy. I could get my hop fix off this brew in the current summer heat or in cooler temps."
"D - Quaffable, definately."
"Nice dark amber to garnet appearance. A bubbly head gives way to a nice thick fluffy sheet of lace that goes the distance with multiple rings of cling. Sweet juicy citrus tangerine and red ruby grapefruit nose. Classic Amarillo goodness. Some sweet carmel malts blend with a slight tobacco note as well. Rich toffee and caramel flavors blend with nice array of citrus hop flavors. The finish has a nice lingering but not overbearing bitterness as well as a slightly sweet berry like flavor. This is an ultra rich and hoppy red ale. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Drinks very easy, just about sessionable at 6%. Yeah, this is a hoppy red ale, but who the hell cares? Great stuff."
"Well rounded and entertainingly hoppy."
"D: I could have another, but I would rather have something else. Interesting I guess."
"We need more hoppy Reds out there! Overall, Hop Head Red hit the spot for me, and I wish I had regular access to this brew. I would love to do a side-by-side with Nugget Nectar to compare...I believe Hop Head would stand its own. Highly recommended."
"D'ability - The beer is called ""Hop Head"". If you are one, you'll find it very drinkable (particularly if you like Amarillo hops). Ultimately the hops were a bit much for me in this beer."
"Wow! I think a found a new session beer (even at 6%). This was just fantastic, with full rich flavors (including great hop bitterness) and was drinkable as heck! I drank this so fast, that I was almost done with it before I realized that I hadn't even reviewed the body yet. Very nicely done Green Flash and thanks for bottling this. Great stuff!"
"07/08 - after having this on tap I have to bump the smell score, nice."
"D: An interesting beer from Green Flash, an IRA, definitely worth a shot, but I much prefer their regular IPA."
"Body is medium, creamy, oily, and mouthcoating with a penetrating hop finish. Very drinkable and worth seeking."
"For my money, I'd invest in the Green Flash West Coast IPA before this beer, but Hop Head Red is an interesting twist on an amber ale and well worth trying."
"Poured a very clouded amber. Not much in the way of a head. Smell is rather mild. Which is a bit surprising when you get the first sip which attacks you with dry hops. You would expect something this highly hopped to have more of an aroma. Odd. There isn't much to this beer other than hops. This is a decent beer to get your hop fix on but nothing extraordinary. Kind of a bit raw tasting. Mouthfeel is decent enough. Medium body medium carbonation."
"Pours dark amber with a thin head. Nice lacing. Big hop smell which is borderline IPA. Taste is very hoppy but has the amber ale flavor as well. Mouthfeel is smooth & it has a good bite to it. Cheers to a fine brew from Green Flash."
"D- Crazy good. Could this be better than Nugget Nectar or Red's Rye....I would love to have a side by side showdown. I love you HH Red!"
"Overall, a very pleasant experience and I am looking forward to trying this again. I plan to pick this up in bottles (definitely plural, this is worth having on hand to share) to see how the taste compares."
"Drinkability- Was hoping for a bit more, but was satisfied with the outcome. A bit more balanced would have made this a much better, if not outstanding beer. Needs some more sweetness."
"This beer goes down easy, medium bodied and a pleasant suprise. They didnt go for too much, just an overall good beer."
"Hop Head Red is a stand-up Amber Ale that hopheads should try out."
"D - abv is 6%, this is very drinkable."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Great stuff... Definitely recommended..."
"D: One pint is enough, my tastebuds may never recover. I have always been a hophead but this one may be too liberal for me."
"Green Flash, THANK YOU!!"
"Pours a hazy deep amber with a thin head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing. Aroma is deep pine hops and burnt caramel in a nice balance. The taste is bitter pine hops followed by a nice caramel sweetness that lingers as a nice balance. The beer is on the light side of medium with low carbonation, just a little bit on the bitter side. While not the best hoppy amber ale I've had, it's the best (and I'm pretty sure the only) one I've seen here in NC."
"I think it's best to let this one warm up just a little to avoid the green dry-hop flavors and bring out the malts. Tasty."
"Mouth-feel is good, easy to drink but that herbal bitterness would prevent this one from being a session beer for me."
"The taste was good, but a bit too bitter for the style. Sweet caramel malts hit first, but were soon overpowered by a pungently bitter hoppiness. As I said, I love hoppy beers, but this one probably fits the IPA category a little better. The mouthfeel was light in body as per the style, smooth, slightly sticky, and left a whopping, resinous pine note on the back of the tongue. Overall, though, I liked this beer. Green Flash certainly lives up to its ""west-coast hop bomb"" credentials, although I would've liked to have seen them tone down the hops (or turn up the malts!) a bit in this one."
"Overall this beer is a bit harsh, although some might like this. It needs a bit more balance to improve drinkablility. Worth a try..."
"Another winner from this brewery!"
"All in all, a slight miss in my opinion. I like hops as much as the next hophead, but this 'style' which is becoming more and more prevalent thus leading to better examples than this, needs a strong malt showing to really be great."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into 20oz Harp Glass. Color is a wonderfully deep mahogany. Almost a ruby red when held up to light. Manly pour results in a 3 finger fluffy head, that slowly reseeds leaving moderate to light lacing. Smell is absolutely a hop heads dream. Massive citrus floral bouquet. Rich is probably the best way to describe this beverage. Malt backed coppery ale, with massive amounts of hops. Very well balanced, nice dry finish. This is a very nice beer!"
"Green Flash brews some terrific beers, and this is a good component of their portfolio. You should definitely grab a pint if you find it in cask."
"On tap at Stone for the San Diego Storm. Dark cherry color with a foamy and rocky light tan head. The smell was so unique that I've never experienced it before. It was the smell of hop pellets straight from the homebrew store. Very dank and volatile. The taste was malty, maybe more toasty toward the end of the sip, and quite a bit citrusy and resiny. An interesting beer, overall a bit much for me to drink a lot of but the glass was pleasant."
"This is a very good ""red ale."" I don't really see how it's all that different from an IPA, but I don't really care either. It's good, and anyone who likes hops should give it a try. Recommended."
"The beer poured a dark reddish-amber (with small chunks of Amarillo hops used to dry hop, I'm assuming) with a thick tan head into a pint glass. There was an intensely resinous-piney aroma of hops - awesome. The initial taste was of sweet malt, but shortlived, as the resinous hop flavor took over, followed by a clean, crisp hop bitterness at the finish. A great IPA and another success by Green Flash. You can't beat the IPAs coming out of California right now (i.e. Green Flash, Stone, Lagunitas)."
"Another delicious hoppy brew from these guys. Glad I picked up a sixer and not just a single."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, slightly creamy, a little slick, carbonation not very noticeable. Decent drinkability. Good in a lot of ways, but maybe slightly off balance in the taste department."
"Nice solid beer from Green Flash."
"Color is a dark brick-red brown with a moderate white head. Smells of citrus, almost like an IPA. Tastes of malt as you would expect, as well as a decent dose of citrusy hops, as if it was blended with a hoppy pale ale. But the hops don't overwhelm--the blend of flavors is right on the money. A very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"Quite a likeable ale but it is strong hoppy stuff and completely unsuited to lager drinkers. If you like hops and Brown Ale you will love this stuff."
"Very nice reddish color. Off white head. Aroma is somewhat muted-not as out there as I would have thought. Quite grapefruity. Big hop flavor and bitterness. Harsh hop bite in the finish. Slight trace of caramel sweetness. The harshness knocks it down a notch for me. Decent body. A decent beer for the most part. If this is strictly amarillo hops its good to see them stand out on their own. I know some folks here dont care for them. ABV listed @ 6%."
"reddish brown with a tan head that held well and left pretty nice lace. nose was caramelly and citrus hoppy with some earthiness in the background. very nice. taste was the same with a little nutty woodsiness. i found it to be very well balanced. hops were just enough to feed the jones, but not enough to destroy the balance. medium full body with a nice bitterness in the finish. very easy drink and perfect for the time of year. another top notch brew from green flash. it might not please someone who is expecting a super hop bomb that will knock them on their ass, but it should very well please anyone hoping to enjoy a few nice, well balanced beers that contain a few subtle nuances."
"Dark amber/ reddish-brown color with a creamy light tan head. Aromas of pine bark, cedar, toasty caramel malt and brown rice syrup. Pleasant balance of woodsy coniferous flavor with the caramel malt. This has a sort of Pacific Northwest ESB kinda thing going on. Great with a crisp spring or fall day and a flannel shirt. Some hopheads might wish this had more IBUs (only 45) but I think that any more would upset the balance (even though say - 60 IBUs might be more to some people's liking for a 6% alc. beer). Medium-to-full body with a nice bitter finish on top of the caramel malt. This beer grows on you, but only if you let go of any hopes, ideas, or preconceived notions of a hop orgy, and just tune in to what's actually going on in your glass."
"I always look forward to a good hoppy amber/red ale and Green Flash is the shiznit so I really was happy to pick up a few of these bottles yesterday here in Greensboro.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear deep bronze borderline amber color with a thick fluffy two finger slight off white head that never totally settled,deep chocolate notes in the nose with a some herbal hop but the malt to me is stronger than the hop presence.I love the Amarillo hop and this was dry hopped with it but in all honesty it doesnt play a huge impact flavor wise at least in my mind,its deeply chocolaty with a leafy herbal hop presence finish dry and prety earthy.Its a decent brew but maybe a bit underwhelming."
"D: A nice combination of bitter and sweet notes. A worthy brew."
"This is another good Green Flash offering. I could drink them all night."
"Very nice example of style, a la St. Rogue. Enjoyable and quaffable enough."
"EDIT: First attempt of this from the bottle and it was quite delicious. Not really similar to Nugget Nectar as I tried to compare, but both are super in their own right."
"Could drink a fair share of this brew"
"D- Wow, this is one of my new favorite reds. Definitely more hoppy than most other red ales, it is still quite balanced and the abv (i am guessing around 5%?) is well-masked. I think you can only get this on draft/growler, so hopefully Green Flash will bottle this in the near future so everyone can enjoy this big, bold, hoppy, Red Ale."
"This is a solid beer that strikes a good balance for an American red ale."
"D- sessionable, solid flavor, good balancve, enjoyable, good red, unique to see one so balanced as opposed to hoppy. i'd have another"
"Pours a mahogany/red. Not much in the way of a head. Smell is rather mild. Which is a bit surprising when you get the first sip which attacks you with piney hops. You would expect something this highly hopped to have more of an aroma. Odd. There isn't much to this beer other than hops. This is a decent beer to get your hop fix on but nothing extraordinary. Kind of a bit raw tasting. Mouthfeel is decent enough. Medium body medium carbonation. I could probably not drink too many of these due to the raw quality and lack of any notion of balance."
