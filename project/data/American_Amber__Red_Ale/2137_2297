It doesn't have much of a foamy head, but that's okay. I think it's true to its kind and would not be impossible to enjoy more than one in a sitting. Also doesn't need food to appease the palate, although it would accompany a nice pizza or deli sandwich, steak or chicken dish with no problem. Would buy again.","ThisLadyLovesBeer","Jan 11, 2014"

Smell is of malt, slight caramel, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is easy to drink but it seems fairly watery and lacking all around.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 04, 2014"

I'm tempted to say it's an off color golden ale, and nearly lager-ish in the mouth, so it's far more on the malt side of things and probably should be paired with a sandwich and salad to bring it alive. By itself, I'm enjoying the nose more than I am the beer itself or perhaps I need to try it again in the summer time when this kind of flavor profile has something more to work with. It smells of some brown sugar and possibly a bit sour and some of the grain is coming in, with a slight plum presence. I'll bury one for a hotter day, but at the moment.

Nose is not much to write home about - cereal grains and a trace of noble hops if I had to guess. Taste follows nose and culminates in a slightly bready aftertaste. There's also a faint citrus character present. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively effervescence and a crisp finish. A pretty lackluster American Amber - closer to a macro in taste and smell.

Aromatics are a bit timid with watery caramel and some mineral tones peeking through as well. Not much hop action going on in the nose or flavor and the aroma just smells like some grains watered down with minimal caramel notes. Flavor is pretty expected of Breckenridge, flagship amber comes watery and not real assertive or cohesive with the flavors. Minimal toasted nut with caramel and a tart grain husk offness, not much hop flavor with minimal bitterness from the lack of hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a watery feel with a sharp bitey mouthfeel mainly from the carbonation level. Drinkability is pretty weak not a beer I would welcome back in the future, I'd rather drink fresh Goose Island Honker's for 6.50 a sixer or better yet some cans of Yuengling Amber Lager.

Metallic notes work in the opposite direction of the sweet base and creates a conflict with my pallet that I just can't get passed. Some light fruitiness and earthy hoppiness is an effort at complexity and flavor, sadly this falls well short of a complete finish, and really it was off to a poor start.

Definitely not a bad thing, but not necessarily my favorite. Very faint hops found anywhere. The taste is smooth, malty and slightly metallic on the swallow. There is almost a touch or rye spiciness on the swallow. The bittering hops come through a bit and add a layer of coarse dryness. Body is moderately full, but easy drinking.

It's got a just slightly hazy deep-amber/orange body and creamy antiqued-white head. The retention and lacing are good. The aroma is nice, particularly if you enjoy the yeast character, and there's a bit of subtly sweetish caramel malt and grassy and leafy hops present as well. The flavor is well-balanced with malt and yeast character stepping forward, and hops and bitterness following. There's a mild fruitiness to it like apricot, apples, and pears, but the yeast also leaves it almost a touch ""bloody"" or iron-like. I find it reminiscent of Bateman's XXX.

A slight metallic taste is also evident, mainly at warmer temperatures. A low hop flavor is also there. The mouthfeel is rather thin and has medium carbonation.

Looks...amber with adequate retention and lacing. Flavors are medium malty, with hop bittering to balance. Mild spices and hop flavor for accents. Finishes clean and cool. Quite a nice beer.

Nose is very grainy, almost spicey from the grain. That is really all I get from the nose. Flavor is more subdued on the grain than the nose, but it is still the dominant flavor. There is a touch of caramel sweetness that takes the edge off the graineyness. Flavors don't hang on into the finish much at all other than the nice toasted grain. Rather tasty beer. Feel is very solid moderate with a light carbonation. This is a pretty enjoyable beer. As with many, nothing makes it stand out, but there are no overriding flaws that would keep me away from it.

Flavors start out simple, brown sugar maltiness, fairly straightforward, but with a little orangey tang that magnifies to a decent hoppiness and balance toward the back of the profile.

A unique, and almost sharp honey - like sweetness is almost balanced by the hop bitterness, but sweet malt flavors are certainly in the forefront.
