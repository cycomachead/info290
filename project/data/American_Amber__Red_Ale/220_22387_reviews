"I great beer. Smooth hoppy taste with a great amber red color. Had a good 1.5"" head and was very crisp. Definitely adding this on to the top favorites list."
""

"Imperial Red pours a reddish color with a nice large lacing head.  There is a very earthy aroma, and very earthy taste, with some big hop flavors.  Nice flavors, good body, but the earthy flavors are just too much."

"Not as malty as expected in a red, but that is why the imperial comes in.  I was actually hoping for more maltiness, but enjoyed this beer.  The color and head are wonderful with a wonderful IPA smell.  The finish is smoother than most imp IPAs."

"great balance of hop, malt, and alcohol (never too much of either) to produce a easy drinking stronger brew. label sez it's an ""exhumation"" of their very first ale.  hitting that perfect balance may have something to do with this solid brewery's consistent standing and respect.  thanks for a real enjoyable, well-crafted bomber!"
""
""
" The taste is very good with a bitter pine hop flavor with slight grapefruit accent and mild tangy yeast with subtle tangerine and a light caramel from the malt in the taste. Overall I really enjoyed this it has plenty of hops with noticeable alcohol, but not out of the ordinary for the strength. I would drink this again -very good example of the style."

"i got this 22 oz bomber yesterday and i pour the brew into tulip glassware...thick 2 fingers foam stay atop for 30 to 40 seconds. while the aromas relieve sweet fruity. i tasted it and it tasted really good -hazy red amber bodied with sweet note on the end great beer for amber ale."

"Enjoyed from a bomber, this red ale pours a thick copper red color with a firm off white head and solid lacing.  Nose of biscuit, sweet malts, as well as citrus and pine hops.  Flavors follow the taste with grapefruit, orange peel, caramel and biscuit like malts, and a bittering hops in the background.  A decent imperial red, although more of a red ipa."
""
""
""
"The beer poured a deep copper mahogany color with a substantial off white head. The aroma was of a piney and citrusy hop with a bit of toffee malt underneath. The taste followed with an initial sweet malt that quickly jumped into a mega hop dose of slight resinous pine and more citrus and tropical fruit bitterness. It leaves a burnt toffee and hop bitterness on your tongue between pulls and even has hints of floral hops as the flavor lingers. This Imperial Red Ale from Lagunitas has me back on the red ale fence."
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz bottle poured in pint glass.  Beer is red amber, as promised, with a thick, orange-ish head.  Big, piney C-hop aroma.  Could be an imperial IPA if the color didn't push into into the red ale category.  Flavorwise, too, this is hop-forward, full of left coast sensibilities.  Finish is pretty dry, and light.  For what an imperial amber could have been, this is not too malty or syrupy.  There is a little nuance of residual sweetness, but it works quite nicely here.  Overall this is a well balanced West coast Red Ale and well worth enjoying."

"Overall (4.5): This is a textbook red ale if I've ever had one, bordering on perfection in my opinion. The flavors and the way they are balanced is superb. This and Nugget Nectar stand out above all the other red ales that ive experienced. Another amazing beer for the price. Probably towards the top of my favorite Lagunitas beers."
"Good stuff. Like the other reviewers say, healthy, full, rustic, still got the grapefruit, strawberry, other fruity and slightly tart notes. And 6.8% is sort of perfect ABV."
""
""
"Perfect for early Autumn, great anytime. Grab this for the weekend game-watching, cooking out, or what have you."
""
"O: The red ale was once the darling of the craft beer movement. No more. In fact, most hardened beer geeks tend to avoid them like a plague. The style has a reputation for being bland and uninteresting these days. However, if you are going to brew a red ale and expect it to sell, this is how you do it. You make sure it's big and plenty hoppy. There is nothing bland or pedestrian about this beer. It's worth your time and money."

"Poured into a large snifter from a 22oz bomber. It has a light mahogany color with a small cream colored head. It has a sweet malty aroma with a light fruity note and a hoppy hint. It tastes great. Its very balanced with a sweet malty medium body and a light hoppy bite. It has creamy Mouthfeel. Overall it's a great red. Will definitely buy again."

"O - Shouldnt be surprised that this is so good. Excellent hoppy red ale that is balanced."

"Poured ruby in color and could smell a nice sweetness while pouring. Sweet hoppy aroma. Smells really nice. Bitter taste with a good amount of sweet. Really tasty."
""
""
""
"On tap at local Brass Tap.  Usually like hoppy red ales.  Disappointed overall especially compared with other Lagunitas brews.  Nothing stood out except for bitterness not well balanced with caramel malt.  Not sure if there may have been an issue with their lines."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well hell, they say a lot of Lagunitas beers taste the same and they're right, they all taste good! I can see how this could be linked to any number of Lagunitas beers as far as taste, but so what, it's too damn good to gripe about."
"Pours a deep, dark copperish-amber color with a huge light brown foam head, that dissipates after a bit. A ton of lacing. Aroma is remarkable; sweet caramel malts followed by some citrus hops, grapefruit, orange and a bit of sugar (can't tell if its my nose playing tricks, but the combined aromas give it a candy type smell). The taste features more malts, with sweet caramel leading the way, with some brown sugar added. Biscuit/bread malts are very present as well. Citrus shines through as it warms. Remarkably well balanced. A bit of pine sticks of the tongue as it goes down. This one is dangerously easy to drink-- I feel like I could have two more in the next hour. The alcohol is masked expertly, with very little sign of its moderate level. Not much carbonation. Overall, another solid entry from Lagunitas. Easy to drink, and a great deal for the price. Strongly recommend."

"Amber reddish hue with excellent clarity.  Brussels lacing.   A half inch of khaki colored head is on top.  Aroma of caramel,piney hops,and saltine crackers.  The flavor is a well balanced portfolio of caramel malt and piney hops,but finishes fairly impartial and with no lingering note.  The mouth is fairly dry."

"Beautiful Color....Pleasing Hoppy Aroma....Smooth Drinkability followed by a Slight Bitter After Taste...Mild Carbonation...All with an Above Average ""Kick"" (7.8% ABV).... Everything adds up to a really good Red Ale that is a Pleasure to drink. Yes Sir May I Have Another!"

"O- As far as ambers go, this is one of the best. Nice twist mixing the citrus with the classic amber flavor."
""
"9/7...bomber pours. Heavy dark crimson red. Foam settles and then stays. Burnt bready malt. Pine wintergreen trees too. Taste opens caramel, malt, little sweet. Takes a right turn to push a heavy hop bitter. Hearty but drinkable. Full of flavor."

"D:  This is a solid American Amber and well worth checking out for the price.  Great hop flavor with a nice resinous bitter bite and plenty of malt to balance.  Lagunitas kills it when I need my hop fix on a budget.  This Imperial Red is far better than others priced at twice as much sitting on the shelves.  Will be another go to for me no doubt."

"Glad to see this big brute reach Alberta (non)shores. Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Dark brown-bronze color with a light stippling of light brown foam. Huge citrus hop nose as expected, grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime, along with some tropical pineapple and mango, pine needles, black tea bag, caramels. Taste is initially huge huge citrus bloom, followed by a bready/toffee middle section, and ending with some tropical fruit leather and strongly tannic tea bag. Pretty pungent and powerful but not completely overbearing. Little alcohol flavor. Fresh orange juice, brown spices, and raisins winking through. Quite fizzy and this potentiates the spicy resin effect on the tongue. I like that this stays more anchored in toffee/citrus/tea territory as opposed to the tropical realm, although the latter is certainly there. There is considerable sweetness here ... Even the head tastes sweet (said your mom). The aggressive hop regime keeps this in check, however, and the finish is decidedly tannic and bitter with a lingering fruitiness. Wonderful."

"Poured into an IPA Spiegelau glass from a 22oz bottle. Pours a golden amber with a two finger off-white head. Doesn't leave much lacing. Smells citrusy and piney with caramel notes and a little burnt toast. Taste follows the nose. A nice amount of bitterness. 54 IBU might not seem like a lot but it's just right for this brew. Maybe a bit of tropical fruit in there as well and some malty sweetness. Not a trace of alcohol in this but at 7.8% it's pretty potent.  Mouthfeel is a bit heavy. Not a sticky beer though. Carbonation is great, fits with the style. Overall, a fantastic beer and excellent example of the modern Red Ale. Is it an IPA? Is it a Red? No, it's somewhere in between and I love it just the way it is. Lagunitas never disappoints."
""

"I have somewhat unconsciously enjoyed this style for a while, and I can't say this interpretation fails, but the drying nature of this beer battles what I have generally enjoyed about the style I the past."

"Like the aroma there is a good malty start and a biting hop finale. It lingers for a bit on the end.  Reds are usually rather eh for me.  This one was one the better ones I had had in recent years."
"Winner winner, chicken dinner.  Great balance on malt and hop.  Nice reddish hues and creamy texture.  May I add also that the price point makes this a click to pick.  Abv delivers a nice little wallop.  This is not a cheap beer, but a reasonably priced brew.  All around a tremendously tremendous beer!"

"This is a solid offering from Lagunitas.  My neighbor found a bottle and shared it with me.....muchos gracias senior Johnson!!!!  The beer poured a amber clear with thick white head that laced like a Vicky secret brochure.  The scent and taste had sweet malt base with fresh hop balance.  The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall.....YUMMY!!!  Sessionable and satisfying."

"22 oz Bomber.The Red Rocker has touched down in the Antelope Valley.After 3 weeks of looking for this in the `beer stores` a friend of mine came in to work and told me he just got two Imperial red ale`s at Stator Brothers grocery store.I asked him how many they had left and he said a whole row.By the time I got in there they had two left and I gladly bought both of them and i`m glad I did.Great.Very Hoppy with a touch of citrus.This is one of those once a year beers lagunitas puts out so if you see it grab it.I loved it.7.8 ABV which makes this a nice little package.Watching the last of summer burn off outside with this fine brew listening to some Doobie Brothers and it was indeed,a very good night. .And at 4.99 a bottle,great deal.Motley out."

"I normally base my beers off of my favorite from that style and go from there. This one is good, but not my favorite. Some might say I'm crazy but I think it could be a bit maltier.  It's no where near as hoppy as green flash hop head red but I want a bit more sweetness. If I'm going to drink an amber ale I'd rather it not taste like an ipa with a touch of malt. The taste is decently bitter and it lingers more on the hoppy side. This beer is very easy to drink and quite tasty but it is not how I would represent the style. Overall a good beer that doesn't disappoint but doesn't wow me either."
""
""
"I really enjoy the style and thought the beer was thoroughly enjoyable, especially considering the $4.65 price for a bomber."

"This is often compared to Nugget Nectar, and I'm not sure why. Anyway, this brew has a great appearance--not an exceptional color, but a very nice, thick head and sticky lacing. The smell is unremarkable, but the taste is pretty nice. This is also highly drinkable, as the mouthfeel is spot-on for the style (whatever style you want to call this hybrid). Anyway, adding a lot of hops to an otherwise successful red ale just doesn't work--even though I love hops. I love the great bomber price, but the ""Imperial"" red ale falls short as the balance is lost and the style is compromised in an effort to appease hop-heads (including myself)."

"Girlfriend: Apparently, i can't say ""apparently"" without the boyfriend giving me shit about the ""apparently boy"".  Anyways, APPARENTLY I'm not too fond of the hops.  I did not trade any of my Black Rhino's Black Ale for it."

""
"Drinkability: High. Well priced, limited availability Imperial Red from a much-respected brewery. These folks have their priorities straight; thanks Lagunitas!"
"A beautiful amber orange and yellow color, a perfect blend of hops and malt in the nose and in the taste, with the smooth and creamy mouthfeel anything claiming ""imperial"" status really should have. Really, just about a perfect imperial red. Is there a better red? Until further notice, my answer's ""no""."

"new affordable bomber from lagunitas, pushing the red ipa style here, but still probably more malt driven than a red ipa would be. clear brick red in color with a tall and wispy off white head with a ton of rising bubbles collecting at the surface, very alive looking brew. the nose here is piney hops and a lot of breakfast coffee cake type red malt giving it both some lingering sweetness and plenty of body. the hops are mostly all in the finish, leaving the first half of the beer for the grain, which is sweeter but not at the expense of the hops or the finish. pine needle hop complexion is bold but not over done, we all found this to be an exceptionally easy drinking brew, especially for one almost 8% abv. clean finishing, quite refreshing, and a well made take on the style. I prefer it to the lucky 13 red beers they make, its more lively and unique. the price makes it that much better too!"
"pours orange and clear with only a few bubbles wafting toward the top to meet a creamy head of off off white foam that fell slowly and left lace. The nose is pink grapefruit with it's sweet little backing, earthy pine, some fresh orange and a biscuit like malt that promises a bit of sugar. Taste is excellent. The mouthfeel is pristine. A touch of weight from that malt and then airy lightness but smooth. Good carbonation that goes largely unnoticed. The beer is a touch sticky and lip smackingly so with a bit of resin that coats the tongue and lets a bit of the grapefruit pith and the earthy pine come through just a bit more before the creamy smooth malt rolls through to the finish. Finishes with a slight bitter that is a lovely accent to all the fruitiness of this beer."

"Poured a deep copper with a thick pillowy white head. The aroma is an excellent blend of pine hops and caramel malt. The taste is big hops balanced adeptly with an equally strong malt backbone. There is a nice full and smooth feeling to the body and a little bite from the hops on the finish. A great imperial red ale."
""

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 7/7/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine. pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toast, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately sticky, and slightly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent imperial red ale. All around great complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"3.55/5: Definitely one of the better red ales on the market"
"Really dug this one. The pour was dark red with a nice white head. The smell was a bit subdued but I was able to pick up on citrus and floral notes from the hops as well as a lot of sweet scents from the malt. The taste was great with a little burst of hops in the beginning and then a long smooth toasty flavor from the malt. Very tasty. I also liked the mouthfeel, a bit heavier than your average red but not overly thick. Would definitely recommend."
"Overall: Pretty good brew, honestly I have to put Lagunita's in my top three overall breweries. First time I have had this and not the last. Craving something to cool you off this summer, this might have been the best 5 bucks I spent. Salud!"

"O - A solid IRA."

"O - An excellent imperial red. Such an amazing beer to find in a 6 pack for a reasonable price. I will be looking to buy it again soon!"
""
"Cheers!"

"O-well balanced and flavorful. A really nice imperial red that remains drinnkable"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad effort from a really good brewery."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the citric qualities in both the nose and the taste. It really gave things a fresh, live, and organic quality. We were a bit disappointed that the great fruit from the snout didn’t translate well through the flavoring, but the hops did the trick and made them easy to forget with their juicy, citric, and fruity qualities in and of themselves. This is yet another tasty beer from a great brewery."

"Overall another winner from Lagunitas. They do it right and for a decent price."
""

"O - Not too bad. Wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't kick it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid imperial red with the trademark Lagunitas hop flavor profile. Loads of flavor and super stoked to have gotten a chance to try this brew. The abv is dangerously hidden making this a sneaky treat!"
"Easy drinking hop delight. Can't believe this is 7.8 abv. Thanks bro for this one. Truly not one to miss. Sadly I have only this one, but I will keep my eye out for this - even though it is a limited release. Unbelievable drinkability in spite of the abv."

"overall another winner from lagunitas, a brewery that continues to impress with fantastic yet reasonably priced beer and widespread distribution. this one wasn't my favorite from them but very good nonetheless. keep 'em comin'!"
""
""
""
"O - I don't like it all that much. Unbalanced and just unnecessary. It isn't undrinkable, but I won't buy it again."
"O-Another great beer from Lagunitas! Reminds me a lot of Troegs Nugget Nectar, which is a winner! Would definitely like to have this one around A LOT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a well done big amber, both big and balanced in flavour, Lagunitas delivers as usual"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Just a notch or 2 behind nugget nectar in my books. I think I've enjoyed every Lagunita's beer I've ever had and this one is no different. Worth picking up for sure. I just wish they made their bottling dates a little easier to find."
""
"Overall - This is one of my all-time favorite beers. The Flavor, aroma and color is just wonderful. I can't get enough of this beer. Will definitely be stocking up on it."
"I poured this overly hopped beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice red color. The head poured was also pretty nice. The beer had a heck of a hoppy smell and indeed had a heck of a hoppy taste. Tasted like eating a blended Christmas tree. Had a decent malty after taste that would have been nice if the spruce flavor would not have annihilated it. I will not buy again."

"O: This is an imperial (and pretty red) hop bomb. Well balanced smell and taste, giving you a nectar like experience with a little alcoholic warming effect."
""
"first of all let me praise the artist they have because even the word red looks great in this bottle. Opened the beer pored into glass and was amazed with its strong red color. Head was about inch high,but did not stay for a wile. Smell was great with the classic laguntitas hop, hints of citrus pine and herbs. Mouthfeel was a little bit harder than smooth. Taste was great with hints of toasted malts and the classic lagunitas bitternes feel. Overall had a great experience and will get beer anytime i see it on a shelf."
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
"Will probably buy my own sixer of this."
"The beer is golden orange with a half inch of tan head. Good retention and plenty of lacing. The aroma offers a bouquet of citrus, followed by malt and a bit of alcohol. Nice flavor. Hop forward, but still a strong malty foundation. Balanced and enjoyable. Medium bodied with a light bitterness in the finish. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise. I definitely see a sixer of this in my future."
"Medium body, nice feel in the mouth. Slight warmth from alcohol, but not overwhelming. Pretty nice beer."
""
"Fuller medium body, nice carbonation, fairly creamy and sticky on the tongue. This is up there with some of my favorite red ales - I really enjoy the balance of heavy duty West coast hops and bready malt."
""
""
"This beer is simply the best high abv session beer with amazing flavor i've ever had (I know high abv session beer doesnt make sense, but I could drink 6 of these easily, be drunk, and fall asleep happily)"
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a Beer of the Month 6 pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep red color with a good 2 finger white head that dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves nice lacing. Smells of roasted malts and slight hint of hops. Tastes of sweetly hopped dark malted beer, with a slight hint of alcohol, very tasty. Beer goes down smooth for medium body, but definitely not a chugger. Overall, an exceptional beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect balance; flavors, mouthfeel and drinkability are all top notch here. Great stuff here. Would love to sample this next to Nugget Nectar and Red Rocket. Another world class brew I have tried from Lagunitas."

""
""

""
""
""

"Overall, this is another solid addition to the Lagunitas lineup and I find it to be well put together."
"O Very impressed by what Lagunitas is pumping out. This is a delicious beer and an outstanding value as well. If this exact beer had a Three Floyd's label on it, people would be going gaga over it. Pro's and con's to that. Good for me that it's low on the radar. Bad for Lagunitas for not getting the true respect they deserve. I'm sure they don't care about that anyhow. Cheers!"
"Typical well crafted beer from Lagunitas, and another absolute treat for hop heads."
""
""
"Somewhat creamy, nicely hopped amber, though nothing particularly exciting or new here."
"An inspired rejuvination of their first-ever brew, this bold American red ale from Lagunitias is a divine gift from the gods. Beer simply doesn't get much better than this. It is abusively strong in color, appearance, alcohol content, hops and attitude and will launch a full-on assault on your trembling senses. It is caramelly and spicey and smooth and tender and smacks of everything that is good about beer in general and life itself. It is obvious that the guys at Lagunitas hit a home run their first time up and we, the people, are blessed to be counted worthy to share in that first success."
""
"O: I expected more from this brew. I'm convinced Lagunitas has a similar base characteristic of boozy hops to all of their beers. It's not a bad thing, just a strange theme."
"O – This is hands down the best Imperial Red on the market, and Lagunitas should consider making this year round. Stone 13th (fresh) comes close, but not close enough. This red just trumps all others."
""
"This is a damn fine Red by a damn fine brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall a great beer. lagunitas continues to impress. i had heard wonderful things about this beer and it did not disappoint. different from nugget nectar, but just as enjoyable."
"O - Not overyly complex but quite tasty. Since so many have compared it to Nugget Nectar, I decided to have them side-by-side. The Lagunitas has the more dank hop bud fragrance. The Nugget Nectar taste is more orange citrus than the Lagunitas. They're significantly different but in the same family."
"O - I'm sick of seeing this beer compared to Nugget Nectar. They are not really all that much alike. Both are fantastic for the record...but if you want a hop forward posterboy for the style...a fresh Lagunitas Imperial Red is the way to go. Great Job Lagunitas. (If you're dying to know my comparison to NN, send me a BM...if it's really that important to you...)"
""
""
"O: This is a great beer -- very torn between a 4 and 4.5. I think there are some noticeable differences from NN. Imperial RED is a bit less refreshing, is a little bit more boozier, and is less juicy. But a super-solid beer in it's own right. Would probably still take NN over this, based on the flavor alone, but wouldn't spill a tear if this was all there was."

"O= Damn lagunitas does hops right and mix malt in just enough to bring together a unique profile. I had a friend tell me this was an imperial stout type of beer. No, not at all. This is a hoppy red through and through."
""
""
""
"Very tasty here. Many times in ""imperial red ales"" I'd decry it slanting so heavily towards the hop side of things but I found this delicious and worth it."
"Beer is medium in body and chewy on the palate, strong through with a nice finish. A little earthy with a good finish. I really enjoyed this beer. I've had 4 in as many days, I'll definitely have more of this. In general this brewery makes really nice beer."
""
""
"O-a really nice imperial red with good flavor and balance"
""
""
""
""
"Overall its definitely one of the better Amber ales I have had but nothing really sticks out to make me want to purchase it again."
""
"Overall, I do like the hop flavors present in this beer, and am glad that the grapefruit spritzer aromas didn’t translate into flavors. I do, however, question an Imperial Red that has so many hop flavors that the sugars are somewhat lost; I would have been happier with this beer tasting it blind, rather than knowing its supposed style. As it is, the beer comes across to this drinker as overly-hopped and therefore out of balance, and needed a stronger sugary backbone to better showcase the Imperial Red flavors. Still, it is worth trying, for the hops are rather nice; think of it as a strong IPA, and you’ll be fine."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, very nice.  I grabbed this beer without huge expectations, but it was a really pleasant surprise. Seems like I find myself saying that about lagunitas offerings a lot.  Maybe I should stop being so surprised.  Certainly one of the better imperial reds I've had, I think I may even like it more than nugget nectar. Definitely worth a try.  "
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is as good as nugget nectar, or better. In fact, I think I'd take this over nugget nectar if I was given a choice. I still would like the hop profile to be a tad stronger but this is still damn good."
""
""
"O/D-When has Lagunitas let me down... This is one of their better brews. I wouldn't put it in the Holiday Sucks/Sumpin Sumpin/New Dogtown class, but it is just a notch below. Those previously stated beers are some of the best you can get regardless. Just another great Lagunitas brew that falls just short of being superb."
"O: A very enjoyable beer I really love the big grapefruit taste."
""
"Definitely a good red ale that everyone should try."
""
""
"O-really one of my least favorite red ales i've had. in fact, i enjoy the non hoppy red ales more than this. it just tasted aged or something."
"A delicious beer. I wish more hoppy reds were like this."
"This is a stand out beer, really, really hoppy, but not so hoppy that it detracts from the style. There is a wonderful wonderful complexity here, lots to decipher with every sip. There is an underlying sweetness and a really nice deep bitterness that work really well together. All with an absurdly drinkableness that makes it hard to stop drinking it to write these notes. This is a great beer. CHEERS!"
""
""
"O: Excellent brew. I am most impressed with the clean, fresh, straight forward tastes. Put together well to really let all the flavors shine at different moments. Dangerously drinkable at its strength."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Overall I’d say this beer was a success within its style. Personally, I love red ales, and this is a strong red ale with great characteristics, and a nice sweet twist in its smell and opening."
""
"Pours a dark amber with a one-finger off-white head. Light lacing. Nice malt and hop aroma. Caramel bready malt notes go along with grapefruit, citrus and pine notes. Hints of alcohol as well. Flavor follows. Big hops and malt. Flavor beings with grapefruit and citrus notes, even a hint tropical, on the bitter side... before a sweet bread, caramel malt precedes a bittering pine finish with a touch of booze. A good, flavorful brew, if not completely cohesive."
"Medium bodied, mildly carbonated, and very easy to drink if you like big American ales. If you liked Stone's Arrogant Bastard ale, then this right up there. Just big west coast hops and just enough malt to go around."
""
"O- This is a great Imperial Red Ale with big hop character and some nice malt to accentuate the hops. Very drinkable for 7.8 ABV. I wish I had more than one bottle."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a red-orange amber. Nice fine two finger light tan head with great retention and massive lacing. Continual, entertaining carbonation. Aroma of piney and citrus hops and light bready malt. Flavor follows, a well blended pine hops, sweet and caramel malt, citrus. Excellent creamy medium to heavy body. Hops are somewhat restrained, but flavorful and fresh tasting. This is a marvelous well integrated and tasty red ale."
""
"the mouthfeel is silky and the burps are tasty, bringing out the graininess of the malts."
""
"O - Surprised by the hop presence, but I really enjoyed this one."
"A good beer, but I have to say I was hoping for a bit more. A couple of my ratings could have changed a bit, so I went with a 4.0 for the overall."
""
""
"O: Definitely hop-forward with a complementary malt backbone, just balanced enough to be uber drinkable. Not sure how old this bottle is at this point but I'd still drink some if I found more around here."
"O: Another great beer from Lagunitas, if you see it, get it."
"Decent little head on this one, thought it would fade away but it didn't, lacing is present but not a ton. Beautiful, beautiful clarity to this beer, but I think a redder hue could have been achieved. I can smell this one from across the room, which is just how I feel it should be with a beer like this. Piney hops, caramel sweetness, a little bit of bread and yeast, as well as plenty of spice on the aroma. Comes on pleasantly sweet before the hops assault your tongue, bitterness builds, things balance for a moment, sweetness shines through, and then bitterness returns for the finish, which could have been a touch more clean. Still, a total joyride in the flavor department. Mouthfeel is sticky, no surprise there, and this is a full figured beer, no lack of body, perhaps too much for some but I can dig it. Carbonation level is dead on. As a package, this is a knockout of an American brew. This is a great representation of what an outstanding brewery can do these days in the ""go big"" department. Not that it is an Imperial Stout kind of big, but the flavor is in that league. There is a time and a place to enjoy a subtle beer, just like there is for a loud bold one like this. Loved it, could have another. Three? Hard to say. This is a lot, and that is the joy of it."
""
"I'm not convinced this lives up to my unattainable, nostalgic recollections of this beer from my Pre-BA day, but I'm so glad this got another chance at life. Thank you, Lagunitas."
""
"Overall - not a bad brew at all. Very interesting to think about, and good-tasting."
""
"Overall - A nice representation of an imperial red ale by Lagunitas. Definitely a hop bomb for those who are a fan of intense hops flavour."
""
""
""
"A ruby amber with a large long lasting thick foamy off white head on the pour, with good lacing throughout. Aroma of lightly toasted caramel malt, piney earthy hops, grains, spicy rye and fruity esters fill the senses. Taste is toasted caramel malt, piney earthy hops, with a bit of spicy rye grains and fruity. Palate is a med to full body, with good carbonation and a nice crisp mouth feel. Finish is toasted caramel malt, some light yeast followed by some earthy piney hops for balance, ending long dry hopped finish with some lingering nutty earthy hops. Hops are not overpowering and some pleasant sweet fruity alcohol ester come thru. Overall a very good well balanced and tasty brew with a complex nose and taste."
""
""
"Pours a hazy red color with a finger of persistent head. The aroma is part typical Lagunitas tropical fruit hop bomb, and half rich, malty base. The taste is aggressively tropical-hoppy at first, but has a sweeter, maltier finish than an IPA would have. The mouthfeel is fairly heavy and well-carbonated. Overall, this is a solid hoppy red. It's not as good as the local favourite Tocobaga, but it's still a worthy drink."
"Moderate body on the low end, and medium carbonation help this beer's drinkability despite the ABV being on the higher end of ""safe."" I really really am enjoying this, but what else would I expect from Lagunitas, am I right?"
"O- Another fine offering from Lagunitas. There is much to enjoy here, especially the presentation of the hops. Rich and robust."
""
""
""
""
"O: 'nother good hopped up beer from Lagunitas."
"O - Basically pretty much a badass huge hoppy brew. You'll get your hops fix with this one. Lagunitas never fails to impress."
"O: Overall, this is one of the best if not the best Amber IPA I've had. I like Lagunitas, I like this beer, you will too if you enjoy super hopped amber ales, a no brainer!"
"What an exciting, rebellious beer."
""
""
"O: This beer is packed with a good balance of hoppy and malty flavors and also hides its alcohol very well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good beer and it was a pretty good and flavorful Imperial Red Ale, it had a pretty strong hop profile but there was just enough malts to impart some of those good Red Ale flavors. I thought this beer had pretty good drinkability, I always drink it quicker then I expect, it's smooth and has more then enough flavor to hold my interest, two or three of these would be nice on a warm day. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, all aspects of this beer were well done. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness in the flavor, the flavor was still good, but if the sweetness was toned down a little it would be a 4.5. I would buy this beer again, this six pack isn't lasting as long as I thought so I can see getting another one before they are all gone. I recommend giving this beer a try, I think it will appeal to Red Ale lovers and hop heads. No surprise here this is another good brew from Lagunitas, they never seem to disappoint me and that's why they are one of my favorite out of state brewerys, they make really good beers and this one is no exception, keep it up guys, I would like to see some other brews you got that haven't been made in a while."

"Pours a clear copper with one finger thick offwhite head, settling to a thin ring. Spots of lace left on the glass. Smell: tropical fruit and candied citrus, leafy, pine resin. Taste: pineapple, papaya, caramel, then into biting citrus finish. Medium bodied, creamy feel; sticky pineapple juice finish. Delicious at 7.8% abv, 54 ibus."
"O- A red ale?! Tastes like an IPA to me, and a one note one at that."
""
""
""
""
""
"As I buy up the dwindling stock that's getting harder to find, I hope that our dear friends at LBC will consider making this a staple"
"O: An above average amber ale. Definitely more hop forward than many others within the style, but very drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very impressive offering. I like a good strong amber and this one does not disappoint."
""
""
"Overall - I'm noticing a pattern on the basic flavor profiles of the newer Lagunitas releases, and this one is no different. Citrus hop forward, anchored by a sweet malt backbone. I don't know if this necessarily fits the style of an imperial red (and per my understanding, ""imperial red"" is not a style that's currently recognized), but it sure is damn tasty."
"Sort of has a dark fruit-jam caramel ligther Barleywine feel after a while. The overall balance is very nice."
""
"O. Lagunitas rarely disappoints and Imperial Red continues with that trend. This may be the best red ale I've had to date. Worth searching for."
""
"Overall- It's straightforward, but man is it tasty. Nothing too complex, but everything is well-balanced and I wouldn't mind having a few of them. Another great offering from Lagunitas."
""
""
"Pours a brown red with a finger of lighter caramel foam and some nice grainy lace. Smells of rich malts and some herbal hops - atypical for Lagunitas's style, but welcome nonetheless. I like it as a traditional red ale. Medium sweetness countered with bitterness and some herbal notes juxtaposed with a slight bitter orange peel flavor. A little more bitter than I'd like. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb and a dry finish. Decent beer, but nothing outstanding."
"O: Very solid red, up there with Nugget Nectar imo. Really like the hoppy reds that are on the shelves this spring. Will probably try and pick up a sixer before the end of the season."
"O- Another hop-forward and winning offering from Lagunitas. This one certainly blurs the line between an West Coast IPA and an Imperial Red and would consider this closer to the former (and hence my 4 out of 5 scoring)...but I'm not complaining and will purchase again!"
"Overall it's tasty, but I am not exactly floored by this or desiring it as much compared to other Ambers I've had."
"This beer goes down so wonderfully- a big malty body that carries ""imperial-level"" loads of hop character and bitterness. Less fruity than the aroma led me to believe, but, wow. Big smack in the face that nonetheless stays impeccably balanced. A lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste, love it or hate it. Not too sweet, but the maltiness makes it a filling one. Another bad boy from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very nice red ale. Well rounded and balanced."
"Pours a clear ruby red chestnut with a tight bubbled 1 inch head, just an absolute pretty looking beer. Brown sugar malts fill the nose, mixed with piny and grassy hops, so so juicy smelling. Juicy citrus hops swimming in a great sugary malt, dank resiny hops stick on the teeth and tongue as it ends on a bitter grapefruit finish. Medium on body, soft and smooth going down, bitter, sweet, rich, and delicious. Overall, this beer kills! Big hop presence with a big malt presence, both are mixed so well, just a good, good beer."
""
"Drink- I could drink this all night. Very high on my meter. Not quite a 5 but almost. Crisp, delicious and well done."
"O: An interesting beer. The smell is pretty insane, I enjoyed the taste, could be better though. Definitely something everyone should try and for the price its a great deal. Wont actively seek this beer out again but would love to be offered one again."
""
"Overall: a very good red ale, due mostly to liberal applications of hops. Lagunitas rarely goes wrong in my book, and this is another example of a tasty, hoppy, drinkable brew."
""
""
""
"O - I was very impressed with Lagunitas Imperial Red. It has strong hopped flavor that is really well balanced with the amber malts. Very pleasantly surprised and I highly recommend."
""
"Drinkability: Though the hops can be a little cutting at times its a rather likeable red ale, and quite quaffable. Perhaps now my favorite red because of the assertive hops."
""
""
""
"enjoyed this very much, probably more than OB gordon which i buy fairly regularly. i wish this style was better represented by more breweries."
"O: Lagunitas has another hop winner on their hands, as their Imperial Red is a well done and reasonably easy to find amber ale. Like I said, it's nowhere near the level of Nugget Nectar, but it's a solid pinch hitter for all my bruthas (and sistas) on the left coast."
""
""
"Drinkability – A good red ale; very easy to drink."
"I really like this beer. I got a six and enjoyed the other five before having the last and reviewing it. For the price I just do not see how you can pass it up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a lively tan head and a sprinkle of carbonation from the bottom. the aroma is rich and carmelly with a flowery hop aroma. The flavor is carmelly and rich, with a metallic bite, toast, and a piny hop character. There is a metallic bitterness and a creamy mouthfeel."
""
""
"Overall: This is a great beer. It's very hoppy and smooth. The alcohol content is 7.8%, which is a little high for my tastes - I guess that's what the ""Imperial"" in the name is for - but it doesn't dominate. I would love to try this on tap."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice big hoppy amber ale. Good malt and hop profile with some nice complexity."
"O: A good beer, overall, with a lot of great hop characteristics. It's a little undercarbonated, but still very tasty."
""
""
"Very smooth, with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Very nice if not quite giving Nugget Nectar a run for its money."
"O- This brewery is just solid. Pretty much everything they do is spot on with their flavor profiles leaning on the hoppy end, which I enjoy. Seek this out now as it is a limited release."
""
""
"O- Love love love this beer. Much like the 'Lagunitas sucks holiday ale' this goes above and beyond my usual expectations. I love the piney and citrus hops smell and flavor and it has just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness mixed in. The balance is exceptional."
"Overall Impression- I wish this one had more intensity and character... I did give it 4's across the board but for Lagunitas, I expected this one. Wish they would throw out a brew that didn't have the same strength and same blend... Have to say this was a bit above average for them."
""
"overall - wow, i'm pleasantly surprised, lots of hop profile, no alcohol flavors, citrus and fruity, just a great beer"
""
"Overall: Didn't expect such a hop forward brew, and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm calling this one a ""Red IPA"" with it's PNW characteristics and thought out malt backbone. Highly recommended."
""
"O- This is as good if not better than NN. It has a perfect blend of sweetness and citrusy/pine punch for the mouth and nose. Amazing creaminess while still feeling plenty carbonated."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (4.0): We have a winner! This is such a nice break from these IPAs that don’t give a second thought to the malt body. Believe me, I want boatloads of hops in my craw, too, I just wish more breweries would pay a little more attention to the malt body, the core of the beer. Lagunitas did, and it paid off very, very well."
"Overall - Jesus this beer is fantastic, i didn't get nugget nectar right away because of all the hype but honestly this stacks up with it JUST as good, i can't say one is better than the other but that says a lot about this one, its incredible and for the ABV and price WHOAAAA. i usually am not a red ale fan because they are more malty than anything but this is like a fantastic DIPA. incredible beer here."
""
"Overall - A very well crafted red ale here. It almost gives a bit of a ""western"" feel to a Nugget Nectar. Well done."
""
"What an amazing beer! Highly recommended!"
""
"One of my favorite styles. This one is good, but far from the best I've had. Very glad it came back, but would still prefer Sucks by a landslide."
""
""
"O: This is one of the best ambers you're apt to find. Very tasty and easy to drink."
""
"Single finger head with nice lacing on a amber with crimson and golden hues body. Very aromatic with lots of hops, citrus and pine. More than I expected. Flavor is more malty with a barley wine note, bitter hops with the sweet balance coming from a distinct caramel malt. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Overall very drinkable with a full and complex aroma. A must have a second time brew."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a reddish brown color with a smaller white head. The smells are of hops, caramel malts, and alcohol. The feel is medium and creamy from the carbonation. The taste is good, high hop bite up front, caramel, alcohol and some circus sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer. A little unfair to call it a red ale, since its basically a sweetish IPA. But they called it a red, so here we go-- a really good red ale."
""
""
""

"D - Very solid beer. It's hard to make imperial red ales that aren't overly sweet, and this one is particularly balanced. I'll be getting this one again. Lagunitas continues to impress."
"Solid red ale at a good price, I'll probably pick up a 6-pack sometime."
""
""
"Overall - This really tastes and acts alot more like a DIPA to me than an amber. There are no roasted malts here at all, there is some malt sweetness, but this beer is really all about the hops - absolutely a hop foward beer, with a nice balance of sweetness and loads of hop flavors. This really makes me think of Maximus and Southern Tiers 2XIPA, both of which I enjoy. If you enjoy hops, then this is a must try."
"D: pretty tasty red. certainly hoppy. but just enough malt to keep things in check. i could definitely drink a lot of these. especially at the moderate price."
"O - Another solid beer from Lagunitas and a worthy limited release."
"Lagunitas makes great craft beers. This release is a testament to their quality standards. Beautiful reddish hue with a nice hoppy aroma on the nose. The beer has a balanced taste and good mouthfeel. Perfect brew for a St. Patrick's Day celebration!"
""
""
"O: A great hoppy and bitter beer, certainly not for the faint of heart, hardly any alcohol taste for a 7.8% abv"
""

"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. It is definitely a member of the “Strong American Beer” category with bold flavors both from the hops and malt. The balance is pretty nice as well. I am not sure how much this is an imperial “Red” versus an “Amber”, but I am splitting hairs as to the style. I won’t have a problem at all drinking this six-pack, so I would count this one up as another “winner” for Lagunitas overall."
"Very good Red Ale. Up there with NN, Hop Head Red and the other top notch American Red Ales. Very well crafted and actually reminds me a bit more of BEar Republic Red Rocket and MAine Beer Co. Zoe. Very good brew."
""
"Overall: A very solid version of a hop forward red ale. Hops are fairly strong and well balanced by the malts."
""
"O: Big hoppy imperial red, just as you would expect. Hoppy enough to be an IPA but it's the big malt that keeps it in check and within the style."
"Highly recommended!"
""
""
"O- A good brew, worth trying. An easy drinker with some depth. Wish the Aroma was better/ matched the taste more."
"Pours an amber gold with a small off-white head and not much for lacing. Not much going on in the beading department either. Smell is reminiscent of a west coast barleywine - huge on hops, huge on malt, nicely balanced. Pleasantly surprised by this. Hops take a back seat to the malts on the tongue. Some obvious metallic malts, like a good brown ale. The hops definitely follow suit though with a big citrus after burn. I don’t typically drink many red ales because I don’t especially enjoy a malt dominated beer, but this is very well balanced."
""
"Overall this is my last of the six pack I bought about two weeks ago or so. I did not notice the metallic taste in the other bottles so I'm guessing my palate is out of whack or those two weeks in the fridge produced some off flavors. Or I'm just perceiving the bitterness differently this evening. Had a six pack of holiday leftovers and the last bottle had some white flaky crystallization in it that threw some gross off flavors over what was otherwise one of my favorite beers of the winter. Anyways, metallic qualities fade as it warms, hope lagunitas isnt having any QC problems because theyre awesome, all in all very good beer, end rambling."

""
"Good beer overall. Balanced nicely, with a lot of hops to boot. I would recommend to friends."
""
"YUM, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"O: I really enjoyed this one. A friend of mine had recommended it to me and I didn't think much of the concept until I tried it out. I've bought two six-packs so far and I'll be sure to pick up another before it's run is over. A refreshing change from the winter brews you've possibly been enjoying, as I have."
""
"Glad to see they brought this beer back! Pours a clear amber color with a large white head that goes down slowly. Scent has that lovely, unique Lagunitas touch to it with the ""in-you-face"" hops, slowly followed by some nice, bread-like malt flavors. Lots of citrus with some piney hop aroma. Taste is not far from what you would expect from a Lagunitas IPA...however, they call this an Imperial Red. I see how it does have more of a malt backbone than most of there IPAs, but at the same time, it is hoppier than a lot of breweries' IPA. Taste is citrus fruit with some hop resin and pine needles. Somewhat grassy, with a nice, fresh hop profile. Lovely caramel and bready malt flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and bitter. Drinkability is very high. Overall, one of the best reds available."
"This is a very nice looking beer and tasty too. I am most fond of it's velvety smoothness yet it has a very nice complexity while keeping it all about the hops. I will look out for it again next year for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a really nice and drinkable beer. My only complaint is the harsh lasting bitterness. Otherwise it's a fine and pretty drinkable beer."
"Picked up a single since I am wary of any ""red"" beer. This fits in with what Lagunitas does, plenty of hops, citrus instead of tea or metal. So I like it, but nothing really too special."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a very nice beer. Very flavorful with some very good hoppiness to it. Pretty easy drinking as well. Very solid beer all around."
"This is a fine beer if you're looking for something robust and hoppy. It's not as malty as the red title would lead you to believe. Overall, it's a little one dimensional with floral hops taking the forefront. A little balance would make this incredible. Being a hop head though I really enjoyed this offering."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Bitterness becomes a bit of a chore by the end of the glass. Too hop forward for my taste. Nice appearance and smell, but too much of a hop bomb with not enough malt to balance it in the end. Probably won't get again."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I had been hearing good things about this beer, and thankfully....they're true. A really nice Red without question. It's somewhere between Celebration and Nugget Nectar. Good Stuff."
"B-"

""

""
""
"O: A great red ale, glad Lagunitas brought this one back."
""
"poured into a standard pint glass. The intial smell is quite nice, very hoppy with some sweet fruit behind that. The taste is very surprising, much hoppier than I expected. There is a nice fruit background-tropical fruit tasting, mango maybe? Overall I am very impressed with this beer."
""
"O- Quite good. A bit more body would push this one up higher for me."
""
"Overall - Very tasty, this is a nice alternitive to brown sugga, maybe the little brother? Has a nice balance of hops and malts, and some sweetness thrown in to make it real pleasurable to drink. Another winner for sure."
"Pours a clear copper with a 1 inch foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, tropical fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is of tropical fruit, citrus zest, and herbal hops up front with a malt finish. A medium amount of bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."
"O: WOW!!! almost passed this up until my liquor store recommended this as he though it was what I would like.... AWESOME!!! Nice blend and balance but love the HOPS!!!!"
"Overall, this is a really, really good ale from Lagunitas. Definitely worth a try and is highly recommended."
"O: This is an exceptional ale. It's nicely complex, aromatic and full flavored. The components have exemplary balance. With these traits and a delicious taste, it is a very drinkable brew that's easy to recommend. With the heavy hop load, it also can be readily recommended (if fresh) as an IPA variant for hop heads."
""
"O --- this is an excellent beer. I will go back to it time and time again."
""
"O - I would hardly call this a 'strong ale' - instead I would go for imperial pale ale or something. No traditional strong ale characteristics, but quite good for what it is. I much prefer the Lagunitas offerings 'hairy eyeball' and 'undercover investigation' for the true strong ale types of beers."
"O - This is one of the best I had from Lagunitas, it is a limited batch so be sure to get it if you can. It is awesome!"
"Another decent, pleasantly hoppy ale from Lagunitas, as if I would or could expect it any other way. The (apparently old school) red ale base adds a little more dissonance, but that's ok, variety and the semblance of balance being the widely-available spice of life, and all that."
"O - This beer is dangerously drinkable and is almost an exact replica of Nugget Nectar. This beer would be Nugget Nectar if it had slightly less alcohol and more drinkability."
""
""
"O – A good IPA, not over the top as far as hops."
""
""
"O: A good beer. I don't like oniony hops but I am also probably hypersensitive to them. The balance of the beer was nice, but the mouthfeel wasn't what I expected for a strong, non-pale beer. On a side note this beer really reminded me of Sucks, just with more specialty malt and slightly less bitter."
""
"Imperial Red Ale is a bit crisp for an American Strong Ale--neither the flavor nor feel beg for it to be sipped--but, it's very tasty. Its an oddity--an American Stron Ale that goes as well with dinner as it goes after."
""
"An enjoyable beer, while still quite hoppy it is a nice change of pace from the standard hoppy offerings."
""
"O: a very good imperial, drinks incredibly smooth for such an alcohol content. It almost seems like an ipa combined with an irish red, delicious"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"- For me this is a more impressive beer than their IPA's.. but doesn't touch the browns and other rare special releases they have had, such as those named after Benny & the Jets, and others like Zappa. But it is a great drinker, and tastes quite good. The aromas though really fight for a space in your face. Worth the try."
""

"Overall, this is another hopped up, awesome Lagunitas brew that has a great flavor profile. Love it."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent orangey red with zero head. No lacing. Aromas of citrus and spicy hops. Sweet with some grapefruit as well. Taste is spicy, pine hops. Flavor of sweet malts. Hints of citrus near the end, namely grapefruit but some pine also. Bitter grapefruit finish. Lightly carbonated. A bit of a thin mouthfeel. Another hoppy Lagunitas offering but this one has a decent amount of malt and balance. Overall, nice hoppy red worth seeking out."
"O: I think an imperial red is a perfect description for this beer. The hops and malts are amped up to give a burst of flavor that doesn't come with other normal red/amber ales."
"O- Another solid beer by Lagunitas. Not sure how this is a strong ale, more of a ipa, but its good either way."
""
""
""
"Overall: One word describes this beer...BIG. It's like an American Red or Amber beer on steroids. More hops, more malts and more alcohol sweetness than a typical American Red or Amber, and that makes it pretty darn good in my opinion. Will buy this again as long as I can."
""

"o - a beer I've missed and was happy to see land again recently. Enjoyable, and would love to have in the fridge year round.."
""
""
"Overall: Another winner from Lagunitas, and a great example of the Strong Ale / Imperial Red subcategory. It is hard for me to pick a favorite brew from Lagunitas, as Olde Gnarleywine, Sucks, Little Sumpin' Sumpin', Undercover Investigation and Hairy Eyeball are all great. Now I can add this to that list as well."
"Like It? Quite"
"It's decent, but it's nowhere near Zoe or Nugget Nectar in terms of hoppy/imperial reds."
""
""
""
""
"But great overall."
"I don't get the category this is in. In my opinion this tastes like a world class IPA or DIPA."
"A great beer. Awesome hop profile that has so many great hoppy flavors!"
""
"O: A flavorful, easy drinking and well balanced ale. This is maybe the fourth of these that I had, and the first few were sort of ""ruined"" by the Sucks. This is similar to the Sucks but the sucks is fruitier and has less (or no) bitterness. That being said, it has grown on me."
""
"This is a nice, drinkable red ale. It's more hop forward, less boozy, and milder than I like my strong ales, so it seems like this may be a bit misclassified. Oh well, it's still a nice brew."
"O- Is there a Lagunitas beer that isn't fantastic? I have yet to find one."
"This is great stuff that I will buy any time."
"Poured into a Stella Artois 16 oz glass, bottled on 25th day of 12. Pours a clear bright red, with a 2 inch fluffy white head, lots of lacing. Smell is tangerine, carmel, pine, and grass. Taste is all of those things, with grapefruit in the finish. Body is medium, plenty of life, easy drinking, and lush not dry. This is a very nice hoppy red ale."
""
"O: Yowza. Always love this time of year, mostly because of this seasonal release. A nearly perfect marriage between a DIPA and a smooth, mellow, roasty red."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Somewhere between a Red and an IPA, its pretty drinkable and has big bold flavors, worth a try."
""
"O: A very very good beer. Hop lover will love this and amber lovers will be just as satisfied. Lagunitas does it again."
"I thought they had retired this one? I had this as a sample a long time ago, and was excited to actually try a 12oz bottle. Pours reddish-brown with a fluffy, off-white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aromas are among of the best I've smelled: Huge malt presence coupled with a huge floral hop aroma! Tastes are just as bold, with notes of grapefruit, caramel and toasted malt, hops provide a nice bitterness to the sweet malt backbone. Mouth-feel is well carbonated, creamy, and smooth. Overall, I'm glad they brought this one back! Hope they keep it around because I definitely want more!"
""
"O- I was surprised how much I liked this beer. I rarely enjoy a red and this beer brings enough hops that it made quite enjoyable. Another nice complex beer from Lagunitas that at the same time is very drinkable."
"O: I'm diggin it, Kind of like there IPA its super drinkable and non-demanding. It isn't often that I want a non-demanding beer but I think I'll come back to this one sometime."
""
""
"O: A good beer from a great brewery."
"O - Nice brew, interesting strong taste"
""
""

"Just bottled and kegged a new batch last week. The smell is really hoppy and taste has a hoppy back end flavor with malty front end. Has a ruby red color to it, with great clarity. Its not as malty as the last batch has more hoppy flavor to it. Not as many IBUs and ABV is a little lower but in my opinion has a much better taste and feel then the last batch."
""
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer. It's a red IPA. I personally would have liked the same hop presence with a little more malt sweetness to balance it out. Easy drinking for being a bigger beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a little better than average because of the good lacing and overall visual appearance. The taste and mouthfeel are so-so. This is a pretty good beer, but it's nothing to write home about."

"Enjoyable but not something I feel I will be missing if I don't grab it again. I am just intrigued by the Lagunitas ""something"" that is pervasive in their lineup that I have had so far"
"drinkable - yep - overall, a nice tasty beer - malty."
"D - A pretty good example of an American Red Ale, glad I got to try it."
"Definitely a good beer here."
"Great offering from Lagunitas. I hope to see it again in the future!"
"Altogether a great beer, and I'm glad I found some of this. This beer should be revitalized and brought back into production!"
"Pours a nice amber color with an off-white head that starts out at about two fingers and works its way down with some nice lacing. The nose brings a bit of malt as well as nice floral, citrus, and piney hops. Taste is a bit cut back with some lightly-sweet malt as well as some pine notes from the hops. A bit of sugar and bitterness in the feel. Pretty good, but not my favorite from them."
"Unbelievable Tasting beer, You can tell it's a Red Ale, but the flavors are all straight forward, so you can also tell it's an Imperial."
"It's got a really nice flavor and is nicely drinkable. It could be ever so much more drinkable though, if the hops were balanced out, just a touch more."
"Beautiful amber-reddisih tint, served on draft. Smell: pine, citrus. Fresh refreshing aroma. Taste: citrus, grapefruit-like hops, pine comes through also. Medium carbonation that goes perfectly with the taste. I tried a few beers at a Hamilton Tavern in Baltimore--this was by far the best one of the bunch. Would absolutely seek this out again. Another surefire bet from Laguintas."
"The aroma was quiet but overall a very good beer. I can tell the hops have died down a bit, but this was brewed with a great malt presence that it is holding up really well."
"D= amazing, possibly even a great ""starter beer for the uninitiated," should go great with most red-meat meals especially a juicy burger and fries."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - A satisfying, easy-drinking strong beer. I would prefer some more emphasis on the malt, but hop-heads will rejoice in this one."
"A pleasant sienna color with bright red highlights along the edges. It has a wonderfully earthy aroma, dare I say with a hint of heather? It certainly has a lightly bitter tea finish. It is well balanced and smooth but there is also a little bite that lingers long after you finish. Also, despite its higher ABV, alcohol notes do not come into play until the beer has warmed slightly to complete the well rounded flavor."
"D - Very drinkable, this beer has an excellent balance of malt richness and spicy, American hops. The pine and citrus hop character works well to augment the caramel malt. This is a very nice example of its style and it seems to bring out the best in Lagunitas talent for brewing hoppy copper-colored beers."
"D - And big drinkability. Despite the beer's girth. Heavyweight!"
"All in all a great brew...interesting idea, the Imperial Red. Kind of like a red and a barleywine put together. Nicely done."
"Drinkable for sure, but not as complex as the other Lagunitas offerings I have consumed."
"D: This is one powerful sucker of an American Strong Ale. Excellent; the alcohol is masked really well by the full-bodied flavor and unique, smoky hoppiness."
"The beer is not that carbonated for an Imperial Red at only 7% abv, but it is classified as an American Strong Ale. I would say for an ASA it's got a light mouthfeel, but for an Imperial Red more carbonation would lighten it up and make the flavors come to life a little more. One of the better Imperial Red's I have had, but lacking complexity for an ASA."
"This is s rich, well-crafted beer that doesn't lack character, as most Lagunitas brews are."
"It drinks really well and the 7.5% really makes it worthwhile. I too can drink these over and over but the limited availability for me in my area is tough. And a note, this is a premium beer at a price to match. Treat mode indeed, enjoy!"
"Good drinkability, it goes down very smoothly."
"D- OMG, prob my new fav. Am. strong, even better than the Bastard, availability is my only concern, i could drink this ALL day long.."
"Taste comes through, deliciously hoppy. Big malt backbone and a hint of sweetness. Slides from sweet to a denser heavier feeling on the palate. Drinkable, sure, can't really say what is better, this or the Lucky 13, the same, if not very similar style."
"Pours a ruby mahogonnay with a moderate off-white head. Little lacing. Nose is of hops and fruity, with subtle malt. Taste is similar. Citrusy, fruity taste with plentiful hops but a nice malt layer. Bitter, but not overly so. It makes for a quite nice taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation. Quite drinkable, although I'm not sure whether the Lenny's RIPA I had beforehand aided in that. Either way, I enjoyed this greatly...my favorite Imperial Red to date."
"This poured a clear dark mahogany, with moderate tan head. It smelled like juicy orange and grapefruit hops, with sweet honey and brown sugar and roasted barley, and a bit of copper hops. It tasted like copper and grapefruit and orange hops, with brown sugar and roasted barley malts. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a great scent and taste for a red ale. It had nice body too, and hid the alcohol very well, so it was definitely easy to drink. This seemed to use the same hops as Hop Stoopid, Little Sumpin Sumpin, etc. only with a more roasted red ale malt. The end result was delicious, up there with Stone's 13th Anniversary Ale."
"Bottle: Poured a bright amber color ale with a relatively small foamy head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of citrus hops is not bad but pretty standard compared to some other West Coats hop bomb. Taste is also dominated by loads of citrus and piney hops and a medium caramel malt backbone. Not the most interesting beer out there."
"Dark amber body, minimal (1/4"") white head, quick dissipation, but some decent lacing (?). Wondering if I got an oxidized bottle. Fruity hops in the nose, sweet malts, toffee. Spicy Hops up front on the tastebuds, nice malt backbone, sweet over bready, sticky brown sugar sweetness, with a decent bitter finish. Hops become more present as brew warms up. Good carbonated mouthfeel which surprised me after the minimal head. Significant alcohol heat in the finish inhibits drinkability. This is certainly a very tasty brew, but not one I'd drink more than one or two of."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with a little head that dissipates quickly, medium carbonation. A dark amber color all the way through. It has a scent that combines the sweet malts with the hops. Nice, even scent. The first taste give a strong hop bit. It burns off to a nice caramel taste with a sweet aftertaste. A very nice brew. This is definitely made to sip and is not a session beer. Feels like it has a bit of potency to it."
"D - This is very drinkable for a Fall/Winter offering. I will have a hard time sharing this 6-pack, but at 7.5%, will need to stretch it out over a few sessions."
"This is so drinkable and refreshing it could get you in trouble, beware."
"didn't know what to expect with this one I'm not experienced with Imperial Red's and I was stoked when I was confronted with a hop bomb, a good one at that. this beer is worth trying with out doubt and for 7.5% it drinks like water so watch out"
"D: Incredibly sweet with no depth of flavour. This one was a big letdown. Drain pour after a few sips."
"D: Imperial Red is another great example of a well-crafted brew from Lagunitas. Everything about this beer is top notch- from the beautiful color and foamy head to the wonderful hop aromas and perfect balance of bitter and sweet flavors."
"Verdict: A very typical Lagunitas-style beer, Imperial Red Ale is another satisfying and serviceable brew from the crew in Petaluma. I'm not sure if the Imperial Red style is going to take off, but this beer makes a decent case for the experimental style."
"The alcohol is there but by no means is it overpowering. Those expecting a west coast hop-bomb will not be disappointed here but this one has a twist to it. What it lacks in head and lacing is more than made up for in the depth of the taste. For the fall, I couldn't think of a better beer to have from the Golden State, with the exception of a Sierra Nevada or Anchor seasonal. It's stuff like this that makes me realize how much I miss the Golden State and what it has to offer. This has just the right mix of an IPA and a fall seasonal with a touch of lingering spice to tie them together. A great beer for autumn!"
"Very good strong beer. Warming after a glassfull."
"One of my favs from Lagunitas each year, I love the hoppy boldness and relatively good drinkibility of this for an Imperial Red Ale. One of the better six-pack buys out there as well, IMHO."
"This is an interesting and complex brew that I'm glad I tried. I enjoyed this beer with a pasta dish, and it held its own very well. Complemented the food and did not overpower, yet its character remained strong. If you like an ale with character, give this one a try."
"Medium bodied with enough carbonation. Overall agreat beer. A bit of a sipper, but light enough in body to make the pint go down fast. Another winner from these guys."
"The first time I had this beer I reported that it was more like a red colored Sierra Nevada Torpedo. I'm not really sure what I was thinking. The nose and taste of this dark red ale have some wood aromas/flavors, and the hop profile is lots and lots of pine. The hops flavor here is almost like a thick resiny hop syrup that coats the tongue. A fantastic beer that I could sit and have 2-3 of."
"D: This beer is perfect on a cool fall night. Very tasty and really sweet. Tastes like liquid candy."
"A decently tasty beer, but a boring one. For a good red of this style try Ithaca's cascazilla"
"Really a big beer. Gotta be in the mood for a sipper."
"D: Reasonable for the style. Certainly not a struggle to get down, but I don't think I'd want to have too many in a row."
"Medium to full in body, with an ample amount of carbonation that seems just right for this beer. Long lingering bitterness that just begs for another sip."
"Overall, very unique taste, albeit more subtle than it's sister brew and my favorite, the Maximus. Nice for slow sipping and savoring late at night when you can take your time. Try listening to cool jazz in the process."
"D: This is truly a great beer; not one you could drink all evening, but an awesome example of a style that's hard to put your finger on, and great for sipping."
"D- There's not a ton going on here and it really plays to this beers advantage. It does a few things and does them really well."
"Solid beer, I wish there would have been some more flavors, maybe some sweetness (i.e. Caramel)."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend. Really good flavor that goes down way too easy for a 7.2% ABV. Session worthy in taste for sure. Rotation: avail here. This will be a regular in the hops and session rotation."
"Had on cask at the Old Toad. Pours very rich looking out of the tap, very smooth. Frothy lacing on the sides, the head bows into the center because of the lack of carbonation. Deep amber red color, very hazy but appealing. Aroma is full of both caramel malt tones and citrus hops, both of which are strongly present in the beer, but not overwhelmingly assertive. The flavors blend well with the low carbonation and cask character of the beer. Alcohol is not present in the taste at all and it is drinkable like a mild ale."
"A nice amber red with 2 fingers of khaki head resulting from a rigorous pour. Smell is piney citrus hop aroma. Delicious. The flavor has a lot of malt, a lot more than the smell would imply. A good amount of hops to balance it out, less than in the nose. A slight hint of bitterness in the aftertaste, but all in all very clean. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is good. It's like an IPA but with less bitterness and more caramel malt. Delicious."
"drinkability: a solid beer as lagunitas always does. One of the most consistant breweries out there."
"mouthfeel: leaves an expected hop oilyness with no syrupy sweetness. nothing too overpowering."
"M&D- The feel is smooth although the flavor is big. I was not expecting this to go down as easy as it did. The hoppy sense of this fades with warming while the malts are kicked up and thus eventually winning the battle, making for a sweet/smooth ride. Medium bodied with near perfect carbonation, it was a bit high in the beginning. The drinkability is I want another right now because my glass is empty, Damn I should of picked more of this up."
"Reddish brown color with a nice cream-colored cap of foam. A good amount of lacing persists and creates a nice rim around the glass. A whiff of hops on the aroma that seems a little subdued but is definitely pleasant and inviting. The hops come through on the first sip with a nice bitter grapefruit body that's strengthened by a sturdy backbone of grains and roasted malt characters. Nicely balanced between malt and hop. Medium body with some weight provided by the maltiness paired with a nice lifting quality of the hops. A very drinkable brew. A good choice for some one who likes hops but isn't into DIPA's or any other super hoppy concoctions. A well-balanced hoppy affair."
"Another fine Lagunitas"
"Fantastic beer. Hoppy and malty and very well balanced. I love that the hops remind me of an imperial IPA, but the big malt character adds a caramel, big red soda flavor to it. I love big hoppy brews and beers that are nicely balanced. This is a hop bomb and a malt bomb and a very tasty one. Medium-heavy in the mouth with a silky syrupy feel. Very drinkable and a six-pack is a must. I could (and do) drink on this all night. A great go-to for any occasion."
"Overall: Have yet to be disappointed with lagunitas however considering I haven't had much in the strong ale department I'd say this would be a go-to in the category but in general its not my favorite."
"Drinkability: This is a nice hoppy beer. Very flavorful and I want more. Sits well too."
"D - I love hopped-up amber/red ales...the aroma of this beer really pulled me in and I was intrigued with the complexity of the taste and mouthfeel...a good beer from Lagunitas"
"pours a dark reddish copper with a one finger beige head that held well and settled to just covering the beer and a fair amount of spotty lace. strong aromas of hops, alcohol, pine, hints of caramel and roasted malt. its all about the hops lightly sweet up front with a bready malt then bang hops take over finishing with a bitter after taste. too hoppy for my taste."
"Hop flavor outweighs the bitterness on this beer, and I love it. Pineapple, green apples, pine needles and a bit of ganja all come to the hop party and are balanced somewhat by a sweet, crackery malt. While I cant say that I like this better than Lucky 13, this is still a damn fine beer. It's very refreshing and damn near chuggable. Excellent beer, cures my hop craving easily."
"Could really hang around and drink two or three of these, but beware of the higher abv. A really great take on a red ale. Not your typical boring red."
"D- Very smooth. Despite the hint of booziness on the nose, the alcohol is undetectable in the mouth. This goes down too easy for a 7.2% ABV beverage!"
"D - Extremely well-balanced beer, smooth despite the alcohol content. Very easy to drink"
"D: I wanted more malt from a red, not so much hops. It's a good compromise in general, but for the style, too hoppy."
"Medium/full bodied, smooth and drinkable in spite of a healthy alcohol content. Definitely for the hop lover, but balanced by a decent malt backbone."
"D-Given the 7.5 abv, I wouldn't qualify this as a sessionable beer, but it's a very nice sipper. I love this beer. Just DON'T drink it cold!!! Let it warm up a bit, and enjoy this wonderful sipper."
"D - Fairly good for the style. This is a solid beer."
"D: For it's ABV, the beer is dangerously sessionable. The guys at Lagunitas don't mess around. Imperial red is yet another great example of what these guys do."
"I love hoppy reds and this one is no exception, though I'd probably put it a notch below the best in the style. Nonetheless, it's very drinkable and a very good beer."
"I didn't know this was a strong ale when I bought it. The ABV on this can sneak up on you, so be careful."
"D-Pretty easy to drink but with the higher alcohol not quite sessionable. Very glad that we have access to this one I can forsee it being a very frequent visitor to my beer fridge."
"Mouth is slightly dry and really perfectly carbonated. Drinks all day long!"
"Alcohol is noticeable with the fruity maltiness and a grainy structure develops in the mouth, with a touch of pine softness. A bit sour, though on the mouth. Decent body and relatively well-balanced finish, with a mild carbonation that is not overwhelming."
"smooth mouthfeel,great drinkability. super nice."
"D: Although I love hoppy beers, this one really just doesn't do it for me. Glad to have tried it but can't really see myself drinking much of it."
"I know the hop heads may disagree, but I have had much better beers from Lagunitas."
"D: I think I could drink a million. Probably the thickest ""session"" beer I would endorse. Overall, very well balanced and fabtastic flavor!!!"
"D: Another rock solid brew from Lagunitas, I'm starting to notice a trend. This was an incredible Red Ale, very well balanced and much more flavorful than most others (though I'm surprised BA has it listed as a Strong Ale). This is one you should make it a point to find and try."
"Appearance is darker than I had expected, very dark brown. The head on it is small and with a couple sips, all that is left is a lilly pad on tap with ring around it. Smell has hops, a burnt flora aroma as well. Taste is rich, with a sweetness and a finish of dryness. Mouthfeel has a strong character, barley comes out, bitterness along with more of the dryness. Drinkability is about average, more due to the bitterness and dryness than the ABV."
"D: Daaamn, I'm glad I got a six-pack of this. Much better than the Mondo 13 Imperial Red. (EDIT: I actually bought about 7 six-packs of this in 2009. I just couldn't stop drinking it.)"
"Comes in balanced then averts to the hop flavor which into flows directly into a very sweet almost delicate piney taste that is better than expected. This beers texture and balance really sells me on it. The mouthfeel is good and the taste is exact enough to be comforting and just different enough to make me understand just what Lagunitas has to offer is better then the rest. Pretty good."
"This beer is an awesome treat, review reads slightly skewed vs T,M,D all getting 4's, That is solely based on Mad River's Double Dread, which for me is a defining Imperial red, Lagunitas has brewed another treasure and is an absolute must!"
"Hops most assertive in front finish and as part of a very complex hoppy, coffee finish. I like this one a lot."
"Definitely a beer to sit back and enjoy as its pretty hefty and has a lot of flavor. Another nice release form Lagunitas...how many strong, hoppy beers will you guys brew? I say, there will never be enough so keep 'em coming!"
"Drinks too easy, I could stay on this for 3 or 4 bottles, no problem"
"D: Easy drinker, but a bit too strong to be a session, in both the hops and booze department. Really a nice tasting beer, hits the notes that it needs to without being overpowering. Leans more towards the hop side, but is nice. I think this is the beer that Stone's 13th Anniversary wanted to be."
"D: You can definitely feel the ABV in this one, not that it's off the charts, but the rich tapestry of flavors and strong ale elements would lead me to only a couple of these. By no means a session red ale, this Lagunitas offering is interesting and tasty. Definitely worth a try on, especially of you love big strong ales like Arrogant Bastard or Long Trail Double Bag."
"Easily the best imperial red I've had for the money, and a new favorite from Lagunitas. It'll be a shame to see this seasonal fall off the shelves."
"cheers!!!"
"Very creamy and full and a nice level of carbonation make for a very nice mouthfeel. This is great beer and I'm glad I went ahead and bought a whole case as I've already been through about half of it."
"D: really have to enjoy hop driven beer to drink more than one"
"The consistency is thick and creamy with a full palate of flavors. There is a nice earthy and toasted malt flavor, lots of chicory bark and smokey flavors. There is a nice hop bitterness, a bit leafy, drying, but well balanced and complementary to the malty base of the beer. the hop has a bit of a minty and piney cast to it, but overall it is drying and leafy and nicely bittering. There is a roasted, slightly charred, drying, and smokey flavor that lingers into the aftertaste and beyond. The beer is fairly complex, thick, creamy and a nice find. The ABV is well hidden and there is no booziness in the beer at all. Very worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Pretty darn drinkable. So unique that I think this would taste great on a hot summer day, the dead of winter or anywhere in between."
"This beer poured a deep brown with red highlights and a single-finger head. The smell is a mix of different hops including some piney and citrusy notes with a solid malt backbone. The taste starts off with some sweet malt that gives way to a bit of piney hops followed by some grapefruit bitterness. The mouthfeel is moderately thick with a decent amount of carbonation. This is one of those beers that incredibly hoppy but balanced well enough to be completely drinkable. Another good offering from Lagunitas."
"Notes: It is full of character and yet I think that outsiders could give it a successful try if they are a bit open minded. It is not quite an IPA although it is like a deviant malty cousin to love. Reminds me of their Lucky 13 but it has been a while since I had that and may need to have it again to compare :-) Bottle says ""Limited Release", I sure hope it is limited to the next couple of decades or so."
"Smooth and creamy. Very enjoyable. I'm not sure if I would want to do more than a couple of these at once, but it does go down quite easy."
"A solid Imperial IPA. Great hops aroma; classic CA sharp citrus hops and red malts. I tend to think of IPAs as falling into one of two categories: 1) crisp (more citrusy IPAs, floral, resinous and clean) and 2) musty IPAs, big aggressive hops [i.e. Warrior] can impart a vegetal, grassy, garlicky earthiness that tends to be a little more interesting than the crispy IPAs, but not as drinkable). This beer is definitely the first category. Taste is aggressively hopped (in a good way); sharper and more pronounced flower and pine characters than I would normally expect from a ""red ale."" There's the fruitiness (I detect lime, which is a little different) and the floral characters, and then the beer finishes with a lingering bitterness that tapers into a numbing spice. Mouthfeel is full and rich, slightly thicker/more viscous than your average IPA, finishes velvlety and smooth."
"The IBUs are enough to beat many a good IPA."
"Another well done, quality beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"Drink is great for 7.2% ABV. Even for being a bit on the heavier side this would make a great session beer. Those big malts with well balanced hoppines just makes this awesome."
"D: I mean, this is a fairly strong beer on a number of levels. Sitting on 7.2% ABV, plus about 3lbs of hops in each bottle, I don't think I could have more than 2 before starting to not enjoy them. And I'd like to enjoy them, because the taste really is quite good."
"Another great beer from Lagunitas that is both hoppy and well priced. Would gladly have this again, but by the time I get around to it they will have another seasonal in the beer aisle."
"The mouthfeel is pretty thick, which suits the beer quite well, and makes it damn drinkable for it's abv."
"This beer seems to me like an Imperial Irish Red Ale, or maybe a toned down Barleywine. The herbal aromas remind me of the Irish Red Ale, and the deep ruby-like hue and sharp hops remind me of the Barleywine."
"Out of a bottle I found with my stunning Russian companion this beer was a copper/red color with one finger of beige head. The retention of the head was good and it left lacing in thin bands. The aroma was big: citrusy hops, pineapple in particular, roasted malt, sweet malt and alcohol. The flavors were also big and full of lemon and citrusy hops. The pineapple was notable in the profile and I really enjoyed it. I also tasted some in-your-face alcohol, sweet malts, dark caramel, toffee and hints of wood in the roasted malt. The body was full, the mouthfeel good and the carbonation a bit frothy. Well balanced for such a big beer in its both strong hops and malt elements as on would hope from an 'American Strong Ale.' Definitely worth a try."
"Clear ruby red with a copious head of tan foam. Good lacing. Nose is malty and citrusy - hints of mandarin oranges and caramel. Sweet malty body with some caramel and toastiness. Citrus, apple and light tropical fruit. Finish is nicely hoppy with a lingering toasted edge. Smooth body and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable and tasty."
"It is becoming harder and harder to find a Lagunitas beer that isn't great. Another classic, this beer is one of the best Double Red Ales available. Although not the most complex beer, this one remains enjoyable throughout. Excellent."
"I am very perplexed as to why my experience with this beer was radically different from other reviewers. I had other Lagunitas Brewery beers and have enjoyed them, not sure what happened with this one."
"The sweetness becomes more apparent as this warms, if it was just a little better balanced this would be a great one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture is absolutely sublime and couldn't be improved in my opinion. It begins soft and slick, then garners up some foam and disperses it across the tongue with total elegance. This is heavy handed and will make its presence felt, and it will certainly please fans of stronger ales from our West Coast."
"2/28/12 EDIT: This beer has changed dramatically since I first reviewed it back in 2009... much more of an American Amber Ale now... far, FAR from an American Strong Ale. Sharp, and almost astringently hoppy now. No sweet raisin or fruitcake qualities now. But easier on the drinkability scale."
"D: Not too heavy, and doesn't reek of alcohol like some in this ABV range. I may look for this again: a good sipping ale. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"HV"
"Lagunitas makes only good beers as far as I'm concerned. Actually, they make many great beers too. In fact, I'd say I'm wowed by their beers about as often as a coin lands on heads. I'd consider this particular offering only good although another day, another time, another sample and who knows, it may very well be great. I plan to look again into it."
"pours copper red with a 2 finger head that left good lacing. smell is piney with strong sweet malts. taste is candy carmel malts and pine hops. a medium body with good carbonation. glad i tried this one but overall this is just too damn sweet for me."
"Pours a pretty honey red color with a small yet dense khaki colored head. The aroma is strong with a doughy honey malt, quite sweet, perhaps some light grassy hops. The doughy malt is also dominate in the taste, some honey and a bit sugary. Some dull hop bitterness in the end struggles to balance out the sweetness. Quite a chewy feel, probably a bit heavier than it needs to be. Fairly soft carbonaton, probably could use a bit more; finishes bitter. A bit disappointed in this brew. I was expecting more of a fresh hop flavor. The heavy malt sweetness dominates the brew. Much better ""Big Reds"" out there."
"D- Easy drinking for a beer that is 7.2. Not too bold, drinks like an IPA."
"Overall: Good drinkability, really sweet flavors but balanced with a nice hop bitterness. The sweetness gets stronger as it warms and the bitterness becomes less."
"d: once it warmed a bit, this was a pretty enjoyable brew, just nothing memorable"
"D - Very enjoyable on a brisk cool or cold day. This beer has some body and boldness if you are looking for something that will stay with you. If you just want to sip and savor a tasty beer..., this is the one."
"I new fav, I want to drink this all day everyday."
"Feb 2012 update -- I think the hopping, especially the dry-hopping, is more intense and pungent now than even two years ago. This taste lesss like Lucky 13 and more like Lagunitas Sucks to me. Bumped up flavor accordingly."
"Served: in a faceted mug."
"Overall: Mouthfeel was well carbonated and lighter in body than I expected. Not extremely drinkable to me, the alcohol is a bit stronger than I prefer."
"Notes: A great representation of the style."
"a bit raw, a bit hoppy, a bit intense and a bit unrefined.... all excellent things in the case of this brew. Stunningly drinkable, rich, full, thick, flavorful, powerful, and all-around delicious."
"Drinkability: The beer that most closely compares with this one is Arrogant Bastard, which is high praise indeed. It's a bit sweeter and less intense than AB, and I don't think it really stands out in the same way as Stone's signature brew, but this is quite a nice strong ale."
"Pours a seethru murky brown with reddish tints and a small tan head that has decent carbonation and a minor lace ring. A springy hop presence is very noticeable and expected since this is a red ale, but also a large, chewey bread malt presence is picked up just in the nose along with some caramel and some other sweetness like maple syrup and/or butterscotch. Those malts are more evident in the taste as this beer is medium-to-full bodied with a great balance of both citric/floral hops that lead to a dry, mildly bitter hop finish. But the beer also contains a slightly syrupy/sticky malt taste full of sweetness like caramel, maple, maybe some gum or something slightly sugary. Overall it is a smooth, creamy beer that passes easily and even has a warming sensation on the pallete albeit I'd say the ABV is mostly hidden (never would've guess over 7%). This is a great ale for anyone to try."
"D: Great for a hop head."
"A success as an amped up red ale. Drinkable for the ABV and showcases nice cascade / centennial flavors without whacking you over the head with bitterness. Legendary on tap, too bad that's not what I'm reviewing... good in the bottle, though."
"Nicely balanced and smooth"
"Well, I took a whiff, which didn't hint at much, then a sip, and immediately noticed the up-front hops and a dryness that doesn't usually come with such a style. The malt flavor was there, but actually appreciated as a balance to the hops. Neither flavor sensation was dominant. The first glass went down really smooth, and even after the Lagunitas rep was gone I ordered a second one on my dime. And that's a compliment to a red I ever ever gave one."
"Malty and bitter. Dominate hops. A very very tasty immperial red."
"D - I could drink this all night."
"Simply a fantastic beer.. I was finally able to find a place that sells it (Manchester Wine and Liquors) and I'm glad I did. Reminds me a lot of Ithaca's Cascazilla.. a super hoppy but well balanced red ale. Pours a reddish-copper color with a nice bone white head. Not much for lacing, smell is of caramel/candy and hops. Taste is just awesome for me.. maltiness upfront with a nice bitterness after, so damn smooth. Almost too drinkable.. I will be buying this beer frequently from here on out."
"D - Great drinkability here, glad it comes in the six pack."
"Despite it's somewhat higher ABV I think this would make a nice session beer. Nothing ground breaking about this brew, but everything falls together well and makes this a pretty easy drinker."
"Overall this is another Lagunitas beer that impressed me. Keep up the good work in Petaluma."
"Thanks to Kegatron for providing me with this bottle."
"Real big off-white head of mostly big bubbles, not much lacing but takes its sweet time dissolving down to the surface. Solid amber red color, fully unblemished and transparent, sits tranquilly under all that foam. The nose has an unassuming power to it, you don't notice how full your nostrils are until they're saturated with pine resin, lemon citrus, carob, dried honey, croissant flakes and peach alongside cherry and red apple fruit scents, just enjoyable to sniff without bothering to wonder why. Medium-bodied, same perfect balance between malts and hops as found in the nose. More fruity here with cherry, apricot, peach and sweet apple flavors. More honey and pink grapefruit, lemon citrus too yet never gets ""sweet"" per se. The grain aspect tempers the herbaceous qualities so it's not arch nor bitter either. The pine aspects subtle. The carbonation wisely remains in the shadows and allows the flavors to stand or fall on their own. Richness continues through the finish, has soaked all your mouth pores so it doesn't need fireworks to make you take notice."
"Because of the big flavor the drinkability is a bit lower than taste, and the abv gives nice heat otherwise well hidden. One of my favorite domestics."
"First beer of Super Bowl Sunday and first Lagunitas that I've tried. Poured a crimson copper color with an off white head. Left some lacing as consumed. Smelled hops and more hops with definite sweet malt aroma. Tasted nice bitter hops with a nice amount of malt sweetness. Was nicely carbonated and medium bodied. Very nice beer that I would love to sit down with for the evening. ABV might be too much for me for more than three or four however. Nice beer."
"In summary, this is one tasty across-the-board brew."
"Overall a very tasty and full bodied ale."
"As one would expect even though the bottled variety I have had in the past was pretty darn good, on tap it was truly spectacular."
"One of the best beers I have ever had. A lot of flavour + complexity like everything else I've had from Lagunitas (except their Pils - for that one should stick to Pilsner Urquell) .. back to this one. Highly recommended, but tough to find outside California, please enjoy responsibly."
"A: The color of a dirty copper, sticky and resiny spots of foam, transparent - 3.75, D: Interesting mix of aromas, some pineapple and pine needles, possible pomegranate, some sugar-free bubble gum smells as well - 4.25, T: Mellow pine bite, caramel malts, touch of molasses possibly, wonderful hop bite - 4.50, M: 4.00, D: One of the more highly hopped red ales I've had which adds a nice dimension to a normally malty style, I'd gladly have another - 4.00"
"Very good brew. I like these 'imperial reds' just as much if not more than IPAs in many cases because they're often better balanced while also being very hoppy. How have I never had this before? I suck. This beer, however, does not."
"Overall: A very drinkable beer, I picked it up in a mix six and now wish I had more. This is a great beer that I will be looking for next time I am out to buy beer."
"Finally, this beer reminded me more of an Old Ale than some of the other beers of this style. That's not a criticism, by any means. especially on a snowy January evening! Enjoy this one."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0812-Corey"
"RAMBLING ON: I've said it before and I'll say it again. Lagunitas is arguably one of the most imaginative (actually, I called them ""nut jobs"") brewers out there and trust me, they're ""out there""...just check out their beer list...Long Live Lagunitas...Did I tell you that I love this beer?"
"Ok so this is a difficult style to rate for me. Appearance is great with a medium amber color and a great deal of head and lacing. Smell is a bit weak, but a decent amount of hops. Taste is some sweet malt with a healty portion of floral hops. Mouth feel is pretty good, a medium in body and a lot of carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic."
"(D) Delicious. This could easily be an everyday beer."
"I like being able to control my own pour and serving temp."
"Drinkability is good, but I don't think I'd want to drink more than one at a time. A solid ale, but there's a specific sweet element in it that I'm not sure if I like, but which I can't put my finger on. My dad loves this beer though. This beer stands out to me as ""different."" Definitely worth a try."
"Body is perfect for the style, rich and semi-thick with restrained carbonation. Obviously, a strong ale will always have somewhat limited drinkability and the sweetness doesn't help the cause but at ""only"" 7.2% ABV this is pretty manageable."
"My this is good. Drinks so well. What an enjoyable experience. Flavors vary throughout the drink, yet never sways from the basic foundation. An exceptional beer. One of the best I've had and well work the price of admission."
"Notes: It was a pleasure to have and next time I will have a few more.This had a nice ABV and still felt easy to drink."
"D: This is a sessionable ale that I very much enjoyed."
"Lagunitas has one kick ass beer here. This might be my favorite Lagunitas beer. Yes, it really is that good. It's chock full of flavor, very hoppy, and a pure joy to drink. Sounds like a recipe for greatness. If this one's not there, it's as damn close it can be. Highly recommended."
"Medium bodied and moderately drinkable"
"Could be a session beer in the right mind frame. ABV blends well in this strong ale. Recommended to all the IPA lovers around the world as a different means to the end."
"I love this beer. Pours a dark clean copper with a small quickly fading head. Aroma is of piney hops, malts and citrus. The malts come out a little more in the flavor and the hops are not far behind. Bitter, dry and resiny. I do not see this very often so when I get the chance I always ick up a couple of 6's of it."
"Poured into a straight pint glass. A beautiful deep red ,yet clear. Strong but pleasant aroma. Very strong flavor, with a clear hop bite. The body is a little thin, could use some more backbone. Very drinkable, on the strong side for a session, but having a few in a row is certainly possible. If you're in the mood for a hoppy strong ale, hit this if available. I like this beer more than my review might indicate. You should try this when you can, I will certainly include this into my go-to list."
"Drinkability: Definitely a unique brew. While i think I could down several (and may be tempted to try), it seems that the pungent taste and fairly large body would slow me down. Worth a try for sure."
"Stubby 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Copper-amber color with a thick tan head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is mainly citrus hops, with a very tangy character, and caramel malt. Flavor is the same. Sweet and substantial malt base, orangey grapefruity hops, and a slight metallic note. Piney bitterness takes the edge off the sappy sweetness. Finish is a little dirty/sticky, body is a couple shades over medium."
"D: a very nice beer, but the 7.2% ABV lower the drinkability for me a little bit."
"Wow, this is a beast of a beer! Ruby red body with a small tan head. Large hop aroma - citrus and pine, but paired up with some caramel malts. For the life of me this smells like an IPA, and the taste delivers on that assumption too. Lots of grapefruit and pine play off against a nice malty caramel background. 84 IBUs is obvious, but very pleasing. Medium body and carbonation. This is an absolute stunner and I'll be hunting it down again. Thanks Shawn for sharing!"
"A thick, heavy, barleywine-type strong ale. Mahogany pour with a negligible head. Kind of a ring of oily bubbles. Heavy leather, bread, and malt in the aroma. Typical Lagunitas sticky, sugary-sweet taste up front. More hops than their Hairy Eyeball offering, but very similar. Solid malt core."
"Yum, yum..."
"I'm very suprised that this brew is that strong. Even though you taste the alcohol bite a little, it's still very easy to drink."
"Overall, I grow weary of this style. Stone has it tied up, it's going to take more creativity to do better."
"I will definetly order this when I see it on tap, another great lagunitas beer."
"Great job Lagunitas!!!"
"Easy to drink for an Imperial and 7.2% abv."
"Overall a very good red although I don't know that I would classify it as an imperial. Still another solid beer from Lagunitas."
"2 12z bottles into a Duvel snifter. Pours a murky but crisp dark ruby red with a thin off-white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves decent lacing. Aroma is crisp caramel malts and pine hops. The taste is a nice balance of sweet caramel malts and lingering bitter pine hops, very well balanced in the initial with the IBUs showing through in the finish. The beer is medium bodied with slight carbonation. This is a very enjoyable beer, one I look forward to having again."
"D: I could see myself drinking enough of these to regret it the next day. I'll be keeping this one in steady supply."
"This beer pours a shimmering bright red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes very, very slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine, with a firm bedrock of caramel malt. The aroma is a bit maltier than the aroma, but there are still tons of hops. There is a strong caramel presence, with grapefruit, and pine in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a velvety texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is one fine beer. I have always been a fan of Imperial Amber/Red ales. I live them even more than DIPAs, and this is one that I will certainly drink again, and often.."
"D - I want to drink this all day long"
"In the end, overall a great beer. Will have again."
"Pours an amber red color with an off-white head that fades quickly leaving some nice lacing. Nice hoppy aroma with maybe a bit of rye? Delicious hop-bomb flavor. Piney, grapfruit rind, citrus rind, some orange. Veyr sturdy malt backbone on this one consisting of caramel and biscuit malt. This is more of a DIPA than ASA. Very good beer and will be drinking more of these int he future now that they're available in MN."
"D: Hides the abv well for an imperial red ale. Remains surprisingly refreshing even with the higher alcohol."
"Really delicious beer here"
"6 pack/$10/De Vinos"
"Drinkabilty is better than average but at 7.2% not for long. This brew was very close to a barleywine on my palate. Keep in mind I had this at 6:00 am following a 12 hour night shift. Viva Lagunitas!"
"Pours a dark amber with a decent beige head. The nose has piney and citric hops over soem caramel malts. The taste is nice and malty yet well balanced by the bitter hops. Smooth medium body drinks well. Another nice beer from Lagunitas. I am never let down by these guys."
"Over and Out..."
"Mouthfeel is just on the right side of too thick. Overall, I'm delighted to report that I still love this beer, and less delighted to report I only bought two bombers."
"Solid effort. A little on the sweet side, but I would be glad to drink a few of these."
"D- I don't know that I'd call this an American Strong ale. I think it's more of an IPA. I encourage Surly Furious to give this one a shot. I'm pretty sure it's got a similar hop bill. Will probably drink again."
"Drinkability is hindered by alcohol content, but this is one delicious beer that leaves you screaming for another despite it. Distinct in character compared with my most recent Imperial Red, Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster, but brilliant in its own right and massively delicious."
" Overall this is a 2 beer session for me."
"D: This is a wonderfully drinkable red ale, I'm really digging this"
"Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale pours a reddish copper color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is citrusy hops and it's very enjoyable. Piney and citrusy hop flavors abound. There is plenty of caramel malt flavor as well to balance things out. I like the smell better than the taste, I was hoping it would taste more like it smelled, but this is a pretty good beer."
"D - This screams for Hungarian stews or even some game - or nothing at all. Would probably work with a cigar, but why risk it? Beautiful stuff."
"Pretty drinkable. Normally I find that I don't like Lagunitas offerings, but this is a good one."
"Overall I just feel this was a ""good"" beer, as reflected in my ratings. It's got a nice fresh hoppiness to it with a good toasted background. Pretty much what you would expect overall. I still think Winter Yulesmith is a better beer in this category but this is a formidable beer."
"Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale is just what the name implies. A big, hoppy strong red ale. Nice deep red colour with a big head. Decent retention and lacing. This beer has a very piney aroma that is accompanied by a sweet caramel malt character. Flavour is big on the piney hops, with a juicy, sweet caramel malt profile. There is a slightly roasted character as well. Bitterness is very smooth. Has a nice full mouthfeel and a carbonation on the low side of medium. This is a nice beer. The flavour were very vibrant and harmonious. I will defently buy this again."
"Drinkability: A strong brew, but very drinkable. I could probably drink several of these, as this is beer goes down very easily. Of course, then the high ABV would hit me :D"
"D - For the price I probably wouldn't buy this again. A good beer, but nothing new or all that exciting. Worth a try."
"I should have known to expect this from Lagunitas, but this thing was much hoppier than I was anticipating. It poured up a clean, medium dark red colour with a fairly large two and half finger slightly off-white head. Thick, glue-like froth heavily coated the sides of my glass. Smell, to me, is grapefruit rind oil and not much else. If you're in the mood for hops, but don't really want to go the route of your standard American IPA, this'll fix ya' right up. Taste, too, seemed to be very assertive hops with little else to accompany it. This is good beer, for sure, but alas, yet *another* over-the-top hop bomb. Still glad I was able to try it."
" The beer had a deep amber color with a minimal head that was frothy to the mouth. The beginning of the beer was sweet and ale-typical with a smooth hoppy finish. I gave the beer an overall A and not an A+ because the beer has to take me to stellar level and this beer did not, it's just a good beer."
"A solid offering and a red ale on 'roids. Quite flavorful and enjoyable to drink as the temps start to ger nippy in Central Ohio."
"D: Despite its flaws, which are few, this beer is wonderfully drinkable, good mouthfeel, good taste and drinks like a SNPA or something similar, even though it is much larger. Just a good, solid, all around beer."
"I think I'm heading to the fridge to get another..."
"This is a delicious beer but its too syrupy and a bit too full bodied for me."
"Another terrific beer from Lagunitas."
"Another fine, nicely priced brew from Lagunitas. Keep up the good work."
"D- This is quite and outstanding beer. It compares very favorably with the Great Lakes Nosferatu which is once of my favorite. I would definitely buy this again."
"mouthfeel is of hop resins hanging around, super bitter, heavy, but still easy to drink, yum!!!"
"Well done."
"Vinous and silky, the drink is lightly-carbonated and fullish in body. Good drinkability."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Aggressively hoppy, there's a touch of toffee malt flavor here but it's drier than the nose suggests. Earthy, resiny, piney hop flavor is dominant. This beer is similar to Arrogant Bastard in many ways, though this isn't quite as satisfying as that beer. The finish is long, dry and bitter. This is ideal stuff for quaffing during the Autumn months."
"D- This is very similar to the 13 and in most wasy, its equal. This is something that I would like to see Lagunitas keep in regular rotation."
"D'ability - For a big, hoppy beer it is very drinkable. Really more of a big American IPA than a Strong Ale. A good beer at a reasonable price (think was $8.99/6 pack)."
"Between this and the Capp. Stout, Lagunitas kicks butt!"
"Really tasty stuff here. One of my favorites from Lagunitas."

"D: Very good drink with a sweet maltiness and hoppy stickiness."
"A pretty good choice here, this might even be my first taste of this exact style, not sure. Could drink it all day, but probably shouldn't."
"Drinkability: A surprisingly good beer from Lagunitas, and one I'm glad I picked up. The alcohol's manageable and well-hidden, it's pleasantly balanced, and decently complex with plenty of great malt and hop notes. Recommended trying at least once."
"D- big and bold, this beer makes itself known. well worth checking out. the 12oz size makes it easy to have a couple of these without wanting a change, but at just over 8% abv too many would be a problem. the alcohol is well hidden among the massive amounts of hops. ill check this one out again."
"D- The well-masked 7.2% ABV puts this just past being sessionable, but I could see myself easily enjoying several of these in a row regardless of the moderate alcohol content."
"M + D: Big, a bit chewy, and oily. A slippery residue left behind briefly. A decent brew, full of hops flavours... something I'd happily do again. The last half ended up going well with a burger smothered in hot sauce."
"Right then, let me just start this here review by saying this is one of my favorite Laggy beers and as such, yes, I am going to be personally biased. Too freakin' bad, eh? This stuff is delicious. West Coast delicious. We gots the malt, we gots the hops, and we gots the hops s'more. This stuff combines potent ABV, potent flavors and you-will-be-doing-stupid-stuff-later drinkability. My kind of elixer. I wouldn't normally plagerize for a review, but the stuff that Lagunitas wrote on their bottle is too good to be missed. Here is the description verbatum:""This special ale is, in reality, a reconstructed exhumation of the very first ale that we ever brewed way, way, back in 1993. Brewed with a big head, a muscular malty thorax, a silky texture & all strung together with a hoppy sweet nerve sack...yum."" Pretty cool. I realize this isn't the most beer geeked rendition of my experiences with this ale, but I do think it fits nicely with the whole uber-chill feel of the Lagunitas line of fine, fine ales and lagers."
"3.5/4/4/4/4"
"12oz bottle purchased at Pizza Port Bottle Shop in Carlsbad, CA on Friday, September 19, 2008. Consumed on Tuesday, September 23, 2008."
"The mouthfeel is great for me. I could certainly understand a lower rating here because you might have difficulty tasting the subtlety of other beers after this one, but I just enjoy it. There's enough carbonation to move the taste over your tongue without shocking your mouth further than the hops already do. I have similar feelings on the drinkability. It's a great beer that I enjoyed immensely."
"D - Very nice beer...this isn't a Killians for sure."
"Alcohol is very present, and taste doesn't do too much for me, but he feel and smell alone make this a very good beer. Classic Lagunitas character."
"A clear copper color with a solid off-white head and great lacing. The aroma is licorice malt and some herbal hops. A heavy alcohol presence with very dry bitter hops. A sort of stinging bitterness with plenty of alcohol warming. Some candied malt with solid body. Minimal drinkability but a tastey option."
"Lagunitas Imperial Red is an enjoyable, tasty strong ale. Highly recommended."
"D - Outstanding stuff."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a white head. Aroma is dominant of sweet caramel malt along with some piney hops. Taste is toasted malt, caramel, citrusy lemon zest and piney hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very easy drinking for 7.6%. Very tasty beer. Glad I picked it up."
"Drinkability is nice too. High quality beer here, I'd check it out if you see it."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, nice kick, this is a very good beer that has all of the elements to make it an excellent choice to drink for an entire evening."
"Maybe my bottle has been sitting around to long, but I'm not tasting the 80+ IBUs listed on the label. The appearance is a red-amber body with a white head and lacing. There's a general citrus and grapefruit flavor, aroma, and bitterness with very mellow, subtle malt flavors. The soft caramel and toffee flavor are nice, but tough to pull out. In general, a sweet citrus hop flavor rules this beer and I'd like more out of it."
"Red ales are hard to predict as there is a broad interpretation of this style. I wasn't expecting much when I opened the bottle, but what a nice surprise. Everything I have had recently from these guys has been decidedly delicious, and this red is no exception."
"The taste is similar, with all the elements noted in the aroma. It has a strong, full malty sweetness of caramelized plums, a hint of burnt sugar, more fruit, hint of pine, and quite a bit of cirtus, primarily grapefruit. The piney-citrus bitterness balances the strong sweetness and there is a light, but smooth, alcoholic warmth. It is creamy and full-bodied a bit pungent and heavy to drink a lot of, yet astill very drinkable."
"overall, i really enjoyed this and will get it again"
"Not a bad red, but I'm going to keep looking."
"Overall a great brew, I look forward to getting a 6pack. One bottle isn't enough!"
"Pours a clean deep amber color, with a small white to light tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity/ citrus hops, and a small sweet maltiness. In the taste, just as it smells, grapefruity hops, and a sweet malt backing it up. A hoppy and medium bodied mouthfeel and a small grapefruity hop aftertaste. A very nice hopy presence, smooth, easy, and good!"
"Couldn't finish the pint."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Okay on the drinkability scale."
"Deep reddish color, with a very inviting bright, fresh floral hop smell. Light beige head. Taste is as expected I'd guess, and is a ""big"" red ale. Quite well hopped, with a semi-strong rich lasting alcohol and hop aftertaste making it a bit difficult to drink. Not my preferred style, but good nonetheless."
"D: I could drink this until I cant remember...love imperial reds"
"This is smooth and on the lighter side for it's size, in both flavor and body, which helps it really go down with ease. On the other hand, it's not that appealing to me that I need to drink more then one, even though I'm sure I could get myself drunker then I mean to with this one."
"What a delicious brew... Hoppy--no, malty--no, hoppy notes hit first, followed by the malts which are biscuity and semi-sweet. As the beer warms, the bitterness of the hops comes to dominate the flavor profile, which is in no way a problem in my book. The hops are piny and fresh, leaving behind a strong bitter finish that I wished lingered a bit longer. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, well carbonated, and makes the palate sweat a bit. Drinkability is quite good...it could be higher if it weren't for the bruisingly bitter notes and high ABV, but irregardless, this is definitely a brew I'll be hoping to encounter again."
"Smells faintly of pine, and largely of malt. Taste is sweet malt balanced with some grapefruit and pine; just a splash of bitterness, really. Not gigantically flavorful, but very solid."
"drinkability - Very drinkable"
"A very smooth beer that goes down with ease and it is really a treat to drink something this tasty. Alcohol is hidden well. All in all a very drinkable beer here."
"Another enjoyable offering from Lagunitas."
"D: Very tasty and if the alcohol was lower, I might even say sessionable."
"Nice drinker, be careful becasue it certainly was an easy beer to consume. I could easily toss a few of these back before I realized what hit me!"
" I like this one alot but it seems more like a red IPA to me. 5-10 IBU's less and those great fruity malt flavors would stand up better and be on more equal footing with the hops."
"very nice beer."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Great, well-balanced taste with a very smoothe mouthfeel. Definitely an excellent beer."
"Orange brown in color. OK head with a heavy pour drops to a thin cap that leaves just spotty lacing. Smell is strong on piney hops up front followed by tons of sweet caramel malt. Very inviting smell. Taste of citrus up front that is quickly cut with the caramel malt and then finishes nicely with some resin hops bitterness. Nicely balanced overall since I can't decide if it's sweet or bitter but I get distinct impressions of both. A little syrupy on the mouthfeel. I was very happy with this one. Highly recomended."
"Pours a clear amber brown. Definite orange hue going on there. No head after a minute or two, but there is a lot of lacing left. Nose is very mild with what seems like an alcohol infused apple. Flavor is a bit hoppy, but not too much overall. Alcohol is noticable on the palate, but not overpoweringly so. Mostly just gives a deep earthy flavor profile. Feel has a good level of carbonation to it and a nice liquid body. Overall it is pretty drinkable. Not the strongest of strong ales, but it definitely doesn't lack some kick. Smooth and even, but not showy at all."
"Overall experience: Even at 7.6%...I find it sessionable. That's how drinkable it is."
"Wow, this is the best ""red"" i've had in general thus far. Sadly I have only had a half glass tasting of this on draught. I need to get some more of this. Strong but not overwhelming, smooth and beautiful color. A very unique red if it is allowed to classified as such. A must find!"
"Pours deep amber-red, with a large cream-colored head that leaves a heavy lace. Aroma is West Coast hops, crystal malt (probably fairly dark), unfortunately marred by a green apple-like acetylaldehyde note. The good news is that the acetylaldehyde is not very strong in the flavor, which is all dark crystal and West Coast hops. Finish is really nice, leaving a sweet malt tail that begs for more."
"The beer poured a dark amber with reddish hues, with a nice, creamy head. I detected a slight floral hop aroma before the first sip. There was a nice balance between the hop bitterness and malt sweetness - a more understated hop presence than in an IPA - as it should be. Thick lacing down the pint glass by the end of it all - and with a fairly decent, lingering hop bitterness. An enjoyable beer, although not as pumped-up as some of their other offerings. Their Kill Ugly Radio is still my favorite - try it if you get the chance - it is on-tap here at Frisco as I write this review."
"Drinkability: This is quite a good beer, but suffers because of being labeled incorrectly as a red ale. This is a much hoppier beer than most would expect, and might turn off people who buy it not expecting such a big hop flavor. Not a bad beer, just not a good Imperial Red. Bad first Lagunitas experience here, lets hope my Kill Ugly Radio is better."
"D: This is a very drinkable red ale - hoppy and malty, and very well-balanced."
"D- A very dangerous beer, very drinkable for the alcohol isn't noticeable."
"Pours a nice murky dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, which leaves some nice little islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slight tangyness, and lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, bitter, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is another tasty brew from Lagunitas, recommended."
"Clear, burnt orange-amber body with a thick cumulus head of light khaki. Great lacing. Wet, resinous hop aromas over rummy cookie dough malt and sugary fruits. Nice. Herbal, piny hop bitterness greets the tongue. Sugar cookie and fruit malt sweetness follow. Numbing, herbal hop bitterness around the edges. Pine sap and Scotch tape join in as the hop levels increase into the slightly warming, cookie dough finish. Medium-full body with an initial creamy feel that ends stickier. Very good."
"Drinkability/Notes: Lagunitas Imperial Red is very drinkable its scary. Nicely balanced between dark fruity sweetness and big and juicy hop bitterness. Alcohol is so well hidden for 7.6%, would make a great session beer if it wasn't for the alcohol content. A really nice beer when your hankering for a nice hoppy beer but also want a good amount of malt sweetness. Definitely a beer I will buy again. Highly recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"Smells very nice, as if I was smelling a beer flower. It has a nice bitterness, reminiscent of grapefruit which leaves an aftertaste, but it's not too much. Mad hops come through in this beer, very stimulating for the taste buds. Quite bubbly as well, which seems to fit with all the other characteristics. Not long until you feel that warmth. It's pretty easy to drink something this tasty, it doesnt seem to get boring. I'm glad I tried it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wouldn't be intimidated by the powerful taste."
"D- complex and tasty, very nice balance, quite an intriguing brew here. recommended"
"D: I would enjoy a number of these at one sitting and will be sharing with friends this weekend."
"The best thing here is how the nose opens up and develops into the middle of the body. A bit bitter, but heavy enough to support it. Not a bad ale for winter and very hearty foods."
"D: Easy drinking here. Very nice flavors meld dangerously well with the nearly 8% ABV. Highly recommended."
"D: Not bad. Easy to put back, but the overall effect of the whole beer doesn't leave me wanting more."
"Pours a deep carmel with a nice 1/2 inch head, and through the course of drinking the retention was decent with expected head diminishment over time. I found the nose to be shockingly delicate for an imperial, it had a hoppy front but it was well balanced with the malt. To me the mouth of this beer was much better than average, but I like heavy beers. I get a well balanced hit of the hop bitterness followed by a hint of carmel malts and a whallop of thick malty goodness at the end. I found a sixer of this and have enjoyed it immensly."
"D - This is a very good beer. It really has a nice blend of malt, spice and hops."
"This was a great surprise. I almost passed this one up but luckly, I picked up a full sixer. The abv is a little strong and noticeable for a 7.6% beer, but this one is an easy drinker."
"Sampled on tap at the Draught House in Austin, Texas."
"Overall, a very nice brew. This reminds me a lot of their Lucky #13. A lot of their beers are similar in this vein (Undercover as well). Some are better than others, this one is up there - not quite as good as I remember Lucky #13, but it is available in 6 packs."
"Finish reverts slightly back to the hops with a pleasant moderately bitter and crisp ending. Very easy to enjoy more than 1 or 2. Very nice stuff!!"
"Thanks to Shades!"
"After the pour this beer raises a full finger of foam which lingers a short while. It is a beautiful amber orange with small, tight carbonation bubbles. The hops and malt are both present in the nose with the malt winning out. The initial taste is of the malt which is quickly balanced by just the right amount of bitterness. As it warms the alcohol flavor kicks in and provides a near perfect balance of flavors. It has a thickness that lingers on the tongue for a wonderful mouthfeel. This is an exceptional beer! I have become a hophead as of late but, if I'm not having an IPA, I want this beer!"
"Quite drinkable for something of the style and 7.6% abv. Very nice offering from Lagunitas. Comparable to Arrogant Bastard, but finishes a little sweeter and doesn't have the fruit. Bottoms up!"
"I've recently become a big fan of red ales and this is a solid representative of that class."
"Pours a dark copper with a good head that fades to a cap. Ok lacing. Smells of citrusy hops with a dry malt background. The taste has a very nice lingering grapefruit bitterness nicely balanced with some slightly sweet malt. A very bitter orange pith finish. The mouthfeel is substantial and even a little thick. Quite a tasty brew, and perfect for winter. Real stick to your ribs kinda beer."
"This pours an outstanding creamy head with a great piney scent on the nose. Copper to red, deep red colour on the pour. Lacing all the way down the glass. Should be available permanently! Tons of hops, similar to Nuggett Nectar, almost comparable. Lots of malty flavors on the front and smooth hoppy bitterness on the back, extremely balanced. Highly recommended!"
"GOOD JOB LAGUNITAS!"
"pours a clear, reddish dark amber with light amber feet. Off white little head that has pretty poor retention but leaves nice lace and keeps a thin layer of foam. Smell is predominantly hoppy with a nice caramel and bread malty scent that compliments the hops really really well. The taste is just like what the nose told me it was going to be. What is really impressive is that the flavors blend flawlessly, creating one flavor. Nice. Medium body with great tasting water. Pleasure. I don't know about imperial, but this is really a nice beer. Not overboard, and not quite as good as my favorite - Red Rocket - but a fantastic beer nonetheless."
"Pours reddish amber with a medium sized off white head that displays nice retention and leaves solid lacing as it recedes. The aroma is inviting but distant. Hops and sweet caramel malt. The taste is not overly complex or as in your face as other imperial styles, but this is very enjoyable. Just a satisfyingly hoppy brew with enough malt character to balance the bitterness. The mouthfeel is luscious and thick with low, but adequate carbonation."
"Feel is a bit thick, has a minor bite. It really smooths out as it warms. Overall it's a good, bitter red, and full of flavor. Good for a couple, too bitter for a bunch of them."
"Orange, reddish amber color - not hazy, but clear. The head disappeared quickly, but this is fresh, so maybe I'm a terrible dishwasher. Nose of citrus oils and flowers. I taste modern, late addition hops with the added depth of juicy caramel malts. Perhaps I've said it before, but I rather prefer the hoppy reds and ambers these days due to their added malt component - one more piece in the puzzle; one more dimension. The finish is fruity with occasional notes of spice reminiscent of Indian curries. Hurray for California."
"D: Highly drinkable, but watch out, the ABV will get you"
"However, I love a strong ale now and then."
"The big hoppiness is balanced by a big maltiness and it's all around juicy. The mouthfeel is done right which, for me, is a big hurdle in truly enjoying Lagunitas' beer."
"Flavor is aggressive but balanced. The hop bitterness really shines as it warms, but doesn't completely dominate the strong malt sweetness. Definitely more of an IPA hybrid than a red ale."
"This is a very enjoyable beer. Almost too easy to enjoy."
"Overall Impression: Good flavor. Hop driven to be sure, with all the pine and citric notes this hits me as an XPA, possibly a low end IPA. Pretty solid beer, worth a shot!"
"Overall, this is a wonderful brew! In the past, Arrogant Bastard has been a go to beer of mine, alas it is not available where I currently reside. Luckily, Lagunitas has created (re-created) this beer, which makes up for my lack of the Bastard."
"Wow, what an awesome beer. Up there with Racer 5 and Founders Red's Rye. Thank heavens Lagunitas is here in Michigan, because this will become a staple in my beer diet. Excellent!"
"Drinkability - this is a very hop-centric ale, and a good one at that. It is a little high in abv to call it sessionable."
"Overall this is a very good beer, especially for hopheads."
"On tap at Falling Rock during GABF week. This was a nice red color with a decent aroma of hops. The mouthfeel was similar to all Lagunitas beers, creamy yet also slightly sweet. Flavor was some hops and some caramel. This beer was decent but I enjoyed the Hop Stoopid much, much more."
"16 oz pint glass at the Brick Store Pub. Shiny clear red hue with 1 finger of almond colored head. Aroma of sweetness and of course, hops. Body had a twinge of caramel/toffee nicely balanced with lots of hop flavor. Lovely hop flavor! Lite fruity hop, dry finish. My favorite from Lagunitas."
"Overall, another great beer from Lagunitas. It's not a red ale by any stretch.... aside from the color. Fantastic aroma though. Despite the ABV, I think I'll pick up a few more of these to cellar for a bit. I think the malt complexity could be really great once the hops fall a bit. Recommended, and worth seeking"
"Notes: I've had this a few times on tap recently (at the Lionheart in Albany) and thought it was excellent, so I grabbed the 6-pack today to try it in bottles. I think the tap version would score higher on the mouthfeel, but this is still a great beer in the bottle. And at Olivers I paid $10 for the sixer -- including tax & deposit -- which at $1.67 per bottle I thought was pretty reasonable. Another winner from LAH-goo-KNEE-tuss."
"Thanks to todd1 for the bottle. Clear orange/copper color with a small head. Good lacing. Aroma of citrus and sweet tropical fruit. Taste is pine and citrus hops with some caramel sweetness, bordering on brown sugar. A little 'bite' on the tongue, but it stops well short of being bitter. Fairly dry finish. A very well done American hop vehicle."
"Overall a very good and flavorful ale from a brewery I've heard a lot about, but only got the chance to try in my home state just this week. The label is correct when they say, '...a muscular malty thorax...' and it's just what the doctor ordered going into the fall season. I'd love the chance to pair this with a fresh piece of carrot cake with sour cream frosting. This is a very sturdy and hearty ale for sure. I like it."
"Best I've had so far from Lagunitas. I like it much more than I expected."
"My first Lagunitas beer. I have no idea what an Imperial Red Ale is, but nice, hoppy West Coast beer is always a welcome addition to my palate and gut. Pours a clear amber/reddish color with a big ivory head. Head retention and lacing are excellent. Smell gave a promise of hoppiness and also a scent/flavor that I couldn't identify. Some people refer to toffee in connection to the malts. I didn't get any standard malty scent or flavor so I'll go with ""toffee"" also. Taste was good....hoppy as a good IPA but with this additional flavor as well. Mouthfeel is fairly rich....the first swallow provides the coating for the rest of the beer...nothing thin about this one. Very crisp and hoppy. A nice slight change of pace for an IPA loving hophead. ABV is a bit high for a session beer, but this one is very drinkable."
"D- Drinks almost too easy, I really enjoy this beer"
"Very drinkable, gives Nugget Nectar a run for it's money. Shame there isn't any fresh around to compare it to. This is a very well done imperial!"
"D- This beer has great big hop flavor but not much bitterness and a strong sweet malt flavor. This is a hop monster that is also a nice session beer because of the complexity of the hops and smoothness of the bitterness."
"Served chilled in a pint glass from a stubby twelve ounce brown bottle. Poured a beautiful , dark copper red color that had awesome clarity. About a finger and a half of thick, dense, bubbly white head formed from a somewhat vigorous pour. Head faded a bit on the quick side, but left decent lace behind. Smell was of fresh floral hops, a nice citrus and pine burst, a nice maltiness, and a hint of caramel. Taste was as good, maybe a bit better than the nose. Tons of hops, citrus fruits, touches of pine in the background. A sweet malty backbone balances this brew out pretty nicely. Had a nice pleasant, full bodied mouthfeel. Perfectly carbonated. Awesome drinkability. This one is definitely a keeper."
"Poured into a Ruination tumbler, the beer was reddish copper color with thick foam and short-lived lacing. The aroma was a nice mix, strong evergreen hits of hops over a cake of malty wort. There was a lot of all ingredients in this, thus the ""Imperial"" name I guess. The flavor was the same, hops and a strong malt base giving a good healthy balance to this red ale. Very drinkable and completely recommended."
"Malts are thick on the palate. There is a very nice hop bitterness too follow. Strong malts and strong hops, but not too overdone like other beers where it gets to be too much. This beer sticks to the mouth very well and would make a pretty decent session beer. Give it a try."
"My second from this brewer. It won't be my last."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark reddish copper color with a stick off-white head. The aroma is sweet malt with an array of oily hops. The taste explodes with the hops as they provide a nice bite and is complemented nicely by a nice malt backbone. Wow, this is a very tasty brew that is highly recommended. Hop heads rejoice, highly recommended."
"Another great beer from Lagunitas, check out Kill Ugly Radio as well with the bottle art of Frank Zappa on it"
"Very drinkable even with the 7.6%abv. Malts provide a creamy aspect to the mouthfeel. No alcohol to be seen in the nose or taste. This is a very IPAish Strong Ale. Recommended for hop fans."
"This is a good rich beer. Im glad to see that they released it in a 6pak instead of just the bomber. It has a big hop smell to it and pours a dark copper tone to it. The alcohol is noticeable at 7.6 but is just about right for easy drinking. There is a big hop taste. I would almost call it a red IPA."
"The mouthfeel is tremendous, with a relatively high level of carbonation, which is a great compliment to the strong hop character. It results in a very bright, crisp feel. Drinkability? Superb. It goes down very smoothly, but with a pleasant dry bite to finish it off. This is a beer you experience."
"Drinkability: The lasting bitter finish kind of builds up and hinders drinkability somewhat."
"Highly recommended. Love to see these interesting reds - the Lucky 13 is great also."
"had this style only once before so when i saw ""imperial red"" i had to get some. pours a deep, dark ruby red with an off-white head. big american hops in the nose, piney and citrusy, along with caramel, toffee, and dark, ripe fruit aromas. peaches? taste is started off by just a little malt sweetness but the big malts still make their presence felt. dryer profile than i expected but it still works. bitterness kicks in quickly. shitloads of hops for a ""red"" style beer. looong finish. mouthfeel is medium/big. drinkability suffers from the abv. will definitely revisit this one."
"Dark, deep, glowing amber body. Thick and rocky stained white head. Lace is quite bountiful. Beautifully balanced nose of rich, thick caramel malts and resiny hop oils and tropical fruit sensations. The flavor of this beer is delicious as well. Across the board, this beer is in the ""Very Good to Great"" category. The caramel and toffee malt base is very sturdy and rich and thick. The hops add some tropical fruit qualities....especially sweet, ripe pineapple. The bitterness is held in check and the alcohol is barely perceptible. This beer is full bodied and full flavored and a bargain at $1.49 for a single."
"D: The abv is creeping upward but the big malts are nicely done."
"Enjoy!"
"Moderate ABV that is more than easy too drink...a great session beer in my opinion, cheers!"
"Imperial Red pours a rusty clear amber color with a thin head. Lace is consistant throughout. Smell is a good mix between mild citrus/piney scents with a soft carmel undertone. Hopiness is clear but not overwhelming. Taste overall I feel is well balanced. The hops slightly overpower the malt. At first the hops fill your palate, but the finish is more of a caramel malt. Taste seems to be quite fresh and crisp for a 7.6 abv. Very smooth for an ""Imperial"". I was quite suprised by this ale. A lot more drinkable than I had assumed. Surely give this one a try if you enjoy your Arrogant Bastard type brews."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my Samuel Adams shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears the color of cloudy iced tea with two fingers of cream colored foam. There is a moderate amount of lacing coating the glass. Smells of rich caramel malt, piney hops and raisins. Tastes of the same bitter, piney hops evident in the nose, as well as lemon, and sweet caramel. Finish is dry and bitter. Moderate in both body and carbonation. A nicely balanced ale. One I would seek out again on it's next release."
"Cheers!"
"taste provides a nice balance of hops, malts,and a little citrus, alcohol is masked very well, makes this very drinkable."
"Drinkability: alcohol kind of catches up to you in this beer. A hearty and full flavored beer is not a session beer at all, but enjoyable on a cold evening."
"App - 3.5, Smell - 3.5, Taste - 3.5, Mouth - 4.0, Drink - 4.0"
"D - This is a wonderfully balanced, supremely drinkable beer that's got all it's parts in place. A pleasure to drink."
"This is one hell of an ale. A bit ""over-the-top", being an ""imperial red"" - very complex with full aromas and a delicious taste. It's an American Strong Ale with characteristics of a red ale...a wonderful brew that's a good ""sipping"" beer that is very easy to drink for the abv. Well-done!"
"D - That sweetness on the aftertaste gets a little annoying. Still, this is an interesting take on an American Strong Ale."
"Imperial red, like imperial pilsner, is a style open to a wide variety of interpretations still. This is a whole different animal from say Troegs Nugget Nectar, but definitely an enjoyable beer."
"The mouthfeel is good, but a tad syrupy, and the drinkability suffers just a little bit. Nitpicking aside, an outstanding beer."
"Over all seems pretty balanced.... if you like hops!"
"D: Another solid beer from Lagunitas. Sweet, but not overly sweet, with just enough hop balance to please anyone. Very drinkable and pretty yummy."
"22 oz. bottle- color of light mahogany , with a light off white head - nose of piney hopps , earthy , malty , tar / resin , and light citrus  taste of grapefruit , malts , tar , hopps and resin - body medium carbonation , and earthy aftertaste of resin , hopps and light citrus"
"Poured a deep red amber with little head, and what was there faded quickly. But the nice cloudy amber looked good. Smelled of deep malts with a hint of dark fruit and a bit of a sweetness and alcohol. The taste was rather fruity. Dark fruit commanded the flavor with a subtle sugary behind it almost grape like, very enjoyable. Rather intresting and not what I would expect. No hint of the alcohol whatsoever and that makes this very drinkable. My first offering from Lagunitas and it definatly has me intrested."
"Pours a clear red/copper, thick white head forms, some lace and good retention, settles to a good layer. Smell is sweet, lots of toffee, metallic, some pine and floral, nice. Taste is malty, caramel crystal malt grainy flavour, pine and floral, sugary finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with low carbonation. Not bad, didn't do much for me."
"Cheers!"
"I would love to session this on tap, although i doubt i'd be fortunate to find it. A drinkable red if you like them bitter, if not stay away."
"Overall- This has a big strong bold flavor. A 6er of this and you would be feeling just right!"
"drinkability: fine"
"Overall: This beer is good, just a little booring."
"Pours a hazy amber copper color with a good sized creamy cream colored head that recedes very slowly and laces the glass nicely. There is some faint citrus aroma along with sweetness from the malts, white grapey and sprite-like sweetness. Taste is well balanced, although the hops again only present a mild citrus flavor and the mats are sugary sweet, there is a nice hop balance with some dryness and bitterness. Medium in body, sugary with a silky smooth creaminess. Nice example of a strong ale, incredibly easy to drink, not super hoppy like some, but just well balanced and tasty."
"Drinkability: The bitterness is too much, and the taste isn't enough to keep me interested in this beer. I've gone through one pint, and have no interest in trying more. I'm not so unimpressed to give it a label of being unimpressive."
"40.63 IBU's according to the label, but this has a larger profile than indicated. Assertive bitter hop character dominates the palate to begin which is supplanted by a malty sweetness by midsip. Iced tea flavor which was present in the nose is here as well with the delicate balance of bitter and sweet. An interesting beer, not sure I would categorize it as a Strong Ale, but it is good nonetheless."
"Drinkability: Though the hops can be a little cutting at times its a rather likeable red ale, and quite quaffable."
"Great tasting,refreshing,juicy.I want more,more,more.Extremely drinkable even with the tounge feeling like it just trippled in size."
"It initially tastes like juicy mandarin oranges, and it bitters with time. I get more caramel as the beer warms, along with subtle alcohol tones. The finnish is almost cottony dry and I find sharing a six-pack over a single conversation to be trivial."
"Not only was this a solid winner, it also served to reinforce my opinion of Lagunitas. I really like everything that they are doing and hope to visit during WHF2, Summer Tour 2007."
"good beer though, really."
"Mouthfeel- The finish is very sweet for an IPA. Caramel like sweetness."
"I guess this Imperial red category is a new trend. I've tried the terrapin hoppy monster and this Lagunitas has a little more hops showing thru. And had a much larger head on it. I can see why they call these beers red though. The color when under a light is tranlucent. So vibrant with dark ruby overtones.One other difference between a dbl Ipa and a red imperial ale seems to be more malty and less hoppy bitternes. The extra malts do a good job of hiding the high alcohol level."
"D - tasty, but nothing spectacular in my book."
"22 oz bomber; 11 oz sample. The beer pours a very deep amber color with a finger of ivory head that falls to a full coat over top. The clarity is fairly good, and the carbonation is minimal. The nose is nice as well. There is a moderate caramel maly, with a solid biscuity character that adds a graineyness to the brew. There is a nice moderate earthy hop in there that adds nicely to the grainyness of the malt. I like the earthy quality of the beer. The flavor is very nice. It is incredibly strong in earthy British hops that pairs well with a solid biscuit malt graineyness. There is a mild caramel malt behind it that adds sweetness that really rounds things out. The bitterness really hits nicely on the finish, while maintaining some reserve and not being offensive. This is a nice tasting brew. The feel is thick, with a solid modeate carbonation to it. I am a fan of this brew. Even though the earthy flavors are not my favorite, I think this one makes them very approchable. It is defiantely very approachable even with the strong biscuity character and the earthy flavors. I will grab more of this in the future."
"Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster was the first beer I have had, that claimed to be an Imperial Red Ale, and this is the second one that I have run across with that claim. The beer poured exceptionally clear, and had a hue that was amber, tinged with ruddy pink. The head was two fingers high, and the carbonation was steady and finely textured, so the head lingered on. While the looks were quite stunning, the mild aroma was subtly redolent with citric and floral hops. The taste was quite balanced for the style, with the bitter hops being just a little more dominant than the succulent caramel and pale malts. The hoppy aftertaste was supplemented by saltwater taffy like mouthfeel that was both sticky and mineralized dry at the same time. It did however feel thinner than what the label description suggested. Although classified as an American Strong Ale around here, I find this to be lot more similar to a standard (or a double) IPA. At first, it was hard to believe they rate this at 84.20 IBU, which is starting to approach Ruination territory, but as the pint glass neared emptiness, and the hop burps reached a crescendo, the realization hit that I had basically been immunized with Pacific Northwest hops. May I have more please?"
"Beer poured a deep amber with a nice tan long sustaining head. Nose is a nice combination of citrus and malts. Taste is a wonderful blend of malty goodness and a nice blast of citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is full for the style and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is very good. The abv is well masked. This beer is extremely smackable and recommended to those who enjoy a malty beer that is well hopped!"
"All in all another solid beer from Lagunitas, it's seasonal, so give it a try if you can find it."
"The drinkabilty of the beer is scary, because it goes down so smooth, you forget about the alcohol content. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"Copper-colored with a half-inch of beige lumpy froth that lingers long. Faint aroma of doughey malt and ripe fruits, some grainy brown sugar, plus a subtle hop aroma riding beneath. Flavor of light brown sugar malt, some toasted malt notes, piney hops, and the slightest sting of ABV. A grapefruit peel bitterness lingers, mellowed slighlty by a malt sweetness. Good balanced flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round and satisfying. Thanks to BeerRun13 for sending this one along."
"Pours translucent mahogany, frothy off-white head that sticks around leaving some lacing. Nose: bright waft of cotton-candy sweetness encompasses a solid hop bouquet, gritty and citrusy. Taste: melon-sweet upfront yet quickly undercut by a pleasantly grating hop bitterness. The middle is all hops -- drilling a hole through the roof of my mouth, lovely -- leavening off into a lingering hop feedback and static, as the malt sweetness curls around the edges of my palate, fading. Middling carbonation, slick mouthfeel with some weight to it. Another good one from Lagunitas."
"Poured a deep, dark red. What little head there was disappeared quickly. Smells immediately of hops, with maybe a bit of citrus and then the malt. It tastes almost exactly as the smell would lead you to believe; clear (almost surprising) hops up front, then a little bit fruity and sweetly malty. Finishes dry with another little hop kick. Maybe the I shouldn't be surprised, as the ingredients are listed as ""...hops, malt, hops, yeast, hops, water, and hops."" If I haven't made my point by now, this is a special ale with some extra hops thrown in. Good stuff. This is a very drinkable beer, especially considering its ABV. It makes for a great change of pace, but I'd have to be careful with this baby."
"D: I could kick back and drink a few of these. Someone call my work! I'm calling in sick!!!!"
"If you love 'Hairy Eyeball' and 'Brown Shugga', you'll probably love this one too, becuase I do."
"Lagunitas brews quite a few good, but far from outstanding, beers. Just when I consider writing them off as an also-ran in the cutthroat world of Calfornia craft beer, I drink a Brown Shugga' or a Lagunitas IPA or a Cappuccino Stout. And now I can add Imperial Red Ale to that distinguished list. This is great beer folks. Especially if you're a quart low on hops."
"saying what *^%$##@*."
"Mouth: Enters with a light fruity bitterness up front and a huge, long lasting, dry, bitter finish. This is the epitome of grapefruit flavored hops. Some pitted fruit, apricot, in the fore flavor. Excellent carbonation all the way through, in spite of its rather flat appearance."
"A very nice beer. This is one I would enjoy with light appetizer fare like buffalo wings. Also a very nice selection to sit with on a warm summer day. Try one for yourself if you have the chance."
"D - Good. One of the better Lagunitas beers on the market."
"This offering from Lagunitas delivers a maroon foggy body with a creamy tan head that disappears quickly. The aroma is west coast hops, herbal, sweet, baked cookies, and a promising caramel sweetness. The taste is the opposite of the nose, the nasal part of my palate was thinking ""sweet malt bomb"" but this offering came at me with a brutal bitter hoppy citrus rind pimp slap. This is a good brew and balances that aggresive hop taste with some toffee goodness that again ends bitter. Another great offering from Lagunitas."
"Plenty of hop bitterness, orange rind and grapefruit, but also some pine. Hoppiness is nice and fresh, not just bitter. Loads of malt, somewhat sweet. Sticky mouthfeel reminds me of Lagunitas IPA. Thick, sticky lace paints the side of the glass, with hardly a hole to see through it. This is a serious beer."
"The more I drink reds the more I enjoy them and the Lagunitas is right there at the top when it comes to reds that I have had. Normal carbonation but very little head. Tons of different citrus flavors flow through it, such as orange and pineapple. A definite must for any red ale fan or actually any beer fan!!"
"D: This is my favorite Lagunitas to date. This is a darn good red ale."
"Another good offering from Lagunitas. Deep dark red color, with a very slight head. Smell is a bit faint, but has a sweet malty and subtle hop aroma. The taste is dominated by the sweet malts, but it certainly has a hoppy enough finish to balance it out well. It says it's an imperial red, but to me it almost tastes like a barleywine that is toned down just a bit."
"Solid, throroughly."
"D: It does go down very easily and for something that has a slightly high ABV, it's very easy to drink and easy to lose track of how many you've had. A good solid beer, but probably not something I'd go out of my way to get."
"A nice Red with a bolder rendition of flavor and length then the normal Red's one would find. So the Imperial label is suiting to a certain degree. I liked the play in textures between the malts and the hops. A fun beer to drink and good to boot."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I'm picking some more up from Bevmo on my next run, assuming they're not all out."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation. Bitterness is kind of tough to keep the drinkability high."
"D: Pretty good red. Slighly on the heavy side, does not go down as easily as some. Nevertheless good tasting beer."
"Clear deep amber color, light tan foam reaches a full inch and holds nicely. Good streaming carbonation throughout. Smell is mild with a caramel malt and sweet grassy hop mix. Flavor begins without much complexity, the bitterness hits first and finally I can detect some nutty malt. It just really misses the front of the tongue. Lots of hop presence but its a bit dank, and leaves a slight sourness afterward. The alcohol is fairly noticible. Mouthfeel has a good creaminess and sharp carbonaion, not bad. The main problem with this beer is the flavor, and unfortunately that's the most important part. Worth trying but I wasn't into it."
"Reddish with a slight haze, it poured with a thin, light tan head that reduced to a ring. Some lacing. Clean pine and grapefruit aroma with a bit of caramel thrown in. Lots of piney hops in the flavour, with a bit of citrus and caramel. Medium body and carbonation, slightly dry. This is a tasty beer - solid malt and tons of hops. Thanks biegaman!"
"Appears a deep amber hue with a light tan cream head leaves even lacing. Aroma has a deep piney floral character with semi sweet caramel tone evident alcohol presence. Taste: Biscuit dough and caramel toned complex a bit of a peppery herbal, piney, floral hop bite pretty quality mix of flavors. Mouthfeel has a medium body slightly resinous evenly carbonated. Drinkability is nice but let's be serious an Imperial Red can we say IPA."
"Pours a ruby/amber color with about an inch of off-white head that remains as a thin blanket the entire glass. Leaves nice rings of lacing down the glass. The smell is of sweet malts with a bit of citrus as well...very inviting. Flavor comes first from the malts...sweet and a little bready, then the hops pop up with a citrusy, bitter kick at the finish. Nicely balanced between the two. Mouthfeel is just shy of being thick and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Now, if they could only start showing up in stores around here...."
"Very fresh and mouthwatering. Mmmmm resinous pine."
"The balance and tasty, sticky hop flavors make this very enjoyable. Resinous and sweet at the same time...mmmm. I love a balanced brew."
"Once you get used to the hops, this is a great beer with good drinkability and excellent flavor. While I'm not as much of a hop head as some, I was still able to get into this one... eventually. With any luck, I might be able to ID the hops."
"A decent imperial red, but I still prefer offerings from Bear Republic and others."
"Impressive, hazy orange color with a decent, thin head on top. Citrusy aroma-reminds me of the smell of an orange lollypop. Quite the mix of flavors. Grapefruit, orange baby aspirin (but in a good way), fresh cut grass, and spices-black pepper? The funny thing is they all work together. Leaves a sweet sticky flavor on my lips though the beer itself finishes dry. Good body. Overall a very interesting and unique beer. The flavors might make for too much after a bottle or 2 so I sort of knock it down a notch in drinkability. Well worth a try however."
"D - Easily drinkable and very smooth. Nice and hoppy."
"650ml Imperial Red, with more ridiculous but lovely nonsense on the label from Lagunitas. Nice to see this, a SEASONAL from a US micro(doesn't happen too often up here), at the Kensginton Wine Market. Popping the cap gives a wafting aroma of rubber and brown sugar. The beer's colour is in between ruby and light orangish-red. Actually the hue itself is somewhat hard to describe...but I like it. Possibly a very dark rusty water or cola with red food colouring. The head is long-lived and compact with seamless little bubbles, cream-coloured. Walls of whiter lacing that cling well. Exquisite appearance, though interestingly a little ""browner"" than other reds I have sampled. Aroma--now this is what I was looking for this week. After the Maximus last night and Rogue's DIPA, this beer's maltier but still hop-filled smell is a welcome guest to the nose. What I like about the aroma is how it makes you continually sniff in order to find if the hops or the malts are dominant...what's the word?...oh yeah: balance. Wonderful complementing of the thick barley notes with spicy wild citrus hops. The malting makes the first impression, burnt and almost barley-wine sweet. Phenolic, solvent-like, piquant, with notes of licorice and horehound, almost medicinal. The sugar is all here too, like bubble gum and caramel, toffee, and vanilla wafer. I also get some faint strawberry, and a little lemon. Now thrust your nose deeper into the glass and get your dose of some earthy tree-bark hoppiness, perhaps a little hard to find at first, but once they come out it really shows off how well-hopped the beer really is. Just enough. The beer's nose is fantastic. The taste does not disappoint, starting with fairly basic but tasty roasted gristiness. The beer is a little weak on the front of the tongue actually, but the middle and finish make up for it with a wonderful rush of soft but bitter hopping and leaving the mouth with lip-smacking sweetness with the floral hopping adding some sweet perfume flavours. Again, balance is the name of the game. Cinnamon and chicory, lactosy malts that bring tastes of buttered toast and peanuts. Red licorice and light brown sugar, with some mollasses. Sweet, but with enough hopping to satisfy the h-heads. Complex enough, but beyond the complexity is just the solidity of the malts working with hops and vice versa. A medium carbonation, moderate bitterness, and very little alcoholic burn make this an extremely drinkable strong red ale. Through balance, Lagunitas just made this beer WORK, by coincidence or design matters not...this is a flavourful slaker of my thirst. I will be buying more."
"Boy is this guy easy to drink. Pours a pretty red color, very clear, with tons of puffy head, just tons of it. Smell is hoppy and piney, some good maltyness too. Taste reminds me of an IPA, hoppy, grassy, earthy, a bit of a twang to it. Mouthfeel is sudsy and light. Very easy to drink these, a few of these, at a time."
"On tap at Dee's. Hoppy piney aroma and variety of hops in citrus taste that worked. Tasty.Spicey and fruity finish. Medium and good mouthfeel. Good understated carbonation. resin-works. Drinkable, could stay on it all evening. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"This is a great beer, well worth seeking out."
"Fantastic stuff, I am thoroughly impressed. Most reds are either too cloyingly malty or too hopped up or simply too bland and watery, but this bad boy is beautifully balanced along with it's high octane hepped up flavour profile. I'll be stocking up on more of this, a very welcome limited release from Lagunitas."
"Never had an ""Imperial Red"" before...most likely a highly-hopped amber ale? Let's see: Poured into a standard pint glass, the beer is a shimmering transparent copper with a thick, clinging ecru head. Detectable aromas of pine sap and bitter citrus pith -- confirmation of extra hops, I imagine. Indeed, the hop content of Lagunitas' Imperial Red Ale is certainly on the high side: notes of grapefruit rind and sweetish blood oranges. Malt presence is discernible, but only just, and primarily as a caramel/toffee flavor fighting for survival in a sea of hop juice. Bitter piney finish -- Chinooks maybe? Sticky lacing clumps around the glass in a web pattern. Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and smooth. Thicker body than most red/amber ales, but nothing too hefty. In fact, this is quite drinkable -- at least for a slave to the hop like me."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very extra medium mouthfeel. The carbonation provides a good lift on the taste and drinkability of the beer. The beer is a very smooth and easy drinking beer. I wish I had more of this to drink later."
"This one lives up to its name. Pours a deep red, rusty brown with a thick, two-fingered head that leaves lacing on the glass. The nose is quite fragrant, with piney hop aromas and earthy hop aromas intermingling. It's quite a big hop nose -- what you'd expect from an imperial red from Cali. Tastewise this one starts off with bitter hops. The hops are briefly interrupted by sweeter malt notes before the hops come back in the finish. The flavors and body of the beer are very full and well-rounded. This is a very well rounded beer; its only drawback is drinkability, which is diminished by its weight in the stomach, which is pretty substantial. That fact makes it a beer that wouldn't be ""sessionable""."
"I really enjoyed this beer, but found it more like an IPA or Imperial IPA than a red. I'm still not sure what the difference is."
"Poured a deep copper/amber with a well established of white head that took quite awhile to subside leaving a sheet of lace behind.Grapefruit and and other citrus fruit dominate the aromas with a lighter pine notes and caramel,lightly roasted malt.The hop profile is nice on the palate but I dont think there is quite enough of malt base for a red there is a light roasted and sweet base but not qite enough to hold up to the hop attack.Saying that it is a nice beer and I like the hops,its close to being very top notch."
"The beer disembarks the 22-ounce brown bottle a sparkling burnished copper color with a behemothic semi-creamy light tan head that ever so slowly erodes leaving a thick and clinging sheet of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose has a spicy hop floral aroma, chased by the sweet malt, citrus crisp, and as clean as the air after a sprint rain, absolutely mouthwatering, start is lightly sweet, the grain presence noticeable, the top is light to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is kind in its acidity, the hops are dynamic in their spiciness, making themselves known quickly and lasting to the very end, leaving a fresh tangy aftertaste, Whoa Nellie, this aint your normal Red Ale, and another treat from those fine folks at Lagunitas."
"Adam"
"If it weren't for the bitter finish, this beer would be extremely quaffable."
"I had this on tap on two different ocassions, at one of my favorite local restaurants (a place I pretty much go to because of the bar). Poured into a regular pint glass... very attractive and somewhat translucent red color, with a rich white head. The first thoughts I had were ""this tastes like an IPA"" and ""this tastes like cranberries."" And despite not being a huge cranberry fan, I was definitely a huge fan of this beer. Very hoppy, sort of piney flavor to it. Definitely tasted like a high-alcohol beer, but in a good way. If you like strong bitter ales and/or IPAs, give this a try!"
"Striking red color and creamy head give this ale a complete package for looks. Smooth transition between hoppy start and soothing malt finish. Flavors in lock step with IBU listed on label. Not sure where this fits in style, other than it has 7%+ ABV for an American strong ale. I would need some grilled meat with a heavy sauce to stand up to the hops in this brew. Overall a happy hoppy experience although 40+ IBU's are a little much for me unless enjoyed with a balancing meal."
"This seems like a perfect beer for the ""American Strong Ale"" tag. It's not an IPA, and it has alot of the qualities of a Barleywine, on a smaller scale. Whatever it is, it's a pretty great beer, one I wouldn't mind having again."
"I really like the style that Lagunitas was shooting for, and I thought they pulled it off very well. Red body, but what were you expecting? Taste was very interesting. Carmel sweetness is present, but a lot of the experience was the alcohol coming through. Made the taste full and raw, with some grassy grain to boot. I would like to see more in the style of DRA."
"Drinkability: Hmm. I don't know... maybe it's just because I'm damn full from the dinner I had a little while ago, but I'm not finding this exceptionally drinkable. Goes pretty well with Japanese ""Rich Harvest"" cookies (almond-sesame-chocolate flavor)."
"Much more hops than expected from an American Red Ale; that's why is characterized by an American Strong Ale. Hop aroma is evident even before the glass reaches the nose. Pine and flowery aromas swirl around a bready, malty sweet smell. Tastes boldly of sweet malts: bready, caramelly, lightly toasted, and a tad grainy. The the hops...more than just bittering. Flowery flavors, herbal, grassy, earthy, and a little dirty (for extra measure). The taste is muddled a bit, but certainly adds character to an otherwise unappealing brew. Finishes dryer than expected from Reds because of the hop character and alcohols that go largely forgotten. I look forward to having another."
"Ok the imperial red name is kinda silly, and they give you no actual descrition on the bottle, however I buy everything Lagunitas puts out at least once. This one is a winner. If you like this try Drake's IPA, it is very similar tasting."
"tasty but nothing I will go ape looking for. for $5 a bomber it is pretty good though if you have it available locally."
"The alcohol presence is detectable, but doesn't overpower all of the flavor complexities of this brew. A unique take on the style; well balanced and a good flavor profile. My favorite Lagunitas offering to date."
"Good stuff."
"Final thoughts - Lagunitas' other beers may have been forgettable - this is a smack outta' the freakin' ballpark for any self-respecting, hop-adoring American. It takes a seriously good beer to get me to write reviews like this one these days! :)"
"A pleasant and strong ale here that I liked a lot. Hoppy but accessible for both hopheads and non-hopheads. I could almost say that this is a really mellow barley wine; but the brewer says it is an Imperial red Ale so I guess that it is."
"Drinkability was rather high, really well balanced and enjoyable, big step up from all the generic red ales out there, worth seeking out."
"I am really starting to like some of Lagunitas' offerings quite a bit. This one was especiallly good. It beers a deep red inviting red. It has a strong malt profile, no doubt, but has an even stronger fruity hop bite. As the previous reviews state, it is quite smooth going down which makes it fairly drinkable despite the fact that it tastes bigger than its actual alcohol content."
"Pours a bright orange-red color topped by a half-inch of off-white head that sticks around a while. Aroma of fresh floral hops, with a little bit of sweet malt in the background. Palate is thick with both assertive floral hops and lightly sweet malt. Notes of pine and and light fruit come through. Body is nice and sturdy, with a slightly syrupy feel that provides a warming finish. Still, the alcohol is hidden fairly well. Overall, I have to say this one is pretty tasty."
"Medium mouthfeel and an average drikability. Definitely a bomber that I'm glad I picked up. Worth a try."
"This is a beer for hop lovers, it is fairly aggressive. This beer is raw and hoppy and I almost think that this beer could use a bit more malt sweetness to amplify the hop character. A bit more malt might play up the citrus notes a bit more, and soften the raw hoppiness a bit. As it is you will definitely want to be a hop head to enjoy this one. Luckily I can be, and am, so this is quite enjoyable."
"D - very much so, a good ale for drinking with or without food"
"I saw this and had to try it. It pours a orange red color with a huge tan foamy head. The smell is very strong with a citrus,grapefruit, hop aroma. The taste has a very nice citrus start and ends with some hop bitterness. The m/f is light and the only problem I have with this beer is the very bitter aftertaste is a little too bitter. Maybe I should age one. All in all, This is a brew that you should not pass up and I will buy it again."
"Cheers."
"Lagunitas rarely gets put into the top 10 lists on the message boards, nor does it get a whole lot of attention that it deserves. Thank you for such a fine brew, Fresh, Crisp, Sharp. Yummmm."
"Actually this beer is quite drinkable for an Imperial anything. . . As a homebrewer I appreciate the distinct pronunciation of the malt and the hops. Not much to compare to except as a version of an IIPA, not as bitter as an IIPA but yet with more hop aroma. A very nice brew indeed."
"Overall impression: Not bad - smooth mouthfeel leads to a high drinkability, but the bitterness was a bit much. Not quite enough malt backbone to go with the other flavors."
"The beer pours a nice dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. There are plenty of floaties present. The aroma is great. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of pale, roasted, and crystal malts along with an intense piney hop aroma. It seems a bit warm, but it's well hidden with the malts. The taste is great also. It has a very bitter hop flavor with a nice solid malt base. It boasts of crystal and roasted malts and adds good balance. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine brew. I love the hop character. It really makes the taste. This is a good drinker."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good. Sugary sweetness with a nice hoppy bitterness to balance it out. Medium bodied with nice carbonation."
"Last swigs: Essentially a red that thinks its a 2IPA. This brew gets street cred for throwing the word RED into an exciting flavor."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" of tan head over the, well, I'll be darned, red brew. Head holds well, with very sticky lacing prevalent. Aroma is sweet malts with a potent leafy, fruity pine hops aroma. The taste follows the nose, with sticky sweetness on the lips, but balanced and more so by the potent hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is very nice as well. One of the better imperials from Lagunitas, nice to see them not over do the hops here."
"The taste is heavy on the malt with a surprising hop bite towards the end of each sip. A sweet carmel core comes through and with a little higher alchohol content might taste similar to a barleywine."
"Another tasty beer from Lagunitas!"
" The big malt presence here with nice hops makes for a great brew."
"Bomber bottle, pours dark orangy almond amber. Tan tight head, showing some retention. Some fine scattered lacing left on the glass Nose here is faily thin and of citric hops and mildly toasted malts. This is rich, flavorful brew. Nice malty package of sweat notes, hops are just around the corner to delver a drying note and finish. Smooth and rounded, nicely done. Big and bold but not over the top. Well worth trying a bomber or two."
"Very recommended IMO especially if you are into big and hoppy strong ales."
"I know that this is not the highest IBU brew out there, but the hops just laid heavy over the malt body, giving it just enough exposure to tantalize, but not enough to be able to savor. And that's a shame, because the malt spine of the beer did tease with some worthwhile elements worthy of further exploration and discovery. But, the hops, and their rather simplistic bittering result, just weren't interesting enough to be the headliner. Nothing offensive here, and it IS drinkable, on the surface, but considering I can get hops lots of places, and often with something a bit more going on in partnership, I'd have to say it was enough of a disappointment that I won't be dipping back into this well unless it was pretty much devoid of real competition."
"Drinkability: The hop flavor is a bit stronger than I would like, but it is certainly a very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"The beer pours a mighty amber, with orange highlights. The head rises to 2 inch thick proportions. The smell is highly hoppy with subtle hints of nectar and nuts. The taste has a uniques blend of citrus hops with the dark burnt malts. Almond flavor with bitter afterlingings. A nice feel. A great beer for those twilight nights. Very nice."
"This beer surprised me. Was not expecting this quality. But Lagunitas always seems to pull through. Pours a clear, orange-ish brown in color. Thin layer of head on top. Spotted lace. Nose is both malts and hops. Another off-style beer. Almost a double (I)PA. Not quite sure. Taste is really nicely balanced with the malts and hops. At first sweet and malty, but then followed up with a fairly potent hoppy kick. Served cold; it reminds me of wintergreen gum. Would that be minty? Can't pick up any of the alcohol in this beer. Medium body, but the best quality of this beer is that it does not tire the taste buds but has all sorts of nuances."
"Hops come through strong in both the smell and taste. Amber malts take over in the middle of the taste, but hops take over up front and in the finish. The mouthfeel is a little thin in comparison with the amount of flavor here. Still, it's unique and pleasing."
"Well, Imperial RED Ale isn't red, it's more of a clear darkish amber. The mouthfeel is great- there's enough maltiness, bitterness and just the right amount of carbonation. This brew is as bitter as a well-hopped IPA, as malty as an amber or red ale and deliciously smooth with a hearty, yet subtle, 7.6% ABV. Yum."
"Smooth and hugely malty with a surprisingly assertive hop kick. Caramel malts swim around pungent hop oils which actually leave the palate with an impression of dryness (despite the malty-sweet onset of the beer). Distinctly American without falling into any of the tired PNW tricks. If I didn't quite know what an American Strong Ale was before, I know now... Recommended."
"I felt as though I could keep drinking this even as the last went down my throat without a second thought. Appropriately medium in body and dry enough to make a sessioner if not for the slightly elevated fuck-you-up factor."
"The hops are just as green fresh and in your face as last year but there's a new twist - a clear, fresh note of sweet pineapple. The overall taste is a bit sweeter than last year but a good balance to the giant hop flavors. Not quite as complex but still very, very tasty."
"Had on tap at the Sunset. Dark amber when served, but I still found some cloudiness to observe. Aroma is of low rich malt topped with some candied hop accents...that's a killer combination. Mouthfeel is medium. It's another 1,2 as tastewise, there's good malt upfront, with the hops along for the finish. Enjoyable and easy to drink, even at that abv."
"For me, Lagunitas has its hits and misses. For this one, it is most definitely a hit. Good stuff."
"This beer looks red, as it should, with a creamy foamy head floating on top. I love red ales for the balance, and this beer is no exception. Great malt profile, sweet and candy coated, along with some spicyness. Great hop profile, lots of sprucy juicy character and some Cascades I would guess. Some Lagunitas beers I've noticed have an odd almost grainy mouthfeel. This one has it, but it's not as pronounced as I remember is some others. Not a big deal really but I thought I'd mention it. All in all this is a great beer and very well balanced."
"Certainly my favorite Lagunitas brew to date."
"Drinkability- Pretty much as listed...a ultra hopped up red ale. Definitely worth a try or two. Can't believe this thing only has 40 IBU's. Very tasty to say the least."
"Drinkability: This beer is definitely a winner. I'd like to see them make it a regular beer, and offer it in six packs. Great stuff, and very drinkable."
"Thanks to fellow SD BA EyeChartBrew for the gratis loan of this one, a pleasant surprise and a mighty nice gesture Sir!"
"Dark gold with a big head , this is a hop paradise in the nose. The body is very refined with a malty backbone to anchor the hop aggression. I thought this was a session beer until I read the abv. LIke most Lagunitas beers this big and beefy with a good balance."
"Deep copper to garnet in color, very clear with a thick cream colored head. I was expecting malt up front in the aromas, but was pleasantly surprised when a pronounced hop flower character came across. This was backed by a grapefruit/citrus note, the bread dough that Lagunitas yeast brings, and finally a caramel character form the malt. The taste has the same hop-forward character. More hop flower and more of an orange peel citrus. I dont catch the yeast quality in the flavor. The malt really balances the hops well in this beer. I enjoy Lagunitas beers when they pour on the hops. I wish their was more of this character in the standard IPA. It has a slightly slick mouth feel, and is very drinkable."
"Clear, deep ruddy bronze hue. Mountainous, dense, whipped fresh cream like head yields dogged, frothy lace. Soft pine and underripe orange upfront in aroma, with secondary hints of dark toffee and sweet biscuit. Incipient in flavor is a snap of medium lovibond caramel sweetness, which is promptly ensued by agreeably sharp, pithlike hop bitterness. Bitterness is aptly complemented by notions of tangerine marmalade, ghostly spruce and mellow strawberry-esque sweetness. Moderate in body, with an agreeably airy and fluid mouthfeel. Finishes with a fleeting resurgence of fruity sweetness akin to fresh squeezed grapefruit and caramel. Quite a tasty brew, with a balanced flavor profile and superb drinkability. Yet another regular in my fridge has been discovered."
"Its clear copper body has a reddish cast beneath its full head of creamy ivory froth. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves sheets of think lace draped about at the outset of the glass. Resinous, grassy, piney/spruce-like, and citrusy hops dominate the nose over a seemingly-sweet and toffe-ish malt. The mouthfeel is medium-full and creamy-smooth across the palate with just a light tingle from its moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. Hops return in the flavor, wrapped in a soft, luscious malt that's seductively sweetish but not quite sweet, decidedly caramel accented, softly bready, and even a touch biscuity. Yeasty fruitiness accents everything, and brings the citrusy hop notes forward, leaving the piney and resinous characteristics to help the firm bitterness balance things by lingering dryly in the finish. There's alot going on, and yet it's incredibly straightforward and balanced leaving it drinkable to say the least; and the alcohol never makes an appearance beyond when you go to get up from your seat and realize you may have had too much of a good thing. Very nicely done!"
"Big, bulbous mushroom cap of head that settles to a crenellated frothing. Crystal clear red hue with some mahogany tints and no action. Fair amount of hop spice on nose, some lemony malt floating around too. To taste, nice red bite, but more so, with a light woody character, almost imperceptible; a thin coating of toasted sesame comes up for air. Pretty good but for something that is jacked up, I prefer their Hairy Eyeball."
"Comments - The label says it best: ""... Red is a color, not a beer; and while the taste buds want what the taste buds want, you still can't taste a color."" This is sort of a merry ""fuck you"" to beer poseurs everywhwere, which makes me laugh. Oh, and the beer more or less kicks ass, too."
"Great drinkability. Another fine limited release from Lagunitas."
"Poured a beautiful deep clear amber, head was perfect and slightly tan in color. Nice malty aroma, a bit bready as well. Sweet caramel malt base with refreshing hoppiness, very balanced. Some tofee notes as well. Neutral in the mouthfeel dept. neither thickish as I expected, or too thin. A nice surprise to find this at my local Whole Foods market. Good drinkable offering from Lagunitas"
"Drinkability  This was a terrific-drinking ale thats as close to a strong session ale as youll find. The balance coupled with the smoothness of the flavors makes you want to gulp this puppy down. Or is it pulp that guppy down? See, Im buzzed already. Great job, Lagunitas!"
"There is an interesting interplay (actually more of war) here between hops which are leaning citrus and a brown sugar/alcohol flavour (this second element being somewhat reminiscent of the same brewery's Brown Shugga). I couldn't call this well balanced and the alcohol certainly isn't well disguised, but it is certainly an interesting brew, and is definitely worth the $2.69 I paid for it."
"Definite session beer for the pros."
"I really dont know what happened to this beer..it has all the ingredients to have been another good Lagunitas beer,but it just fell apart."
