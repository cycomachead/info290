"I just hate this beer. Can't stand the taste at all."

"O: Not as hoppy as I was expecting, but not bad."

"Poured from the bottle into a sniffer. Probably my favorite red ale to date. Not a high ABV but loads of malty flavor makes up for it. Notes of carmel, malty sugar, toffee, and fruitless are tasted. There is crisp slightly bitter aftertaste that balances this beer out excellently. Had this beer after about two years of aging as well as new. Both tasted great with the aged one being more malty as expected. Seriously loved this beer and is highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is an excellent beer. A very pleasant surprise from a previously unknown brewery in a beer style that I typically don't prefer. All the more surprising given all of that. Condor recommended and approved, you gotta check this beer out!"
""
"One of the finer Amber Ales I've had in recent memory."

"Overall: Brewdog have managed to get themselves a reputation for being 'edgy' (or, as some would have it, 'full of shit' - I have no firm feelings either way) but despite this their beers tend to be well regarded. 5am Saint manages to be neither bad nor good, merely ... average; it doesn't do a lot for me, at least out of the bottle. Maybe it's better on tap - hopefully I'll find out when I visit the Brewdog pub in Leeds early next year."

"Drinking this on 11-1-14 but has a best buy date on bottle of  8-4-14.   Tastes slightly stale, but otherwise drinkable and ok.  Sorry my local bottle shops stink with freshness issues on shelves."
""
""
""
""
"Nose of caramelized malts and hops. All return in mouth followed by a brief floral and hopped final."
""
""
""
"Overall – A very good red ale that is very easy going down and has a decent finish. Like all of BrewDog's I have had this one has very heavy pine hops. The hops are nice but to be honest it tends to make all their beers taste very similar"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice freshness and tartness, real zip. Nice smell. Would have liked a bit more heft and for it to have been a little boozier."
""
""
""
"Aroma is the best thing here- floral & a bit exotic. Appearance is average. Flavor on the malty side; body chewy. Overall decent n drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a hazed deep ruddy amber with a light tan head that doesn't last long but leaves a small amount of soapy lacing. The aroma is a mild blend of grain, fruit, and earthy hops. The taste is a little more robust, but follows in suit. The body has a pleasant thickness to it and and a good smooth finish. A tasty red ale."

"Very nice beer. The right amount of Hoppy and Caramel"

"I had this beer at a hotel bar in Sweden on 6/19/14. The best by date was 6/19/14 (perfect timing, right? wrong). Dense, opaque amber appeareneceand a medium-dark head. Head didn't last long. Taste was good for an amber, but not remarkable. An enjoyable beer that was unfortunately past it's prime. I'd recommend trying 5 A.M. Saint if you can find it fresh or on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this strange looking beer that I could not figure out who brewed, Anchor or Brewdog? I guess nobody wants to claim it. The beer poured a dark amber beer with a tan head that lasted all of a minute. The beer is a hop bomb so I did not like it. It also tasted like grass to me. I will not buy again but if you like grassy beer go for it."

"My second experience with what has certainly come to be a favorite brewery of mine. This is a red ale turned up to 11. It manages to be quite hoppy while at the same time keeping a strong malt flavor as well. It pairs excellently with the assortment of meats and cheeses available as part of the tasty pseudo-ploughman's lunch platter available at their Edinburgh location as well as with their punk IPA (I had both on tap that day for the first time and definitely not the last as rumor has it that they are opening several locations on this side of the pond next year). Altogether an excellent beer which I will be regularly buying in bottled form until such time as I can find it on tap again either in Scotland or the States."
""
"Tasty - another satisfying brew from the punk brewers. Looks good, while the aroma and flavour are a showcase for American hops and the malt stays firmly in the back seat. Body is OK but could be a shade thicker. Goes down a treat; would make a great fridge beer to keep around. Worth sampling if you come across it."
""
""
""
"O: Great drinkability. Lovely American Pale Ale style made in Scotland! Hooray for Brewdog"
""
""
"O: For me, the best American amber/red ales deliver an initial separation of bitter hops and sweet malts before presenting something of an integration of flavors on the finish. With this beer, however, once the flavors separate (and they do so immediately) they never come together. This gives the beer a crude, rough feel and makes it seem a bit sloppy, unrefined, and simplistic. Couple this lack of depth, subtlety, and complexity with a thinner than average mouthfeel, and one is left with a beer that is less an American amber/red ale and more of a thin, low-strength IPA. All the aromas and flavors one would expect to find in a beer of this style are here in one form or another, but the package, as a whole, never really comes together."

"Where classic Irish Red Ales might approach this measure of savory caramelization and toast; and where American Ambers might attempt such hoppiness- never have both been captured in the same glass... until now. Great job Brewdog! Great job!"

"Poured this Brew Dog staple from the 330 ml bottle into an English pub glass. I was greeted by a nice brick red hue, just short of brown, with around three fingers of tan head. Features a toasted caramel aroma with some citrus rind and hop spice apparent. Stated plainly, I was impressed by the flavor: Malt-forward but provides a decent flavor hops punch. I get raisin biscuits, faint molasses, and lightly toasted cereals providing the scaffolding, while tangerine rind and flesh, tobacco, floral pollen, black tea, pineapple, and maybe a hint of bramble fruit provide the decorations. Tasty. Smooth body is on the thin side perhaps but does coat the mouth a little, oily with a moderate soft carbonation. The fruity flavor notes develop nicely as the beer warms up. Finishes fairly crisp but does leave a malty echo and some earthy hops. One of the better red/amber ales I've tried in recent memory, clean crystal malt flavors and not cloyingly sweet, with a decent hop spice. I will be back."

"Overall- A nicely balanced american amber ale. For my first crack at Brewdog, this is a pleasant introduction to their offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Drinkable, balanced, different. I really like it. The price may have been a bit steep for an 8 oz pour but I've come to expect that from BrewDog."

"Overall a refreshing and pleasant experience from those Brewdog mad scientists."

"Extraordinarily balanced and never bitter. Very simple yet very tasty and very drinkable."
"Pint Glass / Victoria Gastro Pub, Columbia MD"

"Unclear cranberry color topped with a frothy, bubbly, milky looking head. Aroma is hoppy, yet with a nice malty balance. Pungent pine, citrus, pineapple, berries, stone fruit, and herbs alongside caramel and chocolate malt. Dank, resinous flavor upfront transitioning to some dry, nutty malts. Pine, grapefruit, berries, and a Nelson Sauvin-like fruity oiliness. Very nice malty balance without becoming sticky sweet. Slightly creamy, fairly low carbonation, a little dryness...very easy to drink. Well done! I haven't had much from BrewDog, maybe that needs to change."
"Medium body with dry, earthy hop bitterness up front that lingers over the sweet malt backbone into a dry finish. Aggressively hopped with spicy pine needle, soil-y grass and sticky, resinous oils followed by a very strong malt backbone. Slightly toasty with lots of caramel sweetness, toffee, hazelnut and cocoa. Complex and well balanced with lots of flavor. It's kind of heavy so I don't think I could drink many of them in one sitting but they managed to pack a lot of flavor into a 5% ""session"" beer. I'll most likely be picking up more single bottles of this again, especially in the colder winter months."

"O - I have to say that I’ve yet to try a Scottish beer that has let me down, and this one is not the exception. This is one of those reds that tends towards a pale ale, but isn't quite as bitter, which is what I like about it. Very drinkable and makes for a nice session beer. Would have this one again."
""
"O: Hard to pin down. This is kind of all over the place. Not bad, especially in China, but not my first choice in other settings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good representation of the style, very tasty."
""
"OVERALL : I'm glad I tried this beer. I had a full 24 bottle case ordered on private import and even though I enjoy it very much, I don't think I'd order another case. Don't think I'd have this beer in a bar either, unless it's the most interesting product. After 3-4 bottles spread over a few days, you've pretty much been around this beer through and through. Not the best BrewDog product I've had, though still a pretty good beer, worth trying."

"Another great creation from Scotland from BrewDog, the 5 A.M. Saint."

"M&O: softly carbonated, medium bodied, yet tasting surprisingly light on the palate, this is a balanced, deliciously hoppy and also complex-malty brew very much my choice for a session beer, packing so much good stuff at 5%abv. Recommended (i.e. the beer itself, NOT the manifesto on the beer label…!)."

"Pours a murky dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, citrus zest, and herbal hops. Taste is much the same with malt and earthy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a much better smell over taste in my opinion."

"This seems like an imbalanced Amber ale, on the strange side. Usually an amber ale has a distinct finish- but this beer is unlike others in the style. Too bitter, and lacking other taste and aroma elements usually in an American amber ale."
""
""
""
"Overall: a somewhat disappointing offering from Brewdog. Most of their beers are at least quite interesting - this one doesn't stand up. If the taste followed the nose verbatim, it would have turned out better. Not a bad beer, but not interesting enough to justify the asking price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is hazy, dark, orange-brown with a moderate head that soon reduces to a durable ring. VERY hoppy aroma for style; more like an IPA or APA ... really. The hops remain in the flavor but in a very subdued and mild form. It seems like I’m drinking a different beer than the one I am smelling. Nice. Beer is just a bit shy of medium bodied and has appropriate medium carbonation, lending a crisp feel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter and dry aftertaste. And with a medium body and light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting and different than most amber ales that I have experienced. This one does a good job of delivering heavy hitting (and unique) flavor while maintaining lightness and drinkability."
""
"Pours a cloudy, brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, citrus hops, sweet malt, wet hop, and slight grass. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is very sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of hops, slight grass, slight wet hop, and sweet malt. Overall, decent aroma and blend."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the look. The head was glorious, and even now, at the bottom of the glass, it still remains. This added nicely to a mouthfeel that was otherwise on the watery and weak side. While BrewDog certainly hit what they were going for here, with a no-nonsense red ale, the flavors were a bit muted and seemingly underdeveloped, making us want to reach for something else next."
""
""
"There's been a lot of Brewdog hitting my market recently, guess the distributor is pushing them. This isn't nearly as fresh as the sub-one month old Hardcore I had the other day, but less than 3 months isn't that bad. It pours out a hazy deep red color with a finger of off-white head. The aroma is very nice, it's got earthy hops over a solid caramel malt. On the tongue, this unfolds as an aggressive ale. It comes on strong with citrus hops and sweet caramel malts that have just a touch of a roasty flavor. More pine and earthy hop flavors make themselves known on the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and thirst-quenching. Overall, this is a great ale. It's not a mind-blower, but I'll pick this up next time I see it fresh for sure. Just a solid, aggressive beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this type of red ale really works for me: a good combo of citrusy and earthy hops, and a malt character leaning more towards caramel than towards biscuit. I'd definitely have this again."
"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a rich red-orange amber with a modest head, but lots of lacing. Strong hops with some light fruit aroma. Taste follows, strong hops, but a sweet light fruit start. Finishes bitter with a just short of fresh hop flavor. Well made, but not quite as balanced as some of other red ales. Approaches an IPA hopping. Actually pretty impressive for a 5% ale."

"i do believe this is the best tasting red ale i've ever had. quite complex for the style. to all those who just hate on brewdog because they're a ""gimmick brewery", fuck off already. get off your fucking high horse, brew your own god damn beer, and have it taste this fucking good. i'm sick of hearing people shit talking a craft brewery, just because they're slightly bigger than most other craft brewers, and try different things with their brews. just shut the fuck up, enjoy the beer, and stop looking too into shit. this is how things get ruined, and if this is how you're going to be i'd like you to please find a new fucking hobby. thanks. sorry for the outburst, just had to say it. this is my first beer from brewdog, because i've always been put off by the high price. gave it a shot, and love it. not saying it's worth $14 for a 4-pk, but if you can find a single bottle, it's worth it to try it."
"Bottom Line: You have to try Brew Dog at least once and this is a good place to start."

"On-tap. Pint glass. Notes from dec´11 – many bottles have been emptied later & before then- too. Deep orangish copper in color. Yellowish , copious, creamy head. Nice collars & webs on sides. Caramel malts & intense hoppiness both in aromas & flavors. Yeasty, fresh bread, to the nose too. Hops provide sharp bitterness, strong astringency, lemony hints & resiny oils. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Resins & woody touch on the aftertaste. Refreshing & easy drinkable. Flavorful."

"A pleasant, above average beer, of a style that can be drowned out amongst the shouting hoards of extreme beers that are becoming the norm."
""
"O: Tasty for the style and well hopped."
""
""
"I have tried this one before, but always as a part of a BrewDog tasting. At those times, it was always the least favoured beer. When I now drink it on its own, I still think it is an odd beer with notes of dusty malts and rotten grass."
""
"Not a bad choice for accessibility if you are having a gathering."
""
"Overall: Scottish brewery making a northwest session ale. Count me in. I liked this."
"O: Very drinkable. I really liked the smell of this one. Will definately buy it again if I get the opportunity."
"Pretty decent Scottish interpretation of American amber ale. One issue is the hop and malt disconnect. Seems like two separate tastes entirely and not very integrated. With all the great California amber ales, probably won't buy this again, though I appreciate the effort."
""
""
""
"O: There are lots of hops in this beer, but they are not overpowering in bitterness because they are well balanced by the underlying malts. This is an easy drinking beer that packs in a lot of flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've had much better examples of American Amber Ales. While I wouldn't call this horrible, but I also wouldn't purchase it again. I would recommend you to try it once, though, as it's far from a bad beer."
""
"O - A perfect summertime beer. I will buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yum. A hoppy sessionable red. Wish it wasnt so damn expensive. I would have this all the time."
""
""
"O: Expensive but a far above average beer. Have it at least once and see what you think."
""
"One of the better amber ales I've had. Hits all the marks with flying colors for the style. Yeast is strong but balanced. Excellent malt backbone with a variety of synergized flavors to keep it exciting. I would seek this out for sure."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass. Acceptable head and lacing - pours a deep amber. Aroma is citrus pine hops with soap and meat. Really bold malty citrus hop combination - especially considering this is only 5%. A bit of an odd raw meat flavor in the background. Finish very dry, medium mouthfeel. Overall this is quite good for a European made US style amber in the same hoppy vein as Red Rocket Ale or Hop Head Red."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is like nothing. Very plain."
""
""
""
""
"but for me the jury is pretty much still out."
"O/D - A solid amber ale. Aggressively hopped doesn't always mean good, but this is tasty. I could session this. Calming down on the the hop profile would show off the malt alot more, but it works."
""
"D: this beer was very drinkable and a nice amber if your into the style."
""
""
"overall probably one of the better red ales i've had. i found it followed the style really well and enjoyed it a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Fairly bold flavors for the 5% abv. The bitterness and hop flavor is nicely balanced by the malt though."
""
""
""
""
""
"dark amber with a nice one inch off white head and a good amount of lace. Nice retention on the head as well. Smell was deeply hopped, with a nice pine resin aroma and a hint of light grain. My first impression was a bit light in the carbonation, and a slight slickness or oilyness to it. Big hop profile was very nicely balanced against the malted grain back. Overall this was an easily sessionable and highly enjoyable brew"
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation. A good beer, but nothing special. I probably wouldn't have it again, but it's worth trying once."
"O - A solid sessionable beer."
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt notes with some light floral citrus notes. Taste is a well balanced mix between some light caramel malt notes with some notes of light citrus hops. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not bad but more bland then what I was expecting considering the brewer isn’t the most conventional one."
"Bottle was a gusher. Poured with a nice 2 finger head that subsided in a couple of minutes. The color is a darkish red, that is slightly cloudy. Smells of hops and caramel malts, however not overpowering, I would describe it as ""lightly scented."" The taste is a well balanced hoppy malty flavor characteristic. Has a medium effervescence. The finish is clean with a light hop aroma. Overall a good but not complex example of the amber style. The lowish abv makes this an acceptable session beer as well. While somewhat praiseworthy as an american amber, the price associated with this beer in the states is worth a once off try, but there are better and more inexpensive examples out there."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, nothing spectacular however. I will admit it went pretty nicely with a burger, but when sipped on it's own it's not as great."
"O - A well balanced session beer. Better options around for the same price though."
"Pours a nice amber color with a huuuge head. Took forever for the head to die down. Smell is mediocre, not much there that stands out. The taste is fairly weak, with a bitter, almost sour taste at the end. Dont really know what I think of this beer. I thought I was getting something new and exciting, being the first beer from Brew Dog that i've found here in NM, but it just turned out kind of meh."
"Not a huge fan though"
"O: Not a fan of the huge grass profile of this one. I can get that from the bag on my lawnmower. Not bad flavors, just not for me."
"Seems like somewhere inbetween a pale ale and an amber."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style amber red ale."
"This is a good beer, but I'm probably not completing giving its due just because I was expecting/hoping for something maltier. I probably wouldn't session this one."
"Very solid beer overall. I wasn't sad i ordered this one."
"O - This is definitely one of the better beers I've had from Brewdog I love hoppy reds and this one didn't disappoint pretty damn good beer all around worth getting to try if you see it around"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: The drinkability is quite good and this amber ale is much more like an IPA than it is like other amber ales I’ve had. I am pleased to have tried this one and would be willing to have a second. My overall impression is that this is a reasonably well made beer that demonstrates some of the potential of this brewery."
"Would love to complain or bitch about it, but I enjoyed this beer: I prefer the slightly sweeter, maltier beers to the hoppy bitter ones normally and this slotted into my tastebuds well."
"O - Middle of the pack, I am somewhere between loving and hating this beer."
"O: I didn't really like this beer. The hop character was strange and gave it a misplaced tartness."
"Pours a dark redish orange with amazing head and amazing lacing. Smells hoppy and kind of farmy. Taste is effin awesome, very similar to hopback amber by troegs. This is an AWESOME beer guys. Seek it out and give it a go."
"Overall, this is great fare, and might be a good place for people just getting interested into more hoppier brews to start, as it gives an excellent look at potential, without twisting the tongue into bitter knots. Just don't read the label until *after* you've had a sip, and you might make it through..."
"comes out a nice lighter brown with a twinge of orange in there. big billowy head thats off white sticks majestically and laces all the way down. oily resiny hops seem to await based on the nose of this thing. a grain malt backbone is suggested by the nose. very inviting. crackers and sweet malts give way to a nice hop finish thats not overbearing but has a good umpfh to it. the hop bitterness definitely sticks with the back of your mouth for a good bit after you swallow. carbonation is moderate in this medium bodied brew. this is overall a damn fine hop focused amber ale. glad i picked it up."
"Thanks to Tolann and her friends for sharing beers a month or so back at her basement party. This one poured a medium reddish-amber color with a smallish beige head. Aromas of caramel, sweet malt and light citrus. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of caramel, sweet malt and light citrus."
"A mahogany color with a thin layer of head that dissipated to just a couple puddles rather quickly. Caramel and some tangy roasted malts are a big part of the nose with small amounts of fruity citrus. Flavor is bready and just like the nose contains a lot of the caramel and toasted malts. Hops play a bigger roll than in the nose. A big punch at the end of fruity citrus, almost like a well balanced IPA. Body is creamy and malty with a subtle metallic and citrus bitter finish."
"O: I have sampled relatively few amber ales since beer geekery took me in its wicked clutches a few years ago. 5 AM Saint rates well in drinkability as it is a low abv beer that offers quite a bit of interest. Based on this experience I'm going to pursue the style more methodically in the near future. "
"O: A very good beer. The contrast between the hops and malts seemed almost perfect."
"O: A very interesting American Amber/Red Ale where the yeast really stands out and makes the whole difference."
"Overall I think I set my expectations a little too high but in the end I have no problem drinking this beer and actually enjoy the flavor and aroma. This is a pretty hard beer to rate, ambers and reds should be well balanced and this was not, if it was an IPA that wouldn't be a problem and if I didn't know this was a Red Ale I would have been pretty sure I was drinking an IPA. I thought the flavor and aroma were pretty nice but this beer was too over carbonated, at first I thought it might be infected since just about every gusher I have had was infected, but this one wasn't, it just had way too much carbonation. Drinkability wasn't that great either, it was too hoppy and bitter for me to have more then one. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was just to expensive for what I got, if I wanted a beer that was like this one I would rather grab Lagunitas Lucky 13, it is better beer at a better price. I can't say I would recommend this to people looking for a good Amber Ale, it just doesn't do a good job at representing what that style is all about, but if hop heavy brews are your thing you might like it. This wasn't the best first impression with BrewDog, but I admire the fact that they don't care what people think and just do what they want, so I would like to try more of their brews but if the price point is similar to this beer it might be a while before I get to trying them."
"Overall - OK... hmmm, a bit 'move along, nothing to see here' kind of thing... nice to see on tap, tho"
"O: Not my first choice for an ale but I was pleasantly surprised. I would drink again for sure."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable; remarkable smell. I could have a few of those…"
"O - Id like to try this again, because I honestly don't quite know how I feel about this."
"Hmmm... Nice beer. Especially the Nice hoppy nose. Lots of citrus and herbs. It's a lovely amber colour in the glass as well. The taste is nice and dry, but a bit metallic and llacking in concentration. The mouthfeel is also a bit thin. Overall a good beer with a nice refreshing hoppiness. Great served nice and cold."
"Don't drink and review."
"This beer poured out as a good looking amber color with a pretty good head on top. The lacing was there but nothing too sticky. The smell of the beer had a nice caramel sweetness on the nose and just a bit of hops in there too, The taste was mostly on the malty side with just a bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel had some good drinkablity to it. I found this beer to be a good one for a social event or something like that. Straight forward brew worthy of a try."
"I liked the colour of beer, much darker than the light amber I was expecting, it has a very pleasant fragrant smell, reminded me of jasmine, malts and honey. The head on the beer was solid, a good 3/4inch. So far so good. The taste was quite a shock, very clear, very metallic with and with a strong alcohol note throughout. Years ago in my school days a teacher once made the class taste ethanol (100% alcohol) for some reason. Those memories came flooding back. The character of the beer is all back lost in the metal and alcohol. I did not find it smooth particularly, more like licking a smooth metal pole. Overall I was disappointed."
"Overall a really good beer. Easy drinking and enjoyable."
"Overall- You can love ‘em or hate ‘em, but Brewdog had made a very solid amber ale here. Good balance throughout, and you could drink a few of them without getting sick of it or too drunk."
"DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"D: Very drinkable, nice overall flavor, and feel to it."
"Plenty of yeast in this beer. Again, the malt-hop blend is superior. Reminds me of a great homebrew. Rich body and high carbonation. The aftertaste is mostly yeast flavor with a touch of hop bitterness."
"O: A good amber ale, I've had it before and remember it being a bit better, but this bottle is certainly not bad."
"The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than full-bodied, but certainly more there than a northeast nut-brown, with none of that style's cloying sweetness. Certainly a successful beer, and the cost comes from trans-Atlantic travel and a miserable currency exchange rate."
"Not bad. Poured from the bottle, brown and clear. Nice thick, distinctive, white head. Smell was on the hoppy side but not too strong. Taste was surprisingly bitter for an amber ale. Mouthfeel was light to medium, and drinkability was sub-moderate considering the surprising bitterness/metallic nature of the beer, as ambers are typically much smoother."
"Sort of an amber IPA, and worthy of washing down a well-spiced meal like pepperoni pizza with crushed red peppers."
"Overall a very solid beer. I would buy it all the time but at $9 something a 4 pack it's not worth it for just an amber. Anvers are super cheap to make."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"A tiny bit too much soap, but really a good solid amber."
"Opinion: I must say that this is one of the better examples of this style that I have tried. I like the balance. The hops are a big player here, but they don't completely run the show. It is an American style beer, no doubt. I would recommend that you try this beer, especially if you lean more toward hoppy styles. That said, I don't know how much I will be going back to this one as I lean more toward the maltier side of things."
"D: An enjoyable session beer."
"Pours a hazy copper to orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, gingerbread like malt and a hint of caramel. In the taste, gingerbread and caramel like maltiness and a nice small hop. A small hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry caramel aftertaste. Nice small presence of caramel in a red ale."
"D. Can Brewdog create any beer that does not taste like their other beers? 5.A.M. All their beers taste the same to me."
"This was an overall decent take on an Amber Ale from Brewdog. Like I said, the hop flavors here seemed to clash a bit with the roasted stickiness of the malts but that easygoing body helped keep this one drinking pretty good the whole way through the glass. Nothing offensive here but there are some better examples of the style out on the shelves."
"Overall - Sessionable guilt-free beer that will not pull you down for the night!"
"D - A very drinkable beer. It went well with beef roast. It can stand on its own, I'm sure."
"D - Well, this is something new. The hop aroma is that of a much bigger beer; not surprising considering the brewery. What is surprising is how light and restrained the flavor is. It is kind of like a magic trick; it smells like a high abv west coast red ale and it tastes like the restrained, 5% amber that it is. Some of the grapefruit hop character comes back in the aftertaste, but it is only a shadow of what is present in the aroma. This bait and switch of hop character is somewhat jarring at first, but it actually works in a way because it allows the drinker to enjoy some intense, juicy hop aromas (with appropriate levels of malt to back them up) while leaving the flavor and alcoholic impact of a beer with sessionable alcohol content (by American standards, at least). In the end, this actually works pretty well for me, I can honestly say I could drink a few of these, and I wouldn't even feel that bad about it the next day!"
"Mouthfeel is a bit high in carbonation for my taste, even if they are prickly tiny bubbles. On the other hand it is very drinkable, even with the 5% abv."
"This unique variation on the Amber ale is super drinkable and endlessly complex. This may be the best effort in Brewdog's catalog."
"5 A.M Saint packs a wallup for being just a 5%ABV ale...loads of a flavor and smells. I hope to run across this again soon."
"D: A really tasty moderate alcohol amber ale. Blows something like James Squire's Amber Ale off the planet. 4"
"Pours a very burnt orange copper color with a thick yellowish white head and a ton of silky lacing. Smells of grapefruit/citrus hops with a ton of pine notes. Tastes of piny hops, toasted bread, caramel malts, with some grapefruit notes. Mouthfeel is medium with a thick carbonation. Drinkability is medium."
"D - Very drinkable beer either on its own, or at 5% ABV, for a session beer."
"D - the flavours are strong and sharp, but it goes down easy, and I always enjoy a strong hop infusion in an ale, generally impressed"
"this 4pack wont last long and at 12$ its not overly expensive and worth picking up"
"Pours a dark cloudy amber with a nice tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, and other sweet spices. Taste is sweet caramel malt with some good amount of hops, some light fruitiness. Palate is nice medium body, with very good carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt followed by some hints of corriander and slight citrus notes and a good amount of bitter hops to add balance. Overall a very nicely balanced and drinkable amber ale."
"D - Tasty and much better than I had expected. Definitely a hopped up amber ale, making for a delicious ale and one to be appreciated by any hop fan."
"D: Served too warm unfortunately but still went down well. Even had a 2nd."
"Could definitely sink a number of these in an evening. I'm a fan of strong tasting beer and this is a big hit."
"Everytime I have this I love it more than the last."
"Pretty easy drinking, nice to change things up, but I'm still not crazy about it."
"11.2 oz bottle with a Best Before Date of 19-04-11. Pours a super-carbonated dark amber color with a huge head. Good amount of lacing. Big aroma of citrus hops. Some malt and sweetness as well. Taste is slightly bitter with a nice bite of hops to it. Somewhat sweet and bready. Good amount of hop flavor for a beer that has a ABV of only 5%. This is a really solid hoppy Red Ale and worth seeking out."
"From a bottle with a 'Bastard-esque' label, this beer is a very pale, golden-amber color. The head is brilliantly white. Very citric, pine-like, and herbal aroma. All hops. The taste is more balanced. Respectable amounts of palt counter the hops, along with a soft and flowery fresh hop flavor. Some subtle fruit notes. Clean, with a firm bitterness. Satisfying and firm body, medium in heft, but still substantial. Lingering finish with lots of hop flavor."
"D- again, its fine. Totally drinkable amber, though not nearly the best I've had"
"Poured a copperish auburn brown w/ one-finger head that left patches on top of a decently balanced but bland citric hop and caramel/bready malt aroma. A citric and bitter hoppy bite in a lighter body that has a dry edge thanks to a husky and chewey breadiness derived from chunk of malts. A mild caramel sweetness is prevelant as well and overall I'd say this beer is balanced. A good beer but a couple of minor setbacks as I found it to be a little slick and watery and the malts give off a buttery edge and then a real crisp, apple or pear like and dry finish (one could even say tart as the carbonation makes itself felt on the backend)."
"Drinkability: A below average amber ale. I would like a bit more sweet malt balance to this beer. Not horrible, but nothing I would pick up again."
"Cheers!"
"Not a bad beer, but nothing to go out of your way to try."
"Still, not unbalanced, even if maybe a bit boring on the long distance."
"Yeah, fairly tasty beer. Good hoppy finish makes for challenging, but rewarding drinking."
"It'd be a good brew if the taste was half as good as the smell. Very disappointing."
"D: Pleasant brew and a well made red ale."
"Decent, and reminiscent of the great west coast styles, although oddly skewed in a way that makes it both more interesting and less enjoyable. Very drinkable though, and I liked it well enough."
"Aftertaste seems odd to me and the whole thing seems off-style (which should be expected from the name). Overall, it is an enjoyable beverage. Not quite my mug of beer for long term drinking though."
"Great nose and look that screams hops but the taste is not really that hoppy and has a soft finish that is in contrast to the huge nose. Very drinkable but not really a balanced beer and not really fitting the style. More like an IPA that has a easy finish"
"Overall, a good effort at a more subtle beer, and worth a try."
"I noticed that the reviews are all over the place - some, like me, really enjoy the uniqueness of the ale, while others are not so impressed. It is a very complex ale with a low ABV."
"Tasty, but pricey. Not your typical Amber ale, but a nice and unique beer. Would get again for a special occasion."
"My First BrewDog and I'll be back for more."
"This brew has a loud bark, but not much of a bite -of course I'm referring to smell and taste. 5am is very interesting and flavorful."
"Drinkability - I liked smelling this enough before each sip to finish the bottle but this is a clumsy, confusing beer that I won't buy again."
"A phenomenal amber. All the press goes to the bigger brews, but I honestly think this may be Brewdog's best!"
"D: Too much hops, not enough of anything else. Too lopsided to be very drinkable, at least for me. A good beer, I guess, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"I poured this from an 11.2 ounce into a belgian styled goblet.This is my first brewdog and its pretty much what I expected hoppy with a nice bite but not overwhelming. It definitely has a pine smell but I mostly pick up on the hops. This is a beer I would drink often but not alot of in one sitting . Its not very high in alcohol which surprised me. The color of the beer is great its a deep brown with hints of gold and amber thus the name. This will not be my last brewdog, Im not a huge fan of ipa but I look forward to trying theirs and seeing if they change my mind."
"A 5% beer with such an attractive personality should be cheaper and absolutely everywhere. I dig the 5 A.M. Saint and would love to have this on hand regularly (not sure why it's called 5 A.M. Saint--perhaps they could have fit an explanation into all that label text?)."
"D: a hoppy and flavourful amber ale. Not as complex as the top examples of the style, but highly drinkable nonetheless. My second favourite beer of the night."
"Pours a reddish-amber with some copper highlights. Nice tan head and a good amount of lacing as it goes down. Smells immediately of hops; definitely some pine and resin. Taste is quite a bit maltier with some dry amber malt going throughout. Mouthfeel is light to medium--definitely toward the hoppy-amber end of the spectrum. Drinkability is nice. Flavorful but not at all overpowering."
"Drinkability: This is an ambitious amber ale, but its biggest failing is the dry, contrasting mouthfeel of the finish."
"Overall it was a nice beer. It seemed a little flat, maybe somewhat watery, I prefer Nugget Nectar in this category, but this is more easily attainable around here. Also, 3.99 for a 12oz was a little high. I would rather have hardcore or punk ipa...still worth picking up though."
"D - Aside from the dryness, this is very drinkable and really delicious. I have yet to be disappointed by Brewdog and their creations!"
" Notes: I can drink it, but see my drinkability notes. It's almost like a brand new homebrewers first try (we've all been there) where you just throw more hops into the ketlle and think everything's ok."
"D: A good beer that I would revisit from time to time. Amber ales tend to be more drinkable than the 5 A.M. Saint has managed to be. So I can appreciate BrewDog's creative take on the style, just not for long term imbibing."
"D: Good to try, but nothing exceptional here."
"The flavor doesn't really go where the aroma suggested it would. Not at all, really. Malts taste hollow and grainy, with toasted bread crust, mineral, and graham cracker. The hops are stale and supply little in the way of flavor, but do contribute a grassy, floral bitterness to the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is solid, though...good body and carbonation. I really had my hopes up for this one. But there's just such an abrupt and ultimately off-putting discord between the aroma and flavor of 5A.M. Saint. Well, at least BrewDog is consistent in their disappointment...maybe their stuff tastes better fresh in the UK, but I've yet to find a single beer they produce solo (thus excluding Bashah) that's enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not being a fan of ambers, I was glad that this is nothing like any amber I have encountered before; don't let the style put you off - this is well worth seeking out"
"I really wouldn't class it an amber despite the bottle's claims. Too bitter for that. But it is definitely a lone wolf."
"Overall, go look for it, find it, trade for it.... Truly and exceptional amber ale. Well worth the $3.59 I paid for it, and I look forward to having it again!"
"Poured into a small sampling glass this brew has a light amber color that was thin with a finger head that settled to a nice cap. The aroma is full of wet grass and light citrus. The taste is very watered down and has pour quality hops. This brew seems to be off style and a little off in general. A lot of good brewdog beer and this was abnormal. Will need to edit review if I have a chance to try again some time."
" ~ This beer is okay. One is good enough for me and I would not likely recommend this beer."
"With a nice balanced ABV of 5% I think that I could drink this all day long. It may not be for some people, but if I could get my hands on this more often I'd drink it regularly. I'd compare this highly to some of the best American Ambers I've tried."
"The mouthfeel is full, foamy, and clean, just as it should be. In fact, this beer is pretty just as it should be across the board - an excellent entry to an old favorite style."
"This is a bitter amber ale, good but not in my flavor range of perfection for this style. Drinks more like an IPA in my opinion."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Bright, clear, copper pour with Big fluffy caramel-colored head and great lacing. Buscuity, malty nose with burnt sugar, caramel, nuts and a subtle citrus, hoppiness. Lots of roasty, malty caramel and maple in the taste with hints of butterscotch and tea and a nice bitter bite on the finish. Definitely gets better and more complex as it warms. Nice subtle resiny mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess also. At first I thought it was very drinkable for a higher alcohol beer, then I saw that it was only 5%. Still drinkable, but the alcohol was always there for such a mild beer. A bit too pricey to have all that often."
"Not exactly my cup of tea, but there's no denying that this is a well made, well crafted beer from Brewdog."
"A good solid offering from Brewdog. I gotta get this one more often."
"It looks like the boys at BrewDog have designated 5 A.M. Saint 'iconoclastic amber ale' as one of their core offerings and have dedicated themselves to making it available in all of their markets all the time. Bully for them because this is good beer that is impressively drinkable."
"Drinkability -- Somehow I was expecting this to have more malt sweetness, but for a dry red ale, it's pretty solid. Might not be a bad idea if you're desperate for a Furious fix!"
"This one poured a cloudy medium amber with a creme colored head. Well carbonated. The smell was very malty and slightly hoppy. Slight sweetness. The taste was overly malty with a little hoppiness on the backend. The flavor wasn't anything too special. It was very fresh and crisp, well carbonated. It's not great, not even special so it's a little pricey for the product. Is just moderately drinkable."
"Favourite Brewdog so far. Murky red, light head that was gone all too soon. But wow, smells great. The hops are quite easy to identify- nelson, cascade, showcasing them nicely. The malt is playing a bit of a backseat but it's there and supporting well. Low in bitterness and pleasantly smooth. This is a really good red ale and I'm glad to see a well structured, balanced, fault-free, approachable beer from these guys. And they didn't even have to stick it in a squirrel to get my attention."
"But that monster nose lead me on - I was hoping for something that could tangle with Red Rocket, so in that respect, disappointing."
"Interesting, and quite tasty - good drinkability overall. Definitely would recommend this!"
"Overall, a fairly drinkable beer for those of you into bitter beers."
"nice a hoppy red with a rather woody amber color. dark... big and sticky head. quite a fresh hop quality and a good malt to carry it out... quite a fresh pine on the palate too. centennial hoppy grapefruit but not excessively so. at five percent i would like to see this one after a year of sitting someplace dark and cool."
"I love this beer. I love this beer. An amber ale that walks on the side of an APA? Great"
"This beer is somewhat of the antithesis of BrewDog Tokyo*. Instead of being a hot mess, it's restrained, balanced, and well-crafted. Drinkability is good. I approve."
"Drinkability is very good. Excellent amber ale. Would definitely pick this one up in a six-pack."
"Bottle, 5% ABV, RBNAG 2009 in Vatlandsvåg. Orange to amber colour, moderate head. Intense and lovely aroma of American hops (Amarillo?* nope, actually: Simcoe, Chinook, Nelson Sauvin, Centennial), notes of peaches, apricots and tropical fruits. The flavour is somewhat less impressive than the aroma, but still good. Notes of peaches, but quite dry. Decent hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin though."
"This is a good looking beer. It's a deep, translucent amber with a foamy, ecru head. Lots of lacing. I'm a fan of the BrewDog labels, too, so that's a nice a bonus. This is a nicely hoppy beer with good British malt flavor. The aroma from the hops is floral, pine and citric, in that order, while the malt contributes lots of biscuity, doughy caramel goodness. The malt aroma holds its own against the hops with a luxurious depth, differentiating the beer from most American ambers and such. This is a hoppy ESB. The flavor is rich and full. There's a lot of good British beer flavor. It's not quite as bursting at the seams of its size but close. Mouthfeel is a tad slick. The aftertaste is hoppy and bitter. It's a very good beer, easily one of my favorites from BrewDog."
"I bought this beer in a Mix-a-six, as part of a very small selection of beers that I had not yet sampled at my local beer barn. The label says ""iconoclastic amber ale, Product of Scotland," which intrigued me. As soon as I popped this bitch open, I was overwhelmed with the smell of hops. As primarily a darker beer kinda guy, I wasn't too sure I was gonna enjoy this brew. After one sip, my first thought was ""this tastes like a weak IPA."" I, for one, am not a fan of IPAs. But the more I sit here and sip this beverage, the more I can appreciate the smoothness. It's a drinkable beer by my taste buds, but it was a random purchase that I probably won't make again. This is not to say this is bad beer...I could see some folks really enjoying this beer. It's just not for me."
"i'm going to go out on a limb here and say that this may be the best beer i've ever had from BrewDog. nonic of course here. dark amber with an eggshell head that holds forever and leaves really pretty lace. woah, nose!! it seems like recently the ""true"" american amber/red style of beer has been revived a bit, and these hop-forward cara-crystal laden beers are being produced again, but this time with really high quality ingredients. great nose. well defined and well-balanced hop/malt character that follows through to the taste. i mean, this style is supposed to be hop forward like a hoppy pale ale or ipa, but the malt should be crystal and definitely stand out more than the typical apa or ipa if im not mistaken, so it seems like it's pretty much balanced like it's style guidelines suggest, which is cool to see brew dog do. basically, soft caramel, a touch of slightly chocolatey roast and a west coast hop flavor full of pine, citrus and tropical fruits rule this beer. medium body, medium carbonation, nice bitter finish. pretty straight forward here. price tag hurts a bit, but the deliciousness and low abv render it pretty damn schwillable. can't wait to try this on tap/cask. i guess this is nothing special if you don't like hoppy beers that have an interesting/super-tasty malt backbone, pair well with spicy food and have a low enough abv to still drink a few after you've had one..."
"I'll admit it: I have no idea what this brew's name means. Irregardless (remember, that word is spoken with a semi-Bostonian accent), it pours a clear amber-copper topped by a half-finger of light tan foam. The smell is of pine, citrus, peach, and caramel apple, complete with plenty o' nuts. The pine and citrus (mainly the peel in this case) run strong in the taste, with greenery, flowers, and a very light bit o' toffee. For me, a bit unbalanced in favor of the hoppier bits. The body is a light medium, making it a bit heavier than it oughta be; the moderately active carbonation and dry finish (combined with an aftertaste of orange peel) round out a feel that does not bring much of a smile to my lips. Still, the finished product is not all that objectionable...just not entirely desirable. Translation: Good for a drink, but not something to be sought out by any stretch of the imagination."
"I like a hopped up amber as much as a good IPA and Brewdog did well for themselves here.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear rich amber/bronze with a fluffy one finger slight off white head that clung to the glass leaving broken blotches of lace behind as it settles slowly.A mix of caramel,and chocolate malt aromas mixed with a hefty dose of citric hop,very left coast old school amber ale to me.Flavors have the standard caramel malt flavors upfront but a nice shot of citri hop and some earthiness in the finish.I have had mixed feelings about the Brewdog stuff I have had,but this is a very good amber,I love the hop flavored burps!"
"Beer is medium bodied and kind of apple-y. Earthy, sulfury finish with a clean back palate with some moderate bitterness. No aftertaste, does not finish dry. Overall pretty enjoyable."
"D - Drinks like a blend of an IPA and an Amber, maybe better yet an Imperial Amber (it that is possible). Ideal to drink 2 , 1 just isn't enough for the pallet, it needs the 2nd to truly invigorate the senses."
"D: A real malt bomb but still manages to go down nicely for fans of big ambers. I could easily go for 2-3 of these. A solid example that was very good."
"A tasty, amber ale with lots going on. Enough here to make me drink more than one."
"Drinkability: Quite good with a meal (Welsh Rabbit in this case) and I could have one alone, but it's one alone. The bitterness and hoppiness of this brew is more than I want in an amber ale - a bit more malt balance and I would be very happy with this one. Still - good overall."
"Overall, I'm recalling something like Troeg's HopBack Amber as a comparable, maybe slightly more complex brew. I enjoyed this beer, but given that it will generally be a bit pricier (as an import), I don't think it justifies the price. Comparable domestic ambers will do just as good, if not better."
"11.2 ounce bottle, Batch 483, best before January 19, 2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head. The bottle was a bit of a gusher when I opened it, but it didn't take long to settle down and make a decent pour. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is nice and hoppy, the brew smells mostly like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with a bit of caramel malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the citrusy hops come out stronger in the taste compared to the other flavors. There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, this is quite a sessionable brew! This is a good overall brew, it's one of the best amber ales I've had in a while."
"The beer pours a reddish-brown color with a khaki head. The aroma is toffee and bready malt with some orange hops. There is also some chocolate malt and pine hop notes in the aroma. The flavor is heavy on the toffee and caramel malts with pine added in. The chocolate malts are faint but are present in the flavor as well. Very little hop bitterness but a good amount of hop flavor. Thin-medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation."
"Deep mahogany brown crimson amber hue with a huge flowing three finger sized head rising well above the rim of my glass. Nice chunky lacing clings to my tulip glass after the head settles down. Aromatics are piney and citrus alot of C hops going on here, American style amber for sure. Semi sweet caramel malt backings to go with the hop profile. Flavor has a nice acidic citrus tone with hints of tobacco/tea leaf/and earthy bitterness going on. Subtle caramel malt sweetness balances things quite nicely warming especially for only 5% abv. Mouthfeel is sharp with some upfront bitterness but mellows out in the finish, carbonation is sturdy and even body fills out somewhere in the middle. Drinkability overall is very nice, a beer that's expressive balanced and tasty with a reasonable alcohol content, now if we could work on pricing a bit. 3.19 a bottle isn't bad, but if were to buy a case I don't know if this beer would warrent that."
"A wonderful little beer. A nice warm amber colour with a good head that leaves a lot of nice lacing on the glass. A slightly grassy nose, good carbonation and a more subtle hop profile than you might normally expect from Brewdog's more extreme beers. I could drink a lot OF these in an evening- wish I'd bought more!"
"Overall a good beer, great looking, but nothing exceptional in terms of taste. Check it out if you find it for a good price."
"quite a sipper for a 5% beer. very strong flavors keep this from going down as smooth as your typical amber, but that is welcomed."
"for sure a brew that I will keep stocked when ever I can!"
"the nice hop kick of a NN, but still a nice Amber. Good bitter hops, with a nice malt finish. A great session beer at only 5%. Which makes this worth the price."
"There have been a few beers of late venturing into the realm of Amber IPA; NN, Lucky 13 and Stone 13 to name a few. Reminds me of the newfound 'Black IPA' beers that are popping up all over. This one falls into the same categorization as those while still managing to be unique tasting. Toasty malts give way to a big grassy hop flavor and a long, lingering bitterness on the finish. Im glad the ABV is kept low, keeps it drinkable and allows more of the hoppy goodness to shine through. Touch of sourness that, strangely enough, compliments the hops quite nicely. After shelling out the cash for this one, I found this plenty good enough to go try a couple more of B-dawgs offerings. This one is definitely worth giving a try."
"D - A 5% Hoppy Amber/Red Ale. Now that's my idea of a session."
"Pretty drinkable. The smell made promises that the taste couldn't keep."
"D-- Very drinkable. Hops really carry the beer and is well balanced by the right amount of sweetness in this. Not over done one way or another. Really nice example of the better US Amber Ales that are out there. The 5% makes this very drinkable and could have 2-3 of these easily. First Brewdog beer I have liked so far."
"Carbonation is on the high side in my opinion, apart from that this was great."
"This brew pours a nice deep mahogany hue with average carbonation that leaves a one finger head and sticky sporadic lacing,the aroma is beautiful tropical fruit punch with hints of melon,pineapple and passionfruit very enticing indeed,it has an easy light mouthfeel to it with the aromas of tropical fruits coming thru on taste and it finishes with a nice bitter kick but not overly bitter and very moreish,to be honest i could smell and drink this all day probably one of the best brewdog brew's i have sampled so far."
"Here's a BrewDog beer worth looking for that won't break the bank. Very American in character, and a delight to the taste buds. Recommended."
"Amber almost rust colored. The beer pours with a nice full head that sticks around for awhile. The smell was hoppier then I expected, with grapefruit aromas dominating and a little hint of red berries in the background. The flavor has grapefruit and pine with a decent amount of malt to balance it out. This beer reminds me a little of Stone's levitation. A great session beer."
"Color is a dark amber/mahogany. A creamy, beige head that lingers. Aroma is assertive and hoppy with a little bit of oak and grapefruit. Taste is complex. Some red-ale rye(?) flavor with a balanced and bitter hop kick at the end. Mouthfeel is nice. Well carbonated and not too much alcohol. Very drinkable. Refreshing, crisp with considerable depth. This is a winner. I hope it sticks around. I like this beer a lot. It's an interesting hybrid style and is just plain good."
"This beer goes down easy, and was fairly enjoyable and easy to drink."
"I say grab one and try it."
"Bottle obtained from the brewery. Pours mahogoney coloured body with generous bubbly head bubble. Some lace in glass. Medium moutheel. Taste is very much like a harvest ipa.Good session beer, though nothing exceptional.Grapefruit, pine, strawberry.Piney arom."
"EDIT -- only for Beer Spy"
" Tasty, snappy,juicy and delicious, this beer rivals any IPA that I have had, and, if not for the rather high price, would definitely be my go-to session beer at ""only"" 5.0 ABV. Truly a ""must-try"" for all hop-heads. Get Some!!"
"This is made with Simcoe, Chinook, Nelson Sauvin and Centennial hops. This poured a bright copper red with a good, thick head. On the nose you get tons of passionfruit, pineapple and grapefruit pineyness. It tasted incredibly smooth with some light bitterness, a ton of pine and citrus. It was very forestry tasting- in a good way. It was a good beer to start off the tasting with."
"freaking solid on CASK, one of my all time favourite British beers...one of brewdogs best."
"A front-loaded PACNW-friendly dose of hops, but one which unfortunately peters out towards the end. Overall, another confusing, if still quite tasty ale from this wannabe sexy brewery. The funny thing is, I'll be up until around 5 a.m. tomorrow morning (by design!) for a software implementation at work - would that I could enjoy a few of these during that time, for their 'iconoclastic' support, at the very least."
"It pours as a quite dark amber colour with a small creamy off-white head and lots of carbonation. The aroma is laced with the unmistakable scent of North American hops, pine, lots of citrus and fruit (grapefruit, apricot, oranges). There is lots of grapefruit and hops, alongside a caramel malty backbone. Lots of carbonation in the palete, with a clean and fresh feel. A decent beer, and a good addition to their range. Will definitely be getting some more of this"
