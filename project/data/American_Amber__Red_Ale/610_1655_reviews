"Overall - A spot on red. Nice balance from the hops and malts. Worth a go if you stumble across this one."

"Overall - fantastic mix between a Scotch and a red"
"This pours a dark amber color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is sweet and malty. The flavor is complex with lots of bitterness to compliment the malty aroma. Bold, flavorful, and interesting."
"Little different flavor than most scotch ales. Great color and firm head"
"3.74/5: Definitely not some dime-a-dozen, middle-of-the-road red ale; deserves its status as a classic"
""
"Rich maltiness of toffee, caramel, and raisin. Some fruity hop and a mild bitterness."
""
""
"Be really interested to try this a little fresher.  Was initially mildly disappointed in the beer, but I appreciated it a bit more as I analyzed it.  As usual, this analysis allowed the beer to warm a bit, which brought out the flavors a bit more.  Definitely a re-try, could see 1 half a tick to a tick higher."
""
""
""
"Good. The initial flavor is bitter and by the 3rd or 4th sip you grow accustomed to it. As red ales go its solid but its not my favorite"
""
""
"Bottle poured into pint glass.  Left a half inch creme colored head. Smells very sweet, but still has a bitter aroma to it.  It is a very distinct taste to it.  Very malty notes upfront, revealing a caramel and burnt sugar flavor that is quickly followed with a dash of hops and a slight alcohol taste and sensation.  Absolutely fantastic beer.  Real hearty and tasty."

"The malt flavor of this beer is awesome, lip smacking good and tasty.  But it gets overwhelmed by the bitter.  What would have been an extremely high beer fell down under 4 because the bitter was to much, took away from the tasty.  If you are a hop head, this one should be right in your wheel house."

"O: Very nice beer. Very complex and very well balanced. Leans a slight bit to the bitter side but barely. Multiple layers of flavor play across the palate as you drink this beer. I like the subtle drying finish. This is a beer I would recommend to someone who likes hop flavor but not the bitter bite of an IPA. It is one of the best examples of the style I've had, without a doubt."
""
""
""
"O: Given the bottle description and name I was expecting a little milder maltier brew. That being said, I'm not a bit disappointed. This is right in my wheelhouse. Love it!"

"On-tap at Tizley's in Poulsbo, WA. Poured into a pint pilsner. Clear deep red-brown color, nice one-finger head, then moderate lacing. Aroma is deep and inviting--malt, caramel, fruity, with mild floral hops. Flavor starts with malt and caramel, some toffee, nicely balanced, with moderate citrus hops finish. Mouthfeel is medium thin. Overall this is a really outstanding red ale, I really like it!"

"A great beer and one of my top 20 probably. Pours a beautiful brownish-red color with good bubbles and a decent head. Aroma is malty with a touch of citrus. Flavor has some pine, malt and a touch of citrus. I wanted more hop flavor but thats ok. This beer is full flavored"

"O- One of my favorite red ales and probably my favorite Bear Republic beer to be completely honest (I have not had Apex)."

"Taste was just like the smell, juicy and piney hops with a powerful malt backbone, was simply delicious and very drinkable. Had another one it was so good and could easily put a few of these back."
""
""
"A moderately hopped up and smoke Red Ale. I'm sure the freshness is hindering my opinion (11-16-13, seven months past bottling) , but it's just okay."
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: I echo some of the other reviews, nothing in my review would indicate that this is a special beer, but damn it was good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweetish taste, with some sour notes here and there. No hop note of course. Kind of feels like  a not so strong arrogant bastard. Not unplesant tasting at all. I've had it in the past and enjoyed, but emmory does not serve me well in this beer's case."
""
""
"O - Some may say this is more of a red IPA than an amber/red but to me THIS is what I want a red ale to taste like. So much tastier and more interesting than most. My favorite of the style so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I wanted to expand my experience to red ales so I checked BA and this one had a good rating so I bought it. This is a great full bodied Ale that could easily become a favorite. It has just enough hoppyness and not to much, the finish is very smooth. The enjoyment is increased if you get your nose in it as you drink. What a great beer to share with friends that have never heard of it!"

"O: good beer solid effort. But smell hides it true colors of essentially an IPA or APA . Scottish style is a little of a stretch. So it is good but not actually the style listed, if that is a fault. Of course on the label it says it breaks "" all style molds"". Agree. So to be a red IPA."

"It's a lucky almost-Oriental red that meets your eye. Only a little lacy, smooth. Smells like teen spirit, I think. Tasty: Herbaceous -- nearly grassy, yet not that, and good for the balance maintained on that line. Bitterness of hops with a sweet finish. Bright, brilliant, like an herb that's good for you and is also yummy. This is my favorite, I can live with this one. Even if it has to be ""living in sin."" I know you understand."
""
""
"Excellent beer, tasty and bold, definitely not shy on hops, malty and spiced. It felt to me as a mix of and American Red Ale and a Scottish Ale, especially as it warms up with a climbing complexity. Another great offering from BR."
"O: I'd recommend giving this a try, though I wouldn't say it's one of their better beers. It's not super interesting."
""
"This one pours a very dark mahogany color with a small tan head that gives way to a very slight lacing. The aroma is very roasty malty. There are some notes of hops but mostly sweet roasted malt. The flavor is deep n balanced. Very smooth and enjoyable. There is alot of malt but it is offset by some very nice hops. This is quite a smooth beer. Maybe even sessionable."

"I admire Bear Republic for never resting on their laurels and for consistently creating new and exciting offerings, but I was really blown away by this commonly available (almost) session ale. Red Rocket is a super drinkable and fantastically well crafted West Coast version of an American amber ale, but done with a Scotch ale twist. Impressive, to say the least."
""
"Overall - It is a pretty good beer, hoppy and sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber colored with a small head (strangely large bubbles as well). Smell is strong with caramel maltiness with hops and maybe some grapefruit. Medium to heavy body with moderate carbonation. The taste is more hoppy up front than I expected but the caramel malt rushes in soon thereafter while the aftertaste is equally sour malt and bitter hops. Balanced but intense. It was OK but there are a lot better (and more sessionable) options out there when it comes to ambers (including the less intense and ultra easy to find Fat Tire Amber)."
"Overall: This is a very good bold ale. The spicy smooth flavor up front is accented with perfect hoppiness"

"Dark brown in color. I see a fair amount of sediment floating about within. Head is almost nonexistent. I smell lots of dark malt with a bit of smoked peat. Mouthfeel is a bit warm,sticky, and chewy with all of that dark malt. A bit of toffee and caramel in the flavor."
""
"Bear Republic Red Rock Ale ---4/5."
"Pours a dark mahogany color with a decent head that fades to bits of lacing. Aroma is a bit on the mild side with roasted malt, some dark fruit, bit of caramel and spice. Taste of roasted malt, bit of caramel sweetness and fruit, with a trace of spice in the background. Mild bitterness and a clean finish with a bit of hops tart lingering. Moderate body, smooth and creamy with the 6.8 ABV well hidden. The hops give the beer a bit of character missing from most Amber Ales. Enjoyable beer well worth checking out."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid amber/red ale. Hoppy, drinkable, and balanced. Thought I had this one before, but it just got lost with all the other awesome stiff they do. Add this one to the list folks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - I will be buying more of this for sure. Its a really good ale! It was recommended to me and I am quite happy with it. The balance between the malt and hop is almost perfect in my opinion. The beers appearance is great too."

"O: Red ales aren't always my favorite, and this started pretty malty, tempering my expectations. But in the end, it was quite drinkable and fairly tasty. Overall though, it doesn't do anything to make me want to seek out another one."

"I've heard good things about this beer, can't believe I haven't tried it before now. Very solid brew that I'd recommend to anyone."
""
""
"Pours dark amber/red color with finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are fair.  Yeasty, almost tropical fruit aroma.  Slightly piney, floral accents.  There is a hint of booziness to it.  Either way, it is awesome.  Smooth, creamy, malty taste with a mild hoppy bitterness towards the end.  Hint of caramel.  It does leave a mildly bitter, piney, citric aftertaste.  Awesome beer.  One of my favorites for sure."

"o: The sweet/bitter balance is pleasing. They call this a ""bastardized Scottish style red ale packed with distinctive flavors and an aggressive hop character."" Drinking some ""bears"" that out."
""
""
"The appearance was a dark amber just a hint too strong when compared to amber maple syrup, but still really good. It has a pleasant, fate smell of something fruity.The taste was not bitter much, and only a bit in the aftertaste. It only went down smooth, and felt fruity and roasted nuts.It has a pleasant mouthfeel, did not turn to foamy with swishing, however the roasted flavor becomes more prominent."
"O - 4.75 - I think this is a great beer. The best red IPA that I've had. Compared to Green Flash Hop Head Red and Oskar Blues G'knight there's a spiciness that's just not there with the others. It's almost like if someone mixed one of these two beers and Pliny. I was very surprised at how good this was, especially at 4.50 a bomber."
""
"Appearance is a reddish-brown (more brown than red) with a finger of beige head that left thick lace rings in its wake. Malt notes are present in the nose, but the hoppiness is the standout feature here. A spicy malt note that is almost rye-like takes center stage in the flavor profile. The hops, especially on the finish are quite pronounced for a basic red. This is an impressive offering from a really solid brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An excellent ale. I've had it bottled, as well, and while that is very good, this beer shines on tap."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a reddish chestnut colour. The nose is somewhat subdued for a Bear Republic brew which typically feature a lot of aromatic hops. There are aromas of caramel and a bit of bright pine/citrus. It's an easy-drinker for nearly 7% ABV and there are sweet notes of Fruit Loops and caramel with a very bitter finish. Medium bodied and nicely balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Imagine a malty red ale and a California hop bomb stuffed into the same bottle. This beer is similar to Mendocino Brewing's Red Tale Ale (which also tries to pass itself off as just an Amber Ale). Not bad but, also, not was I was hoping for."
"O: Smooth and enjoyable while being easy to drink because of the well hidden alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall good, Killians on steroids comes to mind"
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, it's a good pine bomb, but the bitterness is a bit overpowering."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a lightly foamy and smooth mouthfeel that fits the style and this beer well. Closes quite dry, with substantial lingering stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
"Very full flavored beer. Malt character is rich, but the hops balance it well. A little too bitter and earthy at the finish for my liking."

"Overall: So sorry to finish this! If only I'd bought more than one bottle! I can't really judge this in terms of style, because its complexity puts it in a category of its own. It's a fascinating journey of a drink. Certainly enjoyable. I might have to be ""in the mood for it"" next time, considering all that minty earthiness, but I applaud Bear Republic for making such a creative, kooky, yet somehow well-balanced ale. I'd love to get my hands on that recipe!"

"C+"
"This beer is quite flavorful, with a nice balance of malt and hops. The hops don't overpower, as can be the case with some west coast brews. I recall many a beer where I dwelled longingly on the rich malty goodness that I could see and feel but could not taste, due to excessive hop happiness. This beer doesn't do that."

"O: A very solid beer. Perfect if you want an IPA style beer with a little more depth."
"Overall, this is good beer, and hopheads can find pleasure in the nice selection of bitter, oily, resinous notes in here. But the beer does ultimately suffer because of the low ABV and the lack of sugars, with the hops simply overpowering everything else, making the beer seem imbalanced and in need of a lot more fruity, sugary notes."
""
"O - As a Scottish ale I say well done, prefer it over Kiltlifter and Old Chub hands down. As an amber/red I say no, theres way to much going on here to be one of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"-Taste and Mouthfeel: Coffee, _hint_ of caramel. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Definitely tasted the piney hops, but they didn't overwhelm the malt. Definitely a malt- forward beer. Though I'm not a major fan of coffee, it was a manageable and balanced coffee flavor. Got a little sweeter as it warmed, which cut the coffee well. I might have scored this a little lower because of that coffee, but I'd also like to think I was more unbiased than that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end this is ok to good beer. I think it has some strong points but I just don't get the high ratings. It isn't a perfect example of a style (an awful reason to score a beer highly imo but I get it) or unique and special, or you know....just an amazing beer (a good reason to score highly)."

"(O)- This really is a quality red ale. Lightly spiced and with a good hop profile. Have had this numerous times throughout the years, but never sat down and reviewed this til now. Definitely a classic for this style and an easy drinker at that."

"A good regular drinking beer. Reminds me of Dale's Pale Ale. Very similar and smooth."

"Dark mahogany sprinkled with bits of sediment and topped by a fat, luscious looking head. Rich caramel and bread smell accompanied by dark fruit, pine sap, and orange. The flavor opens with some toasted caramel malt which is quickly covered by a blanket of pine needles and grapefruit zest. Some nutty and tea-like flavors commingle with the hops. Medium bodied and surprisingly crisp with a solid bitterness. I thought this was a little too sweet the other night, but now it seems just right."

"O - i enjoyed the beer, not really knowing what to expect. i would definitely drink this if given the chance again. won't go seeking it but it is worth trying just for the unusual balance between styles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Anyway, This is an excellent beer worth checking out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Red and hoppy. Nice carmel balance."
""
""
""
"O-Though ABV a little high, a nice sessionable, uncomplicated, straightforward red ale."
"Smell is at first like an IPA, hoppy and flowery, but with an undertone of malt. Tastes like a really good IPA smells; hoppy but with a sweet finish. Mouthfeel matches well; not sure what style this beer really is, but whatever it is, I'd definitely drink it again."
"It's the west coast big-hop flavor aesthetic, I realize but, not my thing. Life is too short to have to grimace and wince as you're sipping some ""aggressively hopped"" beers ..."
""
""
""
"And the best part of all? Despite the smell, it's not really sweet. Hops are ample, and the bitterness lingers for quite a long time. The anticipation and the finish stand out in this beer. With each taste, I bury my nose in the glass and inhale for a bit before drinking, then sit and wait for the finish to...finish. It goes for a long time. I don't often take this long to drink a beer I don't find challenging."
"Red Rocket is a robust red ale. It is very hoppy, with the malt playing a minor role in comparison. Still goes down smooth. Fans of red ales will thoroughly enjoy this one, with its deep red body and sheets of lace. Nothing too fancy about it, just a really solid brew."
""
"This beer is a clear deep dark orange color with little head. The nose is subtle but matches the taste. This is more IPA then red ale. It is very hoppy and very west coast. The hops are sharp and quite piney. There is a bit of citrus in there as well but its very piney and has a nice dry finish. There is little malt flavor that sneaks past the hops but a subtle toffee and caramel flavor if you look for it. This beer has a pretty light feel and is easy drinking. A solid hopped up red."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystalline tree resin red with a sturdy off-white head that disappears slowly with lots of lacing. A lot of reds in my experience are hazy, this one is not. I don't consider that a plus or a minus; just something to note. The beer looks gorgeous, so whatever. Strong fruitiness on the nose. Smells of burnt cherry, marmalade, and graham cracker. The latter being the toasted malts, I suppose? On the first sip I got sour cherry, cappuccino (which was weird) and lots of hops. Unfortunately I also got some shallow, yet apparent, metallic notes, which were definitely not desirable. On subsequent sips the weird coffee notes disappeared and more of the caramelly malts showed through. The tinny metallic taste persisted but was more of an annoyance and not overpowering. Still there was the strong hops bitterness intruding on the finish; over done a bit I think. Overall the beer is very well crafted, but could be more well balanced with either less hops or more malts. Otherwise what are we brewing here? A Red or an IPA? I can't tell. Anyway I still recommend trying this beer, and will try it again myself. Paired with a sweet food like BBQ sauce (chicken/pork) this beer is probably fantastic."

"This is a pretty tasty beer, although you're expecting it to be a red and it tastes more like an IPA. Poured it in a glass and got a nice head. Good mouth feel, not too heavy. Beer has a nice look to it, dark red. Smells hoppy to me. Overall, I like this beer, just expected a red and got a red IPA."

"overall, very little carbonation. i honestly believe the over-hopped american 'craft beers' are fraught with with hops so that they can 'hide' the higher alcohol content. i mean, i understand the greatness of brewing a beer and calling it your own, but i just cant get into the part of dumping mass hops into a brew. it doesnt do anything but add pine tar, grapefruit, or, if you're lucky, a 'floral' - ness to the brew. i suppose that's my rant for the evening, but i really was expecting a little something different. it's not bad; in fact, it's good. but i guess i prefer my beer with a more balanced malt to hop ratio. or maybe a little barley. i can even appreciate a riced-up kirin (but NO BUD!), but the mass tea-bagging of hops just seems to be the 'american way' and i dont agree with it."
""
"Great smell of hops and very creamy in texture. It is unlike any other red ale. its like a red ale mixed in with a porter but very good and better.It also has a few coffee aromas and qualities overall i was very surprised by this beer very good i would say definaity worth a try"
""
"Overall- Have to say that I was disapointed with the mellow smoke finish. I think the hops definitly needed to be present to create a better balance. I will also say that I got this as a single from the grocery store and that it may have been sitting for a while allowing the hops to fade. I will revisit and update if nessicary."

"Pours a mostly clear garnet with one finger thick, creamy tan colored head; settles to a quarter inch, with many dots of lace down the glass. Smell: whiff of grapefruit, then pine settles in with a caramelized sugar back, black cherry and earth. Taste: pine, herbal, minty, caramel with some toasted bread and date-like sweetness getting overpowered with a piney and herbal finish. Creamy, medium bodied feel gives way to a dry, slightly powdery, finish. There are other imperial (read: highly hopped) reds with hop profiles that I much prefer to this one, but the non-imperial abv gives Red Rocket bonus points."

"O - 3.75 - Not a fan of reds/ambers in general but this takes it in a direction with some identity. It's an interesting beer if only because I can't quite figure it out. But mystery is nice."
""
""
""
"This doesn't fit guidelines well, as it's a roasty but sweet beer. The former makes it an Amber, the latter a Scottish. I'm not much of a Scotch Ale guy, so I like the experiment but ultimately that's what it is. I feel the same way about this beer as a cool concept car: fun to think about and try, but impractical for real life use."

"Half finger head on a clear amber body with some lacing. Aroma is very hoppy with grapefruit and orange peel. The flavor has a great caramel malt backbone with citrus light pine and earthy hops. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one is very flavorful and even more drinkable. Excited to see these beers in Florida."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Definitely a good choice for a red ale. Plenty of flavor, well balanced and smooth to boot."
""
"Overall this beer was a little over-the-top for my tastes. If you like big, overly bitter, caustic grapefruit hop forward beers from the west coast then this is probably going to be for you. If you like a more balanced offering as I do, look elsewhere."

"Overall - This is a wonderfully balanced and complex red ale, with all of the flavors complimenting each other without being overly sweet. I find myself contemplative after each sip, enjoying the wonderful symphony of flavors, highly recommend!"
"O: Touted as an aggressively hoped bastardized Scottish style red ale, this brew is highly original, flavorful, and a joy to experience."

"Pours a deep amber/red with about a finger of head. When held up to the light, it is transparent. Smells hoppy-floral and some citrus. I also get some maltiness in the nose. Hoppy up front, but a well balanced maltiness with a nice flavoring of Munich malt. I also pick up some slight dark dried fruit. Slightly sweet and finishes somewhat dry. Alcohol is hidden. Mouthfeel is moderate. Well-carbonated. Overall, I really like this beer. Great looking, and I love the high hoppiness paired with the malt. I would like to see more Amber ales hopped like this. The only other one that I have tried similar to this is Short's Aorta Ale and I've really enjoyed both."
""
""

"Overall, I can see why this is one of the highest rated beers from everyday styles. I wish I could get this at home. Good thing I grabbed a sixer. Great value."
""
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber. A beautiful light brown head, dissipates quickly leaving nice lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and piney hops. Flavor follows with sweet malts and big pine and citrus hops up front with light malt and light fruit body. Very hop forward and the malt did not quite give the support needed for the hop intensity. Medium bodied."
""
""
""
""
"O - An amazing red ale. Tastes like an imperial, but not really at 6.8%. Maybe a hybrid imperial red ale. Scotch red ale is the style, but the hopped up profile of this one makes it amazing"
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely an above average red ale, but I can't help but think it is just a bit malt-heavy for my tastes."

"O: A fine ale! I'm a fan of Bear Republic, a brewery from which I've come to expect great things. Highly recommended. Yum."

"Red Rocket Ale pours a dark hazy amber color, with a nice sized lasting head. There is a nice dry hoppy aroma to this beer. The taste is quite strong. A strong blend of hops and malts, but has an almost sour taste. Slight caramel and nutty flavors come through espically at the end. A nice strong flavor, but a bit much on the pallet. Overall a nice beer, very unique, but worth a try, I see this one being a selective taste type beer."
""
"Overall:  Carmel, raisin, and dark cherry flavors balance well with the floral hop flavors.  An excellent amber ale, worthy of the Bear Republic name.  Recommended."

"O- I liked it, but wouldn't seek it out. Overall a good Scotch Ale,a good American interpretation, but not spectacular."

"O: Not a bad brew at all. Very nice balance of maltyness/sweetness leading right into the hoppyness and then bitters. Very well done brew, would love it try it on tap."
""
"O-Good tasting beer. Good amber hoppy beer. Wouldn't mind having a few more of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit aggressive but great nonetheless."
""
"On tap. Pours a brownish amber with a small off-white head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is caramel with a light hop presence, and a slight nuttiness. The initial taste is sweet with some caramel, a light nuttiness, and some mild floral hops. The finish has a light bitterness and some lingering caramel and nuttiness. Medium body. Medium carbonation."
"I would consider this an IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I just don't like this beer whatsoever because of the hops. If you prefer your ambers and reds to have a more toasted, bready sweet malt feeling, then you won't like this. Burnt hops ..."
"Trying a Red Rocket in Michigan with my BRO....IN LAW. The beer poured a beautiful rich red. Thick head that left a nice lace. Rich caramel malt with a bit of a hop sent. Bubbles every where in this one giving it a great smoothness and opening up the caramel and chocolate flavors. A smooth finish and outstanding experience over all."
""
""

"This is a joy to drink. The flavor is huge and gratifying. Great mouth feel and perfectly carbonted. This will become your favorite red at the first sip, I bet you a beer on it!"

"Somehow I instantly forgot that the bottle said this was kind of a red ale, so I was pleasantly surprised how chestnut deep reddish this beer was in color. Scent offered pine, slight citrus, pungent hops. The taste was exactly what the nose told me, only slightly less, which is very appropriate for a india red ale. The balance was right on target. This is what I've come to expect from Bear Republic, these guys know their ipa's. Watch out Stone! Will definitely try again."

"Overall - This is a very nice appearing beer that delivers on its promise. It looks bold; it tastes bold. Not something I would drink every day because of the intensity of the flavors, but nice on a Friday or Saturday night to pair with some equally bold food like pasta with spicy red sauce and garlic bread."

"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a smooth, easy-drinking feel, and the drinkability is absolutely fantastic here, the smooth mouthfeel and the strong hoppy finish just makes this one go down way too fast. An excellent first brew from Bear Republic, I'm sure to be loading up with their beers on my trip up to New Jersey this summer."

"Not sure how this is a Scottish Red Ale but the bottle also mentioned they break style molds, this could pass as a few styles I'm just rating on personal preference and I enjoyed it no matter what you call it. thanks again papat444 for the bottle"
""
""
""
"Overall - Really solid red ale. Tangy at times. Sweet in others. Certainly a complex, multi-layered, interesting beer. One I should buy more often in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew were the notes of burnt caramel and butter in the nose. These were spot on and made the beer really inviting. This beer actually smells exclusively like any good Scotch ale should, but the difference comes when you get to tasting it. The malts are a bit milder and sweeter than the traditional style, which is where the blending comes in. The hop inclusions are a nice addition, but we wish they had been more robust in the nose, which would have given it the edge we were looking for."

"Pours and amber color ale with a large tan head that results in decent lacing. There is a quick hit of carmel malt followed by a burst of sharp citrus hop aroma. The flavor is a creamy malty backbone with hop flavor and bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied."

"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, muddled, rich, ruby-copper coloring with a dense, off-white, frothy head that remains low profile and retains well. Aromas of wet, fresh hops and a rich, roasted caramel backbone. Flavors are rich and tangy, with a slightly sour caramel backbone supporting a spiced and bitter hops presence. Hops are resiny, with a rich and floral blending to it. Very smooth progression of flavors. Great lacing left along the glass as you drink, and this is a very easy drinker. The aftertaste is hoppy and slightly bitter, with a caramel linger left behind for a smooth, clingy finish that is enjoyable. Good beer."
"O- Great taste, great smell. Weak feel."
"Poured with a very thick light beige head that lingered a while. Deep reddish brown color that was dark, but translucent. Roasted, caramel malt flavor offset by a restrained hoppiness. Pleasant aftertase was a good blend of the flavor characteristics. Fairly rich, well-carbonated mouthfeel bordering on creamy."
"Drinkability – A decent beer, but has an odd bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a textbook hoppy amber. Perfectly executed. Reminds me of 5AM Saint at times but pulls ahead in malt complexity and body by a substantial margin. Just an awesome beer. Ridiculous drinkability too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Gotta say, even though this is a very good beer, I was a bit disappointed with it. But my expectations were high: it looks great and all 3 other beers from this brewer that I am familiar with are really exceptional. Reminiscent of, but not quite up to par with, Rogue Mogul Madness. Still, reasonably priced, flavorful and easy to recommend."
""
""
"O - I was surprised at the bitterness and I think this one shares a lot of flavor characteristics of a rye beer. The flavors improve and balance as it warms and the sweetness begins to show. By the end of the bomber, I really enjoyed it. Very good, especially for under $5/bomber."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very drinkable, balanced, smooth beer. It's a great representation of the style. I will definitely have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty well crafted beer, with a tad too hop bitter presence in finish though that throws this beer off balanced somewhat IMO. Its good, its flavorful, just requires a little force to get through 12+ozs."
""
""
""
"Notes: Robust flavor with medium to full body. Mouthfeel is slick from the hops, and finish is dry. An awesome brew, with amazing drinkability. Not my favorite brew from Bear Republic, but a tasty one, and one that I will be seeking out again in the future."
""
"NOTE: Live review @ The Ram's Head in West Chester, Penna."
""
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD, WORTH SEEKING OUT!"
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. Deffinitly a west coast influenced amber. Peronally think of it as an Indian Amber Ale than just an Amber Ale"
""
""
""
"Overall: B+, points for balance in a relatively-restrained big beer"
"O - I expected this beer to be hoppy due to its higher rating. I didn't realize that it was going to be so well balanced and just a delicious beer. I could easily drink this beer for hours and not tire of the taste."
""
"This is a very interesting beer from BR... but of course it was. That's a great brewery. Americanizing the heck out of a Scottish Ale is something that seems right up their alley for a reason."
"Moderately carbonated, oily slick, dry in the end."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful red ale. Thick head that almost defies gravity. Rich caramel malt with a bit of a hop sent. Bubbles every where in this one giving it a great smoothness and opening up the caramel and chocolate flavors. A smooth finish and outstanding experience over all."
"Overall: A very tasty red ale and a classic example of the style. Hoppy and fruity, but with enough malt sweetness to remind you that its not an IPA."
""
"O: This is a great beer. I find this to be one of those beers that I could drink no matter the occasion."
""
"O - Great Amber/Red. Really enjoyed it."
""
"Pours a hazy amber with a 1 inch khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. There is a good amount of sediment seen floating in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, caramel, and some herbal hop aromas. Taste is of caramel malt and herbal hops on the finish. There is a pretty assertive and almost medicinal bitterness that sticks around after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but nothing special in my opinion."
"overall: This beer is relly good as many other reviews attest. It could be paired with red meat dishes and compliment ideally. I will definitely be going back to this one often. It sets the standard."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'll definately be seeking this out more often. I sadly forgot how great this one is. A very underrated brew!"
""
"Not a bad beer overall. It was actually a bit better than I thought it would be. And to think I ordered something different and picked this as a second option…"
"Quite solid entry into the strong Bear Republic lineup. Yep, I prefer a Racer 5 or Hope Red Rye, but this is a solid change of pace."
"Classic beer here, Im impressed every time I buy one and it turns out to be fresh. Lots of balance, full flavored with big juicy hop flavors up front followed up with the toasted caramel. Finishes dry and refreshing, very gulpable. Body is very nice, it is rich a thick enough without being sweet and cloying. Well done Bear Republic, but please add some damn bottling dates!! Thats what keeps me from buying your beers more often than not."
""
"Overall-a great beer, nice hop profile but has elements that I have not found in other beers, well balanced with the caramel malt taste and it is not overpowering. I have yet to be disapointed by Bear Republic."
"EDIT: After trying it again, at a warmer temperature, it was a little more mellow and I got better flavors out of it. I'm not sure if you should drink it at a warmer temperature, but I'm bumping up the scores to reflect it."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is not as carbonated as I generally like but very refreshing- not too oily and just the right amount of body to make it a very drinkable beer."
""
""
"Edit: I think this may have been an old bottle, but there is no date so it's getting reviewed as-is. If there had been a date on bottle, I'd throw out the review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It is hard to review this beer relative to the style since ""Red Ale"" is kind of a vague, mutt of a beer genre in the first place. It was well balanced and enjoyable but not quite up to the standards set by other brews from the Bear Republic. I would recommend Hop Rod Rye or Racer 5 over this."

"22 oz bomber poured into a Sam Adams glass. Pours a cloudy deep amber, with big fluffy tightly bubbled head. Bready malts with spicy fruitcake hop nose. Big malty taste with piney citrus hops and dark fruits. Very smooth mouthfeel, immediate finish rather wet, then drying on the back of the tongue. An excellent west coast style hoppy amber!"
"Drink- I really liked this beer. I am not normally a red ale fan, but when you mix the juicy hops and dough behind it, it changes to more a more IPA type flavor. I'd come back to this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ale pours hazy red-amber with a thin, creamy light khaki head with nice lacing. The aroma is highly hoppy--pine and citrus with low, yet noticeable toasty caramel malts. The flavor is highly hoppy, loads of pine and solidly bitter. The beer finishes with a dry prick of hop bitterness then a biscuity caramel malt comes through well after the swallow, more noticeable as the beer warms. The body and carbonation are medium. Overall a deliciously hoppy yet some nuances that make it more interesting than most."
""
"Overall: I have never tried any Bear Republic beers and this put them on my radar. Really nice beer for this style and it reminds me of Zoe from Maine Beer Co. Its a good beer for any beer drinking occasion."
"If into hops, definitely pick up. If not, beware, its a bit too bitter for some."

"D/O- I'm gonna say this: This beer doesn't get near the love it deserves. Tons of flavor packed into a (relatively for craft beer, ha) low ABV. Definitely comes recommend if citrus hops are you thing or if you don't think an amber/red can wow you."
"O - The flavors could have been a little better represented. Fairly well balanced, but a little watery. Still a good beer, , but definitely could do better."
""

"Overall I was wondering why this beer was so popular, now I know this is a real surprisingly good one. Nice job there bear!"

"Nice, fresh brew. Doesn't have the ashy bitterness of an IPA but at the same time it could have upped the hops a bit and I wouldn't be complaining."

"It seemed like a just perfect balance of alchohol and hops in this beer. Really good flow to it, I liked drinking this one."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not exactly what I expected from a red ale but enjoyed its use of hops."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great amber ale. The nose had a great mix of caramel malts and hops, while the taste had light hops and many more malts. It was very easy to drink a whole bomber of this, and I'd definitely have it again."
""
"Very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O: If I didn’t know better I’d say this was an ipa that sat on the shelf a few months too long (malty). This was one hoppy amber. As a hop head, I’m impressed, but at the same time, if I wanted hops I’d drink an ipa. I was kinda craving that spicy malty bready taste of the style. This is still very good though."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a solid hoppy amber. Good balance and a nice hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll have to try this again when I can be sure it's fresh. There's no date on this, but I don't think this is supposed to taste like this. A bit cidery even, not something I'm enjoying at all."

"Big plum raisin aroma. Nice creamy mouth feel. Mildly carbonated, bit of nut presence but plum raisin dominates. I think this may have gone over a bit as the reviews and label mention hops and don’t really mention the plum alcohol. Best I can tell it was brewed in July 2010."

"O/D- I love Bear Republic. Have wanted to try this for a while. Love the style. Love the malt and hop combo. Tried it next to a Racer 5. While it is no Racer 5, its still delicious albeit less bracingly bitter and hop forward. Good stuff!"
"O – Some rye like characteristics and an overall very solid well balanced beer, I enjoyed the whole bomber and will pick this up again. Bear Republic gains again on my breweries to watch list. 4.5"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a gorgeous red color with ruby highlights. The one finger of khaki colored head retained itself well and left consistent lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, bready malts, grassy hops and little brown sugar. The flavors were just as balanced as the aroma with the caramel malt and herbal hops perfectly accentuating each other. I also tasted toffee, a bit of citrus hops and a bit of pine. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation light. Very sessionable and an excellent example of the style."
"O - I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I didn't think I was in for such a treat. But I guess I should of since I'm a fan Bear Republic's other brews (e.g. Racer 5, Hop Rod). This is an excellent beer. I really enjoyed the hoppiness this amber/red ale possesses."
"This brew poured out as a nice looking clear red color with a white fizzy head on top. The lacing doesn't stick too much but it holds a decent retention. The smell of the beer is hoppy, there is a sweet malt backbone to the beer also. The taste of the beer is much like the nose, it's hoppy and sweet all at the same time. The mouthfeel gives off some bitterness and a dry feeling after the swallow. Overall this brew is pretty good, I would drink it again if I was in the mood."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good Red Ale. It was on the hoppy side for a Red Ale, but it had a nice caramel malt backbone to balance out all those hops. I found this beer to have good drinkability, I wouldn't mind drinking another one, but after two the bitterness might wear on me. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it was heavy on the hops but the caramel malts kept them in check nicely and when combined they made for a pretty good flavor. What I liked least about this beer was the body, it wasn't bad but it felt just a little watery and would have been perfect with a medium amount of body to it. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Red Ale, the hop profile seems like it would make for a good Red Ale to drink during a warm summer afternoon. I would recommend trying this beer if you are a Red Ale fan or if you like hoppy beers, it's a good example of how well a Red Ale can hold up to a bunch of hops. So far I would say that this is one my favorite Red Ales, I like it slightly better then Cow Catcher, it tastes similar but this beer has a heavier and better tasting hop presence. This was another great beer from Bear Republic, so far every beer I have had from them has been pretty top notch and it seems like they got a knack for the hops, I will have to move on to some of their bigger bottles next, I know what they can do with hops but I am interested to see what they got in store when it come to darker beers, looks like I am gonna have to try Big Bear Black Stout next, I have high hopes, good job Bear Republic."
"O: This is a great tasting beer that has a nice aroma to accompany. These aspects, in my opinion, are the most important when it comes to a beer, but with some work on the appearance and mouthfeel, this could be a great one. I will definitely be revisiting this."
"O - A great red ale. Probably the best commercial one I've had."
"O - Very good amber ale. First I have had from this brewery and will be happy to try more"
"This is an exceptional beer. I look forward to getting another bottle."
"Overall: I really enjoy a standard Irish Red, but this is an excellent hopped-up American version. I will be looking for again, and recommend that you do the same!"
"Fantastic Beer!"
"Pours a dark brown w/ a nice off white head which quickly disappears. Great lacing on the side of my snifter. Smell is fantastic. Caramel malt, hops, pine are the main characters. Really amazing nose! Taste is the same profile as the nose, and excellent for the style. Feel is really smooth, with a hop bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Excellent balance between the two. Overall, this is a great beer for the style. Another winner from Bear Republic."
"Overall: Everything I have had from Bear Republic has been well done. It would be difficult to find an amber that I would prefer over this one."
"This is a solid beer. This is my 4th beer from Bear Republic and it solidifies their awesomeness. Like I said before, great balance between malt and hops. I could see this as being a staple in my fridge when I want something both malty and hoppy. Great job Bear Republic."
"Taste is very similar to the smell. It almost tastes like an IPA, but with a darker malts and a more complex sweetness. The citrusy hops balance it out nicely. The beer is quite heavy, I guess it is following its ""Scottish ale"" description here. It is so creamy and goes down nicely. Almost perfect drinker."
"thanks to nikki's for featuring bear rep this past month."
"O- Satisfying, great mix between an IPA style ale, and a red ale."
"Overall a nice beer, although I thought I liked it more the past few times I've tried it."
"O - I do tend to like hoppy ambers much more than traditional versions of the style, and this is no exception. Another quality beer from Bear Republic."
"Overall - A good beer to introduce people to amber/red ales with, and a great beer overall. Very drinkable and people friendly but for those looking for a hoppier amber/red ale you might wanna look elsewhere in my own opinion."
"22oz bottle. Pours a medium brown color with lots of ruby hues and a half inch of head.Tons of lacing. Aroma is boozey and a bit sweet. Piney hop aroma. Taste is some more of that sweet malt flavor with some bitter pine towards the end. Tastes a bit like a scotch ale or even a barleywine. Surprising amount of boozey flavor for the beer that isn't all that high in the ABV department. Somewhat resinous. Dry mouthfeel. This one grew on me. The more I drank the more I liked it. Overall, a pretty solid hoppy red ale. Worth grabbing."
"Not nearly as good as the Hop Rod Rye. Not a total drainpour, but I dumped it after half so I could have a beer that was good."
"Interesting beer; not what you typically think of in a red. Could pass as a highly hopped, scotch ale variant."
"A very dark amber color with ""floaties"" as this brew is unfiltered. A nice ecru 1 finger head and lacing that will not quit. I mean my entire glass is covered with beautiful frothy rings. The smell is malty, imagine my suprise upon first gulp. I was ambushed with hops. A red with a hop wallop...ohhh, me likey. The finish is balanced with raisinette malt and I am left with a alcohol warming sensation as this sweet juice goes down. The best of both worlds here. The great flavor of a red, with ample hops, and crisp finish. This is, by far, the best amber ale I've ever had. Simply an amazing brew. Bear Republic can do no wrong in my eye. This beer, the Hop Rod Rye and Racer 5 are all top notch. I look forward to trying more from them in the future."
"O- Great Amber ale. Seems to mesh several styles together (IPA, Scottish Ale, Red ale). Very well done and tasty."
"Terrific beer. A dark colored red ale. Significant Cascade hops aroma, coupled with some deeply roasted malt character, makes for a rich, satisfying glass. Finishes clean, with a harmonious balance between sweetness and bitterness. Makes me forget about wanting NB's Fat Tire."
"Overall I'm disappointed in this. I feel like it's a bit hollow and never followed through based on it's decently appealing appearance and taste."
"Great malt base, very flavorful and satisfying."
"Overall this is another good beer from Bear Republic. It's a hop lovers red that's for certain. Wish it was slightly maltier actually."
"O: I could almost see the surfboard in my periferal vision. California hops and then some... REALLY NICE!"
"Overall: Excellent red ale and one that I would get again. This one absolutely blasted off and left me in awe."
"The very definition of a west coast red ale, this is a HUGE beer. Personally I would prefer less hops and less alcohol for a more drinkable beer, but then it just wouldn't be Red Rocket."
"O- This is a style I'm not that familiar with, but I spoiled myself with Nugget Nectar. This is your example of a balanced amber ale. My experience with this was more malt forward which may suggest some age, but no indication of bottling date. Because this is so drinkable, and smells and looks great I enjoyed this beer vey much. Cant help but think of a certain Southpark scene that I wanted gone from my memory though..."
"I really enjoyed this one. Deep red with a 2 finger beige foam head that lasted several minutes. Nice citrus aroma. Lots of different flavors...bitter at first becoming sweet with caramel and citrus flavors. Hoppy feel, then more malty at the finish. Fine craft beer."
"A rich ruby red on the pour with a nice tan lasting head with good lacing. Sweet caramel malt, fruity spices and a nice sweet floral earthy hops fill the nose. Taste is nice sweet caramel malts with nice fruity tones, some yeast and nice hops flavor. Medium body and moderate carbonation on the palate along with a smooth mouth feel. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt some yeast and fruit spices ending with a nice hops edge to add balance. A brew with malty character and a persistent dry earthy hops bitterness. Overall an interesting but good and drinkable brew"
"Red in color with a large off-white head. Piney aroma with lots of hops evident. Flavor is also very hoppy with less malt than I'd expect from a red ale. Would have liked a little more malty sweetness to balance. Crisp mouthfeel."
"O - This is an extremely enjoyable beer that seems to have everything going for it. The malts and hops are both ever-present, and the ABV of 6.8% is well masked. I will probably pick this up again, and would definitely order it on tap, if available."
"For an amber, this is certainly one of the hoppier ones I've had. The bitterness could rival many IPA's. It's certainly not bad for an IPA (if it was one), but for an amber it's pretty aggressive."
"O: Mostly bitter with not as much flavor as I was hoping for. But, it did have an excellent appearance."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly; I would consider it to be sessionable except that its alcohol content is a bit too high."
"I will definitely need to buy and drink more of this. Very happy with the purchase, worth every penny. Truly excellent beer."
"Overall, this is a great hoppy red ale. It is definitely worth seeking out. Luckily, it is fairly well-distributed. Too bad I can't get it here in Maine. I'll get more next time I'm in MA."
"A well hopped, bitter amber ale. American to the core."
"O: A great tasting, unique and well balanced ale. It wasn't what I was expecting, but that's good in this case."
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with great levels of carbonation. There is a good film left on the inside of your mouth with each sip as well. Overall, this is a great brew! Stands up to the better ambers I've had. Very hoppy, yet balanced, drinkable and complex."
"M: Carbonation is perfect, present and not overpowering. Smooth flow and great warming aftertaste. Refreshing with a light/medium body. Bravo."
"Overall, nothing special, just a solid red ale."
"Overall impression: robust yet drinkable and extremely flavorul, a winning combination."
"O - A solid red ale with a nice level of dry hoppiness to it. A good pairing of dry hops and spiced spruce."
"O: I set the bar high for this beer considering the brewery, and it has surpassed my expectations. Bear Republic made good efforts to create and extraordinary red ale."
"A great beer from Bear Republic, I feel they are in a class of their own with this one, self-described as a ""bastardized Scottish Ale""."
"Overall: Wow! THIS is an amber ale?! According to the Bros, it's hybrid of sorts - although I'm somehow thinking of Flanders reds, and not Scottish reds - and I couldn't agree more. The bottle conditioning really allows this thing to be a flavorful experience like no other. Bear Republic once again shows the beauty and future of American craft brewing in this rather intense beer of their's. Due to its heaviness, it's not something I could sit and have any day, but it's quite recommended!"
"Close to as perfectly balanced as could be I think. Its rich and flavorful from the dark roasted malt character, but the hops come in and accent them so well that the two tastes combine perfectly into one really great taste. Pine hops rule in the back but the caramel character felt in the malt front is so understated that it becomes a work of art. Some booziness in the taste as well, especially detectable once its warmed up a bit. I think if this were ever so slightly more carbonated, the beer would be a bit more crisp, but this starts with a creamier mouthfeel and ends closer to the crisp side. Really, even the carbonation is nicely balanced. Overall, this goes right alongside Hop Rod Rye and Racer 5 as a few in my top 20 favorite beers."
"Though I seem to remember it having a bigger hop presence when I sampled it from a bomber, I still thoroughly enjoyed this brew. I always love beers which blend styles and blur the lines of what category a beer falls under. This isn’t quite a Scottish ale, and it’s not quite a red ale, yet it’s both and neither at the same time. Plus a bottle conditioned brew always gains points from me. Keep up the good work bear republic, you have yet to disappoint me."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Dark mahogany in color with a deep haze and reddish hue on the edges of the glass. Poured with a very brief head that reduced to a sticky ring on the glass. Mostly sweet caramel malt flavors with floral hops and dark fruit. Medium bodied and a bit on the oily side up front that subdues the carbonation a bit. The carbonation slowly intensifies toward the finish as the oily feel transitions to a light resinous feel. Dark caramel malt is the dominant flavor with a hint of chocolate and dark, ripe, fruit through the middle. Hop character starts slowly but builds from beginning to end, starting with floral flavors and ending with pine hop bitterness. Finishes semi-dry with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Lots of subtle complexity in aroma, flavor and feel."
"This one really kind of messed with my mind at first. When I took my first whiff all I got was bacon grease. I thought csbosox may have not washed my glass very well. Then I read the lable and picked up Scottish red ale and things started to make more sence. The beer was poured into a New Belguim Worthy glass. Dark red with some firey hues near the bottom. Carbonation rose from the bottom to ample beige head that lasted most of the experience. The nose was smokey with a touch of roast. The hops didn’t really come out to play until the beer had warmed quite a bit. The flavor was very rich with chocolate and roast along with some peaty smokey flavor. A touch of toffee. Quite full bodied, and silky over smooth over the tongue. No unpleasant sensatiolns at all. Overall, this isn’t a beer I’d drink very often, but interesting nonetheless."
"Slainte."
"I think that this was one of the first big hoppy American Ambers that I experienced back when I first really got into craft beer and I was pleased to find that it still holds up. By only complaint is that the toasted aspect of this comes on a bit strong at times but there is no doubt that this is quite full flavored and easy drinking for the relative size of it."
"Poured a very slow to emerge 1/8"" head which quickly disappeared to lace. Deep ruddy brown color and when held to bright light it just barely has a maroon tinge. Smells of caramel hops IPA. Taste is the same and also has a little sweet raisin. Although I had high expectations and this generally gets great reviews I just thought my sample was far flatter and less complicated than I was expecting."
"O: Excellent Red Ale. I have tried a lot of things from Bear Republic and have yet to be let down. I don't know if I could do a six pack of this, but I would definitely pick it up if the mood was right."
"O-a good red ale at a good price"
"cheers!"
"Pours a dark amber with a thick off white head. Has little floaties throughout the glass and leaves a nice ring of lace. Smells of hop, malt, and caramel. Enjoy the hoppy smell for a Red Ale. Taste is average at best. Has a small hop profile, a bready yeast taste, and a sweet caramel backbone. Mouthful is thin and carbonation is present. Overall this is an average beer. I'm glad I had a chance to try it. Nugget Nectar turned me on to the style and think it may have me biased on my reviews of Amber Ales, but I'm trying to find another Amber Ale to live up to those standards."
"O: A highly rated beer on BA. I see it everywhere but never get it. Found a 12oz'er for $1.59 so I said might-as-well. For me this is just another mildly sweet Red Ale. Typical. Can be found by half the brewers around here. I had a higher hope for it as it seems like there is such a big thing how West Coast beers are overall better than East Coast beers."
"O: Definitely one of my favorite red ales, second only to Nugget Nectar and Peak's King Crimson. However, this is a lot cheaper, so its a better deal I'd say. Malty for everyone, and a little bitter for us hop-heads."
"Looks nice and foamy. A deep mahogany brown with ruby tinged edges. 1 finger creamy-bubbled head, leaves behind some interesting lacing patterns. Tons of citric hop flavor and smell ambushes me repeatedly. Sadly, I find that the malt is simply too weak to hold up to the aggressive hopping. Everything seems out of balance to me, both in the nose and in the taste. I've had imperial IPAs that had much better balance between malts and hops than this thing. I can't even smell or taste the malt, this comes across to me as a poorly done IPA, not as a red ale. I can't find any yeasty bready presence at all. I can't find any malt at all. I'm left alone with one trick pony citric hops. Thankfully, there is an excellent and light refreshing mouthfeel, crisply carbonated. The texture is easily the strongest suit of this brew. I'm not impressed."
"Overall. Its good. Not great, not worthy of an A on Beer Advocate, but good. Too pricey for me to buy regularly."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. This American Red Ale poured a hazy mahogany color. It produced a nice thick head and had excellent retention. There was a nice amount of lace stuck to the glass. The Aroma was full of roasted caramel malt and had hits of pine cones. According to the bottle this beer was bottle conditioned which explains its very active carbonation. The taste comprised of chocolate, roasted malt and caramel. There is also a nice amount of bitter hop flavor and gives this ale some ""balls"". Overall very good beer, I was not disappointed."
"O - Overall, a great red ale on steroids with superb taste and unique smells. Recommended for a hop head or a red head lover."
"Overall: A good hoppy beer, though I personally wouldn't classify it as a red ale. It is definitely worth trying, especially if you enjoy a nice hoppy/grainy ale. Definitely will get again."
"Overall- this one is an experience to the palate, on the one hand you have that great hop presence with the resiny pine flavours and hops, and on the other hand it finishes with that great sweet caramel flavour that is just not found in a lot of other red ales. Wish I would have picked up at least a 6 of this because it is well worth it, over and above my expectations, would and definitely will pick this one up again if I have the chance."
"O: A very fine red ale that does a great job balancing the heavy, sweet malt profile with some ""aggressive"" hopping. Fairly easy to drink at only 6.8%, too!"
"Opinion: Overall I am really happy with this one. It has lots of flavor and a balanced profile with plenty of carbonation. There is nothing that hits the palate like it shouldn't be there, so overall, I would give this beer a solid thumbs up!"
"O: i believe this is the first bear republic offering i haven't been impressed with. not my favorite of the style due to the malt forward smell and taste, but worth trying"
"I would drink it again."
"I appreciate Bear Republic, but I've never been a huge fan of this one.. there are too many better examples of a red ale."
"Overall: This is a decent beer. Definitely above average, its bitterness is something to be challenged, even by imperial brews. A little sour for my liking, but not repulsively so."
"A great looking beer with an incredible aroma. A tasty and delicious red ale."
"Very satisfying and highly drinkable. Nothing is overdone and the interaction between hops and malt is uncomplicated while at the same time distinctive. Good stuff."
"Pours out a deep dark red, almost mahogany color with a tan colored head. The foam quickly dissipates. Not what I would expect from a ""red ale", but impressive nonetheless. The smells are of a rich, hoppy ale. Some dark ripe fruits along with a somewhat subtle citric hop twang. Nice resinous hops hit the tongue with some sweet but roasty malts. Ahh, kinda reminds me of some other hoppy, yet malty based beers I've been enjoying lately. If i didn't know better I would say there is some spicey rye in there but that could be the interplay of the hops fooling me. The beer has a nice smoothless, light carbonation from the natural fermentation. This is a quality beer throughout. This beer would pair well with a nice summer BBQ, or some sweet and spicey smoked wings."
"O - A solid beer. Aromatic and tasteful. Rough around the edges in terms of mouth feel but overall very drinkable."
"Overall this is a decent amber that has more hop character than most. Unfortunately the taste did not quite live up to the nice balanced aroma and made this beer one that I will probably not seek out in the future."
"D-Overall this was an ok amber red ale. Felt more like an ipa. But was not too impressed with the flavor. Would like to gve this beer another try"
"Overall, a great beer. Somewhat turned off by the floaties, but got past them to enjoy this balanced but hop-forward IPA."
"O - Really dig this ale. Has a great appearance and taste. Some might find the hops to be somewhat overpowering, however, I think this only adds to the drinkability of this Bear Republic offering."
"Overall, this is a fine beer, though I wish the toasted notes were held just a bit further back to open up some space for the beautiful pine notes that they drown out."
"Pours out a dark reddish brown body with a thick tan white head that has great retention and some of the best lacing I have seen on a beer in awhile. The smell is a pleasant mix of raisins, caramel, sweet malts and pine. The taste is a nice balance of sweet malts, raisins, caramel and than it balances out with a nice finish of pine, citrus and earthy hops. With a very smooth and soft creamy mouthfeel and a very well balanced taste makes this a great beer to enjoy. An unique beer that is a must try, I'm glad I did."
"Overall: another beer from Bear Republic worthy of a sixer (or more) purchase."
"O: Solid brew. It hits the spot if your in the mood for an bigger IPA. Would buy again."
"A lovely beer for a lovely spring day. Pour is a dark, dark red through the light, with a <i>lot</i> of sediment in suspension and really long-lived lace. As for the smell - it's sweet! And piney! And sweet! Some serious caramel going on there, and it shows up to the taste party. In good balance with citrus, that is. It's as sticky as it looks on the glass (and that's pretty sticky) in the mouth, and the carbonation doesn't burn too long or fade too fast. On top of all this I just noticed - is the C just backwards or is it ""Red Roжet""? That would be neat. Lord knows we need more Soviet-themed red ales. Especially ones as good as this."
"O – It’s not so much that the bitterness is overpowering – it really isn’t – it’s just that I wish there were more hop flavor to complement the alpha oil."
"(12oz bottle). Pours a hazy mahogany color with thick off-white head. Has aroma of cardboard, florals, caramel, and some alcohol. Taste is malty with some hop bitterness. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Bitter finish. Its a little too malty for my liking, but otherwise, its a nice beer"
"O: A nice beer. Scottish ales are not my favorite style. This has a nice balance and unique flavor...just not for me I guess."
"Overall this is really good. I wasn't sure what to expect from the nose, with it being so faint, but in the mouth, this is a fine offering from Bear Republic."
"A highly balanced beer with a bit more body that what I'd expect for the style, good hoppiness reels this one in to the red ale range though I'd prefer the balanced of hops and malt to be switched."
"Medium bodied"
"O- This is such a fantastically well balanced beer and so dangerously drinkable. The hops are at times aggressive (finish) and at times nuanced (mid palate), but they are sublimely countered by the heaping helping of crisp, roasty, caramel malted goodness. Hopheads may find this to be underwhelming; but if you're looking for a well hopped yet perfectly balanced amber, look no further."
"Overall - fantastic beer, I could have a few for sure. love all the taste and smell that are going on at the same time."
"An outstanding red ale. What really stood out to me was how well balanced this beer is. You really get a good dosage of all the ingredients. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of hops present in both the aroma and taste. An excellent choice"
"I’m too often disappointed with Red Ales. But this one is a game changer for me. A great full-flavored, balanced beer with both malt and hop profiles on display, topped with spices and herbs to make things exciting. Recommended."
"Overall Drinkability - Good, smooth and drinkable. Balanced yet not boring."
"O- I have to try this out of a bottle or maybe a different keg because this didn't impress me much."
"Overall: damn I guess I set my expectations too high expecting a balanced hop to sweetness ratio. I guess I will need to try it again in the future to see if it grows on me."
"I had something else by this brewer I really liked so I decided to try this. Definitely not disappointed - even though I don't like ambers that much. Very crisp, full, bitter mouthfeel. Interesting aroma, like citrus and cotton candy. Nice bubbles, coming up from the bottom...again, very carbonated. Dark red-brown color with caramel color head. Taste - hard to describe, just bitter, herbal, grassy."
"This beer makes me believe in red ale again."
"Drinkability: If you like hoppy beers, and I do. You will like this one. This may become a staple in my fridge. Very nice brew."
"Not sure why, but this is one of my favorite beers right now. The first time I bought a six pack at bev mo I broke one accidentally in the aisle and the hoppy smell was so perfect I wanted to lap it up right there. Since I had my son with me, I waited until I got home to enjoy one. And have continued to enjoy them since."
"22 ounce bottle. Pours clear dark red color with a 2 finger light tan head with very good retention that reduces to a thick cap that leaves some very nice lacing. Aromas of caramel, pine, citrus, molasses, and toffee. Taste of caramel, citrus, pine, and toasty malt. Bitterness shows up after the finish, and lingers with the citrus, pine, and toasted flavors. Really creamy mouthfeel that goes down extremely smoothly, and is extremely enjoyable to drink. Well balanced with malty flavors and bitterness pretty much perfectly balanced, one does not overpower the other. Medium-full body with medium carbonation. No alcohol presence noticed. Overall, this is extremely delicious, and another great brew by Bear Republic. I will be having this again for sure."
"Drinkability: A great example of it's style- a great showing of both the malts and the hops, everything falls into line great here. If I'm in the mood for a red ale, then I would very likely go for one of these."
"Excellent! Bravo! This is the best American Red that I have ever had. (3/4/2011)"
"Drinkability: A very good beer. Barely any alcohol presence, very bold and full flavour, beautiful pour, nice strong but not overpowering aroma. Overall, this is a well-crafted brew."
"D - A very well balanced american amber / red ale. I would most certainly have another."
"Drinkability: abv may reduce overall quantity but the beer is not heavy or overly sweet"
" Finally, the beer's taste ""if around in the 1700's, it would have coerced our forefathers to put beer in the preamble of the constitution"" with a bitter, nutty aftertaste left in their mouths."
"D: Pretty darn good. Would be a good summer beer. Nice, smooth, and refreshing. Not particularly my favorite beer, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"D: Quite drinkable. Could have more than one. I imagine if the beer was fresher (assuming not fresh given that the bottle has no date on it), it would be much, much better. Too bad."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A pretty delicious red ale. I've never had a combination red and Scottish ale before. Despite being bottle in August of 2009; it aged quite well and still tasted pretty fresh. You also can't beat the reasonable $6.99 price tag for all Bear Republic bombers."
"D: A little overly sweet for me; while the flavor is alright, the hops are a bit outbalanced by sweetness. Not a big enough fan to be looking forward to having this one again."
"drinkability: wish I knew the date on this. add some hop power and this would be world class. nice hopped up amber ale"
"D: This was one of the first ""craft beers"" that I had back when I turned 21 and while I didn't love it back then, I think it's pretty solid now."
"this is exactly the way a red ale should taste. sweet and hoppy up front with a dry bitter finish. this one in particular is very hoppy, not surprising being it's bear republic. the nose on this thing is awesome, one of the best smelling red ales ive ever had. over all it's worth it's high rating. i wish more red ales had the balls of this guy."
"The body was fairly typical, medium and crisp, with a clean finish. Drinkability was good as well, these guys go.down easy. I've enjoyed this brew before and was surprised to see that I'd yet to review it. Certainly worth your time when you see it."
"Like other Bear Republic brews I've had, this is right at the top of its class. Quickly moving its way up into my top 5 breweries."
"Mouthfeel is very coarse, with my enamel taking a beating right now, but it is good all the same. Drinkability is helped by the finish, but also by the light body and texture of this beer (which isn't to say it's thin - it isn't - but that it is very light for such a full bodied and flavorful brew). High marks to bear republic, they know how to make hoppy beers."
"This beer is excellent, it smells like a caramel candy but the flavor is full of hops, very enjoyable."
"D: This is a nice beer overall. I'm glad I grabbed it."
"Definitely unique for an amber/red ale. Good job, Bear Republic."
"D- At 6. 8% makes this extremely drinkable. And is also extremely delicious."
"The drinkability is pretty good at 7%. I really enjoyed drinking this."
"This a very good beer. Held up to a light it has a nice ruby red hue. There was not much of a head to it after I poured it into a pint glass. Maybe a hint of citrus in its aroma but pleasant. Strong, but not too strong, hops presence and slightly malty, in my opinion. I normally do not like heavily hopped brews, but this had a nice balance to it. I definitely will buy this beer again."
"Highly recommended."
"Poured aggressively, 2-finger head reduces to large bubbly film, heaving lacing, color is crimson black. Aroma of oak and very creamy vanilla, likely from the fantastic malt profile. Taste of barely toasted malts, vanilla, and unfortunately slight diacetyl. This is a GREAT session red ale. Enough said."
"Drinkability is solid. The flavors are mild yet complex. This one would make a good sixer for a night of drinking."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown mahogany with a finger-tip sized vanilla-cream colored head. The nose is very complex - roasted malt, coffee, cream and citrus. The taste to me is reminiscent of DFH Burton Baton, but kicked down a notch. Maple syrup, malt and citrus hit you right away with the perfect amount of lingering hops as it moves down. A very nice beer!"
"This is a great beer to move one of your buddies away from Killians Red. One of the best Amber beer I have had."
" ~ This came recommend to me by a gentleman that I encountered at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa. I'm glad I took a chance because the brew isn't bad. I think the brew is okay, not the best Red I've ever had but certainly unique enough to seek out and try."
"-bear republic is as can't miss as you can find in a brewer, but this is my least favorite of the few they actually bottle. i dont dislike it, but it isnt a go to by any means"
"Poured into dimple glass from a 12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown, almost black with frothy head and good lacing. Aroma is dominated by dark fruit, brown sugar, and an overall theme of sweet malt. Some grapefruity hops poke through as well, but only mildly. Flavor is loaded with silky smooth, and somewhat roasty malt with some sweetness. Hoppyness complements the sweetness of the malt. Palate is full and smooth. Full body, big carbonation, smooth finish. This was a fantastic huge malty beer with great balance!"
"Comments: This may have become a ""go to"" beer for me when tailgating, or looking to drink something in quantity at picnics, etc. I can only imagine this beer nice and cold as I sit by the smoker on a nice summer afternoon waiting for ribs to finish. Too bad it's January or else I'd fire it up right now!"
"Although I was disappointed in this beer, I still enjoyed it and finished the bomber. My sense is that it was not a fresh bottle, but being bottle conditioned that should not make as much a difference?"
"This brew pours a nice cherry hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a two finger head and some nice clingy lacing,the smell is pretty much like a xmas cake with hints of cherries,brandy and some muesli,it has a light-medium bodied mouthfeel which is nicely carbonated and the flavours of the xmas cake really stand out along with some toasty nuttiness,caramel and a slight piney hit right at the end,overall not bad but after trying the other offerings from this brewery i know they can do better and there is not enough interest factor here for me to revisit it."
"D-Nice beer and easy to drink."
"Overall: Another solid beer from a great brewing company."
"Pours a dark amber red color with a medium off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is hoppy with a different sort of fruit aroma...almost like strawberries. I also get grapefruit and caramel. Taste is very hoppy and slightly floral. I get some notes of chocolate along with citrus flavors and cherries. It ends with a bitter hoppy burnt finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with very high drinkability."
"D - A great tasting, strong amber ale. Good drinkability."
"Well played Bear Republic. Might have to seek other types out given how good this was."
"D: Pretty good hoppy red from Bear Republic--would drink a few of these"
"D - I have to admit I'm not the worlds biggest fan of Red Ale's, but this one was a solid beer and something I have a few more times in one sitting; its filling even with its thin liquid feel; don't be fooled, this beer was made to take control of your senses"
"Drinkability- pretty good beer. I'm not a fan of the finish, which has a bit of a metallic taste. Its the only negative factor in the drinkability."
"O: Great offering for a red ale due to the wonderful balance of the beer. I really enjoyed the complex flavors (wood/earth) that you don't usually get from a rel ale."
"Lighter than expected and quite easy-drinking, although I expected a little more flavor impact. Sampled this after another IPA and I think this beer's hops were lost in the shuffle-- my fault!"
"Now I have to think which is better Nugget Nectar or this. I will do a side by side comparasion soon."
"D: Very good red ale. I like the idea of taking a traditional red ale and adding hops. Nice change of pace from the traditional beers."
"This is another great offering from Bear Republic."
"I live in PA and want a whole case now. Bear Republic hasn't ceased to impress me yet!"
"Drink - Bear Republic; you've done it again! This is beer is very tasty and extremely drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and it has a gorgeous appearance. It's one of the better beers I've had the pleasure of drinking."
"Conclusion: This is one of my favorite red ales - very solid. It sort of reminds me of Arrogant Bastard, but not has hoped intensive."
"Solid consistent head all the way to the end-excellent lacing. Dark mahogany. Nice ripe tropical hop aromas balanced well with a hint of toffee malt. Smooth with evident bitterness that doesn't dominate. Not much to dislike here. Perhaps a little astringent on the finish but it's all good. Nice beer worth revisiting."
"This is an instant classic. Pours a ruby red with a nice white, pillowy head. Lots of lacing down the glass. Scents of grapefruit and cherry, just fantastic scent. Tastes like a top notch imperial red ale. Fruity and crisp hoppiness on the backend. palate bursts with flavors. An excellent brew I will seek out more often."
"This is a beautiful beer with so many different elements meshing together. The roasty malts and citrusy hops remind me a bit of a black IPA, but the roast and hops are so well proportionate that neither one is overwhelming. This is a great beer, and I need to go pick up more quickly."
"The boot action continues. Into it, this brew pours a clear deep ruby-garnet topped by a finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises menthol, pine, greens, and toffee. The taste holds notes of pine, caramel, and that pesky menthol again. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky finish. Overall, I'm not too big a fan o' this brew. Whatever caused that menthol character really ruined things. Had that not been there, this probably would've been a lot better."
"A perfect melding of Scottish red ale and West Coast pale ale styles. My first brew from Bear Republic, sure won't be my last. Would that I could get this stuff in Ontario more often..."
"This beer looks a deep mahogany with a beige foam. There is a caramel smell with some certain hop varieties mixed within. There are oranges and caramel with some pine mixed in. The aroma is caramel and brown sugar with some raisin mixed in. The slight hoppy flavor works well. The mouthfeel is good and it drinks well. I like this beer."
"Certainly a big, hoppy west coast style amber."
"Drinkabilty - At 6.8% its borderline drinking more then 2-3 at a time. I drink this beer with its famiular tastes, it made me want a hop rod ale. One of the best red ales, and more drinkable then most, another great beer from bear republic"
"Drinkability: Very bitter for an imperial red, however I doi like the touch of chocolate I can detect. I would get a 12 ouncer as a change of pace beer, but probably would not look for regularly."
"D-While I don't think that I'll drink a lot of this beer I have to say that it's balanced and enjoyable. The hops provide a relief for the malty sweetness that makes the beer quaffable."
"Amber brown color with a nice head. I love me a good red/amber ale. Looks downright erotic. Can't wait to take a sip. Smells of fresh hops and a pleasant fruit aroma. Tastes of that good citrus hoppiness that I have grown to love. Bitterness isn't overwhelming. Carbonation is pretty much right where it should be. No nuggest nectar but a sild red ale from BR. I could have a couple of these."
"Red Rocket Ale has an amber brown colour and a good head. The smell is of sweet hops and some fruitiness. The first thing you taste is hops into sweet citrus. There is some bitterness. This beer has a medium amount of carbonation. This is a very nice amber/red ale."
"D: Very flavorful and balanced, yet complex, strong red ale. I really wish I had another. The 6.8% ABV doesn't really go noticed amongst the strong, fruity ale character and hop profile. Interesting and enjoyable from beginning to finish."
"Lets just say drinkability is very high another great brew from Bear Republic!"
"Mouthfeel is nice as well, light but suiting the flavour profile. Its a touch dry though. Drinkability is good."
"D: Quite drinkable, first beer from Bear Republic that I've had, so with this good experience, I'll be heading back for more."
"Carbonation is a bit high but without it the rich malt could be cloying."
"D- pretty drinkable, it's growing on me as I make my way through the glass, so I'm thinking several could be worked through without a problem."
"M/D: Could have been more sweeter or the hop flavor toned down. Tastes like an IPA / amber / porter / scotch ale hybrid. A beer I can recommend."
"D - A very nice beer indeed. Perhaps a bit too rich maltiness to drink much."
"A plethora of flavor in this red. When most breweries are content to make an easy drinking red/amber, this one is taken to another level. Easy balanced drinking but wonderful flavors make this one of my favorite reds so far."
"Mouthfeel/Dinkability: This beer has a medium mouthfeel and is pretty smooth and creamy. Drinkability is pretty high with the balance of flavors and pleasant mouthfeel. Very solid beer overall."
"Wasn't anything like I expected but completely satisfied none the less. Was expecting a Red Ale but this is more like a cross between a Red Ale and A Porter. Poured thick with a beautiful fluffy head and thick lacing around the glass as I drank it. In fact, I was really impessed by the thickness of the lacing and the beautiful almost mountain-like head. Tasted real nice with a great balance of hops (just enough to provide some fragrance and bitterness) and malt which was of a toasty smoky Stout like roast"
"One of the more solid amber ales out there for sure, as BR hits the nail on the head once again."
"D- Decent stab at this style. Easy drinking, just nothing sticking out as anything unusual. Good balance and great flavor."
"Dark ruby color with a creamy tan head. Aroma has a very nice and sweet resin note at the beginning, followed closely by citrus and caramel with a little touch of bitter hops. Flavor is smooth and sweet at the front with a middle of caramel and sweet malts and a light and bitter finish. Lingers for a bit on the tongue. Bear Republic has never let me down..."
"Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, with good carbonation. Drinkability suffers a little due to my bias towards the style, but would be stronger for fans of it. The 6.8abv contributed to the night being a lot more fun than the morning."
"This is great! I love the hoppiness and balance of other flavors. A surprisingly great beer!"
"Pours a real red, good beige head looks pretty tasty. Smells malty and hoppy, very excited at this point. Carbonation is low on this one, can barely see bubbles rising. Taste is a little weak in the malt but hops are there. Hop note is not very complex as in other reds/ambers. The bitterness is refresshing but could use some debth, color is deceiving. Very drinkable though as i continued with my second pour got a bit more balanced as it warmed. I would drink it again though and would like to give it another chance on tap. A good beer but not as good as my favorite reds."
"M/D: Medium bodied, on the drier side and leaves a sticky mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable, but not as great as I was hoping. It was a good beer, but not a great one."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a good beer by all means, but nothing special."
"I would drink this again when Im in the mood for a nice red. Bear Republic makes some good stuff."
"I would have thought this would be fuller bodied. has a little thinner edge which I'm not sure I like, although I see the purpose. Not cloying at all, and aids in drinkability. Good with food or on its own. Filling and satisfying. Good complex and drinkable."
"I will not be buying any more Bear Republic products until they put a bottle date on their product. You guys are now 0 for 2 with me."
"D-heck yes, a solid red"
"Just had at UPick6 in Erie PA. Cask....What a way to make a great beer better. Creamy as hell, Foam stuck to the glass from top to bottom. I made noises every time I Sipped."
"drinks ok. nothing special here, unfortunately. I remember a bit more piney hops in the flavor, but i may be confused. I would have enjoyed that i bit better i think. though, this is not bad at all."
"What a great coffee-like color. The creamy head had a nice brown tint to it as well. I'm used to tasting the hops a second after I take a drink, but the hops in this beer hit quick, then leave you with their pleasant bouquets while you enjoy the soft, carmely maltiness and return slightly for a good finish. What a talented beer! Each sip cleared my palate enough that the flavors didn't build up and overwhelm my senses by the end of the bottle, making for one of the most drinkable dark beers I've ever had."
"Drinkable? Oh yeah. Well, might be a bit full and filling to be one you'd guzzle a 6 pack in an evening but it's a nice ""tweener"" with elements of IPA and Porter The bottle notes call it Scotch Ale but I'd tend to compare it to Dark IPA's like Dogfish 90 and Yakima Twilight. Rather than real big in any area,it's a jack of all trades between the Stouts and IPAs with a bit more going on than a Brown/Amber tends to have."
"D-Deliciously flavorful and highly drinkable i put down two 22 ouncers. I seemingly couldn't get enough of this ale. Highly recommend!"
"D - I could probably drink a case of bombers in one sitting... I couldn't stand up afterwards, but I could revel in my greatness!"
"Drinkability-Almost done with my second bottle as I'm writing, gotta give it the nod here."
"Bear Republic Brewing Company--Ricardo's Red Rocket Ale--2009 22 oz. Bottle. 6.80% ABV. 65+IBU's? (4.25 / 5.0) Red Ale--Scottish. Rich lacy off white head. Clear deep dark copper red color. Sediment hint hazes bronze. Roasted malty rich floral hop smoky peat hint front. Rich malty roasted mild sweet hop resin infused toffee mild smoky peat burnt fruit body. Cloying malt hop spice end. Sampled 9/16/2009. 4 @ $4.00 Each."
"D: Another impressive brew from Bear Republic; we finished the growler with ease! Good stuff."
"I definitely enjoyed this one a lot, and will look for packs of it for the summer. I had it on its own, but I can imagine it with grilled red meat, hearty pasta, pizza, burgers, and cheesecake. MMMmmm, maybe in a cheesecake..."
"This is a very easy drinker, there is good flavor and good balance. Though this was a little too watery and thin for me."
"Red Rocket Ale very good red ale that is a dark copper color with a finely knit cap or just off-white head that leaves clingy splotches on the glass. Dark caramel malt, sweet breadiness, and piney hops dominate the nose and the taste. The finish is sweet and very bitter. As the beer warms the overwhelming bitterness is mediated by malt depth and melanoidin flavors. The beer is slick and thick, which makes it luxurious in the mouth."
"Full finger white semi-rocky head, medium dissipation. Dark amber/brown body with some garnet highlights, too dark for visible carbonation. Crystal malt dominated nose, some citrus notes to the hops. Taste profile mirrors nose, a bit of spiciness on the backend. Fairly full mouthfeel, above average effervescence. Pretty drinkable. Nice hop profile, certainly not an IPA but has a nice Nugget Nectar nice taste."
"Clear and bright ruby-copper pour with nice lasting head and great lacing. Very earthy nose with lots of dark caramel malt and a touch of fruitiness. Lots of pine sap in the taste complemented nicely with roasty, caramel malts and a touch of biscuit and molasses. The balance is great, with a nice bitter hop bite coexisting with the sweet malt. This one definitely improves as it warms. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy and resiny, but creamy smooth at the same time. A very drinkable beer from a great brewery."
"I poured this beer almost three minutes ago and the head is right where I left it, two fingers aloft, a craggy tan heap of foam. The body is dark and hazy, mostly mahogany with reddish edges. The aromas and taste are amazingly well balanced: a difficult feat considering how aggressively bold both its hops and malts are. On both the nose and the palate, sweet brown sugar is what I initially detect before a powerful citrusiness asserts itself. Layers of caramelly malts and pine resin battle it out on the palate. Orange zest and burnt sugar linger long on the finish. Very full-bodied, hefty as hell, and thoroughly gratifying."
"Taste: More bitter than I expected from the nose which comes off as quite sweet. Slightly bitter up front but balanced with a nice caramel sweetness. There are even some chocolate notes that combine with a grapefruit oil character that gives it a real big roundness. Very balanced. Creamy chocolate caramel finish with a little grassy bitterness which is nice."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a clear dark copper with a red hue. Carbonation is about average and produces an off white head that starts out big, then fades to a conservative thin layar. I get a big hop/malt combination in the nose, some citrus, caramel, toffee, toast. As for the taste, I get loads of dark caramel malt. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a good balance of hop bitterness. A very good Red ale/Scottish ale/IPA, three of my favorite style's."
"Drinkability isn't bad, but this ultimately wasn't as special as I hoped. At several dollars more than a sixer of Racer 5 I find myself thankful I didn't buy a six pack of this beer. If I had to choose, next time I'd just reach for the Racer 5. They taste very similar anyways."
"Frothy and creamy texture, surprising for a red but Bear Repub makes it fit. It's a dry, medium body brew that does seem filling."
"A (fat) bastardized amber ale, with a hop tumour that got a wee bit out of control. For a self-styled hophead such as yours truly, this is not a bad thing. Good, good stuff."
"Nice work but BR. They seem to love hops as much as I do."
"D - An excellent example of the style and beer that I will buy over and over again."
"This is one slammin beer. It has a bit of everything and it blends well. Would get again for sure."
"D - Overall a very drinkable brew. A tasty medium bodied brew and if you can get over the sediment at the bottle once the brew sits it is a really good brew. I recommend it and would have this brew again!"
"D: overall this amber was above average and drank quite well that had a decent hop kick. This brew makes a good session beer."
"On tap this past weekend at the Yard House Dedham. Served in a slightly chilled pint glass. Dark brown to auburn colored body. Thin white head. Some lacing. Smell was piney and a bit like butterscotch. Taste was good, lots of malt like a well built amber ale, but it was also much more hopped than I expected. Like other Bear Republic beers, this one is definitely hop forward. It was good, but be warned if you are looking for a red session ale. Also, at 6.8%, it packs a bit more of a wallop than other amber ales. A good beer if you are looking for a hoppy red ale."
"Another good production from Bear Republic. Very enjoyable."
"Bought as a singleton so I could give it a try, I'm now sorry I didn't buy the whole six pack. very drinkable, I highly recommend yet another excellent, hoppy brew from Bear Republic."
"Overall, this reminded me of 6 month old winter yulesmith. I was not able to finish 6 oz of this before I dumped it. Way to malty and shows faded hop flavors. Not for me."
"I had a sixteen ounce draft of this last night at the Amsterdam Ale House on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Either I really like the bottle version better or the keg of this wasn't very good but in general this was a disappointment. Very cloudy in color, so much so that I almost sent it back. Very malty, a little lower on hops than the bottle version. Tastes stronger than it actually is. I'll try it again but I was surprised by this one."
"overall: really good beer red IPA is what you could call this it does remind me of arrogant bastard ale but these 2 do have plenty of differences. very good Bear republic always makes damn good beer."
"Overall, the initial sweetness is cut expertly by a finishing dry balance. Like a dewy deep-woods summer morning that turns to crisp sunshine in the afternoon."
"very drinkable, Low A score overall wonderful american red! the way they're supposed to taste!"
"HV"
"Bills itself as an over-the-top Americanized Scottish ale. Pours a rich mahogany with a two finger head into a Corsendonk glass. Deep canidied fruits, brown sugar and grain on the nose. Taste is just a bit of sweet maltiness up front with loads of hops in the middle and on the back end. Definitely much drier and hoppier than an actual Scottish ale. Nice long finish. I remember having this beer for the first time years ago being new to craft beer and it kind of scared me away a little at the time. Just a little too much going on for me then. Now it tastes like something I want on a nice fall night when the weather is just starting to turn cold."
"Some tropical notes show up in my mouth, in all their bright sugary delight at the front of my tongue. I pick up some white grapes and mango. Good first impression. This subtle, delightful start is quickly stormed by the deeper sweetness of vanilla frosting & dryer wholegrain muffins. A wide middle here, safe to say that this is a full flavored beer. Hops come rolling back to the battle in the throat. Although there's some age on this bottle (too much age, actually), I am hit by some rolling fresh grassy hopiness. this big earthy berth is all kept moving by a gorgeous helping of the large carbonation bubbling that prevents any filming or cloying. It all comes rolling to an end with a nice harmony of vanilla pudding and earthen hop that lingers on the back of the tongue. Well done from the crew in Healdsburg. Although it's a pretty burly beer, it still reads as clean and suitable even for the hottest of humid days here in Philly. Maybe I've docked a few points unfairly due to this bottle's age (very difficult to discern, plus it's been some time since my last tasting), but overall I am still a big fan. I'll definitely come back to sip on the Red Rocket again soon."
"D- I'd say its got some good drinkability...its different from other ambers I've had...maybe a little more bitter and less sweet. Good beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"D - With the residual sweetness and a really well-balanced, strong hop bitterness, good body and great taste, this is highly sessionable. An excellent brew."
"If you have a buddy who likes Scotch Ales, give him a bottle of Red Rocket and enjoy the expressions."
"T & M - ...Until the glorious moment when you taste this beer. A lightly peppered spiciness mixed with a great, bitter hoppiness. Has a little bit of citrus at the finish that smooths out this whole experience. A really strong Red Ale, a definite recommend."
"Drinkability -- Quite interesting. Probably wouldn't have sought this out on my own, so I'm definitely glad I got this as an extra. It has great roast malt character, but the hop profile really overwhelms. This is a bitter BEAST. Tasty, refreshing, but a little too unbalanced to come back to any time soon."
"Holy fruity! Explodes with bright juicy flavors all over the place. Fantastically quaffable. The standard for a tasty hoppy red."
"The review cops tell me I've got to have at least 250 characters here, so I'm writing more."
"D: A very drinkable beer for almost any occasion. Yum."
"Deep reddish and copper color colors with a light haze and unfiltered look. Pours with a one finger beige head and great lacing throughout the quaff. Light floral and fruity hops with noticeable caramel malt notes. Notes of biscuit and roasted malt with medium mouthfeel. Great balance with malt up front and a nice hops finish."
"Huge thanks to BigBry for the hookup - an awesome trader!"
" Deep red with a very small cap of off white head. The lacing is spotty, and the body is polluted with yeast and hop particles through out. Don't get me wrong, this is still a decent looking brew. The aroma is a home run, sweet grains and caramel are at the forefront, and hops of an earthy nature are chiming in quite loudly. Fruity with spice, and a spritz of citrus are how the hops make them selves known. A strong malt nose is there to sweeten the deal that allows the alcohol to go by with only the smallest evidence. The taste is what makes this a red ale even more than the color. A strong flavor of unfermented malts and caramel are coating the tongue. Make way for the bitterness to help balance the load. The hops play a key role in the balance of the taste. Not to bitter not too sweet. Hops and grain are playing nicely together. The body is also a nice characteristic in this amber. I really dig the way the carbonation feels in the mouth...light. For such a sweet ale I think the body remains thin. I could see my self putting back more than one in a sitting, no matter what the weather is."
"D-This was an interesting experience to say the least. It was a pretty solid beer, but there's no way of knowing how fresh it was. Overall, not a beer I'm likely to run out and pick up a lot of anytime soon."
"D: Very drinkable. Good flavor and nicely balanced."
"Tried this after trying Bear Republic's IPA, decided I want to sample other offerings from this brewery. I was not disappointed. Appearance: Beautiful deep red with yeast sediment visible when I hold it to the light. 2 finger head, nice lacing at the beginning but eventually fades. Smell: piny hops. Taste: piny, citrusy hops throughout. Mouthfeel: Very little carbonation. Due to its intense hoppiness, I probably wouldn't have more than one in a sitting but I'm only just now learning to appreciate hoppiness."
"D- Could definitely have a few bottles due to the lower ABV, medium body, and great balance of hop/malt flavor."
"22oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint at 50 degrees. Poured a dark, hazy amber with a loose, one inch off-white head that disperses into a thin, frothy slick. Only some residual specks of lacing adhered to the glass during the session. Huge malty nose - some caramel/toffee notes, as well as chocolate malt and a hint of citrusy hops. Not at all what I expected; aromas are very consistent with an American Barleywine in my opinion. Taste follows nose - the barleywine quality definitely holds up in the mouth - maybe a little more rounded out, but this is supposed to be an American Amber after all. Flavors culminate in a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a lively carbonation. A very tasty brew, but flavors lack the crispness I've come to associate with the style. A very respectable beer, but just exactly what I would consider style consistent."
"Great pour, dark reddish brown, definitely something I will be getting again due to the reasonable price. Overall I was very satisfied."
"If this was in Indiana I'd have this stuff with me at all times. Could make several nights of this. Too bad cause this is friggin addicting."
"Overall I would never have blindly guesses this to be a amber/ red ale. It is very good none the less, and reasonably priced."
"There is a decent amount going on here for me - I don't generally drink Red Ales, but I'm quite happy with this beer (and Bear Republic, in general). Definitely worth a try if you like your ales hoppy, yet not one-dimensional."
"Big malty beer with a ton of hops, can't beat it. These folks for years have been making solid reeb's and seem to be in the RR shadows, pretty sad because BR is one of the better breweries in Sonoma County. This is an over the top red, but it works becase of the smooth malty-hop balance. Big up's....go hounds!"
"Another winner from the boys at Bear Republic!"
"Medium body, medium carbonation, slick and smooth texture. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Not a bad beer."
"Another great brew from Bear Republic, well done and balanced."
"Good drinkability. I could knock back a couple bombers of this easy."
"Really a terrific beer. This is the first offering that I have tried from Bear Republic, and it definately leaves me wanting to try some other offerings. Good stuff"
"The Red Rocket Ale pours an amber color with a nice frothy tan head. Good clarity and the edges seem to shine in the light. Not much retention is seen. Aromas are sweet with lots of brown sugar. Some caramelized malts are present as well. Taste is much hoppier than the nose. Plums and toffee flavors also flare up. A very well balanced and smooth drinking beer. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and thin bodied. Drinkability is quite high in my opinion. Taste is very smooth and enjoyable."
"D: A well made Amber is a thing of beauty, and this is one of the best, most complete examples I've ever had. While not an outrageously exciting beer, the Red Rocket Ale is extremely well crafted and comes with high scores and high recommendations. Bear Republic is one solid-ass brewery."
"D - Not extremely drinkable for the style, with it's 6.8% ABV, but very delicious. I could easily drink 2-3 pints of this regardless of the higher ABV, I definitely recommend this beer, also I suggest letting the beer warm up a bit to release more of the aroma/flavors. Very very good, my first from this brewery and I can't wait to try there IPA. Cheers!"
"D) A good brew. Pour me another."
"Overall, alot different than I expected stylewise, and more flavorful than expected. The scotch ale character makes this one very unique, but the unforgivable hoppiness doesn't allow it to steal the show. I could blast off with a red rocket ale anyday."
"Drinkability: I really like this one. The beer has the right amount of hops and I really liked the aspects of a Scottish ale. Take Belhaven and mix in an IPA and there you have it. Beer with character."
"Another great beer from one of America's best breweries."
"If you aren't a big fan of strong flavored IPA's, but still want to taste some hops, I'd recommend trying this one. I enjoyed this one so much I had another two!"
"D - A very tasty red ale with BIG flavor. I really like how this one manages to combine big hop flavor with great balance. Another very solid offering from Bear Republic."
"I will buy this again soon- delicious and very drinkable."
"Nice deep brown in color with amber hues. A finger of head with a strong pour. Excellent smell of toasted malt, raisins and a light booze aroma. Palate is a malt and hop balanced melody with an underlining of alcohol. Nice toasted, bready malt comes first with a warm, bitter follow up. Very nice mouthfeel that soothes and warms. Drinkability is good but one is quite satisfying. Absolutley worth a try."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a small head. Smell is mostly of hops, some notes of citrus. Taste is a hop bomb, all hops, little else, finishes bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not a bad beer, but just a bit to much hops for me."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a hazy reddish brown with a finger of off white head. Big citrus hop aroma with some malt sweetness. Solid medium body. Good malt base with a nice hop presence. Some bready and caramely malt. Very drinkable. I usually stay away from amber ales, but this is a top notch example."
"D - Drinkable. A beer I wish were more sessionable. This stuff's real good and I'd get it again."
"D: Good beer a pint at a time, it finishes pretty sweet and then the hops kinda show back up on the palate. Not the easiest drinker in terms of ""session"" beers but definately a good beer. If you were going in terms of style this beer would suck, but you need to understand what ""west coast"" amber ales are all about and this is a pretty good example (says the guy from ohio)"
"Yet another 'R' beer. Pours very dark red, can't even see through it until held up to the light. Hazy sediment visible. Head is thick and creamy and leans more towards beige than off-white. Leaves nice lacing. Not picking up much for smells, very faint malty smell with maybe some grapefruit. Definitely getting the Scottish ale feel here. Malty bread, booze, aggressive hops, pine. Mouthfeel is smooth, carbonation is spiky on the tongue at times. Nice tasty finish on this one. An interesting take on a red ale."
"to be savored and not wasted."
"Pours a nice, deep amber color. The head is creamy, disappears rather quickly, and has some nice lacing. It smells sweeter than I expected. I pickup the caramel right off the bat with a hint of vanilla and then start to smell the citrus of the hops. Upon tasting, it starts with hops and finishes with a slightly sweet malt character. It didn't taste as sweet as it smelled. The hops aren't too bitter but the taste lingers for a while. It seems to be carbonated well for it's style. All in all, it was a tasty beer that I'd try again."
"Bear Republic is a great brewery and I do enjoy many of their beers. O.K., this is a Red Ale, but it doesn't taste like a typical red ale. The malts don't dominate and the rye and hops really helps to keep the malty sweetness at bay. Worth checking out."
"Medium-heavy body. Soft carbonation. Very smooth, creamy drinker. This really struck me as like a junior version of a Yakima Twilight or Arrogant Bastard. Easy drinker."
"This is probably my new go to beer. It is well balanced and tastes amazing. Great hop presence and bitterness. I could drink this everyday."
"Really great beer. If I lived where it were available, I would try to always have some of this in my beer fridge."
"Very drinkable beer and easy to have a few in a sitting."
"Pours a nice brown-red, bordering on mahogany. A nice white head and plenty of lacing. The nose has plenty of citrus and piney hops along with some nice dark amber malt and accompanying sweetness. The taste is similar, with a lovely bitterness as well as nice herbal, citrus, and caramel flavors. Moderate body with excellent drinkability."
"a perfect example of a west coast amber. tons of hop flavor but a sweet malty amber ale. i love and want to drink many of them."
"D - Very tasty. smooth and malty. Excellent red ale."
"Highly drinkable because of its great balance and pleasant mouthfeel."
"A satisfying, hoppy red ale. Whatever the style origins, this is a nice beer with a lot of flavor. It's aggressively hopped, a sweet blend of citric, floral and spruce notes. The malt brings some deeper caramel flavors, toasty sweet bread and burnt sugars. There's a good yeast flavor that dries out the finish beyond the already dry tone of the beer. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit oily with hops. The beer looks great, carmine liquid with a thick layer of off-white foam. Bear Republic makes good beer."
"Bear Republic makes some buxom, bodacious brews, and Red Rocket is no exception. Well-proportioned ale here."
"Very drinkable, well balanced beer."
"D- A nice red ale that can go down fairly smooth and quick. This would be a better draft beer than a bottled beer. Get this on tap!"
"Pours a reddish brown with two finger head that takes forever to die with lace patches. More IPA than red ale in the aroma, as minimal caramel malt is subdued by a citric, floral hoppy smell. Very dry feel as the hops are powerful in this smooth, slightly creamy medium-bodied beer that has some caramel sweetness and a slight toffee feel. Hops are noticeable in the backend with a crisp and dry backbite. A typical red with extra hops that makes for a great sipping brew."
"Gave a bomber of this a try last evening, not sure why I have not had this one before as it has been readily available for a long time. Brew poured to a nice darkish red color which also had a brown look. Nice sized medium colored tan head that had good retention and lacing. The aroma showed off a nice amount of hops but also a solid malt presence that gave it a somewhat sweet character, an inviting aroma. The flavors for this brew are very nice, hops clearly come out to play and are prominent but there is a very nice malt flavor of caramel and roasted grains that really provides a balanced mix. The hops seem to give more of a pine like flavor than citrus, IMO. Nice amount of carbonation and finishes on the sweet side. A very nice beer, one that I will get again."
"All in all, it has an awesome hop profile backed by an abundance of flavor and strong malt backbone."
"Nicely done. A good brew."
"D: A very good beer, the label puzzles me ""a bastardized scottish ale"" and lots of hops, which makes no sense at all. This definitely falls into the amber ale category, but on the hoppy side of the spectrum. I like this beer, I am very glad I tried it, but I don't think I would purchase very frequently. Definitely worth trying if you like hops."
"D - Very drinkable a flavorful beer that showcase the best of hops."
"Poured into a goblet with a ample two to three fingers of light tan head, good retention, with nice lacing. Color was a dark garnet/ruby color, relatively clear. Citrus hop aroma with grapefruit primarily, roasted malt presence as well. Taste is very balanced with a good bitterness provided in a more piney flavor, with some chocolate/coffee hints on the finish. Feel has some chew to it, with good carbonation and minor alcohol warming. Very enjoyable and drinkable, would be easy to put a few of these back in a session."
"It has a very burnt porter taste...not quite what I was expecting. There's a mild nuttiness to it. Nothing that really stands out, though it's a solid brew."
"All told, Bear Republic's Red Rocket Ale is my favorite Amber/Red Ale I've had yet. The hop character really brings it to the forefront of the pack, without knocking you to your knees. A flavorful, drinkable brew that exudes quality."
"D- Do you really like hops? Then you'd probably enjoy this beer. But honestly I like hops, and I'm feeling a little ambivalent about this beer. There's not much balance and there's some odd flavors."
"Whatever it is, this is a truly solid beer. Not an everyday drinker for me, but an excellent choice while contemplating its, and life's, complexities on a rainy/snowy day."
"Overall- A scottish ale this is not. I'm glad the bros classified it as they did."
"An outstanding red ale"
"d- really drinkable, this is an above average red ale with alot of both malt and hop presence, a welcome change up from all the ipas that i've been drinking as of late."
"Poured into a pint glass. Solid, amber appearance with very fine carbonation. Malty aroma that's not too overwhelming. Tastes just great. A definitively full-bodied American amber...very American. This beer embodies my idea of what beer should be: full and equally balanced ingredients. Quality brew."
"This is an absolute must try for any beer lover, my first sample from Bear republic - and a stud one at that. The brew tastes great, looks great and is very drinkable - what more is needed."
"D - meh, could take it or leave it."
"Pours a cloudy amber in color with a thin white head. The smell: lots and lots of citrusy hops with a little bit of malty sweetness. The taste is mostly hops too, with some roasted malts as well. Good drinkability although one or two of these is enough for me."
"This is a full bodied thick beer. For sure. It is also surprisingly bitter. There is no aftertaste, sweetness forward and a clean finish. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is good. Bitterness serves as palate connector between the front sweetness and the clean finish. Beer is not dry at all. A good brew all around."
"drinkability: i love this beer. it is one of the most sessionable i can think of. full fresh flavor, fairly affordable, and a nice mid range abv."
"D: Medium-bodied beer for sure. The bitterness is more abrasive than hoppy. After it warmed up slightly in my hand it gained a sweeter end. Nothing shocking here, a well made beer. Recommend."
"Taste is what its about. All kinds of hop flavor on this one. Some citrus, pine, tobacco and something else I can't put my finger on. Beer is good from beginning to end. Not too challenging, but very rewarding."
"M/ D - Bottle notes it is a hopped up Scottish Ale. Great hybrid brew, with complex balance of pine, grapefruit hops and deep caramel malts. Med, chewy mouthfeel."
"The malt is toasted and slightly smokey. There is plenty of hoppy bitterness, mostly piney and slightly citrusy. There is a lingering bitterness on the palate. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. A nice, easy drinker from Bear Republic."
"D - This is a great beer that manages to be refreshing even with a solid malt presence and sweetness. This is one balanced beer and one to always have on hand."
"Red Rocket is Bear Republic's malty version of their Racer 5 IPA (See My Review), another reliable expression from this admirable brewery."
"Bomber. Pours nice amber with malty citrus aromas. Great hop flavor and full bodied. They never cease to amaze me as I've had this one many a time. The BR never seases to amaze me with their ""everday"" brews. I recently had their Mach 10 and thought what a great IIPA it was, but how great their regular bottled line was in comparsion. I wouldn't age this one, but never turn it up when it comes about."
"Finishes moderately well at 6.8% ABV, but, although unique and a solid offering, not as omnipresent as I expected."
"Bomber bottle a bargain at $3.99 from DeCiccio's in Ardsley, NY. No bottling/freshness dating info. Pours a dense dark shade of ruddy, red infused dark amber. Under a wonderous mocha head, that at once is dense, then puffy, thick film, leaving ungodly amounts of thick and I mean thick sheeting, and every imaginable type of lacing..fine looking beer! Rich nose of pine infused hops backed with hints of whole wheat bread crusts. Flavorful and bold brew, loaded with rich notes of sweat caramel and toasty malts quite nicely balanced by herbal, piney and biting hops. Rich and regal. More high quality beer from California's BRB"
"The first punch is an herbal bitterness followed closely deep pitted fruits, like plums and fig for sure. There is also a kind of edge to the sweetness within the malt that reminds me of blackberry preserves. The malt also contains big toffee and caramel flavors that linger on the backend of the profile. The mouth feel is thick and malty, and very good all around. I was slightly underwhelmed by the lack of hops, but overall this is a really nice and certainly bigger red ale that I wish I could session."
"Pours a dark red/crimson with a fluffy white head that has quite a bit of retention and lacing. Tons of yeast and other bits floating around. Unfiltered, indeed. Smells sweet, some resinous pine and some prune/plum/cherry action. Watery front, not the kind of malt backbone that I look for in a red ale. Lots of hoppy pine notes though. Lots of carbonation I'd have it again, but I think I prefer Green Flash's Hop Head Red."
"Poured into a tumbler it forms a thick 1 inch tannish head that stays around leaves a fair amount of lacing. The appearance is dark amber and cloudy. The aroma is mainly of floral and spicy hops with perhaps some citrus. Malt does not come through in the aroma for me. The taste is delicious, strongly hopped up with moderate to strong bitterness and roasted malty sweetness. The feel is full bodied with a clean bitter finish. It's a very pleasant and refreshing ale."
"Scottish Red gone wild. OK, so it is hybrid style which makes it an American Red by default. Regardless of what the style is it's one hell of a flavor-packed brew. High level of maltiness is curbed by a substantial hoppiness and smoothed out by the bottle conditioning. American Real Ale at its best here."
"Love this beer, so very much."
"D - Really nice layered and balanced drinking experience."
"Mmm... very tasty, a little bit of rye here as well, some rich maltiness as well. Finish is a bit boozy but it's ok. Not too much hoppiness. Awesome beer, seek this out!"
"D: Very drinkable. Don't let the complexity of this beer scare you off. It is well worth it. I love this one!!"
"I'm not a big fan of amber ales, but this one started to sway my mind. It was full and filling with a light bitter taste and complex flavors of spice. Mouthfeel was nice and heavy, drinkability ok."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"another solid beer from Bear Republic. not my favorite style, but all around great brew. this is the best (and hoppiest) red i've tried to date."
"12oz bottle. Poured cloudy, reddish brown in color. Thing white head, good carbonation. Smelled heavily of malts, sweet. Taste was pretty average. Bitter, maltiness, and dark fruits. This was a beer I've been wanting to try for a while and it was a bit disappointing for me. With the appearance and smell I was looking for more taste than I got. Pretty light on the mouthfeel as well, another thing I was wanting more out of."
"Nice deep orange body with a solid-long lasting head. Aroma is dominated by both sweet malt notes with hints of raw sugar and great floral hops that almost throw a bubble-gum note in just for good measure. Flavor is very strong on the malt up front and then is balanced by a strong citrus hop bite. Mouthfeel is good and complements the beer well. Drinkability is also good - this is always a temptation to by when I visit the store."
"define session for me! This is Sunday NFL session."
"D - I bought this beer expecting it to be a hopped up amber ale...which it didn't lack in the amount of hops...but it follows the label of ""bastardized Scottish ale"" as the bottle states"
"There is no hint of the almost 7% in sight, and the complexity is great. Aside from being a bit heavy in the stomach, this is a killer brew."
"Heard this one was a good amber, been meaning to try it for a long time. Poured a very dark red, darker than I would have imagined with a one and a half finger head that leaves heavy lacing down the side of my glass. Smells of a lot of hops balanced with some good malt sweetness, it definitely has the aggressive Scotch (malty) character they talk about on the bottle with some alcohol in the nose. Taste is very well characterized by the strong nose. Hops and malts are balanced up front and lead you to that strong scotch taste that is hard to describe. Some alcohol kicks in later in the beer, but is not overwhelming. Hop character is pretty big in the initial and after tastes. I kind of like the scotch (malty) taste in this beer also, its not too strong but gets the job done, adds an interesting element. The taste seems to stay true for the whole bottle. Mouthfeel is a bit more light/watery than I would like it, good carbonation and a decent amount of warmth from the alcohol. Leaves a hop coating on the tongue that compliments the alcohol and malts well. Would like it a bit less watery and thicker. Drinkability is good, tastes good, not a bad price from BR, alcohol and hops seem like they would take this one over after a few, probably will buy this one again if I wanna try and session it."
"D & Comments. This beer is insanely drinkable, the balance is uncanny. Probably my favorite red ale."
"Lingering bitter finish."
"Poured a deep, reddish brown with a moderate head that faded to a nice skin. The aroma was hoppy with a little malt as a backdrop. The taste was in line with aroma; hop citrus, not too bitter with just slight sweetness. Bitter showed itself as an aftertaste. The feel was medium bodied with a good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Good, satisfying effort from Ursine Nation."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a chestnut brown color with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is citrusy (grapefruit) hops, caramel malt, and a bit of brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, I can taste citrusy (grapefruit) hops and caramel malt, along with some nuts and bready malt. There's also a slight bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and goes down easy. It wouldn't be hard to drink a couple of bombers of this in a session. I'd buy this again in the future, I thought it was a good brew. Recommended."
"Poured with only a little, one finger head. But the color of this beer! The lacing on this beer! The lace hangs around in thick, coating, broad sheets. Not like the thick, foamy, sticky rings of an IPA. Very nice lacing. The smell was good, hops are there and so is the malt but nothing that made me say, ""can't wait to try this beer."" That thought entered my head after upon gazing at the finished pour. Pale malt and red cream soda in the smell and taste. A little honey to back it up. Not getting any caramel as other reviewers noted. Very malty like sweet red candy, half cinnamon, half cherry. Mouthfeel is thick, carbonation perfect, silky and creamy. Great Red Ale!"
"Poured a dark red/amber out of the bomber. The tan head was quite creamy looking. Lots of caramel/brown sugar malt scents. The hops scent was also fairly present, but not as strong as previous reviews I've read indicate. The taste also lacked the strong hops I was hoping for. I saw no freshness date on the bottle, so it may be that my bottle was not exactly fresh. The store I purchased from has some good beers, but is more tuned for macros and cheap wine. Taste was pretty balanced, but tilted more toward the malts. Has a somewhat creamy smoothness to it. This was decent, but I was hoping for more. I'll have to revisit with a bottle in which I'm sure of the freshness to see if that is an issue, or if my palate just doesn't appreciate this beer."
"- Very drinkable, just the right balance and carbonation with very unique and good flavors. Certainly a great Red."
"Drinkability- Awesome, It was delicious and I will drink it again."
"Found this as Folly Beach Brewery, which is not a brewery at all. Bear Republic does not fail me yet again. What makes this amber ale so nice if the abundance of hops. Excellent mouthfeel, great hop finish. Smooth and easy to consume. Grab a bomber of this if you get the chance."
"pours a deep chestnut color with a decent head and a beige ring thru-out its dark and looks delicious ... the smell is carmel malts and lots of hops maybe a little rye again it looks and smells delicious the taste is the same its a palette pleaser with hops and lots of them and some real nice Carmel malt its very well balanced very smooth... the mouth feel is full and robust.... the bomber i have is disappearing quickly as i write this ...overall its recommended if you like hoppy malty brews this is a red but it has hints of pale ,ipa scottish and brown ales in it ..its good"
"Poured from the 22oz'r into a pilsner glass. Reddish color and a tan creamy head looked fantastic. This beverage reminds me of what would happen if Killians were to grow up. Hoppy nose and smooth taste combined with a medium mouthfeel made for a delicious brew. Drinkability was also good. A keeper."
"Notes: Red Ale... With memories of some brown ales and there is a sense of that bastardized Scottish style red ale that label proudly explains. It began on a weak note for me, and while I did not quite find the complex range of flavors or excitement described by others, it is sure a nice brew, and it grew in enjoyment as I was having it."
"D: All of the above combines into one helluva session Red Ale. Very, very well done, BR."
"Drinkability: This could very well be the best red ale I've ever had, not only was the appearance cool with all the yeast floating around the bottle, but the hop profile packs a huge amount of juicy grapefruit qualities that is balanced perfectly with a modest malt kick to make this a sure fire go-to red ale. Highly recommended for hop lovers and even those who love their red ales!"
"My new mission is to find this beer on tap."
"It's heavy and rich and hard to get through the large bottle. At second glance, there's about two inches of yeast in my glass - hard to drink that! Definitely bottle conditioned!"
"Pours a dark red/brown with a medium sized very persistent off-white head. Aroma is big citrusy hops - grapefruit. Some sweet caramel malt is also present. Taste also has plenty of citrusy hops. Significant rich malty sweetness rounds out the flavor. A little pleasant bitterness in the finish. Balanced and very tasty. Great full bodied mouthfeel. Overall a fantastic strong hoppy amber ale."
"Taste: Nice hop bitterness that stays throughout but while there is the hops there is also a nice toasted malt taste that is only present for a moment. I don't taste any of the citrus that I smelled initially but still very good."
"This is a rich beer. Good drinkability, but a bomber is about enough for me. Really nice unique ale. Wouldn't mind this one again."
"Honestly I viewed this brew as said Red IPA, for as an Amber/Red it is a bit over the top in the hops department."
"Notes: I had a microbrew within the past week that did more justice to the style, was smoother and more drinkable. It seems to me that the left coast breweries like to hop everything in sight. Of course I know that hops are part of an amber but, to me, they are supposed to be secondary to other tastes. Next up is the XP Pale Ale. I sure hope that it is not overhopped like this one."
"Drinkability: Not your average amber. This is a great beer. I love finding an exceptional example of a style that is usually pretty boring."
"A nice, balanced beverage."
"MF/D: Nice carbonation, thick body, loooong dry bitter finish that kind of throws me off, but I'll take it."
"Overall-wow...all I can say, lives up to the hype and then some. Fantastic and worth a try."
"This beer pours a pours a slightly hazy mahogany color with a an and off white one finger head to it. Head retains rather well coming to a film that stays the whole beer and leaves nice thick lacing on the glass. Nose is of sweet malts and a major array of hops - citrus, floral, piney. Taste is mostly bitter - citrus, pine, floral, a touch of grassiness in there, all complimented by a fantastic malt backbone. Alcohol is somewhat present, but certainly does not detract form the beer. Medium to full body, higher side of medium carbonation, thick, creamy, and just hit the freaking spot! This is a fantastic beer that is full of surprises. It's definitely one to sit with for a while."
"Pours deep red with big rocky, meringue-like head that is oh so gorgeous and just won't go away. Nose is sometime tame with faint citrus and caramelly aromas. That caramel is certainly present on the palate along with an unexpected complexity of hops that actually reminds me of some of Bear Republic's other beers. This one is easy drinking and full of flavor for a ""mere"" red ale."
"D: Its very easy drinking and I am glad I got the chance to give it a go. The bad part is that it just didn't live up to what I expect from what is supposed to be a hoppy red. The aroma is spot on for me but the flavor is just too balanced for me at times. Still very good and an interesting take on the style that shakes it up a bit. Very enjoyable."
"I like this ale alot. Bear republic is becoming one of my favorite brewers."
"D-I think that the smoky malt throws me off. Otherwise this is a really good beer."
"Not sure what they mean by bastardized Scottish red ale (I suspect it's the hops), but it works for me. Not my favorite style, but a very nice offering, yet again, from Bear Republic. They make great beers, available, at least in Oregon, for a very fair price."
"Get some now"
"Pours a deep red color with brownish hue. Hints of hops and rye on the nose. Taste isn't too big, it's just potent enough and is absolutely delicious. Has just the right amount of carbonation which effervesces on your tongue and throat as it goes down. Higher than average ABV, but still very sessionable in my humble opinion."
"Drinkability - Only 1 or 2 of these for me, this is a great beer though."
"D = This one is versatile, even though it has a strong flavor, its still a good beer for many occasions. I will probably add this to my favorites list."
"Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. This was very well balanced between the malt and hops and amde for an enjoyable and refreshing treat. Another impressive offering from BR."
"M&D- The mouth on this is nice with a medium feel and a bit of carb which I think works perfectly. The ABV is 6.8% which is a bit higher than most reds but the alcohol is completely hidden. I would knock back 1/2 a sixer easily. This is good stuff, get some."
"Perhaps the best ale I have ever had, fully rejuvenating my faith in ales. Compliments a pizza perfectly on a warm summer day. Aside from the clever name, this beer delivers everything. Crisp taste that sits beautifully on the palette; I really don't think I have had a better ale. This is the first Bear Republic beer I have had, and I have to say, I'm fully prepared to taste everything else they make. Based on the Red Rocket, they might rival some of the other powerhouses, like Stone et al."
"D: Unfortunately, my notes on this one weren't that great, but I can say this is a good beer. Malts are certainly on center stage, but that is appropriate for the style and I am not suggesting this is an overly malty beer, as it is not."
"This has to be one of the best tasting beers I've tried in awhile."
"(Reviewed 7.12.09)"
"This is certainly the most aggresively hopped amber ale or ""bastardized Scottish"" style I have tried. This is typical of this brewery. It is well worth trying. At 6.8 ABV and the very strong flavors, this may not be the ideal session ale. It is very flavorful, none the less."
"D- Overall a very solid sessionable Amber Ale."
" A hearty beer i would love on those slightly chilly winter nights in Florida."
"D: While not a sessionable beer, still one of the best Amber Ale's I have tried. Another great offering from Bear Republic."
"D- Truly a special beer, there is no replacement."
"Drinkability: Finished the bomber faster than I would normally, and wanted another after it was tapped out. It is a little filling I'd imagine with much more (I did have it with dinner so tough to say) but went really well with some barbecue. Overall, solid and enjoyable red with not too much bitterness or complexity, but tasty and with a clean finish."
"Pretty damn complex for the style, and an all around great beer. It's like a citrusy, yet subdued, barleywine. Definitely drink this Bear as fresh as possible."
"Very drinkable brew. I picked this up in a convenience store outside OCMD on route 50 on a complete WHIM, and boy, I'm not disappointed. Paid $5.50 for a 22 oz bottle, and it was an absolute steal in my book! Cheers!"
"D - Refreshing and clean. I could easily have 2 bombers. Very good stuff."
"Picked up a bomber of this in a recent trip to California. Pouring into a mug results in a hazy dark red (bordering on brown) with a crazy amount of sticky off-white head that stuck around for a while and left lots of lacing down the glass. Not a very powerful smell, maybe some muted malt scents. A very deep earthy flavor presents itself when tasted, with some malts and hoppy flavor at the end. Never really had a red ale quite like this."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0906-Dan"
"D: This is a delicious, balanced big beer from Bear Republic. I've been a huge fan of their beers thus far, and this is cut from the same cloth. It's hard to pin down the actual style - it has elements of an amber ale, an IPA, and even a barleywine. An excellent beer."
"On-tap at the Big Hunt in DC. Grabbed this one and then the Double Rocket right after. Both were delicious. This one's your standard big amber ale - huge spicy caramel malt deliciousness. Nice looking amber color, big nice fluffy head. Well-balanced, spicy pepper along with citrus fruitiness in the hops. A really tasty beer with a solid body and good carbonation. Almost sessionable (but for the slightly high ABV), but either way, one I could drink all night."
"D: this is another buy. As stated earlier, one of the better Amber/Red Ale's I have had to date. Bear Republic is growing in my book of favorites. Get a hold of this a try it. I would like a little more hop presence but for what this beer offers it is a nice union of hops and sweets"
"D- This Red was a damn-tasty treat! i wish i lived in Cali, would drink it all the time! The creamy goodness was irresistible as i finished the glass way too quickly, yet enjoying every drink!"
"This is much too easy to drink and though I am not a huge Amber fan, this is worthy of being in my garage man-fridge anytime!"
"Notes: This is an excellent red. Creamy, toasty, caramelly, earthy, hoppy. All the flavors work in perfect harmony with each other. They say it's a ""bastardized Scottish ale," but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a Scot that turns this one down."
"Morey's Bottom Line: An impressive offering from an unfamiliar brewery. Not my favorite style, but quite obviously a well made brewski."
"Pours a brilliant deep ruby color that is crystal clear with a thin tan head that remains atop the glass and leaves nice lacing as you sip. The Aroma has a resinous piney hop aroma with some bready, toasted malts to follow it up. The flavor has more hop flavor upfront with some dried fruits and ends up sweet and with a lingering citrus bitterness. Its a medium bodied beer that is slightly sticky. I'm really glad the flavor came through for this one because the aroma was just a little boring. Tasty Malt Beverage."
"The taste follows the nose, although there is less oily hop than one might have expected, but plenty of thick bittering leafy hop, a slightly syrupy chicory red malty ale, some ABV throaty burn, lots of residual hop oil on the tongue, and an aftertaste of a slightly charred and smoky malt. This is a good beer, but not entirely suited to my tastes. It does make a statement and the palate of flavors is quite full."
"D - VEry good, easy to quaff dispite the size."
"Another impressive beer from Bear Republic. I look forward to seeing more of their brews in Colorado soon."
"Keep barstardising, Bear Republic!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp light brown with a nice thin diminishing head. Aroma is nice blend of citrus hops and sweet malts with slight caramel. The taste is a nice amount of pine hops and caramel malts that both linger nicely on the tongue. The beer is medium bodied with nice carbonation. This one is certainly enjoyable, but not as good as its hoppy brothers Racer 5 and Hop Rod."
"The mouthfeel is solid. Not thick or heavy to me, but substantial. This is not really a ""to style"" beer for any style, bt a great beer nonetheless. This is the type of beer I don[t wan't to pair with food, but just enjoy it by itself."
"Very impressed for my first beer from bear republic."
"This one ranks number two in its class I believe. I would agree with that, but this just is not my favorite style of beer I guess."
"22oz bottle $4.49. Deep red color, chestnut almost, creamy yet short off-white head. The smell is ""sticky"" and a little sweet to my nose, maybe its malts? Flavor is pretty good, I think there are hops but they seem to be layered under a chewy maltiness. Overall, this was a good buy and a good value."
"Red Rocket is a rustic ale. It begs to be enjoyed in a dark quiet bar in the middle of the day. There's nothing cheery or sweet about it. There is no doubt that this is a beer."
"taste is thick, dry, malt, spice, caramel, roasted nuts, brown sugar, and hops in the back, ends nicely bitter."
"this beer is hella awesome. pours an purty copper/red with a sticky head. smells malty, toasty, light hops. taste wise, strong caramel malt scrappin with some intense hopping. full bodied and slick, filling. a great brew. i could drink these all day. and probably will."
"D= exceptionally drinkable"
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle picked up at the Beer Stop for $4.50. Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass, Red Rocket appears a hazy crimson/amber color with a good two fingers of dense cream colored foam. A great looking pour! Nose consists of sweet caramel malt, citrus tinged hops. Tastes of bitter citurs such as lemon and orange, caramelized malt, medium toasted grains, a touch of bread and grass. This red falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with ample carbonation for it's style. A fantastic red ale. If you dig this style, by all means, seek this one out."
"D - I'll have to get this one again!"
"Drinkability is above average for this one, despite the higher alcohol content. Great session brew in my opinion."
"I am truly impressed by this brew! I am quite surprised at how fast I am going through this 22oz bottle of frothy goodness. It's really amazing how much more character this version of the American Amber offers versus some of its counterparts. A great beer for fans of the style. I traditionally think of American Ambers as a ""you know what you're getting"" type of beer. This one through me off in a good way."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a good beer some flavor complexity and a lot of substance that makes it worth drinking for a long time."
"I would love to do a blind tasting of Ambers with this beer in the mix. I know Nugget Nectar is the Godbeer in that category, but Red Rocket and Hop Head Red could easily top it, in my book. I'm curious as to which would come out on top."
"Overall I was very pleasantly surprised with this one and had no idea the marks would be so high for myself as well as for other reviewers."
"looovvveee it."
"D: Nicely balanced between sweetness and bitterness. I would definitely buy a six pack if I was hanging out with friends."
"A darn good beer."
"Overall, not my favorite style, but this is one of the better ones I've had. Still, 7-8 times out of 10, I'm picking up Hop Rod over this. Here's to variety!"
"D - This is a big hearty beer. It has tons of flavor and at 6.8 % abv it packs a nice punch as well. This is very drinkable, as the flavors are complex but balanced. The carbonation is just right for a beer this big."
"I can't see having this as a session ale but it was an excellent single bomber indulgence. Will most likely enjoy this with a meal next time. Well recommended."
"Notes: This is such a very drinkable beer massivly smooth. Such a remarkable year round brew. Cheers."
"This is a solid amber. Balanced well and easy to take down. The ABV is up there, but it's well hidden."
"Red ales are not usually my beer of choice, but I loved the other Bear Republic brews that I tried so I picked one of these up at Bauer's in Boston. As soon as I got home I poured the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a very dark brownish color with a thick tan head. Hold it up to the light and the glass reflects a brilliant dark red color. This beer has a very malty scent with hints of piney hops. The taste is similar to an IPA but much more dark and with a much drier finish. The beer finishes with a dry, grapefruit bitter taste. This is not my favorite Bear Republic brew, but is definitely worthy of a try. I will buy this again, however it not on the top of my list. As far as drinkability, don't bank on having this as a session beer. My session beer preference has to include somewhat of a refreshing aftertaste and this doesn't exactly fit that criteria. This would be great with dinner, especially with red meat; perhaps a fat steak. Since it's 6.8% ABV, a couple with dinner would be perfect."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours a slightly hazy amber/brown with a super creamy tan head. Superb lacing all the way down. Smell is slightly of roasted malts. Taste is rather hoppy for a red ale, nice solid bitterness, with toasty, roasted malt. A hint of diacytel and coffee in there too. Mouthfeel is super creamy, very nice carbonation. Good Bottle conditioning going on here. Super drinkable, even at nearly 7 percent abv. I will definitely get this again, another great one from Bear Republic."
"Incredibly drinkable and smooth with how much flavor there is."
"Drinkability: Hops blast off. Red Rocket Ale is not for the faint of hop-heart. It's too hoppy for me, but it may be perfect for someone else."
"You need to pour it rather aggressively to achieve a good head, if too slow the head is slim to none. However when it's there, it's thick and bubbly. It disappears pretty quickly and leaves only some lacing, but still enough to enjoy."
"There are a lot of world-class micro breweries in the state of California so it's easy to see how Bear Republic can get overlooked. That said, there is no reason they ever should be! This brewery offers a lineup as solid as any other within the state, or even the country for that matter. Bear Republic makes only one kind of beer: great ones."
"The aroma has tea, prunes, caramel, citrus, pine, and fruit. The appearance is deep amber with a nice head. The flavor is like the aroma with a bitter sweet finish. The palate is average. Overall this is a very very good beer. I would love to have another one."
"Quite tasty beer. Too bad Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster is so good otherwise I would get this all the time. But, it's also not available in GA yet."
"Pours a a nice deep copper, red color. Thin tannish head to it, nice light, but prevalent, lacing on the glass. Aroma is very hop filled, oh joy. Taste is amazing... a nice chewiness to it and great mouthfeel. Very drinkable, especially for the pretty high ABV. A nice citrus taste to the hops as well, along with some caramel malts. Ranks right up there with Ithaca's Cascazilla and Troegs Hopback Amber Ale... not sure if it's better than those two but it's close."
"Gorgeous deep red with a lasting, silky head. Some of the best balance of sweet, delicious malts and bitter hops that I've tasted or smelled. Mouthfeel is smooth as glass. The bitterness at the end keeps you thirsty and reaching for another sip. Highly recommended."
"Overall: It was a great beer that my roommate picked up as a random pick. Definite re-drink and re-purchase. Top 10 if not top 5 beer."
"Pours dark copper with burnt red hues on the fringes. A two-plus finger, extremely bubbly, dark tan head tops the brew, slowly fades, and leaves a thick web of lacing behind. Aroma involves a good mix of earthy hops and caramel malts with some sweet bread in the distant background. On the palate the malts slowly succumb to the oily hops which rise to the forefront toward the end and really reach out and hit on the way down the throat. Mouth-feel is comparatively thick, but viscous, and highly drinkable, with a furtive 6.8% abv. Not my favorite Bear Republic brew so far, but not bad."
"Bear Republic has made the gold standard by which all other Amber Ales should be judged."
"a good one for this rainy sunday afternoon - pours out nice with a creamy 2 finger head - aroma is earthy and bready - color shows up more brown than red, maybe due to the dreary day - tastes just fine with a nice balance between thick malt and hop finish - just noticing some sediment in 2nd glass - no worry - some head remains w/ decent lacing down the glass - this one's a winner - wish i had another to follow this one with - good stuff"
"Deep red, almost brown in body with large milky off-white head that leaves plenty of lacing. A full aroma of malt, hops, bread, and some black pepper, and earthy undertones. Thick, viscous in body with assertive flavors. Earth, some dark fruit in the background, cloves, hops that give off an almost minty sensation through the center to the finish, biscuits, beautiful light note of caramel at the end. One of the best brews I've ever had. A great balance of malt and hops that could please nearly any beer enthusiast."
"I'm quite impressed once again with Bear Republic. Fantastic beer."
"Overall, still a great beer that I would go back to anytime."
"A very good ale which I recommend"
"Recommended to both the malt heads as well as there arch rival those pesty hop heads, who are always wanting more..."
"Pours a clear, dark amber color and appears a lighter amber along the edges. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops first, then some slight spice (all spice), and then some sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber/Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp. High carbonation level and a noticeable dryness. Tastes strongly of hops up front, then some spice (all spice?) come through, and finally some slight sweet malt in the finish. Overall, a very well blended brew."
"drinkability is good because this beer is great."
"D: It is not quite as drinkable as others in the style. The hops which give it a much better overall taste for the style, also cause the drinkability to be reduced."
"Thick, creamy head, more like suds than bubbles, light red-brown color to it, good deal of lacing. In the glass the liquid manages to appear more red than brown, about as dark as red gets, that said, remains mostly transparent. In the nose the malt scents of cocoa and brown sugar have trouble finding their footing, just about the same for the raisin, cherry, apricot fruit, the big blast of bitter hops, white pepper, straw, cut grass and tea leaves, doesn't integrate into a whole. Medium-bodied, similar experience in the mouth with kind of flat-footed carbonation not helping organize the gang in one direction. The hoppy bite creates rye, raw grains, pine cone, grapefruit and orange citrus flavors while likely at the same time contributing to its arch dryness and diminishing the enjoyment of the former. Caramel, cocoa and brown sugar can't sweeten things up much. At times it seems ego-driven, showing off for no real reason. Has the elements to be a superior quaff but without a real game plan it's just a workout to finish the glass."
"Good for a couple of glasses but it's a bit too rich in malts for my likes."
"Overall, a fantastic American amber beer. The flavors aren't particularly strong or overpowering, but everything fits together into a very smooth light beer that is great anytime of the year from summer through winter. Highly recommended."
"D: This is an exercise in proper serving temperature. Drinkability and smell increased significantly with warming. This is a solid beer and a session ale all the way."
"This is a very easy-drinking Red Ale. Interesting balance of burnt toasty malts, dark fruits & bitter hops."
"D: A overall and all around good beer, if just a little ugly. Would like to get my hands on this beer straight from the tap at the brewery, as I'm sure it would be out of this world, this one seems to have lost a touch in the ways of hopiness for this bottle at least."
"Taste has a very nice blend of hop which is not overpowering and a silky smooth malt. Mouthfeel is full and slighly chewy. Just like the other Bear Republic beers this is a very drinkable and deliciuos brew."
"pours a deep, slightly cloudy, ruby-red copperish color w/ a very thick, frothy white tinged with yellow head that stands a full 1+"" or so above my goblet and never really settles before completly coating it with a thick lace : a strong piney hop aroma with some faint notes of dark fruits and phenols ; taste is also predominated by citrusy hop flavor, a strong initial hop bite that is balanced by only slightly by a rich bready, toasty malt base w/ a faint buttery/caramel undertone ; a med-full body made creamier by the abundant co2 levels ; a damn fine red ale, very drinkable once you get past the gargantuan everlasting head..."
"This could easily be my summer go-to beer, I am impressed. The hops is in-your-face but as you drink it's nicely, albeit subtly, matched with the malts. At 6.8% you drink a couple of these and be rockin' for the night!"
"D: I love this. It is simply delicious and i'll drink it any time of year."
"Pours a dark brown reddish color, dark white head, average, diminishing. Very pine hoppy aroma, some alcohol. Sweet, slight grapefruity smell. Sweet taste, slightly syrupy. Taste of pine. Slightly heavy body, bubbly, good mouthfeel. Okay."
"Overall a good beer. I will definetly drink again at some point."
"very drinkable, probably just behind evil dead red on my best west coast red list."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. I thought the beer looked really great at first with a nice black color and fine bubbles in the head. The taste was hoppy with a taste of caramel involved. The smelll was hoppy just like the taste. I would most likely try this one again though a little hoppy for me."
"The beer pours a dark amber brown almost reddish color with a big bubbly head over it which left lacing on the glass only toward the end. A mixture of sweet malt, fresh grass, and citrus hops compose the aroma. Bitter through and through on the palate. Initially a sweet maltiness provides some balances but it never breaks through completely. By the time the beer smoothly glides toward the back the bitterness has grown and finishes with a tad of resinous pine. Overall this beer is quite drinkable and enjoyable. One of the better Amber Ales I have had the pleasure of quaffing."
"Picked up a single at the Party Source in Syracuse for a couple bucks. Whoa, big head here. After it settles down, the caramel aroma was a bit rubbery, possibly old. The flavor has a dry caramel sticky bun malt profile with a big punch of grapefruit and orange rind hops. The dry malts and big American hops make a satisfying, yet drinkable beer. I want more."
"Overall: I honestly don't understand what people see in this beer. I know it's supposedly the first of its kind, but to me it's far too one-dimensional. My favorite beer style is Altbier, so it's not that I can't appreciate a good, bracingly bitter beer. It's just that a good, bracingly bitter beer needs something else to balance it out, and I'm not finding it here. I have a feeling I'd love Double Red Rocket, but as it is this beer simply seems unfinished."
"Now, a little about myself: I grew up in Healdsburg and have been drinking this stuff since I was 16 years old. Yeah, I'm a little biased. :)."
"I'd drink these for sure, It's a drinkable red, although it's more of a bitter IPA. I do like and will but it again. It will be a spot buy though."
"D- Drinkability is hampered by the bracing bitterness, which hides almost all of the other flavors that might be lurking beneath it."
"Notes: Another terrific offering from Bear Republic. The best American Amber that I've had. The nose and the taste is great, but it's just not one that I could drink all night. But, for an every once in a while thing, it's great! Highly recommended"
"D-This is a real treat. Drinkable, hell yes, maybe one of the best all around balanced American Ambers I have ever had. I am aghast it took me so long to get to this one as I have always been a fan of Racer 5 for a hops fix. Passing this by on the shelf I just figured this was another hophead beer, but not so. Not to malty, not too hoppy...just right, for when you are in the mood for this kind of balance. Big taste without the big ABV....what more can I say... A great find, and one that I am going back for...alot!"
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, very smooth, almost silky. Nice drinkablity. Relatively low alcohol and really nothing to complain about. Very good beer."
"12 oz brown bottle picked up at the Charleston Beer Exchange. Cool Buck Rogers style retro rocket on the label. Pours a dark reddish brown with a thin off white head with little lacing. The smell is of deep roasted malt and caramel with a nice hoppy aroma. The taste was smooth and malty with hints of brown sugar and spicy hops in the finish. This one is a keeper."
"One of my top rated active bottled beers for style."
"Overall a solid and hoppy amber."
"TM & D - Very full bodied amber with lots of hops. Drank a Fat Tire right before this one and they are not even the same style. I took a lot more time with this one. It was delicious with really big complex flavors. I'll get this again."
"A: Upon opening a sitting bottle there was some overflow, thick cottony and rocky head that is still present after 5 minutes, deep amber brown - 4.25, S: Lots of toasty nutty aromas, mild hops - 3.75, T: The hops are more noticeable on the palate than the nose, piney bitter bite, quite a bit of caramel - 3.75, M: 4.00, D: I like the considerable hops and the toasty flavors, a solid beer all around - 3.75"
"Drinkability: Not an everyday beer, this one fits a specifc bill when wanting a surprising british style red with a unique hop backbone."
"this one is kind of a cross between a big ass wee heavy and a hoppy american amber/red. color is right between the two-somewhere between a deep amber and a chestnut brown. nice light tan head persists w/good lacing. slightly hazy. big aromas of dark malts, molasses, dark dried fruit, and grapefruity and resiny american hops. taste follows suit with surprisingly rich sweet malts and big, smooth hop bitterness. almost full bodied with a long, drying finish from the hops."
"Generous hopping unfortunately leaves more slickness than I'd like and the hops also cause this to be a bit of a palate-buster. However, if you had to stick with a single beer for an entire evening you could do much, much worse than this."
"Hops seem a bit tame and faded, further convincing me this is not the freshest example. Still, it's full-flavored and very tasty. Will eagerly try another bottle some day."
"D - This beer was more complex than I expected out of an Amber Ale style, but Bear Republic again delivered a great beer"
"Thick and rich and goes down smooth."
"The taste, which gets better as it warms, is a complex blend of caramel-amber malts and piney hop resin. The malt notes unfold slowly, revealing brown sugar and sweetbread, while the hops come on strong at the finish with lots of restrained bitterness and a hint of pepper. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, with a semi-creamy/spicy consistency and a near-perfect carbonation level. Drinkability is top-notch, too, as I could eagerly go through another bomber of this stuff without batting an eyelash. Bear Republic rarely disappoints, and Red Rocket is no exception."
"The beer poured a deep red brownish color with a billowing head that left lacing all the way down my pint glass as I drank this excellent offering. The first smell I got was of those piney-grapefruit hops. It was surprisingly sweet with a bitter finish that lingered that told me to have another big sip. Red Rocket was definitely a hoppier beer than I expected but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it as much as I did...being that I'm not a huge hophead. The beer had a nice crispness with a decent amount of carbonation. It is a beer that definitely can knock you on your butt if you don't pay attention to it's smooth 6.80% abv. I think I'll have a couple more tonight."
"Pours a dark red brick/amber color. Pour creates a dense, tight light tan head with superb retention throughout. A good amount of lacing curtains the sides of the snifter. Terrific aromas of roasted malts, toasted bread, brown sugar and caramels initially shows its sweet side. Aromas show, as does the flavors a great balance with crisp hoppy citrus, spice and floral notes from the hops also filling the nose. Mouthfeel is full, round and smooth with a bit of oiliness. Flavors start sweet much like the aromas with caramel malt, toffee and brown sugar quickly followed up with a firm but moderate hop bitterness with citrus and pine coming through. Definitely one of the most balanced bigger amber ales in the market."
"This one pours a reddish brown with an off white head that fades fast and leaves lacing. The smell is inviting with a nice mix of hops and malt, with plenty of sweet notes mixing in. The taste starts sweet and malty and moves to a hoppy flavor quickly. It finishes sweet and the sweet battles the bitter and wins out. The mouthfeel is nice, a smooth beer with a medium body that has a nice flavor balance. The sweet isn't overpowering, and the higher ABV isn't noticeable. This one is an easy drinker, could see it getting annoying after a few, but the flavor is distinct and delicious. A great beer worth checking out!"
"The drink is juicy and succulent with a fullish body and fluffy, creamy carbonation. Highly drinkable."
"Glad to see these west coast beers making into NC. My first experience with Bear Republic. It won't be the last."
"And very drinkable. I could have another Big Boy."
"D: Ridiculously high. Almost too high. This is easily one of the more sessionable beers I've had in a very long time. If you're looking for an extreme beer, keep looking. If, however, you're looking for a well crafted, session beer, that you can savor, and linger in it's complexity, look no further."
"Drinkability: the 650 mL bottle was nice, and about all I wanted"
"D: The one bomber is certainly the limit, mostly on the strength of the beer. The flavors are balanced enough that it would be possible to drink several if not for the inevitable stumbling and bumbling."
"(rated Feb 8, 2008)"
"Pours a clear dark amber brown color with a huge fluffy tan head that left some nice lacing as it settled. The aroma is of a sweet toasted malt with hints of red grapes; a bit vinous. The taste has a nice and smooth toasted malt, honey, and a grassy/earthy hop bitterness. I also pick up a touch of coffee, unexpected. Nice malt body with good carbonation, good balance between the sweet and bitter. This is a very good amber ale. I am not a big fan of the style but between this and Nugget Nectar they do the style some props. Red Rocket doesn't have the splendid hop profile like Nug Nectar but still is quite good."
"Pour is a cherry-wood red with a tan/white head. Aroma was a mix of hops, pine, and herbs. The taste is what this beer is all about. Big hoppy bite with an underbelly of malts and some honey/nutty flavors. I can easily say this brewer is becoming one of my favorites."
"This was a drain pour. Why all the hype? Bear Republic does amazing IPAs and Stouts, but this is just not enjoyable in the slightest. Maybe I got a bad bomber. Bummer."
"D: Good, interesting beer that I think is pretty sessionable."
"3.7/5"
"Notes from 7/2/06"
"D - This is great; one of the hoppiest amber ales that I've ever had."
"In my humble opinion, the best Amber Ale I've ever had. Appearance is nice copper color with small head and lots of lacing. Smell is great, lots of caramel tones, slightly sweet. Taste is even better, add a bit of hops and dry out the flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body, lots of carbonation. Drinkability is excellent."
"4.5/4/4/3.5/4"
"Red Rocket is one of my new favs, this beer is almost perfect. Unfortunate about the name though."
"I'll be back!!"
"Not bad notmy first choice though!"
"The taste is very nice with a good hop blend and nice malt with a little roasted flavor in the background. The beer is rather thick feeling and easy to drink. Very well done."
"taste had a huge chocolate caramel malt taste, slightly roasted, aggressive hops aren't really there, mostly just a hoppy aftertaste. nice well balanced mouthfeel. slightly dissapointed with this beer, maybe i have too high expectations for anything with Bear Republic on the label."
"Wow this is a delicious beer!"
"D: A real good, rather easy drinking Amber Ale, very enjoyable. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit disappointed though, Racer 5 and Hop Rod set a pretty high standard. Still, another solid Bear Republic offering, I'll be looking forward to trying the Stout yet!"
"Interesting flavors and to me it really wasnt to sessionable. Overall, not my favorite from Bear Republic."
"Even though red ales aren't my favorite style, this beer really impressed me."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a solid beer and a pleasure to drink."
"drinkability : See taste. This may be one of my favorite new beers. The sad thing is I found it in a specialty grocery store and this was the last 6 pack....bummer."
"D: Supremely drinkable...the alcohol gets you a nice buzz but nothing outrageous. Flavors are very nice and well balanced. This would be good any time of the year. I guess I wish it were a bit less bubbly, but I don't think it really detracts from the beer. One of the best in this style that I've had."
"pors a deep amber color and has two or so fingers of head. it smells of citrus and hops. there is a bitter hop taste and also a strange sweetness to it about halfway through the taste, it sort of reminded me of the sweetness in a pink lemonade. weird. the bite of the hops linger for a good while though. it's a pretty light body and pretty drinkable, a little odd though."
"Overall, this is a medium bodied very hoppy and flavorful red ale. Bear Republic does not disappoint."
"Smoother and more flavourful than most of the ambers I've had. If you don't like Fat Tire or American Ale, maybe you should give this one a shot before giving up on the Ambers."
"Overall my opinion was that this beer didn't do it for me. I mean it was an ok brew but thought it would be much better and it didn't live to my expectations."
"A big Red Ale and nice tasting. The heavier body and high ABV limits drinkability."
"This beer executes on all phases. One kick ass brew here - I will be hording some more on my next trip to the store."
"Overall: This is a solid brew, but I have had other amber ales that I find better, most notably Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster and Lagunitas' Lucky 13. This beer is more on the lines of Troegs Hopback Amber. A good beer, but not the best I've had of this style."
"Red Rocket looked great in the glass, a really cool amber red color. I didn't pick up much in the smell. It had a somewhat hoppy taste, but the hops weren't too overpowering. I liked this one but wasn't crazy about it, which is likely due more to me not enjoying the style than to the beer itself."
"d. Strong for a sub 7% abv ale, with a very present alcohol taste. That being said, it's very enjoyable to actually drink - something a lot of strong amber ales just don't quite manage. The mouthfeel combined with the strong hops and malts make this a red ale excellent. Definitely worth experiencing."
"Poura a deep reddish brown, topped by a 1/4 off-white head. Carbonation is lively. Smell is of hops, dense caramel malts. Taste is fairly deep as well, more malts dominated by piney hops just keep coming. Also tastes like there might be some rye malts in there too. Very nice mouthfeel, somewhat silky. A very enjoyable Red Ale, as they seem to be few and far between."
"Bottle / Artwork - Simple crayon inspired red rocket and font on a cream colored centerpiece on an otherwise black label..."
"A tad too much bitterness for my taste. Still a quality red ale and one to look for."
"D - I finished the bomber without a problem and look forward to having some more from this brewery in the future."
"This beer looks almost red rust, red wine, and some kool-aid. Very spongey, airey head right ater the pour, but the dissipaton is swift before I even take a sip. The aroma is like pouring hop syrup over a just opened bag of rice, white bread, and fresh crushed mint. Mint and orange peel hit the palate first. They hang on tight throughout th whole sip while herbal tobacco and biscuit notes meld with the hop resins. Palate is chewy an has a long, slow lingering bitterness. Pleasantly bitter red ale. Would love to try this beer on tap."
"D - Good, really smooth, and easy to drink for a 6+ ABV."
"Pours an opaque reddish-brown color, with a fluffy cream colored head that leaves a generous lace with each sip. The big aroma here is a bold floral hop, with sweet malt and maybe even a bit of apple as well. Upon first taste, the bold hop profile was the first thing that I noticed, with buttery and caramel malt flavors in the background, and a slight warming alcohol presence at the finish. This one is a bit heavy and sticky on the palate, but finishes easier then one might think. Not something you'd want to pound a 6'er of in one sitting, but a damn fine brew in it's own right. This one can stand toe-to-toe with Arrogant Bastard any day in my book."
"Pours out a highly carbonated red brew with 2 finger head. Smells of sweet malt smells mildly hopped.taste of sweet malt and fairly hopped up. I was surprised about the hop content. Mouthfeel is nothing special. This is a very drinkable beer will definitely buy again."
"A dark, deep ruby red color, almost a brown color. A small light brown head forms on top, dissolving away to a film. A strong malty fragrance with a sweet fruity aroma. That is followed by a light grassy scent, blending to a mild citric aroma the end. A rich malty, caramel sweetness at the front of each taste. Then a grassy, tobacco flavor follows. It then blends to grapefruit bitterness at the end. A full to medium bodied feel, a rich to smooth feel, slightly slick midway, it leaves subtle dry finish at the back of the palate. his is a very good to great tasting beer, this is a solid beer all the way through."
"Pours a ruby red brown in color with a nice inch or so of off white head. Smell is caramel malt and some hops. Taste shows more of the hops, but there is enough malt to balance it out. I'm also getting a bit of spice. I'm really enjoying this beer. Bittering and non-cloying on the tongue."
"Appearance is a dark raisny plum color with a nice thick frothy tan head. Nice sticky lacing and there's always a decent head lying on the beer. Aroma is of sweet hops balanced with a nutty malt flavor. There's a very strong ""deep"" nutty malt aroma here that I'd expect from a Belgian or a complex sweet stout, which I really enjoy. Taste predominantly comes from the bittering hops- at first a bit overwhelming (I'm not a hophead..) but it goes well with the light rum and bready tones of the malt. Also a very strong hop aftertaste, both from the bittering and flavoring hops, with a slight dried prune taste. I'd say that the mouthfeel is dead on- smooth up front and in the back with a nice peak in acidity from the carbonation and hops in the middle. I'd say this might be a little more drinkable on draft and it gets more malty and bready as it gets warmer. Overall very nice."
"M/D - Full bodied and very creamy. Just enough carbonation to give it a little bight. Very drinkable."
"D- I usually do not like opening bombers by myself; I like sharing them with friends. I am very glad no one is around on this one; its all mine. I love this beer! Too bad I cannot get Bear Republic in GA yet. Hopefully it will come here someday soon!"
"Drinkability: One of the better ambers out there, this one's darker than usual, which makes for an interesting drink. Abv% is, of course, manageable and well hidden. A very well-made, drinkable, tasty, big red - recommended."
"D: One or two pints is very nice. Very rich satisfying beer."
"Decent, but too much hops for me."
"A tasty, hoppy version of the venerable red/amber ale. I like this style when it's got a bit of a hop bite, so I'll be coming back to this one."
"drinkability: nice"
"D - I love the hoppy reds you get the best of both world hops and sweet malt that come together to make one fine beer worth trying"
"This beer was picked up at Green's in Greenville, South Carolina recently, and the pour looked a lovely shade of burgundy, and was capped by a dense but smallish head. The smell was citric hoppy, with undertones of red apples. The taste was tart, bitter, slightly peaty, and very hearty. The flavors were strong, but beautifully complimentary, and it was hard to put it down for typing this review. The mouthfeel was creamy and soft, and the aftertaste showcased the flavors ina slow fade. A beautifully crafted symphony, this was a very enjoyable experience while is lasted."
"Overall I was pretty impressed with my first Bear Republic tasting. I would certainly drink this again."
"A nice and enjoyable beer. Not my favorite of the style, but it will defiantly work."
"Its a very nice dark copper body with lots of red hues. The head is a large dirty tan rocky lace monster that does a great job leaving loads of art work on the glass. Smell is piney and citrus hops in a carmal malt bomb. Also get some light floral and grassy notes. The taste is a good bitter hop hit up front riding a very forward carmal/toasted malt flavor with some nice pine and rind flavors coming through. This one is more full bodied than medium and realy has a luxurious feel to its slightly chuncky body. Its a big beer but drinkable, however 22oz in one sitting is plenty for me at least. Overall another very very good beer from Bear Republic."
"Taste and smell was dominated by malt but well balanced with plenty of hops. Overall a good beer with good drinkability, could have another any day."
"Overall, Bear Republic Red Rocket Ale is another solid brew from Bear Republic that is worth a shot."
"Drinkability: I held off tasting this beer as I never get very excited by Ambers; in this case, I was mistaken"
"Pours a deep, clear, copper red with huge dark beige head that lasts. Smells of biscuity malt and generous amounts of C hops. Light hints of coffee. Plenty of sweet, roasty malt in the taste, juxtaposed by quite a bit of resinous hop bitterness. The sweet/bitter thing works better here than in many other west coast brews, but they still don't really 'balance' each other as intended--it's just quite sweet and quite bitter at the same time. Very slight warming alcohol. Medium body with good carbonation. Not a bad beer, though it's not exactly refined."
"The smell was of deep roasted malt with caramel and a nice hoppy aroma. The taste was malty, smooth and brown sugar like. It left a good hop linger in the mouth and was semi chewy. Overall I found it to be a great ale and would buy again."
"Overall: I'm a borderline beer ADD case though so I get bored of flavours easily. A bomber is enough, then I'd move on to the Racer 5 to finish off the day."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Reston"
"I cant believe I'm love an Amber/Red so much! Consistantly my least favorite style but this is amazing. First of all this may be the best looking beer I've ever seen. The color is a rich, dark hazy amber. Thick, rocky mocha colored head that settles into this amazing creamy head with great retention and awesome lacing. After it settles it practically looks like its been on nitro-tap I swear. Smell is rich of malt, caramel, and hops. Taste is great. A nice strong malty backbone but not to be outdone by the hops. Nice, bitter west coast hops. In a way it almost reminds me of an English IPA (like Drake's IPA) but thats a good thing. Mouthfeel is perfect. It is light and easy drinking yet there is a creamy texture to it that feels so smooth going down. Overall a great beer. Again, I cant believe this is an Amber but it may have reignited my interest in this style."
"D- an easy to drink enjoyable take on the style. i loved how hoppy this one comes off as. id like to have this again sometime."
"This beer pours a beautiful cloudy dark amber with a 2 fingered light tan head. The smell is light but nice a mixture between nuts and malts. This beer's taste has a wonderful mixture of malts and hops, a VERY smooth beer, the malts in the beer are top notch. The mouthfeel as stated is incredibly smooth, almost silky, my only complaint would be a slight dry feeling after I swallow. This is a very drinkable beer, if not for the slight afterfeel it would be a all nighter! Well done"
"D: Well well well. Bear Republic two for two and they are a bit different than others, so yes, I'd get again."
"D: very nice brew. I could have a couple of bombers but that would probably do me in."
"A great session beer. Could definately have a few of these in one sitting."
"a nice red ale with bold hop flavor and aroma, while still keeping things malty and complex."
"I'll be buying more. One of the finer ambers that are out there. And what makes it sweeter is that I'm reviewing this as I sit at my resurrected computer."
"D- Very good, the bomber is a perfect serving to share with a friend or hog to yourself."
"D: A very good beer. A nicy hoppy brew that isn't overly bitter. Not sure if it's a session beer, but I could have a few of these over the course of a night."
"Easy drinking & great with the meal of fresh-caught fish we enjoyed with this bomber. Didn't hit the style for me, falling in the cracks someplace, but damn tasty. I'd take this baby out to dinner any day of the week."
"Pours a cloudy, deep amber color with a small white head. In the aroma, a small citrusy, grapefruity hop. In the taste, grapefruity hops in a dry end. A small bitterness, and a medium to big mouthfeel, with a semi dry citrus hop aftertaste. A nice hop presence and a bigger body. Almost feels like an IPA."
"To put it roughly, it comes across like a crash of an IPA and a scotch ale. And it works in spades."
"D: A great red ale with an edge that screams high-quality. I would welcome a little more sweetness and a little less hoppiness (ala Samuel Adams Irish Red Ale), but all in all, this is an excellent beer."
"D. Oh my, I love this beer! Highly recommended! The drinkability is excellent. Tasty Brew."
"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a half inch of tan head and large soapy bubbles. A touch dark for style, but otherwise an attractive beer. Aromas off this beer are dominated by hops, lots of piney Chinook and citrusy Cascades. Following are notes of caramel, toasted bread, and some diacetyl. On the palate, this is a substantial amber with lots of hop flavor (not exceptionally fresh), malt depth and plenty of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is medium, body medium high. Alcohol is quite noticeable, almost a bit hot as it's a very dry beer. Overall, it's a solid beer, but it leaves me wanting in the malt department."
"The taste is amazing stewed apples and a light fig flavor with very god carbonation that wakes your palate up from the dead. This amber ale has so much going on, it almost taste like a scottish ale that Bert Grant use to make. Another great beer from Bear Republic. I'm glad you can get this ale in six packs here!!"
"Drinkability - Clocks in at 6.8% so I wouldn't want more than a single bottle but is fairly drinkable. I fear my bottle has lost a bit of its intended hop flavor as evidenced by the perceived oxidation so I suspect other reviews may have gotten a fresher bottle. Despite the bottle issues, it's still a good beer if you enjoy high alcohol, bitter reds."
"D - super! Really hoppy red with an excellent maltiness holding everything together. Great mouthfeel. Would definitely have another one and look forward to finishing the bottle. It seems like Bear Republic can do no wrong"
"Red Rocket in The Blue, Red, & Grey."
"All in all this is a great beer. This was my second offering from Bear Republic (1st was Racer 5 which rocks!) And I was really impressed. I would buy this all the time if it was available in RI."
"Each taste seemed multi-layered and complex. I will soon have to pick up the bomber that this comes in to compare between the tapped version I had, and also just to get more of this awesome beer!"
"Red Rocket takes off into the glass with explosive carbonation and portrays a garnet color and tan cushiony foam leaving plenty lacing. Aroma initially opens with sweet hops then settles down with some fruit, burnt sugars, and roasted malt. Wonderful flavors of balanced hops, brown sugar, and roasted malt. No other red ale exemplifies the style so well while incorporating hops into every interaction in the brew to the bitter end - love it. Another amazing beer from Bear Republic - also try their Hop Rod Rye."
"Overall, very drinkable. Delicious."
"Coming in for a beer"
"Plays nice with the tastebuds. Slightly creamy and very drinkable. Fits nicly with the rest of the BR offerings."
"If I wasn't so buzzed, I wouldn't be opposed to having another."
"D - I could deffinitely drink this beer all night... well maybe since it is 6.8 abv. Wither way if you in the mood for a english or scottish ale with a hint of ipa this is the ticket"
"An excellent offering from an excellent brewery."
"D: A very drinkable red ale. I really enjoy the overall quality of this brew. Both the malt and hop aspects are both top-notch, yet still balanced together enough as to be enjoyable."
"I was expecting a bit more from this beer, especially considering the other BR offerings I'd tried previously. Nothing about the Red Rocket was bad, yet nothing really jumped out at me as being great. Overall I felt this was a slightly better than average beer for it's type, but nothing more."
"Special thanks to FlyFisher2782 for the bottle. Another damn good Bear Republic beer, I'm loving this brewery more and more"
"D - Very drinkable, malt-leaning ale. Lots of flavour and sweetness in this might get cloying after a while though."
"Plenty of roasted malt in the nose, plus something very pleasing that I can't put my finger on. Nice balance of malt and hops with a lean towards the malt until the brew slides down the throat, which is when the hops really make themselves felt. Very pleasant. A little under-carbonated I think, which detracts a bit from the body and mouthfeel, but that's a very small quibble in this instance. All in all a particularly good beer that I'd buy again, no question."
"Poured from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Dark brown with a one finger off-white head. Piney floral hops on the nose with mild malts, slight hint of smoke. Head is slow to reside, lacing splotches on glass and stays in place. Getting some smokey malts on the palette with some mild hops on the finish. Low carbonation on this one, thinking it could use some more. Milky finish on this one too. Good brew, expected it to be red. :)"
"Drinkability-staggers along the line between ""session"" and ""what was I thinking?"""
""
"Cheap and easy, just like me."
"D: Drinkability is good on this one but the hop bitterness and heavy body would keep me from drinking too many of these in a sitting."
"Overall, another super good beer from Bear Republic. My local brew store just started getting these in so they're all new and I dig em! I can't think of a beer drinker that wouldn't enjoy this one. Cheers!!"
"One of the few Amber Ales done right. The approach is that of a serious IPA, but with the malt profile found in Irish Reds. It turns out beautiful. A dark mohogany look with a shy, creamy, tan head formation, retention, and lacing. Aromas are a blend of sorgum / barley with a sharp blend of pine, citrus, and herbs. Very clean from the apprearance, through the flavors and aromas, and on into the textures. Bready as if done via decoction mash, but softly sweetened by barley, syrups, and candied fruits. Equally soft in the texture. Though not a Cask Ale, the beer exhibits the constant soft carbonation and creamy mouthfeel better than most from the bottle. A light mint joins the frey in the finish, along with a long, lingering pine / confectionate blend. Very nice Amber Pale, even if a little bite-ey in the end."
"M/D - Light carbonation, nothing too unsettling."
"Big hops and big beers, that's the B.R. way. Thanks for another nailed style."
"Good beer overall, on the 'lighter"" side for an American Strong Ale. Nice once it cools down after a hot day. Not my favorite style, but a nice beer."
"Pours hazy brown with a head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing. Smells very slightly hot and richly malty with some citrusy hops as well. Tastes great. Deep flavors of malt without being too sweet, lots more citrusy hops, and a tiny bit coppery. Very smooth and extremely drinkable with a nice little spicy hope bite at the end but smooth caramel malts as well."
"D: Very drinkable. Very flavorful. Very good."
"D - Easy to drink and a great example of a American Red."
"D - Very hoppy amber ale from Bear Republic that's big on citrus hops. Tasty hop belching ensues!"
"Good mouthfeel, enough carbonation that suits this beer well."
"Overall: Probably a good beer based on its high score here, but definitely not high on my list. Again, to be fair, it's probably more that the beer's style is not my thing, rather than it being anything wrong with the beer."
"The taste is similar. It has a lot of floral-pine and caramelly grain flavours with a little citrus and spice. This full-bodied, pungent flavour nicely accompanies a rich caramel-malt sweetness and hoppy bitterness."
"drinkability is good. this is a big brew with a solid profile and a wonderful aromatic hop quality. almost reminiscent of an IPA in its hop quality. cheers!"
"D: A near session beer. Perhaps it is one. To sum up, Rocket Red Ale has the makings of an excellent beer. The taste and mouthfeel don't quite measure up...yet. But the beer is eminently quaffable and a masterpiece for the nose and eyes. I hope to have it on tap soon."
"Poured a deep beep brown/amber almost black. Instead its amber that is nearly brown. White head is almost more than an inch thick. Nose is piney but little else appears.Taste is very fruity and very citrusy with bitterness taking a backseat. Pretty good Amber at a decent price."
"D: A nice balance of mouthfeel and taste makes this a fairly drinkable beer overall. The combination of a smooth and refreshing beer with a nice hoppy taste, balanced by some malts, makes this beer a fairly interest and nice drinking beer. Pick up one and enjoy a session with it, if you can."
"This one's a little sharp in flavor and feel, kind of raw and pungent...not insanely drinkable, but very enjoyable nevertheless. Unapologetically hoppy, and why not?"
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer, one of the best examples I've had of an amber ale, and a quality brew that will get return visits to my fridge."
"D - Very good, I had a pint with dinner than two more afterwards, and had I stayed any longer, I would've had another! A nicely crafted ale and certainly one worth trying."
"D: On the whole this is a drinkable beer. It's complex enough to hold your interest and it goes down easy."
"Drinkability- This is a really good beer. It has a great hoppy bitterness - perfect for any hophead."
"What can you say? Another solid offering from Bear Republic. Have meant to pick this one up for a few years but never did and will certaintly do so again."
"Bear Republic has yet to disappoint... recommended."
"It had a moderate amount of pine hops up front with even more malt flavoring behind that. Nothing but hops lingering in the aftertaste, but it wasn't too strong. The texture wasn't quite as dark or heavy as any other red I've had, and it was somewhat smooth. But overall it nothing spectacular."
"Overall, this was a great session ale. I was not looking for anything over the top, so I was glad it was the way it was. Nothing special, just an all around solid amber here. Could always be a good call and a great one to just kick back and watch the game with. Would definitely recommend this one."
"D: Tasty and very drinkable. Bomber wasn't too expensive either."
"Lively carbonation, medium body, sticky and long finish. Easily drinkable."
"Kind of reminiscent of some of the Anderson Valley selections where they're so overhopped you can't tell that anything else is there."
"This could very well be my favorite beer, period. I cant imagine a way to improve on this beer. Sticky sweet caramel notes an awesome mouthfeel, big citrusy smack of hops, beautiful aroma & a clean finish and not too much ABV to keep you from more than one. I just stare...at the ruby brown hues... mmm a perfect beer. I think I just talked myself into another case."
"Mouthfeel was excellent."
"Nice body and good carbonation level. Pretty easily drinkable for sure. It's pushing its way up toward and Imperial version of the style but yet not quite getting there I think. I have no problem with that at all. Nice beer!"
"Poured a very attractive reddish/brown color with fluffy white head that hung around for a while. Aroma was citrusy hops with a bit of alcohol coming through. Flavor was citrusy and floral hoppiness. Malt flavor is also there but is dominated by the hops. Mouthfeel is great and this left nice lacing on the glass. Drinkability is good. This is one fine ale."
"It has a pretty full mouthfeel to it for a Red, the carbonation is medium light, and it finishes slightly bitter with some bready tones. Very easy to drink and really satisfying. A top notch example of the style, me thinks. I'm glad I have another bottle but I know it won't be long before I pop the cap on *that* one."
"22 oz. bomber poured into an imperial pint glass. Big, thick, creamy head that lasts all day; heavy lacing. Color is amber-caramel, very clear. Lots of nice hop aroma - piney and citrusy. Initial flavor of caramel followed by tart grapefruit bite. Finishes dry and smooth. Medium bodied mouthfeel and great drinkability on this one. Very much in the west coast style."
"Red Rocket poured a beautiful crimson red that a long lasting white head of foam. The only time the head of foam receded was when I took a sip of beer and every time I did that, it left streak after streak of white lace. The aroma was heavy with pine, grapefruit, bitter citrus hops, citrus fruits and anything else that's related to citrus flavors. The taste was also heavy, but with dried citrus hops, citrus fruits, pine needles, grapefruit, and then all of these citrus flavors ended with a big taste of malted rye. The malted rye was a nice surprise. I was only expecting the taste to be filled with nothing but citrus flavors of all kinds. It was a medium to full bodied beer that had a refeshing dry aftertaste of citrus fruits, bitter citrus hops, and pine. I would be happy to drink this from a bottle. I sure it's just as good coming from a bottle. Another great beer from Bear Republic!"
"D: A nice dry hopped red, clean, but lacked complexity sorry to say."
"D- I loved this beer. Well balanced and enjoyable."
"D: VERY drinkable. This is what I have found I like in an amber ale. The lip-smacking fruitiness that is almost like a fresh, organic grapefruit or something. Very clean and tasty, I'll most definitely be getting this again... and again."
"Pours a nice clear and dark ruby hues brown. Thick creme head. Nose is of piney hops. Flavor is citric, earthy, and has a noticeable zing to it. Calms down as it gets warmer. Smooth feel. Easily drinkable. I expect no less from Bear Republic. A nice one that's much better on the warmer side."
"Good drinkability, especially so with an easy to deal with ABV."
"Beers pours a deep amber with a clear, frothy white head. Very aromatic hops greet the nose with citrus notes. A big malt odor lurks behind the floral hoppiness with a slight metallic tinge the only negative. Oily hoppiness rolls onto the tongue with an orange peel flavor and medium bitterness. The thin malt flavor is overwhelmed by the hops but still detectable during the middle of a mouthful. But when the brew heads for the back of the mouth, a moderate astringency and stronger hop bitterness quickly drown out the malt. The metallic note in the nose becomes apparent to the palate on the aftertaste. I really didn't much care for this one."
"Notes: A really great amber/red from what is becoming one of my favorite breweries. Will definitely have this one again."
"A pretty tasty brew, I wish that there was a bit more residual malt sweetness to this brew; a solid citrus hop character would have been really nice. This is actually slightly tart as a result of the lack of sweetness; this is not bone dry though, there is just not enough malt sweetness to stand up to the hops."
"This brew has a very interesting collection of flavors. It's not an instant favorite of mine but I'd buy this one again."
"Dark rich maroon pour with a big lasting beige head that wouldn't die. Smell was rich sticky sweet malt, and almost rye like touches at times, and a nice vibrant hop blast. Taste was quite hoppy, but suitably backed by a unique maltiness. Mouthfeel was lightly carbonated and incredibly smooth going down. Alcohol is well hidden but pokes out ever so slightly. Nice lacing on the glass too, after the girlfriend and I downed the bomber. This one grew on me more and more as I drank it, and reminded me a bit of their Hop Rod Rye and I'm very glad we get these here in Austin now."
"D: Very good. Nicely balanced and nicely flavored, this is an excellent, quaffable bigger (at 6.8% ABV) Red Ale."
"Probably my favorite of the four BR beers we have here. Probably dethrones St. Rogue Red as my favorite in this style. Awesome brew."
"One fine amber,its a toss up between this and the Nectar.This is the Nectar of the west coast.Great job BR."
"Medium-to-full-bodied and smooth, this is very drinkable. Very tasty, too - nice blend of hops and malt. Pretty intense while maintaining smoothness and drinkability. This is a good one, to say the least!"
"One of my favorite Reds. Big flavor and great drinkability."
"What a great treat. I drank this at cellar temperature and was rewarded."
"Notes: This is a great brew for many reasons. Bottle calls it a bastardized Scottish Style Ale. This brew shows me the diversity of American Ambers, especially those one would call ""Imperial Amber", perfectly. Case in point, lately I've been drinking Nugget Nectar. This brew is categorized the same, but showcases entirely different flavors. Still, the idea is the same; it's an aggresively hopped stronger American Amber/Red Ale. Where NN goes more toward the fruity flavors and citrus hops. This beer brings out the dark, caramel malts and hop bitterness. Very nice overall."
"D: Incredibly drinkable and the abv to match. Ive been nothing but impressed by Bear Republic and this one was right there with the others."
"Overall, a very nice beer: a balanced and rich amped-up red ale."
"This one is on the darker side of the style, along with sweeter aromas and a little more complexity in the flavor compared to lighter beers in the style. This is a great beer to enjoy. Recommended."
"I would have thought this was a little easier to drink, being only 6.8%, but it drinks a lot heavier. It might be the hops catching up to me, I'm not sure."
"D: Extremely tasty with a great balance. One of the best ambers i have. A little extra hops from what is typical, but is pulled off wonderfully."
"While red ales are generally not my bag, this one makes me rethink that. Yet another stellar, stellar brew from Bear Republic!"
"1 Pint, 6 fl oz bottle copped from Gary's in Madison for $4.99... Pours an attractive dark-brown, mahogany hue with a tan, reddish, frothy head that soon dissipated... Nice aroma full of hops, slight caramel, subtle vanilla... smell is persuasive and pleasing without being too cloying or overwhelming... taste strongly complements the nose, with a bittersweet, vanilla and slight caramel essence... this beer seems very well balanced with a combination of slight malts and nice hops... Very clean, clear, crisp, lucid taste... very pleasing, not overwhelming, and easily drinkable with the 6.8% ABV hardly noticable... My first brew from Bear Republic, and I must say that I was impressed with this sample... Recommended to me by an employee from Gary's, I was glad I took his advice to try this one... a very good depiction of the style... Logo sticker claims that, ""Red Rocket Ale is a bastardized Scottish style red ale...""... Recommended..."
"The beer poured a dark red with a thick, smooth, creamy head into a pint glass. The smell was of fresh, piney hops. The initial flavor was of hops, and stayed all the way through the swallow - a wonderfully hoppy ale, with just enough malt sweetness to not be too overpowering in the bitterness department. The carbonation was good, and there was thick Brussel's lace down the glass at the end of the pint. I think I like this more than Racer 5."
"Drinkability is average. A bit different but nothing too exciting."
"This slightly creamy red ale has a great head that actually has persistent structure, almost like a head on a root beer float. Unfortunately, it blocks a lot of the aroma, at least until you drink it down. The color is a deep brownish red. This beer has an excellent balance of malts and hops, with lots of flavor and a nice smooth finish. This is the first beer I'd tried from Bear Republic but I'll be keeping my eye out for other offerings."
"Dark brown with red tints. Aroma of roasted and caramel malts and hops. Flavor is caramel, dry roasted malt, and hop bitter more dominant than aroma or flavor. Juicy malt middle, and a chewy mouth feel lead to a hop-dominated malty finish. Sometimes on tap it is truly divine - perfect balance of west coast hops and chewy caramel malt."
"There is a pretty sweet rocket design on the label, which also informs me that this is a bastardized and aggressively hopped scottish style red. This brew blasts off with a big, billowing, light oragne-wheat head atop the rasberry-amber colored brew. Patches of sticky lace dust the edges of my glass. The nose is the sweetest citrusy oranges blended with sweet, toasted, caramel malts. These carry straight through to the taste where an INCREDIBLE balance of sweet citrus and caramel, light toasted biscuits, and earthy-pine hop bitterness spark the taste buds. Mouthfeel is medium with just a touch of alcohol heaviness pulling it towards full. Big billowing carbonation keeps Red Rocket creamy and fresh. Dare I say out of this world? Okay, enough already. Corny review of a very good brew. Definitely one of the best of the style."
"Got a nice think light tan and fluffy head that covered a dark amber unfiltered body filled with very little carbonation; its got some really good lacing too It has a very sweet and mildly citrusy aroma with some roasted malts and a mild hint of alcohol as well. Its pretty smooth with a good kick of hops and some malts, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste that just dwindles in your mouth for a bit, this is a very good beer to drink."
"Final Note: this is a good beer at a reasonable price, as are most Bear Republic brews."
"Red Rocket Ale is a beautiful dark brown-red color with abundant head. The aroma is plentiful in maltiness and hops. The flavor is full and rich with abundant caramel malt. Hops are present from beginning to end. Finish and mouthfeel are strong. Red Rocket is beautifully balanced and flavorful. It's hard to imagine a better red ale than this one from Bear Republic."
"Man this is a damn fine beer. So tasty I could drink it all night. I hope I see this on tap soon now that it's in PA."
"One I could drink often and often. Hope BR gets to MO/KS someday soon, so this can be more easily had."
"Drinkability: This one is awesome. It hits on all levels. Also an absolute steal at $4.04 for a 22oz. bottle. This would be a top 100 beer if it carried more hype. Bear Republic continues to impress me with its hoppy renditions of an IPA. Well worth seeking out and trying."
"I'm starting to think I'm just not a big Bear Republic fan."
"All in all, a personal favorite that's relatively cheap and relatively easy to find."
"Major kudos to Bear Republic. I'll be sure to try more of their offerings."
"D: If you are a hop head this is a red ale for you. It is not too hard to drink for something that is this aggressively hopped and at this ABV. I would have like it to have more malts to back up the hops but very good none the less."
"I found this to be a nice Amber Ale, the appearance was a nice caramel color, very well balanced aroma of malt and hops. I really liked the taste, it had for me at least, a nice caramel backbone to balance out the other flavors typical of this style. I did find the mouth feel a little heavy for me though. All in all, a nice beer I plan to have again!"
"Drinks a little slow, due the heft of this beer. A solid red/amber, was looking for a little more hop profile. Having said that, I'd put this in my rotation if it were available here. Bear Republic, please come back to CO!"
"This is flawless on the palate (IMO). Notes of smoke, wood, lots of citric hops and sweet caramel malt. Great beer for Christmas."
"Red Rocket Ale is a dark mahogany red with a nice layer of creamy off-white head. This beer is an aggressively hopped west-coast IPA. Its very bitter, yet very easy on the palate...its one of the few IPAs out there I would call 'well-balanced.' Not sure about the specific hop types but its citrus and pine flavors from start to finish. Truly a great beer from a great California brewery which has mastered the IPA [also try BR Racer 5, Extra Pale Ale, and Hop Rod Rye]."
"Overall- By far the best Amber I've ever had! To me its an Amber/ West Coast IPA blend! I honestly think this is a perfect beer!!"
"One hell of a brew. Big red ales that are done nicely kick ass."
"Pours with a light brown, three-finger head that goes slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is hoppy. Flavor is smooth, slight sweetness then a balanced to a hoppy finish. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $4.55 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"I've always loved the Bear Republic Brewing Company (gotta support Northern California brews!), and this is one of their better beers, in my opinion. A totally drinkable brew; doesn't taste like a 6.8% ABV beer. Highly recommended. I'll have another!"
"Wait, this is an amber? Noway, this is way to fun to be an amber! Whatever it is, this is a cool beer!"
"D: Quite tasty with great balance, fitting for a red ale. However, the extra hop kick makes for a different take on the style, and while it could go overboard, it's actually executed quite well."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle. Poured a beautiful deep ruby copper color that had a bit of sediment in it. Two fingers of thick, creamy off-white head formed with a somewhat vigorous pour. Head seemed to last forever, and left tons of thick lace behind on the glass. A sweet malt yet hoppy and fruity aroma permeated from the glass. Taste was just as good but richer. Thick hoppy notes hit the tongue first with a bit of citrus fruit. Tons of sweet malt balanced this beer out and smoothed out the finish. Very little noticeable alcohol. A nice smooth, full mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"Deep copper orange as it pours from the bottle, deep brown orange in the glass and beautiful red against backlighting. The head is fluffy and lasts for several minutes. The smell is nutty, sweet, and hoppy. The hops are definitely present and balance the malt without overwhelming it. There is a nice toasty, nutty flavor that comes through along with a mild sweetness. This beer is well-balanced in every direction. I like it a lot."
"Worth at least a shot, probably more."
"I like this beer but marked down the drinkability because it is such a heavy brew."
"I couldn't imagine a Red Ale any better than this. This beer is very well balanced, but ""over the top balanced"". Both the hops and malt are in your face but beautifully coordinated and very tasty. Pours a reddish amber with a good sized ivory head. Sweet malts and resiny hops are both in the aroma. The head holds up well and this beer leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. The taste is really great. Bitter hops up front, followed by a caramel tasting malt flavor. Finishes with suggestions of both hops and malts. Mouthfeel is very good.The hops are strong, piney, resinous up front, but civilized enough for the full strength and just-right sweetness of the malts. This is a thick, rich, luxurious mothfeel. Drinkability is very good. Not just for hopheads. At 6.8, you have to respect the power of this beer, but I would have no problem drinking a bomber of this myself on other occasions."
"D - It's a winner. I could do a few without getting tired."
"Pours very dark amber with some russet tones in the background. Dusting of a head and some sticky lace. The nose starts out dominated by bright pink grapefruit. That soons blows off, with the remaining notes composed of minty hops, peanut malts and a whisky-like waft of alcohol. On the palate, Red Rocket starts off smooth and sweet, but following a wall of carbonation things get nutty and bitter, with some pronounced tea-leaf flavors. Things taper off toward the finish, with one more blip of juicy hop bitterness, and then the beer kind of lingers on the palate for a while. Overall, this is an interesting beer. Good, worth trying again and all that. Just a solid west coast-style amber."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a murky brownish red color with a thick foamy head. Smell hints at pine but not so strong. Taste malty bitter pine and almost a little candi flavor with a little citrus bite. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. I enjoy this beer its a well crafted beer that is balanced but still in your face."
"Style-wise, this would make one of the tastiest amber ales Ive ever had. The label proclaims Scottish roots  that would explain the beefy malt, body, and sweetness  but I cant detect any of the smokiness Ive come to expect in my Scottish ambers. It doesnt hold itself to be of a particular traditional style, its a happy beermutt  and mutts are almost always more interesting than the related purebreds."
"Bear Republic makes another tasty brew."
"I'd easily have two in a sitting, even with a dozen or so different taps to try. Great beer."
"Its hard for me to justify drinking a red ale. ever. I've just never been a fan of the apparent sweetness and maltiness. This was an exception and I would likely order it again if I ended up in Sonoma county again. The mouthfeel was even, nothing too thick or thin, I could have handled a little bit more in the hop category, though this isn't typical of the style. Not my favorite Bear Republic offering, but nice nonetheless."
"The moutfeel was on the thin-side of medium. This is an extremely drinkable and interesting beer."
"Poured from a 650ml bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a deep brownish amber. It had a huge beige head that whittled down to a constant thin foam. Lots of lacing. The smell was hoppy and piney with some malt in the back. The taste was pretty good but not as good as Nugget Nectar which is still the class of the style for me. Good solid mouthfeel. Overall, a good beer that I recommend trying. For me, it's worth a repeat taste every once in awhile. (4, LR, T, Y)"
"reddish brown (more red than brown) with a tan head that fades and leaves pretty good lace. heavy citrusy/piney smell with a malt backbone that smells like burnt toffee and coffee just a little bit. i like. taste is dominated by piney hops that ride on that same strong malt backbone and provide just a little bitter kick in the end. creamy, but on the lighter side of medium-full. i'll happily drink one of these any day."
"Pours out a rusted ruby with lively bubbles and a tanned head that clings tightly to the glass. Aroma is loaded with citrus and pine hops with some toasty malts. I get some dusty cocoa and mild booze. Malt flavors bring on caramel and a touch of molasses with a cocoa undertone. A bit toasty. There are some fruity esters that are much in line with the Bear Republic house yeast character. Hops bring a lot of grapefruit and a touch of aspirin in the finish. Mouthfeel is rather light, slick, and a bit too mellowed out on the carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but there are some things that grate on me in the time it takes to finish the bomber. Impressed by some things, but overall not Bear Republic's strongest offering."
"D. Loved this beer! So, so many layers! To me, a masterpiece!"
"Drinkability-Really enjoyed this one! Gonna go pick up another."
"Overall-Another bear republic homerun I love this brewery."
"This beer poured a hazy brown color with a thick, tan, rocky head. The aroma is strong of malt and caramel. Hops are noted after the beer warms. The taste is malty and caramel with bitterness from the hops quite noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and seems appropriate for the beer. Overall, this is hearty, well balanced brew."
"What a colossal disappointment this thing was. A Scotch Ale? This? No...no it isn't. Over-hopped West Coast Red Ale of some sort? Yes. This is quite possibly the worst example of this style I have ever had...ever. It poured up a dark bronze red with a nice, pillowy head that lasted for several minutes. It looked good. The smell was almost all grapefruit and pine resin with a tiny bit of sweet malt hiding in the back. The taste, too, was nearly all big hops. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style, I thought. Overall, it isn't a bad beer, it just strays way outside of what this style should be. This is like handing someone a beer blindfolded and telling them you gave them a pint of smoked porter and really there's gueuze in the glass. That guy is about to be in for a shock, eh? Well, so was I. Not a bad beer, terrible representation of the style."
"Could drink a lot of these too, another fantastic beer from Bear Republic"
"It's a little too bitter to drink a whole lot of, but pretty enjoyable."
"Nothing gets in the way here, and this is just an enjoyable little diddy, made for everyday drinking and i'd think quite a nice complement to BBQ or grilled meats in general."
"D: A good Wee Heavy, definitely an American take on the subject, tastes like a Scotch Ale mixed with an IPA, easily drinkable and sessionable, but the high ABV can catch up with you in a hurry, so be careful. All and all, another great brew from Bear Republic to add to my drinking repertoire."
"Pours a medium grade brown ... Assertive firm head ... Has a nice bold hop profile ... lacing is B+ ... Rust, Pine, Caramel - Aroma ... Does contain a appealing blend of flavours, i'd change a few things but a solid offering.. ""Baie dankie"""
"D- solid scotch ale"
"does it fit the style? Oh, I dunno, probably not...now quit worrying about that and drink it."
"Pours a dark tea color with deep red hues, a tad lighter than mahogany, with a big light tan head that resists fading. Visible effervescence keeps the head a live and surface pools of tiny bubbles are generated. A nice amount of lacing observed. The smell comes out a lot more as it warns significantly. The aroma is semi-sweet caramel maltiness. Full bodied, the mouth feel is well carbonated enough to make up for a classically less bitter hop character. Full flavored, the taste is malty, without being real sweet and a deep caramel from a very (very) light roasted nature. Very drinkable, the 6.8% ABV is hidden, but beyond the definition of session-able."
"D - This gets huge marks for drinkability. It's a solidly built beer at an even more solidly built price; I paid about 3.99 for my bomber."
"I've been sitting on this beer since a trip to Southern California in January, little did I know I can now get it locally. The beer pours a clear deep amber, with an almost purple hue to it in this light. Aroma is sweet caramel malts, with just a hint of almost metallic hops. Taste is more of the same caramel, with some dark fruit as well. There is a nice slightly roasty flavor with hints of chocolate malt. The finish is dry, and there is no hint of a alcohol. This beer has held up very well and I wouldn't hesitate to age it for a year or so."
"Good body, and carbonation. Unique, but quite good."
"Doesn't match the style well but a very tasty, drinkable moderately strong beer."
"Nice and creamy, non-aggressive mouthfeel. A very sessionable beer for its 6.8% standing. I'll go for this when I want a completely dry beer without a hop-blast. Reminds me of a milder, creamier Rogue Am. Amber."
"This brew poured a dark redish brown. I feel like making a paragraph devoted solely to the head. The head was completely out of control (in a good way). It was massive and refused to back down. The smell was of grain, hints of coffee and had a very hopped up smell in general. The taste was also very hopped up. Slighty bitter from begining to end. The mouthfeel was fairly thick with a good amount of carbonation. It coated the inside of my mouth and stuck around for a while. This beer was fairly drinkable, definitely one to sip on but all in all a good brew."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer, although I have a feeling it may be a little rich to drink everyday."
"This beer poured a very dark red color and formed a nice foamy light tan head that reminded me a bit of a float. It coated the glass with latticed lace as is slowly subsided. A smalll amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt and hops, Centennial and maybe Cascade. Mostly light caramel elements with a hint of pepper. The flavor was of malt, caramel and hint of the hops as well. The body was medium light and the finish with a touch of bittnerness."
"Very tasty big ass American Red. Hop foward but a hefty malt presence keeps hops in check. This is a great beer that I plan on enjoying in the future."
"D: Good drinkability due to the excellent and well balanced flavors. I really enjoy this beer, yet another great brew from Bear Republic."
"Nice ,handsome ale,brown with red tinges, topped by a gorgeous thick frothy tan head. Good balanced aromas, you first pick up the piney hops but soon a nice caramel malt aroma joins in. Smooth mostly malty flavour at first with the hops appearing much later in the mouthful, mainlly citric in intensity. Though nice on the tongue, this is just a tad too thin for style. Over all a nice amber ale."
"Drinkability - This is a very good Scottish Style Red Ale. Definitely one of the highlights in a long day of beer drinking."
"This is my first ever review.This is my favorite beer! This has been my favorite beer for about three years.I have enjoyed many many great beers over the years and Bear Republic is certainly one of my top five breweries and their Red Rocket ale is my favorite Bear Republic offering.I'm a strong ale fan and this is definitely a strong ale but with more spicy notes than other examples I've tried.The spicy malt is intense as are the the hops and they are in perfect harmony and balance for me in this brew.You MUST try it if you haven't already.No,it's not a session beer at all but for me it is a frequent special treat when I really want to treat myself to the best."
"Bear Republic is an excellent brewery and I've liked (a lot) everything I tasted of theirs, including this one."
"Drinkability? Oh yeah! Yet another excellent Bear Republic beer."
"this seems to be halfway between an amber and a brown. closer to a brown, even"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and goes down so easy. I really think I'd like to session this beer. It's that easy to drink. Carbonation and abv are just right.. Overall, excellent offering from Bear Republic. I'm thoroughly impressed with these beers."
"Pours a really dark red with a huge pillowy head that takes a few minutes to dissipate. Aroma is sugary malts and floral hops, very pleasing. Taste is hops, carmel malts, some fruits and a little roastiness. Taste is slightly cardboard which makes me think this bottle had been on the shelf a little too long. Slightly off tasting aftertaste hurt drinkability a little. Seems like a very good beer. I will adjust this review as soon as I can find some fresher product."
"Had his with a good Stilton cheese, very nice."
"this beer pours a dark, bloody red with a small, cream-colored, frothy head, sinking quite quickly wiht minimal lace. the nose is unbelievably hoppy - sweet citrus, mint, earthiness, etc. - yet well ballanced with some caramel malts. taste is much like the smell, only way more bitter, more of citrus-rind than sweetness, but it isn't overly off-balance and the nutty and smooth malts make their presence known. finish is a little harsh as a sort of syrup develops in the back of the throat. carbonation is a bit on the high side, but a solid medium body. a nice little beer, but definitely my least favorite offering from bear republic"
"As the label indicates, a Scottish ale unabashedly bastardized by a load of West coast hops. It really works. Great and original beer."
"D: A damn good red ale that packs some punch. This beer was very similar in taste with Three Floyd's Brian Boru red ale. Both of which are two of the better red ales that I have sampled. Recommended."
"Thick and fully body. Feels almost like a porter, believe it or not. Fits the deep flavor. A slight bit bubbly. A very fin, solid beer. Quite bitter; very bitter. And good. And STRONG!"
"I don't think Bear Republic could make a bad beer if they tried."
"Another great beer from Bear Republic. A little different than anything else I have had, and definitely worth a try."
"D - Smooth & not too heavy. None of the flavors are overwhelming, which creates a balance that urges you for another mouthful. I love this style and Bear Republic has again brewed a great example. Their Red Ale seems to go beyond the style and create even more character to a great style. With the Racer 5, Hop Rod, Red Rocket, and Black Bear, Bear Republic is one of my favorite breweries."
"22 oz. bottle. An unfiltered, bottle-conditioned, ""bastardized Scottish red ale"" brewed with Hugh Baird, Crystal, and Caravienne malts; Centennial and Cascade hops used for bitterness and aroma. It pours a deep, deep amber/red with low carbonation and a two finger, tan head that leave huge sheets of lace. Smells of tropical hops at first, with Simcoe-esque passionfruit, mango, and grapefruit, along with woody (cedar?), piney, perhaps floral notes and a caramelly, almost smoky malt backing. The taste follows through almost exactly, with smooth carbonation (due to conditioning) on top of a medium body that provides coating, lingering hop oils. Overall a delicious red ale, nicely hopped, with a touch of Scottish malts for ballast."
"Taste is nice with a slight alchohol and light hop bite. Mouthfeel is meaty and the drinkabiliy is high-this is the third Red Ale I have tried over the past three days and it maybe my favorite"
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of deep reddish brown , with a good tan head - nose of spruce , hopps , resin , malt , and citrus  taste of hopps , malts , citrus , dirty , and dirty - body thick , sour and dirty  aftertaste of dirty resin , and spearmint"
"D: This beer is very drinkable. I was ready for another 22oz. but i had only one. Bear Republic calls this a"" Bastardized Scottish Style Red Ale"" if you like Scottish Style or Red Ale and have a open mind you should try this one, Great California Beer."
"drinkability is pretty good. loving the malt in it, but the alcohol comes through fairly strong, especially for 6.8%abv. it's sort of like a slimmed-down old ale. more for the malt-head than the hop-head, and i can appreciate both crowns so it's still very tasty."
"True to its name, this beer has a dark red body and a pillowy white head. Crisp hoppy smell, slightly citric. Caramel malts followed by earthy/piney hops; nicely balanced, but with fuller hop flavors and a dry finish. Medium-bodied, crisp, and very drinkable. Another great beer from Bear Republic."
"This beer claims to be a ""bastardized Scottish style red ale"" with ""aggressive hop character"" and it does not dissappoint. The beer holds a thick head which lasts several minutes after pouring. The smells are slightly sweet with hop covering the aroma. Hops continue upon tasting the beer, stronger than most Scottish ales, but then again aggressive hops were the brewmasters goal. The malts are neither lacking nor overbearing and compliment the overall feel of the beer. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean with only the slightest linger of flavor that makes you crave more. This craving is quenched over and over again but never quite overcome making this a very drinkable brew."
"Good mouthfeel and quite smooth and easy to drink. I like it for an amber but there are other Bear Republic offerings that I prefer."
"Pours a cloudy red/brown, thick off white head, nice lacing, great retention, certainly looks good. Smell is toffee, grains, citrus and floral hops, roast, bit of metallic aroma, Bear Republic signature aroma. Taste is caramelized, earthy, lots of citrus/floral hoppiness, metallic again, bit weak in the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, bit of a gusher. Not bad, I liked their other offerings more, maybe I need to try a fresher bottle."
"Drinkability - This red ale is definitely stands apart from the rest of the red ales I've had. It's very hoppy, but it's really well balanced by the strong malt character. Each flavor seems to have its counterpart elsewhere in the beer, the result being a very drinkable treat."
"22 oz bottle. Poured a nice darkredish brown with very fat and long lasting head. Left beautiful rings of lacing in the glass as it slowly settled. Nice nose of complex malts with subtle hops. Very easy to drink. Great taste with all the malts and hops coming together for a perfectly balanced combination Smooth on the palate with a slighty oily touch, and good to the last drop. A very nice ale. Beer Advocate has this listed as an American Amber/Red Ale. I would classify it as an American Strong Ale, but whatever you choose type it as it is still outstanding."
"D - Alright. No difficulty finishing it. The alcohol, though not boozy and well obfuscated, makes too much of an appearance. It is an enjoyable brew though. Not great with food. A bit strong to session, lacks some of the qualities in mouthfeel and taste that a more sessionable beer would have. I don't think I will have it again. Nothing awful, but nothing great. Looks good though."
"I would definetly buy again, not as strong as their IPAs but for a red its pretty damn good."
"Cheers!"
"Not many reds are this flavorful..get one."
"pretty uninspiring appearance. average. the smell has a wonderful biscuit caramel body to it. the taste lacks the necessary hop character to balance out what seems like a big alcohol presence. i was surprised at the 6.8% abv. it's a great beer to pair with food."
"This is quite a good red ale, probably the best I've had in a while. Most of them come off as being just too sweet and/or too bland in their flavor. This beer surpasses most in its style with a wonderfully hearty and smooth mouthfeel, and an excellent array of flavors. Highly recommended ale here."
"The fore is heavily hopped and that first sip is very creamy. Toasted caramel malt, burnt brown sugar and even a good dose of chocolate follow the hoppy first blast. It has a nice balance of malt to hop and both are very heady. This kind of has a Christmas beer feel to it, though hoppier than most would be. I really like the base malt flavors here. Very nice brew."
"D - A very interesting beer that defies category in most ways. Quite drinkable and at 6.8% ABV it won't kill you after a bomber."
"I don't know, this is a very odd beer. Pours a very dark ruby red color, with no head at all. The smell is an overpowering malty sweetness with a distinct hop aroma that I can't place for the life of me. Taste is just odd, it's not at all displeasing, but this beer is so sweet, so over the top with malt sugars and malt roastiness. The hop bitterness is greatly subdued by the sugary sweetness of the heavey malt - definitely a red ale, no doubts there in the flavor, just BIG. I usually find big red's like this (Saint Rogue, Santa's Private, CascaZilla) to be more approachable and this beer is definitely something that requires thought before drinking a bomber of. I had never tried it before, so I didn't know what to expect and what I got was a big malty red super sweet, slightly bitter red. I'm kind of tempted to suggest that if the bitterness were more pronounced that this beer would be much more balanced and more enjoyable. I mean it's certainly not a bad beer, and if I were to see it on tap somewhere I might grab a pint, but I think this will not grace my fridge again any time soon, I just can't imagine being in the mood for this when I'm at home relaxing."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a slightly bigger than medium body. The beer is very creamy inspite of boiling prickly carbonation. This beer is dam tasty and I wish it came to Cincinnati."
"A mighty fine quaff that lends itself to a great many occasions."
"Mouthfeel was zesty with a medium body. The second pour was smoother. This was an amber ale that I really enjoyed. Generally I don't really appreciate amber ales but I greatly prefer IPAs. This beer seemed to be a combonation of these two styles."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a dark brown color ale with a big dirty brown color head wit good retention. Aroma of big citrusy hops is quite powerful and dominant with some roasted sweet caramel malt also noticeable. Taste is almost entirely dominated by big citrus hops with a good caramel malt backbone. Body is about average and carbonation is slightly above average. If you like big citrus flavour beer from the west coast then this is probably going got be for you."
"This beer is a nice burgundy color with a small head and minimal lacing. There is a smell to this beer that is strongly of peppers. This is also reflected in the taste, although not as strong. The hops are also evident in the taste as this is a fairly bitter beer. The mouthfeel is sorta sharp and this hurts the drinkability just a tad. Overall, a fair beer but not the brewers best."
"Thanks to Enola for sharing the bottle."
"Easily on of my favorites, quite drinkable, and one I will enjoy again and again."
"Red Rocket Ale pours a copper color with a thick white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is hoppy. Taste is very hoppy, with a nice amount of malt to balance it out. One of the more tasty red ales I've had, the alcohol is slightly noticeable, and this beer does pack a punch. The mouthfeel is creamy. Recommended."
"Pours a dark bronze color with thick and creamy tan head that fades into a heavy lace that coats the walls of the glass with a sticky lace as you drink. Nose is apparent as soon as the bottle is opened with aromas of floral hops and citrusy fruit. Taste begins with toasty caramel malts followed by a bit of an earthy charcoal smokiness, however the fruity hops seem to dominate throughout the taste. Not that thats a bad thing, mind you. In fact, even the label proclaims that this beer is a bastardized red ale with an aggressive hop character."
"I could drink this beer all day. It is incredibly tasty and damn smooth. Chalk up another absolute winner for Bear Republic."
"Dthis is great! Not sure Ive had anything like it, but would love it again."
"Slainte!"
"Bear Republic rocks!"
"Great example of the style. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, especially after trying New Belgium's Fat Tire Amber Ale earlier and being severely disappointed with that. Bear Republic has definitely impressed me once again with Red Rocket. Well worth the effort to obtain."
"This is really a spectacular melding of an American Red Ale with a touch of Scotch Ale flavor's. This brew is really complex but goes down pretty smooth as well. Definitely seek this one out."
"Drinkability: Althought the mouthfeel was lacking, I could definately see myself sessioning out this beer at a brewpub."
"I am really impressed by Bear Republic: in a time when so many beer companies are making HUGE beers, they are concentrating on the middle ground and exceeding wildly. The smell is much like rye, with a hint of hops and sweetness. The taste starts out subtle, but as it goes down and as you grow more accustomed to the beer it becomes really complex. Its almost like a good brown in that way, but the sweetness is often apparent for the whole way down. A great beer, as are most of their offerings, and something to be sought out."
"I liked this one a lot. Its easy to drink and there are some neat flavors working together here but not to a point where it become overwhelming."
"Poured a nice darkis amber with a creamy had that had lasted for quite a while. Aroma of fresh hops possibly Cascade are quite strong and pleasant. Moutheel was a little light and watery. Initial flavor is of sweet caramel which yields nicely to vibrant hops. The flavor of the caramel and hops have a startling lasting power in the mouth. Carbonation adds some nice tang to the beer. I think if the mouthfeel was a little better it would easily make my session list. As it stands, it's a good interpretation of the red style."
"D: Very nice offering from BR here -- I prefer it before the hops really kick in, but no doubt a fine beer."
"Full bodied flavorful ale. The beginning is a dry malt. This gives way to a hop bouquet that lasts through the swallow and remains in the aftertaste. Absolutely delicious."
"D: Love these full flavored reds with a huge bitter backbone. What a great example."
"Pouris just a half step away from being black. Instead its amber that is nearly brown. White head is almost more than an inch thick. Nose is piney but little else appears.Taste is very fruity and very citrusy with bitterness taking a backseat. Not the best tasting but still pretty good. Mouth is just better than adequate. This is good but does not push you to buy more. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of Red Ales."
"Drinkability: This was fairly intense and deep for a red ale. I found a bomber enjoyable for a night time tasting, but lost my appetite for more beer once it was done."
"Ambers/reds have always been hit or miss with me. I was hoping this would be a hit, but unfortunately not. For some reason I get a lot of metal flavors with many reds and this one is not immune to this weird effect. It's not too bad but not my favorite. Bear Republic's IPA's are tasty though!"
"D: Pretty special beer - a great example of a strong red ale. It's delicious and enjoyable, nice in the summer. The malty balance makes it creamy yet refreshing; I concur with others who recommend this as an alternative to the more hop-heavy IPA choices."
"Nevertheless, I loved this, and can't wait to grab more whenever I see it."
"Drinkability: The ale's abv and intense hop flavor can do you in over time, but a bomber is doable."
"Overall a very nice beer, I'm glad I tried it. Red ales like this one are nice for when you're looking for a hoppy beer that's a little more balanced than an IPA, which this one certainly is. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Recommended."
"Bronzed red with undulating, meringued ecru head. Several chunks of hops float before settling to the bottom of the glass. Big c-hop aromas cover over a sweetish caramel malt presence. Smells peachy-fruity, like one of their IPAs. Big caramelly malt flavors up front, beefy and sweet (but certainly not cloying) before bitter grapefruit rind hops rush in near the finish, which is all brown sugar and apricots. Medium body and juicy mouthfeel. Damn drinkable red ale, especially for the price. Great choice when one wants a hoppy beer but isn't quite in the mood for an IPA."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Wow... I've never experienced a beer's mouthfeel improve so fast with the sediment addition. This began as a mediocre, deadened texture at the outset, and now it's great. Full, foamy, and very enjoyable. I can't fully endorse sessioning this one... it's quite a handful from start to finish. Glad to have sampled this, it was an adventure."
"D- Fanastic. So much flavor throughout the whole experience. What a treat."
"This beer might be a good session beer. It is not to strong in alcohol, so that wouldnt be a problem. Also, the flavor is quite plesent. This is a good beer, but I think it might be just a little more IPA like than Red Ale. Call it what you will, I will call it good."
"D - Very drinkable. This is an awesome amber ale, very tasty and well balanced, some difference's from most other amber's."
"Dark red in colour with high carbonation. Strong caramel aromas with some minor grapefruit and floral notes. The caramel fades in the flavor, and roasted elements start to dominate. Theres a bit of sourness there too, along with a harsh, spent-hops-like bitterness. Medium bodied. An ok beer, but a real disappointment from a usually excellent brewery."
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep brown with a redish tinge when held to the light. Also has Bear Republics characteristic thick head that lasts for a heck of a long time, leaving tons of lacing. I honestly don't know how this beer could look better. Smell is of citrisy hops and toasted malt grain. Taste is much the same. The hops hit up front but a nice sweetness carries it down well. Finishes bitter again, but not dry. Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is about right and is an easy drinker. Bear Republic continues to impress."
"I think this is available in bottles too. I recommend it, especially as a deck beer for the summer."
"Tastes very much like it smells, like some kind of goddamn preIndustrial attempt towards gaudiness. The rich exhuberance of nature, pale in comparison to the synthetic splendor of our age, but brilliant on an altogether different plane. The hops do you kick you, the malt does not linger like a kiss. Instead, you get a wonderfully balanced dry hop start, floral middle, and caramel finish. All lead to an immensely drinkable, very tasty brew."
"At any rate, here's another great one from Bear Republic."
"Drinkability suffered for me due to the taste issues I had with it, I drank it all but didn't enjoy it as much as I usually do a good beer and it seemed stronger to me than the ABV suggests."
"D- This beer has good complexity with a unique toasted malt flavor that really balances nicely with the green fresh hops. The fizz in the mouthfeel really compliments the hops to give them that extra kick."
"Hops are the main feature in this west coast red, but there is a solid malt foundation as well. A tasty beverage."
"This brew is interesting and unusual. A great change of pace. I would definitely seek it out again. The ABV is concealed beneath the bready grainy flavor."
"Overall a tasty drinkable beer that was very different from anything I have come accross before."
"I had this over lunch at the source in Healdsburg, CA. Dark amber with orange highlights. Creamy off white head with a wonderful waterfall effect. Aroma of dark toffee and dates. Just a touch of grapefruit rind. The taste has caramel up front followed quickly by a light bitterness. Just a bit of blackberry. Rich creamy mouth feel, very drinkable. I never thought I would write creamy in a description of a beer with this amount of hops. Great on cask."
"This is the biggest red I've ever had...very close to a rich IPA...I love it and can drink these all night."
"A rich hearty and very complex ale."
"From a 22 oz bomber, this poured a deep reddish brown with an inch head that subsided into 1/4 inch that remained all the way down leaving solid lacing all the way. Aroma - hop citrus, with roasted malt. Taste - yikes!-diacetyl right off that almost put me off the beer immediately, but I stayed with it to the end, and found a decent roasted malt without acridness from over-roasting, and noticed some citrus-(hops), before, but mostly after. Medium mouthfeel with a little too much carbonation. Drinkability- the diacetyl ruined this for me."
"Fairly full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation gives this a velvety mouthfeel with a warming of alcohol as it goes down. It's wonderfully easy to drink because of the awesome taste, but one must be careful as it does pack some punch. I highly recommend this one...Cheers !"
"Red Rocket pours a deep, dark crimson, almost brown in it's depths. A big ole pillow of whipped, creamy head caps it off. It's hopped like an IPA, full of piney, citrus infused bitterness. But there's a whole lot of caramel malt sweetness down in there to provide some backbone and mellow things out nicely. Never shows it's almost 7 percent abv. Drinkable to a fault, this one never loses it's charm. Pizza, Chinese, Mexican. There's not much this brew doesn't pair up with."
"Another slam dunk from Bear Republic. God how I wish I could get them in Florida."
"A medium-full bodied brew, that is nice drinking....thanks Wally Paulnuts."
"Last swigs: Qualifies as a MUST TRY! How surprised was I when I noticed that I never reviewed this? I've had a few bottles in my day, knew I really dug it and never reviewed it."
"22 ounce bottle. Red Rocket Ale pours out a reddish brown color with a huge head that refuses to die. Big aroma with butterscotch, toasted malt, and spuce hops. The flavor starts off malty with a burnt caramel sweetness. But just when you start to think this is some sort of malty beer, the hops come in. The huge hop flavor isn't overly bitter, but it is very flavorful. Some citrus, but mainly piney flavors from the hops. The mouthfeel is full for the style. Pretty good drinkability. This is a delicious West Coast style hoppy red ale."
"From the bottle, in a hotel in new york city, from notes. Dark red amber with a nice frothy head of off-white. Aromas of piney resiny hops and fruit punch like juicy malts. Taste is a nice blend of the two, hoppy enough to kick your ass but malty enough to call an amber. Balanced as all get out with no hint of abv and a super refreshing mouthfeel. Not a show stopper for BR's line but damn if this isn't one great thirst quenching, refreshing, pizza companion beer. Another great beer."
"Very dark amber/brown color. Hold it up to the light and it glows red and has high clarity. The creamy head is almost two fingers thick with nice retention and fine lacing. Smell is lightly bready with strong hops. Taste starts out brightly hoppy, quite a mouthfull. The hops dominate the subtle malt flavors of caramel and bread. Quite bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is great, good carbonation, medium thickness, lightly creamy as it coats well. Alcohol does not dominate and is at a good level. Drinkability is good but a higher balance of flavors would make it even more enjoyable..."
"Overall a solid and quality beer, but not a beer that I would write home about."
"This beer was one of the best smelling things ever. With my new nose, I quit smoking for good, this has a great hop presence. I am betting lots of cenntenial. After the smell the taste is kind of disappointing. It has a thinner body than I wanted and that cuts into the enjoyment of the malt and blands out some of the hop flavor. A good drinker, I will have some more."
"R.R.A. pours with a majestically massive whipped-chunky mocha colored head with extraordinary retention. Nose of hops and spruce combined with elements of clover honey make for superb aromatics. Color is a beautiful deep rusty red with light active carbonation lazily rising from the bottom center of the glass. The taste is well malted and well hopped; the balance of both are properly combined to elicit a moderately full bodied mouthfeel; a tad sticky and well rounded. The flavors last several minutes in the mouth. The alcohol is well disguised beneath the generous weight and flavors of this fine brew, which remind me of a ""mini"" Alpha King, with both beers having similar flavors and characteristics. This is my 1st Bear Republic product ever ingested, and unquestionably not my last! Highly recommended!!"
"Smooth and rich mouthfeel, a very quaffable beverage."
"Another great beer from bear republic. I've never been too big a fan of red ales but this is a very tastey beer."
"yes sir, I like it. I will definitely be picking this up again... funny, I look back at my ratings and can't believe it scored that high for me.. but it is just solid in all categories.. not outrageous in any of them, but totally soild (shrugs shoulders and continues with beer)"
"more hops in the taste. not overpowering, but piney and bitter enough to dominate the touch of malt. prickly carbonation in the mouthfeel. dangerously drinkable; smooth, balanced, delicious. not as good as their IPA, but another solid beer from a great brewer."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and rich for texture. A smooth drink that hinds the ABV. Very easy to drink and enjoyable. I would have like to see more balance with the hops and a bit more flavor malt but still a excellent beer."
"I continue to be very impressed by Bear Republic. Every single one of their beers that I've tried stuns me with its presentation, flavor, and drinkability. Love 'em to death."
"Damn woman, this is tasty. Pours an amber color with a nice fluffy head. Smells of a perfectly blended mixture of malts and hops. I want to drink this beer upon the first sniff. As for how it tastes, well, it's one damn good brew. Smooth as all hell, the balance in this boy is as good as I've ever tasted. Each sip is dominated equally by the sweet, deep malt presence and backed up perfectly by the fruity hoppiness that balances. So smooth, very drinkable, and really, what more could you want?"
"Cheers!"
"Rich ruby-copper colour, quite clear, with a fluffy cream-coloured head. Lots of clumpy lace and great retention. Citrusy and leafy hop aroma balanced by significant malt that's just short of caramel in character. Caramel malt sweetness hits the palate first and carries through to the end. This is followed closely by citrus and a hint of pine that's strongest at the mid-point. Toffee kicks in at the end. The hop bitterness comes forward in the finish, which is balanced very nicely. Creamy texture aided by superb carbonation, this is a silky smooth beer with a dry finish. There's also just a bit of alcohol warmth that creeps in after a while, but it's very subdued. Overall, very enjoyable and easy to drink. Lots of flavour and great balance. I'd definitely seek this gem out again."
"Way to go! I love big hops, even more so when the malts are there to back it up."
"I have always loved this beer and others by Bear Republic, I consider them one of the best micro breweries in California. I jumped at the chance to have this baby cask conditioned. The deep amber body was topped by a thick tan head that just coated the glass with lace. Aroma was strong of hops. Slightly smoother than the draft or bottled version, but then that's the signature of real cask ale. Full bodied yet totally drinkable, perfect for the rainy day I had it on. I just knew the cask version of this outstanding ""bastardized Scottish ale"" would be even better than bottled or draft. If you are ever at their pub and this is on cask, get it."
"As I said, not bad, but nothing I would rush to buy again."
"This is a damn fine beer - probably the best American red that I've had. Pours a deep mahagony with a touch of garnet that's gone through the tumbler a few times. Smell of raw citrus and hops. The two smells blend together nicely - much better than many IPA's I've had recently. The taste mirrors - smooth hops intertwined with a subtle citrus. Coriander, caramel, and roasted barley are the finish. An amazingly drinkable brew. I think the alcohol was the perfect level. Too much more would have been overbearing. A great brew that I would like to drink again and again."
"This is another top notch brew from Bear Republic. They really do know their stuff!"
"This is a very deep, rich amber beer. It pours a dark red/amber to brownish color with ruby highlights when held up to the light. Thick frothy white to off-white head. Sweet malty and piney hop aromatics. Great bitter/sweet balance leaning a little more towards the piney hop taste. Sharp hoppy bite, hoppy, piney aftertaste. A complex red ale. Quite drinkable."
"This is a great brew. I have been astounded by the consistent quality from Bear Republic. This is probably the closest thing to Red's Rye that I've had, which is a huge complement. Highly recommended!"
"An amber colored beer with an off-white colored head that remains thick for several minutes. The viscosity of the beer seems slightly higher than is typical for this style, making it engaging. Aromas of hard candy and grass dominate. There are other scents, but they are difficult to place. The combination of aromas is not very appealing, hence the lower score. The taste is as would be expected for this style; a well balanced hop profile with a malt backbone that seems to linger. The alcohol is well masked and does not hinder the texture or the blending of flavors in this beer. The aftertaste is that of sweet dates, but over time it transforms into a more bitter & crisp flavor. An enjoyable brew that can be had a number of times."
"Drinkability: This beer is great fun to drink. Bold and flavorful, but goes down smooth."
"awesome beer, please try this if you have the chance."
"I was very impressed by this one. I wanted to brew something similar to this when a friend pointed this one out. I must say even though I knew it was going to be hoppy, the hop scent still blew me away after the deep red pour. It is a very deep amber-orange unless held against direct yellow light where it turns a marvolous red. It had a thick tan head which complemented the carbonation bubbles slowly running up the side. The red color is enduced by a vienne malt. It produces a pleasurable but fleeting sweet as the hops are the primary flavor in this brew. Heavily hopped. I could taste the typical cascades of the west coast, however I wasn't expecting the heavy kick it gave. It was a welcome suprise given that I am a huge hop fan. I did not sense any sour notes on the side of the tongue which is a huge plus. The bitterness tones out the sweetness a little too much. I normally would like that, but it is a kick in the face seeing that the color is more reminiscent of an irish red with little hop character. I found the mouthfeel very pleasant and give it a thumbs up because it does work the majority of the tongue, except the sour outside of course. This beer is a true joy for hop-lovers. If you are expecting a Scotch Ale (as they were originally aiming for- but then made it a hybrid later) steer clear, this one has way too much hops to even be associated with that style. A true joy for hops lovers."
"What an enjoyable beer. A very good craft brewed red ale. This could be a dangerous session brew at 6.8% ABV, but may be worth it. Nice drinkability level. Another Bear Republic offering that impresses me."
"I found this one of the more pleasing Red's: doesn't take your tastebuds off and doesn't give you diabetes. A great offering from Bear Republic if you ask me."
"Wowww what a smell. This almost smells liek a brown ale. Insanely malty/alcoholy. This poured a really nice red brown color with a good amount of carbonation and other little crap floating around. Good bubbly tan head with sticky lace. Wow this is smooooth. I have not tasted anything like this before. Little tea flavor in there. this tastes hoppier than it smells. Some toasted flavors in there. The mouthfeel is creamy. I might need to have this again before i say anything intelligent but this is special."
"This is a nice rich amber. I had no problems drinking the bomber in one sitting. Enjoyable."
"Nice amber color. Sturdy off-white head. The smell is pretty rich, some malts and decent hop or two. The taste is pretty similar, with a reasonable bitter hop and some brown sugar flavors. Mouthfeel was a bit harsh; it was slightly over carbonated and had some un-necessary alcohol tones. I think this lowered drinkability, but overall the flavors were solid."
"The taste was somewhat interesting, but after the weak presentation and sub-par mouthfeel I was just disappointed overall at this point. Again this bottle may have been sitting around awhile and be a bad example of this beer, so I hope another try will vindicate Red Rocket in the future. However, first impressions are lasting ones, and I was taken back by the beer I poured into my glass."
"Wasn't sure what to expect when the label said it was a ""bastardized Scottish style red ale"". Poured a clear dark amber with a thick creamy head that lasted for quite a while. Lots of nice lacing in the glass. Aroma is a little fruity with the higher alcohol slightly detectable. Taste is creamy with some sweet caramel flavours and a bit a warming after-affect. A really good beer with a unique flavour. Would love to have more of this."
"Slàinte!"
"Overall, I'd say this is a milder Arrogant Bastard- which I like better- but this is certainly a tasty brew. It's good bang for your buck."
"Overall: Another winner from BR, and a great value at around $3.50 a bomber. One that I'll definitely start keeping around."
"poured a deep red- brown color with tannish head that started off chunky but fell to a light coating on top of beer and on sides of glass. Smell is mainly of hops with some toasted malt present. Taste is extremely smooth with initial sweet maltiness giving way to a great hop bitterness. Finishes with nice hop dryness and bitterness. A superb brew."
"Drinkability: made for a nice pint, but it's not as exciting as the name would lead you to believe"
"Drinkability is nice big and malty but also loads of hops. Like a amber ale on steriods. Definitely on the short list of great amber ales."
"Edit: Okay, I just poured the last of it into my glass and that cascading is really cool. HTF they did it, I would really like to know. Perhaps it has something to do with multi-branched sugars in the thick liquid. Appearance changed from 4.5 to 5.0"
"Color is dark Brown/Red. Frothy tan Head that coats the glass nicely. The taste was malty up front and hoppy at the end a gloriously crafted red beer that is so frickin smooth that the drinkability is mind boggling for a strong beer. Could hardly taste the alcohol but just enough to warm it up a bit. I'm really starting to see what a fine brewery Bear Republic is."
"Deserving of its high rating. Pours a very, very dark amber, with hints of ""red"" only visible upon holding it up to a light. Head is about a third of an inch thick, somewhat lacey and indicative of its style. Aroma is tremendous - very hoppy, some citrusy notes as well. Taste is slightly less appealing than the aroma, but that's not saying anything tremendously deprecating because the aroma was, as I said, tremendous. Toasted malts hit you first, lasting about halfway through its absorption on the tongue until the hoppiness shines through and kicks the tastebuds lightly but firmly as swallowed. Mouthfeel struck me as almost oily, but pleasant. Overall a very good beer."
"Deep chestnut, amber body poured out of a 22oz bomber. A rocky, mammoth beige head topped off this brew with serious vengance. The aroma is just like sticking your head into a sack of freshly dried whole leaf hops. A piney kick in the hops (maybe Simcoe dry-hopping?). This will be a welcome to any hop head. The taste is nicely hopped right at the start and the carmel malt shows midway through. The bittering hops slap you in the face after the sweetness resides. I love a hop bite, but this may have been a little too much for this beer. It seems a bit unbalanced. Those who fear hops and love typical ambers will be easily turned away from this one. Bear Republic has never been afraid of hops (god bless them!), but this may be a bit harsh for some. Overall, nice brew, but again the intense bite seems a bit out of place."
"Medium to heavier bodied with a comfortable amount of carbonation. I enjoyed this one thoroughly."
"Very dark maroon color, way darker than almost every red I've encountered (this is almost as dark as some ""porters""), Head isn't huge, but does have nice lacing. Tons of juicy hops aroma in the nose, just ridiculous. Also slightly caramel sweetness. Taste is as solid as you can get. Huge hops flavor and bitterness. Taste is also balanced, malt-wise, just excellent drinking. Creamy mouthfeel, great. My first bear republic, and definitely not the last. My second favorite Red Ale ever (Sanata's Private Reserve)."
"Wow, I've blown off this beer for years because it's ""just another amber ale."" Trust me, this is NOT just another amber ale -- this is THE amber ale. Superb."
"Very nice red ale here. Pours a deep mahogany with lasting head. Smell is of cloves and alcohol. Very smooth-tasting brew, but a bit of a bitter aftertaste that struck me. Nice, low carbonation, making this a very drinkable beer. Another winner from Bear Republic. Recommended..."
"Ballsy stuff. Go try it."
"Poured out a deep ruby color with a nice white head which left some lacing afterwards. Smell consisted of hops, some citrus aromas, but also some toasted malts showed up and at some point took over the hop aroma. Taste was quite good. Hops along with a citrus and piney undertones start out and gives away to a solid malt base. The citrus flavors hang around in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium with lively carbonation. One of the better amber red's out there. This reminded me a little of Newport Storm's Maelstorm IPA. Hoppy but a big malt backbone. Good stuff."
"A very dark red ale, borderline brown. Smell had a stronger malt aspect that hid a potent hop flavor that this red ale is full of. A definitive Pacific Northwest taste. A very tasty ale with a citrus hop emphasis but it hits hard with 6.8% ABV. A great beer, even better fresh out of a keg."
"Finger licking good!"
"Pours a deep brownish red with a thick foamy beige head. Nose reminds me of a forest--smelling both of pine and nuts, with a hops scent dominating everything. Taste on this is supremely balanced, with a huge hops presence for a red ale which is perfectly balanced by a rich malty taste. Mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice level of carbonation and a lingering hops bitterness. This is an all around great beer---like an IPA with a stronger malt presense and better balance."
"The appearance is a murky golden brown with a nice, and suprisingly lasting, head. The smell was mostly of the citrus/floral hop aroma. Well balanced flavor of floral and spicy hops with a woody/bready malt character. This is a full bodied beer with medium carbonation that coats your mouth. Just a little too much lingering bitternes in the aftertaste. This is a wonderful beer that would pair perfectly with a good meal, but has a balanced complexity to enjoy on its own."
"I thought this beer was well balanced and very drinkable. I think the aging mellowed out the hop flavor a bit."
"Wow this is one hoppy red ale. Pours an dark amber brown color with decent head and good lace along the glass. Smell is of roasted nuts and citrusy pacific NW hops. Taste is smack in your face full of bittering hops with a strong lingering aftertaste. Has more of a malty backbone than the hop rod rye but very similar hop characteristics. A nice beer for hop-heads but lacks the purported malty presence and could benefit from being a bit more 'balanced'."
"Supercharged Amber with more hops and more everything. Red brown colour with a very nice malty nose this beer is a very cutting edge take on the style. Like Hop Rod Rye this is a deep beer with many levels and great drinkability. A sipper in a style that is usually a session beer. I need to get my hands on more of these fellows for further tasting."
"Drinkability- Either way, this is a pretty good brew that I will be sure to pick up sometime again in the future. Very tasty."
"This disturbingly named beer is still quite good regardless! Pours a brownish-red color, smells hoppy. Head is light, but surprisingly persistent. Taste is quite good, earthen-like flavors initially, but almost as hoppy as an IPA. Somewhat sweet with a spicy finish. Very drinkable, I could drink this one all day. A good starter beer for beer newbies, perhaps? A good show."
"Film of foam subsides almost immediately to a cat-n-nine tail painting. Crystal clear, ruby red hue and awfully quiet. Boisterous hop on nose with some orange peel, peppermint, and an almost barleywine sweetness. Grog of hop juice, a slight ethereal smokiness, and a sponge of earthy peat on the mouth all add up to build a nice complexity to this. Solid, solid offering."
"After one, I was ready for something a bit lighter on the palette. But it is one of my favorites. Much like scotch, one is very satisfying for me."
"I continue to be impressed by Bear Republic. Hadn't had this one yet, but the Hop Rod Rye is one of my all time fav's and I remember liking thier stout too, but I was a little drunk at the time and didn't review it. But this is another exceptional beer. Pours a very rusty brownish red color with a nice foamy head that lasts all the way down to the bottom of my pint glass. Smell and taste are full of flavor and character. Nice piney hops up front but with a really strong backing of nutty malts. Sometimes I think these amber/red ales really are the epitomy of a well balanced beer. Has that Bear Republic signature hoppy kick but it's a little more mellow and subdued than say an IPA. Nice buttery tones to this beer as well. Great smooth mouthfeel and as far as drinkability I'd have this beer breakfast lunch and dinner if it was socially acceptable. Hee hee. Happy beering, folks."
"Mouthfeel is crisp at the start and finishes smoother. Bitterness and caramel last long on the tongue after swallowing. Superb drinkability. This is a great brew."
"Not a beer I will be buying again."
"Tap@Bear republic brewpub. Pretty intense, heavily hopped. Pine, grapey, grapefruity, and quite bitter in the finish, pretty tasty stuff. Nice stuff and good to have it fresh at the brewpub. Beautiful fresh, fragarnt hops in aroma and flavour, extremely drinkable. Tasty stuff."
"This is an amazing beer."
"I take a sip...oh it is as if the forest itself has unleashed its fury upon my tongue, and yet it does not scorch my taste buds. It did not burn. The hoppy pine rests evenly on a base of sweet malt and what's that...raisins? It disappears down the gullet, leaving a mildly sweet and clean aftertaste. It coats exceptionally well, forcing me with a whip and a chain to take another gulp. Damn...this is the most sadistic animal I've ever tasted, but it somehow forces me to take more. Does this mean I'm a weirdo?"
"This excellent red ale lives in the upper reaches of the style with regard to flavor, bitterness and ABV. All good things for those of us who love hops and who love big beer. Once you pop the cap, Red Rocket is on its way to the stratosphere. See if you can hang on for one whiz-bang of a ride."
"The drinkability is remarkable for 6.8 abv and is a session beer, look out."
"22oz bottle. Pours a brown/red color with a small head that stays around and leaves lots of lacing on the glass. The aroma is nice and malty and sweet. Hops are apparent to even things out. The flavor is malty sweet and slightly fruity. Very smooth to drink. Mouthfeel is moderate."
"This is interesting. Orangy with black highlights, a yellow-grayish head that is amazingly sticky and creamy. Smells like caramel syrup drizzled over a citrusy fruit salad. Biscuity caramel with roasted notes taste like a mutant candy with a bitter backbone made of pine resin and orange rind. Flavor lingers with the sweetness balancing out after a few seconds. Expecting a sizzly aggressive feel, how pleased I was to fing that this beer is smooth as silk. Ends with enough bitterness to require another sip."
"Frankly, I've deducted points for what I'd consider a mis-classification of this style. On its own it's a pleasant beer but an amber ale it certainly isn't. Way too much alcohol and hopping to be an amber, even one from the North Country. If this was classified a 'strong ale"" and placed against Stone's Bastard, I'd have given the taste a higher rating. It's a reasonably drinkable brew with pleasant characteristics but I can think of many other amber ales that I'd rather have."
"Notes: While the taste is dry and nutty, the nose is fruity. this juxteposition makes for an interesting beer, but not one which I could drink two of. Oh yes, retention and lacing were both excellent."
"I really loved this offering from Bear Republic. I enjoyed lightly exhaling through my nose with my mouth open which seemed to bring out the peaty, smokey aspect of this brew. It's a true one-off blend of an IPA, a red, and a Scotch ale. I can't believe I hadn't tried Red Rocket before. I certainly will be picking more of it up again. Good stuff!!"
"Fairly dark red in hue, if not brown in spots, around the edges there are some ruby highlights (no lit backdrop is needed). The head was beige in color; at the maximum it reached about one finger in height. Then I quickly faded to a chucky, soapy cap, lacing was spotty and unorganized. The nose is powerfully hoppy, very assertive. There is a great jolt of pine and citrus (grapefruit flesh and rinds). Even though the malt doesnt really penetrate the hops I get the vibe there will be a good malt backbone. Maybe the color is playing tricks on me. There are obvious ripe fruity aromas. This adds some needed depth. Im very intrigued by the smells, thus it is inviting. Excellent potency. The palate is very charming. The malt isnt quite as big as I was expecting but it does play a very important role and it does it well. The label says Scottish Red, I can see that in the malt as it shows flashes of depth, rich and sweet with a bit of toasty caramel. Dont get me wrong the malt isnt very aggressive but it does provide support. The hops are the go-getters and this is why the label states Bastardized before it says Scottish Red. On the palate the hops are aggressive, the bitterness is solid but not devastating. They start off piney and remain so for a long while and then briefly they turn citrusy. There seems to be a disconnect between the malt and hops. They dont fit each other nor do they work in harmony (there is no conflict either). If they did this would be a great beer. As is, it is tasty and very good. The aftertaste is candied malt and piney hops. Nice. Medium in body, too thin for this beer, it is a little watery but not flawed. It is plenty drinkable and just as likeable. This is another dandy from Bear Republic, to bad the only place I see them is in Wisconsin. I bought this bomber in Milwaukee. Worth a try."
"22 oz. bomber. Pours a clear, reddish chestnut color with a nice light beige head leaving good lacing. Peaty, earthy, toasty and butterscotchy malt aromas and Cascade-like in its grassy hop profile. Very complex in its five types of malt, some hop bitterness does come through, but the malt is the meal ticket in this brew; nice and biscuity. Pass the gravy, please. A wonderfully drinkable and balanced red ale. Troegs Hopback doesn't even come close to its complexity."
"I think I may need to try this on tap, fresh, to see more of what this beer should be like. Based on style, this has a lot of malt, bold bitterness, which are good, but it didn't really come together for me, and was quite unimpressive."
"pours an awesome dark amber/ruby colour with a chunky but fluffy off white head that is nice and sticky. as for the smell, malt and hop are nicely balanced with some sweetness and licorice. the flavour also brings a nice hop/malt balance combined with some earth and a touch of spice moreso than the sweetness detected in the smell. this one actually starts nice and malty and gradually mixes in the hop flavouring which is at its peak at the finish, where it combines nicely with a moreso roasted malt/burnt wood flavouring. this is a big red/amber ale. it, along with troegs hopback, rogue american amber, and maybe mcneill's firehouse, (though i haven't had it in quite some time) stand out the most within the style for me, though i still prefer the hopback overall, even though this one is easily more complex and daring. definitely give it a try."
"Had on tap at Redbones, and liked this one. Irish Setter Red in color, I got a clean aroma off of this. I found the taste to be malty and sweet, the mouthefeel to be medium+. More Malty than I anticipated, but then I was impressed that the finish was a bit tannic, and made my mouthwater. Would get again, but then this is a brewery that you do get again, anytime you can."
"Pours a murky reddish-brown color with one finger of head. There is some lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet with caramel malt. Some hoppiness there as well. The taste is a great blend of caramel malt and hops. Very well balanced. A nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is nice and strong. The drinkability is good too, you'd never know it was 6.8%. Another nice one from Bear Republic!"
"Wyll-"
"ng"
"Clear copper in color with a hefty and long-lasting off-white head. Aromas a mix of caramel-toffee sweetness mixed with a leafy hop spicy zest, albeit a bit subdued. Flavor is up-front bitterness that is shortly overtaken by a caramel sweetness that is then trampled by an aftertaste of chewy pine cones. At 6.8%, you wouldn't know it, as the ABV is shrouded in flavor. Medium bodied and extremely drinkable. A top-notch beer that will find its way into my fridge."
"One of the best red ale's I've tried...it has some hints of smoky scotch ale character but really it seems more of a true red ale to me than a combo IPA-Scotch ale as billed.."
"Light carbonation and a medium mouthfeel make for a smooth drink. The flavor is gentle but tasty making for an extremely drinkable brew. I like it alot."
"Beautiful Amber Brown, with much sediment floating about. Big chunks. Unappealing, but probably my fault on pouring. Nice finger of head. Very tan and tight knit. Very candy-like nose. Northwestern hops with concentrated maltyness. Taste is similar to smell. rich caramel. dry in finish with a bitterness that begs for another sweet pull. Nice rich mouth-feel, full body and drinkability that is quite nice."
"Drinkability: While the name may have you thinking red, this beer is aggressive scottish type style, which truly goes down quite nice. At first the flavors in my mouth were a bit much, but they definetly simmered down. Overall another solid beer by Bear Republic, but i'd try their other offerings first."
"Poured in a straight-side pint glass. Dark ruby appearance with a thick white head of foam that falls leaving sticky white lacework. Leafy fresh, citrusy hops in the aroma. A thick and full-bodied beer with super smooth mouthfeel that drinks like an ESB on steroids. Lots of Juicy, fruity and sugary malt flavors meld with tons of hops. A sticky, sugary finish is laced with even more spicy hops. The characteristics of the malt character are diverse. Despite tons of hops, I can detect beefy malt flavors of caramel and roasted malts with hints of chocolate. Not a light beer by any strech of imagination and needs to be handled with some respect. My wife commented that it tasted almost like a light version of Three Floyds Dreadnaught. I thought it reminded me of Panama Red Ale from the Flossmoor Station brewpub south suburbs of Chicago. Either way, it's an excellent brew, at an excellent value of $3.99 for 22-ounce bottle at Binny's Beverage Depot in Glen Ellyn, Ill."
"Very tasty and, in fact, I really like this. The stout like chocolate and nutty character has thrown me for a loop here. This is a very strange brew, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up another bottle."
"22 oz bomber. Pours red and clear with a tan head. Piney hop aroma. Chinook? Flavor has a big carmel malt component and a big aggressive hop in the background that lingers. Now, this is not over hopped and the malt shines through, so I am suspecting Chinook again. Rather smooth palate and nicely drinkable, almost reminds me of Arrogant Bastard."
"Drinkability is very good. Kind of hybrid cross betwen styles always make for interesting beers in my opinion."
"Deep reddish-brown in color with a nice, thick creamy beige head that leaves sticky sheets of lace in my glass. Strong hoppy aromas of grapefruit and pine, citrus, bready and fruity flavors kind of like pineapple cake. Full bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel, another good one from this brewery."
"The bartended poured me the first pint of a fresh keg. It was a funndy muddy in color. A very deep red. The beer also had a weak head. The taste was bitter, almost sour. It was similar to unripe citrus fruits. The malt was pretty mild and the hops in this beer standout. I had a second pint thinking that my opinion may improve if it was not the first pour off the keg. It tasted the same."
"My first beer from Bear Republic. A solid amber ale, with a strong hop backing and decent maltiness, and one I'd be glad to find again."
"Unusual and required drinking!"
"that kick, i am assuming, is the infulence from the scottish ale. deffinitely an interesting mix."
"A drinkable brew despite its strong flavor tastes much like a Scottish ale."
"Pours a deep deep ruby with a fantastic sticky slightly off white head,really pick up the zest hops there with an underlying caramel malt, very piney and cedary.A big tasting beer nicely balanced with a huge amount of hops for the style but a nice nutty biscuity malt backbone to hold up to the dry,zesty hop.A true west coast ale big and bold tasting and full of hops,a very very nice brew."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid pale and crystal malt scent with an intense citrous hop aroma. The taste is great as well. It has a malty core with a wonderful bitter hop flavor. It goes down easy and finishes bitter and dry. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is one of the best red ales I've ever had. It has great flavor and aroma; a real good drinker."
"22 ounce bottle. (I think I have had this one quite awhile and it has stood the test of time with flying colors.)"
"Overall: Again, I love this brewery's use of hops in their beers. Their beers are not available yet in Pennsylvania but I will go to New York to make sure at least a couple of their offerings are always in my fridge."
"The only modest disharmony in the brew is a slight excess of bitterness in the finish that some Bear Republic loyalists may appreciate more than myself."
"Drinkability: A pleasant beer which surprised me. I confess that when I hear ""Red Ale," I think of Killian's Irish Red and I'm kinda turned off. But a friend had one of these and we tried it and were both very impressed. If it were just a tad less hoppy, it would be a perfect gateway beer. As it is, it's still a good brew."
"Great beer."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I loved this red, I could have this everyday, and twice on Sunday!"
"Pours red. Crazy. I mean, red red. I make red ales and mine are brown. These are nice and red and clear. Small, dense cream-colored head that stuck around a bit, but not too long. I was a little thrown off, yet again, by the smell of it. I mean, it was light and a bit fruity - maybe citrusy. Where're the earthy, malty tones? But, what the heck, let's taste it... Ah! Nice! Yes! THIS is a red ale! Tons o' malt, nice and bitter clean through, very even, bitter aftertaste that just gently fades out... Wow! If I could only have one beer this, hmm. Well, yeah, it would be one of my choices :)"
"Bear Republic hasn't let me down yet."
"Beef Notes: Maybe I'll do some research to find out what kind of hops are used in this one. That way I can be careful of other beer using the same kind. A good beer, though, that made a good turnaround, but I don't think I'll be coming back for a while."
"A great beer to just relax with."
"Pours a dark amber with a dense light khaki head. Good lacing. Smells of sharp, cutting pine/spruce hops with a citrusy edge. Light notes of caramelized malt and slight sweetness. Taste starts off with light roasty-sweet, caramel maltiness, but is soon cut down by big piney, bitter, medicinal hops. Finish is bitter, with some warming and lingering maltiness. Mouthfeel is surprisingly big and the balance is great. A great tasting amber ale, and up until now, the best I've had. I can't wait to try the racer 5 and the big bear black I have in the cellar."
"I'll definitely have to try some more red ales for comparison, but this is quite a tasty treat."
"I really like the products from this brewery."
"Overall this one gets a thumbs up."
"This 22 oz bomber poured a mahogony colored brew that formed a nice lasting head. A cirtrusy hopped aroma is intertwined nicely with a hint of smokiness. The diverseness of this beer's taste is interesting. The hop IBU has to be fairly high as it hit my palate pretty hard. What makes this beer unique is the caramel malts amongst the big hop factor that leads to an interesting smoked finish. A very good beer that a hop head would enjoy!"
"OK, this stuff is unusual, but really good. It pours a deep reddish ebony topped off by a fine hard-working frothy head. The first thing I noticed in the aroma was a sweet smokiness, almost like the peaty smell in a scotch ale (I was later informed that that is deliberate). There was also a touch of citrus, as if the hops were hiding under that smouldering residue, and then all these competing interests came together in the taste, which was remarkably well-balanced. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy, and the aftertaste just a touch bitter. A very interesting brew. I'm not sure I can put my finger on it."
"What a great brew! It poured a magnificant dark mahogany color with a great frothy head that left tons of lace down the glass. The smell was very good with a nice malt scent mixed with a light citrus. The taste was just awesome and unlike any amber/red that I have ever had before. It started out with a touch of malt sweetness, then once it opened up it had a great smokey flavor to it followed up by a great finishing hop bitterness! Very complex flavor and as it warmed it tasted even better. A new favorite of mine for sure."
"Taste: Initial lager-like flavors. Very crisp and refreshing, with biting green hops and a semi-dry finish. Overall, a generously hopped west coast delight."
"Overall a fantastic beer. I didnt even realize it was a hybrid red/scotch/IPA type ale until a few sips in when I read the bottle. Really an outstanding mix of styles. Perfect for a hophead looking for something with a little bit more malty depth"
"Slight tan head resulted from a slow gentle pour. It rested on top of a crystal clear red body and left plenty of lace clinging to the side of the glass. Smell was of pungent hops, sliding into a peaty smokiness and a slight bready note, probably from bottle conditioning. Taste was a whole lot of grapefruit hops delicately balanced with a slight, sticky sweetness and caramel, which comprised the strong malty backbone. There was more of the smokey flavor that rounded the taste out nicely. Mouthfeel was crisp and full of hops yet generally smooth and easy drinking. It is always nice to find red ales that have a little bit of oomph and a unique flavor."
"on tap at the blind tiger: evil looking reddish-brown, capped by a quater inch foamy white head. detected a caramel malt foundation supporting a boatload of hops, of the earthy and pine-sap variety. medium level of carbonation lends a full bodied, creamy smooth mouthfeel. slightly fruity with a crisp snap of aggressive piney hoppiness. some citrus notes in there as well. slightly warming as i got to the bottom of the glass. a well-built ballsy american red ale that i wish was available where i live. good stuff."
"Drinkability: Hop-heads: there's a red ale for you. Bomber bottle is a nice size, found myself wanting more than a pint."
"Dark russet color with a majorly thick finger high head of tight cream colored froth that installs itself on top; slowly puffed away form the center outwards where a thin skim and fairly thick collar stay present the whole glass through and lacing in webby sheets that sticks well at first but then disintegrate more as it goes. Aroma is pleasant of a nice leafy hop bringing a smooth woody earthy dryness over the top of some dulled fruityness and toasted, nearly burnt malts. Taste has a very nice balance of toasted malts and grassy/woody dry hops, starts smooth and lightly sweet of malts as it turns toasted with a substantial building over the palate of the toastyness with the wood dryness sneaking in just past midway and making a home through to the finish where it mixes nicely with notes of dulled dried fruit of apricot, peach, and raisin, and finishes with an overall super nice earthy dryness and texture. Feel detains a smoother start then raises to a thick fullness from there and follows into the drying finish, a slim toastyness lingers. This is a very good amber, one of the better ones I've had with a nice dry hop profile that was hardly bitter in any form, just some tiny glimmers of bite that made this very nice with a certain complexity that was favorable to my palate. Good stuff - thanks goes to Drewbage1847 for the bomber."
"Pours a beautiful deep ruby red, with a mostly lasting creamy tan head that laces lightly. Aroma is toasted malts, caramel and a slew of piney hops. Flavor mostly toasted malts, with a hint of sweet caramel, the middle and end brings in an onslaight of pine & citrus from the hops. Big, full body, goes down easy, flavors linger nicely on the tongue."
"Man this beer is something. If you are not a lover of big hoppy beers it's not for you. Hop heads get this one. For a red amber ale this one rewrites the rules on hops."
" After being misled to believe that this was a toned down beer, I am glad that I sampled this one. It is a real nice brew with a hoppy punch that will wake you up at night."
"Update  I rated this beer so high back in November 2003 when I snagged a bottle in California I thought Id re-review a 2004 vintage now that they sell it here in Seattle at Bottleworks. This thing is by far the tastiest and biggest Red/Amber Ale that Ive ever had, and the mouthfeel is just incredible (better than the 5.0 that I scored it). After 1,200+ reviews it is still my favor Red Ale to date."
"Drinkability: Tastes hoppier than a smoked porter, and milder than a true smoked beer. Not a fan of the smokiness in this one. My least favorite offering from this brewery."
"Very drikable. Hook up the Red Rocket IV and let the fun begin. This one is along the lines of Speakeasy Prohibition Ale with a more roasted flavour."
"Notes: I love big-ass red ales, lots of flavour and character and it even packs a punch at 6.8% abv. This one went great with some Chinese Style Spare Ribs and Crab Rangoon."
"Its pours a rich ruby tinged dark amber with a solid beige head and loads of sticky lace. A fresh whole hop floral bouquet awakens the senses. Sweet malt, a hint of pears and a touch of warming alcohol add to the overall excellence of the aroma. Toasty malt, light toffee, hint of chocolate and light sweetness is revealed in graduating degrees as it warms. Sharp grapefruit, orange peel, lemon grass and hint of metallic bite make up a wonderful and lively hoppy flavor. The whole creation blends and balances as this fine brew warms, though hops are clearly the shining star here."
"This beer poured a deep, red, chestnut color with creamy, off-white foam that settled but coated the glass. The smell was a good hoppy and malty aroma with notes of oak and caramel. The taste was dominated by the hops which gave an astringency to the beer, but flavors of caramel, floral hops, and even a slight sweetness were also present. The mouthfeel was very dry with medium body and carbonation. The dry astringency was balanced somewhat by a slight sweet and tangy feel on the tongue. This was a very nice and very hoppy brew. Very enjoyable."
"Appearance: First off massive tan moutnainous thickets of fluffiness within the head complemented by the color of the deep ruby amber brown tone this one's great already just in appearance, when it comes to lacing this one layers each ring on thick and even beautiful beer. Aroma: Beautifully balanced with spurts of hops exploding in the air piney and floral just oh so good, hints of some peated malt a very mild smokiness toasted nuts are just some of the tones I am picking up from malt profile. Taste: Not nearly as hoppy as the aroma wonderful balance but distinct in your face flavors making a wonderfully melded brew from Healdsburg, CA. Piney hops with a perfect balance of mildly sweet toasted and slightly musty yeast tones awesome flavor here so good and balanced making this another 22oz that goes down way to effortlessly. Mouthfeel: Fuller medium bodied beer with a perfect carbonation level for imbibing and enjoying, this beer is succulent and I could just picture pairing it with a medium cooked filet mignon. The flavors seem to be able to coexist in perfect harmony. Drinkability: As I said earlier in the review effortless, but it's much more than that when you edge with each sip toward an empty glass you start to lessen the size of your sips and yearn for another bottle to appear that's what should happen with every great drinkable beer this one hold's true all so well."
"Not my favorite of their styles, but a good one."
"Dark copper color with a beige frothy head that settles quickly, but leaves a thick bubbly film atop. Smell is sweet and fruity, with some hops and florals punching through, and then a definite alcohol tingle. Flavor is big and round and rich and creamy. Real nice feel rolling over the tongue. It's full of so much - toffee and malt and honey and sweet pear, hits the back of the tongue with butterscotch, and stings the back of the throat with alcohol. Very warm and rich and ever changing flavor. This is very complex and makes you want more to keep looking for more nuances. Pretty drinkable for a big beer."
"Notes: Very good beer, very smooth flavor. Good attempt at a bold american scottish style. Smoked beers tend to tire out my taste buds after a while. You wouldn't catch me drinking more than one of these in a row, unless I was at a smoked beer festival or something..."
"It drinks very nicely. Not too heavy. A very nice version of the Scottish Ale variety. For my personal taste it is a bit sweet. A nice diversion for me when I do not want an IPA. Well crafted."
"583"
"Billed as a Scottish red ale, this brew is definitely a hoppy interpretation of the style...but quite good nonetheless, and I suppose to be expected from the west coast. It pours a dark reddish brown with a light tan head that leaves nice lace rings throughout consumption. The nose is quite complex; fruity, light english toffee (which personally I distinguish from caramel when it seems just slightly buttery) and citrus...all nicely integrated, nothing dominates. The aromas don't quite translate to the tastebuds. PNW hops are evident along with some caramel and just enough bitter roasted barley. I don't get the smokiness that others have mentioned. The mouthfeel seems to be on the thin side for a 6.8% abv beer. All in all, a very tasty brew."
"A deep red colored scotch ale with a medium beige head. Aroma is malty, with a hint of smoke and peat. Roasted malts are slighlty sweet, with a nice mellow hop signature. Some sweetness. Finish is clean and soft. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, some sweetness."
"Originally sampled on 13 February 2003. Had this on draught at the Anthill Pub @ UC Irvine. This pours a beautiful dark reddish brown color. It's clear, w/ a tan head. Nice hoppiness, but not to the degree of über-IPA's on the West Coast. Leaves you w/ a warm glow."
"This is a very well built flavorful beer. However, it is not for the light of heart or taste for that matter. Pours a deep reddish brown with a heavy cream head. The aroma of heavy peat smoked malt and roasted toffee is very inviting. The flavor follows along the same lines with a hearty smoky smooth malt flavor and thick body paired with a moderate bitterness and a creamy finish."
"Mucho gracias to Gusler for making this meeting possible!"
"Surprisingly dark color, but lighter in flavor. An interesting interplay between the lighter malt and tartnes of a red and the more substantial malt heft of a Scottish ale, with a touch of roasted porter thrown in for good measure. A tasty and satisfying beer."
"Wasn't anything like I expected but completely satisfied none the less. Was expecting a Red Ale but this is more like a cross between a Red Ale and A Porter. Poured thick with a beautiful fluffy head and thick lacing around the glass as I drank it. In fact, I was really impessed by the thickness of the lacing and the beautiful almost mountain-like head. Tasted real nice with a great balance of hops (just enough to provide some fragrance and bitterness) and malt which was of a toasty smoky Stout like roast. This was my first encounter with Bear Republic and surely a sign of good things to come."
"This is one hell of a bastardization of a Scotch Ale...those Scots never had access to these kinds and amounts of hops! Regardless, it works!"
"The head is thick but not deep, the typical Bear Republic foamy, rippled, moon-surface head. Interesting aroma of malt. Interesting taste. How to put this in a category? First, some malt, then a smoky, smoky burn. The malt tries but is overcome by hops and charcoal. Bitter aftertaste. Starts sweet, but just cannot end there. On the bottle, BR says, ""this unfiltered, bottle-conditioned, amber-colored ale breaks all style molds."" True. I do not know what to call this thing. It is like a scotch ale, but it also has Belgian spiciness, a Marzen snap, and a stout-like sourness. Who cares what category it lands in? They admit that it does not fit, and that is resplendent honesty. This is a fun beer. I will keep one in the back of my fridge."
"An excellent, tweaked IPA, and a very fucked up Scotch Ale."
"Cherry stained tea topped by pale tan head that is nicely creamy and lasting. The aroma is sweet and has a slight hop bite. Nicely malty flavor, toffee, smoky peat, really doughy character. Teh hops don't quite seem to match the malt though. Obviously not in the same class as Hop Rod Rye and Racer 5 but still a quality beer."
"Thanks to Valleyboy for the sample through the Christmas beer exchange."
"Carefully poured it's fairly clear with just a few specks of yeast sediment. I personally prefer it with the yeast - and give it a swirl - but it still remains just hazy (not cloudy). The body is a very deep copper and it's topped by a frothy ivory head that holds exceptionally well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma offers some sweet, lightly smoky and caramel-tinged malt as well as some grassy and spicy hops (although it doesn't really become apparent until it warms). The full body is accentuated by a natural carbonation from bottle conditioning - restrained (@ 2.2 vol CO2) with very tiny bubbles - and it's quite creamy and smooth across the palate. Very nice! The rich grassy hops are the first thing that's noticed in the flavor, followed by some soft sweet malt and a touch of smokiness as it crosses the palate before finishing with a rousingly dry and bitter finish. Long lingering hop flavors and some residual smokiness keep it interesting and remind you that you have a beer in front of you! Very well done and quite enjoyable. Also very unique as well. Well worth trying!"
"Citric hop aroma hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Pours medium-brown in color, well-carbonated, with a half-finger head. Aroma remains quite hoppy as the beer sits, though caramel-like malt notes eventually begin to shine through. Big cascade hop flavor up front. So big, in fact, that I begin to wonder about the appropriateness of calling this a Scotch Ale. Good grainy malt body with some real depth -- caramel sweetness and some very light toasted notes. You need to enjoy it quick, though, because the hops don't let themselves be overpowered for long. Finish is very bitter and remains present in the aftertaste which is citric and fruity. Great beer -- reminds me more of a notched-up Sam Adams lager than a Scotch Ale, but if you're looking for a good bitter amber, this is a good way to go."
"The beer begins a nice limpid deep garnet color the head imposing and frothy in its texture, leaving a thick glutinous sheet of lace to seal off the glass. You are greeted by malt, and some light to middling floral tones from the hops, fresh and quite pleasing to the senses. Begins sweet, the top is middling in feel, the finish bitingly acidic, the hops spiteful in their spicy bite, and the aftertaste dry and what a Hoot, another winner from this most excellent brewery."
"If you get the chance I would suggest that you stick one of these on your Launch Pad and go for a couple laps of the Earth in GeoStationary Orbit. Rock-It!"
"Slightly hazy candy apple red color with a huge creamy tan head that leaves a great looking lace all the way down the glass.  Huge sticky piney hoppiness with some subtle citrus fruit aromas as well.  Light malt aroma that keeps the smell in check.  Nice strong and sweet malty taste starts things off in this brew.  Nice bittering hop finish that lingers nicely on the tongue.  Excellent tangy hoppy characteristics in this brew make it very tasty.  Nice and smooth brew that is rather tangy on the tongue but yet a nice sweetness as well.  Great brew and this brewery is now two for two in my book.  Excellent brews."
"Interesting combination of flavors.   American pine and citrus hop character dominates.  Some complex malt flavors, but a little lost.  A nice malt background, but a richer malt profile would have been nice since they call it scottish.  A pretty good beer, and well balanced, but the stong american hop character seems at odds to the malt profile and low esters.  Enjoyable nonetheless"
"Another outstanding ale from Bear Republic. Deep, dark amber color. Piny scent. Great head, although there wasn't much lace to decorate the glass. Awsome hop flavor that explodes in your mouth. This one is definately a keeper. Although, I think most of Bear Republics are keepers."
"Just not my kind of beer. A little to bitter from first sip to last gulp. Nice redish hue in the apperance, but after that it is just another average beer, at least for me!"
"Another grand slam by the folks at Bear Republic.  Butterscotch, alchohalic esters, an interesting malt characteristic, and a slow and mellow hop profile.  This is nothing less than a fabulous brew.  Rich & complex.  Heavy body, almost creamy texture.  The 6.8% is deceiving, it feels much higher.  Bear Republic, you have my admiration."
"Ruby in hue, toped by a light tan persistant head.  Dark caramel malt and a hint of roasted barley sharpness is accompanied by a piney hop nose.  Rich, chewy malt backbone to satisfy my malt cravings, and an assertively bitter, citrusy hop profile to satisfy my hop addiction.  Full bodied and satisfying all around.  This is Scotch heavy / IPA hybrid and a unique and delicious brew.  Just like Willy Shakes is the brew to have if you can't decide between a stout and an IPA, this is the brew to have if you can't decide between a Scotch heavy and an IPA.  Have your cake and eat it too."
"Pours with an excellent rocky head with long lasting Belgian lace over lighly hazy red nectar. Nose is biscuity malt and bready...very fresh! Taste is amazing, sweet malt notes balanced by a perfect amount of hopping, not enough to dominate but just enough to make the long finish nicely bitter and dry. This beer is wonderful to drink, a rich and warming red ale."
"Chunky and hazy deep copper color.  Big head that retains.  Caramel and Malt tones in the aroma.  Nice caramel maltiness in the taste.  Good citrus hop tones accent nicely.  A subdued bitterness that is very pleasant.  Great brew."
"It's red, it's hoppy, it's malty. What style is it? Who cares, it tastes pretty damn good. After enjoying Racer 5, this one's got me itching to try everything Bear Republic has put out. It has a nice tan head sitting on top of a pretty reddish-brown beer. Hops are more than noticeable in the smell and taste but nicely balanced by the malt. At close to 7% abv, it's dangerously drinkable. Force your macro-drinking friends to try it blindfolded. It might change their lives."
"This is a wonderful, wonderful beer - Richardo has done a great job with this beer.  Everyone should be able to enjoy this brew."
"Ok this is TOTALLY over hopped for a scottish. I hate to even call it a scottish but it is billed as a ""basterdized Scottish","breaks all style molds"" so since they were not trying to make a true Scottish I don't feel like they should be dinged on points for being out of style. Huge hop aroma, a nice scottish style malt presnece behind the agresive hop bitterenes. Enough malt to keep me happy and certainly enough hop to please the hopheads."
