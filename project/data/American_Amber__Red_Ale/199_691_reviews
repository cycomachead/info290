review_text
"I liked this. Poured it from a bottle in my  glass at home. A nice rich copper clear look with a off white nice head. Carbonation is low which is fine. A slight bread malt smell that stays with the taste with a hint of citrus for a subtle nice combination mouth feel. The foam head holds up well and provides nice lacing. Bought it with a mix and match six pack and will buy again."

"This beer had too light of a feel for me.  Nice smell of hops but lacked the taste to back it up."
"Overall - A decent amber here, but some things about it rub me the wrong way. The carbonation seems a bit too high and effervescent and the high bitterness level doesn't really seem to jive all that well with the overall taste. Not bad, but not great either. Not strong enough to be a repeat purchase for me."
""
"Tasted a little too raw"
"The color is the best part."
""
"Pours a clear deep amber/pale brown with a reddish hue producing 2 fingers of somewhat lasting, pale tan, foamy/frothy head that leaves a clumpy coating of streaky, webby lacing. Aroma is disappointing & promises little: thin toffee, caramel & earthy herbal hops. Taste is another kettle of fish altogether (no pun intended). The mouth is an intense version of the nose on steroids with dark bread, roast and nutty notes, more intense earthy hops & yeasty/malty fruity esters. The sip finishes with caramel, roast & nuts, fruit, some pepper & an increasing hop bitterness. Afrertaste is a dry, astringent & bitter bomb that is out of character for the style but most welcome to card carrying Hop-Heads such as myself. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, dry, creamy, silky with slight spice & a pleasant astringency. I don\'t remember an amber ale with this much bitterness."

"While not technically a session beer, I could have had another in a sitting had I picked up more than one bottle of this. This would be great to take along for a day of fishing as there's enough here to please any beer lover while not being too heavy-handed. Once again, Ballast Point has brewed a beer that's spot-on when it comes to a particular style while keeping a good toasted undertone and pretty crisp finish that wanted me coming back for more. Relaxingly nice stuff!"
"Overall - Decent, but not really my bag. Too much bitter earth and metallic flavor. Might be an old bottle, but hard to say. There's a bottling code on the bottom, but it's nigh impossible to read."
""
"Coppery color, and a bit coppery flavor too. Mildly malty aroma and bitter hops start-to-finish on flavor."
""
"Beautiful amber color but head dissipates quickly. Lovely floral hop aroma. Moderate bitterness but can taste the malt.  Mouthfeel seems typical for the style. Moderate carbonation. Overall a good example of the style. One that I don't frequently drink but should explore a bit more."

"Overall - I've never been a huge fan of amber ales.  Not to say that I dislike them, but they are not a style that I seek out.  They've always been the maltier little brother to pale ales to me.  With that being said I am trying to appreciate them, and I actually found myself enjoying this one quite a bit.  I haven't had a lot of others to put this one into context, but I'd say this is quite tasty overall.  3.75 paws."

"I like this beer for the most part, lingering bitterness in the finish somewhat puts me off. May not buy it again, because there's better beers out there."

"Pretty cool, wouldn't mind to find it easier, but that's out of the question unfortunately."
""
"not worth the price compared to sculpin, more like a lager profile"
""
"Color is right between the red on the bottle label and the brown of the beer bottle glass. Nice red glow in the sunlight with a creamy slightly orange tinted off white head. Good looking lace. Aroma is quite nice. Fruity and British-like with cherry, tangerine, flowers, creamy biscuits, fall spice (or something alike), earthy rooty tea.... Taste is brisk, fruity, earthy, and woody. Pear, cherry, some pine, and lingering grassy bitterness. Mouthfeel is prickly, fluid, and dry. Not a bad beer at all."
""
""
""
"doesn't taste like an ale, more like an amber lager"
""
""
"The caramel malts were a little overwhelming for me, even considering an amber ale."

"Nice beer I was expecting more hoppiness coming from Ballast Point. Despite the lack of hops this beer still has lots of flavor. There is a subtle bitterness to the beer but that really allows the malt flavors to come through . The most noticeable while not overpowering  was the roast malt flavor, giving the beer a nice mellow subtle coffee flavor. Very nice mouth feel to the beer it was very light but it still had a creamy aspect to the beer. The aroma was very mellow but at a restaurant I always have a hard time smelling my beer."

"You can taste the quality but the sweetness in the nose just doesn't do it for me. I'll bet there are plenty of people who like this one, but it isn't for me."

"O: This is far from the simple amber ales that flooded the market in the early days of craft. At its heart it is really more of an English ESB, and a well-made one at that. It's generously hopped in the American fashion too. Worth a look if you're into ESBs or want a change of pace. Don't just write it off as another boring amber ale."

"a style of beer that all too often does very little to nothing for me, but this one is something different and something special, leave it to ballast point for that. the color is great, largely clear with an almost ruby red amber color and a khaki head, thick and frothy and slowly fading, but it leaves spiderweb lacing as it drinks. the nose is hoppy and dry, the exact opposite of what we usually get in these beers. the hops have a subtle perfume character, bright and floral, a little tangy, citrus peel, clean though, only bitter enough to balance these richer grains out a little bit. is love to know which hops they used here, its so different, and for once the red malt base enhances hops for me, rather than crowds them out with sweetness. its super dry too, and at a low abv this is something i could drink endlessly. wishing my single would morph into a sixer pretty hard right now. one of the driest reds i can recall, and one of the most beautifully hopped. this is top tier for the style, no doubt. its exactly what my palate likes!"

"Beautiful deep amber color, excellent head retention. Aroma is dominated by toasty and fruity specialty malt, with a hint of citrus and pine. Flavor follows suit, but adding a fairly bitter finish. Well balanced, with notes of toffee and citrus countering, though the finish is more bitter than I'd prefer. Really wish I had purchased more of these. Fairly complex for an amber."

"I just love to Pop! The cap and start an inverted Glug! Following a pseudo-cascade, anything could happen, including overflow, which is what really set #TheOldLady off last summer. In this instance, I got three fingers of dense, puffy, tawny head with great retention. Color was Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, "

"Although it’s labeled as an “Amber Ale,” this seems coser to an ESB. Regardless of the style, it’s a sessionable amber-colored ale with a hop bite. Fans of sweeter, more malty amber ales might not care for this. I find it very drinkable, but wish I knew how old it really is. Just stamp the actual bottling date on the bottle, fer cryyi! Don’t make us do math with what turns out to be a wrong number!"

"Another solid brew from Ballast Point. It pours a beautiful rich amber color with modest head. The beer has a sweet malt aroma with just a touch of citrus hops. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is a strong caramel malt presence with a hop bitterness that is reminiscent of bitter citrus. Overall, I cannot say this is the best Amber Ale I have had; but, it is certainly one I'd grab again."

"Calico Amber Ale has a great deep amber hue, however with my experience it is a bit lacking as far as a nice sudsy head is concerned. It is adequately carbonated and has good clarity though. Aroma is fresh, with sugary citrus fruit, molasses and biscuity notes. The flavor is very malt forward, which suits the style, however it may be a just a tiny bit too sweet for my tastebuds. It is somewhat bold and has moderately heavy body to it. The mouth feel is very full and the finish has some desirable bitterness to it, and it lingers nicely. While I don't normally reach for amber ales on the store shelf, all things considered, this is an excellent beer."

"The Verdict: Not bad. They call it an “ESB inspired ale,” which is pretty much on the money. More ESB than Amber, and a good quality one at that."
"I enjoyed this beer, it had an odd hop bitterness, that I wasn't expecting.American hops that offer a crisp bitterness and unique floral aroma. I got some toffee, but not much of a caramel taste, which is usually the case with most Amber Ale's. I do get some vegetable feel from this beer as well."

"All and an OK beer... under delivered to my expectation"

"Refreshing, bitter and tasty beer, just love this style. Perfectly balanced and incredibly easy to drink. Is this and American Amber Ale or an ESB with an American twist? Two very compatible styles anyway."

"This beer had a nice rich amber color, and a bitter caramel malt aroma. Flavor was very nice, with generous grapefruit up front, and finished with a bitter caramel/toffee. Nice hoppy punch! Medium-bodied, medium head. Beer had a great deal of character, and a nice hoppy feel. Finished somewhat dry. Great beer!"

"The Ballast Point Calico Amber is the best beer Ii have tried so far today....its number 4. The beer poured a nice clear amber with thin slightly offwhite head that is leaving a fine lace. The scent had a rich caramel malt. The taste is a gloriously balanced beer...there is a sharp bitterness to start then the sweet malt help to cleanse the pallete. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a wonderful sessionable beer. I would buy a 12/6/24 pack....no problem."

""

"O- A decent beer, and enjoyable. Nothing is really mind blowing about it, but it is a quality, drinkable beer, that brings a lot of flavor to a 5.0% abv beer."
""
"Great copper color nice carbonation with a genuine balance of hops and malts on the front. Bread, dough on the nose. I liked just about every component of the Calico with the exception of the finish which imparts a very strong bitterness but hey its an ESB so what do you expect. Its not my favorite from Ballast Point (Sculpin or Big Eye) but its a good alternative to a typical ESB. 2013 Labeling is way different from what is posted here at Beer Advocate."
"It's a decent beer but I wasn't bowled over by it."
""
"O-Nice solid amber ale....more ESB like with the malt flavors....solid"
""
"Slightly foggy reddened amber with a tall head of froth that doesn't stick around for too long. Smells fruity with some rounded malt, berries, raisins, floral hops, and a slight warm toastiness. Fruity yeast esters, creamy, somewhat biscuity malts, tea-like hops, pear, and a long bitterness that seems a bit out of place. Nice mouthfeel...medium bodied with some texture. Decent all around, though I was expecting more of an obvious San Diego style hop influence and this seems to be more on the British side of things."
""
"Overall: A very solid take on the Amber/Red Ale style. Good bitter hop presence with a good sweet caramel malt balance."
""
""
""
"O/D-A solid brew but far from a memorable one. It fils to distinguish itself but its far from bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid amber, easy drinking, and well balanced. Will get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not much to say for or against it. Doubt I would seek it out again though."
"Coppery ale with a tawny foam that persists leaving rings of lace. Smells like heavy whipping cream, slightly sugary, honey, cream. It's rather unique and I'm digging the smell. Taste is earthy, spicy, lightly citrus, honey, mildly bitter and lightly sweet. Medium body has some creaminess and holds together well. Overall this is a pretty tasty amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a perfectly executed everyday Amber. There really is nothing to complain about; it just isn't the kind of beer that I want to return to over and over again. I think that is my personal flaw and not any fault of this very well made beer."
""
""
"Overall: I must say I'm not usually a huge fan of the style, but this beer really works for me. It takes out a lot of the over-sweetness and biscuity character and replaces it with lemony hops. Weird? Maybe. But I like it a lot."

"Price Point - $1.67/12 oz single"
"O- nice tasting amber low ABV highly drinkable"

"Atmosphere is really strong. Nice foamy head, with some fair spotty lacing. Great nose consisting of sweet components, balanced with peat. Woody and peaty with a character of fresh flora, a a bit of a hop bite. A little shallow, steely, and bitter in the finish which I normally wouldn't consider characteristic of the style."
""
"This is an extremely robust beer at 5% abv. It's well crafted and they didn't take any short cuts. Well crafted and very impressive. Recommended."

"o - good beer but didn't wow me in any way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance of this is almost exactly like good amber maple syrup, I hesitate to give a five because can imagine such a perfect colour. The smell was rather fruity and left a crisp feeling in my nostrils. The taste is hardly bitter, and has a nice fruity taste with just a hint of...I can't place it. It flows into the mouth and after a few swirls stills taste unbitter and non-foamy."

"Picked up growlers of Calico Copper Amber and Big Eye IPA from Ballast Point brewery after making a 2 hour drive there. Pours a beautiful amber red with a slightly khaki fluffy head which dissapates into an even lacing around the glass. Aroma of sweet caramel, pears, white grapes, sweet lime and citrus. Strong flavor of caramel, fresh bread, buttered toast, cereal; lime and huge grapefruit flavors coming from the hops. Mouthfeel is medium thin with a very appropriate carbonation bite. Delicious and extremely balanced. As close as you can get to the perfect session beer."
""
""
""

"A decent Amber Ale, nice balance of malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is good. I have only had one other amber ale before *Lagunitas Lucky 13 (which I really enjoyed) but all in all im not too familiar with the style. That being said I felt like this beer could have been better and would have really benefitted from some more hops."
"Bit too tangy to be quaffed, but not quite enough complexity to excite the American hop fan in me. Still, nicely made beer and worth drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a good amount of hoppiness, but also being slightly sweet to keep it as an amber. Reminds me of Hop Back from Troegs."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability was smooth and easy. Overall, a solid, if not particularly notable example of the style. Not worth seeking out, but a pleasant enough brew if you happen to see it."

"12oz bottle thanks mikeg67. Pours a deep amber color with a medium tan slowly fading head, some light lacing. Aroma and Taste of floral citrus hops, yeast and fruity notes, bready, with some lightly toasted caramel malt. Palate is a medium body, crisp fresh mouth feel with good carbonation. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malt, yeast and fruity, some bready notes with some citrus floral hops for balance. Overall a good solid flavorful amber ale."
""
"Overall- An ok beer, doesn't have the caramel notes that I prefer in an amber. Not much going on."
"Overall- Just above average. Worth trying but don't expect too much. Around a 3.5 or solid B."

"O - Summing it up: I'm a Ft. Collins native, I cut my craftbeer-lovin teeth on Fat Tire and Alaskan Amber so amber ales are near and dear to me. I have to admit, Ballast Point has a deft touch when it comes to this style too!"
"*Insert calico cat joke here...I'm above such feline references. Clearly.* This stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises perfume-y toffee, very light mint, and a hint of flowers. The taste holds notes of mild greens, mild flowers, sweet toffee, and some orange peel in the back, resulting a sort of off, funky mess. It's hard to put into words beyond that. Just know that I took it as a negative. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a strange little amber, one that just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
"Overall - A simple, tasty beer. Nothing too fancy or sophisticated. Imagine a classic California pale ale (Sierra Nevada or Firestone) with a touch more malt and a bit less hops."
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid amber/red ale. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Clear and reddishn amber in color, with a frothy white head....the beer has a very malty and earthy hop smell. Aroma intensity is stronger than. Expected, which is very welcomed. Malt, toasted and breads, plays a large part in the profile of this brew. Hops are there, but malt is centric. The taste is balancedm with a toast crust and bitter hop. Some fruit...apricot and peach in the shadows. Firm body. Slightly carbonated. Long and bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and crisp on the tongue. Pretty straight forward malty amber ale, slightly forgettable though."
""
""
"o: Overall this beer was not a great choice for my palate. Complex flavors overwhelmed my desire for more."
"O: This may not be my favorite from Ballast, but it's a solid offering nonetheless."
""
"A fairly substantial sweetness makes up the malty backbone, with an aroma of lemon and caramel. The bitterness makes its way forward for the long finish. Quite an acceptable quaff of a more robust sort of Amber Ale. While nothing special, this defines the style. This should appeal to those liking a hoppier Amber, but it's definitely in the maltier vein with a murky aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Balanced, but I don't want that from San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - didn't care for this one much. It's about 9 months old, it shouldn't be too old to show what it has. I do pick up some good hoppy flavors and to its credit, once my palate sort of adjusts, some of the subtler off flavors are minimized. I'd try it again."
"Overall not something I would seek out again its somewhat heavy, balanced, yet not close to Nugget Nectar or any sweeter amber I prefer. It's very hard to judge being this old but other reviews agree it's far from exceptional."
""
""
""
"Appearance is a nice amber/copper color with a finger of beige head. The head had good retention and it left extensive lacing on the glass. There is a touch of malt and a touch of hops in the nose. The taste is similar, but I'd say more hop forward than malt forward. The whole offering was a touch thinner than I would like, but it is a really nice blend of flavors none-the-less."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a good amber ale, it seems as though the maker attempted to blend a lot of sweet malt with a good amount of peppery and oily hops. Except for all of the tastes hitting the tongue on the front end the maker largely succeeds. There is a funky yeast taste that I don't really like and I don't believe fits this style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper in color with a light khaki head. Fluffy with big bubbles and good retention. Did not get a lot with the nose, some caramel malts , orange zest. Taste showcased the sweet malts, bread caramel and little orange. Med mouthfeel with good carbonation. Very good representation of the style."
"Taste follows... Slightly roasted malt and with a good amount of caramel malt sweetness and some faint citrus hops. Pretty easy to drink, but doesn't pop for me. I wanted to like this one more, but it feels like some of the flavor was held back. I prefer a Red with a little more substance and personality...like Red Racer from Bear Repub."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body and carb. Finishes mostly clean."
"Overall this brewery hasn't let me down yet. They load up their brews with a great hop profile. Great for those who arent looking for something as bold as an IPA. Would be glad to drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark copper with a foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. A foamy curtain of lace coats the entire glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hops. Taste is much the same with a floral flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the mouthfeel is not all that great."
""
""
""

"O: The balance and smoothness makes for an extremely drinkable and sessionable brew. Although enjoyable the beer fails to stand out. A beer that I will enjoy when around but not one that I will actively seek out."

"O - Solid beer and I'd love to have more of this. Calico gives just enough hoppy bite to make it interesting, plenty of malt for the body, and is sessionable enough to have a few. Great every occasion beer."
"Very good!"
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 1/18/2013. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, floral, orange zest, grass, and herbal. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, toast, biscuit, orange zest, floral, toffee, light nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of hop/malt flavors that feel fairly robust; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice amber ale. Very nice malt and hop flavor balance with good complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering, no complaints at all."

"Solid effort...an amber that leans more to the hops than most that I've had, so that if that's what you're looking for this would be recommended."

""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a great beer and one I will go back to."
""

"The aftertaste is unusual for the style - a considerable bitter bite. Overall, this is an amber that works for me. I also need to revisit my other BP reviews and give them a slight boost. I had a couple yesterday and today and they are great."
""
""
"Super sticky head. Big oily hop nose. Floral and pine with citrus notes. Pretty clean beer with a big bitterness. Bitter throughout with big floral hop presence on the tip of the tongue. Undertones of caramel malts with some grapefruit and citrus. Pretty big body with big carbonation but the flavors hold up well to it. Good beer, but for the expensive cost of this six pack theres a bunch of other ambers i'd take over it. Slick and sticky but not overbearing. again, a good beer, just a steep price tag. at the same price as big eye IPA i'd take big eye."
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours reddish-amber with a long lasting, fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is of piney hops, caramel and ripe fruit. Body is medium and tangy. Citrusy, piney hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit combine on the palate. Finish is long and grapefruity. Excellent brew could drink it whole day."

"Poured a light amber with an off white head and decent lacing. Loved the smell. . . very sweet, bready, with fruity notes that add to the complexity to the nose. Taste is sweet malt off the bat, ending with a pretty strong hop presence on the tail end. Feel is a a bit thin, but not necessarily a liability as I could certainly imagine a session of a few of these. Good beer. . . not sure why there's a huge mouthed fish on the bottle."

"This is a decent amber ale though a bit sweet. The citrusy hops lend a sweet fruitiness to the already sweet, bready malt character. It's easy to drink, but in the end simplistic. I wouldn't turn this down though."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a nice medium reddish color with a nice creamy off white head. Head clung extremely well. Aroma was nice and malty, a small bit of spicy sweetness in the backend. Taste was very slightly hoppy piney upfront, and then switched to a sweet slightly fruity with a tad of a spicy kick. Felt a bit over tangy on the tongue, but otherwise coated well and was nicely carbonated. Overall not bad, but the tangy was an unexpected kick."
""
"A solid choice amber ale. Has that signature Ballast Point hop character, which is far from a bad thing. Will consider having another before the tap gets rotated. 4.0"

"A great session ale here, a very good brew to have several of. Lots of flavors the appearance is top notch. Great session amber/brown here."

"O: Nice. Nothing bad to say about this beer. All around good solid amber ale."
""
"Smooth on the tongue with a peppery bite of carbonation and slight hop bitterness. Well balanced and easy to drink. Not the best beer I've ever had but a solid drinker. Very nice."

"C-"

"T: Slight roasted malt and coffee with a good amount of caramel malt sweetness and some lingering citrus hops. Very easy to drink and a pretty solid amber."
"O- Reminds me a little bit of a Fat Tire with more bitterness and less sweetness than Fat Tire (although I much prefer Fat Tire to this). Overall this is a pretty average beer. A little too watery and not a very exciting flavor profile, but it is a very easy drinker."
""
"A very solid amber, does a good job to have full flavor with enough hop bitterness to be balanced. Ballast point has good beers across their line and Calico does that statement justice."

"DOA"
"Notes: most of this brewery's offerings are considerably more costly by the bottle than your average microbrewery's. Calico Amber Ale was the cheapest I came across at $2.25 a bottle. Taste-wise, it almost crosses over into brown ale territory."
"Overall - A pretty decent amber ale here. Nothing remarkable, but very drinkable and good."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and very sessionable. The beer has pleasant flavor that improves as the beer warms and the low ABV makes it one you could have several during a session. I like this beer though it is not as great as some of the others from this brewery."
"This is a very nice red. I'm glad BP is coming out this way."
""
"Calico is an incredibly easy to drink and is yet another reason to be happy Ballast Point is now in Ohio. Recommended."
"O - very godo amber ale"
"Taste-Toasted malt,caramel,biscuit, and a nice little fruity hop bite that adds to a nice balance with the toasted malt. Overall, a decent, sessionable brew."

"On tap at the Common Table in Dallas. The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get a lot of floral and citrus notes, as well as quite a bit of bread and toffee from the malt. The flavor is much more of the same. I get some orange notes from the hops, as well as some grass, floral and perfume notes. There is also quite a bit of biscuit malt and a little bit of toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Overall (2.5): the only impressive part of this beer is the appearance - great lacing, especially near the top. Otherwise, way too sweet."

"O - Great session amber, not particularly hop forward or malt forward."
""
"O - An excellent light pale ale. Drinkability is very high."
""
"Overall: A-/B+"

"O: Not a terrible amber ale and certainly a hop forward option for someone seeking the ubiquitous 5% ABV American Red Ale. Ballast Point has hoppier and tastier options, but this is a nice stab for their session brew, I suppose."
"O - This is a nice, drinkable and sessionable offering from Ballast Point. I think the mixture of malt and hop profiles is well done, and the hint of bitterness and sweetness works well with the overall flavor. This does the trick if you want a good all-around and easy-drinking beer to enjoy over the course of the night."

""
""
"I poured this brew into a Becker Pint glass. I was treated to a perfect Amber hued brew that delivered about a fingers worth of khaki head that left impressively good lacing. I brought the glass to my nose and took in a deep whiff was greeted by aromas of toasted malt and pleasant hop notes. The flavors of toffee, caramel and toasted malt combined to make one of the most unique and inspiring beers I've tasted in a long time. When drank this brew has an almost chewy like mouth feel to it and lacks nothing in it's character."

"O - Tasty and sessionable beer. Not the best I've had from Ballast Point, but still decent."
"D - Not bad, I was hoping for a more hop forward beer, and while this beer is balanced it is very much about the sweet, malty side rather than the hops. Drinkable, but not something I'm real excited about."
"Easy to drink, though not super complex. Worth a try."

"Not the best beer by any means from Ballast Point, but has a respectable position in their lineup."

"it's an american amber: hop forward, piney, dry. it is SOLID."
"Pours a beautiful copper with a chunky head and excellent lacing. Looks very appetizing. Smell is vibrant with bitter hops, citrus, pine. Taste follows the nose, with a decent malt presence. Some citrus bitterness lingers on the back end. Perhaps just a tad overcarbonated? Excellent brew, tough to find faults. Another winner from Ballast Point."
"Notes: A very solid beer very sessionable that has a good malt backbone. Cheers."
"This poured out with a really nice rich looking copper amber color. The head is solid and has a good retention, not much lacing but still has a good appearance. The smell of the beer is hoppy and had a decent sweetness. The taste of the beer is nicely hopped and quite bitter. The sweet caramel flavors comes through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall this brew was pretty good."
"Not a bad drop. Sessionable, with enough character. No, it's not the most exciting brew in the world, but it's solid."
"O- A good effort from Ballast Point on this one. A bit on the hoppy side which is not my style. Refreshing and fruity and I would probably drink this offering again. Fairly well crafted with a good blend of flavors-"
"A very nice interpretation of what can be deemed a bit of a boring style. Quite like it, especially for this time of year in Sydney, Australia where it is 15-28 degrees celsius."
"O: overall, I'm pleasantly surprised for what I mistook as an accessible beer to the masses. This one borderlines an IPA but is probably best summed as a West Coast Amber or red. Ballast Point is quickly becoming my new favorite brewery I hadn't really discovered until now."
"I'd won't hide the fact that Calico is one of my favorite beers ever. I wouldn't argue it's something you could really compare to an IPA like Sculpin, but that doesn't diminish its qualities considering it's not that type of beer."
"O: Another great brew from Ballast Point, I haven't been disappointed yet, would happily have more of this amber."
"O: Solid Amber ale. Nice color and lacing, an inviting aroma, and a crisp malty taste."
"Deep copper in colour with a little haze and a dark beige cap. Decent head retention with some streaky lacing. Malty caramel aroma, a little grassy and biscuity. Same in the flavour, some nuttiness, moderate bitterness, a touch of pine and mint in the finish. Light to medium bodied with lowish carbonation. Overall, pretty solid and drinkable."
"D. Really nice and drinkable but not really thirst quenching. Very tasty and I would certainly drink this again."
"I’m sure this would have been much better out of a pint glass or bottle, but sometimes you have to go with what you have. Will give it another try and check the ratings then."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer I hold a special spot for ambers as they were my favorite when I got into craft beer and this one steps it up some with additional hops to keep thing interesting worth getting if you see it around"
"I have had this a few times now and it's just not for me, its not a bad beer but I always feel it has off flavors."
"Wow, another great beer from Ballast Point. They're somewhat hard to come by here in the NE but everyone I've had so far has been exceptional. This one has a dark amber, slightly cloudy color and great aroma. Hops and malt are very well balanced, with spicy notes and the faintest hint of the booze. So drinkable! I love the way BP is able to really bring out the hoppy flavors and all their subtleties without overwhelming the palette with pure bitterness. Highly recommended."
"Citric and grassy notes intertwine with stronger bready and caramel aromas. It's fairly nimble in spite of the thickish caramel body, with juicy citrus and anice bitter streak cutting through the sweetness. Earthy and toasted flavors float in and out at times, especially in the finish. Nice little amber ale here."
"There are a few great mysteries in the food/drink world: how do they get the caramel in the Caramilk bar? What's in Coca-Cola's secret formula? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie-Pop? And now we must also wonder how Ballast Point balances Calico Amber with so much fruity, Madeira-like richness *and* coffee cake and honeycomb toffee flavour *and* so much zesty American hoppiness. Thanks Ultraman9000!"
"O: I quite enjoyed this brew, though I must admit it was not at all what I expected. I found this to have more of a tart, citrus flavor, which I am guessing were lent by the hops, instead of the more roasted, malt-centric ambers I am used to. I found the mouthfeel to be a bit odd, as well, coming off as almost mineral water-like with a very crisp finish that left almost no risidual matter on the tongue. That said, it is quite drinkable and even refreshing, I must say. It is quite on par with other beers in the Amber category, though it will not wow you in any way. Cheers!"
"Poured into a nondescript pint glass, a clear tangerine-amber color with a thin, wispy head. Pretty basic aroma, with a decent balance of citrus hops and sweet caramel malts, almost reminiscent of an APA. Basically the same in the taste, with a nice balance of the malt and hop elements. Very nice for an amber ale. Meduim mouthfeel, and very easily drinkable."
"The brew pours amber, obviously, with decent head and lace. The nose is a bit of toasty grain, but herbal dankness explodes on the palate. The disparity between mellow grain aroma and surprisingly vibrant hop flavor creates an intriguing dynamic. Lighter than medium, soft carbonation. Very drinkable and a nice example of the style. It is actually one of my favorite BP brews overall."
"Poured out an amber color with about half an inch of fluffy slightly off white head. A light biscuit malt aroma with a tangy fruit hop aroma. Flavor is light and bready malt with a light citrus hop bite. Finishes with a sweet and tangy malt/hop finish. For the light malt body it has a full character. Creamy bready malt body and tangy hop finish."
"O: overall a good beer and i am glad i tried it, but probably wouldn't buy it again."
"I picked up a bottle of this one at the brewery/home brew mart in Linda Vista. Poured a nice clear copper hue, with a decent off-white head on top. Aromas of biscuit, light grain and grassy hops. On the palate, this is an easy drinking beer, light bodied and refreshing, with flavors of grassy hops, oranges and light caramel."
"Overall - An excellent Amber ale and very quaffable... this is something i wish i always had access to.. recommended"
"Overall this is a good beer either to savor or as a session beer. I am a hophead but I can enjoy a well constructed malty beer too."
"O: A nice warm weather, near session beer, by a fantastic brewery."
"MF: Easy drinking light/medium body. Beer slides down and doesn't stick or coat the mouth, though lingering floral hops remind you what awaits the next sip."
"D: Overall, it drinks very smoothly and is a fine example for the style. I'm looking forward to trying more from this brewery."
"I have been very spoilt lately with all these great American beers that i never usually see but am seeing alot of now and this is another it pours a see through light copper hue that has nice carbonation which leaves behind a cream coloured two finger head that quickly recedes to a layer of froth and some sporadic lacing,the smell is quite nice with hints of peanut brittle,sticky toffee and some floral hops,it has a light-medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel which is perfectly suited to allow the tastes of butterscotch fudge,toffee,candied grapefruit all to make their own cameo before being finished off with a herbal,citrus hoppy bitterness which really rounds this brew out and for a Amber fan like myself i have had better examples but in saying that i could easily session on this brew anyday of the week."
"Drink- I need to get through a lot of the California beers as trading has calmed down and I need to develop some homer pride for CA as I have lived here for 10 years. I probably wont come back to this one, except for a nitro or a cask if ever in SD"
"Poured on nitro at the brewery, the beer was served in a pint glass. My wife and I actually ordered one on-tap and one nitro to do a side by side comparison. Most of this review will be in comparison to the on-tap version. The beer has a darker red coloring, with a foamier and lighter colored, big bubbled head. Slight sweet malt on the nose, but barely detectable. The body is rounder, and much creamier, and the hops flavors come across a bit muted. Nutty flavors are good and strong, but the hops leave it a bit unbalanced. Very smooth finish, with minimal aftertaste, almost watery. Amazing difference between nitro and tap."
"Overall: This beer is not amazing but it will grow on you especially because of the aroma appearance and mouth-feel."
"O - Ballast point continues to impress me with their solid offerings. Good solid amber ale."
"Brewed for JD Wetherspoons Spring Beer fest 2011 and slightly different at 5.2%. Looks quite nice, amber frothy head decent lacing. Smell muted but nice, floural hops, decent malt backbone slightly doughy. Taste is similar but hoppie rthan I expected, especially at first. Mellows out nicely and you get some sweet citrus and biscuity finish. Once again, I find almost all Cask ales to have amazing mouthfeel and this was no different. Smooth with perfect carbonation. Overall a very good beer, nothing exceptional but I would def have it again."
"This guy is actually a fairly dark amber. It could equally pass for a red ale. The head was very pretty: dense, good retention, a excellent lacing. On the nose, I couldn't get much other than yeast and malts, maybe a little orange peel? The only outstanding quality taste-wise is the hoppy/metallic finish, which plays well with the bubbly, sharp texture. Other than that, a very conservative amber ale, which for the genre, is par I guess. I enjoyed it but probably won't buy another sixer, only because I prefer the more complex Ballast Point varieties."
"Sort of uninspiring and bland compared to the regular bottled version - still decent with food though..."
"O - At 5%, and with such a great taste, this one is incredibly drinkable most any time."
"Pours a nice cherry wood color with a milky colored one-finger head. Nice lacing and retention. A bit of a dark fruit aroma, little caramel as well. Big malts. Dark cherries lead the way. Some sticky caramel and toffee notes as well. More subtle citrus hops and earthy notes round the beer out. Simple and well done. Really nice amber flavors."
"O: A quintessential craft session brew. This is a really nice everyday beer, and one I hope to have stocked in my cold fridge this hot summer. Ballast Point continues to impress, and their Calico Copper get my seal of approval."
"D - Stuff is quite drinkable and enjoyable but this very weird aftertaste, I just cant shake it. Really a shame. I want to like this beer, but I just cant bring myself to do so."
"Appearance is a medium amber tone with a one finger head. Its` smell is a mix of malts, hops, cookie dough and some spice. Taste has citrus hops, candy, with some sweet bitterness in the end. MF is medium. Drinkability is pretty good in this amber style from Ballast Point. A couple of these over the course of a leisurely meal would make a good fit."
"Pours a dark golden color with almost zero head. It has a semi-hopy aroma. At the first sip, the hop disappears and is taken over by a good amount of malt flavor. I think the malt overpowers the hoppiness. I did detect a little vanilla taste Its smooth, and what I like in any beverage, the start and finish is the same"
"D- oh it was drinkable.. dont you worry"
"D: smooth drinking beer, could definitely put down a lot of these"
"Overall: It's slightly ridiculous that this was my first time trying this and I've probably seen it more than a hundred times. It's smooth, drinkable, and damn tasty."
"D- Good amber ale that is well balanced. Low enough ABV to drink more than a few of these. I guess since Nugget Nectar set the standard for me this doesn't compare to that, but still a good offering from Ballast Point."
"Body is really well balanced, with enough fluidity to go with a full body. Carbonation is ample, but not overdone. Drinkability is excellent as well, as the hops get you ready for the next malty sip. Really, really well crafted beer."
"M/D: On the lighter side of medium. Had a little less carbonation than I was expecting. Overall very pleasant and easy drinking, would definitely get some...if only it was sold where I live."
"This is pretty solid for drinkability and would have again no problem."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly assertive amount of carbonation."
"Weird that the nose of this beer is so disappointing when everything else about it is nice. Some dry hopping could knock this one out of the park."
"Poured a golden red ale with great head and lace. A real hoppy, bitter hops more like it, and a thick malt presence as well. A smooth and creamy beer that has an off-kilter buttery sweetness which threw me for a loop. There is some hoppy goodness in this beer as well, I would say a mix of citric and grassy and there is that sweet edge as well as breadiness for a balanced beer. All around a good red ale and if you like them a little sweeter than the norm you'll like this one."
"Would be nice to get this fresh, as I can't figure out if there is any bottling code on here."
"Over all Id say this is an average amber. Nothing too special but I got it in the Ballast Point Variety Pack and I am glad I got to try it."
"D: This beer is easy to overlook, standing as it is in the shadow of some of Ballast Point's more hyped contributions. Still, it is a fine English-style pale ale with big flavors that is not out of place alongside Alesmith's Anvil ESB. In fact, it is what many were likely expecting the first time they ordered another of Ballast Point's beers: the Yellowtail (German-style) pale ale."
"A decent red ale, an odd mix of flavors, not a huge fan of the herbally hops. Other than Sculpin, Ballast Point hasn't impressed me much."
"I've had this on tap and bottle so far it's been a solid version of a west coast amber. Appears a deep caramel amber hue with a light khaki tan head forming fine even speckled lacing as it dwindles down. Aromatics offer up a slight caramel malt presence with a mild citrus/pine cone accented hops. Flavor has some sweet cereal grains with herbal/citru/pine hop combo, mild approachable hop bitterness not to brash and off putting but great flavor and balance within this beer's profile. Mouthfeel is lighter to medium bodied, smooth even carbonation levels, great feel hits the palate quaffable and refreshing. Drinkability, smooth session ale nice balanced mix of malts and hops not another generic amber ale."
"D- The score took a big hit due to the big presence of the soapiness and pickles. That makes it a one and done for me."
"Pours a nice rich red color, very little foam. smell is hops and very very little floral notes. taste is nice like smoked hops but not too hoppy nicely balanced, after taste is just hops. mouth feel is light goes down real easy. as far as drinkaility goes you could drink this beer all night long."
"Nice malty aromas with some metallic smells mixed in. Flavors a fairly full but the hops hit in pretty quick. I found myself noticing the hops more and more. Not bad but I will keep that in mind before I purchase again. This is a hoppy red but just keeps things in balance."
"Wow, surprised to find a bomber of fresh Calico Amber at a small shop I occasionally stop in. Paid $3.99 for the bottle. Very impressed with the rich ruby/amber color and lasting head. Smells of malt and some hops---nice zesty yeast too. Tastes really nice---complex blend of malt, bready yeast, some sweetness, and a kiss of bitter hops. Very nice body and mouthfeel. Emminently drinkable at 5% abv. This is as solid an amber ale as they come. A very good offering from Ballast Point. Salut!"
"Overall-great example of the style, all the right notes, stands up to any other version. Superb."
"A solid amber, but not the most exciting."
"This is a pretty good american red. The hop-forward style makes it stand out from it's peers. I'm not finding it to be exceptional, but a well-done beer that could absolutely tickle someone the right way."
"Drink well my friends"
"Overall this is a very nice beer. Another winner from Ballast Point and one to seek out."
"This ale pours a copper brown with lots of carbonation and has a big head. The head lasts a while and is lacey around my glass. The smell is unremarkable, just a typical scent of a Red/Amber Ale. The taste is good but not surprising its a little dry at the end and the bitter from the hops is muted by the maltiness and caramel flavors. The beer is rather light."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy."
"D-This is nothing special, but a fine example of the style. A good 6-pack for the autumn months."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink with just enough different flavors going on to keep it interesting. This is a good anytime beer to drink with friends or with dinner."
"Foams up very strongly with an average down the center pour, easily half the glass, settles down to about two fingers of a very delicate, fine tannish head, dimples appreciably, some larger bubbles coming out as a result, below average stickiness to the lacing. Deep amber to coppery orange-red, mild haze but still easy to see through it, metallic cast, just about exactly as you'd expect the liquid to look. Malty nose with ample milk chocolate, malted milk balls, caramel and fresh butter accents, this not to ignore the also powerful pine and pin to white grapefruit citrus, no lack of spine here, not quite floral but good amount of peach, nectarine, apricot fruit scents, ends with a bitter grass and wet kindling wood embers. Medium-bodied, hoppier here with the emphasis on the pine, fresh grass, white grapefruit and blood orange flavors, biscuits, the floral notes succeed better towards the end. Leaves your mouth dry with a tacky residue before half the glass is empty, the caramel, toffee, cocoa powder breaks a sweat to keep what little ground it gains, wish there were a little more sweetness for balance. Instead, you get heavy carbonation in an attempt to provide relief for the tongue. Less out to impress, more solid delivery would seal the deal."
"Drinkability: A very nice session beer from Ballast Point. Its good to see this versatile brewery is capable of making a hopped up session beer that won't ruin the palate."
"Drinkability is wonderful. Ballast Point has squeezed all te flavorthey could muster into this 5% Amber."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and its low alcohol content can make it sessionable. The drinkability improves as the beer warms up."
"Drinkability: The sweet taste and the balanced feel make this quite a balanced, drinkable brew."
"D: A nice malty beer that can certainly be sessioned."
"D - God I could quaff this beer all night. I love the balance of hops/malts, this is an exceptional Amber Ale. I highly recommend this beer, just outstanding! Can't wait to have this one again. Cheers!"
"Drinkability is high on this. It's smooth, goes down easy and tastes great for an amber ale. At 5%, this beer has got a lot of flavor and body."
"Picked up a single from Abe's with a mixed 6'er. It poured a tall head over a clear amber-red body. The aroma is a little odd, coming off like creamy cranberries. The flavor, however, is quite rich with nutty and toffee malts, citrus hops, and cranberry juice - quite a combination. The finish is dry, and almost astringent. I may not be a huge fan of the aroma, but this is an impressive beer. I can't remember the last amber I had that was this complex with just being crammed full of hops. What a nice surprise."
"D - Very, very easy to drink. More simple than some other BP fare, but delicious."
"A flavorful lighter beer that will be great for summer. This really knows what it is and does it well."
"D: The low ABV makes this a many beer in a session kind of beer, but this one is too hoppy for the style for my taste. Seems more like a Pale Ale than a Red Ale.... Color is good for a Red but the taste is more Pale Ale... I'm still not a big hops guy so this one is not my fav."
"Drinkability: It's a pretty good brew, but a little hoppy for my tastes."
"Drinkability: I'm drinking it, I'm not trying to savor it, but I'm not choking it down either. If I really liked the taste of hops or if the hops flavor was more balanced with other flavors then I would like this beer much more. I would drink this beer again if it was offered to me, but I prefer other American Ambers."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry caramel malt scent along with some bready, bisquit malts and a mild hop bitterness. The smell is good, but it seems it's a bit muttled. The taste is decent as well. It has a bitter hop bite up front along with a ton of breadiness and some caramel malt sweetness in the finish. It's bone dry and overly bready for my tastes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This may be a very good amber ale to some, but it's a little too complex for me. The bisquit character is too much."
"Pours copper to orange with some slight haze and generous white head. Nose is mostly citrus with some caramel too. On the palate the caramel comes through as well as some dark, sweeter malty flavors. Hops balance it out though, but to me they remain in the background. There's a complex malt sweetness in this ale. Great, smooth mouthfeel and easy drinking."
"Pours a nice dark copper with a good white head. The nose is a bit simple, with a dominant caramel breadiness to it. The flavor is nicer, with the caramel malt coming through as well as a nice, slight hoppiness. Medium body and good drinkability all around. By the end, I was really enjoying this."
"Nice beer and very drinkable. Enough going on to have this stick to your ribs."
"Not my favorite from Ballast Point, but a great beer to have on hand for any occasion."
"D - Good balanced flavors and a moderate alcohol content make this a great session beer."
"22oz bottle. Clear red-amber color, average head with lasting foam. Malty and herbal/grass aroma. Nice full caramel maltiness with a spicy hop flavor that balances really well. Well, the aroma is a little bland and subtle, but the flavor has a really nice balance. Not amazing, but well done and really drinkable."
"Poured a ruby-orange with thick off white head that lingered thru most of the glass and left great lacing. Nose was a pleasant mix of malty dark fruit, toasted nuts and honey with a hint of hopy citrus fruit. Mouthfeel was full, slightly tingly and almost chewy, and the taste picked up the flavors of the nose perfectly. Rounded off to a long, pleasant finish with a great aftertaste."
"I could drink a few of these."
"Damn good flavor, mellow on the hops, doesn't screw up your palate. Moderate abv makes this (and most of Ballast Point's year round offerings) a perfect session beer. I'm loathe to say anything from SD is better than LA ..."
"This one sits right at the benchmark for the style, easy to drink and very flavorful with the Californian flare. West Coast session ale all the way."
"D-very tasty and crisp, goes down nicely and would probably be great on a warm day"
"Poured a nice pumpkin copper orange with minimal white head. Smell was of some hoppy pines and citrus, as well as a fair amount of biscuit malt. Taste had more of that biscuit malt up front with a nice hoppy bite in back. Some caramel. A nice depth of flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. A little light on the carbonation. Drinkability is good. Goes down real nice."
"Reading the other reviews, I am kind of surprised and I think that I am drinking a different beer than they are. Perhaps it is past the date where it is still good and my store didn't rotate it for some reason. If that is the case, I apologize for my less than stellar review but nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend this beer and will probably not be getting it again."
"Tasty and drinkable, good representation of the style. Thanks to barleywinefiend for sending this one my way."
"A good hopped up American amber is one of my favorite styles,this fit the bill very well.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear...well copper amber with a fluffy 1 1/2 finger crown atop.A mix of deep caramel/biscuit malt and citric,piney hop,neither wins out leaving great balance.Big malty start with caramel and biscuit stickin out,the piney and citric hop presence comes through in a nice finish.I would give the nod to the malt by a narrow margin but there is more than enough hop profile going on."
"Very drinkable, when judged for style it's the best quality of this beer."
"Drinkability - I can easily see myself putting down a 6 pack of this stuff and hardly even realize it. Simply this beer is good!"
"I really enjoyed this. It won't change your life, but I think I found my new go-to Amber."
"Overall, will definitely buy again, this time in a 6 or hopefully on tap somewhere."
"Pours a deep amber color with a small white head that laces well. The smell is both sweet and bready at the same time. There's substance to the nose on this one. Not necessarily a lot going on here but there's substance. Taste is quite similar to the nose, of course. There's some residual sweetness but mostly just big bready malts and a lot of caramel malt as well. Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is excellent."
"Pours a copper color with a one finger off white head which leaves a small lace on the side of the glass. Smell and taste are of bitter grapefruit flavored hops and biscuit malt. Finishes dry. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, and fairly drinkable. A decent beer, but not a favorite of mine. Leaves a disagreeable bitter aftertaste."
"Was excited to hear that Rattle N Hum had this on cask. It poured a deep amber, and laced surprisingly well. Had a nice bouquet of citrus, woodiness, vanilla, and malty breadiness. The taste started with citrus and breadiness, but ended on a hop note. A little too bitter on the finish as well. The cask certainly gave it a nice mouthfeel, but I was expecting more from an American amber. The lack of overall balance in this beer didn't have me rushing to order another one, but I could certainly see this as a decent session beer."
"12oz. Poured amber with a slight haze and was topped with a frothy off-white head that held great retention and left some excellent sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aromas were caramely malty sweetness, brown sugar, vanilla, and toasted grains with faint hints of floral hops. Tastes were similar to aromas and very complex - biscuity, bready malt, brown sugar, and caramel notes with a slight hop bite on the bitter-sweet finish consisting of citrus notes and mild pine. Mouth-feel was fairly creamy and medium bodied with modest carbonation. This is probably hopped more than an amber should be, but I thoroughly enjoyed this take on an American amber ale."
"D: The low ABV and relative balance of sweet and bitter make it an easy drinker."
"Poured a nice amber color with a nice white head. Nose is is faint with caral and grain. Tastedoes not get going until room temp. A slight metallic taste colder but as it wared i got more caramel, maple out of it. Mouthfeel was good and drinkability was very good once it warmed up."
"D = This is a wonderful beer to go with a nice man-food dinner, like Porterhouse."
"D: This beer is awesome! Typically this is one of those styles that we pass over, but this may force us to change our prejudice towards the style."
"Medium bodied, well carbonated and very easy to drink."
"12oz bottle into a DFH snifter pours a murky dark amber with a decent amount of floaty sediment and a nice cappuccino-like frothy light-tan head that lasted to the end and left great lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice balance of Earthy citrus hops and caramel malts. The taste is a wonderful balance of sweet caramel malts and citrus hops with hints of vanilla pine. The beer is quite light, crisp and refreshing, great session brew. This is a truly exceptional Amber, but I expect nothing less from Ballast Point."
"Pour a pretty, dark amber color (almost ruby) with an average egg-shell colored head that dissipated into a light ring. The brew has a nice hoppy aroma, not strong but nice. A nice fresh juicy hop, some grapefruit; some caramel malt in the end. A very nice hop forward amber ale. Again, nice juicy hop, has a fresh taste with little hop bitterness. Solid caramel malt body to add a backdrop to the hops. The flavors aren't crazy but are nice, perhaps a poor mans nugget nectar. The feel is light to moderate, semi-soft carbonation. Seems a touch watery at times. Finishes a bit dry. A very nice amber ale. I do enjoy the amber ales that showcase the hop flavor."
"12 oz. Light brown/amber pour. Light white head. Surprisingly malty aroma, caramel, biscuit and citrus pine. Taste nicely balances caramel malt, light biscuit and pine citrus hops. Finishes with a clean hop presence. Good light/medium body with good drinkability. Hands down the best amber I've had since Bell's Amber which is the standard in my opinion. Ballast point is becoming an under rated overall high/low gravity brewery."
"HV"
"M/D: Medium bodied, slight prick on the tongue from the carbonation but not too much. Drinkability is really nice. Overall a solid beer. Can't say that it quite conforms to the style, but a very good beer indeed."
"nice maltyness and hop balance....very sessionable at 5% ABV"
"D - I could hammer these all night. Such balance and flavor. Great beer and am glad I have tried it."
"Well the smell was great but this lacked flavor to me so it was a disappointment."
"Pours out a deep, clear red - ruby, with a thin white head. The head was gone as soon as I'd gotten done smelling it. About average I'd say, good color and clarity, poor head. The smell is light on the hops, moderate on the malts. A tiny whiff of tropical fruits and oranges comes up, followed by a powdery sweetness. No real whiff of breadiness. The taste, for the average american amber ale, is right on the money. A nice pleasant fruity hop presence comes by, tart cherries, orange, just a bit of leafiness, like tea in the background. Then there's a sweet tea finish, with a tiny bit of a biscuity malt presence. Something feels kind of syrupy in this. Maybe the low carbonation did it, but the mouthfeel is very nice, more full than I expected. And this one is overall very nice. Not the most enjoyable of all, but a bit better than average. I probably wouldn't enthusiastically buy this, but I'd say it was worth the visit."
"I can drink a lot of these."
"Smooth and slightly bitter in taste. A bit of toasty breadiness on the tongue. Crisp and clean on the finish as the sweetness doesn't overwhelm. A nicely balanced amber with good flavor and drinkability, particularly for someone who doesn't prefer simple sweet versions of the style."
"This beer pours a beautiful amber/copper with about a half inch of white rocky head. Head recedes pretty quickly leaving thin wispy lacing. Nose is outstanding! The caramel malts are well done in the aroma, with a touch of bready malts that are faint. If only the taste picked up where the nose left off. Perhaps I got a bad batch, but the taste was muted, the bready malts dominated and weren't well balanced between the caramel and hops that are present. It seemed unequal and offbalance. This is a light to medium bodied beer, medium carbonation, slight grainy texture in the mouth with a sticky finish. The offbalance in the taste lessens the drinkability on this beer, but I will look to try it once more in hopes of simply getting a bad batch this time around."
"D: Great drinkability. A balanced amber ale might be my favorite style for a session beer."
"D - This beer starts out as a solid beer...great smell and taste...but for me the ending flavor and watery mouthfeel didn't settle well...a decent beer for a hopped up amber/red ale"
"I'm sticking to my story with Ballast Point. These guys know how to brew some seriously citrusy beer. Calico's a really nice Amber Ale that I like quite a bit. I'd prefer just a little more hop bitterness, but when isn't that true? All in all, this is a really nice take on the style that's way too drinkable. I wish we saw this here in Ohio. Good stuff."
"D- With no bottling date I have no idea where the hops should be but I trust the source, so im guessing hops were not the focus in this. Either way this was an enjoyable amber with a mild hop sense going for it. Very sessionable though, I would pick up a case for a party."
"D: a hop driven Amber Ale that has great balance and drinkability. This is a good beer!"
"D - A malty amber that is easily drinkable but doesn't stand out from the many others in its class."
"Is this a study in the ""West Coast amber ale"" style? This brew definitely leaned more toward the hops than I expected. At first I wanted the malt body to assert itself more, but the more I drank it, the less bothered I became. This is a pretty solid offering. Not sure if I will buy for myself again, but I know a few friends who may fancy this a good stepping-stone beer."
"Incredibly unique beer to me - highly unexpected. I have to wonder if this is a example of a ""Californiaized"" beer of a style."
"Pours a clear amber with nice head and lacing. Nose has a strong malt character with honey, cinnamon, and floral hops. Taste has a caramel approach with a nice hop finish. A bit wet but quite drinkable. Ambers don't excite me but this is a fine example of the style."
"Ambers are usually one of the weaker offerings from a lot of craft brewers. This one is by no means a weak offering and recommend giving it a try."
"Had 2 beers from this brewery before and enjoyed them immensely.. this one is also very good. I'm a sucker for a nice red ale and this one is different, but refreshing. Pours a reddish/brown color, tons of lacing and a nice head=glorious. Taste is more malty than expected, very malty actually. The bitterness of the hops kick in at the end but its not as hoppy as most other red ales out there. Don't get me wrong, I lvoe me some hops but this beer mixes it up and good and makes for a nice well balanced brew. Greta mouthfeel and body make this an easy drinker. Too bad I have only found it in Massachusetts (boo Connecticut)"
"D - Good, but should contain more Amber like characteristics and I was displeased with the dryness in the mouthfeel."
"The body is light to moderate with some wispy notes. Would like a bit more depth. Very light and easy to drink. Overall I would have like some more depth on the malt side and balance with the great hop flavor."
"D: A good session beer. Not overly complex, but does the trick."
"The drink is fullish in body with good carbonation and a thickish, almost syrupy linger on the palate. Drinkability is okay, but all in all, the brew is nothing to write home over."
"Good drinkable brew."
"Very nice pour, a clear copper with amber hues. Creamy head with excellent retention and lacing, steady carbonation. Smell is pretty average. Sugary sweet, a little toasty brown sugar, somewhat chalky hop character. Taste is a bit bitter. A little more balance. Good brown sugar, toffee, light caramel and a nutty character underneath. Somewhat piney and again a lightly chalky hop presence. Light toasted bread. Well carbonated and pretty creamy with moderate bitterness. Pretty drinkable, maybe a couple bottles. Past that, not too interesting."
"A solid amber with aggressive west coast hops."
"Pours a transparent copper with some red highlights. A three finger khaki colored head caps this beautiful brew, big lace is a bonus. The nose leads me to believe this is going to be a very balanced offering from Ballast Point. Sweet caramel malt blended evenly with floral hop aromas,very enticing for a Amber Ale. Good amount of hops greets the tongue fading into bread crust and back to a bitter hoppy finish. The subtlety of the caramel malt adds complexity while not competing to hard for the top spot,that award goes to the citrusy hops. This is so creamy and drinkable, my taste buds are telling me to sip slower and make this last, while my hand I can barely remove from my glass, this is an outstanding Amber Ale."
"Pours a nice clear brown colored body, fizzy. Big creamy off-white heap, good lacing, lasting. Some alcohol in the nose, some flowery maltiness. Dusty and musty too. Carbonated palate. Malty nutty taste. Dusty too. Some hoppiness, grapefruit. Some sweet spiciness. A little tastier as it warms more."
"Overall very solid here with a mellow profile and an easy session drinker. I would have no issue with having this one again, nice to see it relatively cheap on shelves."
"Drinkability: Mighty bitter for an amber but in the final analysis it is still an amber"
"The aroma is piny with citrus and caramel. The appearance is amber with a large tan head. The flavor is astringent and malty with plenty of hops. The palate is thin. Overall it's average. I was actually having high hopes for this one that turned out to be just drinkable."
"D: A pretty good beer from Ballast Point, just needs more balance."
"6/4/7/4/13 (3.4/5)"
"Overall impression: This is a very nice malty amber, and you may find the six pack disappearing much faster than expected."
"D - Great session beer that is relatively light in alcohol @ 5%. Nice interpretation of the amber beer style."
"Picked this up due to the cheap price and my love of amber ales. On the open and pour, dark, typical amber ale. Sexy. Medium-thin head. Leaves a medium lacing that fits the beer. Smells super bready, yeasty, like biscuits. Taste is SUPER spicey, first thing you notice is the spice. Lots of piney hops here. There's a spice in here that I can't quite put my finger on, but it gives the beer a dill pickle type taste to it. Almost seems like it's coming from the hops, but something tells me it doesn't. Maybe this is an old batch? Either way, it sounds gross, but it's good, and it works with the piney hops extremely well. Really satisfying, incredibly drinkable. Super enjoyable beer, my love amber ale continues and I'm sure to pick up some more Ballast brews. What is it about San Diego that produces such good breweries?"
"Thanks go out to getkrunkhoe for the chance to try this one."
"Possibly one of the best ambers out there. Pure copper pour with heavy caramel and malt aromas. The toffee is prevalent in the taste, but comes with a nice blend of malt, caramel, and vanilla flavors. Liek the Yellowtail, there is a nuttiness that shows through on occasion. Hoppy/citrus quality which seems to borrow from an XPA or a California pale. Not as bitter as the traditional ESB, but very, very nice."
"The taste is malty and fruity, bitter before becoming a bit sweet, with faint flowery hops and a hint of toffee. It then finishes very bitter and dry with a strong hoppy pine-grapefruit aftertaste lingering long past its welcome. The hop bitterness gets more prominent as one drinks more."
"Picked this bottle up while driving through Death Valley in Southern Cali! Out of the bottle this award winner poured out a dark amber/copper color with great clarity. Two finger head of off-white foam, good retention and broken bands of lacing. The aroma was sweet caramel malt and some floral hops. The flavors were good, a blend of sweet malt up front followed by a more biscuity malt in the middle and a grassy/floral hops bite at the end that made it crisp. The body was medium and almost light but not watery, the carbonation right on and the mouthfeel quite smooth. Solid and very sessionable; it deserves to be an American award winner."
"Notes from 5/28/06"
"D_Reminds me of Fat Tire and that isn't neccessarily a good thing but it is better. Warm it up a bit for full enjoyment."
"D: This is a decent, well made beer that goes down easy. Not my favorite, but good."
"D- my first ballast point beer, and its one id like to try again. just picked up this one as a single, but its one that id try again if given the chance. sessionable enough to have a few of without regrets. a good representation of the style."
"D: Nice smooth beer with solid flavor. Very good balance between malt and hops, although hoppier than some of the others I've had in this style. Nothing out of this world, but nothing to complain about either. Very sessionable due to the low ABV makes this a solid every day beer. A good offering from Ballast Point."
"An ok amber ale. So far, Ballast Point's IPA is the easy leader of the pack."
"On Cask at Stone World Brewing Bistro and Gardens. Aroma of roasted and carmel malts, with a balance of hops. Pours opaque and deep amber/red/brown, nice full off-white head. Retention is good. Flavor begins with nice smooth roasted malt and finishes with a nice hoppy (pine/roasted nuts) throat. Very nice lacing. Medium body. Drinkability is medium-high, every sip begs you to take another. Really nice on cask. Throughout there is a nice balance between the malt and the hops, neither is too overpowering. Very well done Amber Ale, should be rated higher!"
"Update December 2008: I very much appreciated the traditional bready malts. This has all the makings of an exceptional ale, although the amber label is misleading. The one element missing is the peaty quality."
"This beer pours a nice amber (duh!) hue with three fingers worth of sticky white head that dissipated quickly, but left a very nice collar of lace for the rest of the beer. The nose on this beer is dominated by caramel, toasted grain, and some floral hops coming in to round everything out. The flavor profile starts out with the sweetness of the caramel malt upfront with a citrus bitterness of grapefruit rind that balances out the sweetness quite well. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth with moderate carbonation with no alcohol present as well. The drinkability is fantastic on this beer, and is one of the better amber ales I've ever had from any brewer."
"Calico has a lot of character that other ambers seem to lack. The bitterness and effervescence of the body make it crisp and clean. Decent alcohol content means you can put back a few of these bad boys....which is exactly what I'm going to do."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this a nice choice to pound down when you want a beer with some substance and a decent hop presence that won't try to knock you over."
"D: I'd drink another... if not for my general dislike of Cascade beers."
"Notes: Nice amber on the malty side of this wide open style."
"On tap at the brewery. Golden amber color with a thick tan head that leaves substantial lacing. Citrus hops dripping with caramel compose the aroma. Flavor is much the same, with candied orange hops and a toasty caramel maltiness. Perhaps not enough bitterness to counter the sweetness. Full flavored and smooth, a little dirty on the palate, but very drinkable."
"Beer poured a deep amber with a nice lasting head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is quite pleasant, perfumed by malty goodness and citric hops. Taste is very balanced, toffee and caramel notes are found up front with a generous amount of northwest hops that leave a resiny residue. Mouthfeel is quite full and smooth for the style, which makes this beer special. Drinkability is near perfect. This is one of the better ambers that i have had and it is well worth the price!"
"as the name suggests, this is a deep copper/amber with just a tinge of haze and an off-white to tan thick, creamy head and lacing. mostly caramel and resin in the nose with some fruit (grapefruit?) underneath. the taste is quite interesting as despite having almost no residual malt sweetness combined with the prevalence of the hop character in this it still manages to come off with the overall impression of malty depth and complexity. lively, prickly carbonation and a light to medium body lead to a crisp, bitter finish. this is a very sessionable brew and i'd love to try it on-tap."
"I'm not a big fan of ambers, but this one is pretty good. The hops add a very nice element to this beer without going overboard."
"This is another very enjoyable hoppy Amber Ale. I've had plenty of the ones that aren't hoppy and I feel that this is the way to go. Plus with the 5% it's sessionable. Recommended."
"D: An excellent American amber ale with nothing too out there, but just a lot of solid goodness in delivering a great-tasting brew."
"D-This is not your typical boring, malty amber. This one has a very good malt/hop balance. I wouldn't expect anything less from Ballast Point. And, at 5% I had no problem putting down 3 of these in a row. Really nice stuff."
"The mouthfeel is strong and satisfying. This is a refreshing beer and a good example of the trendy Amber Ale genre."
"For its type, excellent, and one of the better ambers I have seen."
"Color is a deep orange-red, with a respectable head appearing. Smells of malt and spice, and tastes moderately of spice, malt, and yow! a respectable amount of hops in there, too. Could qualify as decent APA if it wanted to. Not quite as much hop flavor as the Green Flash amber, but one of the best amber ales I've had to date."
"D: Excellent brew, almost like a malty IPA. Solid offering from Ballast Point."
"Very drinkable and well crafted."
"Poured from a bomber bottle into my nonic, nearly all red in color but for a slight brownish hue. Thin head and light carbonation. Nose was up front with candy sugar-like sweetness yet malty. Anise from cherries. Very nice, malty profile with narry a hop to be found. The taste was full bodied. Nice balance of malt and hops. Interesting sweetness at mid-tongue and finishes with a modest hoppiness. A winner. The mouthfeel was very balanced and viscous. Overall you don't have to strain to note it's features. Nice strong nose and taste. A treat."
"D - I am really impressed with this amber ale. One of the hoppiest I've ever had."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this may be one of the two best American Amber/Red Ales I've had,right there with St. Rogue and a close second among Red Ale to Brian Boru. Distinct and impressive, this is terrific, one I'll most certainly grab again in quantity."
"The big malt gives this beer a slightly bigger body than average and this means a bigger mouthfeel. This is a decent amber ale, a fine sippin' session beer and it has a fish on the label, c'mon."
"I the end, it is basically a malt job, and just another American amber."
"Pours a clear ruby hued brown with a creme head that falls fairly soon and leaves quite a bit of lacing on the way down. Flavor is nice. Great earthy tones. Sweet caramel hits quick on the very back side. Feel has a bit of a bite on the carbonation and the liquid is good. This is very easy to drink. A nice amber ale."
"This is a really neutral beer--there ain't nothing wrong with it, but it's not complex, unique or unusual. This would fit into any party and not offend anyone except the most macro drinkers of the macro beer world."
"12 oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a deep amber with a thick fine bubbled off white head. Plenty of carbonation. Light hop aroma with some caramel malt. Creamy mouthfeel. Solid malt base without a lot of sweetness. Decent hop bite for an amber. Nice lacing on the glass. Amber Ales tend to be boring to me, but this is a really solid beer that I could drink over an evening."
"12 ouncer w/o freshness info. Pours clear, blood orange darker amber. Fairly long lived puffy medium tan head, leaving respectable, slippery and scattered lacing upon a gentle swirl. Toasty/caramel malt nose, opens things up on this worthy BP selection. Malt carries the load here, plenty of toast, and more caramel. Moderate smooth hoppyness late. Fine sesssioner. More quality brew from the S.D. nation"
"Beer is a beautiful deep copper amber with a medium sized sand colored head. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel and light floral hops. Full of crystal malt flavor, rich and complex with a nice bitter finish. Very well balanced. Great body, nice carbonation--the quintessential amber ale. I could drink a lot of this."
"Certainly ""sessionable"". Very smooth. Nicely balanced keeping amber ale characteristics, but with a good hop blend (especially in the aromatics department)."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep ruby-orange-amber color with a one finger, frothy head that leaves a nice ring of lacing around the top of the glass. The smell is a nice balance of floral hops and caramel malts, probably leaning more towards the malty side of things. A touch of roasted, nutty malt is also present. The taste is very similar to the nose with the toasted, caramel notes coming through the strongest. Nicely balanced; initially sweet from the crystal/caramel malts, transitions to a biscuity, nutty malt taste and it finishes slightly dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, I would describe the carbonation as pillowy. Overall, a drinkable beer. Not as impressive as their IPA was, but a good beer none the less."
"D: Drinkability was very smooth, well rounded. Drinks more like a red but very nice going down and worthy of a try."
"a good beer, not great, worth checking out, it is very drinkable."
"Overall an easy drinking brew. Surprisingly hoppy for an amber. Pretty good, but the dryness is overpowering in the long run."
"Good carbonation, and a very smooth drinking ale."
"Drinks pretty easy, straight forward enough not to overpower. A very good amber"
"Pours a very pretty copper color, with excellent clarity and a decent head. The nose is very green with hops and contains a faintly offputting vegetal smell -- hopefully not a consistent character of this beer. On the palate, big, citrusy hops that contain a surprising amount of earthy flavors for an American amber, even though they finish with a metallic flourish. Imbalanced for sure, but it still has some enticing biscuity malt flavors. The overall impression, though, is of briskness and zip. Helping that last fact is the carbonation, which has a brusque, steely nature. Overall, this is a good beer and a solid, drinkable rendition of an American amber."
"This would make a fantastic session brew, as it goes down easy, and has the relatively low ABV. My only complaint is that the price is a bit high for what you get."
"Not as good as their IPA, but this one went down crisp, clean, and smooth without any overbearing or cloying factors..."
"Overall- A delicious Amber! Ballast Point finally made it to my region. Hopefully I can retry Yellow Tail, a beer I trashed years ago when I just started beer advocation."
"A very nice drinker for those of us who do not need turbo beers all the time."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a touch creamy. Finish is a lasting hop bitterness with a hint of astringency that lasts a long time. A good beer, to be sure, but not what I was expecting from an amber ale."
"I like this one. Give it a try."
"golden brown with a head that starts out well but disappears to just some bubbling after about 1/4 the way down.smell of hops seem to slightly overpower the malt characterictics.carbonation is a bit much and has a kind of green beer taste between the other flavors.this beer reminds me of a few good amber homebrews i've had.it's a pretty ok brew.but if i'm in the mood for this i'll make it on my own."
"Overall easy to drink, a hop lovers amber, I will be having this again."
"Not the best from Ballast Point but not too bad either, would make a decent session beer at a low cost, average among the other red ales I have tasted, this stuff is also available in six packs and bombers which is a plus, recommended"
"Damn fine beer and I can't wait to try thier IPA which is chillin in my fridge."
"D: A decent middle of the road amber. Nothing to spectacular but good."
"12 oz. glass glass bottle- color of deep amber, with a decent off white colored head - nose of mild hops, melon, malt, and some resin  taste of dirty hops, , and - body is medium, ang slightly oily, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of resin, dirty hops, and is short"
"When poured, the color was of a hazy amber, with some foam that dissapated with in a few seconds and some lace. The smell of spices filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. But, the taste was a disapointment. I felt it was to bitter and not enough flavor. I tasted hops, though mild, but not much of anything else. Some spice, but not really anything to write home about. Not what I expected. Not a first or second class ale. Can't see what everyone else see's in this Amber Ale!"
"Nice amber color with a smell of malts. Tastes malty, cereal, delicious and not what I was expecting. The mouthfeel was very creamy and my favorite part about the beer. For some reason I was expecting this beer to be hoppier. I would probably buy sixers of this if it were available."
"A solid brew! Starts out a deep reddish-copper color and is topped with a moderate tan head. The beer laces nicely when being consumed. A sweet taffy nose is balanced by malt. I swear an Oreo cookie was dropped into the mix as a faint but definite aroma and taste of chocolate is present. A nicely balanced amber ale with a temperate bitterness making it a good drinker."
"Copper in color with a nice inch-thick head. It has a very malty aroma, kind of doughy and syrupy. There's a good amount of hop flavor in this beer, from the smell I was guessing I'd get a malt bomb. Piney flavors are dominant with a little bit of caramel and dough for balance. It has a very viscous feel to it, feeling a lot heavier than it tastes. This amber ale leans towards the hoppy side and makes a good alternative to an IPA."
"I'm not sure if I just got a bad one, but that burnt taste is really distracting and unappealing. Too bad, because it seemed promising from the look and aroma. With the taste, I'm not even sure if I can finish this."
"It does indeed pour a gorgeous copper color with amber highlights. Smells and taste is nicely malty, with some hops (this is certainly no IPA) and fruit flavors mixed in. A good brew, but certainly not a ""big beer"" by any means. Carbonation was fairly low, and I'm wondering if it might have gone a bit flat ... but judging from the the other reviews I'm guessing a thin mouthfeel and little to no head is fairly standard."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy tan head, leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, nice touch of caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, bitter, and some caramel. The finish is bitter/dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice amber from Ballast Point."
"Pours dark amber with a big rocky off white head. Decent lacing, but rather streaky. The smell is a little odd. It's bready and grassy and with notes of cilantro and celery. The taste is somewhat similar. There is that malty breadiness, but also celery seed and herbal flavors and a light bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Pretty drinkable, but I don't like this near as much as their ipa and dipa."
"Tasted on tap at Ballast Point's Homebrew Mart. With a resiny, tree natural scent coming off of a clean white head of decent size, this beer's aromatic qualities set the stage for an enjoyable tasting. It's color is a deep red like dark cherries maybe. It settled nicely in the glass and when tasted the hop flavor and a certain crispness seemed to dominate. Easy to drink and not heavy, I wouldn't say that it's mouthfeel seemed weak or thin, but that there was something missing in the final swallow that may be just my imagination. This beer was satisfying and tasted like it was cared for."
"Regal looking deep copper/scarlet red tone. Nice clarity. Thick and frothy light beige head. The lacing is bountiful. Aroma has lots of lush caramel malt tones in it. And also some oily PACNW hop aromatics are noticeable...in a subdued kind of way. On the palate, rich caramel/crystal malts lay down a nice foundation. Hops add some nice spiciness and piney attributes. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. This is quite a nice amber."
"D- This beer is highly refreshing and drinkable."
"D: Quite good - a memorable amber. A nice beer that I'd look for again. Recommended."
"D - Tasty and smooth. Almost perfect!"
"slightly more hops in the taste with some flavor and bitterness. again though, malt is the focus. pretty one dimensional too which is what im really not a fan of here. just that sweet dextrinous (is that right?) unfermented stuff. not like it has much depth about it, not bready or toasty or yeasty or anything. just a basic amber ale which is a bit boring im afraid."
"Drinkability: A very solid beer in the American Amber category; in my opinion, it beats Fat Tire and Stone's Levitation Ale. Speaking of Stone, this reminds me of a toned-down 10th Anniversary IPA after it has been aged over half a year. Given that the 10th Anniversary is on its way out in annals of beer history, I'm content to know that a fairly similiar (though weaker) beer is out there. I imagine this could make a very nice session beer."
"Drinkability is quite good. It's not a great beer, but it is solid, and very session worthy. Worth a try."
"Lots of care went into this beer, and it comes out a beauty."
"Overall, very well brewed with obvious attention."
"D: Very drinkable and solid amber. Complex, but yet, well balanced."
"Overall: I think this beer is rather boring. It is not by any means bad, just boring. I bought the bottle to use for beer chili and beer cheese dip. I still had half a bottle left, and decided to review it."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into pint glass. Started with a nice head that faded pretty quickly. The color of the beer is light brown with an orange tinge. The smell is floral with a hint of malt. The taste is malty with the hops complimenting nicely and adding a sensation of additional sweetness before fading into a lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is solid. The drinkability is o.k. I think the hop aftertaste clings to my tongue a little too long which makes the beer a little bit of a struggle to drink to much of."
"If in the San Diego area, I'd definitely recommend it as a quality amber example for the local area."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied or so, nothing overly heavy. Coats the mouthwell but the flavor doesn't seem to linger for too long. Superb drinkability with its balanced flavor and overall good taste. Mouthfeel isn't too heavy. Just a good beer."
"D: Pretty standard. I'll need to try this beer again, I fear my bottle was old."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with only a tad bit of dryness upon swallowing. Just enough to make you want to take another sip. The low abv make this very sessionable. I have had four of their offerings and I have been well pleased each time. Hopefully they can increase production and distribution so we can get it out here on the East Coast soon. Quickly becoming one of my favorite West Coast breweries. Now to trade for some more..."
"Mouthfeel is good, well carbonated, not too thick or thin. Drinkability is high, I could put away a couple 22oz. bottles of this on any given night."
"D- i've never had an amber with such a silky smooth mouthfeel, points there. I really enjoyed this, and i'll definately be back for more. I noticed that amber/red ale is such a popular style, and it is hard to set a brew apart from another without brewing another style completely. I think the mouthfeel for brew accomplishes that feat."
"Deep reddish/amber color, clear, with a slim, sustaining head of off white froth. The aroma is soft and sweet, dominated by grassy, citrus hops, much like an IPA. Strong on taste, with a nice balance of hops and nutty toasted malt. The bitterness is quite strong and lingers well, an unexpected suprise. Medium thickness with pretty strong carbonation. I enjoyed the flavor and the delectable bitterness, very nice for the style..."
"Overall this is a highly drinkable amber beer that I really enjoy. Maybe one of my new favorite amber beers. Worth the money if you happen to see it, pick it up."
"This is a fabulous example of an Amber ale, hoppy and flavorful, like a hoppy Pale Ale even. I definitely recommend this to those sick of bland craft brewed Amber ales. A 22oz of this beer is the perfect amount as well; it allows for a mini-quaffing session, which is what this beer is made for."
"Very drinkable...one of my favorites of his style"
"Notes: Wow, what an exceptional offering from a brewery I regularly blew past in the beer stores. Six packs of this stuff would be my prefered purchase size, Bombers of smallish beers are not usually on my list."
"Hopefully, this will be the next brew that BP decides to sell in 6 packs, which will make it even more convenient for sessions."
"Thanks to Kingslender and the left coast BA's for so graciously giving me the gift of this bottle upon our BA meet-up at Monk's in Philly."
"Feel is fairly broad and boldly set within a medium heft. Lively but soothing carbonation and definately dry all over the place. It has a good amount of that, no doubt. A bit one dimensional with the dry tones, therefore a tad tiresome after a while of drinking. Still one keeper of an Amber. Solid and dry."
"Ballast Point Calico Amber Ale is one of the better amber ales to have crossed my palate in quite a while. It stresses the hoppy side of its personality without losing sight of its roots. This is a tremendously drinkable beer about which I have only good things to say."
"This is an outstanding brew from one of San Diego's smaller breweries. It poured a very nice dark amber/brownish color and had a nice slightly off white head that was very dense and laced my glass nicely. I could smell this beer from across the room once I poured it into my glass. The great scent of sweet malt and a touch of earthiness was very nice. The taste was excelent as well. Aided nicely by a near perfect mouthfeel, the taste was quite malty but never cloying and had a great carmel flavor in the middle followed by a nice balanced hoppy finnish. Another quality brew from Ballast Point."
"Amber ales aren't my favorite style of beer. In fact, they're not even close. However, Ballast Point has a quality attempt at the style here. Easily drinkable, smooth and enjoyable, Calico Amber Ale is another solid brew from Ballast Point and worth seeking out."
"Pours a beautiful deep amber/copper with a 1 inch thick medium tan head. Great balance of malt and hops in the nose. Very lovely nose. Rich malty sweetness dominates the palate throughout. Hops definately take a back seat, only making a tiny appearance in the finish. Good mouthfeel, flavorful and coating, with a mildly dry finish. A very nice beer. I have not found a bad one from this brewery. Look for this one."
"This beer poured a nice deep amber, head was really thick and lasted all the way down. Lacing was not what I expected though, a little sparse. Fresh hoppy aroma was inviting. Taste profile consisted of a solid caramel malt base with citrusy hops. Many ambers are real chocolatey, I sometimes don't like it. This amber is more refreshing than most. Nice and drinkable. a solid beer and thanks to Rkhaze for the bottle."
"Medium bodied with a semi-creamy mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing. Good choice for a session Amber."
"Drinkability is OK. Seems over hopped for the beer style."
"This brew is a very good AAA (American Amber Ale). It is a dark red colour with a fluffy white head of foam. The aromas are heavy and malty. They consist of several different malts, cascade hops, and sugar. The taste is sweet, malty, and slightly hoppy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and not too thick and the drinkability is excellent. A great session amber beer!"
"Hats off to Mr. BeachBum for providing!"
"Comments  Many thanks to mickeymac for sending me this Ballast Point offering. It was fabulous."
"This one comes from a bomber with the trademark Ballast Point gamefish on the label. It pours a very eye-pleasing copper with an off-white head that diminishes rather quickly but leaves some lace. The smell is interesting and hard to pinpoint exactly. It has slight peat notes reminiscent of a Scotch Ale but a good amount of hops. The taste, although again hard to categorize, is exceptionally nice. Flavors of biscuit, malt sweetness, and hops blend together almost perfectly. Another winner from Ballast Point."
"Medium amber color. Large head. Aroma is malty with a very definite earthy/yeasty tone to it. A medium bodied ESB. Malts are mild and very rich, Slightly sweet with caramel and toffee tones. Hops are citrusy and not very bitter for an ESB. It extremely well balanced. The malt/hop balance seems to change with every sip. Very smooth, nearly creamy taste. Full and rich. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth and a touch dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"Overall: A Very American E.S.B."
"Deep copper or maybe better yet deep garnet the color as it sets in my glass, the head munificent, the lace a fine satin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is lightly floral but mostly malt sealed with sweet hints of butterscotch, quite pleasant. Begins malt sweet with the top middling in its feel, finish is stingingly acidic which tries to defend the palate against the onslaught of the hop monster that lies in ambush at the very dry end. WOW! Do I like this bad boy? Yes! Quite complex and a very quaffable beer, just wish they were easier to get in Arizona."
"Pours a clear, very dark amber / copper colored body capped by a short, creamy, ivory head that holds well and leaves some nice lace. A pronounced aroma of caramel and biscuit malt greets the nose, followed shortly by some soft piney hops. Quite welcoming! Upon tasting, an exceptionally nice creaminess fills the mouth due to the combination of a medium body and moderate carbonation that's made up of very fine bubbles. The flavor displays an excellent balance between full, sweet, toasty/biscuity caramel malt upfront, grassy/spicy/lightly citrusy hops towards the swallow, and a bitterness that doesn't interefere with the maltiness but dries out the finish. A pleasure that offers a great deal of malt character, some complexity, and a very good drinkability. This is the first beer that I've tried from Ballast Point but it will certainly not be the last! Well worth trying and the ship directly to quite a few states!"
"This deep amber colored ale is quite a hoppy offering.  There is a substantial amount of bittering and spice hops to balance out a bit of roasted malt.  Not my favorite amber, but this would be great for those who enjoy a bit more umph with their amber."
"Notes: A blend of six American, Belgian, and English malts with the additions of Cascade and Progress hops lend to the complexity. Big malty American ale, well balanced and well structured. A brew I could get real fond of when looking for a malty session brew."
