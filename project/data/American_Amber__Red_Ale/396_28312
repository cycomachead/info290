Flavor was good for the style with slightly more forward grassy hops than you might expect and a nice caramelly malty backbone.  Perhaps a hair thin on the palate.

Pours fairly crystal clear dark red color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of citrus hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Light amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange/lemon zest, pineapple, citrus rind, caramel, toast, toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of bright citrus/floral hops with moderate caramel/toast malt sweetness; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. All around great balance and complexity of citrus/floral hop and dark/toasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

I'm honestly not in love with it, it comes across a bit confused to say the least, bitter and sweet, but not in a good way really. it gets hard to drink, sticky and filling, especially with temperature, and just doesn't wow me the way it has for others. full body may be to its detriment here, just too much so deal with, but the carbonation tries as hard as it can to make this move, but its stuck. alesmith can really do no wrong for me, but i like this less than most of their other stuff, i expected more from a special release.","StonedTrippin","Feb 03, 2014"

Also picking up nectarines and marzipan. Taste is immediately sweet caramel and woody/fruity hops, followed by a bitterness like orange pith. medium thick mouthfeel with a soft carbonic bite.

4.13,4.3,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the interesting blend through the aroma, and the gorgeous mouthfeel. The initial nose gives big fruitiness to match the equally as big shoes of the grain bill and the deep, spicy hoppiness. Between the chocolate and the strawberries it actually did feel oddly appropriate for the holiday. The flavoring came nicely, but much of the hoppiness was lost between the massive overhaul of caramel, chocolate, roast, and toast through the grain. This also made room for the sweetness to peak just a bit too much by the end of the sip. More than making up for it was the feel, which gave silky, creamy softness to each hit from the glass. This is a tasty, well executed beer, and it seems to not only fit the style, but fit well within the ranks and idiosyncrasies of the brewery.","TheBrewo","Mar 22, 2013"

3.93,-0.8,4.5,4,3.75,4,4,"Anyway, The beer poured out as a deep red color. The head was a light shade of tan with a very good retention and lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's also hoppy and there is even some chocolate coming through on this one. The taste of the beer was pretty good, it's got some transitions from sweet to bitter then back to sweet. The malt followed by the hops and finally the chocolate comes in to settle things down a bit. The flavors to me sometimes get a little on the awkward side so at times I really liked it and other times I didn't. The mouthfeel was pretty good. Well carbonated and had a medium body. Overall I thought the beer was good. Sometimes though I think the flavors in it clash a bit and that hindered my thoughts on the beer. I enjoyed it but I feel there are better alternatives out there, it's still worth trying to see for yourself though.","Knapp85","Beers"

Initial flavor is extremely well blended and satisfying. Finishes with toasted malt, pine and citrus hops, residual berry juice. Great medium body with nice creaminess. The flavor seems very low key at first, but is quite complex despite its subtlety. I could not stop taking sips from this.

A twist of vanilla, chocolate and citrus in the mouthfeel, very subdued compared to the other aspects of the beer. This beer puts a lot of different aspects together to make a far better than average amber ale, you get plenty of cascade hops I suspect, lots of caramelization, just the right amount of alcohol.

Underneath the hops, some caramel and toastier malt flavors come through. The taste has good hop flavor, nice delicacy/complexity. The malt plays a larger role than in the aroma. Good depth from the darker malt. It almost has a light chocolate flavor. In both the aroma and taste, the beer just lacks somewhat in intensity for the abv. For a ~6.5% abv beer, I just want a bit more. Mouthfeel also doesn't really help, as it gets a bit watery in the middle. Still, it's a good beer.

With pine and moderately juicy citrus hop flavors complementing the herbal and minty bitterness, the opening flavors are quite enjoyable. The mid palate brings a bit of toast and toffee. Sweetness, however, is minimal here. Drying, toasty and hoppy on the finish, there's a blend of pine and citrus pith present. Medium light in body, the carbonation here is rather excellent - creamy but firming, lending a soft and smooth palate to carry the flavors. The water profile is a little distracting, at least initially, but the carbonation makes up for it. Very good, highly recommended.","DefenCorps","Jan 25, 2013"

4.39,10.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Had this on tap at Hamilton's maybe a month ago. Darkly colored with no head. Big resiny hopes in the aroma that fade into sweet malt and dark fruits. Taste starts with resiny hops and fades into citrus and dark fruits. Mouthfeel was damn near perfect, being right in the middle. I could drink a lot of this in one night. Can't wait to have it again.","throwitallaway","Feb 20, 2008"
4.58,15.7,5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"D- Oh man, I love this beer. The growler is half gone and I just cracked it open. I love Alesmith's stuff, but I really look forward to their special releases...I wish they would bottle this stuff.","m1ked","Feb 13, 2008"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"The body is between mid and full. A lighter carbonation but this enhances the malty and fuller body of the beer. Overall a good beer, no matter when you try it.","Oxymoron","Feb 12, 2008"
4,1,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste is primarily malt. There's some vanilla, maybe some darker fruits, and definitely some pine (not much grapefruit) hop content. A good beer, but certainly not a great one.","Overlord","Feb 10, 2008"
4.23,6.8,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: A very good red ale, probably one of the best I've ever had, defintiely worth a try if on-tap.","Halcyondays","Feb 03, 2008"
4.12,4,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability is moderate, this is a well-balanced amber with plenty of flavor, definitely a lighter cousin of Evil Dead Red and Decadence, this is more reminiscent of PP Sharkbite in terms of a lower hop presence, definitely worth trying in honor of V-day!","Stoneman78","May 04, 2007"
4.15,4.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"An enjoyable red ale with some more unique characteristics. I'll try to get at least another growler of this while it's still available...","mithrascruor","Mar 15, 2007"
4.45,12.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Highly recommended. A great, perfectly balanced red.","rallison","Mar 10, 2007"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Exceptionally smooth amber ale. Nice hoppiness but great malt backbone. I didn't get to take great notes on it, but man I sure did like it. It was incredibly easy to drink due to it's awesome balance. Enough hops to give a hop fix, but the balance was maintained very well. Quite a treat. I was happy to find it.","jasonjlewis","Mar 02, 2007"
4.13,4.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured from the growler, direct from the tap at the Brewery in San Diego, about one hour after purchase. The red color is amazing - clear, with small bubbles of carbonation. Lacing apparent all the way down the glass, but the head disappates quickly. It tastes similar to their ESB, but has something more - a smoky/burnt caramel taste that's really intriguing. Alesmith keeps on putting out winners and I keep drinking them up!!!","cerveza5150","Feb 17, 2007"
4.26,7.6,5,4,4.5,4,4,"D- amazing complex flavor and jaw dropping beautiful color. only gripe is that sometimes you feel as though your drink a soft drink (though this brew is not that carbonated, its still really sweet). to sweet to session but this would pair well with some cheesecake, mmmh mmh","tonistruth","Feb 12, 2007"
2.95,-25.5,4,4,2,2.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Because the bar stated that this was a 10%abv brew, I must say that it is very drinkable. Not that I'd have another any time soon, but because it's so unnoticable. It feels like a standard red ale. It's so hard for me to believe that it's 10% that I think the bar may have been wrong.","dbalsock","Beers"
3.8,-4,4,4,3.5,4,4,"I had this at the release party at the brewery. This is supposed to be the same beer as the Evil Dead Red but it tasted different to me. There was less of a fruit taste and more bready yeast. The colour was the same deep red/brown with a nice cask poured head. Smell was slightly of fruit, some bread, almost oaty. Taste was more of the same, except subdued. The smell was much stronger than the taste. Mouthfeel was good, it really coats the tongue. I could have a few of these. This is a nice well made beer, but i think the last batch brewed as the Evil Dead Red was better.","sleazo","0"
3.51,-11.4,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D: I found this beer to be somewhat standard (for an Alesmith beer). Least favorite Alesmith to date. Mind you there is nothing wrong with this beer, I finished ever last drop happily.","Westsidethreat","Feb 13, 2006"
4.38,10.6,3,5,5,2,4,"Had this on the debut party at the brewery. Very rich malty aroma and seemed to pour red. But it was hard to tell as it was in a red plastic cup The aroma and first sip were similar with big malts and flavors, but on the end it just dropped off with no aftertase or not much remaining on the palate. Good beer just fell a little short at the end","chargerfanjess","Feb 12, 2006"
4.33,9.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"update: it seems this beer is 6.3% alcohol. Lower than expected, but not too shabby.","kleffman","Beers"
4.28,8.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"I think this beer would make a good session beer. I dont know the alcohol content, but I think it is up there. This beer is not overly aggressive. I think I could drink this one all night long. If AleSmith ever bottles this, I will have to get a few cases. One of the best I have had from them.","OStrungT","0"
