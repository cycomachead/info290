"Very full taste for a pale ale"
"Tastes good, but a little uneven.  Pine up front, grapefruit in the middle, pine and a bit of yeast at the back end.  One of the most aggressively hoppy reds I've ever come across, and while it was enjoyable the lack of balance holds it back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice amber red with a white head that trails the glass. The smell was full of pine but with some toasted scents coming through as well. The taste was expertly balanced with piney hops coming through and then a bit of the sweet malt. The finish was very clean with a citrus finish that left you wanting another sip. Loved this one."

"Not usually an amber fan, but I do like this one."

"Looks great. Deep brown with a massive cream colored head that went on for days and laced in text book fashion. Nose carried a nice amount of hops and an earthiness, which I mention in the taste on the backend. Finishes crisp and virtually no sweetness hanging around on the tongue despite just a bit in this well balanced taste. Really a great beer that I would not have thought twice about had I not been drawn to check out everything they have because of the Lunch and Dinner craze."
""
""
"This beer was charming, clean and classy.   Sometimes you just pull the right beer at the right time, you know?"
""
"O - I'd love to get this fresh, but even with a couple months on it, this is a very good beer.  Enjoyably hop-forward, with pine as its central note."
""

""

""
""
"O:  overall this is a very enjoyable beer with great flavors and complexity.  Well crafted and very hoppy.  Definitely a solid representation of the style."
"Overall: it was pretty tasty, if it were easier to get and maybe a little cheaper than $7 a bottle I'd get it again."

"Poured from bottle. Look- very dark amber, almost black. Huge tan head sticks around for awhile. Head spreads throughout, lacing looks nice. Smell- grassy.. Some floral notes. Actually this beer reminds me of a better Lagunitas Nighttime. Taste- good stuff. Blended. Malt, hops, earthiness, smoothness. Feel- surprisingly smooth, not much booze felt. O- an interesting, well thought Amber ale."
""
"A interesting take on an amber ale, but slightly over-hopped to my tongue which steal  from the experience."

"Overall - For me, the appearance and the smell were the best things about this beer."

"Poured 16.9 oz bottle (102114 date) into a Samuel Smith's pint glass.  Hazy deep Amber color with nice head, good retention and nice medium lacing all the way down. Aroma is a delicious understated piney hop.  The flavor picks up some of the darker caramel malts and is almost a touch toasted copper.  The  alcohol is mostly well-hidden but breaks through at the back of the palate.  Amber ales are not my thing but this is very nice.  My first MBC beer.  I will certainly seek out others."

"Love this beer. One of the bet Amber beers."
""
""
"Though I tend to like more flavorful brews, Zoe has become a favorite in my house due to its smoothness.  Like with most bottles from Maine Beer Company, it is best to drink them within a couple of months."
"There was not a great taste to this bear...lacking for Maine Beer Co."
""
"Overall though not bad or off this beer doesn't seem to go very good with age so if you see a bottle 6+ months old avoid it unless hella cheap. Not bad at all."

"Another classy beer from MBC. Rich and malty, frothy head. Those good amber flavors, biscuit,  oat, just a touch of caramel, does copper have a taste? MBC reminds me of Russian River, in that their not experimentalists, they're not releasing bunches of variations with unusual ingredients. They just take a beer style and nail it, giving us their version of a classic recipe. They just make great beers."
""
""
"Can't say enough about these guys. Haven't had a poor beer from them yet. This is one of the top Amber/Reds I've had.....right next to Nugget Nectar."
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty amber ale.  One of the few beers I've had recently that still had a head when the class was almost empty.  Good solid beer, but I've had better from the folks at Maine Beer Company."
""
""
""
""
"I thought the softness of the malt in this was remarkable but that the flavor was lacking in boldness. It could have been more dynamic."

"Pours a dark red/brown color with a thick tan head. Smells of pine, citrus, and a little chocolate. Taste is fairly well balanced between malt and hops. A lot of roasty, chocolaty malts complemented by pine and citrus hops. Some dark fruit in there too. This isn't as much a hoppy amber as it is a Black IPA. Much darker and roastier than other hoppy ambers I've had. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy and carbonation is pretty low. I usually like my hoppy beers to be lighter and crisper. Overall, a pretty good amber. MBC definitely did their own thing with it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe I'm hitting a bit low here, it's just not my favorite MBC beer. Still top quality, a fantastic version of the style... which I don't care for all that much. I'll take any other MBC over it, but I'd take this over most other red ales."

"Overall - ""Balling",  a great very balanced Red Ale, but not as hoppy as the label would lead me to be believe but a great example of what the style can be. However at this price per oz it is hard for me for justify all the time. If this was in a six pack format, then it would be in a regular rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a lovely blend of malty and hoppy and somehow manages to be both things at the same time. Wish I could have another right now!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't know who they're kidding.  This isn't a simple amber ale.  This is either a red IPA or an American Strong Ale due to the high hop content and moderate-to-high alcohol.  It's delicious but mislabeled."

"Overall: Sip it, savor it, and enjoy it. Another great beer from MBC, everyone's favorite simple-label-loving brewery. You really don't need to go nuts on bottle designs when your beer is this well crafted. It strikes me as kind of an IPA/amber hybrid, and will appeal to fans of either."

"Dark amber, with a great lacing of medium tan head. Smell is full of earthy caramel, pungent, citrus and pine, quite light. Taste is delicious, yumyum, lots of citrusy hops, a bit spicy, pine notes, strong hoppy profile is matched with a good malt backbone, really dry on the finish with crisp caramel malts, drying out with some black pepper. A perfectly balanced delicious red hoppy ale. Plenty sessionable with a really delicious hop flavour and spice to it, another great beer from MBC."

"O - Very tasty amber ale... another win for Maine Beer Company. Steep pricetag, however, over $7.... making this a once-in-a-while beer. If you're a fan of MBC, make sure you give this one a shot."
"Maine Beer Company Zoe ---4/5."

"Very foamy pour, fills up nearly half the pint glass, despite fragile, airy quality retains well and hovers over a finger for some time, light tan color, virtually no larger bubbles on the surface, the lacing is weak, a few splotches here and there at best. The liquid is clear and transparent, a very dark reddish brown, looks like the color of library furniture, sedate and serious, almost zero bubbles visible. The nose is expressive with grapefruit, pine leading into malted milk balls, chocolate, coffee and caramelized brown sugar, then veers back to earthy hops and leafy matter, apple and pear skin all you get for fruit, keenly penetrating and erect posture in the nostrils. Full-bodied for the character, has decent enough carbonation yet still sits like a bowling ball on the tongue. Leads with biting white grapefruit zest and green grass notes before the more roasty coffee, mocha steps up. Pine and flowers pull it away from malty sweetness and here thereâ€™s greater depth of apricot, peach and pear fruit. Some breadiness and a hint of summer corn but not strong enough to counteract the overall bitterness. Overall, appears to choose power and simplicity over subtlety, no complaints here."

"O: Another great showing from Maine Beer Company."

"Overall pretty good, but certainly not worth the $7.99 I paid for a 16.9 oz bottle when I can get a sixer of Troegs Hopback for $10."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I like everything about this beer but the taste, which is just OK. It looks good, it smells great, and the feel is nice, but the taste was a bit too earthy and dull for me. Something seems lost in the translation from my nose to my tongue. That being said, this beer has a lot going for it and I would happily try it again to see if the taste could live up to the smell."
"O: surprised by this a bit. Like many of their beers, but I think I prefer this to nearly all of them."

"Another great beer from Maine Beer Company. As usual, this beer is dry rather than sweet, crisp, and has a nice hoppy profile without reliance on big citrus notes. Very balanced with a long bitterness, and enough very dry malt to sustain the piney and herbal hops. A lighter colored amber than many, and the malt is downplayed in favor of the hops. Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I liked it. I would get again on occasion."
""
""
""
"o. outstanding beer. I was a bit leary of this brewery because so many maine beers are watery, but they have hit a home run with the first one I tried. Will be looking for another. Will revisit this one."
""
""
"Overall, just a fantastic beer. It's not the first ""hoppy red"" I've had, but it might be the best. It manages to kick up the standard amber ale flavor profiles without going so far that it turns it basically into an IPA. This one is still firmly in the American Amber category, but with an added level of interest."
"O: probably my favorite amber ale; the extra hoppiness is what does it for me;"

"Overall: Medium bittered amber. Not much stands out here just some citrus hops used for bittering that don't lend a ton to the aroma. It is good but wasn't worth seeking out. If I had it on the shelf at the grocery store, I would probably go to it occasionally though."
""
"O: This is one of those sneaky beers that grows on you after awhile. Well made and eminently drinkable."

"O: I am extremely impressed by this beer. My first hoppy red ale, and hopefully not my last! We are fortunate to have just received some Maine Beer Company beers in SC in the last week, and I'm excited to try more. I had peeper and lunch when I visited their old brewery in Portland and enjoyed them immensely. In a four pack would be great, I could knock quite a few back on a warm SC summer day! If you can find it, seek these guys out, haven't disappointed yet."
"Darker then I expected it to be, Zoe pours dark brown with reddish highlights. Two finger khaki head. Good retention and lacing. Piney hop nose. Mouthwatering. Tastes so much better then it smells and thats saying something. Lighter then expected but not thin at all. I could drink this all night. Another Maine beer that should be sought out."

"O - I will definitely seek this out again. Great first offering I've had from Maine Beer Co"
""
""
"O- This is my first Maine Beer Company beer and it certainly won't be my last. I didn't get a hold of this until 3 months after it's brew date and it's still one of the best ales I've had. I was told that ""Lunch"" IPA is even better, if that's the case I will be amazed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid beer, really just a slightly darker IPA though. I would have liked to taste more of the specialty malts used in this beer. I'd recommend to hop heads for sure though."
"Overall. Surprisingly delicious beer here. The last time I enjoyed something of this type so much was the VCBW cascadian dark from years back. Thanks wordemupg!"
"This is a must try if you're looking for a hoppy American Red that is very well balanced and drinkable. Decent ABV as well."
"Poured a reddish brown body with good head and lace patches. A very hoppy aroma that is floral and somewhat fresh along with touches of both roasted and sweet caramel malts. This beer is more hoppy than sweet but there is not only a large chunk of floral, citric hops with touch of fruit sweetness but also a large portion of roasted, breadlike malts. The malts balance with the hops for a hoppy beer that has minimal sweetness but good malty dryness and finishes dry. A hearty, medium-bodied red that is a sipper and not your average hop bomb with sweet malts but a more robust, dry beer."
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into an American pint glass. I was immediately struck by the relatively dark color, a near-brown reddish bronze with an amazingly thick and rich light tan head. Smells like a dark IPA, tons of spicy grapefruit and orange on top of a nutty, toffee-like malt base. Considerable herbal and pine character as well. Like its IPA counterparts, this Maine offering comes off juicy, fresh, spicy, and extremely hoppy across the board, although here the sweet malts keep up admirably. Near perfect balance, truth be told. I focused on the hops first, an evolution from grapefruit and orange rind to a lychee-like perfume to astringent green banana to strong pine and then mellowing out to well-steeped black tea. Fantastic. The malts deliver a lot of biscuit or semi-sweet cookie flavor, some toffee and hazelnut almost like a well-crafted English brown ale, faint chocolate and tobacco. The mouthfeel is quite bold and prickly, thin to moderate body and moderate to high carbonation with a slick resinous finish of unripe bramblefruit and tomato leaf. The fruit really develops nicely near the end of a bottle, straight up Simcoe raspberry jam and earthy pine. As was the case for Another Round and Mo, its hard to find much wrong here. Maybe the bitterness and pine are a tad much for the style? Regardless, epic brew and not to be missed by hops and sweet malt fans alike. This one captures both dimensions at the same time without either being swamped."
"O- A big, complex, hoppy amber/brown. A really unique beer which is saying something in a style that is typically rather one-dimensional."
""
""
""
""

"Seems like there's no reason to doubt Maine. Just buy 'em and drink 'em. And enjoy!"
""
""

"Decent copper color hue with a pretty large frothy head with solid retention. Smells of hops, citrus, pine, and fruits. Moderate carbonation with some bitterness and stickyness to the mouthfeel. The taste though is where I got lost. Not spectacular and nothing over the top. Just kind of the typical pine and citrus. Seemed to be lacking flavor for me; not sure but maybe my palate was off or the 30 days since bottling has robbed the brew of taste. Overall I really wanted to rave about Zoe but I just guess I'll have to try it again to see if anything changes from my first offering. That being said; still a really nice beer just not my favorite from Maine Beer Co.."
"Overall - For my first Maine Beer Company offering, they deliver a solid American Amber with a nice hop profile and caramel malt sweetness."
""
""
"O: A nice flavored american red with a good dose of malt character and piney hop character. I'd compare this to a few other ambers I've had from Half-Acre (ginger twin?) or even a bigger version of alpha king."
""
""
""
"oh, and a bitchin' label too!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: actually quite good very nice but a little sticky"
""
""
""
""
"O: Incredible. if only more ambers were as well put together as this one. Ambers have always been tough for me because I find they are either too hoppy, not hoppy enough, or too malty. Zoe strikes the balance."
""
""
""
""
"I've had 4 beers from Maine and all have been great, its been a while since I've been this impressed by my first crack at a brewery. Find their beers and drink them, and send me a bottle of Lunch!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very very good. This is one you need to SEE & try. The descriptions won't do it justice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A well-made American amber ale - the hops are certainly not to be trifled with, but that doesn't mean that the malt is given short shrift - in fact, a fair amount of love is doted on the biscuit, bread, and caramel notes, almost, as already stated, through the end. Anyways, a tasty, somewhat beguiling, and drinkable despite the ABV, hoppy amber brew - I want to, but I'm just not gonna add a smiley face to seal this one off."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark caramel amber hue with a large cream colored long lasting creamy head. Very good heâ€™d retention and lacing throughout. Aroma and Taste is of floral pine hops, some citrus notes and good amount of caramel malt sweetness. Palate is medium body, nice crisp and refreshing mouth feel, nicely balanced sweetness and hops, good carbonation. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt, some toffee flavors followed by some good floral pine hops and citrus notes for balance. Has a good caramel malt background and a lingering caramel toffee flavor. Overall an excellent, smooth refreshing and tasty amber ale"

"This is the kind of beer one looks forward to enjoying with friends after work. It is more of a hybrid than true to any one style. If balance can be tuned in better, it would truly be outstanding."

"Overall, a very nice hoppy amber ale. And I loved the story on the bottle."
"2 week old bottle. 2 glasses, poured my initial 12-14 ounces in a pint glass, then the rest with yeast into a smaller glass to examine. pours murky brown. bit of sediment from what I can see through the murk. spectacular hop aroma. lot of bite, clean, subtle bitterness lingers"
""
""
""
"Very solid offering from MBC once again. Beautiful citrus hops dominate the nose, while the taste is a mixture of bitter hops up front and a delicate, chocolate-like lingering on the back. Appearance is dark -- like a mix of brown and mahogany. A prominent creamy head contributes. Not a session beer by any means, like some of MBC's other offerings, but Zoe is an excellent full-bodied example of the amber style. If you find Nugget Nectar overly assertive or fruity, try Zoe instead. I know many who prefer it."
""
""
""
""
"O: great beer. Doesn't taste as dark as it looks. Very drinkable. Not a lot of alcohol notes or esthers. Very clean"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled 12/1/13 that's what Philly sells to the Pittsburgh market. I'll take it though. Dark amber bordering on a mahogany brown hue, light tan head just barley off white. Aromatics hints of dark chocolate, herbal earthy hops, east coast style hops but rock solid so far. Just a hint of tart/citric/grapefruit notes with oxidized hops starting with some biscuit/caramel malts thrown in as well. Complex beer I like MBC with the two beers I've had so far before Zoe, were Peeper Ale and King Titus. Flavor wise there's just a touch of cardboard starting in the malt department, I don't see any infection years just a hint of oxidation from the age. Bitterness from the hops makes it through each sip, earthy citric notes with a semi-sweet dark amber malt base, it drinks really well share a bottle with a friend and it will be gone in no time. These are the type of beers I wish were available locally. Overall I really enjoy this beer, and I appreciate the east coast style hops especially in an amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Hoppy as expected, however, I was expecting more depth of hop flavor/aroma to allow for some malt sweetness to play in."

"A real nice hoppy red. I appreciate the assertive hops while keeping balance."
"Atmosphere is really nice. Great head and some sound lacing. Nose is roasty and nutty. Bitter and roasty with a nice hop. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"This is one of those beers where I am confused and have to ask ""is it just me?"" I love the aroma with its sweet fruity hops like nectarines and watermelon but the flavor comes across as more winey sweet with touches of floral bitterness. This was a very fresh bottle so I'm inclined to think it's just my palate that simply did not accept the hop varieties."
""
""
"In my opinion, this is an expertly crafted beer. My tastes enjoy the balance weighted a little more towards the hops, yet this beer is still immensely enjoyable to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bitter end lingers a bit too long for my taste, but it's a great hop forward amber that I liked more the longer I drank and thought about it."
""
""
""

"Overall: Excellent beer and would definitely drink again. Felt more like a classic IPA with some extra malt character for balance. Another great beer from Maine Beer Company!"

"The palate opens with a blend of modest hop bitterness and plenty of hop flavor. Pine and grapefruit are most dominant, but I also get a good amount of navel oranges and a little mint. The mid palate brings out flavors of toffee, brown sugar, burnt sugar and caramel, but thankfully, this beer isn't particularly sweet. In fact, the way this feels on the palate reminds me again of NN. Bitter on the finish with a mild pine resin character, this beer is medium light in body and has a medium high level of carbonation. The carbonation level is a little higher than I'd like, but the flavors and balance on the finish is excellent.  Excellent stuff, I imagine this would be incredible on cask. Very highly recommended."
"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2013. Pours lightly hazy ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Moderate earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, mango, citrus, caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent hoppy amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Another fantastic beer from MBC."
""
"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate to high carbonation is cut by a good amount of hop oils and resin and malty stickiness. Nice balance keeps this highly drinkable with a good body."
""
""
""
""
"O: Disappointing, apart from the great mouthfeel. It's definitely not a bad beer at all, though - and it grows on me the more I drink it. Still, this kind of money for a 500mL bottle of beer that's only slightly above average kind of hurts. And I really hoped this would be nearly as fantastic as Nugget Nectar, too..."
""
""
""
""
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours hazy-amber with long lasting off-white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade, caramel and bready malt. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy hops dominate the palate while orange fruit, caramel and biscuit malt provide some balance. Finish is long, grapefruity. Amazingly delicious brew."

"O - really liked this one, but at its price point I will not buy it again."

"I was not sure what to expect with this beer, but found it to be pleasantly satisfying with a unique all around experience. Good beer."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber clear body with a light tan head of high thickness, good retention, some lacing. Smells of piney floral hops and spices. Taste is enjoyably bitter with a nice spicy malt backbone. Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp, medium bodied, quite dry. Overall, a well-enjoyed amber ale, a style which is often macro-produced, but well executed in this case with abundant use of hops."
""
""
"o: This started out very easy to drink with some nice malty flavor laced with a decent amount of hops. However as it warmed an astringent aftertaste started to overpower everything, eventually becoming intolerable. Not sure what happened there, but drink it rocky mountain cold I guess. Will have to try some other Maine offerings but I think I'll pass on this in the future"

"Bought a bottle from M & R Liquors in Manchester, CT. Poured into a U.S. pint glass. Bottled 9/10/2013; consumed about 55 days afterward. Really rich malty flavors and an absolutely beautiful body (maybe due to the bottle conditioning). The foam is always a treat on these Maine brews. The aftertaste is a bit harsh toward the end of the bottle, but other than that, this is a solid, amazing red ale!"

"O - I generally like hoppy or malty more than both but this one really brings the two together nicely. Well done!"

"O - A very pleasant experience and not at all what I was expecting. This beer is too easy to drink and very refreshing. The citrus presentation is nicely balanced with a black tea bitterness. I would gladly buy this again... would be awesome on a warm summer day. Loved it."

"Possibly a bit too bitter for an amber and could use some more balance but an overall great beer."

"Doesn't taste as dark as it looks, and has that small-bubble carbonation and unique pine flavor that is in all MBC ales. The hoppiness is what varies the most in Zoe, but when it's right this beer is an amazing combination of flavors that is damn near perfectly made."

"The beer is reddish copper with a lasting tan head. The aroma offers hops, pine, caramel malt. Lightly sweet. Bread, biscuits, and malty body with a stinging bitter finish. Pine lingers in the back. Alcohol presence is fairly noticeable. Overall, I thought this was mediocre and undeserving of the high ratings it receives. The exorbitant expense of the beer (at various locations in the DC metro area) had kept me from purchasing it. It's an amber ale after all. I don't comprehend the price for such a beer. So I finally gave in and tried it. Disappointing."

"This is heavy on the west coat hops, but is pretty well balanced and is a delight to drink."

"A: Nice looking beer, rust to burgundy in color, lots of lacing and sea foam, noticeable sediment â€“ 4.50, S: Tons of biscuity malts, very crisp and citrusy for an amber, the hops really standout â€“ 4.00, T: Lots of caramely malts and sweet doughiness, grapefruit and pith play a significant role with a touch of pine, more hops and bitterness than Iâ€™d normally anticipate for an amber â€“ 4.25, M: Quite creamy â€“ 4.50, D: Quality beer all around, very drinkable and worth scouting out â€“ 4.50"

"As an Amber Ale that trends IPA, the proportions have been rearranged- suppressing malt sweetness and body in order to celebrate true American hop character gives this clever ale an edge for hop lovers."

"Overall: I bought this on being random and feeling to try something different. I never heard of this beer till actually reviewing it. Though not advertised as an IPA, it is! Has every property you could ask for and for you hop heads this one is addicting so don't say i didn't warn you. Salud!"
"Solid Red, better than the majority, but not worth getting in an accident over."

"O - I'm really loving this beer. So crisp and pungent, incredibly drinkable. I'll be picking this up again, but not as often as I'd like considering I paid $6 for a pint bottle..."
"Mouthfeel: Dry mouthfeel. Medium bodied. great balance with the hops and malts with the hops taking over a little in the finish. Overall It's an outstanding brew."

"This beer rules I'll be getting some more for sure"

"One of the best reds I've had. While a bit hoppy, especially in the nose, the taste is just superb and easy to drink. So much more complexity than most other amber ales, with hints of raspberries, grapefruit, and just the right amount of hops (less noticeable in taste than aroma, which is good for me). The breadiness makes it so much more interesting than most in this style. Also, it has a beautiful dark amber color with gorgeous foamy, bubbly head. Recommended."

"Pours amber with a gingerbread hue and a solid quilt of toasted cream foam. Smells of hops from the pour, now I will dive in.... Very northwest: pine, resin, some grapefruit, some tea, Special B malt here on the nose (or the likes), and a bit of stones. Flavor is malt, tea, hops, some really aromatic character I just can't put my finger on, some toasted wheat bread. The flavor here is surprising and quite nice. Fairly full bodied for the style with low carb and a semi dry finish. I am really impressed with this beer. I'm happy with the divisive character of the nose vs flavor on this one. I am met initially with the impression that this will be a robust, in-your-face amber a la Troegs, but am met with a sophisticated, mature flavor profile hard to beat for the style in my opinion. A real treat of the style."

"Zoe is my first encounter with Maine Beer Company. Iâ€™m really impressed. This is an Amber Ale that packs a ton of flavor. While it features a lot of hop flavor, there is a nice balance between malt and hops. This is really good stuff. Youâ€™d be remiss to pass it up."
""
""
""

""

"500ml bottle: This one pours a clear, very dark amber color. There was a bit of a tan head on it, that lingered awhile and left some lacing. Nice nose! Lots of citrus, pine and malts. The taste is very good. Definitely a bit of a bitter hop presence. Pine and citrus, with a good malt backbone. No sweetness beating out these hops. Nice Beer!"

"a nice American amber here. the color is dark brick red, clear enough, but not letting a ton of light in. there is a huge oatmeal looking cream colored head with excellent retention and a certain sex appeal. the nose is dry red malts, and a whole lot of hops, especially for the style. there is basically no sweetness at all, which is the factor that always turns me off from these. this one is real hoppy, like a red ipa, with a lot of grapefruit and pine, really dense and robust, a very impressive ale. I like this side of red malt, its new, its sturdy, and its delicious. I would love to see more beers like this out there, I love its depth and careful yet aggressive hop complex. soft carbonation, full body, this appears to me as a fall beer, but I suppose its a heck of a drink around the calendar. maine beer company has impressed me so far, I am looking forward to the mean old tom ive got in the fridge, and anything else I can get my hands on from these guys."

"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with pine and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is very pine and herbal hop forward."

"This reminds me of an excellent homebrew, in many ways, and what's even better is that it reminds me of my own English IPA homebrew I did a while back! This is superior in many ways, but how a mass produced beer like this one can contain so many of the fresh, tannic aspects of homemade beers of this kind remains a mystery to me. Very flavorful, and never too heavy. This is an ode to bottle conditioning, and I hope more American breweries will continue to follow it. You can tell a lot of love and care went into this. For those of you bored with the American amber style, give this a shot. It's great."
""
""
""
"Itâ€™s an extremely complex beer. I would say this almost leans on being an IPA because of the lack of that sweet crystal malt. Definitely my favorite beer in the category, much more than Nugget Nectar. Then again, at $8.99 a bottle, I wouldnâ€™t get this too frequently. A must try though."

"Muddy brown in color with a reddish hue and murky. Poured with a thick beige foam with nice staying power. The foam slowly reduces to a healthy cap that leaves sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Fresh earthy hop aromaa up front. Resinous pine with ripe citrus grapefuit hop aromas in tow. Intense caramel malt backbone with hints of dark fruit and chocolate malt in the background. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. Slightly pungent citrus hop flavors up front that intensifies through the middle before slowly transitioning to a pine hops to the end. Sweet caramal and bready backbone throughout with hints of chocolate malt toward the end. Finishes with a biscuity and pine hop bitterness. Complex flavors and aromas highlight this exceptional beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Meh, it's OK. Not exactly the ""hoppy, hoppy amber"" it's advertised as. The taste picks up the hop bitterness without the flavor."

""
""

"What a beautifully crafted beer - you could call this a dipa and no one would question it, but the huge malt character balances out the hops and makes for a delicious red ale. Recommendable."

"Overall: I was really impressed with this beer. Very well balanced. The hops aren't too overwhelming. I kept wanting to take another sip. I'm a huge fan of ""bigger"" amber/red ales and this is one of, if not the best I've ever had. Well Done. This is my second Maine beer (Lunch was first). I'll be picking up a few more bottles of this when I'm Philly next month."

"Deep hazy rust color with a big foamy head that leaves chunks of foam behind. Smell is malty, with citrus and pepper. At first, taste is caramel and pine resin with a spicy finish and a bit of bite from the carbonation. As it sits, the carbonation dies back and a breadier taste emerges. Feel is light with ample carbonation that gets lighter through the glass without going flat. Overall this is very enjoyable."
""
""
"O- I loved the chocolate/biscuit malt profile and it was well balanced by the citrus/pine hops. Mouthfeel was about perfect, high drinkability, one of the best of the style that I've had for sure."
""
"Large, frothy, long-lasting head sits atop the ruby colored brew. Heavy grapefruit aroma with some bready malts. Full bodied, thick textured, softly carbonated, and a bit of a chalky finish. Another winner from Maine Beer Co. I prefer the MO to this one but I would be happy to have either anyday. Love what this brewery is doing right now."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer, needs to sit in the glass for a bit and warm to room temperature before all the intricacies come out. Perhaps a bit overpriced but worth a try at least once. I really like Maine Brewing Company."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the deepest darkness Amber I've ever poured. The balance between the sweetness of the malts and the bright hops is impressive on the nose as well as in the taste. Almost a nuttiness or roast on the tongue from the deep Amber at first. There are plenty of citrus hop notes as well as bittering hops. The malts round this beer out quite nicely. Impressive beer beyond the sea of DIPAs and barrel aged offerings that seem to dominate craft beer lately."

"O - This is a delicious hoppy amber ale. Pine is the dominant flavor here, but there is a lot of complexity in the taste. The soft, bready malts blend perfectly and lend just the right amount of sweetness. Very impressive offering."
""
"Overall - Interesting brew. Almost like burnt maple syrup or burnt dark brown sugar, but in a good way. Thoroughly enjoyed. Would recommend."
"D: This was a nice brew with very enjoyable scent and taste. The body was solid, but the finish was harsher than expected, so it was not super easy to drink. A rewarding drink, but not as delicious as, say, Mouflan."

""

""
""
"A tasty hoppy brew from Maine Beer Co. A good balance of extreme hops and tasty malt."
""
"O- A flavorful, powerful brew. The only downside that I see is that it's not an everyday 'go-to' type because it's aggressive. As a hearty amber, it's the real deal."

""
""
""
""

"Overall really enjoying this beer, but it definitely doesn't fit in the category. Maybe it's all other amber ales that don't fit though. A+"

"O- If you like NN... you'll love the shit out of this beer! It's like a more mature Nugget Nectar. Tons of sweet, bitter and spice that dance all over your tongue. The only problem with this is the price. $7/16oz is gonna make it hard for me to justify very often. I wanna see how much of this excedes the 90 drinking date near me. I have a feeling not very much. Too bad this wasn't in a 4-pack for $20."
""
"Pours dark brown and can pick up some hoppy smell. Nothing to remarkable for the sight and smell. The taste is very smooth with an ok hoppy presence which for this beer fits well. It's more of a light hop upfront and a very smooth finish kind of sweet finish. Found myself guzzling it down always ready for another sip. Overall, another impressive beer from Maine Beer Company. This is definitely a beer to share with friends, wish it came in a six pack."
"I noticed the flavors changing a bit as it warmed in the glass but in a good way, so taking your time drinking this one is my recommendation.Very appealing flavors and aftertaste right down to the last enjoyable sip. My bottle was just under 2 months old, and it doesn't seem like time affected my sample. If you can get your hands on this one, it is well worth a try. Looking forward to sampling MBC ""Mo"" next tasting, and would definately buy ""Zoe"" again!"

"Pours a very deep amber almost brown in color with a big off white head leaving behind some awesome lacing. The smell is floral and grapefruit hops up front with some grainy notes and a bitter almost spent coffee bean scent. The flavor is rich and malty with a good amount of citrusy hops and a grainy after taste. The mouthfeel is a bit big from high carbonation, but maintains a good level of drinkability. Overall I am glad I stumbled on to a fresh bottle of this on a trip to Vermont."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks beautiful. Nose is great too; berry amber kind of thing going on. Hops are definitely biting on the palate. Great flavor ride. Kicks in on the end and gives a nice overall wave. Carbonation seems a bit too high and biting really. It really hissed a good bit when I opened it up. A very nice amber. A good first beer from this brewery."
"It's raucously hoppy, and I use that word rather than aggressive or tenacious because it suggests a little bit of fun. Yet it's somehow balanced. And that balance may be teetering, but it still somehow seems to hold. So, although it is a little off-kilter, it's not so far off that it's undrinkable. It all comes together in the end. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"This was way darker than I expected. Big, fluffy head. Smells of some tropical fruit. Taste is unbelievable. Tangy, hoppy, citrus, biting, bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy despite the bitterness. This is what I remember Nugget Nectar tasting like. But better."
"If you like Nugget Nectar, this is 0.5 points better overall in my view."
""
""
""
"Kind of having a hoppy Amber Ale shootout...had Nugget Nectar last night for the first time and I gotta say I definitely prefer Zoe. I find this to not only be more hoppy, but also has a more robust malt backbone as well. Just a bigger and bolder beer all around. Fantastic stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Smells great, but pretty malty and bitter."
""
"O - Very very good beer. It is an amber ale through and through, which to me means expert balance between malt and hop, with sweeter malts and subtle hops. Far more true to the amber ale style that other much hoppier offerings like NN and Eagle Claw Fist. Wonderful!"
""
"Overall: This beer wont blow your mind, but it is super tasty, dangerously drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Maine Beer Co. managed to pack so much richness of body and flavor into a 7.2% Amber that I'm honestly stunned. This beer is truly unique. The high carb level helps to improve drinkability in an otherwise very rich tasting, dense beer. Amber Ale not a favorite style of mine, but I can appreciate beauty when I taste it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very, very, solid American Amber. It is a little malty for my taste, but a very hefty and interesting beer. This is certianly an excellent representation of the more extreme ABV end of the style and a worthwhile pickup for anyone. Not my favorite MBC offering (total peeper, lunch, and mo fan here) but really good stuff."

"A very enjoyable beer. Exactly what it claims to be, a happy, hoppy amber!"
""
""

""
"Pours a deep, dark brown with a very foamy head of 2-3 fingers. Smell is predominantly malts along with a moist, hoppy earthiness. Opens up with toast and sweet malts followed by piney, resinous hops and a dry hoppy finish. For an amber, this is a fairly complex brew. The 7.3% ABV is well-hidden and sneaks up on you. Drinkability is off the charts. I am consistently blown away by this brewery."

"a deep amber almost brown pour with 2 fingers of off white head which dissipated slowly and caused lots of god lacing. lots of hoppy aroma. pine, caramel, more pine, fresh cut grass, and more pine. sweet cocoa-like malt profile with tons of hop flavor. grapefruit and pine like in an ipa, lots of caramel and slightly roasted chocolate flavors like a darker ale. medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. wonderfully balanced and tasty making this a diesel amber ale. just realized this is a 7.2% beer, so i guess it did a good job masking the alcohol!"

"O: Very good. Not as good as Lunch (the other Maine Beer I've had), but certainly solid stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: while this beer is still pretty good, I feel like some of the dankness and muddiness of the hops detracts from overall drinkability for me. This bottle isn't terribly old (about two months), but perhaps this beer is better closer to its source."
""
""
"D: some serious complexity on the body. much richer than your typical hoppy amber. the malt component is certainly the bigger driver of flavor than the hops. however it is totally reverse on the nose. much more floral on the nose than caramel/malty aromas."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brewed on 9-29-2012.Poured into an imperial nonic a deep amber with a large fluffy off white head that left multiple broken rings of lace as it settled into a frothy mass.Big floral and piney hops really jump out at ya along with sweet biscuit and brown sugar,the malt base is almost as big as the hop onslaught,a great nose.Sticky piney hops really stand out on the palate up front but a big brown sugar and biscuit malt base is there again to stand up to the hops,I get a little earthiness to round out everything in the finish.This is a complex flavor packed red,to me it's like an old school left coast hopped up red,great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A murky dark golden copper-brown color with a very healthy light tan head and super lacing. The aroma is surprisingly big with lots of nutty malt and pine hops as well as a little dark fruit. Really makes me think of something more along the lines of a barleywine or an imperial red. Very nice but not quite what I expected. The taste buds pick up a more blended mix of fruity malt and piney hops along with some grassy edges. The body is medium at best with tingly carbonation and a frothy feel. Very good though I'd say the aroma beats the flavor."
"O: Pretty nice beer and something I'd have time and again if it was available here. Well balanced, but still hoppy."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the soft, inclusive nose, and variety of hops throughout both the aroma and the flavoring. This beer is an affirmation of why we love American ambers and reds so much. There is such variability to the style, with room for such robust hops, and playfully balancing malts and spice. Not only is this a fantastic beer, but the story on the back of the bottle is one of the cutest thoughts weâ€™ve ever heard to the concept and conception of a beer."

"O: I really liked this beer a lot, and probably would have bumped up several scores except for the focus on the dank, earthy, herbal, grassy hops aromas and flavors. Even with this prejudice, I thought this beer was excellent."
""
"DELICIOUS, FIND A BOTTLE!"
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with a large dirty white head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of intense hops is quite interesting with nice floral undertones. Taste is a great mix between intense hops presence with limited bitter notes and some really good citrus and earthy hops notes. Malt backbone is quite solid and not too sweet to cut through the hops profile. Body is full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid offering with great dry-hopping execution."
"Overall - Incredibly good beer. Absolutely superb."

"pour is a very dark copper with a good bit of tan head. Nose is hoppy, grainy, and slightly roasted. Orange citrus, crystal malt, and roasted almost burnt biscuit.

"Dark brown pour. Even though this classified as an amber/red there really isn't a hint of that color in its appearance. Strong head and good lacing on the glass.

"O - Surprising beer; ""amber/red ales"" are not my favorite but I bought this b/c of the brewery. Glad I did - another great one by Maine Beer."
""
""
""
" O- perfect amber ale, I never find them super enjoyable, but this is such an excellnt beer"
""
""
"Overall: Personally not a big fan of reds, but this was a well crafted beer and credit is due were needed. I did enjoy this brew, but won't buy again myself. I can see why it gets high marks, and people that really like reds will enjoy this beer."
" The taste has a light toast and cocoa-nuttiness with a mild tinge of citrus zest and pine hop flavoring. The hop flavors do add a slight chalkiness to the middle with mild bready malt coming into its own with subtle biscuit-like essence bu a nice interplay of the hops with mostly grapefruit flavor in the finish. Overall this kind of amber is kind of a red IPA as is has a very spicy and highly hopped example of the American Amber style which can range from dull and almost a brown to this style which is hop forward and yet still has a nice backbone of malt. I can't say enough good things about this it was as good as I hoped it would be with a nice refreshing dry finish."

"Brewed 2 weeks ago, bought at Winooski Beverages. Pours dark brown with abundant soapy off-white head. English hop and rich malts aroma. Soft mouthfeel, though bitterness erases the palate in the finish. Toasty malt. Very drinkable and tasty.Lots of thick lace.I could have bought more!"

""
""
"Maine Brewing definitely knows what they are doing."
""

"O: I enjoyed it. Smooth and creamy feel really make this beer stand out."
""
""
""
"O- This beer was a fantastic amber ale that definitely surprised me. It was my first beer from Maine Beer Co.. I knew there was some hype and I wasn't sure what to expect, but this beer definitely surprised me in every way. It was darker then I was expecting, more hops then I was expecting, very smooth, and I really enjoyed it even though I'm not a huge fan of amber ales. Very well done, a little bit pricey but I will definitely be getting more Maine beers in the future."
""
""
"Overall this is a supremely great red ale that I am very excited to live near. I still need to try TroÃ«gâ€™s Nugget Nectar, but as of now this is the best red I have tasted! I can guarantee I will be trying Peeper Ale (their summer seasonal) within the week!"
""
""
"O: Really great, hoppy flavorful amber. Gives nugget nectar a run for its money. Very enjoyable and if you can find it, pick up a bottle."
""
""
""
"O - A very fine brew. Smells, tastes and feels great. Kind of pricy but I'd seek it out again."
""
"Smell of pineapple. Nice hoppy taste with just the right amount of carbonation. This is one hell of a beer for a warm day!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was happy to find this beer so fresh on a trip to Maine. In the vast sea of hoppy ambers, this one isn't aggressively hopped and allows the malts to shine. Shows great balance as well as complexity in the malt profile. Hops are certainly present but don't overpower. This is one fantastic beer."
"Drink- Overall, a good beer. My 2nd from Maine and they are doing a nice job up there. Flavorful and pretty balanced. Would have this one again."

"500mL bottle with 040512 on the side. Pours a dark chestnutty brown with an inch of frothy tan head. Lots of lacing. Great hoppy aroma. Citrus and floral with a nice overall sweet smell. Flavor is citrus hops, sweet caramel & brown sugar, and some earth. Floral hops as well. Nice bitter finish. Creamy mouthfeel. Not too much of an alcohol presence. Drinks very easily. Overall, not the best hoppy Red I've had, but certainly one of the best."
"O - This is a very well-done amber ale. The malt and hops are perfectly balanced in the aroma and the taste, and it has a great mouthfeel. One of my only complaints is the lack of clarity, but it doesnâ€™t diminish from the rest of the beer. This is a tasty, very drinkable beer that Iâ€™m glad I got to try. Next time I come back home to Massachusetts, Iâ€™ll look for more Maine Beer Co. beers."
""
""
""
"Color of the beer and the aroma make this beer very intriguing especially after you taste it. An excellent offering. Looking forward to one day visiting the brewery for this one on tap."
"(originally reviewed: 06-10-2011)"
"O - An interesting beer that has a lot of new aspects I have never experienced before. Decent all around, but not something I would need to seek out again."
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid beer but again, not one that is amazing. Maine seems to be brewing up some solid, not risky, beers."
""
""
""
""
"I'm a big fan of big and hoppy reds, and this is a good one."
""
""
""
""
"O: Real nice beer. The appearance and feel carry this beer to a 4.5. Totally worth the cost. Would suggest to this to anyone. I anybody thinks Nugget Nectar or Red Ale is too sweet, then this is the beer for you."
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Pours a very hazy brown with red highlights. Very frothy off white head which leaves behind some excellent lacing throughout the drinking session. Spicy, floral, earthy pine and citrus hops and light, sweet toasted malts in the nose. Flavor is well-blended pine and citrus that gives way to smooth toasted malts. Residual toast and citrus. Medium-bodied with good carbonation throughout. A very well-made amber ale! One of the better ambers I ever had."
"The beer pours a dark brown with a fluffy tan head that ades quickly. Smelling this beer leaves notes of chocolate, hops, and alcohol. The hops are piney and earthy and compliments the beer's malty base. This beer tastes excellent and has an even better mouthfeel. This beer screams earthiness, almost like I'm sipping down the fertile Maine soil itself. Definitely a tasty amber and it hits the spot."
""
""
"O: Definitely a good beer. Maybe nothing truly outstanding, but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish amber color (clear except for the last pour with some sediment) with a creamy, off-white head that persists and clings to the glass. The smell is nicely hoppy with some grain husk notes and a lightly sweet maltiness. A very pleasant aroma. The flavor is richly malty (crystal malt?) with a strong by well-balanced hoppiness. The sweet malt flavors and hop bitterness linger very nicely on the tongue. The mouthfeel is where this beer really shines, with a very, very smooth, velvety feel that only accentuates the malt and hops. This is a very enjoyable beer!"
""
""
"O: this was a great beer. My expectations were moderate when I think I was way more surprised how well this beer turned out. I would get this again in a heartbeat."
"O- good beer. Wish the citrus came through more in the tast as it does in tha aroma, but still a very good amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Really delicious stuff. Dryer and hopper than I'm used to in an amber, but also better. A good hot of grapefruit hops right away followed by a complex middle with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, tangerine rind and toffee with a dry and piny finish. Really tasty."
""
"O - while the nose isn't strong the flavors of this beer do make up for the short coming. a well made beer."
""
"O: This Amber is quite heavy on the malts but is beautifully balanced with the heavy hopping. Maine Beer Company really knows how to kick ass with the hoppy beers. Complex, easy drinking with no notice of alcohol."
"O - A solid brew. More like a hoppy earthy brown than an amber. A bit pricy, but oh well! Got way more caramel / nutty / earthy than some other users, not sure how."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Firestone Walker tulip. Pours a dark, garnet red with a 2-3 finger head. The smell is beyond muted. I tried my hardest to get any discernible characteristics out of this, but I can't pick anything up. Extremely muted nose. At most, I pick up some maltiness. The taste on the other hand, is wonderful. Very balanced with a subtle hop profile complimented perfectly with a nice malt backbone. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy for the style, with a perfect level of carbonation. The finish is a touch sweet and bitter at the same time. Very nice. Overall, this is just one more wonderful beer offering by the folks at Maine Beer Co."
""
""
""
""
"A spectacular beer! Extremely hoppy and bitter - I've never tasted a Pliny The Elder but have made one - Zoe is on par with Pliny, and Sierra Torpedo. Great malty backbone and perfect head. Nice hoppy smell, perhaps it's been dry-hopped. I look forward to trying the rest of the Maine Beer Company's bombers!"
""

""
""
"O: Mellower than most hoppy reds I've had, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy dark red amber with a two and a half finger beige head. Beautiful lacing. The aroma is a mixture of plum and black cherries, accented by grapefruit and citrus and a bit of grass and pine. Initially, the the flavor of dark fruit highlighted with grapefruit and citrus dominates transitioning to a bit of sweet malt and then finishes with piney hop bitterness. Considerable body supplied by a fairly hefty malt backbone for an American Amber/Red Ale, well carbonated and slick mouthfeel. A very enjoyable brew and very much on the same plane as Nugget Nectar."
""
"This is just slightly better than Nugget Nectar."
""
""
"Cost: 5.99 for a 16.9 oz bottle."
"This a very good beer and different from a lot of ambers that I've had before."
""
"O- very good, the well short of the greatness of nugget nectar. Needs more juiciness and maybe some tropical fruit."
""
""
"O No freshness date, I suspect I might have gotten an old bottle. Just not much here."
""
"o - really a wonderful beer and definitely put a smile on my face. much hoppier than most amber ales that i have tried, but that's a good thing. worth seeking out imho."
"Overall, I'm not a huge amber or red fan. This beer, however, is very good. I'd seek it out again."
"overall very solid red/amber - i have beer impressed with the 2 offerings i have had from Maine Beer Co. - hope to try more"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good amber though one I feel is a bit non-traditional. Not that thatâ€™s a bad thing by any means, but I was expecting a slightly different experience from this one. Either way, this is another solid offering from Maine Beer Co.!"
""
""
""
"O-a great amber ale, one of my favorites. Great balance of flavors."
"Poured from a bottle and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is an extremely dark, opaque, ruby highlighted brown coloring with a frothy, dense, foamy head that is off-white and starts around a half an inch, slowly settling into a nice, dense film. Aromas are rich and hoppy, with a resiny, green, floral and citrus aromas on a sweet caramel backbone. Smells delicious. Flavors are hop forward, with peppery spiced and floral characteristics leading the way. The malt profile gets a bit overshadowed by the strong hops presence, lending more of a red IPA feel to the beer. The caramel sweet backbone can be felt more at the end of the palate, along with a dark roasting characteristic. The bitter and reisny hops lead through to the aftertaste, as well, and the beer leaves a slick, foamy cling behind as you drink. The finish is dry and bitter, with a resiny linger left behind. Good, solid beer with some very strong and unique characteristics. If you are a hop head, this is a very pleasant beer to drink."

"dark reddish brownish amber with a tan head that left some lace. nose is a very nice mix of pine and grapefruit layered on top of chocolate and roasty, caramelly malt. taste exudes very good balance, and the layers of chocolate, caramel and hop come together very well. creamy, soft, medium-full body. i thought this was begging for some spicy bbq. pleasant hop bitterness, and although there was definitely a touch of heat, the alcohol was well integrated as well, and barely noticeable. it seems as if maine beer co. is making some very flavorful, very well balanced beers. this one was no exception. yum. thanks g."
""
"O: this is a hoppy brown ale. I don't really care for it, though it has some excellent characteristics. Too much roasted malt with fruity hops isn't a great combination for me."
"Bottle to oversized snifter. Looks pretty good; very dark for an amber. Nice carbonation and lacing. Smells great; the hops are pleasant, as is the malt. Tastes great too; I'd put it ahead of Nugget Nectar. Great balance between the hops and the malt. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, a great beer that I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try."
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Really nice amber ale that has a lot more to it than most beers in the style. Really great nose and hop presence."
""
"O- Very surprised by this one, especially with the clear presence of chocolate. Great stuff, highly recommended."
""
"I really like this beer. Nice interpretation on a pretty wide open style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: A very solid beer, with a lot of flavor and aroma packed in to a very well made pacakage. At 7.2%, it's a little higher on the abv scale for a beer of this style. My first beer from Maine beer company, and one I was thrilled to have tried - reminds me a lot of Celebration, but darker, this one would be a great winter sipper and one I hope to try again."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is resinous and hoppy with an interesting burnt character about it that keeps it back from being more drinkable. I've certainly enjoyed most of the offerings I've had from these folks and wouldnt mind trying more. However, from what I've had, I've been least impressed by this offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall just a little something odd that I can't put my finger on. If the foaming is any indication of infection, it didn't seem to have any obvious off flavor indicators."
"D - solid amber ale here. Nice bitterness and complexity to it makes it an above average brew and one I would love to try again."
""
"M: The big head saps the carbonation from the ale, allowing the flavors to intensify and not disappear in each sip. The spicy hops are comforting, a piquant flavor content to linger."
""
"O - Very good interpretation of the style. Wonderful balance, with bright tones in all the right places. This is a beer I would recommend to anyone. Extremely drinkable even at 7.2%..."
""
""
"This beer pours with a nice brown color with a just off white head that is dense and long lasting. There is sheets of nice lacing as well. Aroma is light and citrus forward with a hint of roast. Very balanced aroma. Flavor is has more coffee and roast than the aroma but is very well balanced with mild smoke. Citrus hops complement the malt profile very nicely. One of the fewer beers that I have had that successfully balances a more roasted coffee malt profile with citrus hops. Mouthfeel is medium light and is well carbonated. It is quite enjoyable and well balanced. A bit pleasantly surprised by this beer. Didn't have the highest expectations, but I really ended up enjoying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very good beer. I definitley enjoy all of Maine Beer Co's beers and out of the 3 I have had this one is my favorite. When ever I can find a beer made by this company its a happy day for this guy. If you havent had Zoe go find her. Great Great Beer. Now I need to find me some Lunch."
""
""
"Medium body, a little higher carb, sticky and refreshing. Everything I've had from this brewery has been really on point - I'm looking forward to more!"
""
"Zoe pours surprisingly dark. It's a heavy brown, almost edging towards black, and there are some nice cherry highlights. Three fingers of cream colored foam billow up and top the beer. Head retention is very good, and lacing is solid, but not overly impressive. The aroma is nice, if fairly one note. It smells of dank, resinous pine. I'm a bit surprised there's nothing in the way of malt present. The flavor is a bit more varied though, and leads off with a smooth caramel swirl. That's followed by a mild wave of bitterness. The hoppy close is predominantly the same resinous pine notes present in the nose, but a bit of an herbal flavor creeps in at the end and adds a bit of complexity. The body is on the full side, and a little bit creamy, but the carbonation is almost nonexistent. A little more pep on that front would be a welcome addition. Zoe is my second beer from Maine Beer Co. (I tried Peeper Ale a couple months back), and it's quite good. I look forward to trying more beers from them in the future."
""
""
"Overall a delicious brew."
"This brew is delicious and gorgeous. Nice hop notes and a delicious malt backbone. Very well crafted. If I lived in Portland, Maine this would be in my fridge constantly. (4.5)"
""
"Overal: A truly solid beer. Much more hoppy than most reds but I really enjoy it. It's not an imperial red or a scortch your face off beer but it's flavor is very nice. It's appearance and mouthfeel really set the tone as they are both nearly perfect. I could drink a lot of this beer!"
"Nice, but nothing special. Wondering if thereâ€™s Simcoe in there. A touch of dark malts makes this one different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"11/24/11 bottle. Pours a deep but clear burgundy with a fluffy beige head. Way darker than I expected, nearing black out of the light. Nose is a fresh assortment of hops, biscuit, some pleasant light fruits. Mouth is almost spicy up front, sharp pine resin, bright cloves or something, some light bready tones. Body is really light. Dry throughout, finish is spicy hops. I've been looking forward to this and it's quite a bit different than I expected, which is a great thing especially when it's as good as this is. These guys rock at brewing hoppy ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"While it's nothing revolutionary, it is very well done. I like sweetness as long as it's well tempered, preferably by hop bitterness, which it is here."
"Tasty enough but the hops are subdued in the nose and the pellet bite detracts in the finish. Shades of homebrew here."
""
"M - Smooth, little carbonation, and incredibly drinkable. Having experienced two of Maine Beer Co.'s four beers, I can imagine moving to Portland, drinking their beers every day, and dying happily. The brewers have done some fantastic work."
""
""
"16.9oz bottle purchased at Trader Joe's in Portland, ME. Pours a slightly hazy red-brown boy with nearly an inch of khaki-colored head. Smells sweet and fruity. Tastes malty but not overly sweet, with roasty dark chocolate and espresso notes as well as some herbal and earthy hops. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Pretty good overall - roasty and malty but light and drinkable. The best of all worlds."
""
"As the beer warms it seemed to get a bit more bitter and waters out slighly."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavors with an herbal tea lasting finish. Well done beer!"
"O- I highly recommend this beer. I was thrilled by how it tasted and all of its other characteristics were favorable."
""
"Zoe will be a big hit with hopheads, but I was hoping for more out of this beer. She's bright and snappy, kind of unidimensional, but also unobjectionable."
""
""
"Digital fist bump for mjn5036. Thanks Matt! Poured into a Duvel tulip. Dark ruby body, huge taupe head, ridiculous head retention, ridiculous lacing. Ultimate score for appearance. Fantastic nose that seems to be heavy on the ""C" hops. Pine and grapefruit I abundance. The bottle is dated 102711 but the bouquet is still phenomenal. Perhaps it's a little subdued at the moment but it's a hop lovers wet dream. More of the grapefruit and pine on the tastebuds. Not really an amber ale as much as it's an IPA. It's reminiscent of Furious. Nice soft level of carbonation compliments a dry finish. Great beer."
"O: Good, solid beer."
"Maine Brewing Company Zoe pours out the dark amber I Envisioned. A nice dark amber with some light brown shade and a tannish cap of foam up top leaving good amounts of foam on the glass. a decent amount of bubbles rising up. Smells awfully hoppy right off the tap. A nice mix of pine/earth backed with citrus. Trace amounts of pale malt ride up the tail end. Smells awfully clean and ready to drink. Drinking this is nice, what is advertised is delivered, a hoppy amber ale. The amount of biscuit coming from the malt drives down this nicely hopped ale into something more balanced, leading in the amber directon. Caramel seeps through gently and glides with the earth/pine/citrus. Feel is a step up from light with a nice carb that is felt. I could do a pint of this if the day and mood was right, I just don't see myself going out of my way for it. Reminds me of celebration ale."

"What a pleasure. So good. I want to remember this one the way I had this bottle, so awesomely fresh, don't know if I'd get it again if it was much older. The best example of the style I've encountered, including Nugget Nectar."
"D - Not bad, the aroma is quite nicely put together but the flavor profile doesn't work quite as well. The bitterness is kind of soapy and the hop character just isn't as bright as it was in the aroma."
"I really enjoyed this beer but was disappointed that that the intense, fruity hoppiness seemed to fade as the liquid warmed. To those of you who plan on drinking this, I would recommend doing so quickly (and rather cold) in order to enjoy all of its hoppy glory."
"O: A solid hoppy amber that's well balanced between a sizable caramel malty body and palate-smacking hops. Right up there with Arrogant Bastard for me (a little more malty with more citrus, perfect)."
"O - While I feel it exceeds the ""light to moderate hopping"" typical of a red(aren't most beers these days) this a great beer. Fresh and sweet. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is floral and citrus, resiny and sappy, moving to piney notes, some orange rind pith. Understated caramel and toffee malt rides beneath but gets pushed back down by the hops. Malt rises up more strongly as it warms and brings nuances of crusty bread and dried leaves. Dry and crisp, finishes tingly. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is full flavored and well done. I usually prefer a little more malt balance, but there is no complaining on this beauty. May have to pick up that sixtel my distributor has!"
"O: A great beer, one of my favorites. Highly recommend. This is a special ale from a special brewery."
""
""
"Overall: Not as uniquely complex as I was expecting, but not as bitter either. Fantastic aromatics, perhaps that is why the taste was a little disappointing. Not completely blown away, but definitely not a bad brew either."
"I would pair this with game and poultry, fish and chips, and pork dishes."

"With all due respect to the American Amber/Red Ale style, I did not have high expectations. But Maine Beer pulled it off. It's incredibly balanced, nicely cooked, and very refreshing. Much like Peeper and Lunch, this is remarkably good. I'll be shocked if they can make a bad beer."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a magnificent deep amber, with a tanish red highlights 2 inch sticky head, that takes some time settling, gorgeous lacing. Smell tangerine, pineapple, pine, and some grass. Taste is all of that, with a little hint of carmel in the finish, really well balanced. Most dominant flavor tangerine, by a tiny margin. Body is really nice, a little on the larger side for the ABV, very easy drinking. Not really dry and the perfect amount of life. Hello Maine Beer Company, welcome to New Hampshire! This is a wonderful beer and says the date of 10/27/11 on it, hard to walk past this when fresh."
""

"O: this beer was all over the place, not in a bad way its just that the smell didnt jive with the taste and the taste didnt jive with he mouthfeel which didnt seem typical for the style, i just dont know how to react, dont get me wrong its a great brew but for the style, idk its just wacky i guess, loved it at the end of the day i guess"
""
""
"O: Whoa, mama, what an American amber! The 7.2% ABV pushes this beer into the stratosphere of American strong ale, with its complex fruity and smoky malt profile combined with lush, bitter hops that provide a full-range of flavors. A really nice brew that I wouldn't mind grabbing again and even aging a bit to see where things go."

"O - This was perfect for a colder day. Nice and hearty with the malt, inviting and a little refreshing with the hop, they achieved a nice balance. I enjoyed this beer and would have another, if only I were in Maine."
""
""
""
""
"O: I love any time I can spend in Maine. Maine Beer Company has created yet more reasons for me to appreciate the state. Four more reasons, with Zoe being one of my top 2, along with Lunch. Peeper and Mean Old Tom are right there, too. Fresher releases are much more complex, as expected. This is a special ale from a young brewery to watch and, of course, to try when possible. Distribution has just been expanded to NH and VT, along with Boston, MA (also NYC, I believe). The price is a natural drawback, but doesn't reduce the quality."
""
""
""
""
"O - well worth seeking out if you've not had it... as my friend would say, quite a tasty treat !"
"My aunt and uncle picked up a bottle of this while they were in Maine a month or so ago. The beer poured out as a deep looking amber color. In darker light it looked brown. The head was white and had a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer was hoppy, there wasn't too much else really happening besides some citrusy hops filling the nose. The taste is bitter but yet. Dry drinkable in my opinion. Has some sweetness in the flavor also. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a pretty good carbonation to it also. Overall I thought this brew was really good actually. I would drink this one again for sure."
"Zoe pours a rustic chestnut-brown hue, and is topped with a sturdy cap of sudsy tan froth. The nose is sweet, imparting maple-ish tones, and it is spicy in an earthy sense. There also is quite a bit of discernible alcohol in the aroma. The flavor offers a bit of toasty-roasty nuttiness atop the sweetness, as well as an earthy-herbal understated hoppiness. Unfortunately, it is, again, unpleasantly alcoholic (especially for 7%) Not a bad beer, but not terribly special."
"Overall, this is a damn fine amber. Good, sturdy hop profile with a good imbalance that allows the hops to carry the load, but the malts are showcased as well."
"Overall - Great beer. With ambers, it's tough to be over-the-top impressive in any category, so I'm always looking for that beer that delivers in every category. This one comes damn close. Very nice beer."
"Overall: This is an impressive beer. I am definitely a huge fan of the red ale, and this one does not disappoint."
"As a lover of hoppy Red Ales, I just have to say that Iâ€™m in love with this beer. From its beautiful look, to its flavorful yet well balanced profiles, to its super easy drinkability, this one just all the right notes for me. The other two Maine beers Iâ€™ve had (Peeper & Lunch) got close for me but this is the first one to really knock it out of the park, as I think this is definitely the freshest that Iâ€™ve been able to try one of their beers. Iâ€™m super excited to here that this is going to be distributed in SE PA going forward, as Iâ€™ll definitely be picking up some more bottles."
"Overall: this beer had a nice flavor profile and was very easy to consume. Worthy of a try by anyone who likes the style."
"Hopefully a fresher bottle is better?"
"M -Light to medium body with light to moderate carbonation."
"Pours a dark rusty copper color with thick pillow of dense off-white to khaki head, good retention and lacing. Strong hop aroma brings notes of pine resin with pungent citrus and light medicinal notes, moderate amounts of toasted bread and nuts with a faint hint of caramel. Taste again brings the hops, big and bitter citrus and pine, again a faint herbal/medicinal note, malt backbone is firm, light toasted bread and nuts with a lightly sweet caramel note, hints of earth... like a muted scotch ale. Medium bodied, smooth and oily, dry finish. A really nice hoppy amber with a solid, but not sweet malt presence."
"Zoeâ€™s label is simple but appropriate â€” the smiley face looking out at me right now mirrors my own. A balanced, drinkable, flavorful, mighty fine hoppy amber."
"overall: A very enjoyable and drinkable beer that I'm fond of. Extremely good when fresh."
"Initially, at the front end, it tastes like roasted barley with a slight nib of dark chocolate, and I expect that to follow differently than the fruity/citrus driven hopsplosion that ensues. Fresh grassiness and smoked woodchips finish it out with a lingering chalky malt and sour hop tingle. Very interesting brew. I like it, a LOT. Try one!"
"O: By far the best I've tasted in this style. Can't drink too much of this, or rather it's easy to drink too much of this, but it really exemplifies the juxtaposition of balance & complexity."
"Bottle given to me by cavedave. Thanks man! Pours brown, only letting light through the edges and with a nice big root beer float head. Looks great. Smells like a hoppy brown ale - nice light caramel and nutty toffee flavor. Very nice. The taste is extremely interesting. The malty and caramel nuttiness of the amber makes it come off as a brown ale. This is balanced by a pretty strong dose of hops, which come together really well. Drinks very easy. The flavor reminds me of beer made by Ale Asylum in Madison, WI, which is a pretty random connection. I like this one a lot. Nice carbonation and good body. This beer is really tasty. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a reddish/brown haze. Even the foam had a reddish hue; almost looked like a fresh ripe fig. Fantastic looking. Smelled very very hoppy, but the taste wasnt overwhelmed with hops. Very hoppy initial flavour but finished very crisp, malty, and like a red ale should. An amazing unique beer! It is in my personal top 10 maybe 20 beers I ever had. Buy it if you see it! I just wish the bottle was bigger! :)"
"It should also be noted that this is one of the simplest, but coolest labels in all of beerdom..."
"O: Very enjoyable amber ale, smells great, tastes great and works really well for me. Very enjoyable beer. I really wish this was something I could get regularly, nice beer here!"
"A very good hoppy brew. I would prefer more caramel notes and less tropical fruit hops but I am being picky. Can't go wrong with this beer."
"O: This is really quite good, with an earthy tone to all the flavors. I'd definitely like the flavor transitions to be a bit more clear, but I imagine having a fresher bottle will give a much more dynamic experience. I really enjoyed drinking this, but some gaps in the mouth feel definitely made me wish I had a super fresh bottle to determine where the error was stemmed from. Another very solid beer from Maine beer co."
"PHUCK YEAH Maine Beer Co!"
"Very smooth and easy drinking, finish lingers with a slightly bitter earthy flavor."
"Awesomeness from Maine beer company."
"This is a very high-quality rye."
"Overall, this is a very solid and well balanced hoppy amber. I'd grab this often if it was a local option. I'll happily finish this bottle."
"Zoe pours a really, really deep red, like clay red. Huge puffy off tan/light tan head tight, tight carb and a bite'o sheeting. Just a hair to dark on the color for me. Super fresh, olfactory over load of hops. Big piney and resinous hops, light citrus undertones. Massivley pithy and piney red ale here. But wait there's more, fruity flavors and malty flavors too. A well pronounced malt backbone. A slightly lingering bitter hop/bitter chocolate finish. I'm buying more of this stuff. This beer was so insanely fresh, all should seak this out."
"Had this one on my wants for a while since hoppy ambers are my favorite style. I was not let down. Very complex flavor profile. I would love to compare one of these to a fresh Nugget Nectar next spring."
"It is an interesting one for sure."
"Taste is hearty grain husks to start, comes on strong in the middle with citrus hops, with a smooth segue into the prominent bitterness, which lingers with a light alcohol warming. Mouthfeel is smooth, maybe a touch grainy, and drinkability is good. Nice fall brew, even if it's available more often than that."
"O: A. Great beer again."
"O-I really enjoyed this beer, it is classy, tasty and drinkable. My only real complaint is that I kind of wish it was in a six pack rather than a 500ml. Great beer though. I am not to familiar with red ales but I thoroughly enjoyed this one."
"Pours a rich, deep copper with a two-finger, thick, dark cream head. Great lacing and the head goes nowhere. Sweet citrus aroma. Grapefruit and orange zest lead, also a hint of tropical mango notes. This is a well hopped Amber. Starts innocent enough with slight notes of grapefruit before a bitter earthy and pine kick comes through. Solid caramel malt adds sweet and creaminess before a big hoppy finish. Bitter citrus notes, some grassy flavors and more pine bring it home. Big flavorful amber from this impressive Brewery."
"Pours a deep hazy amber, off-white head slowly turns to a thick film, moderate lacing. Big time hops in the aroma. Citrus, grapefruit, floral, some sweet malt hidden in the background, very pleasant. Taste is well balanced. Mild bitterness, sweet malts, caramel, the aftertaste gives me a hint of roasted malts, sweet malt as well as grassy, floral hops. Medium mouthfeel. This beer is complex and well executed. It reminds me of a black ipa, malts and hops are both assertive and demand attention, they play off each other wonderfully. Full flavors and a beer I will recommend to friends."
"Overall: I won't lie, I didn't understand why people loved this beer the first time I had it, or the second, or even the third, but it finally clicked. Nicely balanced with an assertive hop character, but an equally solid malt profile. Also, this beer helps save whales."
"Very well-conceived and accomplished Big Amber/Red Ale!"
"O: wish I had gotten to this earlier to get more of the hop notes but it's still delicious. Definitely worth a try. This beer made me a fan of ambers."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. It reminds me a lot of the Cigar City Tocobaga I had a couple weeks back, but with a darker malt backbone. This was a fantastic beer and I wish I had a case of it. Hoppy amber ales are slowly becoming my favorite style because of there balance of malt and hops. Highly recommended and worth seeking out; I know I will be."
"O: another highly flavorful and balanced brew from Maine Beer Co. They are doing things right."
"Overall: I wouldn't say this is a perfect beer by any means, but it tastes fantastic. I'm really loving it and would definitely have another."
"Poured into a true pint glass a very nice cloudy dark amber color, very nice carbonation, HUGE three-finger thick creamy off-white head, with alot of nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is hoppy, with some nice malt notes thrown in, slight citrus, and caramel. The taste is AWESOME!, hoppy, nice blend of malts, with a slight citrus note thrown in. Medium Body kinda creamy, smooth feel, ABV is non-existent. This is one of the best amber's I've had to date. Thanks Bill!"
"Appearance is amber with a 1 finger white head and quite a bit of lacing. The smell is a mix of piney hops, caramel, toffee and malts. Zoe tastes rather hoppy, some citrus, most evidently from an orange, some roasted malts and pine. MF is medium with a finish that is fairly dry. Looking forward to enjoying more beers from Main Beer in the future."
"$7 a bottle."
"This is a great beer, with all the breweries pulling out of this area I am happy that we are able to find jems like this. Not sure if it out of code but it sure tasted good. It has a smile on the front of the lable and it sure put one on mine."
"Another fantastic offering from Maine Brewing. Lunch is spectacular and this is not far behind. If you can get one, try it, you'll be glad you did."
"Overall, a very good hoppy amber ale. Exactly how I like my ambers."
"O - A great hoppy amber, something I'd love to drink regularly. Good beer that I will try to acquire more of when I'm in the mood for this type of beer."
"Frankly, this is growing on me and Iâ€™m a little pissed I only picked up a couple bottles. I was too focused on Lunch. Lesson Learned. Well done folks!!"
"Though I prefer my amber ales a little hoppier, this is a solid offering from MBC. It's not trying to be Nugget Nectar, and for what it is it's successful."
"Overall a very pleasant and well balanced beer that grew on me significantly as I sipped. Though at first I was a little put off by the strong malt character, this same character proved to perfectly balance with the strong hops up front and in the nose. The results: a wonderful Amber truly worth trying."
"O: 9/10. a hoppy amber to be sure, but very well balanced and delicious."
"Overall- not a bad hoppy amber but I have had much better, I think this beer would benefit from a more active dry hopping and less of a the bittering hops."
"Overall, this was an excellent beer from Maine Beer Company. I look forward to trying more!"
"Another great beer from the Maine Beer Company! The beer looks amazing when poured. I nice medium head with a brown /amber color. The smell is pretty good, nothing outstanding. The taste however is outstanding, with great hops and hint of sweetness. The mouthful is pretty good, but expected a bit more. Overall definitely a beer I'd recommend to any beer drinker. Well done, again!"
"O/D - One of the best looking beers I've ever seen and definitely the bet looking amber/brown ale. Tastes great to boot with great roasted malt character and a strong hop presence."
"Was expecting a bit more hop presence given the freshness, but Zoe is a very good beer, balanced and very easy to drink. Keep it coming, Maine Beer Co."
"This beer pours a reddish copper color, slightly hazy with a nice off white head. the smell is hugely hoppy with some nice malty undertones. the flavor follows sui with there being a huge hop flavor right up front followed by the malty backbone that keeps the beer rounded. mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. overall this is a great beer, but i find maine beer co to be a little expensive."
"Notes 7/23/11. Purchased in Vermont. Great amber. MBC is two for two, so far for me, and Iâ€™d love to try more from them. Pours a deep reddish brown with a nice off-white head. The aroma is big on caramel and hops. Citrus and pine notes abound. Mildly grassy. Itâ€™s just a big mix of caramel maltiness and pine resin/orange/grapefruit hoppiness. Taste is drier than expected, a welcome change from many strong ambers. Aftertaste is all citrus rind and resin. Full mouthfeel but not outstanding in any particular way. A very easy beer to drink and to like."
"Overall, a very impressive beer. Excellent hop aromas and flavors with a sweet malt character that brings a nice balance. The hops are the showcase here and they don't disappoint. This beer was extremely fresh, being bottled 8 days before it was consumed, and it certainly showed."
"Bottle via Glouglouburp-pours a cloudy dark chestnut/iced tea with a lively white head and delicate lacing. Nose- grapefruit, caramel and tea. Taste- nutty, herbal and almost slight chocolate roast underlying character. Grassy hop bitterness is intertwined with sweet bread on the finish. Touch of alcohol head. Crisp carbonation and somewhat chewy mouthfeel."
"Overall: I'm not quite sure what to make of this beer. It's not bad, but the flavors are strange and it almost tastes like there's an incipient infection, though I can't be certain. Definitely a strange beer."
"Overall, I really liked this beer. Attractive amber beer with a strong hop character, but not overly hoppy. Strikes a good balance! Completely recommend picking this up if you see it. Though it is listed on BA as an American Amber Ale, this is almost a strong ale. I guess Imperial Red Ale would work too!"
"O - Big hoppy reds are a favorite of mine and this one doesn't disappoint nice hops and malt in the flavor make this one easy to drink worth getting if you see it around"
"O - Very tasty, and I'm usually not the biggest Amber fan (outside of Nugget Nectar). The mint/chocolate thing adds a nice level of complexity that I wasn't expecting. Great beer!"
"O: A perfectly balanced hoppy beer with pleasant and subtle sweetness and spiciness with just the right amount of alcohol burn at the end; this is a damn good beer"
"D: Drinks quite nicely. If I didn't have to drive to Maine every time I wanted one.."
"O: Great beer. Neither the malt or hops are overpowering - they stand on their own and also make a great combination at the same time. I would say that this is second only to Nugget Nectar. That's saying a lot."
"At least Maine went with the traditional spelling (though I don't have too much against ""Zooey", frankly)... Anyway, it pours a clear russet-garnet topped by a finger of cream-tan foam. The nose comprises pine, toffee, mint, and orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, though with a more pronounced toffee character and the addition of a touch of cocoa. It's sweet, but not too; and it's hoppy, but not too. Very nicely done here. The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice amber, the third consecutive winner from this brewery. Get some."
"Bottled on date of 4-28-2011"
"O: This is a delicious offering. It's not as hop forward as other Ambers that I enjoy (Nugget Nectar, Brian Boru), but it's a really fantastic beer."
"Glad to finally get a chance to try this after a quick two day trip to New England. Pours a deep reddish brown with a strong eggshell white foam head into a pint glass. Much stronger earthy pine hop aroma than I expected in an ""imperial amber"". Taste has a big malt caramel backbone that did not come through as much in the smell to balance out the hops. Got some toasted biscuit taste in there to go along with a great balance of caramel malt and piney hop resinous bite. This beer has found a unique balance that I haven't found readily in other beers. Really enjoyed this one and will seek out again. Top notch stuff."
"Beer is medium bodied and very hoppy, chewy grinding, nice. Moderate bitterness, great finish. I'd have it again for sure."
"D: Great beverage and easily drinkable. A little on the steep side price-wise which will be restricting my intake, but a real good offering nonetheless."
"The brothers at Maine Beer Company are super cool and low key. Take the tour if you get up to Portland. Love the Peeper and had the Lunch for the first time recently. The Zoe is my favorite. Awesome head, subtle fragrance and great brown color and legs that don't ever stop (natural fermentation), Nice Malt and caramel blends well with Hops. A strong beer you will wish you had more of. Good luck finding it..."
"Overall: a very nice beer, but the general lack of hoppiness gives me pause. Perhaps this bottle was a bit old, but then again, who knows? Love the simplicity of the labels, and their mission statement makes me want to love it. I'll have to give this another try down the line, maybe when I'm up in Maine and with assurances that it's fresh."
"A simple but novel take on the style, above average among its peers."
"(130th)"
"the gravity doesn't seem to read as anything syrupy. actually quite brisk. and lightweight but very complex. beige mahogany. a bit cloudy at the end. nose of pine oil at first that breaks into a bit of a caramel and toffee note. palate is a fruit forest fruit. predominately blueberry... a whole lot of blue berry. and hints of baker's chocolate acidic notes and blood orange citrus. well balance with a dry but not too dry end. more so on the desert end of citrus notes. aftertaste of one of those chocolate orange candies that you break apart. a bit milky even. great brew. a must for anyone that like good humans."
"Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a blast of earthy, bitter hops up front that lingers over the sweet malt profile into a bitter, dry finish. Lots of dank, uber-fresh piny hop flavor which is excellently complimented by the sweeter malt notes. Lots of chocolate, caramel and toffee flavor without getting in the way of the hops. Usually I dislike hoppy beers with this strong of a malt presence but here it creates perfect balance and adds another layer of complexity."
"This is a smooth beer. Nice malty start to the taste--mostly the paler versions without any graininess. Excellent hop as a spice, not as a predominate flavor. The alcohol is present as a warming effect. Long aftertaste of white peppered hop. The body is full with a decent level of carbonation. In short, a very good, well-balanced beer."
"o - overall, i continue to be impressed by the beer i get to taste from maine brewing company. really is the marraige of the amber to a hoppy ipa. the hops help the amber a bit, but i'd probably rather have just the ipa. definitely worth seeking out."
"My first MBC beer, and I must say I can't wait to try more. One of the best made beers I have had this year, just fucking delicious."
"Overall I loved this beer. As mentioned, the aroma was better than the taste. I wish the malt profile didn't drop off before the hop flavor on the tongue, but I'm splitting hairs here. Overall this is fantastic, and something Iâ€™ll be looking for again."
"O- Well, this was a pleasant surprise. A fantastically well-balanced amber ale is not what I'm usually after, but this is beyond impressive and definitely too good not to try. Excessively drinkable at 7.2% with no traces of alcohol, this is something I really need to have consistently stocked in my fridge at all times. I will definitely be looking for more in the near future."
"Way to go Maine Beer Company, you guys are doing very, very well. Cheers!"
"This is quite well done. Impressive (to say the least)."
"overall this was a really solid amber, i liked it a lot. wouldn't go crazy for it, but i would definitely enjoy it again."
"A flavorful and delightful brew. Let it settle and pour carefully if you want to minimize the yeast in the look, but truly, the yeast in the pour of this one doesn't effect the flavor too much."
"Overall: Maine Beer Company is a brewery to be reckoned with if you are a hop lover; I, for one, am going to keep my eye on them as this is a great example of a hoppy amber"
"Pours a rich amber color into my pint glass. Two full fingers of cream colored head. Some lacing remains. Caramel and malt on the nose. Surprisingly this beer is hop forward. Cures that malty/caramel garbage I was worried about in the smell. Quite a pleasant beer."
"I had this when it first came out and like it better now that I've come back to it."
"I guess I wanted to compare this to Nugget Nectar before going into it. It's not as bitter or citrusy as NN, but in its own right, is a nice representation of the style. I worry if anything goes missing in this beer, though, there is nothing else to make up for it. One little missing flavor would throw this entire beer off. All in all, a very nice first offering for me from Maine Beer Co."
"Overall: Wow. This beer is fantastic! What a great extra! This beer makes me understand what a hoppy American Amber Ale is ALL about! Smells fantastic, balance is near perfection, and it very drinkable at 7% AVB. Its a beer that is a great beer for a someone who needs wants an introduction to a tasty hoppy beer without destroying the tastebuds with bitterness, but is also great for someone who has a more sophistocated palate. I really dig this brewery and want more of this beer and also want to try more of the other 3 beers that this brewery currently brews! A MUST TRY!"
" This one is a WOW!"
"Update 22 Jan 2012 - just cracked open a 4 month old bottle (27 Sept) and it is as good as a much fresher bottle. I could smell the piny hops as soon as the bottle cap had been cracked open. I purchased this bottle off an unrefrigerated shelf yesterday. This is one hoppy beer that does last."
"O - A fantastic beer. One of my favorites. An excellent bang for the buck."
"O: A definite rival to Nugget Nectar. This is one hoppy beer and one I feel deserves just as much praise as the all mighty beer by TrÃ¶egs. I'm not sure amber ales are ""supposed"" to be this hoppy, but what the hell, that's the way I like them! Well done Zoe. Thanks a ton for sending me a few of these Michael!"
"Fresh, bright and citric hop flavors come out to play, big time. Pleasant balance of toasted caramel malts. This is the second beer from Maine Beer Co I have had and am wishing this was a local brewpub already. Very good stuff. Clean amber ale that manages to distinguish itself in a loaded style category with its lovely hop aroma and flavors. Superb!"
"A very nice red. Its a decently big beer, in the same vein as a few other imperial reds, e.g. Uncle Rusty. The aroma is fantastic."
"Pours a hazy deep amber with a huge fluffy off white head. Coats the glass very well and leaves tons of suds all over. Aroma is very hop forward; piney, grapefruit, earthy. Some smokey and roasty characters in the nose as well. Flavor combines the hoppy aroma with a caramel malt sweetness. Bitter, slightly astringent finish. Bubbly, almost prickly on the tongue. Well balanced hoppy amber ale. Bit pricey, but worth it."
"O/D-Overall, this beer exceeded my expectations. Zoe is far too drinkable. I absolutely love this brew. Every aspect of this beer demands high marks. I have been waiting a while for this one and am so very happy to indulge in its flavor. Great, great beer!"
"Overall, this is a slightly below average hoppy amber. Ok, but there are many better beers out there in this category."
"Overall, great beer from a new brewery...looking forward to seeing what else these guys put out."
"O - Solid beer. I recently had Nugget Nectar for the first time and think this is every bit as good... just doesn't carry the hype for some reason. I wish I had a Nugget left to try next to this. Very legit beer that I would suggest trying to anyone."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: This was a really balanced ale with a lot of complexity and great drinkablity. It is a pricey at 6.50 and I wont't be buying another, but definatly worth the chance to try it."
"Overall, this is what I want an american amber to be. Definitely delicious. I kept trying to tell myself this is not as good as I think, but it is. Will be buying more. Probably all the time. One of my favorites"
"Wow was this good, I wish I had another. I also wish it was just a little cheaper, it would be hard to turn to this too often if I lived in the distribution area, needs its price knocked down a bit for daily consumption."
"Overall: This is the kind of beer I could keep on hand at all times, or--even better--drink fresh at a bar or local taproom on a near daily basis. Masterfully put together. Compares very favorably to Nugget Nectar or Cascazilla, both very formidable beers. I've been meaning to try Maine Beer Co. for awhile now, and having done so I'm very impressed."
"Enjoyable example of the style. I also liked Peeper Ale as well. Check it out!"
"Overall: Great Dark Amber Ale (if I can say so) that is easy to drink and enjoyable. Doesn't feel like a 7-8% ABV beer. Recommended. I can see this becoming my offseason replacement for Troegs Nugget Nectar."
"Easy drinker -- a hoppy brew that you can put down pint after pint. Worth having."
"Cheers to the Maine Beer Company for this wonderful brew and their environmentally conscious practices. I happily support this brewery and look forward to some more of their offerings."
"635"
"O = Another strong contender from Maine Beer Co. West Coast craft brewing style with an East Coast twist. Very well done!"
"Pours a beautiful deep red color with a huge bubbly tan head that survived for the entire glass despite leaving lots of lace in its wake. Orange and other citrus fruits dominate the aroma. Hints of resin are mixed in there sparingly and mingle well with the caramel and bready malt aromas. Great smelling brew. Taste is mildly caramel and a little sweet. Think of bready malt mixed with citrus, orange rind and tangerines. Hints of chocolate and citrus in a long lingering but fairly dry finish. Medium to light body is maybe the only thing I could suggest to improve this one. I would have loved a touch more body. Smooth resinous and candy like sweet mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. Wow, this is a fantastic beer. Not once did I notice the 7.2% abv. Smooth light easy to drink, if they could only find a way to make this more available I would buy this all the time."
"As a native Mainer, I couldn't be prouder."
"This is a pretty nice imperial red. It's easy to drink and enjoyable. This would be in rotation were I within distribution range. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel has a solid medium body feel and a nice clean finish. Overall, Maine Beer Co. has an excellent hoppy amber (or brown) ale and I look forward to more from them."
"A refreshing beer for the summer I'd say. I just wish it was a little lower in alcohol since I'm barely getting any sweetness/malt flavor."
"(D)- A solid to great american amber. Malty and rich with an assertive yet balanced hop profile."
"Overall this is a solid beer, and really hits the spot after a long day of work. Provides a nice hoppy aroma and flavor with a balanced malt backbone. Hoppy amber ales are a style I would love to have more of. I wouldn't mind drinking some of these again in the future."
"O: A pleasant drinker that is different but comparable to Nugget Nectar among others."
"O- By far, the best amber ale I've had. Full of flavors, and very well balanced out. Big thanks to whoever sent this as an extra!"
"O: This is a very good beer. Hoppy but with enough of a malt backbone to balance it out. Pretty impressed with what Maine Beer Comapany is doing. Skal."
"apologies on the review i'll touch this up soon but there's a movie to be watched with the woman and she's mad i'm talking so much about this chick zoe."
"When I smelled this one I couldn't help but think that I was drinking a sort of Nugget Nectar clone. It certainly smelled that way, but unfortunately it didn't reach that level in terms of flavor. That's no knock, however, because it's still very tasty. A really nice beer from this new-to-me brewery."
"a year later and I've picked this beer up every single time I've been in a store and it's been less than 2 months old. One of my favorites of all time."
"This is an amazing beer, blew me away. Nose is similar to nugget nectar but a more ""pine"" like profile. Lighter in sweetness than NN and light overall, but unbelievable creamy smooth on the mouthfeel. Definitely try this beer."
"Another winner from this small brewery in Maine, not only in taste but also tastefulness. There's a tad too much hoppy pine in the aroma, bending slightly toward new-carpet smell, but it's not overwhelming nor does it contribute to hammy hoppiness in the flavor. Definitely dry and crisp with hops to the fore, but everything here has comfy rounded edges, like a giant cotton beanbag chair. For a good hoppy American ale, it lacks the hostile attitude of so many of its cousins from the West coast. MBC is a pearl of New England."
"D - Refreshing and easy to drink."
"O - i had heard a lot of great things about this company and though i thought the peeper ale was very good quality it did not blow me away but i knew i had to wait to try this one. it definitely holds up to the hype in my opinion. go get one."
"I'm thoroughly impressed - count me in, I am a fan."
"O - Overall this is quite a nice amber ale. I think the malts get lots just a little with all those fresh hops, but I can appreciate the bitterness it lends. Very enjoyable brew from Maine."
"The feel is light with somewhat sharp carbonation. Leaves with a nice bitter sweet finish. Overall, one of my favorite offerings. I send this as an extra so often it's about damn time I give it a review."
"Cheers!"
"O - Fantastic beer overall, world class for this style IMO. It's a little pricy, but completely worth it especially if it's fresh...I'll be getting more of this and I hope it is a year-round beer."
"I may have waited too lonf to try this, as I was expecting a little bit more. The appearance was beautiful, with a deep red color and soft white cap. The smell was good too, with an earthy mix of hops, malt, and citrus. But the body and taste were a little too light for me. Still, very good."
"O - this is a solid beer with a lot of things going right for it. To me the flavor needs a bit of tweaking but this has potential to be a top tier brew. I'll be looking forward to see new things from this company in the future."
"All in all, this is another solid beer from Maine Beer Co. I've only tried two brews from them and both are solid. Definitely give this one a try if you like hoppy dry beers!"
"Mouthfeel is fine, plenty of body, no issues with the carbonation. These guys are pretty hyped in this area right now, but I'm pretty disappointed with this offering."
"o - nice beer, the heartiest red ale i've ever had. or is this a barleywine??"
"I don't give a Schlitz for Zoe, but only because I'm not a fan of the style."
"At this point, I'm incredibly confused. i'd think something like an imperial amber, or a super dry-hopped india brown ale. I think this is the most perplexing blind beer I've had to date. Not to mention, the unique shaped bottle is confusing me even more."
"Probably not quite in Nugget Nectar territory, but this is a great amber - hop forward with the right balance of malts and body. Well done."
"This is an absolutely fabulous amber red ale that's fine tuned for the IPA lovers in the crowd."
"D: for as big and hoppy as it is, CRUSHABLE in my book. so damn good i could drink it all night. another homerun from Maine Brewing Co."
"The CPJ"
"This is a good beer. Good balance, good hopping, good body. But the overall dry character of it, from the middle through the finish, is a distraction to me. This dryness is also probably why some love it. A little more malty and a little less dry and I would score it higher."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5, Aroma 4, Taste 4, Mouthfeel 4, Drinkability 4"
"The more you drink the more the hops take over. However this is a real pleasant brew, and this is very good beer. It's quite complex and hard to find its nuances but I like complexity so this is my thing."
"D - This is an excellent beer. I had heard quite a bit about this one and was definitely excited to give it a try. Definitely lived up to the hype and my expectations. Looking forward to having more of these and trying some of the brewery's other offerings in the near future. A bit heavy to be extremely drinkable, especially in warmer weather...full of flavor and really good beer - probably a couple in a session is enough though."
"This is a drinkable beer. I wanted to like it more than I do. I would drink it again, but will not seek it out."
"Way different than I expected. Flavor combo was kind of strange, malt was really strong. I was thinking this would be comparable to Nugget Nectar but it was quite different."
"HV"
"D: Very drinkable, not overpowering, yet interesting enough in flavor to entice. Reminds me of a black ipa with a better malt profile and a more straightforward citrus hoppiness."
"Drink is great, a nice hop character not too bitter, the dark malts add a nice flavor without too much body or syrupy flavor. Very well balanced, tasty."
"Feels creamy and smooth and is a pleasure to sip."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very crisp and refreshing. Extremely drinkable, would love to have this one stocked in the fridge for sure."
"D - Very easy to drink and enjoyable. We finished this bottle quickly and my buddies really enjoyed it as well. Give it a try!"
"Nice very nice start with a slight caremel malt and quickly becomes hoppy and finishes all hops. The bitter becomes prominant but isn't offensive a well rounded hop taste very nice"
"Overall, an interesting take on the amber style. The char and toasted notes are a nice offset to the earthy hop flavors. I would definitely try this again. Definitely worth buying."
"Interesting twist on a red. Good beer, smooth, easy to drink."
"Overall a balmy hopped up amber ale."
"D: An unexpectedly good beer that offers up a very nice blend of malts and hops. I am an admitted hop head who does not like malt crowding out my hops, but, for me, this beer is capable of showcasing malts without distracting from the hops."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. The metallic notes in the taste though has me thinking. Maybe a little more malt sweetness to balance this bird out and it would be near exceptional."
"D: Easy drinking for sure, but this is not my favorite style in general, so I would be somewhat reluctant to have a second -- I will not hold that against this fine beer in my review, of course . Not a whit of booziness is detectable despite a moderately high 7.l2% ABV for the style."
"Great beer - well done."
"Drinkability - Would drink this all day long. An amazing beer from a brewery I have never tried. I still have one more beer from this brewery that Drazzamatazz so graciously provided, and after this amazing experience, I can't wait to try it. Damn god."
"I find most ambers bland, but this one is far from bland. Full of flavors and very easy to drink. This is an exceptional example of what the style is, in my opinion. Looking forward to trying more beers from Maine Beer Company"
"D - Very drinkable. Slightly bitter at the finish, but doesn't detract from the drinkability, I could drink several of these, especially with a low(ish) ABV."
":)"
"Pours a two-finger cream head that takes fades slowly leaving some lace. Deep opaque, brown/black color some yeast left in bottle. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor is pine and resin hops, malts try to balance but don't. Lingering bitter aftertaste. Doesn't look like an amber but tastes like one. $6.10 for a 500ml bottle from a Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. The body seems a bit light to me and with over 7% abv this one is a sipper. I'm hoping this beer will soon be distributed in Mass."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice malty and hoppy flavors to it. Very enjoyable beer overall, and a good version of the style."
"Received this one in the BA Secret Santa 2010. Love the 500ml bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Zoe looks like pond water, it poured a surprisingly murky brown with some bright highlights around the very edges, gotta say i was expecting more.. red. I dunno. A large, strong, tan head floats upon the brew. Big hits of fresh resinous hops in the nose, some of that grapefruit, lots of wet pine notes and chocolate underneath it all. A very creamy texture is noted, round and silky, chocolatey malt and some bright hops dominate the flavor with a crisp finish, crazy balanced. Unlike anything ive had before really, im very impressed."
"Mouthfeel is clean and medium/light bodied with a good level of carbonation."
"D: At 7.2%, this is one beer that I cannot get enough of... until I almost pass out of course"
"This brewery only offers a couple beers, but they do them very well."
"Give these guys extra props for promoting that they are a environmentally green and that they donate proceeds to whale preservation. A good gesture on a solid brew!"
"Overall a great hoppy amber ale, very drinkable, very hopilicious. Probably the best amber I've had yet. I wish I lived closer, because I would buy tons of this beer."
"Pours a nice reddish-amber color with a good off-white head and some nice lacing. The nose is really quite nice with a really strong presence of citrus and pine hops as well as some light amber malt. The taste is a bit of light malt with a good level of bitterness, though not as much as the nose would have indicated. This drinks really well and is a beautiful Red IPA (let's get that new style rolling...) and I'd love to try a few more things from Maine Brewing."
"I found a bottle at Global Warehouse in Ellsworth. It poured a deep dark brown - slightly unfiltered. The smell was citrus and balsam. Very nice. The taste was similar to smell - and it left a pleasant aftertaste. Nice head that left lacing along the glass as I drank. I am very pleased with this - I persoanlly believe the ABV is too high at 7.2 - but I was not tasting alcohol. Well balanced. Excellent beer"
"This is an excellent beer, bottom line."
"I like Zoe, and I would recommend trying it. I think I liked the Spring Peeper a little more, but it's tough to compare the two and the Peeper is excellent. I hope I can try Maine Brewing Co.'s Stout, or anything else I can get my hands on in the future, because the two beers I have tried that they made are quite good."
"The best amber ale I have had by far. Blew my mind! The flavor complexity is amazing almost drinks like an IPA which is something that I do not mind. Highly recommend you try this one if given a chance. I definitely want to try this one again."
"D: Very tasty and flavorful, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer with a lot of flavor and substance that make great drink for an entire evening."
"DB- I am glad I picked this one up. Tastes like a pile of wet, fresh hops. Probably the best Amber Ale I have ever had. I know where I am going to stop in Maine whenever I visit. Comparable to any great IPA as far as hop flavor goes. The body, flavor and bitterness level make this one dangerously drinkable."
"This is an exceptionally well-done beer, and has cemented itself as my favorite to date of Maine beers. I had to pick up another and the Spring Peeper before heading back, so we'll see if it gets knocked off by its sibling."
"D: While I like the bottled version better, it was really great to see this in a different format. MBC continues to impress me given their small size"
"Notes-I don't need my ambers overly complex, just balanced. This one is near perfection."
"Bottle. Pours fairly hazy red color with an offwhite 1 finger head. W-O-W, this has a really hoppy aroma that I really like. Really strong notes of citrus, spice, and floral notes. Some tatent nuttiness in the nose as well. Very creamy medium/light mouthfeel. Slightly sweet up front that quickly transitions to anice strong citrus rind hop taste that builds in strength and remains well after the beer is gone from your mouth. The floral hops really come through as well in the aftertaste. Some bitterness in the end as well. If I was told this was an IPA I honestly would believe you."
"Overall, one of the better imperial reds I have had. Very fresh and hoppy. Drinks like an ipa and I like it, but it still has some malt to let you know its not an ipa. Pretty good drinkability on this one. Thanks Hollie for a great brew!"
"D-Not normally a hoppy beer guy, but this one is a great example of a balanced amber ale should be brewed. This is a terrific beer and I am enjoying it on a cool saturday, well done and recommended."
"I am not usually an Amber guy, but this beer was fantastic. They advertise this beer as a happy, hoppy amber. For once, there is truth in advertising. If you live in Portland, do yourself a favor and get some Zoe."
"This is ok, but a weird chalky/hop feel and taste distracts me. Decent brew but not a top buzzed."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for opening this one up at our tasting. Pours a hazy plum with a half inch, frothy, off-white head. Nose reveals sweet citrus and apricot. Taste follows nose on a light, toasted malt background with some bittering hops coming out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a pleasant and even background carbonation. One of the best American Ambers I've tried. A bargain at $5.99 a bomber. I would drink this all the time if it were more accessible."
"Glad I made it a point to hit Portland on the way back from Bar Harbor to procure a bottle of this beer. Amply balanced, good solid malt character, really pushing the roast malt for style, but that's a-ok, it is well integrated. Check it."
"From the 25 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on July 26, 2010. The pour is a darker amber-brown with about a three-quarters inch thick silky tan head and good lacing. The aroma is nicely hopped with a little pine and barley. The taste is also decently hopped and bitter with a very distant background of hops. But the bitter hops really take over. This is listed as an amber ale but it really feels more like an IPA. Quite good though."
"drinkability is nice. pretty well balanced. nice hop profile with a decent body to back it up. this ""hoppy amber"" was quite nice."
"M/D- medium bodied and medium carbonation. both work really well for this beer and the almost 8% ABV is very well hidden, quite the gem my buddy Smutty33 brought back from maine with him and cracked open with me."
"D - My style is more along the DIPA and Imperial Stout so i don't know what to say.. cuz i can easily have this but it makes me want something of the other.. this just falls a little short with hoppiness for me but it's an amber ale so i can't judge it like that.. i have to judge it for what it is... in that case i think this is an A beer... cuz it's not my style and i'm still enjoying this... glad i was able to get some!!"
"D: I like this brewery... I greatly enjoyed this beer and their Peeper Ale. Really looking forward to what they do next."
"Poured into a tulip. Head foams up nearly to the top of the glass; about 2 inches and shrinks to a half finger layer. This is a little darker than a typical amber ale, almost brown. The pour was gorgeous though. The smell is almost all hops. The carbonation drives the hops through clearly. I think I'm sensing amarillo and a very little bit of caramel; very enjoyable. This is one of the most unique tasting beers one can find. It's dominated by hops and has strong bitterness, but the finish leaves a little bit of rich malt flavor from the dark malts. The mouthfeel is slightly sharp but this is an awesome beer."
"Overall a fantastic beer. Really under the radar here and one of the best extras I have ever recieved."
"Super glad to have had this one. Although it was a bear to get it was definitely worth the effort."
"D - I had no problems with the 250ml in my glass, and would gladly have finished the rest of it. It's a shame I didn't buy more of this one, as it's a very successful and enjoyable brew. Looking forward to more offerings from these guys."
"D: So. Scarily. Great. I'd love it if this was one of my ""locals"". I could drink this all day."
"The second offering from Maine Brewing Company. I've been drinking a lot of this beer recently, but just now got the chance to sit down and reminisce. 16.9 oz bottle, smiley label. This is one handsome beer. A hearty pour yields a huge head and the retention is unbeatable. Thick inch of foam tops a rusty garnet brew, thick lacing on the way down. Hops dominate the nose, mostly pine, and subtle malt presence. At first sip... Mmm. Hoppy, yes, very bitter up front with lots of pine / spruce flavorings and some citrus, but also plenty of malt backbone for balance. Rustic, toasty bread malt and the slightest sweetness underneath the hops. Zesty. Excellent lingering dryness on the palate, yet a robust and supple mouthfeel, very sturdy. Really tasty beer here folks. And this beer is great w/ food. Having just moved to Portland I'm excited to have this available all the time. Definitely worth seeking out, as is their Peeper Ale - these guys are on a roll. I literally cannot wait to see what they brew next. Cheers!"
"D: Nice. I thought the taste was a little bit of a let down following the excellent smell. But overall, this is still a great hoppy amber and I would seek this out again. I imagine it's amazing fresh from the tap."
"Very nice beer. It's hoppy and smooth with a good malt backbone, very rich with an awesome carbonation. Some bitterness on the finish. The malt is very different from SNPA but the hoppy finish is reminiscent of it. Another great surprise from this small brewery, keep it up!"
"d: Thanks Joe, I was really hoping you'd include one of these. Feel free to send more anytime. Another great one from MBC, really glad I got to try this."
"D: Goes down very easy, very tasty, great kick, great representation of style. If I had better access to this beer, I would drink it every day!"
"Beer is a dark amber with a creamy, ivory head that lingers. Smell is fresh and yeasty with some sharp piney hoppy notes. Taste has a nice malt backbone and an assertive mixture of caramel and pine and hops. It's complex and very good. The beer is fairly heavily carbonated, which makes it quite drinkable. The carbonation and the hops are a nice counterbalance to the dark malty/caramel stuff that's going on here. All in all, an excellent beer. This strikes me as a darker version of their Spring Peeper. Good stuff."
"d - A decent amber ale. I thought it smelled really nice but was somewhat lacking in the taste. I just didn't think the citrus and pine hops came through in the taste like they did in the smell. Would try again."
"This was the second beer I've had from Maine Beer Company, and I have been very impressed. I thoroughly enjoyed Spring Peeper, but this one was even better. In an imperial pint glass the beer was a dark red/brown color with a huge tan head that resembled whipped cream. A nice amount of lace. A really sweet floral aroma, very outdoorsy, and a bit of citrus. Strong pine taste, as well as a little grapefruit. Some malt presence too, making this a very well-balanced beer. You need to find this and try it."
"Definately would have again and recommend."
"I'd have to say I prefer this over the cask format (as I usually do though). The strength is well hidden so I could have multiple of these no problem, although I think my tongue would get worn out from that burnt/bitterness aftertaste. Still, another great beer coming from MBC (definitely not to be confused with BMC)."
"The bar was set very high on this one with the aroma. This is a great beer and I'd definitely seek it out again."
"Do not miss this."
"A very interesting and enjoyable brew that straddles the line between styles. ABV is not noticeable whatsoever . Glad I picked up a couple of these, and I would grab more if I saw them."
"Body is perfect for the style, whatever that may be. Decent amount of carbonation, a cask version would be amazing I'm sure. The 7.2% ABV is not a factor at all and if it wasn't for the staying power of the flavor I'd would have probably sucked this down way faster than I did. Overall another great beer from Maine Beer Company."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Maine Beer Company logo glass. The beer has a very dark amber color; it looks nearly brown in this dimly lit room. The head is large, tan colored, and made up of various sizes of bubbles. There is some patchy lacing. The aroma is very impressive. One whiff and I exclaimed aloud ""wow!"" It smells of very fresh hops. There is almost a toasted quality to the hops that I haven't come across before. The bottle I have is super-fresh (bought today, delivered to the store earlier in the week, most likely bottled late last week), which must improve the aroma a lot. The flavor is just as impressive as the aroma; actually, I find it to be even more complex. It started out with a toasted flavor. It makes me imagine burnt embers leftover after a campfire. The hops kick in quickly. They are big, bitter and floral. The bitterness lends itself to the toasted aroma and initial flavor, perfectly complimenting the aroma. The is just a bit of sweetness in the mix. It lingers on, along with the bitterness, but last longer, which gives the sensation that the beer gets sweeter after you swallow it. After a few sips, the sides of my mouth felt a slight tug. The bitterness provides the slightest amount of puckering. The beer has a lighter body than I expected. There is plenty of carbonation in each swallow. As I mentioned above, the sweetness lingers on; this is through the coating. The beer goes down so easily. I can feel its strength slightly; after a few rounds this may become a problem. I don't believe that the hops/bitter tastes will ever get overpowering. I could drink this beer all night. I feel so lucky that this beer is brewed and sold so close by. Maine Beer Company have outdone themselves."
