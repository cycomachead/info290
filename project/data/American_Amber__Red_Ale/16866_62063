Smell was a bit underwhelming for me, but some crisp hops, smooth caramel and bread hold it together. Taste is very good: chewy caramel sweetness up front, bread and malt in the middle with the oak aging coming through too, and some and some pepper, spice and hoppy bitterness bring up the rear. Feel is thick but a bit soapy. Overall, decent red, not my go to style, but Bruery made it a pleasant experience for me.","Samuel906","Feb 08, 2014"

The nose is big and bold with loads of citrusy, resiny, piney hops along with hints of oak, brown bread, caramel, toast, tangerine, brown sugar, and vanilla. The taste just as big and just as bold as the nose. Mouth-puckering resiny hops dominate, but some great sweet bready maltiness balances it out nicely. Sweet brown bread, blood orange, molasses, pine, pink grapefruit, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and a really awesome herbal character highlight this complex and flavorful red. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and really oily with absolutely perfect balance and an awesome bitter-sweet velvety smooth finish. Overall, hands down the best Red Ale I've ever tasted!","beerdrifter","Dec 25, 2013"

It isn't especially great but for the style its flavorful and complete. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Solid brew overall for both the style and flavor.","kylehay2004","Nov 16, 2013"

4.2,6.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange rind, toast, toffee, floral, grass, bread, clove, oak, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and very balanced hop, malt, and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, orange zest, grapefruit, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, clove, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, citrus zest, floral, grass, toast, toffee, light pine, oak, clove, vanilla, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance of hop and malt flavors with moderate oak barrel presence; with a nearly perfect hop/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy, slightly sticky, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an awesome red ale! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 18, 2013"

The 25% oak aged beer that is blended into the fresh beer really accentuates the natural pine characteristics of the centennial and summit hops that were used in this ale.

Sweet fruits and light vanilla with just a bit of leather. Taste is reminds me of fresh baked bread, quickly followed by hops and a lot of vanilla. Nice, subtle oak presence as well. Caramel and chocolate malt linger with each sip as the hops and vanilla blend nicely. Very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy with a nice, bitter-sweet finish. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a fantastic beer. I highly recommend drinking this beer with a fresh palate to really enjoy it and experience its complexities. I had it on tap at the brewery (after I had a couple bigger beers) and don't remember it being this good at all.","DovaliHops","Sep 06, 2011"

While the aroma is good, the flavor is better and more complex. I get a lot of caramel malt notes, as well as some oak, maple and vanilla. I also get a little bit of cherry and other dark fruit in the aroma which is a welcome addition. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

3.78,-4.3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D/O: There are a few beer styles that are more likely to cause a certain type-casting of their producer; the kind of association which, for better or for worse, will forever connect brewer to style. American IPA is one such style, and the Bruery seems intent on not having their reputation tied to it. The practical outcome is that they find all sorts of other, less-conventional vehicles for hops delivery. Here, they pack a hoppy red ale with a lot of assertive oak--it is definitely not an IPA, but it stands in well enough. If anything, it is one of the most reserved and understated of all their more popular hoppy beers: less focused on the hop profile than Humulus Lager, and less intense in general than Cornballer or Old Richland. It drinks easily, but lacks that compelling extreme-ness of its cousins.","beagle75","Apr 19, 2011"

Earthy and caramel/toffee malty sweetness helps but doesn't counteract the wood enough. Cut back the wood...or maybe it will mellow (unfortunately as well as the hops) and smooth out a bit with time, but not sure that will do it any service either.

Just to put it out there, not much of a fan of the oak-aged beers yet, but this may change me. It wasn't overpowering with the oak, just a suttleness that adds a ton of character to the 6.9% brew, which is welcomed compared to many of the other over the top oakey brew on the market.

3.6,-8.9,4.5,4.5,3,4.5,3,"Loakal Red pours an impossibly deep maroon, to the point it's beginning to cross the line into brown. Cherry highlights are readily apparent when the beer is held directly up to light though. The khaki colored crown is enormous to begin with (four plus fingers), and retention is off the charts. The frothy cap never disappears completely, but slowly drops and collapses into the center, almost as if I had dropped a scoop of ice cream into the glass that was slowly melting. Nose is a very good blend. It's equal parts citrus and caramel, with just a hint of oak coming through as well. Caramel and grapefruit show up again in the taste, but are both overpowered by the oak influence. There's some straight oak flavor, as well as an almost sour tannic quality that is way too potent. I'm a little let down that Loakal Red's not a little hoppier seeing as it advertises itself as a "brash red ale" on the bottle. Mouthfeel is great, medium bodied, and exceptionally chewy for being so. This would have been a problem if the beer was as hoppy as I was anticipating, but with a more subtle hop flavor it works. Carbonation is just about picture perfect too, medium to high and with enough verve to elevate what Centennial characteristics there are, yet it stops short of being fizzy. I really like the idea of Loakal Red, blending a barrel aged version of a beer this style with a fresh batch is fairly unique, but the tannic quality from the oak barrels, not to mention the oak flavor, ran roughshod over everything and ruined what was an otherwise excellently executed beer.","axeman9182","Nov 14, 2010"
