"Dank, hoppy nose, a sexy golden hue, good creamy lacing and by damned if this isn't my favorite of the four MT beers I've tried while here on Maui."
""
""

"First new era can for me. All fears about metallic favors gone. As to this offering: amber is well described. So, too, hoppy. Tropicals in the nose, with some caramel backing. Taste gives way to standard bittering hop profile less so than some notes of citrus, pine, floral, tropical, etc. Pretty simple toasted grain sweetness balances the bitters."
""
"On tap at Beachwood Seal Beach and served in a half pint as a warm-up for the bottle share. Slightly hazy orange to amber in color with a finger of khaki head that settles to a cap and leaves some patches of lace. Aroma is dank hops, grapefruit, pine, more tropical fruit, and a bit of an herbal note. The malt aroma features caramel and toasred bread. Taste is thoroughly dank and moderately bitter with the tropical fruit and caramel sweetness offering some balance early. Medium body, viscous texture, lower carbonation, and a long bitter finish."
""
""
"Overall this beer was still absolutely amazing and I would love to drink some more some time very soon if possible."

"love this beer.. a month old... very dank and hoppy.. awesome everyday drinking beer for me."

"So I received this beer via the NBS BIF thread, courtesy of @aoampm.  What is so amazing about this beer is the smell.  I'd say caramel and vanilla, pine with maybe a touch of honey.  Very prominent smell and it is wonderful.  One of the best smelling beers I have had in a long time.  The beer was fresh (1/13/15) and exceptional.  It is called an amber but it seems to be more of an IPA quality to me only because the hops are so abundant.  However, there is plenty of vanilla and toffee sweetness in the taste.  At just under 7% abv, it is not quite an imperial, I suppose.  I love Nugget Nectar, a benchmark  imperial Amber, but give me this over Nugget anytime  Send more :)"
"O: Found this in Chiang Mai, drank in Kunming Feb 10th, 2015.  A great brew.  I’m sure it’s a little old and would have been even better fresh, still its holding out well."
""
""
""
"I don't care what they call it, it's an IPA. It's amazingly hoppy for an ""amber"". A great, readily available beer you can always rely on. My new go-to for any day of the week."
"Slightly hazy cream soda-like appearance with abundant lacing, smelling of caramel sweet malt with a touch of honey and pine, tasting excellent balance between the pungent hop character and the elegant malt back, with good carbonation to compliment the lightly weighted  mouthfeel."
""
"Overall- very nice beer, unique and well balanced. it isn't something i would run to buy again but its tasty and satisfying, definitely worth giving a shot."
"O- I love this beer. Much better than I expected it to be, and I certainly think it's an amazing year-round for what it is, especially given the current rAvg of 4.1. I think it's higher than that- it's an Amber/Red but I definitely enjoy this a lot more than the likes of Nugget Nectar which is considered one of the best hoppy Amber/Red ales out there."
"O-this brew is one you just keep on sipping and the pint is gone really great brew"
""

"This beer has a very unassuming can design.  I wasn't familiar with the brand and didn't expect too much (yes, I judged the book by its cover.)  Took a sip and thought... hey, that's a lot better than I expected - didn't think I should rate it so high because anything is great coming from very low expectation.  After a few sips, I put the beer down and THEN it hits me.  The citrusy hop flavor lingers... for a long time.  It just begs for another sip then another and made me really sad when the can is gone."
"I dream of this beer with bbq"

"OVERALL:  A great example of West Coast hop flavors, Modern Times Beer has created a very successful recipe here.  Gaining some momentum from hop heads and beer collectors, this is a perfect canned hoppy amber ale.  Delightful."

"so smooth and dank.Could drink this every day if it were available in AZ."
"O: This beer is flat out fantastic it combines juicy hop flavors with deep Carmel bready malts it just hits everything perfectly it may be a tad unbalanced towards the hoppy side but it is delightful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great initial hoppy taste. Then the alcoholic taste kicks in. It is alright."
""
""
""
"Nice dank, resiny aroma!  Taste follows with some piney hoppiness. Mouthfeel is light medium with prickly carbonation. Not much bitterness. Overall tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this dank tasting Amber.  The Nelson hops really come through."
"O. A nice amber with some IPA charteristics. Enjoyable beer. Would definitely drink again"
""
""
"Pour is dark copper, clear, white head, large bubbles and lacing.  Nose is riddled with sweet malts, toasted grains, candied hops, faint citrus.  Flavor is thin, very malty, lots of toasted caramel, bitter grassy hops, faint citrus.  Medium body, lighter carb,"

"t/m/o - taste is of amber slapped with a variety of dank citric and tropical flavored hop. You can definitely get the amber underneath the hop and it's clean soft caramel toffee. Fairly heavy, but a mean amber.  Happy to have a few of these...ideal for this cooling weather."

"Excellent, though amber may be a little misleading ... I think more of a hopped IPA rather than amber, but to each their own."
""
""
"M - Pretty ideal, mediumish bodied, solid carbonation, ideal. 4.75"
""
"Overall (4.25), this is easily my favorite ""hoppy amber", out of the several I've had and it's certainly Modern Times' best beer. Some may quibble over the idea that it's an amber at all, since the hop profile is extremely aggressive, but I think there is just enough grain and bready sweetness to keep this one grounded in the style as much as any hoppy amber can be considered to be an amber ale. I really wish I could pick this one up on the regular in my neck of the woods."

"A solid red IPA (That's really what the style is) but one that didn't quite meet the hype for me.  Very hoppy with a focus on pine.  I certainly smelled an tasted a little bit of that sticky dank hop character promised on the can but I would have liked more.  To me the piney bitterness really took over.  Overall a solid beer with a lot of flavor but not as good as I had hoped."

"Opening with a big, bright and dank pine resin hop blast with moderate grapefruit, candied orange and some weed, this is excellent. An oatmeal-like creaminess is present on the mid-palate, working well with the hops. Also present is a mild sweetness with notes of toffee and brown sugar. Drying on the finish, moderately bitter and plenty pine-y, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated and thoroughly enjoyable. Excellent stuff."

"overall, this is quite balanced and great. it's dank and hoppy, but the malts are more substantial than in IPAs and balance out really well with the sweet flavors. i cant believe how smooth the finish is either, again, with a rather substantial hop profile, this beer is easy to drink. quite enjoyable!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall this is a well made hoppy amber."
""

"Pours reddish amber, good amount of head retention and sticky lacing left behind. While the nose does feature significant dank hops as the can boasts, caramel from the malts comes through very strongly. Earthy and herbal hops present but without too much implied bitterness. The taste delivers exactly as the nose leads on. Plenty of piney hops and caramel malts with a very smooth bitterness. The lack of bite from the hops makes this endlessly drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated. OVerall, this beer is absolutely crushable."

"Overall a spectacular red/amber ale. Every time I think I don't like reds/ambers, there is a brew like this to change my attitude."
""
""
""
""
""
"While I generally prefer ambers from the Pacific Northwest (nothing pairs so well with fresh caught salmon) - I will add this to my shortlist of SoCal beers (Hop Head Red; My Bloody Valentine, etc.) that make the style their own."
"O- Wasn't all that impressed when it hit the glass, but different story in it hit my lips. Just a really well done IPA that embraces the Nelson and Mosaic throughout. One of the better hoppy ""ambers"" I have had."
"O - Hop aroma is a punch in the face, but is followed by a drinkable beer with nice aggressive flavor. I could see myself drinking a few of these out on the golf course."
""
""
""
""

"Pours with a very thick, creamy white head that leaves a nice lace around the glass. The head on mine dwindled down just a bit, but It could be my glass. Smells like fall. Tart grapefruit maybe some pepper. Smells like hop heaven. Awesome! Tastes almost like a bitter. Some cinnamon flavors, a bit of citrus in the background. Doesn't taste like it smells, but this is a fabulous tasting beer. Yum. Would like to have this on cask. Thick and creamy in the mouth. A bit sticky. Surprisingly not too heavy. I could see myself drinking these after a hard day of work trying to quench my thirst. This is a delight. So glad I picked this up!"
""
"O: Ambers can often be bland or unremarkable but this was a really good departure from the norm. Great hop aroma but not overly bitter. A balanced and very drinkable beer. I will seek out more of this!"
"Mouthfeel is nice -- a little sticky and chewy, which you usually only find in higher ABV brews. Semi-dry finish that let's the hops shine. I dig it."
""
""
"Overall first sips had me quite intrigued, but the more I drank it, the better it improved. The visual character of this reminds me of Lunch, but the flavor profile of course different. I am such a sucker for a good amber, and this one is it."
""
""
""
""
"Been looking forward to finally trying some modern times after hearing good things about them. This one has really turned me off though. Pours way too light. Smell is old hops and to be honest, a litte bit like fart. Taste is pretty much like aroma with stale cardboard. Hopefully I just had a bad can cause this is horrid."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first modern times beer. This is quite solid. Bonus points for great craft beer in cans!!!! Huge dank hop presence in this amber ale with a great mouthfeel."

"O: Great beer, it's smooth and easy going. Great non cloying amber with a fair amount of hops - but not overdone or underdone... just right. Session-able would be an understatement."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
"A very good beer and my first from Modern Times. I look forward to trying some more in the coming weeks."
""
""
"I'm new to the craft brew scene and have been an IPA junky in my short career. I'm an aroma guy first so the first thing I look for is a solid nose. Blazing World NAILED it! Taste is clean yet flavorful. Something I will make sure and keep stocked in my fridge for my daily consumption."
""
"First beer from this brewery- this was quite excellent. Sort of like a Nugget Nectar lite."
""
""
""

"O: Little unimpressed with the color but everything else is phenomenal in this beer, must try if you can get your hands on it!"

""

"O: Nicely balanced and I could definitely enjoy a couple of these."
""
"Overall: I feel the Nelson hop needs to be used very judiciously due to it strong flavor profile. Modern Times has done so here. This is a very well balanced, well hopped red amber that I would love to have again. Loved this one."
""
"O: I think this easily go to the top of my top Amber Ale beers. A lot of hop flavor and aroma and not all that tongue coating caramel."
""
""
""
"O: Its a great IPA.  One of the best"
""
""
""
"If you're looking for a solid beer to grill to, sit around the pool, or watch a ball game, this will satisfy without putting you on your caboose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Super impressed with this one. Apparently a ""hoppy-dank amber"" lies somewhere between a double IPA and an imperial red in taste and mouthfeel (though without the higher ABV)."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Extremely flavorful, sesionable and uniquely flavored. Modern Times was a great find in San Diego and I would recommend a trip if you are in the area. Not a bad beer in their lineup."

"Notes: I was not overly impressed. My wife just said ""It tastes like it's trying to be two different beers at once. I wish I were just drinking one of them."""
"Sold in cans."
"This beer is nearly a Pale Ale. It'd be a phenomenal Pale, but is a bit to much in flavor for an Amber. It's a solid and unique Amber which I'd definitely recommend."
"Can from trade. Big thanks for my first Modern Times brew. Pours a dark orange, slightly hazy. White one finger head on top that lingers for a good while. Big time pine and resin on the aroma, grapefruit, sweet malts. Awesome hop presence here. Flavor is lots of bitter pine with a sweet finish and lingering citrus and pine on the palate. Nice and dank with excellent integration of both the bitter hops and sweet caramel malts. Resinous medium mouthfeel with a dry bitter finish and medium high carbonation. A very nice brew."
"Overall an excellent beer that I could see having a few of. Big thanks to Jay (BeerXKing) for sending this as an extra."
""
""

"Poured from chilled can into tasting glasses. Copper colored, dark pale ale-ish in color with chill haze present. Very fragrant nose, scents of pine, pink grapefruit and tropical fruits; papaya. Taste follows nose with pungent hop flavor dominating. Musky fruit dominates taste as well! Passion fruit, papaya, grapefruit pith, toasty malts in the backbone. Very dry and astringent mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Very good, very interesting beer that is unique in that it has the hop profile of an IPA with the toasted/caramel grain aspects of an amber, while being very dry."
"16oz can. Pours a semi hazy dark amber color with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is dank hops with some caramel and toasted malts. Some sweet citrus notes as well. The taste is the doughy and caramel malts up front followed by the dank hops. Some light pine. I expected more hops and less malt flavor from the aroma but its still solid. Does a pretty good job juggling the malt and hops. Lots of carbonation with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Overall, a really good hoppy Amber worth seeking out."

"Got in a trade with BeerBaron666. 16 ounce can into tulip glass; no canning date, but should be pretty fresh. Pours lightly hazy deep orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of dank citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, floral, grass, caramel, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Very unique and surprising experience. I'm quickly learning the Nelson is one of my favorite hops. Looks kinda ugly, but it smells amazing and tastes great. Reminds me of a toned down version of the Sucks. Very good."
"16oz can purchased from Whole Foods Hillcrest for $9.99 a four pack. Amber color, good appearance, good head. Aroma was malts, touch of fruity hops and then something I wasn't sure of until I tasted it. Flavor was buttery like diacetyl, malts, notch hoppiness because I was so distracted by the butter. I'dije to try this again but I'm super sensitive to diacetyl and I hate it."
""
""
"O - This beer is immediately one of my favorites. This is has something for everyone in this beer. It's light, crisp, drinkable, citrus, bitter, pine, dank, and more. I can't say enough good things about this beer. There's something for everyone. I wish Modern Times fused this with Fortunate Island. Wow, that would be amazing, The Simcoe and the Citra would be an instant hit! PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE LISTING MODERN TIMES, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!"
""
""
"o: pretty good. its a little hoppier than i'm used to from am amber, but: 1)its from San Diego what did i expect 2) it does say hoppy amber on the can. this is a really good beer to drink while watching a game and not wanting to focus on the beer. in the can is great, its portable. i'd say its a nice session beer, but its at 6.8% so be careful. still, a little hoppier than i would have liked"
"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, grapefruit juice, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with solid aromas but the hops come through much better in the taste in my opinion."
""
""
""
"The taste is hops with a good malt base. Pine and cantaloupe are quickly identified. There's toffee crisp, a kiss of tangerine, all while the beer shows little bitterness and has a cleanliness to it. Just the squeeze of the hops. Beer is medium bodied and smooth, which helps make this beer a joy to drink. Certainly different from Calico Amber Ale and Hophead Red,which are already two well-made ambers produced in San Diego."

"smell is absolutely divine. sweet, yet hoppy; almost like a candy-coated hop bud.... but not so bitter. taste is wonderfully filling and full. sweet with a small bitterness to it; I cant say where they get the 85 IBUs from, because i'm not getting it.... white soapiness drools down the sides. the brew is not oily, nor sticky. it's not bitter, and not overly sweet. a slight bit of caramel, maybe, but this is an almost perfect concoction. and at 6.8%, this is quite an accomplishment! this is nectar!! perfect mix of hops and malts! this is one for the books!"
"Overall- this is a solid brew through and through. the light body makes it sessionable and the aroma kicks you in the face! the abv is just right and hidden well for this type of beer. Modern times does it again."
"The Blazing World has a touch of bizzaro world, not a straight forward hoppy amber at all, the mosaic hops lead you on a taste trip to all corners of the the IPA range except to the tropical paradise. The vinous, ESB notes were a bit bothersome but easy to ignore. Balanced and clean, the complexity of this beer made me down it a bit faster than I normally would."
""

""

"O - Very drinkable amber, that starts off as an IPA and drifts more towards the amber side of life."
"This one's different than previous experience. Less hop presence and more of a buttery body that's kinda off-putting. I believe I just have an old can. Wish MT would date their cans in the near future."
""
""
""
"D: This is a nicely balanced and very sessionable Amber. There is a good mix of malt and hop flavor with a smoothened overall bitterness. The hop flavors I found to be fairly on the subtle side making this nothing particularly stand out for me. Well crafted but just a bit lack luster. Didn’t live up to the dank hype."
""
"O - I expected a lot more intense hop experience here, given the claims on the can. I get mostly piney notes and a sticky resiny feel. Malt is more in the forefront and rather earthy overall. Well balanced beer...wish the hops stood out as much as the can claims they should."
"O: Awesome Brew! First time drinking Modern Times and i must say i am impressed! The only real gripe I have is it is a bit thin on the mouthfeel at first but it definitely makes up for it in its hop profile! Best compared to a more balanced-amber version of Sculpin. They share a pretty similar hope profile and i must admit i might like this more. If you are a fan of Sculpin you have to check this one out. Definitely impressed and made MT's nitch in the SD beer scene pretty solid!"
""
""
"Mosaic and simcoe seem the most prominent to me, especially mid palate and in the finish. Not really discerning the Nelson hops here, but nevertheless a pleasant tasting and easy drinking Amber. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a brilliantly clear dark golden color with a smallish off white head that persists for a little bit. Lots of citrus and pine in the aroma, grapefruit and resinous dankness backed up by a hint of bready caramel. The flavor is lots of juicy hops with some mineral and earthy edges. Citrus and pine flavor are a bit lighter than the aroma suggested. Light bready malt sweetness with a moderate stinging bitterness that lingers long into the finish. Light alcohol sensation, medium body with moderate carbonation. some rough edges here, but I certainly had no trouble finishing 16oz of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber color with a medium white head that goes down quickly. Scent is very hop-forward. Not necessarily bitter hops, but strong-scented fruity hops with lovely malt aromas. The aromas is more hop forward than malty, and I love that from an Amber Ale. Taste is...WOW...amazing. I havent been this blown away from an Amber Ale since I had Nugget Nectar for the first time. It's hilarious that Fat Tire even sits in the same category as this beer. Tons of Nelson hops in the flavor. I pick up a bit of Simcoe, but I'm still not all that familiar with Mosaic hops. The malt profile is subdued compared to the hops, which I love. Drinkability is VERY high. Mouthfeel could be a bit more carbonated. Overall, I really look forward to what these guys bring in the future. This is one of the best American Amber Ales I have ever had...hands down."
"Wow, I'm just really digging this from the can. The aroma is not nearly as good as from tap at the brewery, but the taste is a little better, imo. Out of the can, the dankness of the hops is a little muted in a much more drinkable way. It was pretty in your face on tap, so seems counter-intuitive to like the can better, but there's more synergy there (and the batches coulda been quite a bit different, too). So drinkable. One of my favorite new hoppy reds at this point. An everyday hoppy red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Medium-bodied, oily slick. More carbonation than it appeared."
"Huuuge aroma on this - which was the first thing that really jumped out at me. This was still the first batch, so the recipe was being tweaked - but the nelson hops really stood out in a huge way. A lot of promised for this one...can't wait to try it canned..."
