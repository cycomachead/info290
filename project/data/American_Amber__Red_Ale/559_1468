2.77,-28.1,3.5,3.25,2.5,2.75,2.5,"Pours a light amber hue with a white head that recedes to a ring.  Aroma of alcohol and stale grains.  The taste has faded caramel, lemon juice, and faint bitterness.  Not the best tasting beer for style fairly abrasive actually.  Has an oxidized note of sherry.  Hop flavor helps somewhat.  Light bodied, cardboard dry and not moreish in the slightest.  Overall, not too good.","Stinkypuss","Apr 02, 2015"

The liquid is a noticeably dark amber, red base which leans more towards a bright brown than orange, very clear but as “opaque” as this style of beer can get, hardly any bubbles visible at all. Chocolate and caramel get the nose started, like a German chocolate cake, stiffens with grains, quinine and pine sap, with a brush of white grapefruit you’d almost start thinking it is a weird sort of IPA, the golden raisin, peach, yellow apple, fig fruit subdued, ends with a sort of dampened campfire smokiness. Medium-bodied, creamy attack, plush and soft, not much prickle in the carbonation. Lots of coconut oil, cocoa and cola bean through the attack but not that sweet. Something like sweet cigar wrapper next to the metallic earth, fallen wood and hops, the white grapefruit and orange citrus comes and goes but bites when it is there. As in the nose, the peach, apricot, raisin fruit waits until the end to begin to strut. Displays good personality and switches things up frequently enough to keep you interested.","farrago","Mar 23, 2014"

APPEARANCE: intimidating dark amber body; thick, creamy, beige two-finger head that proudly sits a good duration... AROMA: beautiful balance of caramel malts and bright West Coat hops; low citrus, more aromatic and flowery...PALATE: good beer/head mix in the sip, with the creamy viscosity rounding full-bodied impact...TASTE: a BIG pale ale, as old and well-intentioned as the 18th amendment itself; big pine cone bite, warm and malty late... OVERALL: I came back to this beer a decade after I introduced it at a house party (it was wildly successful that afternoon)--and after taking it to a poker night, I found a similarly positive reaction; strong, demanding pale ale that gently shakes the teeth and smooth out the throat; the caramel especially sweetens the end...","dacrza1","Mar 22, 2014"

3.85,0,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured a reddish-brown body with decent head and lace. A minimal amount of caramel malt sweetness balances with a large dose of citric hops in the aroma and this repeats itself in the beer. Light to medium bodied, smooth, the beer is rather simple and there isn't too much going on but what is happening is good. Well-balanced sweet and bready malts with citric hops give the beer a hoppy and yet also malty taste and it finishes a little dry and bitter from malts and hops.","clayrock81","Mar 17, 2014"

Nothing overly distinctive about the nose - toasted malt-forward with some piny/citrusy hops. Taste consistent with nose, but there is also a distinct metallic flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a trace of acidity. Overall, a pretty lackluster amber. Not sure if it's just an off bottle, past its prime or just subpar.

Scents of lemon juice, lemon zest, sweet citrus and orange. A very citrus forward aroma, dominated a bit more by the sweeter aromas than the lemon. Very good though. Flavor is extremely hop forward, though the actual bitterness level of the hops is low. The hop profile is floral, citrus pith, grapefruit pith and pine resin, balanced by faint hints of toasted and grainy malt. The finish is dry and bitter. Very good for a nice, hop forward amber, with hints of malt. I liked it. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, a smooth feel and a drying finish. A good session ale mouthfeel, despite the ABV. Overall this is a good, hop forward amber ale. Its got a nice citrusy aroma and a good hop profile, with just enough malt to keep it from being too bitter. I enjoyed it a lot and would drink it again.","Auraan","Dec 02, 2013"

From the recent reviews I'm seeing I may not try this one again since a lot of people seem displeased with some of the possible recipe changes. I suppose I should be glad I had it a while ago then I guess. The beer poured out as a nice looking amber color with a pretty decent head on top too. The smell of the beer was a little on the light side, there were some hop aromas and sweet malts in the mix also. The taste was pretty nicely balanced between the hops and the malts. The mouthfeel was drinkable and overall I thought it was a pretty good brew.","Knapp85","Sep 17, 2011"

Pleasant little hop bitterness in the end with a wonderful, creamy mouthfeel to finish things out. Very drinkable and I'd imagine this would appeal to a wide audience. I was expecting more hops with this, but I'm not sure if maybe this bottle wasn't on the shelf and the hops have faded a bit. No freshness date so I don't know when it was actually brewed.

I'd be interested in trying it when I knew it to be fresh, as I'd like to see if there's a more pronounced hop presence than I experienced. I think that would really throw this one over the top.

It is easy to expect an old-world type beer because of the name, but this proves to be a current-style Amber Ale, with only an old-school name. The beer pours a more-viscous-than-normal pint with tan head formation, laces well and retains well. Dark amber / ruby in color takes on the look of a winter warmer. Aromas of strong hops and malts swirl together, delivering caramel barley notes and citrus / pine character from the hops. Estery and spicy compliment the heavier malts and sharp hop flavor. A touch of toast, roasted grain, and chesnut flavors help to round out the sweetness. The beer feels heavy against the toung with more residual sweetness than needed, but not cloying. Finishes with a heavy malt / hop lingering. Good beer, but better attenuation would really have helped the beer.","BEERchitect","Jun 30, 2008"

The beer brewed a beautiful amber red color with a nice thick head, and the aroma of the hops was quite intoxicating in and of itself. It had a very strong hoppy smell, like no other amber ale I've had. It reminded me of a pale ale, or even an IPA. This was a pleasant surprise, I guess you could say. The taste was decent, but nothing spectacular. A very crisp, hoppy ale with little body. This was disappointing because the bottle claimed ""A boldly hopped amber ale that strikes a perfect balance between caramel maltiness and its aggressive hopping."" I definitely taste the maltiness, but it is anything but balanced (overpowered?) with the hoppiness. The lacing was nice and the beer finished well. If you are looking for an amber ale that drinks more like a mild IPA, then this is the beer for you.

Tea-like tannins with a lot of bittering hops and the definitive Cascade hop aroma make for a pretty good ale. It's thin, but righteously so.

The beer pours a clear, deep copper, with a feathery, airy head rising up, then sinking to a sheer film of foam and good, intricate lacing. The aroma is entirely honest and well-hopped. The flavor duplicates the aroma with a yeasty characteristic, and tasty bready malts. Citric hops are lightly sweet and tart, and very enjoyable. Despite the high hoppiness for the style, the malts are up to the challenge and the beer remains well balanced. The flavor is perhaps similar to some Rogue ales, yet the mouthfeel is much thinner and the beer is actually more drinkable. The beer tastes very fresh, almost unfinished, but thoroughly delightful. A slight staleness in the aftertaste is perhaps the only shortcoming; drinkability good. I'm not wholly on board with Speakeasy's gangster 'n' moll motif; it seems to me the '20s era of American Prohibition doesn't fully jibe with modern craft ale, particularly the well-hopped west coast variety; bootleg gin would be a closer match.

Most beers like this might start off a little malty, but then rage into this uncontrolable mosnter of hops. Which some people might like.

There is a nice hoppiness here, it is just not as dominant as I would like it to be, or as I remember it being.

4.83,25.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This is considered by Speak Easy to be an amber Ale. For sure it has a nice amber color and great fragrant hops to be noted. I was fortunate enough to get this beer in a mixed case of Speak Easy's beers, because I had had Big Daddy IPA, and enjoyed it and wanted to see what else they created. Well, this one won me over, and I think it is even more full bodied and full flavored than Big Daddy. I got the case about two months ago, and still have one left in the fridge. I do not know what I am saving it for, but I do know it is not easy to find where I live. Any one who loves a nice hoppy beer should give this amber a try!","gueuzegeek","Aug 13, 2003"
4.13,7.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"It has a slight oily feel to it but this does not hamper its mouthfeel or drinkability. It is a very complex ale. I am sure when I have another one I will notice something that I missed from this one. I really enjoyed this ale.","Rumrunner","Jul 26, 2003"

4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This beer exhitibits a glowing scarlet red color that is very inviting. A small and creamy light brown head coats the glass nicely as I drink. There is a nice blend of agressive citric and piney hops and caramel malts on the nose. It's pretty cool. Upon tasting, I discover that this is one of the most hopped up amber ales I've tried. I'd almost say it's like an IPA, but I don't think the bitterness is high enough, and moreso, the underlying caramel malt backbone makes its presence known. The hops seem west coast all the way. Piney. Rind-like. And citric. A bit of a twist for an amber, but pretty tasty. This is a hophead's wetdream for an amber ale.","Bighuge","May 30, 2003"
4.66,21,5,4,5,4,5,"Pours a gorgeous deep reddish amber with a long-lasting light tan head. Mouthfeel is medium-to-thin in body with a pleasant creaminess to it. Aroma consists of piney citrus and malt. Prohibition ale starts off with that piney citrus punch which leads to the creamy caramel malt middle. Biscuity finish that has a mouth-puckering finale. The underlying caramel malt background plays second fiddle to the predominant hop bitterness experienced and enjoyed throughout. This beer really seems more like an IPA than a traditional amber. Regardless, it's superbly crafted.","Winter","May 19, 2003"
4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Courtesy of Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. This beer was certainly a pleasant surprise. Usually these gimmicky-type bottles house awful beers. Pours a thorough amber color with a medium thin and quickly dissipating light beige head. Very thin lacing. Assertive floral hops aroma. Excellent balance of hops and malt in the flavor. Nice, clean finish is bitter and a little spicy. Very good.","Dogbrick","Mar 18, 2003"
3.91,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The hoppiest Amber Ale I have ever sampled. Sappy green hops engulf the almost imperceptable biscuit malts. While a fabulous brew, this beer has taken a single step too far, leaving behind the essense of its style. A more pronounced maltiness should be expected in an Amber Ale.","Jordan","Jan 01, 2003"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice deep clear orange/copper reddish color. The head was a light tan color. Carbonation is a bit high. On the nose the aroma was hoppy, caramel malts, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and fruity esters. On the palate the flavor were hoppy, nice bitterness, slight biscuit hints, caramel malts, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and fruity esters, herbs, slight spicy. Good balance in this brew....","WilliamPhilaPa","Dec 20, 2002"
3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Clear, amber, reticent white head. Exceptionally floral hoppy aroma - some citrus notes. Body is all floral hops, which is something that seems to be a Speakeasy trait. Fairly one-dimensional, but better than the Untouchable, I think. There are always better things out there, though.","the42ndtourist","Dec 13, 2002"
4.13,7.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Hoppy grapefruit aroma, beautiful glowing clear copper-red color, citrusy hoppy flavor, nice thick creamy mouthfeel reminds me alot of Three Floyds Pale Ale, very tasty and easy drinking. I can't get enough, I wish I could get Speakeasy in St. Louis.","maxpower","Dec 13, 2002"
3.38,-12.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"It poured a hazy reddish copper with little to no foam. The smell was of citrus and a strong aroma of hop's. The taste was of citrus and hop's with a big bite of bitterness for me. This beer had to much bitterness on the palate. The bitterness lingers for quit a while after drinking the brew. It was just OK, I won't buy it again.","BeerManDan","Dec 06, 2002"
3.88,0.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A much better beer than the Untouchable Pale Ale, and as I purchased both for the same price, it would be my first choice if I was deciding between the two!","TheLongBeachBum","Dec 03, 2002"
4.3,11.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A bright red/red orange body is topped by a mountain top like just-off-white head. Aroma is mainly hops, both floral and citric. A bit atypical of a red ale. Taste has a good strong malt base, but a nice leavening and lingering hop signature is also there, but not overpowering. Red/amber ales are often fairly basic, but this one has some character to it.","RonfromJersey","Nov 09, 2002"
4.16,8.1,5,4,4,4,4.5,"A nice amber color with a thick tan head.  Lace was thick and copious.  A strong hop aroma wafted out of the glass, the finish though was more malt prevalent (caramel) I found this very interesting that the hops were not as stong on the finish as the aroma suggested they might.  I'm not complaining cause this was and is a very smooth drinkable quality ale. One I will try to keep around from now on.","Mark","Oct 13, 2002"
4.17,8.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Crystal clear with a  very nice color - truly reddish with copper highlights; like a rich oiled mahogany. The beautiful body is topped by a foamy light-tan colored head that holds very well and leaves some really good lace. The aroma is bold: full of bright, citrusy, Pacific Northwest hops and some fruitiness; well-backed by a dark caramel maltiness. The body is medium light and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. The flavors starts with a bold hoppiness, then wrestles across the tongue with some gentle caramel malt, and eventually fades smoothly into a gently lingering malty & hoppy finish. At first I felt the mouthfeel could have been fuller, but with further thought I feel that the limited body helps to keep the flavors from becoming too full, and allows for a smooth finish without the hops getting hung-up in the throat. A very well done beer that probably deserves more recognition than it gets.","NeroFiddled","Sep 02, 2002"
