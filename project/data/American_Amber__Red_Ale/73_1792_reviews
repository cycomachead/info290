"This is an okay brew, nothing special, nothing fantastic."

"Bottle pour. Interesting clear orange/brown color with a head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma has strong caramel and biscuit notes with citrus hop as well. Sweet nutty flavors up front with earthy, resinous, and caramel elements. Palate includes creamy textures, with a little fizz and a medium body."

"Nosferatu has long been one of my favourite seasonals. Many a Halloween it has sucked my wallet dry. But so far as I'm concerned this hearty combination of sweet malt and multifaceted hops is a gustatory masterpiece. The fact that it's so irresistibly drinkable even at 8% alcohol tells you something about just how much flavour it offers. Here's hoping this fall release is eternal."

"Pours a rich copper color with a thin head that trails the glass. The smell was a little boozy but had great smells of malt and a little bit of pine from the hops. The taste was a bit more mellow than I thought it would be considering the smell but still very nice. The taste had toasted malts with some hops, and then a bit of burn on the end. I liked it quite a lot."

"A little fruit cake on the nose joined by minty hops, spicy malt, fresh grain.  Pours brilliant garnet tinted amber under a 2” very light tan tinted finely bubbled off-white persistent foam cap that marks each drink with a fine line. Provides a rich spicy malt palate with a hint of anise, a does of bread crust and a well rounded, drying bitter finish. Creamy with a medium body and medium carbonation."

"o; An enjoyable red, probably the best of this style I have had, perhaps with more hop presence when fresh but nicely balanced now.  Would buy more if GL was available in my state."

"O: a nice, bold, hoppy red ale... i would love to see them ditch the Cascade in favor of a British hop, give it some character... I'll have to jump on a bottle as soon as it's released next time"

"Pours a very deep amber with a small light brown head, dissipates quickly. A little bit of light lacing around the edges. A little bit murky. Aroma is citrusy with sweet caramel malts, and a tiny bit of pine. Reminds me of a very subtle barleywine, minus the booziness. Not quite what you'd expect from a Red. Taste is a little subdued....very lightly toasted malts, with some sweet caramel. A bit of pine. As it warms, the sweet caramel comes through a bit more, and bitterness starts to linger on the tongue. This one is thin, but starts to get a sticky resinous as it warms. Pretty easy to put down for a 8%er. Overall one of the more tasty red ales you'll find."

"Pours a hazy amber with a medium beige head with light lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, yeast and fruity notes. Taste is a strong caramel malt and toffee flavor, yeast with a good dose of earthy hops for balance on the end. A medium body, smooth mouth feel with good carbonation. The finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity, some toffee notes and earthy hops bitterness. This brew goes down smooth considering the bitterness and alcohol. Overall a very good tasty brew."

"Overall (4): Although good, nothing extraordinary about this one. I do feel GL produce some of the better American interpretations of German beers however. I enjoy just about every beer put out by these guys, but this is far from my favorites from them."

"Poured from 12 oz bottle into my tulip. Wicked, deep red hue... very little head, small bubbles around glass... tempting, very tempting. Upfront bitterness on the nose, some crisp, malty notes, but rather light aroma overall. This might be the weakest area of this excellent brew. The flavor made up for the weak nose... delicious malt presence with a bit of a bite (I would swear there was bit of rye in this), and a nice, balanced bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, with a nice, clean finish. Crisp and refreshing overall. My new favorite fall beer, different. Get some, get some now, and get some fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent brew. Initial toast and strong caramel malt balanced beautifully with a nice floral hop character. Begins to open up upon warming and takes on increased roastiness, almost nutty. Fall in a glass to me."
"The lack of lacing is disappointing, but the balance between malt and hops makes this a bearable red ale – it starts off with malt flavor and ends with hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish amber with a slight khaki head. Aroma is a thick caramel and toast  with some earthiness and orange zest mixed in. Flavor follows suit with the flavor but hits heavier in both the malts and hops. Moderate bitterness to this thing but the sweetness from the malts keep the hops in check. A fuller mouthfeel. Overall, a very solid beer from GL here. Glad I went with the 4 pack over just a single, though not sure I can drink more than one of these in a night."
""
""
"Tastes great in the mouth. Caramel malt, a little roastiness, and citrus and floral hops. Has a lingering pithy bitterness that isn't pleasing to my palate. Definitely better as it warms. Overall an outstanding beer."
""
"Excellent"
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this one to be really enjoyable - a very nice hoppy red/amber. Alcohol is relatively well hidden and it drinks much easier than the 8% ABV that it is."

"This my favorite beer from a brewery stocked with world class beers."
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- medium full bodied, well carbonated. I like this beer but like many from Great Lakes it's not a knockout. Worth getting for sure though."
"Cooler summer day in the Mid-Atlantic and this is a good beer to enjoy today."

"Flavor is rich and malty, with plenty of toasty grains and a heavy body that typifies such a heavy beer alcohol-wise. Tangy bitter touch at the finish. Overall, a surprisingly solid beer for it's age, and quite a big brew."

"Well balanced and enjoyable beer."
""
"did like this, but it reminded me of tomato juice and/or blood. still it was clean, sweetly malty, had some bready/cakey notes, dark cherries, etc. just had some strange notes to it. can't award the A for my own taste, but being put together its respectable. cant say i would buy it again"

"Mouthfeel: Easy drinking for an 8% alcohol beer."
""
"O: This beer has a rich mouthfeel and seems heavier and fuller in flavor compared to other beers in the style."
"Over all a very good balanced yet complex Imperial red that I would recommend you try."
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark read with short lived, creamy, off-white head. Aroma is of citrusy, herbal hops, caramel malt and ripe cherries and apples. Body is medium and crisp. Citrusy, herbal hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long and dry. Delicious, brew."
"Overall/Comments: On of my favorite GLBC beers and for good reason because Nosferatu is just a tremendously well done beer that is perfect for the fall season. It has a great flavor profile!! Try it if you get the chance!!"

"D/O: This is a malt-forward red ale that appears even bigger than its 8% ABV would suggest. It retains just enough American hops influence to keep it from being mistaken for an old ale. This beer promises to pair with food in versatile fashion, all while remaining assertive in the face of other strong flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent brew – worthy of a try."
""

"Great winter beer as the 8% warms the soul. Nothing really stands out to me specifically I think overall this is a well balanced offering from Bells definitely lives up to their reputation of making really good beers. Cheers!"

"Low C+"

"O - This is one of the best red ales I've ever had! For me, it's more complex and balanced that G'Knight and would pick this every time. I'm glad I have another!"
""
"The alcohol is hidden well in this one. That combined with the relatively light body makes for one dangerous and easy drinking imperial red."
""
""
""

"Overall - very nice imperial amber ale. This beer screams ""autumn"""
""
"Bottle from jbwimer. Dated 12/1/13, poured 11/20/13. Pours a deep red to amber color with a small cream colored ring of head. Aroma of sweet fruits, dirt, grass, caramel malts. Flavor follows with a grassy fruit flavor, massive malt bill, just a tinge of earthy hops, with a lingering bready malt on the palate. Slick mouthfeel, lowish carbonation. Very crisp pleasant finish, very easy drinking. Cannot believe this is 8%. Nothing especially complex in the flavors here, just a nicely crafted brew. Yum."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very fun and complex beer. Very smooth and easy drinking. Alcohol is well hidden."
"O - definitely a fall must-have. This beer is phenomenal and a favorite of mine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a lovely brick red. Scent is unremarkable but the taste is a wonderful balance of hops and malt. The hops provide the backbone here to the malt that is a bit of caramel and a touch of cinnamon. A beautiful, well-balanced, highly quaffable beverage. Perhaps the perfect fall beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A big, big imperial red. Heartily recommended. Bloody good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This should be the level to which other Halloween-themed beers aspire to-- there's no hokey pumpkin fetishism to be found, the flavors come from the beer and not from syrup or flavorants added later and it's as near to blood red as one can get."

"Warming from the first swallow, drying starts before that. Hops are noticeable but not overpowering. Others can reach IPA levels, fortunately this one doesn't."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rated down a bit from original review, but generally agree with point: I think I'd rate it decently higher without that last taste. It had a little more bitterness than an amber, which I liked and enjoyed until the end."
""
""
""
"Dark translucent amber color with medium, light cream colored head that diminishes after a few minutes into just a ring and messy lacing. Aroma is faint, but has nice amber malts and light fruity hop. Tons of flavor, but not too strong or overkill on anything. It's so balanced, the hops and malts work perfectly together. There's no alcohol flavor, medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. For an amber, it's got to be one of the best."
"This is so good. The color is beautiful. The biscuity, sweet smell is complemented with the bitter, piney taste. I will get this again."
"This didn't feel like a beer that was 8.00% ABV and only a hint of the alcohol could be felt in the initial taste of this. It's not often that a beer can be this complex and incredibly smooth at the same time but this fit the bill and on its own, paired with spicy foods, or as a dessert, this would be a great choice. It never warmed me but it never felt weak either and it's not often I find an offering that combines chocolate and fruit flavors so well, without being dark and powerful. Well worth enjoying even though Halloween has passed by for the year!"
"A good imperial, though for those into pine and a really stiff bitterness."
""
""
""
"well, i was really looking forward to trying this one as my first great lakes beer - mainly because nosferatu is one of my favorite characters from old sci-fi horror stuff.. the beer, well, it was sub par.. not bad, but not as mind blowing as i heard it was.. as far as having this be my first great lakes brew, i'll give them another shot - i hear the ipa's and stouts are good so i'll shoot for those next. overall, not a terrible beer but nothing out of the ordinary either.. at least it's got a bad ass label!"

"O - Compares well with G-Knight from Oskar or the best from Stone (oaked arrogant bastard). A must try ."
""
"Overall: A really good strong ale. The sweetness brings you in and the hop knock you out. Great Lakes always bring great beer and this one is no exception."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: the attributes of an imperial red are there and remarkable; malts could come off to others as more to be desired, but overall--strong, balanced, and very drinkable."
"A solid, hoppy red ale. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a beautiful looking beer and it has some interesting scents."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Good, simple flavor. Decent hop bitterness with a good sweet caramel and toasted toffee flavor. Hints of lemon come through at the end. Flavor is a little disproportionate in my opinion, aging for another month or two may improve the balance"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a seriously tasty beer. I can see why it's perfect for the fall months; it fits my seasonal taste buds flawlessly. I personally greatly dislike red ales, but I somehow find myself trying a new one every now and then. This one puts all the others to shame. Definitely a great October beer."
"Great Lakes has made a terrific beer here. I love the rich malt character of this. The hop resin coats the palate and brings out the toasty malt and the sweetness perfectly."

""
""

""

"Pours a dark ruby amber with a nice head and lacing. Nice nose of caramel malt with a touch of noble hops. An excellent ale that I wish was available all year. Very well balanced with a medium mouthfeel that is also slick. Well carbonated. This is an example of how to properly hop a beer. The hop flavor is pronounced but without a harsh bitterness against a full caramel background. The taste lingers of fresh hop resin. Increase the malt bill a bit and this becomes a Gold Medal exceptional ale. While medium bodied with a slick mouthfeel, the finish is crisp from the carbonation leaving you with a slightly sweet aftertaste over a noble hop bitterness with a touch of smoke."
""
""
"Great Lakes Nosferatu ---4/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. this is the best GLBC beer i have had so far, in front of the lake erie monster and the EF Porter (i have not been lucky enough to try Alchemy hour yet). To me this could be classified as a Red IPA. The hopiness is very prominent. The flavor as very complex. This has been compared to Stone's Arrogant bastard. To me it is a more refined version, but to the keen taster i believe you will find more complexity and flavors in this one."
""
""
""
"Overall - Nothing too special but nice and enjoyable to have with a meal"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A must try for the fan of hoppy red's. Well done, per usual for GLBC."
""
"Clean tasting, semi-complex and refreshing brew. You know what, screw pumpkin beers.. This is probably going to be one of the beers I look forward to every fall. It's very enjoyable in that its not difficult to appreciate the nuances of this beer. Trade-off of course is that its not über complex, but you know what, fuck it. I want to enjoy my damn beer, and this one makes it very easy to enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am a huge fan of this beer. It's balanced with a unique complexity. It really represents what makes GLBC such a solid choice."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is one of the reasons that I fell in love with craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark amber with a thick slightly dark khaki head. GL's beers always look fantastic. Very earthy nose, fresh oranges, grass, dirty grapefruits. The nose fits the style well. The taste has the same earthy tone. Lots of bitter hops at the front of the mouth. Mid palate it's a bit sweeter with some sweet orange cream. Very floral finish with lots of wild flowers. Mouthfeel is mild to medium bodied. ABV is slightly noticeable. I'm not a huge fan of ambers, but this is trying to win me over. GL makes some incredible beers and as far as style goes this fits perfectly."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is copper hued with an off-white head. Ample lacing coats the walls of the glass. The aroma offers a sufficient malt bill, pine, hops. A healthy bitterness exists throughout with a mild, bready sweetness. A tasty beer and solid example of the style."
""
""
"Overall, a very well-balanced and drinkable imperial red. Even a hophead like me can't drink Nugget Nectar all the time; sometimes you want a beer that wants to please your tongue instead of stab it to death."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is absolutely worth trying. It's not Great Lakes' best offering, but it tastes great and makes for a good sipper or dessert beer."
"Overall glad I waited for a fresh bottle to review. The hop is much more pronounced and it compensates for the serious malt bill. Very tasty and certainly worth picking up."
"I really, really like this one. A soft, lovely smell belied by an assertive hoppiness. I love how that spooky apparition bites ;)"
""
""
""
"I haven't drank this in 6 years or so. The first time I did, I was not all about ""heavy"" craft beers, preferring to stick with light American lagers and the occasional dortmunder. I'm glad I came back to visit this one, because it is solid."
""
""

"Serving type: bottle"

"O: Not my favorite beer, but neither is it my favorite style. It's quite well made though - there are definitely others out there who will enjoy it more than I did."

"Drinkabilty - I love this beer, loads of flavor, lots of multiple flavors. Balanced, has a great mix of west coast ipa flavors and Belgium spices mixed with some rye and great lakes unique twist of ingredients to create a truly great beer. This has to be my favorite release by them, world class and so good to drink and enjoy for the month of September."

"Pour was amber red with a nice cap of foam and great lace. Smell was biscuits with a heap of earthy rye spice, some minor citrus elements. Layered. Similarly the taste was complex with layers earthy spice, rye, citrus pith, bitterness, dark fruit, ensconced in a toasty biscuit package. Medium velvety body. Drinks heavier than it really is. Nice ale, was enjoyable."

"D: This was reminiscent of Flying Mouflan, with similar scent and taste, which is a good thing. The body was decent, but the finish was a bit rough. Age may help mellow. Fresh was solid, but not quite mind blowing."

""
""
""

"Judging from the Great Lakes website, it seems like this is somewhere around 5 months old and it holds up well. It says 90 day shelf life, hopefully I can get some fresh in September 2013 and re-review it but I will leave this up as I consider it a pretty positive review. This beer brings it all, a nice hop profile (even after months), big malts and a good yeast influence. Balanced and an easy drinker for 8%."

"O - Overall not a bad beer, just perhaps not as fresh. Really kind of muddled."
""
"I've been wanting to try this one for a while now, and I'm glad I finally did. Wonderful flavors all around. I've heard this one compared to Arrogant Bastard often. Is it better? Tough call. I think I'll give the edge to AB, because of it's abrasive, yet controlled hop profile and pronounced bitterness while remaining so malty and drinkable. But Nosferatu is still a damn good beer that I wouldn't pass up if given the chance to have again."

""
""
"One of my favorite seasonal beers."
""
""
""

"Overall: To me this beer embodies fall. Nothing beats it on a cool autumn day. It doesn't punch you in the face with hops like some of the newer imperial reds coming out (Pipeworks Blood of the Unicorn and Bells This One Goes to 11 come to mind), but I prefer this beer to those due to its malt profile and impeccable balance."
""
""
""
""
"This abides by German purity law, yet somehow has a slightly sprucy flavor to it (chinook hops?). Great taste and mouthfeel make it a worthwhile pour. Tends to linger pleasantly on the palate, so savoring it makes the experience better. Gotta love the label artwork."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) This is a very good imperial red... It really comes down to what you enjoy most, and I would have preferred this to have more of a tropical fruit/citrus hop presence, kind of like a Lucky 13 or Brian Boru. Glad I finally gave it a try, and have no regrets."
""
""
"O: I look forward to this Strong warming beer every year with it's solid bitterness and decent hops flavor and aroma it never disappoints."
""
""
""
""

"Overall this was a miss for me. For how much I love great lakes lagers and darker beers, I have found their IPA line-up to be quite underwhelming. There is too much alcohol, brash hops and a thin mouthfeel which just doesn't work for me. As a big fan of Amber Ales (imperial or generic), I cannot recommend this."

"O: Sweet, spicy, then dry, Nosferatu is a mellow gem. It gets better as it warms, smoother and balanced despite the heavy hop presence. A must try and one of those few beers I would buy on a regular basis."

"Single finger head with decent retention and excellent lacing on a hazy copper body. Aroma of syrup, caramel malts, resins but overall mild. Flavors are pretty tough to handle at first. Very boozy and tart/sharp. Mosty mollases caramel, red apple, fig and tart grapefruit. Medium body and moderate carbonation. This one may have been infected. A little too funky. Also the booze were hard to get used to verging into barleywine realm."
"Overall this is one of the better red ales that I have had and I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes a malt forward IPA."
""
"This is my favorite red ale."
""

"O: Not a bad beer. Has some good qualities, but overall not super exciting. I wouldn't mind drinking one again, but I probable wouldn't seek it out."

"Weathered copper orange on color with a hazy viscous appearance. Poured with a short off-white foam that slowly reduces to a wispy cap that leaves random sticky lacings on the glass. Malty caramel aroma is prominent with sweet candied apples, citrus orange, earthy pine aromas, and a touch of booziness beneath. Thick, grainy feel that supresses the carbonation a bit. Caramel and toasted malt flavors up front with ripe apple sweetness followed by tangy citrus hop flavors through the middle that slowly evolve into a combination of resinous pine hop bitterness and boozy heat at the finish."
""

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the smoothness of flavoring, and the beautifully creamy feel. The flavoring showed a nice depth to the malts in the way of sweetness, while the hops came in for a nice balance. They, too, were sweeter, giving an ultimate impression of a sweeter beer, all around, to the drinker. The feel is really what did it for us. While the flavoring was all there, the mouth was so creamy and delicate, with such glorious creaminess and frothiness, we were left coming back for more and more."
""
""
""
"Overall - There is some really nice complexity and balance going on here - A very interesting and flavorful imperial red, one that I would definitely recommend and try again."

"O - I understand why this is classified int he somewhat ambiguous style of american strong ale. The flavors are very unique with a combination of roasty, hoppy, and nutty. This is a perfect fall brew in my opinion. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I heard some good things about this beer so I went ahead and bought a bottle. Wish I would have sooner. A well-rounded full-flavored brew with a lot of things to like about it. Would I drink it again? Yep."
""
""
"O- this one packs a lunch but is well balanced, the malts are sweet, but the hops provide just enough to balance it our. This is definitely a sipping beer and a good selection for a cold night."
""
""
" I liked this beer a lot, my only complaint is also my greatest compliment. This beer is very simple. Hop bitterness and sweet malt. It is deliciously simple and that is probably its only fault!"
""
""
""
"O: Not an overwhelmingly amazing beer, but solid on all fronts, and featuring the signature Great Lakes maltiness, which is one of my favorite tastes in any beer. Worth picking up."
"As advertised, this beer has tons of character and is great for a cool autumn night."

"Overall: Pretty good offering. Not a standout but enjoyable at the same time."
""
"O - I've had this beer very fresh, and 2 moths past the best buy date. The hops completely fade making this an entirely different style of beer from an Imperial Ale. Fresh it is very hoppy, but aged it is a strong/old ale type beer. I adore this beer when it is fresh and look forward to drinking it every fall. It is so delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid strong ale. I would have preferred a bit more dark fruit and malt and slightly less hops, but still really good."
""
""
""
""
"but this was a visual treat. fix the finish and i would have rated this higher."
""
"O- This is a great beer, its like a middle of the country take on Arrogant Bastard. I may age one or 2 to see what happens but its great fresh."
"Deep, ruby red color with a thick, fluffy head on top, quickly dwindling to a bubbly covering. Heavy, oily hop aroma...sweet citrus, dark fruit, spice, bread, leafiness, and pine. Smooth, piney Simcoe, grapefruit, light pepperiness, caramel, biscuit, and a little brown sugar. A tasty blend of flavors creates a lovely balance. Medium body, not too heavy on the tongue, creamy, solid bitterness. Very nice..."

"Overall, a very impressive beer from Great Lakes. The malt and hops compliment each other perfectly and the beer is surprisingly drinkable for 8%. A really great beer for fall."

"O- Great name and great artwork. Oh yeah and a great beer as well, very impressive balance and the fruit and cherry on top of this make this a fall favorite for me"
""
""
"Overall – This is one tasty Imperial IPA. A great blend of hop, malt and sweet with fantastic flavor transitions and an excellent feel."
""
""
""
""
"The appearance, nose and mouthfeel are almost spot on. The flavor is complex but confusing. It's very malty but overly toasty and roasty. It's hopyy but the hops can't contend with the malts. I probably won't pick this up again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 11/19/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish orange color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Thick foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, mango, pine, herbal, orange zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, and floral. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity. Taste of grapefruit, pine, caramel, orange zest, pineapple, toast, floral, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, toast, floral, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance as well. Slight cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, slick, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent strong ale. Great hop flavor complexity and malt balance; and quite smooth to sip on. Very enjoyable stuff."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice red amber in color with maybe a one finger head and little lacing. This beer is very malt forward which is about the only thing I pick up in the smell and it dominates in the taste. Very well balanced in flavor and besides the malt I get the hops, some toffee, and sweet tart fruitiness. It comes off very smooth at first but has a bitter dry aftertaste that is non-offensive. My overall opinion is that it is a really good beer but it lacks distinctiveness and for a seasonal I was expecting it to be a bit more bold all around. Because of this I can't say it justifies the higher price of it, which was close to $12 for a 4pk. If this was on their main line of beers I would probably rate it higher, but in the scope of things it's just another quality product from GLBC that I recommend for at least a try."
""
"Overall- This is a prime example of why you don't judge a book by it's cover. This is a beautiful looking beer that has an unbalanced pine hop presence. It was a drain pour x2 for me, but I'm not into beers being over hopped especially with piney or floral hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall another solid beer from Great Lakes. Slightly preferred the 2012 version but the 2013 is no slouch."
"Good Imperial Red here. Great Lakes never disappoints."
"O: One of my favorite beers this time of year. This is a dangerous beer. It will sneak up and bite you...for real."
"O: I'm so glad I finally got to try this brew that always comes around this time a year but I'd never taken the plunge. Great idea for a Halloween seasonal as well...."
""
"O: This is a very good beer."
""
""
"O - Such a delicious red ale. I really have enjoyed this four pack. Shared one with a friend of mine on the golf course and he was really impressed. I recommend it"
""
""
""
""
"Thank god it tastes better than it smells. I get a burnt sugar flavor, molasses, caramel candy, and a nice floral hop note in the background. It has a lighter body which shocked me especially for an 8% ABV beer, with medium carbonation and the finish is a touch on the dry side. It's a good beer, but not one of their best seasonals."
""

""
""
""

""
""

"Appropriately on the sweeter side for a Halloween seasonal, I suppose... although I couldn't see myself consuming more than one bottle per session because of how sweet it is, much less the relatively high ABV..."

"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - While this brew and I get along much better than we did in the past few years, it is still far from my favorite strong ale. Still, it is chock-full of roasty fruits and does a bit of damage to the palate. Medium to heavy-bodied. I will try another one of these fresh when the new season rolls around."
""

"Pours a dark amber color, with a small off white head. Smell of big caramel malt, juicy citrus hops, and hints of sweet Ripe fruits. The flavor is fairly sweet as well, caramel malt, and wood notes, as well as some piney hops in the finish. The hop bitterness really shows up in the aftertaste, and stays awhile in the mouth. Good beer that I don't buy often enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of my favorite American red ales. Achieves a great balance between the malts and hops. Unique and tasty."
""
"Well-balanced and enjoyable until the finish.  Tasty toasted malts with some caramel paired with citrus hops share the stage.  Finishing hops of bitter dried herbs and a touch of pine spoil the party at the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this one into a glass, it has a nice amber color body with and great looking 2"" white head that hangs around. The smell is has nice ctrus aroma to it. The taste has a nice grapfruit/hop taste up front with a malt sweetness on the back of the tongue. The mouthfell is very nice and overall this is a really good beer."
""
""
""
"Taste/Mouthfeel; Full and hearty in the front having a crisp burst of hops that warms from the alcohol on the back end as it goes down finishing crisp and clean with a nice hop taste that almost seems like it has a bit of rye in the mix. The abv is warming and not boozy in the least. Overall, another solid offering from Great Lakes, well done would certainly recommend and get again in future seasons to come."

"Pretty good brew and solid as always from Great Lakes. I wish the hop profile were a little more complex, but really only nitpick complaints. This tides me over until NN hits."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice red colour with good carbonation. Aroma of malt and citrusy, earthy hops, though not a strong nose. Taste of caramel, citrus fruit, and raisins. Rather sweet, but balanced by the distinct alcohol bite and hop bitterness. Overall, a delicious beer, if a bit heavy. A four pack would make for a very nice liquid dinner."
"O-good, I'll have to try a fresher one to see how it compares"
"Overall, a very solid beer. The hops are fairly dominant over the malt in the flavor, perhaps more so than the aroma indicates. Definitely worth a try, though a bit misleading to label it a red ale...imperial or not."

"Overall - I think I was expecting more hop bitterness with this one. I see that my bottle was 'best before nov 2011' so maybe that had something to do with it. Anyways, still a very drinkable beer and the alcohol was well hidden - just not something I'd reach for again."
"O - Not doing much for me, for an American Strong Ale, I was expecting more."
""
"Very different from other strong ales I've had, but the style is not particular. Overall, quite good, would willingly pick up another four-pack if I could find it. Also, my year of aging this shows that it ages well in a fridge."
""
"O - This is a good Great Lakes beer. Glad I found this one at Zipp's in Minneapolis."
"O: I liked it - a very well balanced American Strong Ale. Glad I was able to find a 4-pack of this."
"Thanks bpfrush for the killer extra, you're the man Brian!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O not bad stuff here. This one had some age on it so I'd love to try it fresh and taste some big hops. pretty good stuff."
"O-a nice red ale with a nice biting bitter finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"D: definitely a good tasting brew. not quite an american strong, but definitely more what the label says. an imperial red. good balance makes this a tasty drinkable brew for sure."
""
""
""
"an imperial red ale, pours more copper in color with a nice thick head. smells a little sweet like a red, with a round hop profile as well. a little funky in the sense that the alcohol in cohorts with the malts is off a little to me. new maybe, not gross. taste quite large, malt driven for sure, but more balanced than the smell. dont think i could drink more than one pint of this as it was filling and strong. heavy mouthfeel and intoxicating. my first big beer from great lakes, not wowed"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd like to try this beer fresh, but it's definitely a worthy beer as is. If you're a fan, consider putting some away and having it some cold Winter's night. 4pk of these at 1~2 years old is like having a 4pk of decently aged Old Ruffian or Olde Gnarlywine."
""
"O: Another great offering from GL."
""
""
""
""
"Not as hop dominated as I feared, which for me is a good thing. I do think this is a pretty nice beer, has a good range of flavors and goes down smooth and easy. The alcohol is well hidden, and the flavor makes it one of the better beers I have tried lately."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: a big feature to this robust beer is its lingering qualities, which leads me to suggest Great Lakes should continue to release this in the fall, but push it through the winter season due to its warming effect."
""
""
""
""
"Tasty ale and not as strong flavored as expected. This isn't a hop bomb. This is a rather friendly strong ale I will have again."
""
"Overall: A little aggressive on the hoppy flavors (something I always personally enjoy), but an overall delicious brew. 8.0% ABV entirely hidden. This is not one a beer you can drink a whole lot of in one sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A tasty and unique flavor. Worth seeking out."
""
""
"It's a well made beer and I liked it, but not as much as most of the other reviewers. Definitely a beer for the hopheads."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. I don't know whether to call this an imperial red or a strong ale or what, but it's pretty tasty."

"O: Although leaning towards the bitter, hoppy side, this beer still remains incredibly balanced. Very easy drinking for 8%. Big biscuity malts and sugar with pine and citrus hops to balance it out."
"O: I love the beer but think that it could be improved probably without a ton of effort. I have to assume that this beer was meant to taste this way but the bitterness is just off in this beer. It is a clean beer until it was overbittered. Take away the astringency and the pungent bitterness and this is a great beer. For an 8% beer this does seem to do decently on the strong ale side which was slightly surprising."
"O: A good red ale. A touch to floraly and the touch of alcohol in the finish are the only bad points."
"Pours a very nice red color with a short head. Dissipates to a film and lacing. The smell is fruity hop with a sweet malty background. The taste is also fruity hop with a nice balance of malt. Mildly bitter finish. This is a great beer. Well balanced and very easy to drink."
"O: Nosferatu is a unique beer. I haven't encountered a beer that so demonstrably integrates both malt and hop flavor. It's a beer in conflict...an IPA blended up with a Scotch Ale/Octoberfest hybrid. And it's delicious. It leans a little on the boozy side and I'm not sure I would want more than one or two of these at a time, but there won't be another Fall where I don't think of this beer. Perfectly matched to the season in which it is released, Nosferatu is an outstanding Strong Ale."
"O-good beer, I don't have alot of experience with this style but I did enjoy it. Nice balance of bitterness and sweetness, Would have again"
"O: This is a real winner of a beer. I am a huge Imperial IPA fan but this was a really nice change of pace that will soon be repeated by buying these bad boys again."
"Overall (4.5): Incredibly drinkable, it’d probably be more bitter if it was fresher but honestly where it is now is fantastic. I liked the wide variation of hop flavors present, especially with more prominent grass, floral, and tropical notes happening. This really was a hop story for me, honestly, which is not what I was expecting (or remembered from last year). Malt was simple but did the job more than well enough. This was a great beer, looking forward to next year’s already!"
"Overall: a full flavored malty beer that has a nice strong bitterness. Slow sipping beer but fully satisfying. One could have this as a dessert beer."
"Deep ruby red with a small amount of creamy head. Thins out to a ring around the glass. Nose is a big on biscuit and rye bread. Also a layer of peppery yeast and earthy, resinous hops. The hops shine through immediately, similar to the nose. Not overwhelming but balanced out with the wave of rich caramel, biscuit malts come through. Some of the yeast character comes out for the finish but I am mainly tasting rich, toasty, bready malts and piney bitter hops. Dry finish makes me want to keep quenching my thirst."
"O:"
"A handsome looking beer with a brilliant copper color and a tall foamy cap. The head is dense and lingers a long while leaving spotty lacing in it's wake. On the nose I get a hoppy upfont bouquet with piney and earth tones followed by a malt nose of sweet caramel malts, a little fruity too. Palette is as the nose: a good dose of hops upfont similar to the nose and equal amounts of maltiness with a hint of fruits in the finish. A well balanced ale. The feel is medium with a dry bitter finish. A good beer be it a red or old, one that I'm sure I'll be drinking again."
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark amber in color with a one finger off white head. The aromas are pretty traditional for an imperial amber. You get a lot of malts, light cherry, more malt, maybe some oak. It's solid. The flavors too of a complex malt bill. It's just hard to pick apart it's sweetness, which is smooth and not over the top. It drinks medium in body and has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. It's deceiving really. You don't get anywhere near 8.0%. Overall this is a solid beer and a nice imperial amber. It is what it is."
" Overall this one of my favorite beers! It's so easy to drink for being 8.0. This is a seasonal that is a must get every year. A must try."
"O: I'm a big fan of hopped up Imperial Reds and this is a very good example of the style. Nosferatu is a solid beer that I'll likely pick up again at some point down the road."
"O. Too malty, needs more hops, more like a light barleywine then a hoppy red ale."
"O: Really liked this one. I feel like they could have gotten away with 9% and still done well, but still really enjoyed. I love strong ales, and the red color adds to the overall theme here. I highly recommend."
"SkÅL!"
"O- Good beer, but nothing outstanding. Wasn't sure what this was classified as before I saw it here. Sort of a barleywine lite."
"O - Great beer, very easy to drink which could put you in a world of hurt if your not careful!!"
"Pours a rusty copper color, good cap of dense off-white to khaki froth, good sticky lacing. Scent is hop forward with a backbone of carmamel, toasty and nutty malts. Suprising that the taste leads with an almost Scotch Ale like malt profile... toasty, nutty and caramely... before becoming a carrier of a significant amount of American hops... grassy, piney and citrusy. Medium bodied, bright carbonation, could use a touch more heft. A solid all around showcase of solid malting and hopping."
"O/D - Nice. A really drinkable beer with a huge hop dose. Bottle says Imperial Red, though I get no sense of any elements typical of an Amber/Red ale. It could use more depth and balance, but still an alright beer."
"Wow, another winner from Great Lakes. A very nice treat during a cool night."
"Overall I'm fairly disappointed with this one. Had higher hopes. To me it tastes like it's old, to the point of the buttering hops are left and the aromatics are gone, but that's not the case. I can't get past how bitter the aftertaste is. At points here and there it almost felt like I was drinking cough syrup or something."
"There is nice stuff in this drink. Not sure why it's a 4 pack for the price of a 6 pack - doesn't seem that big or unique - I nick it some for that."
"Overall it's nice. Good malts, decent hops, booze is almost there but drinks well. A nice blood thickness and almost chewy. Balanced and drinkable."
"O: The label says that this beer has a bite and that's why its named after a vampire. I'd have to agree that it does feature quite a bitterness bite to it. Not a favorite of mine, however."
"Overall: This beer was certainly enjoyable, yet the price is something to be considered being a little steep for the end result. No regrets trying this beer, it was a good experience, it just isn't something that I would seek out or wait for each Fall."
"O: Overall, a good beer. Tasty and smooth without being boozy or overwhelming the palate."
"Great crafted strong ale! Gives Arrogant a run for it's money! I love it!"
"O= I've been wanting to try this beer for some time now and I haven't worked up the balls to buy it. This bottle was given to me and I've happy I didn't buy it. It's not that it's a waste of money. It's a good beer but there are much better beers for less price. Worth trying but not my favorite."
"Had on tap in imperial half pint glass at Hopleaf in Chicago. Heard great things about this beer and thought it would be right up my alley. Was not disappointed. Pours beautiful dark woody red that is transparent. 1/4 head that held onto the sides of the glass nicely. Nice sharp citrus hops with a tinge of alcohol and then the sugars followed by a bite of pine. Great smooth drinking with balance of sweet, sour, spice that I loved."
"O: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, definitely a unique taste for the style. I just wish it was in a six pack."
"overall, this is about what I expected from an imperial red ale. everything you love about a red, just more of it. A nice fall beer."
"A solid beer in a style that is not one of my favorites."
"Great Irish Red Ale type finish that's on the hoppy side. a little dry. Great balance throughout. Not too hoppy to taste the rest of the flavors but hoppy enough for a hop head like me"
"Pours a deep red/copper color with a small beige head that leaves quickly. Smells of malts toffee and caramel. Some alcohol also on the nose. Taste is full of malts with hints of hop and citrus fruits. Pretty good tasting. Medium body and plenty of carbonation. Very glad I got to try this. Very good tasting beer and a nice fall alternative to all the oktoberfest and other fall seasonals."
"O: A real nice beer. Reminds me of Stone Arrogant Bastard in a lot of ways."
"O- An outstanding beer, I honestly wasn't expecting it to be this good, although Great Lakes usually doesn't disappoint. A powerful beer with big flavor, definitely give this one a try."
"o: one of my favorite beers. A release I look forward to every fall and it never disappoints. Well done Great Lakes!"
"A tad syrupy up front and finishing much lighter with ample carbonation. Overall, I enjoyed this more than the aforementioned hop driven beers from this brewery."
"O- My favorite seasonal offering from Great Lakes and may be my favorite overall from them. Very drinkable with the 8% being hidden very well."
"This came highly recommended, but it doesn't wow me. Call it a strong ale, an amber/red, whatever you want - I've had quite a few that I liked more."
"O- This is one hoppy red ale. This is a great hop head beer for the fall months. Definitely a beer I will pick up every year."
"Overall: An incredible red ale from Great Lakes. Very bold with the hops and malts. Great balance. One of my favorite beers period."
"O- great red ale. good balance on flavor and very smooth. Good brewery out in Cleveland."
"Overall: I thought the alcohol was hidden well in this beer. There was a strong bitterness in the finish that wasn't totally pleasant. I'm not sure that I'll have this one aga."
"Notes: This is Great Lakes' Burning River Pale Ale on Steroids. Sort of an American IPA with toasted malts instead of pale malts. This is a robust, caramel and bittersweet cocoa beer with zesty, peppery citrus hops. A great Autumn sipper."
"O: A great beer that is very well enjoyed during the cold months."
"Second only to Lake Erie Monster in terms of GL beers. Get at least a 4 pack and when thats gone, find more."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer, for some reason I was pretty sure that this beer was going to be heavy on the spices and possibly a pumpkin beer, but instead I was given a pretty hoppy and biscuity Imperial Red Ale, this was unexpected but I ended up liking it so it was a good surprise. The high amount of bitterness doesn't make it that drinkable so I don't think I would have more then one of these in a sitting. What I liked most about this beer was the taste, I haven't had the combo of biscuit malts and floral hops before and I thought it was different and went well together. There wasn't anything that I didn't like but I thought that the bitterness could be toned down a little to enhance the drinkability and enjoyment. I might get a bottle of this when it is released next year but a four pack may be too much for me to handle. I recommend giving this beer a try it's pretty unique, and if hops are your thing I am sure you will dig it. This looks like another good beer from Great Lakes Brewing Company, not the most mind blowing beer, but all in all a good change of pace.  After having this beer more than a few times, I had to bump it up to a solid 4, all aspects are equally good and it stands out as a nice Fall seasonal, I buy a four pack every year."
"O: Solid beer, don't know what I paid for it but it was good. Not really my favorite ever, but decent."
"Overall, I'm pretty happy I got a pint of this. Bold beer but could definitely be bolder. Great taste, and the mouthfeel was spot on. Worth getting for sure."
"Mouthfeel: It has a smooth easy drinking texture to it that still let’s the flavor last."
"Future outlook: This beer didn't ""wow"" me, but it's another rock solid offering from GL's...I'm sure we'll meet again someday."
"4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4, 5"
"A solid seasonal with good flavor, well balanced. I would pick this up again considering it's not overally expensive at 9.99 at 4 pk"
"this is a favorite that has eluded me for years. so happy to find this."
"Overall - A solid beer. ""Reds"" often leave me disappointed, but this brought the right amount of balance to the beer and left me wanting more. There was nothing that particularly stood out to me, but I think GL has brewed another solid brew."
"O: Great Lakes Nosferatu is a pretty good beer from a top notch brewery. All of their higher gravity offerings (sans stouts) tend to be a little too hot (see: Lake Erie Monster). With a bit more finesse, this could really be something special. As it currently stands, I look forward to enjoying the rest of my four-pack, and have no problem recommending it to you."
"O - a very well balanced beer with loads of different flavors and smells. A unique flavored brew and is a good change of pace on this cool night in front of the camp fire. I will buy a few more of these without question. Good quality and class as always from GLBC."
"at $7.49 a growler at DEP's i'm glad they have another keg on the way when this one runs out. a great beer for when the nights turn colder."
"Overall, Nosferatu is awesome. It has a very smooth hop flavor with a lot of bright characters; balanced all the way through"
"Overall: This is a beer that I had been anticipating for a while, and now I feel a little bit let down. Compared to the bottle from 2011, the 2010 bottle is significantly different. Nearly no hop presence, with a cloudy color and an increased sweetness. This bottle did not blow me away either, however."
"Overall a very good beer, one I'll buy each year as a nice seasonal"
"Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with good carbonation levels. Finish is sticky with a nice film left on the inside of your mouth. Overall this is a good brew that isn't extremely bitter but still offers the good citrus flavors that more bitter brews have. Definitely an enjoyable brew."
"A very light malty flavor quickly overcome by a dry hop bite. Predominant flavors of grapefruit and lemon overpower the contributions from toasted malt, but there is a noticeably marmalade-like sweetness sort of lingering underneath all that bitterness. I thought this beer was tasty and refreshing, but personally would have preferred a bit more maltiness. I enjoyed it and can suggest it without hesitation, but I probably won't buy it again at this price."
"O: Another seasonal I've been waiting on. This is a slight step out from GLBC's uber traditional line-up and I really dig it. A nice in-your-face malt bill and some heavy hopping make this a nice tasty beer. Check this stuff out."
"O-very solid brew. Would love to see wwhat some age does to it"
"Seeing as how this beer is called Nosferatu, I expected it to be one of two colors. Dark as night, or blood red. It was neither, rather it was amber. Despite the color being not what I expected, this beer certainly has ""bite"". They call it an Imperial Red Ale, but it tastes and feels much more like an IPA to me. It has all the familiar characteristics like the dry finish, the huge hoppy, almost piney flavor. It's quite good."
"O - One of my favorites this time of year. A really solid red ale that is one of my go to beers on the weekend"
"This is a nicely done red ale, the color of this brew fits the name very really. It's got a deep shade of red with a decent looking white head on top. The smell of the beer has a piney citrus aroma much like some nice IPA's do. The taste of the beer is hoppy with some sweet caramel flavors in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent I though, not overly carbonated and had a normal feeling body to it. Overall I loved the name of the beer, and in general I though the beer itself was quite good."
"Was most surprised with how sweet this was for a Strong Ale. Overall, another good beer from GL."
"It feels a bit watery, too. Maybe a bit too much for my taste and for the alcohol by volume. Overall Nosferatu from Great Lakes is a solid brew, with an excellent name and label, but probably not something I'd return to - both because of style and the beer itself."
"O - The bottle says it has a bite, and it does. Enjoyed this one."
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this is a somewhat thick feeling beer. The carbonation helps to prevent this beer from becoming too sticky, but is not enough to give it great drinkability. In all truth, it is a little more than sippable but not much more than that."
"O - Overall, this is a nice, sweet and hoppy sipper. Glad I got to try it."
"What is the best way to get rid of the Monday's???? NOSFERATU!!!! Will certainly scare away your blues!!! This beer is a amber/red clear color with very thin white head. The smell has hop and malt characters which transcends into a wonderful tasting ale. I am really starting to like hopped up red ales and lagers! The hop and malt help to balance the higher ABV of this beer. I would be in serious...I mean SERIOUS trouble if I had alot of this in my fridge! This beer is definitely worth a sample....if not a SESSION!!!!"
"Poured into a tulip with a ruddy brown body, color like rust, with a size-able frothy white head. Smelled very hoppy, mostly floral/piney hops, sweet biscuity and fruity smells. Almost like a hoppy rum cake (sounds weird, but its good, I'm not doing it justice). Taste reminds me of an American Barleywine. Sweet, but not cloying or dry, with an assertive, but not overwhelming, hop profile. Sticky, oily hops mixed with a raisin and caramel background. Not boozy though, not surprisingly, and somewhat spicy. Feels lighter than a barleywine, though still somewhat viscous. Not that highly carbonated, but not flat. I liked this brew a good deal, so much so that my notes weren't taken as well this time because I was too busy just enjoying the beer. Definitely a good thing. I will be sure to be ISO this come next fall."
"Big thanks goes out to sproser (Secret Santa '10) and crashdavisinoh for sending these to me so I could have multiple bottles! Enjoy by 12/30/10. Batch 7243AE. Served from bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and subtle sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, and caramel hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. The aroma on this one was pretty good if I'm honest. The flavor however was decent at best. Really wish some of the sweet alcohol from the aroma would have carried over into the flavor. However, the sweetness aspect was pretty big on the flavor though. Definitely worth trying at least once."
"O: Very tasty, very smooth, easy to drink, would have a few in a sitting"
"Not a bad brew, though the style (imperial red ale?) isn't one I'm much of a fan of. Still, it's well balanced, full of flavor, and has a cool name. So it has that going for it."
"I'd like to try this fresh, maybe next year, or aged for a while longer, but its not a bad beer."
"Pours reddish brown with a sizable tan head that fade slowly and leaves lacing all over the place. Smells of hops and a bit of sweetness. Taste is what you would expect of an aggressively hoppy imperial red ale - hop forward with a finishing malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is good, appropriately carbed and medium-heavy thickness. Pretty big in all ways, not super drinkable. Pretty decent and interesting brew."
"D: Drinkable, a bit too heavy on the early, bittering hops, but overall a decent old stock. Needs a hint more residual sugar IMO."
"Mouthfeel is nice - medium bodied, yet both creamy and crisp."
"Named after one of the scariest vampires of all time. Deep reddish amber color comes off very clear, and the lacing does a great job of sticking to the glass. Massive toasted biscuity nose, with some sweetness and some hop resin. Smooth malty body, big kiss of sweetness to start but then the malt rails in hard with a pleasing toasted graini- ness, which stays. Some rounded dark caramel adds to the sweetness, as does the dark, fruity alcohol. Hops may not beat this beer down with bitterness, but the oily resin flavor keeps things in check. As the beer warms a little, it unfolds into a lovely sipper; it's easily a mood beer for the cooler months."
"wow. the mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy. unexpected, but couldn't be better. crazy drinkable for a high alchohol beer. once again, I continue to be very impressed with every new Great Lakes beer I try."
"Red wine in color with a cream orange colored head that has excellent texture and retention. Dare I say that this beer looks sexy. Smells like a caramelized Christmas Tree. Caramel is also present in the flavor with citrus and evergreen hops. This beer packs a strong punch with out being overwhelming. Good full mouthfeel and I can't tell that it's 8%. Good beer from a great brewery."
"The ""bite"" at the back of the throat is awesome as each sip is swallowed. Great all around beer."
"Poured into dimple glass from 12oz bottle. Pours an excellent deep blood red color with a creamy beige head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is somewhat sweet with caramel, earth, citrus, and pine. Well-balanced and tasty on the flavor, with caramel malt, nuts, roast, wood, spices, and citrus/pine hops. Like a good imperial red ale if anything. Medium-bodied and smooth yet sticky on the palate with some hop resins. Put the last nail in my coffin on Halloween. Very good stuff!"
"I am a big fan of IPA/DIPA and this fits the bill although list as a ASA. Outstanding!"
"d: nosferatu is exceptionally drinkable. it's a great example of my favorite style of beer. i just wish it wasn't seasonal!"
"got this brew at consumers for a buy one get one free growler, how can you pass up free beer?! poured into a dogfish head snifter glass. very hoppy taste, almost like their commodore perry ipa, but yet a little sweeter and darker. the smell was delicious wanted to just just jump in and swim. very dark mahogany red in the glass. the the taste threw me for a loop however, despite how much i liked this beer, it tended to be a too bitter of the finish on some sips for me. but all in all another fantastic great lakes brew."
"D. Drinkable 8% beer. Not the most flavorful in my opinion. It is a pretty well balanced beer that goes down easy enough. I wasn't amazed but a solid offering."
"Overall a pretty darn good beer, I got mine at Kroger's here in Barboursville WV for 12.99, and the expiration date was a couple weeks ago, but I bought it over a month ago.. Still very good."
"D: High, sweetness and alcohol prevent drinkability from being 5/5 but it's still quite high."
"Drinkability: I like the caramel and pine hops mix. The sweet and bitter mix nicely. I could have a couple of these if it were available around here."
"Picked up a single to try. The ""best before"" date was drawing near but it still had a nice hop bite to go along with the caramel and toffee sweetness. Reminded me a little of Arrogant Bastard ale. Tasty stuff!"
"A pretty solid effort."
"Will put the rest of the 6 pack in the cellar to let the hops fade a bit."
"Taste was bitter hops, raisins, bread, toasted grains, faint cherries and brown sugar.  "
""
"Good drinkability, very interesting and unique beer."
"M - Medium body, slight chew, lightly carbonated."
"For the purpose of scores, I compared this beer to Arrogant Bastard and it doesn't come close. Frankly, I don't see much potential in ""red"" ales, imperial or otherwise."
"12oz bottle purchased from Wolverine Market in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours a deep ruby red with a thick cream white cap and globs of lace on the tulip. Smell is cherry cookie, molasses, strawberry cake, sugary malts, cocoa powder, candy apple, and resiny hops. Flavour is toffee, caramel, dried fruit sweetness, toasty biscuit, dark grapes, burnt sugar, dates, piny and citric bitterness, warming booze in the throat. Mouthfeel is rich, creamy-smooth, fuller than medium, lasting bitter astringency, wet and biting finish. A stand-up American Strong Ale that seems better suited as a winter release rather than a fall seasonal. The taste is equal parts barley wine, imperial amber, and winter warmer, which makes this one hell of a unique brew. An excellent offering from Great Lakes Ohio."
"Drinkability: A very tasty and drinkable brew. Perfect choice for ending a great day on the town. Definetely recommend."
"Wouldnt want to drink more than one of these at a time. that said it was a good experience"
"even with the higher than average abv, one growler is no problem. i definatly recommend this and ill be sure to revisit this one soon."
"Moderately carbonated, but leaving a modicum of coating on the tongue and roof of the mouth. It's not exactly cloying, but a bit clingy. A good sipper that is better when it warms up just a bit ... but not too much."
"All in all, this is an ok beer. Not perfect, but decent. I wouldn't bother trying unless you have access of want to try the GL lineup. Otherwise, many better beers in the style."
"All in all a good beer."
"Pours a dark brown with good sized head and leaves lace patches. A nutty, sweet caramel malt aroma along w/ breadiness or toffee and some tea-like hop bitterness. Medium to heavy body with slick sweetness of caramel malt along with bread and toffee or roasted malts (what is w/ me and this toffee?) for a dry edge to the beer. Has a light citric, floral hops balance for a dry finish w/ well-hidden ABV for proper balance. Not overly strong like some of these ales but thoroughly enjoyable and a must try."
"If you like a hoppier beer you might like this, it's not bad just not what I would come back to."
"Notes: A great Halloween beer - it seems to be a red, imperial oktoberfest. Very enjoyable. Look forward to one again next year. I have never found a less than stellar beer from Great Lakes; keep them coming!"
"Overall, this is a great beer I'd suggest anyone to try... very different and very unique. Great Lakes always has a knack for surprising me. Bravo!"
"Very full in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth for an 8% strong ale, the hops and malt are so nicely melded, I could easily drink a couple more of these."
"Pours a dark, clear red with a good amount of foam. Tastes quite malty with a bitter finish. Hops lingering in slightly too. Makes me wonder if this is an older bottle. The hops seem to have faded a little. Drinks down very smooth though and theres no hint of the 8% alc at all. Its not bad, but I was expecting a bit more from th is."
"D - Scary at 8%...doesn't really show. Well balanced and well blended array of flavors. An interesting take on the stock ale. Very clean tasting...great for the cool, rainy evening I'm experiencing now. Would love to have this again."
"Poured into a snifter. The color is a murky amber with a short light-tan head that persists for quite some time. The nose is a bit of roasted nuttiness with some caramel and light fruits. A bit of earthy and pine hops. Faint citrus as well. The taste melds things together but is a bit plain. Some slightly-sweet cherry-tasting malt and a bit of light hops. Feel is medium and a bit sweet with a mild bitterness. Some good flavors individually, but I don't quite like how everything comes together in the end."
"D: This is one of my favority Great Lakes brews, if not my #1. I feel like its the perfect beer for me to transition from my warm weather IPAs to my cold weather stouts. A great ale and at 8% I don't think you could go wrong."
"Tastey good beer, the strength probably puts it just out of session range for most, but still might be hard to refuse a second one. Or a third."
"Pours a clear amber with a lively head. The aroma is warm a cherrylike, but with some earthy and grassy quality to it that increases as it warms. The flavor is like a dark chocolate-covered cherry, sweet and rich and bitter, with a delicious spiciness like a fruitcake, with toasty wheat and malt. There is a wonderful deep bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderfully chewy."
"Overall a great beer but I would prefer third coast ale over this anyday."
"Drinkability -- Quite good. Great Lakes Brewing tends to be a mixed bag for me, but this was my cup of tea. American Barleywine meets English DIPA? It blurs a lot of lines in a good way. Satisfying malt character with citrusy hops make this terribly drinkable. Good on ya, Great Lakes!"
"Medium bodied, proper carbonation,and there is a nice combination of sweetness balanced by hop bitterness. I like this beer quite a bit, and will be sure to look for it again."
"D: Really good for a Strong Ale (Old ale?)."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with the freshness date and ABV on the label. Deep blood red color; not too much of a head, good carbonation. Aroma is an unique blend of sweet caramel with pine, unlike any I have had so far. The taste is truly exceptional, the hops hit you right away, but the finish is malty/sweet. The ABV is masked very well amongst the bevy of flavors that hit your palate. Drinkability is very good, too bad it is a seasonal beer. Highly recommended, anyone and everyone who appreciates beer MUST have the Nosferatu. I don't know how they do it, but Great Lakes is another brewery that keeps churning, well brewing, one solid beer after another.... Cheers!!!"
"Drink by date: 12/16/10"
"D: Not high for me. Intense hops make it tough to drink it consecutively."
"Had on tap at Pazzo's Pizza Pub. A- the beer is a reddish amber color with a thin tight white head that recedes into lacing for the entire beer. Smell is of citrus and pine hops big hop pressance. Taste is very nice crisp citrus hops some grapefruit maybe a little pin and grassy hop flavors, balance by a nice malt backbone that doesn't have much pressance up front but helps round out the beer. Mouthfeel is very clean and crisp and light. Very drinkable beer, you definately do not find the 8% abv in this one. I honestly was expecting more hop and more alchohol in this one."
"D - Very interesting. I would like more. Probably wouldn't be my go-to, but you never say never. At least I don't."
"This is an interesting brew that is suitable for hop lovers when fresh."
"D: Enjoyable and very drinkable; the one good thing about the thin mouthfeel (I guess) is that it lends to an easier drinking brew; a nice choice for cooler weather and another good one from Great Lakes!"
"Having wanted to try this one for quite a while, I was glad to pull this one from a trade package earlier this week. Poured from the bottle a dark red color with a little bit of off-white foam. Aromas of candi sugar, sweet malt and light hops. On the palate this one is medium bodied, with good carbonation, caramel, sweet malt, some citrusy hops and a candy sweet finish."
"Reminds me of another famous beer of this style (AB), but hoppier."
"drinkability would i risk my soul for one more? probably."
"Reddish amber color with a large head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma seems to be a balance between the citrus and pine hops and the caramel malt. No hint of alcohol is detected. But the alcohol sure is detected in the flavor. The flavor starts with notes of grapefruit, pine, and grass. The malt then adds its contribution of caramel and a little toastiness. Finishes dry and boozy. The body seems a little too light for so much going on in the flavor but it has nice carbonation for the size of the beer. An interesting beer that has some good hop flavor and some malt balance."
"D: Decent drinkability. I thought it was going to have more malt and a less hops, but its still good and defiantly worth a try."
"I'm also giving .5 extra points to the appearance for the concept of the beer: great Nosferatu on the label with a bloody looking beer that has biting hop flavor."
"Color was dark brown, with a touch of reddish hue. Small 1 finger off white head that laster a few minutes and then left no trace. Aroma was slightly berry fruity, sweet, but with a touch of acid bitterness, maybe akin to a raspberry. Taste was completely unlike the aroma. It had a hoppy bitterness to the flavor with the piney aftertaste. Hopes became more pronounced as it went on. Felt thin in the mouch, otherwise was well balanced, nicely carbonated. ABV hit hard and fast, despite being otherwise fairly well balanced and drinkable."
"O: Comes across as a double IPA. Not a bad thing, just something to consider before you make a purchase."
"Wow I am really not a big fan of the the style but this was great."
"D - Overall didn't expect this old ale to be so hoppy! Liked it and will have it again! Awesome!"
"d - A decent enough red/strong ale, but nothing really stood out about it. I enjoyed the caramel malts and citrus hops, but would have liked more out of it. Would drink it again but wouldn't seek it out annd it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Poured into a dogfish head glass a transparent dark amber with a very thick off white head. It's allergy season, so my nose is worthless. But I am getting a good hint of hops in the scent. The taste is almost like a IIPA and a Barleywine mix. There is carmel malts and sugars with a good hop representation that leaves a dry bitterness. Medium body in the mouthfeel with no apparent alcohol burn. Nosferatu is one of the many reasons why I wish GLB distributed to Texas."
"Notes: Now, this is Great Lakes quality to remember. Despite a couple of not so good tries of late this is putting me back on their path."
"D - A very drinkable beer. I'm nearly done tasting my first bottle of this and I'm surprised it went as quick as it did. Not heavy, but I can myself wanting to move on to something else after a few of these due to the high hop character. Extremely happy I went with my urge to pick this one up."
"cheers"
"M/D: Full bodied and no hint of the 8% whatsoever. Overall a really nice beer, very drinkable."
"Highly enjoyable."
"Nice dark gold color and head retention. Aroma has a lot of hops and almost get that fresh hop smell with some malts . Really like this beer good amount of hops as well as malt so no matter what you are looking for this seems to hit the spot. Again like the other ales from GLB it has a lot of body with it. This one I'm sad that it would be hard to find at home."
"D - although an excellent beer, i couldnt see myself drinking more than 1 or 2 of these, can definitely sit on one for a while"
"D/O- Drinkability suffers some due to the high ABV but who would want more than one of these bad boys anyways? This is a special beer and having more than one would devalue that. Cheers to GLBC for an all around winner. Aging a couple of these for a rainy day down the road."
"D: I could drink this beer all day every day"
"D- At 8% masked pretty well, nicely balanced, great beer."
"M- Highly carbonated, dry and medium bodied."
"Bottle. Pours a really nice red clear color with a nice off white head that shows some good lace as it settles. The aroma is a nice blend of both hops and malt. Medium mouthfeel. This beer really does remind me of a ncie fall day. The taste is slightly sweet up front with a some what biscuity flavor that transitions to a decently hoppy bite that lingers. This beer is like a toned down DIPA but in a good way. Really enjoyable beer."
"pours a mostly clear red amber color with a 1 finger head that recedes to a fresh beige collar... smell is malts and toffee some roasted malts citrus and spice smells..taste is wow!..its citrus hops with roasted malts bready tastes all put together in a tasty strong ale..mouth feel is medium++ with citrus hops and roasted malts/toffee its somewhat bitter but its scary drinkable no detection of abv 8%..solid sstrong ale ..buy this one quick it is great"
"A wonderful, highly hopped malt special. Tasty and complex with a super malty/hoppy combo."
"Had this on-tap at TJ's. Poured a reddish-amber with a one-finger, off-white head which dissaptes to a coating. Lacing is ample and lasting. Nose is caramel, grapefruit. Taste is sweet caramel and bready malts, tempered by the bitter grapefuit. Mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Brew is mildly sticky and oily. It is a little sticky but not unpleasantly so. There is no hint of the higher ABV in the taste but it is the only thing preventing me from having another."
"Overall: A very good beer. I've never tasted this type of flavor combination. It's a bit like a combination of different IPAs."
"Missed out on this last year, so it's nice that we happened upon it at the Firk tonight. It pours a russet Halloween brown topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises rye bread, spicy caramel (...that's what I wrote...I hope it makes sense to someone else...), light booze, and red grapes. The taste goes in a slightly different direction, with notes of grapefruit, light caramel, heavy pine sap, and cedar. The body is a solid medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a thickly watery (or watery thick) feel. Overall, I gotta say I wasn't enthralled with this brew, but it's not all that horrible either. I like the disjointedness, but I can't see myself seeking it out very often in the future."
"D: This is a really nice Strong Red ale or stock ale. The flavors do develop with the warming of the brew. Nicely done and tastes really good outdoors on an autumn night while the sun is sinking low."
"M- Sweet on the lips. Juicy with a quick dry finish."
"The appearance is of a nice brownish red with a decent finger of foam on the surface. The smell is mostly of sour and char. There are some citrusy hop aromas most similar to orange zest, but that's not nearly as strong as the burnt notes. The flavor is strongly of burnt biscuit. A slight malty flavor comes in on the back end to try and rectify the damage done, but it is too late. The burnt biscuit flavor is really off putting to the point where I truly don't like this beer. The mixing of the hop flavor with it makes it seem like someone lit hops on fire before putting them in this brew. The good thing is the bitterness doesn't translate too badly on the mouthfeel, but it is still there to a point I don't care for, despite the smooth nature of the drink. This beer is all sorts of intense, that I really don't care to go into. It's harsh in a number of ways and honestly some might enjoy drinking it, but I could go either way. Not something I'd really recommend or seek out again."
"D: Not too bad, alcohol is not that present for 8% abv."
"D - I was impressed how easily, quickly I drank this. Great strong ale/imperial red. I will most definitely get this again."
"Held up to light Nosferatu has a great ruby red color with some off-white head that at first produces some elaborate lacing which eventually slides down the glass. Head retention itself was great, the lacing however did not maintain itself, but that doesn't really matter to me. Really strong citrus hops aromas with a rich malty background. I got some grapefruit coming through but balanced out with the malts, smelled fantastic. After a couple sips I couldn't help but think about just how balanced this beer is. While you get plenty of hops at first, they are never overbearing or offensive. The wet and sticky hop goodness is quickly followed by a slight sweetness and malt flavors. Very well carbonated but it still coats the tongue with it's flavors and character, after a while you get a little bit of alcohol warmth going down. Deceptively drinkable and delicious! I had only had this once before but will hopefully grab it a few more times before the season is over."
"Drinkability: Enjoyed this one a lot. Each sip followed naturally and easily and I'm sure I'll be seeking out this beer again in the future. It has found a place on my shopping list."
"D: This was an exceptional ale. Think of a West Coast hoppy red and kick it up a few notches. I really enjoyed the flavors that the malts brought to this beer. This is definitely and autumn seasonal I'll be going after again and again."
"D- Great Lakes continues to impress me with their brews. Nosferatu has completely drinkable and delicious properties. This will be a beer that I will forever keep going back to. I will grab a case of this for a Halloween get together no doubt!"
"D: The dry finish and pleasant character of this beer leaves you wanting more. If it weren't so darn expensive for a 4-pack, it'd be a session beer. But if you make six or seven figures a year - hell, enjoy!"
"D:I've heard a lot of people try to compare some brews with this (ie Arrogant Bastard) but really I don't think they are even in the same ball park. With this being easy drink with some decent flavor it is really only feeling average for me with nothing to great about it."
"Beer is very caramelly. Beer has a medium body and finishes cleanly. Overall its a little light on flavor. I guess strong ale I want it to be maltier or heavier. Drinkability is good but its too light."
"T - Very smooth taste without any distinct flavors aside from the standard ale taste. Definite hop taste with some bitterness. Overall good beer but lacks the character of other ales."
"Overall- Damn drinkable for an 8% brew! Really excellent to drink at the turning of the seasons. Sweet but bitter as hell. One of my favorite seasonals when I lived in Cleveland and definitely worth seeking this beauty out!"
"The drinkability is average. While the alcohol is not too overpowering, the hops can be over the course of the bottle. I could drink two, but by the end my palate would need a bit of a rest. However, I have a feeling that I'll be craving this with increasing zeal as the weather grows ever colder."
"Mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. The citrus flavor is a bit too bright for me, so the drinkability suffers a bit, but otherwise pretty good."
"Drinkability: Just a stellar beer. Seems like a Double IPA with a slightly different malt base. This has more than redeemed my faith in Great Lakes after my sub-par opinion of their Octoberfest."
"""Vampire pro: They live without lights, which really helps to conserve energy"" Vampires are earth friendly with green in mind."
"Had on tap at Mad Mex. Bartender said this was a worthwhile brew to try. Appears amberish in color with nice lacing clinging to the pint glass in ring set sequences. Smells mostly hoppy with pine, citrus, and peppery notes. Tastes mostly hoppy with a subdued malt backbone that's hidden behind this abundance of hops. Should this be an IPA? The strong ale label complexes me. Either way, it's a slow drinking hoppy beer with bitter mouthfeel and dry then sweet mouthfeel. Sees like a sipper to me."
"This is another excellent brew from Great Lakes, and worth seeking out."
"Notes: This beer has great flavor and depth, but it lacks a bit in body for the style. Overall, Nosferatu is a medium bodied brew that's tasty as Hell, and very easy to drink."
"D - Pretty decent at 8%, as I really don't feel much alcohol burn. The astringency from the hops detracts some. I think this should be brewed more regularly and it could be Ohio's own take on a beer like Arrogant Bastard."
"Overall a great ale from GL. Can't wait to get my hands on more of their brews. This is balanced and very enjoyable."
"Nasferatu is a beer that will bite your palate with flavor. But don't fight it, this isn't a monster of the bloodsucking kind. Instead, it's an imperial red ale that's sure to please the palate with rich, sweet, toasty malts and a coffin full of hops. An awesome beer and certainly deserving of all the praise it receives. Great Lakes was making this beer long before Twilight made vampires trendy, and it's (oc)cult following will continue long after the trend has passed."
"Poured a reddish-amber with minimal head. Should have been more aggressive on the pour. Nose is primarily piney hops, some grapefruit, malt sweetness lingering in the background. Bitter from start to finish. Hoppy to the extreme with faint caramel malt. Pine and grapefruit are overt in this wet finish. Hints of an imperial IPA, but not as assertive. Mouthfeel is lightish, drinkability moderate."
"Another truly World Class beer from Great Lakes. A big win."
"Another well made beer from CLBC. Its a late night beer! Its a beer that Id consume as fresh as possible; I had this last year, and after 2 months it wasnt this good."
"Overall: Well done balanced strong beer. The hops fruit and sweetness take you on a journey. The American citrus hops mix in with the chocolate almost tasting like a chocolate covered orange candy. I'm a big fan of Great Lakes and this beer just impresses me further."
"D- not the easiest to take down, could probably only have one of these every once in awhile, overall not a bad beer however for the flavors that come out of this i would much rather have a good stout"
"d- really great, i enjoyed this beer alot and was happy to have had the chance to try it. i would drink again for sure."
"Thanks to Ryan for hooking me up with this beer. Clear copper pour with a quickly fading head and not much lacing. This one is all malt in the nose. Lots of caramel and brown sugar with a really earthy side to it. The taste is malty sweet initially, but is soon dominated by the earthiness. The hops were absent in the nose, but they show up with lots of bitterness on the palate. The toasted malt gives decent balance, but that bitter hop bite lingers and overpowers for the most part. It's a bit too earthy to be very drinkable for me. Would have liked to have seen more balance, but not a bad beer."
"I'll update this review if my next experience goes better."
"Color is a beautiful, menacing amber red. Smell is of rich earthy malts, but also a bit metallic. Mouth feel is smooth, taste is a two-tone sweetness, finished off with over-ripe citrus notes for the hops. Very clean. All in all, for such a bad-ass beer, this one is pleasant in a dark/light sort of way. The label conjures up thoughts that otherwise sway opinion. It is not the monster it is made out to be.. it's actually quite pleasant. The best Great Lakes seasonal 4-pack so far.."
"This is definitely a finely crafted beer and one I will revisit in the future."
"D- Very easy drinker, I would have said it was more of an altbier though. Now that GL is distributed by me I'm looking forward to picking up some more."
"Let this warm up - my first sip just a couple minuets out of the fridge was way too cold. Hops are present here but take a back seat to the very nice and complex malt base. Very sweet and toasty it leaves my lips a bit sticky. The mouthfeel is very nice, carbonations is a bit high but not offensive at all. Overall a great beer although I don't know if I'd call it an Old Ale."
"Medium bodied. Low carbonation. Slick, smooth feel. Fairly easy drinker, though the finish is a bit harsh."
"Body: is medium and the finish is full. This is a really good strong ale lots of flavor thanks!"
"D-Overall this is a good, not great beer and I think I'd have to have another to see if it's worth putting on any kind of ""wants"" list."
"Follow up notes from tasting second bottle on 6/9. Hop flavors had subsided a little, but the result is that the overly sweet caramel malt flavors show up more strongly. I left my score the same, but would not seek this out again."
"Overall, this ain't too bad of an old ale/American strong ale, but it could use some more work and refinement. It exhibits the hop bite of a good barleywine, along with some rich fruity flavors, but the heat on the front end drags the general enjoyment of this beer down a notch."
"A nice brandy color with some orange-golden highlights. Smallish sandy head that fades quickly. Getting some chocolate, a bit of caramel, and some vegetal aroma that I'm not sure I like. Taste kicks you a bit, big malt flavors bookended with some herbal and floral hops. Hops linger with some herbal and piney notes. MF is a nice medium body, a bit of a dry finish, decent carbonation. Good drinkability, though I'm not sure that the taste is really what I'm looking for. Definitely more in the vein of a strong ale than an old ale. There are some really great parts of this beer, but then also some parts that I don't like so much."
"A nice beer; certainly unique to style with this being the hoppiest I've tasted to date."
"D: Good, tasty beer."
"I thought this was a slightly hopped up barleywine when I tried it. It's a good ale, but Old Ale is a category I've come to expect great things from."
"D - Been wanting to try this one for awhile, and it was pretty good, but not as outstanding as I had hoped. I'd have it again though, and perhaps try a younger bottle next time."
"D: When I first bought them I drank two and decided to age the other ones.. I am going to revisit this one in september and see how it developed and compare to a fresh one."
"D: It's not bad, just not my favorite for the style."
"D-big time lingering bitterness at the finish makes this a tough sell for a drinkable beer; but it is quite tasty and very creamy!"
"I want to try a fresh one to compare."
"Overall, nothing too standout-ish here from GL, but again, an excellent representation of the style like usual."
"The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some light carbonation."
"D: A superbly drinkable, though highly hopped, strong ale, not something I would expect to be 8% alcohol. Something I would love to see stuck in a barrel for a few months."
"D: The ABV would kill me after a while, but this IPAeque beer is vibrant and full of flavor. Hardly a dull offering from Great Lakes."
"D - Despite being rather potent it has very good drinkability. It's a high quality brew from Great Lakes that I'm glad to have access to once a year. Recommended."
"Nice thick finger plus head of mixed bubble sizes, dark tan in color, steadily dissolves, does leave broad streaks of lacing behind. Deep bronze color, translucent and holds the light inside well, more amber orange around the rims. Complex nose of caramel, honey, pine sap, white grapefruit pith, tea leaves, raisin bread, fig fruit, subtle kick from the grains. Medium-bodied, there's more foaminess than expected during the mouth entry, after that the carbonation settles down. While very much in balance, the hops come out ahead by a good bit, grains, pine, pressed flowers and an herbaceous bite evident throughout, especially at the end. That said, the strongest element is the white grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus. Milk chocolate, toffee, honey and clove drift in and out, never truly making it taste sweet at any given moment. Blend of apple, pear, peach, banana, cherry fruit, yet, with minimal sweetness. It's an unusual beer which certainly holds your attention."
"D: Strong, warming, and delish. 4s all around."
"D: I think this is a great mix between an IPA and a Old Ale. Really never had anything like this before. I would say to not cellar this since the weirdness is part of the fun. Really great and different beer."
"Although I haven't had one fresh I bet age has done this some wonders to this and toned down the hops considerably allowing the malty/chocolatey flavors to come forward. Thanks to smelleesell for the bottle!"
"Overall, a nice strong ale from Great Lakes. It's not my favorite of the style, but it's a good one none the less. I don't think if this was available to me it would be one of my regulars, but it was good and fun to try. Thanks again, Chris."
"It has a strong, yet ""drinkable", pleasing, well-balanced character. Malty with a bitter touch in the finish that keeps the malt flavor in the aftertaste."
"D: This is a wonderful beer from Great Lakes. Beautiful to look at, beautiful to drink, and worth seeking out. I'm equal parts impressed and surprised that the hops are still so fresh and robust after a few months. If you didn't catch it this year, be sure to pick it up the next time around."
"Very nice brew. Another great beer from Great Lakes."
"OVERALL a very good beer. Really tasty sipper. Thank you BuckeyeNation for the awesome trade and for providing me the opportunity to enjoy this fine beverage."
"Solid beer from a solid brewery. Great Lakes hardly every raises the bar but they are always in the game."
"A clear ruby-copper color with a giant fluffy off-white colored head and pretty good chunks lacing the side of the pint glass. The aroma has lots of malty oats and some thick nuttiness. I also pick up a nice peaty yeast, very nice. The flavor jumps out with a curious herbal hop with evergreen and malty evergreen with licorice hilights. But it's mostly a beautiful blend of herbal hops, roasted nuts and peaty malt. Delicious, one of the better stock ales I've had and this is arguably one of my very favorite styles. It's reasonably carbonated, mid-bodied and drinkable enough considering the ABV. Great stuff."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A fast pour resulted in a big creamy head that dissipates into some nice lacing. The color is dark amber, and the carbonation is nice and even throughout the beer. The main scent is a big, strong malt with some nice fruity smell underneath. It reminded me of dried apricots. The fruit flavor explodes in your mouth and, according to my wife, is almost too much if you don't know it's coming. Personally, I thought it was a nice treat. The sweetness causes the drinkability to be a little lower then normal, but it packs a punch so you probably shouldn't sit and slam them all day anyway."
"Oh, if only I had easier access to this wonderful beer. Luckily we may be making a return trip to IKEA in the next month or so. I will almost surely be stopping back into buy more of this brew. Will definitely be saving a few of these for a while."
"Overall a decent beer. Not real sure what a strong ale is ""supposed"" to taste like but a drinkable beer nonetheless."
"Impression: The alcohol was more present in the nose than the flavor, nice. The bitter was much more prevalent in the taste, nice surprise. I will get this again for sure."
"drinkability is good. this is a heavy and full flavored beer that goes down smooth and brings the warm character on the back end. very well done, and the hops hold up quite well for a couple months after brewing. cheers!"
"D - I think that dialing back the hop bitterness a notch would make this a better beer, but otherwise the execution is fine. Nosferatu is still good when you want something with the bite of an IPA but with more body and malt."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my perfect pint glass. Dark red in color with a thin off white head that laced nicely down the glass. Aroma has a lot of citrusness to it along with some sweetness. Taste is hoppy as well, some nice citrusness and nicely balanced with the sweetness and bitterness. Nice carbonation and mouthfeel as well. Another solid beer from Great Lakes that I would gladly drink again."
"Overall: Nosferatu is an interesting name for this one, sparks images of the old german villain but this surely isnt a german brew nor does it have much of a bite. It does have a nice bit of flavor but overall it isn't really something that would be my go to for the style."
"I poured into a pint to a good helping of beige head. It is redish orange in color. It has a defined hop presence. It is an acquired taste. I will have to drink the remaining 4 to see if I acquire a taste for it. This is not my favorite style but I am still an acolyte so I have years of research to do."
"Smellwise, I just really caught the whiff of alcohol. Taste was just kind of blase, nothing stood out. Not well hopped despite what some suggest. Its very bitter, but the hop taste profile gets lost. Seemed more of a maltbomb IMHO."
"D - Not something I'd want very often but it certainly has it's place. A well crafted and complex brew that touches on a lot of flavors. Between the alcohol and near-brutal bitterness of this beer, it's not all that drinkable to me."
"D- This beer is kinda a sipper, and any of the boozey flavors wear on my taste buds. I could have a few of these any day though, especially on a chilly night."
"This is far from my favourite beer from this brewery, but its yet another damn fine offering. The hops surprised me!"
"The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, with decent carbonation. Easy drinking, I had to drink them both. Very nice."
"Poured from a 12 ounce pint bottle into a pint glass. This is a brew I have drank each fall for the last few years. Ruby reddish color with a small head that leaves a sticky cob web like lacing on the glass. The Nosferatu has a slightly heavy mouth feel, the alcohol is somewhat noticable in the aftertaste. Pine, citrus, hops profile are tasty. But there is a good amount of malts that make this very balanced in my mind. I really enjoy this beer each year when it is released."
"HV"
"This beer poured a dark reddish amber with a big two-finger head. The smell is a mix of some lightly toasted malts with a bit of fruitness and a hint of the hops to come. The taste starts off with some lightly toasted toffee malt that is quickly overtaken by some fairly aggressive piney hops that clear away as quickly as they came on. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some light carbonation The heavy use of hop bitterness hurts the drinkability a bit. This is a really good beer, but not really what I expected from the label."
"M&D - a well rounded flavor, well balanced and with quality flavors, a medium body and smooth beer that is quite easy to drink, ive been on the lookout for this for a while and it did not disappoint"
"American strong ale is kind of a catch all category. If I had to get more descriptive with the style I would call it an imperial amber ale."
"A very unique style of beer with wonderful transitioning characteristics. Would I take it over Eliot Ness...depends on the day, but still a solid beer by Great Lakes."
"Pretty easy to drink, but not really sure what they are trying to do here. The beer is kind of all over the place and lacks refinement."
"Nosferatu is super-interesting, sort of like a hugely-hopped, fairly high-gravity red/amber ale. Or, sure, a strong ale, which is a wonderful catch-all for terrific beers like this. I'm glad I've had several of them over the past few weeks before reviewing, because it seems to take several solid meetings to comprehend. Did for me anyway. I love it, and I thank kels for bringing it back from the source. Cheers!"
"I really enjoyed being bitten by Nosferatu!!"
"D- This was pretty easy to drink, given the ABV. It's crisp, clean, somewhat bitter finish leads me to believe I could drink a few of these in a night."
"Terrific ale and I am rethinking my plan to age a couple, I quite enjoy the hop bite to balance the malt!"
"Notes: This was a very enjoyable beer."
"12 oz. bottle, served in a tulip glass. Pours a reddish copper color with a good, frothy, off-white head, lacing throughout. Aroma is caramel malts, fruits, grapefruit and pine hops. Flavor is sweet, caramel malts, a hint of wood, grapefruit and resin hops, and a hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter. Pretty good beer, very hoppy, I like it."
"Drinkability is high. This is good stuff overall. Great Lakes is really solid from what I've seen."
"Overall, I'm pretty satisfied. Not incredibly unique, but very enjoyable."
"Great beer all around. While not my favorite in regards to style it is very enjoyable. Drinks easy, alcohol is well hidden and non obstructive."
"D- Kinda reminds me of Arrogant Bastard, but not really as good. Not a bad beer though; definitely worth trying."
"Pours a deep red shade with an off white foamy head. As I drink some, it leaves a slight notch. Not the best lacing ever but decent. The smell is one of my favorite features of this one. Very hop heavy and the taste has lots of bit. The alcohol is a bit too heavy but not really worth mentioning. overall this is a great beer and i can't wait for next year already."
"Drinkability - with the high alcohol and the strong bitterness with this brew (it really is a beer with a bite to it) I have to stop at one. So strong in bitterness that I think it would be best with a meal or something to compliment the bitterness in smaller doses. Not exactly my thing but it grows on me as it warms up."
"Taste-Rich malt, nice backbone of citrussy hops-well balanced and very drinkable for the strength"
"This is a good beer, especially on tap. I expect the malt and hops to be big, but the fruit notes are a pleasant surprise (ok, I realize it tells me that on the bottle and I've had this a few years in a row, but still)."
"Overall, it a pretty decent beer, definitely not what I expected. It kind of reminded me of a big DIPA, but with more malts and a nice toffee profile. I am glad I got to try this one. For 8%, this is drinking fine."
"Had this at Great Lakes Brewery on 10-27-09 during the initial release of Christmas Ale for the year. Had a sample glass and found myself wondering why I was drinking the Christmas Ale. Great American Strong Ale in all aspects. S-A-S-M-D were all very well. This beer will bite you with its 8.0 ABV. May have to start stocking up on this one. Price is about 10 bucks for a four pack."
"Overall, this is an old stock ale with a huge kick of hops! Very complex, definitely a sipping beer to be enjoyed on a quiet autumn night. Cheers!"
"(D)- An interesting beer that catches you off guard. Has a good feel & balance to it. Another winner from Great Lakes. One of my top favorite fall beers thus far including Oktoberfests & wet hopped brews"
"Drinkability- The beer is surprisingly rich and big. It's like a mini old ale and honestly I wasn't expecting it in the least. Really, I wasn't 100% sure what kind of brew it was and this turned out nicely. Thanks much Adam!"
"Clear dark amber/ruby with a finger of rich off-white head leavings lots of lacing. Mine kinda did the Guinness thing where it left a distinct ring at each level I took a drink. Grapefruity hops really come through in the smell and the taste. Also get some pine. Pretty strong caramel malt sweetness balancing things out. Does give the feel of being somewhat thick (maybe more of a sticky feel.) I thought the alcohol was really well hidden...this one could most definitely get me in trouble. Great Lakes comes through again!"
"Too bad it's a seasonal."
"The smell has a definite hop presence, lots of citrus, and potentially rye. Flavor is very citrus like: orange, grapefruit, and bitter but balanced with caramel flavors. Medium bodied and fairly well carbonated.. alcohol is masked pretty well and this a decent drinkable beer."
"Poured into my snifter this beer appears a murky brown with small head that settles quickly around the glass. But when held up to the light Nosferatu is an appropriately-colored blood red. The glow it casts on to my hand is eerily beautiful. The smell is strong, hoppy, and rich and reminds me of a ""RyePA"". The flavor starts off similar to a bold IPA but finishes more subtlety with smooth malt. The mouthfeel is great and drinkability high with no noticeable presence of alcohol. For some reason this beer strikes me as a good one to sip around a fireplace in a plush robe while pondering the universe with good friends. Definitely a winner and one of my favorites from Great Lakes."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone, especially if you're a hophead."
"Great Lakes is having a great fall, with this plus their Oktoberfest."
"Pours a nice mid-copper color with some good initial head and a bit of nice lacing. Excellent scent, heavy and thick; malty; wonderful powdered cocoa aroma. Great taste, thick and malty with a nice hint of chocolate and a nice bit of floral hops. Goes down smooth, with a bit of thickness and just a bit of alcohol in it. Great beer."
"D- This is a two pint beer before I move on to something else. I will be sticking a couple of these in the cellar to see how they age. Good strong ale in my opinion but with so many other options out there I will have a couple before I run. Would recommend to someone who hasn't had it before. It will suprise you!"
"D- Balanced with lots of hop AND malt flavor. Reminded me a bit of a more balanced Arrogant Bastard."
"Rebecca was feeling the alcohol after just one sip. She mentioned she'd like to drink this beer in a rustic cabin in the wintertime while making a stew. It has a farmhouse respectability somehow, it's not trendy but it's solid and robust, worth every penny and delivering on each sip. A proud but not pompous beer that I would probably welcome into my snifter just about any night of the week."
"This was ok, but I was a bit dissapointed because I had higher expectations. There are much better stong ales out there."
"poured my bottle of Nosferatu into my beer tasting wine glass. The appearence is a very interesting red. Nice off white head with decent retention and lacing. The aroma is hop forward with evidence of well rounded malt. The taste is difficult to distinguish in my memory from Great Lake's Burning River, but there is more warming alcohol. Theres some citrus hops, some smooth rounded slightly caramel malt. Nice medium body, coats the tongue with a bit of lingering bitterness. This could be a wild one, with it's high alcohol and relative easy drinkability you're gonna need a ride home."
"Poured a reddish brown with a moderate head that just reduced to a collar. The aroma was cotton candy sweet with a backdrop of citrus. The taste was a balanced bittersweet, with an aftertaste leaning toward bitter. The feel was medium bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability was pretty good. I've been waiting for Nosferatu to come out and I have to say it was good, but not special. The store I purchased it at had 2 cases, so I hurried to sample. Not disappointed, but I won't be rushing back to buy more as the 4 packs are not exactly value priced."
"Overall, I think this beer could be better if the hops were a bit more mellow. Maybe some aging could help? Anyway, a good beer none-the-less."
"I know I'm definitely rating this beer below most people, but I just don't think it's that well-crafted. C+"
"Overall, this beer is excellent...a perfect beer for a cold night...it's warming, well-balanced, and delicious all around."
"Bottom line, this is an amazing beer and perfect for the season. The perfect setting for this beer would be around a fire in a desolate cabin deep in the woods. Excellent beer from an excellent brewery."
"Side Thoughts: I have liked every beer I have tried from Great Lakes and this one did not disappoint either. I like the hops in this beer, since it was not overly bitter. Maybe I am just developing a taste for hops who knows."
"D: Very nice. A good beer for the upcoming fall season, a good transition beer from the light wheats of summer, to the bigger bolder styles of the coming cooler season."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has an excellent mix of burnt toffee and hops. It has a stiff bitterness laid over roasted and caramel malts; yum. The taste is perfect! Wow, what a hop bite this one has. It's citrousy yet well balanced with a wonderfully complex malt bill. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a quaffable 8% beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an exceptional beer. I need to pick up a case of this."
"Overall, this is a perfect style for the fall season. Warming and comforting on chilly autumn evenings. Not overly sessionable, but that's probably a good thing considering the ABV."
"Drinkability- If not for that alcoholic bite, this would be a really solid drinker."
"Drinkability: I could easily, and dangerously, make this a session beer. It's big, but it's got enough flavor and drinkability and balance that's not overwhelming, and it drinks like a beer, to me, that's not 8% ABV. Another winner, not surprisingly, from Great Lakes."
"This beer goes down fairly quickly and I wouldn't mind finishing the rest of the four pack tonight. I'm sure I'll pick up a few more this season. Like most of the Great Lakes beers, Nosferatu doesn't push the envolope, but it is a solid example of the style they were going for."
"D: I'm not sure how I feel about this one in the end. It's a good beer but I can't say if I'd have another. It's complex but I'm not sure how the bitterness sits with me along with the malt. I prefer to have less malt with so much bitterness in the beer."
"D: The alcohol is not apparent in the taste but I did start to feel the effects. This has nice balance. Although the hops are the star, the malt provides a nice contrast that makes this fairly drinkable for the strength. I am excited to have the rest of a 4-pack left to drink and definitely made the right decision to pick this up."
"Notes: Definitely lived up the my expectations. One of my favorite new beers. A great combination of ale and malty lager flavors. If I could drink this every day I would. And you gotta love the theme. Nosferatu is a classic and this beer lives up the that reputation."
"D: Can't tell its high abv until you finish!"
"This is a beautiful brew, fantastically pure, clean, bright and exceptionally well-crafted."
"M/D: Medium-full body with enough carbonation to keep this one refreshing. Alcohol is hidden very well."
"mouthfeel is slightly heavier than medium bodied i suppose,nice sipper.probably my favorite GLBC bottled beer."
"I love the comment on the label about vampires being green - they live without lights, conserving energy (the Great Lakes folks are real tree-huggers)."
"Drinkability: Moderate - it's a great tasting beer, but it's a sipper and one you kind of want to drink slow and enjoy and savor the intense bitterness; the ABV is a tad high to want more than one in a sitting as well."
"This one pours a medium red with a quarter inch of white head. Smells mildly of caramel and malt. A pretty mild aroma, though--I had to really snort to smell anything. Tasted a malt, caramel, cinnamon, with an overall slightly sweet aftertaste. A great flavor. Carbonation was just right, and the 8% ABV was barely noticeable. I'm not really sure what a stock ale is, but this is a fine beer whatever the category."
"Pours a dark amber orangish color with a one finger head. The smell is of roasted malt and citrus hops, there is also a hint of fruit smell involved, deep fruits like plums or cherries. The taste is of bitter citrus hops up front overtop of a roasted malt backbone. The mouthfeel is of moderated carbonation. Overall it is a good drinkable beer, the alcohol is hidden well beneath the flavors."
"Before I start, I have to say that Murnau's Nosferatu is one of my favorite movies, so when I saw the cover of this beer way back when, I knew I needed to try it at some point along the line. Anyway, it pours a dark rosy color, with a little less than a finger of white heading. The head does seem to stick around for a while too. In the nose I get some maple syrup, roasted grains, toast and honey. Flavor has many of the components of the smell, however there is a more bitter hop taste going on here that almost comes across as burnt. The texture of this beer is medium, but rich in complexity. Although this is an older bottle, (best enjoyed by November of last year) it seems to have stood the test of time pretty well. Still, I would love to try a fresh bottle, and compare. This beer is a definite winner for me. I am almost inspired to throw on the Nosferatu DVD right now. Cheers to Great Lakes."
"Purchased from the Market Basket in Brookfield, WI. Pours a dark amber body with an orange tinted off-white head. Aroma of beet sugar and sweet hops. Full bodied with brown sugar sweetness that leads to a hoppy dry finish. Great drinkability, I always want a second when I finish the first one."
"A good brew nothing over the top about it but worth the drink. I easily finished this bottle as was wanting for more"
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed deep crimson color with at least an inch of creamy, lingering rust colored foam. Aroma and flavor consists of dominant grapefruit notes (both red and white), peel, pith, and all, followed by spicy sweet caramelized malts and medium toasted grains, more citrus and malt. Syrupy mouthfeel, bitter all the way into the finish. A modern classic of the style maybe?"
"D: I like where the taste profile is at with several months under the beer's belt. I wouldn't mind a fresh one, if only to taste the bite of the hops."
"Fairly thick mouthfeel. Carbonation keeps it smooth and drinkable."
"Pours a clear copper with an inch of thick tan foam. Nose is very malty with some big apple notes. Thick malty flavour on this one and a solid hop on the back end. There's some fruit and some coffee in this as well. Nothing stands out for this one, but is solidly drinkable. Smooth body, moderate carbonation. Didn't realize how strong this was until I finished and examined the bottle. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"A good solid beer and one I'm glad I had the opportunity to try. I had a couple of bottles, and thought it might improve with some bottle age. Have held this one back for around 6 months now, but can't say it's changed appreciably. Oh well..."
"I picked this up last month but noticed today the best before date 11/27/08 on opening. Higher ABV usually means longer storage capability, so I wasn't too worried about that. Red with a tan head, quickly receded to a thin wispy veil that covered most of the surface. The carbonation appeared quite low but a swirl quickly regenerated head and that was for the duration of the glass, impressive. Thin ring and minimal lace, but for the swirl. Earthy smell reeks of alcohol, corn mash, barley, caramel. Hops are yet apparent, high bitterness with a dryness, boozy but balanced. Warmth is unmistakable and the stronger alcohol puts me off a bit but behind that is a well balanced hop-malt bill that makes it all work rather well. This one was five months overdue, according to the brewery label, I'd love to try it again fresh. Also a pretty cool label, just don't store these near garlic."
"Full body with perfect carbonation and the alcohol holding back...this stuff is highly drinkable and I like it. A solid ale with some strength."
"Drinkability: Reminds me a bit of our local Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster. A fine beer to pair with the F. W. Murnau film, which I do own, I'll admit, but I opted instead to set it against tonight's Colbert Report. A fair base of malts with plenty of hops and bitterness (and alcohol), yet it still remains easily drinkable -- good job as always, Great Lakes."
"This is one tasty, tasty brew. I drank one of these about a year ago without knowing what it was beforehand and I was very impressed then. It remains one of my all time favorite beers and definitely my favorite from Great Lakes, which is a fantastic brewery in general, if you ask me. I love this beer and can't wait for my next!"
"Very drinkable beer, nice and light and flavorful, which makes it a delight to drink."
"D: It's a good beer, deep flavors, well-crafted. Doesn't entirely fit with my taste leanings, but that's ok. My second bottle (had once before - a year or so ago, didn't review), would have a third. Next time I should have one in the fall, right after release, just to compare."
"D: For the style and ABV this one goes down easier than I expected. A little more hops would have helped balance this one out from being quite as sweet. That would have helped the drinkability for me."
"D - A good sipping. I've had a couple of these in a sitting, but it's very rich, very bitter, and has an 8% ABV. As far as sipping goes, it's top notch: very complex and well-balanced."
"Drinkability is good. The flavor can be a bit strong after a bottle, and as such I wouldn't reccomend it for sessions. Otherwise, throw this back with a nice barbecue dinner."
"Nosferatu will bite you on the neck and damn your soul for all eternity. He will not let up. His hop bite is strong from start to finish. The color is blood red. You won't see your reflection in his thick creamy head. The smell is earthy not unlike a cold dark crypt in Transylvania. Give this creature of the night a shot next time you see him."
"D-Pleasant and warming. A satisfying, clean ale."
"A very nice beer with lots of complexity but still drinkable."
"Another very good brew from GREAT LAKES."
"I would seek out and buy this again, glad I have three more."
"D. Pretty good for an ale of such strength. More bitter than anticipated. A bit more roasted malt flavor could do to balance this, also more some brown sugar too?"
"Another quality brew from GLBC. Love the label and love this beer. I'll be putting a few aside for sometime next year. This should mellow out nicely."
"This is the first truly hoppy beer I ever had and to it, I owe my new found interest in IPAs. It's definitely a gateway brew in my opinion."
"Great Lakes always blows my mind - they get such remarkable richness, depth, and diversity, while still observing the Bavarian Purity Law. I'd recommend this brew - even significantly after the ""best before"" date."
"Pours a deep caramel amber with a nice thick head and good lacing. Looks astonishingly similar to the homebrewed Cal Common I just had in this glass. Aroma is.. wtf.. hops.. malt.. and brett? You get a faint trace of fruity hops and some crystal malt but along with an almost overwhelming funkyness. Not really sure what to think. A little raisiny but it also smells like a sewer. Maybe the taste will clear this up. Strong on the alcohol at first with a good raisin character. Finishes very dry with a slight lingering hop bitterness and acidity from the alcohol. Maybe some honey or candy sugar in the front too. Has some Belgian qualities to it.. but to me that just mean it tastes a little like windex. Exceptionally smooth. By now the head has given way to the alcohol. I'd say this beer turned me off at first but I grew to like it quickly. An interesting and daring take on an American Strong Ale. They don't go overboard in any one direction but definition create something very definitive and unique."
"Pours a hazy deep amber color with a slight head but the head remains as well as a great sticky lace. Nose is surprisingly sweet malty and quite hoppy with a smoked quality.Great body and mouthfeel, silky and smooth. Roasted malt,caramel,and piny hop taste . I deem this stuff ''The Bomb'' Malty goodness with a bite."
"Seek this out."
"Not really a beer that I would have in a session, but could be done if you had the time. I recommend for a nice cap on a winters day/night."
"D - A phenomenal strong ale - great synergy and just doesn't taste like 8%. This is something I could drink year round - the hoppy red style, like an IPA is one I can't seem to tire of and I consider this to be one of the best in the pack."
"Taste actually has some of that tea characteristic but first hits you with a blast of hops that is well balanced and doesn't leave you too bitter. Rather enjoyable and masks it's alcohol content well. Medium body and low carbonation."
"This beer is a fine example of a good red ale. It's flavorful, with lots of strong hop taste (more than cascade!), and the caramel and crystal malts buck up the typically thin mouthfeel Great Lakes beers tend to have. It's a shame this brew's only a seasonal; it'd be one I'd have readily available otherwise. It should be noted that because of the high sugar levels and thin mouthfeel I can't give it superlative ratings. It is a great beer, though."
"Overall a pretty good beer, but not what I was expecting from a stock ale. I would call this more of a strong American craft ale than anything else."
"D- i could easily have several of these in a sitting. a great hoppy amber. too bad this one is only a seasonal. check it out if you havnt had it yet."
"The body was mostly malty though, nice caramel, toffee, maybe a bit nutty but overall pretty rich, creamy and slightly sweet. I enjoyed this brew. Glad I got two of them, I'll let the other one go for a little longer and see what happens. It was definitely a solid brew, even at this age, with a nice label to boot."
"Pours a beautifully clear red copper color with a smallish bubbly off white head that leaves mad lace on the way down. Smells of citrus, grapefruit, heavy hop aroma. Slight caramel in back if I strain my nose a bit. Taste is caramel malt up front, grapefruit and hops mid to finish and linger on for a bit. The taste isn't as bitter as the aroma leads you to believe. Creamy oily mouthfeel, thick body, moderate carbonation. Great stock ale. Lots of hops but some malt to back it up."
"Very drinkable, but definitely a sipper."
"Thanks, Auslander, for introducing me to now one of my favorite brews...that I can't get locally. Double dang!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: A nice mix of chewy malt and resiny hop flavor, with malt taking the slight edge. Rich caramel sweetness and a touch of pineapple precede the oily, bitter finish. Full-bodied, a bit too heavy on the residual sugars for my liking, but a very nice beer all the same."
"This beer isn't for everyone but for most afficiando's it will garner respect."
"Interesting stuff for a nighttime sipper; promise of the noses does not entirely deliver, though. Overall a lot less sweetness on the palate than the well-balanced aroma would indicate. Maybe I'll keep 1 or 2 of these down for a bit and see what happens."
"D- I would probably have thought 6 or 6.5% as opposed to 8%. I get no alcohol in the taste nor do I get much alcohol warmth. Highly drinkable."
"This beer pours a hazy dark amber color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes very slowly into a firm half inch cap of lacing which sticks around until the beer is gone. The aroma is piney hops and caramel malt. The taste is quite a bit hoppier than the aroma. Tons of pine, with hints of grapefruit, and nice undertones of caramel. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer that I could easily drink again."
"Morey's bottom line: A very unique and tasty beer. Probably the hoppiest strong/stock ale that I've ever had. I had it on-tap once, and it was even better."
"D - Alcohol is very well hidden - tastes and feels like a 6% to me. I could have 3 or 4 of these in a session. Really like it!"
"Bottle: I gave on-tap an A. The bottle falls short. A part of the impact of the on-tap was how big malt and hops were and how well balanced it all was. The lack of hops in the bottle throws off the balance and allows the alcohol to have too much focus. Still a really enjoyable and interesting beer. Like always, once you try on-tap, it's tough to go back to the bottle."
"D: Very drinkable in moderation; combination of ABV, big body and carbonation."
"D: Pretty solid, the bitterness does take away a bit from the drinkability, though."
"The mouthfeel is medium as is the carbonation, and it finishes grassy hop style. Good taster and I don't think I've had brews that come close to reminding me of this. I like this one a lot!"
"A delicious beer!"
"The flavors in the brew itself are much more pronounced than they are in the scent. There's a huge malt sweetness up front then a ESB like bitterness shows up soon afterwards with more that a dint of alcohol hotness in the end. Firm, creamy body but overall though not a whole lot of complexities and something seems just not there. Maybe it's the weird spicy bitters characteristics that stick around too much that are leaving me a little put off."
"Na Zdravje!"
"M/D - Although this one was very good, i would not be able to drink many. The booze was very strong to me."
"edit: I was still tasting grapefruit an hour later."
"D- This is a very hoppy, borderline DIPA strong ale. I tried it last year and could not tolerate it at all but find it pretty good and refreshing this year. Decent beer overall...if you like unearthly or that grassy/herbal hop presence over citrus then this beer is for you."
"D: very nice brew, but I am sure it is really ""hot"" rather fresh. the age did a great job with this one. very nice and drinkable, the abv mellowed really nicely."
"D - Tsaty hoppy red ale with quite a bit of citrus character, giving it more of an IPA character overall."
"Drinkability: Fairly good thanks to the carbonation and lack of any overbearing flavors."
"wow, 368 reviews as of this writing. I thought I'd try this after I had put up some halloween decorations. Yeah, may be lame but you gotta decide on a beer somehow. blended citric maltyness that lingers with a definite abv punch to round out this bottle. an interesting brew worth trying regardless of all hallow's eve status."
"Drinkability: What an outstanding beer, and a definite winner from Great Lakes. Almost a DIPA in many ways, the alcohol is not only average for the style but expertly hidden, it's balanced, tasty, interesting, and complex - mark this one as highly recommended. Shame it's a seasonal, too - stock up while you can. I'm sure this one would turn into a whole different beer with a little bit of age on it."
"This is a fantastic beer. Incredibly drinkable, and achieves a balance that many DIPAs fail to. Tons of hops, but very smooth. Mmmm, this hits the spot."
"Yum. I recommend this beer to any BA out there, hophead or otherwise."
"Taste I thought was good except for the strong bite at the end. I couldn't get past it and it's safe to say one was enough for me."
"D-A healthy dose of Simcoe and other citrus inducing hops I am sure....bring it on! This years version, 2008, is without question the finest I have had the pleasure of imbibing. Drink it up and drink it fresh, those hops aren't going to last!"
"Overall, another impressive brew by GLBC. Now if only I would have taken more advantage of this place when I lived in Cleveland, especially since I went to the high school right next to the brewery."
"4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5"
"Drinkabilty is moderate. Enjoyable in moderation due to strong flavors, heavier body, and high carbonation."
"Pretty good stuff, I will enjoy drinking the remaining three."
"Highly drinkable, nothing that makes me say wow, but a wonderfully balanced sipper that would warm me up on a cold night. I will buy this again."
"Since I've liked every other Great Lakes brew I've purchased thought I'd try this one based off the name and the time of year. Has a strong bitter taste with hints of peach that become more prominent as the beer warms. I really need to make a better habit of checking ABV %s before I have a couple. Found the beer for its strength very easy to drink and very pleasant and am certain to look for it in the future."
"Overall: good, but no scent"
"12oz. bottle: this one pours a clear mahogany color. It had a small tan head on it that left no lacing. The aroma is a touch sweet, and perhaps a bit light. There are notes of caramel and an ambiguous fruitiness, as well as a whiff of pine. Perhaps some spices in there also. Definitely a hop bite to the taste. It is somewhat piney. A pretty good malt backbone in there to balance out the hops. This is well balanced beer."
"D - this is a very easy drinking strong ale, watch out for the higher abv."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: This beer was very enjoyable to me. ""Non-extreme"" beers tend to bore me this time of year though... I wish I could get this in keg format all year long!"
"D - overall this is a good beer. Very drinkable especially given the 8% ABV. I could see myself getting in trouble with this one since you don't feel the alcohol until it smacks you right in the forehead. Good taste, mouthfeel, smell and look all adds up to another great great lakes beer"
"This was my first experience with Great Lakes, and after the high expectations going in, I was certainly not disappointed."
"This is one fine ale - it pours redish brown with a couple of inch, thick head that laces beautifully. The head retention is fantastic - after ten minutes I still have about 1/8"". The smell is piney hops with some underlining malts tones and a bit of yeastiness. The taste here is oh so smooth for such a high alcohol beer - plenty of drying hops with bready malts to balance things out. The only other Strong Ale I have reviewed is Stone's Arrogant Bastard - I like this beer better for its balance though I am not sure I could drink more than two of these in one night. Another well done brew from Great Lakes."
"Mouthfeel is clean and biting."
"Pours a clear amber with minimal off white head. Aroma is medium sweet, some spice, earthy, herbal, grapefruit and caramel malt. Flavor is grapefruit, herbal, piney, sweet malt and other fruits. Medium body. Nice long bitter finish. Probably one of the better Stock Ales I have had in some time."
"Another awesome offering from Great Lakes Brewing Co., one of my new favorite breweries."
"I wish I had enough of these to share at the Halloween party. This is a good beer."
"Notes: I had learned of some interest in this beer from BA and since I was at the brewery I thought that I would step out of my usual comfort and try this very hoppy beer. This experience will discourage me from doing that again soon. I cannot recommend this unless you are a serious hop head!"
"Up front this brew is delightful, but I don't think it's the most drinkable beer ever for two reasons; the mouth is really dry in the aftermath of the brew. The second reason is the strong alcohol; ouch! Yummy, but I think if I drank more than two I'd be on my ass pretty fast."
"Overall, very drinkable. Looking forward to comparing to the 2007 bottle that I picked up a while back."
"D - Great beer. This lived up to the hype."
"Well carbonated beer makes it easier to drink than you would normally find with this abv. Not a session beer but mainly because you would be on the floor. I really wanted another though."
"another great lakes favorite :D"
"This case wont last me too long."
"D: Oh my, this is one of the best stock or session ales I have had in a long time. This is one you can sink your teeth into over and over again."
"D= I absolutely loved this beer. Anyone who loves Stone Arrogant Bastard needs to try this ale. I see myself drinking a lot more of this outstanding seasonal offering from Great Lakes."
"D - Lets be honest here. Its a seasonal beer, right? Comes in a four pack so I figure one for every weekend of October. Any more and I wouldn't be able to tolerate having a Xmas tree in my house come December."
"D: Any easy sipper at 8% ABV, not incredibly bitter, or sweet. A very balanced, decently complex beer that is worthy of accolades."
"Crazy hop madness, this vampire has just drained me of tastebuds. This stuff is exactly what it says it is - Beer with bite. The hops jump out and scare the sh*t out of you (ok, I'm taking that a bit far). Full bodied and I mean full bodied like a set of D cups, dark red almost bloodlike, the head is pronounced and lacing is quite nice, leaves a level of lacing like the bathtub ring of a child that has been playing in the mud all day. This beer is incredible. Finishes with a bizarre roasted apricot / molasses taste and a very pronounced alcoholic ending. Good but absolutely not worth $10 for a 4 pack. For that reason alone I cannot recommend more than a single serving."
"Drinkability: Not a session beer (for me, anyway), but I would say the drinkability is pretty high. I love it with food with strong flavors."
"Eric"
"Drinkability: Not a session beer but a very solid brew that should fit in any night of drinking."
"D ~ BIG BEER! with a BIG BITE. The drinkability is ONLY diminished by the ABV. Worth seeking out if you're willing to venture into the night. Make sure you bring a wooden stake & load up on silver bullets."
"Pours dark ruby brown in color with a nice inch of off white head. Not necessarily lacing on the side of the glass, but there's definitely some suds left. Smell is somewhat muted hops and plenty of caramel malt. Taste reveals much more hops than what appears in the nose. This is very bittering and piney hops in flavor. Clean and non-cloying in the mouthfeel. This is very bitter. Decent fall beer from GL."
"This is probably my favorite strong ale so far. It has a really nicely hopped profile with good balance and great red color. I would however recommend trying this at the brewery if you can since I this it would easily qualify as exceptional."
"Thank you again Dave!"
"Very good American Ale and deifiantely worth a try."
"Would make a nice answer to an after-dinner port wine. Another solid offering from our friends at GLBC."
"Not an everyday beer, but certainly something to go to when in need of balance and a nice hop bite."
"Could drink several of these, often. Another excellent brew from the best brewrey in America."
"D- This is a solid brew. Highly recommended and very drinkable."
"Overall, this is a special brew. It is a strong ale but has a nice hop kick and is very smooth"
"I'm endlessly pleased that I just drank a beer called Nosferatu."
"Stock Ale with a Vampire on the label, leave it to Great Lakes to always entertain me with their brews. This seasonal is very nice but not over the top. Good hearty aroma, wine-like sharpness with a generous helping of hops. Pour is a medium dark ruby red with some amber tones, minimal head and little lacing. Due to the higher abv I can't complain too much about how this looks. Mouthfeel is powerful and unbelievably clean it hits you then melts away. Hops-a-plenty round out the high maltiness creating a nice sipper of a brew. Bitter and citrusy at first you think this doesn't work but as you go forward it all melds too easily. I like this ale very much."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer. It is closer to a Barley Wine in flavor and finish than it is an Old Ale. But still, it says that it is an Old Ale. Regardless, it is a pretty good high octane beer. As far as Old Ales go, I would take numerous others over this one, but as a Barley Wine, it is a pretty good beer."
"Props to brandoman63 on the trade, been wanting to try this one for over almost 2 years! Pours a nice crisp amber with a decent head that lasts as a thin layer that lasts as a thin layer and leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is burnt caramel, brown sugar and a hint of molasses. The taste is a wonderful balance of brown sugar, caramel malts and pine hops that quickly give way to a sweet brown sugar finish, but then mysteriously return at the back of the tongue a few seconds later. The beer is medium bodied with a nice crisp bite that is not aggressive at all. This is certainly an enjoyable beer that truly lived up to my expectations."
"Overall, this was a decent beer and I would recommend it."
"Pours a deep tea hued amber color with a full finger foamy light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of lacing in its wake. The smell is a balanced fragrant hop and caramel malt mixture. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. The hop character is strong and it gives it a lively spark while the sweet caramel malt puts a nice smooth spin on it. Full flavored, the grapefruit and pine resin taste battle with the caramel malts. Scores points for imagination and creativity in my book. A real easy drinker, the 8% ABV is integrated well. Recommended."
"D- Alcohol definitely well hidden. This could be in the stone arrogant bastard category if it had more body. Will drink again, regardless."
"I hope you get the chance to enjoy your own bottle of Nosferatu--whether fresh or aged. I truly think it is one of the best beers made by an American brewery."
"Interesting, like a good strong ale should be. The main elements here are the chocolate biscuit malts and the grassy and citrus hops. The appearance is a dark red with off-white lacing. The aroma focuses on grassy hops with a hit of sharp grapefruit and peel. The hops are interesting and seem to have a celery note. I can't decide if I like how they work with the malt, but like I said, it's interesting. Definitely worth a try if you dig strong ales."
"It is THE BEER WITH THE BITE"
"M&D: Medium body beer, with a bitter finish."
"Pretty good beer. I'm definitely going to be on the lookout for when this comes out again."
"Drinkability - This a great brew. It is very easy drinking. I will definitely search this one out again."
"Smooth, rich, full body with medium-low carbonation. Very satisfying and pretty drinkable considering. Would be truly excellent with a few less IBUs."
"D, notes: This is definitely a sipping ber. I would have liked a little more malt balance."
"My glass was down to halfway just a few sentences in to this one. Goes down way too easy. I really want another one, and regret not digging out that entire bin for the remainder of these. As you can see by these scores, I wouldn't have any reservations about aging this beer. It's delicious. This reminds me quite a bit of Southern Tier's Big Red, although this is a bit more toned-down. This could be the aging speaking. Will definitely appeal to fans of red beers."
"Transluscent maroon colored pour with a yellowish-beige head. Smell is sweet, bright fresh hoppiness. Very nice. Taste is creamy and smooth at first sip with a nice big hop kick, mild bitterness, and ample malt backing. Tastes like slightly alcoholic hopped melted caramel squares. Unique, very drinkable, and just writing about it now makes me want the other I've got waiting for me. Nice beer all around and I can see upping it a notch or two on a rerate."
"The fruity estes add a nice complexity to this beer while maintaining a nice balance. I will visit this brew again."
"Delicious!"
"Pours a very slightly fogged brown amber with a yellow/tannish head. It slowly falls and leaves a fairly large amount of lacing on the way down. Nose is malty caramel with a minor earthy edge and also a minor alcohol tone as well. Flavor is unusually dry. It almost seems like this is wood aged. Just loads upon loads of wood. Barely noticeable alcohol. Feel is fairly full bodied on the liquid and has a bit of a biting carbonation as well. For being so high in abv and also being ""the beer with bite", this one goes down very smooth."
"D: Very disappointing, especially after loving the appearance and smell, the taste and mouth feel."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and very, very smooth. Carbonation is excellent. Very drinkable despite its somewhat high abv. Very nice offering from Great Lakes. If only it were available year round...."
"For taste I wish I were better at explaining different hops but the hops come through as just bitter. You don't get that awful grape fruit flavor that many IPA's are using today. This is mixed with a strong ale (reminds me a bit of third coast ale) instead of the normal strong malt finish of say 90 minute you get a nice crisp yet sweet finish with a nice bit of alcohol backing it. For a beer of this size and strength the mouthfeel and drink ability match it perfectly. You can easily drink 2-3 of these without realizing it yet even on the first you know that you probably shouldn't keep drinking them all day."
"Very well balanced beer. I would describe this as an IPA with a greater than usual carmel malt prescence, if that makes sense. I like the mix of the carmel-like sweet malts with fairly strong hops prescence, which is unique. Very drinkable as the ABV is well hidden."
"I'd love to do a blind tasting of this along with Big Hoppy Monster, Lagunitas Impy Red and Hop Rod Rye."
"D: complex beer, but still highly drinkable. surprised to see that this was 8%. Will seek this out again"
"This is one I will be on the lookout for annually as its a nice change from the Marzens and pumpkin ales that abound this time of year."
"Pours a clear rich red/copper color with soapy off-white head and good lacing. Smells of citrus, toasted malt, and some caramel sweetness. Caramel sweet up front cut off sharply by an attack of grapefruit. Some spices mix in along with a slightly warm alcohol presence. Medium in body with good carbonation and a good hop stick to the palate. A good ale, similar to Arrogant Bastard, but a little more grapefruity, almost seems more like it should be an Imperial IPA than a strong ale."
"D - A really nice beer, but I would almost class it as an IPA or PA, and less of a stock ale. Didn't have any of the alcohol burn I would expect with a stock ale."
"A great beer to scrath a hop itch if you've grown tired of the IPA's."
"Great lakes brews awesome beer and this is right up with the best of them."
"Beautiful and notable clear red amber color with half inch head of finely bubble foam, plenty of lacing. Gentle aroma of hops and malt with a surprising mouthful of flavor. Tastes sweet at first but the sweetness is backed of by a pile of hoppy bitterness. To my tastes this is very nicely balanced. A full mouthfeel with fine prickly carbonation that leaves you wanting more of this fine ale. If I was drinking this blind I would call it an IPA the next thing I would call for would be another one."
"Drinkability is high and this is quite tasty. Once again, nicely done by Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: A really fine ale that balances nicely between the malt and the hops"
"This was tough to rate. Didnt look at other reviews to see if what i feel are off flavours are present in fresher tasting or not. I went nice on this brew as i suspect the off flavours present were my fault for sitting on this too long."
"Nosferatu is another good beer froom Great Lakes. I guess that goes without saying. I believe the American Strong Ale category is designed to be a catch-all of sorts but this beer is more along the lines of a IIPA. Great Lakes calls it a Stock Ale. Try one and decide for yourself."
"Drinkability is good, but there are huge flavors and a sizable ABV."
"Recommended."
"d: I wish this was available in my area. Thanks to brandoman63 for the sample."
"D-Damn fine strong ale...great sipping beer with character, flavor and drinkibility."
"Yeah, I'll have another! Not really sure why it's taken me this long to have a first one....Really well balanced, very enjoyable beer!"
"Poured with less head then others have eluded to but the head did not completely dissipate- a copper, red color. smell is rather pleasant and there is a strong fruity scent- somewhere between grapfruit and grape as pointed out by others. taste was not as pleasant as expected. strong hops flavor but much less of the fruit suggested by the scent- the alcohol content is not well hidden- i've had worse but i've had much better,even at 9-10%. mouthfeel is average and the beer is easiy drinkable but i'd stop after a couple. wondering what it tastes like on tap . . ."
"Perhaps it is just me, but there is some balance lacking here. Still pleasant."
"Notes: Like everything Great Lakes brews, this is a quality beer. Although I really like this beer, I'd like it if it was a bit more distinguished from the Commodore Perry IPA, maybe a little more emphasis on the malts. I don't know what it's lacking, it's just not as clearly defined stylistically as other seasonals are, or for it's $9 a 4-pack price."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer from this company."
"Bright and clean but still moderately heavy on the tongue. Low to moderate carbonation that increases to clean up a pronounced warmth in the finish."
"D: Overall, pretty good. I can somewhat feel and taste the 8% ABV, but the taste is intriguing enough to make me want more."
"Nosferatu is slowly overtaking Christmas Ale as my favorite Great Lakes brew. If only everything to come out of Cleveland was this good. Like the name implies this beer has bite."
"Excellent hoppy flavor, like an IPA but it is actually a red beer. Loved it. Nosferatu has great color. I poured it into a Sam Adams beer glass (the one with the wide mouth) and it was very impressive in flavor. If you like red beers and also like IPA's then you will definitely like the Nosferatu by Great Lakes. I am a big fan of all of the Great Lakes beers I have had so far."
"Overall a tasty and potent strong ale. Remarable drinkable considering the ABV."
"D-This is a nicely balanced strong ale. It drinks easily without being insufficient. A good flavour without being heavy or syrupy."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a reddish amber, 1 cm tan head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is hop dominated, citrus and a little spice. Initial taste is balanced between bitter hops and some indistinguishable malt flavors. Closing taste and aftertaste are both bitter with the amount of hops involved. Medium bodied, almost no carbonation. Hidden alcohol and drinkable. Might be the best offering from Great Lakes."
"Since hop drives this brew, it stays with you awhile, for that reason, my drinkability score shows it."
"Pours a clear deep chesnut with a full two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a nice layer. Stickiness is a web of goodness, very attractive beer to look at. Smell is of earthy hop deliciousness with a sublte caramel malt background. A slight hint of evergreen nectar tingles the nose as well. Taste is a wonderful blend of malt and hop. Up front is a leaf-like autumn hop profile with some toasted barley and sweet caramel. Aftertaste is nutty wood flavor that has a tingle of grapefruit. Slick medium bobied mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Wow, this is my new Fall seasonal beer for sure. Pumpkin Ales?...no thanks. Marzens?...I'll pass. Oktoberfests'?...um, nope. Nosferatu?...More please!!! I gotta get more of this stuff before the snow starts falling."
"Overall it's fighting Arrogant Bastard for my favorite American Strong Ale, and could quite possibly be my favorite Great Lakes beer."
"While this isn't my favorite of the GLB's...it is certainly a good choice. If you like Arrogant bastard but are looking for better drinkability...this is it. Chocolate and bitter up front. Huge head that retains well. Deep red color. Starts off very piney but finishes smoother than any 8%rrr I've ever had. This at 8% and the Oktoberfest at 6.5ish...now there's two beers that can get you in trouble because of the high abv and the extremely high drinkability. Nice florals in the aftertaste and the sweetness lasts much longer than many other reds. moderate carbonation. seems about right. Something gives it a little bit of a metallicness....something I've not experienced with their other offerings....GooD...But Not Spectacular."
"I would drink this again. One of the better red beers out there."
"Wow, this beer certainly does have bite! It reminds me alot of some hoppy ambers I've had but that thick mouthfull and punched up ABV certainly bump it up into the Strong Ale area. Definitely not a beer I would have more than one of in a sitting but rather one to savor and warm up with during those cold Fall evenings."
"Drinkability is good."
"If this were the nectar I needed to survive by sucking the necks of beautiful women or big brown bottles the world round then let it be so. This stuff's better then blood any day, or night. Mmmaaaawww...HaaaaHaaa..."
"Pours a clean deep amber-ish color with a light tan head. Aromas of a dry fruitiness and a hint of hops. In the taste, a dry fruitiness and a small hop bitterness, and a bit alcoholic. A watery mouthfeel and a dry hoppy aftertaste. A nice fall into winter beer. Nice hop presence and smooth, yet a small abrasiveness."
"the flavor is very malty, caramel, hop spice, hint of mint, fading out to lingering orange rind fravor."
"Pours an Amber, light brown color with a creamy off white head. Head remains for a long time on this one with a slim amount resting on top. Smell is of citrus and some floral aroma with a biscuit type malt aroma in the background. Taste is sweet with a bitter finish. Some spices are present and a little salty soy sauce flavor is picked up halfway through the session. Thick mouth feeling with a creamy, syrupy and metalic finish."
"Lots of caramel malt, earthy dry hops in the finish. Fairly strong, but the carbonation keeps it rolling smoothly. Cerealish malt taste comes through briefly but gets washed over by the large hop load. Aftertaste is dry and herbal, mildly bitter. Tasty and super drinkable, despite the higher abv."
"D- clean and refreshing with a hoppy bite, easily chuggable. but watch out, that 8% abv ain't no joke."
"D- Way way better than I remember. Delicious and highly recommended. Having this did give me some deja vu of some better times- I love that."
"drinkability - I can drink this all night thought its 8% abv does catch up with you. It is frustrating that it is only sold in 4 packs but that is life."
"In 1922 F.W. Murnau gave us Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens, one of the finest silent films and an excellent horror film to boot. Great Lakes Brewing Company has chosen to use both the name and the image of Murnau's vampire for this beer. Where Nosferatu the film was an innovator, the beer version falls short. By no means a bad beer, Nosferatu just falls short. The color is almost ruby-like with decent head formation but little retention. There is plenty of stickiness and lacing. The smell and the taste are both sweet and fruity. There is a hint of chocolate in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel is not rich enough for this style, which therefore hinders the overall drinkability. A fine strong ale with a marketing gimmick close to my heart. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Recommended. I will search this one out again. I think that I like Arrogant Bastard a bit (just a little) more for an American Strong Ale."
"Overall: Definitely a very hoppy strong ale, brewed entirely in the American tradition."
"Pours amber brown,with a thin white head. Not much in the way of retention,and just a bit of lacing.Aroma is of piney hops and grapefruit. This is a medium bodied beer with some carbionation. Taste is of bitter fruit, earthy,and piney this is a big tasting ale!"
"I've been waiting for this one to be released since I've been back in the Mid-West. Finally it shows up. Pours a deep amber-brown color with two fingers of tan head on top. Lots of lacing. Looks great. Nose is alcohol, candy, light sweet malt, cranberries. Nice strong aromas coming off of this one. Flavor is similarly interesting and powerful. Lots of grapes and crazy fruits of all varieties, light drying hops, and a touch of alcohol. Solid flavor. Body is full and creamy with perfect carbonation and a nice long aftertaste. This one is a really excellent beer, I'm looking forward to finishing my four-pack."
"Pours a dark ruby color with a nice amount of foam which takes its time to settle down, also has some good lacing. Hop aromas of grapefruit, citrus and pine are well represented as well as some dark fruits and sweet cherries. Some caramel and toasted malts support the hoppy profile to make a nice salad of citrus, dark fruits, and biscuit and caramel malts. Taste is similar to the aroma, which is good. I get some dark and ripe fruits with some sweet and malt finish. Hop bite is more subtle than I expected from the aroma. Mouthfeel is just a tad on the thin side but the carbonation is very good and helps to hide the alcohol wickedly well."
"D: With as balanced as this beer is, I could definitely drink a bunch of these. I think if you served at 35 degrees(to dumb down the bite a bit), you could spark new ideas and interest in the bud swindlers. I'll try to convince a friend to buy a 6... because I'm not giving up any of mine :D"
"Overall-My favorite Great Lakes brew along with the blackout stout. A beer I could enjoy every day of the week!"
"Snappy, wet & refreshing. Highly recommended."
""
"This American strong ale is dangerously drinkable. Nice nutty flavors to it, as it pours a beautiful bloody, red colour with nice hop aroma to the white pillowy head. Don't know how Great Lakes does it, but this beer is full of hops, yet so damn balanced, it is amazing. The finish is long and deep and dominated by toasted and biscuity malt, with nice hoppy bitterness. I love this beer, wish it were more readily available."
"This is an excellent beer to look at and drink. A real Halloween treat!"
"Drinkability: Awesome for a beer of this strength. seek it out and you won't be disappointed. cheers!"
"Pours a dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy head which does not last long, some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, vanilla, cheeries, and caramel. The taste is a big malt bomb with a nice touch of hops, the vanilla gives it a nice sweetness and the cheeries give a nice tangyness, lots of caramel. There is a nice bite/bitterness to this brew. Medium body, a well rounded, complex brew. Very drinkable, another great tasty GL brew, very drinkable."
"Very nice,almost blood red color. Sharp, metallic aroma-has a real bite to it and I am not trying to be funny. Smooth, very malty flavor with just enough bite in there to make you take notice. Very caramel and toffeeish. I get a minor alcohol tinge as well. Nice body. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Great US example. Not the big, winey and booze filled attempts I am used to."
"Md body isn't as creamy as I'd like for this beer to really be a killer. I guess the hop oils and alcohol sting fight against it."
"Cheers!"
"D: Very tasty combination with lots of flavor. Probably not the best beer for drinking a lot of on a hot summer day. Definitely a success in both flavor and packaging as I feel that Nosferatu has that vampire type bite with a dark side."
"Pours a deep, dark amber into the galss, with a fairly thin head. Nice lacing though. It smells very sweet, almost like caramel, although the smell isn't terribly strong. It tastes very sweet as well. Lots of rich maltiness. Almost syrupy. It does finish with a nice bitterness though, which dries the palate a bit. Some alcohol is noticable. Moujthfeel is silky smooth, with just the right level of carbonation. Overall, a very tasty beer. It's a little too sweet (and strong) for me to want to drink often, but could really hit the spot in the right mood."
"Drinkability is a little rough with this beer. The flavor profile is powerful and huge which takes some time to savor between sips."
"Pours a very deep red-amber with little head that dissipates down into a ring around the glass. Aroma is dark fruits and some sweet breadiness. Taste is a woody maltiness with a nice smoky flavor cleared off by mild citrus and dominant pine hops. Hops overpower the malts and make it a touch too bitter for my taste. Dry finish and refreshing."
"D - Sure Arrogant Bastard may be considered the King of this style, but if that's the case, Nosferatu is the Prince. This beer is only slightly aggressive, and completely balanced with almost no trace of alcohol to throw anything off. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a vibrant deep red. Decent carbonation rises to a thin head which leaves a thick lace. Smell is bitter fruit, sweet malt too. Taste is initially hoppy and bitter, mellows a bit in the back of my mouth, from more sweet fruity malts. Aftertaste hints of alcohol. Mouthfeel is crisp from the bitterness. For such a flavorful beer it almost seems to clean the palate. Another Great Lakes gem, a very drinkable strong ale."
"Went down clean, and alcohol was unnoticable, so good points there, but just not interesting enough to delight the tongue for very long."
"This is super easy to drink. A bit like a large IPA with its balance, not an overhopped DIPA. Good medium to full bodied mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation to add a touch of crispness."
"Cellared for 6 months. Pours a pale orange-maroon with bronze highlights and terrific clarity. Three finger beige head holds very well leaving thick blotches of lacing. Deeply malty nose; crystal malt, dextrin, dark fruit notes and a background Chinnok and Cascade aroma. Heavy caramel and dextrin taste upfront, followed by a hint of peat and strong ripe fruit flavor like plum or dates. The aftertaste balances out this robust malt with an equally boisterous hop bitterness, but the hop flavor/aroma seems to have faded and retains only a shadow of citrus/grapefruit finesse. While this beer continues to evolve and hold up well-past it's expiration date, in my opinion this is best consumed fresh. The body is med-full and the carbonation is moderate, but somehow the mouthfeel remains very fluid and not at all viscous. Finishes with ample residual toasted malt/fruit complexity and an even level of bitterness - but lack-luster hop aroma/flavor. I will probably review this fresh in the future."
"This is a very drinkable Strong Ale. I found it to be surprisingly subtle and mild. I could see this one sneaking up on me. It's that good, and easy to drink. I wish it was a bit more bold, and interesting. But it is what it is, and that's a nice fairly easy drinking Strong Ale."
"12oz. bottle poured a deep reddish color with small slightly tan head that doesn't leave any lace. Smell is slightly sweet with some toasted malt and citrusy hops. Taste is very bitter at first with a sour bitter like grapefruit flavor and just a little bit of a sweet malt with some dryness in the finish. The feel is light/medium and nicely carbonated. This is very easy to drink brew after the initial shock of the bitterness and I could see myself easily downing a few of these."
"FOURTH TRIAL: I've had this beer a few times before at (what tastes like) varying degrees of freshness. The first few times I've had it, it had a great hop presence, a nice malty backbone, and a bit of rye flavore. However, this time, it was much less hoppy and the malt and alcohol seemed to have taken a more dominant position. It was still good, but not as good as the first few trials. When both are fresh, I slightly prefer Founder's Red's Rye (which tastes quite similar to me), but to me, this beer seems to age a bit better (still rather have it fresh though). Overall, a great beer: great looking, great lacing, great smelling, and great tasting."
"D: Dangerously drinkable for the high ABV content. This one will sneak up on you. I had two bottles on Halloween evening and I was feeling no pain. Recommend."
"Cant pronounce the name, but a darn good beer. Poured from the bottle to a bright copper color with medium off-white head that lingered for most of the glass and left good lavcing. Aroma was a very pleasant blend of malty dark fruit and floral, grassy hops. Flavor was more on the bitter hoopy side, and aa the beer warmed, the 8% alcohol made itself more known. Palate was slightly bitter, and the finish was smooth and slightly warming."
"D: Apply named after the vampire as it combines the blood red color and hop bite with the warm sting of the alcohol. At 8% it is hypnotically drinkable so have your cross at the ready to avoid falling under its spell."
"Drinkability - not so great, a bit too much alcohol is tasted, don't think I would buy it again."
"Drinability: The 8% alcohol is hidden quite well, there is sweetness and bitterness. Honestly, for what it is the drinkability is really quite nice."
"This really is a fantastic brew. I cannot believe I let it sit around for this long (a month or so). In the realm of a DIPA I think just because of the hopiness. Thanks Vancer, you gave me very little BS."
"Poured a ruby red amber, with a huge off white head. Had a decent retention, so a slow fade left a nice quarter inch film on the top. Some strings of small bubble chains pouring through the glass and a nice clingy lace made a good starting impression on this one. Smell started off with some bread and yeast tones, but soon warmed to reveal a nice hop presence. Grapefruit and orange. Very sweet and well balanced. The taste started off very hoppy, Grapefruit, Pineapple, fresh tasting. Fely a bit slick when sipping, not watered down at all though. A slight hint of alcohol, but not bad, just enough to let you know it was there. The sweetness and bitter/sour were very well balanced off of each other, and in the malts vs hops war, there was no definitive winner in this one. This was a great brew, very drinkable, and very nice. I would love to try this on tap!"
"D: Very complex and extremely balanced. A very mixture nice of sweet and tart and dry and full."
"D: Very well balanced, very tasty. Would for sure get this one again if it were available in my area. Recieved this in a trade from nlmartin a long time ago, held up very well, thanks for the awesome brew!!"
"Overall a spectacular ale. The spicy grittiness reminds me of awesome Rye IPAs (RIPA) I've tried. Take everything I stated above as gospel for this great beer. Truly unique, bold and friendly for having such a creepy lore and label. Hats-off again to GLBC!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability; Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with a very good drinkability."
"I stumbled upon this bottle at Capone's in Norristown. The beer poured a clear amber color with a slight tan head. The nose was malty and sweet, refreshing. The taste was a malty, hoppy mix that was balanced well and a pleasure on my tongue although there was a bit of bitterness at the end that lasts in your mouth. I will definitely look for this one again."
"This is another dangerously drinkable brew from GLB. At 8% it sure will sneak up on you if you're not careful, kinda like a blood sucking vampire would sneak up on you!"
"Pours a light copper color with a little golden hue around the edges. Not to much of a head but high alcohol will do that. Smells hoppy, grapefruit and grass clippings on the nose. Tastes the same, a bit like a less sharp Arrogant Bastard. Definite grapefruit and fresh hops from the Pacific Northwest. A very good ASA. Enjoyed!"
"Very thin film of head that is rather dark trying to be the same as the beer. Hops are first on the palate, tastes like a Pale Ale, but then a bold malt flavor matches up evenly with the hops. This one is hearty. The finish is balanced with a sharp bitterness from the hops kicking back at the last second. A good froth reveals the alcohol but the flavor stays consistent. This is a great strong ale, bold malt and hops are strong without being too aggressive. This is my first GLBC brew and I dig!"
"It poured about a ruby brown, with a thin off-white head that held up OK. Overall, looked nice. Not much to the aroma - it was gentle, a little bit malty. The taste didn't meet my hopes for it - a little banana, maybe, but mostly bitter hops that lingered. Not much in the sweet and malty department. It was nicely carbonated and felt OK in the mouth, but overall something had me weirded out to the point that I was disappointed and didn't really see myself going back to it, unless it was to make sure that being past the freshness date didn't ruin it. Oh well."
"bottle picked up at Capone's in PA. Haven't had this in a while since Great Lakes stopped distribution into Indiana. Pours beautifully crimson and clear with a white head and super sticky lacing. Sweet robitussin, hop and caramel/sugar odor. Taste is very bitter and hoppy. Some sweet demerera and alcohol. Tastes, IMO, very much like Arrogant Bastard. Hoppiness lingers. Extremely syrupy and full bodied. A nice big bold hopped up ale. Get it if you see it."
"A great beer to drink while watching and Evening with Kevin Smith."
"The taste hardly masks the 8% ABV and alcohol notes pull through as it warms. Not a detriment to the ale, but other flavors (malt and vanilla?) seem to be overpowered. Hops is big on the palate and finishes through strong as well. Like the vampire on the bottle cover, it has a HUGE hops bite, yet it is appealingly dry and smooth. A bit too dry perhaps? For me, yes, which takes away from its drinkability. I can't imagine going through more than one bottle."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and medium bodied."
"Drinkability could get dangerous given that the 8% is well hidden by the depth of flavor."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, but the high abv holds down sessionability."
"Mouthfeel- Bold, and strong in its different flavors. Nice and complex and warming."
"The pour into my Grimbergen glass raises a creamy half finger light tan head that fades quickly to a glass ring, with pretty thick lacing. The beer's body is a bright golden red. The nose smells a lot like Arrogant Bastard, but with less caramel sweetness. Definite pine tar odor, with a bit of citrus, but not overpowering. The taste is very fruity, with a candy apple flavor. The hop flavor is muted, and there's not too much bitterness, just an underlying pineyness. Not too sweet, though: there's enough bitterness to keep it in check. The mouth is medium, with almost non-existent carbonation. A nice strong one, but not too special."
"drinkability is ok. the bitterness feels a little too high. would probably be great with a little time."
"Drinkability? This beer is amazing!"
"The drinkability is very good. This beer is just about excellent. among the best of it's type. Prosit MK"
"Bottle courtesy of Tpaliga: Poured a medium amber color ale with a small dirty white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of sweet malt with some bitter hops is interesting. Taste of sweet malt is easily shadowed by the citrus and bitter hops. Body is a bit light and lighter filtration would have been preferred. Alcohol is not dominant and well controlled. Good take on a style that I do not enjoyed particularly but that is always interesting to try."
"drinkability: decent"
"D: The bitter red ale is always a hit. Or is it a malty IPA? How ever you categorize it as, its an enjoyable beer. Not a profoundly deep beer but very nice taste."
" The $10 for a 4 pack seems to be pricey, but really its on-line with the $5 bomber prices."
"Ruby red color with a tan head that reduces to laced ring. The nose is of dark fruit, raisons, and ruby red grapefuit esters. Taste is strong citrusy floral and bitter hops, burnt caramel, and faint cranberry notes. The overwhelming hop addition creates a bitter spiciness and warm in the back palate and finish. Medium body and carbonated well for a fizzy mouth. Dry hops spice, heavy alcohol, and a little yeasty all make for a warm finish. Balanced with a sweet brown suger, oak barrel, malt character."
"Drinkability: Hey, I'm not a college kid anymore and drinking multiple beers at 8% won't work well with getting up at 5 AM the next day, so while this is a good brew, this is not a session beer."
"Bought a case to have through October. Poured in to a snifter, nice copper red color. The smell was hoppy with a citrus malt tone. I had an aroma that was quite different but very tempting. The beer was not cloudy at all but deep in color. Just the right amount of carbonation, and you taste that this is a higher alchohol beer. Nice bitter tone. Highly reccomended. I also had it from the tap which was very good."
"The restaurant I was in was pretty dark so it was hard to really judge the appearance of the beer, but it looked good to me. the smell was good, could def small the hops and some other spices mixed in. the taste was strong in hops, which I really don't like at all, but I'll have to say it;s much better than say an extremely hoppy beer, I could at least drink one of these again."
"Nosferatu pours a gorgeous clear copper with a thin tan head. Aroma of caramel, malt and piney hops dominate. Then there's a peach-like fruitiness to it, followed by a brown sugar scent. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat sticky. Flavor starts off with a rich malt front, followed by caramel with a slight nuttiness to it. A piney hop bitterness arrives midway and lingers into the finish. The alcohol is hidden well for being 8.0% (as listed on the bottle's label). It sort of sneaks up on you though. A bottle of Nosferatu is a good way to start... or end the night."
"aftertaste remains bitter, reminds me of an english bitter."
"D - Good drinkability. Reminds me of an old ale or Arrogant Bastard or maybe a cross between them. Nice beer with layers of flavor and nice complexity."
"Reddish bronze, still and deep, with a modest but densely packed sand-colored head. Rough piney and sweet citrus aromas -- ruby red grapefruit juice and some candyish malts. Big juicy pine sap juice flavor at first, with an unmistakeable alcoholic sharpness all around the palate. This yields to a surprisingly mellow grapefruit acidity and an earthy mineral twang at the finish. Slight alcohol slickness in the mouthfeel, dry tannic finish that lingers as a sticky bittersweet malt character. A very flavorful strong ale, not nearly as rough around the edges as some of its West Coast counterparts, yet still bearing many family resemblances -- just a bit more ""refined," perhaps. Glad to finally have this (deservedly) highly reputed ale available in my area now. And, I might add, as good a choice as any on Halloween night!"
"Yet again another good beer from GLBC. If you've had your fill of arrogant bastard and need a slight change of pace look this one up."
"Oh, what a beer here. Great flavor! Deep red color, like blood! One of the most truly red colored beers I have seen. Nicely hopped, citrus and pine flavors. Sticky hop bitterness sticks to the back of your tongue. Also, incredibly well balanced. Rich caramel maltiness, but not too heavy mouthfeel. Okay, enough typing....more drinking."
"D - One of my favorite seasonals. A truly fantastic beer."
"This beer is extremely quaffable. Were it not for its seasonality, this one would find itself in my regular rotation."
"Would you believe it if I told you my local watering hole was pouring 20oz. pints for $3. Yowzers!"
"I like it. A nice Rust Belt counterpart to Arrogant Bastard, and certainly worth a taste. Has potential to mess you up pretty good if you aren't careful, and it sits on the stomach a bit, but it's easy to enjoy."
"I have had the pleasure of sampling this a few times in the past and had a pint last night on tap, this had been sitting for a few weeks waiting to be drank here at home.Poured into a impy pint glass a nice clear copper/amber color with a tight 1/2 finger light reddish tinted head that left a nice ring as it settled,aromas of roasted nuts,dark fruit and a real noticable leafy hop presence wich I found more profound out of the bottle than on tap.Big fruity profile on the palate up front with notes of brown sugar with that leafy,piney hop presence coming thru into the finish as well a light alcohol zing.I like a good American strong ale and this is another top notch one in my book it has alot of different flavors and character going on."
"This beer is full bodied and heavy on the palate, carbonation does not interfere with the flavor and is at a level which seems appropriate. This is a beer that I wish were offered year round. Probably one of my favorites from what Great Lakes has to offer. Will definitley be buying this one again."
"Drinkability- Take your time and enjoy this one, it's worth it. One of my seasonal favorites."
"Drinkability-This ones not exactly a sipper, but you'll want to take your time and enjoy it anyway."
"Overall: A delightful brew that was a nice surprise. Another classic from Great Lakes. Definitely get as much as possible. This one should drink nicely throughout the cold months."
"The Great Lakes Brewing website says Nosferatu is only available September-October. It seems like I really only review beers I enjoy on this site, and consequently end-up recommending everything. Nosferatu deserves a stronger endorsement than that; I'll definitely be purchasing this beer again before Halloween."
"D: I am not sure what the ABV is on this but I am assuming it's up there. I could get tanked on these and enjoy it!"
"It was fairly drinkable for the style,well balanced,very tastey,a very enjoyable beer.Recomended drinking,would love to drink this beer again."
"Drinkability: I will enjoy this beer to the last drop. Sharp and strong, but good for a cold October day."
"D It is very good I would just prefer a Arrogant Bastard but if I didn't have that on hand all the time this would be a 2nd choice to it."
"Pours a dark amber red and clear with a small cream colored head. Aroma is a light citrus hoppiness including grapefruit and sweet oranges. A solid citrusy hop bite shows up in the taste as well along with a nice chewy maltiness and a fairly dry finish. This beer is incredibly balanced, no alcohol was evident in the aroma or taste, I felt like it was more of a strong ipa with a large malt bill. Very nice display of citrusy hops and incredibly easy to drink."
"Drank from a 12 oz bottle with a 12/1/06 best-by date. Poured a clear, reddish color. Tall head with great retention. Smells of hops, a little sweet and smoky. Tastes mainly of the hops. Not a huge fan of the aftertaste, but there's a nice balance of sweet and hoppiness. Good creaminess in the mouthfeel complements the flavors. Overall, one of my favorites from Great Lakes!"
"Pretty thick in the mouth, as you'd expect for the style. Certainly quite drinkable as well, but you best pace yourself with this one."
"Still great...I love it."
"Very drinkable even at 8% abv."
"As delicious as I find this brew to be, it is hard to drink more than a few considering that it is 1.) high in alcohol 2.) has a sharp, bitter, mineral finish 3.) the blood comparison probably wouldn't go over well if I was intoxicated."
"Nice and carbonated but not too much. Medium-full body is perfect for this one. Very easy drinking too despite the tastebud destroying hops."
"overall, another winner from Great Lakes, God I love this brewery!"
"D- I like the tap version better, just because it's a wilder animal than the bottle. All in all this a very nice rendition of a strong ale, hearty and refreshing on a cool night."
"A deep reddish brown hue with an off white head that stuck around for a decent amount of time for they style and little carbonation present. Has a sticky malt aroma with a citrus zesty hops notes. The taste is highly hopped with the same zesty notes that where present in the smell. The midtaste was a sticky toasty hops. The body was thick with a slight alcoohol warming sensation to it. The beer was nice but would of been better as an after dinner drink on a cold night."
"Texture is exactly as an American Strong should be; not overly chewy but not carbonated like soda. Man, I am totally into this beer."
"D: Very tasty, not very filling, good kick and has the type of interesting flavor that makes it well-worth drinking for a while. I could see myself knocking back a sixer of this one with ease."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours reddish/brown (more red than brown) with a small off-white head. It smells like grapefruit, hops, and there's a peppery spicyness too, but grapefruit is the main aroma I can smell. The taste is a good mix of sweet and bitter. It starts with a hoppy bitterness and ends with a malty sweetness, and the aftertaste lingers a long time. It tastes like citrusy hops, spicy flavors, pepper, and raisins. The mouthfeel is creamy, and it goes down smooth. The ABV catches up to you after a while, but you can't really taste it much in the beer itself. Overall this is a very good beer, another great offering from Great Lakes."
"GLBC can do no wrong it seems. A nice seasonal."
"This pours a deep brownish garnet color with a nice finger of tan head that left sticky lace on the sides of the tulip glass. The aroma was sweet caramel malt and citrus hop spiciness with a hint of rasin. The taste was sweet malts balanced nicely with citrus and piney hops. There is also a nice dark fruit flavor and canned pear profile that is present with almost a spicey oak hint. I have to say that it's well balance again, sweet and complex with sorta dry finish. Has a medium to full bodied mouthfeel and is very drinkable, the 8% ABV is well masked here. I've had this on tap and bottle and they're both very very good. Another well done, well balanced and complex beer from Great Lakes."
"Pours deep reddish amber. The head dissipates and lingerers only around the edges. Sents of plum, beets, grapes, mild spices, hops and hints of raisons. Taste is clean and refreshing, definitely an american ale. The fruit comes up front and then is followed by bitter hops that linger mildly, a little piney and sticky. This is a very well balance beer I normally stray from amber beer, but recently I have found a couple I like like this one. This is a great offering from Great lakes brewery."
"The label is one of the best in beer as well, featuring Max Schreck as Count Orlaf from the film. Drinking a four-pack of the beer while watching the film would be a truly illuminating experience, I think--or at least gratifying on all sense planes."
"Drinkabitly of this beer is very good considering the ABV."
"What balance and complexity this beer projects. Very bold and masculine brew. Thick toffee malt, the malt is in layers engulf the tongue for over 50 seconds on the finish. But on that finish is a large amount of impeccably balanced pine hops and thick fig fruit paste. Very good and drinkable. Mouthfeel is thick and entrenching and leaves a coat of hop resin and malt on your tongue for maybe the longest finish I've ever witnessed in a beer."
"D - For this style, I believe it to be top notch. Just be carefull of the ABV...it'll creep up and bite you. (note: the biting comment was not intended to be a bad vampire joke)"
"Reminds me a little bit of Legacy's Hedonism for some reason but more balanced and a bit more drinkable."
"Very well crafted brew."
"Give it a shot for sure, if it was available in CT I would buy it regularly."
"Received in BCG-BiF from Zorro, and cellared for a few months since then. A best by date of September 23, 2005 is printed on the label."
"Glowing golden copper color, crystal clear, with a small white, fluffy head. A little bit of lacing. Smells of citrusy fruits, hops and malts. Another brew that reminds me of bitter tea, quite tasty. Some citrus flavors up front, semi sweet, and then finishes with some big hop flavor and bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, not too heavy with lots of carbonation. A nice treat from Great Lakes and looking foward to their next release of Nosferatu."
"Medium amber, honey colour with a dark cream, almost yellow head. Good retention and some lacing resulted while emptying my glass. Great hop aroma - powdery, resinous, citrus. Also light breadiness and caramel in the nose. Solid malt flavour with caramel balancing a moderate to strong bitterness and a bit of orange hop flavour. The finish has a mild alcohol warmth as well. Creamy texture and medium bodied, the carbonation was a little on the low side. A highly drinkable beer and another strong offering from Great Lakes."
"Pours with a slight haze, red/orange in colour, big loose off white head forms, good retention and nice lace rings around the glass. Smell is caramel and dates up front, very malty, but chocolate and citrus/floral makes it way into the nose. Taste is very sweet and malty up front, but with a clean caramel and citrus middle, floral and raisins, little vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Amazingly balanced, doesn't give away its 8% and 75 IBU status. Fantastic example of an American stock ale, thanks DrJay!!"
"honeyish colour, lots of light lace. Medium to full mouthfeel, hoppy and scotchy and honey aroma. Rich bitterness, citrussy,lace cushioning tongue. Carmel for some balance. Very drinkable. Very good old ale. Variety of hops UK and American in here. Thanks Doc Jay."
"Decent drinkability, another solid brew from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability: This is a good all around beer with complexity but yet can still be handled by the most common of swill guzzling folk and still be enjoyed. I am realy starting to like the Great lakes Brewing Co."
"Overall: An interesting Frankenstein of some barleywine and DIPA characteristics, not somethign you'd want to have more than one of."
"OG '04: Served best by a year's aging, but i'm in love with 2 years aging too."
"Drinkability: This beer is a very well balanced malty hoppy beer. Very easy to drink. Oh Yeah!"
"Many thanks to Rick and Betty for bringing this monster back to Texas with them."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks AKSmokedPorter for the wedding present! Enjoy by Sept 23 05 on label."
"Slàinte!"
"Body just shy of big with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. Awesome drinkability, I could suck these down all night."
"Drinkability & Notes  Great strong ale, full and complex with loads of hop and malt flavor. I like a beer in this strength area, powerful enough to have a lot of flavor and complexity, but not so much as to become cumbersome to drink."
"Drinkability: This is another must try from Great Lakes. It's too bad that this fine beer is seasonal. It's a good thing I got another one left. If you like Strong Ales, this one will not disappoint your palate. Keep up the good work Great Lakes!"
"Pours a gorgeous red amber with a small stubborn head. Lacing, rings, islands and tiny-bubbled carbonation round out a handsome look. Smell is bread, alcohol, cherries, and zest. The taste starts with a high octane hit of malts then changes character completely to finish with a bitter hop bite. If these flavors were blended a bit more it would improve things, as I am sure will happen with age. The mouthfeel is medium with the carbonic bite preventing it from feeling full. This brew clocks in at 8% ABV which prevents it from being a simple quaff. The alcohol hit will mellow with age. This is a keeper."
"gives arrogant bastard a run for its money, and the best brew in GLBC's arsenal that i've tasted"
"A really remarkable beer. Complex and subtle. Just a delight to drink."
"Very nice stuff, it makes me happy at Halloween-time."
"Flavors are sweet caramel malts balanced by grapefruit hops. Bitter aftertaste to dry out the sweetness. A great choice for the hop lovers. Medium body although sweet not slick and dextrinous. A little alcohol in nose and flavor as it warms"
"Purchased from Dilly Deli in Cincinatti. Best by Sept 23 2005 ink jet labeled on the fron label. Pours a beautiful copper/amber with a sticky layer of tan bubbles. Sticky sugary hop aroma. This same come through in the taste with a strong pine, citrus and grassy hops. They are sharp, yet smooth. The syrupy sugaryness takes over and leaves it pretty heavy medium in the mouth. I think you could drink this one all night."
"Relatively drinkable. I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would have, but it was decent. I can use one word to classify this one: interesting."
"This one is very nice indeed; and I think it offers a tremendous amount of drinkability in that it can fit many different occassions, and is complex and strong but not overwhelming. Recommended!"
"not sure where this brew falls categorically.. and maybe that's a good thing. malty sweetness with hop notes is reminiscent of an ESB, but the alcohol content boosts the effects of those flavors. double esb? hopwine? you decide, definitely worth your time."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a brilliant amber color with half an inch of head. The aroma is vanilla and fruity hops. Sweet toffee flavor lasts only a second before being dominated by extremely bitter pine and spice from the hops. This beer is very malty and very hoppy, but unlike an IPA or a hoppy barleywine. The flavor is cleaner than either of those styles. Full mouthfeel. Suprisingly drinkable. This is a very good, unique beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear deep copper amber color with a decent frothy off white head that leaves sticky sheets of lacing in my glass. Hoppy grapefruit and pine aromas. Grapefruit, pineapple, citrus and caramel flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes bitter. Hard to believe this is at 8%, alcohol is very well hidden."
"The smell delivers the taste, true hops, light lemon/green apple. the finish is smooth and bitter, with a touch of alcohol. All in all, this is a damn fine beer!"
"Poured a nice deep amber colour with a slight head. Light aroma, slightly sweet and fruity. As the name implies, this beer definitely has a bite, but the initial hop bitterness slowly mellows. It actually finishes smooth and slightly sweet with a lingering dryness. The higher alcohol provides a slight warming affect, but not too noticeable. A very delicious beer and highly recommended."
"D: Solid. I'll have this one again, but I think it would be best as an occassional beer and not as one that you would drink many of in one session."
"The first taste was great. Personally, this beer tasted like a barleywine-style ale. It had a good deal of hops in it. But most notably, a little bit of a fruity taste that gave it the barleywine flavor. I typically don't like the fruity flavor mixed with my hops, but Great Lakes really makes it good in this beer. The beer had a lot of alcohol, but it was hard to taste when drinking. I will definitely drink more of these soon. A great beer!"
"Thanks to blitheringidiot for cackle frackus-ing this bottle all the way back from Chicago, and for giving it to me as a gift! What a swell guy."
"Poured a deep copper to amber color with a thick, rich tan colored head. A nice lace was left on the side of the chalice as the head receded into the beer. Grassy and floral hop character balanced by a little grapefruit rind all found in the aroma. Taste is surprisingly light. It has the grapefruit and the hop flower, but it is much sweeter than I expected. Toffee/caramel and a bit of fig provides the sweetness. Thin mouth feel, but still very drinkable."
"D- This is a very interesting beer. It has a good complex flavor with spicy hops, toasted malts and a nice alcohol warmth to pull it all together."
"Very interesting, and extremely enjoyable. I really enjoyed this one, and it's all thanks to cmaruschak!"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Very citric hops upfront and throughout the ride. Orange peel with a little pine sap. Starts off piney and then changes to citrus before it turns into a dry finish. Just enough malty body to give it balance. Moderate to full mouthfeel is slightly oily. I could drink a lot of these over the course of one evening. Too bad it only comes in four packs."
"Flash...I owe you big time for this. Simply wonderful. GLBC shows yet again why they are my favorite brewery."
"Medium-full in body, the malt flavors give the impression of robust nature that's probably over stating the early creaminess. When the hop flavor and bitterness take over, the beer turns toward dryness to culminate in a malty-dry finish with pronounced alcohol warmth and a linger of both hops and malt."
"The beer was very nice finger of white, foamy head that stuck to the glass as I drank the beer. The beer was a deep reddish amber color. The taste was of a hoppy bitterness with a sweetness balanced well with the alcohol. This is not a session beer, but still something to drink again and again when the mood strikes. I almost wish I had saved this one for September or October, but I'll have to make way with it July. Really a good beer, another solid brew from GLBC."
"A highly-hopped red ale that ventures into double IPA territory. Swift tang of hops in the aroma with some mild herbal notes. Hops storm in on the first sip and take over with a slightly sweet malt barely hanging on for the ride. Finish is sharp with a heavy-handed bittering that lingers. Some citrus aromatics come to life at the end. Not quite as malty as I would have expected given the red ale chosen for the hops delivery vehicle, seemed to strain under the load. An enjoyable beer for the hops-inclined."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for heading up north and snagging me some bottles."
"Taste is also rich and malty with a generous level of bitter herbal hops. Piney. Caramel and vanilla too. Long bitterness and a light sweetness in the finish. Tasty though. A good one."
"while you can. Hunt this vampyre down!"
"Smooth and medium bodied, this is a great sipper, pleasing and refreshing. Can't wait until next fall when it reappears."
"Mouthfeel is medium, the feel is enhanced by the carbonation present. Drinkability is good a decent strong ale. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"Pours a hazy reddish copper with a frothy two finger head that coats the glass. Big floral and citric hop aroma over a subtantial malt base. A little biscuity with some marshmallow sweetness and a little alcohol kick. Taste is mostly malt dominant, caramel sweetness, with a good smattering of citric hops thrown in. Subtle fruity esters and a soft breadiness, with some alcohol in the finish. My bottle sat on the shelf awhile so the hops may have been a little subdued compared to a fresh batch. Mouthcoating full body. Hugely drinkable for such an agressive beer. I'll go out of my way to get a fresh sample."
"Comments  Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending me the Nosferatu. This beer bites."
"Yes, this beer was worth the search. I shall stock up when this is brewed again."
"The taste is bitter right off the bat. The sweet flavors rush in to counteract the bitter for mere moments before both call a truce and fade into a bittersweet symphony. This brew is an example of flavor balance that is nearly perfected. I say nearly because at odd times throughout the glass, the alcohol steps out from behind the flavor curtain to proclaim its presence and intentions. I can handle it, but I wish the delicious malt and hop harmony were not thrown into temporary dischord by the alcohol flashes that pop up intermittently. Hey, it's an 8% concoction I know, but we have to have goals for continuous improvement. Other brews have succeeded in completely veiling their alcohol contents ( some at higher abv's ) and I just wish the same for this otherwise extraordinary brew. This is delicious and satisfying nonetheless. It remains highly consumable. Superb even. I most certainly will buy again and again. And again."
"Served into a tulip glass, Nosferatu pours a hazy orange body with a one inch beige head. Good head retention and some island chain lacing. Lots of active carbonation on view in the glass. Aroma has toffee and caramel for the malt profile, citrusy hops with a pine accent for the hops. Hops also lend a grassy and herbal note. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, nicely carbonated, with a mild bite of alcohol. Taste features a bigtime malt influence of toffee and caramel. The hops are quite assertive, as well, more pine cone than citrus, with some grassiness for good measure. Some honey drenched apple and pear flavors are noted in the middle, and the malt veers toward buttered bread with toffee toward the finish. Pine resin adds a bitterness to the finish, and the aftertaste winds up smooth and evenly balanced. Alcohol is well concealed inside the assertive hops and malts. Lots going on in this one. Some barleywine and double IPA character are present. Very nicely constructed, and one that I would have again. Thanks to brewedlyhooked for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is clean and slightly oily, light for the style -- which I think qualifies as a barleywine. Not much to set this apart but a very good, basic balanced barleywine (which not everyone can make). This could even be an ""everyday"" barleywine, it is lighter and easier to drink than others in that style. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for this bottle."
"Copper colored with a fat foamy head of off-white meringue. Aroma is a combination of sweet biscuity malt and citrusy hops, neither flavor overpowering the other. Also some sweet fruits and candy, and I do believe some alcohol rising up to the nose as well. Flavor is also well-balanced - many flavors, all a bit understated but definitely making their presence known, and all playing off and with each other very well to create a well-rounded and interesting beer. There's malt, citrusy hops with some piney accents, sweet pear, ripe apple, butterscotch, and caramel. Every sip is a great mix of all of these flavors dancing around the mouth. This one's got some power, but it's highly drinkable because of the interesting flavors."
"pours out a copper color with a dense creamy layer of foam that slowly subsides. Smell is a balance of malty sweet caramel and citrusy hops. One of the most appealing smells ever. Taste is initally bitter, yet a massive sweetness backs it up. This stuff tastes like a pale ale on steroids with sugar dumped into it. Delicious. The hops taste slightly piney and citrusy. I wish I could try this stuff fresh as this bottle is past its prime date, I am sure the flavor and aroma are that much better out of a fresh keg. Drink this stuff on the warmer side, the flavors come out much more, especially the caramel. I am really jealous of you people who live near this brewery, it is without a doubt one of the best in the country."
"Thank you cokes for the scary looking bottle (and the contents inside)."
"Rich deeper red look in the goblet with a nice off beige head on the pour. Head settles quite quickly to a persistant thickish sticky sheen. Hoppy caramel nose with strong notes. Big malt backbone with nice pine hoppy tastes upfront. This is a beer with a backbone. The brew rounded more and became sweeter (Caramel). A nice sippin' beer."
"Pretty good. Very similar to an IPA in taste, but many subtle nuances. I'm not a big IPA person, but this was still pretty drinkable."
"Nosferatu isn't much of a vampire since it definitely doesn't bite; nor does it suck. It is bloody good beer though. Okay I'm done. It has been my fervent hope that Great Lakes would eventually bless the faithful (of which I am unabashedly, unashamedly, one) with a highly hopped IPA or DIPA. This isn't quite what I had in mind, but it is a worthy substitute until they brew the real thing. Year-round please."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light beige head over the slightly murky amber brew. Head fights the good fight, and lasts for a long time, esp for the style, and lacing is good. Aroma is of malty husks, slight dark fruits, and tinges of alcohol. Taste is follows the nose, except alcohol notes at the swallow seem more pronounced, and warming is obvious. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both great for the style. This is one vampire I'll try to revisit..."
"Looking out for my sobriety, Great Lakes? Thanks, but lets see this in 6ers next time."
"This beer has a clear brown/dark amber body, topped with a creamy white head. Nice lace trails. Scentwise, big malty with a slight metallic tone. Thick caramel malt front, bitter hop in the back; well blended and big. Spice from the alcohol, which warms your heart. Slight citrus tones. Full bodied. Yum."
"A very nice beer from Great Lakes. I will be buying this one again."
"Until that happens, so much thanks to cokes for the bottle!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with great chewy body...leaves some nice lacing down my glass as well. A tasty, easy to drink brew that works well on a cold night...I like it! Thanks to kmpitz2 for hooking me up with the bottle."
"Another good brew from Great Lakes. Very sprucelike hops flavor balanced with sweetness. The hops aren't overbearing, balance is the word on this one."
"Thanks, PhantomVoodoo."
"Drinkability - high abv, but tasty and sure to be at next year's Halloween party."
"Somewhere in-between an IPA and a Barley Wine, this is an absolute treat and is best enjoyed slowly while savoring.. it goes down just as easy in larger quantities. The Midwest's answer to Arrogant Bastard, but infinitely more drinkable, as the bitterness is just right and not caustic like it's bretheren. I will definitely be stocking up on this one. What a great beer."
"I had this in the bottle a couple of times but also on-tap last night at Logan's Alley. It pours a brilliant, shiny auburn red color, not much head but a thin white layer across the top. Smell is really hoppy with some alcohol notes and maybe some caramelly undertones. Taste has more hop bitterness but its not quite the punch of hops I get in the aroma which suggests its dry-hopped. The alcohol, however, is much stronger in taste then it was in the nose. There's also a fruity estery flavor in the mix with the alcohol. The sweetness comes from a caramel/butterscotch maltiness. Honey seems to appear towards the finish, which is drawn out. This is a good beer, nothing less nothing more, maybe with time it will improve."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy orangish-amber color with two fingers of head. There is a decent amount of lacing. The smell sorta seems malty at first, but there's also a good amount of hops in there as well. The taste has just that little bit of maltiness, but holy shit watch out for the hops! Really citrusy hops, with lots of alpha acid bitterness on the finish. Could be Arrogant Bastard's twin brother, just with a little less grapefruit. The body is thick and heavy, coating the mouth well. The drinkability is great for a beer of this magnitude. Great stuff."
"Sweetened toffee and butterscotch malt flavors kick off the palate. Chewy and delicious. Hints brown-sugar crusted fruit appear and biscuit settle in, until a substantial wave of pine needles and spicy hops take over and carry into the finish. Finish is warming and bitter, with lingering sticky sweetness. Full-bodied and chewy, but not too thick. I'm a big fan of this style and this example doesn't let me down in the least. Another great Great Lakes beer."
"Interesting label on this beer with a picture good old Nosferatu looking in desperate need of some beer. This poured out with a rich copper body with about three fingers worth of off white head slowly forming. The head stayed are for a bit as it laced the glass in rings of foam. Aroma was a mix of earthy hop and equal part sweet caramel malt with a touch of alcohol in the background to complete it. Very tasty smelling beer overall that had a good strong aroma. Taste starts off with a malty sweetness with a touch of molasses and a bit of earthiness to it. This finishes with a bitter after taste that has a lingering warmth to it. Mouthfeel is just about full with a syrupy sticky feel to it. Drinkability is damn good as this has enough hops that they add to the taste and keep this from being overly sweet. One I would definitely make a regular if it was around here. Thanks again to garthwaite for another awesome beer."
"Great beer, gives any beer in this style a run for its money."
"Overall, one of the few Great Lakes beers that I would think twice about before buying again. Tries to break new ground, but instead comes across as a dilution of the styles it tries to borrow from."
"The beer departs the bottle a very nice semi-opaque amber color. The nose is nice and piney with hop, with a hint of caramel mats in the background. The flavor is a nice hop bitter upfront that fades nicely to sweet caramel. The feel on this one is moderate to thick, with a good residual coating of my mouth. Drinkability is very good on this one. I really like the balance. This is a fine beer from a fine brewery."
"With fruity esters, caramel malts, and English hops taking to the nth degree, this beer doesn't coalesce into anything I ever wish to return. Not the beer I expected, even after a four-pack of adjustment. Not really an ESB, not really a Strong ale, not really something I'll touch ever again."
"Pours a lighter copper color with a foamy light beige colored head. Caramel and crystal malt notes and some piney hop aromas. Pretty smooth and balanced. Just as much sweet as it is hoppy and dry. Light astringency in the finish and tannins. Carbonation is a little low, but it's OK. Pretty solid seasonal from Great Lakes. I, personally, like it better on-draught."
"Considering the number of flavors and the strength, this is quite a drinkable brew."
"Served in a siffter and even though the light was low I could see the bright ruby red color and a small vague head. Giant hop nose, but not overbearing chilled out smoothly by sweet malts. The taste is outstanding. Generous hop fangs suck all other flavors out of the mouth (Over the top?). Malt sweetness finishes off the selection gently with a decent caramel flavoring. An alcohol finish warms the soul, not huge but nicely placed. Mouthfeel is heavy and slick leaving residual malt around for memories. Loved this and have no problem ordering a few more."
"Nosferatu: an extremely mellow extreme ale? Perhaps. Copper penny brownish-red brew with a good dosage of piney hop aromas with a smattering of sweet maple syrup. Straightforward. A kind of obvious beer, the flavor is similarly parcelled out neatly into two compartments: a malty chunk full of caramel, syrupy, sweet flavors and a hoppy chunk oozing with pine bitterness. This is in many respects absurdly hopped, but to their credit, they do a good job of maintaining a sense of balance. A lot of the potential nuance in this may be lost, but I doubt they were going for that anyhow. A fine example of a strong, hoppy ale maintaining some drinkable, balanced character. Not as thick and full bodied as some others in the style, and that lends to a sort of crispness that this style requires to stay drinkable. Better than some of its more aggressive brothers."
"Thanks to WVbeergeek for the opportunity."
"The beer disinherits the 12-ounce brown bottle and adopts my glass a luminous copper color with a planetary sized head that is light tan in color and semi-creamy in texture and after its slow demise the lace left over forms a thick sealing blanket upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, hints of yeast and maybe some hops, crisp and clean to the senses, start is sweet and rich in malt, the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is light to medium in acidity, the hops potent in their spiciness, also a hint of alcohol bitterness in the dry long lasting aftertaste, a belly warmer and a very nice beer for a fall afternoon when the works day is done."
"On draught at Barleys Smokehouse. Billed as the big brother to Burning River, I'd also say it is kissin' cousins with Arrogant Bastard. Pours a luminous red color with a medium and creamy light tan head. Thin rings of lacing throughout. The aroma is a nice blend of malt, fruit and hops. Rich and tart with robust bitterness. Hops, malt, fruit and alcohol play nicely together. The finish is nicely bitter hops, with a pinch of citrus and sweet malt. As usual I am impressed with this scary good offering from GLBC."
"Very tasty and a bit to easy to drink."
"Drinkability is good. Hop heads delight with this one. Very bitter, near over the top but manages to stay tasty."
"I did not know this beaut existed. Whenever I'm in Ohio, I try to pick up anything by Great Lakes. Gorgeous dark copper color, with thick, quickly dissipating head. Light malt aroma, but oh that taste. It feels like a strong ale, but its body is a bit light, making it VERY drinkable. A person could get awfully intoxicated drinking a few of these. I'm glad I stuck with the 4-pack."
"Appearance: Ruby caramel hue with a nice sized off white vanilla beige head leaves full webbed lacing blotches around my glass. Aroma: Strong pine presence with a bready mild malt sweetness touches of caramel and nuts but more stand outish is the alcohol presence. Taste: A dominant piney hop flavor flows throughout this becoming a bit one dimensional at times and overbearing on the palate seems very concentrated and not as balanced as some of the prior batches I've tasted of this big brew. There is still a spiciness beneath the hop flavor along with a tone of syrupy rich caramel malts with alcohol backing all of this that's going on. Mouthfeel: Medium to full body range doesn't sit heavy on the stomach but the flavor would probably become somewhat abrasive after multiple bottles of this brew. Slight syrup and touch of an oily quality about it from the hops 85 IBUs, definitely the bigger brother of the Burning River. Drinkability: Nice treat definitely an old ale in my eyes, when is Great Lakes going to start bottle conditioning their brews b/c this one was released in September and the bottle says it only supposed to be best by November 20, 2004 I'm sure it will last a bit longer with the alcohol and massive dose of hops it has."
"Real good offering from Great Lakes!"
"Easy to drink, and enjoy. Simple, yet fulfilling."
"This pours a red color with a small head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy with hints of some caramel and malts underneath. Well balanced flavor: Hoppy, but has some sweet malts there to bring it back. Caramel as well. This reminds me of a larger version of another of their beers, but I can't think of the name right now. Very good beer."
"Very drinkable for those who like the bitter stuff. This is one I will have again."
"Cheers"
"Ah, Great Lakes. This fine brewery, which also happens to be from my native state of Ohio, has never failed me in the past. And it certainly continues its grand trend with this excellent brew. A whiff of this ale, which pours a deep reddish gold, just screams ""hops!"" at you. The taste is very spicy and tangy, and reminds me quite a bit of some of my favorite IPAs. All in all a great beer, and one that makes me proud to be an Ohioan."
"One of these is on its way to you Gus!"
"Drinkability: Top notch. I sampled this on a Saturday afternoon while watching The local college team teach a lesson to some kids from a Carolina (again, way to go Nuge.) I finished the four-pack with ease and craved for more. Great Lakes Nosferatu is an incredibly balanced, smooth, strong ale."
"""The beer with the bite", says the label. Pouring reveals a clear deep dark copper color with a thick fluffy off-white fluffy head. The head disappeared quickly than I would have hoped, not leaving much lace on the glass. Smells like a hop bomb, slightly citrusy and grassy, with a rich malt nose as well. Despite the hop dominance in the nose, this is a very balanced beer. Strong carmel malt which is very rich at first, followed by a dry grassy finish. Bitterness is high, but not overpowering. Medium to full body with a low amount of carbonation, combined with what I would call stickyness. Overall, another great beer by GLBC. Very balanced and tasty. Alcohol is noticable in this one, but still very drinkable."
"Well, this latest from Great Lakes was heavily anticipated. It poured a copper amber color and formed an off white foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. A wonder aroma to it, with elements of pine, citrus, and a candy sweetness of a malt background. The flavor was of malt, hops, with some caramel elements with a hint of the alcohol present. The finish was a bit astrigent and bitter. Another fine concoction from the boys on the lake."
"Dark copper body, slightly hazy, topped by a cream colored head. Aroma is of strong pine, citrus and florals, mixed with a pleasant malt sweetness. The flavor is instantaneously, simultaneously sweet and bitter, with malt sweetness up front being crowded by a piney resinous bite. More citrus flavors are revealed in the mid, along with a decent caramel note. Nice strong bitterness on the finish cleans the malt away fairly well. Mouthfeel is thick and almost syrupy, but not to the point that it makes drinking the beer laborious. On the contrary, drinking this beer is so easy that a couple will disappear quickly. The combination of intense sweetness and hard-hitting hop bitterness is a true joy. Brian and the crew at GLBC should make this more often."
"On my visit to GLB (see beerfly review) I had the utmost pleasure of drinking this ultra-hoppy tart ale. It came to me a lovely dark amber, and I could smell the hops wafting over all the other enticing aromas at the table (there was an Edmund Fitzgerald Porter across the way and a Burning River Pale Ale next to me). I confess I didn't tarry too long on the aroma because I wanted to taste, and it did not disappoint. Like the Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA, I could almost believe there was grapefruit in this, but in a balanced way, as the subtle malt sweetness supported the bitternesswell. The mouthfeel was smooth and thick, but the hops...oh the hops."
"Overall, this beer was very good from the growler, although the carbonation was quickly waning; one with a ceramic type lid likely would have helped. I suspect Nosferatu would be exceptional freshly released from the keg at Great Lakes and I strongly look forward to the opportunity to sample it there.."
"Reddish gold color, with a long lasting white head. Only on draught. Highly hopped but the firm malt background comes through to make this a very good brew."
