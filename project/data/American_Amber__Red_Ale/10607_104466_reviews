review_text
"12 oz can poured into a shaker. Smells buttery and earthy, has some faint hoppy / spicy aroma sneaking in on the back-end, but the sweetness definitely dominates. Pours hazy on the orange side of amber with a thick and foamy eggshell-colored head, lacing is a bit uneven - both large and small lace is present. The taste is medium caramel sweetness with a bit of hoppy bitterness at the swallow. There’s also a citrus presence throughout the drink, but I can’t quite place it - another review mentioned grapefruit, which seems fair. Relatively light body (considering the caramel / malty flavoring) which finishes creamy smooth with very little (if any) carbonation; however, some of the hoppiness sticks around at the finish; not overwhelming like some IPA’s, but the faint, thin grassy coating of the mouth is reminiscent; in fact, depending on food pairings, it may be beneficial. There’s an interesting cheesy flavor (think aged parmesan) that pops up about mid drink as it begins to warms - I’m still relatively undecided on it, but it does give this beer a uniqueness to it."

"Wow! This one blew me away. Amazing hop aroma, bright amber/golden color (a little light for an amber but thats hardly a knock). Bitterness is spot on for the abv and malt character. Fantastic!"
""
""
"Pours with a large foamy head over a dark amber body.  Strngly hoppy with moderate bitterness.  Relatively dark and large malt load."
""
"I'm a big fan of the Sixpoint brews, especially ones like this one.....waves of malt and  then dense  hops all over the rear.....great cool  to cold weather brew ..complex and quite tasty"
""
""
"Dandilion and citrus summer brew that's heavier than most. Taste isn't bad but smell is much better."
""
""
"Pours an orange amber with finger thick white head. Smells of orange blossom, orange rind an sweet malts. Tastes of tangerine, sweet malts, rye, barley, grapefruit and bready. Medium/light body, sweet malts, some orange and pine aftertaste."

"Really good this year. I'd rather have a Warmer than a Nugget Nectar in 2015."
""
""
"Not really bold enough for an imperial red label. Put that aside and it is a great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I rated this as an Imperial Red because that's what it says on the package.  As far as Imp Reds go, this one is soft and not hoppy enough.  If I rated it as an Amber ale, the score would have been higher.  Regardless of the ramifications of the style conundrum, this is a nice beer that I enjoyed drinking."
""
""
""
"First imperial red.  Nicely hopped.  Good solid beer."
""
"Overall, one of the better Amber Ales I've had! Smooth, balanced and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
"A very good hop forward big red, seek it out."
"Poured a copper body with one finger head and lace ring down glass.  A mostly citric hop aroma with touches of malty sweetness like caramel but more hoppy.  I really enjoyed this beer as it is balanced as is my preference with even hops and caramel malt sweetness, although it does finish a little dry with soapy hops."
""
""
"Overall: Very good brew, definitely a keeper during the season in your fridge. I wouldn't hunt the world looking for it but definitely give it a go. Salud!"
""
""
""
"A very good beer from a can. I would recommend and have another."

"Smooth red ale went down easy"
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic.  Very smooth.  Love the Hops!"
"Not a huge fan of the style, but there is nothing great about it for me. By no means a bad beer, just not my thing."
"It's a little bit on the gratuitously hoppy side, which makes a like of what might otherwise be incredibly interesting subtle notes mostly disappear.  But over all, still quite nice."
""
""
"Dark orange to reddish color, with a ton of carbonation, with a two finger frothy head and good lacing.  The odor is IPA like, citrus, mandarin, orange, tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, pine, resin, rose, floral, violets.  The taste is floral, rose, pine, resin, grapefruit, malty bitter throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very flavorful amber that packs a solid hop flavor for the style.  Higher ABV comes out as the full flavor.  Somehow reminds me of the Vivant Big Red Coq, which a ""go-to.""  Given a renewed availability in MI, I could see buying a bunch.  A very solid brew."
"Unexpectedly hoppy beer for me in a cool can.  Malt could be more assertive, but makes for an easy drinking 7% ABV hop bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very solid offering - planning to enjoy the rest of these!  If there was a bit more malt backbone to chew on this would have been perfect, but still a nice beer."
""
""
"A unique take on either a winter ale or an amber ale. While hop forward, it is quite drinkable if you don’t mind a little hop bitterness. It is NOT a malt bomb (like many ambers) or festooned with massively citrusy hops, (like so many brewers are using these days). While it’s abv kinda rules it out as a session beer, the combination of unique but enjoyable flavor and lower impact on the palate makes it way more refreshing than I expected. I wouldn’t mind having several of these, so long as I’m at home or not driving!"
"The hop character plays up more so in the taste leaving a decently balanced lingering finish with the toasty malts."
"Super tasty hoppy red. Nice change of pace from the overly spiced winter brews."
""
""
""
"A can received as an extra in a trade. Lets just say I didn't finish the can. Not my cup of tea."
"I don't know if I could really call this a red. I wish it had more caramel notes. It is more of an ipa. Nonetheless it was still a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best red out there, but by no means bad. Pours red as ever with a smooth taste. I'd recommend as I enjoy Sixpoint, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to purchase again."
"on tap at rattle n' hum. pretty bland, and a hop taste i wasn't too fond of"

"A very good IPA with smooth finish."

"Clear golden amber appearance with a one finger white head that leaves a copious amount of lacing. Smell is somewhat muted - I get mostly bready malt with hints of grass and pine. Very crisp and dry with caramel malt and resiny pine. There is a nice balance here to keep the bitterness from going to far - well made beer for sure. Nice feel to it too with perfect carbonation. Sixpoint has done a nice job with this beer - highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"crystal, copper color. Hints of floral and pine. Grapefruit at the start that leads into a little caramel. Hoppier than I thought this would, overall very drinkable. Another good brew from Sixpoint."
""

""

"Stickee tofee and bread pudding meet too create a hoppy and malty ale. It's hard to classify. Maybe there is some rye used as well which adds some spice and some delayed heat on the back of he throat. It fakes you out like it is going to finish clean, then there is tons of sticky resin. They've created a monster that puts you in the holiday spirit!"
"O: [3.75] The nose on this one is great.  The mouthfeel is really nice for the style.  The taste is a little one dimensional.  I was looking for a little malt to balance the hops somewhere.  It is enjoyable but there are IPAs that are a bit more multidimentional (bringing flowers or fruit etc.)."
""
""
"Another impressive beer from Sixpoint."
"O: not sure how this falls under the amber/red category; not balanced between hops and malt as I would expect from that category; drinks more like a pale ale or an IPA;  sixpoint website says this beer can't be classified - I guess this is proof of that;  at any rate, this is a really good beer and that's all that matters;"

"The flavor is far more hoppy, giving this a long biting aftertaste. More IPA than red ale. Good Crystal malt flavored base. Rich body but with an equally elevated carbonation level. Easy to drink more than one."

"Overall / Drinkability:  Not bad. More of an IPA than an Amber/Red ale as the hops are so dominant and I didn't think the color was that seasonably red.  Nicely drinkable if you're a hophead, but I suspect others may tire of it.  I found one to be enough per evening."
""

""
""
""
""
""

""

"Not a terrible beer, however there is something about the balance that bothers me. Other amber ales that I enjoyed had a toasted malt quality that was sweet but well balanced against the hops. In this beer, I feel that the hops bitterness overpowers the other tastes I associate with amber ales. Although I would not rule out buying this one again, I'm not so enthusiastic. I love six point brewery's products, however, this one is my least favorite so far."
""
""
""
"Aroma is dank, resiny, and a touch citrusy, but the cannabis rules the day. Flavor reveals more muddled, fruity hop flavoring, which rests on a dank bed of hops that becomes substantially bitter at the finish. I'm not a bitter fan, so too much for my liking."
"Pours a dark copper with am amber hue and an off white head. Aroma grounded with biscuit and toffee, maybe even a little chocolate, paired with some floral, citrus, and pine from the hops. Flavor follows suit. Overall, love this beer. Second only to Odell's Runoff Red when it comes to favorite hoppy reds. Now I just got to try some Nugget Nectar."

"i love these little cans from sixpoint, its a nice dose of beer like this one, which is a hopped up winter warmer type with a big more layers to it than most, and none of the usually uncomfortable palate of spices that dominate the style. glowing almost bright red, orangey, but loud in looks, with a ton of tiny bubbles scurrying around in an inch of white head as soft as a feather pillow. a nose of citrusy hops, almost as spice, in place of spice, on top of a nice amber malt body which flirts with red ale and barleywine in aroma and in taste. its bigger, but the hops interrupt its sweetness at exactly the right time for me, a needed respite from what i feared would be an onslaught of residual sugar, but thats just not the case. much softer all around than expected, and balanced as they come. i don't miss spices at all in this, and appreciate the use of hops in that role. a very drinkable beer too for what it is, the effervescent carbonation sure helps that, but its somehow refreshing too, not a trait i usually ascribe to winter warmers, but i dig this. another unique and highly agreeable brew from these guys. they would look great on colorado shelves..."

"Pours a hazy, barely translucent golden with a thick and fine-bubbled buff head. Aroma is quite hoppy with a caramel and malty undertone. Flavor is resiny and hoppy, more like an IPA, with malty and caramel underpinnings. Texture is firm, smooth and lively. Prepare for the effects of global warming with this brewski."
"O: This was pretty tasty. A big beer that remains fairly easy to drink. Bitterness and dankness are the predominant impressions, but the beer is pretty put together well. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O: a very interesting beer with some things to like and some things that are a bit off-putting. Definitely try this when you are in an off-centered mood."
""
""
"Overall, one of my favorites from Sixpoint!"
""
""
"This beer seems to fall somewhere in between an amber ale and American barley wine. Aggressive hops with strong citrus notes of grapefruit, orange peel, and a light resin are well balanced by maltier hints of caramel and toffee. Well structured and enjoyable beer."

"Poured straight down the middle of a large tulip style glass it resulted in a massive three finger head. After a couple of minutes the appearance had died down to a thick fluffy cap with heavy lacing on the side of the glass. Appearance is a deep hazy amber orange with more suspended particulate floating around in there than in just about any beer I’ve ever seen - I actually poured a second to see if it was just one can, but the same held true in this case as well. Looking at other Beeradvocate reviews, this seems the norm for this beer. Am I expecting too much for a beer that costs over $10 for 4-pack to actually pour clear? Oh well. Nose is a wonderful balance of sweet malt and candied nuts with strong hop notes of potent ganja and hints of spruce and pine needles. Sip is hop forward at first, with a hint of caramel followed by big piney and grass flavors on top of the bitter notes on the middle of the tongue. Mid-palate also sees candied orange and ripe apricot, orange zest, mango, a hint of cocoa and very, very light bready notes. Back of the tongue and swallow see more uniform and one-dimensional dry tannins. The finish has hints of peach jam, mandarin oranges, and piney grapefruit hop bitters with notes of lavender. One of the defining things about this beer, for me, is the mouthfeel which has a wonderfully effervescent quality - it’s not so much that it is overly carbonated so much as it is the way the carbonation feels on the tongue. In some ways it reminds me of the feeling of a Lambrusco. All in all, this is yet another exceptional beer from Sixpoint. Yes, I’m a bit irked by the particulate, but in the end, if the flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma are all terrific, and I don’t get sick from whatever is floating in the beer, then I’m a very forgiving soul. Marketed, somewhat, as a winter warmer, this is also another example of Sixpoint refusing to play by expected stylistic rules, in this case because it’s not really a winter warmer in the traditional sense. Instead, think of this as a wonderfully hoppy amber ale, somewhat akin to Nugget Nectar, albeit less sweet, more bitter, and not quite as good, which is not so much a knock against Global Warmer so much as it is a testament to how much I love Nugget Nectar :)"

"Pours a dark orange amber hue with a fluffy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is piney hops,citrus,caramel candy and toasted malts,the mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied with a big hit of citrus first up followed by boiled candy and toffee finished with a big dose of piney bitter hops and overall it's not out of this world but quite sessionable cheers."

"O - This is a win for Six Point and they have been making some great beer. I have passed them by, but have started giving them a chance and have not been disappointed."
""
""
"Overall: Not sure I would categorized this as a red ale, but this is still a decent beer."
""
""
"O-A well made amber ale. The hops are there and are pleasant. But this does not hold a candle to Nugget Nectar."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nice big hop profile and malt balance, but they both seem to eventually unbalance each other and both get a little unwelcome."
""
""
""
"o: This is my idea of a winter warmer. More bitter than an ideal ESB or English bitter, but in that ballpark, delivering a lot of sweet malt flavor. None of the cinnamon or other strong spice notes which are a signature of so many American ""winter warmers."" But that's fine with me."
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy light brown/red with a tiny head. Smells of heavy grain with some earthy tones. Tastes of nice earthy and floral hops with a great backbone of slightly roasted malt. Beer is medium bodied good carbonation lingers a bit in the mouth, good finish. Overall a very good beer."
"Amber-brown hue with moderate suspended particulate matter. One finger white pillowy head recedes quickly with mild lacing. Smells of light caramel malts with subtle piney hops. Aroma is pretty subdued. Citrus, pine, grapefruit hop profile with nice light malt backbone. Creamy effervescent mouthfeel. I thought this might be a spiced ale like some of the winter warmers, but reminds me more of a good pale ale. Not as malty as some of the ""winter"" type beers. I would like this any time a year, but think it might be a better summer beer."
""
""
"Overall - Very drinkable at 7% ABV and carries just the right flavor profile for a winter brew. Might be a bit pricey for a 4-pack of 12 ouncers, but you wouldn't go wrong buying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: On tap, served in a tulip glass"
"Global Warmer isn't the kind of winter seasonal that'll help defrost your fingers after braving the elements; if anything, it's better suited for poolside consumption than fireplace. Don't get me wrong, I like hops at all times of the year - and nothing can brighten up a dreary winter night like tropical hops - but as I look out my window and watch the snow fall, the wind gust, and the frost build up, this just isn't doing it for me."
""
"T- I'd have it again. I'm a pretty big Sixpoint fan, and this is good, but doesn't quite live up to the better offerings of the brewry (Bengali and Diesel, I'm looking at you)"
"Overall it was a great beer since I was expecting a malty ale from the “warmer” in the title, it was a very nice hoppy surprise that went down smooth and was full of flavor. Another winner from SixPoint, this one was another treat."
""
""
""
"O- what can i say sixpoint fucking rocks! this beer has all the great red/amber ipa mixes. Lots of sweet malts and body, tons of citrus hops, just another damn fine sixpoint brew."

"Surprisingly complex and interesting - I'm a fan of this beer. My only grip is that it came in a 4 pack of 12 oz cans instead of the 16 oz cans that most other Sixpoint beers usually come in."
"Good hoppy IPA. Spicy profile fits well with the holiday release."
""
""
"Overall: I am not a big fan of ambers and while this is better than most, it still has some of the malt characteristics of an amber that make this a style I tend not to approach very often"
""
"Smelled like an IPA when I opened it and left me a bit surprised. Delivers a nice amount of hops with just enough malt base to balance and keep it in the Amber Ale side of things. Solid all around and worth a try for anyone."
""
""
""
"O: This tastes like a DIPA to me but regardless of style it's tasty just a bit monotone"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's a damn fine winter warmer, certainly an enjoyable treat for the cold weather and holidays."
""
"This was an interesting beer mostly because with the descriptions I read and then with what I thought while drinking it, I had a hard time deciding what style this beer actually was. It says on the can that it is a ""winter warmer"" which would make me think it is some kind of Scotch Ale. It is classified on this website as an Amber Ale. When I tasted it I thought more IPA since the taste was very hoppy and their was some citrus presence. Whatever style this beer wants to be though, it was very drinkable and tasty."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied. Leaves a little residue on the tongue. Definitely a dry finish."
""
""
""
""
"O) A decent ""IPA"". I know the website calls it an imperial red and it's listed on BA as an amber/red ale, but c'mon who we kidding? I tasted the hints of the red ale base but the hops overpowered the dry toasted caramel found in a normal Red Ale. The large chunks of sediment were a turnoff."
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, big shot of ""dusty"" citrus hops. Lots of tasty flavor in a small-looking can. A hop-head thumbs-up!"
""
"Overall – A rather tasty red IPA with a nice blend of grapefruit and pine hop mixed with a nice level of sweetness. A nice drinker overall."
""
""
"O: Not what I expected at all, but after having many of their other brews, I’m pretty confident that Sixpoint has a mantra like Three Floyds: every style can become an IPA if you try hard enough. But you know what, these guys have a little more finesse when it comes to all things hop; I get a more herbal, nuanced flavors from their beers. Maybe it’s because Sixpoint doesn’t overload their hoppy beers with an extra-sweet dose of malt like FFF, but that’s beside the point…I love both brewers, and I truly enjoyed this beer! Keep ‘em coming, Sixpoint!"
""
""
"O: A very solid winter beer here from Sixpoint. Definitely more ""IPA"" than winter warmer to me and that's how I like it. Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Substantial head, tons of persistent lacing. Nose is pungent, bitter, and a little sweet. Bitter nuttiness, grains are very pungent, accentuated with citrus and a touch of sweetness. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"O - I like the idea of a very flavorful hoppy beer as a holiday choice as opposed to a spiced beer. Well done as always Six Point."
""
""
""

"12 ounce can, best before 27 Mar 2014. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy dark orange/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. The brew smells like citrusy (grapefruit, orange peel) and herbal hops, bready malt, and some caramel. I think the taste follows the aroma, but there's also some light piney hops noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. I thought it was a good hoppy brew. $8.99 a 4-pack."
""
"Poured to a sam adams glass, developed a nice, off white, head with great retention and lacing. Appearance was hazy with an amber/ honey color. Aroma was maly and sweet with with floral and citrus notes. Taste had some nice hoppy notes with hints of citrus and a little spice. Mouth feel was medium with a slight bitter aftertaste."

"Hoppier than I though It'd be . A nice blast of pine with a dry finish on a moderately malty base without too much residual sugar. Christmas beer in the style of Sierra celebration, and there is nothing wrong with that. Fairly silky in the mouth and a touch of spice in the finish, but deftly done- I don't know if those are actual spices or just some spiciness from the hop blend. Either way, it adds another dimension to the beer. Well done, I enjoyed this on a chilly day."

"o: Good stuff, as always, from Sixpoint."
"More of an IPA in my opinion, but call it what you will, a pretty good beer non the less. Would need a lot more malt to stand up to the hops to really call it an amber ale."

"I am simply enamored of these new Slimline CANs! They are stylish, they allow more shelf placement and for hatas, it does not look like I am drinking beer, but Red Bull or somesuch, instead. The Crack was anything but slim, emitting a loud noise and revealing yet another brimful CAN. An inverted Glug was easy to accomplish and I quickly had to back off, lest I have overflow. The three-plus fingers of dense, rocky, light-tan head with great retention looked like a freshly-served milkshake. Color was a slightly-hazy orangish-amber and the CAN specified SRM = 17. Cool! Once more, i had some great lacing forming as the head fell. Nose was full of piney hops and I could imagine myself in a snowy pine forest by closing my eyes. Warm? Ha! The 70 IBUs had a warming impact on my tongue, however. This was one hoppy Winter Warmer, I'll tell you! That said, I am NOT complaining. ""I have partaken of a number of beers in the style which were too sweet for my refined taste," he said, shaking his golden locks. This was probably Papa Bear's Winter Warmer, right before he began his hibernation. I was thoroughly enjoying the hops' presence, even through the relatively dry finish that resulted. This was my third of these beers and I CAN imagine that I will Crack open a few more before the end of winter (which has not even begun at the time of this review)."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, slightly hazed, caramel coloring with orange highlights and a clingy, thin, off-white head. Aromas of spicy and peppery hops, tangy toffee sweet, roasted notes, and hops bitter. Flavors are very bitter forward, with highlights of pineapple and a very heavy spice profile of pepper, pine tassel, and lemon pepper. Light, effervesced body with a tangy sweet aftertaste and citrus highlights. Very balanced with a strong spice overtone throughout, and a slightly bitter, dry, crisp finish. Great lacing left along the glass. Very solid, drinkable beer."

"On the fuller end of medium body with a blast of dank, sticky hop bitterness that dominates, lingering over the sweet malt notes into a bone dry finish. Earthy, resinous and slightly spicy with dry, grassy pine needle flavor and a touch of citrus sweetness, notably grapefruit and orange peel. Underneath, there's a sweet caramel backbone balancing things out nicely with hints of toffee, hazelnut and vinous dark fruit. Again, I'm not picking up anything that makes me think of winter but this beer is well balanced and decently drinkable without sacrificing the uber fresh hop flavors. One of the better beers that I've had from Sixpoint."

"O: This is a nice hoppy red ale that tastes more like a maltier version of an American Pale Ale."

"Overall- Very nice beer, I wish It came in 4 16oz cans but other than that this is worth a try. I'm not a fan of holiday beers so a hoppy red works fine for me."

"Loved this beer, a pleasant surprise it was no spices and cheap aftershave, but a good full bodied IPA. Great color and mouth feel. Not as much alcohol as some IIPA's but that makes it more drinkable, biggest complaint is that is comes in 4 x 12oz cans, should be at least 22oz or a six pack."
""
"In the end, Global Warming is an outstanding malt-forward IPA that's perfectly suited for winter consumption, or the fourth of July, or Easter, or Halloween, or the other 362 days of the year."
""

"This beer has a reddish color body with a small foamy head. The aroma has a nice hoppy ness to it with a little malt. The taste has a very sutle hop forwardness to it, and on the finish I get a little maltness. The mouthfeel is smooth with a little hop aftertaste. Overall this is a good red ale."

"I like this beer it's has all the sense going, but this is an IPA in amber clothing."

"Overall - So glad this wasn't another garbage spice bomb winter warmer, way to own a typically ""meh"" style. Super solid brew, definitely a must try."

"O: So Sixpoint launches an Imperial Amber as its new winter seasonal. Is it evocative of the season? No, not really. This could very easily be a year-round product (and maybe it should be). But who really cares? It's a damn good beer, and they didn't force a gimmicky spiced ale onto the market just for the sake of having a more 'traditional' winter seasonal. I can appreciate that."

"O: Good stuff. Nothing earth-shattering, but a nice addition to the hoppy seasonals, e.g. Celebration, Sucks, etc."
""
"Pretty solid and enjoyable, but more hop than warmer, and more toast and malt than expected."
""
"Poured from can into tulip. Nice orangey amber color with thick froathy head. Great piney hop aroma with a nice biscuit malt backbone. Flavors of piney grassy hop - very hop forward but so well balanced with the crystal malt. Notes of bready malt and sweet caramel finish the taste. This really is a great brew."
"D - An interesting interruption of the Winter Warmer style... To be honest, I'm not quite sure what to make of this... I'm also quite confused with regard to my feelings... Certain components really work while other don't... The end result is an interesting and enjoyable yet unremarkable brew... Somewhat quaffable and hides the 7% ABV rather well..."

"These big hops are keeping the feel pretty dry all the way, but it's smooth too. Crispness is moderate but constant and light carbonation adds a certain creaminess that never dies off."
""
"Serving type: Can"
""
"O: Certainly an interesting combo of winter warmer and IPA. Things are quite muddled but it surprisingly works overall. Easy to drink. Worth seeking out for something different this Winter"

"overall; very impressed. will appeal a lot of beer drinkers, satisfying, warms u up without being too filling, will buy again this season."

"This is an excellent example of Sixpoint doing it well, as they always seem to do. There isn't much about this that throws it in the winter warmer class, though. It is simply a big AIPA, no? Nice red can. Extremely highly recommended."

"The pour is a nice amber color that epitomizes the Six Point style: not so pale and not so dark, often with some red and orange hues. The amazing thing about this beer, and what I think makes it a 'winter warmer' is that it has a rather smooth and sweet mouthfeel with a taste that is not as strong on the (nice and rounded) hops as the aroma. That balance makes it a delight. I recommend you pick this one up before I buy the rest of them."

"Nice winter warmer especially for a red ale."
"Overall - Really tasty, much more of a hop bomb then expected. This doesn't seem like a winter warmer at all, seems like sixpoints version of sierra nevada's celebration ale minus the fresh hops. Very flavorful, balanced well, and easy to enjoy. Another winner from sixpoint."
"Mouthfeel is pretty good- medium body, modestly carbonated, not too sticky. This is actually a good beer. Nothing unbelievable but good enough to distract me briefly from my celebration ale binge. Worth a try for sure."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best before 3/14. Pours a bright reddish orange, with a attractive one inch white head that leaves behind lots of sticky lace. Smell tangerine, apricot, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and faint grapefruit. Taste all of that, sweat caramel upfront, gives way to a tropical finish. Would like a little more carbonation, maybe a medium body, not really dry, and goes down easily. Nice brew, been loving the hoppy reds this late fall."

"Purchased a 4 pack of 12 oz. cans from the Galeville Byrne Dairy in Liverpool, NY. Outstanding smell - piney and grapefruit notes. Tastes is malty at first with a piney finish. Great beer. I love that they made a hoppy winter beer. Very smooth and I will be buying this in the future."

"I'm liking this one a lot and loving that more breweries are doing hoppy winter ales rather than a cinnamon spice winter warmer."

"O-pretty unique for the style, definitely plenty of hops."
""
"Overall a tasty hop forward winter ale."
""
""
"12 oz can poured into a pint glass. Orange-copper colored w/ a thick creamy head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells like skunky pine tar resin on first sniff. Fresh pine and grapefruit emerge after a bit. Characteristic winter warmer maltiness, but not sweet. Just enough hoppy bitter to balance it out. Tart grapefruit and apricot dominate the palate with toasty malt and that skunky resin."
"O-Must try! Original, definitely for hop heads. Great finish, great winter beer."
""

"12oz can with a Best Before Date of 27 march 2014 stamped on the bottom of the can. Tons of lacing. Pours a brownish amber color with an inch of frothy head. Hoppy aroma of grapefruit and pine. Hints of spices and orange. The taste is piney hops with some hints of grapefruit. Subtle spice notes. Fair amount of malt flavor as well. More hop forward but somewhat balanced. Grapefruit pith finish. Oily mouthfeel. Reminds me a bit of a maltier Resin. Overall, certainly worth seeking out."

"o - Overall a very nice beer; listed as winter warmer but more like a hoppy red ale. Nose is good and the taste has more hops to it, and the bitterness is pretty light. Would certainly have it again."

"Overall its a good beer that is quite different than the winter warmers on the market. For those who enjoy hops this is one ya gotta pick up."

"The Sixpoint folks know how to brew a drinkable beer, this is a amber ale with hops in to the 70 IBU plateau. Completely different take on a winter ale than what most of the brewers are doing right now. Aroma dank hops, herbal, pine, citrus notes but most notably some type of vegetable be it garlic/onion combo this would make sense. Flavor bready, caramelized sugars, hints of dark roasts but nothing like a real porter or stout just a hint of roasted malt. Big layers of hop bitterness, fresh hop flavors, and dank oily resinous hop oils combine on the palate for one fantastic drinking experience. Mouthfeel has slick hop oils medium bodied with even carbonation a joy on the palate with lingering spicy hop bitterness between each sip. Overall I can't wait to buy another four pack, don't think one 12 ounce ""Red Bull"" style can will hold you over, great drinking beer perfect for the holidays and Global Warming."

"Overall, another hoppy winner from SixPoint. Definitely seek this one out."
"O/D-I consistently find that I value Sixpoint's beers more than the BA populous. This is a killer beer. Also, I motion to get this changed to Winter Warmer style. Why is this a Amber/Red? Too hoppy? If they want to call it a Winter Warmer then why can't it be? Oh and by the way, the cans are cherry."
""
""
"I was surprisingly let down by the taste. It smells like it would be rich, earthy, resinous, but also malty. Instead I found it to be relatively watery and lackluster. There are those hop notes in there but they taste watered down and weak. There's no malt backbone to speak of. It's a decent beer but definitely not as good as it seems like it should be."
""
""
""
"Nice red tinted orange hue with a craggy and clingy off tan tinged head. Nose is a lot like a lot of other sixpoint hoppy stuff in a good way, super resinous and piney some citric rinds. Slick full mouthfeel. Very very hoppy throughout, bitter citric rind, lots pine , big bitterness on the back end with a touch of alcohol heat. Bitterness isn't overwhelming but rather refreshing lingering on the mid-palate rather than the back end. Toasty malt character pops it's head up here and there to let you know this is a different beer from bengali and resin. Basically it has that super classic hopped up sicpoint profile with more malt for balance and a touch of complex flavor. I like it but if bengali can be offered in 16oz cans than i think this should come in the same format."

"O - Overall a good beer. I'm not a huge Amber fan, but this one is on the higher end of the scale for me. Enjoy the warmth, enjoy the balance. Recommended."
"This is basically an IPA in my book. It's very enjoyable and possibly the best beer I've had from Sixpoint. Drink this one fresh. Recommended."

"Light almost banana-like fruitiness. Feel is crisp and somewhat chewy with a surprising heft in the mouth that shows up and pulls it all together. Easy drinkability that sets you up for night of tasting. This is good stuff. The balance is very good, with a crisp drinkability. An exceptional holiday quaffer that lends itself to a celebration and enjoyment. Yum"
