"Overall:  What a nice beer!  Malty, slightly sweet, easy to drink.  Another great beer from Colorado, and another great beer from Breckenridge.  While not quite as good a New Belgium’s Fat Tire, I could easily drink this all day, and be very happy!"
""
"Smooth despite darker appearance in glass"
""
""
"Very average not much to it."
"It's great, so I gave it a great score. That is all."
""
"The beer pours a gorgeous shade of deep reddish brown with the perfect head, but that's where the beauty really ends. The taste is very average a little bitter for such a timid beer, and you don't feel like you'll really remember drinking it after you're done. Solid, but not really anything special."
""
"Not as Amber colored as most but very balanced and drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A decent amber ale that is fairly light and nothing too big or memorable as far as flavor goes. Still not bad; easy drinking."

"Many people don't think this beer is that good, but I don't understand why.  It's a great warm-weather or session beer.  Light and ambery but not too pale, nice clear color, crisp taste.  Nothing too adventurous, but great to have around in the cooler."

"Overall: I really enjoy this beer even though it is considered just OK. An easy drinker. Great session ale. Flavor is very basic so I'll just give it a 4 (although I enjoy basic in many beers)."

"Overall it's a session amber, and one without much flavor, but it doesn't bring much else to the table other than it's easy drinking and refreshing. No major complaints but nothing too crazy either, sort of a slightly better Fat Tire vein here."

"O: A nice amber ale that would be pretty easy to clean out a cooler full. Probably would pair well with a good juicy steak or some kind of smoked meat. Big thanks to KW for sharing this one with me."

"The 4 pct ABV gives this away as the malt required to amp up the flavor is not there and it is simply too weak."
""
"I like this amber ale. Not overly carbonated, nice color, doesn't leave a bitter taste in the mouth, and very drinkable. It doesn't have much of a foamy head, but that's okay. I think it's true to its kind and would not be impossible to enjoy more than one in a sitting. Also doesn't need food to appease the palate, although it would accompany a nice pizza or deli sandwich, steak or chicken dish with no problem. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, slight caramel, and fruity aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and slight fruit flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is easy to drink but it seems fairly watery and lacking all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, drinkable for me but not enough - not enough malt, not enough hops, not enough alcohol - just too light and undecided."

"Breckenridge Avalanche Amber Style Ale ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would I drink this again? If it's on tap I'd definitely give it another shot, however there are other beers akin to this one I'd rather buy."
""
"Avalanche is a great Amber with a clean, refreshing taste. I was very surprised to find it at the local grocery chain in the Cleveland area. Even though it has traveled through many states, it tastes almost as fresh as having one in Breckenridge. This is my favorite among Colorado beers."
"D - overall pleasant. Not award winning but great for any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Decent head, and fair lacing. Buttery, bready, woody nose. Bitter wood chips and citrus pith overshadow the bready malt grains. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"Not a bad tasting amber beer, just not enough of the taste it has, if the taste of this beer were more pronounced it might actually be a pretty good drink."

"O-This is a pretty mediocre effort. The hops are nearly non-existent and the malts are not terribly interesting. I don't know if my bottle was too old, but I could not get over the grainy, metallic note that I detected on my first whiff. The barley and grains do provide flavor versus a BMC brew, but I don't know if that flavor is worth partaking in."

"Overall - SLIGHT upgrade from generic Miller Light and Bud. Generic looking, sub-par smell with a bitter taste throughout with minimal floral and caramel hints. Stick with the Miller and save yourself a couple of bucks. Would not buy again."

"Overall 3.0: Good, basic beer. Nothing special. Reminiscent of another Colorado brewery's famous beer (namely New Belgium's Fat Tire), this is an OK beer, but certainly nothing extraordinary."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing stands out but there's nothing bad either. Very drinkable."

"Overall: This is a good brew but is very mild. It seems typical for the style. It reminds me of a slightly more robust American pilsner. Might buy again if I want something light and smooth but a little more robust than a wheat type beer."
""
""
"The body's a little thinner and lighter than it should be, but otherwise it's standard stuff. Moderate carbonation lends itself to an adequate overall feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not feeling this one. It's amber in color and it's hop presence is far back for what an American might be on the lookout for. Its taste? I'm tempted to say it's an off color golden ale, and nearly lager-ish in the mouth, so it's far more on the malt side of things and probably should be paired with a sandwich and salad to bring it alive. By itself, I'm enjoying the nose more than I am the beer itself or perhaps I need to try it again in the summer time when this kind of flavor profile has something more to work with. It smells of some brown sugar and possibly a bit sour and some of the grain is coming in, with a slight plum presence. I'll bury one for a hotter day, but at the moment. This is not a beer I anticipate I'll be looking for in the future."
""
""
"O/D-Very bland. Nothing off-putting. I guess it could work if you want something really light that you will never, ever remember."
""
"The body is light to moderate. An astringent finish which is accented by a higher carbonation level. Overall a pretty easy drinking beer. Would like a touch more malt and more floral hop notes but still mostly clean."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a good beer but better than your BMC stuff. Lots of work left to do on this one. Bring out some hops on it please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with short-lived off-white head. Aroma is of grassy hops, caramel malt, some fruit and staleness. Body is medium and smooth. Grassy hops, sweet caramel malt and brown sugar (too much of it) combine on the palate. Finish is long and semi-sweet. I can’t say I enjoyed the brew."
""
""
""
"O: Over all, it was ok, I've had far, far worse, but this just doesn't stand out to me except for the cool looking bottle. Probably won,t have it again."

"A drinkable enough ale, nothing special and lacking in aroma."
""
"Hours clear amber color with a lasting white head. A slight caramel and toffee on the nose but also wet cardboard. Smells like an adjunct lager. Taste is also like an adjunct lager. A touch of light caramel and toffee and not much else. The taste is balanced and remains very drinkable but its a forget table taste. Overall, I don't know if I have a watered down version because of the alcohol laws here or its just a mediocre brew..."

"Wow...this is pretty boring... mild and minimally sweet bready malt character...a little bitterness in the aftertaste, but very little hops coming through. Light to medium body and low to moderate carbonation. This one is pretty easy to drink, but it's not exactly a beer with character. You can certainly find many more apt choices if you're looking for an amber or red ale."
"This one is pretty good for a non beer geek. A decent non offensive brew."

"I poured this flat dull beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was cloudy looking and poured a very poor head. The smelled smelled pretty good, kinda sweet like caramel candy. I had high hopes. However the taste was fruity kinda like spoiled wine. I will not buy this beer again, it was terrible."
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing and clean, the brewery's website says this is their best-selling beer. That probably has something to do with the simple and easy-drinking aspect of it. I thought it was very pleasant and went down nice with my dinner."
""
"Overall: Seems strangely mild and bland for an amber. It's OK, but certainly not my favorite amber."
""
""
""
"Almost medium bodied with a faint effervescence as I've come to expect with cask ales. Decent but gotta say, after almost a half dozen, I'm not loving the cask. Even with familiar brews they are coming across weak and almost watery. The lower carbonation is fine but where does the body go?"
""
"Final Thoughts: I wish there had been a little more to this beer. Maybe in body or the selection of malts used. It's a little too generic. However, it'd be the perfect selection for someone who is new to craft beer."
""
""
""
""
"Ouch. This is a rough one. On the first sip, I can tell that this is not too good. The load of malts is too thick with no additional flavors. Bleh. This is pretty bad. One of the worst beers I've had in quite some time. Definitely won't be able to finish it."
""
"O- really not much going on with this beer, not offensive by any means just bland. Can't see myself tryin this beer out again."
""
""
""
"O- amber ales as a whole are pretty boring, and this one does absolutely nothing to stand out from the bunch"
"O: Easy to drink but I would prefer this beer to be a little more hoppy - it is just a malt bomb and is not as well balanced as I would like. This is definitely sessionable."
""
""
""
"The beer is well made with no defects, and the slight bitterness and lack of excessive sweetness would make this a good session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a nice daily drinker for any season"
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a thin creamy head and amber color. Clear. Aroma is clean and sweet malt and slight butter. Flavor is a mild and very tasty biscuit, caramel, sweet malty mixture offset by unobtrusive bittering hops. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and CO2 is a pleasant low level. Overall, this is a balanced, mild amber session brew that I would put in my kegerator in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""
"M/O: easy to drink. Nothing special. Not to memorable. This is a beer that you could drink several in a row."
""
""
"O) Decent, but quite forgettable. There are many Amber Ales I prefer, so I don't see myself heading back to this one any time soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer would probably pair well with food but no more much than that. It really needs some more hops to make this a beer that would be interesting to drink on its own."
""
"This is a tasty ale. It is also seems lighter than it is. It has a low ABV and can be drank in large quantities."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, Avalanche Amber is a pretty solid malty amber that is worth a try."
""
"This is a flashback to the birth of craft beer movement type of amber ale. Does not appeal to this drinker anymore."
""
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall this one isn't very impressive. I wouldn't say it's bad but there are much better offerings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
":O: Easy drinker, good for a few. If it was only just a bit more robust."
""
""
""
""
""

"This one is not worth a second look. It is just another beer on the shelf. While I finished this bottle, it is clearly intended for those who do not discern the nuances of flavor or aroma. It is possible that this bottle was out of date, but that certainly cannot explain its overall mediocre nature."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OV: Good sipping beer especially for people who may not be really into craft beer yet."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"DRINKABILITY: Easy to drink and repeatable, this beer is fairly well balanced but it doesn't have a very distinct profile. The malts are a bit to sweet and leave a sort of metallic aftertaste which is a little off-putting. It needs more distinctive flavors and, with all of the really good amber ales that are readily available, I probably won't buy or serve it again."
""
""
""
""
"O- Very enjoyable brew, the drinkability is great and the flavors are just strong enough and varied enough to hold interest but mellow overall"
"By definition, this amber ale is fairly average for the style. A drinker that likes amber ales would likely find it acceptable. Most drinkers need not have it more than once."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad. An accessible winter seasonal for those who prefer such a thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste, which is always the most important thing, was really good for an amber ale. First time trying a sampler from this brewery and Avalanche was a great flavor. Has a rich caramel malt flavor but only a very tiny hop finish."
""
""
""
""
"I am very hit and miss with this one when via the bottle and more times than notits a miss. Pours amber with a minimal prickly white head. Smell is diluted but what is there is on the sweet side from the malts. Flavor wise is usually a watered down caramel malt sweetness, just a pinch of hops at the end. When I do get a good bottle, though, I find that like it a lot and it is one of my favorite ambers. Moutfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation. Overall, I stopped buying this one because I was finding I was getting watery batches way too frequently."
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottling info. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a fairly dense 2 finger off white head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, bready grain, light citrus, and spiciness. Fairly nice aromas with good strength. Taste of caramel, bready grains, herbal spiciness, pine, and a bit of citrus. Decent bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of bready grains, herbal spiciness, and light caramel. The breadiness and grain flavors are a bit odd. Decent amount of flavor, but it does come off as a bit watery. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with some prickly carbonation. Very smooth to drink at 4.4%, with no alcohol presence. Overall this is an ok amber ale. A little too bready, and not as much hop character as I would like. Easy to drink though."
""
""
"It's hard to believe that there's any alcohol in this since I couldn't taste it and the carbonation was practically nonexistent. This beer reminded me a bit of the Agave Wheat since the back was so light and had a bit of that fruit-type feel to it. This is only worth a try for the die-hard Breckenridge fans and although I like these guys for the lighter offerings that they bring to the table, this just didn't cut it for me."
""
""
"It was decently sessionable, but not great overall."
""
"Taste like a macro micro."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, I had to comeback and edit my review. This is simply a beer I could drink all day. I like it's biscuit and buttery profile a lot. Great all year long."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I normally don't like amber ales but this one is so watered down it's not as bad to me haha."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer presents a hazy, ruby-amber coloring, with a split second of thin head that completely disappears within moments. Rich caramel and toffee aromas, with a slight roasted/toasted characteristic. The beer's flavors are extremely watered down, giving the malty profiles a wierd, uncomfortable tang. The roastiness comes out in a rusty flavor. Not good tasting any way you look at it. The watery characteristic gives off a metallic aftertaste on the light body. The finish is nondecript after everything else. There are much better ambers out there, folks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is not great though, really grainy on the finish, most of the flavors are considerably weaker than the aftertaste. I drank the whole thing so it is palatable but it is not much beyond that. Not a repeat."
""
"Pours a cloudy amber with a small short lived off white head. Aroma and Taste of sweet lightly toasted caramel malt, yeast, some fruity notes, light hops. Palate is light to medium body, moderate carbonation, and kind of watery mouth feel. Finish is sweet caramel malt, yeast, and some light fruity notes, ending is bit of funky nuttiness. Overall needs more backbone and flavor, seems a bit weak for an amber, just an ok brew"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Not an outstanding beer. I have had better amber ales."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a smooth beer that would pair well with food, but it is not all that memorable on its own. It's one of those beers that pretty much does all that you would expect it to and nothing more."
"O- There's not much to this beer but it did go well with my burger and fries. Nothing exciting but it's an easy drinker."
"O - easy drinking ale, pretty average, nothing bad, nothing memorable"
"Caramel malt flavor. Light, a bit watery. Perhaps a bit too sweet. Underwhelming and simply not that good. Light to Medium body. Very flat carbonation. Lingering sweet malty finish. Dissapointing."
"Light bodied with good carbonation. I actually thought it was a little over-carbonated. It was fine to have with dinner I guess, but I might as well have gone with having water. The taste was just not there for me. Not recommended."
"O - This is what I call a ""wash it down"" beer. Its got simple flavors and equates to not much more than a beverage to go with dinner."
"2.5 D: This is a not-quite-mediocre brew. I'll pass on it from now on."
"Breckenridge Brewery Avalanche Ale: I have fond memories of good times at the original Breckenridge Brewery in Breckenridge. It has been a while since I have had an Avalanche Ale, and needing to bring a six pack over to a friends for dinner was my opportunity to re-visit is brew. The mahogany brown body is almost clear, with very light carbonation. The off-white head is thin, and the aroma is very faint, almost not there. The color makes you expect a heavy malty roasty brew, but the flavor and feel is actually quite light, with a mild malt flavor and a light bitterness throughout. No flower y hops here! This is very much an English style ale. Quite drinkable, but my taste in beer has moved on to brews with more complexity."
"D: Drinkable, but lacks depth. Somewhere in the middle. Not that interesting, but certainly decent."
"a decent amber. a malty sturdy nose, malty sweet red pour with a respectable off-white head, quick grainy mild finish, medium body. nothing remarkable in an otherworldly sense, yet a repeatably satisfying drink. 6pack no worries, its just above average, but good vibes..."
"Overall decent. A little bitter at the end. Could be fuller."
"O- falls short overall. Needs more distinguishing flavors and better head retention. Drinkable but would have to be at the right price to buy again"
"O- Will not buy again. i love my local brews but this one kicked me in the nuts. I hope they can do better with other's i might try."
"D - not a great example of the style. It's drinkable but I think I'd pass in this one."
"O: This was a tad disappointing.... but I've had worse."
"Overall: Just an average drinkable beer here folks. Easy drinking, but lacking flavor and character. I wonder if it loses some of its flavor on the way over here from Colorado."
"Alright, ""nothing offensive"" I said, although ""blah"" is, in my beer-world, offensive. But rather than get all huffy about it, I'll just not buy the stuff again. Easy, over 'n' out..."
"O: Just an ok amber ale – nothing special or something I will remember."
"O: Pretty drinkable amber ale. Average appearance and taste. Mouthfeel wasn't that great."
"The beer is amber hued with a small head. The aroma brings some sweet malt and hints of fruit. the flavor is alright. Slightly sweet, malty, and generally uneventful. A light hop presence emerges in the finish, with a soft bitterness (possibly the most exciting aspect of the beer). The body is relatively thin, with minimal alcohol presence. The flavor dissipates quickly after each swallow. Overall, this beer is unoffensive but really bland. I'll finish my pint, but I don't see myself having this again."
"O: Its very easy to drink as there are no offense flavors however there is little to no character either. Though not bad, nothing stands out making this on a C+ or so ""decent"" beer."
"Picked up the beer during a APS conference in Denver my Junior year of undergrad. It's been sitting in my various fridges ever since. Other beers have survived this amount of cellaring quite well (around 2.5 years) and I checked my review with others to see similar observations. Therefore, this review stands and this beer is in general a sub-par, lackluster example of an amber."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with no head or lace. The aroma is of fruit and toast with a hint of toffee. It's flavor has caramel, dough, and hoppy fruit notes with a touch of root beer in the finish. It has a medium-light mouthfeel with very mild carbonation. Breckenridge Avalanche Ale is a good beer, dry, and refreshing. Recommended."
"I like Breckenridge, as I think they do have some flavorful and creative offerings. Unfortunately, their flagship beer leaves much to be desired."
"overall: this is the first Breckenridge that did not build my hopes up with the look and smell only to dissapoint me in the taste; nothing spectacular but also fairly drinkable."
"O- I was actually surprised by this beer. I usually don't care for amber ales, but this one was mild and refreshing."
"Overall, this beer was OK, drank fine last night. But not very complex, and not worth going out of your way for."
"Poured a bright, translucent amber; little head, lacing to match. Most enjoyable part of this beer is the smell. . . sweet and nutty aromas, hints of brown sugar. The taste, unfortunately, didn't impress as much. The overall flavor seemed a bit thin. The hop profile didn't come through much in the aroma, and didn't exist much in the taste, less a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. I expected more noticeable sweetness, but it just didn't come through. The mouthfeel was relatively thin, but the lightness accompanied by a good amount of carbonation gave an overall sessionable feel."
"The flagship beer and last one to try in the mixed pack. Pours a cloudy orange, nice little head to it. Bit of a macro beer smell to it.. uh oh. Taste is medium bodied, surprisingly good mouthfeel. Well balanced with a nice bit of hops to it, super drinkable and really hits the spot. I know this may be the 'generic mass produced micro' for this brewery, but for some reason I find it delicious and really refreshing. Yummy and no frills, give it a try."
"Notes: The first time I had this beer was about ten years ago then I had it again a couple years later. This time I was lucky enough to find this one at New England Wine and Spirits in Newburyport. It's as tasty as it ever was which is very good. Cheers."
"O: Overall a sweet toasted flavor with moderate regards but falls a bit short in other aspects (appearance, aroma), which shouldn’t be a problem for the average drinker. Don’t know if I could recommend this by the six pack."
"It is easy enough to drink, though nothing exciting. An average-ish brew."
"An auburn color with almost no head. The aroma is weak with just a small amount of lightly burnt caramel malt. No hops are present. The flavor is crisp and light with the faintly burnt malt carrying over from the nose. Some grassy hops but only slightly. Ice cold this beer goes down smooth. Overall this tastes like a borderline adjunct."
"D: Somewhat average beer, not bad but nothing special."
"Copper in color. Light tan head that's gone right quick and in a hurry. Little dots of lacing. Pretty average. Nose is biscuity with some floral hops. Hmmmm. Not to complex but strong. Taste is bitter and a bit sharp around the edges. Has some medicinal properties in the background. Light bodied with high carbonation. Which makes it even less refined. Slightly above average. Got this in a Sampler 12 pack. At 8 to 9 dollars I would not buy a six pack. Worth a try though."
"Put it all together and you get a slightly better then middle of the road amber...yawn"
"Tastes much the same - bread. A hint of roastiness and a minimal hop snap at the finish. Straight-forward and sturdy, and a solid session amber ale."
"Overall: Better than average...I don't know how this only has a C+ rating at the time of this posting...it's really good."
"I was under the impression that this beer also had a cult following like another CO amber but I was very disappointed by the lack of taste here, balance is achieved by minimizing. At least it does a good impression of the Beatles, ""Help! I need some BODY."""
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent amber with a quarter inch, loose, fizzy, off-white head that sizzles and dissipates into a sudsy skim. Nose is not much to write home about - cereal grains and a trace of noble hops if I had to guess. Taste follows nose and culminates in a slightly bready aftertaste. There's also a faint citrus character present. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively effervescence and a crisp finish. A pretty lackluster American Amber - closer to a macro in taste and smell. I'm going to need to wash this one down with a Cascazilla."
"D - I wouldn't send this beer back but I wouldn't order another. There is nothing technically wrong with this beer but it is so boring. I understand that the style should be expected to be well balanced but there is almost nothing to balance here. The beer is not just middle of the road, which would be understandable, it's like it never really bothers to leave the driveway."
"I'll finish what I have but don't need anymore."
"Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability. I'd attribute this to the good aftertaste."
"I wasn't able to drink this from a glass, so I can't comment on the color or head. Basically, this was a good flavored beer that had a flat characteristic. It is actually not bad, even though it reminds me slightly of two beers I don't like, Bells ""Oarsman"" and Four Horseman's ""Irish Red"". Both of those are very flat, yet their sour profiles render them almost undrinkable to me. The nice flavor of this makes it pretty drinkable. Would I buy a six pack of it though? Probably not."
"DB- A malty, fruity amber and there is nothing wrong with that. It is fruitier than any amber I have had but it would work better if it didn't feel diluted."
"The liquid is a copper color with a thin, white, bubbly head. You can smell lots of toasted malt, butter, there is a slightly herbal presence in the background. The taste consists of toasted bread, there is a tangy bite on the sides of the mouth and a hint of lemon. The beer is light and has sharp carbonation. This is an average beer, I could drink a lot of them but would probably get bored."
"Smells of lightly sweet and bready malts with hints of nuttiness and leafy hops. Flavors lean more nutty and tangy. Hop presence is modest and tealike. Although it's a keg and thus I must assume it's fresh, there are hints of an odd staleness, almost like some crackers sitting in a box a couple of weeks past the 'best by' date. Not something I'd revisit."
"Notes: Way too faint, watery, and lacking. Has some vague English flavors, but not done well. A touch of caramel/toffee but the taste has too much toasted grain. Similar problem with the hops having a slightly tea flavor but more bitter slightly grassy flavors."
"This an easy drinker. Sweet but subtle flavors. Has a good finish."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle stamped 05820B. Sampled on February 19, 2011. The amber colored pour was attractive but little head despite an aggressive pour. Grainy aroma with sweet malts and bread mingled in. The body is rather light. The taste tends to come across as more grainy than anything else. It went down very fast though."
"It has a lot of off flavors and isn't very clean. It tastes like too much sugar was added to this brew."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Apparently this is the special of the month, which is honestly the only reason that I had it. This beer pours a nice reddish amber color with a thin remnant of white foam coating the surface of the beer. The smell is a tad bit sweet, there may have been a twinge of adjunct, but the aromatics were so faint I really couldn't pick up much. This beer has a pretty distinct malt characteristic with a gritty earthy bitterness to the back end of the flavor that while not making it unpleasant doesn't make it anything worth going back for more. The mouthfeel is a tad watery and bitter but not too much to take away from the beer itself. I had no problem drinking the beer, but I'm glad that it was on special, because to me that meant it was closer to being priced right."
"Drink is not great either, its light and crisp, but the bad flavors just don't go well."
"Mostly grainy, some residual sugars, very low hop level. Still there is an off-ness to the flavor which I believe is primarily from the aroma. The body is decent, but can't make up for the rest."
"Drinkability: Very good beer that I enjoyed. I thought the smoothness of the beer made it easy to drink. It is straight forward and subtle which I find appealing. I would drink again."
"A beer that promised more than it could deliver."
"Ontap at the Breck in Colorado during a ski trip - into a pint glass (as well as out of cans before). Poured yellowish/orange with 1/4 inch white head that limped into a ring. Smelt of slight hints of roast and sweet maltiness. Taste begins sweet and bready and dissipates with a hint of sour fruit and moss merging towards the end. Less hops than a elephant. Mouthfeel was light. Overall, a fairly disappointing amber that could use less sweetness and more malty bite or hops."
"Drinkability is average, something I could drink all day, but probably would pick up something else instead."
"D - Not really something I would seek out again and really not much more flavor than a typical amber lager but it was still cool to try in a can."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Overall this would have been a decent beer but the soapy taste ruined it for me. Everything but the taste is decent. Will not buy this again."
"Not a drain pour, but not something to seek either. Certainly plenty of more interesting ambers on the shelves."
"This was a decent Amber Ale. I thought that the hop profile could have been cleaned up a little but this was mostly flavorful and the crisp yet still mostly smooth body helped out the drinkibility. Of their beers, this was probably a good one for Breckenridge to put in cans."
"D: Average brew, not too memorable. Fairly drinkable."
"Medium body, very doughy but easy to drink, good session beer but overall not terribly impressive."
"D - see taste"
"D- Eh a decent standard drinker, I'd say about par with SA BL."
"Drinkability - Different taste is fairly intriguing. I'd be willing to drink more just to figure this one out."
"Pours a moderate amber color. A bit thick with an off who're head. Nose is pretty plain with some doughy caramel and a bit of nuts. Nutty in the taste with mild toast and that is about it. Medium body and somewhat chewy. Drinks okay. Nothing wrong, just not super flavorful."
"D- This beer is very very drinkable. Not the most in the fuller flavor department but a decent amber ale nevertheless. The ABV on this one makes it a easy drinker but I would want to go with a fuller flavor amber personally."
"Notes - In most respects, it's a pretty typical amber ale. The acidic finish is a bit weird, but it's not strong enough to be truly unpleasant. I wouldn't turn one down if offered, but there's better ambers out there."
"Drinkability - This is a decent brew. Not outstanding, but nowhere near horrible. I like it ok and would give it a second try if someone offered. Beats any ""macro"" by a long shot in my opinion."
"D: drinks like marzen, so not too bad. flavors are simple"
"D: High drinkability, easily session-able."
"Vigorous pour produces 2 fingers of head which quickly fades. It appears a light golden color. I smell bready malts and sone caramel. Tastes are malts, some hops at the end, kinda flavorless. Mouthfeel is very light and has hardly any carbonation. Drinkability is good because it is so light, mediocre."
"Overall: not a very good amber ale. I feel no need to have this again."
"just ok. not bad out of the can."
"Drinks ok. 3. Not bad but I liked the others in the sampler better, especially the IPA. Not a bad brewery tho, I'd like to sample more of their offerings."
"I'm a big fan of fine canned beers, and this one delivers. I should note a quick caveat: I have a soft spot for this beer because it reminds me of being in Breckenridge. Otherwise, it tastes strong of the amber, goes down cool crisp and refreshing, and you can thoroughly enjoy another one. It may be true that I would drop this to a slightly lower rating if not for some biases I hold in its favor, but whatever, they are there, and this is my review. It's not the greatest of all things, but it treats me right."
"D: A solid amber, I wish it was a little hoppier, but what are you going to do. I liked it, but really nothing I'd repurchase."
"D) Not very good at all. I don't know if this is a bad beer, but this is the second one I have tried over the course of three days and both have been unpleasant. I won't be drinking another one of these. In regards to style, I don't think it fits."
"Chalk it up as sheer genius, or clumbsy brilliance, Breckenridge has done something great with this one. Out of a can, that I have overlooked for a year in my local shop. Pours a tastilizingly huge head spilling over on the garage floor. Smells rather mundane. Not much to speak of here, moving along to the taste. Nuts and berry's and herbs. Piney, hoppy. Hits the mouth with a zesty bite with lots of creamy overtones. Finishes like something from belgium.Very easy do drink. Goes down too good. This beer is hard to put in a pigeon hole. I think it is all over the board, from its Irish Ale like carbonation and bite, but rather close to a northwest pale ale in character. All I know is I love it and at 14 bucks for a 12 pack of cans, you just can""t beat it. Nicely done."
"Would I buy more of it? - can I try some of the Lucky U IPA first and then decide?"
"Unfortunately, Breckenridge cost does not match their quality. Won't be having this again anytime soon."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a bronze color with a small head. Smell is mild, some malts and hops. Taste is good, malts with some notes of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a good quality brew."
"Drinkability: A medium drink, not a favorite for the cellar but decent."
"Notes: It looks like I'm in the minority on this beer. I've had it bottled before, and I can tell you that it was better out of the can. I especially like the fact that this beer is sessionable, and packs some good flavor for being a lower ABV."
"Drinkability is moderate. The beer is relatively sessionable, however the flavor profile is a bit boring which doesn't encourage me to keep picking it back up."
"D - though it will not be mistaken for a world-class brew, this one is easy to suck down since it is thin and flavorful; without the sticky finish, it would score a half-tick higher"
"This beer has a C+? Man, there are some haters in the room. This is far closer to an amber lager or Irish red in terms of taste and feel, but I'm not going to knock a good beer for deviating from a typical American red. Sure, it's smooth and drinkable, but there's still substance. The malt have an interesting sourdough tang with light caramel and bread crust notes. There's a slight hint of hops and a little bit of roast grain and cocoa. I call this good beer and would be happy to order a pitcher. This beer tastes a lot like Yuengling Lager would if it were made by a craft brewer."
"Medium bodied that is decently enjoyable although not one I would buy (unless faced with a ball-park scenario in which this is the only craft option). This might make a good, ""introduction to amber ales"" for people interested in trying the style."
"Pours a decent mid-red-copper color, but with just a touch of initial head and no lacing. Very sweet malty scent, very lager-ish with a slightly skunky aroma underneath. Decent flavor, mostly a sweet (almost too sweet) malt flavor with just hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. Goes down fairly smooth, but without a lot of interesting flavor profiles."
"Decent beer, but doesn't do much for me."
"M/D: Mild/moderate carbonation. I would not drink this beer again, wasn't very pleasant. It had a bitter aftertaste, but not in a good way. I would be more upset if I bought an entire 6pk, and not as a single."
"D: I don't know if I would ever have again, but it certainly is worth a try."
"Poured a slightly hazy copper with an OK tannish head (gone quickly..) with little stick. Smell is mostly modest toasted malt. Taste is upper end, tip-of-the-tongue sweet malts with a slightly metallic mid-tongue bitterness to finish. Smooth brew, the light taste lasts for a bit. Nothing too extraordinary, but worth the try."
"(D)- Not a big fan of this. Way too sweet & sugary even for the style."
"Poured into a pint glass, beautiful deep amber color with a tiny bit of white head, good lacing. Smells is slightly floral with biscuity malt. Taste is a little underwhelming, there is a malt presence but nothing spectacular, the same can be said of the hops to a lesser extent. This is kind of a middle of the road beer. It's very mild and doesn't have anything disagreeable in it. Certainly more drinkable than Miller Lite! I'm glad I only bought one 12 ouncer though, I wouldn't get a six-pack of this."
"Pumpkin orange with blonde highlights and a creamy tan head that leaves blobs of sticky lace on the glass. Toasted grain, caramel and light fruity hops make up the smell. Sweet and caramely with a mineraly flavor and herbal hop notes in the finish. Medium light bodied with mild carbonation. A decent session beer."
"Overall: Thanks to Josh for this beer. It is a bit mild for me, but it is good for the style. It is a nice solid beer."
"D - Not a beer that I enjoyed. Too much malts and not enough hops. A poor beer overall."
"I am surprised this ale is not rated higher. It is certainly not the most complex ales available but it does have good flavor and drinkability. For an amber style ale, it is very good. Perhaps the ale tastes better when packaged in a can. I noticed there were no other reviews of this product from a can."
"D - As average is this brew is compared to others in the style, it's still a beer I would take any day over a macro. I found myself emptying my pint glass surprisingly fast while drinking it, and I could see this as being an excellent Summer brew."
"Looks Good being poured with a medium amount of carbonation. Color is an amber color with 2 fingers of quickly dissipating head leaving a small amount of lacing. First taste is of sweet caramel and earthy hops. Very nice with a big fried bacon cheese burger. Medium-Light body with a nice light malty finsih."
"Overall, The pitcher went fast and was enjoyable for the most part. Its really not the most impressive beer, but its worth a try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium to full bodied, good level of carbonation. Not a chore to put one of these down but not at all exciting."
"Drinkability: Something struck me as all too familiar once I started this beer. It's just a little too generic. I am a fan of the American amber/red ales, but this one wasn't that surprising and worthy for me to keep this beer stacked in my fridge. I would recommand it to my friend, who is just starting to spread his experimenting good beers wings. Well I don't wish to slam this beer entirely. Cheers!"
"The feel is light and not drinkable, total drain pour."
"Wont be buying this again!"
"D- It'd be easier to drink if it tasted better, but that seems obvious."
"D - Decent drinkability. ABV doesn't appear to be high. Not filling. Flavors are not overbearing. No unpleasant attributes."
"Not extremely impressed with this one. Copper colored with little or no head, smell is malty to start, followed by a hint of citrus. Taste follows suit, bready malts with some hop bitterness, but also some strange metallic taste to it too. MF is light bodied and thin, good for drinking a few of these, but not great for enjoyment. Not bad, but there are definitely better ambers out there."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy orange-red color with a small, frothy off-white head, fair lacing. Aroma is sweet, pale malts, nuts, a touch of yeast, and light earthy hops. Flavor is caramel, apples, yeast, a hint of citrus and earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light to medium, dry, and bitter. Pretty drinkable beer."
"kinda dry for the style and finishes with a classic english sweetness. nothing too special but a pretty trustworthy amber that is sort of a brown...but not really"
"I won't be buying this again, but wouldn't turn down a free one. If you're an Amber Ale fan - like me - you'll be better served looking elsewhere. If you like the idea of caramel and pine - buy it."
"Body was light, feel was kind of dry.... err yea. It looked good, but the buck stopped there. I was thirsty so I drank it."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium bodied on the palate, enhanced so by the low level of carbonation. This one finishes very clean. It is easy to drink and I can see this easily being a session beer. I wouldn't go in search of this beer, but I'd not be afraid to buy it either. I'll definitely be trying others before coming back to this one. Not bad but not great, just average."
"Drinkability: Nothing out of the ordinary but very sessionable. I do like the mix of malt and hops. This one is better on draft."
"D - Decent flavor coupled with great drinkability means score for this beer! Perfect for a sessioner that tastes good but one you don't have to think about."
"D: For me, this is a decent session beer. It goes down easily enough. A little more complexity would be nice."
"Overall, nothing crazy here, fresh and drinkable, would make a nice session beer"
"sorry Breckenridge, i won't be seeking this one out again."
"D=drinkable, though I would probably go elsewhere most times."
"This one pours a pretty orange color with one finger of white head. Smells of malt, bread, and a hint of fruit. Tastes initially of malt, some fruit alongs the lines of a belgian. As I worked my way through it, the flavor seemed to become less interesting than at the first. No flaws, just no complexity that you expect when it warms. Carbonation is solid, and this is very drinkable, but nothing special for an amber."
"D: Good taste, medium to light body and easy to drink. I could easily drink a few of these without feeling overly full. Overall, a pretty tasty amber ale, but nothing spectacular."
"Beach/Shore: Ten Fidy is getting shut out. I have had so many really good CANned micros that to take a monster like that would be criminal. I am going to write a short, fictional mystery story ala Hitchcock about a wife who gives her hubby a sendoff with Ten Fidy at the beach. This is much more suitable for a day on the beach."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination that was pretty easy drinking. A decent amber ale all around and worth a go."
"Breckenridge Avalanche Ale pours an amber color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the malty end. The flavor is malty and there is a touch of hops. This beer is nothing special, but it's easy enough to drink, decent session beer."
"Drinkability: this one was a bit boring for me personally so drinking more than one or two of these may be difficult if looking for a flavorful session beer."
"Pours a clear amber with moderate head, mostly diminishing. Reminds me of a Samuel Adams Boston Lager, but maybe one that's sat around awhile. Biscuit, caramel malts with decent balance. Just not very enlightening. I would gladly partake of if offered, but do not think I will purchase again. Best I can say is kind of like a Sam Adams bastard twin - not up to snuff of the real thing."
"Nice dark brown color almost copper. Very faint malty smell. I have had a few beers from Breckenridge and have been impressed but this ain't it. Can taste malt but the texture is way too thin and so are the flavors. This beer might be better with higher carbonation. Drinkable, yes but not sure you would want to have more than one."
"Drinkability- Quite sessionable. I may have found my new stock beer for the summer."
"Appears a clear amber with a light khaki head forms thick initially leaving behind thin lacing around my new Dollar Tree tulip chalice. Aromatics are a bit timid with watery caramel and some mineral tones peeking through as well. Not much hop action going on in the nose or flavor and the aroma just smells like some grains watered down with minimal caramel notes. Flavor is pretty expected of Breckenridge, flagship amber comes watery and not real assertive or cohesive with the flavors. Minimal toasted nut with caramel and a tart grain husk offness, not much hop flavor with minimal bitterness from the lack of hops. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a watery feel with a sharp bitey mouthfeel mainly from the carbonation level. Drinkability is pretty weak not a beer I would welcome back in the future, I'd rather drink fresh Goose Island Honker's for 6.50 a sixer or better yet some cans of Yuengling Amber Lager. At least you don't expect much from the canned regional brewery."
"Overall - Avoid at all cost. Makes me appreciate my Local brewery's Amber Ale that much more [Native Amber by COOP Ale Works]"
"Bought this on a whim because I was feeling something light. This definitely was nothing special but good for having a few over dinner and a game. Pours gold with not much head. Smells almost like stale beer. Taste was slightly metalic but more complex than other ambers ive tried. Low ABV makes this a decent session beer. Like I said before, nothing great but not a bad offering in my opinion."
"Boring really; this is one to avoid, it's not impressive past the cool label. Maybe it's better at the brewery."
"Had this at the Flying Saucer Houston. Poured in a pint glass. Pours an amber color with a thin light head. Very weak aroma, just some malts and very faint caramel. Very watery tasting with not enough hops profile. Some very light grassiness in the end but not enough. Very weak and boring. Blaaaahhhh. Was very dissapointing. Will not try again."
"Pours a thick head which dissipates very slowly. A pretty pleasant smell, although not a lot of hints of much of anything. The taste falls rather flat. I don't get much flavor out of it. Easy to drink, but without much taste, why would you?I just purchased one of these from a store that allows mix and match, so hopefully maybe it is just this one beer that doesn't pass inspection"
"The smell is okay, with hints of malt and grain present. No real hop odor is present. Pours a medium red color with a half-finger foam. Taste follows suit. A solid malt backbone, but no hops to speak off. Solid, and decent tasting. Mouthfeel is alright, but nothing spectacular. It's highly drinkable. A great session ale if its your only option. Not a huge amount of flavor, but a decent enough offering."
"Overall, this is an easy drinking simple beer. Nothing to special about it that and I don't plan on buying any of this. I am still trying to find some decent Red Ales (crossing my fingers for Summit Horizon)."
"Easy to drink but nothing special."
"It was a good beer not memorable, poured red not an impressive smell, it seems to be a beer that is not an impressive amber which happens to be my favorite beer selection besides wheat beers. it is one that I will not kick out of bed but not a go to beer by any means."
"D: Drinkable, but nothing special."
"Finally, this is the last beer from Breckenridge's Sampler, the Agave Wheat and Vanilla Porter were drain pours, while this beer, along with their Oatmeal Stout, have at least redeemed themselves some. It's got a nice light tan head and decent lacing over a dark gold body (I guess that qualifies as amber) with some lighter soft edges. Little visible carbonation though you can feel it. The scent is unremarkable, grain and sweet grass with maybe a little orchard fruit and light citrus. The flavor is about the same with a lingering citrus finish that's not quite dry. There's a medium to maybe a medium full feel to it, possibly from the carbonation. Not a great ale and yet not a bad ale. Not something I'll seek out again as they don't date the bottles or cases and I can get known fresh beers from other breweries. So There!!"
"Somewhat of a thick feeling on the palate, goes down smooth; no unpleasant aftertaste."
"Small off-white head sits on top of an amber body. No carbonation whatsoever. The smell is of malts, no hops are noticeable. This could probably pass as an Irish red ale. The taste is also mainly malts. Little bit of a bitter finish."
"Don't drink and review."
"As for if I would buy this again, not likely. It wasn't a bad drink, just average in most areas."
"D: A decent session option but not much else to recommend it."
"Nice, but average and a bit watery at times."
"Fairly typical amber, not bad not great."
"A very fine textured but minimal amount of carbonation makes for a rather dull mouthfeel. Semidry with a not-so-clean finish. Not a bad tasting or smelling brew but the mouthfeel certainly leaves something to be desired. An average selection at best."
"Pours a typical amber color with a little head that does not leave much lace. The smell and taste are both malty with a little hop presence. Not much to the drinkabllity. I see it as just an average, run-of-the-mill amber ale. It is nothing special and does not impress me very much."
"D - Not a bad session beer at all its very easy to drink with a good taste to it worth trying sometime"
"Poured from the tap a clear amber with a very thin off white head that was gone in a flash,big caramel malt aromas with some fruity esters,not much hop presence found.Flavors are agin sweeter and malt tilted,caramel biscuit with a touch of grain,some lingering fruit notes in the finish.Eh if you like old school malt tilted ambers you'll like this,me not so much."
"Pours a caramely amber with rusty highlights, the off-white cap provides ample lacing as it slowly fades to a thin cap that retains the duration. The nose is subtly sweet with caramel, some light floral and soft metallic notes, like dirty water(I'm not impressed). A moderate amount of caramel and lightly toasted bread crust makes up the best this has to offer. Metallic notes work in the opposite direction of the sweet base and creates a conflict with my pallet that I just can't get passed. Some light fruitiness and earthy hoppiness is an effort at complexity and flavor, sadly this falls well short of a complete finish, and really it was off to a poor start. The mouthfeel is even less impressive, thin and boring. I can't say I would never drink this again, but there is no reason to go out of your way to find this."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly hazy, ruby-copper color with a one inch head of creamy looking foam. Smell is pretty much all sweet, crystal malts dominate. The taste is also very malty, almost like amber LME syrup. There is some hops present but not enough to balance. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would have prefered as was the carbonation. Overall, drinkability suffers due to the unbalanced sweetness of the beer but it does go down like water due to the consistancy. Good beer if you like sweet amber ales."
"Avalanche is medium bodied with a slight sweetness and maltiness which fades quickly to a hop finish. The hops are fairly smooth and not overbearing. It is almost like a pale ale meets an amber."
"Drinkability: this is a different beer than I expected and takes a while to get used to. Nice work for a truly unique beer!"
"A hazy amber color pour with a medium off white head.Aroma of grainy caramel malt,and some spicy hops in the background.Flavor is Matly up front, that mellowed into a fruity flavor. The crisp hops gave it a fairly clean finish, with only a little residual sweetness.Pretty good drinkability.An avrage amber."
"Notes from and tasted on: 12/14/06"
"M/D: The beer has a medium to light body, with good carbonation for the style. The beer was smooth and easy to drink. Not a bad beer but not a great one either, just a down the middle good beer. This is a beer that I won't seek out or necessarily order if I see it on tap, but one that I will pick up from time to time."
"Sampled this at a Colorado Bee event during Philadelphia Beer wek and wasn't very impressed. Pours a cloudy amber color with a thin foamy white head. Aroma is mostly malty with a bit of a hop presence. Malty flavor with hints of caramel and a dry hop finish."
"A pretty light bodied beer. A tad watery, but not altogether bad with just the right amount of carbonation. Leaves a sort of sweetness on your palette. I thought this actually tasted better than what I was expecting, but still not very impressive."
"Overall not a bad little ale, not the best thing, but a solid effort none the less. I would not have an issue with trying this one again in the future. Cannot wait to get even more quality offerings in around here from Breckenridge, They are a damn fine brewer. Following this up with a vanilla porter hit the spot."
"Pours a body that is golden brown in color, and medium sized head that is fairly diminishing. Has a complex aroma, hops and fruit. Taste is slightly dry, semi-sweet, but with not much aftertaste. Not too complex a palate."
"This beer is a hazy amber/red in color that has a creamy, thin tan head after a medium pour. Smell is of rust, really not very good. Taste is better, biscuity malt, a hint of woodyness and tartness, with a slightly sour aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, good carbonation. Pretty drinkable, I've had much better Amber Ales before though. I would drink it again, but would not seek it out specifically."
"Overall I continue to be disappointed by Breckenridge's brews with the notable exception of 471 Small Batch. One of these days I'm sure I'll find another one that measures up, but I'd stay away from this one."
"This ale pours a dark amber, with very little head. Not very attractive. There is no nose detectable to me. This is matched by a very light flavor, disappointing for an amber ale that should have more robust flavor. The malt is simple and not at all complex, and the flavor dissipates completely at the finish. Drinkable if you're thirsty, but not if you're craving some good beer flavor."
"D: On the whole, this is a terribly average beer in many ways. It's just very, very uninteresting."
"D - An easy drinking beer but not special enough to rate much above average."
"mid body with good carbonation. could do session. drinks well. i like this beer."
"Drinkability on this beer is average. I don't mind it, but probably will not seek it out."
"If, at a social gathering, this was what was available to drink, I'd be alright with it. I just won't be filling the fridge with it anytime soon."
"Pours a deep amberish copper with a small bubbly off-white head that dissipated to a ring fairly quickly, leaving almost no lacing. The aroma is a mix of generic grains and sweet bready malts. The taste was big on the sweet malts with a sourish, almost metallic finish. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with decent carbonation with the lingering sourness being a little off-putting. This is a fair amber, but not one that I would buy again."
"This beer is pretty good for what it is; though it's billed as an amber ale, it's somewhat darker in color. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot in terms of flavor, but the biscuity malt tones are quite good and they're not too strongly masked by hoppy bitterness. As with the other Breckenridge brews that I've had, I'm relatively pleased with this one. At least try it if you haven't - at its very worst it's not any worse than average."
"This is just a simple, easy drinking, not bad, not great, malty beer from a great little brewery. The body is a deep amber color with big red undertones. The head is pretty minimal and turns to a slightly noticeable film. The nose is almost all malt. Big hits of vienna and crystal malts are dominant. Definitely not a bad thing, but not necessarily my favorite. Very faint hops found anywhere. The taste is smooth, malty and slightly metallic on the swallow. There is almost a touch or rye spiciness on the swallow. The bittering hops come through a bit and add a layer of coarse dryness. Body is moderately full, but easy drinking. In my opinion, this is nothing more than an average amber ale the is hardly memorable. It is however, one of those beers, that if enjoyed in the right setting and environment (i.e. college ski trip), can make for a few smiles and happy times."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable, and it does not dominate or kill any parts of the pallet, so it would be a great session beer or great in a style tasting."
"Avalanche pours deep amber with golden tones that leaves quickly dissipating foam. Smell is light of sweet malt with a hint of fruity notes and little hops. Taste is subdued with nice toasted grain, quite smooth and somewhat light with a slight hop tinge. Nice mouthfeel with a sticky sweet coat and is medium bodied. At right around 5% Alcohol By Volume, Avalanche makes a great session beer."
"I've had much worse but this just isn't my cup of tea."
"D-It's alright. I have certainly had worse. A little boring, but not at all offensive."
"Overall, it's kinda middle-of-the-road, in both the good sense (doesn't get old) and bad (nothing memorable about it either). If a bar'n'grill place had it on tap I'd get it, if only because despite the above it's still better than the macros, but this is more than likely my last standalone bottle. Maybe they have some others more distinguishable, but this ain't makin my rotation."
"Looks like a nice amber ale. Clear with a tan head. Unfortunately, not much is coming through the nose. A bit of the sweetness that crystal malt delivers, but not a whole lot more. Taste is quite pleasant. This would be a nice session beer. It's a classic amber ale -- flavorful without being assertive, and it's got a decent American hop backbone to support it. Mothfeel is good enough for the style, and drinkability is pretty darned good. Count me in for having a few of these on a cool fall day."
"Overall- What a dud. This 1 has barely an aroma or flavor. Avoid."
"M/D: Sharp feel on the tongue with a bit of alcohol feel and kinda rough as well. Not the most desirable beer in Breck's inventory but ok to drink."
"D - Certainly a decent session ale in many respects, but a little too sweet for me."
"But I am glad I had the opportunity to at least try it."
"D: Generally more flavorful than the average ale but everything else about this brew is pretty mainstream. Not incredibly smooth but still pretty easy to drink. Give it a try if your in the mood."
"I guess I'll give Breckenridge another try in the future since this bottle might not be indicative of what they are capable of."
"The Breckenridge brews have always flow under my radar for some reason, so I should get on the ball and fix that. A dark brown brew with big ruby streaks throughout is topped of by a light tan one-finger head which fades pretty quickly and leaves some inconsistent streaks of lacing behind. Smells of malts, some subtle sweetness and maybe some spice. Tastes of tea and a bit of hops. Pretty drinkable, and not bad tasting, but nothing to write home to mom about. This is a one night stand that is nothing to be ashamed of, but you probably won't be giving it a booty call anytime soon."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, honestly I was expecting a lot more from this beer than what I got, which was a very less-than ordinary beer."
"Pours a hazy amber color, as the name would imply, creating a very small head that settled into a thin cap and left little lacing. Smell is of sweet caramel malts. Taste is much the same. Sweet, bready malts, light caramel infusion and a hint of hops in the background. Good mouthfeel, decent carbonation. An average brew of this style."
"A notch or two above average, at the very least it was better than I was expecting. Poured a cloudy red colour similar to watered down tea with a single finger thick sand coloured head that stayed in place for all of 60 seconds. Smell was dominated by sweet malts with what I would pereive to be biscuit-y, if that makes sense. Flavor, too, was almost all malt with a bizarre sourness to it. Unsure if the sourness is *meant* to be here or not. It wasn't offensive or anything, but it certainly did not augment the taste in any way. Everything was pretty average with this one. Not a bad beer, but certainly forgettable."
"mouthfeel is light, malty, bitter, crisp - a nice choice for sessioning."
"Overall, a tasty beer at a very tasty price."
"D- I did not find anything I disliked about this beer per se, but there was nothing that I really liked about it either. A good drinking beer I suppose."
"Poured a thick frothy white head. Smells like a macro. Color is more pale than amber. Taste is not bad, not good. Not enough hops for my liking in an amber. Even though the hops are negligible, the malt taste is not dominant either. This is a slight step above a Macro."
"Light and easy to drink, but I won't buy again."
"Amber color with a thin white head. The nose is composed of mild malts and possibly some English hops. A nice mild ale flavor. Good malty base to it. The medium body is paired with some fizzy carbonation. A drinkable brew. Somewhere between a red, mild and brown ale. Good session beer."
"Not all that bad brew, perfect for pizza or just a session brew. Wish it had a little more oomph, but still solid and drinkable."
"this beer poured a golden amber with no head to speak of. the smell is a bit sour perhaps, perhaps not. i detect citrucy hops and a nice malty sweetness. the taste is very natural and clean, but much sweeter than i expected. the mouthfeel is pretty normal for this style beer and it is certainly good enough to drink every once in a while. i used to visit this brewpub when i lived in memphis, so it was good to have a beer from them again."
"Overall, a very solid amber. I really enjoy Breckenridge beers, and this is no exception."
"D - This is an okay amber. Not the best but certainly drinkable."
"D: Just a tad too cloying with the cookie-like aftertaste, but overall it's not a bad amber ale."
"Flavor is semi-sweet with toasty, bready malt and a slight hop bitterness that comes through as somewhat acidic. Medium body with sharp carbonation. This beer does not have much depth to it and it becomes pretty boring after a few tastes. Not impressed with this one."
"Drinkability- I'm not a huge amber fan, but this one, although a bit thin, has better balance than previous ambers I have tried."
"Verdict: Pretty weak stuff. It almost seems like a fake craft-brew, I keep looking for a hidden Anheuser-Busch logo somewhere. Bland, flat, and rather soulless, Breckenridge Avalanche is forgettable in every sense."
"D: Not bad... but not likely that I have another."
"Overall - Descent Beer that is definately worth a go round. Nothing extra special but good."
"Pours a orange-ish/ amber color with a small tan head. In the aroma, a sweeter malt, with caramel hints. In the taste, sweet maltiness, with roasty and caramel hints. A smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel and a semi dry, caramel like aftertaste. Nice roasty and caramel malt, easy to drink and non offensive, good and basic."
"M/D: this is a more basic example of this style i do however like it and find it to be a pretty easy drinking beer. good solid beer, nothing too fancy but still good"
"Drinkability is pretty low for me, that metallic aftertaste as was just too much, I could barely finish the first glass let alone the whole bomber..."
"Picked up from the newly installed singles shelf at Green's. The beer poured out hazy amber in color, and had a small, thin head. The smell was very mild, and predominantly that of sweet malts. The taste followed the smell as a mostly malty offering with a vague fruitiness and a floral hop presence. Somewhat watery and seltzer feel rounded out the experience. Instead of an avalanche, this was more like the snow sliding off the roof when you slammed the door too hard."
"D - This one's a little odd. Hop profile caught me off guard and the mouthfeel is pretty weak. Not too bad, but I wouldn't go out of the way to get more."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't ask for another of these."
"Would be a good session beer. Tasty enough to drink large quantities. Low enough abv to be sessionable. Not particularly memorable, as far as seeking it out."
"I could drink the hell out of this. I will likely buy a sixer of this one."
"D: Don't expect extreme or unique here, but it's good. A solid and very sessionable beer on a hot day, but there's many better examples out there. Worth a shot."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied, crisp, and refreshing. Carbonation is good. Drinkability is definitely above average. This would actually be pretty nice on a hot day. It's worth a try."
"Appearance was deep amber about two steps away from brown. Thin head quickly settled back into beer. Smelled toasty, vanallia, and caramel. No real hop aroma to speak of. Tasted very close to how it smelled with a hint of chocolate and bitterness in the aftertaste. Bitterness was just enought to balance it out. Body was light. Overall, pretty good. Because of its light body and no flavor profile being overbearing, this would make a good thirst quencher if you are looking for a little more beer then the wheats and blondes. So, obviously the drinkablility is good."
"Drinkability: I could drink quite a few of these it is pretty well balanced and easy to drink."
"D: Meh"
"This Amber has some body to it, almost heavy with a pretty good feel. Interestingly it could trick you into thinking you're having a draft. I could dirnk another but I wouldn't session it much past that."
"Smell is of malt, somewhat toasty and sweet. Flavor is nice, but nothing outstanding. Good clean finish, no aftertaste."
"D- obviously a brew made to session and appeal to a wide variety of drinkers including the macro crowd....and they pull if off very well, nothing offensive and a easy drinking, sessionable amber ale"
"Sláinte"
"Pretty good beer."
"The first thing I notice in the taste is, well, not very much. Just thin. Very (and I mean very) slight maltiness and what there even is of it, just add a metallic taste to what seems a watery concoction in the first place. A hint of sour apple comes through towards the end that is, I guess for the lack of a better word, a clean finish but that finish comes from the fact that the beer is boring to begin with. I'll be passing on this one in the future."
"All in all, OK, but not one I'll choose again."
"I wouldn't pay for another one, and I'd only drink a few if it were free."
"This dark ale pours a very nice dark golden brown with a decent tan head. Aroma is spicy and hoppy with some malt hints. Flavor is malty and spicy, with a little bit of a hop bite and plenty of malty smoothness. This is a delicious and very drinkable beer, perfect for a cold night."
"Drinkability: This is a drinkable in a sense owing to its low alcohol and rather muted flavor profile. However, nothing much of interest here. Tastes more like a British pale but not a very good one. . .maybe I just don't like American ambers."
"D-not much"
"D: If offered I would drink it without a qualm as it is a safe drink, but not memorable or one to mention in conversation"
"D - I didn't care for this one. It's not all bad, it's just boring and a bit funky. This seemed way off-balance."
"Given to me as a gift, I wouldn't normally purchase an amber of my own volition. This particular beer is average at best, but is closer to below average. The head is surprisingly dense and creamy. After the pour, however, it goes down hill. An ideal pizza beer because it would not overpower any aspect of the food's flavor, but it would not enhance it either. Nothing special here - recommendation to avoid."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is ok, but it's a little on the watery side. Pretty basic amber. Flavors and hop presence are both pretty mild. Certainly sessionable, but overall nothing really sets it apart."
"The fun stopped there for me though. While it's possible I may have gotten a bad batch, and there was a spot on the label to denote bottling date, it wasn't marked for whatever reason. The smell was subtle, the taste a bit bland. It's a nice thick ale, but it just doesn't hold up to more flavorful beers I've had in this style."
"Drinkability: You know, it kind of reminds me of just a less sweet Acme Pale Ale. There, I said. And you know what? It felt good. It's good to be honest."
"A nice, deep red amber in appearance, but after that, nothing seems to really stand out. The taste is fine -- nice maltiness, with a hint of sweetness is balanced well with hop bitterness, but no real memorable flavors to speak of. Put this in the I'll-never-turn-one-down-but-never-reach-for-willingly category."
"o -- kinda disapointed. good for food. I guess since ambers are more of a subdued style I cant knock it too bad, but I've had better."
"A nice, gentle interpretation of a nice, gentle style. Ambers aren't supposed to set the world on fire, and this one doesn't...but it is a smooth and drinkable beer with no off flavors (expect maybe a little too much tartness in the aftertaste). I could enjoy this beer any time, or enjoy the rest of my life without having one ever again."
"Very forgetable beer. Pours a clear gold color with very little head that fades fast and leavs no lacing. Smell is that of a beer nothing worth noting. Tastes is slightly malty and watery. I don't know if i can pick out a beer brewed with adjuncts but I would say this was one if asked. I suppose I am not a fan of this style but I found this beer to be one that I wouldn't ask for again. It tastes very similar to Shiner 98 but not as good (and shiner 98 wasn't that great either)."
"Tastes iron dryyish, but nice malty finish. Hops are present, but quite in line with the intensity of the malt. Woody dry with minimal pine and orange hop flavor. Light caramel is strung a bit thinner than I'd like for the style. fruity sweet in the aftertaste leaves everything nice. Md body and moderate carbonation."
"Very middle of the road beer."
"Avalanche Ale is an interesting beer in that it seems to fall halfway between an English pale ale and an American amber ale. The slightly sulphury, mineralish English yeast is just so blatant that I can't think of anything but English ale, and yet it does have a bit more crystal malt to it like an American version. It's got a just slightly hazy deep-amber/orange body and creamy antiqued-white head. The retention and lacing are good. The aroma is nice, particularly if you enjoy the yeast character, and there's a bit of subtly sweetish caramel malt and grassy and leafy hops present as well. The flavor is well-balanced with malt and yeast character stepping forward, and hops and bitterness following. There's a mild fruitiness to it like apricot, apples, and pears, but the yeast also leaves it almost a touch ""bloody"" or iron-like. I find it reminiscent of Bateman's XXX. It's interesting enough to keep your interest through more than one, and it might make a good session ale. Nicely done."
"Decidedly (and confusingly) macro-lager-like and hugely disappointing. Sometimes it pays off blindly grabbing a single bottle to try. Sometimes you wish you could get your money back. Avoid."
"12oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium amber with a 2 finger head, OK longevity and good lace. Lots of big malts aromas mixed with a bit of biscuit/bready smells. Again, lots of malt flavors followed by the same biscuity flavors leaving a decent hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The malts do tend to disappear a bit too quickly though. All in all a decent flagship beer for Breckenridge. Nothing special though."
"Another disappointing brew from Breckenridge, and probably the last one I try from them."
"Eric"
"It's light bodied, not all that complex. Very drinkable. Not revolutionary, but quaffable."
"This brew poured a clear amber liquid with a nice offwhite head that shrunk quickly leaving some lacing. Smell is sweet malt with a notes of floral hops. Taste is more of the sweet malts, with some grainy and floral hops. Mouthfeel is watery, but the hops that are there help it finish dry. A drinkable ale, nothing special."
"the bottle has numbers for the months and weeks bottled but is not notched as it should be. pours a copper/amber with a quickly diminishing off-white head. aroma is mostly of euro vegetal/earthy/floral hops with just a hint of toffee. taste is mostly dry/crisp/astringent. mouthfeel is relatively light. this reminds me of a domestic attempt at a marzen but without the malt sweetness. basically something rather tame that you could have several of, would be a good intro to craft beer for meatheads."
"This beer is drinkable but nothing special as far as amber ales go."
"Medium to light body, I thought there was a little too much carbonation although that problem disappeared as the beer warmed. Smooth and drinkable, but honestly the metal was too much for me."
"D - Easy to drink, but not a good representation of the style."
"The second time i tried this beer i got a pint and a half bottle that i split with a buddy in two pint glasses. I liked the amber color and the head stayed around for a while. The beer smelt sweet with a big dose of citrus. i enjoyed the distinct orange flavor and medium carbonation. This is easily one of my favorite all around beers."
"Drinkability: Great. This is a smooth everyday kind of beer and despite the metallic taste it is one of my go to beers on a hot summer day!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a medium amber, forming a 1/4 inch white head, that quickly faded, leaving light rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is sweet, with a hint of citrus. The flavor is heavy sweet malt, with a slight amount of hops towards the end. The finish is smooth and clean. A medium mouthfeel, being a little thicker than expected from this style. Overall, this is a very easy beer to consume. A great beer to have in between the heavier porters and stouts."
"Amber light? I couldn't see myself buying this again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit harsh. This beer is rather drinkable, but doesn't have a lot of very distinguishing qualities."
"D: This is a very very drinkable beer, it tastes good enough where you can just put them down like water."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink because of its lack of any significant flavor. I just can't get over the ""cheap"" smell."
"There really isn't much to this one. Nothing too bad, but it seems like there are some other ales like this one that have a little more to them."
"Pours a copper, amber color into glass, looks just as expected. Not much of a smell, maybe the smell of barley coming through because the taste is pretty dominant of a abrley malt. Leaves kind of an estra tangy bittersweet aftertaste which is the only thing I didn't really care about the beer. Otherwise the taste is maybe a little bland, not a whole lot of flavor there except for the aftertaste. Another reviewer said it reminded him of vomit aftertaste and I agree...not that it's a nasty naste, just the bitterness in the back of the throat - - very similiar. Worth a try but nothing special here. Enjoy"
"This amber ale pours a clear, light copper into my mug with a thin white head that quickly diminished to a spotty skim. The beer has a moderate-high sweet malty aroma, sweet like dark fruits and there are hints of spicyness. I cannot much in the way of hop aroma. No surprises in the taste. A rather sweet ale, caramel and maybe some toasted grains? The perceived hop bitterness is low to maybe moderate-low, a little more balance would have been appreciated. A slight metallic taste is also evident, mainly at warmer temperatures. A low hop flavor is also there. The mouthfeel is rather thin and has medium carbonation. For the sweetness of the beer it does finish with a surprising little bit of dryness, which was nice. The beer almost seems like a half-hearted attempt at an Oktoberfest type ale. Overall the beer was ok. There was nothing that really wowed me and nothing that really turned me off terribly. I wouldnt say no if someone bought me one, but wont go out of my way to find it."
"Nicely designed label. The smell is strong on barley. The taste is mild yet distinctive; it has a striking resemblance to vomit, not completely in a bad way, giving it a bittersweet tang. I suspect this flavor comes from the meld of sweet malt taste and the acidic taste of the inconspicuous hops. Middleweight Amber. I wouldnt go out of my way to get another."
"This is a good beer if you want to try something other than the macros, and I like it better than Fat Tire, but not as much as 90Schilling."
"well pours with little to no head smells sweet and malty taste very malty and kind of like some honey with some bitterness the mouth feel is the best thing this beer has going for it but other than that i wouldnt waste the money on it its nothing more than average"
"Very biscuity tasting malt, lightly fruity finished with light herbal hops. But it's the malt that you taste in the finish and aftertaste, Lightly sweet mouth. This is decent, I like the biscuity character but something doesn't mesh well here. Above average but little else."
"The beer pours dark and has a dense vigorous head. Very smooth and sweet tasting without much malt bitterness. Delicious. The smell is somewhat metallic , though thankfully it doesn't extend to the flavor in any way. It tastes almost like oranges. I'm surprise by how well this beer tastes as I've tried other breckenridge beers with little success. Very enjoyable beer. A definite get."
"Pours a medium amber topped by a rather solid cream colored head. Head showed decent retention and a bit of lacing. Aroma has a nice sweet malt note and a hint of hops. Flavor has a nice mellow caramel flavor backed by a hint of bitterness and a soft malt backbone. Finishes just a little dry. Mouthfeel is smooth and inviting and perfectly carbonated. Drinkability is good. This was a very enjoyable beer, and I will not hesitate to have this one again. It's a very solid session type beer that also pairs well with food."
"Colorado has these American Reds down. Very akin to New Belgium's Fat Tire, Avalanche has a smooth start with a sweet middle and a slighty bitter but crisp finish. In a blind taste, I wouldn't be able to differentiate the two. It goes down easy and balances my pulled pork sammich quite well."
"D: I thoroughly enjoyed this. It hint all the right notes for me, and although it wasn't outstanding, I would gladly return to it."
"Overall, a fairly disappointing amber that could use less sweetness and more malty bite or hops."
"Had a two-2 ounce glass of this draft as part of a 6 beer sampler at the brewery. Amber color with thin white head, and little lacing. Finish was somewhat metallic. Not the best of the lot, and in fact, probably the one I enjoyed the least of the six."
"You could drink this one any place, any time and it will not get in the way. I guess there is a place for beers like this, but Ill stick with something cheaper."
"A light orange color with some darker tones, and a small white head forms, that quickly dissolves. A mild malty scent, with a bit citrusy hop aroma. A very, very, very mild malt flavor, the hops are not evident in the taste. In the mouth it is medium bodied, very smooth going down, a bit of tingle from the carbonation. A good session beer, the mild flavor makes easy to want more, but nothing to totally be excited about."
"Fairly robust copper orange with a fairly short-lived head that fades to a thin fizziness. Imbibing reminded reminded me of opening an old cellar, though not necessarily ni a bad way. It had an aged resiny and nutty taste that released a mind of pungent and tart vapor that really settled onto the back & sides of my tongue. That was kind of the highlight, but the taste did not blow me out of the water, overall. There was also a slightly sticky, lingering aftertaste I could have done without."
"Drinks okay, flavors just don't pull together like the summer ale does, would do in a pinch. Slighlty better than the last one I tried"
"This is an OK Amber. An easy drinking session beer."
"Overall another in a long line of bland American Ambers."
"Taste is a bit thin and watery for an amber ale, but drinkable and should work after mowing the lawn on a hot day or to wash down some barbecue."
"Certainly an easy drinker, but if you want any flavor this is not the beer for you."
"I will never drink this again. It tastes pretty watery and leaves no remnance of any beer-even lager."
"D - high, rather good and well balanced a great mealtime beer"
"Amber. From the smell, I can already tell that this is going to be a dreadful experience. Exclusive malt tones of toffee, caramel, pale and caramel malts. Not much hop presense in the aroma and into the flavor. Tastes of sweet malts and the atributes of pale and caramel malts. Fairly simple and one dimensional, but this is drinkable."
"Drinkability: drank a lot of these at the ESPN club downtown Denver. So, must be good."
"Crystal clear burnt orange. Smell is a bit metallic, light caramel malts..the aroma isn't all that special. Tastes consist of a fairly messy malt profile and no bitterness that has any real character..""toffee-ish"" off-flavors are more than abundant. Medium-bodied, and somewhat slick going down. Certainly not something I'd waste my money buying again."
"This beer is better than most of the stuff in a can but not a good representative of the brewery. If I am the mood for an amber, I will reach for a few other six packs before choosing this one again."
"This is my first beer from the Breckenridge brewery. This is not the best example of this style. Worth a try but dont go out of your way to get it."
"It was okay. Light brown in appearence. Basic smells of grains. The taste was (by my own opinion) a little watered down. Decent drinkability as witnessed by the 4-5 I drank during my vacation. I was really trying to give the beer a chance. I'm not sure if my review has anything to do with the 3.2 alcohol content, but it could have affected my judgement."
"On the whole this is a beer that I would qualify as mediocre at best. Better than a macro for sure. But there are many, many similarly priced ambers from this country and others that are more impressive."
"Low body, could use some more, not a great beer by any means, but a pretty straightforward amber. My only real problem is the plasticness in the initial quaff."
"This is an OK ale that is nothing more than that. Just a competent average ale here, try it if you see it but don't travel for it."
"This brew is deep red in color with a small white head. The lacing the sparce to begin with, and fades into nothing quite fast. The aroma is a faint sweetness, and nothing else. The taste is mildy sweet, and clean. I actually thought this was a lager while I was drinking it. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with way too much carbonation. The taste might have been better and more pronounced if the carbonation wasn't so irritating. Overall, this beer was easy to drink, but not very enjoyable. I do not think I will try this beer again for a good long while."
"Opinion: This is my first beer of the evening, so I figured that this one would go over better than this. I am pretty disappointed, obviously. This beer is just too light, and the only flavors that I get with any significance are bordering on flaws. I have their pale ale in the fridge also, so I hope it makes a better showing than this one."
"After tearing into a Breckenridge Breweing Company's variety pack this weekend, I beleive this beer to be the best of the selection. Though no standout characteristics, it is well brewed, clean, and easily palatable. Aromas have a medium malt profile with bready, toasty, yeasty, malty, and caramel. Looks...amber with adequate retention and lacing. Flavors are medium malty, with hop bittering to balance. Mild spices and hop flavor for accents. Finishes clean and cool. Quite a nice beer. It will be easily forgotten however, because many preceive this to be a lackluster beer style. Too bad, it's a good beer."
"Not a bad Amber Ale. Pours out to a slightly hazy red / auburn color with a short lived head that quickly turns into a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. Medium level of carbonation. Some notes of lacing. Aromas were light; some sweet malt, herbs and spices. Taste was quaffable; flavors of malt, sourness, minor hops and some cooked veggies and herbs. Mouthfeel was decent and appropriate for the style. Medium bodied with a slight touch of viscosity. Overall drinkability is decent. Could be a good session beer. Worth a try."
"Poured a crisp copper with lively carbonation. Some orchard fruit in the aroma and carried up front in the flavor. A touch of grain husk punches through toward the end, but withdraws and the light fruityness picks up again for the finish. Moderate hops bittering is constant but plays second-fiddle. Pleasant but unremarkable."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper color with a finger of head that falls to a patchy coating over top. Small tendrils of lace cling to the glass. Nose is very grainy, almost spicey from the grain. That is really all I get from the nose. Flavor is more subdued on the grain than the nose, but it is still the dominant flavor. There is a touch of caramel sweetness that takes the edge off the graineyness. Flavors don't hang on into the finish much at all other than the nice toasted grain. Rather tasty beer. Feel is very solid moderate with a light carbonation. This is a pretty enjoyable beer. As with many, nothing makes it stand out, but there are no overriding flaws that would keep me away from it. This one would is nice for watching some NCAA football on an early fall evening. Could easily session it all day."
"Fragrant smooth and tasty, Breckenridge Avalanche Ale will find its way back into my beer glass real soon."
"this is a really good beer. Not a lot of hit you in the face flavors, but enough interesting going on to make me want more. I recommend it."
"A medium bodied brew, a basic quaffer for any season  but in the end just not to exciting or one I would seek out."
" If this beer had more backbone to its body it would only make it that much better. Alittle richness wouldnot hurt thisone."
"Mouthfeel could be fuller. Drinkable but rather boring."
"Avalanche is amber-orange in color with a average-sized, off white head. The aroma consists of medicore amber malt aroma with just a touch of hops thrown into the mix as well. The taste has a decent malt profile, not quite rich enough and a little grainy. Citrussy hops make an appearance mid-way through a sip and give this beer some needed character. My overall impression is that this beer is just tasty enough to be good, but still seems a little raw around the edges. At $4.99 a sixer this is a good find."
"Overall impression: Not the most exciting beer - kind of a generic amber. Watered down Fat Tire comes to mind. Not bad, but there are many many other beers from Colorado I would prefer."
"Aroma consists of faint herbs and spices. Mouthfeel is mid-range as far as carbonation. Initial taste is a mild maltiness, barely present hops, and a vegetable taste redolent of green beans. There is a hint of citrus, but it is subsumed by a bland, unpleasant taste, and, combined with its lack of flavor makes this beer a pass."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick creamy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light pale and crystal malt scent along with some mild hopping. The taste is good also. It has a light, yet sweet malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It goes down easy and finishes slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good amber ale. It has good flavor and aroma; a fine sessions ale."
"I had hopes for this beer, but I just couldn't get past the Granny Smith Apple."
"Vastly unimpressive."
"Pours out a sexy amber color with a white heaadskie on top. Nice smooth body makes for good drinkability factor. Nice balance, tastes good, but not great. An above average amber ale worth checking out me thiNks because anyone could easily put down these one after another."
"Overall, I wouldn't buy this beer again, not with many other similar, better brews available for nearly the same price. This one's just too weak and blah."
"Light to medium bodied."
"Breckenridge's least interesting beer."
"Average carbonation level for this style with a light to medium body. A good session beer for enjoying football on the tube."
"A nice looking reddish amber brew that has a white head that didn't stay very long and it leaves no lace on my glass. There is a nice hop aroma and a fruity ester in there too. The taste is very clean and follows up with a sweet malty nirvana before the hops hit your tongue. Definitely a easy drinking ale. I will be revisiting this beer in the near future."
"Medium to darker amber appearance, clear and attractive with a middling head of 1/8 of an inch after a half a minute. Simple vertical string laces. Aroma has a touch of spiciness, approaches cardammon in some aspects. The mouthfeel is lighter, the carbonation is about average. Flavors start out simple, brown sugar maltiness, fairly straightforward, but with a little orangey tang that magnifies to a decent hoppiness and balance toward the back of the profile. Seems to sweeten on further sips, and takes on a vegetal funkiness. A little ordinary, and the carbonation flattens quickly"
"got another bargin from trader joes.poured amber with light tan head. aroma sweet , malts, caramel,with a hint of sourness. flavor sweet, caramel, watery. I am glad I did not spend more than a $1.25 on this one it is not going to be one of my favorites."
"This is quite an awesome brew, especially for being 3.2% ABW. This has a ton of flavor, and between the rich biscuit, toast and malt body, always brings a smile to my face. It's true to style and surpasses many of the better ambers out there. Very easy to drink stuff, and it's only $5.99/6'er here in Estes Park and Loveland. Recommended. This could easily become an everyday beer for me."
"Taste jibes completely with the nose, showing big malted grain character, roasted and toasted and very dry. Bitter hops.. Mild carbonation and smooth, medium body. A great, unique amber ale that I found highly drinkable."
"I bought this as a single that was being sold because of the rest of it's six-pack mates had been killed in a dropping accident. Very light carmel color, tiny white head. Moderate lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is some burnt carmel malts. Faint bitter hops, with a big grassy malt backing. Somewhat of a forgettable beer."
"I took a sip. It tasted like mixed vegetables, peas and corn. It had an okay body, I guess, but it really, seriously tasted like sweet peas. And that's just weird."
"Overall, a decent enough beer, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Pours a deep amber hue with a light foamy head. Roasted malt aroma, not much else. Very foamy body contains a palate of roaste malt, light toffee, and a faint amount of hops that builds on the finish. Overall flavor is nice, but the body is way too carbonated. Of course, I had this in a crappy airport bar, so maybe it's usually better."
"Avalanche Ale isn't a bad beer by any means, but I won't be buying it again."
"The head is small, off-white and dense but fizzy. Clear, clear darkish orange/amber liquid. A touch rosy, if I'm sane. Sweet, fruity, nutty aroma is just a little bit sour. Tangy, nutty front. The middle gets sweetish, fruity. It's a little thinnish and there's a strange, tangy, sour touch. Almost like a rye or buckwheat. The finish is dry and a touch fruity (apples?). Nice roasted grains. This is ok, but it doesn't blow me away."
"($1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"Pours a clear amber of course. The head is somewhat worth mentioning. Hmmmm....overall bland beer here. I can't get much of an aroma at all, just a bit of buttery malts. The mouthfeel is enjoyable crisp with bland malty notes comprising the flavor. There isn't much hop presence to speak of. I'm a bit disappointed. They should use the name Avalanche for a more ""throaty"" beer instead of this Hyundai beer."
"The beer pours a clear ruby amber with a white head that is compact, but lingering. The aroma is pure buttered popcorn. Super strong diacetyl aroma. Slight caramel behind that, no hop aroma. The flavor is diacetyl as well. Slick butter feel on the tongue and the finish is dry butter. There is no real caramel flavor and only enough hops to balance the butter. I could not choke down much of this."
"A tinge of red on a smart amber body, the head is white and creamy, but short-lived. A little lace from the slight residual. Nice malty nose with a hint of fruit. The taste is sweetly malty with a bit of hop bittering. Thin and light body seems out of place with the appearance. Decent drinkability."
"The nose kind of tricks you. ""Hey mister, drink me, I'm all malty sweet, hehe."" And it is; for like a microsecond until the puckering hop flavor implodes your mouth. Yet, it did hint some leafy aromas back there, in the nose. hmmm? As I drain, it morphs. Dry caramel flavored pop corn, quenching hop bitter. Odd, enigmatic and amber.."
"thanks to Bruiser81 for providing!"
"This is one of the first beers that got me into the real beer game, not having it since then, i think i can appreciate it more now. Not bad at all."
"The beer as it sets in the glass a limpid deep amber to burnished copper color, the head is impressive in size, frothy in texture and the color light beige, as the head disappears an adequate sheet of lace is formed. Nose is sweet malt, fresh and clean, a decent nose, the start is malt sweet, top is skinny in feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hops sparing in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a lightweight beer and those who like the style should be pleased."
"Wasn't too excited about this beer. Pours a amber-tinged golden with a small white head. Basic. Smell was biscuit-y malts, and not much else going on. Lightly sweet malts up front, with a not too bitter finish. Nice balance, but I get the impression that this brewer was ""playing it safe"" with this one. Mouthfeel was a little thin."
"Medium amber color, with a medium foamy beige head. Aroma is malty and sweet. A mild and malty ale. It has a lighter body and a nice smooth malt flavor. Not very hoppy. Good balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Color is a deep amber with golden tones, with a small head that faded fast. Smell is light of sweet malt with a hint o fruity notes. Taste is good, quite smooth and somewhat light, has a good malty sweetness with a hop tingle slightly present. Feel is good, has a kind of sticky, sweet, coating, like a lollipop, and is smooth and closely medium bodied. I really liked this beer. It really hit the spot and fit perfect with the grilled dinner I was having."
"The sticky sweetness, the way it clung to my mouth and lingered, and the aroma of this brew all reminded me of melon, like cantalope or honeydew. Not exactly characteristics that I enjoy in a beer. While it made for an interesting aroma, it didn't transfer well to the palate."
"Color was hazy amber; foam was n/a. Predominate malt smell for what aroma was present (subtle). Taste was on the light side with an even, slightly malty feel (as the bottle suggests). Gave this one average marks, with the caveat that this is against other craft beers."
"Pours a medium amber color with a creamy white head. Mild aroma of floral hops. Taste is dominated by a sweet maltiness that is not overpowering and also has notes of honey and caramel. Its quite crisp and refreshing. It would be nice after a long day on the slopes."
"Coppery hue, the head never developed, also there was no subsequent lacing. The nose was slightly toasty malts, hints of sweetness, hoppiness, and apple notes. The palate is tasty but a little thin. The first drop that hit my tongue, I swear, was water but it definitely went up from there. Very tasty, sweet maltiness and caramel undertones but balanced by some bitter hops. This was a good Amber Ale; Id drink it again."
"Copper color, with a big fizzy light tan head. Lots of bubbles settled quickly. Left some nice lacing down the glass. Faint hop aromas drowned out by a rich creamy malt sweetnees. Carmel sweet taste dominated the flavors, nice dry finish. Only downside was a bit of a watery feel. Still very good, nice beer before and with dinner. I liked it."
"I fell in love with this brew the first time I had it at the Breckenridge brewpub in Denver. When I finally found it back here in Dallas I was ecstatic. The deep amber color is very pleasing to the eye. You can defenietly smell the caramel flavors right away. The rich malts and the perfect body to it make it taste wonderful. It feels very smooth in the mouth and flows down the throat the same way, which makes it very, very drinkable. In my opinion, this is one of the best beers of this style."
"A beer that poured out a copper amber color and formed a nice white head that subsided quickly and left little lace.  A small amount of carbonation.  A slight aroma of hops and malt with a touch of citrus.  The flavor was of hops, caramel, malt.  The finish was a bit sweet and tangy.  Not a bad beer fo the summer, but there are better ones out there."
"Copper colored with a thick off-white head that quickly fades to a paper-thin layer, modest lace, slight carbonation.  Aroma of toasted malts and some slight hops.  Taste begins with malty sweetness and a slight sting of carbonation.  Alcohol notes then assert themselves, followed by citrus hops.  Mouthfeel is relatively smooth.  An unexeceptional but decent amber ale."
"Surprisingly little aroma or taste, but an all-around refreshing beer, especially ice-cold. Would definitely not be my first pick of the Breckenridge line, but miles better than that oatmeal stuff they make."
"Very nice dark copper appearance, nice foamy white head.  Not much on the aroma, but whats there is rather malty almost no hops smell.  Sweet malty taste but not overly so.  Very drinkable beer................CHEERS"
"Light amber in color, pours a relatively thin head. Perfumy bouquet with an above average malty body.  An aroma of  malts and citrusy hops. Especially nice to sip when watching the NHL hockey Detroit red wings smoke the defending stanley cup champs colorado avalanche."
"Light copper in hue w/ a thick, white head.  Almost lager - like in clarity.  Sweet crystal malt with slight ( but pleasant) butterscotch and biscuit malt notes comprise the aroma. A mild, perhaps Kent Goldings hop nose is present as well.  The body is moderate for an amber, and the fairly low carbonation allows for a smooth mouthfeel.  A unique, and almost sharp honey - like sweetness is almost balanced by the hop bitterness, but sweet malt flavors are certainly in the forefront.  The malt character and overall flavor is very clean, (yet not at all bland) making for a drinkable brew.  Pretty tasty. There are better ambers out there, but there are also way more insipid ones as well."
"Pours a thick frothy white head.  Smells like a macro.  Color is more pale than amber.  Taste is not bad, not good.  Not enough hops for my liking in an amber.  Even though the hops are negligible, the malt taste is not dominant either.  This is a slight step above a Macro."
"Pours out to a nice amber color with very little head. Very lightly carbinated with a slightly sweet malt taste. Very light on hops. Very drinkable, but not very recognizable."
"I had never tried Breckenridge prior to stumbling upon a 12-pack sampler...This is the first one I tried. Their web-site lists this as an amber...tastes a lot like a ""vienna"" style beer. .A little too thin to be considered an ""Octoberfest"" but similar in style to Dos Equis amber but much much more flavorfull...I'm curious to try the rest of their products which I will do over the next week or two.."
