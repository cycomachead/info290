3.83,1.1,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"I liked this. Poured it from a bottle in my  glass at home. A nice rich copper clear look with a off white nice head. Carbonation is low which is fine. A slight bread malt smell that stays with the taste with a hint of citrus for a subtle nice combination mouth feel. The foam head holds up well and provides nice lacing. Bought it with a mix and match six pack and will buy again.","chuckpalka","Yesterday at 05:19 AM"

3.76,-0.8,4.25,3.25,4,3.75,3.75,"Pours a clear deep amber/pale brown with a reddish hue producing 2 fingers of somewhat lasting, pale tan, foamy/frothy head that leaves a clumpy coating of streaky, webby lacing. Aroma is disappointing & promises little: thin toffee, caramel & earthy herbal hops. Taste is another kettle of fish altogether (no pun intended). The mouth is an intense version of the nose on steroids with dark bread, roast and nutty notes, more intense earthy hops & yeasty/malty fruity esters. The sip finishes with caramel, roast & nuts, fruit, some pepper & an increasing hop bitterness. Afrertaste is a dry, astringent & bitter bomb that is out of character for the style but most welcome to card carrying Hop-Heads such as myself. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, dry, creamy, silky with slight spice & a pleasant astringency. I don\'t remember an amber ale with this much bitterness.","mothmanscott","Mar 29, 2015"

Fans of sweeter, more malty amber ales might not care for this. I find it very drinkable, but wish I knew how old it really is. Just stamp the actual bottling date on the bottle, fer cryyi!

It is adequately carbonated and has good clarity though. Aroma is fresh, with sugary citrus fruit, molasses and biscuity notes. The flavor is very malt forward, which suits the style, however it may be a just a tiny bit too sweet for my tastebuds. It is somewhat bold and has moderately heavy body to it. The mouth feel is very full and the finish has some desirable bitterness to it, and it lingers nicely. While I don't normally reach for amber ales on the store shelf, all things considered, this is an excellent beer.","Neorebel","May 01, 2014"

Fruity yeast esters, creamy, somewhat biscuity malts, tea-like hops, pear, and a long bitterness that seems a bit out of place. Nice mouthfeel...medium bodied with some texture. Decent all around, though I was expecting more of an obvious San Diego style hop influence and this seems to be more on the British side of things.","wedge","Nov 11, 2013"

Strong flavor of caramel, fresh bread, buttered toast, cereal; lime and huge grapefruit flavors coming from the hops. Mouthfeel is medium thin with a very appropriate carbonation bite.

Aromas of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, floral, orange zest, grass, and herbal. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, toast, biscuit, orange zest, floral, toffee, light nuttiness, and light herbal spiciness. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, toffee, orange zest, floral, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance of hop/malt flavors that feel fairly robust; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice amber ale.

Most of this review will be in comparison to the on-tap version. The beer has a darker red coloring, with a foamier and lighter colored, big bubbled head. Slight sweet malt on the nose, but barely detectable. The body is rounder, and much creamier, and the hops flavors come across a bit muted.

On the nose, I couldn't get much other than yeast and malts, maybe a little orange peel? The only outstanding quality taste-wise is the hoppy/metallic finish, which plays well with the bubbly, sharp texture.

Flavor has some sweet cereal grains with herbal/citru/pine hop combo, mild approachable hop bitterness not to brash and off putting but great flavor and balance within this beer's profile.

Deep amber to coppery orange-red, mild haze but still easy to see through it, metallic cast, just about exactly as you'd expect the liquid to look. Malty nose with ample milk chocolate, malted milk balls, caramel and fresh butter accents, this not to ignore the also powerful pine and pin to white grapefruit citrus, no lack of spine here, not quite floral but good amount of peach, nectarine, apricot fruit scents, ends with a bitter grass and wet kindling wood embers. Medium-bodied, hoppier here with the emphasis on the pine, fresh grass, white grapefruit and blood orange flavors, biscuits, the floral notes succeed better towards the end. Leaves your mouth dry with a tacky residue before half the glass is empty, the caramel, toffee, cocoa powder breaks a sweat to keep what little ground it gains, wish there were a little more sweetness for balance. Instead, you get heavy carbonation in an attempt to provide relief for the tongue. Less out to impress, more solid delivery would seal the deal.","farrago","Jul 28, 2010"

It has a bitter hop bite up front along with a ton of breadiness and some caramel malt sweetness in the finish. It's bone dry and overly bready for my tastes. The mouthfeel is fine.

Tastes were similar to aromas and very complex - biscuity, bready malt, brown sugar, and caramel notes with a slight hop bite on the bitter-sweet finish consisting of citrus notes and mild pine.

Solid caramel malt body to add a backdrop to the hops. The flavors aren't crazy but are nice, perhaps a poor mans nugget nectar. The feel is light to moderate, semi-soft carbonation.

The smell is light on the hops, moderate on the malts. A tiny whiff of tropical fruits and oranges comes up, followed by a powdery sweetness. No real whiff of breadiness. The taste, for the average american amber ale, is right on the money. A nice pleasant fruity hop presence comes by, tart cherries, orange, just a bit of leafiness, like tea in the background. Then there's a sweet tea finish, with a tiny bit of a biscuity malt presence. Something feels kind of syrupy in this. Maybe the low carbonation did it, but the mouthfeel is very nice, more full than I expected. And this one is overall very nice. Not the most enjoyable of all, but a bit better than average. I probably wouldn't enthusiastically buy this, but I'd say it was worth the visit.","taylorhamrick","May 17, 2009"

3.57,-5.8,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a beautiful amber/copper with about a half inch of white rocky head. Head recedes pretty quickly leaving thin wispy lacing. Nose is outstanding! The caramel malts are well done in the aroma, with a touch of bready malts that are faint. If only the taste picked up where the nose left off. Perhaps I got a bad batch, but the taste was muted, the bready malts dominated and weren't well balanced between the caramel and hops that are present. It seemed unequal and offbalance. This is a light to medium bodied beer, medium carbonation, slight grainy texture in the mouth with a sticky finish. The offbalance in the taste lessens the drinkability on this beer, but I will look to try it once more in hopes of simply getting a bad batch this time around.","Jayli","Apr 23, 2009"

There's a spice in here that I can't quite put my finger on, but it gives the beer a dill pickle type taste to it. Almost seems like it's coming from the hops, but something tells me it doesn't. Maybe this is an old batch? Either way, it sounds gross, but it's good, and it works with the piney hops extremely well. Really satisfying, incredibly drinkable.

The flavor profile starts out with the sweetness of the caramel malt upfront with a citrus bitterness of grapefruit rind that balances out the sweetness quite well.

There's a good amount of hop flavor in this beer, from the smell I was guessing I'd get a malt bomb. Piney flavors are dominant with a little bit of caramel and dough for balance.

With a resiny, tree natural scent coming off of a clean white head of decent size, this beer's aromatic qualities set the stage for an enjoyable tasting. It's color is a deep red like dark cherries maybe. It settled nicely in the glass and when tasted the hop flavor and a certain crispness seemed to dominate. Easy to drink and not heavy, I wouldn't say that it's mouthfeel seemed weak or thin, but that there was something missing in the final swallow that may be just my imagination.

3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into pint glass. Started with a nice head that faded pretty quickly. The color of the beer is light brown with an orange tinge. The smell is floral with a hint of malt. The taste is malty with the hops complimenting nicely and adding a sensation of additional sweetness before fading into a lingering bitterness.

I could smell this beer from across the room once I poured it into my glass. The great scent of sweet malt and a touch of earthiness was very nice. The taste was excelent as well.

It pours a very eye-pleasing copper with an off-white head that diminishes rather quickly but leaves some lace. The smell is interesting and hard to pinpoint exactly. It has slight peat notes reminiscent of a Scotch Ale but a good amount of hops. The taste, although again hard to categorize, is exceptionally nice. Flavors of biscuit, malt sweetness, and hops blend together almost perfectly. Another winner from Ballast Point.","mickeymac","Aug 31, 2003"

Nose is lightly floral but mostly malt sealed with sweet hints of butterscotch, quite pleasant. Begins malt sweet with the top middling in its feel, finish is stingingly acidic which tries to defend the palate against the onslaught of the hop monster that lies in ambush at the very dry end.

A pronounced aroma of caramel and biscuit malt greets the nose, followed shortly by some soft piney hops. Quite welcoming! Upon tasting, an exceptionally nice creaminess fills the mouth due to the combination of a medium body and moderate carbonation that's made up of very fine bubbles. The flavor displays an excellent balance between full, sweet, toasty/biscuity caramel malt upfront, grassy/spicy/lightly citrusy hops towards the swallow, and a bitterness that doesn't interefere with the maltiness but dries out the finish. A pleasure that offers a great deal of malt character, some complexity, and a very good drinkability. This is the first beer that I've tried from Ballast Point but it will certainly not be the last!
