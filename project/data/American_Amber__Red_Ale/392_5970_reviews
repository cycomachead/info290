"Overall:  This is a very good American version of an Oktoberfest beer.  Great balance between malt, sweetness and subtle hops.  I’ll definitely pick up a few bottles next year."
""
""
"Overall- a very pleasant brew. I would definitely drink this again."

"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Dark golden in hue, sparse head & very little lacing. Aroma is very light but a hint of the malty goodness is there. Nice body & well balanced sweetness. At 5.4% this registers as a very friendly beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  A decent marzen/oktoberfest.   A bit sweeter than most and it has all the other standard characteristics."

"O: A solid twist on an o-fest. Definitely has that malty and grainy feel to it like an o-fest, but still a little different. Most definitely a nice fall brew"

"DATE TASTED: September 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint...OCCASION: football watching with friends Mary and Rich... APPEARANCE: reasonably copper-amber body; strangely quiet in the way of bubbles; head mellows to a thin off-white head... AROMA: fragrant floral hops abound; nicely rounded caramel settles and balances the aroma--alluring... PALATE: crunchy and medium-bodied, with  slick finish that lingers confidently; possesses the effervescence of cola.....TASTE: mellow, sweet caramel with a pitchy, sharp funk that provides a distinct profile... OVERALL: what makes this an autumnal brew? a darker body? a smoky scent? a heartier flavor? This beer really doesn't have those attributes, but it does work well enough to compliment apps and football watching...."

"Striking copper. Earthy and bready nose.  Malty and bready but thinner than I expected.  There is dry bitterness on the finish."

"O: a nice beer that tastes remarkably of the season, but is short on personality... quite the neutral American malt profile as it lacks the depth brought on by Old World ingredients and techniques (decoction?)"
"O: flavor just didn't make me want more;"

"Basically this is a typical nut brown ale. Decently malty and nice flavor but nothing crazy amazing. A nice, good, drinkable beer that is buried in a category full of average beers. Give me a Double Simcoe over this any day!"
""
"The taste also has a firm maltiness up front and it ends with a low and clean crisp hop finale. It was an above average beer."
"O - An ok Autumn beer, decent aroma, lacks in feel though."

"Great beer, poured into a flat bottomed pilsner glass. Made a 3/4"" substantially frothy cream colored head with plenty of lace that coats the glass for the entire serving. Appearance is a cloudy reddish amber. It tasted sweet yet a little dry with the fruit at the front and the malt after. Bought a case to share for Thanksgiving but probably won't have any left for company in 5 days"

"Overall, an easy drinking hybrid style ale, lager type malts with ale yeast. Cleaner malt flavors and light hop flavor are pleasant."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: As I said before, this is forgettable. I've been very happy drinking Great Lakes' Octoberfest and Thirsty Dog's Barktoberfest this year. Weyerbacher is a good company, but this one frankly disappoints."
""
""
"Overall – A rather easy drinking harvest/fall style brew. It starts sweeter and end with a just enough hop and spice to add a bit of complexity."
""
"O- Great beer to drink hanging with friends watching football."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A simple, easy to drink amber ale. Not my favorite rendition of an amber, malt-forward beer."
""
""
"Aside from the harshness in the aftertaste this was a fairly desent beer. Very session like."
""
""
""
"This is a fun everyday beer. Nothing unique that makes it stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The flavor has mostly caramel malt with toast and light diacetyl buttery tinge with a slight earthy taste. The flavor of alcohol is present but not obtrusive. Overall I liked this okay but there are much better examples of the style and would probably not buy it again."

"if you hand me one... i'll drink it... if you have one in your fridge, I won't judge you... I'm a self-proclaimed locavore... from Philadelphia... so I know Easton has a whole lote more to offer... c'mon Easton.. .step it up... Crayola, Pez... Beer..."

"Notes: Nice head, creamy antique white with a bit of tan. Slight haze. Deep amber-orange w/ golden & orange highlights. Aroma: malty, caramelish, lightly fruity. Fresh. Grape? Apple. Noble hop?... floral, grassy. Mouth: creamy as it warms, fluffy. Medium. Moderate carbonation. Very smooth. Nice. Flavor: Caramel malt. Hint of sugar/honey. Light fruitiness. Nutty, then grassy/spicy, floral at finish = good flavor transitions throughout. Balanced bitterness just pokes above to lend a slight edge. Delightful. Head retention average to less. Minor lacing, some small spots. Kind of hints at a German beer but remains straightforward (American, not English... clean yeast, malt, balance, body). Some malt does linger on the palate halfway through. Not bad, the hops keep it from becoming sweet or cloying. Nicely done. Improved. Better balance, better focus, better technique. (Look for more Weyerbacher)."

"This beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with a rapidly disappearing head and no lacing. The aroma is of leaves and nuts with a hint of earth and caramel. The flavor is mild caramel with earth notes and an odd tang in the finish. It's mouthfeel is light-medium. Weyerbacher Autumn Fest is an average beer, a bit odd, but not bad. Recommended."
""
"Drank this with the impression that it was an Oktoberfest..fit the bill as much as it does a Red Ale"
""
"A really decent Amber ale with a nice balance of flavors. Would drink another."
"This is a pretty simplistic, malty beer. The hops are there. They’re balanced and bitter, but the malts dominate. The grainy notes are a bit overwhelming at times. On the whole, this beer is underwhelming and ultimately forgettable."
"Autumnfest is nothing special, which is probably why I usually skip it every year. The new label's neat. It's okay, but if this is one of your favorite Weyerbacher beers, you've got problems."
""
"Pick this one up if you want sessionable autumn beer, but want something other than a pumpkin ale or a true Oktoberfest."
""
""
"O: Overall this is a pretty enjoyable amber. While not quite an oktoberfest it is listed as a red / amber ale , and at that - it has succeeded. Overall well done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall and decent seasonal. Pretty good for a nice fall day."
""
"Pours a clear amber with little head retention or lacing. Caramel malt aromas, followed by some spice and hints of citrus. Light in body, and emphatically carbonated. While the carbonation and light body are nice, the flavor profile fell a little flat. There was not much there beyond a slight maltiness. Clean finish."
""
""

"This brew pours a clear reddish color with visible carbonation. The head on the brew pours a white color but dissipates very quickly with no lacing. On the nose, I get some spices like nutmeg and cinnamon and some malts. There is also some caramel and brown sugar going on with the nose. On the taste, the caramel notes come out first, then the spices come out after well. The carbonation dances on the tongue and is quite active and nice. I would call this a “spiced amber” style. It has a bit more complexity than the normal amber. I could see why they call this a good transition beer. It’s lighter than a typical Autumn beer which is nice. The spice is subtle and not overwhelming. The finish is pretty quick with a little bit of caramel malt."
"Orangish-red with yellow hues on the edge of the glass and hazy. Poured with a short off -white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Sweet toasted malt aromas with hints of earthy grass and lemon hops. Pleasant, smooth, delicate lager feel with crisp refreshing carbonation. Toasted and caramel malt flavors up front ans through the middle with earthy, grassy undertones. Light lemon citrus hop bitterness toward the end ushers in a crisp, dry finish."
"Overall this is a very solid fall brew; thick and rich for those cool fall nights along with a slight alchohol warming effect. The thick, bready malts fill one up and the fall fruits such as apples and pears along with a touch of cinammon add a nice touch."
""
""
"Overall a great fall beer and another great beer from Weyerbacher. If you rated to low I would reconsider a revisit (new label) since it's fantastic drink ability."

"It may be ironic that I am drinking this in early June, but a good beer is good any time of year. Mild malty aroma has hints of cloves and cinnamon. It pours a clear, dark coppery amber with a light tan head that doesn’t stick around very long. Malty flavor has subtle notes of cloves and cinnamon and a woody hint. Texture is smooth, with average body and average fizz. Maybe it’s been languishing on the shelf a while, but I’m confident this is better when fresh. Might be worth a revisit."

"M-smooth and clean. I would def buy again but more as a nice seasonal beer to session with friends."
""

"O-For a malty fall beer it isn't half bad. Pales in comparison to their other fall seasonal (Pumpkin Ale)."

"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark orange/amber with a thin white head. Fizzles out quickly. The nose is really sweet with lots of caramel, toffee, syrup, bread. Slightly slick mouth with subtle carbonation on the finish. Very mild hop flavoring. This beer is mainly sweet. Caramel, toffee, some faint fruitiness like apples. This was a decent drink, but nothing I'd stress too hard to get."

""

"O- it'd be a solid A- or B+, but that funky metallic flavor really gets me."

"Even though I only had one of these, this offering could easily have been part of a larger drinking session, had I had the time. This style isn't what I would expect for an Autumn seasonal, but this fit the bill nicely and wasn't weak like some of the Marzens that I've had. Most Ambers tend to be quite hoppy but for a well-balanced alternative, this would be a great choice."
"O: A decent beer. Nothing special. An easy drinker."
"O - I think Weyerbacher has done a fine job with this beer. It's a little lighter on flavor and body than I prefer with amber ales, but definitely enjoyable and drinkable. 3.5"
"This is a great fester - do it"
"Overall a average ale, not the best of the Weyerbacher fleet of beer. Enjoy on a nice Fall football day."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice reddish amber color body, very little head that disaptes quickly to a thin lace. The smell has a some malty aroma and some floral hop. The taste if carmel and has some grapey flavor with some hops on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is nice and smooth, well carbonated. Overall this is a good beer, not my favorite amber ale, but close to it."
"O- pretty standard amber ale....but to a man who was raised on HopBack and Nugget Nectar, it falls short. But that really isn't a fair comparison"
"Pours a reddish caramel, a healthy off-white head retains well and laces weakly. Nose is caramel, slight roastiness, I'm getting just a hint of popcorn, a slight floral hoppiness. Taste is caramel, slight grapey sweetness, lightly roasted malts, bready. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonated well. Overall this is an enjoyable drink. Flavors are interesting and blend well, sweet, lightly roasted and bready. I would get this beer again."
"O: Weyerbacher makes some really good beers. This, their Autumn Fest, isn't one of them."
"Very nice! Poured amber with a small white head. Aroma of toasted grains and lots of sweetness. Bready taste, caramel, and I got lots of honey from it too. Some fruity tones as well. Lots of sweetness, like I said, but there's still a nice floral hoppiness that come in mid- to end-palate. Medium body and very easily drinkable."
"A boring offering by an otherwise excellent brewery. Pours a copper body with a small head with poor retention. Aromas are predominantly toasty with some wet pavement and earthy notes. Flavors are solidly toasty from beginning to end, with a dash of toffee as it transitions from mid to back palate. The taste is good but uninteresting. This first bottle is probably my last."
"Very good, easy to drink fall seasonal offering -these days it seems that all craft breweries are making pumpkin beers and/or Oktoberfest offerings and true autumn selections are getting harder to come by. Great nose of toasted malt and drinks incredibly smooth. The ratings so far on this have been way too low and I think that its lower alcohol % may factor in those scores. Overall, a very solid beer and Weyerbacker is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries - now, only if they will do something about their labels."
"M/O: Crisp and drinkable, and not too heavy. The beer isn't overwhelming in any category but it is a solid autumn beer."
"Overall: Not complex by any means, but the combination of malts is wonderful. Slight roastiness, but no bitter harshness."
"O: Weyerbacher's fall seasonal is an ale rather than a marzen type lager. Since it is an ale, I was expecting a variety of flavors (by nature ales often have more flavors than a lager). While smooth and easy to drink, the flavor profile in this beer is not very full. There is some nutty flavor, and there are grainy oats in the finish which does work well with fall. The real strength of this beer is its appearance; it really catches the light well. However, that is not enough to separate Autumn Fest from the large amount of fall seasonal offerings."
"Pours a dark amber w/ only a sliver of a cocoa head. Very little carbonation or lacing at all. Still, this is a nice looking beer, just not quite there. Nose is toasted malt, some fruit, grain.... and really that's about it. Taste is heavy on the malt and a touch of honey. Very one dimensional, and sort of a let down. Feel is carbonated, syrup-like, and fairly mediocre. Overall, this is a decent, but mediocre brew from a brewery that makes really good beers. Kind of a let down. Probably won't pick this up again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. overall it was a pretty nice beer of the style. It was flavorful and easy drinking and pretty nice overall."
"This beer lets you figure it out. It's got just the right body for the season, and all the flavors without any one flavor dominating. This is my favorite Weyerbacher brew."
"Samuel Adams Oktoberfest is sweeter than this, where this has more of a fruity, raw, a touch more bitter taste. I think I like this better. The mouthfeel is pretty medium not too heavy at all but really makes for an excellent malty beer with an added fruity, earthy hop character."
"Poured with a smallish sized off white head that soon settled down to about 2/3 light cover and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear red amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is malt, caramel, toffee, fruit. Flavor is similar to nose and is dominated by the malt with a hint of bitterness and a bit of tang for some balance. Body is ok and ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of average length. Workaday beer."
"The body is medium with just a bit of carbonation for it, lightly crisp with a nice, smooth feel all the way through."
"I definitely enjoyed this beer and would drink it again as the weather turns cooler."
"O: This is a good beer, I rather liked it and would recommend it. Shame it is only seasonal."
"o: this is a fairly solid beer. I'm a fan of Weyerbacher but I took a pass at this every year at the beer store. Instead of the million different pumpkin ales coming out this looked like the better choice at the beer store. This isn't a mind blowing beer by any means, but a good beer to have around the fridge during the fall. (Same for the Winter Ale!)"
"Drinkability/overall- overall from a brewery that i really do love and run by great people this is probably there weakest of there line i have tried, its in offensive it just sort misses the spot and is a little light and bland, could be easily drank and sessioned but real just nothing incredible, its trys to almost be an octoberfest beer but lacks the malt back bone or the real interest other wise to be and interesting amber ale,"
"O - Not bad, could probably have a few on a Fall day, but not very memorable. Also, unless this bottle is just way past it's prime, there's no way this is an Amber Ale. Much closer to a Marzen, which would make more sense given it's Autumn title."
"Decent little sessionable brew here."
"This was very good, I've had several Octoberfest style beers that I wasn't too fond of but this was a winner. Great flavor of spices and all around well balanced beer. The color was a reddish brown that fit for the season. The aromas were spicy and earthy. It had a good taste too, This ones flavor was of some allspice and some nutmeg. The malts balance the brew out a bit so it's not just a spicy mess. This is a good beer for the season."
"D: This one is good tasty and think my bottle may have suffered some trauma somewhere earning its flat character but still a good drinkable beer."
"Overall this is an ok beer with some room for improvement. I could certainly have another or even a couple at a bar. But that intangible quality that makes a great beer is just missing."
"Overall next Autumn I'll definitely be seeking out this one."
"I enjoyed this ale - it is balanced overall and works perfectly for a festbier, ale wise. It would be easy to enjoy a few on an autumn evening."
"Overall: This beer starts out promising. It really looks like fall. Unfortunatly it's falls off from there. The aroma is very bland as is the flavor profile. The mouthfeel makes up for it a bit as does the drinkability. So you're pretty much left with an unexciting easily sessionable octoberfest."
"I though this was a pretty average beer. The flavor was decent but I thought it was too thin for the style. I wouldn't mind having this again but I would't necessarily look for it."
"D - Solid drinkable amber. A bit on the sweet side and very easygoing."
"D: This is a nice version of the Marzen style. It is a bit sweeter and breadier than most."
"D: Autumnfest goes down easy. A little light in flavor for my tastes, but the perfect start to a session."
"A really good ale, apparently, i thought it was more like a marzen. Still tasty."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a minimal amount of white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and bitter hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, slight clove, flowers, and subtle nutmeg. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall another smooth beer goes down the hatch. This one really did have a pretty good flavor and aroma to it. As this brew warmed up it actually seemed to get a little bit better in my experience. Worth trying for sure."
"There's a nice balance between the malts and hops and a little bot of spice...cloves that leave a phenolic feel to the beer. This is a little unpleasant and ruins the overall experience and makes it difficult to want to open another one."
"This is a tasty beer, very refreshing and pretty well put together."
"Drinkability: An above average malty red ale. I do like the additional small kick of spice. That being said, I do not think I would go out of my way to hunt this down."
"I'm pretty sure this beer should qualify for the new category oft defined as: American Okterberfest Ale"
"Pours amber/red in body with white head. Aroma of malt, sugary syrup, cinnamon. Tastes of some spice, bread, strangely raspberry floats in for a second, plenty of gingerbread especially in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A subtly sweet red ale that acts as a light session beer for the fall afternoon."
"DB- The thing that starts to bother me here is the cherry mixed with the hops and slight spice makes it tastes a bit medicinal. It has a nice flavor, especially the bready malt finish but nothing to go out and search for."
"D-well balanced and strong hop presence with a classic malt body. slight metallic phenol in the back draws away slightly and the carbonation is a little messy in the back. solid beer, not great but decent."
"Very easy drinking, can certainly have several."
"D- tasty and enjoyable. Easy to drink and with the abv you can have a few."
"D - More reminiscent of a Marzen than an American Red... Mildly satisfying, but rather mundane... I would likely be able to drink a couple of these without ever becoming truly satisfied... There's nothing off-putting in any way shape or form, bu there's nothing remarkable or even memorable either..."
"Poured from bottle into a Sam Adams glass. The color screams Autumn, Burnt Orange, slight haze. Off White foamy diminishing head. Med. body, Malty with some hint of spice, no indication on the bottle, I guess it's just the roasted malt. Smooth Malty finish, a little sweet fruit on the finish also. When it warms, flavor seems to peak. Why one site says Red Ale....and other sites call it a Märzen/Octoberfest, one thing for sure, it does taste like Autumn. very drinkable. Damn it....I only have one."
"This is a dencent interpretation of a traditional lager/ale hybrid autumn offering. The fruity qualities actually mix with the traditional Oktoberfest flavors quite well, but the overall flavor quality is limited; if this ale is trying to taste like a lager, it succeeds. This is an easy drinker for sure, just wish it was a little more complex."
"The nose detects a subtle whiff of caramel and apple while the palate is hit with a slight tinge of malt with a sweet alcohol finish. The mouthfeel was very airy. Not a bad beer, but nothing spectacular. I don't get too much of the Weyerbacher brands, but I have enjoyed those I did."
"All in all, this brew sucks. Nothing special going on. This needs more flavor to it. Way to much water on this one. My advice, do not bother hunting this one down. Not much to offer."
"D) Yum. A well crafted seasonal. I'd drink another and recommend it on."
"Reviewed on 10/18/09. Bottle. Pours a clear amber with a small white head. Aroma of sugar, sweet malt, dark fruits. Flavor is also quite sweet with toffee, dark fruits, caramel, raisins, prunes. This is just too sweet and sugary for me, and hard to get through. Blech."
"This is the last bottle for this year; while not the top of the heap of autumn seasonal beer it is a standard and standby that I always return to."
"Poured to a hazy reddish brown with nice off white head that lingers well and leaves good lacing. Nose and mouth were both faint, but what was present was a nice blend of malty dark fruit, with a hint of toffee and caramel. Smooth mouthfeel and a pleasant finish. While nothing strong stuck out, this was an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a hazy orange amber whose head quickly disappears with minor lacing. Nice smooth taste with hints of toffee. Most of the underlying flavors are very subtle. Very low carbination makes this a very easy drinking beer. One of the better harvest ales out there."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a pleasant clear amber with a decent 2 finger head. The aroma is sweet bready and spicy. The flavor follows. The spicy, sweet finish lingers in between sips. the brew is well carbonated and has a nice medium body. This is a very good Fest beer(I know it is an ale, but I graded it as a fest beer)."
"Drinkability: despite the mild flavor profile this beer was very easy to quaff. I had two pints and probably could have had some more."
"D: Enjoyable but not great. I would drink another but nothing to write home about."
"The beer is quite sweet, honeyed, a bit tangy in parts, with a touch of lemony sharpness, decent carbonation, some hop notes in the finish that get buried behind the sweetish, roasted, crystal malts, and a touch of toffee. This is refreshing beer that goes down smoothly, not much aftertaste, nothing overly complex going on, but a good beer nevertheless."
"D: A decidedly forgettable beer. Not totally undrinkable, just not all that interesting."
"Perfect offering for the season. One of the more original brews I've tasted from Wyerbacher."
"CHEERS!!"
"Very average brew, which is not at all what I've come to expect from Weyerbacher. Well, no one is perfect, right?"
"Aroma is primarily malt, no spice or hop character to speak of, you can smell the sweetness of the beer. Beer is full bodied, has an aftertaste, seem like a heavy lager almost. Does not taste bad, interesting malt character in the forward and back flavors, no hop bitterness at all. Overall drinkability average."
"d- good, glad i got a chance to try this one, when i had it i thought/assumed it was an octoberfest not a amber/red ale, it was solid non the less."
"This beer pours copper/amber color with a 1/4 inch of off white head that quickly receded. Some spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose on this was mild - though predominantly malts with a slight hint of hops. Taste is sweet caramel malts in the forefront with the middle more grainy and bready, the finish has a touch of floral hop bite and a hint of apples. LIght to medium body, medium carbonation, crisp mouthfeel and goes down easily. Not a beer that I would seek out, however, is still quite drinkable."
"Anyhow, the Weyerbacher was nothing special. Somewhat foggy amber tone with a slightly bitter tang in the aroma, mixed with a nice malty waft with a touch of charred cloves. Medium body that felt rather flat; flavors of citrus, cloves, a bit of toast and some apples. It had an autumnal feel to it bu overall was mediocre. Feh. You can easily do better."
"This beer has a very nice cooper tone when poured into a pint glass. It maintains a slight milky head after the intial pour. The beer has an aroma of dried fruit more specifically prunes. Taste is quite mellow with sweet malty flavor that lingers. After each sip I noticed very little carbination and it seems almost flat. In terms of drinkability it has a smooth, sweet flavor that is an interseting interpretation of an autumn beer but I would seek something a little less sweet next trip to the store."
"Drink is ok nothing great. This is a decent beer nothing worth searching out but maybe a taster if you haven't seen it around."
"D: This a beer that I will drink again."
"Thick, frothy head over a finger, lots of different bubble sizes, eggshell white in color, lacing has some good grip. Some gauziness to the lighter orange-amber hue, holds light well and the glow compensates for the lighter rims. Nice bready nose, pretzel dough, rye, almost pumpernickel before lemon peel, a vague wildflower dash, no bitterness nor any sweetness for that matter, cigar wrapper and tar more than any caramel or toffee. Medium-bodied, strong carbonation frames the mouth entry and adds presence. Same demure profile to the rye, grain, cereal flavors, added to by a mineral water kind of freshness. At the same time, there's a dry ashen quality as well, not enough for tackiness but evident as there's minimal juice in lemon citrus and apricot, peach fruit flavors. Retains its quiet profile, nothing sticks out to either annoy you or tickle your fancy. In the end, you wish it would take a more decisive position now and then."
"Overall, I was disappointed with this bier. I have heard great things about this brewery but this is not a good intro to them. If your friends have it in their fridge, have it because it will be free, but don't bother paying for it."
"Final thoughts: Until this beer I was a big fan of Weyerbacher. This beer alone has made me think twice about that. It's like a fake version of a Fireside or bad Autumnfest. Pretty sweet, artificial flavors, Almost a drain pour... wait, I think it IS a drain pour!"
"Meh."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of malts with some sweetness. Tastes a bit malty with a dry finish. Pleasent and refreshing. Feels o.k. in the mouth. Drinkability is not bad, but not a beer I could drink all night. Overall this is a quality brew."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker ""pint"" glass and appears a scarlet red/brown color with about half an inch of light tan head. No lacing to speak of. Smells and tastes of light caramel malt, biscuits, and a touch of molasses. A notch below medium in body and carbonation."
"Picked up a single of this at Green's on Ponce. Pours a red/amber color with very little head or lacing on the glass. Bready nose with a little bit of malt. Taste is pretty average. Malty, bready, and a little bit of sweetness. Slightly watery mouthfeel. Relatively low ABV make this pretty drinkable. Average at best."
". The smell is sweet malt with some vanilla. The taste starts off with some toasted malt with toffee and some of the vanilla in the nose that gives way to a tiny hint of floral hops. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some nonagressive carbonation. This is tasty little beer that has really impressed me for the price I found it for."
"Orange hue. plenty of carbonation that keeps a nice layer of head on top of the beer. smell is malty with notes of grass. taste is slightly bitter up front, then trickles into a sweetness, then back to a strong bitter hop finish. mouthfeel is creamier than i would have expected, especially from a growler pour."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination yielded and very nice, good drinking fall beer. An excellent malt backbone made for a very good beer overall."
"In the end, it was just another simple crispy toasted Ale, but what separates this one from the others is that this beer has a dead alien or a mummy on the label. Was it a Fall treat? I guess, but one should do the trick. I couldn't see drinking more than one of these in a sitting because there's really nothing to this beer. It's just an average beer."
"The aroma is malty and yeasty with an ESB type of yeast that gives it a nutty and funky twang. There is also a hint of hops. The appearance is amber with a pleasant looking head. The flavor is like the aroma which isnt actually all that bad. The palate is smooth but a little thin. Overall its decent."
"D- meh this one just doesnt do it for me. too bland and tasteless. glad i got to try it, i dont think ill be having this one again."
"Pours a nice amber color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white head, with some sticky lacing. The nose is malty, caramel, slight spice. The taste follows the nose. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a redish copper color. The beer poured a nice big head that was white and I had high hopes. The beer was kinda sweet and bready. However it really lacked any body and was watery fake tasteing. I will not buy again."
"Pours a rich copper with dense head and great lacing. The aroma is malty and biscuity, like the smell of dry autumn leaves. The flavor is smooth and malty, slightly pumpkiny, with a nice burn down the throat. The mouthfeel is thin and smooth."
"D/O: An interesting ale-interpretation of a traditional lager-style. The fruity qualities actually mix with the traditional Oktoberfest flavors quite well, forming a whole host of seasonal tastes in one bottle. Flavor masks the ABV well, making this an easy one to enjoy over the course of several pints. Overall an extremely enjoyable celebration of the changing of seasons."
"D: I had a few with my meal, a decent sessionable Ale."
"This beer pours a light amber color, head sticking to the glass for just a little bit. This beer is properly labeled as an amber ale and not an oktoberfest, as the malt presence is definetly not the same. That being said, this beer still tastes of autumn. Apple and plum notes are found in the aroma and the taste. Malt and hop charactersitics balance really nicely in the aftertaste and the low alcohol make this a great fall session beer."
"poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear amber color with a nice fluffy head that disappears rather quickly. Smells nutty, with some bready-caramel background. Taste is weak, almost watered down, no hops here. Like drinking a soggy nut-bread. Good carbonation thru-out. Can't say I enjoyed, can't say I hated it. I'm just stuck in the middle."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: This will be gone fairly soon but I doubt I'll necessarily grab another anytime soon"
"Not worth a second try."
"Kinda like an Oktoberfest apple cider. Too sweet to drink many more than one."
"It is a pleasant beer, easily drinkable but probably not my first..or second choice when grabbing a fest beer in the fall."
"D, notes: A nice sessionable red ale for the fall."
"D - This is easily drinkable, as all fest beers should be, though the malt character lacks the depth and richness of some other examples of the style."
"Drinkability: This is where Weyerbacher shined with this, excellent drinkability, very light on the pallete, yet still delivers a solid offering at 6.10 ABV. This is a little more instrumental then alot of other selections out there, but overall it's very sessionable and a perfect match to those cold weather evenings."
"D: very drinkable amber ale, and the spices make this a great fall classic. well worthy of a try."
"Amber orange in color with a thin head and spotty lacing. Lower carbonation. Smell is fairly light. Toasted bready malts and light sweetness. Not much to say for hops except for an herbal, earthy quality that they bring to the brew. Taste is also big on the light toasted malts. A small touch of chocolate comes through. Also a tea like quality. Pretty thin feeling in the mouth. Lacking in carbonation and perhaps a touch more hop character. I can see how this is something like an Oktoberfest brew and moving toward an Amber. It's nothing terrible and pretty interesting, though I doubt it's one I'll return to often."
"Quite tasty. I don't think you will find this in liter steins anywhere, but I would turn this down if offered again."
"Bottle: Poured a medium amber color lager with an average head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of dry caramel hops with no discernable hops or many other characteristics. Taste is also dominated by some dry caramel malt. I know this is not the most extreme style out there and it is meant to be drank in large quantities but this one was just a bit too average in all aspects."
"D- Easy drinking beer. With all the malts and sweets going on I may not be able to drink a ton of these in a sitting. I enjoyed this beer but still I feel like some spice could be added."
"D. This is a good session beer if you don't mind getting a bit silly. I say session away responsibly! Or enjoy one with buffalo chicken dip like I am.."
"Drinkability is very high. This beer typifies a lot of autumn tastes. It has a great toffee taste and strong malt characteristics. The sharp bite, but smooth finish typifies the weather and attitude of the autumn season that the beer is created for. Definitely recommended to drink on a crisp fall day."
"D - a good tasting, easy drinking, fall seasonal brew."
"D- an interesting mix of flavors here and it is decent and i cuold see myself with a sixer of this. This would be great on a crips and cool autumn day."
"3.5/3.5/3.5/4/4.5"
"Overall this is a good fall beer, but I'm going to stick to traditional Marzens. Worth a shot though."
"D: Pretty drinkable and certainly worth getting."
"D: A pleasure to drink, well done. Maybe not a marzen when taken in its entirety, but drinkable- yes. Not great, but awfully tasty."
"Overall my thoughts would be ehh. Forgettable, boring, and painfully average. Not a bad beer per se, just not something i would particularly want to go back to."
"Drink ability a good beer that was easy to drink. I will buy again next season"
"Shared a bottle of this with pghlee at the Brick Store. Thanks Lee. Poured copper colored with a thin head that settled to a thin swirl on top. The smell was very promising with wonderful aromas of sweet, bready malt with banana, clove, and a banana bread finish. Unfortunately the taste was far more washed out, exhibiting none of the richness found in the aroma. Tastes very bready and a bit heavy, but wihout that bread-in-the-oven quality found in the aroma. Grainy, a little thin, and with a metallic zinc-like taste up front followed by a light sweetness and a touch of banana bread on the finish. Fairly highly carbonated but somewhat thin. Lacks a bit of richness. This is okay overall, but there are a number of other fest beers out there I'd choose over this one. Also, what gives? It is August! A bit early yet for the fest season. At least wait for Sep. 1 to release these."
"Pours a nice light copper color, more of a pale ale than an amber/red, but still nice, allows a nice splash of light to come through; has a bit of head that immediately goes away with very little lacing. Nice scent, malty, but with a very sour aroma, much like an Irish red. Very sweet and sour taste, although with very little spices as I would expect from an Autumn brew, although there are very small bits of cinnamon. Goes down fine, but there are better fall beers out there."
"Recommended..."
"Poured a light amber color with a thick one inch head that gave way to some nice lacing. The smell was not that great. A grassy smell with a hint of sweetness and some hops. The taste was a little better with some sweet caramel and a slight spiciness. Seemed a little watered down for a Weyerbacher brew but it could just be the style. Good drinkability but nothing special."
"Caramel malt also largely contributes to the taste, has hints of other spice that lingers, not quite typical of an amber/red ale, more of an Oktoberfest style."
"D: A hearty and an easy, beautiful drink for the fall season. Can honestly sit and enjoy this all night around the campfire on a brisk fall night."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, this one seems to be a hybrid of an Oktoberfest and a Winter Warmer. I could drink a few of them, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"Pours a very foggy orange-ish brown. No head in my Duvel tulip. Nose is slightly leafy. Very little to it. Flavor is even and constant with a slow drop off. Profile has a obvious leafy thing going on. Beyond that it's a very mild almost citric thing. More like the flavor of an orange with absolutely no sweetness from it. More like old almost dead orange outer skins. Okay. Enough typing out of my ass. Feel is decent. Low bubble hitting my tongue. Liquid is decent. Overall this is a very easy drinker. Nothing wild or crazy. Just a smooth and even brew. Worth a shot."
"A 12ox bottle poured into a pint glass. It was a hazy orange/amber color with a small head. Somewhat muted aroma: sweet malt and some fruit. Tasting revealed the fruit to be pumpkin, with a light malt background. I think I also got a hint of maple syrup. A crisp, enjoyable beer; a good session beer."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable autumn brew."
"Drinkable, but not necessarily enjoyable if you tend to prefer a more robust beer. Then again, this is an amber/ red ale."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. Surprisingly reddish colored for something I thought would be more ""seasonal"". Finding out it was a red ale and that the red colors were quite sharp though gave me approval. The aroma definitely had the classic smells: cinnamon, pumpkin, spice, etc. It's taste was a great balance of hops and spice, making it very accessible. It's thick, low-carb feel made it come down smooth. Overall, a very accessible autumnal beer."
"Of the many ""October/Autumn"" fests I've had...this one is a very close second to Paulaner O-fest! Very beautiful amber color...nice, smoooth and caramely taste....but not too sweet...and very drinkable. I truly like this one, and was glad my buddy brought some to my place to sample over the weekend. We enjoyed 'em with brats and German fair! Nice brew, Weyerbacher. HIGHLY recommended if you like this style of brew. Great for the fall season, for color, AND flavor. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"D- This one looks and tastes like an ale version of Oktoberfest. Its a good idea and a decent beer but for this brew's color I expected a lot more caramel malt presence. Drinkable and somewhat enjoyable. Not my favorite from Weyerbacher."
"Looks like clear dark apple juice with a couple of bubbles. Has a dense off-white head. Nose is gentle hops and slight biscuity malts. Taste has a hint of metallic flavor, with a malty backbone, a mile unnatural sweetness, and some alcohol on the end. Not too much good going on here. However, mouthfeel is above average, it's more dense than expected and really fills out your mouth. Drinkability is exactly average."
"12oz brown bottle from the Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an amber red translucent body with a half inch of off-white head. Smells like roasted malt with a hint of diacetyl. Roasty husky malt dominate with little hops to speak of, with hints of diacetyl. Light to medium in body with just enough carbonation to make it a fairly drinkable brew. Tasty enough, but not their best offering, nor is it the best ""Octoberfest"" ale out there."
"Overall, not too bad. Could stand alone outside the fall seasonal time as a reasonable light amber ale."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Phenomenal. Great beer."
"drinkable?: not much"
"Drinkability: All the flavors come together nicely to create a pleasing, refreshing Oktoberfest beer."
"Drinkability - So I'll admit this isn't my fav style and this brews just okay, but I still enjoyed it. Weyerbacher has a nice brew you should give a shot if you get a chance, but definetly not one worth going out of your way."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden in the big malt flavors. The ale is a good fit for the season."
"Light bodied, and a real easy drinker. Might be a nice one for drinking a sixer out by the fire or something."
"I think a more descriptive label would have given me a hint (and I might not have picked it up). I guess the others of the Weyerbacher breed had opened the door wide in my mind, and this one just didn't compare. Still, I would not refuse one of these, I just won't buy it again."
"Overall I could drink several of these but would not seek it out in the future."
"Pours a clear light copper hue with a one finger fluffy white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles lasting throughout. I really enjoy this smell, very unique. Has a hint of dried leaves almost, and yes, I do enjoy that smell. Also combines some mild caramel sweetness and a tiny bit of floral hops as well. Taste starts off with a clean citrusy hops that is quickly diluted by the malty sweetness. Aftertaste leaves an almost tea like flavor that is quite enjoyable, to me anyway. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit too much carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, I found this one went down much quicker than I had anticipated. Nice twist on the autumn seasonal."
"Grainy, first mouthfeel impression, starts to smooth out the more you drink and becomes drier also. Not bad could drink a few not a beer i would buy,but I won't turn it down either."
"Drinkability: Great for a fall evening. Slightly warming with enough flavor to get you by and not kill you after a six pack. Worth a shot."
"Nothing wrong with getting a jump start on the fall seasonals. This one pours an amber color with a tannish head that dies down to a thin cap, but leaves ample lacing. Smells of bread with a small malt background, but there's little here to sniff at. Tasting reveals more of the same with a hint of caramel and a slight hop snap. I'm also picking up some hints of honey. Mouthfeel is a little to thin with plenty of carbonation. I could easily see this as a sessionable beer with football on its way. A good choice for a day like today where there are hints of fall coming in the winter, but not a standout brew."
"Overall: If you can have Christmas in July why not Oktoberfest. This is not a true Marzen (they dont claim it to be one, though it reminds me of one), but its a nice drinker nonetheless. I enjoy Oktoberfest and drinking all the offerings by America's best micro breweries. This beer has me looking forward to the start of fall and to many many cases of different Oktoberfest brews. Prost!"
"Hmm, I've never said this before, but this beer is best enjoyed in larger gulps. Sipping leaves an empty, almost watery taste on your tongue. In larger considerations it has a nice roasted edge and smooth body, making it ideal for the litre steins of O-fest. I don't think I'd go for this outside of the beer holiday however."
"OK, Im probably drinking this a little bit late (February), but oh well. From a 12 ozer, this poured with the appearance of fall ... bright and orange, with a thin cloud cover. The aroma is light and airy with almost a sense of a gourd. Sweet, to be sure, very much in the Vienna-Fest family, with light caramel all around the edges. This of course isnt doing anything to warm my blood on this frigid wet February evening, but it would probably be a nice session beer for a cool crisp fall night when the leaves are just starting to fall down. (#2728, 2/25/2007)"
"Pours a reddish amber with decent head that dissipates very quickly leaving next to no retention. Not much at all in the way of carbonation. Smell is of sweet malts. Taste is slightly sweet, maybe a hint of spice, and a feint hop presence. Pretty well balanced but a bit light and bland. Overall, pretty average brew."
"Drinkability: What an Oktoberfest would be if an Oktoberfest could be an ale; come to think of it, that's not such a bad idea for a beer; decent session beer"
"Overall: This one should be listed as a Marzen/Oktoberfest rather than an American Amber/Red. Given that it's a fairly good Oktoberfest, a little sweet for my liking but worth a shot."
"Drinkability is good and enjoyable enough beer a wee bit different, not bad but don't see making this purchase again as better ambers are available."
"I prefer a bigger hop profile, but that is personal preference and not a style flaw for this beer. It was pretty good, and easy to drink, but I probably won't have it again."
"This is more of an Oktoberfest/Marzen style than a red/amber. And I might add...one of the best ones I have had. A copper body with a slim head that sunk down to a thin layer around the glass leaving some lacing down the side after every drink. Nice semi-sweet malt with some caramel undertones. Very smooth and finishes nicely. A highly drinkable take on a lager that compliments the coolness of autumn."
"12 ounce bottle."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. It pours a clear orangey amber with a finger of ecru head that leaves little lacing. The bouquet is buttery, almost sugary/syrupy with toasty/caramel malts, mild hops and some fruity/floral esters. The flavor is the same, light, with a mild bitterness that slowly creeps up on top of a light body that has medium carbonation and leaves a short finish. First off, it needs a lager yeast, as the ale yeast makes it to floral and fruity, but after that they need to beef up the toasted and caramel malts. As is, it's too light and comes across as a Yuengling fermented with ale yeast. I realize they are experimenting a bit, but I think they should have gone a more traditional route."
"Overall this is an atypical fall beer that still taste like fall. Very solid fall seasonal from Weyerbacher."
"This beer is above average for the style. I think the style listed is not accurate. This beer just does not fit the amber ale style. There is a spiced smell and the taste is like an Oktoberfest. A smooth drinkable beer that is a good way to welcome the fall. I would drink this beer again. There is an ever-so-slight warming feeling to this beer too."
"D-This one is definitely a session beer....the first night I drank it was before I went out to a concert....easy to drink, slightly filling....overall a good brew...might be a little pricey at its normal price...I think $1.99 a bottle, or $10 a six pack."
" Overall I like this beer a great deal and I know several of my friends will like it too. So I guess I will be buying a case to make sure theres enough."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"No mouthfeel. Very watery and hardly any body. I only bought a six pack, but I should have purchased a single. Not a very good beer. I like most other Weyerbacher offerings, this one completely misses."
"Taste features bittersweet biscuity malts with a subdued, but balancing, spicy hops profile. Very nice and well balanced. Very tasty and quite sessionable considering the abv. An excellent effort from this underappreciated brewery. Thanks to mntlover for sending this one out my way."
"Pours a clear amber with minimal head that dissipates quickly. Good malty smell with no notice of hops. The taste is quite good, well balanced with a smooth, clean finish. As it turns out seems a very drinkable brew, could easily throw down a few more of these."
"Picked this beer up because I thought it was an Oktoberfest from the bottle and name, rather disappointed to find that it isn't. Pours a bright clear copper-red, a thin white head that vanishes quickly, no lacing. Nose is a slight, somewhat sweet, malt, slight bit of fruit, not much going on. Taste is a biscuity, slightly sweet malt upfront, a hint of apple, caramel, and hops coming through in the middle, finishing with a nice amount of bitterness and a small hint of alcohol. Nothing offensive about this beer, but nothing really that great either, and combined with the thin mouthfeel, it's really not a beer I'm likely to buy again."
"It's not densely so, but it is certainly malty, and with a light snap of spice to boot. The combination actually makes it more drinkable as it moves along, and a bit more as a whole than just a reflection of each part. It's not a great offering, or even a real good one, but I wouldn't turn down another one."
"An average beer. This has it's drawbacks and it's strengths. Might go good with a blue cheese coated steak. I wouldn't go lookiiing for this, and would pass it by if I saw it, all in the hunt for something better."
"Pours out a light amber color with a bubbly off white head, which dissapeared pretty quick. I get some spicy hops in the nose, and some pretty sweet malt. It tastes pretty good, same spicy hops, but the malt tastes more toasted than sweet. It is not particularly full bodied, kind of falls flat. In terms of the style, it is pretty easy drinking. In terms of the brewer, Weyerbacher, it is way tame. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, with some decent carbonation. This is a pretty easy drinking beer, and a nice change of pace for someone who isn't a serious beer drinker. For someone looking for a fuller beer, keep looking."
"Pours an autumn orange color with a good white fluffy head. Some lacing. Not much smell, slight hop and grain aroma. Smooth taste with a slight malt finish. Good balance between the hops and malts Good drinkability, could be a decent session beer. I like the autumnFest name. Great artwork on bottle"
"Poured a dark-brown color with a soft, thin, white-colored head. The surface was covered with small bubbles, leaving behind just a touch of lacing. Aromas of malt, dried fruit, cream, and freshly baked pie. Creamy and sweet with a nice hop finish. A gentle roasted flavor with grain/bread flavors. Light texture, but still smooth and slightly velvet-like. In my opinion, this tasted like a cross between an English IPA and an English Brown Ale. Overall, I enjoyed this beer with its great texture and varied flavors."
"The drinkability on this beer is very high. It is enjoyable from the top down. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Cheers!"
"Single bottle purchased at Whole Foods Raleigh"
"Pours a clear orange/amber color with a medium head of tan bubbles. Aroma is a mix of grain and earthy hops. Taste follows the aroma with just a hint of sweetness. Aftertaste is mild, slight bitter earthy twang. Not bad. Average to above average amber ale. Dont get too excited, but this is a solid fall session beer. Very easy to drink. To be honest, this reminded me of Yuengling with a bit more malt. Perhaps a big brother?"
"Crystal clear amber with a short cap of white foam. Good retention and a bit of lacing. Malty aroma with notes of caramel and honey, slightly floral. Mostly sweet, the malt character is still a little thin. Light floral bitterness as well. Dry finish. Not bad, but fairly average. There are a lot of Octoberfests and other seasonals that I'd go for before having this again."
"Nothing groundbreaking from Weyerbacher, but a pleasant offering that foreshadows fallen leaves and cooler weather."
"The appearance is really excellent here with a nice amber body and a big tan colored head that retains impressively. The aroma is mostly authentic with caramel and toasted bread upfront, along with a spicy and floral hops presence, some dark fruits and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with caramel malts upfront along with some toasted bread, dark fruits, spicy and floral hops, some mild yeastiness and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium with excellent drinkability. A solid and moderately complex octoberfest."
"Seriously good stuff here. A crystal amber with a off white head that gives up some lacing. A dominating German malt smell that is slacked with some gentle earthy hops. The taste is everything I thought it would be from the smell. It has that fall O-fest taste but is bodied up and their is a creamy aspect to this beer as well. The hops help dry out the finish. Not too thick not too thin right on time, this beer should be put into year round production."
"All in all a nice Autumn offering. I could easily drink a few on the patio and watch the leaves turn colors."
"I liked this one. Not the standard O'Fest, as it has a bit more hops than the style and is a bit lighter on the pallatte. Nice amber/copper coloration and a bit of bread in the initial nose. The hop finish catches you at the end. Good stuff from Weyerbacher."
"Was expecting a bit more from this one. Maybe I'm a bit harsh but, when I think autumn, I think Dopplebock/Oktoberfest styles. AutumnFest has the appearance and smell, but the taste is way lighter than I had expected. It was lightly carbonated and the head laced the chalice till the end, however I wasn't sold. The flavors blended well but were gone in a flash. This one, to me, is light enough to be a session beer, but I wasn't looking for that when I bought this one. A good beer to have around to offer the average someone, something different. But, I wouldn't brag too much about AutumnFest to someone who knows beers."
"Not a bad beer at all, though it didn't rock my beer world. But, it did hit the spot on a damp night."
"Overall- A tasty beer. This does just fine on a hot day as well as a warm Autumn afternoon or a cool crisp night!!"
"Pours a pretty but prosaic deep amber with minimal head. Aromas of rich, dry malts and slight sour yeast. On the palate, opens up with sweetness before shifting into a mellow graininess with a slight bite. Smooth, easy going mouthfeel. Overall, a very smooth, pleasing autumn session beer."
"This beer pours a nice reddish amber with a medium tan foamy head. The smell is weak with some sweet malt and little else. The taste has a high carbonation feel to it with a malt sweetness thats not bad. The flavors are also nutty and very chewy. The m/f is light and well balanced making this a good beer worth trying."
"Not an exceptional beer, but a bit above average. Worth a try."
"I had hoped that Autumn Fest would bring back memories of good beer enjoyed during my favorite season of the year. Because of the lack of style specificity, I had a hard time finding a focal point, something to grab onto and appreciate for its own sake. This is not one of Weyerbacher's better efforts."
"Easy enough to drink. Just not very exciting..."
"Poured a cloudy peach color with scant slightly off-white head that quickly feel to a thin ring. Lacing is minimal. Smell is of sweet, toasted malt combined with a dark cherries. Taste is dark and malty. Caramel tastes are to be found. A bit of dryness is revealed that helps to temper the sweet maltiness. Dryness becomes stronger in the finish to get a nice ending. A very good autumn beer."
"This is probably the most disappointing beer I've had from Weyerbacher to date. Their stuff is usually dead nuts, but this one leaves alot to be desired. Not enough malt character for a good fall seasonal, IMO."
"Pours a nice amber/red color, moderate lacing. Aroma is bready. Taste is slightly sour, and notes of floral hops. It's okay, not great. The sour taste puts me off a bit from it though. It's an okay beer, but it has room to grow and improve."
"Pours a hazy, dark copper with a small, off-white, creamy head with good retention. Ths smell is mostly grassy malt with caramel and some light citrus. The taste is full of big caramel malts with some bread and light esters and a nice, crisp, light citrus finish. It has a medium body, tea-like texture and low carbonation. Quite tasty and just unique enough to keep it separated in my mind from the many other fest/märzens Ive had lately. A good fall beer."
"Although initially satisfying, this is a very plain beer with little flavour and strong carbonation. Amber colour, some lace, not much head. Have had much better autumn seasonals. There could be a drop of smoke in mid sip. Touch of hops, not too malty."
"Pours a nice amber color. Looks like autumn in a glass! One inch head went into a nice lace. Very refreshing, sweet with a nice finish. I would compare it to a good honey brown. I liked this beer a lot. This beer would be a good choice any time of the year!"
"Overall, even if you don't get the best ""experience"" with this one, it is a very easy beer to consume in mass quantities...that is, until you fall over drunk! ;)"
"Pretty good - but should be better from this house."
"Pale orange color. Decent white head with a heavy pour. Dissipates quickly to a thin lace that leaves nice trails down the glass. Smell is nondescript, slight malt with something a little off, maybe mettalic. Taste is ok, kind of like a mild pale ale. Faint hops finish. Decent feel on the tongue and nice level of carbonation. Not one of Weyerbacher's best offering but worth a try."
"Drinkability? Wouldn't again. I got several Octoberfests to try, and while this is a better beer than your average ale, it just didn't make any kind of impression."
"Poured a perfectly clear brown in color with a centimeter thick head.. The head receded to formy a spotty film. Mouthfeel was odd. For a fall seasonal I was expecting something more juicy (which this beer was trying to do) but it had a sudden dry smack on the lips that left me wondering what the hell was going on. Nose is malts that have soured. Flavor is all malts with just a slight hop bitterness towards the very end. Malts come across as bits of biscutis, toast, little bits of pumpkine pie spices and overripe fruit. It was the overripe fruit that knocked this beer off for me. As representative of the style the malts in the beer were too sour and not rich enough."
"Pours a light somewhat cloudy orange-amber with decent off-white head that quickly dissipates into only a thin film. Honey smell out of the bottle, but not much aroma in the glass. Good carbonation a swirl generates a nice cap of very fine bubbles along with a tart aroma behind a carmelized malt front. Definite fruit - tartish apple - taste with a honey malty sweetness reminiscent of the opening aroma. Perhaps a touch of spice  cinnamon? Smooth, with a nice gradual finish. Thin lacing doesnt hold. Medium bodied and nicely drinkable given its relatively high alcohol content. Fairly light for a octoberfest, correctly identified closer to a red ale here. Either way, a solid autumn seasonal  good fall session beer."
"Drinkability is ok. Nothing special. Perhaps my least favorite brew from Weyerbacher."
"The taste was a great combination of noble malts. Hardly any hop bitterness in this brew, just enough to balance the malt bomb character. The mouthfeel was clean with good body. The beer is very drinkable but I would not recommend this as a session beer, each bottle should be savored! Cheers!"
"Decent. Approachable. And a good fall-style session brew."
"This is a middle of the road ale. Very safe, very drinkable."
"Mellow malt aroma mixed with fresh floral hops and a strange model glue smell. Small light tan colored head faded quickly to a scattered film. Transparent caramel colored beer with streams of tiny bubbles rising slowly within. Slightly sweet solid malt flavor up front is quickly overtaken by sweet floral hops that hold a mildly bitter bite. All comes together in a hop tea flavored finish. Moderately light bodied, goes down smooth."
"Solid Octoberfest beer. Perfect for the style. It is malty and sugary sweet. Has a wheat bread quality to it. Although it is a great example of the Marzen/Octoberfest style...I have to say that I'm not impressed with the style as a whole. So, that's why the average scores."
"Edit to add, yes I know it's the wrong time of year, but is there ever a wrong time for a good beer?"
"Poured a hazy amber color wiht a slightly off white head that stuck around for quite a while and left some lacing. The scent is of sweet malts and fresh bread dough. The taste was of some sweet malts and finished with yet more malt The mouthfeel was pretty decent, it had nice body and good carbonation. I would drink this one again. Yet another good offering from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a see through copper with a moderate sized off-white head. Solid lacing and retntion. Smells quite fruity, mainly apple and pear. Sweetly malty with some fig, raisin, and brown sugar poking around. Turns slightly astringent with a weak hop finish. Slightly oily mouthfeel with a very high drinkability."
"Slightly hazed copper tone. Thin, bubbly beige head. Moderate lace is left. Nice aroma of toasted malts, vienna malts. Bread is noted as well on the nose. Taste follows through with the toasted/vienna/bread thing, but not to the extent that'd I'd like to see in a marzen. Hops add some drying notes. Malts are represented fairly well here overall and the sweetness is not overbearing. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and the body is round and almost full. Solid Marzen here."
"Pumpkin orange in color; some cloves and malt grace the nose. Very creamy, milkshake texture; becomes just a bit sour as she warms. Decent hop bitterness; carbonation is a bit over the top. Honey and apple, the green ones, are noted in the body as well. A decent, change of pace marzen."
"Starts malty, malty/hoppy finish. Boring for an autumn fest, no strong flavor. 12 oz bottle $1.65 from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, VA."
"Weyerbacher Autumn Fest 2004. This cloudy copper beer had a small, but lasting head as well as some streaky lace. The aroma was rather too subtle, some hop bouquet, nutty, with a tad of sweetness. The taste is this beer's real strong point. Good flavoring hops are blended well with the malt to make this a smooth, tasty beer. It has some nuttiness to it as well as a decent bite. The slightly dry finish is hoppy with a bit of sweetness. Not a great beer but pretty drinkable."
"The taste was medium bodied, malty and surprisingly rather meaty. Tasted almost like mellow turkey gravy at times. I know it sounds weird, but it does. Theres a very quick bitterness but for most part its almost non-existent. For the most part though, a very clean, psuedo-german, oktoberfest-ish beer. Id have another, but not until after I checked my other options out first."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head above the copper brew. Head lasts well, and lacing is good. Aroma is pleasantly malty, with a slight fruit tinge. Taste is similar to the nose, with warm sweet malts upfront, which switches to a slight sour fruit, which is subsequently mellowed by some soft hops bitterness. Mouthfeel downed a tad by the sour, but still a nice fall treat, and drinkability is good as well."
"Beer is good. Happy local beering."
"This is a mostly malty beer. Light hop, but even the aftertaste is the remnants of pale and crystal malts--with a touch of bitterness and sourness. Very full bodied, good carbonation. A good beer, easy to drink, but fairly run-of-the-mill."
"Bender Factor: Good variation of style, deviates from the typical fall seasonal. Not labeled as an Oktoberfest, appropriate. Would make an excellent ""session"" brew. Price here in Buffalo was too much, $10.00. Otherwise, Autumn is perfect for the fall, drinkable from early Sept untill the snow starts a flying."
"12 oz. bottle. This year's label is different than the one pictured. Pours a light copper color with a frothy beige head. Some stickage and lacing. Bready, malty nose with a touch of fruitiness, mostly apple. Initial impression is that it is rather malty sweet, with some light fruitiness and a small amount of hops that show up moreso in the finish. Alcohol seems noticable, but not overbearing. Lightly toasted character. Pretty nice and interesting twist on the Maerzen/Oktoberfest style."
"A strange beer -- at first I didn't like it, but it quickly grew on me, and I think it would make a decent session beer. But I wouldn't seek it out."
"Pours out an amber/reddish color with a good amount of carbonation visible. Smell consisted of malts, some nutty and fruity aromas in there as well. Some distant caramel aromas also show up. Taste is also malty with some various spices showing up, along with some nuttiness, but then it turns quite sweet. It's not really overwhelming, but it also doesn't seem out of place. It is balanced ot handle the sweetness so it does go hand in hand. Mouthfeel was light to medium with some good carbonation mixing in. Not a bad seasonal at all, perhaps for some people the sweetness could bring down the drinkability, which I gave an average rating. Having another bottle of this stuff, the sweetness may get in a way and become annoying."
"Drinkability & Notes: Delicious, with that psuedo-ocktoberfest flavor. This is just the kind of beer that I want to lead into the cooler months with."
"This beer pours out a clear copper body with a single finger of tan foam for the head. The head dissipates to a thin lacing layer with some decent lace down the glass. The nose is light but gives some hint of its hopping. The taste tends to the sweet side with some hints of pumpkin and very light spicing. The body is medium and lacks real crispness. Good drinkability overall."
"About what I expected from something called Autumnfest....Very tasty beverage...pours a semi hazy orangee color...minimal head....nice sweet nose....some definite pumpkin pie....also some toasty notes....very toasty tasting...sweet....some subtle pumpkin pie flavors....this is quite enjoyable...perhaps a bit too sweet for a session beer but a nice treat none-the-less....I'd drink this one again for sure.."
"this is a different tasting marzen/o'fest than i can ever recall having. it's heartier and more full in general. it pours a decent looking amber colour with an average sized head to top it off. looks farily crisp as well. the nose is of malt, earth and sweetness. i may have picked up a touch of pumpkin in here as well. the taste, as metioned, is unique. malt dominates but thrown into the mix are earth, berry and other fruit(which provides for some sweetness and some sorur flavour), rubber band, some honey and caramel. mouthfeel is nice and crisp. this one is inviting in a strange sort of way. it's not your run of the mill brew. it's not out of this world, but it's a far cry from being even average. try it for a taste of something different at the very least."
"It is respectable that Weyerbacher correctly labeled this one an ""Autumnfest Ale"" rather than an Oktoberfest. That may have gotten the Germans really pissed off. Being an ale rather than a lager this has great flavor of the traditional malts. It pours a bronzy red with an eggshell head. Smell is malty and a little roasty with the sweet grains. The flavor is sweet and malty with an earthy hop balance and has some low estery fruitiness from the ale fermentation. Probably the most flavorful ""Oktoberfest"" I've had this season. I hope my homebrewed ofest ale turns out this tasty."
"Drinkability and overall: I haven't had many of the classic o-fest beers so I don't know if this is a ""classic"" example. However, it's truly enjoyable. Definitely towards the malty side but a nicely balanced beer."
"A dark orange/amber color with a small off white head that leaves just alittle lace. Has a rich biscut/malty aroma. The biscut characteristic carries over into the flavor at the start of the taste. Followed by a malty sweetness with just a hint of bitterness on the finish. A tasty drinkable O'Fest beer."
"crystal clear brillant amber color with a thin white head. rich depth of chewy malts, bread very appetizing. some hop notes and a slight buttery wift. thin lacking body mild malt character, compared to the aroma it seems like a totally different beer it needs to be alittle more intense for me. still very clean and very drinkable."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent that is light and creamy. It is a bit yeasty. The taste is great. It has a very smooth, light, and malty flavor that goes down smooth and finishes sweet and fruity. It has a slight hop taste that balances the palate and increases it's complexity. The mouthfeel is awesome as well. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good Marzen/Autumn ale. It has good aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel; a good drinker."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy brownish-red color with two fingers of head. There is lots of lacing left on the glass. The smell consists of malty and grassy aromas. Just a hint of hops too. The taste is very malty up front, with lots of caramel flavor. It is balanced out with a good dose of hops on the finish. Just a bit of alcohol flavor in there as well. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong, and the drinkability is really good. A good fall seasonal."
"Decent. A dark reddish colour reminscent of fall leaves. A small white head tops this brew, and than quickly dissapears. The aromas are of honeyed malts and light floral hops. The taste is quite malty with some caramel malts coming in to play, and the finish is a bit dry and hoppy. The mouthfeel is nice, and the drinkability is good as well. A decent brew for Weyerbacher, but not that good compared to other Fall brews and O-Fests!"
"The taste comes on strong with a bracing and welcoming wave of malty nuttiness. I LOVE the way that nuttiness bounces around in my mouth. The flavor reveals very little hops, which I don't mind. The tingling and the flavor coalesce onto the center of my tongue. I want to say it ""reluctantly fades," but I'm the one who's reluctant. I'm left very eager for another swig. This is one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, and definitely my favorite fall beer."
"I hope I just got a really bad bottle, because otherwise this beer is not good . Some of Weyerbacher's beers can be quite good, so this isn't a brewery-wide problem. If this is a bad batch, then maybe I can have another, but for now, I won't."
"Deep amber/copper appearance with a fizzy, bubbly head with no retention nor lacing. Fruity esters and sweet malt along with notes of spiced apple, earthy hops and a hint of alcohol proliferate in the aroma. Toasted and nutty malt flavors, paired with apricot fruit notes open up as the beer comes to room temperature. A doughy, spiced apple pie character appears, as well, with a consistent, though mild, hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel at times seems thin, and perhaps not quite as full and round as it could be. Quite drinkable, but seems to missing something overall. Not really specific to any particular style, however, this is a pretty decent brew from Weyerbacher."
"This one poured out a bright and attractive amber brown color. The head thinned out quickly and became a film, leaving a sticky lace on the glass. Theres something similar to sour cherries in the aroma. I notice this similarity in their other beers. Maybe its the yeast they use, or their water, but it is distinctive to most of the beers I have tried from them. The taste is somewhat spicy with a pleasant nutty malt texture. I also detected some fruit in there, too. A flavorful and easy to drink seasonal ale, that might just be my favorite from this brewer."
"This is one of the better Oktoberfest style beers that I have had this year thus far. It's an amber/orangey color with a creamy colored head. The head was big and lasted a while, but then died down to a laceing. The smell had some caramel, fruits, nuts, some hops, and malts. You could also smell a little bit of alcohol. The taste was quite similar to the smell, but had more elements of roasted malts and such. I also got a little hint of metal in the mix, but nothing too strong. It was rather light and refreashing, so I think I probably will have to get some more. Kudos to Weyerbacher. on this one."
"Dark copper color, slightly hazy, topped by a modest cream hed that fades to a light film. Aroma is very earthy with good toasted malt. Flavor is good, exhibiting a strong roasted componenet coupled with a slight citrus note. Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Overall, a decent brew, but definitely average in the realm of fest brews."
"Zum wohl!"
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: Reddish-amber color with a medium thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Weak malt and caramel aroma. Thin-to-medium body with a sweet malt flavor, along with a light hops presence lingering around. I thought this would be a little more robust given the ABV. The finish is mostly malty with a little fruit and hops thrown in. Barely average overall."
"Medium-dark copper/amber color, with a very small off-white head that recedes to a small ring, leaving a bit of lace. Aroma is sweet, some fruitiness and caramel, with a hint of hops in the back. Flavor is of sweet malts and some fruitiness, ending with a minimal hop presence. Medium body, medium carbonation. Nothing super exciting, but decent."
"Really, this is like a thin barleywine. I'm ok with that. Probably won't score points for authentic Marzen qualities, though."
"This may go down as one of the sweeter fall seasonals I have tried. Brownish pour with a thin off-white head. The nose precedes the flavors exactly: caramel and a huge malt profile. Starts off with a range of toasted malt flavors, and finishes on the sweet side with notes of caramel and toffee. To me this is one of the more interesting and unique Oktobers around. I would definitely have this one again."
"2003 version, pours an amber ruby brown very rich looking with a rather thin tan head, leaving uneven lacing to my glass. Aroma contains caramel and roasted nut tones brought through from the use of vienna malts, light underlying fruit tones and a timid hop aroma. Taste consists of a bready mixture of mild spices, toasted nut, all drizzled in an caramelized apple syrup. Mouthfeel is a bit thin in body, but it's carbonation is solid. Overall a decent attempt to emulate a great style like an Oktoberfest/Marzen however this is brewed like an ale still solid and will hit the spot this fall just not that great especially when compared to authentic O fests out there."
"I know that 'pretty' isn't an adjective usually associated with beer, but that's the first word that came to mind as soon as I poured it into a glass. The color is a clear reddish amber and while the head fades fairly quickly, it leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The smell oddly reminds me a lot of a German Pilsner such as Warsteiner. The taste is pleasant and fresh, with a rich roundness that gives it a little weight. I found this to be lighter than other Fall and Oktoberfest beers that I've tried, which might not be a bad thing!"
"I enjoyed it, but not as much as some of their other beers."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy medium yellow/orange color with a medium tan largish head. The mouthfeel is firm. The smell is a pleasing breadlike sweetness with a very faint hoppiness. The taste is a pleasant rounded sweet bread with mild increasing bitterness. Although this is not a true Octoberfest since it is an ale, it still tastes pretty similar to style and better than some I have had. Quite drinkable"
"Not a real Oktoberfest beer since it is top fermemted ( an ale ) that is not as smooth due to its time less spent in lagering. It is slighly oily with a pungent aftertaste, though it is fairly light and not filling. It can be a drinkable beer depending on the time and temperature outdoors."

"This beer poured into the glass amber that looked rather sharp in the light. The head was an off white in color that did not last long. There seemed to be very little lace to none at all. The aroma was almost non-existent. Slight hops, malt and spices. The taste was just there. It had a prominent perfume flavor. Some malt and hop bit but if it was not perfume it would have hardly no taste. Sorry, maybe it was the bottle I got , but not a good beer except the color."
"Red amber body supports a big fizzy but rapidly decaying head. Nose is nuts and malty sweetness, with some chocolate notes. Taste has some caramel, some chocolate, and a surprising dash of herbal hops. Carbonation adds a wholeness to the mouthfeel, making it full, but not syrupy. Makes for easy drinking. I'm not sure this is a true marzen. I think it is an Octoberfest ale, particularly since I can't at this moment think of another lager by Weyerbacher. The finish is nice, but not lager-like clean. Whatever the case, it is a fine autumn seasonal."
"Malt/nut nose.  Light tan colored head.  Deep mahogany colored.  The head is rich and lasting.  Medium mouth but not very smooth or rich.  Taste is quite watery, there is a slight flavor of roast malt and a trace of hop in the finish.  The flavors are faint at best.  From the look and the smell... the taste disapoints."
"Medium fine foamy yellow-tinted cap. Reddish amber with gold highlights. The first sip of this non-Oktoberfest Oktoberfest beer was on the sour side. The sourness never really went away, but it became a welcome part of the beer helping to dry things out in the end. Semi-sweet but fruity malt dont stand a chance against the one-two hops-sourness whollops. Its not sour in the off-tasting kinda way, but rather a subtle, berry-like manner. Anyway, this proved to be a good, refreshing beer that is very unique. One of my favorite autumn beers."
"Pours a dark amber color with a big, somewhat off-white head.  Aroma is very malty, with whiffs of floral hops.  Taste is sweet and nutty.  Terrific balance between the predominance of malt and more-than-expected hoppiness.  Its full, textured, and delicious.  A little more hoppy than other beers in the style, but its a refreshing and interesting beer.  Its absolutely worth picking up again."
"This pours with a nice light tan head over medium amber liquid. Lots of toasted malt in the nose, malt sugars also. Taste is a nice blend of biscuity maltiness, lightly roasted/toasted malts & a strong hop presence...nicely done though. Finish is nice, sweetness mixing with the hoppiness that ends up taking center stage. Not a traditional take on the style, but rather a nicely done Octoberfest ale."
"Pours a clear copper-amber color, with a thin off-white head. On the nose the aroma is malty sweet. On the palate the flavor consists of hints of Vienna & Munich malt, slight roastiness, smooth mouth feel, slight fruitiness,slight caramel, slight toastiness, more flavorful as it warms a bit. Overall this was a good Ofest with an american twist on it...Autumn Fest..."
