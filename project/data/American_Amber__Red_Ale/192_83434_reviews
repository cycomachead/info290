"As promised, Red Hoptober is a well hoped red ale that has a beautiful appearance. The only downside to this gem of a beer is that on a clean palate, the finish will start to turn slightly caustic at the end. Otherwise, the flavors, mouthfeel, and smell jive well to form a very delicious brew. One of my favorite red ales, I hope to get some more this coming fall. Now that I go to CSU, hopefully I can get is straight from the brewery!"

"o: an interesting beer that pulls off a nice complexity between hop and malt while not overwhelming, instead maintaining great balance"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep red with a nice foamy slightly off white head. Smells of deep caramelized malt with chocolate and slight floral aroma. Tastes of slight chocolate with nice piney/earthy hop bite. The malt dominates at first, then the hops take over. Beer is carbonated fine and for a light/medium body, it goes down very smooth, could definately see throwing a couple of these back in a short time. Overall, a very good beer."

"Somewhat watery start transitions to a warming and medium-to-full body. Lightish effervescence is reminiscent of an IPA as is the hop note though both are reduced versions thankfully. A nice brew overall but hoppier than I prefer most of the time."

"A beautiful day in mid autumn called for this diverse tasting. We started with this Red Hoptober Ale. Very flavorfull. a beautiful pour. This beer from New Belgium Brewery was a perfect beer to start the evening. Nice red coloring with a bright head. smooth with a slight citrus ending. 6.0 abv"
""
""
"Taste-Big piney hopwave followed by spicy, toasted malt backbone. Not sure what ""Eldorado"" hops are but are in use here according to the label, and they work out very nicely, providing a flavorfull piney aspect that complements the spicy malt very well. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at La Jolla Brew House. First draft beer of 2013 so I made sure it wasn't memorable."
""
""
"I loved the original Hoptober....so it is no surprise that I like the amber version. The beer pours a clear amber with finger and a half froathy slightly off white head that is leaving a lace. The smell is malty with a slight pine hop kick. The taste is a very nicely balanced hoppy red. Starts malty then there is a kick of piney slight citrus hop followed by bittering hops that clean the pallete. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and I could drink the heck out of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good stuff. On the hoppy side for the style."
""
""
""
"O- no complaints other than the aftertaste that just seems to grow. Would definitely drink again, and most likely will end up trying again simply due to the best by date on this bottle was the week before I bought it, and two weeks before I tried it."

"O: Solid brew - definitely lives up to the ""hoptober"" name. I wouldn't be knocking down doors to get this again, but I'd definitely drink it again."
""
""
""
""
"Really, really good. Solid amber, with the right balance of malt and hop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a good one. Want a dark amber ale, but you also want an IPA? This is perfect. Well balanced, hop and malt flavor are extremely well thought out and executed very well. Drinkability is also really high, 3-5 bottles of this would not be a problem for a Friday or Saturday night session."
""
""
"Overall: Very nice beer and happy my brother brought this back for me to enjoy in Boston."
""
""
""
""
"A reddish brown in color with a thin tan head. Strong grassy, piney, herbal aroma. Taste was a bit of dark caramel up front, followed by some big grassy, herbal flavors. Mouthfeel was good. Overall a good red ale that I would get again. Probably the hoppiest offering I have had from NB."
""
"A good malty, hoppy beer with plenty of flavor and body."
""
"O- Above average. Does a good job not being too overpowering with hops."
"	Overall Impression: this is a great beer, just what you want in the fall; it's a mild pale ale that goes down smooth; very attractive beer, something I'd really like to drink (and keep drinking!); the nut and the fire-roasty flavors at the beginning and the end are just right; a very worth while beer and a good one to sip with a pal; I think my favorite part is the nutty transitioning into the hoppy flavor...that's just excellent"
"O- This is a great beer. Wish I bought more then just a single."
"This brew is a mess. A total turn off with too many random flavors/aromas. I can't recommend this, it didn't end up in my drain, but it's certainly one you drink fast; not in a good way."
""
"In some respects it seems unfair to review this because I love Fat Tire so much. This brew resembles Fat Tire in its distinguishable maltiness but has a nice hint of citrus hops at the very end. Poured with a nice one finger creamy head it had significant lacing. Ruby colored, it had the scent of floral hoppiness but not the typical ""biscuit"" of Fat Tire. The flavor is of quality malt with a hop ending. Flavorful and full bodied it was a joy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"The hunt is over... ...ahem...sorry. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet toffee, sharp pine needle, miscellaneous greens, and light leek. There may or may not be some mint in the background, but I can't tell for sure. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the mint does, in fact, come through in the midst of the pine. The hops clash amongst themselves while also clashing with the toffee. Not sure how they pulled that off, but I'm considering giving some reluctant props... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, I feel the hops and malts just don't cooperate well enough in this beer to allow me to enjoy it. Something like that."
"o - overall nice twist on an amber and makes it a better beer. Quite enjoyable."
""
""
"This offering pours up a deep copper, amost bronze color with a nice khaki head. There is decent retention and world class lacing (if there is such a thing.) The nose is floral, grass, nuts, and biscuit. Taste is very dry with the hop profile dominating the flavor. I also get a bit of citrus fruit upfront. Mouthfeel is okay with decent carbonation and a not completely unpleasant aftertaste. I'd probably drink this again, but I wouldn't actively search for it. But it's not bad, especially if you prefer a dry finish."

"Overall a nice addition to the NBB lineup. My brother and i shared several bottles at a recent tailgate and he thoroughly enjoyed the brew. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- This beer caught me off guard as to what I was expecting and at first I was very hesitant to enjoy it. I think it is a very good beer and definitely very drinkable. I hope to see it next season."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance has a dark ruby red color supporting a healthy head giving way to fair lace. Smell has a nice balance of hops and malts with aromas of citrus and caramel malts. Taste holds a helping of hops giving way to citrusy grapefruit, but not overpowering the malt. Mouthfeel is medium light with good carbonation. Overall a very nice fall seasonal."
""
""
""
"O-a decent amber ale, but depth of flavor not as prevalent as others"
"O- This is what I consider to be a great seasonal beer. It is not extreme, it is not incredible. It is just very drinkable for the fall season. It is a bit different than most of the others out there, in that there are at least initially some noticeable hops. I plan to drink a few more of these before they are gone this year."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thick, long lasting tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is quite strong, definitely some earthy notes, dark fruit, slight alcohol, and a little yeast. Taste is bitter right up front. Earthy, piney, bitterness, wonderful fall hop character. Slightly sweet tasting. Medium carbonation and a medium body. This beer has a lingering bite to the finish, and is slightly resin like in the mouthfeel. An excellent dark pale fall style for sure, I definitely recommend giving this beer a try."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best before Nov. 11, 12. This pours a nice reddish amber color with a large odd white head with good retention and leaves a lacing. The smells are a nice bit of hops, and caramel. The feel is medium. The taste is good nice amount of hops and caramel malts."
"Poured a deep amber with a tan head and swell lacing. Consistently pleasing. . . smell is of a malt base with hop resin, citrus, spices, and grass floating on top. Taste is hoppier than expected from the style, with a bready base layered with lots of grassy and piney overtones. Smooth mouthfeel with an ideal level of carbonation. Well enjoyed."

"Smells of musty and earthy hopping but mostly of herbal tea-like hop spectrum over the top of toasted bread slices. The flavor has these elements but also includes pine and grapefruit pith at a medium-light level, and some light toasted nut flavors join the party as the glass warms up. Its a good interplay between the nuttiness, the toasted bread, and the somewhat higher than usual hopping for an amber (It easily crosses the line into typical PA hopping strength.) Check this one out if you like the notion of mostly herbal hopping on toasted bread malts as the central focus for a sessionable ABV beer."
""
""
""
"Served on tap at Lucky Monk. Appearance is clear and dark red with a thin layer of tan head. Copious amounts of sticky lacing and decent head retention are present. Aroma is freh and hoppy with a huge dose of cascade hops. Relatively one note on the nose, grapefruit and pine make up the hop profile. The taste is rather hoppy as well with a decent presence of caramel an amber malt. Fairly bitter by the mid palate with an earthy finish. Mouthfeel is medium with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this is nice and fresh and quite tasty. This is a little more drinkable than ranger, well made brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly tasty brew with some nice mild to medium hop presence and decent roasted flavors."
""
"New Belgium generally produces decent beers but this one is a nice surprise; a bit outside the box but well worth trying."
""
"Overall- I received a sixer of this as a gift. Drinkable but I wouldn't but it myself. This beer makes me think of a toned down IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Its actually probably best described as what you might get if you blended Fat Tire with Jubelale."
"Poured this Red Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear reddish amber color, produced a thick off white head, featured excellent retention and left ample lacing on the glass. The ""hoppiest"" smelling Red Ale I have come across, pine and citric notes. Medium in body, this is an excellent example of the Red Ale style....Most red ale's are sort of boring, not much sets them apart, however this ale had such a strong hop flavor. A based of malted grain, citrus and pine throughout the session. Well balanced, great take on an ordinary style."
""
"One of the better examples of this style of beer. Hop-forward, but still well balanced with the malts. Something that's easy to get through a 6-pack of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: One of best, if not the best, from New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a hoppy, aromatic red ale that is easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear brown-copper with a short, sticky caramel-colored head. Roasted smoky malt and grapefruit aromas. The moutfheel is a little thin and wet with some scrubbing toward the end and a powdery finish. This is a Porter meets Calofornia Pale Ale. Coffee up front with floral and citrus hops being picked up in that order. There are some interesting things going on with this one. Otherwise, it's average."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a great beer, the name justifies it, very good fall blend. Great buy."
""
""
""
"O-A surprisingly good beer. Wasn't expecting much but this beer was good."
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't expecting too much from this beer because of the style, but I was pleasantly surprised. So much flavor for an amber, and I'm glad I got to enjoy a whole 22oz of it. Consider me impressed. I hope this makes a return next fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite outstanding, but solid overall with almost perfect balance. Definitely tastes like fall."
"Overall: This is a light IPA that has been carefully balanced with some darker malts achieving a killer session brew. This is a highly recommended seasonal by me, and it is my favorite New Belgium beer to date."
""
""
"This is a great, world class beer. I love it."
""
""
"This is a nice alternative to the Octoberfest lagers abundant this time of year. This one is definitely hop driven but the malt and roast flavor keep this one balanced and somewhat quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pleasant surprise for me from New Belgium, being a well hopped yet balanced and smooth take on an American Amber Ale that had a really solid flavor and drinkability to it. I’ll be investing in a six pack next time."
"High C+"
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I dont normally like Ambers/Reds and this kicks the shit out of Fat Tire. i could drink a few of these and be pretty happy actually."
""
""
"T: A good blend of caramel malts, earthy hops, pepper, campfire and some faint citrus. A really nice beer that grows on you the more you drink."
""
"O: Wow, I didn't expect to be this pleased. Very tasty, perhaps complex brew from New Belgium. Favorite part is that there are many flavors to choose from, yet nothing seems out of control. I would say that this is a great beer for the summer with friends, but I like it on the warmer end. I would recommend and buy again. A great season/regular beer. Savor Good Beer!"
"Above-average Amber Ale with a little extra hop kick. Not as hoppy as other hoppy Ambers such as Hop Head Red or Levitation. Easy drinkin’."
""
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, caramel, caramel hop, earth, and earth hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutty, caramel, bread, caramel hop, earth, and earth hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I really wasn’t overly impressed with this one if I am honest. I had heard a lot of good things from other friends that it was one of the best from the style that they had to date. I dunno if I should listen to these people anymore. There were a lot of nice flavors going on here for the style, however, everything just clashed on your palate all at once and there was no chance to ever really recover from it. Hate that was the case. Worth trying at least once, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to do so again."
""
"O: I'm always scared of hop full beers as some hops when used fpr flavoring have a long lingering taste, this however while has a very noticable hop taste the taste fades rather than staying strong for many mins after your last sip. Bitternes levels ballance the malt and body well.. So oberall this is a good fall beer that seems to fit the season perfectly."
""
""
""
"A nice effort, I would this again especially at $8 a sixer"
""
"Overall impression - A good tasting beer that could stand to have a more ample body."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. Closer to the porter style than the typical fall seasonal, but a very enjoyable beer for the season just the same."
""
"Overall: A pretty nice hopped up red ale. Ripe mix of hops with a good taste of caramel and subtle roast."
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel and very drinkable. Nothing to write home about but a solid fall offering with some hops to boot."
""
""
""
""
"O: very pleasing sipper, good for a game day with snacks"
"Overall- Very interesting beer with a great take on the season it is released."
""
"Overall: this cames across as a strange flavor profile to me, but a bit different for a red ale."
"I took a flyer on this one not knowing anything about it when I picked it up, but I'll definitely get some more. It is a well balanced, delightful pleasure."
""
""
"O: Just a nice beer that goes well with the season. Its easy to drink and goes down with ease. I much prefer this over the last years Hoptober."
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 12/23/2012. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, grapefruit, citrus zest, herbal, floral, and pine. Very nice aromas with nice balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, grapefruit, pine, orange zest, grass, floral, nuttiness, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, pine, grapefruit, toast, floral, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Great hop/malt balance; with nice flavor complexity and balance. No cloying flavors at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. Great hop and malt profile; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one, and it is a very nice style example."
""
""
"My first New Belgium, and I am impressed. Had on tap at Brasserie Brightwell in Easton, MD. Pours a very dark reddish brown, with slight off white head. Nice aroma that prepares for an exceptionally smooth sip, with caramel malts, hints of roast, spice, and some earthy bite. The flavor follows with sweet malts and balancing spice, biscuts, toffee, nicely light bitter finish. Finishes very clean for the style, and keeps you wanting more."
""
"The mouth is decent with a bit of heft off-set by active carbonation. Very easy to drink several and it goes great with food. I liked the $3 price on Thirsty Thursdays. That is a deal for a beer this good!"
""
""
""
""
"A beautiful pour, huge frothy tan head over a bold, deep amber-dark brown color. Very inviting. Aroma is filled with fresh hops, mainly piney, with toasty and herbal notes and a whiff of ester and sweet fruit. The taste gives a nice back and forth - quite balanced- between hoppy bite and fruity sweetness. I detected what I would describe as a chocolate-cherry taste among the other flavors breaking through. Nice body with a clean, fresh flavor and a dry finish. Good one."
""
""
""
"O What an excellent beer for any season. I have had it on tap and in bottle. Really good. New Belgium scores with this one! I feel 2012 is much better than 2011."
""
""
"Pretty good brew. Reminds me of their classic Hoptober offering but with a darker malt component. Nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: As a fall seasonal brew, this is about as good as it gets outside of Pumpkin Ales and Octoberfests."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is great for the style. Almost blurs the line between amber ale and IPA."
""
""
"overall i am quite impressed with this fall seasonal that seems to successfully capture the essence of autumn in a bottle. what's unique about this offering is that without being an o-fest or pumpkin ale, red hoptober delivers the fall and early winter personality in a bottle like no other concoction sampled before. definitely a winner and deserving of praise."
"Definately a solid red ale that is a good change of pace to the typical Oktoberfest and horrible Pumpkin beers."
"I enjoyed it."
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Red Hoptober is a deep bronze-red color with a dense yet airy head that leaves sticky gobs of lacing on the walls of the glass. Smell is a mix of spicey hops and caramel malt. Flavor is initially dominated by the hops; floral and spicy, transitioning to slighly malty sweet and finishes amazingly neutral and clean for a beer with that kind of hop flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a thick but inactive carbonation. Overall I must say that I am very pleasantly surprised with this, definitely a new favorite from NB."
""
""
""
"I am impressed. For some reason, I went into this expecting a marzen style, and was shocked bt the initial sip. After actually reading the bottle, I sipped again, now opening myself up to whatever they want there. This is a delightful beer. Deep aroma that hits you on the nose with spicyness, a deep amber coloring and a full body, Red Hoptober has made me a fan of New Belguim in one beer. Well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a filmy off-white head. The aroma is strong with a caramel scent dominating with some piney hops along with a hint of tangerine and sugar. It tastes more hoppy than the smell. There is a nice piney base with some sweet toasty malt and a nice finish with some fruity flavors. The beer is light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Very nice beer here."
"Overall - A very good amber. Nicely hopped to compliment a rich, malty backbone. More assertive than your average amber."
""
""
"O- Nice fall seasonal. Maybe even more deserving of a full-on cool fall day. Almost more of an American nut brown sort of beer. Nicely balanced and an easy drinker. Appropriately priced ($3 on sale, $4 regular) per 22 oz."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of New Belgium's more solid offerings. Extremely enjoyable and truly drinkable."
"O- It almost seems like New Belgium can't go wrong. This new fall seasonal is worth trying if you're looking for a hoppy, malty, red ale. Seems perfect for the changing season."
"Nice medium bodied beer, very drinkable and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Fantastic beer that's nicely complex. I love how the taste evolved. Drinking this beer is a certainly a wonderful experience."
""
""
"Malt, brown sugar, and darker barleys are the predominant flavors. Cascade hops during the drink, Eldorado on the finish and beltch. Very well balanced hoppieness, clear and present hop flavor without being excessively bitter."
""
"I worked my way through a six pack of this during the last month and have gotten into it more as the weather cooled. My biggest problem is that they replaced the golden hoptober with this. I would have rather enjoyed the regular hoptober in late summer early fall and enjoyed this ale in the late autumn early winter but its their brewery. I'll probably enjoy another sixer of this before its gone."

"*from notes 8.28.12"

""
""
"D - Very sessionable."
""
""
""
"O - Nice hoppines to this amber. Well balanced and very enjoyable. For a late summer / fall summer seasonal, this absolutely stands out."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a very good beer, it's not the best example of a Red Ale, it's got more Brown Ale aspects, but I would say that it's a very good example of a Fall seasonal beer. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth and the flavors did a really great job at holding my attention, I think one bomber would be enough for me, but I wouldn't say two would be impossible. What I liked most about this beer was the great taste and aroma, I really like how the hops contrast the toasted malts. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation was a little to high, but that seemed to be the only thing that didn't work that well with this beer. I would buy this beer again, in fact I already went back and got three more bottles before they jacked up the price, I highly recommend this beer to jut about anyone. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it turned out to be the best out of the four bombers released in Michigan by New Belgium and so far it's my favorite Fall seasonal of the year, good job New Belgium, this is one great Fall time beer."
"Overall I am impressed with this beer. This beer intrigues me because of it's mixed beer style pedigree which is evident in the taste. It's like someone took red ale and an IPA and forced them to have a love child. There's also something about the taste that is just really distinct and very delicious. The taste is complex. Bitter at the start, but not too much. Then as it hits the back of the tongue, the sweetness and caramel flavor just comes through. Great beer."

"Very happy that I picked up a couple of this seasonal. A nice change from the octoberfests and pumpkins brews that everyone is putting out."

"22oz bottle, pours a deep, deep red, nearly brown, nice tall, frothy off-white head holds good retention and leaves killer lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty, caramel, citric hop (hop pellet-like), bready, biscuity. Tastes are bready, caramely, biscuity, spicy hop, crisp, fresh, and again that pellet hop characteristic, somewhat grassy and fresh. Thinner bodied, god carbonation, finishes clean. Overall, I liked this one, but maybe it could have used another week or 2 in the bottle. I've never had a beer where the hops smell and taste like hop pellets. Not that it's a bad thing, just different. I'll probably pick up another one of these before the season is gone, especially at $3.49 a bomber!"
""
""
""
""
""
"I was a little disappointed that they didn't bring back the Hoptober from last year but I was hoping this would be good too. Reddish amber color, good lacing. Smell is malts, maybe a hint of coffee (I sometimes get that from red ales), hints of grassy hops. Flavor is alternating between grassy hops, melon rind, and chewy malt. i think the old Hoptober was better but this was alright."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, heavily steeped tea-like color; dark in the shadows, deep umber in light, and its darkness makes me fear this one might be a malt-bomb too. (And actually now that I think of it, I'm not really sure often what looks good and what LOOKS good; kinda maybe because most beer looks good to me anyway, when you think of it.) Smell is a bit malt and caramel and sweet and hops...synthetic like notes (not bad either) but overall all its scent is muted surely. Tastes great, whew! Good balance on the grains, and not bombed out on the sweetness or the malt and coffee, and nice hops...I get the centennial for sure, and it seems to dominate, the others hidden below. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation is active and fussy and refreshing, and not chewy or boggy or anything. I really like this! And it could be because it's Friday eve too. Either way, I'll buy again."
"O - This is a really nice, tasty brew that reminds me more of winter than fall. I really enjoyed it's warming flavors of cocoa, and bark. The appearance couldn't really be much better either. Just a great beer from New Belgium Brewing, and I would definitely buy another six pack. Cheers!"
"o: Full flavor, looks great, not overbearing, great beer."
"Poured into a standard pint a rich clear amber/bronze with a two finger sticky slightly off white crown atop that never completely settles ,a thick frothy mass is left.Sharp piney hops come out well after the pour along with underlying biscuit malt,the hop aromas did fade quite a bit after the pour but after a good swirl they come out.Pretty dry on the palate except for a small amount of brown sugar flavor,the hops are not nearly as big as in the nose but they meld with the crisp dryer slightly roasted malt base.It's got some good things going on,it's not an overly complex or a ""wowing"" beer but it's not bad."

"O-very nice to try, but the taste does not live up to its nose and look predecessors."
""

"and tasty varieties look forward to. Very drinkable seasonal Hoppy Red Ale. I think I'll have another!"

"O: Nothing super special, however again like with the Tripel from New Belgium (and in this case a better example) it is a good example of the style for the price."

"Quarter Inch thin lightly lacy short lived off white light tan head. Clear rich ruby red deep bright color. Mildly roasted hop front.Toasted caramel medium light textured minimally sweet toasted malt fruit ester hint body. Dry mildly bitter end. Rich Crisp Odd Red Ale."

"22 oZ bottle. Rather dark red color with a full hops flavor. I like the hops flavor in beer but feel many craft brewers are just adding more and more hops to make an impresssion. That is not the case with this brew. Just found this here in Michigan and enjoyed it very much."

"A beautifully dark amber with a big khaki head. Better lacing would have give appearance a 5 for sure. A thickly sweet and floral aroma of some caramel, a hint of some coffee, bread, and earthy florals from the dry hops. Taste followed suit; floral and a touch bitter from the hops, the big, thick caramel malt belly offer of a dose of some toffee, coffee, and bread. The more I drink of this the more the sweet syrupy and rather chewy base of this beer does show itself. A full body on this one with enough activity to give it some life but not enough to properly counter the chewiness of it. Right now in the warmth of the closing summer it is a bit too heavy, come fall it might hit the spot. Overall, another nice surprise from New Blegium, though maybe I shouldn't be so surprised at this point as I have enjoyed each of their last 3 seasonals (Dig, Somersault, and now this). This is definitely more of a Fall beer than a late summer beer, as NB claims this to also be. It's heavy and sweet and will go much better with the drop in weather and shortening of the days."

"This isn't a bad beer but it's definitely not the regular Hoptober that I miss so much. This is roasty and nutty but also very hoppy. I'm not disappointed at all. I will probably try this again."
"Overall a tasty beer. Tried it because this was in the slot where Belgo usually is at Vons."

"Overall, a very solid amber. Somewhat complex, plenty flavorful, but really easy to drink. Nice offering from New Belgium who seems to constantly be tinkering with/changing their seasonals."
"D: Another nice new offering from NB. Above average and enjoyable. Slightly unique from the standard American Amber style with some light nutty chocolate roast notes and a good dose of hops."
"A lovely sip, uh ... I mean quaff. No doubt one of the better fall seasonals out there, a must try IMO."

"Good beer overall, but still not quite what I would picture an amber/red ale."

"O – This is a really nice amber ale. It’s tasty, drinkable, and fits the style. I’m not entirely sure how I feel about it being a fall seasonal, but I guess it fits the bill as it has a decent amount of toasty malt. In the heart of autumn, I’d rather reach for a pumpkin ale or an Oktoberfest beer, but this beer certainly works well in the transitional period between summer and fall. Bottom line: this is a solid beer from New Belgium."
"O: Reminds me of Fat Tire with more hops and black ale leanings. I don’t think I’d buy it again, but it was interesting while it was still in my glass. Not surprisingly, of course, it went quick."

"O- a nice brew tasty now and tasty later in the fall this is a winner for NB"
"O - An excellent example of a hoppy fall beer. It is easy to get carried away with the German malts at this time of year, so this is a nice change of pace."
"Taste is a melding of roasty malt tones with bitter hops smack at the finish. An unusual collision of styles, and not a bad beer by any means, but Red Hoptober is not my favorite of New Belgium's seasonals."
"After a few sips, the mouthfeel is still somewhat malty but the aftertaste is unmistakebly hoppy bitterness. Not much nose to this one beside a hint of ester - part floral part fruity. Nice bold red color although the relative humidity in Austin this time of year fogs up the glass pretty good and I was sitting indoors so my assessment of its appearance may be a tad inaccurate."
""
"O - I fully enjoyed this brew. My first instinct when I hear of red ales are more malt forward beers but it seems I am fooled many a time. This beer seems to have a emphasis on hops but in that I did expect a little more body to stay balanced. This beer was great, but it could have used more malt depth. The hops did come through very bright and distinguishable."
"Overall: Actually, it's not a bad little beer at all. Not at all."
"Not a bad beer, just not my preference for this season. I do not find balance in this one."
""
"Overall: great fall-time red ale. Great color. Aroma and flavor are balanced well between malty and hoppy. Great beer"
""
"Overall a nice summer-into-fall type of beer. Worth a try if you like Fat Tire and 1554."
"like a more hoppy 90 shilling, this is a big improvement from the hoptober golden ale that was around last year. it pours perfect autumn amber color, deep deep copper, with a tan head an inch or so high. smells like a fresh hopped odell 90 shilling. its got the same malt profile, english and caramely. the hops though take the taste over, bitter and well selected. the red malts arent as prominent as i thought they would be, but they balance the intense hops pretty well. its like a dark ipa that isnt quite a black beer. feel is good, fuller body and smooth to drink. id have a few of these, but they get a little filling. overall a nice upgrade to the new belgium fall offering."
""
""
"The BJCP style guidelines refer to this style as ""an American pale ale with more body, more caramel richness, and a balance more towards malt than hops."" This brew pulls that off nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nicely balanced ale that straddles the line between a Red Ale and a Black Ale. I like this a lot better than the previous standard Hoptober."
"The body was OK, but on the thinnish side for the style. Drinkability was OK, but that will depend on your taste for the peat/roast taste. Overall, an OK beer, one I'm glad I tried, but I'm not sure I'll have another."
"Hoppy red ale is one of my beer styles. Love their red colour, their rich toffee and slight roast malt character and their abundance of hops. Red Hoptober delivers all of these attributes in spades. Looks red, okay, criteria number one delivered. Smells of pungent pine, pithy citrus and toffee. A strong nose and something New Belgium seems to pull off very well. Sometimes though I feel like NB beer tends to fall short of what the aroma promises flavour wise when it comes to their hop centric beers. Not Red Hoptober. Sweet citrus fruit hits first, followed by toffee and slight roast. Ample hop bitterness finishes the swollow. All in all very pleasing. Like I said, I'm fond of hoppy reds and this one shines."
"This is good though I don't see myself buying more. Good doesn't always equate to great drinkability.;^("
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I won't buy a six-pack of it, but I'd encourage a friend to try a pint."
""
"O - OK I'm biased. I do like just about everything NB produces and I also seem to like every fall seasonal I try. Perhaps the deck and the cool air are working their magic. This one will only be with us for a short time so let's enjoy it while we can."
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong earthy malt, citrus hops, slight dry hop, and a hint of sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong earthy malt, slight sweet malt, and slight hop. Overall, great appearance, good feel, and good blend."
"Comes out of the tap a clear, ruby-tinged copper with a thick, pale tan head that sticks around for a while and leaves very generous lacing. Malty aroma has a hoppy hay overtone and a firm earthy note. Malty, earthy flavor has hoppy and clove notes - it’s a little like drinking good mulch, but I mean that in a positive way. Body is only average, but fizz is strong and lively. Finish is woody but not bitter. Another winner from New Belgium."
""
"Overall a really good beer. I like New Belgium products as a rule but this one is quite good. It's good from a bottle but much better on draft."
""
"From what I gathered, this one was the original Hoptober with a bigger malt bill and some interesting bittering hops added. It definitely had a little more substance than it’s stripped down counterpart; yet another solid seasonal from New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like it. For a fall seasonal, it really does deliver in that I get more malt and heft, but I still get those hops I love too. Rather than just make another hoppy ale and call it a fall seasonal, I’m glad they truly amped up the malts. A bit filling, so two would probably be my max in an evening."
"Just drink it cold. As it warmed I felt it becoming a little too thick."
"Beautiful looking beer and the hoppy aroma is downright sublime, but I didn't think this beer finished well. I would mirror a lot of other's observations that it has a bit of an earthy aroma and flavor, but just a bit too strong of an aftertaste for my liking. Overall, solid beer though. New Belgium and I have a love-hate relationship; I can't stand Fat Tire, but the winter ale they put out this winter was/is one of my favorite beers, so I figured this was worth a try."
""
"The only problem is that it feels very fizzy and watery on the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Feels dry, medium body, and leaves the palate fuzzy if you know what I mean."
"Overall, a really good fall seasonal in my opinion. It is something unique and is really quite drinkable. Definitely worth picking up."
""

"O) Highly enjoyable seasonal offering right here. I really enjoy amber ales that incorporate more hops. This one is more pine and floral than citrus, but it works well. Glad to recommend this one..."

"4/3/3.5/3.5/3"

"Carbonation is somewhere between low and medium with a lighter body than expected. It's a smooth drink and makes me want more."
"Good job, New Belgium."
"Was surprised at how little I enjoyed this beer. I just couldn't get over the musty smell. It was something like furniture polish! The taste was similar. I'm not sure if I just got a bad batch or what, as I think New Belgium usually makes solid beers."
""
""
"I- overall a nice beer but like too many hoppy beers not nice enough to have me prefer over a Victory or even a Sierra Nevada."
"O- very nice. When I cracked the bottle all I smelt was hops. Then I poured it and everything mixed together well. A brew with excellent balance but a strong flavor in each the hop and grain profile. It is a beer that is fit for a beer geek as the different flavors come one after another."
"Overall: The definition of a 4.0 beer in my opinion. As stated before I don't like red ales that much, but I do LOVE New Belgium and feel like I often may over-rate their releases. This time I feel I'm being subjectively fair and giving it exactly what it deserves. This is a great beer for the price (6.99-8.99 per 6 pack) and I recommend it for anyone who likes Ales of any type. GOOD STUFF!"

"Body is right on....great drinker....a lot of flavor to this red ale.."
""
"Not bad but was hoping for more from these guys."
""
"Overall, it's OK and has some decent bitterness. I personally don't care for the biscuity malts or the hop flavors though."
""
""
"O - Not really a fan of Red Ales but this one is alright with me. Pretty much my favorite so far. It for sure the most attractive."
""
""
""
""
""
"O= a grand new addition!"
"4.0 D: Tasty beer. I like big toastiness in my ambers, so this hit the spot with regard to that. Solid all around."
""
"Overall, you won't find a dull moment with this dark, rich, complex brew. Very satisfying. Glad I tried it."
"The burnt umber colored body was clear, and topped by a two finger thick, foamy, beige head. I could smell the bright hops even before bringing the glass up to the nose. Once I did, the nose was dominated by piney, earthy, spicy, and musty hops. As anticipated, the taste was quite bitter and earthy, with a flash of brown sugar mid palette, and a carbonated, drying, finish. The body felt medium thick, oily, and soft. This is better than the typical New Belgium seasonal, and approaches the quality of the Lips of Faith series."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice enough red ale, though I would have liked a bit more hop character to come through. It's not bad tasting, it just never gets really interesting. It does seem a bit like a beefed up Fat Tire, a solid drinking beer, but nothing to make you say wow."
""
""
"O - Seasonal releases seem to be departing their seasons with more haste each year and fall is no stranger to that. But Red Hoptober seems to bridge the gap nicely, offering some toasted malt and enough crisp hop to battle the ongoing heat as the days, with almost painstakingly slow speed, grow cooler. I can certainly get behind this beer for now. What pains me, though, is it's mid-November best by date. After all, if the weather's course is any indication, that's when Red Hoptober and it's ilk will be truly at their prime."
""
"I was surprised by this beer from the instant I opened and poured it. One, because of its appearance—I wasn’t expecting something with such a rich, deep amber brown hue, and literally two solid fingers of creamy foam topping it. And two, the aroma—oh, what an aroma! From the instant I cracked this open I could smell it. First impressions are of chocolate malt—just this wonderfully bright bouquet of roast and chocolate malt that comes across. It’s pleasing and another surprise. The flavor cracks with a smooth malt like an amber and a defined, distinct bitterness. There’s a pleasing hoppiness that develops and gives this some kick. Not sure where this beer fits in the grand scheme of things—it’s a hoppy amber, or a malty IPA, or just something altogether delicious."
"O: an interesting and solid beer overall. The hop and brown ale notes don't blend very well, but it's still an enjoyable beer."
""
"Overall, I have to admit, I do not like this ""amber/red"" ale at all. I'm getting tired of New Belgium's beers all tasting the same with the same hop profile. And besides, i like reds/ambers to be malty, toasty, and sweet, not bitter and sour like this thing, despite it's name of ""Red Hoptober."" Their original Hoptober brew last year was phenomenal, this one ... not so much."
"The initial taste is of grain husk and toasted malt. Then the citrus hop kicks in all the way through to the finish. I really like the cascade and toasted malt finish. The beer is medium body and has a smooth feel to it. It has good balance between the sweetness and bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable beer. This would be a good Amber or Brown ale on it's own, but the addition of citrus hops kicks it up a notch."
"D - would be better enjoyed with food."
""
""
""
"O - I am pretty Meh on most of the recent NB offering and on ambers in general. When you combine the two, I guess I shouldn't be surprised at the results. Drinkable, but I wouldn't but it on the ""have again"" list. Average at best."
"O: This is a nice beer, but man does it smell awesome--I just wish that translated more"

"12 oz bottle poured into a New Belgium tulip glass. Dark red color; earthy hop smell with a malty background came off of the 1/2 inch off white head. Hop smell replaced by sweet rich malt while drinking. Taste reminds me of a mildly sweet stout with balanced bitter character. There was a slight alcohol burn on the back end. Thin light lacing was left on glass. Overall impression is of a half stout and half IPA to warm a cool July airconditioned evening."

"Pours a clear dark amber with a 2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, toasted bread, and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slight sweetness and a fresh herbal hop flavor. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp yet medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is quite tasty and very easy to drink."
