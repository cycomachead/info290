"Pours a clear, copper color.  1/3 inch head of an off-white color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, alcohol, strong hops, slight citrus, caramel malt, and a hint of pine.  Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale.  Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, hint of caramel malt, hint of yeast, slight pine, and hops.  Overall, good appearance, decent aroma, body, blend, and complexity."

"From the other reviews I read and being a fan of the red/Amber family, I think I may have gotten an ""off"" batch. Instead of a crisp hoppy flavor, I get an almost soapy and flat taste. Enjoyed the other Lakefront brews from the sample pack, so I may have to try this one alone."

"unexpectedly yeasty and hoppy, with floral aromas and a bitter aftertaste."
""
"Very floral smell and taste. Piney sort of hops, similar to an IPA. poured a lovely red/gold and had a nice cream head that stayed for the majority of the drink.  Mouthfeel was pretty light for a beer that is 6.8%. I could session this beer. Very nice."
"Uncapping the beer releases light grains, a touch of tartness, grassy hops and some citrus notes and light fruit.  Pours orange amber with a slight haze under a thick, 2” rocky, protein heavy head. The lace is thick and clingy. Light caramel to toffee joined by light fruit and malt spice roll over the tongue culminating in a light bitter accent. Has a creamy, above average body and average carbonation."

"10/17/12 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Reminds me of ESBs from UK. Leaned hoppy from a straight ahead bitter, yet not quite to the IPA stage. Not bad, but off the mark for my un-hoppy tastes."
"Great hoppy red"

"It's an enjoyable, hop-forward red ale."
""

"Growler on tap Joe Canals. Pours brown / amber with a medium beige head. Aroma and Taste of toasted caramel malt, earthy hops, mild floral and fruity notes and a bit of toffee flavors. A medium body, smooth going with good carbonation on the palate. Finish is of toasted caramel malt, a lingering toffee flavor with earthy floral hops bitterness. Overall your basic all around amber ale, with a good caramel malt character, smooth and nicely balanced. A good drinking brew."
""
""
"Fixed Gear is like, totally underground, man. You've probably never heard of a superior combination of hoppy pep with sweet malty goodness. It was a red ale before it was cool. It beats out a neat 6.8% in a Velvet amber mystique - kind of like chillin' out to the B - side of an LCD Soundsystem side-project remix vinyl."

"Very smooth maltiness and a very nice caramel taste midway and through the finish.  A little high in the booze dept so don't drink too many.  :-)  Also don't think this one too cold, I think.  That hampers the caramel taste."

"This beer can be found in 38 states and 7 countries. An overall great beer, I might be abnormally high on it because I tasted it directly from brewery. Nevertheless, a great beer and definitely recommend."
""
"Another fine beer from Wisconsin. Although I've spent most of the summer sampling Wisconsin/Minn. IPA this is a nice refreshing high alcohol Red. Has a slight bitterness, but Lovely taste that is super smooth--this one is fine, fine, fine---well done, Lakefront!"

"Taste is dark, burnt caramel maltiness, almost to dark chocolate levels. The hops are almost all on the bittering side, floral and long-lasting. It tastes pretty old school - old world hops, more bittering than taste/aroma hops and an earthy and char-esque maltiness. Mouthfeel is good, rich and well carbonated. Sweetness is pretty low. I actually am enjoying this, It feels like a tasty throwback to the early days of microbrews in the late 90's/early 2000's."

"O - A decent red ale with a good amount of hops, I had this beer a while back on tap and enjoyed the mouthfeel a lot more than I did today. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Very easy drinking but with a good level of flavor and complexity. A rather nice red overall."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was amber colored even though it really is a red ale. Who cares right? The beer had a tan head and the beer had a great smell of vanilla. The beer was nice and clean tasting with a very faint vanilla taste on the initial hit. I think I will give this beer another shot."

"Sharp beginning with spicy earthy hops and notes of grapefruit pith and orange rind. Very dank, but semi-dry. Toasty roast gets a lot of attention as it passes across the palate like bitter grit. Flowery tea infusion notes are interesting, but somewhat harsh in position. There's a clunky alcohol presence that kind be tasted. Finishes with spicy bitterness and a second burst of carbonation. This beer is quite airy and of the crushing kind. The body travels at a medium speed, but features all kinds of texture. Drinkability is about a C+ to a B-. Fixed Gear is not a red ale I'd scoff at, nor one that I would recommend."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 12/11/2013. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep red-orange color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, brown sugar, biscuit, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, citrus rind, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malts and citrus hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, light biscuit, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, tangerine, grapefruit, orange peel, floral, grass light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and citrus/grassy hop flavors; with a good malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber ale. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and citrus hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"This is obviously a hybrid style, which leaves more room for creativity. Without a need to criticize for authenticity I can only say it is an enjoyable hop heavy beer. I would gladly buy this again."

"It's a nice reddish orange with a quarter inch head that hangs around. Nice lacing also. Malts are in the forefront of the nose. Has a candy malt smell actually. I like the fact that hops are intertwined with the malts in it's taste. The malts definitely hit the tongue first but with a sudden instance the hops reveal themselves. The mouthfeel is moderate. Will visit this again as I like hops and in my opinon this is a hoppy red ale, not overdone with hops but nicely done."

"pretty impressive for almost a macro, this is the best ive had from lakefront. this is everywhere but ive somehow missed it. a hoppy red ale that drinks a little heavier than most. hazy amber in color with an oatmeal colored head with excellent lace and retention. the nose here is hop forward, bitter, and rich from the grain. the alcohol content is also somewhat of a surprise, being as robust as it is for a release like this. maybe i had the wrong opinion about these guys. their pumpkin is clearly a poor judge of what they are capable of. nice richness of feel, as the hops provide most of the flavoring and the malt more of the structure. a little dryer than expected too, i like the low sugars on the finish and the lasting bitterness. woody almost, quite good really. fuller body a sixer might be too big of a dose honestly. relatively impressed, and will look forward to more lakefront stuff when it comes around. i wont wait so long next time."

"o - as this is a local brewery for me I continue to go back to this one. it is a go-to beer because of great availability, price, and taste. enjoy this one"

"Hoppy beers with a malty backbone almost always sit well with me. This one didn't disappoint. Great head retention and substantial lacing on the glass. Very hazy and deep amber color. The smell is good and I pick up some grapefruit, but for a beer that's supposedly heavily dry hopped there isn't much there. Maybe the keg isn't as fresh as it should be. However the taste makes up for it with a very bold dose of crystal malt (without going overboard) layered with grapefruit and some spicey notes. The mouthfeel is surprisingly silky. There is not a ton of carbonation in this one but I think it goes well with the flavors. Overall I'd definitely have this one again sometime and would recommend it to any hop heads who like some balance in their beer."
"DATE TASTED: November 21, 2013... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint... OCCASION: new Dream Theater and my wife's thirty-seventh birthday equals a good night!... APPEARANCE: copper-amber body; creamy off-white one-finger head that laces rather thickly--attractive... AROMA: quite a hoppy sensation for a red; bright, active, almost suggestive of its 6.8% ABV... PALATE: intensely biting presence; medium to full-bodied with a substantial finish--bold...TASTE: immediate taste of pinecone--definitely American--with a confident underpinning of malt to provide a big-mouthed balance...OVERALL: I am beginning to see why Lakefront has garnered such a quality reputation, as this brew snuck up on me with veritable strength and a balance that rewards...the style is not given to immediate impressiveness, but this offering is enjoyable and somewhat distinctive..."

"Overall, I was impressed by this beer. Lakefront has been hit and miss for me but this one is definitely a hit. Wish i would have picked up more than a single."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy red with a nice white head. Smells of caramelized malt with some piney hops. Tastes of dark roasted malt with some notes of fruit with a little hoppy bite. Beer is heavily carbonated but still light bodied and very drinkable. Overall a very good beer."
""
"O-This is a pretty decent representation of the style. It is not going to blow anyone's mind, but it provides a good bit of flavor in a very drinkable package. I was surprised to see that it packs nearly 7% ABV because it doesn't taste it at all. A nice beer for quaffing on a cool fall evening when I don't want to think about things too much."
""
"Ok, another random pick from a local market. Looks and smells like beer. Took a swig and got punched in the mouth with hops. Hate it. Just another bottle of carbonated hop-water. Really, is this the only standard for American micro-brews? Go hop heavy and forget anything else? If you're a hophead this beer is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
""
""
""
"This is a solid red ale, but nothing too exciting."

"Pours deep reddish amber with sparse head and some lacing. Nose features fair amount of citrus and pine followed by a decent grain presence. Taste is higher in the bitterness dept with nice citrus fruit as well as pine and caramel. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Overall a nice well balanced hop forward brew."

"I came back for a couple more turns at this fixed gear and really liked it, found it fresh and consistent. First rate Amber Ale. Great body."
""
""
"Fixed Gear pours an amber color with a small head. There is a floral and harsh malty aroma. The taste has a nice mellow hop flavor with a harsher malty backbone. Nice full flavors, but the beer does go down a bit harsh. Overall its a nice hoppeir red ale."
""
""
""
"Overall -- a bit more malt and this would be amazing, but its too unbalanced for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good amber/red ale, bold in malt, hops and yeast, and balancing it all. Also good for hopheads that want to have a rest from IPAs, the 54 IBU gets you fixed enough. Definitely worth it."
""
""
""
""
"Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable and refreshing example of one of my favorite styles."
""
"this is a must go-to from now on. 6pk price is cheap enough and definitely a nice change of pace from my usual ipa styles that i tend to go for."

"To the Point: it is a bold ‘red’ ale; red ale is not one of my favorite styles – but, I would buy this one again. It is an over hopped red ale and if you did a blind tasting on this ale you would guess – ‘American pale ale’"
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rest: A pretty good beer. It has some fairly bold flavors but still has good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am not too disappointed since Lakefront really does make rather mediocre beers with the exception of the Winter lager. I am puzzled on how high the reviews are considering this beer is borderline terrible but it is somewhat drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright reddish copper hue with a creamy two finger head and lacing everywhere looks very enticing for a red ale,the smell Is pineapple,blood oranges,grapefruit and piney hops,the mouthfeel is medi with moderate carbonation that suits perfectly and has tastes almost exactly like aroma with hints of pineapple,citrus,boiled candy,blood oranges and finished with a piney hop bitterness and overall it's a nice representation of a fine red ale and ill be back for another one that's for sure sessionable and tasty need I say more."
""
""
""
""
"Personally, I don't prefer aggressively hoppy reds, though this is by no means a beer I'd pour out. It would be better if it found a better balance between malt and hop. Would probably not buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a deep amber color with a soapy tan head on top. The beer has a very nice lacing as well as a pretty strong retention as well. The smell has a pretty good piney aroma with some toasted malts in there as well. The taste of the beer has a pretty good bitterness to it along with a nice caramel malt flavor in there also. The mouthfeel is creamy, a decent carbonation and dry in the finish. Overall this is pretty good, would love to have it fresh. Worth trying!"
""
""
"A tasty beer with a great mouthfeel that leans toward the malty side. A nice change of pace from all the hop bombs out there."
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a great beer, but has a nice feel."
"Look is a deep red/amber filled with very fine sediment. Thin covering of lacy head. Smell is light malt, citrus hops, maple syrup, oak, alcohol. Taste kinda has a dry leaves thing going on, but that is removed from the mouth by a boatload of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent amber ale. Consistent and fairly thick bodied tones. It doesn't really give a lot of variance on the flavor, but it's pretty good for what's there. Smooth feel overall. Pretty easy to drink. Not too shabby, but not too memorable either."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a nice balance between the citrusy hops and caramel malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- It's a decent beer. Nothing extraordinary though. Not complex whatsoever and you can't really taste the malt base."
""
""
""
"This is fantastic. EVERYTHING a hoppy red ale SHOULD BE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I may have had this one a little too cold. The flavor doesn't live up to the interesting aroma, but I wasn't in the least bit disappointed."

"I like this beer. There are other hoppy reds and amber I like more, but if I saw this on tap somewhere, I would order a pint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky copper with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty decent amber ale, something apparently much more common south of the border, where they aren't afraid to submit to the whim of the big hops, and we are ever the more so grateful for it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty good red ale"
""
""
"I love this mason jar. Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy russet-amber topped by a small layer of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises bright grapefruit zest, orange zest, and buttery caramel throughout the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a stronger rind component from the fruits, a less buttery caramel backbone, and a stiff bit of pine resin. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry and slightly sticky finish. Overall, a very nice, if not all that visually attractive, hoppy red, one of the best I've had in a while."
""
"100th review for this beer. 12oz bottle, pours a hazy brownish-red with frothy beige head that holds decent retention & leaves some spotty lacing. Aromas are caramely, malty, citric, bready, fresh-like hop. Tastes are a heavy dose of bready, caramel malt balanced with fresh citric hop and some pine that lingers on the finish. Thinner body with ample carbonation. Overall, a nice version of an American red ale, nothing spectacular, but it is a good representation of the style."
"Overall: An alright beer that is pretty great for the first pint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Slightly hazy copper-amber pour with a tinge of red. Two finger off-white head with great retention and crazy lacing. Huge resiny, piney, malty nose with hints of toffee, caramel, brown sugar, blood orange, and a touch of grapefruit. The taste is just as bold and juicy as the nose. Hints of pine resin, pink grapefruit, blood orange, toffee, caramel, sweet bread, and brown sugar. The balance is perfect and the drinkability is off the charts! The mouthfeel is smooth with a subtle creaminess along with a bit of hoppy bitterness on the finish. Probably the best example of a Red Ale I've tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
"This ale is red (duh) and slightly cloudy, with 1 1/2 inch head, slightly creamy. The smell and taste of this are opposite, the aroma is mostly malt, while the hops dominate the taste at first. After a few sips, the malt starts to show up a bit more on the palate. Overall, more hoppy and less malty than you might expect from a red ale, still delicious."
""
""
""
"O: Decent. This grew on me by the time I got halfway down the glass. I paid $1.50 for a single bottle at Price Chopper, with some trepidation after my Fuel Cafe experience with Lakefront. I got a solid beer at that price; I wouldn't mind drinking this if I saw it on tap somewhere."
"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a rusty copper/tawny brown. Barely any tan head. The smell is a sweet mix of brown sugar, grainy malt and a little spice from the hops. The brown sugar/molasses comes through on the palate with some nutty malt (marzipan?) flavours and a solid hop bite at the back end of the finish. Reminded us a bit of Lagunitas Brown Shugga."
""
""
"Not quite as good as 3F Brian Boru as a hopped-up red ale, but in the same zip code. So, if you fancied the Boru, seek out Fixed Gear as a year-round alternative. Thumbs up!"
""
""
""
"This is yet another satisfying amber/red ale with a solid hop profile. It is a little rough around the edges but still remains quite quaffable."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice balanced red ale with a good malt and hop balance and a nice hop profile."
""
"Overall- In truth, I have had some attempts at IPA's that weren't as good as Lakefront's amber ale. So, I guess if you want to give a hoppy amber ale a try, then this beer would be a good choice. And really, the hop profile in this amber is not bad! Don't try to look too hard for the biscuit-like malts in this beer. They won't be there."
""
""
""
"Overall - I wouldn't expect the beer from its label. And I'd be disappointed if I were looking for a red ale."
""
"Somewhat aggressively hopped for the style, I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Has a good deep red color. Great complexity in the nose. The flavor is right in style with those toasty red malts, a little bit too much roastiness. Stylistic American hops. Good full body. This body fits right in line as a good American Red. It's worth mention that I have had this beer in my fridge and should have tried it much earlier."
""
""
""
"O - Well crafted brew that I'm glad I had to opportunity to try."
""
"O - I'd pass. Was hoping for more but got an amber that was heavier than my meal. I think I'll pass on Lakefront for now."
""
"Note: I really like this beer even though it might not be complex or anything."
"Notes: Very good and quite sessionable. Cheers."
""
""
""
"Overall... despite that the bottle says ""it tastes damn good", I disagree. While it has some interesting qualities, not a very well done beer at all. Some off flavors, malt doesn't seem to really nail itself down, hops are too earthy and don't really sit with the rest of the beer, and the yeast seems to have added some qualities that it didn't want to leave."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fixed Gear is a bold red with a far more forward hop profile than usual, especially in the aroma. Best to think of this as a red APA, it is moderately bitter rather than slightly sweet. As hoppy as many IPAs, this is easily recommended as a ""red ale"" for hop heads."
""
"O- Not my favorite style but very drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Fixed Gear is a bold red with raw power in aroma and flavor, focusing in on a strong blend of hops with a solid malty backbone. Moderately bitter, it packs a punch down to the last drop, and this is a beer where every drop counts."

"Not sure if red/ambers are supposed to taste like this, but I loved it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy deep red, nice head to start, but quickly faded. Fruit, apples and prunes, particularly middle to end. While there's plenty of carbonation, the mouthfeel is surprisingly soft. Medium body. Hops in the finish and some bitterness, but all is quickly gone."
""
""
"Overall, good beer. Enough for hopheads, but balanced enough for an easy and enjoyable drink. I'd get it again."
""
"Awesome aroma, pretty bitter."
""
""
""
""
"O) Really one of the better reds I've had recently. I'd definitely drink this again. Glad to recommend..."

"Overall, a great American red...This is my second beer from this brewery and I'm impressed."
""
""
""
""
"M: Good mouth coating. Had that ""wet"" feeling all the way through. Good aftertaste and bitterness not overboard."
""
"An amber reddish brew with a soapy white head...some floaties and haze, along with penty of carbonation. The aroma is a little hoppy, with some fresh pine and citrus qualities. A bit of malt comes out in the flavor, which is balanced but just a bit on the sweet side. It's really an average beer: it offers nothing spectacular, but also nothing objectionable. Drinkable and solid. I enjoyed it, but wasn't wowed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice, drinkable, tasty amber. This really was quite good for the style, which isn't one of my favorites."
""
""
"O - It is bold as the label says but not one I would repeat."
""
""
""
"A decent enough beer to get for my Friday fish and chips outings, but i normally don't have much to choose from."
""
"D - This one'll satisfy those looking for a prominent hops presence (albeit an imbalanced one). I'll pass on it in the future though."
""
"The mouthfeel is very pily and a little resiny. Bitter through and through. This is an amber ale for a hop head that made a lucky mistake."
""
"O: this is the best 'red' beer i've had to date."
"Thanks again for keeping on your toes, Lakefront."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - overall a solid beer that would be easy to knock back. This is good but not too complex. The nose and look are by far the best part of the beer. The taste is good and the MF is a bit disappointing and really prevents this from being a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- very impressed with this beer. want to find and try more beers from this brewery. cheers"
""
"Poured from the bottle a hazy amber/copper color, with a one finger light tan head. Smells of foral spicy hops very nice. Taste has a very nice maltly backbone similiar to a amber ale, but has a very nice hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is right on for my taste. Very drinkable beer."
"Damn good beer. Hoppy for an amber ale. It's red/brown and murky. I poured into a snifter. Good tan head, good lacing. Nose almost stings from hops, also caramel malts pop through. It drinks really smoothly. It's almost like a double ipa, but not quite as hoppy. The malts are definitely there and quite delicious. As an experiment, serve this beer to some Fat-Tire junkie and see what happens. I'd wager they would prefer this, unless they really didn't like hops."
""
"D: I love this style and here is another great example. Unique unto itself but very good."
"O - Good flavor. Not in the same league as Troegs Nugget Nectar but a nice red."
""
"O) A well crafted amber ale. I'd definitely have another one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light to medium body with a good amount of fine carbonation. Easy to drink and pretty solid amber ale."
"Big rich roasted grain undertones that leads into a bitter roasted finish."
"Another decent brew that seems less than stellar with all the other great beers available."
"Almost more brown than red or amber.The smell of pine is intense, but in a pleasing way. Taste backs off the pine somewhat in favor of grapefruit; it has a definite IPA taste and mouthfeel to it, even a little bit of a Belgian IPA taste. The label claims it has a bold taste and it lives up to that. The predominant note is pine, very clean but direct. I think the taste matches perfectly with the 6.5% alcohol content, as it is an enjoyable beer but not one you're going to want to drink down too quickly. This is definitely a beer I will return to. Think of it as a cheep, available Hopslam that won't kick your ass if you try drinking more than 2."
"This is a nice and smooth drinker, the mouthfeel is fairly light and has a perfect level of carbonation. The drinkability is the best aspect of this beer for sure though, it's been a while since I've had a beer this perfectly drinkable. This bomber emptied in record time,for sure. Which kind of leads me to my problem here, and it's a bit of a Catch-22. If this beer weren't in bombers, I probably would have never bought it. Now that I've bought it, I want it in six-packs because it's a great drinker that I'd love to keep in my rotation. Oh well, it's a great beer that I'll recommend."
"O: A nice, hoppy red; it has bite but it has bready substance too; this is good stuff"
"O - For a red ale, I like the bitter bite as opposed to the toasted malt vibe from other reds I've had. I wish the flavor intensity could be dialed up a little and maybe a little more body."
"Overall a good american amber ale. Nothing too aggressive or out of line."
"O- Overall, not bad. This beer went down very easy and has enough flavor to keep you interested. Worth a try."
"Nicely done."
"T: The hops give the beer a bite on the tongue that adds texture to the beer and a flavoring that makes it stand out. I also noticed a little bit of a flowering notes in the beer"
"Overall a nice and balanced beer."
"The beer isn't bad but not good enough for me to want to pay money for it. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me though."
"I like this, it's a mix between a red and an american IPA, although not nearly as hoppy and bitter. This would make for an excellent session beer. It's pretty light and refreshing and goes down smooth, but packs full flavor. On a hot day like today, I with I had another few bottles to enjoy."
"VERY GOOD, WORTH TRYING!"
"A good effort from Lakefront, but comes up short as a Red ale compared to all those well done West Coasters."
"This is a very nice ale, with good presentation and impressive follow-through. There's a lot of complexity to the flavors in this one, with hop and malt mingling for a product that's similar to other brews in the style but distinct. A drinkable beer that really begs to be tried and appreciated anew."
"I reccommend checking this beer out. It was pretty original."
"O: This was a good beer. I'm not sure how I feel about the amber/red style designation-- it seems to fit somewhere between that and an American Pale Ale. If I were rating for conformance to style I would probably mark this closer to 3.5, but this review is for my perception of the beer itself, styles aside. This is the fourth of the four beers in the sampler, and I have enjoyed each one. Well done, Lakefront."
"Quite a tasty brew. Beautiful looking beer, even the creamy head made it down to the bottom of the glass. It's not that filling either and quite a easy brew to drink. This is a lot tastier than the IBA I recently had by Lakefront Brewery. If you can get your hands on this, don't hesitate, you most definitely should try it."
"Opens moderately sweet with bright notes of caramel that leisurely yield to suggestions of floral hops and citrus fruits. Hop bitterness is held to a bare minimum. Crisp and actively carbonated with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Well balanced and exceedingly sessionable. Recommended."
"Comes out of the bottle a reddish mahogany with a thick, frothy and rather persistent pale beige head. Aroma is not strong, but is spicy and hoppy and inviting. Flavor exceeds the wan aroma, being hoppy but not bitter, with nutty and malty undertones and spicy and horehound hints. Lively texture is quite tingly and fizzy, leaving a nice edgy and slightly hoppy finish."
"A really nice beer. Well balanced and should appeal to a lot of beer drinkers. I'll be getting another very soon!"
"Overall: A good amount of malt and hop flavor combined with an appealing drinkability and level of balance. I enjoyed this punchy red fairly well."
"A decent brew with a good amount going for it. Drinkable, and stylistically pretty good. Certainly good enough to make me keep my eyes open for other Lakefront beers."
"Overall, the red ale is rapidly becoming one of my new favorites. This is a solid effort and one that I will defiantly pick up again over the coming months."
"D: Not too filling or harsh, just out of balance and not appealing."
"This was not the beer in the four pack I was looking forward to the most but I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Overall the surprise of 2011 so far. A great American red ale and one I would definately buy in a six-pack. Lets hope the other three bombers are even half as good as this."
"Overall this beer was okay. It wasn't underwhelming, but nothing really stuck out about it that would make me want to have another. Not bad, but not great either. Middle of the road.l"
"Overall was nicely balanced and had some nice subtleties."
"D - Overall, I would characterize Fixed Gear as drinkable. Again, there is not any one specific characteristic that sticks out in the beer. It is simply an easy drinking red ale. A nice change from some of the more extreme beers that are currently out there."
"http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/02/megan_fox_employs_thumb_double.html"
"Overall i would say that this is a good amreican red."
"Taste: Smooth and malty upfront. Piney hops and some apple skin in the aftertaste. Supremely drinkable."
"Mouthfeel: Thin and easy to down, though I don't consider it drinkable due to the levels of bitterness."
"good beer. balanced. worth checking out."
"D: Good drinkability, good representation and hop usage makes this a big red."
"Side note: As a cyclist, I don't really care what kind of bikes other people ride. I commute on a converted single speed (with a brake) as Chicago is flat, and it was the only gear I ride in anyway. Finally, a beer that harmonizes with my choice of transportation. Hallelujah. /sarcasm"
"Beyond the hoppy harshness of the finish, this was pretty darn good and was definitely the tops of the Lakefront beers that I tried on this day. This is surprisingly dark feeling for an Amber Ale but I didn't mind one bit. This is worth a look (at least on draft)."
"A very well crafted amber. There are now several good hopped up amber and I would put this one in that same boat. Worth a try indeed."
"O: I gotta say the name/label caught my eye and I probably wouldn't have bought this beer otherwise. As far as the beer goes, I feel as if it is very forgettable and I'm glad I have a Lagunitas Lucky 13 in the fridge and I live in the state of Surly Furious. Won't buy again."
"Overall a pretty good beer with a nice amount of hop aroma and a beautiful red color. The grain profile left me wanting a bit and it could have been more balanced."
"Initially purchased for novelty (a buddy of mine is a bike guy), I've been pleasantly surprised. On the whole, it's rather impressive. I would really like to try it on tap. A few mods would make this fixie the talk of the Short North."
"Drinkability: nice red ale that is easy to drink. If you are in the mood for a malty beer with some nice hop presence this one hits the spot."
"Big flavor, immense drinkability, ...very likable. Wish this were in a 6-pack of 12-ouncers, rather than an a bomber. But this is a bolder beer than Lakefront normally brews. So, cheers to that!"
"This is the first ""Wow!"" beer I've had from Lakefront. There's a lot going on for the low ABV, it's unique, and there are absolutely no off nodes."
"D- A good drinker with enough hops to satisfy many palates. A good all around beer that is another good offering from Lakefront."
"Great hoppy amber ale; almost an IPA. Poured with a large cream colored foamy frothy head that lasts and lots of lace. Color is a hazy/cloudy medium. Aroma is hop malt a bit of earth. Flavor is like aroma and the hops are not too fruity which the way I prefer it. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is very good with a tapering malty sweet hop end. Session beer."
"Pours a nice dark copper color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, with a slight hop note, lots of caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, slight hop note, slightly bitter, with a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a very tasty brew, but more on the malty side."
"Overall it is a decent beer but not worthy of a bombee of this price point."
"D - To tell the truth, I thought this was going to be a gimmick brew by the Lakefront Brewery. Their beers have been hit or miss with me in the past. I picked up this bottle (1 pint 6 fl oz.) for $4.99, which to me isn't a terrible price for a good beer. This bottle is going down so well for me that I kinda wish I would have picked up 2 or 3. I'll be recommending this one to my friends! A must try."
"This really wasn't what I was expecting. I guess my scores correspond to my expectations. Maybe I need to go into each beer with no preconceived notions (?). Still, it was decent, just underwhelming is all. Thanks again, Andy!"
"Overall an above average red. For less then five bucks a bomber I could see picking it up again."
"(D)- A solid beer that has a good drinkability to it. Its very similar to their best selling Riverwest, only a bit bolder. Solid stuff right here."
"Overall I'd say it seems to have a bit more dark malt than it should, without enough sweetness or hop presence for balancing. Very good, just a little shy of being perfect."
"D- I could easily drink alot of this beer. Good thing it's in a 22oz bottle. Even at 6.5% it tempts at being sessionable, nice job Lakefront."
