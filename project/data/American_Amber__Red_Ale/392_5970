APPEARANCE: reasonably copper-amber body; strangely quiet in the way of bubbles; head mellows to a thin off-white head... AROMA: fragrant floral hops abound; nicely rounded caramel settles and balances the aroma--alluring... PALATE: crunchy and medium-bodied, with  slick finish that lingers confidently; possesses the effervescence of cola.....TASTE: mellow, sweet caramel with a pitchy, sharp funk that provides a distinct profile... OVERALL: what makes this an autumnal brew? a darker body? a smoky scent? a heartier flavor? This beer really doesn't have those attributes, but it does work well enough to compliment apps and football watching....","dacrza1","Oct 11, 2014"

Nutty, then grassy/spicy, floral at finish = good flavor transitions throughout. Balanced bitterness just pokes above to lend a slight edge. Delightful. Head retention average to less. Minor lacing, some small spots. Kind of hints at a German beer but remains straightforward (American, not English... clean yeast, malt, balance, body). Some malt does linger on the palate halfway through. Not bad, the hops keep it from becoming sweet or cloying. Nicely done. Improved. Better balance, better focus, better technique.

On the nose, I get some spices like nutmeg and cinnamon and some malts. There is also some caramel and brown sugar going on with the nose. On the taste, the caramel notes come out first, then the spices come out after well. The carbonation dances on the tongue and is quite active and nice. I would call this a “spiced amber” style. It has a bit more complexity than the normal amber. I could see why they call this a good transition beer. It’s lighter than a typical Autumn beer which is nice. The spice is subtle and not overwhelming. The finish is pretty quick with a little bit of caramel malt.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

Great nose of toasted malt and drinks incredibly smooth. The ratings so far on this have been way too low and I think that its lower alcohol % may factor in those scores.

3.33,-5.7,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O: Weyerbacher's fall seasonal is an ale rather than a marzen type lager. Since it is an ale, I was expecting a variety of flavors (by nature ales often have more flavors than a lager). While smooth and easy to drink, the flavor profile in this beer is not very full. There is some nutty flavor, and there are grainy oats in the finish which does work well with fall. The real strength of this beer is its appearance; it really catches the light well. However, that is not enough to separate Autumn Fest from the large amount of fall seasonal offerings.","ianjsullivan","Sep 25, 2011"

Nice bready nose, pretzel dough, rye, almost pumpernickel before lemon peel, a vague wildflower dash, no bitterness nor any sweetness for that matter, cigar wrapper and tar more than any caramel or toffee. Medium-bodied, strong carbonation frames the mouth entry and adds presence. Same demure profile to the rye, grain, cereal flavors, added to by a mineral water kind of freshness. At the same time, there's a dry ashen quality as well, not enough for tackiness but evident as there's minimal juice in lemon citrus and apricot, peach fruit flavors.

Also a tea like quality. Pretty thin feeling in the mouth. Lacking in carbonation and perhaps a touch more hop character.

Unfortunately the taste was far more washed out, exhibiting none of the richness found in the aroma. Tastes very bready and a bit heavy, but wihout that bread-in-the-oven quality found in the aroma. Grainy, a little thin, and with a metallic zinc-like taste up front followed by a light sweetness and a touch of banana bread on the finish. Fairly highly carbonated but somewhat thin. Lacks a bit of richness. This is okay overall, but there are a number of other fest beers out there I'd choose over this one. Also, what gives? It is August! A bit early yet for the fest season.

Has a hint of dried leaves almost, and yes, I do enjoy that smell. Also combines some mild caramel sweetness and a tiny bit of floral hops as well. Taste starts off with a clean citrusy hops that is quickly diluted by the malty sweetness. Aftertaste leaves an almost tea like flavor that is quite enjoyable, to me anyway.

I'm also picking up some hints of honey. Mouthfeel is a little to thin with plenty of carbonation. I could easily see this as a sessionable beer with football on its way.

Sweet, to be sure, very much in the Vienna-Fest family, with light caramel all around the edges.

The bouquet is buttery, almost sugary/syrupy with toasty/caramel malts, mild hops and some fruity/floral esters. The flavor is the same, light, with a mild bitterness that slowly creeps up on top of a light body that has medium carbonation and leaves a short finish. First off, it needs a lager yeast, as the ale yeast makes it to floral and fruity, but after that they need to beef up the toasted and caramel malts. As is, it's too light and comes across as a Yuengling fermented with ale yeast. I realize they are experimenting a bit, but I think they should have gone a more traditional route.","mmmbeer","Oct 20, 2006"

In terms of the brewer, Weyerbacher, it is way tame. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, with some decent carbonation.

AutumnFest has the appearance and smell, but the taste is way lighter than I had expected. It was lightly carbonated and the head laced the chalice till the end, however I wasn't sold. The flavors blended well but were gone in a flash. This one, to me, is light enough to be a session beer, but I wasn't looking for that when I bought this one.

Nose is malts that have soured. Flavor is all malts with just a slight hop bitterness towards the very end. Malts come across as bits of biscutis, toast, little bits of pumpkine pie spices and overripe fruit. It was the overripe fruit that knocked this beer off for me.

Definite fruit - tartish apple - taste with a honey malty sweetness reminiscent of the opening aroma. Perhaps a touch of spice  cinnamon? Smooth, with a nice gradual finish. Thin lacing doesnt hold. Medium bodied and nicely drinkable given its relatively high alcohol content. Fairly light for a octoberfest, correctly identified closer to a red ale here.

It's not really overwhelming, but it also doesn't seem out of place. It is balanced ot handle the sweetness so it does go hand in hand. Mouthfeel was light to medium with some good carbonation mixing in. Not a bad seasonal at all, perhaps for some people the sweetness could bring down the drinkability, which I gave an average rating.

Being an ale rather than a lager this has great flavor of the traditional malts. It pours a bronzy red with an eggshell head. Smell is malty and a little roasty with the sweet grains. The flavor is sweet and malty with an earthy hop balance and has some low estery fruitiness from the ale fermentation. Probably the most flavorful "Oktoberfest" I've had this season.

Toasted and nutty malt flavors, paired with apricot fruit notes open up as the beer comes to room temperature. A doughy, spiced apple pie character appears, as well, with a consistent, though mild, hop bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel at times seems thin, and perhaps not quite as full and round as it could be. Quite drinkable, but seems to missing something overall. Not really specific to any particular style, however, this is a pretty decent brew from Weyerbacher.","Jon","Nov 02, 2003"

Theres something similar to sour cherries in the aroma. I notice this similarity in their other beers. Maybe its the yeast they use, or their water, but it is distinctive to most of the beers I have tried from them. The taste is somewhat spicy with a pleasant nutty malt texture. I also detected some fruit in there, too. A flavorful and easy to drink seasonal ale, that might just be my favorite from this brewer.","pezoids","Nov 01, 2003"

The taste was quite similar to the smell, but had more elements of roasted malts and such. I also got a little hint of metal in the mix, but nothing too strong.

Taste consists of a bready mixture of mild spices, toasted nut, all drizzled in an caramelized apple syrup. Mouthfeel is a bit thin in body, but it's carbonation is solid.

Semi-sweet but fruity malt dont stand a chance against the one-two hops-sourness whollops. Its not sour in the off-tasting kinda way, but rather a subtle, berry-like manner.
