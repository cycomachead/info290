"Nice winter is coming type ale, though not too high abv's, gives you a nice warming feeling. Rich with caramel and grapefruit aromas, as well as grapefruit flavor. Balanced with a closing bitterness that is pleasant. Overall, one I like to enjoy when possible, very drinkable, giveit a try. Cheers!"

"Although no seeming microbiological flaws, the beer definitely seemed under (or weirdly) attenuated. Too residual-worty and with the oddest damn hop mis-balance I've experienced in a while. The notion of the overly tropical fruity hops doesn't help the whole ordeal either, but generally (sorry MH), this tasted like someone's early-effort homebrew. Sorry, a total miss for me."
"This beer pours a reddish color with a nice off white head. The smell is hoppy piney and a little earth with a nice malt presence. The flavor is slightly sweet with a good hop bite to balance it out. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation and a crisp finish. Over all a great beer"
"Overall, this is an excellent brew, and of far better quality than most of the fare offered at a typical liquor store. It doesn't necessarily bring anything *new* to the table--plenty of beers fall into the ""hoppy amber ale"" category--but what it does do, it does definitively, and reflects the brewers' obvious love for the craft."
"The first time I had this beer I found it to be kind of on the gross side. The second time and all the times after that I found it to be better. The beer poured out as a brownish amber color with a yellowish fan head. There is a decent lacing for this beer. The smell gives of a pretty good malt and hop profile. The taste has a good balance of flavors too but it seems to have a toasted or burnt quality to it. The mouthfeel is drinkable and about medium bodied. Overall Roxy isn't too bad but it's just not my favorite from Magic Hat."
"Overall very solid and a nice sessionable, and malty ale. I was actually quite happy with this one and glad to have grabbed one for sure."
"D: With its lighter mouthfeel very much a drinkable beer."
"I really hope we haven't seen the last of Roxy Rolles. It's the best thing Magic Hat offered."
"D- The best beer Magic Hat offers. Nice medium nutty beer with faint hints of citrus. Very drinkable."
"Always got it in a variety pack when I thought Magic Hat was the bomb. It was my favorite."
"Though it does lack malt balance, the ride is an even one, and it is what it says--a ""Hoppy Amber Ale."" It's also nice to see so much damn hop flavor from a beer that's only 35 IBU, proving once again that hop usage doesn't need to be reckless to be big and bold. This one could give most IPAs a run for their money and is a ""must try"" for hopheads."
"Not likely to get this again."
"D: Tasty, hoppy but not bitter, and not filling"
"D-Very good to sip on."
"D- I could have a few of these. We'll leave it at that..."
"Pours a rich, nearly hazy amber red, with a creamy two-finger-thick head that leaves a thick bit of lacing on the side of the glass. The nose is mostly pine and citrus, the hops clearly dominating this category, though there is a very faint hint of wheat trying to peek in from behind the clouds. The taste transports that wheat forward a bit, though the hops continue to pump in the piny citrus regardless. Not all that surprising, the body is moderate, the carbonation steady, all leading to a pretty drinkable brew."
"Pours a deep complex brown color. Very nice khaki colored head retention. It smells malty with a few quality hints of hoppy notes. The falvor is simple but nice. Has an earthy flavor profile. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. A very nice offering, I hope they make it available next fall."
"This beer us a typical brown with a malty nose and a hint of chocolate. The head on this beer is a tan the interesting part is the white lacing it leaves on the glass. This beer start malty sweet and finished with a chocolate bitterness. In between the two is a sour fruitiness similar to that of a dopplebock this is what sets it apart from other browns. This is a flavorful and drinkable brown."
"The local Meijer has single bottles for a large variety of beers $1.49 so I picked up a bottle of this. It pours out a dark carmel color and has a huge large-bubbled light tan head that sticks around forever. I smell sweet carmel malt, floral hops, and a little bit of fruityness. A citrus fruit like a tangerine or a clementine, perhaps. The flavor has several characteristics that combine into a pretty damn good beer. Flavors are sweet/sour fruit, sweet maltyness, maple, and hoppy pine. Good sort of tart aftertaste. Nice consistancy and texture and good to sip on."
"D - Good flavor and very smooth body. Low enough abv. to make this a sessionable ale, however nothing really stands out to seperate this from the rest."
"Drinkability: yet another good brew from the magic hat lineup. got this one in a mixed pack, and so far i've been impressed with their quality. not sure just how many of these i would drink in one setting ( 2 or 3 ), maybe that's why it was in the mixed box. all good things in moderation, i guess."
"I has this in a mixed pack, and was quickly turned off. Pours to a reddish brown color, with an ok head. Smells like flowers, from all the hops in it.The taste of the Hops are not overwhelming but they are still there in force, rather bitter, but has a slight sweet character. Not good."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a mahogany color with a nice tan head. However the head was gone pretty fast. Lacing was really good. Smell of this beer was toffee and taste was slightly however the hops blew away what would have been a great beer. No buy again."
"Taste is surprisingly hoppy and bitter with quite a bit of almost homebrew twang - kind of an earthy flavor. I' not a huge fan of that flavor but otherwise it's pretty solid."
"Pours a dark amber color with a finger of yellow stained head. Little bit of lacing on the glass an fair retension. Before I even take a whiff, the citrus hops are dominating. Very strong grapefruit and floral aroma with some malt sweetness as well. Taste is a nice blend of hops an malt. The malt taste upfront quickly changes to a bitter finish. Light carb, med feel. Overall not bad, would definitely drink this again if looking for a cascade fix."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I'm really liking this take on an amber ale. It would surly would have tasted better fresh, but I liked the way it evolved. My folks picked it up at the grocery, they have only been selling beer like that in PA for less then a year, but I doubt this was fridge kept the whole time. Still, glad to have tired it, solid. Thanks Mom & Dad!"
"Pours a cloudy, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of floral hops, sweet malt, caramel, and slight herbs. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hops, tea-like bitterness, slight sweet malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, fairly bitter, but still a good body and blend."
"Overall: A part of the Halloween sampler, the R.R. balances malts and hops in a rare fest feat--any member of stem ware would have fairly fit this beer... a bit identifinable, a bit more substantial than the norm, which seems to fit Magic Hat's mantra... thick and resilient."
"This is the beer that effectively replaced Jinx, and though I am heartbroken that I can't get one of favorite beers anymore, I am glad a brew as good as this one comes in its place. Look for it."
"This beer is fantastically drinkable. I could see myself sipping two or three on a crisp autumn evening. Magic Hat has been hit or miss with me but I really do enjoy this offering."
"The pour created about a finger's worth of rocky (roxy?), medium-tan head with decent retention. Nose was moderately hoppy underlain with a light malty sweetness. Color was a slightly hazy deep-amber. Mouthfeel was medium with a very good hoppy flavor on the tongue. Amber?!? I'd have said APA, not unlike SNAPA, perhaps a little sweeter, especially on the finish, but plenty hoppy to keep the likes of me happy. Lovely lacing throughout."
"A very nice amber ale from Magic Hat. I enjoyed every sip."
"A decently satisfying ""autumn seasonal"" (as the label would have it) ale that could easily draw my attention away from Oktoberfestbiers this time of year."
"It's a roughly carbonated amber, but better harsh than bland really. Roxy Rolles reminds me of a tripel and is a pleasantry to wade through and disect."
"Notes: I had been waiting for a hoppy ale after having a lot of seasonal lagers. Definitely a solid hoppy beer to enjoy anytime. Smells and tastes great."
"D: I could see this being a session beer. Not something I would reach for immediately, but if the choices were generic macros, common imports, or this, I would choose to roll with the roxy."
"A good autumn beer but nothing too interesting."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear mahogany color with a decent, frothy light brown head, hints of lacing. Aroma is dark roasted malts, caramel, earthy, resin, and citrus hops. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, grass, and resin hops. Mouthfeel is oily, fairly carbonated with a dry, bitter finish. Very drinkable, kind of has a bite at the end."
"D: Nothing too spectacular about this beer but overall very drinkable."
"Wish I got to try the Old Ale they came out with this Spring."
"Why is this so highly rated?"
"Drinkability a good beer with nice flavors"
"d- this beer goes to show you what wide ranges of beers there are within each style, i enjoyed this, even though it wasn't what i was expecting, this is a fall beer for sure - magic hat you got me again!"
"Not a drain pour but definitely not spectacular either... Not ripping the brew or anything, just nothing really awesome to say about it..."
"This was an enjoyable autumn ale. Not quite as hearty as I was expecting for a fall seasonal, but far better that most amber ales. This beer has personality for a red, and that's a good thing."
"beautiful deep whiskey color with massive lacing and head...fresh hop pungency in the nose...tsste is up there (almost) with Nugget Nectar...the best of MH for sure...mouthfeel is perfect and can hardly be separated from the taste experience...thick and luscious...too too drinkable....:)"
"Drinkability is high. Solid offering from Magic Hat"
"D - Very drinkable for how strong it is. Just can't put it down."
"The mouthfeel is nice, middle of the road with some decent carbonation. This all adds up to a pretty drinkable product, not too shabby at all. They should market this heavier than the #9 within craft circles."
"Note - The label is also a winner..."
"D:"
"D - Nice beer to have after a long hike."
"D: This is probably the best magic hat brew i've had, find myself telling my wife to get the night of the living dead pack, she drinks the circus boys and #9's, i like the odd notion and roxy rolles. Very seasonable enjoyable brew."
"Overall, started out good, but went downhill. Things didn't seem to blend well. I probably won't be having this one again."
"12oz. brown bottle - best by 11/30/09 on box. Vigorous pour into a tulip produces a full tight head which fades to a thin lace. Beautiful dark ruby color, clear. Herbal hops balanced with some roasted malt on the nose, not too complex. Good roasted malt flavor with a great hop compliment, balanced sweetness/bitterness. Good carbonation, medium body, just what I would hope for. Very sessionable, mellow, great for food - especially cheeses and fatty meats. Definately enjoyed."
"I enjoyed this one."
"Pours an amber red with a white head. First whiff is of hops, but then you get malt which makes me think it will be a nice balanced beer. This is definitely a hoppier amber ale, with a nice hop flavor (maybe grapefruits) but also enough malt to make it balanced. I know that American Amber/Red Ale is somewhat of a catch-all term, but this is what I want when I drink a beer of this style. This beer is very drinkable and goes down smooth. Great beer."
"Final thoughts: An interesting take on an Autumn seasonal. They took their original spring Roxy Rolles hoppy Amber and Oktoberfested it up a few notches. Seems to have quite a bit of German malts and hops, and it seems, from what I've read, to be pretty true to what an Oktoberfest used to be as the Germans were the ones that really found a niche with hopping beers. I really enjoy this and I'm glad I found it to add to the Oktoberfest beer lineup. The only complaint I have is that it is a little too sweet for my tastes. But overall a good beer."
"pours a dark copper color with a 1/2 inch head some lacing thru-out..the smell is sweet malts and some hops but mainly malts..the taste is a malt forward amber hit on the senses followed by some average hop/spice, citrus,pine and grapefruit tastes ..it pretty well balanced but with a nod to the sweet caramel malts that are in charge in this one.. it is good tasting easy to throw back several of these..its recommended if you like pale ale and ipa's as this one is a light version of those styles... but this aleis not on on the rotation for me"
"The ABV is low enough for chugging, but the flavors are quite complex and that hop kick makes it seem a bit stronger than it actually is."
"This beer pours a reddish brown with a one fingered tan head and nice lacing. The smell is nice and malty with pretty much no hop smell. The taste is well balanced with a suprisingly nice maltbase to this brew. There is also some nice bitterness and some nice citrusy hop flavors. Nice mouthfeel and an easy drinker. Well done"
"On tap at Not Your Average Joe's in Randolph MA. Brought to me in a standard pint glass. This beer comes out an Amber brown color, that looks similar in color to a melted brown sugar. Has a haze to it, but slight clarity when held up to the light. This beer has a small off white colored head with some of the best lacing I've ever seen on a beer before, it's still at the top of the glass even when you're finished with it. The smell is good. Dominated by the hops which isn't something you'd quite expect from a fall or winter style of beer. Followed by the strong hop smell are some other notes of winter spices, but really just an after essence. The taste is very, very good. Seems to be more of a pine hop than citrus, but likely a bit of both. You can also detect some of the spices, maybe cinnomin and some roasted malt and grain. There is also a sour, or tart type taste that may come from some type of fruit that I couldn't quite put my finger on which brings me to the mouthfeel. It left a dry feeling in your mouth similar to when you bite into an apple that hasn't quite fully ripened yet, it's not bad and still above average because the carbonation level is perfect and there's no alcohol bite at all. This beer is extremely drinkable. Not quite sure how it's considered a winter or fall seasonal, I could certainly drink this all year round. But it's nice to see some hoppy styles come out and join the party in the colder weather."
"Cheers!!!"
"D: A little bitter for a session beer in my mind, but nice to have a few of."
"So glad to see a well-balanced Amber like this dawn the shelves here in MN, and by Magic Hat no less? Hope it sticks around as this will be consumed quickly upon purchase."
"Overall, a solid offering from Magic Hat. Nothing spectacular, but definitely makes me wonder about their other brews."
"I found this heavy and not super quaffable, but it's got some good things going. Reminds me a bit of Surly Furious. Not as high of a compliment as it seems, as I find Furious to have the same sort of one-dimensional bitterness and undefined malt character. Borderline IPA."
"Comes out of the tap a dark, warm, barely translucent brown with a decent tan head. Aroma is not strong but is malty and surprisingly hoppy with hints of yeast and cinnamon. Flavor is strongly hoppy, more like an IPA than an amber ale, with a malty undertone and a touch of spice. Smooth, tingly texture leaves a hoppy but not too bitter finish."
"This is easily my favorite beer from Magic Hat. Lots of great hops with a very nice malt backing. This would be a great Imperial Red Ale if they kicked it up a notch or two. Highly recommended if you like red ales and/or Magic Hat."
"This is a very good beer, one of the better from Magic Hat, very drinkable."
"Overall - Just the thing for a good Autumn seasonal, I'd say."
"An excellent red ale, has just enough sweetness to cut through the hops but still maintain the perfect balance of flavors. Wonderful fall seasonal beer...one of the best out there!"
"One of the better offerings I've had from Magic Hat."
"Overall: Off the bat this is ranked second in my list of magic's best offerings (that i've had) It is perfect for the season and im so glad they moved it to autumn instead of holding out for winter. Sad to see jinx go as the autumnal brew but this one holds its own in the lineup. When paired with a hearty chili (or any other meaty and spicy dish) this really opened up and complimented it and also developed an almost chocolate-esq creamy sweetness to the malt. This can be seen as magic's attempt at making arrogant bastards long lost little brother; not overwhelming but looks up to it with admiration."
"I really liked certain aspects of the beer. It has a good appearance despite chill haze... it cleared up as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was perfect and it is a drinkable beer. It even got better as it warmed, but I don't necessarily think the malty and hoppy aspects blended that well together."
"If you like beer's that have a very hoppy presence this one is for you, otherwise might want to stay away from this one."
"Awesome beer! I really liked this one. I almost wish it wasnt seasonal..."
"D- As a stand alone or a session beer this one could cover all the bases. I'm keeping this one on a list, I just hope it can be found outside of the few months of fall"
"D- Very very tasty- keep 'em coming. This beer has brought Magic Hat back into focus for me, and if they continue to produce this beer I will continue to proclaim its greatness from the mountaintops. A world-class beer... I am blown away!"
"Extremely pleasant and drinkable."
"D - I don't like Magic Hat in general, but I like Roxy Rolles a lot. The cloudy appearance and crisp, nutty flavor are what set it apart."
"D: I was looking forward to a fresh, hoppy amber ale...as that's what I was promised! This is super malty and actually a bit hard to finish. But I bought a 6er and I will drink the rest."
" Very, very nice, I wish I had more than the one I picked up. Will definitely seek out more!"
"D - Another enjoyable beer by Magic Hat. The ABV is just about right, you could enjoy this all evening."
"The mouthfeel is again in the IPA family if you ask me. There is a firm bitterness and a mostly hoppy aftertaste. I'm not sure exactly what makes this a seasonal autumn beer but it sure is nice to drink. Lightly carbonated and a little dry but all in all a great brew."
"Overall: Good balance between malt and hop flavors. Enjoyable, but lacking in the typical caramel richness of flavor."
"Smell is a citrus up front with s malt sweetness and fruitiness following. Caramel sweetness and citrus hops are balanced up front. Some toasted grain and tootsie roll in the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. This beer is really nice. I will definitely get again before Autumn is over."
"d- this beer is very very bitter and hoppy. if thats what you like... buy it. its a little to overwelming for me. ... i dont know what the ibu rating is but imo its more bitter than hop stoopid which says 102IBU right on the bottle. overall a pretty good brew, i wont buy it again."
"I'm finding that I am starting to stray from liking Ambers, and this is definatly not one of the best I've had."
"Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a large off-white head that quickly fades to a thin layer of suds. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is full of citrus and pine hops in west coast fashion. Moderately bitter flavor. Citrus hops at first dominate the flavor but has a minerally flavor that is a bit distracting and to me at least, not appealling. Has a bit of citrus in the finish but then it is gone. Medium body and nicely carbonated. A nice hoppy amber but the mineral charactor wore on me after awhile."
"Cheers to Magic Hat"
"Poured from a chilled 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a dark amber color and the head is about one finger thick and is made up of tan foam with some larger bubbles mixed in. There is a strong, inviting floral aroma. The taste is mostly grassy, bitter hops that linger on slightly after you swallow. There is also some malty sweetness present, but it is minor and doesn't detract from the hoppiness. There is an average body to this beer and has an appropriate amount of carbonation; the mouthfeel doesn't call attention to itself, it has a high level of quality that you can easily take for granted when drinking craft beers. I find this beer to be extremely drinkable; I can't identify anything in this beer that would make want to stop ordering it."
"The slight tart note kind of make this hard to session even though I love sour beers. Not a bad beer, but not something I'll reach for a lot."
"Rotation: one and done as better out there. No on tap unless only real choice."
"D= Pretty good. A very friendly Amber ale. Tame and still extremely delicious. Highly recommended amber ale."
"But great beer nonetheless!"
"D: Quite nice, mild red ale that I would not mind at all having again."
"Drinkability is very good, esp. when compared to other thick monsters such as Cascazilla and Nugget Nectar (both of which I am crazy for)that are also included in this style."
"D - I could probably drink about 4 of these before it gets old."
"Very good beer. I can't believe I've never heard of this brewery before."
"Pours a reddish color with a two finger head. The smell is of big malt character caramel and roasted malts with some piney hops at the end. The taste is big and flavorful, big roasted malt backbone with caramel tones. Mid way there is a piney hop taste. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Drinkability is above average, but not good due to how big the flavor is, it would be hard to drink alot of these. Overall it is a very solid beer, for a red the taste is complex, full, and bold."
"D- a lot of flavor packed into this inexpensive and low ABV beer. i havnt been too impressed with magic hat so far, but this is something i really got into. check it out."
"This is a fine rich red amber beer with a bit more hops than most red ambers. A fine specimen good to jumpstart your evening. But you'll probably want to end up with something a bit lighter as a night cap..."
"The first sip of this Hoppy Autumn Amber is just packed full of hops, but thankfully it gives way to a more mellow but full bodied red/amber very quickly - I am not a huge fan of hops but this beer smells so great that I was willing to try it anyways. It is like a mellower version of Lagunita's Limited Release Red Ale"
"Not one of my favorites, but one of the more solid brews I have tried from MH."
"I should qualify this review by saying that maybe I just had a bad batch(?) or my home refrigerator might have been set too cold and thereby ruined the beer. It didn't taste like how I recall it in the 3 or 4 previous years' versions."
"D - Very high. Good session brew that pairs with any food imaginable."
"Magic Hat Roxy Rolles is a dim, deep reddish amber ale with a huge, frothy, rocky, creamy yellow-tan head that has excellent retention and lacing. Looks superb. It has a very grassy aroma. Yes, it smells like grass and hay. It's medium-light bodied and pretty smooth. The finish is a little watery. It tastes like grassy hops. There's not too much malt flavor and it's a tid bit astringent. There's not too much going on, but at least it's bitter."
"Drinkability is pretty good here. Would make a great lawnmower beer."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle with a clipped off date of Feb 09. Sampled on August 9, 2009, so this was a bit past expiration date. The pour is an opaque amber-red with a foamy beige head that has the look of a milk shake head. The aroma is well hopped and crisp. The mouthfeel is about medium to bold. The taste is full of very bitter hops and slight sweetness. Not hoppy like an IPA but hoppy all the same. For its style it is excellent but it is not really my style."
"D: Full flavored and decent body makes this very drinkable."
"D - very drinkable. I wish they had this year round."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination yielded a pretty good tasting beer. A pretty, well-balanced taste yielded a nice drinking beer."
"D: Pretty drinkable, one of the better Magic Hat brews."
"Pours a transparent amber, biscuity thick head. Like you could float a quarter on it. Smell was that of diminished hops, not quite fresh, but unmistakeably rustic. Taste was again, slightly old hops. Little bit of biscuity malt sweetness. My bottle is from the winter, so it's a little old, but I've had it fresh, and it's just lost a bit of a step. Mouthfeel isn't impressive at all, thin and stale. I think it's a decent attempt at a hoppy amber, but not my favorite beer by any stretch."
"Poured from a 1 2ounce bottle into my standard shaker glass. Appears a clear deep amber color with about a finger of light tan foam. The lingering foam leaves a thin lace on the glass. Smells and tastes of mildly toasted grains, rich caramel malts and grapefruit pith ( caramel coated grapefruit peel?), toasted bread. Medium in both body and carbonation."
"M/D - light bodied and a nice hop twinge, this one is easy to drink and have several of."
"Pours an almost bright amber red. Nice head after that leaves a film and some lacing and good bubbling. Smells of dry bread,some toasted DME, and a good amount of Yakima Valley hops. Lots of open valley citrus hops upfront. The middle into the finish has some lame DME toasted malts. The palate is bitter overall and lacks some needed balance."
"D: This beer is an interesting study in balance. At first the flavors seem to be at odds but in the end it all comes together well. I find this to be a highly drinkable solid offering from Magic Hat, my favorite from them so far."
"D - This is my favorite Magic Hat beer that I have sampled so far. A nice red that I could easily drink a pint or two of."
"Future outlook: Quite a bit better than I was anticipating. I'd be happy to pick this up again during the summer."
"This beer poured a dark hazy brown with red highlights and a two-finger head that stuck around for a while. The smell is biscuity malt with a some citrus and floral hops. The taste starts off with some sweet bready malt that gives way almost immediately to hops that shift from citrus to a bit of pininess that clears up by the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some subdued carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, the hops are balanced well. Probably one of the better Magic Hat beers I've had."
"I've been on the fence for quite a while with Magic Hat. I am not often impressed with their beer. Roxy Rolles is a very nice exception. While it falls short of excellence, it is very good. I like it quite a bit. In some ways, it reminds me Nugget Nectar and the comparison seems natural. But, that comparison reveals what I'd truly like to see in this beer. A little more body, hops, and alcohol would take Roxy Rolles pretty far. That being said, it's easily one of the better beers I've had from Magic Hat."
"12 ounce bottle, best by March 2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy amber/brown color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is mostly citrusy and pine hops, along with a bit of biscuity malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some caramel malt I can taste in the brew. Good balance between the malt and hops. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth, tasty and easy to drink. I'm not a fan of most Magic Hat products that I've tried, but I have to give credit where it's due and this is a good brew that I'd pick up again. And with a 5.1% ABV, it's a good choice as a session beer too."
"I have been nursing one of these for over 15 minutes and it is still showing a full quarter-inch of head, and it has the kind of chewiness that one would expect from a beer that had twice as much ABV. Well done, indeed."
"Not sure I'd have multiple in a row, but the final verdict on this beer is...tasty."
"This beer is quite drinkable and a good winter ale for those who like heavily hopped ales."
"Drinkability is fantastic."
"Slightly cloudy amber ale. Hops dominate the aroma, but there is some malty sweetness. Hops dominate the taste as well, but they do not punch you in the face. The beer is somewhat thin and one-dimensional. Beyond the hops, I don't taste much else. A lttle caramel, but not much more."
"Notes: Overall it is a very solid brew and quite enjoyable."
"The only thing that makes this seem like an Amber Ale to me is the color. Otherwise it'd be any other IPA for me. All of the other Amber Ales I have ever had have much more malt characteristic that this only seems to have in color alone."
"d: I'm not a big Magic Hat fan, so it was with some reluctance that I ordered this one. Wow, just a great brew. Definitely one I would seek out again."
"about as drinkable as a standard IPA. I like this beer because it is hoppy but doesn't taste like an IPA. Definitely a good beer. Try it."
"Drinkabilitly: Good amber that goes down easily. Could down a few of these in a night without a problem."
"I have had this beer before and didn't remember it being so blah. But hey, I have developed a much greater appreciation for craft brews, so maybe my palate has evolved and I now expect more from a ""hoppy amber ale"". It didn't quite meet my expectations...so I couldn't rate it any higher."
"Another good brew by Magic Hat."
"I really like this! This may be one of my favorite Magic Hat offerings. Recommend."
"D - The balanced flavor and low ABV make this a easy drinker that I could enjoy all night. Probably the best offering from Magic Hat that I've had."
"Beer poured a pretty amber with a finger of off white foam that was short lived. Smelled hoppy, possibly Simcoe?, not sure. Also could detect malt aromas, some caramel. Tast was good with a nice bitterness. Tasted grapefruit rind like hops and a nice balancing malt. Beer was nicely carbonated and is medium bodied. Definitely could see muyself having more than a couple of these in a sitting."
"D: It tastes good, but it's ultimately not a very sessionable beer for me. I'm not a big fan of this beer's texture, at least not enough to prefer it to other holiday options available."
"Bottle pour is amber red with a thick, foamy white head. The aroma is very hoppy, all grapefruit and pinecones. The taste is an extremely balanced mix of sweet malts and citrusy hops. This is very refreshing and easily sessionable. The mouthfeel is thin and it is highly carbonated. However, it is a nice beer. I wonder why this is a winter seasonal, as it seems more geared towards the summer. """
"D: Really just an average to slightly above average amber ale. The bitterness is bigger than expected but the malt complexity is limited."
"About $8.50 a sixer."
"This is a pretty good rendition of a hoppy red ale. Smell and taste are a little off but somewhat clean. It is pretty thin in the mouth, but definitely drinkable. This is a better beer than several of Magic Hat's year-round offerings. Don't think I will revisit it unless its the only thing left at a party or a friends fridge."
"Highly recommend..."
"Drinkability? Pretty damned good. Light in alcohol, tasty, excellent head retention with plenty of lacing, call me a fan. I think it's a very nice drop!"
"D - A hoppy amber that goes down very easily."
"D - a real nice brew from magic hat. they have been slipping in recent years, but this makes me look forward to what they are coming with."
"As you would expect, this pale ale has a very bitter taste to it. Solid taste to it, nothing that really stands out, but a good solid brew. Gave it a B on my first review on 1-22-09"
"Medium amber in color, thin head that sticks to the glass through out the beer. Smells very hoppy, more like an IPA. This beer tastes like a west coast IPA to me, with the initial hop bitterness slapping my tongue. Malts come out in the aftertaste. Excellent drinkability for a winter seasonal as it is not heavily spiced or high in alcohol content. Great beer for football sundays. Normally only buy Magic Hat when its the only beer available (supermarkets, local package stores), but this is a beer of theirs that I consider to be very well crafted."
"Got this from the Magic Hat winter sampler 12 pack. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my pint glass. This beer pours a fairly cloudy copper red color. The white head is very lacy and chunky looking. It is a good inch thick or maybe more when poured. Fantastic lacing here indeed! Settles to a good 1/2 inch and eventually a solid 1/4 inch that lasts down to the last sip.. Has a sweet caramel malt and citrus hop aroma along with a touch of coffee. The taste is the same along with a bit of spice, and the sweet caramel malt and citrus hops flavor balance each other quite nicely indeed. I believe I may also detect a hint of clove and banana here too. Very nice! Crisp, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Extremely easy to drink in the way well crafted beers should be. I really enjoyed this one!"
"Good choice."
"d - Considering it doesn't have a very complex flavor other than on the swallow, this is a hoppy beer I could actually have a few of. Real hop fans are probably left wanting more. Not overly carbonated."
"Rich copper red with a solid rocky head. Lots of maltiness waft out along with a hint of coffee, caramelized sugars and a touch of tobacco. Feels spritzy with an acidic edge. Flavour leans towards the hops although toasted grains are noticeable. Some nuttiness comes through as well. Finishes dry with a somewhat bitter and quite husky aftertaste. Easy to put down a lot of these but a bit harsh of a harsher mouthfeel."
"A low alcohol content, delightful hop aroma, balanced flavor and a finish that keeps asking for more all combine to make this a superb quaff and a welcome break from the typical malty, spicy winter brews. Highly recommended."
"Magic Hat has surprised me with this one. I haven't had a beer from them for a while now as I just haven't been impressed lately... maybe this will change that. Well done, very drinkable and tasty amber."
"This beer pours a an amber-ish color with a nice sticky head. Great retention and a wide array of spotty lace all over the glass. Nose is pleasantly interesting. Mostly of hops, it has slim air of malt, but heavy on pine. Taste matches the nose pretty well - the pine taste is definitely present but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is very textured with a sharp, sudden, but brief bitterness. This beer goes down quite easily. I could definitely have this as a session beer."
"Because of the complexity of this ale, I was surprised that it was only 5 % ABV. Having said that the strong flavors keep this one from being a true session ale. Very good."
"T- Excellent, this is a good brew."
"Pours a very nice deep amber color with some good head, although no lacing. Nice scent, malty and deep, with a large hoppy aroma. Same with the taste, although a lot of the normal red ale was covered up by the hops; hop characteristics were also odd, but from being in an odd style or from a mix-match, I'm not sure. Goes down pretty good, though. Not my favorite, but I would never turn one down."
"My wife pick this beer up in Akron Ohio. Beer pours reddish brown color with a two finger creamy white head. Smells of hops right off, citrus and pine. The taste is hoppy with a biscut and malty flavor at the finish, very smooth. I really like the way they merge hoppy, seasonal and malty. This beer has the best of both worlds for me, and for a good seasonal brew. I think this beer extremely drinkable i just wish i could get it around here."
"A good beer from start to finish. The nice hop flavor stays through the beer. Good if your in the mood for a hoppy flavored beer."
"D - A fairly easy-drinking amber ale with a nice hop bouquet. I'm enjoying the mix of herbal and grassy hop notes, a combination I haven't found in my recent tastings. The overall complexity of flavors could use some improvement and a drier finish might improve drinkability. I might order a second though not a third."
"Overall-good beer, I like the balance, all aspects are well made, it's slightly different. Good work."
"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading head that laces the glass.Aroma is grassy hops.Taste is hops,grass and a hint of grapefruit.It does go down pretty smoothly.Overall a decent beer but nothing great.It was nice to try once but I doubt I will ever buy again!!"
"Drinkability is high on this one. A good session beer."
"Notes - My favorite Magic Hat thus far."
"Light/medium in body and quaffable."
"Medium body allows this one to be a quencher or a sipper. Nice clean finish, no off notes. Overall, I can put a few of these back if I'm in the mood for a hop-dominant beer. Very well worth the try."
"Not a bad beer here, could it all day."
"poured from bottle into pint glass--burnt orange in appearance with a lovely off-white head. Delicious aroma of piney hops and grapefruit-initial rush of hops with lingering spice ending in a nice, clean finish. Surprisingly good flavor and drinkability- nice lacing and at 5.1 abv, good potential as a session beer. Would definitely buy this beer again-Yum!"
"HV"
"D-Overall a pleasant and drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is good. I probably wouldn't go right to this beer, but would drink it if I happened upon it."
"Mouthfeel is lacking. Feels very watery to me and the carbonation is ""off."" Medium bodied, feels very light in the mouth. It's drinkable however, and is a refreshing and enjoyable brew."
"The relative smoothness makes this so utterly drinkable, although it still has gritty, chalky qualities. It's delicious, if intense. Really bitter, really woody. A tad too extreme but delicious."
"A very steady performer. One of the few ambers that I enjoy drinking."
"Drinkability: For me it was an average beer with a bit of extra bitterness, and though I was certainly ready to give my love to this beer, particularly as it's the Season of Giving, but, well, I just didn't care for it."
"Overall a surprise coming from a sampler , recommended."
"Bottle decants a mostly clear copper body with a healthy offwhite head. Attractive spiderweb lacing is all over the glass. Pleasant aroma opens with fruity peach, quickly followed by a blast of spicy pepper and some toasted caramel. Medium body and carbonation with an earthy feel. Taste has some fruity peach and subtle caramel and plenty of hop bitterness. Hops impart elements of citrus, pine, and spicy pepper. Rather exciting for an amber. Very drinkable."
"This is how I like my Red Ales to be. They must have a solid hop profile and this one stands up. Again, very easy to drink and I would buy this in the six pack format. This one came in a 12 pack variety mix."
"Not the most complex of beers, but certainly one I could drink all night."
"Drinkability - This is a beer that defines what craft is all about, so kudos for that. But it's not one I want to drink again. However, I could see others liking it"
"This has more hop flavor than I thought it would. There is a citrusy smell to it. It has some pine flavors that linger. I enjoy it quite a lot but it's walking a fine line between being tasty and being too bitter. That's not a bad thing though, as it's probably what they were going for. I think I'll pick up a 6-pack before the season is over."
"Poured a murky copper with a well-carbonated one-finger head with sheath lacing down the entire glass. A hint of malts mixed in with mild peppery spice notes along with citrus in the aroma. For a red this seemed like a hop bomb; large citric hop base along with spices in a medium body produce a smooth yet really dry beer. Hints of roasted and/or caramel malts add a dash of sweeetness. This is a great beer that I wish they wouldn't just make as a seasonal."
"Drinkability: An easy-drinking amber ale. The nice caramel malt adds a smoothness throughout each sip that pulls together the citrus flavors and hops."
"relatively new to this style of ale, new in a sense i don't have it too often. i really enjoy this beer though. i feel as though latley magic hat has been a bit disapointing with some of the beers i've been trying. im still not over blindfaith's departure. i found this beer to have a great look, nice dark amber color with a beige head that leaves some nice rings around the glass for coming out of a bottle. the smell was much hoppier and floral than i expected. it seems to have that distinct smell i associate with magic hat. the taste was equally a nice suprise. for a winter ale i've gotten accoustomed to heavy, malt based beer warmers. this beer has a great body, perfect balance between heavy and light. the taste certainly seems to be hop driven at first, but ends with a nice sweet buttery flavor. find this beer to also be a great session beer, light enough not to be overly filling. the alcohol seems to be perfect too for a night of roxy roles. nice approach to a winter ale for sure."
"Notes: Overall, a very nice Red Ale that has a good balance to it, making it a nice inexpensive alternative to your stand-by winter brew. Doesn't quite surpass Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale IMO, but most definitely worth getting every winter. I had this last winter as well and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even if #9 has gone downhill lately, Magic Hat isn't slacking with this one."
"D - This is a good seasonal from Magic Hat...I will be keeping an eye out for this one before it goes away until next year"
"Bottle in trade from ROBORB. Thanks man. Pours a reddish orange hazy color with a short to medium lived beige head. Smell is rye like zesty malts with a spicy, fresh earthiness to the hops. Taste is a dull rye and caramel like sweetness with earthy dry, hoppiness. Some grapefruit like flavor too. Moderately smooth with a light lingering bitterness. Not really an amber, but still nice. Medium bodied with normal carbonation a level. Pretty solid beer overall."
"Pretty bitter and a bit of a heavy drop into the stomach. I've certainly had a few of these in a row before but it lacks drinkability (as most hoppy beers do)"
"D: This is a very tasty seasonal from Magic Hat. Nothing over the top, but solid character. I like this one. Easy to drink but certainly not pedestrian."
"Not the best Magic Hat Ive had but a pretty good one. A little harsh and bitter for me. The bitterness and strength of the hops could have been better balanced by the underlying flavors. Having trouble distinguishing what else was in there, Not as smooth as I would have liked. A beautiful red amber color and off white head. Pretty good after taste."
"Drinkability: As all of Magic Hat's brews are (as a result of Vermont laws, I imagine), this one's low in alcohol, and quite sessionable as a result. It's just a solid, all-around earthy, hoppy amber, and though it's not my favorite hoppy amber - it's no Nugget Nectar - it's a good beer."
"The drinkability was off the charts. Last year I didn't really care for this, but this year my palate is developed enough to really enjoy it. If you like fresh hoppy beers, this is a must try."
"Got this in a mixed winter pack from Magic Hat. Poured amber with a reddish/orange tint and a pretty short head that sticsk around as a thin cap and leaves some spotty lacing. Smells malty with a bit of red fruit and then the hit of citrusy hops. Pretty much as billed- a hoppy red ale. The taste as well is quite fruity both from the red ale grain bill and from the citrusy hops. Smooth and slightly grainy and with a gentle but sustained bitterness. This is a little bit different and I find I like this more than I thought I would. I think the cereal grain sweetness and the citrusy hops work pretty well together, giving the beer a bit of candied grapefruit peel flavor and a touch of raspberry like sweetness. Gentle and pleasing, this works well as a winter beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear red brew. Thick head lasts very well, with average amounts of sticky lacing. Aroma is fresh hop fruity pine goodness. Taste is substantially bitter from beginning to end, with strong citrus in the middle. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy, and drinkability is good. Nice red."
"I've been told that this is Magic Hat's ""christmas ale," even though the label indicates otherwise. Either way, it's simply excellent. The characteristics are a bit strange for what I would expect from a seasonal brew of this style (more along the ""nutty"" or ""earthy"" line), but it's too well balanced to chide it for that. A must-try if you haven't had it already."
"D- Decent drinkability enjoyable overall a solid beer."
"D: I frankly could not finish the whole bottle. I could tell it was a quality beer, but it's just not my style."
"very drinkable especially in the winter cold"
"I'm generally not a fan of Magic Hat -- too sweet and bland. This is something else altogether. Smooth notes of carmel and maybe a hint of some candied fruit. Beautiful mouthfeel -- really doesn't overpower as it fades to a nice hoppy finish. Well done Magic Hat."
"Right up there with Ithaca Cascazilla for hoppy amber/red ales. Didn't quite know what to expect from this brew, which turned out to but spicier and more pine laden than Lucky Kat, but not really season or style specific for a winter brew. Good and intriguing."
"The apricot/fruity aroma and flavor is too strong for me, it throws off the balance. If they reduced that, this could be an outstanding beer."
"Why not a winter seasonal that tastes like Christmas trees? 'Tis the season."
"Drinkability: A drinkable beer and something I would like to enjoy in the future. Not necessarily the first thing that comes to mind, but I definitely recommend it. It has a unique character like other Magic Hat beers."
"But in all, this is quite good, well worth trying, and is another winner from Magic Hat. I'm more fond of Red's Rye from Founder's, but this is certainly no slouch. Yet another reason why I've been won over to red ales, thankfully."
"Cheers!!"
"Sometimes I think we give too much credit to the extreme alcohol beers and not enough credit to these ""low"" alcohol brews. This is a good example of packing a lot of flavor and nuance into what many would think is a ""simple"" beer category."
"Overall this is a solid beer by Magic Hat, and a bit hoppier on tap. Solid beer that I would drink anytime."
"Nice clear beer. They filter well at this brewery. The head remains atop a reddish body with ample carbonation. The bottle says a hoppy amber ale. It definitely hits upon the American Red Ale with a nose of earthy, almost piney hop notes. The taste is caramel notes finishing with hops on the tongue. Is this a winter warmer asks the Alstrom brothers? I think not. A drinkable red ale that delivers the goods. Keep up the good work Magic Hat."
"After trying a few mediocre beers from Magic Hat, the last two I've had (this and Jinx), have been excellent. This is an excellent winter beer that I plan on having on hand for the rest of the season."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It has a beutiful pour, a pretty amber color topped by overabundant head. The head is thick, and frothy with excellent retention. The lacing is also exceptional. I was disappointed by the lack of aroma. There is a mild evergreen scent, but it is way to muted IMO. The flavor is good, a nice hoppy start on the palate with a dry finish. Roxy is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This is a beer I could drink all night."
"D - This is an all around great beer, maybe the best I've had from Magic Hat. It's nothing extreme or terribly unique, but it is a shining example of balance in a hoppy amber. Worth seeking out."
"Very standard tasting amber flavor to start, with a nice hoppy finish similar to a Pale Ale, not quite as tasty as a India Pale Alle. The head holds quite well, I poured with too much head and it stayed throughout the first 1/2 of my drinking, and the beer appears a very rich reddish color. The only thing I didn't really like about this beer is that it could use a little more carbonation to help in the mouth feel. Over all I would probably buy this beer again but not adding it to one of my favorites."
"I drank some Roxy Rolles in a winter mix pack from Magic Hat. Needless to say i wasn't impressed. The flavor is way too overwhelming and forces you to take your time drinking it. Certainly not a easily drinkable beer. I kept having to switch in between with the other beers in the pack. Not sure what yeast they used but it was way too dry and had way too much body. Try it once and then leave it."
"What a beautiful brew! Pours a beautiful deep deep red amber, I can't state this enough. The head billows up to huge 4 finger pillows and leaves a very arrogant style of lacing. With each drink the head leaves a curtain-like drape of lacing on the glass that is just mesmerizing! The smell and taste is as if you went to a nursery, grabbed a handful of flowers and stuffed them in your mouth. The hops are so incredibly fresh that it's just indescribable (aside from what I said in the last sentence). It could be the benchmade cigar or it could be the crisp autumn air that arrested the majority of my tastebuds but all I could taste from this one is pure, fresh hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Drinkability is incredibly high, I don't know what else to say. Definitely a winner here."
"Overall this is far and away my favorite Magic Hat that I've had to date. Be sure to pick this one up if you see it around."
"5.8abv"
"D- I am not a red ale fan but this brew is quite nice. I would actually buy a case of this. Very good and adds detail to the fridge."
"Drinkability: This one is very enjoyable, you'd expect a Magic Hat brew to be very uncanny yet this beer is a perfect blend of winter goodness. The use of fruit in this is done perfectly, Magic Hat should pat themselves on the back for making a seasonal brew thats enjoyable to drink, isn't boring, and easy to quaff."
"The taste is quite good. This is a mid to light beer with a nice balance between hoppy esters and orange citrus and rind. The hops are not overly bitter, certainly not over the top, and produce just a nice floral and oily presence on the tongue. The orange burst is also quite present but subdued and well balanced. Underneath are the roasted, peaty qualities that make this a characteristic red ale. The hop and orange burst up front makes this an interesting interpretation of the style well worth seeking out. It is not a strong beer, sweet but not cloying, with a mouthfeel that is a touch oily from the hops but quite mild in the aftertaste. This is a good, interesting beer well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"M+D---smooth and a bit creamy...lingers on the palate for a minute...very easily drinkable and i will be getting more and drinkin this beer for a while to come as long as they dont change the recipe..."
"Steady carbonation with a decent malt body add to good drinkability and a worthy offering from Magic Hat. This is one of the better beers from their mixed 12 pack."
"This beer is a clear ruby-amber color with a thick and foamy beige head that has good retention. Sticky patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malt and piney hops. Medium-bodied and dry with flavors of hops, pine and spices along with a light malt base. The finish is moderately bitter at first but leaves a sweet malt aftertaste. This is a fairly enjoyable Amber all around."
"Once again, Magic Hat always hits me with a curveball. You go in thinking this will be the standard red ale thats very malty with a caramel taste, but this one is different. While it does have those tastes t has other unique ones as well. All in all, it's a great drinking experience and a solid beer from a solid brewery."
"Bought a sixer of this to help me through the dark winter. Out of the bottle this beer was a dark amber color with a beige head about a finger and a half thick. Good lacing but only so-so retention. The aromas were orange peel, citrus hops and some caramel malts. The flavors were a little woody, citrus hops, and some caramel malts with a bit of bready character. Rather diverse in this regard and well balanced. Crisp finish with a certain minerality. Medium bodied, smooth a and quite drinkable. An unusual beer as amber go but I appreciate it for it's uniqueness."
"D: A moderately drinkable beer, 1 or 2 is plenty. A ho-hum drink at best."
"This is going to be a repeat buy for me..A very good brew that keeps the taste buds busy!"
"I would not only drink this again but I plan on returning to the store and buying the rest of it to serve next month at my beer dinner."
"This brew poured to a nice amber colored hue with many red highlights. Good sized tan head that had good retention and left a good amount of lacing. The aroma seems to be dominated by the hops which seem to give more of a pine like scent. Some malt aroma there as well but very hard to pick up. The flavors are similar to the aroma except that malts come out more here and are at the front end giving a biscuit like flavor. The hops really stick out and stay around even after the sip is long gone. The hop flavor is more pine like IMO but seem to have a slightly odd finish but that probably is just me. Overall not a bad brew from Magic hat but must say not my favorite but it is good to see them still producing something things that stick out."
"Had a grilled burger on the plate and opted to raid the host's refrigerator (thanks ""J") to see what I could find. Hadn't had this Magic Hat offering yet, so opted to try it. Nice copper color, a bit of carbonation though little froth. The attraction was the ""hops"" listed on the label. A great combination with BBQ food. A bit of a malt at first in the nose, but then a nice floral/pine hops smell. Taste was amazingly balanced. Really nice hops taste, but not overpowering. Extremely enjoyable. Magic Hat does a lot of things well. This is definitely one of them."
"The colour is a beautiful deep copper, poured from the bottle to the tulip glass with a weak head that disappeared quickly. A sweet malty flavour to the taste, but a pine-like nose. This one was nice to taste, but probably not be in the favourites collection for me."
"Drinkability is decent. Not as easy to knock out as the HIPA."
"Drinkability - not a session beer for me, more of a hot-weather-make-me-forget-about-it-with-this-huge-taste kind of thing. A well put together beer, just not my favorite."
"Bottle dated May 2008."
"Right on par for the style. Not overly hopped where it would take its toll on the tastebuds, but a very satisfying amber."
"Ever so hoppy, wonderfully so. Feels a bit lighter then most beers with a hop taste of this caliber but the tastes is bold of hops pine biscuits and citrus. Smell is of pine and hops. Simply is amazing. At 5.80ABV and a taste like this I'd say its the most drinkable beer I've had in quite some time."
"Think Arrogant Bastard's little brother and your on the right track. One Of Magic Hats best IMHO."
"Very tasty, a bit like Nugget Nectar, but more malt and less hops. Probably a more balanced amber, but not as good as the Nugget, IMO."
"This is a beer that I could drink all night. Well-balanced, tasty, a good brew."
"A rosey clear copper color with a big tan head and heavy lace. The aroma is just big grapefruit hops with an interesting sweet bread touch, very nice. This has a wonderfully full feel and delivers all the citrus hops that the aroma promised. Just solid with even carbonation and tinges of spicey sweetness. Complex but rooted in the hops bitterness, although it does not overload or hide the full flavor that you can sink your teeth into. Plenty drinkable for such a hoppy brew. Another Magic Hat masterpiece."
"Pours an amber color with a thin lace of head. Smell has hoppy aromas and quite fruity also. Taste is quite hoppy, but has lots of malts to smooth it out too. Mouthfeel is quite tingly on the tongue as well as bitter. This is one excellent beer. Probably a little hoppier than you might expect, but otherwise tasty."
"Overall, a very drinkable offering from Magic Hat, one of the better brews to be released from them in the last few years in my humble opinion."
"Drinkability: Not being a big fan of ambers and having been disappointed by more than one Magic Hat brews, I didn't think I would be at all excited by this beer. Boy, was I wrong. Very nice effort and one of the best ambers out there"
"Overall a great beer for Magic Hat."
"The pour was a brilliant amber red with a nice two finger lacy head with great head retention to follow. The hop aroma was very pungent with notes of caramel and oranges. The taste was nice. A great balance of hops, citrus flavors, and yeast/dough. It is a hop dominant beer, but the other flavors make for a interesting mix. It is a full bodied beer and a great seasonal. Highly drinkable and great tasting!"
"Well this is probably the best thing in the Mardi Gras sampler. Appearance was great: dark amber red with eventual solid lacing from its big head. The aromas are sharp malts and hops mixed wonderfully together. Some fruity smells, as well, were sensed. The taste is wicked malty and bitter, but there is a sweet aftertaste from a pure sugarish-taste. The mouthfeel was a little bit weak but it helps in making the drink's malty flavors more apparent instead of a carbonation. Overall, definitely the best thing I have had from Magic Hat."
"Note: The hops were not too bitter and I loved,loved this beer. The smell,the feel and the taste was spectacular. I am not a fan of IPA's, yet this was so well balanced I could not resist."
"Very well crafted."
"Pours deep red/amber, not surprisingly. Decent head. Smells real hoppy, with some big juicy grapefruit. Grapefruity hops in the taste too, though with a marked destinction from that of cascades. Simcoes have this kind of aspriny/hard candy like sweetness that I don't always enjoy but Magic Hat definitely pulls it off. This is just as much an IPA as a red ale in terms of the monstrous hop profile. Pretty bitter, though enjoyably. Nothing too amazing in the mouthfeel, but nice. Smooth at the least. I Could definitely drink a bunch of these. It's not really the most stand-out hoppy red ale - in a store full of IPAs I'd probably go with something else. Nevertheless, its still a solid brew. This beer definitely satisfies cravings as a hophead and I'm glad to have it."
"Thanks johnnnniee-I'll look out for more Magic Hat offerings in the future."
"Impressive beer, especially since I am usually suspect of amber ales because of their cronic under hopped rated and oversparged grain flavors. This beer does not fall into either catagory, giving a bold pine / citrus hop flavor, substantial bitterness and a strong pine nose. The malts are equally as bold, providing a strong malt, caramel, toffee, bready pillow for the hops without waivering late. Firm and smooth textures keep the beer creamy throughout. Well headed and an overall sturdy look throughout. Finishes malty with a clean, crisp pine flavor. Best Amber I've had in a long time."
"Taste has a strong citrus hop presence but is balanced nicely by a slight fruitiness and a malt backbone, very crisp taste with a perfect amount of carbonation."
"Enjoy by April 2008 on side of bottle. Nice 2 fingers of off-white froth. Semi-clear beautiful amber hue. Aroma of juicy hops & Italian leather. Crisp floral hoppy flavor...nice grapefruit without being too cloying. Somewhat of a chalky hop mouthfeel. Easy drinking...nice lacing"
"Wow, I've been pretty down on Magic Hat lately, but this beer really impressed me. Just a fantastic hoppy presence and a delicioius drinkibility. I will seek some more of this out in the future."
"Wanted to love this beer! Pours a deep amber with full reddish, off-white colored head, and it holds. Especially good looking for MH! All hops in aroma, grapefruity, and much like 60 minute IPa but earthier aromas too. Taste is strong american IPA with amber earthiness, and it is, dare I say, appraching balanced for a style that insinuates senseless amounts of hoppiness. resinous, tongue-coating fresh hope flavor lingers, and there the balance ends...it lasts a long time, the malt backbone cannot compete with the lingering hop intensity. Moutfheel is very full, but drinability is low for me as I cant have a full one in a single sitting, but it's great for what it is and wonderful to see a more amber-leaning IPA...where else can you go with IPA's anyway, except give the malt a twist? The hops overwhelm the subtle differences of course, but the difference it's there for hop lovers to enjoy...I won't be stocking this, but can recommend it to the few people I know who are crazy about hoppy beers."
"12oz bottle purchased from Clarendon Wines in Boston. Consumed in Feb 08 with an April 08 best before date. Pours a rich copper with decent head. A faint hop aroma that turns maltier as it warms. Flavour is middle-of-the-road with a decent malt backbone along with some hoppiness, though not a lot. Another meh Magic Hat offering."
"I got a sixer of this a few months ago and set one aside cause it deserves a review. Pours a dark reddish copper with a finger of thick head which recedes to a foamy surface film with nice lacing. The aroma is light without any one overpowering scent, mix of citrusy hops and nutty malt. Agree with other reviews that the taste is more of the same, quality amber ale malt with a little sweetness, and just the right amount of finishing hops to give it a unique bitterness. Good mouthfeel with a nice bite of carbonation, and with the moderate abv this is def a brew I could session. Just a high quality amber ale with the extra hops that set it apart."
"A fairly nice beer; Magic Hat is hit or miss, and this is no home run, but a solid base hit."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a deep coppery-red color with a brown tint in the background. Thick fluffy off-white head with excellent retention and lots of sticky lacing. Strong presence of apricots immediately fill the nostrils as well as some citrus fruit (grapefruit?) and a subtle hoppy/floral presence. Taste similar to nose, with apricot flavor much more mellowed in the mouth. Citrus astringency is much more pronounced as is the hops bite at the end. Lively, tingly mouthfeel leaves a crisp feeling in the mouth between sips. This is an excellent offering from MH, and makes a great session brew. I was particularly impressed as I don't normally drink hoppy brews."
"Magic Hat can let me down at times but they can still bring it with many of their brews, and certainly with this one. It's great to still have it around as a seasonal but I'd love to see it turn into a year round brew. Definitely a solid brew from Magic Hat."
"D: A solid choice, one of the more flavorful amber/red ales I've tried. One I'd probably have again, though I like mine a little more on the malty-sweet side. Big thanks, Jeff."
"Thanks to (will fill in blank when I find out) for the extra!"
"Got this one in a make your own sixer at Trader Joe's. Pours a nice looking deep purply amber with a nice head and a good bit of nice looking lacing. Nose is fairly mild, a nice balance of hops and slightly roasted malt. Taste is really tasty. Nice almost grapy fruitiness in the hops, with solid caramel dirty malt flavor. A nice surprise. Body is good, medium bodied, with good carbonation. This one was really a tasty treat. I'm usually fairly so-so on Magic Hat, but this is one of the better offerings of their's I've tried."
"One of the better Magic Hat beers I tasted tonight, usually not a big fan of this style of beer but this was rather enjoyable, recommended for all the hopheads out there"
"Bought this as part of the Mardi Gras 12 pack. Poured into an official Magic Hat glass. The beer had about a half inch of dark creamy head with a lot of lacing. The color of the beer is a ruddy dark red with almost an orange hue to it and no little bubbles floating up. Definitely the appearance of a dark red ale. I smell a lot of grapefruity hops coming off this. The taste of the beer is ok. I'm not a huge hop fan though. There's definitely a lot of deep complex flavor to this beer. My first senses are the grapefruit at the top of the tongue. As I hold it in my mouth I can feel the alcohol and carbonation wash that taste away. All thats left is a lightly bitter flavor in my mouth. There seems to be an almost acidic bite to the beer. Its very much a sipping type beer since it seems higher in alcohol than it is. To me this beer is a little overbearing in hops. I'd prefer a less harsh beer than this in this type of style."
"...like HopBack with a winter coat on. MMMM."
"The beer poured into a dark amber color with a small head that persisted, barely, and left a nice lacing in the glass. It smelled distinctly of hops, I knew I was in for a good beer. The taste was a delightful and lively balance between citrus hops, malt, and wild yeast. They managed to pack in a lot of flavor and keep it well balanced in this very drinkable brew. Bravo."
"Serving this one cold after any easy pour, a smooth soft off-white head formed to a quarter inch. This quickly settled and revealed a hazy amber to light brown beverage. Herbal and floral hops are present up front on the nose and with it a generous hit of toasted malty goodness. It really has an appealing smell and then there is the taste. Smooth, medium bodied and well balanced this beer does not come off too bitter or too sweet. Some great toffee flavors combine well with the citrusy american hops. Found this one to be very delicious and worth buying a case of. Happened to be having a very garlicky chicken soup while downing a few of these and it paired well."
"Pours a rich amber with a nice head and excellent lacing. Smell is a nice blend of hops and rich yeasty aromas. Taste is hops, hops, hops throughout with a dry finish. Mouthfeel and drinkabilty are above average, the dry quality adding to th eoverall rating."
"D: Good enough... the flavour could start to seem a little overwhelming after perhaps 3 or 4, but I would drink it until it reached that point without complaint."
"Comparable to Clipper City's - Small Craft"
"Recommended."
"Not acceptable. The aroma is nice, but the taste is horrible. Down the drain this one goes. I have to give Magic Hat kudos for being singlehandedly the worst brewery I've experienced in the last 5 years."
"Would probably find this in regular rotation if it were available in my neck of the woods."
"Overall this is a great brew, and I have to say one of the best I have had from this brewery. Another great offering from Magic Hat."
"smooth with decent carbonation that gives a little kick and enhances the hop, although at the expense of malt balance."
"This one set up well for me but seemed to dissapoint in the end. Maybe it will appeal to someone else, but it didn't do it for me."
"Pours a nice red amber color with a thick tan head. It has a nice floral hoppy aroma that really gives it a nice smell. The taste is good with a sweet malty base followed by a wallop of hops in the end. It is a nice bitter beer that is great for a red ale. It has a nice mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation and it is a fairly drinkable red ale. Worth a try on this one."
"This is a very tasty, well balanced beer. It's not extremely bitter and the hops are quite tasty."
"D: This is a great red ale, very balanced, and very tasty. Props to Magic Hat on this one. Hope they keep it up."
"D -- not too overpowering while still flavorful...could have a few of these without changing any of the enjoyment from the first one."
"Overall- It was a nice switch from spiced or malty winter brews. I'm a little concerned with the trend of hop loading every style of beer though."
"T: Recently having had a Nugget Nectar, I can't help comparing the two. This is very smooth and medium bodied with mild carbonation. The bitterness from hops is much more present and this beer is not as sweet as NN. Sweetness from citrus fruit but not tart. From start to finish it's the hops in this that dominate the taste for me. Like the smell, there is a slightly unpleasant taste of alcohol for me that keeps me from rating this higher. Definitely one of the better beers I've had from Magic Hat, but I would still take NN over this any day. Regardless, definitely worth a try and I would get this again."
"Pours a cloudy brown/amber, decent off white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring, not much lace to speak of. Smell is nice, very sweet malts, caramel, brown sugar, pine and grapefruit, very fruity, quite a complex nose, lots of aroma. Taste is nice as well, spicy, bready malt, wheat, some pine, grapefruit, nice and easy to drink, lacks punch though. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, very smooth, enough to be interesting."
"Pours a hazy dark amber with a nice head working down to some really nice lacing. The smell is of light caramel grass, and a good whack of piny hops. The taste features some grainy caramel malts and citrus hop flavors with some earthy notes and a lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is good for a session brew, and so is the drinkability. I was not sold on this beer last year, but i have grown to really appreciate it this season. Magic hat needs to put this in their mix packs and do away with Circus Boy."
"D- i've had ups and down with magic hat...all their flagship beers scored pretty low with me, but the hopped up ones: hIPA, & this here roxy rolles shows me that the department that matters most is receiving the attention that it deserves."
"A surprisingly refreshing take on what can be a somewhat bland genre (amber ales), this beer combines the citrus and flowery American hops with a sturdy spice profile to create a faux-winter-APA. The malt balances out the flavor of the beer nicely. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but overall fitting. This is an enjoyable seasonal and nice change of pace."
"Overall it's a bit too unique for me to drink often. Very enjoyable but could never be a staple in my fridge."
"The packaging is very cool with Roxy Rolles coming straight at you on her Harley. ""A winter amber ramble of sweet caramelized malt and spicy hops for those who make their own road"" is written on the 6-pack container. The beer pours reddish amber and hazy. The head is sticky goodness. Aroma is skunk weed and aromatic orange citrus fruits such as mandarins and clementines. Sweet malt and fruitiness from the yeast are in the background. Taste is explosive and includes the aforementioned wet cannabis and citrus as well as a strong foundation of sweet and sticky candied malt and a yeast fruitiness in the canned peach, dried apricot range.A fine bubble ale carbonation makes this brew go down very easy and I don't think I will be the first to say""I wish it was a year round offering."" or ""I hope this beer isn't affected by the hop shortage."" Keep on rolling Roxy!"
"drinkablility is outstanding. though not extensively fascinating, nor quenching of extreme hop lovers masochistic tendencies, i find this quite satisfying in a non overwhelming way. beer to drink with dinner, not for dinner. i like to cook and find that overly agressive beers are hard to enjoy with food. this one is not. big hit on homemade pizza night."
"D - Not a session brew, but a good departure from the norm. It is for sure worth a try, and a good selection from Magic Hat"
"As far as I'm concerned, only the outstanding Thumbsucker can compete with this offering when it comes to Magic Hat beer. Roxy Rolles is an inspired creation that was built with the Simcoe-loving hophead in mind. If I had access, this would be a winter 'case beer' for sure."
"Overall, a very decent beer."
"Overall- I really like this one alot. I am a hop head, so this one really does me right. I cannot wait to pick up more of this stuff. Thanks to ineedabeerhere for trading with me and allowing me to try this."
"The beer poured a rather hazy, reddish color into a pint glass with a thick, 1/2 inch tan head. The smell was of citrusy hops. The initial taste was of lots of up-front hop flavor, dissipating to a smooth hop bitterness on the sides and back of the tongue, with a freshly-baked bread aftertaste. The hop bitterness dissipated rather quickly - just in time for another mouthful. Lacing was thick down the side of the glass. Pretty hoppy for a red ale, but very drinkable. Had to take points off for the cloudy appearance of the beer, but besides that a very enjoyable brew."
"Pours deep ruby, amber, chill haze, decent head but dissipates pretty quickly. Nose is hoppy, citrus flavoring, some sweet malty bread as well. Labeled as a hoppy amber, it delivers as advertised. Seems like it is loaded with Cascade hops (my guess), almost like an IPA with a heavy citrus hop and dry aftertaste. But there are definite malty and nutty undertones that balance out the hops, with some caramel as well, reminding you of its amber foundation. Mouthfeel was surprisingly full and slick, chewy. I liked the balance of this beer, pretty drinkable. Id get it again."
"D- A decent brew, could be smoother, otherwise a decent brew."
"cheers"
"I thought this brew was ok and it made a better pale ale then anything else. The combination of the other characteristics didnt shine through like I was expecting though."
"Hoppy Amber Ale or American Winter Warmer? It has a bit of a northwest flare but still holding on to the Magic Hat traits. Either way, I highly recommend this drinkable ale."
"Poured into a pint glass from 12 oz bottle. Deep copper color with a thin head that dissolves into a cloudy haze that remains throughout. Berry-like hop aroma hits the nose hard. Tastes like a sweeter version of Ithaca's Cascazilla. Fairly well balanced for a hopped up ale."
"Overall Impression: A Christmas beer like Sierra Nevadas Celebration, which is to say not a traditional approach, but very festive and enjoyable. Massive hop taste without much bitter, a very enjoyable brew."
"Another unique beer put out by magic hat. Pours amber in color with a white/tan thick head that quickly dissapates. The aroma is interesting, floral citrus hops with an apricot fruitiness that balances the hop aroma. In the flavor the hops are more pronounce leaning toward the citrus side with the apricot flavor in the background. Creamy mouthfeel with mid-level carbonation. Overall a very drinkable beer, not a typical amber ale, but I think what makes it different makes it worth seeking out."
"overall a pretty good beer, but magic hat makes better. not too strong amongst the holiday brews."
"D: Definitely a great beer to bring to a BYOB event. Wonderful taste and at 5.8% you won't be legless after a few. Definitely try this one, not to heavy in any direction!"
"I got this one in a winter 2007 Magic Hat Mardi Gras Mix pack. I think Magic Hat is hugely under rated, anyone leary of Magic Hat will be sold on this one. Full of Hops and very drinkable, I could swill these any time. Hope I spelled leary correct! The rest of the mix pack is equally good or just score a sixer."
"Smooth and slick and very drinkable."
"Pours a foggy reddish amber. Oh, man. This nose. Talk about grass. Just a huge pile of freshly cut green grass in it's prime. At the same time it is spicy, and for the love of me, I can't pinpoint what precisely it is. As I was pouring it I got a whiff and just had to focus on it for a while. It calms down fairly soon, so get it while the gettin's good. Flavor is massively earthy and robust. Has a nice leafy tone to it and a firm hop quality to it as well. Stays very consistent throughout. Feel has some good carbonation to it and a liquid feel that is very good as well. Overall this is a good drink. Definitely worth trying, especially to get a whiff of that oh-so-unique nose. Suggested."
"I enjoyed this beer, so for drinkability, I would definitley say ""Yes, give me another!"""
"I'd recommend this beer, but it hardly knocked my socks off. I bought this beer at Brew&Brew in North Ridgeville, OH. The good people of Magic Hat recommended I drink it before May 2008."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but not great either. Starts pretty strong with hoppy smells and taste upfront, but fades rapidly with little ot back it up."
"D - Nice appearance, some good lace. Smells good, but the taste is average. It tastes like an IPA."
"In all respects an average brew... wasn't blown away by this one and wouldn't purchase another sixer again... Wasn't crazy about Magic Hat's Circus Boy offering, and this one really didn't do it for me either... all in all, a mediocore brew which wasn't entirely poor, but not outstanding either... The appearance was a dark brown copper color which poured with no head, even after swirling the last two-thirds of the bottle... The smell was somewhat bland... basically just about average... the taste was peculiar... hard to describe but a little medicinal... the mouthfeel and drinkability were okay but nothing to write home about... this beer tastes sweet and has a slightly bitter aftertaste... an interesting brew to sample, but wouldn't spend another $8 bucks on a sixer... Worth a try if you are a fan of Magic Hat..."
"D: nice beer, not outstanding. I will be having a few more of these this afternoon"
"Overall, a good beer, but nothing special. More like a pale ale than a red."
"D: this hop devil errrr... i mean roxy rolles is pretty decent. Drinkable? yea definitely, i could knock back a few of these. Would i buy a whole case? thats another story."
"Flavor, you ask? Sweet, chewy candied malts, caramel, floral & fruity yeasts, and a nice hoppy bite to round out the experience. Mouthfeel is fairly decent: thinnish-medium body with a decent carbonation level and a good, lingering hop note as it goes down. Drinkability is quite high for this amber, as it is with many of Magic Hat's brews. It's not overly complex, but packs enough flavor and character change to keep the senses entertained. Definately easy to put away a few at a time, and have no reservations about going back for more in the future."
"saw their feast of fools sampler and gave it a shot, they've always got interesting brews ; pours a med brownish-amber color w/ a nice stiff, light brown, one finger head which lingers most of the way down leaving a thick lacing all the way down my pint glass ; a powerful floral/citrus hop aroma coming across as a little ""cattish", not any discernible maltieness ; a thick hoppy flavor w/ a tart bite rather than bitter, a slight caramel note somewhere deep underneath, i get a pear-like fruit undertone as well ; a rich, med. bodied beer just under cloying, the dextrin level in this beer is a bit much, i kinda like it though ; a fairly drinkable brew, much better than alot of Am. ambers, another good, wierd beer from the wizards at Magic Hat..."
" A definite seasonal must have for me. Great!!!"
"The bottom line: Magic Hat has put together one hell of a fine amber here. It has a great hop presence without overwhelming the malts, and a delightfully full body, all at a reasonable price. Probably my first pick when I'm in the mood for an amber from here on out."
"Quite drinkable, great hops flavors and surprisingly bitter for the brand. The most interesting offering from Magic Hat that I've tried."
"Deep amber with a light tan head that was gone in 60 seconds. Nose of raw green hops gives way to caramel, then diacetyl. Flavor was initially the same, but with the hop profile increasingly giving way to the caramel maltiness and diacetyl. I am a fan of diacetyl, but it was more than necessary. I was overall pleasantly surprised in this beer as I do not really care much for most of this producer's portfolio."
"Definitely the hoppiest beer I've had from Magic Hat, but just falls short for me. A little balance would go a long way with this one-trick pony."
"D - Average. It is really heavy for an amber ale or a red ale."
"If a friend offered me one I wouldn't turn it down but I can't say that I would seek the ends of the earth for it. Over all an okay brew flavor wise but not very indicative of the style."
"Overall impression: A hop driven well balanced amber. I have to admit, I don't care much for Magic Hat beers. I don't want to ""hate"" because I know they are good folks and there are plenty of other fans out there that enjoy their beers. I'm just not in that category. Still, this is one solid amber. Very balanced and enjoyable. Clearly the winner for me from this brewer."
"One of the top seasonals in my opinion. Next to 9, my favorite MH offering."
"Pours a, hmmmm amber color with a creamy light brown fluffy head. Slowly dies down and leaves a little bit of lacing. Smell is very hoppy with a sweet malt aroma behind it. Taste is of the sweet caramel malt then slightly bittering hops, followed by a fruity aftertaste. Mouth feel is nicely carbonated."
"somewhat hazy reddish amber. off white head with pretty weak retention and minimal lace. smellad good. nice hoppy, citrusy, herbal scent with a malt background. taste was almost as good as what the nose suggested. medium body. good beer, but just not a standout. there's a lot of competition out ther, and this one just doesn't make the cut as far as me wanting to return to it. sorry majic hat."
"This is really a dark reddish brown murky beer. Not much head when i poured it into a glass, but it did have enough body. Not overly carbonated, but some bubbles appear about a quarter inch from the head. It smells very hoppy/ fruity.A very drinkable beer, but more of a sipping than a session brew. I would buy this again."
"It seems that Magic Hat has been in a transitional state over the last few years. They have dropped some of their most well known and best beers (Heart of Darkness, Humble Patience etc) and have been trying out new beers quite often on the public. Considering the fact that Saint Gootz was around last year, and is missing now makes me wonder how long this offering will be around. Anyway, pours a very nice dark amber, with lots of air bubbles and a sturdy white head. Aroma brings on lots of prickly piny hops, with a bit of butterscotch underneath. Taste is big on floral hops, not necessarily oily or resin like, but there presence is definitely there. Doesn't seem to be much malt balance, but the overall hop presence is tasty. Somewhat light considering the hop character in this beer. I would say that this is a sessionable beer for people who are in to hops. It is tough for me to review this one when thinking back on Magic Hat's other long gone offerings (bring them back!), but I guess it is of no use to live in the past. This is a pretty quality beer, with some complexity. A six pack would be a wise investment. Cheers"
"Beautiful look to it body slight hazed amber ruby forming a thick beige head that rises well above the rim of my glass lacing is thin with no even pattern forming put it is definitely clinging. Aroma is full of floral, pine scented, and somewhat perfume like hops nice sharp grain sweetness caramel and dough yeast combo ride along as well with an underlying flow of acidity. Flavor it is what it says a hoppy amber ale cereal caramel malt sweetness blended with a healthy amount of bittering hops in the flavor I'm getting more pine, earthiness, with a trace of floral hop bite, none of my beloved high alpha acid citric flavors kicking in but it's working in this amber ale. Really hits you with some deep caramelized slightly burnt malts than with some pretty much unrelenting hop bitterness good stuff. One of the best Magic Hat brews I've come across in some time now. Mouthfeel is straight up smooth and even with carbonation body weighs easy with a medium body just a touch of stinging acidity in the finish, but hop burps are on the way. Drinkability, it's always nice to see something other than winter warmers during this time of year enough malt and spices give me some friggin' hops, here's enough to hold me over one the beer stock runs low. I can get this one at the grocery store and it fulfills some portion of my hop head status, can't beat that."
"The look of this brew is nothing special. Very little head, although, it does have a nice deep amber color. It is somewhat of a ""baby"" American strong ale. I love these hoppy reds, in the tradition of hopback amber by Troegs. Easy drinking with nice cherry/sherry, esthery malts with a nice wicked backlash of hops and a very dry finish. The hops are full but do not linger. Smells nice of the fruit and the hops. This is by far Magic Hat's best brew and if they want to take back my business, they are going to have to remove the label, ""seasonal"" from the advertising!"
"Final Note: one of the finest MH offerings since they took Blind Faith away from us. Get some while it's around."
"D - Interesting winter seasonal that's hoppier than I had expected. Well-rounded, fairly complex brew. One of the more enjoyable Magic Hat offerings I've had in my travels."
"A definite thunbs-up to the denizens of South Burlington!"
"D- I wasn't expecting something this hoppy. I also wasn't expecting something this good. Impressive."
"Overall, an extremely well crafted beer in a style that most breweries just phone-in. Recommended as an easy-going very drinkable beer."
"Drinakbility: only for the brave or hopped inclinded."
"Pours a clean amber color with a small white head. Aromas of a sweet malt and a small hop presence. In the taste, a dry hoppiness and a balance sweet malt. A bitter and somewhat watery mouthfeel and a dry hoppy aftertaste. A nice big hoppy presence, but not much flavor, yet easy to drink."
"D: What a sexy beer... Aside from the pillow talk, I wish this was the happy hour beer at our local bar. Right now it's the Magic Hat Circus Boy, which although is decent, Roxy Rolles blows it away."
"The best thing about Magic Hats Roxy Rolles is the appearance, a dark ruby brown color with a creamy burnt tan head. Roxy Rolles aroma has great hop and citrus elements as well. Unfortunately I was turned off by the flavor. As expected a flavor that was dominate of hops with bitterness and citrus, but also ended up with a fruity apricot maybe strawberry type flavor as well. The slight fruity notes in this ale I felt to be its flaw. For some reason I seem to taste this flavor in many other Magic Hat beers, I dont know why. I enjoy many elements of the Roxy Rolles flavor but ultimately I didnt find the slight fruity notes in this ale to be favorable. (Although Im sure that many would really enjoy this) After pouring the Roxy Rolles I expected something great, but ended with something average."
"D - An average amber w/ nice hop accents, but sad to say lacks the malt character to match the hop notes and becomes very ordinary after a pint and just can't hold my interest."
"It's a little too carbonated for my taste, but this style can certainly absorb that direction."
"This poured as a nice looking beer, deep reddish brown. Also, at first sniff, the bottle foretold much promise: bountiful hops and sweet malty, fruity tang... but all was for not. In the mouth, the viscosity was proper (nothing to write home about but proper). The taste was bitter with no balance. It left the pallet with a kind of rotten cabbage flavor. I love magic hat, but I think they skrewed the pooch on this one."
"Another interesting brew from Magic Hat and one that I foresee myself spending a fair amount of time with this fall"
"D: Very tasty, I'll be buying much over the next couple months. The controlled bitterness makes it very drinkable. If the body was a little lighter, I'd love to have this early spring when the biker on the front of the bottle would be pulling his hog out for the first ride of the year."
"D. Because of the abv this is a great session beer for hop heads. However, the most dedicated hop head will want more."
"Very drinkable. I will buy a sixer or two when it hits the shelf in that form. The lowish alcohol makes it a great three or four bottle poker evening type beer."
"Down in VA, I've only seen this beer in the 2007 ""Feast of Fools"" variety pack. It pours an amber color with a moderate head. The smell is a purely bitter hop, which I was not expecting from a red ale. I tried to tease out malty notes, but nothing was found. As a UVM grad I like to say I'm a big fan of Magic Hat, but this beer is like nothing else they've produced. The taste as just a touch of the apricot/fruit taste that I've come to love, but mostly its a perfect synthesis of bitter hops and full-bodied grains. It lingers for long after its swallowed as well."
"Don't know if this is a beer that I would drink very often but it's one that I'd enjoy once in a while."
"Drank easy, probably one the beers from the brewery I've had. Good amber"
"M/D- dry and medium bodied...refreshing in the cold months, and full of flavor....a great amber, and my favorite Magic hat beer."
"I haven't tried a lot of ambers, but this seems to be a good one. And the gang over at Magic Hat continue to handle their hops well."
"Medium-bodied and smooth. A tasty brew that is not over-the top, but is a nice hoppy amber ale."
"This beer pours a beautiful amber color with a head that quickly disappears. The aroma seems to be a mixture of hops and malt. Smooth. The first thing I taste are hops with some malt backbone. It's almost chewy and sweet in some regards. Leaves a mouthfeel that begs for more in my opinion. A decent amber ale that just happens to be hoppier than a typical amber ale."
"Am I chewing a resin bag? Hops mellow out a bit after the beer breathes for a little while but just a wierd, biting hop flavor that does not linger at all. No residual oils. Only lasting flavor is a mild malt bittersweetness. Poured a red-stained brown in color with a slight head that evaporated to a thinner veneer. Medium body that thins out the deeper into the glass I find myself. The shiny hop flavor was a bit too much and not true to the style. Novel take but not sold on this beer."
"The beer poured nice with a decent head and I was anticipating a seasonal joy that only comes from finding warmth from the cold. Sadly, they filled this tank with a bit too many hops for my taste (I'm a malt guy, so I'm a bit biased here). If you like hops this is the beer for you. If you want to hang out next to a fire and talk to the opposite sex, know this bad boy has an aftertaste that will make you fear the dragon breath that comes screaming from your mouth."
"Excellent drinkability here and the best beer from Magic Hat that I have tried so far."
"drinkability - I'm a malt guy but i can drink this. Hops are not overpowering."
"The best way to describe this beer is its very strong bite due to the strong flavors of hops. Different passion fruits and mango tastes and aromas can be distinguished as well. When the beer is pured it is an average brown with a tint of red. Definitely a good beer but the strong bite of hops lowers its drinkability."
"Drinkabilty - Easy drinking, really refreshing . Can definitely make a session out of this one. Probably my favorite offering from Magic Hat."
"Poured a cloudy amber, decent lively carbonation and bubbly head. Aromas were slight toffee, bready malts with a crisp hop profile. Taste was not as sweet as i had expected considering magic hat's other offerings; the malts were actually nicely subdued, though there was a slight off putting biscuity aftertaste, and yes, it was a freash bottle. The hops were garden variety, but did help control the brew's sweet character. An easy session brew, but in my opinion there are better available, though i was pleasantly surprised by magic hat nonetheless."
"12oz brown bottle with a best before date of 3/07. Pours a hazy medium dark amber with a two finger head, good longevity and lace. Decent but not overly hop floralness mixed with some decent caramel malt aromas. Good malt character quickly followed by a decent hop flavor and a fair amount of bitterness in the aftertaste. Rich and slightly creamy. I like this one as the hop levels are tolerable and not way over the top as so many brewers are doing now. A nice beer."
"This is a good Amber Ale. I can tell this beer has a ton to offer when fresh. It's amazing that it's maintained this well. The oxidation was not that bad, and the sour notes were only minimal throughout the entire beer. I would love to enjoy this one fresh."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark amber/ruby reddish color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, nice big islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is of sweet malts, some hops, and caramel. The taste is more on the hoppy side for an amber, nice malt flavor as well, the finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nicely done amber ale from Magic Hat."
"I could drink a couple of these and be a happy beersnob."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - I just liked this beer a lot, glad to see Magic Hat is still developing new great brews to compliment old standby's #9 and Circus Boy. Have to admit I tried this about a week after falling in LOVE with Nugget Nectar and this definetly reminded me of a poor man's version (though not that poor, ha). Definetly worth a try if you can find one!"
"Pours a four finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Nearly clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Expecting in your face hop flavor but the hops are tolerable, piney hoppy finish. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a 1.5 finger head that quickly falls, leaving a small amount of sticky lacing. Smell is very nice - sweet malt with a grassy, somewhat herbal hop aroma coming through in the background. The taste is hoppier than the nose would suggest - the malt sweetness lasts a fraction of a second before being replaced by the grassy hop flavor. The finish is bitter and clean. If I have any complaint it is that the hops take over a bit too quickly here for my taste. Still, this is a very tasty, interesting, and different seasonal that I will buy again next year."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a slightly hazy amber with a bit of a head on it. The head drops off rather quickly and leaves a bit of lacing. The aroma is good. I get a bit of a subdued pine, as well as a touch of citrus and maple. An interesting taste. There is a bit of the pine hops, but while up front they are not too strong. Follows with a taste of caramel malt and a touch of fruitiness. Pretty well balanced and an easy drinker. A decent brew."
"A run of the mill craft red ale, does not possess any distinguishing characteristics. Not hard to drink, but boring, I would not go out of my way to buy it. There are many better examples."
"What a wacky beer to say the least. I decided to pick up a six pack after the holidays because I never had it and it looked seasonal. The first impression that I got was almost a ""piney"" taste... almost like pine needs off a Christmas tree. With that said it's not a bad taste it's just.... interesting. A definate beer to have on occasion."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, has a good kick to it. It’s a flavorful beer but not quite a flavor that hit it off with me. Although Magic Hat has done worse, they’ve certainly done better."
"Hazy reddish copper with a small, light tan, creamy head. Good head retention and some spotty lace. Pungent aroma of citrusy hops headlines the nose, supported by pine, bready malt and earthy yeast. Taste-wise, this beer very good. Big hops flavors (citrus and flowers) rush in as soon as the first drop hits the taste buds, then back off some to let the very pleasant roasted malt flavor show through (caramel and hay). The hops then rush back in toward the finish (fruit & resin). The finish is long and bitter, citrus and a touch of spice. It has a medium body, dry texture and soft carbonation. This is another good one from Magic Hat. Ive been in the mood for a hoppier beer as of late, and this one did the trick without being overbearing. Id definitely have this again and recommend trying it."
"I feel like a lot more went into this beer than I got out of it while drinkinging. It had a masking creamy flavor that left almost no malt flavor. There was a bit of caramel and some citrus hops, but the flavor was a bit underwhleming. I guess its like a hoppy Smithwick's."
"Roxy has a smooth texture and slick, quaffable mouthfeel. Body is between light and medium and easy to drink. One of the better ""new"" MH brews."
"Poured a hazy brick red with an off-white head that dropped to a quarter-inch leaving rings of lace. Lots of grapefruit hops in the nose, this is a hoppy beer. Taste is hoppy but not a kick in the face hoppy. Balanced nicely with maltyness and a citrusy finish. A decent, hoppy red ale."
"The crisp, snappy edge to this beer had me thinking wheat, which I know it hasn't, and of Simcoe, which I knew from first whiff that it certainly does. It stood up admirably to a big bowl of quite-hot wings, the oily resins helping to wash the capsaicin away before it did too much damage. It flows easily, with a very refreshing way about it, making it nicely drinkable. It's a pleasant surprise that this Magic Hat offering is well more than a novelty offering. In fact, it's a real nice accompaniment to whatever spicy thing you might be eating."
"This brew is a murky, light burgundy color with a decent head. The aroma is faint, with modest toasted malt aroma. Theres a bit of caramel and some floral hops as well. The taste much more pronounced, with a full sweetness up front, solid malt flavor, and a bitter finish. Theres a little pine and fruit, and a slight graininess. None of the flavors particularly stand out as dominant. The beer has a medium body and relatively low carbonation. Theres also a little slickness that become increasingly notable as the brew warms. Although not a beer that Id seek out, this was drinkable and fairly enjoyable."
"On-tap at Alternative Brews. {iney Hoppy and grapefruity, a bit of spice in finish. Brownish colour with minimal white head. Can pass an an IPA. Balance with malts and even a bit of fruitiness in finish.An average for the style, I liked it but can't report any standout features."
"This one is a winner."
"Something about the label is a bit freaky, though. Reminded me of the motorcycle rider from Raising Montana."
"Highly drinkable, next thing I knw the sixer is gone...uhmmm!!!"
"Fuzzy garnet. Big bubbled steady tan foam that slowly dimples down leaving some strands of droopy lace. Aromas are of soft pine, caramel, fleshy peach, and stone fruit as well as a solvent-like cast floating on top. Roxy is not rolling as there are no carbonation streams. The flavor is of pine splashed with watered grapefruit juice leading into a strange metallic and vegetal-like finish. An odd and unpleasant mushy, moldy fruit flavor adheres to the tongue lending a greasy feel. Thin and watery mouthfeel, lacking any body whatsoever, and the carbonation is nearly non-existant. An unenjoyable beer that rolled right into my sink."
"I would drink a couple of these, but my tastebuds would probably be shot after that. I had this an hour or so after a Mad Elf, and it was a brilliant contrast. The fresh hop flavor and aroma is great, which is something that sets this apart from orther hoppy winter ales that I have had. I highly recommend this brew."
"This is a dry beer with a lot of hop finish. Surprisingly, there's very little hop up front. Moderate level of body with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Other than the hop this is a rather non-descript beer, unusual for Magic Hat"
"I will review again."
"($6.99 / 6-pack)"
"Very easy to drink. Excellent beer. I wish I had bought more than one."
"Overall- A big potential flavor that just falls short. Pretty good through regardless. I enjoyed it on tap right at Magic Hat and it and the 376 were selling points."
"Pours a dark, iced-tea ruby amber with just a dusting of a head and tiny splotches of lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma is quite hoppy (American citrus notes, light on the metal) but it also has a great caramel malt base and some enticing apple esters. The palate is well balanced between generous helpings of caramel malts and lemony, zesty hops. Some sweetness crops up just before the finish, which dries out just a tad as it fades. Overall, this is a very good beer -- true to the style, and lacking too much metallic aroma in the hops, which is a nice change from many American reds. Very sessionable and pleasant."
"Pours a clear deep dark mahogony with a medium sized tan head. The smell is very hoppy,citrus scents, grapefruit like. The taste is creamy with a very hoppy backbone. Citrus hops rule this beer,but there's also some ""bisquity"" flavors and carmel. The m/f is medium with the hops really overpowering the other flavors. Not a bad beer,but the hops are really a little too much."
"Dark malty, but less so than a strong ale. Plenty of hops in the nose, with a touch of grapefruit. Plenty of hop bite, but not overpowering. Lighter than a strong ale, in terms of maltiness, and much more drinkable than a DIPA. A very nice, highly poundable session beer. Had two at lunch. Would like to try it bottled sometime."
"Served from the bottle, the pour issues forth a reddish-amber color with a thick white head. Pleasant aroma of pine. Flavor is definitely hoppier than an average American amber, but not overwhelming like a big DIPA. Very tasty combination of pine tree, citrus, and malt. Clean aftertaste; a nice offering for the winer."
"Drinkability is good more of an IPA wouldn't buy if I wanted a good amber but not bad for a hop fix. Needs a touch more malt to round it out. Thanks Enola for this sample."
"The pour raises a light tan one finger head over a clear ruby-amber body. The head falls quickly to surface bubbles and a glass ring. The lacing, though, is quite sticky and resilient. A beautiful beer! The nose is very hoppy, with citrus-like bitterness evident. A bit of caramel sweetness, too. The taste is very hoppy, almost abrasive, with a vegetable-like off flavor overshadowing the nice caramel sweetness. The mouth is pretty thick, with some smooth carbonation. This beer was bought at random, and I will not be drinking it again."
"Pours a nice garnet/mahogany color with a two-fingered cream-colored head. The neatly stacked bubbles in the head resemble soda-like carbonation, with the heady quickly decaying to about a quarter of its original size, but with still a nice portion of creamy foam. The initial smell is noticeably malty, with a floral hop backbone. On the tip of the palate, there is a strong fruit presence (maybe grapefruit, but also apricot and mango), followed by a roasted malt taste as it rolls down the back of the throat. As far as drinkability goes, I noticed as the beer warmed that the initial citrus sparkle faded into a smooth, but unfortunately bland, malt flavoreasy to drink, rarely exciting."
"Drinkability: an easy drinking and flavorful amber that many people should enjoy. Worth seeking this out, as it is one of the better Magic Hat brews IMHO."
"12 ouncer with ""drink before""dating of Feb, '07 notched onto the rear label. Pours softly reddish amber and cloudy. Dark tan, long lasting head and leaving fine amounts of sheeting and sticky blotchy lacing. Nose of mucho resiny hops. Full flavor amber, hops tasting bold and fresh. Hearty ale, balance of a respectable bed of malts and a piney, resiny jolt of sticky hops. Nice offering from Magic Hat. Easy quaffer, nice for the cooler weather @ 5.8%. Recommended"
"I'm guessing this is Magic Hat's answer to Nuggett Nectar. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short in the overall race. The dry hopping is a nice addition in the nose but it could be done better with less dryness and a bit less sweetness."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable, I'd recommend it to anybody and always enjoy whatever Magic Hat has to offer."
"The flavors are balanced nicely with a hint of sweetness, followed by hops, and then malts. Moves through the mouth very well and is very drinkable. A nice flavorful, but easy drinker."
"12 oz. bottle from Florians. Amber red body with a quarter inch of off-white head. Smells unlike most beers I've tried - like pine, orange, and apricot. Tastes bitter, piney, with some citrus. Some malt, but this is definitely a hop-forward hop-heavy ale. Medium bodied, bordering on syrupy. Hmm, not sure what to make of this one. Reminds me of Batch 375 in some ways (that was their double IPA). It's alright, but not sure I'd get it again, due to the lack of balance."
"The taste is quit hoppy, quite immediately. It is not as sweet as the aroma might suggest, or at least there is not enough malt sugars to allow this to taste of sweet citrus fruits. Instead the loud citrus notes take on a citrus like peel character (you know, citrus without the sweetness). The finish has a slight note that tastes like darkly roasted grain to me, but just a hint. Mostly the finish is dominated by a biting hop bitterness that is even a touch astringent at times. This could actually use a bit more of a malt backbone to carry the over-the-top hops. Without the citrus hop notes take on a tartness that does not quite mesh. Still this is quite a drinkable brew, and I will happily finish it."
"The drinkability is good, But the beer has no real unique qualities. It's good but I would not buy more. MK"
"Been awhile since I've enjoyed a new Magic Hat product this much. Could work easily as a year round beer. Not a ""sitting before the fire sipper"" but you need a beer to have with dinner in December too. Take it for a spin."
"D - This was a pleasant surprise. i'm not a huge Hat fan although I appreciate what they do. I LOVE good, hoppy, RED beers.... the color is awesome and I'm brewing something similar right now. I could drink this in a session and might have to grab a 12 or more if I can find it - this should be standard fare for Majic Hat."
"Pours a slightly opaque amber with a nice khaki head that leaves some good lacing. Smells entirely of hops (grassy, floral, earthy), very sweet. Not what I was expecting from an amber ale but very nice. Taste is much of the same. Floral and grassy hops dominate but malts are also present. Grapefruit, oranges, and grass seem to be the main hop flavors. Even with all the hops this is only moderately bitter at best. Good mouthfeel, maybe a bit on the thin side but overall pretty nice. This is a really nice beer. It wasn't what I was expecting from an amber ale but this is a Magic Hat offering so I really shouldn't be. Overall this is a very drinkable beer, the only problem is that I can only find it in mixed 12 packs but I look forward to having this again."
"really solid offering from magic hat. pours a beautiful red with a khaki colored frothy head. smells very much of grapefruit and oranges. by the nose i was expected to get smacked around by bitterness as found in a solid ipa but that's not the case with this brew. very flavorful and smooth. orange notes with slight pine. definitly sessionable and probably the best magic hat i've had in a long time. looking forward to trying their schwarzbier. slainte."
"Still, a nice brew."
"The beer pours a nice red color with a thick offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid malt base along with some crystal and pale malts. The hop aroma is quite nice and balances well. The taste is good. It has a bitter hop flavor that hits you in the mouth and carries all the way through to the finish. The malts are present, but don't even out the flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good brew. I like the hop content and the general drinkability."
"Overall, not a bad brew. Certainly more palatable than No. 9, the only other Magic Hat offering I've sampled."
"Overall-A reeally nice beer that I will look for again in the future."
"12 oz., best by February. It pours a ruby/mahogany with medium carbonation and three fingers of khaki head that leaves good lacing. The aroma is quite nice, with rich hops that contribute grapefruit, passionfruit, mango and a dash of pine needle. Reminds me very much of Double Simcoe's scent. The flavor profile is quite similar with an addition of the apricot esters which I find in so many of their brews and a medium bitterness from the leafy/green and tropical hops. Once again I am reminded of Double Simcoe and, lo and behold, the website states that it is brewed with Simcoe and Brewer's Gold. The body is medium and drying, with medium carbonation and a medium, smooth finish. One of the better offerings from Magic Hat, and one I probably enjoyed more due to trying Double Simcoe just a few days prior."
"*wipes tongue with sleeve*"
"Amazingly hoppy for a red ale, that pours nicely with a small creamy head, that lingers. It has a intense citrus rind tang to it, with an end of lingering hoppy spice. It could do well to tone back the intensity of the hops, but for what they where aiming for, they nailed it. All around a very good beer, but not an exceptional one."
"This beer is very reminiscent of batch 374, but maybe a bit more toned down. One of the best newer magic hat beers not in a mixed pack or with a #. I could drink this all day long as a session beer."
"DA: I enjot these hoppy Amber or Ruby ale's, this one is a very high quality example and now one of my favorites from Magic Hat."
"Whoah! Magic Hat has done it again! Roxy Rolles... Hoppy Amber Ale... Yes! It pours a reddish chestnut body with orange highlighhts beneath a creamy light tan head that holds fairly well and leaves some very nice, fine lace about the glass. The nose is loaded with resinous, piney, citrusy (orange, grapefruit), and floral hops as well as a hint of the caramelish malt beneath. The body is medium and it gently caresses the tongue with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor reveals even more hops, starting citrusy and gently piney with notes of orange, sweet grapefruit and pineapple, and then becoming much more piney and sappy once it's crossed the palate. Across the middle some mild malt reveals itself with a caramelish and biscuity character. Some other yeasty fruit sneaks in at the swallow, with apple, pear, and berries; and a touch of buttery diacetyl appears in the finish, helping to neutralize the tangy, juicy, and piney hops - leaving the palate refreshed for another sip. It lingers, gently bitter and piney with a gentle smear of butter, for what seems like forever. A very enjoyable ride! Certainly worth trying!"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - great session beer."
"Pours a translucent darker amber color, with a smallish yet sticky head. Aroma involves hops, and that's about it. It's very herbal and crisp. Holy hell! Hops domination in the flavor, too much for my taste actually; mainly because there's no balance whatsoever. Any malt character is almost nonexistent, and the bitter puckering hop character is way too strict, without any of the preferred flavors I like from very hoppy beers, such as citrus, herbal, spicy stuff. Sadly, I am stuggling to finish this brew. I'm sure some hopheads will enjoy this, but if you like a more complex hoppy beer, seek other choices."
"Note: Different than the maltier winter brews we always see. A nice easy drinking ale."
"Poured a rich deep amber with a tight 1/2 finger slight off white head that stuck like glue to the pint glass,ahh nice piney hop aromas overtop of sweet caramel a hint of roastinee quite nice.The hop profile didnt show itself as much on the palate the pine profile took a backseat to the bigger sweetish caramel malt base the piney,resiny hop came late into the finish.A nice quaffing relatively hoppedup American Red,I would buy again for sure."
"Well done..."
"D - A very good seasonal selection. Stronger flavors than other Magic Hat offerings, but not overpowering."
"A tough one to call. This is like a sweet, innocent amber ale corrupted by a big, bulky IPA. The IPA wins. No matter what you call it, this is a great beer. (Can't say I'm into the name or little story behind the character on the label, but whatever...) Seems a lot bigger than 5.8%...nice job!"
"D: At first impressive, but tails off rather quickly. I wonder how this would do on tap, or better yet on cask."
"Crystalline bronze with a thick cloud of off-cream crater-pocked foam. Utterly still by appearance. Big aromas of citrus pith (grapefruit and tangerine) ride out atop a caramel-candy sweet malt base. Some pineyness, too. Flavor seems a bit...off: citrus hop flavor appears in a brief flash, then there's a strange smokey and buttery taste, kind of like movie-theater popcorn. A little orange peel flavor toward the finish, then a weird sweet smokiness at the end. Sort of slick mouthfeel, medium body. Decent for a winter seasonal, but this isn't gonna fool anyone into thinking it's in the same league as Celebration and Santa's Private Reserve."
"This is one hopped up amber ale from MH. I'm always pleased to see the new releases."
"M&D - bitter with no balance, but a drinkable beer with a decent feel to it, but really could use some sweetness in the background, lurking"
"<edit notes: I had this in the bottle at a Dark Star Orchestra show recently at Revolution Hall in Troy -- with no glass to pour it into -- and it tasted substantially more hoppy than when I'd had it on tap. Interesting. >"
"This is a pretty good stab at a hoppy red ale. It is interesting because of its smokiness, which combined with its aromatic hoppiness, gives it almost a marijuana-like taste. It is pretty thin in the mouth, but nicely drinkable. As other reviewers have said, this is a better beer than several of MH's year-round offerings."
"Not an earthshaking beer, but I wouldn't mind this one being part of their regular rotation. I could easily kick out 3 of their year-rounds in favor of this, and it's way better than the double IPA."
"pours red brown color one finger head fair lacing. smell is fruity grapefruit. taste is very strong grapefruit and bitter grapefruit rind. mouthfeel light with bitter after taste. drinkability, comes on a little to strong with the grapefruit taste for me. Its good for a change of pace but not a regular buy for me."
"Pours a nice amber with a redish hue. One finger head with good retention, and very nice lacing. Smell is of floral hops,and citrus primarily grapefruit. Body is light to medium with some carbonation. Taste is not typical for this style. The malt presence very subdued. It is however, nicely hopped with a fruity, hoppy, refreshing flavor from start to finish. Recommended."
"Very amusing flavors/aromas. I might give this some creativity bonus points if I could."
"I wish they just made more Batch 374 because this one just doesn't seem as well constructed. It could use some complimentary malts to balance it out a little more."
"poured a pure red amber color. the nose was the best part of the beer, as it was incredibly fruity. the hoppiness took over much of the palate. for an amber beer, it was too much. i wanted to have more of the fruit that i could smell on the nose. the little bit of taste dropped off on the finish. i could see myself drinking a few of these just because there wasn't much fruit flavor."
"Update: I have found myself drinking alot more of these. It has become one of my favorite beers at the moment. I have noticed a touch of honey in the taste. It is not as bitter as it was when I first tried it, but has mellowed out to a nice everyday drinkable beer."
"This beer is a nice amber color. There is a fair head and lots of lacing. The smell is very hoppy and fruity. Many different flavors jump out at you here. A complex brew. The beer is about the hoppiest amber ale I have had. The taste is very bitter and the mouthfeel is sticky. A sessionable beer that does not seem to have a higher abv punch. I could drink this beer again. I will return to pick up a couple more sixers of this brew. Reccomended."
"Overall this is a very interesting and tasty beer that I would recommend. This is my second Magic Hat beer and I liked this one as much as I disliked the last one I had."
"Pours a clear dark-red/amber color with two fingers of tan head and some lacing. The smell is piney, citrusy, and hoppy, the evergreen notes making it especially fitting for the season. The taste is citrusy hops, fairly strong but not overpowering, with caramel malt, followed by a hop finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good for this moderately hoppy brew. The hoppiness adds a bit of a harshness, but not too much. Overall a good brew, probably one that will be appreciated more in December though."
"Tried this one at a recent party. Poured a lovely dark amber color, with a two finger head. Great head retention, with nice lacing. Aroma was detectable from some distance, assaulting my nose right away with pine and bitter orange peel. When I first opened the bottle, I was instantly reminded of a Noble Fir christmas tree. As for the taste, this one was a bit disappointing. Very hoppy at first with little else to offer after that. Some light citrus notes, but mostly just the hops. Little if any aftertaste. Mouthfeel was quite light. The simple flavor and light mouthfeel make this beer very drinkable, but hardly something to write home about. I've come to expect more from Magic Hat beers, most of which I greatly enjoy."
"Pours a reddish amber ale with a thick head that quickly disapates to a thin lacing. Tight bubbles cling to glass. Strong aroma of cascade and extra hopps. This beer is bursting with flavour and falls bordering an American Pale and a strong Amber ale at the same time. A great seasonal and if you like hopps you gotta give this a shot. Nice job from Magic Hat!"
"Pours a red red amber with a full tan headskie. Taste is nice and hoppy, very much so for an amber. Billed as a hoppy amber, so it is. Got some great flavor balance too with the chewy mango, yes mango. Mouthfeel smooth and easy despite the hoppy. Drinks well and easy to drain a six pack."
"12 ounce bottle."
"D-yes I would have another, I really liked this beer"
"A 12oz bottle from the Ship of Fools variety pack. This was a dark amber with a medium creamy coffee head. Some nice lacing. It had a malty aroma, as well as some sweet, musty yeast. A creamy taste, with some citrus hops. A little spicy/nutty flavor when warmer. Pretty good beer."
"Easy drinking and pleasant, but nothing you should feel the need to seek out, especially if you're into big hoppy IPA's. A step up from most of Magic Hat's recent offerings."
"Overall a very nice IPA. This is perhaps their best beer to date."
"Strong flavor but bitterness is only medium. Malt profile is in backround but has a nutty earthiness to tone the hoppy airyness. Overall balance is outstanding but this is still unquestionably built for hop addicts. Clean finish and slightly oily mouthfeel. This is solid stuff from those loopy guys in Vermont."
"Single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh. Notched as best by February 2007."
"The bottle says its a hoppy amber ale. It certainly smells hoppy and it has a great hop bite. It pours a dark amber color and has a good malt balance. One of the better Magic Hat beers I've had and since its a winter beer and I found it here in Maine in mid October, I would imagine it was nice and fresh."
