Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and dries out toward the end. First sip is big malty oak, a little sweet for my taste. Reminiscent in some ways of a pumpkin ale. I tasted touches of vanilla and allspice, but malty oak still dominates the palate. Nothing offensive but nothing inspiring, either. Not a beer I’d go out of my way for.","Kobal","Aug 14, 2013"

The oak works with the caramel notes in the beer, though the beer comes off a little watery for such an otherwise thick seeming beer. Finish is dry and otherwise clean.

Smell is full of sweet malt with vanilla and cherries in the back. Oak wafts in and out. Love the big, smooth, amber ale malt taste with a longish wooden dryness. Bitterness is English tea leaf hoppiness with oak and cherry-vanilla notes. A mild sourness faintly lingering as the mild biscuity malt blooms. Crisp carbonation and medium light weight make for excellent drinkability. A creative twist on a standard that is not gimmicky or tricked out. This makes me think about what was available in the days of wooden casks. This may be a resurrection of the flavors of old. I wish this one was on the shelves year round.

The yeasty flavor combines with the aforementioned flavors with a bready note and light oaky vanilla in the background as it finishes. Overall a good amber, a good amber w/ mild oak influence in the flavor. This is a middle of the road but I am sure the oak made this better than just the base alone, drinkability is on the low side for the style.","Slatetank","Apr 12, 2012"

It has a faint aroma of sweet caramel, vanilla and oak. It's medium bodied and starchy with a dry, scratchy finish. It tastes pretty sweet with loads of oak. There's a strong note of dark cherry, vanilla and caramel. There's some herbal bitterness in the finish. It's not what I'd call a refreshing beer, but it has a reasonably complex taste. I personally would prefer something like this to be balanced out with more hops, but that's not the focus of this one. It all revolves around the oak.","yesyouam","Mar 27, 2012"

Almost effervescent in the mouthfeel, and it leads into a dry finish. Not much to mention on the hops, but this is a malt heavy beer and thats ok.

The main thing I get from the nose is faint vanilla, and possibly some light oak aging, and perhaps the smell of light, fresh bread. Taste to me is pretty good. The beer is sweet, but not overly so. Lots of malt, with a lingering vanilla taste, that follows to an oaky type taste. The oak taste in this beer does not taste like old oak barrels or anything like that, it's more like fresh cut wood, that's the best way I can describe it.

What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both pretty good. What I liked least about this beer was the blandness of the aroma and taste and the lack of oak flavor in this beer, it just didn't meet my expectations. This beer did have some good drinkability, the smoothness and lighter flavors made this beer go down quickly but it just didn't have enough flavor to hold my attention. I would recommend this as a starter beer for someone wanting to get into oaked beers but if you have a some experience with oaked ales you may find this beer underwhelming like I did. Samuel Adams can make some solid beers but this one fell short when it came to the aroma and flavor and with a name like Mighty Oak I expected a pretty big Oak presence and that is not what I got, better luck next time Samuel Adams.","StoutHunter","Jan 25, 2012"

3.58,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall- I was expecting a more hearty ale. This is not a bad beer though. Add a little oak flavor and this beer would be great.","scratch69","Jan 15, 2012"
3.53,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a bright clear red hue with a light tan khaki head forming thick and dwindling slow down the sides of my glass, the head is big bubbled with chunks of sporadic lacing left behind. Aroma has a nice caramel malt presence with a touch of oak/vanilla notes somewhat earthy blended notes but nothing as extreme in the oak character as most beergeeks are used to. Flavor is upfront with malt sweetness with a touch of toasted oak notes with a big fruity cherry note coming through and ending with a more caramelized malt presence. Drinking extremely effortlessly or I'm just really thirsty for a beer after work nothing extreme about the oak presence here. Just a nicely constructed red ale with a hint of something more complex than your typical red. Carbonation is sturdy really flows well, not cloyiing in anyway unless you're really sensitive to a maltier beer. Overall I would drink this again as part of a sampler but I couldn't honestly want to reach for just this in a sixer of it's own.","WVbeergeek","Jan 14, 2012"
3.03,-12.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Okay. Don't really get the oak in it other than the vanilla. SA doesn't really say how they get the "oak" in it. Oak barrels, chips, essence?","jneiswender","Jan 14, 2012"
3.33,-3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, this is a nice, easy-going beer that drinkers expecting a beefier, heartier aged ale might find disappointing. Yet it is a decent steady, enjoyable with good flavor that, limited though it is, could go from decent to good with some work. I'd strongly recommend much more malt--oh, and some oak, please.","Gehrig","Jan 14, 2012"
3.54,2.6,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D/O: This fruity ale has an old-fashioned English charm about it, suggesting that the brewer had a stock ale or old ale of lesser strength in mind. While not perfect, it really only stumbles significantly when compared to high-end barrel-aged beers. If Sierra Nevada's Old Cantankerous ale had been like this, then it would have been a much better beer.","beagle75","Jan 13, 2012"

3.33,-3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"So, it is better than your averagee bland red ale, simply because of the nice small addition of oak in the flavor department. Next time, hop this guy up, add some vanilla, do something more, I think this is a good start, but far from complete.","Beerandraiderfan","Jan 12, 2012"

3.72,7.8,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours out a fairly bright reddish copper color with a tan head. The smell is sweet, some toasty malts and vague spicey hops. As this beer has warmed a bit it has improved. At first I was getting some odd solvent smells but as it has warmed I am getting those nice oak notes I would find in my beloved Jim Beam Black, some definite vanilla and caramel notes in there. The taste is unfortunately not quite as complex and I found it a bit thin bodied even for a Sam Adams brew. The taste is a lot of sweet toasty malts, and some spicey hops finish. It finishes pretty dry. Mouthfeel is fine but overall this beer is just not as rich and satisfying as it could be. A good experiment for a variety pack but nothing I would ever buy by itself.","Star80","Jan 10, 2012"
3.76,9,4,3,4,4,4,"Overall this is worth trying and a decent enough effort but a bit of a letdown for something called "The Mighty Oak Ale"....just expected more woody notes....I would definitely buy this though if it came in 12 packs for 13,14 bucks....","ZAP","Jan 08, 2012"
3.45,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall, this is a decent, but kind of a boring beer. If they were going for oak flavors, they are hard to find, instead the beer just comes off as malty sweet.","flexabull","Jan 08, 2012"

I hoped this was going to be a great beer since im such a oak fan, but man, no type of oak at all comes out. Its ok, but nothing special here, could care less to drink again really.","wvsabbath","Jan 05, 2012"

Has obvious malt taste but with roasted tones. There are hints of vanilla and the oak really comes out in the dry finish. Another decent brew from Sam Adams, but why oh why does this only come in a 12pk variety pack?","Lemke10","Jan 03, 2012"

3.93,13.9,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Found this in a Sam Adams brewmasters sampler 12 pack at Target, of all places. Hard to pass up as the sampler included three new varieties I hadn't yet tried. Poured into pint glass, with a perfect dark amber. Not much head, but decent lacing on the side of the glass. Mouthfeel was the low point for me, as there was no substance, just watery. Flavor was quite the opposite, though. Strong oak flavor, highlighted with a perfect blend of caramel and vanilla. This might be the driest finish of any beer I can recall. Decent beer that I would purchase on its own, away from the sampler. I want to prefer other breweries to Sam Adams, because I feel they are almost too mainstream. However, I can't deny that Jim Koch and crew put out some quality beverages. I'd rate it overall as an 89.","dalehili","Dec 24, 2011"
