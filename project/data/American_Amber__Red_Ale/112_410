The aroma is not malty but nondescript, with a light funky earthy quality. The taste is deeper with the malt with some darker fruit notes and caramel malt breadiness. There's a nice moderate weight to the body and overall this is a good-to-very good red ale that doesn't blow you away but is very well made.","delta490","Aug 08, 2014"

The taste has a bold malty backbone, with strong notes of floral hop flavors. Full flavors, nice body. Overall a very nice and hoppy red ale.","vette2006c5r","Jul 30, 2013"

Only downfall is the date; for it being a beer with hops and low abv it should have a date for the consumers. If it had one I am sure I would have picked one up sooner or been buying it more regular.

During effervescence, the beer's bouquet is of mild floral, but mostly citrus hops. I love the greenish tint the beer has around it's top edges and in the foam as it's being poured. As the beer settles, the grain presents more prominently. The moutfheel is very nice. Smooth, wet, and perfectly carbonated. Very mild flavor. Light toasted malt with appealing mild hop flavor in the background. The maltiness does eventually succumb to the citrus hop that prevails late. What's left in the finish is a mild, unoffensive hop perfume in the palate. Very good and drinkable pale ale. That from a fellow who nearly never likes malty pale ales.","DocJitsu","Jun 24, 2012"

Aromas and tastes are similar: spicy & floral hops, caramel malts, toasted grains, sharp but not too aggressive citric bitterness from the hops. Well balanced. Mouth-feel is creamy and medium bodied. Overall, I've always said this is a great introductory/gateway craft beer. You get a taste of the hops, but they won't blow away the palate of someone new to craft beer. Always a good west coast amber to come back to now and again.","barnzy78","Mar 10, 2012"

Mouthfeel was a little on the thin side, but the hops were right there on the tongue. I began to feel better right away. I should mention that the hops worked well with the malt to create a slightly bitter honey-like sweetness in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry and very tasty.

4.17,6.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5," The taste has a nice fruity yeast tang in the initial entry with slightly piney flavor from the hops with mild floral accents that is indicative of noble hops. The taste has a spicy finish after mild malt which helps to augment the yeast flavor with gentle sweet flavors. The beer has a good amount of flavor but the bitterness is smooth which adds to the overall refreshing quality of the amber. I liked this and the finish is nice and crisp with lager like finish. This comes off like an amped up anchor steam to me with some lager qualities but nice spice and yeast flavor-it is a pleasure to drink.","Slatetank","Oct 04, 2011"

Sweet caramel malt aromas with lightly pungent herbal and citrus hops. On the lighter side of medium bodied and creamy smooth. Sweet caramel malt flavors combined with floral hops from beginning to end. The pungent aroma translates into a similarly pungent taste up front but fades as the assertive carbonation rolls through. Finishes with a light bitter pine hop aftertaste. A very smooth, pleasantly drinkable red ale.","IronLover","Sep 28, 2011"

Perhaps algae-like would be a slightly better adjective, but still not a completely pleasant scent. It does have some faint grassy hops and toasty malts behind it though, which are welcoming. Tastes a bit bland, with a bit more emphasis on the malt than in the nose, the same bit of hop character, and that subtle off flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky and under carbonated.

3.72,-4.6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer pours a slightly hazy orange brown with a finger of ecru foam that fades into a thin layer upon the surface of the beer. The aroma is of nice fruit esters, particularly of red apple and orange zest. In addition there is a nice aroma of caramel that when paired with the apple smells wonderful. The first taste hits with a strong bitter flavor that does slowly fade away, but yet still leaves you with the fact that it is a bitter beer. Though the beer is nice and crisp there are notes of both cloves and caramel. The mouthfeel, while well carbonated, is in my opinion a bit on the watery side, but not too much that the beer is unpleasant. Despite all of the set backs it's a very nice drinking beer and one that I wouldn't have a problem telling people to get. The only concern I have is that it's not really a Red ale it's more of an EPA, or APA. But as a beer, it's not bad.","Vdubb86","Oct 17, 2010"

Pours a cloudy amber orange. Moderate carbonation is visible as well as bits and clouds of yeast. 3/4 inch of head forms and quickly dissipates. The nose is nicely balanced with fresh and spicy hops up front and a more subtle malt. Medium body. Carbonation is a bit low. A good dose of hops greets the palate; not too much. Just enough for you to appreciate the flavor and then it gets balanced out by a fairly clean malt. Definitely session material. Despite being well past its prime the hops are still relatively lively with a mild resiny texture. I had this on tap a few months back and that was definitely a better experience.

Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim with some bands and spots of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose suggests caramel/toffee, a hint of citrus, a faint earthy hops presence and a slightly metallic character. Taste consistent with nose; however it's a bit muted and there is also something of a spicy character - not sure if it's the carbonation projecting into the flavor profile, but that's what I get. Finishes with a light lingering bitterness; however, metallic quality from the nose seems to have dissipated. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation.

On top sits a modest head of tan bubbles. It leaves a very slight coat on the sides of the glass. It has a deep floral hop aroma that is kind of woodsy. Behind this is the scent of pale malts (not wheat, but other light colored grains). The flavor is very balanced. The malts are bready and slightly sweet. The hops provide just a bit of bitterness to the finish. I wouldn't call it a bitter beer; the hop level is just right for a pale ale like the Red Seal. The mouthfeel is just right for the style as well; medium body, light carbonation, and a normal level of coating. It's a bit sticky but not sweet or sugary. It's supremely drinkable. This is the kind of beer almost and craft beer drinker could enjoy multiple rounds of. Plus, it's appropriate year round. I like this beer a lot.

Smell is good, hops and caramel, pretty spot-on for the style. Taste really doesn't do anything for me, much too watery and bland. It definitely could use some more hops, the slight flavors I pick up are a light fruity malt and a bit of bread in the aftertaste. I think I'm even getting a hint of booze which to me is unacceptable for a 5.5%. The hops along with some buttery-like sweetness seem to make themselves more known about half-way through which helps this beer a bit. Mouthfeel is definitely thin, a watery malty taste lingers afterwords. Aftertaste starts to reminds me of Magic Hat's #9 for some reason. Easy to drink, quite inoffensive, not terrible, somewhat refreshing, but overall pretty boring and watery. You can get a 6-pack of Nugget Nectar for 2 bucks more than a 6-pack of this.

The aroma is mostly hopped but there is a kind of cherry-like note in there. The mouthfeel runs about medium. The taste is full of bitter hops, caramel malts, and a mixture of toffee and honey.

Develops as you drink it, and makes you want another. A good session+ amber beer, made from what used to be one of the best breweries in the world.

This beer is very drinkable given its average abv. Overall, I was disappointed in this beer, it was nothing like I remember it being.

This is one of the hoppier reds I have tried. Sweet maltiness hits the tongue with flavors of fresh-baked bread, followed by a clean, crisp hop finish. The finish is reminiscent of fresh fruit, yet with an almost steely character. This beer is very clean. It goes in and the flavors only last while on the palate.

Medium-bodied, the carbonation more of a big expansive foaminess than finer prickle. Pizza crust, wheat bread, general toasted dough quite prevalent with a noticeable grapefruit, orange citrus thrust to it. The poor brown earth, stone and matted grasses components evoke a meadow field. The dryness begins to wear out the palate after some time, here the malts a little roasted to smooth out the ride.

Wet grains, slightly musty malt, toasted malt and some hints of wood balanced by a bold hoppiness on the finish. Crisp and solid and a great flagship.

Like I said it's one of the most balanced ipa type beers I've tried. It doesn't have a ton of hop bite nor a ton of malty sweetness, but it seems to blend the two perfectly with the hops dominating in the end. With that said, the sweetness never totally goes away. It's midbodied in mouthfeel and goes down very smooth. Coats the tongue and tingles nicely. Good Beer, great brewery. Definitely try the Old Rasputin and Old Stock Ale that North Coast puts out.

5,28.2,5,5,5,5,5,"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy light amber-red body with a good inch of off-white head that leaves some nice lacing. Aroma consists of equal parts pungent sweet caramel-honey maltiness and crisp citrussy American hops. Wow. Tastes sweet and malty initially, with caramel, honey, and slight biscuit notes, with a fair bit of support from grassy and citrussy American hops and a semi-dry finish. On the lighter side of medium-bodied with a fair bit of carbonation which is just subtle enough to enhance the drinkability. Super-drinkable, though not so much so that any of the other attributes, most notably flavor, take a back seat. Unbelievable. Practically perfect in every imaginable way. Tastes to me like home-brewing smells. For the style and for any beer, this is about as perfect as they come - it's the first perfect '5' I have ever given. Amazing.","MrHurmateeowish","Jul 25, 2008"

On the palate, however, the malts make themselves much more present. Rich Munich and crystal malts really round out this beer with a bit of bitterness to finish. Hop flavor is quite a bit more muted than the aroma. Carbonation and mouthfeel are spot on for style. This is quite a nice drinker, next to St. Rogue Red for my favorite.

Head was initially 3 fingers, but dropped down to 1, and consisted of off white foam, almost like a meringue that clung very well to the sides. Aroma was hoppy, maybe a bit of vanilla, and reminded a bit of a good deli pickle for some reason. Tasted initially sweet, then shifted to buttermilk pancake, then became slightly bitter. Mouthfeel was a little lacking considering the initial sweetness. It was a little too watery for a beer that tasted this way.

Brown sugar, and subdued red apples on the background. Palate shows about the same as the nose, but on a little darker side with a little bit more scorched malt characteristic.

This flavor dominates till almost very end, then the bitterness brings itself out again at the end. The feel is very medium bodied at the start, and as it crosses the palate it gains some heftness to its texture. There is also the slight tingle of carbonation at the back end. A fairly decent beer, very solid aroma, is almost let down by an inconsistant flavor. The feel is let down a bit by the carboanation.

This faded some, and then the hops came into play with a floral character. Phenols and malty sweetness were present, but secondary to hops. Flavor was a biscuity malt, with the hops moving to second place. Hops offer some balance throughout, but were most noticeable in the finish. I believe I picked up a hint of green apple in the flavor, and some pepper at the finish. A fairly light bodied beer with medium carbonation.

Mild alcohol bite warms the palate (pleasant), then finishes fairly clean with a slight hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is clean and slick, due to the medium body and subtle carbonation. This beer is closer to the English style pale ale, rather then the American style, but in any case, this brew is top notch! Very drinkable....I could kill a 6'er of this on a Friday night with ease!

For starters, the beer looks good: slightly cloudy red-orange color, cuddly off-white head with formidable retention and penny-penched lacing. An herbalesque nose, with a touch of coriander, orange citrus, and earthy (on the idea of peaty) maltiness. The flavor is wonderfully balanced, with a crisp bite and quenching burst of dryness. Obvious malt and trumpeting hops. Red Seal has a linger to it, but it's a welcome one. Almost a smokeless (natural) tobacco and fruity finish.

But I don't enjoy most pale ales, so I was a little disapointed here. I absolutely prefer this to most if not all straight (truly pale) pale ales, but that is more a style preference. If this is instead just a ""dark"" pale ale, well, okay, than for this is fairly drinkable within that style. As an amber, per what I was expecting, it misses the mark.

4.1,5.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Got a growler of this last evening. More or less just got it on a whim, as I wanted to try something that I have not had before on tap. Luckily I was not disappointed in the least. The color of the beer in the growler was a amber/orange color. When poured from the growler a nice head was formed that was the color of off white hedging on a tan color. Had a good retention leaving lacing around the sides of the glass. The aroma is very nice, citrus and floral hop smell. Definitely can pick up the grapefruit like esters. Also has a nice malt scent of caramel malt that is noticeable, as the hop scent does not seem to be overpowering. Brew has a very smooth taste; nice amount of hop flavoring is noticeable and does leave some of its essence on your tongue. While the hops is most noticeable they dont seem to dominate as I am able to clearly pick up the balancing of the malts that lead to a somewhat caramel flavor. Over all this was a fantastic brew, one that I can/could drink a fair amount off. The growler was gone quite quickly! Will look for this one again in the future.","Stimack","Mar 05, 2006"

Taste is an exellent blend of the malt and strong hops. Starts of with a slighty sweet breadness then quickly turns to citrus, bitter, mildly herbal, and a floral hops punch. Beautiful west coast APA. A superb, great tasting and hoppy beer that is in my fridge almost all the time. I appreciate beers like this one sooo much.

Not one of North Coast's finer offerings.

Good complex malt flavors bring out ripe plumbs, light syrup, and a light grain flavor. Hop bittering is big. This beer should be an APA rather than an Amber (if it were not for the color).

It's well-balanced between malt & hops, with a bit more emphasis on hop bitterness than on hop flavor. Aroma is malty/bready and quite pleasant. Definitely a beer I could sit and drink happily while watching a football game. Much better on tap than in the bottle.

This is another fine California pale in stubbies (Sierra Nevada, Steelhead) which are all quite distinct, but interchangeably good. Red Seal is maybe the darkest of the bunch, even approaching robust red ale territory, with lots of malt and lots of hops. The hops do leave a lingering mark on the tongue which I personally am not crazy about, almost a burnt rubber quality, but many a hophead will love this very same aftertaste.

Nicely balanced maltiness with well expressed hop bitterness. Finishes sweetly, but contains a complex bitterness that lingers long after the final swallow. Overall, a nice flavor. Not world class, but well above average and true to the style. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy with just the right amount of carbonation.

I would say the taste is exactly like the smell you get hit with sweet caramel flavors at the front before it fades into a nice citric bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good and on par with what you would expect of a good APA. This stuff couldnt be more drinkable, it is tasty and very easy on you palette and it goes down oh so smooth.

Minimal head, but I hardly missed it staring into that enchanting body. Thick, chewy caramel malt on the nose, blended seamlessly with flowery citrus hops, just an enticing sweetness to it all. The flavour delivers everything that has been promised so far, the malt and hops dance step for step in balanced unison, sweet malt and sweet flowery hops in a star-studded blockbuster musical from the 40's. Full mouthfeel that becomes almost but not quite oily on the finish, maintaining that smooth velvety character while the texture alters slightly but holds its integrity. I was a sucker to only buy one of these, and given the chance over again, would be laying down cold hard cash for more to fill the fridge with.

The taste is excellent and i believe to be a prime example of an American Pale Ale with a northwest touch. Malt profile like an english pale ale but generously hopped with American varieties.

The taste was good but typical pale ale, not all that well balanced, but there was some malt. The mouthfeel was rather nice, medium body with carbonation that awoke the mouth.

Pale Ales are one of my favorite styles and it's very hard to find one that really stands out without becoming something different like a light, boring IPA. This is a true west coast Pale Ale (APA?). Poured a deep amber with a red hue and light wispy off white head with nice solid lacing down the glass. The smell was pretty hoppy with a nice fruit nose (citrus, but not acidic) and grapes, maybe? The taste was heavy on the pine and citrus hops, very nice juicy fruit notes and a very solid malty caramel backbone. A little chewy (which I like) and full bodied but crisp ---- the fruit overtones were right on. The mouthfeel was very bright and crisp with bitterness lingering way after the last sip but I wanted more of the same after the first bottle. This is very drinkable brew and with a decent ABV (just right, not enough to kill a horse) this is clearly one of the best sessions brews as well as a serious Pale Ale/APA. Right up there with SNPA, Liberty Ale and that's about it.","Gasp100","Mar 26, 2004"

A flavor of toasted wheat greets the tongue, and then the flavor becomes progressively more bitter before closing with a tingle on the tip of my tongue that has a distinctly medicinal feel. Notes of sweet citrus are here as well, and a distinctive malty aftertaste that lingers long. A very fruity tasting APA. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style: just slightly chewy and coating in action.

The taste is quite complex, although all the flavors are very light. There is a butter taste, some good malt hints, and a citrusy tone, with the typical hop flavor blending into a nice light bitter aftertaste. There are very subtle floral grassy hints. The mouthfeel is wonderful, and as I drink this, I can only picture myself enjoying it on a nice warm summer night, sitting on a porch on a lake.

Gorgeously refreshing and fullfilling, this is a beer pretty much without flaw, though it ain't spot on perfect, and it doesn't want to be-a beer for all.

The flavor has all of the great things I expect from a west-coast pale ale, very crisp with cereal grainy malt and great rindy bittering hops. Perhaps not as hoppy as some, but still excellent. Hops do come out more at the back, leading to a crisp dry finish with a slight sweetness to help it down. I'd definitely have several more of these. I'd be happy drinking this all night.

There's no olfactory rocket science here; there's a malt/hops balance, with each element trading dominance a few times, making for a refreshing ale. There's no muss, and no fuss, just the basics, and there's no way I stop at just one of these. It just goes to show you: sometimes, simple truly is better.","Foxman","Jan 25, 2004"

There's a distinct hoppy aroma, coupled with a tangy lemon substrata and some malts lurking around somewhere beneath that. The initial taste is less hoppy than I anticipated from the smell, but the hops become increasingly assertive as the taste lingers. Bubbly carbonation creates a tingly mouthfeel.","longpondbeerman","Jan 03, 2004"

Taste is well balanced, pine and grapefruit mingle with a subdued malt background of darrker fruits and a touch of toffee. A solid, good drinking pale ale that has many characteristics of an IPA.

Some pine resin as well. Medium in body, with a touch of acidic dryness that appears on the tail end. The flavor thins out a bit towards the end, but still manages a decent finish.

A majestic appearance, it held a thin but fluffy head, and really impressive lacing. A pretty nice hop bouquet was evident in the smell, with just the right touch of malt. Interesting grapefruit or banana smell somewhere in there, too. The taste held a nice hoppiness...bitter but counterbalanced well by a sweeter malt presence. It reminded me somewhat of an IPA with obvious red ale characteristics. The crisp, clean mouthfeel was full of flavor, and nice and fizzy on the tongue.

The Red Seal Ale pours amber with and orangish tint, and it's complemented by a nice full cream toned frothy head. The lace forms with the first sip and continues to stick throughout this beer's existence in my pint glass. The aromatic hops leave me wanting to sip on this beer, but there is also some malt sweetness detectable in the background of the aroma. The first sip, very well balanced with the sweetness of the malts attacking my tongue, and the hops being there to wash everything but the mellow bitterness on my tongue. Very enjoyable, complex with a dry finish that makes these flavors all work together very nicely. I am a fan of other brews I tried from North Coast, namingly the Imperial Stout. This proves they have range, with a medium body this beer has a semi chewy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, could picture how this stuff tastes on tap.

3.87,-0.8,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Noticeable reddish and very cloudy hew once poured into the glass. Just the whispiest of heading bubbles which quickly subsided. Aroma was a great abundance of hoppiness. First taste provided a rather bold bitterness; subsequent sips revealed much more malty character with fine balance. I am not sure of this one; hence my 3.5 taste ranking. I suspect my bottle may have lingered around a bit? My first North Coast Brewing (Mendocina County, CA), hoping some day to try more.","Hobbz","Feb 14, 2003"
3.93,0.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,5,"Pours a clear amber with a small, white, foamy head that comes back with a simple twirl of the glass. The aroma is mostly hops. Malt and hops come through well balanced in the taste. The hops take over quickly and then provide a long bitter aftertaste. It's very crisp and enjoyable though, not overly bitter. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Overall, this is a very refreshing and smooth beer. I will be buying more of this when summertime finally rolls around.","AudioGilz","Feb 06, 2003"
4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"pours out a hazy, cloudy, darker amber color. thin, wispy head that leaves a nice bit of lace. delicious malty aroma, balanced with some of those aromatic and pungent northwest hops. tastes absolutely delicious....a fine balance between the bready, nutty, caramel laced malts and the chewy citrusy hops. what's nice about this american pale ale is that it seems to lean more on the malts rather than the northwest hops. a nice balance between the two gives way to a nice full mouthfeel. wow is this a fine brew!! full figured body....ample balance...beautiful taste...sweet smelling...smooth finish...teasing aftertaste...high drinkability...what more could you want? a top notch american pale ale. i'll be drinking more of this!","budgood1","Feb 05, 2003"
4.8,23.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"The slighty chill hazed copper body is topped by a rocky head more than three fingers tall. Outstanding lacing. A strong, grapefruit nose, with a hint of background pine. A nice malty backdrop starts the taste, but the story here is the grapefruit grove of hops which arrive shortly thereafter, and hang around long after the actual beer has departed. Rich and silky and oily, the mouthfeel is wonderful. Drinkability? One of the few quality beers I've had four of in an hour. Simply a great American Ale, whether pale or red. Welcome back to Jersey.","RonfromJersey","Feb 02, 2003"
4.47,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an orange amber color with a bubbly white head that dissipates into a nice amount of lace. Nose is dominated by sweet grains with notes of floral hops and a bit of fruity citrus. Taste starts sweet and crisp followed by a strong amount of hop resins, acidic citrus, and bitter grapefruit rind. Malt backbone does a nice job of holding everything together. Finish is crisp and dry. This is an outstanding American pale ale. Possibly my favorite example of the style.","Morris729","Jan 27, 2003"

3.83,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Well, this was something on the shelf so I decided to grab a sixer and try it out. Nice copper color and there was a great head on the initial pour. Head fizzled out after a couple of minutes though. Decent amber taste...almost like a McTarnhan's. Hints of carmel and citrus on the nose. This was a decent beer, but probably not worth the $8/six-pack the store was asking for.","sinistersteve","Dec 02, 2002"
4.13,5.9,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"If you're ready to jump into the world of west coast American style Pale Ales this is a good place to start.","johnrobe","Nov 27, 2002"
4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Honey colored with a sticky white head. It gives you a nose full of hops with a bit of sweetness. The taste is a real pleasure: a little citrus with nice malty sweetness and a good dose of hops. It has a terrific creamy feel, contributing to a very nice experience overall. Why would someone ever buy ""Poker Beer"" when beers like this are already out there?","mickeymac","Nov 05, 2002"
4.48,14.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"First, this beer looked great while being poured.  It was a true thing of beauty to watch the head being formed.  The head is three fingers tall and caps a copper colored brew.  Citrusy smell predominates.  There is more maltiness flavor then I remember the last time I tasted one.  Ah, there it comes.  The hops is staring to ramp up after a few sips leaving a bitter taste on the tongue.  Still I'm surprised at the maltiness flavors, I remember this being more hopped than I taste.  Of course, I just finished an IPA so that may have something to do with it.  Maybe a hint of caramel?  These go down easy.","mjohn27603","Nov 04, 2002"
4.57,17.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is, by far, one of my favorite brews on the market.  It is crisp and clean with some noticeable hops going on as well.  It has as well balanced flavor and mouthfeel that allows it to be paired well with just about any kind of grub.  If you can get your paws on it, do so.  You will not be disappointed.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Oct 18, 2002"
3.92,0.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A cloudy deep orange-amber with the head is voluminous in size and the texture semi-creamy, the color a toothsome light tan and the resultant lace a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt with a definite hop floral aroma, citrus crisp and clean, start is sweet with a pleasing malt profile and the top light to moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish has a stinging acidity with the hops powerful in their spiciness and the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting.","Gusler","Oct 02, 2002"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Red Seal Ale: wonderful looking beer, deep amber color, and thick off white head that leaves substantial lace down the sides of the glass.  Full aroma, markedly of hops.  Very nice taste, very prominent hops, with more than a hint of malt sweetness, notably caramel. Warm aftertaste, with a dry crisp bite, and alcohol warmth.  Very nice ale.","jackndan","Sep 28, 2002"
4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Red Seal was a pleasant surprise for me. It pours a nice copper hue with an orangish tint. The head is off-white and rather creamy. The nose is of hops, some citrus, and a bit of malt. This beer tastes great. It has some of the citrus aspects in addition to a well balanced hop-malt combination. The mouthfeel is creamy with an oily character near the end. The drinkability is quite good, also. For me, this one definitely has ""session beer"" written all over it.","Jon","Sep 14, 2002"
4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear amber with a reddish-orange tint and a full, fluffy off-white head that has excellent retention and leaves some good lace. The aroma is mainly of floral, grassy hops above a light caramel malt background. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is nicely creamy. The flavor offers a good combination of malt & hops. A gently caramel malt is backed by a solid, well balanced bitterness, and full of hop flavor with just a slight citrus note. A long lasting bitter and hoppy finish rounds it out. This beer is restrained enough to act as a cross-over beer for the uninitiated, while offering enough character and bitterness to hold the beer aficianado's interest. Extremely well made. A very drinkable, and enjoyable beer.","NeroFiddled","Aug 30, 2002"
4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,5,"Slightly hazy reddish / orange hue, topped by an off white well retained heterogenously bubbled head that leaves sparse lace. The aroma is a combination of medium caramel, berry like fruity esters and a crisp, citrusy Cascade hop nose. Flavorwise, this brew is skewed towards hop bitterness which is assertive, but not overbearing. Caramel malt sweetness & biscuit malt offset the hop bitterness, leaving this brew fairly well balanced all around. Expectedly citrusy hop flavor. Moderately bodied, w/ carbonation lower than the norm that adds to the drinkability. Finishes w/ a fading extension of caramel malt & moderate hop bitterness. Red Seal Ale exhibits balance, excellent drinkability & has a touch more malt character than the typical pale. It could serve as both a flavorful session brew and an enjoyable pale ale to be savored.","marc77","Aug 09, 2002"
4,2.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Red Seal Ale on-tap was very smooth and had a slight sweet velvety finish. Beautiful golden color with tight foam around the glass. As it warmed up it seem to creat a different complex of flavors! Very little bitter after taste! But, hoppy enough to enjoy.","BeerManDan","Aug 05, 2002"
3.8,-2.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Slightly better than average Pale Ale. Some of the strongest hops flavor I have ever experienced. Is that the norm for West Coast Pales? Dark gold in color. Crisp with a nice finish.","Dogbrick","Aug 02, 2002"
3.95,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a copper color, with a sticky, frothy off-white colored head. On the nose is a wonderful floral hop aroma. On the palate the hop spiciness is pretty much the whole story, along with a light/sweet fruitiness. Very enjoyable thougha very good pale ale.","WilliamPhilaPa","Aug 01, 2002"

My apologies to my pal Jaybeerman who is probably wanting to kill me right now. this is a fine beer that of course is even better cask conditioned.  It takes on a much smoother mellower quality in this form.  For all you California advocates get up to Fort Bragg.  For everyone else, if you're ever out this way this fine brewery is worth checking out.","Mark","Jun 23, 2002"
3.88,-0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"It poured out a nice reddish gold color to it. It formed a nice dark white head which it held with a considerable amount of lace. It had a nice aroma of hops and another aroma I couldn't place. The same was true of the taste. Had a nice taste and finish to it, but the flavor I couldn't place, which may have to do with my preferance for dark beers over red ales. A good beer and worth checking out.","Wildman","Jun 12, 2002"
4.18,7.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Deep tea with a persistent head and fine lacing. Hop fruity nose. Citric Cascade flavor over a smooth malt spine. Ignoring the weighty price, Ruedrich's is a perfect food and session brew. Hop and clean.","inebrius","May 26, 2002"
4.26,9.2,5,4,4.5,4,4,"Rich reddish brown color contrasts nicely with a thick off white head; sticky lace rings the glass.  Pleasant spicy aroma with strong hop notes, sweet aroma, and fruits.  Tasting yields a rich malty flavor, followed by strong hops and bitter citrus, slightly sweet towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy.  A very pleasing pale ale.","Pegasus","May 14, 2002"
4.24,8.7,5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice reddish orange with a creamy off white head that has good retention and rings the glass.  The smell is this beers weak point as it is a little thin but there is a nice hop presence in it.  The taste is excellent.  Nice smooth hoppy start that is balanced by just enough malt.  Nice citrusy hops stay tangy on the tongue even after you last sip is gone.  Very clean and smooth in the mouth with an excellent drinkability.  This is definitely one of my favorite APA's right up there with New River, Alpha King, and Poleeko Gold.  With the exception of their pilsner this brewery doesn't make anything but great beer.","Murph","Apr 22, 2002"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Excellent golden-amber brew.  Nice, thick head that fades just a bit too quickly for my taste.  Still, a thin lace covered the top of the beer until the end.  Hoppy aroma and taste.  Malty caramel taste also present, and even begins to become prominent as the beer warms.  Went very well with a chicken parmesan sandwich and a few games of 9-ball.","Viking","Apr 07, 2002"

Not quite as malty as solid stand-by Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, and not quite as hopped as trusty Anchor Liberty Ale, and thereby a pretty darn perfect balance in my book. Very smooth and well crafted. Hopsters - seek this out. Will be a regular in the garage fridge.","Brent","Mar 10, 2002"
3.95,1.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Light amber color, sticky head. Butterscotch malt with a high hop spice to balance. One of the more complex Pales I've had -- cascades and caramel flavors dancing back and forth. Pleasant enough to drink though there's not a lot of distinction here. I've had some that tend to sour...","ADR","Mar 06, 2002"
4.83,23.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Copper colored beer with a thick bubbly slightly off-white head that kept very well. Spicy hops in the nose with hints of clove and caramel. Awesome balancing act with slight grapefruit and clove-like spice in the hops and a slightly burnt toffee and caramel taste to the malt. Very slight esters from the yeast, mildly strawlike and bready. Easy drinking, beautiful, exceptionally well balanced beer... easily a true classic and favorite...","hooligan","Mar 04, 2002"
