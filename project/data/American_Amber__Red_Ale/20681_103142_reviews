"Disappointed by this beer that really seems to be trying to do too much."

"not a big fan of red ales but this one is worth drinking any day."

"Very tasty, I think it is really vibrant toward the beginning with a nice hoppy blast, but then gets quite drying and heavy with some malty and drying earthy bitterness notes. All around a very tasty beer, but not up to Maine's other amazing beers,"
"Poured the yeast accidentally and made it chalky. I think that ruined the hop flavor"

"One of 5 MBCs that I received.  Dark red ale.  Full bodied. Little heavy for my liking."
"Big thank you to Fernsanity for getting me a bottle of this to try.  A delicious red ale."
"Proabably a bit old. Way too malty."
""
""
"Stately (as noted in a review by Alex___), love the look/color of the beer - each glass poured is award-winning art.  Consistent deep cranberry color throughout with no overpowering notes but an exceptionally balanced red with envious yeast quality."

"Like most of MBC's beer I like this one a lot. A very good rewarding beer."
"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/4/2014. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange zest, pine, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of citrus/tropical hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice red ale. All around good complexity, balance, and robustness of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"Man I'm really digging whats going on here. The more I drink the better it gets. I'm picking up earthy hops, pineapple, lemon zest, resiny pine and grass all mixed in with ample malt, dark cocoa, fig, date and char."

"Had this on 2014-12-26 in Lititz, PA"

"The palate opens with a big, juicy bitterness, pungent, resiny, fruity grapefruit, pine and orange peel. This is followed by a blend of caramel, a little buckwheat honey and burnt sugar before a long and brilliantly bitter finish dominated by the most gorgeously oily and resiny feel. This is by no means the oiliest beer there ever was, nor does it come close, but instead exudes great depth. This is further enhanced by a soft and supple carbonation. Fantastic stuff, Maine Beer has always impressed with the mouthfeel on their beers but this one is remarkable. Recommended for fans of Nugget Nectar."

"O- Overall, very good and funky. The hops outshine the malt in this beer. I wish the malt made more of an appearance."
"Pours a dark cloudy amber with a large lasting beige head, good lacing. Aroma starts with a floral citrus nose, slowly the tangy notes of grapefruit find there way thru followed by a sweet caramel flavor, some orange comes in as well on the back end. A medium to full body smooth on the palate, good carbonation and a sticky mouth feel. The finish is a combination of sweet caramel malt tones, citrus, orange and a tangy grapefruit hops bitterness flavor are left lingering on the palate and taste buds. Overall a wonderfully full flavored and tasty brew for those who dare. enjoy with caution."

"This one has a BIG hoppiness to it. Probably not a good idea to pare it up with a meal unless you happen to be eating something quite robust, but it’s absolutely delicious. It didn't really seem like either a Red IPA or hoppy Amber Ale. It tasted like a great IPA with a slightly dark color."

"This is a very good hoppy amber that easily could be called a Red IPA (regardless of what MBC claims). It's very hoppy, but it's got a dry, grainy malt bill that comes through very strong and clean."

"Thanks, jlindros. Pours a nice bright, reddish, copper-ish amber color. It seems to be fairly hazy, though it is a bit hard to tell. The head is cream colored and puffs up quite nicely. Easy to swirl back up, as well. Lots of little bubbles. Good lacing and retention. Lots of hops in the aroma. I’m getting earthy and fruity flavors: berries, citrus, grass, pine, spice. The hops dominate, but there’s a solid malt character underneath. Toasty caramel and brown sugar. Mild bready sweetness. Good dose of nutty flavor. Mild vanilla. The taste is dry, particularly for the style, and medium bitter. Dried out crystal malt caramel backbone with that spicy, earthy, fruity hoppiness on top. Starts off with honey and caramel before the grapefruit rind and pine resin bitterness takes over, bringing with it all of the more delicate hop notes, as well. Lots of hop flavor in finish, which hits with a nice shot of bitterness and lingering fruit. Prickly carbonation. Seems a touch higher than most Ambers. Light feel for a 7% abv beer, not really surprising since it’s rather dry. I don’t love the style, but this is an excellent example and a very well made beer. It’s dry and bitter with good flavor. Easy to drink. Seems like it would go great with pizza."

"Overall: A fine red ale. I like hoppier red ales, and this is definitely on the hoppy side."
"o. Debated long and hard between 4 and 4.25, but I always go with taste in the end - and this beer is complex and balanced and I would visit it again anytime."

"Overall - this was an outstanding beer and I am happy I tried it. I think it travels better than some other MBC offerings I can find in my area. Mean Old Tom is still my favorite, but this gives it a run for the money. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
"O: MBC hasn't disappointed me yet; really enjoyable to drink;"
""
"O - My least favorite Maine Beer so far but not bad by any means. Just a bit too heavy on the hops. Would have liked to seen them dialed down a bit and the malt come through a bit more. I would buy a lot more of their beer if it was offered in 12 oz 4-packs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an enjoyable beer that would be welcomed at a lower pricepoint as it would be great to always have on hand. Somewhat reminiscent as Arrogant Bastard, but more balanced than an all on hop assault."
""
""
""
"Like the aroma the roasted barley malts kick in on the first sip but the hops quickly scuttle that and take things over bringing out this piney, floral, bitter finish. Quite a hopped up version of amber red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth but drier feel with a dark roast bitterness."
""
""
""
"O - I really think this might be my favorite from Maine Beer Company. I've always been impressed with their output, and this is no exception. It does, however, come with a hefty price tag.... this beer is not cheap (at least in Massachusetts) Not a huge fan of that. But for that once in a awhile splurge, be sure to try this."

"Big tan head atop a ruby hued beer with tons of lacing left behind. Floral, spicy, and earthy hop presence with a crusty toasted bread like backdrop. Taste follows with the floral hops and perfectly balanced by that toasted malty backdrop. Taste is good but somewhat linear and one dimensional. Medium mouthfeel and bigger carbonation than I was expecting. This is a good red ale but I don't prefer it to the likes of Nugget Nectar."

"Overall: Another great beer from Maine! Been wanting to try this one for a while and was totally stoked when a work friend texted me that he could pick one up! They just don't know how to disappoint at Maine Beer. If you are able to get one of these do yourself a favor and do it."
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice hoppy red ale to drink for a long time."
""
""
"Overall another excellent beer from this excellent brewery. Time for them to go to four packs so the Brice can improve!"
""
""

"Overall: Another fantastic beer from MBO. My only gripe would be that the smell seemed the same from each of their other beers but who knows. A fantastic beer nonetheless."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: Good stuff. If this were priced like NN, I'd be happy to buy it regularly when NN was off-season, as it's a nice substitute."
"O: A very enjoyable, well done beer. Quite focused and certainly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O - The body is just too weak for me. The flavors are all really nice, but I can't sink my teeth into the beer. With the high carbonation and thin body, it drinks more like a soda in my opinion. Worth a try and certainly not a bad beer, but it's not a beer I'd be picking up again. That said, I am a big fan of Maine Beer Company who make a lot of fantastic beers."

"Overall: This beer is extremely drinkable. MBC makes a point to say that this beer is not a ""red IPA."" Although I prefer a greater hop presence in a red ale, this beer is perfect for what it is intended to be. For that reason, taste gets a five. Bravo MBC for achieving such a scrumptious beer that showcases the hop and malt profile in such a fresh and crisp manner. This is my first time trying anything from Maine Beer Company, and I look very forward to trying others if this beer is any reflection of the quality coming from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"This one, my peeps, is a keeper."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty nice, good hop character, nice malty base for an amber, cross between an amber and nice IPA almost. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper color with intense foam head. Noticeable lacing; and for me, a very powerful citrus aroma. Grapefruit appears to be the dominate one here. Tastes superb with nice biting hops on the palate. Very easy to drink and quite smooth. Not a super fan of the red ale style but this is by far one of the best I've tried. Again, Maine Beer Co., has come through with a really decent brew. Glad I could try this relatively fresh. Very nice and highly recommended!"
"Another stellar hop forward offering from Maine Beer but I'm noticing a trend. Is Red Wheelbarrow that different from Zoe? Or Lunch form Another One? They do what they do well I guess. I seem to remember Zoe being a bit messy so maybe I just contradicted my own criticism."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" I liked it well enough but I think it's a touch too hoppy to be an amber."
""
"O: Not worth the exorbitant price ($7.29) and badly outdone by Zoe in my opinion. THis might spell the end of buying Maine's tres cher beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, but overall not recognizable or standoutish. I understand that's what some people want but there is just nothing terribly unique about the wheelbarrow. Don't take this as I don't like it, rather it's hard not to compare to another one, lunch, dinner and even though they are different styles I feel this one feel a little short."
""
""
"O-enjoyable amber ale, flavorful"
""
"Poured a amber brown body with two finger head and lace patches. The aroma is real hoppy with notes of grass and maybe pine along with a decent chunk of caramel and a little bread. This is a more hoppy red and one of the hoppier ones that gets it right. Hops are the star as the beer is balanced and has both a bread/cracker like crispness in the finish and caramel sweetness, but these are underneath a real citric and fresh hop bite that is very pleasing."
""
"Notes: Bottled 10/22/13 and drank after the 90 day recommendation."
""
""
""
""
"Just a darn good beer. Well done. Great character and plenty to offer the senses."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"16.9oz bottle with a bottled on date of 022514. Pours a murky rust color with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is piney hops, toasted malts, and caramel. The taste is pine hops, orange peel, toasted and caramel malts. Floral hop notes as well. Light pine with lots of toasted and caramel malts at the end. Pretty malty. Light mouthfeel that is a bit oily. I prefer Zoe over this one. Overall, nothing special, but not bad."
""
"Pours a stunningly clear red brown color with a huge fluffy milky white head that persists forever. Huge citrus hop aromas are nicely countered with a bit of caramel and toffee as well as hints of dark pitted fruits. The flavor is solidly malty with caramel and toffee up front with hints of dried fruits. Citrus earth and pine sweep in quickly to cut right through the fruity sweetness. Lingering hop bitterness last long after every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Another great beer from Maine beer. I would drink so much of this shit if I weren't forced to buy it in 7 dollar pint bottles. Love your beer, hate your price point!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Full mouthfeel, puckers the cheeks, finishes with a carbonation tingle. Great beer."
""
"Pours a deep, dense head of minimally three fingers, very even surface, light brown in hue, very impressive looking, slides immediately down the side of the tilted glass, only a rare streak of lacing to be found, the overall retention is excellent. Filmy amber red in color with a healthy glow, you have to get really close to see the active bubbles within, overall the color may be closer to brown than orange, on the dark side. The nose mixes cocoa. floral water, orange peels, baking spice and a stiffening amount of bright hops and hard crust baguette, while there’s little that is bitter it never feels too sweet, the peach, apricot, red cherry, pear fruit scents are much more complementary than the star of the show. Medium-bodied, creamy mouth feel with close to zero softness, has an understated muscularity. Not a lot of roast, dryness comes from the grassiness, dark chocolate powder, bread grains and bare touch of black pepper. Caramel, spiced oranges, chamomile, basil and oregano, the breadiness is not sweet but is a steadying cornerstone. Peach, apricot, nectarine fruit with a touch of pineapple. It has a slimmed down fluidity which you don’t find often these days in this beer category. Goes on and on at the end, entirely unforced."

"The beer pours a fairly creamy light tan head that lasts quite a while. The beer itself is a dark, cloudy red with hints of orange and brown. Leaves some lacing behind but not a lot and in clumps. The smell has a strong hop presence with an even stronger roasted and caramel malt nose. The caramel malts seem to dominate the smell and the hops compliment it rather than dominate. The taste is different from the smell. While the caramel and roast malt notes are still there, the hops tend to dominate the pallate. The mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly with a slightly dry finish. Overall, a fantastic beer and worth getting."

"A nice hoppy amber. Strong on aroma but I prefer more bittering hops personally."
""

""

"O: This was a pretty tasty, hoppy red ale. Not balanced…but very good. Recommended."
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark red amber with a fine light two-finger, walnut colored head that kept growing for quite a while after pouring. Looks like a sundae. Aroma of piney and citrus hops, light malt. Flavor is dense, biscuit malt, resiny pine and citrus hops, grapefruit rind, hints of lots of odd flavors, like holiday spicing and chocolate. Finishes with a pleasant citrus hop and fruit bitterness. Medium bodied with good creaminess, nice mouth feel. This is a beer that seems to have a lot going on, but the flavors are so well integrated that it is difficult to identify them. Very pleasing and balanced. Great dry malt and nice hops. Excellent. Thanks to Vikki for bringing this gem back from Maine."

"This is quite a hoppy Amber ale. The base of crystal malt is present enough to provide a bit of balance. The hop provides a black pepper kick. The taste is too complex but it's tasty. Good body with a bit of spritziness."

"O: a solid Maine beer with the dry-hop bitterness, combined with with a certain amount of lingering maltiness that is typical of the brewer. Not overpowering in any aspect, but probably a little more hoppy than your normal amber, happily so."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep, hazy reddish amber capped by luxurious two and half finger cream colored head. Excellent retention, significant splotchy lacing. Light caramel and citrus, especially mandarin orange and tangerine, bread & grain on the nose. The taste follows the nose with some added complexity: caramel, mandarin orange and tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, ahints of cranberry and grainy accents. Finishes fairly dry with orange rind bitterness. Medium bodied with a pleasant smooth and silky mouthfeel; medium to high level of carbonation. This brew was thoroughly enjoyable, despite being one of my least favored styles. Delivers in every category."
""
""
""
"Overall: Maine Beer Company always makes great hoppy beers! This is a good beer, but Zoe is far superior when comparing American amber ales brewed by Maine Beer Company. Maine Beer Company beers always have that premium mouthfeel from the bottle conditioning which always distinguishes their beers from other hoppy beers. I will always be a fan of this east coast brewery!"
""
"O: While its by no means old and faded, I've had it for a few weeks and I wish I had drank it sooner. Still a fabulous beer despite my rookie mistake."
""
"(O)- Definitely a solid amber. Definitely on the hoppy side for the style but well-made. The quality of the beer is obvious, but its a bit steep for $7 a bottle."

"O - MBC has yet to disappoint. They are simply producing some of the best beers out there right now, with a ""house flavor"" all their own, yet still within a earshot of the stated style. I'd love to have this one in the summer, but still works great in the dead of November."
""

""
""

"Overall - Probably the most disappointing beer I've had from Maine. The hops are really harsh in this. Difficult to drink the whole bottle."

"The beer pours a caramel amber with a massive head of light, toffee-colored, creamy, mid-sized bubbles that last, leaving a ring of sticky, fat lacing on the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is clear and clean, but with a pronounced haze, perhaps from the heavy use of hops in the beer. On the nose, the beer smells richly of citrus grapefruit and prickly pine. The caramel malt is also nicely present, giving the nose caramel bread notes. Sweet citrus pith is dominant on the nose, however, and provides a nice aroma. The yeast character is clean and faint on the nose, and as the beer warms you do get a touch of hot alcohol on the nose, unfortunately. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter and softly roasty, with a nice bready sweetness balancing out the sip. Mild citric acidity plays into the finish, where the beer dries out and gives the tongue a nice bitter click. In flavor, the beer begins as caramel roast, almost like a light ice coffee with toffee syrup. Citrus quickly swims onto the tongue, providing strong grapefruit flavors. The finish is like grapefruit juice with a touch of medicinal bitters and caramel bread, and the aftertaste is citric bitters and sweet toffee and bread. As the beer warms, the rich malt does appear more pronounced in the aftertaste, giving off warm oat bread flavors with a touch of caramel and toffee. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, almost light, but with a creamy carbonation and crisp mouthfeel that provide for a very interesting sip. There is a slight, resiny stickiness left in the mouth after the swallow. Overall, this is a more hop-forward amber ale, but it gives beautiful malt character as well. As the beer warms, more and more of the caramel bread can be sensed in the beer. The balance ends slightly on the bitter side, which will appease any hop heads, but the malt balance is also delicious. This beer is another success from the MBC, and honestly might give Zoe a run for her money. A side by side test will need to be administered."

"honestly, this is probably my favorite of all the maine beers, i feel like every one i have is better than the last (except for lunch, i wasn't greatly impressed with it) but i sincerely do mean it every time. definitely pick this one up, and drink it fresh!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is very enjoyable (IMO). Like all Maine Beer Company's beers this one doesn't disappoint. For me I like this one better than MO and I enjoyed MO better than Lunch. Falconer's Flight might be the hop strain for me. Even though it's not a Red IPA, but I pictured Flipside tasting more like this. Yet we we all know that didn't happen. Back to basics, this brew is Recommended."

"Unique brew, unlike any other red I've ever had. The flavors are unique individually; together, they create an earthy, smooth flavor. This brew is a bit sweeter and more dense than my favorite Maine Beer Co brew, Zoe. While I'll be perfectly happy grabbing Zoe whenever I want, I'll grab Red Wheelbarrow whenever it's available. Great stuff again from these guys."
"Overall just a really good solid and balanced amber, but definitely with a large hop presence to go with it. Another Maine offering that will please, particularly the hopheads."
"Great drinkable beer. Nice highs and lows and balances."
""
"O/D-Maine Beer Company, an almost automatic producer of delicious beer. I don't mind their relatively pricey bottles if the quality will consistently be this goddamn tasty."
"O: Interesting red. Not as big or hoppy as Zoe. Kinda combines a more traditional red with a modern hop bomb. It works - results in a more balanced but still hoppy brew. Very tasty and drinkable."

"Full bodied with a blast of dry, earthy hop bitterness that lingers over the sweet malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Sticky with resinous hop oils, subtle spiciness, grassy pine and earthy, soil-like flavor. Good hop flavor but not as complex as the nose suggests. A bit one dimensional and lacking the citrus/tropical fruit sweetness found in the aroma. Fortunately, there is plenty of flavorful malt sweetness filling this need and balancing things out nicely. Strong caramel malt presence with hints of toffee, biscuit, toast and subtle dark fruit sweetness. Really well balanced and easy to drink with no heat whatsoever. The malt backbone perfectly counters the dry bitterness of the earthy, floral hops. Similar to Zoe but more flavorful and better balanced in my opinion. I could drink several of these in one sitting."
""
""
""
"A hop-forward beer, easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great beer and another one well done from Maine Beer Co."
""
""
""
"D - I appreciate the hop-forward focus to this one, as I generally don't enjoy red ales with too much Crystal malt to them. Surprised Maine chose to do another Red Ale with Zoe already being plenty excellent, but this is pretty solid as well. As with other Maine offerings, the bitterness is potent although it never gets excessive (for my tastes anyway). Still, probably wouldn't down more than 500ml bottle in a session."
""
""
""
""
""
" O: No rocket science here, this is just a simple, pleasant beer. Don't over think it, just drink and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
"Like other maine brews light body with brisk carbonation but full feeling in the mouth. Subtle malt character on the front end with faint dark fruit sweetness, very dry hearty toasted baked breads roll into big hop character on the back end. Citrus and pine, slightly earthy and bold with the bitterness. A floral flavor lingers and bitterness builds with each sip. Hop and malt combine and create an almost savory sensation along the mid-palate. A touch of warm on the swallow. Mildly tannic and mouth scrubbing. Flavors linger for a while. Rustic tasting yet bright and fresh at the same time. A very good beer and extremely clean but very hard to get and very expensive in my area. I prefer Zoe."
""
""
"Hoppy and tasty. A great hoppy amber."
""
""
""

"OK, after a couple days of revelry, now for a moment of reflection and comparison. MBC's Zoe is a fine beer, too, and by memory I couldn't figure out the difference, so I put them side by side. The Zoe was from 10/8/13 and the RW was 10/22/13. The nose upfront was softer and more floral on the RW, while the Zoe was richer and deeper with gobs of pine. Mouthfeel and head were lush and fairly similar, but the carbonation on the RW felt lighter. The palate of RW was loaded with mango and citrus with malts that were light and sweet, kind of like vanilla and butterscotch. Swear it was like smelling the bark of a ponderosa pine out West. And Zoe was deeper in character with flavors more toward biscuit and toffee. Finish on both was smooth and lingering. Wouldn't kick either out of bed for eatin' crackers. Slurp."

"O: A good hoppy amber that borders on red IPA. There is quite a malt presence that backs up the hops and mellows them out a little, thus preserving the amber/red style. Very easy to drink, and worth the $5.99 price tag"

"The beer is well crafted, as MBC's beers are. However, it does not really do much for me because of the pine hop profile, but really good for those who love that hop profile. The beer really reminds me of Zoe."
"Red Wheelbarrow is you're larger than average red ale, at 7%, with an expressive and complex hop profile. You don't often come across a red that's this flavorful and, quite frankly, exciting. Another winner from Maine Beer Co."

"A hoppy amber that doesn't push too far. Loses a little of the malt and balance in the long run, but it's good. Carries that Maine Beer Co. profile and you can't really lose with it."

"overall a big bold roasty red. worth checking out, even if you don't dig the style."

"O: more akin to Torpedo than Nugget Nectar, mellow, roasty, malty, and slightly hoppy - slight chew, slight sparkle. Absolutely a beer to beer of you spot one."
"Bitter resiny hops and a toasted grainy malt character, slightly medicinal hop character. Aftertaste is clean and toasty. Medium bodied and clean, moderate bitterness, vaguely sweet and bitter marmalade flavors. Dry and bitter aftertaste, lots of residual malt sweetness. In the vein of super fresh Alpha King on a good day."

"Mouthfeel is good. Moderate body and mild carbonation give this a little heavier of a feel which is great for the Change of seasons. Bitterness is mild."
""
"Overall: This is a very nice, well balanced red ale. Quality hop flavor along with a solid malt backbone. While I'm not generally a big fan of red ales, this one is very good. So easy drinking, the only thing that stops this from being a regular of mine (which with its drinkability and flavor certainly could be) is it's availability and price point."
""
"Overall - A terrific hoppy red. Keep this hybrid style coming! With reds like these I might actually reach for the reds more often."
"Had this the day after it hit markets. Incredibly bland, standard red ale. Nothing special here. To call it hoppy, as they do, is a falacy. Maybe over the pond, but not here in America and certainly not compared to something like Lunch or Zoe. Time to go back to brewing good beer and not just being out to make money. Or at least make it less obvious the latter is your goal..."

"This is a treat for fans of hoppy red ales, on par with Lawson's Steve's Back Yard Red Ale 2013 batch, and almost as good as Fiddlehead Ruby Claire. This bottle was super fresh (4 days old) and a great new addition to the Maine Beer Co. lineup."
