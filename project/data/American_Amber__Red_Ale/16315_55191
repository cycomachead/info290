4.68,22.5,4.25,4.25,5,4.5,4.75,"Poured from the bottle into a sniffer. Probably my favorite red ale to date. Not a high ABV but loads of malty flavor makes up for it. Notes of carmel, malty sugar, toffee, and fruitless are tasted. There is crisp slightly bitter aftertaste that balances this beer out excellently. Had this beer after about two years of aging as well as new. Both tasted great with the aged one being more malty as expected. Seriously loved this beer and is highly recommended.","barfootbandit","Jan 30, 2015"

Maybe it's better on tap - hopefully I'll find out when I visit the Brewdog pub in Leeds early next year.","interzen","Dec 06, 2014"

It manages to be quite hoppy while at the same time keeping a strong malt flavor as well. It pairs excellently with the assortment of meats and cheeses available as part of the tasty pseudo-ploughman's lunch platter available at their Edinburgh location as well as with their punk IPA (I had both on tap that day for the first time and definitely not the last as rumor has it that they are opening several locations on this side of the pond next year). Altogether an excellent beer which I will be regularly buying in bottled form until such time as I can find it on tap again either in Scotland or the States.","MaddestHatter","May 11, 2014"

Body is OK but could be a shade thicker. Goes down a treat; would make a great fridge beer to keep around. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","May 08, 2014"

3.23,-15.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.25,"O: For me, the best American amber/red ales deliver an initial separation of bitter hops and sweet malts before presenting something of an integration of flavors on the finish. With this beer, however, once the flavors separate (and they do so immediately) they never come together. This gives the beer a crude, rough feel and makes it seem a bit sloppy, unrefined, and simplistic. Couple this lack of depth, subtlety, and complexity with a thinner than average mouthfeel, and one is left with a beer that is less an American amber/red ale and more of a thin, low-strength IPA. All the aromas and flavors one would expect to find in a beer of this style are here in one form or another, but the package, as a whole, never really comes together.","mrfrancis","Apr 27, 2014"

3.92,2.6,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Poured this Brew Dog staple from the 330 ml bottle into an English pub glass. I was greeted by a nice brick red hue, just short of brown, with around three fingers of tan head. Features a toasted caramel aroma with some citrus rind and hop spice apparent. Stated plainly, I was impressed by the flavor: Malt-forward but provides a decent flavor hops punch. I get raisin biscuits, faint molasses, and lightly toasted cereals providing the scaffolding, while tangerine rind and flesh, tobacco, floral pollen, black tea, pineapple, and maybe a hint of bramble fruit provide the decorations. Tasty. Smooth body is on the thin side perhaps but does coat the mouth a little, oily with a moderate soft carbonation. The fruity flavor notes develop nicely as the beer warms up. Finishes fairly crisp but does leave a malty echo and some earthy hops. One of the better red/amber ales I've tried in recent memory, clean crystal malt flavors and not cloyingly sweet, with a decent hop spice. I will be back.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 01, 2014"

Pine, grapefruit, berries, and a Nelson Sauvin-like fruity oiliness. Very nice malty balance without becoming sticky sweet.

Complex and well balanced with lots of flavor. It's kind of heavy so I don't think I could drink many of them in one sitting but they managed to pack a lot of flavor into a 5% ""session"" beer.

This added nicely to a mouthfeel that was otherwise on the watery and weak side.

This isn't nearly as fresh as the sub-one month old Hardcore I had the other day, but less than 3 months isn't that bad. It pours out a hazy deep red color with a finger of off-white head. The aroma is very nice, it's got earthy hops over a solid caramel malt. On the tongue, this unfolds as an aggressive ale. It comes on strong with citrus hops and sweet caramel malts that have just a touch of a roasty flavor. More pine and earthy hop flavors make themselves known on the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and thirst-quenching. Overall, this is a great ale. It's not a mind-blower, but I'll pick this up next time I see it fresh for sure. Just a solid, aggressive beer.","shand","Aug 26, 2012"

Taste follows, strong hops, but a sweet light fruit start. Finishes bitter with a just short of fresh hop flavor. Well made, but not quite as balanced as some of other red ales.

This is a pretty hard beer to rate, ambers and reds should be well balanced and this was not, if it was an IPA that wouldn't be a problem and if I didn't know this was a Red Ale I would have been pretty sure I was drinking an IPA. I thought the flavor and aroma were pretty nice but this beer was too over carbonated, at first I thought it might be infected since just about every gusher I have had was infected, but this one wasn't, it just had way too much carbonation. Drinkability wasn't that great either, it was too hoppy and bitter for me to have more then one. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it was just to expensive for what I got, if I wanted a beer that was like this one I would rather grab Lagunitas Lucky 13, it is better beer at a better price. I can't say I would recommend this to people looking for a good Amber Ale, it just doesn't do a good job at representing what that style is all about, but if hop heavy brews are your thing you might like it. This wasn't the best first impression with BrewDog, but I admire the fact that they don't care what people think and just do what they want, so I would like to try more of their brews but if the price point is similar to this beer it might be a while before I get to trying them.","StoutHunter","Jun 19, 2011"

Years ago in my school days a teacher once made the class taste ethanol (100% alcohol) for some reason. Those memories came flooding back.

What is surprising is how light and restrained the flavor is. It is kind of like a magic trick; it smells like a high abv west coast red ale and it tastes like the restrained, 5% amber that it is. Some of the grapefruit hop character comes back in the aftertaste, but it is only a shadow of what is present in the aroma. This bait and switch of hop character is somewhat jarring at first, but it actually works in a way because it allows the drinker to enjoy some intense, juicy hop aromas (with appropriate levels of malt to back them up) while leaving the flavor and alcoholic impact of a beer with sessionable alcohol content (by American standards, at least).

A mild caramel sweetness is prevelant as well and overall I'd say this beer is balanced. A good beer but a couple of minor setbacks as I found it to be a little slick and watery and the malts give off a buttery edge and then a real crisp, apple or pear like and dry finish (one could even say tart as the carbonation makes itself felt on the backend).","clayrock81","Dec 27, 2010"

It's not great, not even special so it's a little pricey for the product. Is just moderately drinkable.","aasher","Jul 23, 2010"

The hops are quite easy to identify- nelson, cascade, showcasing them nicely. The malt is playing a bit of a backseat but it's there and supporting well. Low in bitterness and pleasantly smooth. This is a really good red ale and I'm glad to see a well structured, balanced, fault-free, approachable beer from these guys.

This is a nicely hoppy beer with good British malt flavor. The aroma from the hops is floral, pine and citric, in that order, while the malt contributes lots of biscuity, doughy caramel goodness. The malt aroma holds its own against the hops with a luxurious depth, differentiating the beer from most American ambers and such. This is a hoppy ESB. The flavor is rich and full. There's a lot of good British beer flavor. It's not quite as bursting at the seams of its size but close. Mouthfeel is a tad slick. The aftertaste is hoppy and bitter. It's a very good beer, easily one of my favorites from BrewDog.","popery","Jun 18, 2010"

The label says ""iconoclastic amber ale, Product of Scotland," which intrigued me. As soon as I popped this bitch open, I was overwhelmed with the smell of hops. As primarily a darker beer kinda guy, I wasn't too sure I was gonna enjoy this brew. After one sip, my first thought was ""this tastes like a weak IPA."" I, for one, am not a fan of IPAs. But the more I sit here and sip this beverage, the more I can appreciate the smoothness. It's a drinkable beer by my taste buds, but it was a random purchase that I probably won't make again.

3.25,-14.9,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"I'll admit it: I have no idea what this brew's name means. Irregardless (remember, that word is spoken with a semi-Bostonian accent), it pours a clear amber-copper topped by a half-finger of light tan foam. The smell is of pine, citrus, peach, and caramel apple, complete with plenty o' nuts. The pine and citrus (mainly the peel in this case) run strong in the taste, with greenery, flowers, and a very light bit o' toffee. For me, a bit unbalanced in favor of the hoppier bits. The body is a light medium, making it a bit heavier than it oughta be; the moderately active carbonation and dry finish (combined with an aftertaste of orange peel) round out a feel that does not bring much of a smile to my lips. Still, the finished product is not all that objectionable...just not entirely desirable.

4.25,11.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"11.2 ounce bottle, Batch 483, best before January 19, 2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head. The bottle was a bit of a gusher when I opened it, but it didn't take long to settle down and make a decent pour. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is nice and hoppy, the brew smells mostly like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with a bit of caramel malt. Taste is the same as the aroma, but the citrusy hops come out stronger in the taste compared to the other flavors. There's also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, this is quite a sessionable brew! This is a good overall brew, it's one of the best amber ales I've had in a while.","bluejacket74","May 18, 2010"

Very little hop bitterness but a good amount of hop flavor. Thin-medium mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation.","Mora2000","May 15, 2010"
4.18,9.4,5,4.5,4,4,4,"Deep mahogany brown crimson amber hue with a huge flowing three finger sized head rising well above the rim of my glass. Nice chunky lacing clings to my tulip glass after the head settles down. Aromatics are piney and citrus alot of C hops going on here, American style amber for sure. Semi sweet caramel malt backings to go with the hop profile. Flavor has a nice acidic citrus tone with hints of tobacco/tea leaf/and earthy bitterness going on. Subtle caramel malt sweetness balances things quite nicely warming especially for only 5% abv. Mouthfeel is sharp with some upfront bitterness but mellows out in the finish, carbonation is sturdy and even body fills out somewhere in the middle. Drinkability overall is very nice, a beer that's expressive balanced and tasty with a reasonable alcohol content, now if we could work on pricing a bit. 3.19 a bottle isn't bad, but if were to buy a case I don't know if this beer would warrent that.","WVbeergeek","May 14, 2010"

Reminds me of the newfound 'Black IPA' beers that are popping up all over. This one falls into the same categorization as those while still managing to be unique tasting. Toasty malts give way to a big grassy hop flavor and a long, lingering bitterness on the finish. Im glad the ABV is kept low, keeps it drinkable and allows more of the hoppy goodness to shine through. Touch of sourness that, strangely enough, compliments the hops quite nicely. After shelling out the cash for this one, I found this plenty good enough to go try a couple more of B-dawgs offerings. This one is definitely worth giving a try.","twiggamortis420","May 01, 2010"
