"Pretty fruity initial taste then it starts tasting like a lager. It's meh"

"Another blast from the past that I reacquired...great stuff...a hybrid red that is great with many seafood (yes I said it) dishes...."
""
""
"No bottle date... reviewed as is."

"More like a brown ale, kind of a washed out finish"
"Just the right amount of malt/hops/abv taste. My go to beer when I want something good. Great finish."

"This is a light-bodied beer with a nice amber hew. It drinks much lighter than I would expect by looking at the color. The beer has no discernible hop aroma, and the finish is very short. I think it's just an easy-to-drink, everyday type of beer. I have had pilsner with more body, but hey...you can get this pretty inexpensively. I paid $12.99 for a 12-pack."

"Pours from the bottle a reddish amber with just the slightest hint of haze. Caramel malts and leather are present in the aroma. It tastes almost exactly as it smells; sweetness and spice, followed by a touch of bitterness. Medium mouth with a bit of oil. A decent enough brew, but nothing remarkable."
"Pours a slightly clouded ruddy amber with a creamy white head. The head dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma starts to develop a bit as it warms, with light sweet malt aspects. Unfortunately, the taste remains pretty lackluster with just some nondescript sweetness and a little earthy quality. The body does have a nice weight and feeling to it on the palate, (lighter and smooth). This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried back in early 2000s and unfortunately, it hasn't held up in comparison."

"A medium-bodied beer with a bit of dryness to it, the feel is nicely balanced as just enough is taken from the sweetness. It's plenty crisp and it's clean, getting pretty smooth from middle to finish."

"The price is what is greatest. Between Obama's America and his hidden inflation and the current trend of craft brews escalating in price, this is a much welcomed sensibility priced every day bargain pearl of a brew."

"Had this on cask at the local pub. It was the 2nd day of the cask, had a nice head to it the aroma was slight caramel and oats. The oatmeal taste was fantastic. Cask is the best way to enjoy this stout, it really brings out the taste. Had this on bottle once and thought it was just a middle of the road beer. Cask makes all the difference."

"I picked up a growler of Red Tail Ale from Minogue's Beverage in Queensbury, NY. This is a very good ale with a bold taste. Unforunately the keg kicked as my growler was being filled. It definately tasted better at Mendocino's tasting room in Saratoga Springs ,NY. I highly reccomend a trip there. Still it was a good beer at a very good price."
"A quality beer brewed local in Saratoga, NY. Amber Ale with a hint smell of alcohol and then hops. The same is with the flavor, the alcohol is tasted first followed by malted finish. I enjoy this amber ale, I am not sure if the alcohol percentage is correct because it is more like a strong ale. I do recommend this beer."
""
"Great red ale; smooth consistency, flavorful, good after taste. Drank it in a pint glass; I prefer to let the beer breathe a bit. Typically Mendocino has great beers; lucky for me there is a brewery that bottles and fills kegs for them 20 minutes down the road."
"Overall, very good although nothing outstanding. If you live in the east this beer is brewed in Saratoga Springs NY so it is viewed as a local brew for those of us who live in upstate NY. Despite the dark red color the flavor is close to that of a pale ale. A little more hops would have made it more interesting in my opinion. I'd be pleased to drink it again."
""
"Overall, not bad for a buck. I really like the color. The taste is not a standout but not bad."
"The first time I had any beer from Mendocino was when I went to their brewery in Saratoga. I tried many of the beers they had on tap but this one stood out from the rest. It had a good clean taste with lots of bite. Not overpowering like some Red Ales can get. They tend to get a little sweet almost like wine. This ale however had a fresh taste, clean after taste and smooth texture."

"Beer of the mont club. Pours clear reddish orange with very small white head. Aroma of cherries, malt, spice, yeast. Meh. Taste is sweet up front with some honey flavor. Cant put my finger on the flavors here. Malt extract? Not bad, I guess, but would not seek out on my own. Medium carbonation with a mediocre mouthfeel. Goes down easy enough, but won't have it again."

"Very unique and flavorful beer; sort of a hoppy red with a roasted, malty backbone and tons of yeast character. While it's something I would definitely drink again, it's not a perfect 'anytime' beer or even a special occasion brew. It's good for those times you want something just a little heavier than your standard pale ale. It does however, have that special ""wow factor"" that makes a beer noteworthy, and for that I recommend it."

"Overall nothing at all special or remarkable about this one. It's average across the board. I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"Overall - Decent, not really outstanding in any way. A solid brew maybe if you paired with specific food, but I wouldn't pick it. That's two ""award winning"" brews from this brewery that I thought were not deserving of any kind of awards."

"O- Very nice Interpretation of the style, very balanced."
"The Verdict: Not bad. A solid amber/red ale with good balance and near-perfect appearance. I wouldn’t have any problem picking up a six pack on the way home."
""
""
"I don't want to oversell it, because I'm not in love with it. It just has a classic taste. The smell is lacking, and there's an aftertaste that I'm not enjoying. The head started out nice and foamy, but fades away to just a thin lace, but with good carbonation."

"Overall - After such a tremendous start (the appearance of the golden-brown ale and the wonderful smell), I was unimpressed when I tasted it. It's dry, simple, and underwhelming. Personally, I wouldn't seek this beer out."

"Notes: Nicely drinkable with a good malt backbone and finish. Cheers."

"D/O: This beer is an icon of American craft brewing, a holdover from a time when amber ales were considered progressive. It embraces its English heritage with some acuity, demonstrated mainly in the hearty smell. It is no Ballast Point Calico amber--the beer that exemplifies this underwhelming style better than practically any other--but it retains some enduring appeal in its traditional qualities."
""
""
""
"Feel and finish toe the line as well with a biscuity feel and a lingering though subtle caramel presence. Overall more enjoyable than the cloyingly sweet beverage I seem to recall, yet a bit of a stretch for an Amber and simply called an 'Ale' on the label.."

"I am surprised by some of the low rating here. Yes, this is one of the old microbrews, but it remains a very solid amber ale."

"Okay and reasonably drinkable, but totally unremarkable, which in an increasingly crowded and competitive market looks negligent. Can't help thinking these guys were one of the first kids on the US craft block and are now being left in the dust."
"The flavor has a mild bitterness with a sharp, rough end around the finish. I get some bitter orangey hop flavors as well as an off-putting taste that I can’t quite place. It’s off… but not in the ‘bad batch’ sense. Perhaps it’s an old bottle? This beer failed to excite."
"This is a decent, if run-of-the-mill amber ale. For a time it was one of the better drafts at a local pub which isn't saying much but I've had it a few times as a result. There is a notable hop presence, nothing too pungent, and a fair balance overall, but afterward you won't remember too much of it."
""
"A very nostalgic beer for many people. Thinner body, excellent caramel malt character with a mild front-of-the-tongue hop spice to balance it out. Very floral. Would compliment a hearty steak or a day at the beach. A classic, and a staple in the American craft brewing renaissance."
""

"A nice drinking and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Pours out a slightly hazed amber color with about a finger and a half of foamy head that lasts for about a minute, leaving mediocre lacing behind on the glass. Smells like a lemon / orange peel hopping laying over a lightly toasted malt with just a hint of raisins, a really nice aroma profile. However, the flavor is a *lot* less pronounced than the nose had led me to expect, but contained exactly the same elements. A little bit on the heavier side of medium body but has adequate carbonation to move it around in the mouth. Still, it could stand to be a hair thinner in consistency."
""
""
""
"I'd like to see a smoother finish. Otherwise, pretty good."

"O: Very drinkable. Pretty middle-of-the-road for the style."
"overall = 10 years ago, this was the first Amber Ale I'd ever tried, and its the best Amber Ale I've ever had to date. The industry standard. TRY IT!"
""
""
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, poured a slightly hazy amber color. Produced a white head, very nice retention and lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this amber ale consists of pale malted grain, and citrus. It reminds me of an APA. Medium in body, this beer has a toasted malt profile, caramel, and a nice citric hop flavor- semi dry finish. Excellent session beer, well balanced- Prost!"
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a solid red ale from Mendocino. It's not the most complex or interesting beer, but it's got character. Anyone just getting into craft brews shouldn't have any trouble cutting their teeth on this one. Great session beer."

""
"definitely a solid selection if you are in the mood for an amber."
""
""

""
""
"This was a pivotal beer that got me into craft brewing, but after several years I've found better American ambers and pale ales. It's not bad by any means, and stands as a very humble beer for what it is. I think it's a great gateway beer to get people to try craft beer, but there are definitely more balanced, more presentable beers in this variety."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent amber ale that is very representative of the style's origins. Although it's not a great beer, I come back to it more than I should because it was a gateway beer for me to the craft beer world, so I have a sentimental spot in my palate for this brew. Simple, straightforward and generally enjoyable."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I waited a while before trying it and definitely would buy this one again."

"I have to say that I liked this much more than I thought I was going to."

"D - OK I guess, but kinda heavy. Bitterer than expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I wasn't a big fan of the buttery aspect in this one. This isn't really a characteristic I look for in an amber. This and the muted malt and hop characters are what brought this one down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - Reasonably flavorful and complex for the style. Other than some minor flaws such as the ill fitting metallic and astringent characters, this is a pretty legitimate beer for using as a session or a tasting. Not the most amazing beer due to the off characters, but definitely worth a try."
"The feel of this beer has a smoothness that is pleasant as it goes down. This is pretty drinkable and goes down easy with a slight aftertaste that is there just briefly."
"""Red Tail Ale"" is a red ale from Mendocino Brewing Co. in Northern California. It pours a dark golden color with light lacing. The aroma was mild... almost nonexistent, with mild hops and a faint citrus smell. The feel is pleasant and the taste is unassuming... somewhat dry with a hops finish. Not my favorite ale, and it's probably just personal preference but I prefer my ales with a bit more hops. Overall a solid brew though, and I could definitely drink a few of them."
"This beer pours a striking copper color with thin head and no lace. It's aroma is a bit citrussy with malt sweetness and caramel. The flavor is caramel with spice and root beer notes. It starts smooth leaving a mildly bitter aftertase. As it warms the caramel fades and the hop bitterness pushes through. The mouthfeel is light and dry. Mendocino Red Tail Ale is an okay beer, slightly recommended."
"Pours a murky copper amber color with a foamy off white head that had tight bubbles. The smell is mostly dried fruit with a background of sweet caramel malt. An unexpected bitterness hits you first tasting of lemony hops, there are hints of apricot and caramel with toasted malt and a grassy hop finish. It's medium bodied with low carbonation and a lingering finish. This is an enjoyable and well balanced brew, drinkable on any occasion."
"Pours to a thin bubbly head and hazy orange-red color. Aroma is sweet caramel malts and a bit of toast-and-jam with some hops in the background. Flavor is a balanced, full-flavored amber with more of a caramel and fruit flavor with a nice charge of hops to balance. Mouthfeel is medium and moderate CO2. Overall this is a solid, tasty offering. This sample was brewed in Saratoga Springs, NY."
"M: Easy start that gets complicated at the end, changing from a balanced neutral sensation to a lasting bitterness. Body is not to thick so it is found refreshing."
"Tangy, bready malt, some mellow dry bitterness and pine notes. Mild sweetness. Medium bodied, easy enough to drink, fairly simple with a tiny bit of hop character and mild malt complexity. Seems fresher on tap than when I last had a bottle (cliche I know)."
"O: Pretty good Amber ale. The taste seemed a little off, but overall, it was very good."
"O- i would give it a 5 out of 10 its bitter, sour, and just un-pleasant, maybe its just me but this is a beer i would definitely pass on in the future."
"Revisiting one of my earlier craft encounters. It pours a clear sunrise russet topped by a finger of lightly dusty cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, mandarin orange skin, light lemon rind, and a few drops of maple syrup. The taste focuses a bit more on the citrus than the sweets, but not by all that much. Other than that, things are pretty much the same. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice amber, nothing amazing, but a good everyday beer possibility."
"Pours a cheerful orange with a tight fizzy white head. The aroma is sharp and lemony, slightly sour. The flavor is lemony and tart, with a bit of peach and other stonefruit. There is a straw-like malt with a overripe floral hop flavor. The mouthfeel is prickly and crisp and the finish is slightly bitter and sour."
"F: some sweet notes, some citrics, mal flavour, hop bitterness,dry finish, long end, medium body and some crisp on tongue"
"Final thought - this is a nice ale. Nice price at $7 and a decent 6.3% ABV"
"Serving type: Bottle."
"Overall it's far from a succession ale but not very off putting a decent red ale."
"Overall: Not too much complexity in this brew, the flagship offering from Mendocino Brewing Company. If you're looking for an easy drinking amber though you could do worse."
"I've been away from this too long. I'll be buying again."
"Overall - I was hoping this would be good , full bodied beer, but didn't deliver."
"This beer pours out as a standard amberish red like most of this style. The head was a light yellow, it smelled kinda hoppy and sweet. The taste was average, it had some hoppiness and a decent malt backbone. The mouthfeel was bubbly and dry in the aftertaste. Overall is was ok."
"Lots of malt in the taste. Some sourness--in the the six-pack I bought, one bottle seemed particularly sour. Caramel flavour. Dry finnish with a touch of bitterness. Even at 6% I could see this as a nice backyard session ale."
"Overall: This ale isn't super exciting but it does satisfy my craving for a decent craft beer. A good alternative to hoppy pale ales."
"Notes: There’s not too much to say, it’s a good basic Amber Ale. Its not mind blowing but it is still a decent, enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark orange, slightly cloudy, with a thin off-white head on top. No lace left behind. The nose is really mild for the style. Some wet grains, floral tones, and honey-like sweetness. The mouth is crisp and carbonated well. Easy-drinker. At the first fews sips this beer carries a worthy amount of bitterness, but as I continue to sip, this fades. Really tame flavors as well. Caramel-like flavors, grassy notes, and a bready finish. The way this presents itself, I'd say this is more characteristic of a Pale Ale or something of the sort. An easy-drinking beer though. One I could reach for again when I'm in the mood for a no-nonsense, thirst-quenching, simple ale. And in that mood, I was today."
"T: This is gross. Funky (not in a good way) and metallic. Maybe I just got a bad bottle. This is pretty awful though. Pouring the rest."
"Wouldn't turn it down if offered to me but Ain't going to spend my money on it. Nice gateway brew. Nothing more...nothing less."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is extremely hazy and pale, dull colored. The color is a muddy copper with a half inch, tight bubbled off white head. Aroma is musty, slightly sour, and it was hard to get much more than that because all the scents were muted. Flavors are also muted, and riding a light, watery body. Toasted malt and caramelly notes briefly present. The aftertaste is musty and a little fruity, and the finish lasts too long for what it offers, which isn't much."
"* After reading some previous reviews, I cannot understand why reviewers will describe beer flavors as ""muddled"" and ""over-sweet"" and ""will avoid"" then give B and B+."
"Drinkability - This beer was alright. Not the best and far from the worst. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered, but after a couple, I would probably move on to something else. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick it up."
"D: the flavors muddle into a mess and I would probably avoid this beer again."
"Final Notes: A really good beer in its own right. That said, this is most certainly not an Amber Ale, and it really needs to be reclassified as an APA. It doesn't have the sweet, chewy caramel goodness and yeasty middle of an Amber, so as such, I have to rate this beer low."
"D: Not something I would order again, just okay example of the style which isn't one of my favorites, not too heavy in any way but not interesting enough to bring me back."
"Light amber with a subtle cloudiness, good looking tan foam cap of about an each, decent retention and lacing. Balanced nose with grain and some biscuit malt, touch of fruity hops. Tastes grainy and biscuity in the front with a bitter herbal finish that also brings some cookie and metallic notes. Medium to light body with plenty of carbonation. While this is inarguably a classic beer, it is decidedly average in today's world. If a new craft brewery made this it would be completely ignored."
"Value: Excellent for what you get."
"D - Delicious drinkability. The hops on the after taste qualms my urges for an ipa (I'm a hop head!). Sweetness is not overwhelming, the hops are light but present. Definitely drinkable."
"First off the chemical taste is the alcohol from the fermented malts. I don't know what kind they use but it sure does hit the spot. This is a great session beer. Its kinda like a calmer Eye Of The Hawk which is super strong and has more hop flavor. This beer doesn't have too much flavor its just a great beer. I wish it had more carbonation. Drink this one super cold. Super refreshing and not too bitter despite the sweet and sour aftertaste. Pick it up!"
"Bright ruby red body slightly hazed when held toward the light, fine off white cream colored head leaves behind fine speckled lacing. Aroma has caramel/raisin/hints of faint alcohol. Flavor a sweet and dry mixture of chemicals/phenolic flavors and bitter background hops wrapped around caramel flavored hops. A bit abrasive as a whole, this is not the beer I recall years ago when I tasted Red Tail Ale, things have gone in a bad direction eversince they were bought by the Kingfisher Indian mogul. Mouthfeel is cloying with earthy bitterness, body is medium bodied carbonation doesn't carry things well just an unpleasant experience. Drain pour there's too many good beers in life to settle for crap like this, honestly bad flavor and I will look for my next beer."
"Nicely drinkable for a 6% beer. Would like it to finish a bit dryer but all in all not too shabby."
"D: This can be considered to be a sessionable beer given its well-balanced taste."
"D. I would definitely refill this growler and pick up another after that."
"Poured a slightly cloudy amber with an average, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was light roasted and nutty malts, earthy hops, light to moderate earthy yeast, citrus, some other fruitiness and tea. The initial flavor was acidic and lightly sweet; while the finish was sweet, acidic and a little bitter. There was caramel, cookie, citrus, earthiness, toasted malt an little fruit and tea. The light to medium body was watery then dry with tingly carbonation and a slightly metallic, lightly astringent and dry finish."
"D: Very drinkable and well-balanced. This is a solid amber/red ale, but there are definitely better ones out there. Overall, this one lacks a bit of the flavor and complexity of other beers in the category, and it comes off a little bit thin on the tongue. Still, you could do much worse. A little bit of polish and this one could really shine."
"Great aroma on this one. The taste isn't as good the smell. It has some artificial-like flavors going on. Easy drinking though."
"D - A very nice beer with surprisingly strong flavor."
"D - There are much better examples of this style out there and it's not too hard to find them. I did buy this at a store that's known for carrying old beer...hopefully that's not the case here. I'll have to try a less suspect bottle some time in the near future to see if that's the case."
"Drinkability-This beer has a high driwnkability but is rather low on enjoyability as well. Not a normal amber as ot is too dry and thi overall it's quite forgettable."
"Super easy to drink, the balance and the way the malts hit first followed by the hops makes you want to grab another sip right away."
"This is a very drinkable beer, the low abv allows you to enjoy a few while watching your favorite sport team."
"Another Good beer from California. Red Tail pours a reddish amber color with a decent head that's just off white. There is no real notice scent to it and much like the smell is the tatse. There is a slight taste of malts but it is quite simple and makes for some very easy drinking. Great drinkability but needs a more complex taste."
"D - Extremely drinkable. The flavors could be a bit stronger, but nice complexity and balance overall. The mouthfeel is really nice and the beer overall is nice and smooth."
"Quite drinkable, but i think i prefer their stout and strong ale a bit more."
"Note: There are allot of good Amber Ales out there, but I consider this to be one of my favorites. It is extremely reliable and consistent with it's quality. Whether you are at a BBQ, a party, or just relaxing at home enjoying a couple beers, you can't go wrong with this one."
"Very drinkable, and while not really my style I think this has the makings of a nice session amber. I pretty much bought this solely because the name rang a bell, and it turned out not to be too bad of a pickup."
"D - The thinner body and low ABV make it very drinkable, but it just doesn't taste that good, so I don't really want to have that many."
"A ""medium"" ale if the moment does not call for hoppy or black and robust."
"D - Maybe I got an old one but I didn't like this one much. The smell and the flavors seem muted and stale, and the appearance is pretty dull as well. It's drinkable enough to put down a couple pints over a meal but no more because the flavors are just so bland. I might try once more to make sure it wasn't old but as for now I don't recommend it. Pass."
"d: Good drinkablility, that's about the only positive. Don't get this beer. It's more of a pale than a red."
"D - One of the best ambers I've had"
" D- The fresh crystal malt and soft diacetyl butter adds some nice depth and interest to the malt. The juicy full but not really bitter hops work great. This is very quaftable and the hops and malt work great together."
"Drank straight from the bottle the other night, nice thicker ale, pretty thick in taste as well, lots of hop taste though well blended. nice late summer afternoon beer to throw back on the porch. Not as good as alot fo the thing I've had that had come out of the brewery, but all in all it's worth a shot."
"D - A very easy to drink beer. Funny, back in the day, I thought this was a heavy beer :)"
"As for the drinkability, I could drink it all day because it is so watered down that its not going to do much other then make you drunk."
"Being open minded, I will give Mendocino at least one more chance, and see how they make ales that I am more likely to enjoy, but this one I will continue to avoid."
"I liked this beer at the very start, but things went south way too quickly, the lame-ass contract (not all, I'm not pigeon-holing here, but y'all know what I mean) skankiness a little too prevalent, a little too tight. No real hoppiness, and a sweetness without justifiable offset. Meh."
"D - Very easy on the palate, and a nice balance of flavors. I could see knocking back a few with a reasonable ABV."
"Drinkability: This beer is very drinkable, and has some nice complexities about it. Not quite great, but still an enjoyable drink."
"D: Drinkable, but not exactly a mind-blowing beer."
"D: An OK beer, I made my way through the bottle with relative ease, but not one I'll be picking up again."
"Slainte."
"Good alcohol, but not a good enough taste to be very drinkable."
"Taste is slightly sweet, cherries and orange, starts too sweet for me but the hops catch up and leave a dry, bitter finish. This is a very drinkable brew, nice consistency--not too thick or thin, a bit sweet for me but that's a subjective element. This bottle is not too far from my ""neck of the woods"" and it tastes fresh, fresh, fresh."
"drinkability for me was above average, but not excellent.. it was easy for me to drink but not incredibly easy.."
"Drinkability: This is an easy-drinking beer and one of the better amber ales I've found. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"D - Pretty good beer that I would try again sometime just to revisit this offering."
"A little disappointed with this to be honest."
"Atmosphere is pretty decent. Deep rich amber tone, but otherwise pretty non-distinct. Nose, the same. Nice, full flavor. Nothing particularly outstanding, but all-around pretty good balance of malt and hop components. Overall, this is a pretty decent quaff."
"Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith Euro Pint. Pours copper in color with a one-finger white head that quickly subsides to a minimal amount. There was no apparent lacing present. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and slight hops. The flavor was of light malt and a little bitter upon sitting in your mouth. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a smooth brew that could be consumed on a large scale and be enjoyed by the masses. However, its flavors and aroma are not enough and it could be a little more complex to make it awesome."
"D: One of the most drinkable beers I've had."
"Although this version was made in Sarasota Springs, New York, this should be considered in the same class as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and Anchor Steam as a legendary west coast recipe."
"Drinkability: I am actually surprised I got through this beer. This is the second Mendocino Brewing Company beer I have had that has been a major disappointment. It would be nice to be able to figure out whether the bottle I am drinking is just really old or if this beer really is this bad."
"Tastes like sweaty acidic malt. Mouthfeel is watery. Tastes like lagery grain and is not pleasant to drink."
"Overall this is a nice but fairly average beer. It is easy to drink, but it wasn't enjoyable enough to make me want another."
"Mouthfeel, like many Mendo beers, gets a little heavier towards the end. Drinkable session ale. A keeper."
"It could be more maltier, a bit of raw seedy bitterness."
"Poured out a pale amber into my glass. No head to speak of, and the nose was lacking, some malt notes but not much else. Taste was standard, maybe a bit bland. Mouthfeel was standard, as well. Overall, average or a bit below. Not much even to comment on, actually."
"D- easy to throw back. goes down smooth and could easily do a sixer. Flavor isnt the best but its a nice dinner beer."
"D: Mmmmno. Pretty much a uniformly bad representation of the style."
"I wouldn't buy this one again, disappointing. I expected a lot more hops to come into play but it just didn't happen."
"D- Not much in terms of flavor, but a decent, drinkable beer. Nothing that I would get again.."
"The last beer to try out of my sampler pack. Pours a light copper color with 1 finger of head that faded quickly to a ring. The aroma is all citrus hops, with loads of grapefruit and some faint pine notes and a hint of malt sweetness in the background. After a slightly water start, the middle is very crisp with nicely balanced bitterness before you really start tasting the malt on the back end. The finish is fairly fast with some lasting, mild bitterness and body is on the thin side of medium. Overall, a pretty tasty beer; my second favorite out of the sampler pack."
"Very drinkable, alcohol wasn't really noticeable until it had warmed quite a bit. I could definitely make this a go to beer. Would likely accompany lots of foods very well."
"Buy Again? No"
"I think I'd rather have a beer that tastes like nothing than have big flavor that's bad. This beer is obviously not a standout among its peers by reviews, but I wonder if I got a bad bottle, or it came from a bad batch. Of the three Mendocino beers I've had, Eye of the Hawk was mediocre at best, White Hawk was quite good and Red Tail was terrible. Pretty inconsistent. The brewery's beers aren't readily available in my area, but I probably wouldn't be buying much of them if they were."
"I try to be objective and constructive, but what gives? If Mendocino Brewing has been at this game since 1983, then they should hang it up, or supply their ales with that certain herb ubiquitous to that region. Maybe then I could enjoy this, or at least not know the difference."
"purchased at the Navy Club in Seoul Korea. Poured into a lager glass. Nice 1 inch head that dissipated in about 2 minutes. Not too carbonated. Smell is citrusy hops and caramel malt. Nice reddish brown color. Nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable red ale. I like the hops and this does hops pretty well. Unfortunately after about 6 of them my head felt a little off kilter. Still I may try again, only in lesser quantity."
"Drinkability: Overall, a decent choice, this beer is a good representative of the style, although it does remind me of more of a pale ale in my opinion."
"Drinkability: An average amber that is slightly on the hoppy side. If you love hops this might be for you. I think this could be a bit more balanced. I will pass in the future."
"Notes: This is just a mild amber ale. It is easy to drink, but low of flavor. The sweet malt reminds me of cheap european beer too, so that really detracts. If you don't like the hops that this company uses you won't like any of their beer."
"Quite a tasty and sessionable beer offering just enough flavor to keep it entertaining while a low enough abv to have a couple."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while but there are others in the style that I would choose first."
"Body is a bit light, not watery though. Good carbonation adds crispness to a dry feel and chalky finish. It's easy to drink and looks good... but man, add some flavor. Give it to your newbie friends."
"Poured into a pint glass a nice amber brown color. About 1/2 inch head with lots of carbonation and good lacing. The nose is predominately caramel malts. Tastes just like it smells, with mostly caramel on the front end and a slight hop bitterness to finish. It is light / medium body with medium carbonation . Fairly drinkable and kind of a middle of the road amber, not bad but nothing special."
"Shows an orangish-amber in the glass with a white froth, decent head retention, and decent lacing.Aromas of caramel, light grassy hops, lemon, light cocoa, subtle Chap Stick- like skunkiness, & subtle roastiness follow through on the flavor. Unfortunately, the mouthfeel is a bit lean/water with a balanced hop bitterness, and a decent finish. Overall, not a bad beer, but not a good beer."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would drink it again."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and with some alcohol warming. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is smooth. This is a good beer despite the lacking head."
"I went to a beer festival off of Lake George in upstate ny. this is my first beerfest/okcoberfest (hope i spelled right, ha). anyway this beer was the clear winner of all of them. it smells like sugar. i like sugar. the taste is equally surprising. the taste is sweet+beer and i don't know how they made it, but it's freakin good. i consider myself to be a hop head, and this beer was a groundbreaker! iow i highly recommend!"
"8/22/2012: Decided that the first time I had this there was definitively something wrong. This time it was a lot better."
"Overall, a nice beer, I enjoyed it with some Italian beef and a side of potatoes."
"Drinkabilitiy- Pretty good. Given the style, I'd like a little more hops. Sweetness takes away slightly from drinkability."
"Like my other review of an obviously ruined beer I know the beer should be better and would gladly change the score if I could find a good bottle. However, my bad bottle wasn't the only one on the site so, buyer beware."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Would definitely buy again - found it in ABQ at Trader Joes"
"The taste is very full palated malt, some very slight chicory bark flavors characteristic of a red ale, there are also some sourdough malts underneath. The malts tip the scale more than the hops. There is a bit of a drying leafy, slight spicey hop presence on the back end. This is a nice red ale, the ever so slight chicory bark is a nice touch and adds character to the beer."
"Overall a very nice and very drinkable beer but not as malty as I expect from an amber, it is missing those nice buiscut notes from munich malts. Frankly I would liken this more to some of the copper ales out there."
"D: The malt flavor is a bit overpowering. It sort of takes over this Ale."
"D - easy enough to get down because it's relatively weak. No real desire to have this again"
"T- It's a dry ale. It's malty, but not a good malt, almost a sour malt. The flavor is minimal. It's not really bad, but it's certainly not good."
"Not bad, could be more robust and full but the textures good and the taste is too. Would drink this again."
"This is another one of those original microbrews perhaps going back further than stone but not as far back as sierra nevada or sam adams. A very good amber ale with a good carbonation quality that give ""fizzy"" beer drinkers something to enjoy with enough maltiness for the rest of us."
"One of my more well-liked styles of beer... haven't been a HUGE fan of this brewery though, found a lot of their other stuff pretty mediocre but unbiased for this one. Pours a light amber color, almost golden color... small head to it.. not much for lacing.Faint caramel malt aroma to it. First impression on taste, very light bodied.. even for this style. Just not a lot of 'meat' to it.. kinda feels like too watered down and affects the taste profile of the beer (as in the beer is gone before you can taste it). Nothing offensive taste wise, a tad bit of hops and more of the caramel malt, but the mouthfeel and body are just too weak/thin to make this a great red ale. Drinkable.. but I'd have a Lagunitas Imperial Red or Ithaca Cascazilla (among many other) red ales."
"Drinkable and affordable."
" ~ I got this brew for $.49 awhile back. This is the last of the cheapos and I'm glad because I think it may have been losing its luster."
"Notes - The most flavorful beer I've ever not really like. It was just kind of middle of the road but checked all the boxes."
"This is my 4th Mendocino beer and they are all enjoyable but not meant for the faint at hear. They brew beers that you truly need to careful with and respect."
"Drinkability: Could easily kill another 32oz. pitcher of this. Much better than I remembered. A bold-flavored amber that is mighty tasty."
"Beer is low in carbonation and is nicely balanced. A couple of these is a nice treat to a weekend watching the baseball game."
"Overall impression: The metallic taste puts a bit of a damper on the fun."
"Fairly average mouthfeel, touch of hops, touch of sweetness, hard to describe, but easy to drink, decent beer that tastes good but is so subtle in taste that I don't know what to think."
"D: For me, this is a decent session beer. It goes down easily enough. A little more complexity would be nice."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - An unremarkable presentation, but was surprised by the great taste. I liked it."
"D- Balanced and substantial. True that."
"Poured into a pint glass, head quickly disappeared leaving just the body before I even had a chance to drink it. The body is an amber color, go figure, and it tastes milder than other red ale's I have had. It doesn't have that bite to it. I could probably drink two or three of these and still enjoy it. I can smell a bit of the roasted barley and leaves me with a taste of barley wine. Not bad."
"Pours reddish amber into pint glass, with white head that quickly dissipates into typical lacing. Smells sweet with malt and caramel hints. Taste is a little light, with sweet malt and grain dominating. A little watery, but nicely carbonated. Incredibly drinkable, would go well in the hot sun."
"Smell of sweet, toasted malt and fruity hops. Taste has some caramel sweetness, combined nicely with earthy and piney hops. Well balanced flavoers. I would call this medium body and moderately carbonated. The finish and mouthfeel is crisp and a bit dry. Well made, easy to drink sessional."
"Pours a murky amber with almost no head, even with a hard pour. What head there is settles to a thin swirl. Smells a bit tangy with yeast and malt, and with a very light citrusy hop profile. The taste is light, with a good deal of sweet malt and clean citrus. A tiny bit watery in the mouth, but fairly refreshing if simple."
"D: I could guzzle this on a hot day."
"Another classic case of the whole beer being more than the sum of its parts. While not much to look at, the taste is very nice and it always leaves you wanting that next sip (or gulp). A solid get-together beer."
"D: Flavorful amber ale for sure that may be a bit hoopier than most."
"Medoncino produces average beers at best in my experience. I may avoid this brewery from now on."
"D- it was pretty good, im jonesing for another but i would drink more"
"Pours an orangish colored body, with a small white colored head, pretty quickly diminishing. Has a malty fruity aroma, fizzy and effervescent. Very enticing. Has a fizzy malty nutty taste. A litte bitterness/sourness. Nice soft mouthfeel."
"Poured clear light amber with one finger head that didn't last very long. There was a little lacing in the beginning as a result of the small head. There wasn't a powerful aroma, but it did smell a bit sweet. Mouthfeel was good and very drinkable; however, it was slightly bitter... something I wasn't expecting this to have considering the malts. Nothing really jumped out at me about this ale, but it was tasty."
"overall its just decent, dont love it by any means, and wont be getting again, i cant get past that sharp bitter flavor."
"Overall, I liked it. Didn't love it, but it's a good release from Mendocino."
"Fairly light bodied with a moderate carbonation level. Overall, pretty well balanced. Not something I would indulge on but this is worth looking up again from time to time."
"Drinkability: A decent amber ale that's very middle-of-the-road in terms of flavor; it's neither overly malty or hoppy."
"4/2.5/2/3/3"
"Drinkability: I understand why this turned me onto craft beer, this is such a good introduction to any craft brewery just because it combines the best of both worlds, hops and malt, which is lacking thereof in most of these BMC brewers. This is very sessionable at 6 ABV, and it hasn't changed a wink since I've had it 6 years ago, but why should it? This will go down as one of my all time favorite brews for the pure fact that it's easy to swig yet flavorful enough to enjoy and not get bored of it. A must have beer that should be picked up as soon as you see it!"
"Red Tail Ale pours a hazy orange color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the malty side, but hops are definitely present. Caramel malt is obvious in the flavor, hops are also present but aren't as prominent. Not particularly well balanced, but it's a decent beer."
"Overall I'm not really impressed by this beer. I love Amber Ale's , but this seems like a rather poor effort. It's an OK beer, but it is lacking in hops and has too much of a yeast like taste to it."
"A pleasant amber ale. Bready biscuit with a surprising amount of hops. One of my favorite session ales."
"D. A pretty good offering from Medocino here. I can see why its a classic. Good change of pace, balanced brew in a hop-dominated genre."
"Nice brew with very little head retention but it was served on tap. The color was nice, deep, and a rich red. Smelled great - not really full bodied. I didn't care for the mouthfeel because of the dry chaulky aftertaste. Average beer but I don't think I'd have another."
"I don't normally like ""fruity-tasting"" beer but I really enjoyed this. Poured bright red with a medium off-white head. Floral aroma with strawberries and pale malt. Sweet, but not overpowering. Good balance of citrus hops, caramel malt, and the kiwi-strawberry flavor. Very smooth."
"Nikki"
"Opinion: The back-bone of the beer reminds me of a Vienna Lager with American hops and Ale yeast. I would guess that this beer is only around 30 IBU's, which makes it really drinkable for the ABV it has. The beer is clean, and you can drink them a lot faster than a lot of them. I would drink this beer again, but it doesn't stand out enough to me that I will be seeking it out."
"I could drink several of these. The drinkability was nice and this would be a very food friendly brew as well."
"Thin-bodied with very little carbonation, the drink is mild and underpowered but inoffensive. Just another unremarkable brew from a mostly unremarkable brewer. Ho hum."
"Drinkability is pretty average for me, not a bad beer but not one of the better brews out there either"
"The taste is similar, malty with a leafy-herbal-citrusy bitterness and finish with toasted crackers, caramel and general hops. It is somewhat subdued, arguably a hair on the bland side, and it's not especially exciting. However, it's still flavourful with the flavours holding up well, it's very well-balanced, solid, and it's very easy to drink - smooth though remaining interesting. It has a faintly full, warming quality from the alcohol, but this is light."
"D - The crisp taste and overall mildness makes this very drinkable, but not as much as others made by this brewery. Amber ales are just a bit too malty for me."
"It's really not a bad looking beer, but I'm a bit surprised at how mediocre it is, otherwise. Particularly, the nose is metallic, drowning out all but the smallest whisper of hops. The beer could be a deeper red but I thought that it formed a nice head. The taste wasn't bad but pretty boring. There is some malt, a little bit of hops and none of it is strong or interesting enough. The mouthfeel is fairly watery with too little carbonation and a bitter aftertaste. Despite the beer's faults, it's fairly drinkable. The numbing metallic taste is starting to make an argument for me to further lower the score, so I'll end it there. I would accept one for free on the chance that I've got a bad batch. Subtract the metallic flavor and my scores would go up some."
"D: Average drinkability, ok at first but wouldn't be to enthused about drinking this in multiples."
"i recall liking my first red tail a few months back,then not being too impressed by the second. hopefully this one is a reliable impression so i at least know what i think of it."
"Pours a nice semi cloudy deep amber color with large frothy off white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is sweet malt with light hay and dough. The flavor has wonderful balance between the sweet malt and citrus hops which is true to he style. Medium body, thick and chewy texture. Finishes medium and again leaning toward the malt."
"Mouthfeel is watery and clean. Not a lot of body or flavor, especially for 6% abv. Drinkability isn't bad but it's not enticing. Mediocre."
"I had two in a row, and that's about it. A pleasant brew for sure. Glad I found it."
"Well carbonated and substantial, with a nice finish. A perfect session ale."
"Overall, I was disappointed w/ Red Tail Ale. It's a decent bang for the buck, and I may have been a bit harsh (I used to love the stuff), but I think the recipe should be tweaked (fat chance they'll do that, given its place as their flagship ale). However, I remember having it last fall at about 7 months old and I loved it--seemed like the fermentable sugars from the caramel malt that added to my dislike of the taste, 'feel, & drink' were acted upon/converted. I'll have to give it another shot to be sure about my opinion."
"Drinkability- Average."
"Drinkability: A better than average red ale, but not my favorite of this style. I could have a couple very easily, but I would have liked a little more hop flavor to balance out the malt flavor."
"Pours a clear sunsent gold with a one finger off-white soapy head that quickly falls to a thin layer of bubbles. Some thin lacing is left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell consists of corn, hay, and grains. Some caramel sweetness and honey as well, not the most enjoyable aroma. Taste begins with white bread, sugar, and toasted grains. Caramel malts and a touch of piney hops midway. Aftertaste consists of straw, corn, and butter. Give me more hops!! Just not a very pleasant tasting beer. Light to medium body with a slick and syrupy feel. Carbonation is pretty low and takes away from the experience. I just couldn't get into this beer at all, I'll pass."
"Being that my dad is a falconer, we have this beer around all the time it seems like, I have had this several times and finally decided to review it, not great in my opinion but he buys it for other reasons than that obviously, saw this in Hawaii surprisingly too, will drink again not by choice, might be worth trying"
"clear orange with a bronzish tint and a decent cap of somewhat creamy dirty cream. Some sweet fruit and caramel with mostly a toasted, grainy, base and some earthy bitterness. Decently feeling medium body with a modestly creamy carb. Like their lager I found this offering to be one with some favorable attributes, but mostly unimpressive."
"Sampled out of the bottle and also in a glass. Pours a medium amber color with a dirty copper tint. There is minimal head and moderate lacing. Average amount of aroma that is nice with characteristics of sweet malt, fruity overtones, and a faint hint of hops. Adequate mouthfeel for an ale, somewhat filling, rather smooth with an easy finish. The flavor is considerably better than average. The malt characteristics are easily tasted, and there are some sweet flavors that also stand out, caramel perhaps. A nice hearty hop finish rounds out an overall pleasant and enjoyable ale. This one is decent."
"D - Pretty boring and bland. Why is this over $8 a sixer? Its easy drinking, but I can think of a lot of easy drinking beers with more flavor than this."
"I've had a few of these over the last few weeks before deciding to review the beer. Out of the bottle into a Sam Adams pub glass in makes a moderate size head, which recedes to a thin white rim of head leaving little to no lacing. I like the clear copper appearance of the beer. The smell is nice with both malt and hops making their appearance. When I first had this beer some weeks ago, I wasn't that impressed, but the beer grew on me as I slowly worked my way through the six pack I bought for $7 at the local Trader Joe's. I has a more pronounced malt character than say Sierra Nevada. Also, it has a pine character to the hops, while other pale ales (Sierra Nevada, etc.) have a stronger citrus based bitterness. I'm assuming Mendocino is using a different variety(s) of hop than simply Cascade. The finish lingers pleasantly bitter. Good beer. I'll probable buy some more sometime."
"D - Good example of a American Red Ale, but nothing special."
"The body is light to moderate. The off notes of this beer makes it difficult to deal with. Overall very limited."
"Pours a nice, normal off red color, with great head and a bit of lacing. It has a nice malty scent, but very weak, almost nothing there, it was hard to pick out anything. Good taste, but not great, a nice malty red ale, with a nice balanced aftertaste, but not much else. It does go down very smooth. Not bad in the mixed pack, but I won't buy it by itself."
"D= Great, easy drinking red ale. Could be a strong contender for my favorite warm weather refresher. This one will definitely make its way into my summer plans!"
"A rather pricey beer, and not too spectacular either. It's decent, but I've had plenty of Amber Ales that are much better (and affordable)."
"Clear orange brown body with a thin white head that evaporates into a small smear... more malty than hoppy; a bit like a brown ale, and yet fruity? Easy drinking, slightly effervescent... body is medium to full, slightly crunchy but pleasant... despite the malty aroma, the flavor is hoppy to the tongue with a balanced malt finish--a surprise in its roundness.. not overwhelming, but as a six-packer, this could be quite enjoyable--probably solid with grill fair or snacks."
"Notes: Not the worst I have had by a long run,but too dry & bitter for my taste. Does not seem well balanced. I do not think I will buy this again,yet it seemed worth trying. The flavors of the brew are not bad- just dry."
"Took from Moan and Dove's grand menu of bottles. Poured with a dark red appearance, no head or lacing though. Its sugarish malts were a little too artificial smelling to my palate. However, its taste faired better with its great balance of hops and malts. The drink was a bit thin but still maintained a medium body. Overall, nothing spectacular."
"M/D - Crisp and smooth. Very drinkable ale."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, copper-orange color with a thin, stable head. Smell is of caramel and nutty malts and a touch fruity. The taste is similar to the nose; prominantly malty, only enough hops to balance, a lingering malt aftertaste. There seems to be a staleness about the bottle (which doesn't seem to have a freshness date). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy carbonation. Drinkability is OK, a decent beer but nothing I will seek out in the future."
"This beer pours a clear pale amber color. The head is a half an inch in height, an recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of caramel, with a hint of grapefruit. The taste is nicely balanced with a lingering bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with a watery texture, and a little too much carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice tasting beer, but its other aspects detract too much for it to be fully enjoyable. I suppose I could drink this again, but I would go out of my way to do so."
"Taste is slight hops, a bland taste with nothing to really write about..what is it? A mix of things gone wrong. I did not even swallow. AVOID!"
"Despite Killians being one of the first beers I could enjoy, I'm not that big a fan of red ales. They're a lot like regular ales, but instead of having more hops or malt, they have a more bland flavor added in that makes them ""red"". Regardless, I still don't mind having one here and there. This one in particular was smooth, mild, and clean. Mendocino makes good beers no matter that the style, and this was no different."
"I would not call this a session beer as the dryness requires sipping and savoring to enjoy. Several of these could be a lot of work but the one I am drinking is very enjoyable."
"D- Again, the finest example of an Amber ale I have had the privilege of drinking. It's surprising others have not liked it more. Ambers are not the best style in the world, but this is the one to drink if you want to try one."
"D: It's drinkable - I wish it's taste was a bit better. I found it to not fit what I enjoy, but others might like it."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink. I like this as an amber ale, the hop characteristics balance well and at 6% it is definitely something I could sit and enjoy a few of."
"Nice appearance and delightful smell, but was not happy with the taste. The taste was shocking in a bad way to say the least. I drank this beer on multiple occasions and was always left with a very bitter, not very appealing, aftertaste. Personally it was hard to drink more than one or two due to aftertaste. However, friends seemed to disagree and enjoyed the taste but eventually agreed on the strange aftertaste."
"Poured a light red/orange with a one finger head that left a thick ring almost right away with some decent lacing. There was some great carbonation with bubbles flying upward. Smelled of straw with hints of sweet malt and a little hop presence. Tasted a little dry with some spiciness. There were some caramel notes and a good dry hop finish. The mouthfeel was a little thin and is whats expected for the style. The drinkability was good for the style. A good session beer but nothing too impressive."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: First off the beer finishes semi-dry. Moderately low carbonation levels seem to work for this beer. Body is on the lighter side of something that's almost medium. It is easy to drink and goes down real easy, however, this isn't one that I'd be looking for in the future. Nothing special here."
"12/27/07. Aroma of spicy hops with some spiciness and malt notes apparent as well. Amber/orange. Slightly hazy. Off-white head with decent retention and lacing. Malt in forefront with medium crystal malt caramel flavors and some juicy melanoidin notes in the background. Well-balanced by a spicy hop flavor and moderate hop bitterness. Medium-bodied with good carbonation level."
"Amber ales are a bore to me and this beer helps in my generalization... pours with an average head, and the lacing is pretty good actually ... smell is just plain jane stuff, as is the taste- some bitterness but it seems a bit jumbled... for the price not 2 bad but falls quite short of a repeat... cement is only sand that sets.."
"This beer goes down very smoothly while eating a meal. I paired up this beer with some hickory flavored chicken and also a plate of fajitas and I was very satisfied. Definetly buying a six pack soon."
"D - I could suck these down, but they are fairly plain. A good drinking beer, wish the alcohol was a little lower, 4.5% would be good."
"I had not heard of this before I had it at my girlfriend's. Decent brew. Pretty amber color with a nice off-white head with decent retention and some lacing. Aroma was faint and pretty non-descript. Watery-thin texture. Nothing special. Went well with dinner."
"This is a good , standard, solid amber with no adjuncts. I'd buy again."
"Ingredients: Bottle calls out Pale and Caramel malted barley."
"Drinkability is very good, nicly balanced, crisp and on the sweeter side, a true classic for the style."
""
"Pours a slightly hazed amber with a light tan head. If the haze weren't there, I'd probably go up .5 more on the appearance. Very mild nose. Very slight touches of hops and citrus, but not really much to speak of (and this was off a somewhat aggressive pour). Flavor is strong with a metallic edge off the start. Almost makes me go: ""Eck."" Once you get past that there are sweet tones with hop influence. But overall...way too much metallic edge. After a while, I feel like I left a penny in my mouth too long. Feel is actually pretty decent. It might be the highlight of the whole experience. Strong carbonation and a thicker feel on the fluid. But overall it doesn't do much to save the drinkability. Not really worth trying, or in my case, trying again."
"Pours a slightly hazy, pale red with hints of gold, and an off-white head that lingers to mid-glass and leaves little lacing. Aroma is muted, but what is there is hoppy and fruity, mostly apples and grapes. Mouthfeel is farily bland, but the flavor picks up the hoppy fruit theme and adds a touvh of malty sweetness, all leading to a well rounded finish."
"I never pick this one up, but have many times in the past... I will buy again but more when I want an APA. Doesn't strike me as an amber.. more as a APA... pretty good across the board."
"I had this as a single, don't think I would recommend or try again. It wasn't horrible, I guess I expect more out of a ""craft beer."""
"Pretty drinkable. A little too bitter for the style, but it's forgivable as it's a tasty beer on its own. There are some other kinds I'd rather have in this style, but I'd get it in a pinch for sure. Worth noting: The 5.99 sixer is real easy on the wallet, as the other examples I mentioned usually run about 8.99 or so."
"This is an average brew, balanced and all around good. It would be a nice brew with dinner, a great football beer, and a perfectly good choice to order on a date (you know when you want to impress the ladies with a cunning knowledge of American brewmanship)."
"Feels wet and creamy. Thick like an English ale. Smoothens out as it warms up. Overall, not bad. Bitter but with a flowery sweet base. A very mild red ale."
"D- I could drink a few of these in a session. But honestly, I probably wouldn't. I bought this beer in a put it together 6-pack and I like it just fine, but will not seek it out."
"Mouth happiness: More than happy to except a lifetime supply"
"Final thoughts  Very smooth, clean and refreshing. Great session beer."
"Solid choice for those wanting a NorCal beer that isn't overly hoppy yet dark & flavorful enough for those with a discerning beer palate."
"D - Pretty good, I wish I had more than just the single bottle. Overall a pretty impressive brew and one of the better amber ales I've tried. Recommended."
"Strong mouthfeel owes much to crisp, but not overdone, carbonation. The American amber has come to be a style that I have little to no interest in but this is an above average entrant in said category. If you need an amber fix, this seems like it would do the trick."
"A decent, however somewhat forgettable red ale. I may be biased because I am a bigger fan of amber ales, but I had a bit higher hopes for this one. A solid brew and well worth the try, but this will not be high on the list in the future. Color poured a red/orangeish color. Decent drinkability but could not see myself making a session out of this one. Trader Joes may be a good spot to pick this up, defnitley cheaper than I have seen other places. Would drink again, however, would not go out of my way to get ahold of this one."
"D - Tastes good could drink a couple of these while watching football on a Sunday afternoon."
"Drinkability: Quality drink. I would get this again."
"Taste is pure malt, some roasted barley, a nice sweet undertone that isn't overwhelming. Goes great with pizza ... and Cal victories over Oregon. Will look for in the future."
"It is crisp and pretty clean. Smooth. A decent choice for an easy ""session"" ale."
"The Red Tail pours a light amber color with little carbonation and a head that disappears rapidly. It smells malty and the taste is mostly a roasted malt flavor with a little bit of hopiness to even it out. The mouthfeel for me was mostly on the tongue and overall a decent brew."
"Overall: Not a strong brew, the mouthfeel is pretty weak in general, the smell is lacking, and the taste is decent at best."
"The beer has an amber/orangish color to it with little head and poor retention. The smell is clean with caramel and dextrin. It has a decent taste to it, your typical sweet malt and raw hop flavor, but I wasn't really impressed by this offering."
"Notes: I'm a very happy man since Mendocino started brewing in Saratoga Springs, NY. Great news for the east coast."
"a hazy copper color with a one finger off white head and some lacing. aromas of slightly caramel malt with some herbel spice. taste is of caramel malt, bready, dry, well hopped. mouthfeel is light, crisp, no after taste. very nice beer, another good session beer. i will buy it again."
"Not a bad beer, and not a terrible representation of the style, either. Poured up about the same colour as watered down tea; a bit of an orange/red colour with a nice, soapy, egg shell coloured head. Smell was mostly sweet malt, but had some detectable hop hiding in the backgroud, as well. Nice. Taste was sweet malts up front, bitter hops in the middle, and then dry roasted cereal on the finish. Mouthfeel was a little too thick, I felt. not quite what I'd call syrupy, but certainly too heavy for the style. Not bad. I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't pay for it."
"D: Quite drinkable despite the alcohol content because of its smoothness."
"Easy to drink, a decent amber with a bit more hops and substance than most."
"Red Tail Ale is a good ale and most will agree that it is crisp and offers some decent hop character. But it didn't quite meet my high expectations and thus I consider this only an average ale overall."
"Drinks okay, this is shadow of what it was 10 years ago, where's the malt & hop guts??? Would do in a pinch"
"D - Really very average / middle of the road, although that may be the style."
"I'd call this a solid session brew, save for the fact that it goes above the 5% cutoff point! Speaking of, this is not a beer I'd expect to be 6%. Could sneak up on you if you're not careful!"
"A slightly above average red ale with some sort of character."
"Back in the day, under the original owners in California this was considered to be a real flagship beer not just for the brewery but for craft beer in general. Sadly, that is far from the case now. Can't be sure if the beer is dumbed down or our expectations and tastes are raised, but drinking this calls up the phrase ""what happened ?"". Disappointing and not something I'd pick up outside of a variety pack anymore."
"The flavor begins with a dark malts, but the hops soon overwhelms it, and I'm rapidly trying to decide how this is different from a big pale ale! (Oh yeah; the color!) It finishes with a creamy mouthfeel and a biscuity texture."
"Color is clear amber-yellow, decent head. Aroma is decidedly malty with strong citrus hints and a whisper of hops. Flavor has nice balance of maltiness and hoppiness, fairly but not unpleasantly bitter, just a touch of orange. A refreshing and jazzy ale, a good party brew or companion to a meal."
"Enjoyable brew. Id definitely do you again."
"Interesting stuff when you think about it, but its not something I can drink copious amounts of before wanting to move along..."
"Not a bad amber ale, nothing mindblowing either. Give it a shot if you haven't. This is the second brew I have tried from Mendocino, and they taste very promising. I will definitely try more of their brews."
"This beer has a nice roasty malty smell to it. The bottle I got came from NY, so I'm guessing Medocino has two breweries. It appears to be a nice amber colored beer with white lacing. It has a medium body, and a lasting bittering hoppy aftertaste. I don't taste the flavor hops as much, but the malt bill apparently takes care of that, since it tastes complex. Nice overall American Ale."
"12 ouncer, no freshness/bottleing info offered....pours dull slightly reddish amber, light tan head, minor retention and spotty bits of lacing left behind. Moderate malt/bready nose. Balanced malt/hop approach, nothing too exciting going on here, dull style, dull beer, easy drinking but why bother?"
"Alcohol is noticeable, slips in behind the hops but seems to get knocked out by the sweet malt-husk fullness. Good drinking ale, got it on a whim with no prior info and no freshness date, this was an excellent choice."
"Buy six of these and six redhook's and compare."
"had never tried the red tail before and as I perused the usual offerings at the local retailer it just sort of caught my eye. from mendocino. o.k., they should know something about brew. found the ale quite interesting. the biscuit and hop thing jumped out at me first. plenty of fruitiness as well. nice head, beautiful body color. smooth. very drinkable. I grabbed these after a session on the skeet field and they were just the ticket. I would drink this brew again. deeelicious."
"Pours a dark golden amber color with a small fizzy off white head. The nose is mostly toasted and biscuity malt with some caramel and a faint whiff of hops. The taste is dominated by a delicious malt backbone with a nice hop finish. This brew is balanced nicely and highly drinkable. Overall, this is one I wouldn't mind having again."
"This beer had a fairly malty taste but a fairly distinguishable bitterness lurking in the background from the hops, and also a little bit of a leafy hop flavor as well. A good mouthfeel and easy taste makes this pretty drinkable though."
"D - All in all, a pretty drinkable beer, but not the best representation of the style. Not sure of the ABV (website doesn't list it, either), but I could put away a few of these in a sitting."
"Easy drinking ale could drink quite a few of these really enjoyable. Worth a try."
"I am a little confused by the unfavorable reviews, because I found this a very tasty and clear beer. It's a simple taste, and I could kick back a couple with no problem. A sure recommend for anyone looking for a refreshing beer."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear amber , with a decent white head - nose of sweet roasted malts , mild hopps , solvent , and sour milk  taste of sweet malts , caramel , cereal , and mildly hoppy- body sharp , and mildly carbonated  aftertaste of sweet malts , and sligh chalk (dry)"
"Drinkability: definite session beer. Again freshness is the key. Very pleasurable for the tastebuds."
"Drinkability: could have a couple of these, seems to go right to my head though."
"Verdict: not a bad beer, but not much of note though either. Seemed pretty standard (average) for the style. Not sure if I would buy more, but would sure drink one bought for me."
"Poured copper with a persistent off-white head. Caramel and estery aroma. Taste is sweet caramel malt nicely balanced with hoppyness and a mouth-puckering sourness that I personaly find very appealing, although others might not feel the same. A nicely balanced and very drinkable ale."
"D: Certainly an all beer occasion beer"
"Poured a hazy amber with a decent head. Smell was a muted hops, with definate hints of grain and even a slight caramel. Taste was a bit thin, but had a definate sugary touch to it. Hoppy dry finish with a tiny pine bite. Very drinkable. Overall this was a decent beer, I could see this being served in large numbers as it is very smooth and very drinkable, would love to try it on tap."
"D - This is a very good amber beer. It has a delicous sweet taste."
"Overall, I found it a very good beer. I wish I had a couple more bottles to enjoy. I'll definitely keep my eye out for it in my area."
"Will I revisit this brew?y"
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from a Mendocino mixed case at Kunda Bev. and poured into a pint glass. A solid amount of head that was nice and fluffy with smallish bubbles. There again was a bunch of sticky lace. The color was a beautiful dark amber. The smell left much to be desired, there wasn't much of one at all. What my nose did pick up, was pleasent though. The taste was wonderful. It was blended wonderfully. There were excelent hop undertones. The taste was unbleaviably smooth. An awsome brew. Don't drink and review."
"Pours honey color. Thin white head, with decent lacing. Smell is sweet, and malty. Light to medium bodied, with a creamy feel. Taste is of honey, and butterscotch up front, with some hops in the finish. Not as sweet as it smells, this is a beer worth trying."
"D - I am impressed with this one. It is drinkable, refreshing and enjoyable. I might have it again some time."
"After this beer, I bought a special caramel brew just for comparison, and could barely notice a difference. A good beer all and all though."
"I am tasting a very pale red ale here. Not the best by far."
"D: I could definitely put this one into my rotation of NFL game-day beers. It has some really good flavors in it, it's not too filling or too light, and it's strong enough for me to notice, but not so strong that I couldn't drink three or four in a sitting."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and medium bodied, and drinkability is extremely good! I could quaff a few of these no problem."
"tastes so good, how will you know when to stop?"
"drinkability: i dont have to say any more about why this is tough to drink"
"Medium body and perfect carbonation make this tasty ale an all too easy too drink APA. Moderate ABV (label states 6.1%) and it is noticable, but not over powering. Another one of Mendocino's tasty Ales...cheers!"
"Drinkability: The hops impede the drinkability a little, but its still a refreshing beer."
"Very thin and watery. Not much substance at all, in the taste or on the palate. Wouldn't recommend anyone tries this, you won't be missing much of anything at all."
"Overall a nice average beer. Nothing to go hunting for in aroma or flavor. Nothing to make it stick out in its style, however it is a good, everyday ale from the style. I would enjoy this as a nice alternative when drinking with friends at a cookout."
"D - Good as well. This is a session beer. Easy drinking and not overly complex."
"I bought a six pack of this because I hadn't seen it before and--I admit it--it was the cheapest on the wall of craft beer. You get what you pay for. It was badly conceived and executed. The malt character was just funky. It didn't have the crisp, drinkable character of a typical amber, which is what I was looking for, since I bought it for drinking at my shorehouse. Now there are five bottles left. Want one?"
"This is a good brew, yet no one thing really stands out. It's redeeming quality is it's balance, and overall it's crisp, refreshing, and highly drinkable."
"This beer was not quite what I expected. Much more tart, but I didn't necessarily find it a bad thing, just unexpected."
"Overall this is a great beer to sit and watch a movie with or to have on a nite with company and cards."
"D: I wouldn't want more than one or two. I might buy it again, but not anytime soon."
"Pours out to a beautiful golden amber with a small head that fades away quickly. The smell is nice with a bit of malt and hops. The taste is rather malty and hoppy, with a nice amount of both in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is also rather good, with just that right amount of carbonation and a decent amount of thickness. This is one of the most drinkable beers I have ever had, and I will buy some more next time."
"12 ounce bottle. Mendocino Red Tail Ale pours out an amber color with a small head that quickly fades away. Malty aroma with some floral notes. Toasted malt flavor. Some ale fruitiness. This beer has a sharp bitting flavor and an off-putting astringency. There's not much hop flavor. Other than a dry finish, this beer does not taste particularly good. Carbonation is a high. The mouthfeel is a little thin. This beer is all around average."
"Poured a deep red-orange amber color, contrasted nicely by off-white head. Nice aroma, fruity and malty, makes you draw a deep full breath. First sip granted a bit of bitterness and slight carbonation burn when rolling on tongue, but melts away as malt kicks in. Leaves mouth feeling crisp and clean. Great everyday drinker, especially on a cool spring evening."
"The mouthfeel is very good because of the balance. The beer is very drinkable and doesn't last long in my reefer."
"Pours a medium copperish-amber with a slight red tinge. The head is small, off-white, creamy and quickly diminishes to a thin film. Some weak lacing that slowly fades back down to the film as you go. The smell is moderately sweet up front, mostly caramel, with some floral hops supporting it. The taste shows more malt dominance, caramel and dark whole wheat bread, with some light citrus showing up from the supporting hops. Something buttery in there too. The finish is medium-short in duration, bitter and floral. It has a medium body, bitter, slightly astringent texture and moderate carbonation. Not a bad amber but nothing special. Fairly basic but done nicely, and I was glad to have tried it."
"Very nice"
"A very average rendition of an American Amber. Directionally challenged in its balance. Poured to a deep amber colour with no lacing and retention. Smell is its saving merit as carmel malts and sweet fruitiness were readily apparent to the nose. Initially left a slight dry film in the mouth that quickly dissipated after further consumption. Would like to become more knowledgeable in this beer style catagory before partaking of another Red Tail Ale in the future."
"Unbalanced; just not a pleasant tasting ale IMO. The astringent-perfume flavor and texture becomes annoying."
"(Music: ""Djelika", Toumani Diabate, Keletigui Diabate, & Basekou Kouyate)"
"Gave one a try after purchasing a 12 pack of mixed brews from Mendocino. The brew poured to a reddish, copper color with a small off white head that had some retention and left lacing at the top of the glass. The aroma is nice but basic. Malt aromas seem to be the most prevalent with a slight hop smell. The taste is good, very smooth brew. Has a sweet flavor to it that seems to be from the slight caramel malt flavor. Also can notice some hop taste but seems just to be there to balance out the beer and is welcome. Over all I would not classify this as a great brew but is solid. Would be an excellent session brew and a good gateway brew for Macro drinkers."
"12 oz bottle with no freshnes date visible. Pours a medium amber orange with a 1 1/2 finger head, good longevity and equally good lace. No huge aromas but light caramel malt presence with slightly floral hop notes. Sweet caramel flavors up front, not big malts though, follower by a spicy hop flavor and lingering bitterness. Closer to an APA than a amber as it is heavy on the hop side. A decent beer but nothing over the top. Good session beer."
"Drinkability: This isn't my favorite red ale, but it is quite drinkable."
"D: easy to put down but not interesting enough for me to want another."
"This poured a nice orange amber color with an off white thin head that lasts nicely. The smell is fruity, floral, and hoppy with a touch of alcohol. Hint of metal skunk? The taste is nice, hoppy but the malts come through and dominate and the end of a taste. A good balance but either i am missing something or it is just mediocre. The weird metal taste is kinda odd. Maybe i got an old bottle. Fairly drinkable, I just need to try another one soon. Smooth mouthfeel. I will revisit."
"Pours flat, with little to no head, light, cloudy orange in color. Very hoppy, orange flavors...reminds of Blue Moon. Carmel and malts very apparent as well. Overall a solid beer especially for the price (around $1.50 a bottle). I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a lighter flavor"
"Poured from a bottle. Copper to orange in color, a decent head but dissipates quickly without much lace. Aroma is malty, weak citrus hops. Hops are pronouced more in the taste than the smell, and taste is balanced nicely with toasty malt. This is a crisp ale, well carbonated and dry hoppiness. This is a real session beer for me. I find this a good standby."
"D - OK drinkability. Not near as flavorful as I expected."
"Overall- not a good 1! The worst Mendocino has to offer so far. Avoid. Tasted like an old Killians Red."
"Yep, get it if you can."
"Overall I liked this brew. For 6% it seems the alcohol could be more laid back or hidden. This will get me to drink other offerings from this brewer as it is well crafted just needs some refining in my opinion."
"Overall one of my favorite ""everyday"" ambers. This isn't exactly a ""special occasion"" beer - it's not all that complex or overwhelming, but damn is it full of flavor! Hit the spot!"
"Slightly out of balance with the flavor timing way off. A bit too sweet for my tastes overall. I wouldn't buy it again when there is many other beers out there."
"Poured a red body, with an off white head, ok lacing and retention. This is a clean, crisp and light bodied beer. Overall, some nice citrusy hops, malt, caramel, and a bit of bitterness. Finishes dry and grainy. OK red ale, but not my favourite style."
"Pours a cloudy amber color, nice carbonation, not much of a head though. A little bit of lacing afterwards. Scents of malt, hops, barley, and a nice little bit of sweetness. Very nice taste for an amber. Medium body, nice little bite at the end, with a dry finish. I could drink a few of these, would make a nice session beer."
"Transluscent amber with a tiny white head. Smell is sweet; nutty malt; hops; sweet alcohol; some raspberry. Taste starts hoppy, ends sweet, with complexity in between. Warming really brings out the complexity. Wait for warmth. I find floral hops, bitter hops, lemon, nutty malt, sweet berries. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth. Medium body. Enjoyable."
"The aroma is semi-sweet and hints of caramel. The flavor is dry and slightly hoppy, and very good. There is a good balance of malt and hops with a slight orange taste followed by some good hop flavor in the aftertaste. I also detect some caramel flavors too. Overall, a very good ale."
"The taste is an improvement from the nose. Plenty sweet and caramel with a light herbal hop in the finish. I think maybe a bit of DMS, though not a terribly bad amount. Finishes quite dry."
"poured a pale reddish amber color with attractive head that fel to a ring that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is of some roasted malt with hnit of hoppiness. Taste is initiallly austerely dry, but some malt begins to show through. Finishes very dry, but not overly enjoyable. Ok beer, but not great."
"Still, even if it is a bit unbalanced, it's still more than drinkable. Worth a try."
"What's really nice about this as opposed to many of the left coast ambers is that (thankfully!) it isn't heavy on the citrus hops! Oof and oof!"
"Drinkability: Is this an IPA? No? Drinks like one."
"Drinkablity: really refreshing. Paired very well with my Mexican."
"My dad brought me this back from California. I didn't have the heart to tell him that they sell this at the grocery store five blocks from my house. The beer is a pretty, cloudy reddish-amber color. Doesn't smell like much. Tastes hoppier than a lot of red/amber ales I've had. Pretty dull."
"I have tried a number of American Ambers lately to find the good ones. This is what I think about Red Tail. Looks Light copper with some pink highlights thrown in. Bubbly head fell to 1/4"" and stood. Aromas are toasty, malty, caramelly, and mildly citrusy. Taste is sweet and toasty. Toffee, caramel, and syrup are dominant sweetnesses. Slightly cut by spices and citrus that are hop driven. Quite distinct hop flavor or bittering. Body is medium - full. Flavors are balanced toward the hops, pushing into Amerian Pale Ale perameters. Perhaps a bit disjointed in it's character, but a good beer nonetheless."
"This was very enjoyable, but not overwhelming. Could easily session these. A nice ale discovery."
"Nothing outstanding here. Very much like Alaska Brewing's Alaskan Amber, which I don't like either. Pours a deep mahogany, with little head. Smell is of hops and malt. Tastes like Heinz ketchup and little alcohol. Very carbonated, so doesn't even make a decent session brew. I'll take a pass on this one..."
"To me, this is how a red ale should taste. While this is not an outstanding beer, it is quite good and is indeed the standard I would measure other red ales against. Meaning, since this is how I expect a red ale to taste, it's rating is either better or worse than this. This beer, however, is still nice and smooth and is something that I would gladly drink all night."
"Medium in body with a bubbly smooth mouthfeel."
"The malts give this one a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A must try."
"Overall Impression: Wow, a full powered Red here. The overall flavor is a bit sweet and Im starting to tire of it about halfway through. Drinkability takes a hit for the heft and sweetness, but this is a pretty good tasting beer. Strongly recommended for any Foghorn fans, recommended for all others"
"Hazy amber color with a decent sized head. Smells like roasted grains, sweet malts and a mild hop spiciness. Meduim bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Has a light syrupy mouthfeel at first. Sweet and roasted malts dominate the flavor at first. The maltiness is balanced out nicely with a bitter spicy hop. Finishes slighty dry and hoppy. Drinkablity is almost perfect! I must say I am impressed. A very tasty and balanced amber ale!"
"Drinkability: With the exception of the unusual finish, a pretty tasty beer"
"light carbonation and medium body. overall a pretty easy drinking beer save for the weird aftertaste issues.still possibly the best mendocino i've tried so far."
"12 oz., bottle conditioned, served chilled in a nonic. Pours a dark orange/amber with a slight haze and an off white, 1 finger head that leaves a nice blanket of foam throughout. The aroma is very biscuity and nutty with perhaps a hint of butter. The hops are citric/piney and fairly bitter but they are balanced well by the biscuity/toasted malts. There is a yeast flavor in the background along with a trace of alcohol. A very tasty and warming amber ale."
"Average."
"This is a pretty lame excuse for a red ale. Really timid in every aspect. At first there's a big bubbly head but I think that's from too much carbonation, bubbles all through the beer. A weak red tint shows through the drab amber color, but it's really not that interesting to look at. Smell is kind of dirty and metalic, as is the taste. Seems like there's dust in the beer or something foreign. Really kind of macro-ish. Thin and overcarbonated mouthfeel, I really don't even feel like drinking many of these. I shouldn't have bough t a whole twelve pack but I guess it was on sale. Probably won't be getting stuff from this company again."
"Medium bodied, good drinkability, it's a nice well balanced beer."
"Nice dark red/brown color, with a fluffy off-white head. Smell was very malty with a lot of sweetness, biscuit tones. This may have been an old sample, as there was diacetyl all over the place. Still, a very strong malty presence to it, some carmel and slightly roasted flavors. Aside from that slight off-flavo, this was a very solid and drinkable amber ale."
"Was not impressed by the carbonation. Early fizz gave way to watery feel in the mouth."
"Bottle. tatsted just like their others, mandarin and sticky malts, tinny and short, not so good. I don't ramble on about nothing in my ratings often, but this time i have to because i was so bored with this beer and their other beers, really really sorry, this beer was not for me."
"Drinkability and Overall: The worst of Mendocino's I've had yet. The Amber Ale is a very hard style to do without tasting just like any other beer. And this one fails to pull through. Skip this one, unless you love the style."
"Pours an amber color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves some lacing behind on the glass. The aroma has a nice hop profile with an equally nice malt profile. Slight spiciness. The flavor starts out with a strong caramel malt character then fades to hops and finishes bitter. Moderate body and mouthfeel and the drinkability is good. Solid beer here."
"Fairly average session bitter. More aroma hops would go a long way to making this a tastier beer."
"Very, very drinkable even at 6%. If I prefer something heavier I go with Mendocino's Eye of the Hawk."
"Not a bad beer, but more of a pale ale than an amber."
"This was on tap at Bison County. It came a deep clear copper color, with a light head and just a hint of lace. It had a hop aroma with hints of grapefruit, and malt on the back of the aroma. Malt dominates the flavor, with just a mild hop bite. The citrus character shows up in the taste. Good sweetness and a nice balanced mouth feel. I had been sipping a Red Seal earlier in the day, and these beers are very similar. This beer just felt a thinner. Still, a good amber."
"Drinkability- A six pack of this will do the trick on football sunday. Would probably go go with some chedder slices and crackers too. Heck, it worked with my jalepeno poppers last night. Good brew, will buy again."
"First offering I have had from Mendocino (only this, Blue Heron, and Black Hawk Stout were available). Very enjoyable, I will definitely purchase this again."
"Quite easy to drink but is a pretty average beer. Nothing wrong, but nothing exciting. It's like eating Grandma's homecooking; it's not gourmet, but it'll do."
"Pours an off golden amber color, opaque. Head is a little too light, though it is lacy and clings to the glass. Smell is light and hoppy, as expected. Taste is sweet, with good carbonation, and hops being prominent on the aftertaste. Good mouthfeel and quite drinkable. An amber beer of note."
"the red tail is a fantastic session beer. full body, yet light enough to enjoy many throughout an evening. i don't even notice the 6% alc. content (a little high for a session beer). good hop flavors, nice malt (slightly toasty) finish. also try (for more enjoyable offerings from mendocino county) the mix case with the ipa. yet none seem to quite impress me the way the red tail does."
"Pours dark amber with a very generous head that lingers for awhile. Not much to the smell, just smells like a generic beer you crack open. Nothing else to note on that. It was a bit hoppier than I had expected it to be. Taste is rather bitter along with malt. The bottle says the 'perfect balance' between the two, but I beg to differ. Mouthfeel is good, the brew is solid and consistent. However, the bitterness lingers after each taste, leaving you with the need to munch on something to counteract it on your tongue. All in all, wasn't too impressed."
"Overall, I'd rate Red Tail as ""good"" but far from ""outstanding"" There are a number of other local amber ales that are more successful at the style but this is still a very nice brew. If I were to show up at a party to discover they -only- had Red Tail to drink, I'd be far from disappointed."
"Poured from a 12 oz long neck brown bottle. It's a light hazed amber that becomes a deep ruddy gold hue when held up to the light. Intense carbonation, which results in a thick and creamy layer of foam for a head that is retained pretty well all the way down the glass, with some sticky lacing. Chewy caramel malts and floral citrusy hops on the nose, it's somewhat faint but a nice blend. Sweet malt upon first sip, some grains, with citrus making an appearance in the middle, and mild floral/piney hop finish. Sticky, oily hop aftertaste. Yet this red ale has an absolutely amazing full, creamy mouthfeel, wholly unexpected for this style, which leaves me duly impressed, it is a textural pleasure to drink this ale, a damn palatal masterpiece, worth the price alone. If this was available to me locally I would definitely pick up more, a very user-friendly and highly drinkable red ale that holds its own."
"A simple and light beer. Simple isnt always bad and I found it rather flavorfulenjoyable even. Would like to try a couple pints of this on draught."
"This is only my second Mendocino brew, but I'm not impressed so far. They strike me as a middle-of-the-road brewery at best. Given the almost total lack of malt support, body, and especially, flavor, Red Tail Ale has to be classified as a disappointment. As Gertrude Stein once said about Oakland, ""there's no *there* there""."
"Pours a nice orange-golden color with a decent-sized white head that hangs around for a while. Aroma of roasted malt, a touch of hops, and light astringency. Nice, sturdy mouthfeel holds a more assertive palate than most American ambers. Rich, roasted caramel malt is balanced well by a slightly bitter hop profile. Finishes fairly dry. For the style, I have to say I like this one."
"This is a nice amber from mendocino. Pours a golden/orange hue with hints of red. The head is and off white that forms into an impressive size then settles down into the glass. Lacing is minimal at best. Smell is of strong syrupy malts with a slight citrus hop tone. Hints of lemon and honey as well. The taste is very sweet, the sweet caramel malts really play well with a nice meal. The hops are there but not out of this world, a good amber. Medium bodied and refreshing, very drikable, went great with steak."
"Last swigs: Everybody I introduce this beer to loves it. This was my buddy's number one choice at Mendocino Brewery's tasting room. Overall, tangy malts and slight hops in the finish."
"This is new to BC liqour stores and I for one are glad to welcome this nice beer to our fair province. This beer pours amber gold with a nice head. What really grabbed my attention was the nice malty flavour that dominated the hops. Most Westcoast Ambers are hopcentric beers that often taste like PaleAles but this one has a malty finish that makes it stand up to many food items. A session beer but one with good complexity. I look forward to more encounters with my new American friend."
"This is one solid beer and infinitely drinkable."
"Session beer....big time!"
"Pours an almost perfect amber color with a thin creamy head and collar. Quite clear, no haze at all. Aroma of citric oranges and lemons, grain, slight biscuit, minerals, and floral undertones. Flavor follows in line with the aroma. Grains and minerals up front, slight orange and caramel malt linger, finishes with a dry bitter hop twang. This beer is fine for everyday consumption as it is very drinkable, but there are others of this style that I would partake of first. Overall, the malt and hops mesh well together making it a rather quaffable beer, just don't expect to find the holy grail of amber ales."
"Drinkability for me was average. I am more of a dark beer drinker, so while I can have two or three of these I'd rather something else."
"Nice flavor and good drinkability combine to make this a good choice to have in the refrigerator. Most everyone I know will drink this stuff."
"Another ""go-to"" beer. Pours a pinkish copper with a feeble head. Smell is sharply bitter and minerally with a hint of sweetness. The taste is immediately grapefruity before mild caramel notes emerge. The flavor component of the minerally nose is present here and hearkens to sweet water right out of the mountainside. The finish is dry, crisp and just bitter enough. Mouthfeel is about average for the style. Drinkability is tops and this brew is guaranteed to be refreshing every time."
"It's not complex, and in this case the simplicity is a plus. For the most part the elements interplay evenly and render up a well-flavored balance. The malt sweetness and hoppy presence meld rather than duel, delivering a bit more than the look and aroma might seem to bode. These basics lend to a good drinkability. The downside of the simplicity is that nothing really stands out. It has identity, but that identity is not especially distinguishable from so many others. Still, put one in my hand and I'll drink it gladly."
"Very drinkable. This is another local brew and a favorite. Lots of times this is the best thing on tap when I eat out."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear, red/orange amber with an ivory head that is minimal and short lived but fades into patches of sheety lacing. Aroma is a pleasant meld of fruity and piney hops and pale and caramel malt graininess. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Taste is slightly sweet with caramel and apples, but plenty of citrus, pine, and grassy hops keep it well balanced. Finishes crisp and slightly dry, with a polite note of hop bitterness. Very nice red ale, that I hope to sample again."
"Pours a clear copper with a persistent finger-thick white head. Aroma is a mixture of caramel and some grassy herbs with a light metallic hint. Flavor begins with caramel and some earthy hop bitterness in the finish. Body is medium with medium to high carbonation. Very simple, but not a bad session beer. Very reminiscent of many traditional English Pale Ales."
"This poured a light copper with a frothy white head that lingered and laced down the glass. I really liked the taste of this brew. Clean and crisp but it had just enough fruit hints to keep me interested. I really nice, clean Ale and very drinkable as well."
"The finish is dry and bitter. The body is medium."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thin lace head. The aroma is slightly malty. It is mild, but the scent of roasted malts is there. The taste is good. It is dry and clean with a bit of flavoring hops. There is a definate malty flavor that is not too overpowering. It's actually pretty decent. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking red ale."
"Charb"
"A nice amber-gold color topped with a thin, lacy white head. A noticeable hop aroma, but not overpowering. It has a nicely balanced flavor. Maltiness is noticeable, but there is enough good hop biterness to offset it. It has a surprisingly full mouthfeel. As a testament to its drinkability, I am already reaching for my second bottle."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a copper, lightly hazy, color (it is bottle conditioned). No head when I carefully poured the beer into my glass, yet it displays a tan head when roused. A hoppy aroma with light citrus notes is accompanied by a subdued malt aroma that is just perceptible as well. This beer is nicely hoppy at first, it then leads to a thin body, which I don't remember from prior sampling of this beer. As it warms up the hops start to kick in and bury the thin-bodied sensation. This beer has a definite American hop character in it, there is a bit of citrus character and it is pretty bitter. This one really needs to be had on the warm side of things, otherwise the character is lost and it tastes too thin. There is a hint of diacetyl in this brew that helps to pick up the body and adds to the complexity of this fairly straight forward beer."
"Pours a medium copper with a sticky off-white head. Smells of fruity malts, a touch of skunkiness, and some standard pale-aleish hops. Taste starts with hefty sweet malts with some fruitiness and a little caramel, balanced nicely with grapefruit hops. Appetizingly bitter, oily finish. Not great, but would make a nice session beer, especially if you are a birder, falconist, or just plain raptor poacher."
"Plus...it's red! ;-)"
"Deep reddish-coper color, decent white head that sticks to the glass, light sweet roasty nutty-caramel aroma. Some roasted malty nutty flavors, light to medium body, light and smooth mouthfeel, a bit watery leaves a somewhat sweet aftertaste, very average."
"Medium gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is malty, fruity and sweet. Medium bodied amber ale. Malts are fruity and sweet. Mildly hopped. Slight spiciness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, malt sweetness very evident"
"Poured an eerie pale orange color. It had a big foamy head that exploded easily, falling into a bubbling foamy mess leaving many bits of stain; the head sustained with quite a crown from the fair carbonation underneath. Smell was mostly fruity and slightly floral fragrant hop scent, but often soapy hop scents, and roasted malt notes that at times were invitingly sweet though typically masked. Taste was crisp and clean, with oily and grainy citric hop notes. Malt was a bit slow to come up and fleeting at best, but helped create the moderate body of the brew. Surprisingly short finish though quite biting with salty hop strokes, fairly drying in concurrence with the many acrid sides of hops being shown through out this beer. Had a number of much better ambers out there."
"Notes: I rather enjoyed this; a solid, respectable session red."
"Nice likght amber glow with excellent creamy head. The aroma is light and mildly spicy. Nice touch of fruitiness. The malt plays a very low part of the flavor and the hops aren't as big of a part of the flavor as I was expecting from a west coast ale. Fairly crisp and a good beer, but not something that's going to excite you."
"Would make a good candidate for a session brew."
"Pours a lighter copper color with medium head that leaves some slight lacing,a strong smell to it some fruitiness to it and very malty kind of a weird smell hard to place.The taste starts out a little sweet but there is some dryness in the middle ending with a malty finish and aftertaste.Not a bad beer but seems a little rough around the edges."
"I found this to be a well-crafted brew; nicely balanced. Easy to knock back if the 6.1%ABV doesn't slow you down"
"Average looking appearance.Nice looking color that is an amber to orange.More hops than I would have expected for an amber ale.Leaves a long bitter and dry finish.Scattered white lacing circles my glass.Medium body with a good share of malt.Too much bitterness for an amber ale.Its not as refreshing as I would like it to be.Although it is more complex than the usual amber/red ale.It has more of a pale ale taste.Could use more crispness on the mouthfeel.Less bittering hops would balance it right out."
"This beer pours nice with a thick head that quickly diminishes into a light ring of foam around the edge of the surface leaving the beer lightly carbonated. Its a light amber color with a slight hop aroma. The taste is light and crisp with little bitterness at first, but as the after taste kicks in there is a little shot of hops. Overall a pretty decent standard ale thats good when you want to drink more than just one."
"I had not had this beer since becoming an advocate, I had also forgotten how good it is. it poured a nice lightish amber, head was thin but retained very well and laced the glass moderately. Slight aroma of mostly fruity overtones. Very smooth malty, fruity, and slightly hopped taste. Very English in character and drinkability as well. A winner and I regret ignoring it for so long."
"This beer poured out a hazy golden orange color with a big white and rocky head. There's a yeasty malt sweetness in the aroma, with some floral and fruity hop tones. Detected some orange flavors in the taste. Medium bodied with a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste. Nicely crafted, tasty and drinkable."
"Aroma of sweet malt with a nice zesty kick to it. Copper in color with a light tan head that is fairly persistent. Grain and diacetyl flavor with a moderate bitterness in the back of the tongue. I found to be a fair bit astringent which detracted a bit from the beer."
"Pours a hazy orange amber with a thick, pillowy head that displays excellent retention. A strong malty aroma is accented by fruity apple notes and a nice peppery hop spiciness. A very pleasing nose. The inital taste reveals a very harsh bitteness, followed by a slightly chalky note. A bit of a citrus note pops in briefly before the bitter finish. The aftertaste is again chalky, with a lingering bitterness and some grapefuit notes. Mouthfeel is slightly astringent, with that clinging, dusty feeling on your teeth once you swallow. Drinkability is poor, due to the biting bitterness and funky aftertaste. A 'bitter' disappointment."
"Pours out a hazy amber with a big white head. A nice smooth amber ale. Tasty malts and perfectly balanced hops make this a choice brew to drink. A great finish makes the next sip even better. I'm looking forward towards scoring more Mendocino in the future."
"I like this brewery's Blue Heron offering a lot, but Red Tail doesn't quite measure up. Not bad, but not their best."
"Pours a light, cloudy orange with a thin patchy head. Smell of faint citrus and hops is noticed, but I struggled to detect them. As noted on the bottle, the pale and caramel barley malts are tasted, this one finishes slightly hoppy, and quite dry. Just a note of alcohol is also noticed towards the end. Average, not something I'd seek out again."
"This one pours a golden color with a hint of redness. The head is weak and thin - very short lived. The initial flavor is hops. The hops are well blended and balanced. there is a malt flavor that is lacking the sweetness that is more typical of malts. The flavors are nicely balanced and very enjoyable. This is a good beer."
"This is actually one of the better American style Pale Ales I have had..its not really an red ale etc."
"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Nothing really exciting about this beer. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a thin off-white head. Aroma is malty but it is barely detectable. Flavor is somewhat malty with a light hops counterbalance. Finish was lacking any real substance. Not a bad beer, but nothing really stands out about it either."
"This beer holds its own but isn't my favorite from Mendocino. The head is thin but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is mostly malt. I enjoy the smell better than the taste. The taste is a little weak and doesn't have a lot of body. At times it seems more like a lager then a pale ale. The basic direction of this beer is lost. If it is a pale ale, then what about the other pale ale they brew? The beer is good but not what I expect from an ale. Lots of malt and a bizarre yeast strain that doesn't seem to fit the style."
"It is now brewed in Ukiah, CA but the original brewpub is in Hopland, CA. With a home town by that name it has to be good. The brewpub is great, welcoming to tourists but with a hometown following. One of the regulars even has his own chair at the bar, complete with a plaque. If you are ever cruising up the 101, drop by, you will not be disappointed."
"Pours a clear light-tea color with a 1-½ finger slightly off-white head. The smell is a light roasted malt aroma with light hops in the background. Again the taste reveals roasted malts and light hops (perhaps too light IMO). It has a light-bodied mouthfeel and finishes barely on the dry-side. A very basic amber that is not very enticing. Cheers!"
"Hazy, dirty amber shade; off-white head, moderate size, minimal lace. Orange zest, nuttiness, malt, citrusy-hops construct the nose. Respectable flavor, cameral malts rule, nutty, surprisingly acidic and hoppy nice finish. Medium body; silky smooth because of the mild carbonation. Far from outstanding, it would work well as a session beer. Try one."
"This is one auspicious looking beer. With a delicate poor, this nebulous orangish light brown colored beer with a thin white head and mild carbonation is pleasing to the senses. A congenial sweet smell of nector and a gratifying first sip, signify a sencond and third taste are undoubtfully near. Drink up and enjoy, for there are five more tails within your reach.............Make that 4."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a thin white head that immediately fades into a thin lace. Nose is fruity with notes of fresh citrus and some floral hops. Taste is a combination of sweet lightly toasted malts and juicy ripe orange. Oily and bitter hops follow the initial taste and leave an acidic and off-dry finish. Very crisp and refreshing. I really enjoyed this ale and will buy more again soon."
"On the pour a nice copper color with the head presumptuous in volume, light tan in color and the texture frothy, upon the decomposition of said head the lace forms a thick sheet to secure the glass. Malt dominated nose, malt sweet, light floral tones also present, and the start sweet with nice malt profile, the top middling. Finish has perky acidity with the hops pleasantly spicy, the aftertaste dry, long lasting and a nice Session beer."
"Red Tail Ale:  Brown long neck bottle.  Reddish hue and creamy white head, with nice Belgian lace.  Aromatic, with strong hints of apples. Initial taste gives way to a prominent hop flavor, with some hoppy oils that last a fairly long time.  This is a damn fine beer."
"Some soap type of taste is mixed in with the palate and throws a monkey wrench into the mix."
"Smoothy, hoppy and very dry, but I missed much of the malt."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a spectacular off-white cloudtop head with excellent retention, and quite good lace, mild carbonation.  The head lasts to the bottom of the glass.  The aroma consists of malts, hops, and bread.  Taste begins with caramel maltiness, hops then assert themselves towards the middle, finishes with a dry crispness and bitter citrus flavors.  A decent and solid amber ale."
"Decently hopped with a slightly toasty back. Finishes citrus rind and clean but lacks body and has only a whisper of malt for balance. I found myself rather uninterested in the six I bought and it took awhile to finish. A cut-hair above thoroughly average."
"Nice pour, head is a consistent 1/4 inch of medium bubbles. Murky amber color. A little hoppiness and ""wet canvas"" to the smell. Not well balanced, hops are tangy and somewhat explosive. Some creaminess to the malts that adds body. If I have a major criticism, its in the lack of complexity of the malt sweetness, and way too much vinegary funk going on, piling on with the hops. Drank a second one directly from the bottle and it was extremely sour in this presentation. I'd like to try it on tap to see if there are a number of bottle runs that are not well-done..."
"Good drinking here, real easy to go down and with the usual trademark APA characteristics."
"Sweet malt nose with some dry hop presence.  hazy red color with a nice lasting 1/4 inch white head.  White lace on the glass.  Initial toasted malt flavor  with a smooth mouth.  The finish has a hint of cardboard (oxidation?).  Overall except for the touch at the finish a solid beer."
"Overall, a pretty good amber, and distinctive from the rest of the pack.  Flavors were not as well integrated as I would hope, and the alcohol element at the end was heavy handed."
"This beer was easy to rate for me, it's not bad but then again it doesn't really make you want to buy a case of it.  As you can see how I rated it its a very aveerage beer all the way around, not bad not great.................CHEERS"
"193"
"After about a minute, the head dissapates almost completely leaving just enough to leave a sparse pattern down the glass.  Slightly hazy light orange hue.  The citrusy but mild hop nose is accompanied by very pleasant caramel and nutty malt notes.  Light to medium in body, with a smooth mouthfeel.  There's a nice balance of flavors all around in this brew.  The hop bitterness sufficiently balances the malt sweetness.  Malt flavor, although certainly not assertive, is comprised of a caramelized sweetness contributed by the crystal malt.  There's nothing offensive about this brew at at all.  It's simple, well balanced and is thus very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"I've given this beer one too many chances.  Every time I buy it, it tastes bad.  But it's supposed to be good.  Must be old.  Buy it again.  Tastes bad again...  You get my drift.  It has this sour taste to it that I just can't shake."
"A nice, crisp beer but not as good as Eye of the Hawk."
"Notes: Damn, this is one fine ale. Very well balanced, extremely drinkable and suprisingly warming. Makes me wonder what the abv is as my head heats up and my belly warms. It costs nearly $9 a 6-pak in Cambridge, MA ... but man is it worth it. Another fine ale from Mendocino Brewing Co. Buy some now."
