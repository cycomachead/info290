This is a good food pairing, yard work and shower beer. As it stands, I would have liked either a little more malt or a little more bitterness, but it does its job nonetheless as a standard, basic amber ale.

Nose of rich caramel malts, spicy hops, and figs.  Flavors are delightful for the style, sweet malt up front with hoppy bitterness to the rear.  Flavors of fig and as it warms vanilla become pronounced and vying for pole position over the hops.  A great session ale with a lingering bittering hops aftertaste.  Very sessionable.  Worthy.","Brutaltruth","Nov 09, 2014"

I was paying $5.50 a glass at a local craft brewery for a beer that is similar, but not as good. Hopefully, when America's fascination/fad with session IPA's wain and those overly hopped, citrus maximus beers are no longer it, great beer such as Lagunitus Censored will get it's chance to shine.","Copper_Is_Thy_Beer","Oct 28, 2014"

Taste same as aroma. Palate is medium body, good carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. Finished with a flavorful caramel malt taste and some nice pine floral hops for balance. Aroma and Taste slowly intensify as it warms up. Overall a very good and nicely balanced brew.","Samp01","Sep 23, 2014"

3.78,1.6,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"one of the better amber types in the game, this one is clear reddish in color with a frothing and lasting off white head over an inch tall. it has a pleasant nose of tangy hops over a robust copper malt body. much less sweet than other American takes on the style, which lends to increased drinkability for my palate. not over hopped, but certainly aggressively done, which makes this sort of a style hybrid between the more conventional amber ale and the new red ipa types. not quite on the ipa level, this one finishes much more balanced, with the rich caramel malty flavors sticking around on the palate for a little while after the swallow. the mouthfeel to me is the best feature, full bodied but drinkably dry, creamy and expansive, and well enough carbonated. not a reinvention of the genre by any stretch, but a clever Americanization of a style that probably needs a facelift more often than not. well done beer from lagunitas here.","StonedTrippin","Aug 12, 2014"

3.3,-11.3,3.75,3.75,3,3.25,3.25,"Mid to dark brown with a rather frothy head of two fingers that sticks around for a while and laces nicely. Rather malty smell with a mix of caramel and brown malts maybe a bit sweet smelling. Hop aroma is somewhat muted with only a touch of floral hoppiness coming through. The malts are there in the taste as well as the base of this beer is a solid maltiness, but it is not sweet. This is quickly followed by bitterness that comes through without much hop flavor with just a weird almost astringent bitterness, I'm not that thrilled honestly. This beer is relatively light with a good amount of carbonation the finish is dry with the strange bitterness. Overall I cant give this very much in the way of praise I did expect much better from this one given what I've heard about it from others.","fank2788","0"

The smell was very hoppy with a lot of floral notes to it. The taste was even better though, because even though the beginning had a lot of hop flavor, the middle and end were much more balanced and created a nice smooth beer. Very refreshing with earthy tones in the end leaving a clean finish. Would definitely pick up another six of this.","WhiteHillsStore","Jun 07, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy/cloudy orange copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malts; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice amber ale. All around good balance of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 30, 2014"

3.86,3.8,3.5,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Lagunitas' take on the amber/red ale style pours a rusty red to brownish color, a little hazy and with ample carbonation to start. My initial pour yield nearly an entire glass of off-white to light tan foam that quickly settled down. Nice lacing as per most Lagunitas beers I've had. Aroma was malt forward and fruity ... Caramel creme, biscuits, sultanas, some grass and lemon. One of the more complex and nuanced red ales I've had, plumb this one for different flavors although the complexity does not detract from the drinkability. You can dissect this beer or you can just knock a few back and be content either way. Ginger snap cookies, graham crackers, and dry biscuits, red grapes, orange and lime hop flavors, powdered sugar, some other sort of fruity but floral note (plums? almonds?) ... All reveal themselves but no one flavor overpowers or dominates. Some light brown sugar character is the backbone, with a semi-dry finish of unripe pears, hop bitterness, and metal that might be a little coarse. Alcohol blooms as you go and this is high ABV for the style, a nice touch. Quite a lot of diacetyl character but this is a positive for me, with hopping like a pale ale and a nice balance between mainstream appeal and nuance for someone who wants to go slow.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 01, 2013"

Lagunitas has dialed back the hops a bit with a much maltier profile that exudes caramel, toffee, and rum. There are the signature hops on the back end to leave you with a slightly bitter finish, because this is Lagunitas after all. I am having trouble finding a bad Lagunitas beer and each new offering I try keeps leaving me impressed.","brurevu","Nov 11, 2013"

In any case, I find this beer to be one of the very best I've had in the past year. The hops compliment, rather than overpower, all the great malt complexity of this beer. Send more!

I think my favorite part about this beer besides the balance where you don’t even taste the almost-seven percent alcohol is the foam that floats atop the beer the entire time that you drink it. If you like Lagunitas Brewery for their intensely hoppy beers, God bless you, but give this a shot for a change because it’s an awesome beer to hang out with.","RummyRedbeard","May 23, 2013"

This beer is the complete opposite of my presuppositions. It's extremely malty and has pretty much very little hop flavor to balance it out. This isn't a bad thing, however, as the maltiness lends an amazing complexity to this moderate ABV beer. I would buy this again on a brisk, cool late fall or early spring day.","TTAmod","0"

Rich aromas of caramel dominate, with just a touch of grain and fruity hops noticeable. Caramel and bready flavors open on the palate and are met with a moderate level of spicy and fruit hop bitterness on the finish. A higher level of carbonation, and a medium body round out the mouthfeel of this crisp finishing beer. Joking or not, these guys make GREAT beers!","phishsihq","Mar 08, 2013"

4.27,14.8,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"This is one of my favourite go-to, chill beers. It goes down pretty easy and isn't too ""in your face"". I've split a few with some friends who never drink anything funky, and they quite liked it too. It pours a nice copper colour with some notable hop nose, but you definitely pick up a sweet malt. Low head due to the alcohol, but nice lacing throughout. I actually find it to be one of the most pleasant-smelling beers around and I think if someone made a scented candle that smelled like this one, I'd light it and have a nice relaxing bath with a glass of this in hand. This pairs really well with pub food and is a good, higher gravity beer that should get any parted started. The alcohol is slightly warming and very pleasing.","zachloveshisbeer","Jan 08, 2013"

I don't understand what marketing niche passing a simple IPA off as a ""rich copper ale"" fulfills.

3.78,1.6,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, what we found to be the best thing about this beer was the rich aroma and beautiful look. The nose was very complex, and we kept coming back to words like “thick” and “rich” when trying to describe it. The flavoring is a little light, as the fruit and sugars ease up too much around the edges, dropping the robustness and balance. This, however, is a classic West Coast red, and reminds us quite a bit of Red Seal out of North Coast, but a tad sweeter.","TheBrewo","Aug 05, 2012"

The choice for carbonation seems very smart, it accentuate a spiciness while acting as a balancing agent to smooth out all the flavors. Lagunitas makes damn good beer. A number of them seem to be slight variations on a certain style but Censored shows off some different tricks that I definitely wasn't expecting.","bat6","Mar 09, 2012"

4.05,8.9,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall this beer turned out to be a pretty damn good Amber Ale. With most Lagunitas beers, I find that they have a pretty dominating hop profile, but with this beer they turned down the hops and let the malts take the lead, and I think that worked pretty well and made for a more balanced Amber Ale and it let the great malt base of this beer shine through and not be overpowered. This beer had pretty good drinkability. the bottle went down faster then I thought it would and if I had another bottle I would drink it. What I like most about this beer was the flavor and the balance, it had a good malt base, and for a change Lagunitas didn't throw a shit load of hops into the brew so it lets those great malt flavors shine through with just enough hops to keep things balanced, the mouthfeel was right were it should be and was also pretty good. There wasn't anything that that I really didn't like about this beer, but a maybe a slight bit more of hop flavor would make this beer perfect. I would buy this beer again, it is a good example of a balanced Amber Ale and I also recommend it to Amber Ales fans, it's a must try for the style. I really liked how Lagunitas restrained themselves on the hops, they already have a hoppy Red Ale, so it's nice that they added a balanced Amber Ale to their lineup. This beer doesn't beat out Bell's Amber Ale as my favorite Amber Ale, but it comes pretty close. Lagunitas continually makes great beers and this one is no different, I'm down to try any beer from them that I can get my hands on.","StoutHunter","Oct 30, 2011"

It pours with a thin, flat, smooth off-white head that settles rather quickly into sparse film. Aromas are mostly sweet, with characteristics of caramel and toffee blending together. The flavors are overly sweet, with a heavy caramel backbone that rides through into the aftertaste. Other flavors are a slight nut sweetness, some citrusy highlights, and a toasted note, as well. Great body, which is light and crisp, yet leaving a great lacing on the glass while you drink. As said before, the aftertaste is mostly caramel malt sweetness, and the finish is quick and clean, with a slight slickness to it at the end of the palate. Decent beer.

The color is about what an amber should be - amber, but it does have hints of that copper color too it. Overall I would be pretty pleased with this appearance if it wasn't so see through, it just makes it seem like there wont be much too it. This smells like pure grain to me, I mean there is a difference between a grain smell and a malty smell, this smells just like grain that you haven't even brewed yet. It's obviously a lighter grain, but it is for sure grain. Yeah, I mean it just smells like grain, and also it smells super super sweet. Those smells dominate, there isn't any room for anything else here. Some people might like that totally grain smell, but I don't, it smells gross to me, that's not what 99% of beers smell and taste like, so I don't think it should be considered good. This is especially offensive in this beer because it's an amber ale....ok, amber ales are supposed to be hoppy with a little bit of malts, this beer does not smell hoppy at all, and instead of malts you get pure grain, something is wrong here. We will see how it tastes, but I don't have high hopes. GROSS! GROSS beer, wow, what the heck!?!?! First of all, there are almost no hops here, what is up with that!?!?! It's an amber ale!!! Secondly, you get that huge grain flavor that I'm not a fan of, it's not as intense as I picked up on the smell, but still, way too noticeable. I mean other than that it just tastes completely boring. Boring boring boring, and an unwanted grain taste. It's only redeeming factor is the mouthfeel which is good, and it's appearance.

Taste is hoppy with a hint of grainy malts that give a pleasing earth tone. In the middle you can taste a hint of dark fruits that balance out the bitterness from that hops, while leaving a biscuity dry finish. Mouthfeel is syrup like to me with little carbonation. There is plenty of volume but I would have liked a little more carbonation to lighten in up a bit. Still a very drinkable beer. I can see myself going back to this one and checking it out again.

Aromas a predominantly toffee, with hints of dark fruits, perhaps raisins. The flavors and feel are nothing short of terrific. Very complex, medium-full bodied, almost chewy feel. A lot of sweeter notes, like toffee and caramel, that don't descend into the cloying range due a dull background haze of hops that are hard to describe. Maybe they're earthy, maybe they're more tea-like...it's hard to say because they only whisper through the powerful maltiness.

Lots of carbonation and a rich, creamy head. Tiny amounts of lacing. Aroma is very faint and shows some pineapple, vanilla and hint of piney hoppiness. Flavor is very rich - they were dead on that - showing excellent balance between the hop bitterness and maltiness. Very full mouthfeel and very flavorful, though not super complex: hops and malt and yeast. Good beer, but not elite. Alwasy well-priced, too, so worth keeping a sixer around all times in your beer fridge.","SolomonGrundy","Aug 24, 2010"

Taste is also really malt forward. Toasty and roasty without being heavy, cereal flavors backed up by slighty hoppy bitter finish. Could have some more hops in there, even for the style. Beer has a nice round full mouthfeel without being cloying or heavy. Not my favorite style but its pretty drinkable.","pmlondrigan","Aug 22, 2010"
3.7,-0.5,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Lagunitas Censored is the exact opposite end of the spectrum its other red ale, Lucky 13. In this beer, the caramel malts are the focus with the hops taking a back seat. The deep copper color was topped with a off-white that clings and sticks around til the end. The aroma was dominated by the sweet, rich caramel with a little of oxidized sherry and fig. The taste was similar with a lot of chewy toasted malt and a hint of citrusy hops. The beer was full bodied with thick complex malts. The sweetness for me makes this a beer that is difficult to drink more than bottle of. I think that a blend of Lucky 13 and Censored would be a really good amber ale that complements each other and better than the sum of the parts.","Soonami","Aug 16, 2010"

First clue this wasn't a typical west coaster was no fruity-piney smell. Tasted very malty and balanced. Really got going as it warmed up, the malt shined.

It is fantastic the way it is, great mouthfeel, just fills every tastebuds with sweet, hoppy goodness, heavy for the style and while very crisp, it isn't dry or over carbonated.

Caramel malts set the stage, creating a sweet flavor that coats the tastebuds and acts as a nice foundation for the hops.

If I were forced to explain further I may say carmel and prunes. Well, no surprise, but it tastes just like this style of beer should. Sweet malt with some hoppy bitterness to offset the sweetness quite nicely. Perfect carbonation and nice texture. Not too heavy. Easy to drink. Very slight bitter aftertaste.

In the nose the hops come through clearly bringing grassy, herbal notes in front of pine, lemon peel, pink grapefruit pith, honey glaze, spring flowers, no really overt malt presence although smoothly textured. Full-bodied, steadily expansive across the palate without becoming leaden. Here caramel and butterscotch supplement the honey to sweeten the pot. More pie dough and pancake mix as well. Never toasty nor roasty, and on the hop side there's the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus and diminished herbaceousness.

It just gets maltier and sweeter as it warms up. Overall, a good beer. I was shocked to find that it was 5.9% on ABV, because the alcohol is not at all present. I'd have again if it were available.

The nose is surprisingly fruity. Tangy tangerine and sweet orangey citrus unite with sweet caramel and lightly toasted malt aromas. A drop of vanilla and floral hops help to meld the fruit and grains together. Medium in body with a smooth and creamy texture. Tangerine returns in the taste along with sweetly toasted caramel malts. Fresh, orangey citrus rounds out the edges while a bit of bitter rind comes through with toasted malts in the finish. Throw in a dash of earthly black pepper spiciness and you've got yourself the kronic. I didn't really know what to expect from this brew, but it really impressed me.

There is a peppery presence that remains throughout, keeps it lively to the last. There is a yeasty quality, dry tartness that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the malt/hops combination.

The smell is very good and you'll detect nice piney notes in the hops, some toasted malts, maybe some fruits in the fig/apricot/raisin family. The smell is better than the taste. The hops became a bit more bitter than I would have liked and the malts were more than toasted, rather burnt and too caramely for my liking. The aftertaste was a bit bitter and it lingered too long on the tongue. The mouthfeel was a bit creamy and this was accentuated a bit by the moderate carbonation in the beer, so this aspect gets a slightly better grade.

4.08,9.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Very nice pour- reddish amber with a quickly dissipating off white head. Crisp aromas flowed form the pint glass- earthy hops, and slightly caramelized malty goodness. Taste was amazing- clean flavor, excellent piney hops pair perfectly wth the slightly roasted malts which have a sweetness that is balanced and refreshing. This would be a great sessioner, it goes down very easy. The mouthfeel has a chewiness to it but it is not overly malted and heavy and has no off flavors to speak of. There is hardly anything negative to say; im glad that an american style can hold its own against old school heavyweights.","kernalklink","Sep 02, 2007"

All-in-all I didn't find this beer to be extremely flavorful though, although it wasn't bad. There is some style mismatch here, but this beer reminded me quite a bit of a Leinenkugel's Red with a significantly softer mouthfeel. Pretty good.","BeerBelcher","Aug 26, 2007"

Taste gives a trace of toffee, plenty of caramel sweetness that lingers, accompanied by just about the right amount of hops. Medium body and soft, yet higher carbonation. The numbers in my review do not fully match my opinion of this beer. Taste is higher than 4, but not quite a 4.5. This is one that I think I may be picking up more regularly.

It poured out a rich golden-amber color with a thin frothy white-tan head. The smell was sweet with some hints of caramel malts, but not at all strong.

Feel is solid, good carbonation and a nice bite on the tongue too.

3.75,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Caught it at the Vortex while visiting Atlanta. Fares well as a hightly hopped Amber. Could be a Pale Ale. Richly malted, but not highly kilned. Flavors and textures lean toward biscuit-ey, rather than toasty. The hops wash out the conservative matlitness a bit and lend a mild metalic flavor. The feel could hold a bit more weight, but the attenuation seemed to keep the beer lighter feeling, but heavier in alcohols. A solid brew for the summer, but still cannot compare to their Imperial Red.","BEERchitect","Jun 03, 2007"

The aromas and the taste were both well balanced between a rich, slightly toasted caramel malt and a blend of floral, spicy, and earthy hops -- a nice accomplishment. The malts end up winning out, with brown sugar dominant in the finish, but the hops keep creeping back with different flavors throughout the drinking of this beer.

Aromas of plenty of hops with some bready background notes are really pleasant, a nice start. In the mouth a nice pillowy smooth mouthfeel almost like a nitro pour. Flavors are incredibly balanced: a nice hop flavor of citrus and mint followed by a delicious malty sweet flavor. At 25 IBUs, this is not a bitter beer like most of theirs, instead it is a session beer (at the upper ABV spectrum) that is so smooth and drinkable. The finish is so clean and begs for more sips, I wish this wasn't the only bottle for 500+ miles.","dreadnatty08","0"

Smell has a bit of a metalic hint to it with a brown sugary undertone. Not an overpowering odor by any means, very pleasant. A very subtle crisp hop odor tickles the nose as well. Taste is very unique. Much more thick and chewy than I had anticipated, but very enjoyable. This is a tough beer to grasp a taste on, for some reason I feel as this is almost like an ESB. Mild hop bitterness with a sweet caramel malt that balances this out quite well. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Carbonation is minimal from start to finish.

Toasty pale malt, crystal malt, and strong dextins make up the malt aromas, with a healthy whiff of herabl and grassy American hops. First sip is sweet with caramel and toasty Biscuit malt, with a background roasted note. Flavor becomes deeply dextrinous for a brief moment before slipping into a delicate buttery fruit taste. This quickly gives way to a semi-dry aftertaste of piney resinous and bitter herbal American hops. Balanced and complex flavor, a credit to the style. Medium bodied, with a light carbonation that gives the illusion of extra body while retaining enough fine bubbles to ward off cloying from the large malt base. Finishes with residual caramel and roast tones, a touch of pumpkin fruitness and a mellow but full pine cone hop flavor. here is an amber ale with enough flavor top keep your attention but drinkable enough to be considered a session ale; likely to change some people's opinion of boring Red ales.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 26, 2007"

The pint glass I used was barely enough to contain the foamy head and the clear copper colored liquid. The smell was quite mild and sweet, with almost no hint of the hops typical in the offerings of this West Coast brewery. The taste was crisp, caramelized, and airy . The hops showed up as spicy overtones and citrus peels and were quite a bit more prominent than first hinted at by the smell, but the malt was clearly in charge of the whole taste. This was quite a deliberately balanced offering. As a result this beer felt full but subtle, and effect that is rarely seen in these days of ever bigger creations.

Smell is cool, jelly-bean-sweet, and a little American hoppy. Kind of a typical amber ale taste, with a slightly sweet body, moderate bitterness, and stiff dose of hop flavor... still, very well done over all. Light toasty flavors start the sip and are followed up by clean citrusy hops; body is solid but not heavy.

Mild fruity esters rise to mingle with the malt in the middle of the taste and then these settle as a light tang steps in as part of the aftertaste. The tang has a really nice orange zest flavor...no pith, just the thinest of the zest. There may be some hop bitter with the tang but the settle quickly as fruity esters (apricot and pear) rise up my throat to leave a wet sweet in my mouth. Fine carbonation still forms on my tongue to fight the thick body. It's mildy carbonated and very refreshing.","mentor","Beers"

I expected less from this beer but found it drinks as pleasing as it did on draught with a slightly different finish. The nose was smalll with malts and floral hops.

The body is a beauty as well, amber with an orange haze to it. The nose is sugary with hints of a caramel presence. The mouthfeel strikes me as clean and wholesome. Overall the maltiness is prevalent, but there is some nuttiness lingering and its quite juicy really. The finish stays sweet and is a little more grainy.

The taste is sweet up front, and stays that way as it finishes with a heavy handed crystal malt caramel notes. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish that helps to balance this malt dominated brew. This beer has a medium full body contributed by the malt. The biggest problem with this beer is that it is a bit simplistic, though admittedly this is a pretty weak problem. This beer is pretty straight forward, and I almost think that a beer with this many malt & caramel notes would more fittingly be a low alcohol session brew.","Gueuzedude","Feb 12, 2005"

The head is thin and off-white however, poor retention. The aroma is rich and full, caramel and toasted malts, dates and currents, some citrus along with a full boquet of hops, it all blends and balances out so nicely. The flavour is not as action packed in the beginning, subdued malt and dried fruit, carried along by a full mouthfeel, the alcohol can be felt but not tasted as much. Things pick up towards the end, everything slowly surfaces at once, sweet buttery malt, meaty dried fruit, with citrusy hops that go herbal on the aftertaste. Very drinkable for a strong ale, smooth mouthfeel, light flavour. But it loses me in the flavour department a bit, is lacking in more character to make it memorable, to leave an impression. A wallflower when it should be out there breakdancing, it has all the right moves, it just doesn't utilize them to their fullest. If it were less shy this would be an excellent strong ale.

I'm glad, because I like this stuff. Pours a nice dark ""rich copper"" color, as suggested on the label, with a little tan bubbly head. Smell is great, and complex. Swirls of sweet carmely malts and fruity piney hops combine here to create a great scent. The taste just screams balance. Malty up front with notes of carmel, vanilla, other sweetness, followed by a great bitter hop ass kicking. Fruity and floral like a pale ale too.

The hops share aroma with some of the malt character, maybe ribbon candy or figs. Nice malt aroma. The taste has more malt up front than I expected. A rich character that I would associate more with a dark lager than an ale. Very pleasing with a thick mouth feel.

A very slight roastiness and smokiness is apparent, but it is way down, deep down in there. The hops come along, with bright pine flavors to keep the beer from being too sweet. The alcohol mostly invisible, flavorwise, but there is definitely some spiciness happening here. The yeast adds a rich, buttery element that works nicely with the malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, with a slight prickliness. This is a fine, healthy brew, but like Lagunitas' other strong beers, I have to question why this has so much alcohol. To my tastes, it only serves to mask the flavor somewhat. It's like a blurry lens over the beer. Otherwise, this is a good, rich tasting red ale with an interesting and pleasing amount of hoppiness. I suppose one could give this strong beer good scores for drinkability, but I have chosen not to because I found the first sip to be the best-tasting, and each subsequent sip not quite as good.","Thrasher","Apr 24, 2004"

I liked it so much initialy, I went back and got a 6-er for myself to conduct a thorough eval. Poured a glorious coppery color into my chalice with about 2 1/2 fingers of fluffy cloud-like head which took several minutes to dissipate, leaving a nice lacing on the glass. Smell was fresh bread/caramel, with a hint of fruity banana. I tried to find some of the 7.7% ABV, but it just wasn't there...Scary! Taste was initially going towards sweet caramel, but the 30 or so I.B.U.'s mellowed the sweetness to a glorious mild bitterness. I must admit, I am a hophead who loves it bitter, but this was a very smooth, drinkable, ever so tastey offering from Lagunitas!

The smell did not impress that much, with a pretty earthy malt scent and not much else. The taste is quite simple with a great malt profile, not much in the way of hops but the malt is not overly sweet so it tends to balance out. Slight carmel notes in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel is excelent on this one though, very smoothe and crisp and very drinkable.

Smells highly of alcohol. Beer is thick, and definitely was sweet, but i dont think it holds up to the smell. Less bold than I predicted. The ops are subdoed, but come poking out arbitrarily in the flavor, making for an overall nice herterogenous mixture. Taste is finished off by a grapefruit like, citric acidity, which I dont believe fits very well with the rest of the beer. Overall, I'm quite pleased, but mostly with the smell.","gnaussea","Oct 15, 2003"
3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"You wouldn't guess the Kronic has a 7.7% ABV - it's very well disguised. As such, it's a dangerously drinkable brew but not one I'd use as a session beer. Not a real complex beer but still possessing enough vitality and diversity of flavors to warrant giving it a try.","Boilermaker88","Sep 29, 2003"
3.72,0,3,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Notes: Tasty, to be sure, but the flavor profile is a tad ho-hum, in my opinion, to warrant a 7.7% ABV.","Mustard","Sep 22, 2003"
3.63,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkablilty: Overall, nice. Would be a great ""session"" beer if it had some more body and at least some finish to it. Needs some refinement to truly be an above average brew.","winomark","Sep 01, 2003"
4.08,9.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability  I could easily get trashed on this stuff. It went down extremely well and failed to warn of the rather hefty ABV.","RoyalT","Aug 27, 2003"
4.35,16.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I decided to try this one after it beat out some pretty choice beers in a blind taste test a co- worker of mine conducted with himself. I was not completely impressed with the appearance as the head retention was poor and lacing was almost non existent. The deep amber/copper color though was appealing. Aroma was fresh, bready, malty and slightly hoppy. A very nice nose indeed. Smooth did I say smooth taste? very nice and tilted towards the caramel malt with a alanced but back seat hoppiness. Very drinkable and could be one of the top ambers I have had, might have to do my own taste test soon. Suzanne liked it too. Upon trying a second bottle, said sample had a nice head and left good lacing, so I upped it's appearance a bit.","Mark","Aug 21, 2003"
3.8,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Dark copper color. Medium to large head. A medium bodied ale, most reminiscent of a amber. Malty and slightly hoppy. The malt sweetness is balanced by a slight hop spiciness. Full flavored. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with a slight residual bitterness. Refreshing. VERY nice beer.","beerguy101","Aug 16, 2003"
4.15,11.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The brew has a nice copper amber color with a light amount of head that doesn't seem to fade. The smell is lightly hopped and mildly fruity intising you to try it. The taste is slightly fruity but not overpowering. After a couple sips the true undertones in the flavors come out revealing some honey and cherry type flavors (probably also with a bit of caramel). Overall very drinkable and worth checking out.","Elemental","Aug 10, 2003"

3.7,-0.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at OBF2003. Rich copper color, billed as a copper at the festival, which differs somewhat from BA. Mild hop aromas, mild flavors, but just enough to keep me curious through the beer. Seems a supreme backyard beer, though uncertain how it would fair during the cooler months.","freed","Jun 20, 2003"

It is a hoppy beer but well balanced. The flavor is very smooth and enjoyable. It's a nice brew","jcalabre","Jan 02, 2003"
3.94,5.9,5,3.5,3.5,4,5,"Brilliantly clear dark copper hue. Covered by a thick, rutted, persistent ivory white head that leaves rough lace. Spicy hops with contrasting soapy citrus hit the nose at first, then are contrasted by medium lovibond caramel malt with a tinge of toffee. Swirling releases mellow, ripe red currant like fruity esters. Pleasant, but not quite unified in aroma. Snap of candyish sweetness initially in flavor is tapered by moderate, well calculated hop bitterness and a slight acidic twang. Pronounced, lingering tang of salty biscuit emerges mid palate along with a mellow floral and citric hop flavor combination. The high apparent attenuation lends a crisp, agreeably smooth mouthfeel that belies the alcohol content. Finishes mostly clean with fleeting bready malt yielding to soft hop bitters. The Kronic is an odd, enjoyable brew. Not complex, but dangerously balanced and well brewed. Easily as drinkable as insipid American ambers of much lower strength. There is absolutely no reason why it has to be almost 8% ABV, though. Gimme a 40 of this in a brown paper sack and I'm good to go...","marc77","Aug 28, 2002"
4.24,14,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"The pour is a slightly cloudy reddish orange with a grandiose head that dissipates to fine sheets of sticky lace that clings mightily to the glass. A nice floral tone up front with malt and a butter like aromas also present, clean and fresh, with a malt sweet start that leads to the middling top. The beer finishes with a planetary hop bite, prickly in its acidity, dry lingering aftertaste. Id call it a ""Hop Heads"" delight and I must say Lagunitas is a fine brewery with a great line of beers that also inhabit my Stable.","Gusler","Aug 24, 2002"
4.38,17.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear, deep amber-red with copper highlights. Full, foamy cream colored head that has excellent retention and leaves some really nice lace. Very nice lightly fruity, malty and hoppy aroma. It's medium bodied with a soft carbonation that gives it a really nice creaminess in the mouth. There's some lightly fruity, sweetish caramel malt up front (even lightly toasty), becoming creamier and more mellow as it crosses the palate - revealing some nice floral & grassy hop flavor. It finishes with a good blend of sweet malt and light hop flavor amongst a gentle, earthy bitter dryness - (kind of herbal in a way). The alcohol is very well cloaked. This is an exceptionally well balanced and well brewed beer, especially considering its original gravity and strength. Full flavored but not overwhelming as might be expected. It's not complex, but has a rich characeter that's very drinkable. Exceptionally enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Aug 05, 2002"
4.38,17.7,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This review will be 'censored' free...... The Kronic had a decent head on the pour, but settled rather quickly. There was still a little there, but not enough to even tickle your nose. The Kronic is dark copper in color. The Kronic isn't a very hoppy beer, so hopheads will be disappointed in that, but don't get me wrong....the Kronic is malty and a wonderful tasting beer.","sinistersteve","Jul 25, 2002"
4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice copper with a white head.  Good hop kick with some nice sweetness underneath.  As the beer warmed, I found some nutty and toasted flavors.  Balanced toward the hoppy side.  A good, solid beer.","jreitman","Beers"
3.8,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours copper, as the name would indicate, with a light brown head.  It has a delicate hop aroma with some metallic smell.  Despite a nice malty background and a nice amount of hops, the metallic taste was just a bit off-putting.  Overall, it's very mellow and drinkable for a beer of its abv.","mickeymac","0"
