"Not much in the nose, but great taste start to finish. Compared to the Ninkasi Red, this wins, no contest."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, light toffee, and floral/toast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant amber ale. Good balance of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"O: A good, reliable amber/red ale, though I feel it could use a few tweaks. As is, the hop bitterness is a little overpowering, especially on the entry, thus rendering the overall balance and integration of malt and hop flavors a little off throughout."

"Comments: This is an excellent Red Ale, that could be argued as a red IPA, as the hop character is huge!"

"Reddish amber in color. A millimeter thick bit of foam rests on top. Brussels lacing on the glass. Aroma is of amber malt and I get a good dose of the pine like hops. Good balance of bitterness with the pine like hops and the amber malt. The hops tend to dominate. Mouth is prickling my tongue with the bitterness."
""
""
""
"Flavorful red ale, very sessionable and more assertive than complex. It would be much nicer if they beef up both malt and hops."
"D - 5.1%, could have more than one, but I find the citrus flavors too intense and too candy like, even with the bitter finish. Otherwise, tho completely different, it's with Nugget Nectar, as a solid Red Ale that you really must try. Original, and intense red. Not for everyone."

"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent rust color with virtually no head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is malty with some caramel and spicy hop notes. The taste is the caramel malts upfront followed by some bread and toffee. Spicy and floral hops towards the finish with more caramel at the end. A bit sweet but with a decent amount of hop bite. Even though it's dry hopped, this one tastes more malt forward to me. Medium bodied with a slightly thin mouthfeel. I was expecting more hop flavor out of this one but it's still a decent Red Ale. Overall, I'd grab it again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."

"The deepest, funkiest, dankest hop stew. I'm not entirely sure what the point is of brewing a beer like this, but it's quite distinctive and I don't mean that as a compliment. Cardboard and resiny murk. Quite bitter and herbal at the finish. No sediment. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Bottlecraft in San Diego."
"O: Great drinkability. Rogue quality"
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is much like the nose with malty goodness at the start and a definite licorice quality to it. Mild bitterness that lingers briefly."

"Overall: Just a bit out-of-balance to me. The hoppy reads I have enjoyed have been included a lot more red malt flavor. Won't buy again any time soon, but glad I got to taste it. Rogue just has potential to do it better than this."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good hoppy red ale, you could pound a few of these with the mild abv. Pleasant enough for a hop head, but not overly agressive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Can't find a date on the bottle, but I'm sure this beer is really good when fresh. It has a nice flavour but it doesn't have much hop vibrancy. Still a good beer that I will seek out again - hopefully with a date on the bottle."

"Pours a ruby red with a medium beige, slowly fading head. Some light lacing. Aroma of earthy piney hops, caramel malt, yeast with some dark fruity esters of plums fill the senses. Taste is earthy piney hops, caramel malt, yeast and bready, some toffee notes. Palate is a medium body, sweet with some bitter notes on the tongue, with good carbonation. Finish with caramel malt, yeast and bready, dark fruits, some toffee notes and some good earthy piney hops for balance, ending has a nice dry hopped nutty toffee lingering flavor. Overall a very good, flavorful and pleasant brew."

"Maybe it's the yeast..."
""
""
""
""
"With each drink the smell of honey took over the taste but subsided once the bitter settled in on the back of the tongue. It's an interesting brew and worth a try; not one of the best of Rogue's lineup. Enjoyable, but I wouldn't get it again."
""
""
""
"I feel this is superseded even by local takes on the style (Wayward, Riverside)."
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how I feel about this beer. It seems a bit unbalanced. The dark malt notes pop up from time to time to clash with the big breadiness that dominates the flavor. The hop character is piny and bitter and doesn't seem to mesh with the awkward malt character. This isn't a bad beer, but it I'll say it's muddled. The next time I'm in the mood for an amber ale, I'll seek something a little more fine-tuned."
""
"Overall I am not going to get it again but it's not as bad as others say."
""
""
""
"Overall: Maybe I purchased a bad/old/light struck bottle. Therefore, I may give it a second chance one day. Nevertheless, I was disappointed with this beer. I was expecting a hoppier red ale with a fat malt backbone to make for some delicious sipping."

" Overall , maybe I got a bad bottle , an old bottle , it was in a pick 6 and the store is always rotating stock and keeps fresh beer , not too many old beers in there but this very well could have been , I may try another at a different store"

"Low on alcohol but still a good ale. I like it."
""
"A less aggressive 5AM Saint. Centennial shows up big and there might be a big of chocolate malt in there but no dry hopping except for a slight grassiness. Not approaching Red Rocket or Cascazilla, but a solid amber."

"O: Very hoppy and flavorful for both the style and the limited ABV. A bit rugged. Improved with some warming."

"Yes, this was a session beer but I wouldn't have another of these if it was the only beer left in my fridge. I had a bad feeling about this when it bubbled over upon opening and like a few others on here, I didn't taste the dry hopping on here. If this was made another way in the past, I'd give that a go since something's not lining up right at all with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, but not great. The flavor was lacking in strong malt characteristics."
"Final Thoughts: If you like Red Ales then this would be a good choice because it has a sufficient amount of flavor and is sessionable at 5.10% abv. Definitely not among the best, but a pretty good brew none the less."
"overall this wasnt a bad beer especially to a person such as myself just now exploring craft beer. id drink this beer again although for the price id much prefer other beers."
""
""
"Pours a deep ruby color with off-white head that settles to a film on top throughout the whole drink. Hops appear to be of the floral variety, as I only get a mild floral character on the nose. Similarly, the taste is very mild with a certain bitterness that isn't made up for with the flavor. Not much carbonation or anything to spruce it up at all. Just a very plain beer. Rogue has another red which is much better than this."

"Overall - An interesting, but not elite red. If memory serves correct, and I believe it does, I liked this beer better when it wasn't dry-hopped as it is now. I wish they'd release that version again."
""
"Taste is mild with a slight citrus hops touch, but this is backed up by a substantial malt profile. Not bad, not great, but just a fine and drinkable session ale."
""
"O: Nice and smooth, easy to have quite a few of..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- at $15 a six pack unless this was a flook bottle I won't be picking this up anymore. It resembles my first home-brew(although this is drinkable) which was poured down the drain due to bad yeast. I was expecting more from rogue."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable ale that goes down easy. Well worth a try."
"On-tap.Pint glass.Enjoyed on novÂ´11.Reddish copper in color,quite foggy.Off-white froth. Crown is close & dense with good retention. Yeasty,piney & resiny aromas to the nose.Bitter upfront then a slightly malt flavor overwhelm the palate.In the middle subtle citric notes. Medium body,gentle carbonation.Good drinkability."
"Pours a hazy-clear red copper with an antique white-cream colored head. Nice head retention, offering an impressive looking glass of beer. Foam laces the glass as the head dissipates. Sweet, malty caramel and mild toffee aroma. Nice mouthfeel. The water used for brewing seems to be a little harder with natural minerals; like a softer rye ale. Excellent carbonation. Caramel, sorghum, and Christmas pull candy flavors. Finishes with a pleasant bite for a great balance. Rogue always delivers tasty, interesting beers, but you'll never say, ""Wow!"""

"An above average red ale although not spectacular. A solid beer I would have again."

"Poured a deep unfiltered brown-red with aa frothy cherry-tinted thick head and lots of lacing. Smell a pleasing cinnamon apple spice with a hint of nutmeg. Taste, a well balanced malty spiced chocolate-caramel with a smattering of bitter hops and barnyard hay barrels, lingering nicely. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good but not overwhelming carbonation. Drinkibility is nice and smooth. This is a fine red ale from Rogue and one I will look forward to having again sometime.... I like the subtle bitter hop kick!"
""
"Overall: Too much sweetness and not enough hops for my palate; more of a Red Ale for the mainstream, I'm afraid"
""
""
"O - not bad, however nothing special. i liked the toasted sweetness of the beer, but not the over abundance of bitter hops in the initial taste."
"Would recommend to friends and buy again!"
""
""
"O: Not my favorite from Rogue, but it is still a quality beer with good flavors."
""
""
"O- Apparently this is Santa's Private Reserve is in its original form. No wonder it's so good."

"Nice amber red to dark gold color in the glass. Descent amount of head too. Hops. Citrus. Slight malt. Easy drink ability. Nice session beer. Never seen this available in my bottle shop. I don't know why, I would def buy it if so. Highly reccomended for a dry hop pale. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another good offering from Rogue that does not quite match their American Amber Ale. The ale could use more balance, but it is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Mouthfeel is light and almost watery with light carbonation, a light body and a slightly bitter and dry aftertaste. This was a decent beer, and while I would drink it again I would not seek it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I thought this was a great beer. The combination of slight bitterness and sweetness were balanced and was very refreshing. I need to try more dry hopped beers and I look forward to trying this one again."
""
""
""

""

"Very straight-forward and no-frills for Rogue, I must say. Not as much hop aroma as I expected; a decent amount of pine, pepper, and grass. Taste was refreshingly smooth, drinkable, yet substantial; the beer has the right amount of heft yet it remains balanced. Malty caramel, roasty-goodness alongside fresh, sparkly hops. Well done, Rogue."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, auburn-brown coloring with a thin, big bubbled, frothy, yellow-tan colored head that clings scantily all over the glass. Tangy sweet and slightly sour malt aromas, with a peppery hops blend. Flavor blasts hop forward, with the taste at the tip and sides of the tongue. The tangy and slightly roasted caramel sweetness fills the middle of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. The aftertaste is light, with a slight cloying feel, and a resiny kick of the hops. The finish is slick, but cleans up quickly. Decent brew, and very easy to drink."
"Aroma is straight fresh soft citric hops with a strong malt backbone smelling of mild yet sweet caramel malts. I like the balance here, hoppy yet the malt bill is prevelant. Balance is evident on the tongue as well, sweet malts & mixed citric make this red ale a standout for its style, although the extreme hop usage may deviate from the traditional sense. Right up there with CCB Tocobaga in my opinion!"
"O: Love this beer! It was a little over the top with the hops - but that it is how I like it."
"Nice little 12oz. A pleasant sweet malty aroma with hints of citrus hops. Appearance is amber with light white head. Taste is bitter, malty and slightly yeasty. Pallet is slick and bitter with a sharp carbonation. Another solid addition to Rogues lineup."
"Not a bad beer but not a great one either."
"O: A above average Amber Ale. Good hop profile throughout, very earthy. Would have expected more malt character. Certainly worth a shot!"
"This poured out as a reddish brown colored brew with a yellowish off white head on top. The beer has good clarity to it. The lacing is thin but does stick around for just a little. The smell of the beer has some sweet malts mixed in with a really nice hoppy aroma. The taste of the beer has a pretty strong bitterness to it with some sweetness in the back end as well. The mouthfeel of the beer is average really, it's nothing to write home about. Overall this brew isn't too bad, it's enjoyable but I never went out of my way to have it again either."
"O - okay, this wasn't a bad beer. It was a good beer. By no means great, but just a better than average good beer. Honestly, I expected more from this red ale. This continued as I scoped the color and look of this red. Rogue usually always hits the mark for me, but this one just didn't get all the way there. Came up a bit short. However, that being said, it's still a pretty good brew. Some unique flavors I've never experienced and that alone makes it worth a try. I'm sure I'll buy another at some point in time. Especially if I can get it as a single bottle like this time. It's a remarkably gorgeous looking brew in body color and head."
"O: Another solid brew from Rogue Ales, noice."
"O - A fine beer, but overall not very remarkable."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I have no way of telling how old or fresh this beer is, but I'm going to assume that it may have been a bit hoppier earlier on. With no bottle dating or sediment, I'm left to review as is. A decent malty fall beer. Wouldn't buy a whole sixer if left up to me though."
"O: From the aroma of this beer it had a nice start, from the taste to the mouth of the beer it kind of lost me. Overall still a decent beer from Rogue."
"I have been extremely impressed with every beer I have tried from Rogue in the past. I dont know whether this one came from a bad batch... or what. Theres just no dimension or flavor to it. Its got almost no aftertaste. Its got almost no taste. I do not recomend this one."
"The body is, as the style would dictate, amber in color with some dark mahogany hues. A one and a half inch head, off-white to cream in color, develops and leaves patches of bubbly, wet lacing as it subsides. The smell is of toasted malt, toffee, some caramel, faint fruits (cherry, plum), and some citrusy hops. Taste emphasizes the toasted malt, though the caramel is also readily noticeable. The citrus and fruit shines through in the rear. Mouth is very smooth throughout, but finishes a touch sticky. Overall, a very good amber that Iâll gladly have again."
"Overall a unique tasting Ale with the sweet and bitter flavors complimenting each other quite well."
"O: Not a terrible beer. Has some deficiencies, but is still drinkable."
"Overall, a good brew, though strongly biased toward hoppy bitterness."
"bottle poured into glass."
"A decent enough red ale, just kind of plain, and subtly underwhelming all-around."
"Pours a deep orange color with a reddish tint and an one finger soapy head which recedes to skim but does leave some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma was very faint, I got a caramel malt backbone with a hint of sweetness at the beginning but mostly got an earthy like almost musty aroma. The taste follows suit closely there is a caramel malt backbone with hints of sweetness in the middle. The end of the beer has that earthy hop bite, this is the main flavor of the beer that I got. The mouthfeel was moderately carbonated. Overall it was an okay beer, the nose was a little faint, but the taste was better. It did just kinda leave me wanting more out of it, the flavor was average but not very complex."
"Overall. Not bad. Flavours seemed a little attenuated, but not too shabby."
"The flavor is decent and well balanced. The hop character is light, and the beer finishes with a malty, fruity character. Overall, a decent brew, but nothing to get too excited about. I'd have it again."
"My wife love it and got mad that i didn't rate it higher."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: A very good American amber beer. Really well balanced and easy to drink. Could easily do a session with these when I'm in the mood for a good malty amber beer that also has a good dry-hopped flavor. Very nice."
"This it a good beer to have with a dinner meal that might include some Bar -B-Q ribs."
"Dark ruby with cola edges, an off white head dissipates to a half finger of loose bubbles. Vegetable hop nose with candied malt. Malty up front but less than the smell would have you think. Burnt caramel, and grain. Herbal hop residue. Pure soft water, very smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. Bitters in the dry finish."
"Overall this beer really isn't that bad (or good) it just doesn't live up what the label suggests and is just your basic amber ale."
"Overall- Very nice beer. I usually do not like Amber Ales, but this is one of the better examples I have had. I feel this is largely due to the dry hopping they used."
"This was a solid take on a Red Ale from Rogue, and I liked that this focused a bit more on the roasted character of the malts than their regular American Amber Ale does. The hops didnât quite assert themselves like I would have expected but then again, Iâm not quite sure of the age of this bottle. I still liked what I found here though and would definitely try this on draft if I saw it."
"This is another great rogue beverage."
"Prost!!!"
"D- Its good but not my first choice."
"Have yet to found a Rogue brew I disagree with. Wish we had more of this in the South!"
"The smell and taste sort of remind me of Samuel Smith Indian ale but with more intensity. Not bad, but a little too bitter for me if having a few. Wondering what the hops used were though. Lots of high alpha maybe."
"D- The hops are a little strong but this is certainly enjoyable enough to go back to for a few more, just wouldn't make it my regular beer of choice"
"Leaves more of an ipa mouthfeel than a red, a hoppy red, but not up to par with the levels brought by nugget nectar. But easily a second tier red ale. $12 a 6 pack hurts drinkability of this beer."
"Now to taste. Right off the bat you are greeted with the very hoppy and aromatic (can taste be aromatic?). It wasn't too hoppy to me and the subsequent taste of malts helped but I was disappointed in the lack of finish. A great beer has good flavor throughout and this only had good flavor at the beginning."
"This beer has changed a bit in the last few years. The bros shoulld update. Presented in that classic Rogue 22oz bomer with a very informative lable. This particular bottle was dedicated to a bull named Fukutsuru, cool. Impressivly clear pour considering the layer of yeast in the bottom. Gorgious red color and a nice lingering lacy off white head. Really sensuall hop aroma of spring flowers and almost berry-like undertones. Malt is resting just underneath in a warm bready invitation. The flavor is a gentle yet assertive fruity purfumy dose of hops backed up by a full buffet of toasty, bready, caramel malt. It is nice and bitter until the very end when the malt tips the balance and gives a pleasent flower laced toasty bread finish. The malt wakes up a lot as it warms. This is the perfect American red. Very hoppy without being too bitter, very malt without being heavy or sweet. Perfect session beer. I could drink myself stupid and back on this if I could only get a meat head bar owner in Knoxville to carry it on draft. Slainte."
"Over all not really impressed with this rogue i expected more out of it just came off as bland and simple Another beer to mark off the list. But not one I will have again."
"D: Only if you are a hop-head like I often am. Awesome."
"D- Easy to drink and an overall good beer."
"Overall a decent beer, but not sure why the y had to dry hop it"
"D - Great drinkability. The flavors are pleasant and aren't overwhelming."
"I am getting lots of flaws here (or what I think of as flaws). Soap, oil, diacetyl all mix together for something I don't care for much. Not something I would recommend. Typical of Rogue."
"Appearance is a nice red/auburn color. Smelled ok, but didn't have the big citrusy hop aroma I was hoping for in a dry-hopped ale. Taste was also disappointing as it seemed almost a bit sour. Mouthfeel was fine and the drinkability would have been good had I enjoyed the flavor more."
"A nice beer and one I enjoyed. It's good, not great and while it fits the bill it's just not epic."
"D= One of the better beers that I've had from Rogue I did take my time with it but it was pretty good.."
"D - I don't drink a lot of these beers but really enjoyed this one."
"Amber color beer with some reddish notes. Nice foamy head forms up but disappear quickly. The aroma is hops (citrus and grapefruits) with some malts too. Caramel malts, which I get in almost all Rogue brews I've tasted so far. The smell makes me want to go for a sip. Less intense on the taste, than it was on the aroma. Still citrus with some grapefruits. Medium bitterness. Medium body. Carbonation is present in the mouth. So easy to drink. Overall, a good session brew from Rogue."
"The appearance is deep amber with an average head. The aroma is sweet and caramel like with pine hops and a touch of paper. The taste is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall this is a decent beer. When I was drinking it was was a little torn between good and not so good."
"D: The overall taste and characteristic of the body make this a nice brew, but nothing that is worth writing home about."
"The beer pours a pleasant light chocolate amber in color, and produces a two finger white head with huge bubbles. In the aroma the sweet malt and roasted chocolate stand out in the front, but there are traces of citrus in the finish. Bitter citrus fruits take precedence in the flavor, and there is a nice chocolate toffee element holding things together. The body is thin and watery with huge carbonation. Overall I'm not very impressed with this beer. Bear Republic's Red Rocket just blows this beer out of the water. It's not a bad beer; it's just too thin and watery with a washed out flavor."
"Pours a medium-dark golden brown, with a few fingers of yellowish/off white head. Sticky lace and a nice layer of head is retained. Nose is full of hops, lots of citrus and grapefruit and the toffee notes from the malts stand out real well. Some lighter tropical fruits make their way in there too. Some drying, grassy notes also. Decent in taste as well, citrus notes aren't as prominent but work with the toffee malt which stands out here. Highly carbonated, and feels fairly watery; dry finish with lingering bitterness. Reasonable drinkability, although I'm not sure I'd pursue it on my own. Decent effort, nice to try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium. (To me, there is no ideal mouthfeel/drinkability, it's all situational. I want a light to medium bodied beer with a meal, but if it's dessert or with a cigar or something, then it's different...)"
"Drinkability: Would like the hop to last a bit longer. I won't write this one off, but the next one will need to be free."
"CHEERS!!"
"D-it's ok"
"Overall, this is a kick-ass red ale, and definitely how they're supposed to be made. The only other one I've enjoyed this much was Bear Republic's Red Ale, which is equally as hoppy and delicious. I hate plain jane malty and unenthusiastic reds, and this is anything but. Kudos, Rogue. Now just don't be so damn expensive."
"D: I could have more than one, but at the price here in Missouri, I could find better for the price."
"As cask ales go, this was quite good although I suspect this is even better with a bit more fizz in a bottle. A very peachy aroma slams the nose, with edges of oranges and yeast. Fruit everywhere in the taste: more peaches, pears, apples... there's a whole freakin' orchard in that cask. Also a barrel of malt. There's a feathery hit of hops at the end, but is barely noticeable. The nearly non-existent carbonation gives it a heavy feel and makes it something to drink slowly. Nice, but not quite right for the hot summery weather when I tried it. Would be even better in the fall."
"m/d- very full bodied and smooth drinker in which you could knock down a couple of these before you catch yourself."
"Taste: like it smells, caramel malts are well balanced with hopped up flavors."
"Pairing: Carnitas taco with salsa verde and onion (mostly because that's my go to ""session"" food)"
"Clear copper-red pour with quickly fading head and nice lacing. Lots of sweet caramel malt and brown sugar in the nose with a hint of pine also. The taste is much the same with the roasty caramel malt dominating. Nicely balanced with some piney bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is quite nice, somewhere between creamy and syrupy but very smooth and drinkable. A decent interpretation."
"3.45avg 6/14/2004"
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Taste: Toasted cherry malts with a pleasantly sharp bitterness up front. Ripe, syrupy fruits that are semisweet and nicely balanced by bitterness and carbonation. Finish is pretty dry, bitter, cherry/grapefruit."
"Drinkability - For almost a red ale I found it very easy to drink. In my opinion this is one of the beers best features."
"OK, but not that good of a value."
"Buy Again? No."
"The drinkability as always is pretty good, although I can see how the bitter finish would throw people off and steer them away from high ratings in this category. But seriously, to each his own and I really enjoy the finish of this brew so I gotta go high on this."
"Drinkability: The malty flavors make the bitter beginning a contrast to enjoy and make it easy to drink."
"taste is of grain, roasted malt, hops, malt, nice citrus flavors around the edges, and caramel, leaves the mouth a little dry and bitter."
"D- if they made a 12 pack id never have indecision at the store agian. and id be a very broke man"
"Nothing too memorable here, but a pleasant brew, for sure!"
"Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale is a hazy red ale with a blotchy, yellowish, off-white head that has outstanding lacing. It has a very hoppy aroma, like orange peel and pine needles. It has a smooth, medium body with a dry finish. It tastes really hoppy. It's pretty fruity, but not sweet. There's lots of grapefruit flavor. This is pretty much how a red ale should be."
"This is not a horrible beer but also not a beer that jumps out at me and says, grab another two or three."
" Glad I have some more."
"D: Very drinkable, and an interesting interpretation of an amber ale."
"Light bodied, thin and watery. This becomes less of an issue as the beer's palatability increases, but it's still undesirable. Not terrible, but could have been so much better."
"I will defiantly be buying this in the future, I love this beer and am angry that all i got was one in a mixed 6 pack.."
"Amberish red beer with pretty decent lacing and a truly awesome taste--this is a hoppier-than-average amber ale, lots of grapefruit and citrus hops with the caramel, a great hoppy beer without the bitterness of an IPA, also a very full and warm tasting beer with a silky mouthfeel and a nice long finish."
"The mouthfeel is a little syrupy and I would have definitely liked the beer to be a little more lively in terms of carbonation. This is the only Amber / Red Ale I've ever had, definitely looking forward to trying a few more of this style before I pass judgement on this one."
"Nothing crazy, just solid enjoyable every day beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Overall, I will definately drink this on the regular and suggest you all give it a shot, well worth the 13 bucks for a six pack."
"A deep orange hued amber color with an average tan head and decent lacing. It has a roasty malt scent backed by some floral notes. With a biscuity, caramel malt flavor mixed with some piney herbal hop. It has a nice medium bodied mouth feel, and while not a standout is still very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Drinkability: I doubt I could have more then two in a night as it borders heavy. However, it's a surprising take on one of my favorite styles of beer and is well worth the taste."
"Overall, I was hugely disappointed in this beer."
"Fairly drinkable. Could definitely session this red ale."
"(Bottle into pint glass) the pour was a hazy deep red with a half finger creamy white head. Aromas were at first heavy of a sweet pine, as well as a hint of sharp citrus. Already this was a little complex! The first tastes reinforced the pine elements, and a lingering aftertaste allowed some of the sweet citrus develop. Overall it was very calm in the mouth, which was very refreshing and allowed the flavors to develop. A very crisp and refreshing drink, that was a perfect compliment to the buffalo bitesI enjoyed it with."
"I was not as impressed with this one. It did not have the complexity that I was looking for. I much prefer Redhook ESB. It has the classic hoppy red beer that I look for."
"A great beer with plenty to offer, mouthfeel needs some work."
"D - This beer has good balance, good carbonation, and a low(ish) alcohol content, which could make it a decent session beer for those who like this style, but it behaves more like an IPA than a straight red ale. Expensive for a six, but I may try it again."
"cheers!"
"Yep, she's a redhead alright, with all the spunk and fire to go along. Nice nose to her but not like some of the hoppy blondes I usually chase after. I poured her into a tulip which works wonders for my DIPAs but it gave it an almost metallic smell (with some malts and hops to follow). I got about one inch of head with some residue on the sides. I'll end my review now and take another shot at her at a later date because this particular one is not as great as some I have had in the past. Maybe it is because I am not actually in the Navy Club drinking it with a pool cue."
"Eck. Taste is weird. Has some metallic and really off flavors. Not sure if this is intentional or what. Really not worth drinking It's maybe a bit oxidized, I'm not a fan."
"Taste is very watery up front. A background of carmel brought in by some piney hops, but overall thin and watery and slightly sour. I honestly just think this beer is old, but since there's no freshness date on the bottle I have no idea."
"D: Very interesting beer, I enjoyed this more that most of Roque's line."
"d- really drinkable, sessionable, solid amber ale, rogue still hasn't done me wrong and i'm not sure they ever will."
"'nuff said."
"Smooth, moderately rich mouthfeel."
"A solid red ale, more of a session style with low to medium tannins and medium alcohol. Great beer to prime the palate for their heavyweights."
"Would not purchase again."
"Nice off-white head, rich amber color. Fairly dark, still translucent. A little bit of carbonation bubbles. Smell is of fresh hops and caramel, some vanilla sweetness as well. The taste is mostly sweet, a bit of hops filling out the flavor. Crisp and refreshing, very tasty. Medium bodied and delicious, one of my favorite offerings from this brewery."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - really enjoy the blend of hops and red ale, good for when you want the hop flavor without the ipa"
"Tried this brew last night at the Yard House in Waikiki last night, it was my first of the night- rather appropriate for my very first review. Poured a deep red-orange with a finger of pale head that left lacing about halfway down the glass. Though not overpowering the hops and malt were clearly evident in the aroma, even with a hint of citrus. The first tase had a rich malt flavor, with the hops coming in prominently in the aftertaste with a mild but noticeable alcohol tinge to it. Rich, almost chewy feel going down despite the low carbonation, and extremely drinkable. I highly recommend this as a session beer wherever possible, as I could drink this all throughout the night."
"D-No thank you. Way overpriced. Too bad. It looked great, smelled good, but taste and mouthfeel were horribly lacking."
"D - This was a really good beer, I wish the 6 packs were available down here, I would really buy a lot of this beer"
"Very easy to drink. Goes down smooth and is thoroughly enjoyable."
"- Overall this isn't a bad red at all. I could use a 7% triple dry-hopped version... but this will do as a fantastic session brew. Price was a bit steep on the 6-pack. But that has nothing to do w/ my judging of the actual beer or review here."
"Drinkability: Another good beer by Rogue, and something I would love to session if it weren't so expensive (expensive by the standards of a college student)."
"Not something I would drink again. It's a hard to categorize brew, and it does poorly as an amber/red. But I wouldn't score higher as a specialty either. Rogue puts out some lovely brews but this is a miss with me."
"Rather sessionable and also very drinkable. The hops are great and fit well with the rest of the beer. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Another great beer from a brewery that has yet to dissapoint me!"
"Drinkability: I'm a Rogue fan. This is not an exception to that. Its a nice Roguey interpretation of a red ale. Big smell and taste, but not perfectly put together. Overall its quite enjoyable."
"D - decent brew, not my fave, but I'd buy again and drink from time to time."
"The price range would make it better for me but, still a beer i'll splurge on to take to a party when I just want something nice."
"This beer pours a rich red mahogany hue with vivid carbonation that leads to a two finger creamy head and prominent lacing all down the sides of the glass very impressive looking,it has fruity aromas of stonefruit,melon and some caramel maltiness,it has a nice fullish mouthfeel with tastes of stonefruits and tropical fruits flooding the palette and ending with a nice caramel malty bitter edge,a very nice beer prob up there with this breweries best in my books."
"As far as drinkability, it's delicious and relatively light. I could drink it all day."
"Creamy mouthfeel and VERY drinkable."
"D: Good drinkability, wish it were hoppier, though."
"The malt profile is big, making the hops a nice sidekick. Not a big hoppy bitter brew. A pleasant drinkable brew that pairs well with lots of foods (spicy foods and pub food esp)."
"Other comments: The aroma is the best thing about this beer. The dry-hopping has done its magic. Very lush and textured."
"Did not finish the bottle, Cannot recommend."
"Drinkabkle and delectable. I really like this beer; a really good American hopped ale. It was a perfect way to end my evening of American beery goodness."
"Clear copper body under full finger semi-rocky off-white head, quick dissipation, minimal lacing. Mild hop presence in nose with bready maltiness. Fairly pronounced hops on tastebuds, spicy from dry hopping. More caramel than bready maltiness taste. Active carbonated mouthfeel. Good with spicy food, but one bottle is enough. Fairly hoppy for a 'red'."
"Overall a decent, drinkable brew, just a little imbalanced."
"Great flavours, refreshing AND it clocks in a just 5.10%. Very drinkable. It's just dissapointing that it costs A$15/bomber here in Oz."
"This beer has a deep reddish color with a deep hue of amber. Plenty of lacing clings to the glass during the duration of me enjoying this beverage. The aroma, not surprising, is very hoppy and citric. Lots of toasted malt in the flavor. There is plenty of dry crackery malt and lots of floral hops which could could be shared with the people around me. The dryness is a bit intense, enough to slow down the drinkability, but it's not enough to keep me from enjoying this offering."
"This beer would be great with a good burger or steak as it is not overpowering and its smooth start to finish."
"First tried this beer at a festival and fell in love with it. This review is of a six pack that I picked up last week. Have to say it doesn't live up to my memory of it a couple of years ago. It is still not a bad beer just not what I remembered. Beer poured with a tan head that quickly died down to a thin layer leaving a decent lace on the glass. Color was a hazy redish amber. Nose was nicely floral, citrusy from the dry hopping. Good mouthfeel, slightly oily with malt becoming more apparent as the beer warmed in the hand. Overall, a drinkable beer, just not as good as my first experience with it. Perhaps the festival's version was fresher. Cheers."
"A real shame because it was expensive."
"Overall, This was the first Rogue I've had since I really got into crafts. It's got a unique look to it, and all the other features fit everything a good, complex-yet-balanced, amber should follow. Also try the Santa's Private Reserve Ale"
"D - goes down really smoothly."
"Nice, hoppy red ale. I'm surprised at how much I liked this one. It pours a lovely amber-red-brown with a creamy tan head. The aroma is hop forward with a strong pine/citric flavor, but a mild but sweet caramel malt is still evident. It's not a perfectly balanced amber, like some, but it works well for me. It is refreshingly bitter with an undercurrent of pleasant sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth with a healthy hop bite in the aftertaste. The drinkability is very good for my palate, but I understand the argument of the anti-hopped-up-ambers crowd."
"D - Everything's better when it's dry hopped...Rogue did a great job with this Amber/Red Ale...could have used a little more hop flavor...all around a solid brew"
"While not too bitter, it's also not at all what I expected. I imagine that others would like this brew better, but I did not finish 12 ounces."
"Poured from a bomber, the beer pours truly red. it has a good head that stays around during quaffing. The carbonation is a bit too much fo this style, but as it warms it becomes tolerable. The nose is a bit dissappointing. It's all hops. Just piney, clean hops. The flavor expresses more though. The Malt shows, with toasty notes and faint sweetness. It finishes dry with notes of pine and citrus. The mouthfeel of this red is pretty average. Medium bodied and flavorful, but it is almost too clean. Each sip goes down and the flavor is gone just as fast. Overall, St. Rogue is very easy to drink. Rather than the food pairings on the bottle, I could have this beer with mild cheeses or with oily fish. Smoked Salmon would be a perfect snack with this brew."
"Overall: Mildly disappointed. The mouthfeel and vague off-tastes set this beer back a little for me. Ok beer, but not enough to have me eager to return for another."
"Overall, not bad, but there are many better amber ales to be had."
"D - Very well balanced enough carbonation, no to malty or hoppy enough balance to cool you down. Love it."
"Pours a crystal clear, deep amber and produces a small thick head that leaves almost no lacing. Does not look very carbonated, with few tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Smells hop forward, hints of mellow citrus with no real malt character to speak of. The taste is alright, once again being dry hopped you get a mouth full of refreshing hop character that is kind of muted by a bit of toasted malt. Mouthfeel is thin and watery,but crip and refreshing. Good for tipping back a few, but hurts this brew on its score. Good offering but a little expensive."
" ~ This is a mild red ale that started out looking and smelling perfect. I'm a bit disappointed with the flavors offered. This beer seems to be a sessionable one based on the taste and feel."
"quite drinkable. i prefer a few others out there, but this simply stellar. there are many hoppy brews out there and not all are IPAs etc. this is a nice extension of the spectrum. cheers!"
"Pours a reddish brown color body, huge head, creamy and very lasting. 50oz pour. Very bitter aroma, some malty sweetness. Malty sweet taste, with some bitterness too. Some citrus. Pretty tasty, and very bitter. Less biter as it warms, but still good, not caustic or nasty as some beers get."
"D: This is a great red ale, it catches you off guard because its very heavy on the hops, a bit more extreme take on the style... really good brew from rogue!"
"This isn't my favorite red ale, as I do prefer a stronger mouthfeel and less hops in this style of beer, but I would recommend others give this beer a try. I would order it again, given the opportunity."
"this is a good example of red ale, for me."
"D- The metallic phenolic taste was very off-putting at first. I found that as the beer warmed up more this flavor wasn't as much in the forefront. I'm going to assume this was just a bad batch and try it again sometime. Otherwise this is a delicious beer."
"I like this a lot, and it's exceptionally sessionable; really, I wish I had more than a twelve ounce bottle of this right now."
"This is a good beer that I will most certainly by again. Won't be tomorrow but I'm sure I will get a craving for it sometime in the future."
"Overall the oatmeal cookie malt and grapefruit hop don't mesh well for me."
"Future outlook: A good, but not great beer. I'd be happy to have this again, but probably won't make a special effort to seek it out."
"thine brew pours up a murky dark amber color with a decent off white head. excellent lacing. the nose is yeast, floral hops, sweet malts (oh I do love red malts). the taste is nice smooth floral hops, subtle sweet malts. light bodied and low carbo. A good smooth brew. Drank this baby over at Ms. Coop's house...tits!"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Medium bodied. Finishes crisp and actually quite clean. Low to moderate carbonation. The relatively low ABV lends itself to the drinkability. Not a bad brew and could be an excellent dinner brew with the right food pairings."
"I poured a bottle into a pint glass. The beer was amber red with large creamy head and some lacing. I thought it had a good hoppy sweet smell but found the taste to be a perfect mixture of bitterness with the caramel undertones. The 5% alcohol and subdued flavor made this a beer that everyone would enjoy. Truly a sessionable beer in my book with a light smooth mouth feel."
"Pours a dark red, with a good amount of head and ok lacing. Slightly spicy, hoppy scent. Taste is a very subdued, earthy malt, with a slight bitter finish. Very dry. Would probably be more suited to drinking with a meal than an evening of refreshment."
"Lighter than expected, but for a session beer very solid, easy drinker and should go well with american lunch or dinner, or a summer refresher, much better than your normal lawnmower beer, I would take this one."
"Strong scent of hops with a touch of honey and slight malt note. Strong hop taste with an initial sweet, honey like touch and finishes a tingly, bitter and dry. Drinks with a sticky texture. The hops hide the taste of alcohol but it should not go unnoticed."
"D - An admirable amber red ale... Solid in all regards and quite sessionable at 5.1% ABV... Not the best in class, but a brew that I would never shy away from in the future..."
"Verdict: A tasty, worthwhile endeavor by the brewer, but probably not something I'd actively seek out to drink on its own."
"Not really feeling this bottle. It's not bad but it's certainly not on par with some other Rogue offerings. I don't mind quaffing a bomber (especially at the low ABV) but certainly wouldn't be reaching for another as my first choice."
"This makes a really interesting contrast to an English amber ale, not any less sweet, but considerably more dry and bitter. Personally I find it less drinkable than good English ambers, but still an tasty and interesting beer."
"A deep amber color, with a large substantia; three inch head on top. The head laces slowly, leaving hints of its creamy color along the way. A malty fragrance at first scent, then a strong citrusy scent, that is strong on the lemony side. A touch of pine and grass finishes off every scent. The malt is particularly all the way through, its prescence never seems to leave your palate. A mild bitterness comes in the end, that is grassy, bringing a grassy aftertaste. The feel very thin at the front, slowly gainsweight and becomes a light medium bodied fell at the end. The look and smell of this beer are truly at a high standard. The taste and the feel, the taste being the most important, seem to be lacking. Those aspects bring this beer down."
"The beer has light-medium carbonation and mouthfeel."
"D - At 5.1%, with reasonable carbonation, low bitterness, and a great mouthfeel this is a pretty terrific session brew. It's not Nugget Nectar, but it's a solid Red Ale."
"The taste is more malty than hops but it has some well defined bitterness. The malts are very sweet and can be compared again to caramel. The mouthfeel has a slick feel to it but it is a bit too watery. It drinks very easily."
"Dry hopped version. A pretty beer: cherry amber color, thick tan head, some lacing. Not much aroma, faint floral and biscuity malt. Fruit taste, apple and maybe a little cherry. Hops definitely present, and I think a little on the unpleasant side of sharp.. A so-so beer."
"My first ""meh"" beer from Rogue - it's decent and drinkable, but nothing particularly interesting."
"Dry Hopped Red Ale is damn good beer. Very solid all-around. I think it lacks a little in depth, but does have enough flavor to more than hold its own. I'm still intrigued by the ""dry hopped"" labeling. Is that a new thing? I don't know. In any event, this is a very good beer that's well worth checking out."
"D-Every one of Rogue Ales beers is a little differnt from the last,I just can't get enough!"
"Now to the beer. It's got a nice appearance, not quite red, but almost beyond brown. The head did have some hints of a dark red. The smell was nice. The taste was not very hoppy, but enough to balance a nice nutty flavor offered by the malts. I'm tasting walnuts. The taste diminishes smoothly and leaves a mellow refreshing aftertaste. I could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"D- Could drink this all day long. Nothing too interesting about it, but a solid brew none the less."
"M/D: Medium to full bodied, slightly over carbonated but nothing too bad. Good drinkability. This one could be put down one after another all night. Pretty solid brew."
"Red-amber color, nothing descriptively inadequate about the name, on the whole clear, full and lingering head without much lacing. Invasively hoppy nose of bitters, grains, grass, cabbage, mixed white citrus, does consciously present a malty side, the lack of fruit scents contributes to its arid presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, stern like a governmental bureaucrat, understands what you want, throws up a wall of impassivity so you never can guess ahead if you will get it. Touch of pine resin, raw dough and yeasts, uncooked oatmeal, following up on the nose, the malts appear to be used exclusively as counter-balance. Dry, and at times bitter, goes for a certain style and damn you if you don't like it. Keeps its foot on your neck way past the finish. If you like super-intensive hops this may be worth the excursion."
"Quite hoppy--from initial sip to the finish. Good long aftertaste. This has the body of skim milk with an appropriate amount of carbonation. This is a very easy bees to drink."
"D-Very drinkable brew. Based on the information on the bottle, I thought this was very similar, if not exactly the same as Santa's Private Reserve. I think this is slightly less agressive, and not nearly as pretty, but is a great beer in its own right."
"D= great for a party, probably incredible on-tap"
"Blood red in color with pillowy off white head that creates beautiful powder lacing down the sides. A rich aroma of hops, dark fruit, and some biscuits without the butter. Medium-heavy body with fleeting carbonation. The brew makes its bed on the tongue and takes a nap for a while. Biscuit dough taste with some pepper, caramel, toffee, and heavy malt. This is a milky concoction for the fall-winter season and would accompany meat dinners very well such as a piece of steak or burger."
"Thick fluffy, pillowy head laces the wide mouth heavy. Awesome aroma of fresh, wet hops, thick, spicy sweet malt, and maple syrup. Smooth on the tongue, with a solid malt foundation to support some of the most vibrant hops I've sipped since Sierra Nevada Harvest/Chico Estate. Beautifully balanced, with a sappy, toffee body keeping an eye on the sticky bitterness. This ale also captures a bit of the ""tang"" commonly found in reds. The super hopped red is qucikly becoming one of my favorite styles; a treat for hop lovers at a session ABV."
"D - On the hoppy side but still very easy to drink."
" Nice dry bitter finish."
"Medium mouthfeel very drinkable."
"Dry-hopped version. Pours clear ruby with a moderate cream-colored head. Aroma of citrus, fruit, and hops. Malty charachter with some hops and a little fruit sweetness. Very little carbonation, with a medium to heavy mouthfeel. This tastes a lot like Mendocino's Red Tail Ale, but with more hops."
"Very good nose on the beer. Pours an expected reddish, amber color with a small head. Malty taste with a tad bit of hops. Taste strikes me as a bit unspectacular but mouthfeel gets creamier as it warms and a chocolaty note comes through. Average brew that falls short of my expectations set by other Rogue beers that I've had in the past."
"Overall, this is really not anything impressive, but it was not unenjoyable. It is an ok brew, and with a few adjustments this could be a good representation of the style. It is actually, there is just some oddness to it that makes it a bit abrasive. I certainly wouldnt turn this one down, but I wouldnt pay bar prices for it, and wont be purchasing another bomber. Give it a shot. It aint too bad."
"Reviewed 4/12/08, updated 7/17/08. Bottle. Poured a dark brown/amber in color with a thick tan head. Aroma of flowery hops. Flavor predominantly caramel malt, flowery hops, lemon and wheat. Slight tartness. Goes down smooth. I enjoyed this beer a lot--gotta love that dry-hopping! 7/4/9/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"St. Rogue Red from Rogue Ales Brewery / Brewer's on the Bay is reddish amber in color and has a malt and hop nose. I really like these dry-hopped beers. Tastes great and reminds me of a hoppier version of American Amber Ale. Starts malty and finishes hoppy and somewhat dry. As I've stated in other reviews, I find the Rogue brand quite tasteful with a unique flavor. Best of all is that several Rogue beers are available here in the jungles of Alabama."
"A big floral beer that is very different from anything I have tasted before. Very nice and enjoyable. Almost oak like in character to some degree."
"About to drink the rest of the bottle with some grilled lamb and vegies right now!"
"A bic lighter popped the top of this 12oz bottle. I put my nose to the top and got a hit of pepper spice. Poured the dark red fluid into my glass and again put my nose to the top - but this time to a half inch head. Smells like fresh caramel. Tastes like a nicely balanced red ale with no uncomfortable elements and a after taste just like how it first hit my lips. Ya. After a Victory Hop Wallop, this is a great chaser. I picked some good beers for myself tonight so I'm chillin."
"Overal decent beer."
"Very much a ""west coast"" American red ale. Not to be confused with the Irish reds and the like. It's dry-hopped, and tastes of malt, followed by fruit and fairly strong, piney hops flavors. Could be the most hopped ""red"" ale I've sampled. Makes me curious what their ""India Red Ale"" is like under the Tracktown Label, or their ""Imperial Red"" in the swingtop bottle. If I had 15 dollars to spend on one beer, I'd know."
"This beer was light on the taste buds and had a crisp feel. Very drinkable, but I wouldnt go out of my way to have more (of course that means if its there, I wouldnt say no...)."
"Color is a beautiful clear mahogany, and head is fairly thick if not too persistent. Aroma is strong and richly hoppy, though not ""evergreen-ish."" Flavor is delightfully hoppy and only a little bitter, with nutty and fruity hints and even a touch of smoke. Texture is exceptionally smooth so it goes down very pleasantly. Another winner from Rogue."
"D: Great beer nice flavor"
"Overall, this is a great, clean, refreshing beer by Rogue. Nothing extreme, but definitely one I will be seeking out again."
"Could be an old beer, though I've seen dustier on that shelf at Goodrich's. But dissappointing -- especially after such a tease as that beautiful, unique head."
"D - This reminds me of an IPA with the citrus & hops aftertaste."
"Drinkability is top-notch here. It's also low in alcohol and would make a great session beer. The fact that it's available in six packs, makes it even more accessible, since the bombers are expensive."
"Got this one on tap at the Big Hunt with the waitress calling it a Rogue Hop Red - had to meander up to the bar to figure out what was actually going on. I really enjoyed this one, much better than I remember it being out of the bottle. A ton of malt makes this one fairly unique for most American Ambers (which seem to basically be slightly spicier, maltier IPAs). This one almost fell into maybe an imperial oktoberfest or something (wouldn't that style be something). Also had a ton of huge fruit aromas and flavors, including a ton of raisins and peaches. Excellent appearance, with a huge floaty head and incredible lacing. Body is likewise incredibly thick and creamy, a definite surprise for the style. Really liked it, and would get it again."
"D: A pretty good Rogue beer -- however, pretty good is below the usual level for this exceptional brewery. I like the mellower character, but more body from a heavier malt load would be welcome."
"This is a nice version of a red. Very drinkable, poured a nice golden-amber head. Nice hop taste and slight hoppy aroma for only 44 IBUs. A well-balanced beer, one of my favorite Rogues. I like the story about Fukutsuru, the bull for which the beer is dedicated."
"Tastes of hop bitterness (some spice), sweet malts and a nice hop bite at the finish."
" Overall, very nice for a hop-bomb red."
"A nice beer and a fine example of a red ale, even if it doesn't really stand out. I'd gladly revisit this again if the opportunity presents itself."
"Drinkability - overall a decent brew. something different and worth trying. not my top Rogue beer. Could be a bad or old bottle"
"D: It was good but I wasn't overly impressed."
"I really, really liked this beer. It's nothing too complicated, but could become one of my favorite session beers."
"D- Not too bad but there was just something different about this brew. Probably not something I'll go hunting for."
"A very deceiving ale. The aroma indicated a malt dominated brew, but the flavor was just about all citrusy bitterness. I was expecting a heavier, more balanced ale, but was pleasantly surprised by the light-bodied crisp bitterness."
"D: Well, I wouldn't have more than one anyways."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with reddish highlights. There's a nice half inch of head that sticks around for awhile. Smell is piney hops, but an abundance of malts. There's not enough hops to stand up to the roasted malt flavor. Medium mouthfeel and creamy taste."
"The smell is slightly malty with some distant hop aroma. You get a floral aroma and some graininess. Faint caramel smell hits the nose. The taste is malty up front with the dry hoppiness on the finish. You also get some of the roasted caramel in the finish as well. In the mouth it is well carbonated but not a lot going on. Overall a really good amber from the boys at the beach."
"Unclear garnet body, with a moussy amber head that reduces to a lingering film with coarse lacing. Aroma is big hops. Piney, resiny, grapefruit, with some earthy/woody undertones. The hops are underlined by some dark fruit from crystal malt, creating a berryish smell. Flavour is sweet, again heavy American hop, dry hop crispness, but not overly bitter. Malt comes through at the end, some nutty Munich notes, and a nice hit of berry from the crystal. Mouthfeel is nice and full, lightened by prickly carbonation. Perfectly balanced, wonderful, and refreshingly innovative. I'm starting to think Rogue bombers might be worth their exhorbitant price out here."
"There will be no writing home about this beer. It's a good example of dry hopping as the hops are really the only flavor that is really noticeable. It's not a bad session beer, but I probably won't be buying it again for a while."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright amber color with a magnificent light tan, chunky head. Great lacing left along the pint glass. Smells of citrus, spicy malts, hop spice. Taste is nothing extraordinary but extremely balanced and very enjoyable. Biscuity malts, balanced out with citrusy hops. Good slightly dry, hoppy finish although slight taste of metal is prevalent. Medium bodied, good carbonation. Excellent session brew."
"Drinkability: Very easy-going, given its thinness and muted flavors. It's refreshing though, and would be nice on a summer day when you're looking for something hoppy but not too heavy."
"D- overall a good red ale probably worth a try."
"The beer was a medium amber and had a slightly tan head. The aroma was slightly fruity but made the thick body evident. The falvor was T H I C K and hung around for some time. This isn't one to guzzle down several at a time. Order one and savor it."
"M/D: Overall this is a good beer. It leaves a mild bitter aftertaste, but not so much that it turns you off to the beer. The beer is thick and creamy. Good carbonation level. This is a beer that I would pick up every so often."
"St. Rogue Red is a very fine American Amber."
"I am a big fan of Rogue, and this is not bad. I don't like this as much as some of theirs, but worth a try."
"D: Very nice and easy. Would make a great session beer if not for the price. Would not seek out again but a good everyday drinker."
"D - Easy to drink and a great example of an American Red."
"D: An interesting take on the style.This has been an interesting general style to experiment with, and has been an enjoyable journey. I don't know if it is intriguing enough to be aregular selection, but certainly worth a try."
"D - I respect the effort for this beer, but there isn't enough malt to justify the intense hoppiness. Mouthfeel is all wrong too; I'll probably have trouble finishing this glass. I doubt I'll buy this again unless curiousity gets the better of me in the future."
"D: Doesn't seem like it would fill you up too quickly, and it's actually a very refreshing beer to drink. The alcohol content is just right if you want to put down 2 or so and still drive. A nice job all around!"
"As for the flavor, it delivers a near-perfect balance of caramel & amber malts alongside a piney hop note. Not too sweet or bitter, just well-crafted deliciousness from Rogue. Mouthfeel is light, with a creamy body and excellent carbonation. Resinous, earthy hops give St. Rogue Red a bitter finish. Pairs well with pasta & red sauce. This brew is the epitome of the American Amber style, and one I highly recommend."
"Very drinkable/enjoyable beer. Hop dominated, as expected from the dry hopping, but balanced nicely by the malt so as not to make it overpowering."
"Pours a deep copper/amber with a copper tinted white head that hangs around a decent amount of time. Head gives way to light and spotty lacing. Smells of hops as one may guess. A little bready aroma comes through on a deeper draw. It tastes really good for a red ale. The hops are a bit more pronounced than I would have thought but are not overwhelming. Light and creamy mouthfeel that's very easy to drink. Another winner from Rogue."
"sorry for the quick overview...gotta run ;-)"
"The beer pours a very dark red with a nice finger head, and it has a good head retention. The beer has a very floral hoppy nose to it with a sweet malty undertone. This beer has an interesting flavour. It has a nice sweet malty flavour that reminds me of syrupy fruits to it. The hops aren't much in the flavour; however, it's pretty bitter at the end of the tasting. It's a bit too sweet for me though, but it's very balanced. The mouth feel is a bit creamy. I could probably only drink a few of these."
"All in all, not bad, but not great either. Good taste and drinkablility, but not a beer I would go out of my way for."
"This beer is okay, but not what I expected. I guess I just didn't expect to be so sweet given the ""dry-hopped"" title, and generally expect reds/ambers to have a toasty malt flavor rather than a super-sweet one. This one's average IMO, as far a Rogues go."
"If there's any criticism, this beer really suffers from not being fresh, and Rogue doesn't do a great job of letting you know how fresh their beer is. Find a purveyor that turns over their beer and pick up a bottle."
"Overall a good beer-nothing spectacular."
"D - Overall, a good beer, but there are many better dry-hopped reds (Red Horse from Sac Brew immediately comes to mind)."
"pours a slightly cloudy med-copper color with a thick off-white head which lasts for an eternity than coats my nonic entirely ; a strong citrus hop aroma with some cereal and darker grains in the mix ; a good initial hop bite and flavor that quickly peters out leaving a more subtle bread and nuts, a little thin on the flavor, finishes crisp and slightly mineral ; a light body made creamier by the great amount of co2 (popped the top w/ a lighter & shot it over 20 ft.) ; a pretty drinkable beer but not quite flavorful enough to stand out..."
"Prosit MK"
"D: I enjoyed drinking this beer and I will enjoy the other three that I have, but I am not sure that I would ever buy this beer again, for it is not anything to write home about. It is one of the more mediocre beers from Rogue, which brews some pretty amazing stuff."
"Dry hopped Red. Deep reddish amber with an enduring tan cap. Leafy hop aroma with hints of pine is overshadowed by apricot-like fruity esters. Begins with a bubbly rush of toasty malt, which is restrained in its sweetness and quickly becomes a bit astringent as the hops come in. A pithy citric punch towards the finish ends any malt sweetness for a snappy, clean finish. Nice restrained dried fruit malt flavors integrate well with some classic NW hop notes. One of Rogue's leaner beers, this would make a nice session. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and overcarbonated, but an agressive pour and a little foaming helps this settle. One of Rogue's best brews."
"Overall, an OK beer, but the relative lack of balance will probably keep me from buying this again any time soon."
"D- Goes down well for such a heavy-bodied brew"
"M&D: It's light-to-medium bodied with average levels of carbonation and a slightly watery/silky smooth mouthfeel. The finish is only lightly drying--not what I would expect from a dry hopped beer such as this. It's fairly drinkable because of the body and interesting flavor. St. Rogue Red is a good representation of the style, and if I cared for it more, I'd buy it frequently."
"Smooth with plenty carbonation that fits the beer nicely, but otherwise a little watery in the mouth. Not bad. Plenty drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is crisp with medium heaviness. I probably wouldn't want more than one or two in a sitting, due to the high bitterness."
"This is a solid beer. It's an interesting take on an American Amber, and will appeal to hopheads and fans of the style alike."
"This was an impressive beer, and one I'll certainly enjoy again. It did cost a couple dollars more than most of Rogue's other offerings, but was worth it."
"D: Very good. Pretty tasty but light in body and smooth enough in feel for it to go down easy. If this were cheaper I'd buy it all the time."
"12 oz. single from Total Wine"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, I was unsure of what to expect of this beer but was very pleasantly surprised to find that I liked it quite a bit. This is a beer that I could drink for a whole evening."
"Drinkability- Strong stomachs need only apply. If you got one, you'll probably enjoy it. Otherwise a touch too harsh for a lightweight like me. Although I secretly did kinda enjoy it. Guess I enjoy the pain?"
"A wonderful bouquet rich in malt, hops and grains. This translated directly to the taste, which is initially bold on the tongue. The hops lend a delicate back taste that is complex. The body on this is sublime allowing for the complexity of this brew to shine through. This, like all of Rogue's beers is tasty. This is a fine sippin' beer that, again like all of John's beers, I will be enjoying again and again!!!"
"Drinkability> Fab for one, but I'm just not man enough to have more than one."
"I'm a big fan of Rogue and I liked this beer quite a bit."
"Drinkability is good, its thinner mouthfeel makes it easy to drink and nothing on this one is played to the extreme. A very solid beer in need of a little tweaking (and a freshness date)."
"Pours transluscent maroon with a fizzy beige head. Smell is metal and tea scented malts. Taste is like malty tea with some gooey sprucey caramel. Kind of a hibiscus tea hop flavor, and gummy bear fruitiness in the finish with a nice bitterness. Medium bodied and nice carbonation. Tastes better than it smells, but could be an old bottle as I picked it up in Vegs. Not bad, and a hoppy amber for sure."
"Overall, a fairly drinkable brew. Not the greatest example of an amber ale, a little unbalanced to the malty side, but still pretty decent."
"Pours out a deep caramelized hazel with a few, lazy, small bubbles making their way to the top of a thin head that leaves some scattered lacing. Aroma is rich and malty (reminiscent of a bock) with toasted grains and a heavy raisin and date presence. I pick up a touch of apple too. Flavor is a mix of fruity esters, dark, dried fruits, chewy, caramel malts, toffee, honey, bread, and some citric hops. Flavor tends to fade out a bit, however, in the finish in a seltzery way. Mouthfeel is solid all around and has a decent weight to it. The carbonation could be a little more relaxed for my tastes. Good drinker all around and a great example of an amber ale. After a while, though, I'd probably want to switch to something else."
"If red ale were all this good, I would quickly add it to my growing stable of favorite styles. Until that's the case, I can easily sate myself with Brian Boru and Rogue's St. Rogue Red. It's terrific."
"I wouldn't get this again. After the first glass I may pour out the rest of my bottle so my stomach has room for a tastier brew."
"This brew surprised me. It pours a nice amber hue. Sparse cap, but plenty of lacing. Smell is a bitter floral hop punch. Grass. Taste is a hop punch, which gets somewhat muted by a strong malt secondary. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp. A very drinkable brew. I loved it."
"A drinkable and full-flavored brew. Another quality offering from the folks at Newport, Oregon. I would have this again for sure."
"Overall impression: A highly balanced, highly drinkable Amber Ale. Probably the classic West Coast version of the style. Recommended."
"Pours into my pint glass a clear, slightly brown amber, with a thick foamy off white head. Aroma is very hoppy, as expected, a bit of malty sweet tucked in the back. Taste is initially very hoppy but fades and allows a pleasing light caramel malty flavor to peek through. Mouthfeel seems a bit chewy, lighter in body. Drinkability is quite good. The high level of aroma hops make this beer come off initally like a hop bomb, but it seems more bark than bite. A bit more malt sweetness would be nicer, but it's still preety good. RIP Fukutsuru! =)"
"Had on tap; once settled it had a dark red appearance with a thin head through most of the drinking. The smell was of faint aromas of some spice and citrus. I liked the taste: sweet and light with the malt. The beverage had a medium body which allowed the malty-citrus flavors to be more enjoyed than a bitterish rush to the head. Overall, pretty good."
"Review from notes. Poured into my Rogue pint glass. Coppery-brown with a tan head that leaves nice lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, with a nice spicy and floral Centennial hop aroma. Taste is very similar, with toasty malt cut through by hoppiness, although here the hops take on more citrus character. There's also an awful metallic note here that throws everything off. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry but the metal hurts the drinkability."
"D - This is an average beer. Not totally bad but I had higher hopes for this one. Given the other choices from Rogue, I will probably not seek this one out again."
"I really dig this beer, though it's way hoppier than I usually like my amber ales. A great Rogue beer."
"Overall a good, solid amber ale. Not my favorite, but definitely worth a try. If I found a 6 pack, I might pick it up again. I probably won't run out and buy another bomber immediately."
"This is one is hard to put a label on. One half IPA and the other half a nut brown ale. Great compliment to dinner. Not my favorite, but worth getting again for something a litle different."
"Drinkability - Decent drinkability, nothing special though."
"D - Good beer with an ABV that allows you to enjoy a brew with out worrying if it will sneak up on you."
"650 ML purchased for $5.99 from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... ""Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red Ale"" on the logo... pours a very impressive copper-brown appearance with attractive frothy and foamy head that lingered on for a bit... smell was what was expected from an American Amber of Rogue quality... repelete with strong hops... back logo pays homage to ""Chinook and Centennial Hops""... the taste is above and beyond for the category, and even with the modest 5.1% ABV, this brew packs quite a flavorful punch, that is first noticed with a clean, clear, distinct red aroma... flavor was oustanding... slightly bitter, but pleasing, with hops, caramel, slight vanilla... tastte really hit home on this one, and Rogue did well with this particular sample, creating an excellent depiction of the style with a creamy, rich, and thick mouthfeel and good drinkability... alcohol was not noticed at all, and this beer was dominated by oustanding fresh flavors that really stood out... An awesome Rogue brew... Recommended..."
"I've had other offerings from Rogue; their I2PA Imperial India Ale is superb! This one just flat out misses for me."
" This one falls way short. Bad recipe I think. I'm a hop freak, but there should be some balance."
"Drinkability: I don't know if the old version was dry-hopped or not, but I don't remember this brew being this good last time I had it. The presence of the hops make it a better beer than just one that's balanced and one that could be a session."
"Pours a clear amber that is dark. Creme head leaves a lot of lacing on the way down. Nose is a lot of piney hops. Perfume tones. Citric edge. Flavor is oddly chalky in a way. I get an aftertaste of pecans or walnuts. It takes some time, but it hits in a wave and then dies down. Unfortunately, after that first hit, there isn't really the same level of character. But there is a hearty bitter and earthy profile. Lots of complexities here, but a fairly odd combination and more earthy than anything. A robust red. Smooth feel with a nice carbonation and a good liquid tone as well. Easily drinkable. A nice hearty ale."
"Pours a clean copper/ amber color with an off-white head. In the aroma, sweet piney, and dry hops. In the taste, sweet maltiness and a sweet sweet dry hopped end. A small bite in a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small sweet malt and dry hopped aftertaste. A nice dry hop. Hoppy, yet still malty, smooth, and balanced."
"D: Pretty good."
"Drinkability is pretty good, like this beer. One of the best ambers I've had lately in my string of amber tastings. I love how the dry-hopping helps bring a lot of flavor without amping up the ABV, although it's best fresh."
"I love hoppy beer and this was no exception. There were hops present throughout the experience but nothing that was overpowering or sharp. A nice smooth base ale, perfectly accented with earthy flavorful hops. Great ale!"
"i can't really complain though. this was still very drinkable."
"This is an average beer and one of the weakest of the Rogue line. It's particularly upsetting coming from such an outstanding brewer. But then, this is a far more approachable beer than some other Rogue brews. This can appeal to a wider audience and is a more everyday drinking brew than, say, Old Crustacean."
"Pours a nice red/amber color, with a bit of head and lacing. Excellent scent, very hoppy with an excellent floral scent. Nice taste, again, very hoppy, but almost too much, it was difficult for me to detect much else. Goes down fine, but it is a rather dry beer. It would not be good at quenching a thirst. Not my favorite Rogue at all, but it's good."
"Had this on-tap (though it was called Rogue Dry-Hopped Red). Very hazy reddish amber color with a thin head. Left walls of lacing all down the glass so that I couldn't see through the glass. Pretty astounding. Hops absolutely dominate the smell. There is some caramel there, but the hops want you to know that they're in charge. Taste is an unbalanced showcase of hops, though still quite enjoyable. Hops are both citrusy and piney, which is a wonderful combination. Finish is quite dry and leaves me wanting more. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, though carbonation is adequate."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle. Poured a hazy, somewhat dark amber red color, that had beautiful garnet highlights. The beer was topped off by a thick, pillowy, tannish white two finger head, that had great retention. Plenty of thick gobs of sticky lace were left behind as the head slowly faded. Thick juicy hop aromas were most present in the nose, along with some sweet crystal malt, orange peel, and some grapefruit teamed up with a bit of pine. A small underlying yeast aroma was also present. Not a bad start. A good amount of flavor was packed into this as well. Plenty of bittering hops out front, surpisingly tamed by the big sweet malt, more of the citrus zest that was noted in the nose, and an almost tobacco like flavor in the background. I expected this ""Dry Hopped"" beer to be quite a bit hoppier, but was actually pretty balanced in my opinion. Not a drop of noticeable alcohol here. Plenty of carbonation. Head a somewhat thick, medium to full bodied mouthfeel, and was very crisp and clean. Great drinkability. Another winner from Rogue!"
"Over all very decent beer. I would be happy to buy this again."
"D: I like this brew a lot. Has some imperfections but it just does it for me."
"The taste again is very one dimensional. A big dose of hops without the malt profile to balance it out. I do like hops so I like the flavor but it is far from being as good as it could be. Feels medium bodied with good carbonation. The hops make this far from a quaffable beer to me."
"Sampler at San Francisco Rogue Public House - dry hopped version. I donÂt know what the regular version is like, but the dry-hopped is a standout. Amber body and white head. Extremely floral nose - you can smell this one from quite a distance. Its one of the most enticing aromas I've experienced. Wonderful dry hoppy taste, bursting with citrus and berries, echoing the perfect nose. Crisp and refreshing palate. Great stuff!"
"Creamy and smooth in texture with lower carbonation and a medium body. The mouthfeel overall is bright but still buttery. Very palatable. The abv is modest so it works as a nice session brew and the balanced, flavorful nature keeps you interested. Very well done. Certainly an interesting rendition of the style."
"D: Very balanced beer. This is how I enjoy my American reds. There is lots of hop bitterness but the malts carry it so that it is not harsh. This would be a nice beer to enjoy all night."
"Creamy head, off-white, mostly lasting head. Clear, brown color. Moderately hoppy with flowers, grass, abnd orange. A malty aftertaste followed by some hoppiness after that. A pretty good beer. Soft carbonation and dry texture. I can't remember where I had this."
"Not much else to say; pretty good brew but could use more body and malt flavor to tie everything together... pretty good drinkability despite what I consider flaws."
"Poured a nice red amber color. Lacing all the way down the glass, a nice looking beer. Taste is very toasty with nice malts but really lacking in hop flavor. I expected more hoppiness. I would recommend brutal bitter over this one. A little thin on the palate and no kick with the alcohol..A decent brew but not one I will be reaching for in the future."
"D: Can't say I really like this one at all. The flavor just isn't there. If this were better, I could see it being a great session beer because it's not too overpowering from a flavor or alcohol standpoint. Doubt I'll be drinking it again, though."
"The body is lighter than I expected, but tastes of roasted malts and has a grainy texture. Hops are slightly present, but are more earthy than anything. This is a good beer but nothing special. It's lighter than I expected but then again, it's good as a transition beer for the novice BA."
"Drinkability - I like it, but I'm a hop-head."
"Very light brown head that disappears quickly and leaves thin sticky lacing. Sweet smell. Hints of caramel. Good smooth taste goes down easy and tastes malty sweet. Enjoyable earthy flavor. Roasted malt palate with a hint of hops lingering afterward."
"D: A good beer, not a great one, I was expecting more out of this one, but still drinkable. Might not have again at the price, but a solid red ale."
"D - Pretty complex red ale with big, earthy and herbal hops and a bitterness that sticks to the tastebuds. This is a hopped up version of a red ale that's not my favorite Rogue offering, but pretty good nonetheless."
"got a bomber of some st rogue here, pours a very dark amber color, has a really beautiful look to it, nice frothy head that has some lacing. smell is good too, smells like carmal and malt, with some mild hop scents as well, i almost detect like a cinnamon apple scent too, lots of different flavors in the nose on this one. taste is good, but not as complex as the smell. first has a bitterness to it, then finished with a smoother malty taste. for being dry hopped the hops really dont come out to me as much as other dry hopped beers that i've had. mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is decent. not a great beer, but better than your average beer."
"Bought a bomber of this from the Portland brewup and split it with my good friend kboett77. All-in-all, a pretty good session beer with a higher hop content. I gave it straight 4's because it's better than average, although not exceptional. Pours a clear, luscious red with a white head. Good retention and carbonation. A bit of bite on the tongue from the fizz and the hops. Good malty center, with a stepped-up hop content. The hops are citrusy and bitter. Great for someone who is a hophead and likes a good red ale. I'll probably return to this one in the future."
"Pours dark brown with a big off-white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is big citrusy and spicy hops- dry hopped after all. Dark sweetness. Taste is balanced between sweet caramel maltiness and citrusy hops. Residual sweetness with fruit notes. Not very bitter. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. Nice overall amber ale. The dry hops work surprisingly well in this beer."
"D - it's better than some amber ales, but far from the best."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange, thick off white head, nice lacing, settles to a thick layer. Smell is sweet, caramel, light pine and floral hops, touch of citrus, bit of tea, bready, nice aroma. Taste is caramel, piney hops, floral, tea, malty bread middle, nice balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Nice beer to session with, goes down easy. Thanks for picking up Lexx!"
"Great mouthfeel. Finish coats the tongue, next sip gives it a fresh start. Highly drinkable. I made a night out of most of the 6-pack, and saved this one for reviewing. As usual, another strong offering from Rogue. I think this is one of their better session-ish beers."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In my opinion this beer is a little on the light side for mouthfeel. Carbonation is medium-high but doesn't get in the way. Finishes with a slightly slick feeling on the palate. The brew also has a very clean finish. This is a brew I'd not be opposed to buying again, in fact it is a very nice American Red. Though I've not had all that many of this style I'd have to say that this one goes down as one of my favorites so far (Santa's Private Reserve from Rogue was also great). Being a hop head I really like the grassy and floral hops from the dry hopping as well as the balance that this beer has to offer. The only qualm I've with this brew is its mouthfeel, just a bit more body and I'd be sold."
"I didn't get a chance to try the regular St. Rogue Red but I'm guess I missed out because I am sure this beer would be good even without the dry hopped bitterness and aroma."
"D: Very easy to drink and tasty. I'll be buying more."
"I expected more hops in this one. To me, the caramel presence was stronger."
"D - If you're a fan of the hops this is surely one to try. I found it to be very satisfying and close to the top of it's class for the style. I would suggest trying a bomber if you've never had it..or revisiting it if you have"
"Light bodied, overcarbonated, and astringent in the end. ABV seems pretty low, low enough for this to be sessionable. I wouldnt sit through more than about three of these though. I am on the fence whether or not to recommend this one. Ill jump off the fence and say pass on this one."
"Decent stuff, but it didn't deliver what the looks and smell promised."
"Overall, an interesting amber ale, with plenty more hop flavors to it than other examples. My only complaint is about the way the flavors don't seem to weave together that well at first."
"Same copper color, tan head with largish bubbles on top, tighter foam below. Aroma's much hoppier, these are less floral and more citric than before. The flavor is well attenuated and quite bitter for style, putting the hops right on display. The mouthfeel is full even with the high carbonation. I almost never get six packs, but I did for a party not long ago, and I drank all of them without sharing. I love the new St. Rogue. Aroma, Flavor, and Mouthfeel scores have all been upped a point, drinkability up a half."
"Could drink an average amount of this, kind of heavy and high in alcohol"
"This beer pours a hazy dark ruby color. The head is small and reddish-pink. Lacing is decent. The aroma is of caramel, grapefruit, tangerine, and just a whif of cocoa. The taste leans a little towards the sweet side, but is fairly balanced. It is of caramel, with grapefruit in the background and a touch of pine in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I would drink it again."
"ItÂs not very often you see a label on a brew noting Âdry hoppedÂ for a Red Ale, unless yah brewing yourself and you do this action to increase that hop aroma. Well after having a taste of this brew, I just did not get any good emotion. There was plenty of sediment at the bottom, so be aware. Ok thereÂs a smidgen of hop scent at first sniff, ok so thatÂs a good thing. Not sure if itÂs the Chinook, Centennial or both in the batch during the dry hop. Anyway, I do not want to be long in text and drag this out. Rouge makes better beer than this. I need this on draft to compare the two Â bottom line, it was just ok. DonÂt get me wrong, maybe I got a sub par batch or maybe there was an elapsed shelf life. A little bitter in the mouth after having a sip or two Â like an ESB (which I would have preferred) vs. a red, but just not the malt/hop mix taste that I was looking for in a brew. IÂll look for another tasting opportunity if I can find it on draft. JC"
"D- I originally really liked this based upon the smell, but as I worked my way through the beer, I enjoyed it less and less. I wish this wasn't the case."
"D- This goes down pretty easy and is a decent brew but something about the mouthfeel makes it so I wouldnt want to drink a few."
"Overall, a good beer that is very enjoyable. Other than the price, i find it highly drinkable as the flavor is nice, but a bit simple. But if looking for a red ale, i think i will have to go for a red rocket."
"I'll probably try this from bottles now, this just became my favorite Rogue beer (good accomplishment with the many good beers they have)."
"Thanks for the bottle leftmindedrighty."
"Another great beer from Rogue. Give it a try! Btw, ABV is 6.2%."
"D-this is like an imperial red sort of thing. The fresh hops are really nice I just wish they factored more into the smell"
"The flavor was or roasted malts and semi sweet caramel and candied spices. This is the best red ale that I've tasted ever! Another winner from Rogue Ales."
"D: This is a really tasty beer and one that'll find it's way into my rotation fairly regularly. It's hoppy enough to make a hophead happy while providing a nice change of pace from an IPA."
"D - I was really pleased to find this at a restaurant because I've never been able to pick up a single bottle of it. This is a really good amber. One of the hoppiest I've ever had."
"Picked up a couple singles of this from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo. Poured a dark copperish red with a nice 1 finger tan head. Smell was malty with a caramel linger. Initial taste was sweet malt with a nice citrus splash and followed up with a slight hoppy bitter. Mouthfeel was nice and clean, but nothing extraordinary. Carbination was a little more than I prefer. Overall, a pretty solid red with great drinkability.(5.1 abv)"
"While this beer is not one I would consider a favorite, it was a very good beer. I would order it out sometime but it isn't one I could have more then once a sitting."
"This is a very nice beer. I've never had the regular version, but I think it's likely that the dry hopping is an improvement."
"Pours a dark amber tone, with a fluffy off-white head that laces well, and retains itself nicely. Aroma consists of citrus hops and a little malty sweetness as well. Taste begins with a pleasant, yet short-lived toasted malt flavor, that gives way to a generous but not overwhelming citrus hop flavor. Finish is somewhat dry with a lingering hop aftertaste. Medium body with nice carbonation makes this brew easy on the palate, and quite drinkable...a 6'er of this won't last long in my fridge. Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Great for a hot summer day... good for the hop fanatics too.... although there are far more hoppy beers out there. Recommended."
"Drinkability - awesome stuff for the hop lover. A fantastic session red."
"Deep red pour, white head that didnt last long. Nice mouthfeel, very tasty. A bit of citrus/fruit taste at the end. Good stuff. Excellent effort by the people at Rogue. I would definitely have again and I would recommend to everyone out there that hasnt experienced this beer."
"I had this alongside the dry-hopped version. I have to say that the dry-hopped version had a taste that this one just didn't reach. Still-in-all a good brew, with a heavy malt character."
"Drinkability - I'd like to know what the ABV is on this one. I'd definitely reach for it again. More like to see it around these parts than the two i previously mentioned."
"This is a nice beer; it really would be a good session beer for those who like a lot of hops, but want to drink a few more beers than a typical IPA would allow."
"notes-The flavor profile just doesn't do it for me. Well made as are all of the rogue brews I've tried, just not to my tastes."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours dark amber/brown with little off white head. Head is gone almost immediately. Medium sweet smell, with a hint of hops. Sweet caramel taste with i twinge of hops on the back end. Medium bodied with mild bitter after taste. Even with the medium weight, very drinkable and wish I had more on hand."
"Very drinkable, but the bitterness may shy some away from more than a bottle of this stuff, especially if they're expecting a Smithwick's"
"drinkability is very good, a very refreshing enjoyable beer."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Only got better as it warmed and more of the flavors stood out. Will be looking to have it again."
"Overall, it was a nice session beer, but I was expecting more of a kick. It's like the dried hops cut back the overall flavor and balance of the beer. It was a good beer and gorgeous to look at. It's definitely worth trying, but I don't see myself running to the store to get more - not my cup o' tea."
"I'm not the most seasoned of beer experts, but I'm also not a rookie. I really like this one - give it a try! One of my personal favorites."
"Very drinkable, a most refreshing brew that pleases the senses but does not assault them."
"This red ale is medium bodied and has a smooth lightly carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkability is high, I could easily pop another one of these when this one is done, and then perhaps another."
"I don't like this one enough to session it but if the flavor had been what the smell was, then this would be a top 100 beer."
"22 ounce bottle, served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber/red color with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like grassy and citrus hops, caramel, and toasted malt. At first it tastes like toasted malt and caramel, then has a nice hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium, but with a bit more carbonation than I'd like in this style of beer. Even then, the drinkability is still good. It goes down easy, and it's well balanced with good flavor. I could drink this as an occasional session beer. I'd recommend it to others to try. I like it."
"12 oz. bottle - hopped with Chinook and Centennial, dry-hopped with Centennial - served in a Sam Smith nonic. It pours an unfiltered rusty/copper with medium carbonation, and an inch of beige head that retains a thin blanket and leaves moderate lacing. The aroma is lightly vinous, with sweet/caramel malts, apricot, peach, and earthy/piney and grapefruit hops. On the palate there is a hoppy and malty earthiness, along with apricot, and toasted/caramel. The hop character is deep, imparting a medium bitterness, and notes of piney/green, citric, and tropical (mango, papaya) hops, on top of a medium, yet fairly full, drying body, that has medium carbonation and finish. Overall a very nice interpretation of an American amber - well-worth revisiting."
"I am not a large drinker of reds, but this is the best I have tasted, would have given it 5's had rogue not had so many other solid brews!"
"Rogue is always an interesting experience, but somewhat disappointing at times.."
"Overall an absolute hop bomb. Recommended for anyone who's looking for a fix."
"Poured a deep dark amber with a nice one inch off white head and a good amount of lace. Nice retention on the head as well. Smell was deeply hopped, with a nice pine resin aroma and a hint of light grain. My first impression was a bit light in the carbonation, and a slight slickness or oilyness to it. Big hop profile was very nicely balanced against the malted grain back. Overall this was an easily sessionable and highly enjoyable brew. Score another winner for the guys over at rogue."
"At first I kinda liked this (it looked cool), but as I dug into it I didn't find it very special. It somewhat bored me. I could drink a lot, but I can drink a lot of water, too...."
"Nice and thick. A ""real"" ale. But yet it's so smooth. No bitter bite at the end. This one's a keeper. Deep, dark, delicious."
"Overall an excellent beer, maybe two at the most to truly enjoy it in one sitting."
"A pretty cool red ale. Oddly I found the hops best came through while the beer was still chilled, so dont let it warm up too much. The malt profile was a nice mix of cream and caramel that got backed up by crisp citrus hops. The hops flavor wasn't overwhelming, but there was enough bitterness to put this red ale on par with some IPA's."
"Drinkability of this beer is high , not sure of the ABV, but it seems sessionable."
"I had this on tap at Yardhouse in Costa Mesa, CA. The color was a nice deep red. The head was nice and left thick lacing all the way down the glass. The taste was really, really great. I could easily have had several of these. I am going back for more ASAP!"
"This is good stuff but I want the same kind that I had from the Philly craft beer fest."
"Drinkability: Red ales don't always knock you out, but a good one like this makes a nice session brew."
"poured a dark amber/red. roasty, caramel-ly, bready, piney bouqet. this amber has much more piney hop presence than most amber/red ales. taste is dominated by the hops, no residual sugars from the malts to detect upfront, although there is a significant dry, roasty malt presence. the back end and finish are dominated by the hop astringency, making this amber/red more different than most. a tea-like astringency closes it out. mouthfeel is almost medium. for my taste, i would like a little more balance towards the malt end of the sprectrum for this style, but i do love the ibus in this beer."
"Drinkability"
"great look great smell great taste great beer. it's as simple as that. very nice hop prescence, awesome lacing. the lists go on. this was a really solid offering. finishes nice and dry with a sweet balance of malty goodness and dry hopped bite. really nice. my only concern is that i could see myself growing tired of this and looking for something a litle more refreshing."
"Mouthfeel is good. This is medium bodied and even though the hops leave some dryness there is a nice sweetness at the end to balance. I could go through quite a few of these and stay interested."
"Drinkability: Very sippable. There is a little bitterness, but it is not much of a detract. An overall good/borderline great Rogue offering."
"Overall impression: Solid, drinkable beer. Nice malty flavor. Both good, but I prefer the dry hopped version."
"I goo beer to be sure. Very similar to the dty hopped version with less hops(of course). Pours a dark amber, looks nice in the glass with a medium sized head. I didnt get a whole lot of aroma, bubt some hop and some sweetness in there. The flavor was also slightly hoppy with a little bit of bitterness and certainly some sweet almost citrus flavors. Not nearly as hoppy as the dry hopped version but that character is still there. Its a very smooth beer, My 22 oz seemed to just dissapear on me. A good red ale, one i would get again."
"actually, i was quite surpised by this beer - usually rogue's (non-stout, non-ceramic-bottled) ales are always above average, but never blow me out of the water. this one didn't exactly knock my socks off, but it was solid as anything, and something i would most certainly have again."
"Taste is upfront is of sweet and biscuity malt, giving way to some grapefruit and spicy hops along with a little fruit pressence. I think there is pretty decent balance here, maybe leaning a little towards the hops side but not overwelming. Mouthfeel is probably a tad more thin than one would want but its not too bad, and the carbonation is at a nice level. A very drinkable red and definitely one of the better that I have had. Another solid effort from the folks at Rogue."
"Very interesting, however."
"Drinkability is good a solid Red Ale. About on par for Rouge."
"D: Overall I really enjoyed this one. It is very balanced and refreshing. It is a great red ale, and actually reminds me of an Irish ale. St. Rogue Red is very sessionable, and I can't wait to try the dry hopped version."
"d - very interesting brew and one i would purchase again. rogue is always surprising me with their styles and this is no different. good change of pace beer."
"A thoughtful brew, but nothing you need to put much thought into. Overall a very nice little beer from Rogue."
"very Interesting stuff though"
"Drinkability- Pretty good. I really enjoyed how pleasantly different this beer was from what I expected (although I didn't get to enjoy with a $100 steak)."
"Dry Hopped St. Rogue Red isn't quite what I thought it was going to be. I pictured a solid red ale with a good hop kick. Unfortuanately the bitterness I was expecting just wasn't there. Still an enjoyable and extremely sessionable beer."
"D: One hoppy amber ale. Hops almost take too much away from the malt profile, but if you like 'em hoppy, you'll love this one. A nice offering from Rogue."
"D - It goes down well enough. I mean, there's nothing particularly disagreeable about it, but it's just not very inspired."
"Less hoppy/more malt balanced than other Rogues I've had, which I am a fan of. Earthy. Unfortunately this beer also does not share some of the good characteristics of many of its brethren, being not as substantive IMO -- feels a bit thin and lacks the complexity I tend to expect from them or a solid red ale. Too much fizz. Gets better as it goes on, so would get it again if the mood struck."
"Man, what an absolute disappointment. I bought this (22 oz. bomber) at 5.49 and I can honestly say that I couldn't even finish it. The dry hopping is evident, but the taste is non-existent. Tastes more like a macro-brewed IPA with no maltiness whatsoever. A big thumbs down for this Rogue Ale!"
"Pours a pretty deep red color with orange highlights, topped by an inch of creamy, off-white head. Aroma of sharp floral hops, mildly sweet caramel malt, and a slight metallic tinge. Palate is mostly floral hops up front, developing a more fruity edge towards the swallow. Some fairly sweet caramel malt balances out the bitterness of the hops. Body is smooth but a bit foamy at times. A tasty beer, definitely fit for a session or two, and a considerable step up from the regular St. Rogue Red."
"Poured appropriately into a Rogue pint glass a crisp amber color with a thin off white head that diminished quickly to a ring with a few bubble clusters in the middle. Aroma was a good blend of rich caramel malt and earthy hops, just a tad on the weak side, however. Taste was a wonderful balance of malts and hops. Deep caramel flavor in great harmony with pleasant piney hops. There is a greatly appropriate level of carbonation and the alcohol is very well hidden. The original St. Rogue Red had always been my least favorite Rogue beer available in six packs. I have to admit that this is a vast improvement and makes it one of my favorite Rogues."
"D: I got to be honest here, I was expecting a lot more. I wonÂt call it a let down butÂok, I will call it a let down. This could have been so much better IMO, especially from a brewery like Rogue. I guess I just found it a bit boring."
"What I like about this offering is the strong malt backbone that other Rogue beers lack. The house yeast flavour is there but a definite maltiness dominates the beer. I see this as a food friendly amber that has a definite west coast big mouthfeel. Nicely crafted"
"Pours a gorgeous deep dark reddish amber, with a bit of beige head, and not much in the way of retention or lacing. Smell is feint hops, a bit of malt sweetness; not a powerful but a pleasant nose. Taste is mild malt sweetness up front, then giving way to a hoppy bitterness, a bit of fruit and a hint of spice. Finishes dry and bitter. Not a bad red ale."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer that will satisfy many tastes. Quite impressive. Certainly would go with a lot of food and be a nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium. Smooth rounded texture."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Goes down like a nice tasting iced tea."
"12 oz. bottle- color of medium amber , with a decent eggshell color head - nose of sweet citrus hops , malts , fresh vegetation , and caramel Â taste of bitter hops , milk , malts , citrus , and - body creamy , and with medium carbonation Â aftertaste of earthy hops , and bitter"
"D: I could easily drink several of these(12 ozs), but more than a bomber or two might be a bit much. I usually enjoy red ales and St. Rogue is certainly no exception."
"D- This beer has some nice complex and fresh hop flavors with a support from the malt hints but the bitterness was a bit of a punch in the face."
"Good mouthfeel. Drinkable, but this one is a sipper."
"St. Rogue Red pours a dark, hazy copper color with a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. It has a nice aroma, the hops are very noticeable as I would expect, but there's also a sweet maltiness too as well as a some fruity aromas. Light in body, quite active carbonation. Maltier than I expected, with a nice hoppy contrast, but not nearly as aggressive as I typically expect from Rogue, not that it's necessarily a bad thing. This is a nice ale."
"Drinkability/Notes. Dry Hopped St Rogue Red is highly drinkable. A red ale that borders on an IPA with plenty of big, juicy hops that have a pleasant bitterness that makes the mouth want more. Though the hops are the star of the show, the malts hold things together with a subtle caramel/fruity sweetness balancing out the ale. A really nice Amber/Red ale and one I will definitely buy again. Very flavorful but also very sessionable. Anothe fine product from the folks at Rogue. Highly recommended. Seek and Enjoy."
"D: Have had this one before, very tasty brew, well balanced."
"Reddish amber with a thin, creamy yellowish head. Balanced aroma of caramel and hops. Very ""rogue."" You know what I mean. Sweetened textured malty flavor well balanced with fruity hops and an earthy, spuce touch. Medium bodied and slick at first, but a solid bitterness drys things out to finish it off. Pretty soft in the mouth. It's a good amber, I have no real complaints. Session-worthy for sure."
"D - This is a pretty tasty brew. I would recommend this."
"D- enjoyable, interesting take on an amber, but not all to desirable. worth a shot though, it has good qualities."
""
"Drinkability - probably won't drink again. Not impressed."
"D- The smell is kind of strong and kills the taste. It is good just I think I would prefer the un-dry hopped version."
"I was excited when I found this at my local beer store, so I bought a bomber and brought it home and opened it tonight after a while in the ice box. Pours a nice deep, rich red/orange amber color. There's a thin, inch head which dissipates quickly and leaves no lace along the glass. Smells hoppy for sure, but I have difficulty discerning much else in the aroma. Some pine, as a result of the hops, and maybe some orange peel? It has a pleasant flavor, but not necessarily what I was expecting. Very hoppy with some mild sweetness that kicks in at the end. But I expected more complexity for some reason. This is good, but a bit pedestrian. In the least, I was expecting more malt balance, being an amber ale. But still, it's nice. Sort of like a red IPA. Decent mouthfeel as well. Overall, I like this beer, because I like hoppy ales. But I'm not sure I would go out of my way to track it down. Still, a solid effort by Rogue."
"Enjoyable."
"Drinkability: At best, a fairly average, textbook amber ale."
"A must try. Not your average over produced beer."
"Not a demanding beer by any means, nor particulary compelling. However, one could easily knock back a few of these without realizing it."
"Mouthfeel is ok, this is a pretty drinkable beer that would make for a decent session beer. I could have a few of these, but I've got a few more Rogues on the agenda for this evening. Not an amazing brew, especially being from such a hyped brewery, but still one thats pretty good."
"The mouth is medium bodied, showing a decent amount of complexity. The drinkability is average, as it gets a little too sweet without much other complex flavors to undercut it. Not bad--I would never dump on out, but Rogue has done much better."
"Bottom line: Another tasty brew from Rogue that I can recommend."
"Overall: An excellent amber ale, strongly recommended."
"Overall: Even when i wasnt living in oregon, i relished to acquire 22oz bottles of Rogue. Since living here, I usually get around to a bottle of St. Rogues every few months. Good stuff!"
"Above average example of the style. Would pair nicely with a piece of smoked salmon. Another above average beer from a great brewery. Pick it up and enjoy it with a nice meal."
"D: Not necessarily something I'd keep stocked regularly, but definitely something to grab at a bar, and nothing I'd ever turn down if offered."
"I think this is a really good example of an American Amber/Red style. Quite tasty."
"This beer poured a deep amber/red color with a tan, thick and persistent head. The smell is very malty and heavy. The taste is malty and sweet that is balanced with a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is thick but not too chewy. This is a very nice beer that IÂd love to drink often."
"Appearence a tarnished amber colour. Rising head that stayed the sitting. Considerable hoppiness but quite well refined. A harmonious medley of hops which constitutes the heart of this beer. Hops fullbodied with plenty of flavour but escape without being all that bitter. Aggresive but highly drinkable. A well structured flavour with a clean finish, this beer has quite a pompus character to it! I enjoyed this far more than I expected!"
"Served from the tap into a pint glass. This was one of those red/amber ales that is translated into the more bitter/hoppy type rather than one that focuses a little more on sweet hops, and big surprise- it comes from Oregon. The St. Rogue Red really does contain quite a bit of bitterness for an amber and how you review it basically depends on what you were expecting or what you normally look for in an amber ale. Thankfully I've had both ends of the amber/red ale spectrum and I honestly prefer those that contain more proportions of malt and caramel. This isn't a bad beer though, its just more of a full bodied, dark, pale ale."
"I got this stuff by accident. But anyway, it pours pretty darkly with a weak tan head. It smells pretty hoppy with some malt. Its flavor is all hop and very little malt at all. Yes I would like some beer with my hops thank you. The color is kind of a strange rust that would also lead you to expect malt. It's good just not worth the price rogue is asking for it. I've bitten into a hop before and it doesn't taste unlike this. I bet if I aged this stuff for a year or two it would mellow out a bit."
"The drinkibility is what puts this over the top. I could drink these all day and night, no matter the season or time of day. My first perfect 5."
"Poured to a brownish-orange with medium off-white head and decent lacing. Aroma was not real strong, but what was there was mostly floral and grassy hops at the beginning, but by mid-glass became more of a malty nut smell. Flavor was likewise, although the floral hops tended to be the most dominant throughout the entire glass, with a nice smooth finish. Another good offering by Rogue."
"Overall, a very fine red ale that can stand with the best of them. Definitely has the Rogue touch to the style, and while some Rogue brews are taken a bit too far, in my opinion, this one is done almost to perfection. An excellent brew that is definitely recommended."
"Drinkability is decent."
"Chill-hazed burnt orange with a rocky and pock-marked khaki head. Gigantic pine and citrus hop aromas from the dry-hopping (although I've not yet sampled the ""regular"" St. Rogue Red for comparison). Bitter grapefruit pith and bergamot flavors dance around the tongue up front; then a bready malt structure makes its presence known until a piney bitterness returns to puncture the palate at the end. Citrusy spruce burps, but nothing ""nostril-stinging"". Chewy mouthfeel, medium body, but under-carbonated (most likely from the growler not being sealed tightly enough right away). Delicious beer all around. A super sessionable red ale that's *almost* worth the slightly high price ($11.99 a 1/2-gallon)"
"I have wanted to try this beer for some time and I got my growler filled today at Consumers.Poured a slight hazed light amber with a tight well formed 1/2 finger head that left a ring of lace as it settled.Ah man the aromas of this beer would make any hophead speak in tongues at first smell,I popped open the growler to fresh squeezed grapefruit and damp pine needles with underlying freshly mown grass just beautiful and to me pretty much perfect.The fresh hop flavors just abound here really wake up the taste buds there is a sweet caramel malt base there and it holds up ok until the finish when the big dose of fresh citrusy/piney and extremely resiny hop comes crashing thru.Burping fresh tasting hop is a treat,by far my new favorite red its so good I might finish off the growler today!Ouch."
"]"
"Overall this beer is weak"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice large tanned head with a deep copper/amber with slight chill haze. A bit of grassy/herbal hops, toasted and or smoked malts, carmel, and that somes up the aroma. The taste is bitter throughout. There is a astringent metallic taste that creeps into the aftertaste (bitterness). There is carmel to add to the balance, but this brew is not well balanced and the hops take over. The mouthfeel is chewy with a suprisingly light body. I would say that I wouldn't turn it down. It is not their best."
"D-For some reason, this one doesn't ""wear"" well for me. By the time I was onto a 2nd one, I lost interest. I guess it is a but one-dimensional."
"DÂitÂs good and possibly a good session choice."
"D - A nice quaffer from Rogue with a nice toasted malt flavor."
"12 oz pint. From notes. This beer arrived a solid amber color with a small half finger of head. Clarity was very good with small bubbles periodically working towards the head. that head maintained well into the beer. The nose on this beer was awesome. It had a very solid foundation of caramel malt, but the hop that followed was AWESOME. If there were ever candied hops, they would smell like this beer. Sweet and citrusy. There was a light toasted breadyness, but the hops are what define this one. Flavor initially brought caramel and melanoidans but moved very quickly to solid and chunky citrusy hop flavor. It finished with a mild, but very pleasing bitterness, with sweet grapefruity hop and mild caramel malty sweetness. Very very tasty beer here. The feel was moderate with a very fine carbonation, that really added to the experience. This was an excellent beer with bold flavors that knew exactly when to stop short of being too much. The bitter lingered just enough to keep me coming back for more, draining the pint in record time. This one blew my mind."
"D-Very drinkable"
"Deep amber in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of pine, sweet malt, spent hops, and a bit of sour citrus fruit. Lots of caramel malt flavor, along with some earthy hops and a bit of roasty chocolate on the finish. Fairly creamy body with a solid bitter finish. Overall, the aroma wasnÂt as good as I had expected (the spent hop note really put me off), but drinking the beer itself was quite nice."
"D: Highly drinkable. Full of flavor, yet not overwhelming. Looking forward to trying the dry-hopped kegs!"
"This is a much more subtle brew that I expected from Rogue, but I still found it very enjoyable. Great on a hot day like today :) I probably would not seek this out, though."
"Hrmm...this one is a mixed bag. This is definitely a quality brew, but the combination of caramel, pine and excessive grain husk leaves me not wanting to drink another. This is a very rich brew for my tastes. Definitely worth a try for those interested in red's as it's quite unique."
"Hmmmm. I've got it! This brew tastes like ""Arrogant Bastard Light."" And that's a good thing, since SAB is on my short list. It's not as pretty as the Bastard, and not as assertive in the nose or palate, but it's definately in the ballpark. Add in the fact that at 5.1% it's available in WV... this is one worth coming back to."
"A lot going on and not all blends well. Would never turn it down, just tough against the standards this brewery has set. Bitterness not balanced that well."
"Poured a nice dark copper color. A bit of a head and pretty much no lacing. That may have just been the tap system. I noticed that most of the beers poured that night were like that. It had good carbonation though. The taste struck me a mainstream. While good there was nothing unusual about it. Very drinkable and worth a try but certainly not on my top 3 favorite Rogue list."
"Picked this up as a last bottle to complete a sixer. Was not too sure about this choice but was plesantly surprised. Pours an amber red color, with a small head, leaving little to no lacing on the glass. Aroma is of citrus and hops, perhaps a little brown sugar. Taste is heavy on the brown sugar, citrus fruits, apple and hops. Very balanced however, with no one flavor being too overpowering. Nice mild bitter hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Drinkability is high - very tasty brew with a complex taste. Not too overpowering, but enough flavor to keep you guessing. Would buy again, but definitely not the top amber ale out there."
"Cheers!"
"Taste- Natural, zesty hops mixes well with amber malts roasted to perfection. The Northwestern hops offers some citrus notes to meld with the malts in this red brew."
"Taste was surprising. Immediately I noticed the hops which were very tasty. There is also a pretty decent malt presence as well, not in perfect balance, but still tasty. Overall a really good beer."
"Came in a pint glass a cloudy dark amber with a 1/2"" off white head that retained well. Smell was sweet malts. This was strange but still pleasant. I was expecting a much more hoppy aroma. Taste intitially was caramel, but the hops quickly dominate. Piny and grassy hops with a nice hop finish. Very drinkable, session brew. Nothing overly exciting, but good none the less."
"Overall I'd say this is a decent beer. I'd try it again, esspecialy to see if the low carbonation and watery sensation I picked up was just from my bottle."
"Pours a dark garnet red with a finger or two of khaki head. Nose is a mix of fruity hops and vanilla/bready malts. Taste starts off with a citrus-hop bitterness that is evened-out with the vanilla/caramel/bready malts. Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth and lightly carbonated. On the rich side for an amber ale, but plenty of flavor in there to keep you interested. Not a bad beer at all."
"Drinkability: Exactly what a red ale should be: flavorful yet relaxing and extremely drinkable."
"Served in a pint glass and out of the fridge for about 30 minutes. Poured wiith a nice brown-tinted head. Nice brownish-red color and good head retention. The smell is dominated by the citrusy smell of hops. Very nice citrusy taste coming from the hops, with a sweet malty flavor to follow. Nice and creamy in the mouth. This is drinkable to begin with, but when I get a few brews under my belt I tend to not like hoppy flavors, if you don't have that same problem then this is a drinkable beer. Overall I would recommend trying this beer atleast once, it's a very enjoyable American Red ale"
"Pours a dark, cloudy red with a tall and thick beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a fair amount of rocky lacing. Smells of grains and sweet malts with caramel and light hoppiness. Tastes malty, with a candy-sweet tone and some slight hop bitterness, though not as much as I'd expected or hoped for. Mouthfeel is good and full, but not as satisfying as I feel that it could be, and drinkability is good. I had their other amber ale last night, the American Amber, and with that in mind I'm less impressed than I might be. Still a good example of the style, but a pretty middle-of-the-road one."
"An easy drinking beer that has a very dark amber body and a nice sized tannish head. A real looker. I couldn't smell much. Taste is easy on the tongue, a slight hop feel that lingers a bit with some malt. This would make a great social beer, one that isn't too complex but isn't simple either (or nasty)."
"Pouered a deep garnet with massive tannish foamy head. Left nice lacing while slowly falling to a thin coating. Very attractive. Smell is mainly summer fruits (pears, apricots) wiht a slight piney hop note also present. Taste is very strong on sweet malt with a nice firm fruitiness. The hops begin to show their presence, and develop into a nice combination with the malt sweetness. Excellent balance. The finish is more dry then sweet and causes a strong desire for the next taste. A very enjoyable beer with easy drinkability. Nice session beer."
"Pretty drinkable, but doesn't quite pull together as good as I thought up front. I will try again to make sure freshness wasn't a factor (don't think so)"
"I had three ""reds"" tonight, and this was my least favorite (the other two were Red Seal and Avery Redpoint). Kind of an off flavor, not nearly as ""bright"" as the other two. Looks great, goes down easy, but didn't have the nice malty backbite of the other examples I had tonight. I've had Dead Guy several times, and I prefer that over the St. Rogue. Never had a bad Rogue, but this is one of the least impressive of their brews, IMO."
"Burgundy. As soon as the bottle popped and I gravitated my snout toward the neck, I could instantly smell the usage of Centennial and Chinook, even before I noticed the two being noted on the bottle. IÂm getting better at identifying hops. The nose is moderate and improves drastically as its agitated. Piney, resinous hops combine with a pretty lackluster malt body to make this distinctly Rogue offering. I was hoping this would be better."
"Another interesting offering from this brewery."
"Japanese bottle states that the ABV is 5.1%"
"A boring style that really comes to life in this offering. Good flavors, nicely balanced, and highly drinkable = an old standby. A typically solid product from the 'Brewers on the Bay'."
"Pours a deep dark mahgony color with a 1/2"" off white head with lace down the glass. The smell has some hops to it but cannot pick anything else out. Taste has a mild hoppy upfront with a malty aftertaste not as roasted as the american amber ale. Great mouthfeel goes down very smooth. Could drink quite a few of these."
"Pours a nice shade of mahogany or stained cherry. It has quite a red appearance. Minimal khaki colored head dissipates quickly. The nose is a bit quiet, but carmelled malts are present. The taste is malty and toasty, with a bit of pine in there as well. It finishes a bit yeasty with nice bitterness on the sides of the tongue. Medium mouthfeel is adequate. Nice drinkability also."
"Hard to say much more than that about this beer. Some of Rogue's beers have such similar characters to one another that the only thing keeping me going back to them is the bottles."
"12 ounce bottle. St. Rogue Red pours out a clear, dark red color with a large yellowish head. Malty caramel aroma with a large dose of hops. Thin malty flavor with piney hops and an alcoholic bite. A little burnt sugar flavor, but this beer is mainly bitter. Finish is piney hops. I'm a little surprised to have a Rogue beer with such a thin flavor. Not that this beer is thin, it's just thin for a Rogue beer. Drinkability is good. Not a bad beer, but there are plenty of other exceptional beers from this brewery."
"Flavor is a nice malt & hop balance, though I expected more from a Rogue brew. I like that the hops are strong, but not bitter. Nice piney, citrus flavor, but the bitterness is toned down."
"Just another fine Rogue offering. Hey! A little bottle conditioning yeast on the bottom Â excellent!"
"Mouth feel is medium in body and it is moderately carbonated."
"This, to me, is a session beer par excellence. It's complex, not too strong, and tasty as a sumbitch."
"No doubt, this is a drinkable beer. It is a tickle sweet for me but I will happily drink a bomber or two in the course of a setting. This beer is fairly new to the Omaha market. It is a welcomed addition for sure. Tasty and likable, I have no qualms with it. I purchased a bomber in Omaha, NE. Try one if you have not."
"I think this is really improves the regular St. Rogue Red."
"A dark amber American Ale with a mildly sharp smell. This ale is mildly hoppy but has a rich and long-lingering sharp aftertaste. I wasn't overly impressed mostly due to this beer is a little focused on the hops for my taste. There are other Rouge beers that I enjoy better than this one."
"This beer was a Christmas present from a good friend. It poured from the bottle a deep, clear mahogany with some red highlights. ItÂs topped by a thick, fluffy off white head that clings to the side in clumps as it settles back into the glass. The nose has a mild grapefruit citrus aroma backed by a hint of caramel sweetness. The taste has less citrus than expected. ItÂs a pleasant blend of caramel and toffee sweetness and the ruby red grapefruit from the hops. Just a touch of the PacMan tang on the finish. Nice, smooth mouth feel. Good drinkability."
"Pours a lovely red color with decent head. Aromas of sweet malts, caramel, and of fruity hops make up the nose of this brew. The taste has less malt flavor then what I expected and seems to consist mainly of the same fruity hops noted in the aroma. This is a good brew, nothing more nothing less."
"Not really what I'd call an Amber, but I guess the ingredients work. It's very sweet with caramel, toffee, and a touch of molassas. Though tasty, it finishes much less than clean. The hops add an earthiness and spiciness that resembles cloves and wildflowers. Though interesting and complex, there's too much muddling to consider it a top knotch beer. The bittering hops doesn't balance out the huge barley malt sweetness. The finish is sticky and sweet with a touch of bitterness. Aftertaste is all malt."
"D - The is an excellent and very well-balanced red ale that separates itself from other boring red ales in its class. Easy to drink and enjoy. Nice job Rogue!"
"Bold, but brilliant. My complements to the brewmaster."
"Drinkability: definitely worth having more than once. I certainly will have it again."
"Body is mediem, very smooth, with a chewy and slick texture. Way too easy to drink, it dissapears quickly!."
"Pours a dark red/amber in color, nice carbonation, nice little head, very nice lacing through out. Scents of malt, and sweet caramel. Very nice taste, different than other Amber's I've had, maybe more sweet with a little bite at the end. Medium body. This is a very drinkable beer/ale, not sure of the ABV though, but would most likely make a nice short drinking session."
"Another brew I've passed up way to many times on my beer shopping ventures. I just started consuming this brew about 6 months ago and wish I had not waited so long. In my opinion this is the best Red I've had the pleasure to gobble at this point. Still room for improvement (?maybe, maybe not?) I think if it just kicked in a little more malted/thickness to the body but no complaints here."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a medium head with average retention. Aroma of hops is clearly dominant. Taste is quite refreshing with a nice dose of caramel malt and a surprisingly high level of bitter hops at the end. Not the most complex of beer but the high level of hops make this more interesting then most beers in this style."
"This red ale has a medium feel and highly drinkable.Another awesome beer from Rogue,which may be the best brewer in America."
"Overall: Just an average offering from Rogue. Worth a try, but that's about it. I'll take a Red Seal Ale over this one any day!"
"This one is very malty with an excellent hop profile to balance it out. A nice session brew."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: A very average beer better than most mass produced. Inspite of appearance just seemed watery and left me wanting more. I may be lost in high alchol, high hop beer/crack land."
"Deep ruby color and a light tan sticky head. Good head retention. The aroma is balanced. I can detect both bitter hops and malts in equal amounts. Roasted malts are slighty more dominant. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky. I find the taste fairly balanced. Plendy of roasted malts and spicy hops come out in the flavor. The finish is dry and a little hoppy. Good Drinkability too. Goes down easy."
"It is a good beer, but it is ""just another Rogue"" in my book (though not to say that there are not some Rogue beers that go above and beyond my expectations every time I revisit them). I probably won't revisit this beer in favor of other Rogue products the next time my inner outlaw is unleashed, and nothing else will do other than a Rogue."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Good carbonation that mellows after a while, medium bodied consistency. Great with a steak, a bit much for drinking as a session. I wouldn't want more than one of these, but I might throw it in there in the mix."
"Underrated red. Good combination and balance of bitterness, hoppiness and malt. I would drink this as a staple if they distributed here. Good sumer beer by itself or with some daytime food. Big malty head and off-white brown colour. Smooth, great bottle cartoon."
"Not a bad beer, but not one I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for either."
"4 on drinkability might increase if it weren't 90 degrees outside, seems a bit heavy for this kind of night."
"Pours a brilliant brown-red, with a nice sized head. Very strong malty aroma with hints of fruits like cherries and other berries. The taste is similar, with a lot of maltiness making this a sweet and potent brew. Some hoppiness is also present in the beginning. Very easy to drink, and was delicious with some fresh crabs."
"Pours a deep crimson-hued amber with a thick tan head that retains well, a beautiful beer. Aroma is full of citrusy (mainly grapefruit) hops and complex bready and sweet caramel malt scents. Taste is aggresivley hoppy, but with a complex malt character. Begins with a caramel and molasses sweet malt profile that is lightly bready then follows with citrusy hops flavors (mainly grapefruit and orange) and has a dry, bitter finish. Another superb rogue brew, this one is really best fresh as the hops seem to deteriorate quickly over time."
"Definitely worth a try."
"Not bad. Was better when i had it on tap a few months ago with kmpitz."
"Pours a clear dark red body with a big tan head. Retention was good as was the lacing. Smells very malty and bready. It starts going downhill with the taste, though. Way too buttery for my taste. Malty and sweet, but a little cloying. It could use a little more carbonation in my opinion. This is a very average red ale."
"Pours a somewhat cloude medium dark amber with a 2 finger head, good longevity and very good lacing. Aromas of a nice rich malt with some raisin, plum and vanilla notes. Slight alcohol too. Smells sweet, like maple. At first the tatse is of a stronger ale with some raisin and caramel notes. A lingering roastiness bitterness is left on the sides of the tounge - a bit too much I think. I enjoy a nice red ale but I was not expecting the amount of roasted malt flavor it has. Its not bad, just too much for me in a red ale. A bit watery as well considering its roastiness. Slightly below medium carbonation. As I stated, its a quality brew just not one of the better reds in my book."
"22 ounce bottle. Thanks Dr. Wad!"
"Ruddy garnet body with a small, but steady, light khaki head. Nose is roasty, toasty, and sweet with caramelized notes and a raisiny fruitiness. Fresh, herbal-bitter hops top it off. Nice. Sweetish toasted malt notes up front. Herbal hop bitterness pervades, with cookie-dough maltiness in the middle and a singed hop flower finish. Doughy sweetness lingers. Medium-bodied, with a moderate hop bite. Would go well with a burger."
"Its clear reddish-copper body is capped by a full head of foamy light tan froth that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace. The aroma is quite hoppy with notes of piney and gentle citrus. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation. The flavor starts softly fruity and lightly nutty before some sweet caramel maltiness breaks through, only to be hammered back by its quickly ensuing resiny hop flavor and bitterness. It finishes dry with just some residual maltiness and a bold lingering bitterness. Delectable!!!"
"Poured a fine 3 inch head, deep red in color, and there is a nice lacing being left in my glass. Nose is a nice caramely citrus and malt blend. Taste definitely grows on you. This is a nicely balanced beer heavily influenced by the caramel malts and the beginning, and it finishes with a nice citrus dry hop. Mouthfeel is nice and full as most Rouge beers are made. Overall drinkability is good. This one definitely grows on one as you drink it!"
"Very disappointing. I know this is suppose to be basically the same as Santa's Reserve, but I don't see how."
"Tastes initially dry irony but then a great malty and caramel steps in. There is some hint of floral citrusy hops at the end and the aftertaste rises as a repeat of the caramel and malt. It's sweet yet has a crispness. Hop bitter is noticable, but just a tingle across the pallette. Md thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated. The flavors are really well balanced and overall, the flavors are tune with the hop bitter. It's a little bit rough grassy on the tongue (about 2/3 through the beer) which is starting to wear considering the beer now seems quite dry. Hops are also more prevalent, but with looking, I can still find sweet in the middle of the swallow."
"I tried subsequent samples with a choice cut of rib-eye (as suggested on the 6-pack) as well as a ham sandwich. It matched rather well with the steak, where carmelized flavors from the grill mixed well with sweet maltiness in the beer. Hops help to cleanse the palate and begin the combinatorial process again. A plain ham sandwich was a little too salty and the mix of ham and red ale was subsequently unbalanced."
"Dark amber with a nice foamy head. Generally a sweet malty flavor with a bit of hops, and a dry, clean finish. The feel is nice and full, but not too heavy that I don't enjoy the whole 22 on my own. While not really distinctive tasting, I feel it is very well balanced and drinkable, so it earns high marks on taste - it's a well designed beer. Great with food, so do yourself a favor and grab a burger and a St. Rogue's Red."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle -- previously enjoyed only from 22 oz. bottles. Appearance is a deep amber, almost red color. Very nice. Aroma is malty with some caramel and some hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty full and chewy for a red. Taste is excellent: sweet, a little dry, well-balanced hops. Good finish. Drinkability is high. This is my first six-pack of this particular Rogue style, but like most Rogue brews, I would not hesitate to purchase another. Rogue consistently puts out enjoyable, approachable, and very drinkable beers. St. Rogue Red is no exception. Enjoyable with meals."
"Slightly unbalanced but pretty good. Sort of a let down from my favorite brewer..."
"Perhaps the darkest of the ambers I've run across - deep garnet, and under a bright light I almost see a touch of purple. Bright and lively in the mouth. Rogue was more reserved in hopping than I expected, but this is an American take on the red ale style, with some well-moderated sharp bittering in the middle. Finishes out with some malty sweetness. Not stellar, but a solid product."
"On tap poured into a half-pint glass. It pours a medium ruby red color with one finger of head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The smell is fairly hoppy, but still has a nice amount of toasted malt character. The taste is very...weird. Slightly burnt and maybe smokey malt up front, and it seems to have a candy flavor, like licorice to it. Rather odd, but still good. The finish is nice and hoppy. Really piney hop flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly thick. The drinkability is very nice too. Another good one from Rogue."
"Notes: Not the type of beer I usually go after, but surprisingly drinkable. Very malty brew, little hop presence, but unique fruit and spice aromas, make this beer worth a try."
"Notes: Good contrasting malt sweetness and hop bitterness and flavor. Could use more body. Definitely a good beer."
"Brilliant red pour with a big head that dissipated fairly quickly. Smell is malty with some caramel and just a little bit of hops. Flavor is a pretty thick wall of malt with a lot of chewy grain and caramel flavors. The hops come through very faintly in the finish, but the malt really evens it out with a nice roasty flavor. Not a bad one from Rogue."
"Some nice fruity malt with strident underlying hops. Again, tastes a bit of tea leaves in the hoppy flavors. Nice, crisp, medium bodied brew. Nice hoppy aftertaste and bite and a fine very drinkable red ale."
"Smooth enough for a session beer but a little heavy, great for the style."
"Drinkability Â I hearken back to the 80Âs band ÂSimply RedÂ. Its not too exciting but its certainly drinkable (listenable)."
"12 oz bottle pours a cloudy dark amber with a nice creamy off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass, aromas of pine and caramel. Citrus, pineapple, caramel and fruity cherry flavors. Medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes bitter."
"Debating on trying this again since I am a Rogue fan. From the bargan table at Corall liquors in Granite City."
"This one pours a brown color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has some caramel malt, but also has a lot of grassy hops. The flavor is much the same. Mostly caramel malts with a lot of hops on top of it. Not bad, but not really my style. The body is right about where it should be."
"Now, I know some folks who swear that this is one of the finest brews ever created and may be the reason that God gave us hops to begin with. And that's fine. For me, I'll pass on this one from now on."
"Overall I would say this one ranks very well as one of my favorite brews. Very well crafted Cheers!"
"Quite drinkable, I will certainly buy it again and again."
"get me another beer wench ! they didnt have growlers available.. godamn it ! There were other interesting brews on tap (not many as the old bay has really gone down hill) but this one was captivating. The old dog has learned some new tricks and won't go down so easily.. Rogue continues to impress as they become in a wierd way the elder statesmen of the new wave of american micros."
"Remarkably better than what I was expecting. It poured much darker and thicker than I thought it would. There was a full thick head that would never quite go away and create a line of lace for every sip I took. Also much maltier. The hops were there (very smooth) but the malts took over. I really enjoyed the toffee and cream flavors. All in all, a very rich beer that I would greatly enjoy again."
"Another great brew from Rogue! Find it and try it if you haven't already had the pleasure, you'll be glad you did."
"Overall, this is a tasty brew. Nothing too flashy, just a good, solid, easy drinking ale."
"Overall: a delicious hearty brew with lots of malt and not so much hops."
"Another tasty Rogue brew? Hell yeah, these guys cannot be beaten. Appearance is dark brown with a tall and creamy head. Aroma is full and very inviting. Smell is fairly malty, much maltier than the beer tastes, but hops have a strong presence too. Taste begins with piney hops, becomes nicely balanced towards the middle, and finishes mildly sweet. Very enjoyable overall, creamy mouthfeel just adds to the goodness. More anything from Rogue please."
"I could drink this all night long...in fact I bought a growler and did just that!"
"The gummy malt mouthfeel is perfectly balanced by the late-addition hops and deliberately leveling dry-hop. This was one fantastic beer."
"Has a well-balanced malt vs. spicy bitter flavor with a hint of butterscotch. Some milk-duds in there as well. Kind of chewy but smooth going down, very drinkable. I can't believe I hadn't had this one before. But then again, so many beers..."
"Medium-full bodied"
"This bomber has been in my beer fridge for months at least. I kept passing it over for more interesting looking fare, but I now realize how mistaken I was. St. Rogue Red is one fabulous red ale, maybe the best that I've had. It's also one of my favorite Rogue beers and that's saying something."
"Pours a dark cherry wood color with tan head that is impressive to the eye, lacing is excellent. The smell is strong of cherries and caramel. A nice blend with the floral/citrus hops. The taste is strong of syrup and molasses with a gorgeous blend of floral poppiseed hops, very fresh to the taste. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Poured slightly hazy. Bright burgundy/red in color and topped with a full head of creamy foam. A wall of sticky foam coated the entire top half of the glass. The aroma yields a beautifully sweet floral-like hoppiness, with strawberries, orange liqueur and even a hint of lavender. The taste has notes of bittersweet black cherries, with a sweet malt body. Tangy, nice body, full flavored and the finish makes you smack your lips for more. One I would surely revisit."
"A drinkable beer, I come back to it from time to time."
"Drinkability: I could have had these all night. Awesome beer, and a great one to have over and over."
"Carbonation is a little coarse on this one, but forgivable. Hops assault the senses with the first sip, evoking a feeling of pine, though this is followed (by midsip) with a pleasant maltiness that tempers the bitter hops. By the end of the sip the hops are back in force. The well balanced smell promised in the nose does not bear fruit in the taste. Hops dominate too much here."
"St. Rogue Red achieves a fine balance of momentous proportions. This beer is so smooth and so drinkable; it makes me sad to think of those poor lost souls who still drink Bud."
"This is only my second sample of of Rogue beer, which was somewhat disappointing, but I know they have better out there, and I look forward to trying more all the same."
"Yikes, I think I experienced a Rogue brew that I didn't like somewhat. I saw the reviews for this beer and saw somewhat an above average so I was looking forward to this one. But man, this didn't do it for me. Poured out a murky copper/amber color with some alright carbonation in there. Smell consisted of some piney, caramel, very slight malts, and some hops. It was more like piney hops. Taste was a let down I thought. Hops attack the palate and lasts all the way through the aftertaste. Where were the malts and caramel? It wasn't balanced as I though it was going to be. Along with the hops came some roasted flavors, but not very much. A bit of a let down."
"Whereas American Amber ascends above a sometimes mundane style, St Rogue Red does not. That's not to say this is awful, just standardized and forgettable."
"Another solid Rogue beer, and one I'd been meaning to try for a while. They certainly make some good hop beers, and this is no exception, and one I'd gladly have again."
"A decent beer, but I've never been the biggest red ale fan and this didn't make me one."
"Hmm, where's the hops? I normally enjoy this as dry hopped red on draft, which basically rules. This was a totally different beer experience, so different, I thought I was drinking an octoberfest...Anyway, beer was a medium reddish amber, low to no head, aroma was on the malty side. The mouthfeel was definitely full...very thick and almost, but not quite, syrupy. The oddest thing about this one was when drinking the initial taste was of some hop bitterness, followed by full-on maltiness...bit of a reverse from the normal process. I'll be honest, I thought the hops got a bit lots...this is a decidedly malty brew. Wasn't that impressed with the mouthfeel...it was about the thickest I've ever experienced in a beer. I'll stick with the draft dry hop version, which I love."
"This brew is a hazy brown color, with a large foam tan head, leaves behind good lace. Nice hop scent, slight caramel malt. The taste has a nice bitter hop streak, not as intense as brutal bitter but similar hops i would guess. Some well integrated caramel/roast malt. Very well blended, great taste."
"An all around good beer. This one poured a good dark red color with a small frothy white head that left an unusual ammount of lace for its size. The smell was quite dark with a deep carmel malt scent accented with a great hop smell as well. The taste was of burnt carmel malt and a slight dry hoppiness that stood out and gave a great presence. Definantly a good beer to go back to."
"The beer pours a nice ruby red color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades quickly. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty aroma which boasts of crystal malts and fruity yeast. The taste is good. It has a dry, malty, yet bitter flavor that goes down easy and leaves you with a bitter hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It is the worst Rogue brew I've tried, but it's still better than most."
"The sediments left in the bottle were mighty tasty, as i find them to be with other Rogue ales. Pour it in the glass and drink it down, don't waste the best part."
"Deep reddish-amber, slightly hazy body with an inch thick beige colored head and a good deal of latent carbonation. The aroma is caramel malt and a whiff of sourdough bread along with a decent dose of piney and floral hops that are typical of Rogue. The taste is dominantly caramelized malts, along with some sourness, and a hint nuts and smoke. The hops are assertively bitter at the start of each sip and reemerge in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy, and is helped along by the high level of carbonation. This beer packs a lot of flavor, and has a decent session potential, but is a bit too bitter when consumed at cooler than cellar temperature. As it warms to near room temperature, a more robust sweet and malty character emerges mid-palette, making the beer much more appealing."
"Tongueland: Crisp and sweet. Malts really came out, mixed with sweetness comparable to honey. As warmed, caramel and hops emerged, competing for playing time. The alcohol slightly emerged in a warming sense as I progressed and this was a welcoming feeling. Delectable, but not as good as Aviator Red from Flying Bison, Buffalo, NY."
"The Sunset Grill and Tap had this brew listed as an IPA. It would fit that traditional style, but not with the west coast intensity that folks might expect. This ale was red, and good. It's deep color contrasted nicely with the modest, and fading head. The aromas were mostly grassy, with hints of the more floral aspects of the hops. The flavors were quite well balanced with a grassy hop presence that becomes quite fruity all over a sweet and enticing malt backbone. It's a medium-bodied session beer that I would enjoy again."
"This was a very drinkable beer that would go well with food or just sitting around with friends."
"A drinkable brew, good for a heavy meal, but there are better."
"Poured from a Brown bomber. I can easily compare this to the style, since I had it between a pair of killians. This is a much darker beer than the Coor's product. Smell is also more rich in those delicious hops and caramel smelling malts. Excellently balanced, a very good example of the style. Sweet and bitter, exactly what I think a red should be."
"Poured a dark rich deep red color, it had a solid head. It's somewhat, but not totally creamy, but some it dissapates quickly and leaves little lacing; there was a hop presence through and through the beer, i don't think there was a sip without something present in the flavor. It doesn't smack you in the face by any means, but, it is nice to have that kind of hoppy bitterness.The malt provided a solid backbone to this beer. highly quaffable and extremely drinkable, the yeast provides a nice balance in this brew. More than standard, but less than phenomenal, this a very nicely and well put-together ale. If you can, drink it. You can go the distance with this brew. It is another finely crafter product from the boys from Rogue. Well played, gentlemen. Well played, indeed."
"pours the deepest shade of red, leaning more toward rusty brown. sizeable tan head recedes to an ever-present coating foam. crystal malt and light PNW hop aroma. sturdy medium body, carbonation is just right. toasted caramel malt sweetness mixes well with a good but not overwhelming dose of chinook hoppiness. bitterness is there, but not over the top. characterstic rogue aftertaste (must be the pac-man yeast). certianly quaffable, in a style that for me is hard to define."
"I like this beer, but not sure why. Unbalanced, tannic, somewhat short on character, but surprisingly interesting. Definately worth a try."
"The head was unimpressive, although a nice copper/white color. This was on the bottom end of the Rogue brews that I have had."
"Nice malts but not interesting, much prefer its bigger brother, the SantaÂs Private Reserve."
"Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkable ale."
"The hops in this beer lend an almost tropical air, something initially rather unexpected, but certainly not a bad thing. The malt pushes its way into the limelight in time to stop the hops from stealing the show. There's a saucy, spicy balance that draws you into looking for the next one. The grapefruit presence almost delivers the sensation of pulp. Wonderfully quaffable, I like the way it plays, and I'll definitely come back for multiple acts."
"This has a candy like finish, and then the bitterness seems to reappear after swallowing. Definitely a heavier bodied red ale (which is a good thing) and this is a very drinkable session beer."
"Deep reddish copper with a rocky beige head. Sprucy hops and sweet crystal malt aromas. Sweetened tea maltiness with a good bit of astringency from the hops. This beer is very quaffable, strong enough and hoppy enough to make it a sessioner on draught, probably. Very sweet malt to this red ale. Slick on the tongue. High alpha hops are sweet, too. Rogue's got my seal of approval on this one."
"Appearance: Very well crafted deep amber red tone with a nice biege head lacing appears coating the entire side in very fine nicely patterned specks. Aroma: Soothing caramel malts very grainy cereal sweetness, with spruce toned hopping in the finish. Taste: Remarkably similar to the Santa's Private Reserve just less hops here the same malt character, I think this beer is incredible with the semi sweet caramel/biscuit malts tasting of cereal grains with a nice touch of piney hops and signature Pac Man yeast breadiness this beer is a classic balanced session brew in my opinion. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied smooth carbonation classic. Drinkability: My go to Rogue product from now on, of course I'm still a fan of Dead Guy but this one is so balanced and reserved yet flavorful and filling I love it."
"Dark hazy amber brown with a overall reddish tone with a finger high tannish head of thick froth, top becomes whipped as it settles slowly a favorable hazy skim and thick collar, sparitic lacing in webby sheeting. Smell is a nice mix of caramel dipped biscuits, a bit dry of woody pine comes through underneath. Flavors are a nice meld of the same with more of the woody drying coming through by quite a bit. Caramel is lessened and barely detected as the hops make a home in a hugely drying wood flavor thats actually quite nice. Bitterness in check, not overwhelming in any regards. Slight dulled fruit skin notes pop in nearer the finish. Good light fluffy textured mouthfeel thats medium in body and dry throughout with woodyness. A fine amber I'd have again and again."
"Sampled 10/26/03"
"This is a damn nice beer. I am becoming more and more impressed with Rogue."
"Innnnteresting. A deep ruby brew with a thin layer of white lace atop. This doesn't smell like a Rogue brew! Malty aroma with notes of caramel. Where's the hops in the nose? Oh wait, I just took a sip and I found them. Lacking hops in the nose, it gives you a pretty rich amount in the flavor. A bit of sweet malt as well, but not all that much else. An easy drinker that would make for a nice session, while not being a hoppy tongue destroyer (note: hoppy tongue destroyers rule). This is a nice brew, but for the caliber of a brewery like Rogue, it's about average."
"The nose is highly aromatic and combines a most lovely caramel malt with strong whiffs of floral hopping. Quite a nice aroma to this little beauty. The taste is failry full and has, at once, a strong malt sweetness that is overtly pushed around by very strongly bittering hops. These hops are a strong surprise in a red and even more so at this strength level. The feel is very good and gives a nice crisp end to each draw. Very nicely drinkable ale."
"an overall good yet slightly uninspired brew from the folks at rogue. it's certainly not a misfire, but not amongst thier best. it looks like your typical red ale after it's poured...medium amber in colour with a medium head. the smell and taste are hoppy and hint at a fruity sweetness as well, but at times are a bit too hoppy and a bit too bitter for my liking. this in turn takes away from the overall smoothness that i associate with a red ale. it's a bit different and still tasty, but just not in the league of other rogue brews."
"Overall a decent beer. It somewhat reminds me of a british style IPA. Call me crazy."
"Drinkability Â IÂm not a big fan of the red ales, but I really like this one. It went down well, hit the spot, and found a place in my regular shelf spacing."
"$3.49 a bomber."
"An above average Red Ale, which is pleasent seeing as its a style that has been beaten into the ground making it real hit or miss. This was a hit. Poured a orange-brown infused with a ruddy copper perfect for the changing leaves and a loose off-white head. Smelled of deep piney hops and a fruity peach like malt with just a hint of bready notes, but still typical hopped up Rogue aroma. Taste was tons of juicy grapefruit hops and a toasted cracker malts. Reasonably effervesant bordering on creamy. Went as a good compliment to the quatro formage pizza with waaay too much garlic. Another quality Rogue brew."
"This red-tinged, dark brown/amber ale with a full beige head is beautiful to behold. The fresh floral and tea-like hop aromas are fairly potent. A sweet malt and faint chocolate aroma are noticed early, but fade rather quickly. The lightly caramel sweet malt melds with a fresh biscuity flavor. The hop bitterness is made up of grapefruit, tea-like and a faint metallic bite. Fruit notes and a light lime taste appear late as does a bit of honey sweetness as it warms."
"22oz bomber. This pours a deep reddish/amber, hence the name with a good creamy white head. The aroma of bitter, slightly citrousy hops hits you first, with some bready maltiness in the background. This is a bitter beer. Not so much mega hoppy but the weak malt taste seems to almost add bitterness as opposed to balancing it out. As a hop head I'm enjoying this. As far as red ales go I can't say I've had better. Nice slick mouthfeel that dries up into a bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"Like the Dead Guy Ale, this felt a little out of place. Caramel and choc, with a typical Rogue hoppyness on the finish, some earthyness notes. Nice flavours, just didn't excite me i guess, nothing really jumped, and althought it was drinkable, it didn't really do anything for me in the end (Bottle-GBBF 03')"
"This one pours with a medium head of orangey tan foam that doesnÂt remain very long and doesnÂt produce much of a lace. True to its name, the beer is clear reddish-copper in color. Roasted malts are apparent on the nose, as are some slight notes of hops. The flavor starts with fairly mild malt notes that have very small hints of caramel and maybe a little bit of nuttiness. Big roasted malt character then hits the palate. Hops become more noticeable towards the end and mingle well with the roasted notes. The dry finish is of hops and some roasted bitterness which lasts into the aftertaste. St. Rogue seems a little thin in the mouth, with moderate carbonation. This is a good brew that is pretty easy to drink, but not my favorite."
"Medium red color, medium head. Medium bodied red ale. Roasted malts, slightly sweet. Nice flavor. Slightly hoppy. Spicy with a touch of spruce. Good balance. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice tasting beer. Etched/painted beer bottle."
"It has a great reddish look to it and a very hoppy smell, yet it is not too intense in bitterness. It was nice on the palat and a good mix of flavor. Nothing overpowering, it was easy to drink and like most other Rogue beers, well made."
"This red ale poured a hazy, red amber color with creamy off-white foam that left some fine lace. The smell was very hoppy but with some caramel malt in the background. As the name implies, this ale tasted like a red ale but with a potent hoppy punch. The taste had caramel malt but also a nice, resinous hoppy flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth and hoppy. Medium body and carbonation. Very nice hops aftertaste. This was a very drinkable ale."
"Yet another fine ale from Rogue. A beautiful deep reddish amber ale with a magnificent frothy tan head. Aroma is malty with notes of caramel. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium to full bodied. An excellent treat this is. Flavor is almost half malt and half hops with a bitterness that is well blended. A malty flavor that is a bit sweet like a scotch ale almost. Excellent work guys."
"As I said earlier I have never been a fan or Red ales before, but this could make me a convert. The taste started with nice maltiness with slight caramel and nutty undertones, followed by the lovely dry hops flavour.Most Reds I have had before have had to much sweetness. The hoppiness at the end definately balanced this out and gave it balance and enhanced the overall mouthfeel . While not my favourite Rogue, this beer was better than expected and a very very nice brew"
"This beer poured a slightly hazy medium dark reddish orange with a large rocky tan head. The smell is of mild maltiness with a pronounce cedary/sprucey hops. The taste is slightly breadlike with a strong but pleasing cedary hoppy finish and a nice full and rounded mouthfeel. This is a very nice bitter red ale with lingering hoppiness."
"a nice one."
"overall, a very solid red ale, and not a hop bomb, either. (and i mean that in a good way.)"
"Drinkability: I'm not pleased at all with this beer. I expect a red ale (my favorite style) to be quite malty and perhaps a bit hoppy but definitely without the fruity (citrusy) side. In fact, I am disappointed to the point that I shan't even make the effort of trying it again. This is not what red ale is about AT ALL (ok, aside from the color), IMO."
"I got this growler from Half Time Beverages in Puoghkeepsie, N.Y. (You have simply got to go there if you can--what an incredible place! See all the beerfly reviews.). Anyway, this hoppy brew pours a dark ruby amber with a light tan head. The smell is understated; I didn't really know what to expect. Yes, there was hops and a touch of rosy sweetness. The taste, however, was far more intricate. I loved the first blast of hops bitterness, which then mellowed into a balanced semi-sweet finish. Good mouthfeel. Definitely worth it. (and my wife loved it too)"
"Dark reddish brown pour with a medium head that held up pretty well. The nose was malty. Good hoppiness as well with underlying hints of fruit. The taste was nicely hopped. Good maltiness and a slight fuity sweetness to follow. Good overall balance and body. An enjoyable beer. Not my favorite from Rogue, but good nonetheless."
"One of the better tasting Red Ales I've ever drunk and down, and I'm sure I'll revisit it again, and again. Quite a nice little beer! (The 22oz. serving size in the typically handsome Rogue bottle was a bit short, I felt. Maybe Magnums are in order?)"
"Cloudy apple cider in appearance. Minimal tan-colored head laces quite nicely. Aromas, predictably, are of hops. Not quite as ""heavy"" as expected, but distinctly hoppy, with just a slight sweet undertone in the background. Taste was not as over-the-top Rogue-esque hoppy as I' d expected, especially for a beer that was dry-hopped. Hoppy flavor with a surprisingly-balanced malt sweetness noted as well. However, there was an almost ""iced-tea"" flavor to this beer as it warmed. Mouthfeel is smooth, though slightly on the thin side. Drinkability is tolerable. I was slightly disappointed by this offering from Rogue, given my typical love for most of the beers I've had from them."
"While I didn't plan to review any of the brews I tried at the AoBF, this one just stuck in my mind because it was such a disappointment coming from a brewery that puts out consistently great beer. What I find strange is that I really like their double-the-hops, winter version of this, Santa's Private Reserve."
"Very easy drinking beer..a good summer beer in my opinion."
"Taste: Upfront, this beer was all caramel malt and butter. Then a plum and tart juniper flavor kicked in that intermingled with a mild piney-hops bitterness that arose on the finish. Very straightforward and full flavored, but without much complexity."
"This brew pours a deep red color with a big creamy tan head that for a bit then settles to a minimal head, leaving a sexy lace behind. Moderate to high hop aroma along with a pale malt smell fill the nose. Light bodied red ale makes for a strong hop flavor along with a earthy tones fill the palatte. A musty sort of taste is not to bad either. Overall this is a pretty good brew from a great brewery."
"I bought this beer because I wanted to see how Rogue handled the Red style. Instead what I sampled was just an over hopped IPA. All I could taste was hops, and plenty of them. It did have the red color, but it tasted like an IPA. If Rogue could just turn the hops down, I'm sure the finer quality of the red style will shine through."
"Not a bad brew, a bit unbalanced, lacking and average; leaning heavily towards to the hop character. Malty aroma is deceiving, too. Overall not one of Rogue's best, but certainly drinkable and appealing here and there. Worth a try, but don't expect a lot from this beer."
"Not exactly what I was expecting since it was listed as an IPA. I don't think this is an IPA; correct me if I am wrong. A sweet fruity taste was unexpected, but welcome. The hops are quite strong as well. I never thought a beer so packed with hops could be so sweet. The balance here is superb. Hats off to Rogue!"
" If you like the St. Rogue Red, or just like hoppy beers, try this if you can find it."
"The beer as it sets in my glass a sanguineous color, the head reasonable in size, spumous in texture, light tan in color, as it evanesces, the lace nice thick clinging sheets. The aroma of hop flowers, cotton candy sweet, malted grains, fresh, crisp and clean a very labyrinthine nose to be sure. Sweet start, lots of malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate, finish stinging in its acidity, dynamic in its hop spiciness, dry hop bitter aftertaste seals off a very interesting and quaffable brew."
"I had this on tap and was most impressed with this beer. It's a good-looking red with a nice sticky head. The smell of hops is very pleasant, with notes of pine. The taste is a delightful blend of malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Keep 'em coming."
"The numerical part of the BA rating system has become more difficult for me tonight after tasting so many great beers. Well, actually only two, the Corsendonk and now a bomber of this. I'd like to rename this beer ""Arrogant Bastard Light"". That's just my opinion though. It pours a a nice brown color with large rocky had that goes away kind of quickly. As for the taste, if you'e ever tried Arrogant Bastard, you could say that this tastes like a light version. Not to say that this beer isn't good, and doesn't have a certain unique characteristic, but Arrogant Bastard Lite is all I can think about. As a rule of thumb however, you can't go wrong with any Rogue product."
"Notes: A decent red ale, actually it is quite tasty in a laid back way though I like its alternate ego âDry Hop Redâ which is the tapped version that is dry-hopped to the hilt. I found this to be a perfect pairing with my Hellâs Fire Beef Stew."
"I was very pleased with this ale as red ale is usually not my favorite.  Color is a deep reddish amber and a thick tan head leaves exceptional thick rings of lace.  Smell is earthy and ""healthy"".  Taste is very smooth and mouthfeel decent. Excellent drinkability makes this one a winner in my book."
"A ÂstraightÂ -4- from the Judges, a very good Red."
"The label is right, it's red. Pours a bright red with a fairly big head, dissapates quickly. Leaves some lace. You taste the hops right off the bat, smooth taste and mouthfeel, and again a hoppy finish. Not over done on the hops though, just enough to let you know this is an American ale, brewed in the Northwest. Good beer, I haven't had a bad one from Rougue yet, still, there's tastier ones out there."
"Nice thick meaty head off the pour. Deep dark rich amber in color. Huge lace to decorate the glass Fruity overtones in the aroma. But the taste....WOW. Outstanding. Roasty, malty, and hoppy mixture in one great flavor rush. Another winning beer from Rogue."
"Had this in a 22 oz. bomber. This is another solid Rogue ale that fits my taste. It pours a deep garnet color, as the name may imply, with a durable head that laces well. The smell is typical of Rogue products - it's hoppy. There is certainly a hearty dose of those Pacific Northwest hops in this red ale. The taste, at first, is somewhat malty and sweet with a hint of the Pacman yeast, but once again, the hops penetrate through, creating an enjoyable bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, with drinkability ranking high. This a medium bodied brew, and would make a pretty solid session beer in my opinion... that is, if you like your red/amber ales with a generous dose of bittering hops. I know I do."
"St. Rogue Red is the base for Santa's Private Reserve but with half the hops. Which is amazing to me because, as in typical Rogue fashion, the balance to this beer already leans toward the hop end. And this is good if you enjoy a mouthful of oily hops. Oh sure, the malt makes itself evident in the nose and the beginning of your draught, but the hops are kickin' its ass out of your memory in no time. Tasty!"
"Reddish to light copper colored. Aromas are predominantly citrusy hops, with a small amount of malt in the background. The taste is more balanced, with the hops pronounced at the start and the malt fighting for position towards the finish, making more headway as the beer warms. Very solid."
"Fairly dark for an amber. Very dark shade of copper brown. At some angles, it verges on black. When light passes through it, it looks blood red. Head is off-white and fairly creamy. Nose is mostly citrusy, slightly floral hops. Some malt lingers underneath. Taste is a contrast between the bright crisp colors of the hops and the truly earthy taste character of the malt. It reminds me of a picture of a gloved hand, grimy from working in a garden holding the a freshly cut bright yellow flower. I know it's weird, but that's what it reminds me of. This is a bit hoppy for an amber, but a good beer."
"Great amber/mahogany color with some pretty good carbonation and white head.  Bitterness gets you from the beginning and ends up balancing nicely with the sweeter malts.  More bitter than I am used to in an amber, but very nice."
"pours out of the 22 oz. bomber a deep dark amber, with a healthy off-white head. beautiful aroma of caramel malt and NW hops. nice full mouthfeel...lots of fruiten malts with the bitterness of the hops in the forefront. a balanced rogue brew. esp. if you like your brews on the bitter side. lingering malt flavours in the aftertaste. no problem putting this bomber down! delicious stuff."
"22 oz brown bottle. Rich amber color, with a big fluffy tan  head. Head fell nicely, got a bit thin, but some stayed. Nice sweet malty smell, balanced with alot of hops. Very balanced taste as well, some sweetness in the malt, and very noticable, crisp hop finish. Medium body, which was expected. Complimented a grilled chicken and roasted corn on the cob dinner perfectly. A very drinkable Amber Ale, the only one I had of the others listed. I thought it was very pleasant, flavorful, and balanced."
"This beer had a very dark amber/garnet color to it pouring out. It formed a nice medium tan head with plenty of lace as it subsided.  The aroma was of both malt and hops which almost heralded the astringent flavor that you knew had to be coming after that frangrance. Slightly sweet, but not as sweet as others, which I think is good.  Usually the macros put a name red, but nothing to it.  Other micros add too much flavor.  This might be the proper balance, but will have to sample more red ales to make that determination."
"Pours dark amber with creamy off-white head that has some retention and forms nice rings on the glass as I drink.  Aroma is about half and half of hops and malt.  At first I thought it was predominantly hops, but after smelling more, there's definite malt aroma too.  Medium to full bodied.  There is nothing spectacular about tasting this brew.  There's some malt.  There's some NW hops.  But I'm also getting a slightly astringint off-flavor on the tongue and especially lingering after I drink.  This is one that I ordered from Vintage Cellar and maybe it had been sitting too long.  If not, this is a very average brew from an outstanding brewery.  Probably the worst Rogue beer I've had in years."
"30"
"A well rounded beer with a nice balance of malt and hops.  Rich tasting for a red ale, but doesn't become bitter towards the end."
"Not your average red beer. But what else would you expect from Rogue? Hearty body and highly hopped."
