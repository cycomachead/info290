Maybe it was more hoppy back in October, but whatever was there is mostly gone by now. What's left is good and certainly drinkable, but it's more malty than hoppy these days. Regardless, a hell of a beer.","TheSixthRing","Apr 04, 2014"
4.06,5.7,3.5,3.75,4.25,4.5,4,"Overall – While the “hoppy” in the name was never really delivered to a full extent, the boozy, fruity, and oak were very much big and monstrous, but in a rather nice way. Overall it is big, malty, and boozy with lots of oak flavors which makes for a rather nice slow sipper.  Super delisious!!","Darkmagus82","Apr 03, 2014"

3.98,3.6,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its taste. There is this wonderful buttery and oaky woodiness that plays fantastically with the hearty, heavy, warming amber, red, and caramel malt base of the beer. These both blend with a certain oily bitterness of the hops that, although is surprisingly light, can’t easily be shaken free. The oak is also nicely representative in the nose, but here the hops are very, very hard to discern, making it a bit of a surprise that they are found in the flavoring at all. This is a tasty beer, but you’ve got to be a fan of a beer with an intensely malty base, big wood, and a lightness of hops. While it doesn’t improve upon or change the rules of the style, it is still an enjoyable find and an interesting review.","TheBrewo","Mar 26, 2014"

4.37,13.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.25,"Deep orange -amber body was a little cloudy. The barrel aging seems to have taken out some of the fizz, as the beer was lightly carbonated, and the head was less than one finger thick, and faded rapidly. The smell was very typical IPA at first sniff, with pine resin being prevalent. Deeper breaths indicated more of the vanilla, brown sugar, and toffee from the wood tannin influence. Taste was a lot more mellow than I remember the regular BHM to be. There were clearly a lot of hops, but they had melded much better with the sweeter flavors emerging from the liquid touching oak barrels. There was some brown sugar, vanilla, raisins, and butterscotch flavors coming right behind the spicy hops. The finish revealed more of the dry, oak driven tannin tastes. The finish finished quite dry and sawdust like. A little thinner than the regular monster across the tongue. I usually am not a big fan of oak aging, but Terrapin seems to have used the emerging characteristics to enhance than overpower the original beer's characteristics. The result is rounder, mellower, and more pleasing.","rajendra82","Mar 13, 2014"

Terrapin did a really nice job covering up the alcohol bite considering an abv that almost hits 11%. This is a beer you need to sip on and not race to finish..Despite the name the one thing i will argue that this is not by any means a big hoppy monster of a beer haha...If this beer where named...perhaps...."Wood Burner Imperial Red Ale", it would match the flavor profile a hell of a lot better haha.... I didn't think I would like this with because i haven't liked a lot of things Terrapin has put out, but this is such a deep, complex beer that needs to be drank slow and appreciated for what it is.

The flavor profile starts with malty sweetness (the sweetness could also be attributed to the mild vanilla notes) and then gives way to the hop bitterness. There is certainly a slight alcohol burn on the finish, but it is not terribly unpleasant. The oak aging appears to have smoothed out the alcohol bite, but it may also have muted the hop profile.","57md","Jan 07, 2014"

Very nice, but worrying there may be too much oak. Candy sweetness up front, not much hop bite or flavor. A very nice mellow vanilla left on the palate that I really like here though. Maybe a hint of dark cherry. Not like anything I have had before. Sweet, bordering on too much so but the smooth finish dials it back a bit. Slick resiny mouthfeel. Interesting. As a red ale, this kills it, but classified here as a DIPA it would seem to miss the mark. I don’t think I could classify this as a DIPA, so yum.","BMMillsy","Oct 16, 2013"

3.75,-2.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, amber coloring with golden highlights around the edges and a thin, filmy, bubbly, off-white head on the pour that disappears almost immediately. Aromas of tangy sweet notes forward, with grapefruit highlighting caramel and toffee. Roasted notes are subtle, with some woody notes buried deep in there, as well. Flavors are hop forward, with a bitter and peppery blast being followed immediately by a rich, sugary, roasted caramel backbone. Pulls together nicely. The oak characteristics take a greater hold about mid-palate, providing a balance to the strong, robust hop and malt characteristics. Some tropical fruit notes highlight towards the middle to end of the palate, where there is also two building forces of spice and booze. This thing is layered, and it is a beast. Mid-bodied, yet light considering all the big flavor profiles. The pepper really draws the line between the palate and the aftertaste, clearing the field for a tangy sweet blend of caramel and tropical fruit. Slick, lingering finish, with a slow building warmth from the elevated ABV. This one is fun, but it's a workout for your taste buds, too. Be prepared to sip and absorb.","GarthDanielson","Oct 14, 2013"

Oak is throughout, leaving this dry and a bit tannic in the finish along with a good bit of lingering bitterness.

While most of the hops have faded from the aroma, they are still apparent in the flavor, though not in a big, brash, "American" sort of way.

Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, caramel, citrus, citrus hop, and oak. The flavor was of sweet malt, oak, caramel, citrus, citrus hop, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If you would have not have told me this one was oak aged, I would have definitely been able to figure it out based on my first sip. The oak in this one was so strong on the flavor it wasn’t even funny. I’m sure it covered up some subtle flavors, but I do know this is what Terrapin was aiming for when they did this brew. The aroma was quite nice with the citrus going on and really kept it interesting. Glad I finally got the opportunity to try this and hope I get to try more of Terrapin’s specially treated brews out there.","thagr81us","Dec 31, 2012"

Nice smoothly carbonated mouthfeel gives way to nicely balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness on the palate. Smooth.

4.09,6.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Oak Aged Big Hoppy Monster pours a pretty clear ruby red, with some lighter red highlights. About two fingers of off white foam tops the beer, hanging around for a little bit before leaving a few chunks of lacing clinging to the glass. The nose is really nice, with aromas of caramel and oak mingling and playing off of a bit of resinous, piney hops. The flavor starts off with a healthy dose of caramel sweetness. A brief, but bracing bitterness follows, before allowing those same piney hops to come in. The finish though is straight oak, and a little more intense than is probably necessary. The body, while sturdy, stops well short of being syrupy or too heavy. The carbonation is definitely on the low side, in fact I'd probably say just a little too much. While this fresh bottle of oaked Big Hoppy Monster is drinking nicely, I think six months to a year of time will do some favors for the other bottle I have on hand.","axeman9182","Dec 16, 2012"

Taste is more of the same, as is mouthfeel, as a sturdy, heavy but easy passing beer goes over my tongue with a mix of grapefruit like hops, sugary sweetness, touch of oakiness and a dry, sturdy finish. Hops flavor profile is mostly like a wet, grape variety, and the malts are caramel and other sweetness and the beer is not too complex but has a good amount of depth. The dry finish is a great complement to a good beer and this is a very enjoyable sipper.","clayrock81","Dec 08, 2012"

The hop presence had mellowed and it drank like a barleywine/old ale. The oak aged version also is reminiscent of a barleywine, which is a good thing as its one of my favorite styles. As of now, I like the original BHM more. However, Im gonna try to grab a couple more of these to let them cellar for a while. I imagine this one will age really well, mellowing out the hops and bringing out some of the malt flavors. At 9% with big boozy notes, this one might age well for a year or two.

3.67,-4.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Some oak jobs I love and some, well... I found this top by a bit over-the-top. Personally, I would be much happier to have just the plain ole', regular BHM.","ChainGangGuy","Jan 09, 2009"
3.91,1.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,"D - 2 is my limit, before I need a couple pints of water. It's really nice, but you can't have that much of it.","Patrick999","Dec 20, 2008"
4.56,18.8,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep ruby with brown highlights. Smaller off white head without much lacing. Smell is remarkable. The oak is in no way overpowering and adds another level of complexity to this already great beer. Brings out more of a pineapple scent on top of the base smell. Still caramel and that lovely brown sugar. Also pine and light citrus hops. Seems like there are even hints of coconut. Very light oak and wood presence. Just lovely. Taste is much of the same. This is one beer that I almost wish there was more oak presence, which is seldom the case as many are overdone. Still, very nice and gives the regular flavors a chance to shine while adding complexity. Great mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Moderate bitterness balanced with the malt sweetness. Not too thick and just about perfect. I could have had a couple more pints of this one. It is easily approachable and the oak flavor is in no way dominating. Very, very great beer. Who would have thought Big Hoppy could get much better? It does.","ncvbc","Dec 03, 2008"
4.26,10.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: Had two pints before hitting the door. Will revisit this one again before they blow out the keg. My only wish is this one showed a bit more of the wood. That being said, it is my favorite Terrapin brew to date.","tpd975","Nov 28, 2008"
4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"When all was said and done, this was easily one of my favorite beers of late. I would love to and , and plan on having this one again very soon. Solid from top to bottom.","mikesgroove","Nov 28, 2008"
4.03,4.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: About as drinkable as the regular Big Hoppy, with a nice added tasty bonus. Abv% is still up there, but it's also well-hidden, and it's about as tasty and aromatic as the original too - the barrel aging adds precisely what you'd imagine it would. So it's nice, but not amazing.","CrellMoset","Nov 22, 2008"
4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D- It was a great experience to try the oak aged version of this beer and its a very good beer, but I think I prefer the fresh hoppy flavors of this one in comparison to old hops with a nice oak aged flavor component. Still great to try this rare beer.","PittBeerGirl","Nov 18, 2008"
4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,3,"Notes: One hell of a beer and an instant classic for hop heads. I was glad to have tried it even if I am not among the hop heads.","adamette","Nov 14, 2008"
4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a very good beer. I don't know if they are bottling this, but if they are, pick some up. Or just grab a pint next time you are at BSP.","gabeerfan","Nov 10, 2008"
4.47,16.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability is great. I would've had a few more of these had I not had a few others on my must-try list. Definitely give this one a shot if you see it around.","glid02","Nov 09, 2008"
4.38,14.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I'm probably biased as BHM is my favorite Terrapin brew, but I really, really like this beer and I was floored at how much the floral hops showed throw even with the oak aging. A fantastic beer.","gford217","Nov 07, 2008"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"D - This is a complex beer worth trying. I enjoyed drinking it slowly. Between the alcohol and the richness, one is enough.","GJ40","Nov 07, 2008"
