"im not sure why i expected less, or not much at all from these guys, but both beers ive had from them have been fantastic. this one less so than the bedlam, but its great. a real hoppy coppery red beer with a ton of honey textured resins and just the right amount of both residual sugar and bitterness. its definitely west coast in its approach to the hopping, and it takes this red beer to a place these dont often go, almost an ipa, which is awesome for me. caramel malt has biscuity properties too, layered, maybe some oats in here too as there is plenty of body. fuller body, carbonation thats alive, and a lingering hoppy finish that attaches to the sweetness on the tongue in a real nice way. i need to find some more beers from these guys, they have made a huge impression on me out of nowhere. really stoked to have found them, great beers so far."

"Pours a hazy caramel color with a 1/4"" head.  Nice hoppy aroma with a sweet and citrusy flavor. This is a good hoppy amber ale, very drinkable, went very well with the spicy food I was eating."

"By far my favorite beer from Ale Asylum. Since they went to the new brewery and bottle size, the beer tends to be a clearer in complexion, which adds to appearance, but takes away from it's mouthfeel. I reviewed the bottle, but have also had this on draft at pubs and the brewery and it's remarkably consistent. Overall, really great WI beer."

"This is a nice one! Nicely hopped while keeping an amber ale character. Well done!"
""

"Overall- Not a traditional amber by any means - very strong hop characteristics and a high ABV. If you are a fan of more traditional ambers this may not be up your alley, but a finely produced beer nonetheless. I am personally not a fan of applying 'west-coast' styles to ambers, but I can appreciate the craftsmanship."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good, but not great. Flavors are a bit muddies at times (lacking refinement). Nonetheless, drinks fine and worth a try."
""
"Cloudy amber body. Fizzy off-white head, rapidly diminishing. Aroma of orange juice, citrus, raw grain, caramel, biscuit, sweet malts. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, moderate carbonation. Sweet citrus taste with notes of caramel and orange peel. Hop bitterness with some pine resin flavor kicks in just at the right time. It lingers into the finish. Very tasty amber ale."
"Overall: I'm usually a little hesitant to go for an ""amber"" but since I heard this was well-hopped I picked up a sixer. So it's more of a amber IPA which is more of my type of beer. Ambergeddon has a solid bitterness and enough malt underneath it to still feeel like an amber, just a hopped-up one."
""
""
""
"O- Pretty tasty. Many good characteristics, and I like how it's more malt forward."
""
""
""
"Ambergeddon pours a darkish cloudy reddish color with a small but lasting and lacing head. There is a nice bold hoppy and malty aroma. The taste is bold, good malt backbone, with strong floral hop flavors. Drinkable and strong bold flavors. Overall a high quality red ale."
""
"The Ambergeddon is a good amber ale....probably one of the better ones I have tried. The beer poured a nice clear amber with frothy head that was leaving some lace. The scent carried some hops which really elevated its score. The taste had plenty of malt, slightly sweet, yet finished bitter. The mouthfeel was medium in body with good carbonation. Overall this was a good offering."
""
""
"Overall: after the wake-up call on the first pull, I really enjoyed the good flavors and balance. A very good amber that I will stock in my fridge."

"Overall: I really like it. As far as ambers go, this is on the bitter side but definitely not either in a bad way or in an unbalanced way (for instance, a West coast amber). Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the best local option for an Amber that I can get. It deserves the outstanding rating and takes a malty Amber to a new level with the generous dry hopping."
"O - Better than the average amber, Ambergeddon brings a little something extra to this ""catch-all"" style of beer; assertive hops meet a beefy later of maltiness but neither backs down and neither overwhelms the other for a balanced and flavorful brew!"
""
""
"Thanks to the extra from someone in Wisconsin!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good hopped up Red Ale. Kind of reminds me of Great Lakes Nosferatu. Bold hops with a big malty backing."
""
""
""
""
"O-Definitely a beer for the hophead, this one is too much for someone looking for a traditional amber ale. If the hops were toned down a bit this one has potential, just not balanced enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfectly balanced is the best description for this. This is stunning. It is hoppy, yet so masterfully balanced. This is the bier that turned me on to hoppy biers. It has all the Hops you could ever want, skips the abrasive bitterness, and still manages to do Wisconsin proud by letting that malt pop in so well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Did I say very good?!?!"
""
""
""
"Poured out as a deep red color, the head was foamy and cream colored. The lacing and retention was pretty good on this leaving streaks down the glass. The smell of the beer is hoppy, very bold aromas on this one and very inviting. The taste of the beer is nicely balanced with a malt backbone and a high bitter finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall this is probably one of the best brews that Ale Asylum makes. I found this one to be very enjoyable."
"O- If this beer came to my distribution area I would pick it up again a very solid local treat."

"Like a pumped up amber. I liked this a bit better than A did."
""
"O - not a bad beer at all. seems a bit heavy on the abv for a red, but i can't complain about a complimentary buzz! could use a little more work on the head, maybe more profound taste characteristics."
""
"M: A bit too watery for me. Good coating, but at the expense of odd body. Good aftertaste flavors."
""
""
"O- a nice beer, wish I had this super fresh as I imagine this one has been around a couple of months. Solid beer, but won't seek it out as it's not distributed in CO"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good drinkable brew although not without some faults. The aftertaste is so overpowering, I'm not sure I could drink this all night. Overall though it's a hoppy amber which is always good in my world."
""
"O: A good refreshing amber, its a quaffing ale."
""
""
"Overall very interesting - like nothing I've ever had before. Much sweeter, maltier, and hoppier than a traditional amber. I liked it! Would drink again."
"Pours a mostly clear amber, frothy off white bubbly head and lots of lacing. Aroma is IPA like, herbal and spicy from the hops employed. In the taste, a nice earthy bitterness, resinous and somewhat sticky then leading to drying grapefruit rind. Caramel malts make up for most of the body, and leave a nice rich base for the hops to shine. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with ample carbonation. Overall, a very nice hoppy amber, worth keeping a few on hand."

"At nearly 7%, this is another example of a great American ale that blurs the line of category....call it a red ale, an IPA or a PA...I call it damn good and for $8.99 a bargain. Wisconsin scores!"
""
"Another gem, picked up from the brewery. A great mix of hops and malting with a showcase fruitiness. Good to the last drop. Citrus, peach, smooth mouthfeel though numbing of the palate followed. Tasty stuff, with a mild hoppy aroma. Red tinge. Very good for the style."
""
""
""
"O - pretty good west coast style amber. It was a bit harsh at times, but still enjoyable. I don't think I'll be buying it again though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium bodied with a blast of bitter, earthy hops up front that linger over the sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry finish. This is countered by a sweet citrus hop presence with hints of orange peel and grapefruit. Malt backbone with hints of rye, caramel and biscuit. Sessionable and easy to drink but not overly complex."
"It reminded me of a brown ale with an IPA kick. My initial taste was of malts that are very similar to a brown or amber ale but then a hoppy bitterness took over that was similar to a Pale Ale. It lacked the citrus taste though that I really like in that type of beer. Also, a little watery feel slipped in on the back end of each drink. Still though, a very solid local beer."
"O - Something falls short when you sip this one, smells so good, tastes so bland (comparatively). This beer is available everywhere in Madison it seems, so it's a good one to grab when lacking options. I'd rather drink Hopalicous (or better yet, Bedlam) though."
"I'm glad I got to try this one. The hype is deserved."
"Good brew. Maybe it was starting with this brew that made me susceptible to the alcohol taste, but as I drink it gets more tolerable with each passing sip."
"Pours a hazy reddish copper with a tan head left all over the glass. Looks really fantastic, actually. The nose is light caramel and biscuit mixed with piney-orange hops. Smells real nice. This is an amber with bite. Fairly substantial, generic hop bitterness, maybe a touch of pine or grass combine nicely with those light caramel and biscuit flavors. Just a touch of a slightly off flavor through the middle of this beer. Can't really place it. Drinks easy with a bit of a punch. Pretty light on the palette for the ABV. Overall, this is a nice take on an amber that is a nice drinker."
"My first beer from Ale Asylum and it's a good one. Much better than the mediocre Amber's most brewer's put out as their flagship beer."
"Overall - High quality beer from a local brewer that's largely overshadowed by better known high-quality local brewers. This is probably their best known offering, though, with a well deserved following."
"Having recently tried Ale Asylum's Hopalicious for the first time and loved it, I was a bit disappointed by this offering. My mouth wanted the citrus hop burst that the nose suggested, but it never happened. And the hop flavor that is presented has a reserved quality to it that isn't helped by the watery sensation of it. Overall, it has fairly decent balance of flavors and pretty nice complexity...I just wish the flavors were more pronounced."
"Dripping with hop flavor, the taste of Ambergeddon is well-balanced by nutty, almost husky malt grains. A flash of minerals hits mid-sip before a light, tingling bitterness graces the back of the palate. The flavors work well together, but something seems a bit muted about the whole experience. Mouthfeel is soft on the carbonation and thinner than expected for the style and ABV. I found this to be a decent Amber, but probably not something I'll be seeking out again. Still, I'd definitely buy it off the shelf if given the opportunity."
"O: Ale Asylum impresses me more and more as I try a variety of what they have to offer. This is an excellent representation of an amber/red ale."
"O: This is one unique brew. Almost a brown ale disgiused as an amber. I'm on the fence with this one, but I dig and reward originality, and this one is definately original. Go get it. Skal."
"The cpj"
"D=Sharp bitterness at first made this hard to drink quickly; also, the high ABV will limit the number you can drink."
"The flavor is a bit grainy and slightly metallic. Certainly too many tannins in this one. The husk presence really comes through and is not terribly enjoyable, detracting from the underlying amber malt and breadiness. The finish is harsh and bitter. Unfortunately, something went seriously wrong in the process of this one."
"D: This glass was extremely enjoyable, and I would love to have another... if only I was in WI!"
"D- Another Wisconsin brewery that has started to step up its game. A little more hoppy than the style suggests but that seems to be a common trend. I am going to have to make it to Madison one of these days to try some of their beers on tap."
"Cloudy reddish brown color amber ale poured into an Imperial pint glass. Retention is awesome. Sweet tones of caramel, sugars, and orange blend well with the malts. For an amber, I was surprised by the amount of citrus in the taste but is soon taken over by the bitterness which slightly hindered it's drinkability."
"Drinkability is good, only hurt by that bitterness that lingers."
"If you are a beer lover in Wisconsin this is a must try beer. It pours a dark amber color and has a heavy scent of hops. I delivers a heavy taste full of flavor but finishes very smooth. All ba's this is a must try!"
"Drinkability: This beer isn't going to win any awards for huge, over the top flavor...but it is perfect for relaxing on a summer night with some dinner and a movie. Very sessionable, and very drinkable."
"D - A solid effort from the folks at Ale Asylum. I'd be willing to drink it more often if that didn't require a trip to Wisconsin."
"Pours a nice hazy amber color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, slightly hoppy, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"SkÅL!"
"Taste is very clean with a hop and malt profile. These hops are different than IPA blend. I have not had any beers of this type so I find the taste unique. It reminds me of some lagers. The finish is too astringent for me but I think it is true to type. Not my favorite style but I think this is a good example. Congrats to Ale Asylum for a fine lineup."
"D: Nothing out of the ordinary here either good or bad and not much else to say. A solid beer which is very nice and easy drinking. I'd definitely have it again but wouldn't go out of my way for it. Super badass name and label though!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's a great tasting and easy drinking beer. A very nice beer overall that I really enjoyed."
"Nicely drinkable and a well crafted hoppy amber. Recommended."
"M & D: Definitely substantial body, but far from heavy. Another awesome brew from Ale Asylum!"
"D - I would pick this one up again and keep some on hand. Very nice brew."
"Recently had on-tap at the brewpub and reviewing from a fresh bottle purchased close to the source. Much more hop forward beer fresh. Nice citrus and pine hop qualities. The appearance needs a little bump in the score as well. A very fine amber ale."
"Enjoyed on tap at Ale Asylum in Madison, WI. Pours a hazy, dark amber body with an off-white head that lasts. Aroma is of light caramel with floral hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with toasted caramel flavors and a nice bitterness in the finish. Great drinkability, I'd buy a 6 pack of this."
"A really well done Amber Ale here, that packs some West Coast hop attitude and an easy drinking nature into one tight little package. Another solid selection from these guys."
"Drinkability: it is fairly sessionable."
"Final thoughts: A very nice drinkable amber ale. It has a nice malty amber backbone, adds a touch of sweetness and barelywine style malt/fruity sweetness, and has some nice hop layers. Bitterness and refreshing tastes trade off almost as if they were battling for your mouth's enjoyment, like two gladiators."
"Thanks for the opportunity, Andy. I may have to get some more from these guys on our next trade!"
"drinkability is good. an excellent amber: well balanced and mellow on the palate with just enough flavor to give it character."
"Pours a clear, amber/brown color. 1/2 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, roasted malt, nut, and sweet malt. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and slight citrus. Overall, a really good beer that I highly recommend."
"A great beer all around, I love what Ale Asylum did with this amber ale. They really gave it some character. SO many flavors but quite complimentary towards each other. I could drink one or 8 of these, no prob."
"D: I was expecting more of a hop kick from this beer based on the description. Having said that, I really enjoyed it and knocked it back so quickly, I was sad that I didn't have another. I am really developing a taste for reds that have an American IPA aggressiveness to them."
"D- a great hoppy red. wish i could find some more of this. a little strong to session but a few in a sitting would be cool."
"The best beer I've tasted from Ale Asylum which I'd recommend to anyone looking for a hoppy amber. Nice job Ale Asylum."
"4.5 sort of like an SNPA very pleasantly amped up and dried out, and with a little more complexity (that might make it sound pretty unlike an SNPA after all, but there really is a significant shared core of flavor, but here everything that dissappoints me in the sn offering is remedied here and augmented with strengths). this is really good stuff, worth seeking out."
"Ale Asylum Ambergeddon is a clear, amber (almost copper) ale with a thin, splotchy off-white head with a bunch of oily bubbles on it. It leaves nice lacing on the glass. There's a lot of yeast in the bottom of the bottle. It has a huge, fresh hoppy aroma. It's piny and resiny with a hint of tangerine. The malt smells biscuity and a hint sweet. It smells like an IPA. It's medium bodied and incredibly smooth with a very clean finish. I taste a lot of hops (simcoe?). The caramelly malt flavor comes in at the finish. This is very good. It really seems like an IPA."
"D- Too much of a hop emphasis, while it looks like an amber ale it drinks more like a pale ale with the relatively high hop presence, needs more malt balance"
"Pours a very slightly hazed amber color, with a bit of brown in the middle, some copper highlights on the edges. A nice white head 1-1.5 cm sits on top, which drops down to a dense little puck on top, leaving pretty good lacing. The smell is of toasty malts, a bit of caramel and toffee, some smells of lightly grassy hops, and I get some tart fruits, like cherries, oranges, and underripe magoes. The taste starts out with a little citrus peel bitterness, and it quickly turns into a dry, toasty breadiness, like crackers. Then it moves into a grassy, almost resinous taste as it goes down. I kind of expected more sweetness, but there's just enough to carry the flavor without the grassy taste getting out of hand. I like it. The hops contribute to the body, but it just doesn't quite do enough to help to forget about the slight watery feel to this. The carbonation is good though, zippy. And it actually warms me a little and kind of fills me up. The drinkability is good. You wouldn't think it was a 6.8%-er. Very pleasant and enjoyable at points, but it didn't quite blow me away. I would recommend it if you came in here - this or one of the belgians (which I only got a taste of, but it seemed enjoyable)."
"D: Quite easy to drink, though I'm not sure I'd necessarily trade for this."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. The red ale appears a hazed medium copper color with a full inch of lingering, dense bone white foam. A nice lace is left on the inside of my glass with each sip. Aromas and flavors consist of citrus such as tangerines and grapefruit juice, mild pineapple, sweet caramelized malt, a bit earthy. Pleasantly bitter and sweet throughout, with a good body and ample carbonation. This almost gives Nugget Nectar a run for the money."
"This is one hell of an amber ale that becomes more and more enjoyable as it warms. The most comparable beer to this would be Nugget Nectar, but I prefer this beer as it's got the great hop profile but isn't as sweet."
"D: From the smell, I was fully into this beer. But the taste threw me off a little bit. I hope the odd-looking sediment wasn't affecting this, but I'm not wholly sure. I'd be willing to give this one another try to confirm this. Good beer though, and worth a try."
"This is a solid brew that very drinkable. It's not extraordinarily complex, but it's got enough flavor to make it a very good beer."
"D--Nice sessionable amber ale here. Would be a good dinner beer, but not something to go out of your way for. This is my second Ale Asylum beer and both of them have been good so far, I'm going to check out more from the brewery."
"Nicely drinkable. Bigger then a session beer, but I could sit and have a couple."
"Very good beer. I recall it being even better on tap, & I'm looking forward to an excuse to head east from MN to try this again out of the fountain."
"(D) A good drinkable brew. Smells fantastic, but a little let down with taste."
"Very good red ale, I would buy it again in large quantities."
"D - Hoppy version of an amber that goes down way too easy."
"Overall, a great beer. I remember my visit to Ale Asylum fondly, and this was probably my favorite on that day. It certainly hadn't let me down on this second try."
"D - This is a great amber ale. It really has a great hop character that is rare for the style."
"This is one of our favorite beers in the summer, along with there Hopalicious! I would recommend trying this if your in town. Very drinkable but at 6.8% It can sneak up on you."
"Bold taste. Biting roast malt with some sweetness that gets crushed by herbal and grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is ok but should be beefed up to coincide with robust flavor. I'm bummed that the actual ""amber"" in ambergeddon was so overshadowed by the hops. I'll get you hopheads someday."
"D - I was expecting something a little more hop-forward, but instead I got something pretty sweet and caramely and syrupy. While there is a hop presence, it's a bit muddled and buried by the hops. With that said, it's not a bad pale ale overall."
"D-I'd drink this again...well done amber ale...only complaint is the somewhat thinish body....liked their pale ale a little more but this is a quality brew too."
"Picked up a 6-pack tonight from Discount - lots of dust on the bottle's shoulder/neck. Beer seems fine - pours a nice darkish copper color with a decent head that settles to a nice skim. Smells inviting with a menagerie of tropical fruits, some sweetness and citrus hops. Taste is a nice balance of hops and malts battling it out with bready malts hitting your palate upon entry and then a piney hop bitterness taking over at the back end. Medium bodied with a nice mouth feel and a respectable, semi-lingering finish. Overall a well made, easy to drink brew that I could see myself reaching for on a regular basis."
"A Grade-A brew that I otherwise may have never tried if it wasn't for a Wisconsin friend's generosity. He shipped a well-packaged case all the way to Virginia. Now that's beer advocacy!"
"Good brew."
"Muddled dark copper. Slight bubbly off white head. Lace coems in moderate amounts of ring patterns. Nice combination of malt and hop aromas. Malt aromas are warm and biscuity. Hop aromas are citric and piney. Base malt character on the buds is caramel. Hop attributes are piney and grassy. A slight bitterness lingers. Nicely balanced and flavorful. Solid beer all around."
"Notes from and tasted on 7/23/07"
"M&D - pretty good, not a session beer, a bit too much bite without a balancing characteristic to me, but a good dinner beer, i see it paired with fish and veggies. mmm..."
"D - it goes down very easy."
"I like it more than a few other ""american ambers", but maybe I got an old bottle since there's no best by date."
"This beer pours a cloudy deep amber color. The head is a fluffy one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine resin, caramel malt, and toffee. The taste is slightly hoppier than the aroma, but is still quite balanced. Pine, caramel, citrus, and nuts. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and lively carbonation. Overall, this is one very fine amber ale. I would love to drink this beer again."
"D -Though large ABV, still very attractive in more than one category."
"A three finger biscuity tan head hosts rocky bubbles that crackle as they fade leaving some lace. Body is a deep burnt orange amber. Nose is considerably hoppy for the style but this seems to be the trend. Includes a bit of a sweet malt balance. First sip shows some smooth hops that thin out a bit, or yet lengthens on the tongue. Could use a bit of malt to balance on the palate. This drinks more like an IPA then an amber. Hops are on the sweeter side in mid-palate. Finish has a bit of bitter on the mouthfeel. Overall this is clean drinking enjoyable beer. Solid."
"** As I drank this I could only think how similiar this was, for me at least, to Surly Furious."
"Update: March 2009, still love it, upped the drinkability by .5, ratebeer notes this as at 6.9% abv, I believe that is true. A very good amber."
"Overall I thought this was an excellent beer. Something a little bit more hoppy then the style usually commands, but still very well done indeed. I would have no issues at all with having this one around on a constant basis, as it was just that good. Kudos to them for coming up with a great little beer here. I need to find me some more of this one as well."
"D: Perfect for tailgating...enough said."
"Poured in american pint glass. Red to amber with a thin white head that falls off fast. Laces largely. Smells appropriately hoppy, slightly citrusy. Taste is a quick, punchy bitterness, with nice hints of orange and caramel malt. Maltiness is subtle but provides a nice base to the hops. Biscuity, earthy notes mix with the hops on the back end. Crisp and bitter and a good, easy drinking beer. Quite nice."
"Pours a cloudy, deep amber color which left a frothy 1/2 inch head. Good retention. I really enjoy the smell of this one; sweet malts fuse with citrusy hops to create a wonderful aroma. The taste is kind of similar; it starts off with a nice bite of caramel malt and followed up with a grapefruity bitterness. My only complaint here is there seems to be a watered-down taste that comes through. Maybe it's just me. The body is medium with a crisp finish. This is my first experience with anything from Ale Asylum and I'm sure to check out a few more of their offerings!"
"An awesome Amber."
"Pours a cloudy reddish orange, tight off white head forms, settles to a thin layer and thick ring around the glass, drops some decent lace spots. Smell is nice, very malty, caramel, biscuits, nice floral hoppiness, some citrus, light grapefruit, honey, some fruits, reminds me of Hop Devil a bit. Taste is similar, caramel malts - toffee cake beginning, honey dates, some lemony citrus kick, oranges and grapefruit, lots of fruit and floral, bit of tartness in the finish, nicely balanced and highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. This is pretty damn smooth and drinkable, with enough character to keep me interested!"
"D-Nugget Nectar has found it's WI brother. How could I not love this beer?!"
"Very well done, this is what I believe an american amber should be like. I need to find out the ABV; if this one is reasonably low, it will make for a nice session beer."
"The mouthfeel is a bit slighter than what I was expecting - plenty of carb. Drinkable, if your looking for for an amber in my part of the world there are plenty of options. With a name like ambergeddon I was again maybe not expecting something this drinkable - could be a session, but there are tons of ambers that are much more memorable(Capitol Lakefront Sprecher in my part of the world alone)"
"D: A great beer for warm weather sessioning."
"Pretty good overall. Not a Nugget Nectar, which is probably my favorite ""big red", but I would certainly drink again. As my only complaint, it was a bit sweeter, more malt influenced than I care for."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a whole evening."
" ~ I'm very impressed with this Ale Asylum brew. I wish I had tried a tap of it when I was at the Brewpub about a month ago. Next time I'll know."
"A bit on the tannic side, possibly just an oiliness from the hops manifesting themselves that way. Still, it's medium bodied and would be an easy choice for an all-purpose session beer. Well done."
"I was a little disappointed in this beer based on its previous ratings. To me, this is an above average amber ale, but not a great one."
"Now I don't feel bad passing this up the first time I saw it in Madison. Hopalicious is the clear winner from Ale Asylum for me, although I haven't tried their stout yet."
"Very enjoyable. It's the first brew I've had from Ale Asylum and I'm looking forward to trying the other two that are currently available in bottles- the nut brown and the pale ale."
"Pretty clear, reddish amber colour with a cap of thin beige foam. Some sticky lace and the fine bubbles stuck around once they settled to a collar. Fruity aroma, some orange and sweetness with caramel, slight alcohol. Floral notes too. Candy sweetness up front, fruity tangerine, bitterness appeared towards the end and was a little aggressive/sharp/piney. Alcohol and warmth appeared in the finish along with lingering, earthy bitterness. Medium bodied, good texture, a little creamy with average carbonation. Pretty good drinkability, not overly complex (didn't need to be), well made and tasty."
"D:Good, Really weel blanced. The hops are especially delicious and interesting in this brew."
"A gem from WI if you have a chance to try I'd say go for it, particularly if you love hops!"
"overall a decent amber. good mouthfeel and pretty easy to drink, not heavy and pretty refreshing."
"Poured with a HUGE tan head. Very impressive, and nice retention. Crystal clear except for the sediment that I poured in. Nice amber color. No aroma that I could detect. Taste was nicely balanced with hops and malt, and little more of the hops on the finish, which I liked. Light body with very little carbonation, but enough to keep it from seeming flat. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is very nice. Each time I have this beer, I reach for a second one, as soon as I finish the first."
"Highly recommended. This has always been a boring style for me, but this beer is most definitely not boring. If all ambers tasted this good, I'd be drinking them much more frequently."
"This beer is quite nice, though a bit hard to explain. I wish I coud have a few of these right now."
"pours a cloudy amber with a minimal off-white head and decent lacing. caramel, dark fruit, and a vague medicinal smell in the nose..was this one a bit off? not a bad nose overall, but not sure they were going for the funky medicinal/spicy/band aid aromas. taste is nicely balanced between a moderate malt sweetness and moderate hop bitterness. soft mouthfeel and light to medium in body. i presume this is under 6% abv making it pretty drinkable."
"A very pleasant ruby red-amber color with a relatively brilliant finish, but a limited amount of carbonation, from the look of it. Aroma is what I think an amber ale should be - a nice blend of caramel and hoppiness bound together so thoroughly you can't really tell where one ends and the other begins. Flavor is pronounced hoppiness...not really true to style (IMO) but delicious nonetheless. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky, like a pretty good IPA. I like this beer quite a bit."
"I really like this beer--poured well with a clean, strong white head with tight bubbles the held on for a long time. Very aggressive hop nose, citrus and grapefruit, and big sweet abundant malt as a base to the IPA level of hops. This amber beer with gold highlights looks good in the glass and disappeared quickly. Listed as American Amber, which it doesn't really fit but not sure if there's a style name for it yet--I've seen Imperial Red or Double Pale Ale on similar beer. Flying Dog Double Dog seems similar, and it becoming a favorite style of mine, whatever it is."
"4/ 4/ 4.5/ 4.5/ 4"
"No problem drinking a couple of these after I got to my final destination. But the question remains, is it an amber? To me I would describe it as American strong ale more like an Arrogant Bastard or a Eye of the Hawk than the typical amber. I'll buy more if and when I find it again."
"Enjoyed as warm-up prior to a great Mexican dinner with my wife and a friend at Autentica. Thanks, Tom, for sending this a while back."
"Moderate in to and across the mouth. For a beer as dynamic as this, the structure seems a bit spare. But that may indeed be its glory. The slightly thin feel enables this to be gulped, if not ultimately inhaled and drowned upon."
"Decent, malty, and hoppy reddish amber ale. Maybe a touch too carbonated. This is definitely the best beer from the brewery I've had so far. Served with a decent head that mostly faded after a bit. Don't notice the alcohol right off. After a couple o swallows there's a warming sensation. Definitely servicable. *urp*"
"Easy drinking, nice hop head flavors - but not complex and profound as I would have hoped based on the name and description."
"D: Definitely beats your run of the mill amber. Stands out from the pack in my opinion."
"Ambergeddon more than lives up to its name and its label. My bottle is at least several months old so I can't imagine what this beer tastes like right out of the hopper. If I could rub a genie's lamp right about now, my first wish would be for this 12 ounce bottle to turn into a bomber. My second wish would be for distribution to Iowa. My third? Oh, I don't know... home delivery sounds good."
"My first beer from Ale Asylum and hopefully not my last. I'm a sucker for hoppy reds and this hits the nail on the head. Excellent."
"Great brew ale asylum, keep 'em coming"
"Overall: A very solid beer. Nothing I can complain about, I've now had this in the bottle and on-tap, both are equally delicious. My favorite of their line-up."
"Pours an excellent orange and amber color with a big white head that left great lacing and retained very well. Smell is full of pungent grapefruit and citrus hops. The beer was poured cold into a regular pint glass, not exactly the best for accenting aromas, but it still had plenty of aroma coming right to me. Taste has a good malt background, even a touch of biscuit in there while still having the hops be the leaders. It was nice to be able to have a malt background and still be pummeled with hops, one of the hoppier beers I've had as of late. Higher than medium bodied with medium carbonation levels, just seemed to fit very well with this one. Very drinkable, I could drink this by the pitcher, and perhaps I'll just have to do that next time. Excellent beer here, this is worth seeking out."
"The crossed-pistols and single-gold-toothed skull on the black and gold label seem to imply a ""take no prisoners"" / ""live life on your own terms"" attitude, and the beer itself carries that message through. It's a hazy chestnut with glowing orange highlights beneath a frothy head of ivory. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves impressive lacing at the outset of the glass, followed by thin curtains of torn lace as you progress through the glass. Pungent, sharp, tart grapefruit leaps out at you in the nose, backed only by a whispy curtain of pine and a delicate waft of lightly caramelish maltiness. In the mouth it's medium bodied and creamy-smooth with a very-fine bubbled, moderate natural-carbonation from bottle-conditioning. The flavor offers more grapefruit, and a touch of pine, but it's at least somewhat reigned in by balancing malt. It's sweetish, but just enough to balance it and keep the resinousy hops afloat; and it's caramelish, falling somewhere between medium and medium-dark. A bold bitterness anchors it from a malty-sweet side, but the hop flavors are let loose to run free. Intense! It's initially like squeezing a fistfull of wet hops, but that gives way to more maltiness as you get further into it. It seems to have a bit of strength to it, but the alcohol never really shows. I'd like it to be more rounded, but I'm not sure how that could be possible without losing a bit of what it already has going for it. And I wonder how drinkable it could be on a pint to pint basis? For the hop heads of the world, here's to you!!!"
"Extremely drinkable. Unlike other APA's I've had recently that seem to follow this grapefruit and pine path, this is by far the smoothest, mellow, and delicious. A new top 10 for me."
"Drinkability/Overall: one of those 'West-coast' ambers that some may say 'cheat' with the aggressive hopping, but when it tastes this good, who the hell cares? This sits right at the top of the amber style for me, and when bottled (within the month) and more widely-distributed, will undoubtedly become a staple in my beer fridge. Look out, Two-Hearted."
"Drinkability: A solid beer--one that speaks to Dean at Ale Asylum's desire to offer a variety of full-bodied beers with exceptional flavor. The hop profile almost gives this an APA feel, though the balance of the malts shows that even the traditional aspects of amber ales can be brought to the fore through good brewing and attention to flavor. Definitely worth checking out."
"on-tap at the brewpub location"
"drinkability: very good, glad to see this one making moves on the local scene as it is a true winner"
"D-This beer was very drinkable while being a big beer in terms of flavor. Nice complex malt and big exotic hops this well worth the stop at Ale Asylum."
"Im leery of lumping hop bomb reds like this and Troegs Nugget Nectar in with the likes of Capital Amber or Leinies Red. It almost seems like cheating. Comparatively, all regular reds and ambers should get straight ones or twos when held up to imperials like this and so I find my self reviewing three styles of beer, (Amber, Red, and Imp. Red), within one category on BA. Despite my hesitancy to rate the imperials considerably higher than perfectly drinkable but much less hopped reds and ambers, I have to admit that this is one kick-but beer. Appearance is a dark amber-red with orange hues and a thin creamy off white head. Aromas of pine resin and grapefruit are strong. Malts are present but the decent toffee/caramel backbone is largely overshadowed by huge citrus hops. This beer is juicy, pulpy, 100% grapefruit. Its damn delicious, very bitter, but with a creamy finish reminiscent of Dreadnaught. I will even go as far as to say that this is the best of Ale Asylums initial 10 offerings."
