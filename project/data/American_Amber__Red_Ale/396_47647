Big balanced aromas split between herbal and citrus hops and toffee malts, plus a little dankness. Taste is early butterscotch and brown sugar sweetness mixed with orange peel bitterness and alcohol esters warm on the swallow. Medium-full bodied with a creamy and thick mouthfeel, the carbonation is low and soft.","SierraFlight","Feb 02, 2015"

Aroma is just the right amount of sweet; Caramel encrusted graham crackers, cinnamon and nutmeg. Festive aromas for sure... Flavor is a bit more serious than the smell. By that I mean its more direct. Sweet and spicy but also assertive. The high ABV is not completely hidden and reminds you that you are in fact celebrating the holidays. There's a nice fresh pile of malt under the hops and seasonings but this beer doesn't take on a heavy character at all. It's apparently strong but light and swirly in flavors. Flavors include grapefruit pulp, coniferous vegetation, nutmeg, cinnamon, honey graham crackers, and perhaps a dusting of molasses. Very pleasant drinkins... Mouthfeel is soft around the edges...smooth, finely carbonated, easy and delightful to consume.","tastybeer","0"
4.17,2,4.25,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Deep, hazy rust color topped with a densely creamy head that deposits a good amount of lacing on the glass and never quite fully disappears.  Despite being obviously hopped up, the first thing that strikes me about the aroma is a lovely graham cracker crust, brown sugar, and cake that contributes a certain warm "holiday festiveness" to the brew.  Pine needles, woody spice, and grapefruit.  Flavor is big and hoppy, but nicely balanced.  Spicy pine resin, citrus, floral hops, toasted bread, black tea, and cake.  Rich, but the solid wall of hop bitterness keeps things in balance and thus, surprisingly drinkable for 9.5%.  Not all that boozy either, though a warmth grows in the throat.  Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Seems to fit the season well.","wedge","Jan 02, 2015"

Tasted of heavy booze like it was BBA, but deceiving since it's only 8%. Very malty, with fruit subtones. Very smooth!

Dark, if clear, amber red color, kind of has a metallic sheen to it, not quite beads but lots of large, healthy bubbles swirling upwards inside the glass. Excellent balance between malts and hops in the nose, cocoa, hard coffee candy and malted milk balls interplay with sweet pink grapefruit, pine sap, lemongrass and a pinch of white pepper, basic apricot, peach to pineapple fruit yet restrained, as it gets warmer the damp herbal matter element becomes more pronounced. Full-bodied, the buoyant carbonation frames the attack and makes it less blockish and more apt to settle gently on the tongue. While the texture is dry and after 4-5 sips you start to feel a tacky residue building up, the flavors are all ripe sweetness, especially that pink grapefruit to tangelo citrus. Floral, piney, sweet and sour enough to play up papaya and pineapple over the apricot and peach. Some biscuit notes among the caramel and molasses, as in the nose saves the more bitter or leafy herbaceousness for last. Given the multitude of things going on, stays balanced and integrated and, even better, highly drinkable.","farrago","Jan 07, 2014"

Pours lightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, pine, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest/ring, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and well balanced hop and dark malt flavors; with a moderately crisp bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red! All around awesome balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV.

Aroma is herbal hops, caramel malt, some citrus. Flavor follows, with citrus and piney hops, sweet and caramel malt. Alcohol is quite noticeable. The hops are somewhat muted, perhaps because this is six month old bottle. Medium to heavy bodied and creamy. Nicely made, but the hops seem tired and aged. Worth checking a newer bottle.","LiquidAmber","Mar 03, 2012"

Color is a hazy apricot red. Aroma is hops, malt, raisins, prunes, caramel. Flavor is very similar to nose with bittersweetness on top with other qualities below. Great body and carbonation.

The aroma is quite strong--stronger than the taste. The head was very thick and lasted forever. At 8.5%, one bottle (22 oz.) leaves you feeling perfectly buzzed without being really drunk.

Caramel, sweet notes mixing with a very big hop note, especially as it warms. Piney with a sweet orange rind like citrus touch as it comes close to room temperature. Very thick feel, sticky and full with nice carbonation, definite enough to get it done. Initially you get the piney hop bite as you take the first sip, but it became very well balanced mid palate as the rich, almost scotch ale like buttery notes start to come through and really give it quite a smooth flavor. A bit hot still and a definite big one, it hurts the session ability of it a touch, and by the end you are really pushing it with this one.","mikesgroove","Mar 27, 2011"

Aroma is not as big as the taste suggests, however, nose is caramel, floral, citrus, hops, malt, and light spices. Taste picks up some mildly biter hops, a variety of spices, roasted malts, and a sweet caramel blend. Medium bodied with some dryness. Decent carbonation throughout.

Flavor is a little less sweet than the nose, more bready and toast with some brown sugar and caramel. Citrus-y hops are present in the finish with just enough bitterness to resign in the malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little thin, at least carbonation wise and ends with a slightly thin finish.

Alot of toasted malt, caramel, rich candi canes, some dark fruits, faint hops. Sweeter as it warms up. While Yulesmith Summer is hop forward, the winter version is all malts, with hops in the back. A spicy hop kick with warming, blending ever so nice with lucious malts goozing with caramel, slight chocolate and fruit taste. Some plum and a candi sweetness. A nice winter red here without the spice to qualify as a winter warmer, I like where it's at. The feel is a big medium that's glidy and more spicy with warming, carb is there but not bitey, no attack on the tounge at all while maintaining life. A nice sweet aftertaste.

Sweet caramel malts give the backbone to this hop monster. Toffee and caramel with some leather. Almost sweet enought that its on the cloying side, but straddles the line brilliantly.

4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is the Christmas version of Yulesmith (which Alesmith calls an imperial red ale); 22 oz. bottle with no vintage dating. The beer pours a highly-carbonated, hazed crimson (laced with brown) and topped with a voluminous, four-finger tan head that is almost frothy at the base, fine-bubbled at the apex, and can be teased above the rim of the glass. Loads of aroma hops contribute citrus, pine, and some fruity/woody notes, and are backed by caramel and maybe a hint of chocolate. The flavor follows suit nicely, but adds a light sweetness and some late leafy/green hops, on top of a medium, tingly and dry body. The beer is very drinkable and the hops have a huge presence, but they are not overly bitter. It is actually quite balanced for such a hoppy beer, and I think the lower ABV (for an imperial) helps them to accomplish that. Tasty and highly-recommended.","mmmbeer","Oct 16, 2010"

My personal preference would be for a tad bit more strength in the hoppy flavors, but that's just my personal preference for hops. I gave a friend a sip and she said "wow, that's a dessert" and that sums up my reluctance to give it a 5 in taste -- it was just a little bit sweeter than I like in my DIPAs.

Juicy grapefruit smell initially, followed by a warm pine resin aroma. There's some toasted character in there, but it's overshadowed by the hops. Great balance between big hop flavour and malt sweetness -- pine and orange/grapefruit on one side, malty sweetness and a bit of caramel and graham cracker on the other. Bitterness is controlled throughout and alcohol is just apparent at the finish. Medium to full bodied with very well integrated carbonation -- the fine bubbles create an exceptionally creamy texture. Slight warmth as well. At first, it seems like it'll end up syrupy and palate-coating, but ends up being surprisingly clean and balanced slightly towards dryness. Big hops, big malts, and great balance makes this a winner.","DrJay","Aug 21, 2010"

Very earthy, resiny, and complex, with a bit of dark fruits, oranges, caramel, molasses, candy, and just a touch of pine and ginger. The alcohol is there as well with gentle warming from start to finish. Thick, chewy, resiny, rich mouthfeel. This really improves as it warms up which helps the drinkability.

Awesome carb bubbles rising after the pour. Smells of great malts and hops, spices in here too and some sweets. The only gripe with the smell is it didn't represent the full taste very well, but still a great smell. Taste is huge, great hops, great malts, good holiday like spices and a lingering citrus/sweet taste that is great. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and smooth, suitable for a DIPA that I enjoy.

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery and pine hop flavors in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, a bit slick and has a good amount of carbonation.

4.56,11.5,5,4,4.5,5,5,"Winter, 2008. Well, let's see what all the fuss is about. The beer looks great. It glows amber with hints of red-orange around the edges. This version is definitely a Double Amber Ale, and I'm not quite sure why BA doesn't split the Summer and Winter into separate entries but what's done is done. The head clings to the sides of the glass in great gobs. Even a sip of beer leaves enough lacing to make me a bit confused as to where I'm drinking from on the glass. The aroma could be a touch stronger, but I enjoy the subtlety and the depth of malt balancing out the enormous hops. The hops are more orange than grapefruit and slightly piney, as well. The flavor shows off the enormous amount of sweet, caramel malt used. It gets a perfect score more for balance than any particular incredible flavor. Alesmith manages subtlety in an enormously hoppy beer, which is quite a feat and deserves its recognition. Neither the hops nor the malt are the best in the world, however the balance and subtlety are striking with such enormous flavors. This beer is not what I expected. It is distinct in a world crowded by nearly indistinguishable enormously hopped San Diego-style hoppy beers. I dearly love many of these beers, but very few of them possess YuleSmith's subtlety. I'm thankful that I've had a chance to sample many big California DIPAs because, without that experience, I'm not sure that I would appreciate AleSmith's efforts. That said, experience is also a detriment; this beer would receive a perfect taste score if Russian River and Port didn't exist. The hops are excellent but could be slightly more complex. I lean towards the floral side of hops, like those in Pliny the Elder, over these citric-pine hops. I know little about the technical side of these beers, so I'm probably misstating things. On the other hand, YuleSmith has one of the best malt characters of a hop-bomb style beer that I've ever tried. It's a truly great beer and deserves the fuss, but living in California has made me enormously nit picky about hops. Ultimately, this is great, great beer and a must for all hop lovers.","popery","Apr 12, 2010"

Finish is slightly alcoholic with cookielike malt and pine hops. Feels chewy, low-medium in carbonation and sticky.

This is just a great beer no matter how it is served.","Kegatron","Dec 14, 2009"
3.18,-22.2,4,3.5,3,4,2.5,"(2.9) Rerate: 22oz bottle. Better beige head over a rich dark red body. the butterscotch is gone, but this is still too sweet and alcoholic; the hops are there, but they just get clobbered by all the sugar and alcohol. I'll bump it up a bit, but I still feel that this is way overrated.","bulletrain76","Dec 10, 2009"
4.5,10,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bomber bottle at 42 F. Poured clear dark amber color with medium frothy off-white head that was that lasted with excellent lacing. Solid complex sour citrus and pine hop aroma. Medium to full body with smooth texture with soft carbonation. Full citrus, malt and spice flavor with a sharp bittersweet finish. Good brew that is a standout.","tmoneyba","Dec 09, 2009"
4.42,8.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"M/D - With a full body and warming finish, YuleSmith is the ideal accompaniment to any and all family gatherings. This festival ale will provide balance and peace of mind to the most unsavory situations.","hoptrip619","Dec 07, 2009"
4.15,1.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D - Pretty high in alcohol at 9.5%...goes down pretty smooth. Not at all a sipper, but if I had more than one bottle by myself, it would be a problem. Really good winter beer - just strong enough without feeling excessive. Body is really medium, but the overall feel is of a heavier beer. Heavyness limits drinkability a bit, but overall pretty smooth for a beer this strong.","portia99","Nov 28, 2009"
4.72,15.4,4,4.5,5,4,5,"OVERALL: An outstanding beer. I've only had a couple from Alesmith, but they've been very impressive to say the least. Like the bottle says, this really is deliciously malty and hoppy; a very drinkable and enjoyable balanced brew. One of the better beers I've ever had. Recommended.","Jeffo","Nov 27, 2009"

4.1,0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability - Extremely so. This is pretty damn good and something I would expect from the "Winter" version of this beer. I'm not going to lie, however, when I say that the summer version was better than this. I still have one of those left which I need to drink ASAP. Overall, a very nice winter offering form AleSmith and fitting. It is a bit chilly outside right now and this is doing the trick to keep me warm.","SpdKilz","Nov 11, 2009"

4.6,12.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Poured a slightly cloudy amber color with thin offwhite head. Smelled sweet and like dark fruits, plums and raisins. Tasted much like it smelled, dark fruits and sweet malts. Not a huge alcohol taste, but definitely present. This was an excellent beer. Did not have it fresh, but with a few months on it and it is still very enjoyable. A little syrupy as I get to the end of the bomber but nothing unpleasant going on. Very good and highly recommended.","jdskinns","Aug 26, 2009"

3.97,-2.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 4/20/08. Winter bottle. Pours a red/amber with a huge light tan head that lasted. Aroma primarily of floral hops, also some piney hops, grapefruit, other citrus fruits. Flavor of piney hops, citrus with a malty finish (also got some sweetness and alcohol in the finish). At first this beer was very smooth to drink, but it got heavier and more syrupy as I continued to drink. A very good ASA (but not my favorite).","LilBeerDoctor","Aug 14, 2009"

4.45,8.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"A tremendously large IPA with great balance and done with a holiday twist. Typical of big IPA's with very bold hop character, balanced with a healthy dosage of malt. Atypical of IPA's in it's cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and alspice flavors. It remains pine-ey and spruce-ey while showing complex fruitiness of grapefruit and oranges. Malts offer a creamy, viscous round sweetness while spiced heavily with American hops and fruitcake. Bready and yeasty despite such boldness. A very good beer to compliment the holiday season...even if the holiday season ended 3 months ago.","BEERchitect","May 15, 2009"

ABV hit a bit fast definitely a sipping beer.","mountdew1","Apr 01, 2009"
