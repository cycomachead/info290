"From bottle at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Light bronze color with vague head. Body is strongest aspect that let me down by being yet another hop bomb. Maple...Autumn Red...lebeling all gave way to hops. Enough with everything being hopped up. Spare me."
""
"Overall: Wasn't sure what to expect from this and in some way I wasn't disappointed. Certainly different from the 'usual' American styles (think in terms of heavily hopped IPAs and the like) but ultimately nothing particularly special. Worth tracking down if you fancy something a bit different but I feel that the maple syrup angle is somewhat overdone in that there's not actually enough of it"

"Enjoying this in Offaly Ireland on Feb 1st. A little late for an Autumn beer but still enjoyable."

"Pours an opaque medium amber producing 2.5 fingers of beige, moderately lasting, frothy head that leaves a beautiful sheets & webs of lace. Aromas of toast & biscuit, caramel, tangerine, a hint of tropical fruit & floral earthiness. Taste is toasted biscuit, caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, pear, pepper, hints of pine resin & floral earthiness. I don't pick up the maple but it may be lost in the toast & caramel. Finishes with toast, pine, orange & floral earthiness which dominate the bitter & lightly drawing aftertaste. Nicely balanced for an amber ale & a very hoppy example of the style. Odd but nice & quite good. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, creamy but slightly oily/slick, finishing wet, lightly prickly & astringent in the aftertaste."

"Perfect mahogany, fine off white foam. Immediate sweet malt, caramel, kinda candied brown sugar. Good body, bitter hops come through as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not really what I was expecting, and I can't say I like this one.  All light traces of maple from the nose disappear in the flavor. A bit too rough with the hop bitterness and not enough backing it."
""
"This was an interesting beer. The maple syrup nuances were extremely subtle, was hoping for a little more maple note, but overall, a nice fall/winter beer."
""
"More bitter than expected.  Hoppy with a bitter bite."
""
"If you try this beer, you won't be disappointed."
"The dry hops come through very nicely and achieve a perfect balance to my mind.  I tend to like my reds with plenty of hop aroma.  The maple flavour is fairly subtle but definitely detectable.  Loved this and would buy it again."

"Reddish amber in color with an in inch of tightly knit beige colored foam.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is of light malt and is hard to detect.  The flavor is mild and is light malt with a gentle spiciness that is skin to rye.  The mouth is moderately carbonated and crisp."
""

""
"Overall- not a bad beer but my least favorite of the Anchor family."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste begins with a hop flavor which is predominantly pine with a slightly fruity accent from the yeast which hints of English character with mild malt sweetness rounding out the taste and light woody flavor continuing into the finish with semi-dry and bitter quality. Overall a decent red ale with that familiar Anchor yeast in the taste and hops sufficient to balance.The maple contribution seems to dry and boost alcohol rather than flavor or sweeten, but that is not unexpected."

""
""
"BigLeaf Maple is an okay beer than could get better. It's still a more appropriate beer for early November than Celebration Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet opening notes. Nice bitter finish. Tried on tap"
""
"Another excellent Anchor brew and perfect for the Fall season."
""
""
""
""
"It starts off with some strong malt noes followed by a wave of super piney hops notes but it wasn't necessarily to my liking"
""
""
""
"Bitter, bitter, bitter.  No likey. No maple flavor either. None, just hops. Yech."
""
"Reviewed in real time... This beer looks great: a massive head of yellowed orange-tan rests atop a clear deep-copper body with a crimson cast and orange and gold highlights. If you're going for a beer that looks like fall, this is it! Aroma displays spicy, softly citrusy, grassy, floral and leafy hops over a sugary caramel malt base. So is this a maple beer? I don't taste it particularly, though it might be there, but the malt itself is quite nice. I get golden caramel as well as dark caramel and a soft toastiness, and there IS an edge of sugariness to it, but that's balanced by a wonderful spiciness. OK, so let's check the label... yes, there's ""a hint of maple - including big leaf maple - syrup in every brew"". It finishes with a dollop of sweetness, and it is there at the start as well, but mainly the malt and hops take the show. It's surprisingly complex, and yet at the same time really drinkable. It also seems to taste of fall to me. Maybe that's the power of suggestion, but I think the combination of its dry crispness and gentle sugariness somehow reminds me of the season, as does the spiciness, the soft citrus, and the grassy, piney, and leafy side of it as well. It's certainly unique, pleasantly complex, and really well-balanced and polished. Worth trying!"
""
""
"Fits fall perfectly.  Nice malty base beer with a touch of additional maple syrup sweetness on the back end.  Very well balanced with a nice orange vest and spice/earthy spice presence to compliment.  Good Stuff!"
""
""
"O: Can't say this is going down well, but it's possible I've had the bottle for too long. Looks alright, however the aroma and flavour posssess a leafy harshness along with subdued caramel malt and a twinge of maple syrup. Body is OK. I reckon the hop aroma has faded away somewhat. Not the best red ale I've tried."

"This one left me disappointed, which is out of the ordinary for an Anchor beer as far as I'm concerned. Poured a dark amber with a big fluffy white head, good retention on this one. Aroma was pine and citrus, sweet. It had a slightly creamy mouthfeel which left it kind of sticky, light-medium body and medium carbonation. Got a flash of that maple right away to the taste, but it disappeared quickly, booted out by the big hoppy, citrus, grapefruit characteristics. Tasting blind I would have called this an IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Inoffensive, but not all that tasty. A bit of a sort-of-hoppy, sort-of-malty, chalky mess."
""
""
""
"O: An unusually complex and flavourful Amber Ale that's well worth a purchase."
""
"Pours a medium amber color with a white head.  The aroma is hoppy with a hint of sweetness.  For a beer named autumn maple, there is not much maple flavor, but the hops character is strong, piney and has a hint of citrus.  Really tasty beer.  Full bodied ale with notes of caramel and hops.  Well carbonated and easy to drink.  Enjoyable."

"Pours a bright caramel color with a massive head of dense, lumpy foam.  Initial smell is juicy fruit and wild berries, followed by grapefruit, unripe peach, wood, and grass.  Malts are biscuity, which the maple syrup compliments nicely. Flavor seems to be maltier to start with a caramel, nutty, maple sweetness, but transforms into something more green, hoppy, and bitter by the finish.  This does help to cut down the sweetness, but the hops lose their initial fruitiness and turn grassy, minty, and piney which results in something more bitter and dry feeling.  Solid medium body and creamy.  Things are skewed a little towards the bitter side and the maple is subtle, but this is still pretty nice in an old-school kind of way.  Despite the mostly ""newer"" hop profile, this seems like something Anchor has always brewed."
""
"Very bitter hops, not as sweet as expected (which is a plus in my books), but there are hints of caramel and maple in the aftertaste. Crisp and delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting beer, I definitely got the maple flavor there but it's soft not overwhelming. Smooth and pretty easy to drink.  A nice seasonal departure from all the pumpkin on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This was a nice, rather sweeter, but very pleasantly hopped red ale.  This one is rather enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is rich and malty, and here’s where the maple syrup comes into play much better. I get the sweet maple playing on the palate alongside more bitter citrus hops tones. Very well-balanced! I am very happy with this ideal Fall seasonal brew, as it perfectly captures the spirit of Fall while remaining subtle, unique, and enjoyable."

"Anchor Brewing BigLeaf Maple Autumn Red -----3.5/5"
""
"It pours a dark red, very clear,  color with a short lived, two finger head. The nose is mostly apple worth a slight citrus edge and a familiar anchor malt flavor.  The Flavor is sweet,  still quite apple-y, and a nice buttery mouthfeel.  Good not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: after the great aroma, the flavor was a bit of a let down;"
""
""
""
"The Nelson hops make this beer crazy bitter.. This is a great beer for fall sports"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper or Amber color. Big, fluffy head. Caramely smell. Enjoyable malty notes with light hoppy bitterness in the taste. Surprisingly tasty. Great with food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a caramel brown coloring with a filmy, clingy, off-white head and steady carbonation throughout the body. Aromas of roasted caramel in the backbone, with subtle sugary maple highlights. Pretty balanced, light, and sweet. Flavors are toasted and tangy caramel, with woody notes, hints of maple sugar sweetness, and a roasted character, with some subtle citrus hops notes peeking through here and there, too. Smooth, light body, with a tangy sweet, almost cloying aftertaste. Light, slightly frothy finish, with a caramel linger."
"big NW hop aroma, deep amber-red color with big 3 finger head. floral hops, caramel malt...the maple flavor is understated-which i love, and it may lead to the smoothness of the mouth feel. a great hoppy autumn beer, with a very balanced toasted malt backbone."
""
""
""
"Overall: A fitting fall ale."
""
"Light hopped malt with sweet balance"
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a medium fluffy off white head, good lacing and head retention. Aroma is citrus earthy hops and fruity upfront with some caramel malt, yeast and sweet maple notes. Taste starts off with citrus earthy hops bitterness, slowly mellows out with a sweet caramel malt and maple flavor on the ending. Palate is a medium body, smooth with good carbonation, mild sticky mouth feel.. The finish is a combination of earthy pine hops and sweet malt and maple flavor on the end for balance, ending has a lingering hops and maple flavor. Overall a tasty fall treat and enjoyable brew."

"Nice copper color, unique taste for an autumn beer.  Refreshing among all the great pumpkin beers, a nice change for the season."
""
""
""
""
""

"Cool looking label, pretty average fall beer.  Had this out of the bottle one of my first fall beers of the year.  Mixture of maple, brown sugar, and caramel....but all fairly mild.  Good malt flavor.  Beautiful reddish color, you're not going to be able to look at this without really wanting to try it.  Mild mouthfeel, no surprises.  Good, I guess I just had higher expectations."
""
""
""
"O:  Nice beer that is also one of those fall beers that isn't a pumpkin ale, but at least with this one I knew it wasn't (compared to ST's Harvest).  Just a good amber."
""
"I guess I'm not crazy about this one, but it's fitting for the fall season."
""
"Overall:  This is another damn good beer from Anchor Brewing.  Malty, slightly sweet and balanced beautifully with some piney, slightly bitter hops, this beer is an excellent beer for the autumn season, and a unique one too, as it’s not a pumpkin beer or an Oktoberfest beer, which are the typical beers for this time of year.  Delicious!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent and innteresting beer, kind of ESB-like. I like the maple, I wish there was a little more and a little more general umph to the brew. Alas, a nice fall brew"

"Poured into a Belgian style glass. First I notice how beautiful of a color it is regardless of the tiny amount of foam. Second impressions are that it has a clean crisp maple smell complimented by rather harsh metallic nails-dipped-in-syrup taste. Its of medium viscosity giving it an average mouthfeel. The aftertaste is that of rusty maple bark."

"Overall, a solid amber ale. One that I'm happy to have tried, but that I will probably not go out of my way to procure again. There are other offerings that I would likely choose first. I will say that it's a truly beautiful looking beer, but then many amber ales are, to my eye, and as much as I love looking at a beer, I love smelling and drinking it more."

"* I tend to grade low, but hopefully consistently, and tend towards maltier brews."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 7/17/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, wood, light maple, herbal, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, wood, light maple, pine, herbal, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light maple, wood, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of hop and malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber ale. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would definitely drink it again. Had light flavor but I did enjoy it."

"C+"
""
""
"(O)-Not bad, but kind of glad I got a single of this. It started off great, but the flavor just turns into this overly bitter mess for my tastes"
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: The maple that is emphasized in the label is not really present, and overall I think this is more of an APA than an American Amber given the flavor profile. Not a bad beer though, just not what I was expecting - not enough malt backbone. An above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a nice fall beer that puts you in a good mood on a cool autumn day. Easy to drink."
""
"*from notes 11.13.13"
""
""
"After the heat of summer and just before the chill of winter, this ale captures the taste of fall like few do. It's perfect for a day or raking leaves, carving pumpkins or chasing the pigskin."
""
"Not to bad a beer all in, one that I wasn't sure about initially but it was one that grew on me some and improved as it was given a chance to further open up and heat up a little. Not one that I'd suggest looking out for but more than worth a try if you happen across it."
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasty and hoppy-faint sweetness-subtle, burnt-leaf bitterness. Tasty, tailgating-worthy offering. Burger or bratwurst friendly."
""
""
"O - very nice autumnal ale. I was hoping for the maple to stick out a bit more but this was good regardless"
""
"O: This is a pretty hopped up version of an American Amber/Red, which is something that I really enjoy - somewhat reminiscent of an APA. I wish the maple was a little more present than it is but otherwise this is a very drinkable beer."
"I'm ok with this, but this is one I need to be in the mood for, or plan a meal around. Killing this bottle by itself on a Friday night is just an ok experience, and willingness and enjoyment diminish with each sip."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth and an interesting seasonal that is unique and easy drinking. When you read the label, you almost feel like there is a hint of maple earthiness blended in with the malt character. Overall a solid and enjoyable seasonal that I will probably seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I wouldn't recommend that my children search for it, but if you see it and want to chill hard like Tebow in Bible study, Raul would recommend it enough."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a slight disappointment, but not bad."
""
""
"Actually a true amber, masquerading as a winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I normally don't get too excited about anything from Anchor but this one sounded too good to pass up. Maybe I was just excited to finally be able to buy a six pack of a red ale (any red ale!) for a low price, but I thought this was a great fall beer. Not as sweet as the name would make you think, but fans of Imperial Reds will definitely find this enjoyable. Sad to see it leaving the shelves (I've already gone through two six-packs)."
""
""
""
""
"O: Great mouthfeel and a decent flavor that I can’t really complain about, I was just expecting more of a maple presence. Definitely another solid beer from Anchor though."
"Overall: Don't let the maple fool you, the fruitiness to this one is the story. This is a really good beer."
"Hops dominate the Malts, interesting beer, that would go good with steak or some Bar-B-Q ribs. Certainly not a thirst quencher on a hot day."
"Overall, this is flat, harsh, and barely drinkable. I just don't understand how a brewery with the resources of Anchor can continue to make so many mediocre beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rugged and spicy with some warming fusel alcohol. Big brushstrokes of carb that almost singe the palate in the crescendo. Body holds its own with a medium wooliness. Still, a great autumny feel."
"Overall, a very pleasant, unique ale, maple is subtle in the taste and nose, hop blend works well with malt profile."
"Regardless if you can really taste maple syrup, this is a quaffable and uniquely flavored ale. It was good enough to consider purchasing another six pack before the season is over."
""
""
""
"I dunno, just like some other users here I can't seem to pick up any maple syrup. What I do get though is lots of citrus and grassy hop flavors. Pretty bitter and unbalanced, small malty presence."
"Not a bad Amber. Flavorful and balanced and perfect for a fall day."
""
"Poured copper in color with two big fingers of off-white head. The head retained well and left complex layers of thick lacing. Other than the faint essence of hops, the nose is pretty bland. The flavor is light with a dry finish. There are no discernible maple notes in the nose or the flavor - bummer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really solid. Not sure if the maple comes through, but still very enjoyable."
"Pours into a standard pint glass a clear rich amber with a large fluffy slight off white head that settles very slowly into a frothy mass.Mainly nutty malts in the nose alog with lighter biscuit sweetness and citric hops.More dry on the palate than I was expecting,earthy/nuttiness with some biscuit malt,the maple is lightly detected,leafy/herbal hops in the finish.Not a bad little beer,it's not a big hopped up amber but has nice malty flavors with just enough hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Nice balance. Crisp and refreshing. Moderate level of hoppiness but not overdone. Just what I was in the mood for. I'm impressed with this beer and pleasantly surprised at how much I like it. Will definitely seek it out again."
"Overall - One of the better offerings in Anchor's line-up, IMO. Nice balance. Nice flavors. It's no world-beater, but certainly one I'd tend to buy from time to time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an OK beer but nothing great. That Earl Gray tea taste really throws my sense of taste and what I am drinking for a loop."
""
""
"o: Very nice, I definitely enjoyed this one. Unique."
"o - Overall an okay beer, but not my favorite anchor beer or red ale. Nose doesn't gel the best together, though the taste is better. Probably wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
""
""
"This is certainly an intriguing beer to say the least. The quality and retention of the head are excellent--it has a nearly nitro consistency, which I may have never seen on such a well-hopped beer before, and certainly not out of a bottle. There's plenty of fruity bitterness to keep the palate engaged, though it's a far cry from what I was expecting based on the label. If you're looking for a sweet, autumnal affair, you'll likely be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a vibrant, creamy, quasi-IPA, you may be pleasantly surprised."
""
""
"Carbonation's right for an amber."
"O: This beer is quite hoppy for the style and has the type of hop flavors and aromas you would expect from a hopped-up APA. It is easy to drink and the taste has a good balance with the underlying malts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer and fun to try, but came up short on its promise."
""
""
""
"Feel: Medium-full with excellent, soft carbonation. Very creamy for style."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer overall but I would prefer the liberty ale over it any day. Not bad of an an experimental maple amber ale. Worth picking up for just a couple of bucks."
""
""
""
"O-it's just an okay beer. Not something I want more than once. The more I drink it, the more the bitterness seems to build which I do appreciate. It's still not something I think I'll be ordering again. Don't let the maple tag full you, it's not there."
""
""
"Overall I wasn't really into this beer, but I thought it was decent example of the style, but it really didn't live up to the maple part of it's name, I think it needs more maple syrup flavors and less bitterness. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't that smooth and the taste only held my attention a little, one is enough for me. I liked the appearance the most, it's a good looking beer. I liked the taste and drinkability the least, they just didn't work out as well as they could have. I wouldn't buy it again and i would really recommend it. All in all I wasn't impressed with this beer, I wish it had better balance and a more identifiable maple aspect. Better luck next time guys."
"Overall: This beer really grew on me; it is eminently drinkable and has some interesting elements that are unique; so it's not extreme - get over it"
""
""
"Overall- A well crafted beer in the strict sense of an Amber ale with a small amount of maple. Although I expected the maple to be much more dominant, I'm not sure how the final product would be as such."
""
""
""
"Overall: I liked this one, a solid fall beer that reminds me of autumn in the northeast. Worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Appearance and smell offered the promise of an excellent brew, but the taste disappointed. If there is any maple aroma or taste, it is lost among all the hops. Maple syrup is an expensive ingredient, so if you're only going to use ""a hint"" as it says on the label, then you've got to be careful not to overdo the other ingredients."
"Price Point - $2.40/12oz single"
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice new seasonal from Anchor. It matches the season well, and is quite drinkable. Good value. Worth a try"
"O: I like this one. Good complexity and well balanced. A good fall beer."
"Good but not great. Would have liked more maple. Still, a nice beer to sip on a crisp autumn evening."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was surprised to find so much hop in an autumn brew, which I think of as malt/spice dominated, but this challenges that notion. But, to balance that statement, it's not much different than most other quality IPA's. It may gain a slight edge just from the labeling. But kudos to Anchor Steam for thinking to do so!"
""
"Overall, I'd enjoy this again. It's a solid fall offering at a reasonable price."
""
"This is a medium-bodied beer that, while having very light crispness, is quite smooth all the way. Carbonation is light to moderate. The body is supported while allowing the smoothness to take charge, though the crispness keeps it from boring."
""
"A fine fall time brew here, well balanced and easy to drink. Could certainly go for more than one."
""
""
"**ADDENDUM: The flavor greatly improves as it warms and the maple finally wins the battle and begins to come through strong."

"finally a new brew from the anchor folks. this one is great, pouring an orangey red color with an inch of off white head, fluffy and lasting. it smells more hoppy than expected, I thought itd a be a sweeter maple amber, but its a dryer red malt nose with citrus and pine in the hop finish, crisp and clean, but also pretty big. the malts aren't dusty dry irish red ones, but they aren't sweet American amber either, sort of a best of both worlds here. the hops don't come in until the end, but pack quite the punch, pushing ipa intensity. I don't hardly taste maple in this at all, as the hops really overshadow it, if its there at all. a very well made beer though, despite its relative imbalance. fuller body, prickly fine micro carbonation, and a fast finish. a perfect fall beer, not totally dissimilar to sierra nevadas flipside red ipa really."
""
""
"This is a combo that just didn't work for me. The last couple of beers from Anchor were duds to me. Not sure what I'm gonna do with the other 5 of these, maybe see how they taste ice-cold. $10 down the drain..."
""
""
""
""
"I was quite surprised with the hop presence in this. I went into it expecting a malt-forward beer, accentuated by the maple used. The hops though, are the first thing you notice, and are then complimented by the malty, slightly sweet maple notes. Surprising, but well done."
"Overall - great fall session beer from Anchor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my kind of Amber. Not a fan of crystal malts in IPA's, I welcome their relatively restrained use here for the style. Restrained by lack of complexity to a degree for sure, but a pleasant and easy quaff. And quite fresh as well."
"You know I sort of went into this one expecting one thing and got another, this really surprised me, I guess I was thinking a warmer heavier beer a bit more silky but it turned out to be pleasantly citrisy even hoppy (I'm not a hops pro so forgive me ye IPA gods O' the earth) when I take into consideration my expectations drinking this was like late summer in a beer with a maple aroma which if you think of it makes perfect sense, autumn is full of what has been brought forth of the summer harvest so taking into consideration that this is indeed a well made beer and modestly attempting to understand the methodology and philosophy the brewmasters over at anchor might have been shooting for and from I'm inclined to like this new Bigleaf Maple Autumn Red, so much so I've put it on my weekly beer list!"
"O - A decent brew, but when I think maple syrup I do not think hop bitterness, which there is plenty of in this brew, which opposes the sweetness of the maple in a harsh way, and makes for a tart end. For that reason I'm not impressed. The maple should be the star of this beer, not a character."
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. A decent addition to the Anchor lineup."
"12oz single from ""Trader Joe"" in Salem OR. $1.35 Pours a nice clear amber colour with a lovely creamy,thick cream coloured head. Nice hop aromas greet the nose first,herbal and citrus,getting a small amount of caramel from the malts. Taste is far more balanced with the caramel malts ( with tinge of salt) equaling the hops..blends very nice, the maple syrup to me seems more under the radar but is there in a almost subconscious way! Very nice palate..bitterness lingers a while on the back of the tongue..which i like. Overall tasty amber, good fall drinking."
"Silly me for thinking the name was three words... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset bronze topped by a couple fingers of light cream foam. The nose comprises grass, mixed greens, light flowers, and a slight breeze of spearmint. The taste brings in more of the same, with a strong undercurrent of very mild toffee. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, I can't say this is a bad beer; it's not. What I can say is that I didn't care for it: There is no real balance, the hops seem stagnant and out of place, and that weird mint character doesn't endear the beer to my tastebuds."

"Poured into a Chuckanut pint glass. Pours a medium copper amber with a fine finger and a half of white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of bready malt, maple syrup, apricot juice, light grassy hops. Flavor follows aroma with sweet bready malt, maple, light stone fruit juice and grassy, mildly piney hops. Finishes semi-dry with residual hop bitterness. Medium bodied with nice active carbonation. The addition of maple to a red ale works out quite well here. Like many Anchor beers, this is safe and non-challenging, but well made and pleasant to drink. The finish was slightly astringent and could be supported a bit more by the good maple malt in the start. Nice fall beer."
"O- This beer needs more balance and focus. The components are all there but just not constructed well."

"I rate this on its own merit and not the expectation of its type or what the label said. This is a decent IPA strange as it may be."
"Overall picked up a single bottle but wouldnt mind having a few more. Stronger than most summer beers in both flavor and abv which works well for the fall."

"Thankfully, the booze wasn't too strong either, or else this would have scored lower in my book. I thought this beer was fine on its own but just didn't live up to the expectations based on its description or the reputation of Anchor's other offerings. As a seasonal, this wouldn't be a great first choice and is only worth a go for those who want to give all the Anchor beers a try. I hope that next year's is a bit more on the mark and worth picking up in the midst of a ton of other Autumn offerings."
"Pours without too much head, good legs however as the foam has enough body to cling to glass for a good while after the pour. Excellent initial bouquet, earthy with a robust hops nose. Pleasantly surprising strong initial hop notes with a crisp, full mouth feel. Crisp on the back of the tongue and goes down easy, a very good fall special. Almost tastes more like a Sierra Nevada than a Anchor brew. Excellent addition to their portfolio and look forward to having around for years to come."

"An interesting fall beer and not too bad either."
""
"Meh. A hoppy amber. Wow. Been there done that about a thousand times. Oddly tart/near sour and metallic. Ick. Can easily skip this one."
"Overall: Really good. A great seasonal beer for the fall showcasing brown sugar, caramel, toasted bread, and maple syrup notes that are all balanced by some moderate bitterness on the finish"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good red ale, and a fine beer from the folks at Anchor. However, it's not exactly as advertised as I got very little maple from it despite it's other positive attributes. I would certainly not refuse if offered, but probably won't seek out."

"T: Opens alright, but never really turns into much. Light toast and caramel malt with some earthy hops on the backend. Finish brings some pine resin, but it's pretty mild. Almost more of a piny sourness. I was hoping for a hint of the maple, but I never really found it here. Not bad, but not anywhere near the top of the fall beer list."

"Another entrant into this catch-all category, wherein the contestant has just enough to offer, but yet a whole lot of baggage to go along with it, that I'm kind of taken off the rails a tad too early, I imagine. Hardly captivating, and rather lacking in the maple flavour so front and center in the name (my Canadian roots are bristling), and once again with this brewery, not altogether worthy of following up on."

"O: This doesn't do much to excite the taste buds, but it's easily drinkable. More hop presence and less maple syrup flavor than I expected. This isn't anything I'd go out of my way for again, but glad to have tried it on"

"Overall a very nice amber. The maple never really comes through but this is a very nicely-balanced brew. Everything enhances the other here. Impressive"

"Great seasonal Beer. Its a very well balanced beer, with definite Hop presence, sweet maple smells/taste and a nice thick sticky lingering head. The color is absolutely gorgeous when held up to the light. Quite drinkable but still a respectable amount of abv. This is a new fall favorite."
"This pours a richly hued caramel with a ruby tinge. There’s a pleasingly hoppy aroma dominated by a piney character yet undergird with some dank notes. The beer tastes hoppy, piney, and slightly dank. There’s a lingering bitterness undercut with a maple sweetness. The flavor is piney and bitter. Tastes like autumn!"

"O- I bought this for the hops, wish it was exclusively Nelson Sauvin. It gets a little better as it warms up. It would be better if it was a little sweeter."
""
"Pours a red/amber with a nice foamy khaki head and good lacing. Aroma offers some maple syrup, caramel, grapes, earthy,. Flavor is pretty similar with the earthy finish providing a touch of bitterness to it. A medium bodied, active mouthfeel. Overall, an alright brew here. I was really excited to try this, as an amber ale hopped with (amongst others) nelson sauvin hops sounded great to me. The addition of maple syrup seemed interesting and appealing too. Ended up not coming close to meeting my expectations. Not a bad beer, but not a beer that I have much need to drink again. Glad I only purchased a single of this, worth the purchase but not worth another."
""
"T/M/O: It gulps very well, with just enough bitterness to balance out the pale malt. Crisp before fading into a well-rounded body. Taste is very brief and not very memorable, but the overall experience isn't bad."

"Overall: I was contemplating how much I liked this one when I realized how quickly I had gone through the beer. If I’m willing to drink it like that to search for that flavor that’s on the tip of my tongue, then I guess it deserves the rounding up. A very nice beer for the season, I could see myself drinking this through to early winter, maybe even the new year. I don’t think it’s robust enough to last through the cold months."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, maple, and herbal and pine hop aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy maple and woody flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody and hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a more earthy than sweet maple presence in the flavor."

"Wow, this is a really good beer. A bit of a thin body with prickly carbonation. Nice toasty maltiness with big hoppiness and the faintest toach of maple sweetness to balance the bitterness. Very tannic with a very bright clean and crisp finish. Complex yet drinkable, hoppy, malty, and flavorful. Really enjoy it and looking forward to drinking this this fall!"

"Bigleaf is a very nice beer. The maple balances the fairly strong hopping, making this taste more like a traditional Amber with a twist as opposed to the in vogue Red IPAs. This makes it a beer that can be enjoyed by the Amber fan and the IPA fan equally. My only complaint is that this beer is replacing the outstanding Humming Ale. Why you gotta play me like that, Anchor?"
""
"O- This aroma on this beer was promising, but the flavor missed the mark for me. Lots of harsh bitterness and lots of unpleasant earthy notes. Definitely a bit of a disappointment and really lacking in maple flavor, all you get is some in the aroma and a slightly sticky mouthfeel just like right after polishing off a stack of pancakes."

"The body was nicely medium and smooth. Drinkability was good enough, but it's not a beer I'm going to seek out a lot. Oddly enough, I liked the bottle I drank from the bottle last night a lot better than this one. Probably worth a shot if you see it."
""
"Overall- I wish there were more maple syrup and the integration were better but it is a Anchor beer, so it is worth a try. Though it's not a beer you would typically cellar, it might be worth the experiment. Above average."
"This is definitely a rustic amber ale. The maple syrup comes through and the overall flavor is rather earthy. The hops are intense as well with big citrus notes up front followed by a piney, bitter finish. This beer could use a bit of balance as all of the flavors don't mesh as a cohesive unit. That being said this is a nice, hoppy beer that keeps me intrigued."
