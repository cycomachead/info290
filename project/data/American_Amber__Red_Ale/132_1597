3.68,-2.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, light toffee, and floral/toasted earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, light toffee, and floral/toast earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and solid robustness of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant amber ale. Good balance of citrus hop and dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 10, 2014"

The taste is the caramel malts upfront followed by some bread and toffee. Spicy and floral hops towards the finish with more caramel at the end. A bit sweet but with a decent amount of hop bite. Even though it's dry hopped, this one tastes more malt forward to me. Medium bodied with a slightly thin mouthfeel. I was expecting more hop flavor out of this one but it's still a decent Red Ale.

Well done, Rogue.","demuzik","Nov 12, 2011"
3.58,-5.3,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, auburn-brown coloring with a thin, big bubbled, frothy, yellow-tan colored head that clings scantily all over the glass. Tangy sweet and slightly sour malt aromas, with a peppery hops blend. Flavor blasts hop forward, with the taste at the tip and sides of the tongue. The tangy and slightly roasted caramel sweetness fills the middle of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. The aftertaste is light, with a slight cloying feel, and a resiny kick of the hops. The finish is slick, but cleans up quickly. Decent brew, and very easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Nov 09, 2011"

Balance is evident on the tongue as well, sweet malts & mixed citric make this red ale a standout for its style, although the extreme hop usage may deviate from the traditional sense.

This continued as I scoped the color and look of this red. Rogue usually always hits the mark for me, but this one just didn't get all the way there. Came up a bit short. However, that being said, it's still a pretty good brew. Some unique flavors I've never experienced and that alone makes it worth a try. I'm sure I'll buy another at some point in time.

A one and a half inch head, off-white to cream in color, develops and leaves patches of bubbly, wet lacing as it subsides. The smell is of toasted malt, toffee, some caramel, faint fruits (cherry, plum), and some citrusy hops. Taste emphasizes the toasted malt, though the caramel is also readily noticeable. The citrus and fruit shines through in the rear. Mouth is very smooth throughout, but finishes a touch sticky. Overall, a very good amber that I’ll gladly have again.","eclipse54","Aug 18, 2011"

This particular bottle was dedicated to a bull named Fukutsuru, cool. Impressivly clear pour considering the layer of yeast in the bottom. Gorgious red color and a nice lingering lacy off white head. Really sensuall hop aroma of spring flowers and almost berry-like undertones. Malt is resting just underneath in a warm bready invitation. The flavor is a gentle yet assertive fruity purfumy dose of hops backed up by a full buffet of toasty, bready, caramel malt. It is nice and bitter until the very end when the malt tips the balance and gives a pleasent flower laced toasty bread finish. The malt wakes up a lot as it warms. This is the perfect American red. Very hoppy without being too bitter, very malt without being heavy or sweet. Perfect session beer.

Decent in taste as well, citrus notes aren't as prominent but work with the toffee malt which stands out here. Highly carbonated, and feels fairly watery; dry finish with lingering bitterness.

Also a barrel of malt. There's a feathery hit of hops at the end, but is barely noticeable. The nearly non-existent carbonation gives it a heavy feel and makes it something to drink slowly.

I poured her into a tulip which works wonders for my DIPAs but it gave it an almost metallic smell (with some malts and hops to follow). I got about one inch of head with some residue on the sides. I'll end my review now and take another shot at her at a later date because this particular one is not as great as some I have had in the past.

Poured a deep red-orange with a finger of pale head that left lacing about halfway down the glass. Though not overpowering the hops and malt were clearly evident in the aroma, even with a hint of citrus. The first tase had a rich malt flavor, with the hops coming in prominently in the aftertaste with a mild but noticeable alcohol tinge to it. Rich, almost chewy feel going down despite the low carbonation, and extremely drinkable. I highly recommend this as a session beer wherever possible, as I could drink this all throughout the night.","BDJake","Oct 14, 2009"

Beer poured with a tan head that quickly died down to a thin layer leaving a decent lace on the glass. Color was a hazy redish amber. Nose was nicely floral, citrusy from the dry hopping. Good mouthfeel, slightly oily with malt becoming more apparent as the beer warmed in the hand. Overall, a drinkable beer, just not as good as my first experience with it.

The Malt shows, with toasty notes and faint sweetness. It finishes dry with notes of pine and citrus. The mouthfeel of this red is pretty average. Medium bodied and flavorful, but it is almost too clean. Each sip goes down and the flavor is gone just as fast. Overall, St. Rogue is very easy to drink.

Invasively hoppy nose of bitters, grains, grass, cabbage, mixed white citrus, does consciously present a malty side, the lack of fruit scents contributes to its arid presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, stern like a governmental bureaucrat, understands what you want, throws up a wall of impassivity so you never can guess ahead if you will get it. Touch of pine resin, raw dough and yeasts, uncooked oatmeal, following up on the nose, the malts appear to be used exclusively as counter-balance. Dry, and at times bitter, goes for a certain style and damn you if you don't like it. Keeps its foot on your neck way past the finish.

4.3,13.8,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Thick fluffy, pillowy head laces the wide mouth heavy. Awesome aroma of fresh, wet hops, thick, spicy sweet malt, and maple syrup. Smooth on the tongue, with a solid malt foundation to support some of the most vibrant hops I've sipped since Sierra Nevada Harvest/Chico Estate. Beautifully balanced, with a sappy, toffee body keeping an eye on the sticky bitterness. This ale also captures a bit of the "tang" commonly found in reds. The super hopped red is qucikly becoming one of my favorite styles; a treat for hop lovers at a session ABV.","SeanRedd","Dec 24, 2008"

Tastes great and reminds me of a hoppier version of American Amber Ale. Starts malty and finishes hoppy and somewhat dry.

Makes me curious what their "India Red Ale" is like under the Tracktown Label, or their "Imperial Red" in the swingtop bottle.

I really enjoyed this one, much better than I remember it being out of the bottle. A ton of malt makes this one fairly unique for most American Ambers (which seem to basically be slightly spicier, maltier IPAs). This one almost fell into maybe an imperial oktoberfest or something (wouldn't that style be something). Also had a ton of huge fruit aromas and flavors, including a ton of raisins and peaches. Excellent appearance, with a huge floaty head and incredible lacing. Body is likewise incredibly thick and creamy, a definite surprise for the style.

Piney, resiny, grapefruit, with some earthy/woody undertones. The hops are underlined by some dark fruit from crystal malt, creating a berryish smell. Flavour is sweet, again heavy American hop, dry hop crispness, but not overly bitter. Malt comes through at the end, some nutty Munich notes, and a nice hit of berry from the crystal. Mouthfeel is nice and full, lightened by prickly carbonation. Perfectly balanced, wonderful, and refreshingly innovative.

The hops aren't much in the flavour; however, it's pretty bitter at the end of the tasting. It's a bit too sweet for me though, but it's very balanced. The mouth feel is a bit creamy.

Begins with a bubbly rush of toasty malt, which is restrained in its sweetness and quickly becomes a bit astringent as the hops come in. A pithy citric punch towards the finish ends any malt sweetness for a snappy, clean finish. Nice restrained dried fruit malt flavors integrate well with some classic NW hop notes. One of Rogue's leaner beers, this would make a nice session. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and overcarbonated, but an agressive pour and a little foaming helps this settle.

Flavor is a mix of fruity esters, dark, dried fruits, chewy, caramel malts, toffee, honey, bread, and some citric hops. Flavor tends to fade out a bit, however, in the finish in a seltzery way. Mouthfeel is solid all around and has a decent weight to it. The carbonation could be a little more relaxed for my tastes. Good drinker all around and a great example of an amber ale.

Taste is initially very hoppy but fades and allows a pleasing light caramel malty flavor to peek through. Mouthfeel seems a bit chewy, lighter in body. Drinkability is quite good. The high level of aroma hops make this beer come off initally like a hop bomb, but it seems more bark than bite. A bit more malt sweetness would be nicer, but it's still preety good.

Toasty malts on the nose, with a nice spicy and floral Centennial hop aroma. Taste is very similar, with toasty malt cut through by hoppiness, although here the hops take on more citrus character.

I get an aftertaste of pecans or walnuts. It takes some time, but it hits in a wave and then dies down. Unfortunately, after that first hit, there isn't really the same level of character. But there is a hearty bitter and earthy profile. Lots of complexities here, but a fairly odd combination and more earthy than anything. A robust red.

Left walls of lacing all down the glass so that I couldn't see through the glass. Pretty astounding. Hops absolutely dominate the smell. There is some caramel there, but the hops want you to know that they're in charge. Taste is an unbalanced showcase of hops, though still quite enjoyable. Hops are both citrusy and piney, which is a wonderful combination. Finish is quite dry and leaves me wanting more. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, though carbonation is adequate.","atrus138","Jan 21, 2008"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle. Poured a hazy, somewhat dark amber red color, that had beautiful garnet highlights. The beer was topped off by a thick, pillowy, tannish white two finger head, that had great retention. Plenty of thick gobs of sticky lace were left behind as the head slowly faded. Thick juicy hop aromas were most present in the nose, along with some sweet crystal malt, orange peel, and some grapefruit teamed up with a bit of pine. A small underlying yeast aroma was also present. Not a bad start. A good amount of flavor was packed into this as well. Plenty of bittering hops out front, surpisingly tamed by the big sweet malt, more of the citrus zest that was noted in the nose, and an almost tobacco like flavor in the background. I expected this "Dry Hopped" beer to be quite a bit hoppier, but was actually pretty balanced in my opinion. Not a drop of noticeable alcohol here. Plenty of carbonation. Head a somewhat thick, medium to full bodied mouthfeel, and was very crisp and clean. Great drinkability. Another winner from Rogue!","jaxon53","Jan 19, 2008"

Ok theres a smidgen of hop scent at first sniff, ok so thats a good thing. Not sure if its the Chinook, Centennial or both in the batch during the dry hop. Anyway, I do not want to be long in text and drag this out. Rouge makes better beer than this. I need this on draft to compare the two  bottom line, it was just ok. Dont get me wrong, maybe I got a sub par batch or maybe there was an elapsed shelf life.

The aroma is lightly vinous, with sweet/caramel malts, apricot, peach, and earthy/piney and grapefruit hops. On the palate there is a hoppy and malty earthiness, along with apricot, and toasted/caramel. The hop character is deep, imparting a medium bitterness, and notes of piney/green, citric, and tropical (mango, papaya) hops, on top of a medium, yet fairly full, drying body, that has medium carbonation and finish.

Deep caramel flavor in great harmony with pleasant piney hops. There is a greatly appropriate level of carbonation and the alcohol is very well hidden.

Smells hoppy for sure, but I have difficulty discerning much else in the aroma. Some pine, as a result of the hops, and maybe some orange peel? It has a pleasant flavor, but not necessarily what I was expecting. Very hoppy with some mild sweetness that kicks in at the end. But I expected more complexity for some reason. This is good, but a bit pedestrian. In the least, I was expecting more malt balance, being an amber ale. But still, it's nice. Sort of like a red IPA. Decent mouthfeel as well.

This was one of those red/amber ales that is translated into the more bitter/hoppy type rather than one that focuses a little more on sweet hops, and big surprise- it comes from Oregon. The St. Rogue Red really does contain quite a bit of bitterness for an amber and how you review it basically depends on what you were expecting or what you normally look for in an amber ale. Thankfully I've had both ends of the amber/red ale spectrum and I honestly prefer those that contain more proportions of malt and caramel.

I bet if I aged this stuff for a year or two it would mellow out a bit.","LordChesterfield","Sep 24, 2006"

Gigantic pine and citrus hop aromas from the dry-hopping (although I've not yet sampled the "regular" St. Rogue Red for comparison). Bitter grapefruit pith and bergamot flavors dance around the tongue up front; then a bready malt structure makes its presence known until a piney bitterness returns to puncture the palate at the end. Citrusy spruce burps, but nothing "nostril-stinging". Chewy mouthfeel, medium body, but under-carbonated (most likely from the growler not being sealed tightly enough right away). Delicious beer all around. A super sessionable red ale that's *almost* worth the slightly high price ($11.99 a 1/2-gallon)","orfeu","Aug 31, 2006"

Clarity was very good with small bubbles periodically working towards the head. that head maintained well into the beer. The nose on this beer was awesome. It had a very solid foundation of caramel malt, but the hop that followed was AWESOME. If there were ever candied hops, they would smell like this beer. Sweet and citrusy. There was a light toasted breadyness, but the hops are what define this one. Flavor initially brought caramel and melanoidans but moved very quickly to solid and chunky citrusy hop flavor. It finished with a mild, but very pleasing bitterness, with sweet grapefruity hop and mild caramel malty sweetness. Very very tasty beer here. The feel was moderate with a very fine carbonation, that really added to the experience. This was an excellent beer with bold flavors that knew exactly when to stop short of being too much.

Mouthfeel is good and full, but not as satisfying as I feel that it could be, and drinkability is good. I had their other amber ale last night, the American Amber, and with that in mind I'm less impressed than I might be.

A lingering roastiness bitterness is left on the sides of the tounge - a bit too much I think. I enjoy a nice red ale but I was not expecting the amount of roasted malt flavor it has. Its not bad, just too much for me in a red ale. A bit watery as well considering its roastiness. Slightly below medium carbonation. As I stated, its a quality brew just not one of the better reds in my book.","sabrills70","Jul 07, 2005"

Nice. Sweetish toasted malt notes up front. Herbal hop bitterness pervades, with cookie-dough maltiness in the middle and a singed hop flower finish. Doughy sweetness lingers.

The aroma is quite hoppy with notes of piney and gentle citrus. The body is medium with a fine, median carbonation. The flavor starts softly fruity and lightly nutty before some sweet caramel maltiness breaks through, only to be hammered back by its quickly ensuing resiny hop flavor and bitterness. It finishes dry with just some residual maltiness and a bold lingering bitterness. Delectable!!!","NeroFiddled","Jun 18, 2005"

Hop bitter is noticable, but just a tingle across the pallette. Md thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated. The flavors are really well balanced and overall, the flavors are tune with the hop bitter. It's a little bit rough grassy on the tongue (about 2/3 through the beer) which is starting to wear considering the beer now seems quite dry.

The mouthfeel was definitely full...very thick and almost, but not quite, syrupy. The oddest thing about this one was when drinking the initial taste was of some hop bitterness, followed by full-on maltiness...bit of a reverse from the normal process. I'll be honest, I thought the hops got a bit lots...this is a decidedly malty brew. Wasn't that impressed with the mouthfeel...it was about the thickest I've ever experienced in a beer.

The aroma is caramel malt and a whiff of sourdough bread along with a decent dose of piney and floral hops that are typical of Rogue. The taste is dominantly caramelized malts, along with some sourness, and a hint nuts and smoke. The hops are assertively bitter at the start of each sip and reemerge in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy, and is helped along by the high level of carbonation. This beer packs a lot of flavor, and has a decent session potential, but is a bit too bitter when consumed at cooler than cellar temperature. As it warms to near room temperature, a more robust sweet and malty character emerges mid-palette, making the beer much more appealing.","rajendra82","May 09, 2004"

The taste is failry full and has, at once, a strong malt sweetness that is overtly pushed around by very strongly bittering hops. These hops are a strong surprise in a red and even more so at this strength level. The feel is very good and gives a nice crisp end to each draw. Very nicely drinkable ale.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 08, 2003"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"An above average Red Ale, which is pleasent seeing as its a style that has been beaten into the ground making it real hit or miss. This was a hit. Poured a orange-brown infused with a ruddy copper perfect for the changing leaves and a loose off-white head. Smelled of deep piney hops and a fruity peach like malt with just a hint of bready notes, but still typical hopped up Rogue aroma. Taste was tons of juicy grapefruit hops and a toasted cracker malts. Reasonably effervesant bordering on creamy. Went as a good compliment to the quatro formage pizza with waaay too much garlic. Another quality Rogue brew.","GreatPondBrewer","Oct 23, 2003"
4.03,6.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This red-tinged, dark brown/amber ale with a full beige head is beautiful to behold. The fresh floral and tea-like hop aromas are fairly potent. A sweet malt and faint chocolate aroma are noticed early, but fade rather quickly. The lightly caramel sweet malt melds with a fresh biscuity flavor. The hop bitterness is made up of grapefruit, tea-like and a faint metallic bite. Fruit notes and a light lime taste appear late as does a bit of honey sweetness as it warms.","BeerResearcher","Oct 15, 2003"
3.69,-2.4,4.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"22oz bomber. This pours a deep reddish/amber, hence the name with a good creamy white head. The aroma of bitter, slightly citrousy hops hits you first, with some bready maltiness in the background. This is a bitter beer. Not so much mega hoppy but the weak malt taste seems to almost add bitterness as opposed to balancing it out. As a hop head I'm enjoying this. As far as red ales go I can't say I've had better. Nice slick mouthfeel that dries up into a bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable.","avylover","Oct 10, 2003"

3.72,-1.6,3,3.5,4,3,4,"This one pours with a medium head of orangey tan foam that doesnt remain very long and doesnt produce much of a lace. True to its name, the beer is clear reddish-copper in color. Roasted malts are apparent on the nose, as are some slight notes of hops. The flavor starts with fairly mild malt notes that have very small hints of caramel and maybe a little bit of nuttiness. Big roasted malt character then hits the palate. Hops become more noticeable towards the end and mingle well with the roasted notes. The dry finish is of hops and some roasted bitterness which lasts into the aftertaste. St. Rogue seems a little thin in the mouth, with moderate carbonation. This is a good brew that is pretty easy to drink, but not my favorite.","byrd","Sep 26, 2003"

Medium body and carbonation. Very nice hops aftertaste. This was a very drinkable ale.","UncleJimbo","Aug 23, 2003"

A malty flavor that is a bit sweet like a scotch ale almost. Excellent work guys.","BierReise","Aug 19, 2003"

The taste started with nice maltiness with slight caramel and nutty undertones, followed by the lovely dry hops flavour.Most Reds I have had before have had to much sweetness. The hoppiness at the end definately balanced this out and gave it balance and enhanced the overall mouthfeel .

Anyway, this hoppy brew pours a dark ruby amber with a light tan head. The smell is understated; I didn't really know what to expect. Yes, there was hops and a touch of rosy sweetness. The taste, however, was far more intricate. I loved the first blast of hops bitterness, which then mellowed into a balanced semi-sweet finish. Good mouthfeel. Definitely worth it.

Not quite as "heavy" as expected, but distinctly hoppy, with just a slight sweet undertone in the background. Taste was not as over-the-top Rogue-esque hoppy as I' d expected, especially for a beer that was dry-hopped. Hoppy flavor with a surprisingly-balanced malt sweetness noted as well. However, there was an almost "iced-tea" flavor to this beer as it warmed. Mouthfeel is smooth, though slightly on the thin side. Drinkability is tolerable. I was slightly disappointed by this offering from Rogue, given my typical love for most of the beers I've had from them.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jun 03, 2003"

3.06,-19,4,3,3,3,3,"I bought this beer because I wanted to see how Rogue handled the Red style. Instead what I sampled was just an over hopped IPA. All I could taste was hops, and plenty of them. It did have the red color, but it tasted like an IPA. If Rogue could just turn the hops down, I'm sure the finer quality of the red style will shine through.","bewareOFpenguin","Mar 27, 2003"

The aroma of hop flowers, cotton candy sweet, malted grains, fresh, crisp and clean a very labyrinthine nose to be sure. Sweet start, lots of malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate, finish stinging in its acidity, dynamic in its hop spiciness, dry hop bitter aftertaste seals off a very interesting and quaffable brew.","Gusler","Jan 13, 2003"

Well, actually only two, the Corsendonk and now a bomber of this. I'd like to rename this beer "Arrogant Bastard Light". That's just my opinion though. It pours a a nice brown color with large rocky had that goes away kind of quickly. As for the taste, if you'e ever tried Arrogant Bastard, you could say that this tastes like a light version. Not to say that this beer isn't good, and doesn't have a certain unique characteristic, but Arrogant Bastard Lite is all I can think about. As a rule of thumb however, you can't go wrong with any Rogue product.","HossMcGraw","Dec 12, 2002"

Not over done on the hops though, just enough to let you know this is an American ale, brewed in the Northwest.

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Had this in a 22 oz. bomber. This is another solid Rogue ale that fits my taste. It pours a deep garnet color, as the name may imply, with a durable head that laces well. The smell is typical of Rogue products - it's hoppy. There is certainly a hearty dose of those Pacific Northwest hops in this red ale. The taste, at first, is somewhat malty and sweet with a hint of the Pacman yeast, but once again, the hops penetrate through, creating an enjoyable bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, with drinkability ranking high. This a medium bodied brew, and would make a pretty solid session beer in my opinion... that is, if you like your red/amber ales with a generous dose of bittering hops. I know I do.","Jon","Sep 11, 2002"
4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"St. Rogue Red is the base for Santa's Private Reserve but with half the hops. Which is amazing to me because, as in typical Rogue fashion, the balance to this beer already leans toward the hop end. And this is good if you enjoy a mouthful of oily hops. Oh sure, the malt makes itself evident in the nose and the beginning of your draught, but the hops are kickin' its ass out of your memory in no time. Tasty!","inebrius","Sep 11, 2002"
3.65,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Reddish to light copper colored. Aromas are predominantly citrusy hops, with a small amount of malt in the background.

3.7,-2.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Fairly dark for an amber. Very dark shade of copper brown. At some angles, it verges on black. When light passes through it, it looks blood red. Head is off-white and fairly creamy. Nose is mostly citrusy, slightly floral hops. Some malt lingers underneath. Taste is a contrast between the bright crisp colors of the hops and the truly earthy taste character of the malt. It reminds me of a picture of a gloved hand, grimy from working in a garden holding the a freshly cut bright yellow flower. I know it's weird, but that's what it reminds me of. This is a bit hoppy for an amber, but a good beer.","aracauna","Aug 19, 2002"

Very balanced taste as well, some sweetness in the malt, and very noticable, crisp hop finish. Medium body, which was expected. Complimented a grilled chicken and roasted corn on the cob dinner perfectly. A very drinkable Amber Ale, the only one I had of the others listed. I thought it was very pleasant, flavorful, and balanced.","StevieW","Jun 19, 2002"
4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer had a very dark amber/garnet color to it pouring out. It formed a nice medium tan head with plenty of lace as it subsided.  The aroma was of both malt and hops which almost heralded the astringent flavor that you knew had to be coming after that frangrance. Slightly sweet, but not as sweet as others, which I think is good.  Usually the macros put a name red, but nothing to it.  Other micros add too much flavor.  This might be the proper balance, but will have to sample more red ales to make that determination.","Wildman","Jun 13, 2002"

At first I thought it was predominantly hops, but after smelling more, there's definite malt aroma too.  Medium to full bodied.  There is nothing spectacular about tasting this brew.  There's some malt.  There's some NW hops.  But I'm also getting a slightly astringint off-flavor on the tongue and especially lingering after I drink.  This is one that I ordered from Vintage Cellar and maybe it had been sitting too long.  If not, this is a very average brew from an outstanding brewery.
