"Appearance: Hazy tobacco color under a 3” foam cam that mounds up over the rim of the glass. Thick clumps of lace. Smell: Taste: Light fruits, plum, orange, citrus, peach, on the front and then strong grapefruit rind hop accent on the finish.Mouthfeel: Very creamy, smooth medium to medium low carbonation, medioum body. Overall: A beer that achieves a good balance between hops , malt and yeast driven fruit flavors."

"I liked this better than Jai Lai"
""
""
"Pours a nice amber brown color but a bit murkier than I expected.  Smell is grass, grapefruit, and caramel sith something a bit tinny on the finish.  Taste follows the nose, very well balanced, grassy & citrusy, sweet in the middle, yet finishes dry but I still get something slightly metallic at the end.  Feel is right where it should be for the style.  I like hoppy reds and overall this is super easy drinking and I enjoy it quite a bit."

"O- Tasty, reasonably unique tapioca bubble aroma and flavour. Not a bad one to have in front of you."

"Amber copper pour with beige head from 12oz can; grassy citrus nose; balanced malt and hop start; slightly resinous finish with grass and orange peel flavors. Medium lite mouthfeel with good carbonation;overall a tasty ale with a slightly bitter ending; nice."

"This is a lovely, tasty ale, reminiscent of a lower ABV version of Brown Shugga."

"Enjoyed this local brew being down in Florida for a winter get-away.  Shares a common characteristic with Jai Alai, as all Cigar City beers do, which I like.  May just be my favorite Red Ale.  Jai Alai and some of the other Cigar's are very abundant here. I didn't know about this and wasn't looking for it.  It took a while to stumble upon it.  When, I finally did, it was at a large gas station, that is 70% dedicated to craft beer.  Times are a-changin'."
"O: This beer is pretty damn good I could see drinking this one after the other without much difficulty. it's just a nice sweet malty beer that is very smooth."
"Very impressive red, didn't expect it to taste as good as it did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes... as it smells, but excellently balanced, and with a wonderful yeast profile. Caramel malt, sharp hops, chewy yeast.  Way sessionable, especially considering its ABV."
""
""
"Well done, CC. This a hoppier red ale, not especially typical of the style, though perhaps my favorite of the Reds I've had. Good balance with a bit of malty sweetness as well. I've seen a few people taste it for the first time and open their eyes wide with a ""wow."""
""
""
"O. I was surprised by this. It doesn't strike me as a typical English red ale. It's quite layered with some complexity and nice carbonation. Has done fruit elements and a decent bitterness that play very well with the major sweetnees. Was quite satisfied and would defiantly drink again. Versitile with good food pairing ranging from apple pie to a nice pot roast. Liking this beer."
"A red ale?  More like a great pale ale that happens to have a reddish color."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy.  I know I'll be having more."
""
"This is one of my top ""amber"" or ""red"" ales, and I have tried quite a few.  After the initial pour, this is one solid and dangerously drinkable ale. You would never know this ale is 7.2 ABV."

"A very ruddy red ale, with hints of orange in the pour that overweigh the browns, this is a sugary—near syrupy— red that nonetheless is well-composed enough to escape any miring, in its thickness; instead it even offers limited, though by no means leaden, refreshment via its boozy, well-bittered flavor-profile.  It is, foremost, definitely a sticky-ass beer; nonetheless, it boasts decent complexity, and does a very nice job finishing, hitting the hoppy acids hard and late on the tongue.  Aromatic oils have been mostly boiled-out, however, so the nose possesses a distinct malt-winey nose that's a bit heavier, even, than most of the other good deep-reds I've tried; any retention of citric or floral oils is expressed through the aforementioned “stickiness,” which is much sappier, woodier, or otherwise more vegetal than a drinker  might expect, even from a big red like this.  Overall, it works, but it's nonetheless less flexible or for-all-seasons than most entrants in my red-ale wheelhouse; I believe it is, in large part, a function of this being a very straight-up red: not especially or aggressively hoppy, seemingly without any late-stage or dry hopping to add any fresh-hopped notes, and not hedging at all with an adjunct element like rye to add spiciness or crunch to the big-body of the swirly-thick malts.  Still, it's good, and certainly fairly fecund—which I guess is the intellectual link between the beer, its name, and the premising patter printed on the side of the can."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint. Pours amber in color. A bit hazy. Thin white head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smell is mainly citrus. A lot of orange juice and some mango. A bit of caramel. Taste follows the nose. A nice breadiness in there, although the malty sweetness is a tad overwhelming. Very sharp bitterness. It could be a bit harsh and lingers for a little while. Mouthfeel is pretty good, if a little thick. Overall a very good amber. The hop profile is very similar to Jai Alai, but maybe less on the tropical fruit side. It reminds me of a tamer version of Arrogant Bastard."

"Had this at the tasting room. Took a couple six packs with me back to California. Great aroma with balanced hop profile all the way through and a malty backbone that isn't too sweet."

"O: Excellent, definitely one of my favourites in this style. Will give it 9 out of 10. Bought in Lakeland, FL, drank in Kansas City, MO, August 10th, 2014."
""
"Pours a deep crimson with hop aromas that explode from the can. Mouth-feel is full with an intense, yet pleasant malt backbone. Notes of sweet citrus linger long after the finish. Mild to moderate alcohol warming with a lingering sweet finish. Review is from a can purchased at Cigar City Brewing approximately two weeks after canning (3/14/14) consumed on 8/8/14."

"A real nice red ale. It was better when the first batches rolled off the line, with an accent on the hops and the malt taking a backseat. This one is much more balanced, which to this hop head, is not an improvement. Still solid and a nice representation of the style."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- this is an outstanding amber ale, the fresh citrusy hops are balanced tremendously with a sweet caramel malt backbone. If this were regularly available to me, it would be a staple in my rotation"

"O - Very enjoyable red ale that is balance with pronounce malt and hop profiles. Not a beginner beer for a red ale coming in at over 7 % abv."
""
"A refreshing ale and a good benchmark for this style, though I'm not that prevalent in this style currently."
""
""
""
"Let me start by saying that cigar city should please come to Michigan. This ale pours a handsome amber red color With a generous frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. It leaves a decent amount of lacing. The nose is balanced with a tremendous amount of hops and a very nice amount of malt. It is sweet but bitter all at once. The body is medium in nature with a lot of coating of hoppy resin and sweet malts. The flavor begins with an ipas generosity of hops followed by the sweet balance of roasty malts. This is a delicious ale with an almost unheard of amount of balance. Thus is a greatly crafted ale from a brewer that is quickly impressing me more and more."

"Tocobaga drinks ridiculously easy, smells good, and tastes great. I could do with more citrus notes on the palate, and a more explosive nose. Man, this beer is fun and easy to drink!"
""
""
""
"Clean pour with a beautiful amber color .Small head yet unexpectedly powerful hoppy aroma for a red ale. Excellent taste, starting with a citrusy hop flavor and nice malt finish. Finished the glass with the bitter hoppy flavor pleasantly lingering on my palate. Overall a very easy to drink beer in spite of its decent ABV. Would definitely drink again."

"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, suspended sediment filled, amber-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, sparse surface coating of head. Aromas of tangy sweetness, tropical fruit sweetness, and some floral hops characteristics. Flavors are tangy sweet forward, with a caramel backbone and tart grapefruit and pineapple blend, as well as some earthy notes, bitter and spiced hops profiles, and bready characteristics. Very layered and deep, especially for the style. Tasty beer. The body is full, which I was expecting after watching it pour and settle. It also leaves a decent lacing behind on the glass. The aftertaste leans more towards an IPA, with tropical fruit, heavy on the grapefruit and pineapple, bitterness, and pepper spices. The finish is slick and slightly dry, with bitter and subtle richly sweet notes. This is a bit rough around the edges, but I like it a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a slightly cloudy fire orange with thin white head. The nose is deep and earthy with heavy hop character in the form of tea, earth, and pine. Notes of caramel malts come through the hop profile as well. The taste starts with some candied malt notes and is followed by some fruity notes of tangerine and citrus as well as some piney notes. The bitterness builds but is not over the top. The mouthfeel is well carbonated with moderate body. Overall, solid beer with nice balance between assertive hops and sweet malts."

"Overall, a fantastic beer from Cigar City, and one that immediately takes its place amongst my preferred offerings in the style. I could see this particular brew appealing both to amber purists, who love that chewy malt profile, and hopheads like myself, who prefer their caramel malts with a lupulin glaze. A 'tweener, if you will."

"O-A great red ale. One of the better ones produced the balance is very good with just enough hops to provide a nice kick to the malt base."

"Pours a deep amber with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates. Not much lacing. Citrus hop and caramel dominate the nose, with nice bread notes coming through. Drinks like it smells, citrus and caramel upfront with moderate breadiness on the backend. Well balanced. Finishes malty with slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, even though I'm not a fan of the style, this is an extremely well crafted beer that is insanely drinkable! CCB continues to impress!"

"this is a really delicious amber ale.. very bready, yet very hoppy, with a nice sweet tone to it. if you don't live within their distribution, check out leuken's online, they deliver (that's how i got mine!)"
""
"Overall: Definitely a nice swig. Very balanced but both malty and hop character are allowed to shine. Worth a try for sure"
"I like this beer. It's more spicy than anything else. A spicy red ale is something I don't remember having before, but I'm really enjoying it."

"Not my favorite red ale or CCB. Worth trying though."
""

"O: A delicious beer and marks very well, except for the floaties. Tocobaga achieves a nice balance of deep maltiness and hop bitterness and remains highly drinkable. It opened up nicely as the beer warmed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tocobaga and the Humidor IPA are my two favorite regular Cigar City beers. The only place you can find it consistently in bottles is at the brewery. They are going to be canning both beers in the very near future. CCB has been using a I'm glad I live a couple miles away."

"O - Another hopped up Red Ale that I enjoyed. May be closer to a Imperial Red IPA, so damn good. Thank you Grant!"
""
""
"Dried dark fruit sweetness up front. Medium bodied that holds up well to the carbonation. Sticky caramelized glazed dark fruit bowl throughout. Faint citrus hop adds a touch of underlying bitterness but for the most part the sweetness overrides this and linger slightly. Very clean finish and smooth beer. Wish it showed a little less dark fruit. Along with the hop finish slightly dried toast flavor to help dry it out. A very clean and very drinkable beer though. Good but nothing to write home about. The alcohol is very deceptive as you cant taste it at all and it could easily pass as a 5% ABV brew."

"Yep!"
"A pretty typical red ale all over. Reddish amber pour, with a foamy cap of off-white bubbles. Malty aroma with some piney hops coming through. Taste of caramel malt and toffee, piney hops, citrus pith, somewhat metallic in the finish. Pretty average even for the style, but still a good brew. Probably overrated just because it's CC. Medium body, and decently drinkable, aside from that off-flavor, which could just be a freshness issue (didn't check for a bottle date)."
""
""
""
""
"O/D - A nice strong, hoppy red. Drinkable and flavourful. Enjoyed the amped up balance. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"This is a stellar Red Ale. It could easily be considered an American IPA. Very hop forward with excellent malt balance. If in Florida, seek this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter-tulip hybrid. Nice reddish hue with 1/4inch of cream head that lingers. Upon pouring I immediately smelled some sweet lightly toasted malts. After taking a stronger whiff the piney hops came into play with perhaps some floral/grassy notes. This red ale has a smooth light mouthfeel with a good but not overwhelming malt backbone. What surprised me was the significant hop presence in the finish that hung around for a bit. For me this threw off the overall balance and was a bit disappointing. For the style, I think the hops were too much. This one would be best described as a Red/Amber Ale trying to be an IPA. I'd have it again, but only because we don't get Cigar City in IL. If it was available in IL, I wouldn't hesitate to leave in on the shelf and grab a Bell's Amber Ale."
"Overall I can see why this is one of the higher rated CCB brews. It kills the competiton in the amber ale category. Certainly not an IPA but a great hoppiness nonetheless."
"Just another top shelf beer from CCB. I Would buy this stuff regularly if I had access to it."
""
""
""
"Poured a auburn colored body with good head on top of a classic amber ale smell of sharp, citric hops and some distinct caramel malt with some breadiness even. Hops are very prevelant in the taste and balance well with the sweet caramel malt. A hoppy, dry, crisp beer in a light-to-medium body that then picks up a little sweetness and finishes with a snappy finish that leaves you wanting for more. A great example of a red ale that is not too sweet or watery and overhopped and quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had this beer on tap at Tap 42's Cigar City event. Good beer with a pretty dark red amber color. Really likin the color. Not too heavy and very well balance taste with hops and citrus notes. Feel the nice caramel taste, very smooth finish. Hops feel lingers in he mouth, great complexity. Very refreshing."

"Overall – Maybe just a touch too sweet to drink a whole lot of, but a great american amber. It reminds me a bit of a Ithaca Cascazilla.. but better. Cigar city makes some fine brews."
""
"Interestingly I had this right after a Bell's Goes to 11 the first time I had it and they are very similar beers (which I was not expecting). I think I enjoyed this one a bit more with plenty more complexity that coats the palate with flavor that goes on forever. So so good."
""
""
""

""
""
""

"With the bitterness and hop profile of IPA, the beer is tampered by a balancing malt sweetness, starchiness, and body- it both appeases hop heads and those who prefer balance alike."
"Pours a hazy amber with heavy rusty highlights. A one a half finger cream colored caps the brew, average retention, scattered splotchy lacing. Caramel notes, citrus blossoms, and orange rind on the nose. Opens with flora and citrus specifically tangerine, mandarin orange, and pineapple. Light toffee and caramel malt midpalate. Finishes pleasantly dry with mild mandarin orange rind bitteress with more caramel accents. Abundant but gentle carbonation. Smooth, silky, fairly large malt bill and on the lighter side of medium bodied. Amber/Red Ales are certainly not one of my favored styles, but this is certainly one of the better ones I've had. Yet another winner, among many, from Cigar City Brewing."
""
"One of my favorite red ales. My wife rocks for finding me a couple bottles in Florida over her Christmas break. It borders an IPA but the malty notes of toffee and berry help it stand apart. Good stuff here and well worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O- This is a remarkable beer, and is the first I have tried from CCB. Looking forward to many more if they are half as good as this one!"
""
""
""
"A red ale I'd seek out again. Recommended."
""
"Looks like an amber or red ale but smells [3.75] like a pale ale or IPA, with the hops far more evident than the malts. Still hoppy for style in tasting, with at least as much hop presence as the surprising nose suggests. The malt is a bit more obvious in tasting, but little enough to leave this a moderately bitter and quite hoppy ""red"" ale. Relatively high ABV is almost completely hidden in the flavor and aroma, but lends some harshness to the feel."
""
""
""
""

"O - A very tasty red ale. The bold and tropical heavy hops and kept in check by plenty of rich bread and caramel notes. Great beer."

"Overall, a delicious beer that is a surprisingly good red ale, pleasant to drink and has a nice long bitter aftertaste. One of the better of the CCB beers I have tried thus far."
"Overall- Alright, aroma and flavor certainly average to above average. The rest, however, is a bit of a mess and really reminds me of a couple mediocre batches of homebrew I've had (and sometimes brewed) in the past. I'd bet it's better on tap, but a bottle's what I've got."
""
""
"The beer is deep amber, almost a reddish copper in color; there's a small head with consistent lacing present; it smells crisp with clear hints of hops up front; subtly grapefruit-y and citrus-y; very well-balanced 'red'; pleasant hop flavor w/o being too overwhelming; some additional notes of sweet fruit, like a pineapple or kiwi...muted, but present; very smooth and almost a silky mouthfeel; a little dry bite on the backend coming from the red ale side of this beer; overall, very quality and completely sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is such an amazing beer. Flavor and mouthfeel are spot on. I've always wondered if Cigar City beers were overrated but, if this is anything to go by, they've earned their hype."
"Overall (4.0): This winds up being a surprisingly mellow beer, in my opinion. Don’t get me wrong, it’s plenty hoppy and has a good dose of bitterness but it’s nicely balanced, and doesn’t harass or assault the palate in quite the way Jai Alai can. Also, it seems that the hop profile used in this beer fits the malt body surprisingly well, and in a way that suits the style: the hop profile of Jai Alai would not be as good of a fit for this beer, nor would Tocobaga’s hop profile be as good of a fit for Jai Alai. They’re well-matched. Overall, this is a very solid beer and absolutely worth seeking out if you’re a fan of this style."

"O: Very enjoyable beer. Got this one down pretty easily, would gladly drink again."

"Overall:  Stoked to be able to finally get a can relatively fresh.  So much better, and still amazing 32 days in."
""
"Overall pretty good, nice hop presence that doesn't get overly bitter, nice malt presence as well that gives some decent flavors and backbone, a touch of the yeast coming through as well. A well done beer."
""

"Overall: Most Amber Ales dominate with caramel sweetness and bring along the hops as an afterthought; this one turns the equation inside out and delivers a great hop profile that is backed up by the caramel - highly recommended"

Before drinking this beer, I was not overly excited about venturing into red ales, but now I could not be more eager to have another. I am also disappointed that this was my only bottle. This is a beer I would love to have in my fridge at all times. It is just spectacular. 17.5/20"

"Overall: One of the best beers I've had the pleasures of drinking."

"D/O- Very balanced, highly drinkable even for the 7+% alcohol. Didn't know about this one until recently. Would want to have again. Great job with a ""normal"" beer Cigar City!"

"O/D-Really ecstatic to be able to try this brew. Unfortunately I was a bit let down. Perhaps this was a bit old. Not as hoppy as I was expecting. The beer in its current state was tasty and balanced but I wanted more from this brew. Could be more dynamic. I will search this one out again and make sure its fresh and compare. Score will be edited accordingly."
"I can think of no red ales that achieve this depth and body"
"Nugget Nectar aims to be more of a traditional bitter IPA, this thing goes for a West Coast super tropical fruit Amber. For my taste, this is preferred to the famed NN."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this isnt a bad beer, I just think it was perhaps not super fresh. All the players are there for this to be a solid brew, they just didnt step up for me."
""
""
""
""
"O- This was another great CCB offering. Not my favorite beer that I've ever had, but fantastic for a red ale. Lots of flavor and easily drinkable. If anything it might be a tiny bit too sweet. Definitely recommended trying."
""
"4/5"
""
"O - Beautifully crafted beer. Maybe slightly less hops with a touch more of the bready flavor would have made it epic to my taste buds."
"Overall one of the best red ales I have ever had. Cheers!"
""
""
"O- Very good hoppy amber. Hops shine, but the flavor is balanced."
""
""
"Overall, I truly enjoyed this beer! If it was available in my area, I think I would revisit time and time again."
""
""
""
""
"Once again Cigar City brewing makes me happy to live in Florida. Unfortunately, even in Florida, this beer isn't available as often as I would like, because I would like to be drinking this all the time. This is the best American red ale available, and my favorite of Cigar City's year round beers."
""
""
"Overall, this is a very good red ale. It's hoppy, but still with prominent maltiness."
""
""
"Cost: $12 for a six pack."
"The really wonderful surprise, however, is the most wonderful toasted-cherry-like aftertaste, even though this is not a fruit-flavored brew. This sweetish aftertaste and the bitter hops are perfectly balanced. Fantastic beer!"
""
""
""
""
"EDIT: I've updated the ratings to reflect a fresh bottle I had from a recent batch. The comparison is nearly non-existant. Much hoppier, more citrus character and the malt is less sticky sweet. Also (or perhaps as a result), the alcohol presence is significantly decreased. Much improved."
""
""
""
""
"O - Smelled really nice, but taste didn't quite deliver for me."
""
"Overall - Very nice flavors without anything being particularly standout. Good stuff."
"O: Impressed by this beer, really nice. Leaves me with a really good look on CCB beers. Can't wait to try some more!"
""
""
""
"O: Overall, a very god example of the style.  Really tasty, with good drinkability.  Suprisingly sessionable considering the ABV.  I recommend. 4"
""
"This is medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. My immediate reaction to this brew based on the nose and secondly confirmed by the taste was that this is Florida's answer to Nugget Nectar. Fans of hoppy reds or imperial reds will really enjoy this. Nicely done cigar city, I would enjoy more of this!"
""
""
""
"A really nice red. I like the malt profile, and the citrus hops are very juicy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A red ale I’d have again. Thanks Chris!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Unfiltered reddish brwon, with an offwhite head. Relatively dense lace and a good film. A good bit of malt in the nose, caramel and some a bit of toasty malts. Grapefruit and some darker fruits perhaps, almost berry-like. Fairly sweet, but some nice hop character as well. Lots more caramel malt on the palate, and similar hop characteristics - a bit herbal and a dash of pine in the finish perhaps as well. Fruity but more of a malt show than anything. Medium full feel, and medium low carb with a smooth feel. Easily consumed, a tasty red ale - glad to have 5 more in the pack."

""
""
"Overall I am loving this one wish I had picked up more then a sixer. If available in my area this would move up to my go to amber."
""
"With the exception of freshly bottled Jai Alai I believe this is one of Cigar City's best every day beers to date, and it gives fresh Jai Alai a neck and neck run for it's money! Highly recomended!"
""
""
"O- Overall, this is a very solid red that is very drinkable. Another great beer from Cigar City that I will definitely purchase again from time to time."
""
" Overall this brew is a winner and so is Cigar City. This is up there with Nugget Nectar in my book. Wish I could get a hold of this on a regular basis."
""
""
"M: Mouthfeel is very nice, sweet breadiness, and a bit astringent. Overall a very solid amber that drinks like APA."
""
"O: Not a huge fan of this beer. Something about the taste is off. I've had this many times, a bunch of different batches, and it's always the same. Pretty disappointing. I'll never seek this out again."
""
""
""
""
"O: a very complete effort. Complex and enjoyable as a session beer for those who enjoy hops. This will become a staple for me. Another great effort by the folks at CCB."
""
"You cannot taste the alcohol, but is relatively strong. Not a great beer, but a very good amber."
""
""
""
"O. This beer is as good as I remember. I would love to run a little hop through it. But a unique red hoppy ale...beats Nugget Nectar any day."
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel and very easy to drink. This is a complex brew that seems to be a dizzying mix of a red, amber, brown, and IPA. Bottomline is that it is very tasty and I would love to have this as a regular offering. Rock solid."
"Picked up this beer the other day from Italian Market in St. Petersburg and I must say this beer has such a great hoppy taste. It has a very complex yet not bitter finish. Looking forward to trying more beer from Cigar City. If this beer is any indication, I think I might be in for some more pleasant surprises from my local Tampa brewery. I am thinking about heading over this Saturday for the opening of their Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout. Anyways this Red Ale is fantastic and highly recommended!!"
""
"O - Very enjoyable beer. Got this one down pretty easily, would gladly drink again."
""
""
"W- If it was a woman, it'd be the sexy, unassuming librarian who comes off sweet at first but reveals a sensuous and unexpected side once you get her home."
""

"A winner. No wonder this went from pilot batch to production in 12-ounce bottles so quickly. I see why it's so popular."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O- This is one of the staples of Cigar City's regular lineup. A must-try for people who like red ales."
"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my trusty Surly pint glass. Pours a nice reddish amber hue with an ample head of about three fingers width tall...although it fades in a hurry. The nose is very muted. This is almost a stone cold neutral smelling beer. The taste is stellar. This is one of the most flavorful, delicious, drinkable beers I've had in recent memory. It has a minor hop profile with some very pronounced malts in the background. There's also a very minor citrus tone to it. The mouthfeel is also stellar. Smooth as hell with only a minor bitter finish. Overall, this is an awesome beer. I could drink this regularly with no problem."
""
"O - I was surprised by how hoppy this beer was. I like hoppy beers but I actually found this a little astringent. I can see how this could become a favorite if I could drink a ton of these all the time. For those who can't get this, I'd compare it to a really hoppy version of Red Chair NWPA from Deschutes. Definitely worth trying and one I would gladly drink again."
""
""
""
""
"O: My favorite amber and when fresh like this one very hard to find a better amber ale out there."
"O- Tastes more like a barleywine than a red ale, but pretty decent."
""
""
""
"O: B+ on the old grading scale. Might have been higher without some of the flaws in appearance and smell. Those yeast particles really were offputting to me I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: [DRINKABILITY] Definitely an above average amber ale and somewhat unique in this arena. The hop bill certainly solidifies this..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not usually a huge fan of red ales but I did enjoy this one quite a bit. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice beer - one of the best in the category. Picked it up (last one) for $10 for a 6-pack at Ward's. Happy to see it there. I've had it on tap before and it"
"O-I like this one. I'd buy it again without hesitation."
""
""
"o - overall, a very interesting take on the amber style. the hoppy ipa in there seems to clash with the red a bit, but makes for an interesting blend of flavoring. certainly worth a taste or a few...probably pretty polarizing. amazing for the hop heads, but a bit of an identity crisis for the style police."
""
""
""
""
"This guy reminded me of the big hoppy monster on steroids. This is the amber ale that haunts the dreams of a hop head and is seriously worthy of some recognition. Awesome beer, especially this fresh."
""
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a great and tasty red ale. It isn't a classical red ale but it is a great American take on one. I'd definitely recommend anyone to try this beer."

"Very solid beer. Got better as it warmed just a little."
"One of the best straight-up reds I've had, this brew has a fantastic layering & depth that's lacking in the majority of the style. Excellent beer."
"Overall: The IPA feel of this brew was great. Loved the hop, citrus aroma and taste. Cannot wait for this two come in six packs! Cheers!"
"O: This makes a very good hoppy autumn beer, I am not sure I would want it when it was summer (especially a FL summer), but it is great when it is rainy and 40 degrees outside and I am not ready for a RIS. Worth seeking out, recommended."
"Pours a nice brownish red color that lets in only a bit of light. The lacing clings in off white patches along the glass. The nose has a very nice hoppiness to it. Inviting bouquet of pine and sweet malt entices. The taste is clean and hoppy up front and offers some sweetness in the back. Clean, crisp and dry mouthfeel is suiting for the style. Overall, another bomb ass brew from CCB, and a great representation of the style."
"O - I like hoppy amber ales, and this is one of the best I've had. Would definitely get this again."
"This beer pours a cherried wood in color, medium in body, with an off white lacing around my snifter. It smells of light and piny hops, some cherry, and clean malts. I definitely didn't expect it to be this hoppy. It's simple yet really nice. The flavor too is pretty simple but overly effect. It features flavors of slightly sweet malts and really clean, and not overly sticky bitter hops. It's just really approachable and easy to drink. For an amber, it's pretty stellar. Never would I have imagined this beer to be so hoppy. Yet again, another great beer from Cigar City."
"O) This is what I was hoping for with Cigar City. Glad I got to try this one. A fantastic beer for sure. Hey Uncle Mark, when you drive the Caddy back from Florida in the Spring, load some of this in the trunk for me."
"O - My second CC beer. While the nose was tough to pick up, everything else was great. Very good and a memorable red ale."
"Not a bad offering at all."
"Overall: I love a good red ale, and this beer is exactly that. This beer is incredibly well balanced, and very drinkable. I just polished off this 750ml by myself and I would not mind having a bit more."
"Overall, very good, complex and interesting. Wouldn't drink a lot."
"O - Another solid offering from CCB. This is a good change of pace and an example of subtle characteristics making a good beer."
"Overall this is a very well made amber. A bit on the strong side, but quite flavorful, and well worth trying. My first beer from Florida, and it's a good one."
"D: Another solid offering from CCB. A nice take on the style. Love the hop chaos."
"Poured a dark amber-red with a creamy white head that fades to a slight soapy haze. Lovely nose of sweet amber malt and dank, piney hops. Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of pungent pine and grapefruit hops backed up by the sweet amber malt backbone. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and crisp carbonation. Overall an excellent Amber that can stack up to the big boys (N.N. & Zoe) easily. So glad we can get it here in Georgia now!"
"Overall I'm both disappointed that it took me moving across the country to have beer like this originate from Tampa but delighted to get my hands on it. Will certainly be looking forward to more."
"O: I really really enjoyed this beer, truly one of CCB's most awesome style examples of how far they can take it. I think it's more of an Imperial Red but I'm not complaining. I'm going to be getting this on growler a lot more frequently."
"Overall: This was a pleasantly surprising beer. The taste is excellent though it has a little alcohol that comes through but the taste is complex. This may be my favorite of the cigar city beers I have tried."
"O- A good beer, but I was a bit disappointed based on the reviews."
"O: this was the second beer of the night while at CCB and they kept delivering. Highly recommended."
"O – Solid CCB offering here. It’s a big malty ale. Nice bite all around and a pretty easy drinker. This is one to try. No disappointment here. Will be getting more."
"Beer is thick, seriously thick, heavy on the malt in the front, middle and back. this is a malt bomb. tastes pretty good though, just too heavy for me, especially for such a big bottle. It was good and I'd have it on draft again but not again in the bottle."
"Overall, its a solid American Amber Ale. This is one of my least favorite styles, but I was really anxious to see what CCB would do with the style. They did not fail to impress here."
"O: Cigar City's Tocobaga Red Ale is one of the top two or three ambers I've consumed. It's got everything I look for within the style's limitations, plus an agressive hop profile that demands respect. Have I had better? Possibly, but this is certainly no slouch, and one which you should actively be ISO."
"Big thanks goes out to my boy Jefe73 for this one! Signed by the brewer and label artists (1 of 80???)! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, bitter hop, and subtle citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite good. Really glad CCB started to bottle this one as I have been wanting to try it for quite awhile. It did not disappoint... The Amber flavor profile on this one was definitely present and quite enjoyable. The malt backbone on this one was pretty solid and enjoyable. The citrus aspect on this one just took it to another level. Really glad I finally got to try this one!"
"O: You'd have to have a magnifying glass to detect any sort of Cigar City taste profile on this one, but it's still fantastic nonetheless!"
"Overall, an interesting and unique brew. Fun to drink. I am glad for the opportunity to sample this."
"this is a very drinkable beer, not to heavy, very flavorful but not overpowering. also just different enough to be interesting. num num."
"Overall pretty solid. I'am not that amazed by it, but it is just a good solid well done amber ale."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. Not your typical American Amber/Red Ale since it is so hoppy, but the category isn't too precisely defined in the first place. I would rank this among the best Cigar City beers that I've had. Highly recommended."
"The flavor falls back a bit from there, as the hop flavor isn't as prevalent as the nose would lead you to believe. However, there are certainly still plenty of hops. Nice brown sugar and caramel sweetness plus backing malt. Medium body that is fairly chewy and has a bitter finish that is slightly dry. Good carbonation. Really, really solid effort all around. Well worth the wait."
"This is an excellent amber, one of the better ones I've had lately with a nice balance of sweetness and hops with that distinctive CCB woody character. Good stuff."
"Overall, yeah, great. So, so, so much flavor packed into an ""average"" ABV IPA, this is crazy"
"What a delicious brew from Cigar City! The smell of this beer is amazing citrusy, and kind of like a cotton candy smell mixed together. The taste was excellent, a malty IPA with a bunch of flavors but the caramel flavor is very prominent. The mouthfeel again is great. Overall one of the best brews I have tried as of late, easy drinker to!"
"M- Nice and soft, with a little abrasive carbonation on the back end."
"Pours a deep garnet with nice clarity and a sexy frothy khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Nose has slightly roasted caramel malts, nice floral hops along with some citrus pith and some grassy hay. Nice full mouthfeel though could use a touch more carbonation - refreshing and a nice food beer. The taste mirrors the nose though i deducted points for a slight aspirin astringency. Very nicely done beer and my favorite so far from ccb, though i am still sitting on my bigger bottles from them."
"Pours a hazy red-tinted dark orange with two fingers of dense cream colored foam, settles very slowly to a thin cap. Sheet of delicate lace left down the glass. Smell: caramel and toasted grain base with a dose of pineapple. Citrus rind and a soft note of tropical fruit along as well. Taste: caramel, mildly toasty, sugared tropical fruit, blam of white grapefruit, earthiness, and a note of alcohol. Medium bodied with exceptionally creamy feel. Liked this on tap last year, love it in the bottle now. 6 packs, please. And, whoa, is this a bottling stamp from CCB? May 15 11 stamped in white on the side of the label."
"Nearly full in body, this brew has good carbonation, tangy upfront with a fairly quick fade. A citrusy hop note lingers longest, even surpassing the malt. Some warming occurs late. Another good beer from CCB."
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, if fairly unremarkable. The drinkability is absolutely stellar. This is an absolutely phenomenal brew, and I'm looking forward to the bottles they made yesterday so I can bring this bad boy home and drink it every night."
"Had agin on bottle and was very interesting, citrus hoppy, piney, with malt balance.So drinkable.Big head."
"O-becomes less complex but still stays great. i want them to bottle this. people will love this. i could drink this all night long. i find it to be MUCH better that nugget nectar."
"O: Very drinkable. The hops and malt bill is balanced nicely. A little too much alcohol comes through, which is this brew's only downfall. I wish they would've filled me a growler of this. Skal."
"D- Nice red and intriguing with the fresh hops. Enough intrigue to get me to return to this one."
"This is very drinkable and very enjoyable. Definitely one of the best reds/ambers I've had. It drinks like a hoppy pale ale."
"Amber coppery color. Pours a thin head that dissipates to nothing quickly. Quite bitter and hoppy in the mouth, but its very smooth about it. Light malt and resin flavors that are very pleasant. There is a nice tartness and a bit of dryness on the finish."
"Just an outstanding beer, very similar to Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster (which you should try if you like Tocobaga). I can't wait for them to start bottling it, I heard the newest batch was going to be bottled in 750ml sizes...not sure if its been done yet or not."
"Only problem was the gas from the growler filled me up quick. So I only had 2 glasses. Everyone else finished it off. IF you can get it, Get it!"
"Had this one on tap at the brewery. Tocobaga has a nice 1inch head that slowly dissipates down to leave a nice sticky ring atop its orange/amber body. Smells of sweet malt, lemon, and citrusy hops. Taste is just as inviting a smell. Slight sweetness with a wide hop variety. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. My all time favorite red. Appeals more to the hop head!"
"Drinkability is quite remarkable for a 7% hop-forward beer. Drinks like an English Pale Ale, and that's scary."
"D - This is really good - it's up there with fresh Nugget Nectar. I had multiple pours at the taproom, and bought a few growlers. It was probably for the best that the keg blew, as it prevented me from buying even more."
"D - Very nice, the malt and hops are perfectly balanced, especially in the aroma where the fruity notes perfectly compliment the sweetness of the toffee and caramel. The flavor hop characteristics are sharper and push back more against the malt but still leave the beer balanced and drinkable. This is another excellent beer from the boys down in Tampa, and it rivals true west coast red ales such as those from Green Flash and Stone."
"Draft. Pours a clear copper red color with a slight tan head. Hoppy citric aroma on the nose along with sweet malt and some woodiness. Nice lace left on the glass as it settles. Medium mouthfeel with good carb. The flavor starts off with some sweetness followed by flavors of citrus hops and the earthy/woody notes in the nose. For a red ale this is nicely balanced without being too maltyl. Very easy drinking as well. Ends with a lingering bitterness from the hops."
"Overall, goes down easy for the abv. Wish there was a little more on the nose but definitely an awesome beer for the style."
"This is a great example of a hopped up red ale, well done. This is one of my favorite CCB beers, they need to bottle this one."
"Highly recommend!"
"overall an excellent beer on all accounts. i would love to try this again."
"M - Just like a big IPA, this brew is a weighty medium-bodied brew, well-carbonated and smooth yet substantial."
"drinkability: I'm still waiting for CC to miss on a beer. Seems like they are perfect!"
"D: I really had no idea what this beer was until I came on here to review it (though I sort of figured it was some sort of red ale). Pretty nice, actually."
"Over all another great offering from CCB."
"D: Good Really like this one. Look forward to it's cousin...the lager version."
