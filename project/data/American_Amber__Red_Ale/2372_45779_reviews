"Overall: I'm glad I didn't throw these cute bottles out. I didn't really like it fresh, but damn! Age does this brew wonders! Fresh, I would've given this brew a 3.2, and I love Amber/Red Ales! I'm looking forward to the rest I have saved. This brew is Worthy!"

"O - Sweet and oaky with some mild bitter hops. ok."
""
""
""

"Overall - Hmm, looks, smells and drinks like a barleywine more than anything and, well, isn't that basically what it is? Maybe it was more hoppy back in October, but whatever was there is mostly gone by now. What's left is good and certainly drinkable, but it's more malty than hoppy these days. Regardless, a hell of a beer."
"Overall – While the “hoppy” in the name was never really delivered to a full extent, the boozy, fruity, and oak were very much big and monstrous, but in a rather nice way. Overall it is big, malty, and boozy with lots of oak flavors which makes for a rather nice slow sipper.  Super delisious!!"
""

"Overall, the best thing about this beer is its taste. There is this wonderful buttery and oaky woodiness that plays fantastically with the hearty, heavy, warming amber, red, and caramel malt base of the beer. These both blend with a certain oily bitterness of the hops that, although is surprisingly light, can’t easily be shaken free. The oak is also nicely representative in the nose, but here the hops are very, very hard to discern, making it a bit of a surprise that they are found in the flavoring at all. This is a tasty beer, but you’ve got to be a fan of a beer with an intensely malty base, big wood, and a lightness of hops. While it doesn’t improve upon or change the rules of the style, it is still an enjoyable find and an interesting review."

"Deep orange -amber body was a little cloudy. The barrel aging seems to have taken out some of the fizz, as the beer was lightly carbonated, and the head was less than one finger thick, and faded rapidly. The smell was very typical IPA at first sniff, with pine resin being prevalent. Deeper breaths indicated more of the vanilla, brown sugar, and toffee from the wood tannin influence. Taste was a lot more mellow than I remember the regular BHM to be. There were clearly a lot of hops, but they had melded much better with the sweeter flavors emerging from the liquid touching oak barrels. There was some brown sugar, vanilla, raisins, and butterscotch flavors coming right behind the spicy hops. The finish revealed more of the dry, oak driven tannin tastes. The finish finished quite dry and sawdust like. A little thinner than the regular monster across the tongue. I usually am not a big fan of oak aging, but Terrapin seems to have used the emerging characteristics to enhance than overpower the original beer's characteristics. The result is rounder, mellower, and more pleasing."

"O: the oak taste is strong, so are dark stone fruit flavors"
""

"D: really not a desirable brew for me. too much wood, not enough malt and hops to provide balance. not all beers should be put in oak! I actually get no hops. don't think ill be trying this one again."
""
""
"Poured into a sterilized glass, not much smell to it, however the color is a beautiful mid-brown with transparency and thickness that reminded me of iced tea. Sweet hops, slightly citrusy. Great wood Oak flavor that takes over. I agree with other fans of this beer that I taste bourbon as well."

"Overall - Well, I've taken a liking to red IPAS over the last few weeks and this one is pretty good. Terrapin did a really nice job covering up the alcohol bite considering an abv that almost hits 11%. This is a beer you need to sip on and not race to finish..Despite the name the one thing i will argue that this is not by any means a big hoppy monster of a beer haha...If this beer where named...perhaps....""Wood Burner Imperial Red Ale", it would match the flavor profile a hell of a lot better haha.... I didn't think I would like this with because i haven't liked a lot of things Terrapin has put out, but this is such a deep, complex beer that needs to be drank slow and appreciated for what it is. I like it."
""
"Overall: I dig this beer, not sure I'm getting the oak much but if it subtly adds to the profile count me in."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brownish red with a finger of off-white head that did not enjoy much retention. Hop qualities are certainly present in the nose. The flavor profile starts with malty sweetness (the sweetness could also be attributed to the mild vanilla notes) and then gives way to the hop bitterness. There is certainly a slight alcohol burn on the finish, but it is not terribly unpleasant. The oak aging appears to have smoothed out the alcohol bite, but it may also have muted the hop profile."

"Too much oak. It seems to waver off with some sips but overshadows the rest of the beer a ton. Decent hop flavors but oak oak oak."
""
"overall im impressed. quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I am impressed. And a bit buzzed. 10.3% sneaks up on you. This is a wonderful beer. Super complex and incredibly balanced. Flavors all over the map. A hoppy, malty, Imperial Red Ale spiked with the luscious tastes, smells, and feel of a good Scotch. I really can't say enough. I will definitely have again."

"One thing I love about this beer is that the hoppiness was not over done but rather steady throughout. An excellent tipple here."
""
""
""
""
"O - fairly complex, but the oak is sort of overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall, i'm happy with my purchase. this was almost $5 a bottle, or $14 a 4pk.. i know i got the worst end of the deal just buying one, but it's a beer i've been wanting to try for a few years and am just glad i did."

"Pours dark red into my tulip with a small/medium cream colored head. Aroma us heavy pine and malt, toffee, caramel, with some oak. Very nice, but worrying there may be too much oak. Candy sweetness up front, not much hop bite or flavor. A very nice mellow vanilla left on the palate that I really like here though. Maybe a hint of dark cherry. Not like anything I have had before. Sweet, bordering on too much so but the smooth finish dials it back a bit. Slick resiny mouthfeel. Interesting. As a red ale, this kills it, but classified here as a DIPA it would seem to miss the mark. I don’t think I could classify this as a DIPA, so yum."
""
"I can see what Terrapin wanted to do with this beer but feel that they fell short. The oak tastes too fake and overpowering to really work with an amber ale and the alcohol taste just does not mix with a heavy malt beer."
"2013 vintage. Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, amber coloring with golden highlights around the edges and a thin, filmy, bubbly, off-white head on the pour that disappears almost immediately. Aromas of tangy sweet notes forward, with grapefruit highlighting caramel and toffee. Roasted notes are subtle, with some woody notes buried deep in there, as well. Flavors are hop forward, with a bitter and peppery blast being followed immediately by a rich, sugary, roasted caramel backbone. Pulls together nicely. The oak characteristics take a greater hold about mid-palate, providing a balance to the strong, robust hop and malt characteristics. Some tropical fruit notes highlight towards the middle to end of the palate, where there is also two building forces of spice and booze. This thing is layered, and it is a beast. Mid-bodied, yet light considering all the big flavor profiles. The pepper really draws the line between the palate and the aftertaste, clearing the field for a tangy sweet blend of caramel and tropical fruit. Slick, lingering finish, with a slow building warmth from the elevated ABV. This one is fun, but it's a workout for your taste buds, too. Be prepared to sip and absorb."

"Overall, not a bad beer if you like this particular flavor profile. Not overly complex but the flavors that are there definitely make their presence known."
""
""
""
""
"O: I could not drink this beer. I was expecting some big hoppy delicious beer with oak, but instead I was slammed with this awful combination of plastic and alcohol flavor. I kept telling myself ""there's no way it's that bad"" and had to take another sip. Obviously it wasn't getting any better with the sips. I would say that if I was in a life or death situation where I had to drink it, then I could. Given any other beer, I probably would choose a run-of-the-mill commercial beer over this."

"Poured a 12oz bottle 2012 edition into a tulip glass. color is a deep red hue, with a rich looking but not overly large head. Smell is aromatic full of herbal, floral attributes. First taste is smoothier then expected, hops are present full of pine and earth. The oak comes through next it acts almost like a cleaning agent it takes the hops and levels it all out for an extremely easy drinking double IPA. Overall a really nice beer, I don't like to be beat over the head by hoppy bitterness i appreciate the skill it takes to turn a bold IPA into something that stays true to itself but it also equally drinkable and something i want to go back to seconds on."
""
""
""
"O- Theres a lot going on here but its well balanced and not over powering in any 1 area."

"O: Not bad, just strange. The absolute closest comparison I can make to this is a 4-month old bottle of Nugget Nectar crossed with Oaked Arrogant Bastard. I wouldn't seek this out again, but I wouldn't refuse it, either."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice IPA if you like the combination of stickiness and oak. It's not too difficult to drink."
""
""
"Overall well it looks good, aside from that not sure if aging it in oak made it bland or what. Its not that its bad per say just kind of eh what were they going for here? Think I have enjoyed the rest of Terrapins brews much more then this one."
"C+"
"O: I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it and definitely wouldn't pick up a case of it, but it was a nice change of pace and I'd probably consider getting a pint if I saw it on tap somewhere. Not Terrapin's best offering, but not their worst either."
"2012 12oz bottle into a snifter. Deep ruby with a finger of rich and frothy light mocha head. Robust look that leaves sticky swathes of lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma is an even mix of green citrus, oak and toasted grains. The taste is more strong citrus backed by a combination of sticky caramel and toast. Oak is throughout, leaving this dry and a bit tannic in the finish along with a good bit of lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied with a prickly carbonation that then gets more creamy and slick feeling underneath. Alcohol is moderate, adding a sweet spiciness to the proceedings. Not bad. I get the feeling that this might have been a little better fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good beer but not great. I almost get the feeling this beer isn't quite sure what it wants to be. With a name like Big Hoppy Monster, I would have expected more hop and less sweet malt. I'm not sure what the date is on this brew, so my guess is that the hops have started to fade a bit and the malt is taking over. I'm glad I tried it but glad I only bought a single."
""
"Overall a pretty good beer that I would have again, but not gonna go out of my way to find it."
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slightly too much carbonation."
""
""
"A beast of a beer. No secret in the name. Strong ale tendencies. Chunky and butch. Whole lotta beer in one glass. A bit showy."
""
"I have no idea why the original Hoppy Monster is now retired and this has taken its place. Seems silly to me."
"O: meh... i will admit that the alcohol is very well hidden as it sits in at 9.10%. but not the biggest fan of the balance as I continue to drink this. the sweetness if almost candy-like and therefore I feel the palate is in constant battle between the hops and this sweetness. oak is also very subtle"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad, but I pretty the hops from it's little sister."
"O- this is one heavy beer, drinks like a barleywine, a slow sipper for sure as the booze is noticeable, interesting"
""
""
""
"To me this is a barleywine or maybe even an old ale, and a pretty good one at that. But call it what you will, a good beer either way."
""
""
"Poured this one into a tulop glass, it has a reddish color body with a very small tan head to it. The smell has some vanilla coming through with some oak also, i really don't get much else from it. The taste has a big flavor of malt up front with some vanilla and oak to it. I also detect some hops on the back of the tongue. I think it is a very boozy, but has a good mouth feel to it. Overall i like this but i couldn't drink it on a normal basis."
""
"O - This brew grew on me as it warmed. I enjoyed sipping at it this afternoon and would have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Boozy and uber malty. I wouldn't consider this oaky-dokey barleywine a red ale in my book. Terrapin needs to start over on this one. Nothing special. Tastes garden-variety with an alcohol kick. I wanted to like it more, especially considering the price for a four pack, but after a few days off, it still came up mediocre in my view/taste. In the real red ale category, Nugget Nectar kicks this beer's ass down the street and past the lamp post."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. There is great balance between sweet/roasty malts and citrus/pine hops. The oak is noticeable on the palate, and works well with the other flavors. I enjoyed this slightly more than the original BHM, but I probably wouldn't pay $4/single for it again."
""
""
""
"O- Surprisingly great balance for a a ""hoppy"" beer. Yes, the hop is intense, but the malt pushes right back into the picture. Smell and MF are worth another compliment, too. I didn't really notice much of the ""oaked"" character. Maybe the mellow taste and mouthfeel."
""
"O - At first I liked it. It has a lot of complex flavors. As it warmed the alcohol and bitterness came through and were not necessarily great. The barrel aging create a mellow beer, but some flavors are a little off."
""
"Medium bodied with a nice oak barrel presence that's decently integrated into the base beer.  It's strong but doesn't completely overpower the other flavors.  Virgin oak/toothpick flavor with a little bit of spicy rye.  Again, the hops are there but are overpowered by the strong barrel and malt profile.  Hints of caramel, toffee, spicy rue and cocoa followed floral and slightly earthy hop bitterness.  A bit dry but the malts have sweetness for balance.  Abv well masked and decently drinkable but overpowering wood flavors hurt a bit.  Also, way too malty for the style in my opinion.  Not bad but the barrel character is too dominant and the hops are overpowered."
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer. It's not overpowering, it's not a ""wow"" beer but it's solid and it's big. Good winter sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I usually don't like very hoppy beers, but this is really nice. For me this was a good combination of malt and hops, I guess I could see some people wishing for a bit more"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky, deep chestnut color with a surprising amount of sediment floaties left in the bottle. A small, soapy off-white head settles to a wispy covering. Smells of dark fruit, spice, and oak over a rich caramel foundation and some sharpness from the booze. Honestly, upon first sip, this is way smoother and tastier than I was expecting. While most of the hops have faded from the aroma, they are still apparent in the flavor, though not in a big, brash, ""American"" sort of way. Earthy, tea, pine, and floral hops fuse with oak, vanilla, toffee, and moderate, spicy alcohol. Lingering oily resins. Oh yeah, this is quite satisfying. Smooth, chewy, not overly bitter or sweet. Nice!"
"O: Interesting amber ale. Strong on the breadiness, pretty much overpowers the hops. Oak is prominent too but more of an all-encompassing layer over everything. Never really stands on its own. A bit unbalanced but still unique and tasty."

"O – This is a decent amber ale. As with some other oaked beers from Terrapin that I’ve had, the oak is a bit overdone. It doesn’t necessarily taste or smell bad, but all the good amber ale characteristics are muted behind all the oak and vanilla. I’m glad I tried it, but I won’t seek it out again."
"O: This isn't truly a bad beer, but way too much oak and way too little hops. I'm not thrilled."
""
""
"O: A decent beer overall, though a bit simplistic and lacking depth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a nice attempt by Terrapin but I'm not so sure that it works. It is just a little bit of a mess. Glad I got to try it as I normally love oak aged beers but this one just doesn't really work for me."
""
""
""
"O- I like the original a bit better, but fans of barrel aging will certainly get their kicks with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very flavorful, very well balanced, very smooth, and its a big beer. Very good."

"Shared this one at a tasting while Mississipping was in town! Served from growler into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sweet alcohol, caramel, citrus, citrus hop, and oak. The flavor was of sweet malt, oak, caramel, citrus, citrus hop, caramel hop, and sweet alcohol. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If you would have not have told me this one was oak aged, I would have definitely been able to figure it out based on my first sip. The oak in this one was so strong on the flavor it wasn’t even funny. I’m sure it covered up some subtle flavors, but I do know this is what Terrapin was aiming for when they did this brew. The aroma was quite nice with the citrus going on and really kept it interesting. Glad I finally got the opportunity to try this and hope I get to try more of Terrapin’s specially treated brews out there."
""
"O: A definite big boy beer. Robust and complex with big roasted malts and a great bombardment of spiced and floral hops. This is a beer I will always look forward to. Cheers!"

"overall this beer is fan F*(^^%$#tastic!"

"Vintage 2012. Pours into a Duvel Tulip with not much head, settles quickly over super hazy almost opaque brownish/red-colored liquid. Taking a whiff of the nose reveals little oakiness but there's a nice hoppy aroma with sweet malt overtones...smells inviting. Nice smoothly carbonated mouthfeel gives way to nicely balanced hop bitterness and malt sweetness on the palate. Smooth. Finish is again nicely balanced but still not sensing any oak barrel notes...not complaining though, finishes on a not-too-bitter yet hoppy flavor note with a little alcohol warmth (it is a respectable 9.1%). Fits perfectly on this cold and damp late Dec. evening."
""
""
""
""
"Oak Aged Big Hoppy Monster pours a deep red color with a thick head that retains very well. The aroma is oaky and toasty, with some sharp hops. The taste is sweeter than anticipated from the nose, with the oak and a large amount of sweet malts really amping up the sweet factor. The candied hops only amplify this. The finish is very woody and a bit sticky from the hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and lightly carbonated, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, a good beer. I think I like the non-oak aged version better though."
""
""
""
""
"D - Enjoyable stuff, although it's verging on brown ale in malt profile. I also expected more hop aroma from a beer called Big Hoppy Monster - the bitterness is there, but it's not at all what I was expecting. Still, quite drinkable and fairly unique."
""
"Oak Aged Big Hoppy Monster pours a pretty clear ruby red, with some lighter red highlights. About two fingers of off white foam tops the beer, hanging around for a little bit before leaving a few chunks of lacing clinging to the glass. The nose is really nice, with aromas of caramel and oak mingling and playing off of a bit of resinous, piney hops. The flavor starts off with a healthy dose of caramel sweetness. A brief, but bracing bitterness follows, before allowing those same piney hops to come in. The finish though is straight oak, and a little more intense than is probably necessary. The body, while sturdy, stops well short of being syrupy or too heavy. The carbonation is definitely on the low side, in fact I'd probably say just a little too much. While this fresh bottle of oaked Big Hoppy Monster is drinking nicely, I think six months to a year of time will do some favors for the other bottle I have on hand."
""
""
""
"This was a nice amber ale. Normally, I would have appreciated the oak touches here. I'm only disappointed because I love the regular Big Hoppy Monster. The oak here takes a bit away from the lucious malt flavors that I get from the original. On it's own it's a great beer, but in comparison to the original it leaves me wanting more. No matter the comparisons, it's definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a darkish brown with good two finger white head and lace down the glass on top of a very hoppy aroma mixed with oakey and slight sweet caramel and sugary malts. Taste is more of the same, as is mouthfeel, as a sturdy, heavy but easy passing beer goes over my tongue with a mix of grapefruit like hops, sugary sweetness, touch of oakiness and a dry, sturdy finish. Hops flavor profile is mostly like a wet, grape variety, and the malts are caramel and other sweetness and the beer is not too complex but has a good amount of depth. The dry finish is a great complement to a good beer and this is a very enjoyable sipper."
"It pours a dark brown and has medium clarity. It smells very oaky and some malts are present as well. It tastes oaky and malty up front and then eases off into a pleasant hop finish. It has a big body which is a plus in my book and has decent carbonation. I would recommend but I could only do one or two before my pallet would be wrecked."
""
""
"Overall: This is a big step down from big hoppy monster. I thought it sounded good, but its just OK."
"Overall - Nothing terribly special. Too big for it's own good. I don't know why they had to make it even more alcohol than before. The oak is a nice foil to the malt, though."
""
""
"Overall- I've not had the original, but for some reason I feel like I would prefer it. Worth trying nonetheless."
"O: I want to like this beer more than I do, but than I do, but Nugget Nectar, Lagunitas IRA and Maine's Red Ale are all better than this. And, for me, those are the most comparable. I'm not quite sure the Oak adds much. It's a nice addition, but I just don't think the backbone is there. That said, it is a good beer, I'd drink it again, but I don't think I'd search it out. This would be a good extra in a trade."
""
""
"Just like the original, this is a heavy, filing, brutal beast of a beer that gets points knocked off for false advertising.; I couldn't do more than six ounces, nor would I want to. This monster doesn't even frighten to mediocrity; sub-par."
""
"Great to finally have this oaked.Poured into a standard pint a clear rich amber with a thinner slightly off white head atop that lasted well.Toastiness and brownsugar notes slightly out weigh the resiny hops,faint toast from the oak is there as well.A mix of caramel and brown sugar sweetness mixed with piney hops,again the oak is subdued wich might be a good thing.It's solid, not amazing by any strech but just a good oak aged hopped up ""big"" amber."
""
""
"O: Well balanced. Red ale style lets the wood properties shine while huge caramel malts try to fend for attention. Big, pronounced hop flavor without being a hoppy beer."
"O: Overall, another great beer from Terrapin. Ive only had the regular BHM once, and it was at about 8 months after bottling date, but I absolutely loved it. The hop presence had mellowed and it drank like a barleywine/old ale. The oak aged version also is reminiscent of a barleywine, which is a good thing as its one of my favorite styles. As of now, I like the original BHM more. However, Im gonna try to grab a couple more of these to let them cellar for a while. I imagine this one will age really well, mellowing out the hops and bringing out some of the malt flavors. At 9% with big boozy notes, this one might age well for a year or two. As is, still very good though! Definitely worth a try."
""
""
"VERY TASTY, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"O: A really surprising beer as I remember BHM being pretty bitter and hoppy and this beer is neither of those -- very smooth and unassuming with great malt backbone and a nice oak current throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was a pretty good beer. I liked that the oak complimented rather that dominated the flavors. The malty flavors were very good as well. Everything came together pretty well in it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this one... As much as the regular version? Not so sure about that. That's one of my favorite reds (might be my favorite) and it' s tough to top that beer when fresh... That being said, this is a good effort and one that I plan on enjoying while it's still around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - What a great beer. A tasty alternative to the main one!! I recommend it!"
""
""
""
"O - I love the standard Hoppy Monster. Even have the T-shirt. Absolutely love the Oak Aged version!"
"I liked the original Big Hoppy Monster but the oaked version brings it to a new level of richness and complexity. I'll be buying more and probably laying a few down to enjoy in 6-12 months. Definately worth a try."
""
""
"Overall: definite slow sipping beer. Bold flavors too."
""
""
""
"Overall: I honestly don't recall the regular hoppy monster to compare but this is a typical oak barrel aged beer."
"O: Big combination of several different types of hops works well - great hop presence and complexity that is greater than the sum of the parts"
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a nice creamy head and excellent lacing, pretty much a wall of lace. Aromas of sweet vanilla, malt, and some earthy floral hops. In the taste, very sweet upfront with mild dark fruit notes. Vanilla comes through with a lot of barrel influence. Bourbon/rum flavors come through big with alittle pine and dry oak. Roasted malts and barrel char play nicely with the smooth richness of the feel. In the finish, oaky and boozy, very creamy full bodied feel. Overall, they should call this the Big Vanilla Monster, because the hops have died down for the most part and the barrel is doing the talking."
""
""
""
"Equally as good, if not a touch better than the regular stuff. The oak aging is a little subdued and just offers another little layer of complexity to this fine brew."
""
""
"O - Totally not what I was expecting from the name. Almost no hop character, very sweet and malty, with the oak not really incorporated well into the beer. Kind of turns me off from trying the regular version."
"pours a really deep amber, nice head for oak aged, looked yummy. smelled hoppy and a bit fuity. some subtle oak notes, mostly similar to the regular hoppy tho. great taste, a bit more fruity/vanilla with a subtle oak after thought. plenty of hops along with a solid malt profile"
"D- Very drinkable given the style and ABV. Balanced enough to not overwhelm with bitterness but enough hops to keep us 'hopheads' happy."
"Pours an appetizing, translucent mahogany with a fine-bubbled, slightly reddish tan head. Aroma is richly hoppy and has undertones of spice and wood. Flavor is strongly hoppy but not bitter with a definite oaky undertone and hints of cinnamon candy. Smooth, lively texture leaves a woody, slightly smoky aftertaste. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Pretty nice and very different but the wood is a bit too dominating for my palate"
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a dark chestnut with a nice cap that leaves some lacing. Nice citrusy hop aromas come through on the nose as well as lightly sweet malt and just a hint of oak. Nicely balanced and not overdone. The taste reflectss the same components and is equally balanced, which is nice beacause ocassionally this brewery overoaks some of their beers. Not this one, a very deft hand with the oak here. Just right, a nice beer, nicely enhanced."
"Drinkability: Some oak jobs I love and some, well... I found this top by a bit over-the-top. Personally, I would be much happier to have just the plain ole', regular BHM."
"D - 2 is my limit, before I need a couple pints of water. It's really nice, but you can't have that much of it."
"Deep ruby with brown highlights. Smaller off white head without much lacing. Smell is remarkable. The oak is in no way overpowering and adds another level of complexity to this already great beer. Brings out more of a pineapple scent on top of the base smell. Still caramel and that lovely brown sugar. Also pine and light citrus hops. Seems like there are even hints of coconut. Very light oak and wood presence. Just lovely. Taste is much of the same. This is one beer that I almost wish there was more oak presence, which is seldom the case as many are overdone. Still, very nice and gives the regular flavors a chance to shine while adding complexity. Great mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation. Moderate bitterness balanced with the malt sweetness. Not too thick and just about perfect. I could have had a couple more pints of this one. It is easily approachable and the oak flavor is in no way dominating. Very, very great beer. Who would have thought Big Hoppy could get much better? It does."
"D: Had two pints before hitting the door. Will revisit this one again before they blow out the keg. My only wish is this one showed a bit more of the wood. That being said, it is my favorite Terrapin brew to date."
"When all was said and done, this was easily one of my favorite beers of late. I would love to and , and plan on having this one again very soon. Solid from top to bottom."
"Drinkability: About as drinkable as the regular Big Hoppy, with a nice added tasty bonus. Abv% is still up there, but it's also well-hidden, and it's about as tasty and aromatic as the original too - the barrel aging adds precisely what you'd imagine it would. So it's nice, but not amazing."
"D- It was a great experience to try the oak aged version of this beer and its a very good beer, but I think I prefer the fresh hoppy flavors of this one in comparison to old hops with a nice oak aged flavor component. Still great to try this rare beer."
"Notes: One hell of a beer and an instant classic for hop heads. I was glad to have tried it even if I am not among the hop heads."
"This is a very good beer. I don't know if they are bottling this, but if they are, pick some up. Or just grab a pint next time you are at BSP."
"Drinkability is great. I would've had a few more of these had I not had a few others on my must-try list. Definitely give this one a shot if you see it around."
"I'm probably biased as BHM is my favorite Terrapin brew, but I really, really like this beer and I was floored at how much the floral hops showed throw even with the oak aging. A fantastic beer."
"D - This is a complex beer worth trying. I enjoyed drinking it slowly. Between the alcohol and the richness, one is enough."
