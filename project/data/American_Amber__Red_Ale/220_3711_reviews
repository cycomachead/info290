"six pack from Winter Haven ABC - good, but I was a little disappointed after all the hype."
""

"A very fine carbonation and a little bitter, somewhat oily feel not very complex and a little overpowering bitter at the finish. Overall an average result that I won't rush to duplicate."
"O - 3.5 - Simplicity is the theme here. It isn't anything to write home about, nor sip slow and savor. This is a session beer. This is a good food pairing, yard work and shower beer. As it stands, I would have liked either a little more malt or a little more bitterness, but it does its job nonetheless as a standard, basic amber ale. Definitely better than many I've had."
""
"What is not to love about this beer? I love the description as a rich copper ale, because is is gloriously rich for such a simple beer. Easy to overlook, but this just has everything that is great about amber ales."

"Deep copper color rich caramel light sulfur. Big sweet caramel maltiness with little to counter. Needs more hops imho."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad but the floaties were not pleasant. Won't buy again."
""
""

""

""
""
"Finally got to try this one after having the whole line-up mutiple times over. It is a great copper ale well balanced with just the right amount of bitterness."
""
"Its look is definitely copper and the taste has a pretty smooth yet a little bitter taste. But the taste isn't super flavorful. Its an okay beer for this brewery. They have a lot better beers."
""
""
""
"Definitely a copper color. Very little head which is a khaki froth. Smells like carmal, malt, some floral, just atiuch of citrus. Tastes if malt, pine and of course, orange. Mouth feel is carbonated with a real nice back of the tongue bitterness. Dry. Not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: After reading other reviews, I wasn't expecting very much from this brew, but was pleasantly surprised! A little too sweet for my taste, but combined with a malt complexion, Censored has enough going for it to help round out the hoppy character. One of my new favorite Ambers!"
""
""
""
"As ambers/reds are my favorite style, I had to give this a try. It's not bad and you can taste the higher alcohol content versus a beer of the same type like Avalanche or Fat Tire, but this beer is wonderful on the palate."
""
""
""
"meh, its so so. pretty bland"
""

"Enjoyed from a 12 oz bottle in a pint glass, this nice copper ale brilliant copper color with a thick white head that lingers to a thin pooling layer and great lacing.  Nose of rich caramel malts, spicy hops, and figs.  Flavors are delightful for the style, sweet malt up front with hoppy bitterness to the rear.  Flavors of fig and as it warms vanilla become pronounced and vying for pole position over the hops.  A great session ale with a lingering bittering hops aftertaste.  Very sessionable.  Worthy."

" is a winner, so is this beer. Deep copper visually, smooth, creamy flavor that has a slight bitter after-taste... love it. A burp taste will leave lasting memories. I was paying $5.50 a glass at a local craft brewery for a beer that is similar, but not as good. Hopefully, when America's fascination/fad with session IPA's wain and those overly hopped, citrus maximus beers are no longer it, great beer such as Lagunitus Censored will get it's chance to shine."

"12 oz Bottle. Slight smell of grapefruit maybe slight Lemon and of course Hops.Taste is a fairly smooth beer with a 6.7ABV.I just can`t say enough about Lagunitas products.They consistently put out quality beer at a great price.Give this a try it rocks.Not as good as there Imperial Red but still pretty good."

"Pours a rich dark copper amber with a large creamy lasting beige head and good lacing throughout. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, pine hops and a bit of citrus. Taste same as aroma. Palate is medium body, good carbonation and a smooth mouth feel. Finished with a flavorful caramel malt taste and some nice pine floral hops for balance. Aroma and Taste slowly intensify as it warms up. Overall a very good and nicely balanced brew."

"Overall - A nice beer but not a true Amber. The malt flavor was a little thin and the hops, for an Amber, were a bit much. Also, the beer is a little lacking character. Again, a nice beer but a little two-dimensional."

"one of the better amber types in the game, this one is clear reddish in color with a frothing and lasting off white head over an inch tall. it has a pleasant nose of tangy hops over a robust copper malt body. much less sweet than other American takes on the style, which lends to increased drinkability for my palate. not over hopped, but certainly aggressively done, which makes this sort of a style hybrid between the more conventional amber ale and the new red ipa types. not quite on the ipa level, this one finishes much more balanced, with the rich caramel malty flavors sticking around on the palate for a little while after the swallow. the mouthfeel to me is the best feature, full bodied but drinkably dry, creamy and expansive, and well enough carbonated. not a reinvention of the genre by any stretch, but a clever Americanization of a style that probably needs a facelift more often than not. well done beer from lagunitas here."

"The sharp citrus hop notes and moderately bitter finish counter a slightly rich malt character to make for an overall pleasant experience. Nothing spectacular, but very easy drinking."

"Overall, this is an interesting and flavorful brew. The closest analogue I can muster is Domaine Dupage, although the flavors here are more coarse and strident. It's not something I would seek out to enjoy, but it's worth trying."

"Very unorthodox in its approach this copper ale is nicely diverse and quite flavorful."
""
""
""
"O) An okay brew."
""
""
"All I can figure is I originally got my hands on an older bottle that hadn't fared well. Lesson learned, this one doesn't age well, drink it fresh and enjoy."
"O: Considering that the original name for this ale was the ""Kronick", and that it truly delivers on the rest of the label, this gets a big thumbs up for living up to the hype. Likely to be one of my favorite regulars to stock in the fridge. Truly enjoyable in the style."
""

"An enjoyable, yet unspectacular, example of the style. Solid, balanced, and tasty, but nothing I can't get from a local brewer."

"Mid to dark brown with a rather frothy head of two fingers that sticks around for a while and laces nicely. Rather malty smell with a mix of caramel and brown malts maybe a bit sweet smelling. Hop aroma is somewhat muted with only a touch of floral hoppiness coming through. The malts are there in the taste as well as the base of this beer is a solid maltiness, but it is not sweet. This is quickly followed by bitterness that comes through without much hop flavor with just a weird almost astringent bitterness, I'm not that thrilled honestly. This beer is relatively light with a good amount of carbonation the finish is dry with the strange bitterness. Overall I cant give this very much in the way of praise I did expect much better from this one given what I've heard about it from others."
"O: Relatively easy to drink and enjoyable - a touch sweeter than I usually enjoy my beers and I would appreciate just a touch more bitterness and hop presence in it. Alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
"Overall - Enjoyable copper ale."
""
""

"I love Lagunitas and the nuts who work there. These beer poured a nice copper color with a thick head that fizzed away after a minute but left nice legs. The smell was very hoppy with a lot of floral notes to it. The taste was even better though, because even though the beginning had a lot of hop flavor, the middle and end were much more balanced and created a nice smooth beer. Very refreshing with earthy tones in the end leaving a clean finish. Would definitely pick up another six of this."

"Pours a golden, clear amber with nice lacing rings on the glass. Smells are sweet, caramel malts, some fruit from the hops in this brew. Tastes balanced. Nice malt/hop ratio. Biscuity and sweet with just enough hop profile. Mouthfeel is also balanced with some carbonation and fullness. Overall, a pretty decent brew. I would buy it again although there are a few other Lagunitas brews I prefer over this one. Cheers."

"O: Not too bad. A decent offering from my favorite brewery. It's nice to know that they can make something that's not bombarded by hops. Personally, it strongly reminds me of a scotch ale because of the very earthy and peaty tones. For one of my first copper ales, I like it. Definitely recommended."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 2/26/2014. Pours slightly hazy/cloudy orange copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malts; with good strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, grapefruit, caramel, toast, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/hop balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice amber ale. All around good balance of citrus/floral hops and caramel/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: A descent beer, but kind of all over the place. Nothing really sticks out strongly to me. The mouth isn't too bad, as said, but could use a little thickness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good effort, but a little unbalanced in the malt department. If the body was thicker, the malt flavors would come out better, I think. But at the thickness of the body, some more hop flavors are needed."

"I was blown away by this one. I expected a good product, but wow! I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy. Refreshing... What are you waiting for? Grab this one!"
"O - A middling beer from a great maker...perhaps mine had sat for a long time, not sure"
"Good, easy drink from the bottle. Great color and mouthfeel. Taste slight over powering of grain malt taste. Rich - but not with the full mouth fell - classic red ale flavor as it should be. Right balance between malt and hop. I prefer the more hop taste versus a more malt taste. Nice beer. Would drink again."

"CENSORED : Originally called the Kronik, this beer was censored by the federal label-approving agency, the BATF — they claimed the word had some sort of Marijuana reference. We slapped a “Censored” sticker on it as a joke and they accepted it. Whatever."
""
"The taste begins with a barley malt character but it does not take long for this juicy orange fruitiness to kick in and moderate into a lingering bitterness at the end."
""
"O-it's not mind-blowing but it is tasty and well made."
""
"This ale pours a beautiful clear red copper color with a small off white head which is short lasting resolving to a slight cream colored lacing. The nose is roasty and sweet. A lot of maltiness with a slight touch of bitter hoppiness. This ale sips smooth and light to medium bodied. Easy on the palate; definitely an ale that could be sessioned easily. The flavor is balanced between sweet malt and bitter hops. It's not a complex beer by any means but definitely well balanced and brewed. As a long time fan of this brewery, this is by far not my favorite of their offerings by a good solid beer none the less."

"Lagunitas' take on the amber/red ale style pours a rusty red to brownish color, a little hazy and with ample carbonation to start. My initial pour yield nearly an entire glass of off-white to light tan foam that quickly settled down. Nice lacing as per most Lagunitas beers I've had. Aroma was malt forward and fruity ... Caramel creme, biscuits, sultanas, some grass and lemon. One of the more complex and nuanced red ales I've had, plumb this one for different flavors although the complexity does not detract from the drinkability. You can dissect this beer or you can just knock a few back and be content either way. Ginger snap cookies, graham crackers, and dry biscuits, red grapes, orange and lime hop flavors, powdered sugar, some other sort of fruity but floral note (plums? almonds?) ... All reveal themselves but no one flavor overpowers or dominates. Some light brown sugar character is the backbone, with a semi-dry finish of unripe pears, hop bitterness, and metal that might be a little coarse. Alcohol blooms as you go and this is high ABV for the style, a nice touch. Quite a lot of diacetyl character but this is a positive for me, with hopping like a pale ale and a nice balance between mainstream appeal and nuance for someone who wants to go slow."

"This is Lagunitas’ version of an Amber and it pours a nice deep copper color with a significant creamy head. Lagunitas has dialed back the hops a bit with a much maltier profile that exudes caramel, toffee, and rum. There are the signature hops on the back end to leave you with a slightly bitter finish, because this is Lagunitas after all. I am having trouble finding a bad Lagunitas beer and each new offering I try keeps leaving me impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 3.0 - NOT a great beer. Completely unexpected for lagunitas. Missing the citrusy hoppiness and sweet malts I want in an American red ale. It compares more to Bell's Amber Ale (Also not good) than it does to Oskar Blues G'knight."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body barely, middle of the road effervescence. Slightly drying but very warming for the style. Feels like an Imperial stout in that regard. A well done brew ""hat isn't a hop bomb thankfully."
""
"Overall: a decent beer but falls short of what i expect of lagunitas."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm still pleased, but was left just a little shy of expectations."
"Overall pretty good. Reminds me of an altbier more than an amber. Not Lagunitas' best effort but worth a try. Much sweeter than I expected - especially from these guys"
"Overall- Above average, almost good beer. I like its accessibility but it is a little boring. It's a drinking beer more than a sipping beer. Worth a try. I know I will keep buying it from time to time."
"I've been sampling this brewery's offerings fairly regularly lately. I think they discovered that it's worth shipping a few cases of brew to such backwaters as my town (hint- Butte, Montana, Hennessey Market, Front St. Market, Albertson's, etc). In any case, I find this beer to be one of the very best I've had in the past year. The hops compliment, rather than overpower, all the great malt complexity of this beer. Send more! (and other varieties too!!)."

"Pours a dark amber hue with a two finger head that doesn't hang around long and leaves a subtle rim of lacing,the smell is toffee,caramel,marzipan and butterscotch basically it's all about the malts,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with above moderate carbonation and starts off quite sweet with butterscotch and toffee first to hit you followed by a herbal slightly fruity hoppy bitterness and overall it's alright without being great and glad I've tried it but wouldn't rush out again for it cheers."

" It’s interesting having this beer because last summer I consumed SO much Lagunitas IMPERIAL Red, which is just an overly hopped amber ale (super delicious)… so having this considerably subtle, sweet amber ale done by a west coast brewery that loves making hoppy beers is quite delightful. I think my favorite part about this beer besides the balance where you don’t even taste the almost-seven percent alcohol is the foam that floats atop the beer the entire time that you drink it. If you like Lagunitas Brewery for their intensely hoppy beers, God bless you, but give this a shot for a change because it’s an awesome beer to hang out with."

"this beer ours a nice copper brown. a little head with a lot of lacing. smell is sweetish and malty. the flavor is bold and malty with a nice sweetness and the right amount of hops. they took this ale and made it really drinkable with out watering down the flavor. also, there is a smooth finish....they guys at lagunitas did this one right."
"Overall, I was really excited going in. The look, and smell set this beer off to be great. The taste lacked some body and felt a slightly watered down. I am being hard on this beer since I wanted and expected it to be great initially. It's still really good, I will definitely have this again."
"O-This might be my least favorite Lagunitas brew, but that doesn't mean its a bad beer. I just found it a little pedestrian, especially for 6.75% ABV. Also, when I see copper in the label, I guess I expect a little more citrus hops or intriguing rye spiciness or something...whatever it is that I was expecting, it wasn't here."

"O: A very good, unexpected beer from Lagunitas. When I think of Lagunitas, I think of extremely overpowering hops and not a lot of complexity. This beer is the complete opposite of my presuppositions. It's extremely malty and has pretty much very little hop flavor to balance it out. This isn't a bad thing, however, as the maltiness lends an amazing complexity to this moderate ABV beer. I would buy this again on a brisk, cool late fall or early spring day."

"This is a remarkable and unique red ale. The hops are not so grapefruit-dominated but instead much more subtle and complex. I'd like to know what sort of yeast was used, the sour esters and bit of licorice taste make this so tasty. And that is from someone who is no Amber fan."
""
""
""
"O. Its a decent presentation of an amber ale and worth a try if your a fan of this style."

"good Job Lagunitas."

"Censored pours a clear, rusty-copper color with an inch of off-white foam capping the brew. Rich aromas of caramel dominate, with just a touch of grain and fruity hops noticeable. Caramel and bready flavors open on the palate and are met with a moderate level of spicy and fruit hop bitterness on the finish. A higher level of carbonation, and a medium body round out the mouthfeel of this crisp finishing beer. Joking or not, these guys make GREAT beers!"
""
"Appearance is clear copper, with an average sized head and good retention. The smell is pretty weak, but I detect mainly bready malts with a bit of lemon scent. The taste is sweet malts up front, with a piney resinous bitterness picking up through the finish. A good beer overall, but nothing really stands out to make it exceptional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer. Well-balanced. Sweet, but not overly so with a bitter kick on the finish to keep it from getting cloying. Not the most interesting or exciting beer in the world, but easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall-This is a tasty amber ale a little on the sweeter side with great smoothness and drinkability."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is indeed a rich copper ale. Goes great with steak or a ham sandwich and is overall, a solid beer, worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It could stand to be a bit more polished, but I like the direction Lagunitas is going with this one. For once they left their token hop profile aside and let the malt bill do some of the talking."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'd call this a session beer, but with pretty balanced taste. A good beer, that I'd be happy to entertain again, but not something truly remarkable."
"Peace!"

""
"O: I was mostly intrigued by how this beer got it's name. It's a funny story buried in the Lagunitas website. Beer itself isn't bad, but doesn't really stand out either. It is well balanced with fairly subtle flavors."
""
"Overall – Good.. but pretty boring. I know it's not really an exciting style, but I figured Lagunitas would put a spin on it. Not something I'd pick up again."

"The Verdict: Good beer. Not much in the way of hops, just lots of malty goodness. A quality brew that goes down smooth."
"This is one of my favourite go-to, chill beers. It goes down pretty easy and isn't too ""in your face"". I've split a few with some friends who never drink anything funky, and they quite liked it too. It pours a nice copper colour with some notable hop nose, but you definitely pick up a sweet malt. Low head due to the alcohol, but nice lacing throughout. I actually find it to be one of the most pleasant-smelling beers around and I think if someone made a scented candle that smelled like this one, I'd light it and have a nice relaxing bath with a glass of this in hand. This pairs really well with pub food and is a good, higher gravity beer that should get any parted started. The alcohol is slightly warming and very pleasing."
""
"Would I buy it again? Probably."
"Summary - Meh, it's just okay. I don't mind some hops on occasion. It's fine for a red ale."
""
""
""
""
"Nice session amber. Fairly straightforward amber, with a nice bit of bitterness, really sessionable and pretty tasty stuff."
""
""
"Taste: The front has a sweet caramel and almost honey sweetness, but the back has an excellent balancing of floral hops and quality malts that creates a very pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness is there in the finish a little bit, but it's a nice way to take away the sweetness that comes with the beginning of each sip. Mouth feel's prickly at first, but creamy on the finish -- probably the best part about the beer, as it helps to make everything come together."

"Dark amber, about an inch and a half of head. Smooth, good taste. Not bitter (which is good in my book). Long finish. Overall, a very good beer. Was given this by a friend from California, and I live in the Boston area. I'll have to look around and try to find it here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a half inch custard head of medium lifespan. The body is clear and more a traditional amber than a copper. The smell is nice and inclues malt and caramel. The taste has malt, caramel, a touch of salt, and moderate bitter hops. There's a fairly long bitter finish. I'd say this is a pretty nice beer though it's not really what I think of when I picture ""copper ale"". Without the label I wouldn't have thought to put that word on it."
""
"O- Just a very nice all around beer. I am a fan of lagunitas. Would absolutely buy a six pack of this and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now HERE'S a holiday-esque beer I would be more than happy to buy again. This is a true meat and potatoes amber ale - except for the fact that it has a very strong-yet-hidden alcoholic backbone that can whack unsuspecting drinkers crazy hard if they don't watch it. It's surprisingly balanced nonetheless, and should provide an especially merry time with the holidays coming along."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a thoroughly enjoyable amber ale that is balanced and would seem to make a good go-to beer for all sorts of occasions."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a deep copper/amberish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit like burnt malts, different. Taste is kind of mild, some hops, a bit of malts, somewhat underwhelming. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a decent beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty and enjoyable beer that is in an odd category altogether (red ale), yet to me was pretty good and very enjoyable. It’s a copper ale, whatever that is, and definitely worth trying."

"Copper color; creamy head. Simple aroma, with some caramel, brown sugar, fennel; at times perfumy (I guess they are by-products of the fermentation). Good body strength, huge caramel flavor, a bit dry, some toffee. The hopping is both bold and also lightly aromatic. Simple but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this beer over the weekend in Destin. A much better choice than the Corona in a can sitting 1 chair over. I enjoyed the malty profile with a hint of hops. I would definitely enjoy a six pack of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer isn't bad at all.... Just another decent brew out of Lagunitas."
"Overall- Good, it kind of reminds me of an Oktoberfest with a smidge more hop. Would make a great drinking or session beer."
""
""
"O= Overall I did enjoy the beer... just not my favorite Lagunitas effort by far."
"The beer is copper hued with a quarter inch of off white head. The aroma brings a touch of fruit and some sweet malts. Bready with a touch of hop character in the finish. Medium bodied with subtle alcohol. Overall, this was ok."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed, I'm a big fan of Lagunitas but this one wasn't up to their usual standards."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, unknown bottled date. This pours a slightly hazy amber color with an okay head which was short lived. The smells are of hops with some nice caramel. The feel was medium. The taste was pretty good a nice little bit of hops along with some decent caramel malts. Not bad."
""
""
"O/D-Uninspiring Lagunitas brew (which is very rare). Just not much complexity to counteract the lack of hoppiness. Not a huge fan. Need to kill of the other five bottles now..."
""
"Lightly hazy coppery amber color with a flash head and minimal lacing. Smells and tastes like an IPA. Absolutely no different than any other boring sub-standard IPA. Caramel and grapefruit peel / pith, a touch of pine resin, that's all there is to it. Medium body and carbonation levels. I don't understand what marketing niche passing a simple IPA off as a ""rich copper ale"" fulfills. If it were up to me, I would have either had a hell of a lot more malt complexity in there or I would have just given up and marketed it as a strangely-colored IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is medium bodied with nice soft carbonation. This isn't too bad, I don't think I'd get it again though. It's kind of strangely between hoppy and not."
"Overall - This is a nice drinker. I might have to get Lagunitas again and try some more of their styles"
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer that is easy to drink given the nearly 7% abv and works any time of the year. Affordable, and appeals to the masses. Worth a try"
""
""
"A good offering by Lagunitas. Pretty good job balancing the maltiness that can be expected of this beer with a bit of bitterness. Would make a nice pairing with some grilled caramelized meats i think."
""
"An excellent copper body lends itself to a grainy aroma, definitely on the malty side. Hops are pretty mild considering how much of the Lagunitas line relies on big hop character, which is a nice change of pace for them. There is a certain brown sugar note that is nice. It's a good drink, if unremarkable. One I can drink plenty of, but not one I would press all my friends to try."
"Overall, what we found to be the best thing about this beer was the rich aroma and beautiful look. The nose was very complex, and we kept coming back to words like “thick” and “rich” when trying to describe it. The flavoring is a little light, as the fruit and sugars ease up too much around the edges, dropping the robustness and balance. This, however, is a classic West Coast red, and reminds us quite a bit of Red Seal out of North Coast, but a tad sweeter."
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit thin in body with brisk carbonation. Bright whisp of citric fruit, lightly toasted grain, with balancing hop bitterness. Very good drinkability at the near 7% abv but overall the beer is pretty straightforward and simple and doesn't stand out much. The flavors are nice and the beer makes for a good high abv slam it down beer but as my one friend who doesnt drink much craft beer described it: ""tastes very much like a craft beer"""
""
"Overall, this one is drinkable, but it doesn't cut it for me. While not entirely bad, too much about the beer screams ""hollow."" It's been a long time since I've had one. I reckon it'll be a long time before I have another."
""
"Great darker ale. Color is brown with slight reddish hue; good head retention through the duration of the beer. Taste is sweet compared to other similar beers in style - molasses & brown sugar taste resulting from generous malt. Very subtle hopping. Overall: great versatility - workedmona hot summer day yet likely even better into cooler months."

"This is an incredible malt bomb. The malt is huge, heavy and bready. There is a decent, citrusy hop character but there's was no way it could compete with the malt character. This could use a bit of balance for sure."

"overall not a bad beer.. very traditional tasting red ale.. not very complex but refreshing and quite tasty for the style."

"O - For the style, Lagunitas has produced yet another fine beer. The ABV is beautifully hidden. This is among the best in the style, and while subtle, this beer certainly is worth some attention. Its complexity is unique and when you are seeking a light, non-lager for the evening, I cannot see one going wrong with a few of these."
"Pours amber with an etched mirror surface and excellent clarity. Smells richly of malts, toffee, caramel and hints of tea. Herbal hops are subtle and pleasant. Flavor follows through with an herbal, sweet malt profile. Hints of tea and toffee - nice flavor for an amber, one of the better I've had. medium bodied with average carb on the style. Really a great amber ale."
""
""
""
"O: Hard to go wrong with Lagunitas. Though this isn't as good as some of the others I've had, it's still better than most ambers on the market. I only wish I knew what was behind the ""CENSORED"" label."
"O: A complex malty, rich, yet drinkable beer; fairly high alcohol for the style but masked well"
""
"O- Lagunitas can even produce a great session beer proving there's just about nothing these guys can't do."

""

"Not sure on the freshness though, we must be honest."

""
"O: This style can sometimes be a tough sell with me, but I guess Lagunitas pulled it of somewhat... by a nose."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a coppery orange amber, thin white head and light lacing. Light aroma of caramel and sweet malt, somewhat earthy. Taste has caramel malt, dark fruit and non-aromatic hops. Light to medium bodied. Not assertive, but well balanced. Pleasant, but mellow and not remarkable."
""
""
"O - Above average but Lagunitas has so much better to offer. The advertising is rad though."
"O-nothing big just easy drinking withot complexity"
"I only had one sip left by the time I was assessing mouthfeel, which is a clear indicator that I really enjoyed this beer. Right now I'm knocking back a second one, which is just as enjoyable as trying to distinguish the characteristics of the first one. The choice for carbonation seems very smart, it accentuate a spiciness while acting as a balancing agent to smooth out all the flavors. Lagunitas makes damn good beer. A number of them seem to be slight variations on a certain style but Censored shows off some different tricks that I definitely wasn't expecting."
""
""
"At first, this beer kept reminding me of ribs, and bbq sauce. That's probably because of the strong malt presence. But this beer is balanced very nicely. Amber ales aren't my favorite style, but the malt is smooth and there is not too much bitterness on the back end. Above average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Good for the style, abv hidden well, would have this beer again."
""
""
"Mouth feel is smooth and is very nice."
""
"Overall, not the citrus bomb I expected. Very well balanced. Feels almost like an ESB, with slight estery character."
"Caramelly malt flavor lasts through the tasting experience and finishes on a sweet yet light note. Honestly, I enjoyed this on its own merits because it’s an excellent beer all around."
""
"O- Kind of a weird beer. Seems to jump from style to style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Surprisingly drinkable, albeit a little on the sweet side. Reds are a big favorite of mine and this is pretty good. Not enough to be ""one of my favorites"" but definitely better than average."
""
""
"Pours a clear amber/copper color with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is very malty with bread and caramel aromas. Taste is also very malty with caramel and some herbal hops on the finish. A medium bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is very malty but still has a nice hop presence to balance things out."
""
""
"Overall this is a nice balanced beer with a lot of good things going on. This one can easily become a regular with me."

"Take a stand against censorship: drink it away! Politics aside, though, this stuff pours a clear rusty copper topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises light mandarin orange flesh, toffee, very light cocoa, and a bit of ruby red grapefruit. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange, caramel, light cocoa, ruby red grapefruit peel, and a touch of grass. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a solid amber, nothing amazing, but something easy and pleasant to drink."

"O: A very drinkable beer with a pleasantness about it. You barely n notice the 6.9%."
"Overall this beer turned out to be a pretty damn good Amber Ale. With most Lagunitas beers, I find that they have a pretty dominating hop profile, but with this beer they turned down the hops and let the malts take the lead, and I think that worked pretty well and made for a more balanced Amber Ale and it let the great malt base of this beer shine through and not be overpowered. This beer had pretty good drinkability. the bottle went down faster then I thought it would and if I had another bottle I would drink it. What I like most about this beer was the flavor and the balance, it had a good malt base, and for a change Lagunitas didn't throw a shit load of hops into the brew so it lets those great malt flavors shine through with just enough hops to keep things balanced, the mouthfeel was right were it should be and was also pretty good. There wasn't anything that that I really didn't like about this beer, but a maybe a slight bit more of hop flavor would make this beer perfect. I would buy this beer again, it is a good example of a balanced Amber Ale and I also recommend it to Amber Ales fans, it's a must try for the style. I really liked how Lagunitas restrained themselves on the hops, they already have a hoppy Red Ale, so it's nice that they added a balanced Amber Ale to their lineup. This beer doesn't beat out Bell's Amber Ale as my favorite Amber Ale, but it comes pretty close. Lagunitas continually makes great beers and this one is no different, I'm down to try any beer from them that I can get my hands on."
"O- An outstanding hybrid-styled beer from Lagunitas. I'd seek this one out. Case-worthy."
"Overall - Solid Amber Ale that manages to leave me satisfied on all fronts. This being my first beer from Lagunitas, I'll be more than happy to try out more of their products in the future"
"Poured into 13 oz tulip. Pours a dark amber, with a half inch of sticky head, nice amount of lacing. Smell is biscuit, some clove, brown sugar, carmel, and a hint of grapefruit. Taste up-front clove and in the finish mainly carmel, just a hint of grapefruit. Nice body and carbonation. Very easy drinking for it's abv. Hard beer to describe, nice and very unique. Lagunitas always good and different. Bottled on the 286 day of the year, thanks for the marking."
"Per a company rep at the Galveston Brewmasters beer festival, the original censored name was Kronik. Apparently the Cali ABC frowned on what they saw as glorification of illicit substances."
"Overall / Drinkability: I think this beer would be richer if the carbonation wasn't so high - I could pick out more of the malt, and it's definitely a malt rich beer but with some hops thrown in for good measure to temper the malt. Good, but in the end, not as good as some other Lagunitas brews I've had. Not sure if I would have it again or not."
"D - Solid beer. I can see myself getting this frequently this winter. I would also recommend it to others."
"o- look, it's no nugget nectar... it's a decent amber from the king of american strong ales"
"Overall - I would drink this beer anytime. While I prefer IPA's this is still a great full-flavored beer. Lagunitas took an amber ale and ramped up the flavor and the ABV a bit and threw in some hops for a nice finish - well done, and should be tried."
"Goes well with food. Highly recommended. Great example of the style."
"O: The beer is easy to drink and goes down rather smoothly."
"Easy to drink and leaves behind some decent lace. Worth a try."
"Note: Label on bottle reads 6.75% ABV."
"Overall: this is a pretty decent beer. Lagunitas never fails to deliver beer that I enjoy."
"12 oz bottle. Pours copper with a white, short lived head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of caramel malt, ripe fruit and hints of chocolate and alcohol. The body is medium and smooth. Caramel, peppery hops and ripe fruit nicely balanced on the palate. Medium, dry finish. Tasty brew."
"O: Very enjoyable copper ale. Probably the best I've tried to date."
" ~ This is a very good red. All the characteristics here are exactly what I would expect out of a quality amber beer. It reminds me of another highly recommended beer of this style, Point Amber. I would definitely recommend this beer to a friend and will certainly be seeking out this beverage again in the future."
"Overall, this is excellent fare, and is one of the more well balanced copper ales I've had. Fruits, nuts, toasted grains, and hops are all placed in excellent proportions, resulting in a brew that is extremely flavorful, but at the same time, extremely drinkable. Well worth trying."
"O - Overall ... Good representation of a copper ale, but I think it might need more of something... But I am a hop head so???"
"Overall- Im never disapointed in a Lagunitas brew. This is another great beer in what I feel to be a under rated style. I will be buying more of this and other offerings from the Lagunitas gang."
"I enjoyed this more than most of their big beers."
"O - Very drinkable, yet another solid offering from Lagunitis"
"Overall: After the joy that was Little Sumpin' Sumpin', this is disappointing. Not terrible, just a middle of the road amber ale with some fairly nice sweetness to it. I hope to try it either fresh or on tap to change my opinion."
"I had no expectations for this beer. The name and description didn't provide much for me. It pours to a nice amber color and half inch head. I definitely pick up heavy malt scents including caramel and fig. It has a very smooth malty taste. It has just a bitter aftertaste. For a hophead it’s a very good beer but different than my normal style. Another example of why Lagunitas is one of the best, yet underappreciated breweries in America."
"overall I like reds and will seek out again."
"A decent beer, but not something I'll seek out again."
"O: A good solid beer, but really not that captivating. Too much sugar noted."
"Overall - Soild and easy to drink with fairly low alcohol. Its nothing groundbreaking, or world class, just soild and done pretty well. Worth trying for sure."
"A solid installment from Lagunitas. A Tasty beer that looked great in the glass. Not a big tasting beer by any means, but one that was seemed to know what it wanted to be. My only complaint is the body could have been fuller, but it was satisfying nonetheless."
"This criticism did not deter me from enjoying this beer and I am sure down the road I will revisit it. But Lagunitas Brewing Company does offer better beers and I would recommend trying one of those first."
"Not bad stuff here, Very drinkable, and pretty darn tasty. A little hoppier than many other ambers, but still overall a malty brew."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. I am a malt-head, so this balance suits me pretty well. I would like it to be a bit more fizzy so that it was a bit lighter in the finish, but I imagine that this beer on tap would take care of that, and I will give it a shot the next time I see it available. I would go back to this one, so give it a shot if it is convenient."
"O: Excellent amber ale. Very enjoyable and considering how easily available it is, this is a beer I pick up quite often."
"Pint glass pour and a nice amber colored ale with an off-white bubbly head with staying power is produced. An unexpected fruity aroma is present with grapes being showcased and some plum as well. Was expecting a malty aroma but was pleasantly surprised. A bit on the bitter side with the taste. There’s the malt. A big malt presence on the swallow and there is a slight distracting medicine-like taste. Nice hearty mouthfeel. Overall this was an easy drink and multiples can be consumed with ease…just not by this drinker. I love Lagunitas though I would be reaching for another of their beers before attempting this again."
"Pours out of the bottle a deep almost crimson red color. Barely any aroma of hops only of the caramel and roasted malt. Unlike many other red ales, this beer has little to no bittlerness and is one of the smoothes red ales I have had. Little to almost no lacing. This is a very suttle and gentle palet tasting."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a cloudy, mid-amber-copper coloring that is moderately hazed. It pours with a thin, flat, smooth off-white head that settles rather quickly into sparse film. Aromas are mostly sweet, with characteristics of caramel and toffee blending together. The flavors are overly sweet, with a heavy caramel backbone that rides through into the aftertaste. Other flavors are a slight nut sweetness, some citrusy highlights, and a toasted note, as well. Great body, which is light and crisp, yet leaving a great lacing on the glass while you drink. As said before, the aftertaste is mostly caramel malt sweetness, and the finish is quick and clean, with a slight slickness to it at the end of the palate. Decent beer. Avoids the cloying and overpowering qualities despite the abundance of sweet flavors."
"This is a nice drink. Interesting malt primary with nicely done hops."
"Drinkability/overall- very good balance makes this very easy to slam down, would make great session choice as its very balanced, its not as complex as some beers by lagunitas but balance reigns supreme and I would definitely buy this again"
"O - Overall, this is a solid brew. I very much enjoyed it and will purchase this again."
"Overall, particularly in the category of amber ale, this one is delicious and highly drinkable. There aren't many amber ales that I'd buy a sixer of after I've reviewed them, but this is certainly one of them. Ace job on this one Lagunitas."
"O: this beer grew on me after a few sips.. great change of pace from the usual lagunitas hop bombs.."
"Love it."
"Overall a good quality beer. I enjoyed it quite a bit and wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
"O- Well done malty medium bodied ale. Might be the best overall amber I have had."
"This is a fantastic amber. Not my favorite style, but this beer is a stand out."
"Hell of a beer, very good. Extremely refreshing experience, and I really enjoyed everything"
"Lagunitas is, as the kids might say, the bomb diggity. They make a whole bunch of beers, each every bit as characterful and simultaneously palatable as the other, that give a beer geek - no matter how picky or pliable - nothing to complain about. This particular offering of theirs is far from my favourite but, as I mentioned, is nonetheless an easily enjoyable tipple."
"This a fine red amber ale,with a nice lil head on it that fades away.SMELL is sweetly caramel and refreshing,yes absolutely blissful.TASTE has a small hint some hops but what makes this a fine beer is that sweet caramel and lightly fruity taste. Mouthfeel has a slight aftertaste too it.OVERALL I really enjoyed this beer.I would definitely buy a six or twelve of this."
"Overall: Unique amber ale with great balance due to the pretty complex malts and that signature Lagunitas hop taste. Top tier amber ale overall."
"Overall what a great beer for a spring release. Not sure if people are finding older bottles since some reported no head, and I had a Maximus that had no head. Must have been over a year old that one. A solid brew fresh!"
"(12oz bottle). Pours clear copper with off-white head. Some lacing and moderate carbonation. Aroma has some caramel, alcohol, maraschino cherry (?) and biscuit. Taste is bitter hops and a sweet, sticky maltiness. Medium bodied with sticky/slick texture. Bitter finish. This is not my favorite flavor profile, but it does have loads of flavor. Malt-heads should enjoy this quite a bit."
"Overall an ok beer. Probably wouldn't buy it again."
"TG"
"This is a beer that amateurs will enjoy, but for seasoned beer drinkers it will be a disappointment."
"Overall - Granted, I didn't know what to expect, but that's usually when I'm most excited by a new beer; this one did not deliver!"
"O: Very easy to drink. A nice flavor, but I personally didn't think it was anything amazing. Nice one by Lagunitas, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick more up. Would drink it again though. Nice take on the style."
"Not a bad brew, just a relatively uninspiring one. Drinkable enough in its way, but lacking a lot of interest. I could drink it, but can I be bothered?"
"This is an extremely drinkable amber. It is tempting to do what the ale's label states, ""Life is uncertain. Don't Sip."" It is ashame this is not available locally."
"O - I love this beer, I bought it with low expectations (not sure why, maybe I thought the ""censored"" label was a cheesy look, trying to be controversial) but this beer is fantastic and I think it could become a regular staple of mine as it is a very drinkable beer as well."
"O: Average. Would drink this if given but likely not seek it out."
"Pretty good Amber Ale. I love the malt character, but the aftertaste is way too dry."
"Overall, this one did not quite do it for me. Certainly not a bad beer, but probably not one I'll go out of my way to purchase."
"I want to try this stuff aged in something. It would give it a little more character. I will be looking for censored oak aged (insert flavor) next time."
"O: Not bad. Not my favorite beer Lagunitas produces, though."
"This beer pours normal, looks normal like a red beer. Smells very malty, rich and sweet. Tastes very malty and sweet with some less than medium bitterness and hoppiness. If you like malt flavors, then this is for you. Very rich would be good after dinner with some cheese. This beer is a bit too sweet for me, but it's a good change of gears."
"Medium body and carbonation. Its easy to drink for the most part and doesn't feel like an almost 7% ABV beer. I'd even say it's sessionable, but will sneak up on you."
"O: A malty ale. It lacks a strong smell. All I seem to taste is malt; I wish this was balanced with more hops."
"Pours a translucent amber color with a one finger white head. Great lacing is left in my pint glass as I drink this. The smell has some malt and floral hops maybe a slight spicyness. The taste felt pretty mediocre to me. It starts with Pretty masochism malt, them finishes with an odd sweetness. I didn't really catch any hops in there. Mouthfeel is fine, thickness and carbonation are just right, but overall I am underwhelmed by this beer."
"So my car died today!!! Piece of SH%T! In the middle of no-where Illinois!!! Thank the Lord for GPS....and Cell phones...it was the only way the tow truck could find me!!!! Anyway...the situation was made good by several individuals....and of course this beer! The color is defiinitely Red/Copper! Im not a fan of floaties....so watch out pouring the entire beer into yo glass! There is a thin head which looks like it will lead to a delightful lace. Something sweet in teh smell....perhaps some molasses, taste comes across a lil sweet as well. This is a very good RedAle/Amber Ale. Very well balanced and not too much booz! Session you betcha!!! I am raising my glass in salute to those that made this day tolerable!!!"
"Pours a nice fat two finger head, some small bubbles and some big ones, looks partly soapy and partly creamy. The body is almost completely see through, I know it' not the darkest ale, but in my opinion a amber ale should not be this see through. The color is about what an amber should be - amber, but it does have hints of that copper color too it. Overall I would be pretty pleased with this appearance if it wasn't so see through, it just makes it seem like there wont be much too it. This smells like pure grain to me, I mean there is a difference between a grain smell and a malty smell, this smells just like grain that you haven't even brewed yet. It's obviously a lighter grain, but it is for sure grain. Yeah, I mean it just smells like grain, and also it smells super super sweet. Those smells dominate, there isn't any room for anything else here. Some people might like that totally grain smell, but I don't, it smells gross to me, that's not what 99% of beers smell and taste like, so I don't think it should be considered good. This is especially offensive in this beer because it's an amber ale....ok, amber ales are supposed to be hoppy with a little bit of malts, this beer does not smell hoppy at all, and instead of malts you get pure grain, something is wrong here. We will see how it tastes, but I don't have high hopes. GROSS! GROSS beer, wow, what the heck!?!?! First of all, there are almost no hops here, what is up with that!?!?! It's an amber ale!!! Secondly, you get that huge grain flavor that I'm not a fan of, it's not as intense as I picked up on the smell, but still, way too noticeable. I mean other than that it just tastes completely boring. Boring boring boring, and an unwanted grain taste. It's only redeeming factor is the mouthfeel which is good, and it's appearance. The drinkability it ok, but that's only because it's so boring that it resembles water. Whatever, I'm over this beer, not impressed AT ALL. Overall, below average in my opinion."
"O: A solid amber. No big flavors here, but I wouldn't turn one down."
"Good balanced, not so intensily hopped as many other Lagunitas."
"DB- Pretty straightforward but not bad because of that. The malt confuses me because it tastes a bit old or something. Either way, a nice straight up ale."
"O: Its pretty good, solid, but nothing spectacular. Not sure how fresh it is and unsure if that is playing a part, especially in the lack of hop profile."
"Why: Because your buddy wishes he had brought this good of beer, because you'll be infusing a bit of class into the party and because, well.. just because"
"Drink- Good beer. Easy to drink and well flavored. Would visit again."
"Overall a brew with a nice smooth hoppy aftertaste. One to put on the my favorites list."
"Drinkability: This is a beer with a lot of great character. If you like beers of a malty or roasted quality this is for you. If you like a beer with malt character but that still has a hop backbone it's also for you. Lagunitas makes some really good beer."
"Poured a light cooper with a very small head that did not stick around. Little to no lacing left on the glass. A bread-yeast aroma as well as caramel, toffee and slight fruit. I really picked up on the caramel for the taste. It was chewy and thick. The malts left the mouth dry. This was an OK beer, just not what I would typically enjoy."
"D- The awesome mouthfeel makes this very easy to drink! The relatively low ABV makes it easy to return to!"
"A great beer, for some reason has been one I have ignored for years just because I got for other lagunitas brews, but will definately buy again."
"Very nice for the style. Love that they didnt short us on the hops."
"This is a unexpectedly complex beer which surprised me at every stage. Pleasant enough and worth having once, but not something I really want to have a second time."
"OVERALL GRADE: C-"
"D- Pretty good beer, a good example mix of flavors with hitting both the red and amber aspects of style."
"Carbonation is a bit high initially, but smooths out nicely. Body is rich just as it says on the label, and the color + taste + body remind me of a delectable syrup. Bonus points for being ""The Kronik"" beneath the censoring!"
"D: Good beer definitely worth a try."
"I'd do this again"
"This amber has a little more vigor to it than many, just not enough to make it memorable."
"D: would drink a couple more."
"Drinkability - It was a decent beer. The look was great, but went downhill from there. The bitterness and sweetness made this a little hard for me on the drinkability. I would not order again."
"Drinkability: Balance very much leans towards malts. Hop character is very much subdued, so low hop bitterness. A little bit more sweet than other ambers/reds. Finish is roasty. Overall, if you like sweet and low bitter beers, this is a 'sweet' selection!"
"D - It is a very good beer, I could only drink too because it was very filling and a little too sweet at times."
"D/M: drinks smooth and easy, slight carbonation tingle, sits light, good session brew"
"MF: Lightly carbonated and light to medium bodied, this beer exemplifies Lagunitas' ""Life is uncertain. Don't sip!"""
"D - The drinkability is good. This is a pretty solid beer, and goes down easy. I like this beer, and recommend trying it if you come across it. I have yet to come across a beer by Lagunitas that I haven;t enjoyed. Can't wait for the next beer of theirs I try."
"Overall/notes - The first ""average"" beer I've really had from Lagunitas. It's an interesting one for sure. It has an odd sort of balance to it, but the balance isn't subtle. Instead, everything kind of fights for your attention resulting a bit of an ""all over the place"" sensation. It's decent, but I'd turn to other ambers first."
"D-The weird tartness was unexpected and very distracting. This really hurt the drinkability for me."
"Poured aggressively for a 1-finger head that dissipates to nothing, no lacing, color is clear copper. Excellent aroma! Toasted malts, cinnamon sugar, and slight maple syrup....like breakfast. Taste is very smooth, with lightly toasted malts and caramel. Leaves a toasted flavor on the palate, extremely smooth and drinkable. Excellent brew. The only disappointment was appearance."
"Feels surprisingly strong for an ABV of less than 6%. Not exactly to my tastes, though - in some senses this tastes a bit closer to a winter warmer (not what I'd expect from a ""rich copper ale"")."
"O - A pretty fantastic beer. It drinks like a lighter bodied Belgian double, with a lot of the same dried dark fruit and brown sugar sweetness."
"12oz bottle. Pours a very murky amber color with virtually no head. Minimal lacing. Aromas of brown sugar, some hops, and a slight aroma of booze. Taste is of brown sugar and grains up front. Slight orange peel aftertaste to it with some bitterness. This is an alright beer from a really good brewery. Overall the taste and aromas of this beer are somewhat subdued. There are a bunch more beers by Lagunitas to grab before picking this one up again."
"D - Pretty tasty offering from Lagunitas, but this one isn't as memorable as some of the others that I've had. Very drinkable and offers some unique flavours. Worth a try."
"Overall one of the few disappointments from Lagunitas."
"Pours a light amber red with a thin off-white bubbly head that dissipates rather quickly. Small patches of lacing can be seen. Smell is biscuity and grainy up front with notes of molasses and maple syrup in the middle that is balanced out by mild citric hops. Taste is hoppy with a hint of grainy malts that give a pleasing earth tone. In the middle you can taste a hint of dark fruits that balance out the bitterness from that hops, while leaving a biscuity dry finish. Mouthfeel is syrup like to me with little carbonation. There is plenty of volume but I would have liked a little more carbonation to lighten in up a bit. Still a very drinkable beer. I can see myself going back to this one and checking it out again. Well worth a try and the 1.99 a bottle."
"Poured a deep red mahogany color with a thick tannish white head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of caramel malts, and some bitter hops. Tastes much the same of sweet malts, caramel, some citrus and maybe pine. Mouthfeel is medium with a good carbonation. Drinkability is good."
"Overall, not what I look for in this type of beer. Flavor had too much sweet fruitiness detracting from the bready characters. On the positive side, mouthfeel was clean and crisp."
"Pours nicely into beer mug. Has a red amber colored body with a thin whitish tan head that has decent retention and good lacing. It has very good carbonation and has a nice sweet smell of caramel and toffee, and the taste is of caramel, toffee, coffee and some sugary malts with a slight hint of citrus and floral hops. It is a nice smooth taste with not much of an aftertaste to it. It has a creamy, sweet, sticky feel to it and is a smooth easy drinking beer. This is a very good beer and I would recommend anyone that likes this style of beer to give this a try"
"Beer is light to medium in body with a bright hoppiness to it, tropic and mild bitterness. Nothing new to report...I guess the CENSORED makes them seem not mainstream but this is a totally obtainable beer...boring...i'm bored."
"Had a 12-ounce glass at Crescent & Vine poured from a bar-top firkin for $6. The aroma was a bit yeasty at first but it mellowed to light caramel notes. This beer reminded me more of drinking my homebrew from the fermentor. The carbonation was very light and the flavor was a mix of citrus hops and toffee and more caramels malts. All in all, it was a tasty ale worth sessioning."
"Tastes like an amber ale hopped up on hops. not too special but nice."
"D: It's decent, low enough ABV, but just doesn't do much for me."
"Poured into Duvel Tulip. Bright Copper with a light layer of foamy malt goodness. Sweet grassy aroma, floral notes and hops. Actually tastes better than it smells, Starts off with creamy roasted malt, a touch of citrus, then has some nice piney hops on the finish. Nice lacing all the way down the glass. It's closer to a Brown Ale then an Amber, A real easy drinker...5.9% ? Hmmm, could have fooled me."
"D_Very drinkable. One of my favorites of the style."
"D - This is a very nice amber ale. All the hype and the name had me thinking it would be a super-hoppy ale, but it is really quite balanced."
"This is just another great Lagunitas. Great example of the style. Excellent session beer."
"Overall: Very good amber ale. I would highly recommend this. Another solid offering from Lagunitas."
"Pours a clear, darker hue of copper with a small, off-white head that lasts for a couple of minutes. Aromas a predominantly toffee, with hints of dark fruits, perhaps raisins. The flavors and feel are nothing short of terrific. Very complex, medium-full bodied, almost chewy feel. A lot of sweeter notes, like toffee and caramel, that don't descend into the cloying range due a dull background haze of hops that are hard to describe. Maybe they're earthy, maybe they're more tea-like...it's hard to say because they only whisper through the powerful maltiness. Far chewier and maltier than the other amber ales out there, but regardless of style category, this is one hell of a beer."
"D- Easy to drink. I feel that this a decent craft beer that a non-craft drinker can enjoy."
"D - there is something about this beer that is enticing from many angles, it didn't really wow me until i was almost finished the bottle and I was dying for another (almost like ""The Kronic"" does to me). Lagunitas does not dissapoint!"
"Taken on a rainy afternoon. Served in a duve tulip glass. Look: Copper cloudy color, thin foamy head with great lacing. Smell: Toffee and prune malt with character of earth hops. Taste: Eart hops with toffee malt and pumpkin notes. Mouthfeel: Warm and dry, slightly woody with high bitterness and robust body. Drinkability: Feels that it's more alcohol than 5.9 but overall i liked."
"A pretty drinkable brew! That odd-looking (and unexpected) sediment threw me off, but this is a good beer."
"It is a good easy drinking quality simple beer. Nothing outstanding but a good beer. I would buy it again if I was in the mood for something with not too much complexity."
"D - Pretty darn drinkable, I could easily put down a few especially with food. I was disappointed with the malt profile in the flavor though, it was subdued and overall it just reminded me of an Alt style beer. Not bad if there's nothing else being served at a restaurant or bar, but at home, eh I'd say pass."
"Decent beer, i question the style though, Lagunitas could have probably got away with calling this an Alt or ESB. I like it but for the style and price, there are better choices."
"D-Another mediocre offering from Lagunitas. I never buy more than a single since they don't use bottle dating."
"This one is a nice drinking beer, and by that, I mean that it's easy to just drink and drink and drink. My score may show that it's lacking, and it is somewhat IMO, but at the same time, this would be a fantastic intro beer into the world of craft. Easy to drink, not overly powerful or hoppy. Not shabby at all."
"Mouthfeel is very good, if you didn't catch on, I think it's well balanced. Full bodied and full of flavor. Good carbonation feel as well. Drinkablility is very good, goes pretty quick. Another solid beer by Lagunitas."
"A great flavorful beer that goes down with ease."
"Had this one on cask tonight at Busy Bee. Served in a standard pint glass a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is crisp citrus hops and some sweet malts. The taste is a nice balance of citrus hops and sweet caramel malts. The beer is quite light, crisp and oh so smooth. This is a very enjoyable cask beer, one I would love to have on cask again."
"Ahhhh, last of the beers from my old job (I kept a fridge full in my office for the other employees to enjoy after work...About 10 were in there as of my last day)....Pours a, you guessed it, copper amber-ish color. Lots of carbonation and a rich, creamy head. Tiny amounts of lacing. Aroma is very faint and shows some pineapple, vanilla and hint of piney hoppiness. Flavor is very rich - they were dead on that - showing excellent balance between the hop bitterness and maltiness. Very full mouthfeel and very flavorful, though not super complex: hops and malt and yeast. Good beer, but not elite. Alwasy well-priced, too, so worth keeping a sixer around all times in your beer fridge."
"Pours a real nice amber copper color (duh). Loose carbonation with good retention. Aroma is malt forward, smells really toasty. No hop aroma at all. Taste is also really malt forward. Toasty and roasty without being heavy, cereal flavors backed up by slighty hoppy bitter finish. Could have some more hops in there, even for the style. Beer has a nice round full mouthfeel without being cloying or heavy. Not my favorite style but its pretty drinkable."
"Lagunitas Censored is the exact opposite end of the spectrum its other red ale, Lucky 13. In this beer, the caramel malts are the focus with the hops taking a back seat. The deep copper color was topped with a off-white that clings and sticks around til the end. The aroma was dominated by the sweet, rich caramel with a little of oxidized sherry and fig. The taste was similar with a lot of chewy toasted malt and a hint of citrusy hops. The beer was full bodied with thick complex malts. The sweetness for me makes this a beer that is difficult to drink more than bottle of. I think that a blend of Lucky 13 and Censored would be a really good amber ale that complements each other and better than the sum of the parts."
"D: Solid amber, not overhopped which I like in this style. Something to try for sure, nice red ale."
"If only our Irish boxer had a little more meat on his bones, he might pack more of a punch, still, he does well in his division. Nobody's complainin' here."
"Very drinkable, a great amber ale to be sure and another excellent offering from Lagunitas."
"Bready, toasty, and caramel malt notes top out the flavors. There is also a candy sweetness, and a huge hop finish, Hops are slightly citrusy, but more floral and earthy. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a very smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, solid beer overall."
"I could see myself tipping back more than a couple of these in a night. Yet another solid brew from Lagunitas. They just brew good beers and I love their hop profiles."
"D: rather easy to gulp, so i can agree with the label of ""life is short, dont sip"""
"Pours a reddish-copper colour with thin white head. Good head retention and some lacing. Smell has tons of sweet caramel with some grapefruit hops. Taste is very sweet up front with the hop bitterness more as an aftertaste. Quite a nice beer, but nothing too complex about it. It is sweet and a bit hoppy. If you want a sweet & hoppy beer, then I'd recommend this one."
"Overall, very good. Missing something? Probably, but not alot to bitch about here. Plenty of good things going on, and worth drinking by far."
"Taste, a very hoppy beer. Ample malt backbone on this one, one of the more balanced Lagunitas offerings (but some of the unbalanced ones are phenomenal). Tasted the alcohol a little more than I would have expected. Not as heavy on the hops as the Lucky 13 red. I guess that's kind of their imperial hoppy red, and this is just a hoppy red. Enjoyable. For some reason, this stuff is just as expensive as the more limited release stuff."
"D: Delicious fulfilling beer, a good first exposure to amber ale."
"D - Very drinkable. A nice break from my usual hop forward preferences allowing my mouth to recover. Good to relax with."
"D: Nothing to special here, not bad, but it doesn't do it for me."
"Bottle. Beautiful copper color. Small head that dissipated withing three minutes. Aroma roasty with some raisin and alcohol notes. Pleasant. Lightly sweet flavor fading into roasted coffee and then to a slightly bitter aftertaste. A very pleasant progression. Tasted better as it warmed a bit. Looked forward to each sip."
"I haven't had one of these in a couple years, so I was happy to revisit it. But I was bit disappointed. I remember this beer being a lot bolder and fuller. As it is, this is just an average version of the style, perhaps a touch hoppier than some. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's not special like I remember. Worth having if you're in the mood for the style, but not worth seeking out."
"Pours a dark orange with two finger cream colored head, leaves a nice ring of lace for a couple of inches. Smell: a bit resinous, leafy, slightly tannic, light caramel sweetness. Taste: quick sweetness, vinous, pretty fruity - almost like a strawberry finish, with a leafy and slightly citric hop character. A bit light and crisp, but nice carbonation. Not as sweet as many in the style, but would make a refreshing sessioner."
"Drinkability: Great, interesting beer, that I could drink all evening."
"This beer is very drinkable, I might smash this whole 6 pack faster than i really wanted too."
"Drinkability is there. Nice bodied and smooth, this beer is a pleasure to drink and don't realize how easy it disappears. I enjoy The KroniK."
"Drinkability: good all around red ale. Nice balance and good flavors. Where this style rarely stands out for me, this one stands out within the style. I really wish I knew how fresh this bottle was."
"Overall an ale that feels and drinks more like a 7.5% ABV beer. It's a bit hearty for a 5.9% IMHO. On a cool night around a campfire is where this beer would fit right in. I can't find anything really wrong, but I really can't say I'd buy it again in the store or on tap. Decent."
"D: Great all around drinkability, with a nice and a balanced beer that calls back for more drinking to find new flavors."
"It's density alone is fine, but it's the wortiness of it that makes me lessen its drinkablity, at least as far as multiple beers go. If you're just have a nice beer at the end of the night, I think this one would do just fine."
"An interesting switch from the big bold IPAs I have had as of late, the Censored is big and bold in its own way. Not your standard subdued Amber/Red, this one has a bit more taste and feel to it. Very nice overall."
"I normally have only seen it at Whole Foods but was very please to now see it at my safeway in San Francisco"
"Nicely complemented by some Achadinha Capricious aged goat cheese. Makes for a great Petaluma 1-2 punch."
"D: Goes down alright, but it's just average. Could drink it with a meal."
"This is a very nice example of an amber with more hops then an ordinary amber ale, not too sweet and simple to enjoy. Recommended!"
"D- A decent beer that drinks nicely once accustomed to."
"d - An ok red ale. The smell was pretty good but the taste was a little too sweet for me. Wouldn't look to have again."
"Drinkability? The flavours are good but I don't feel like having another after this one. For me, for occasional use only."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The taste, however, is quite different. It is mostly lemon, peach, with a spicy-peppery leafiness, some grapefruit, and other hints hard to pin down. It is well balanced in sweetness-bitterness, both noticeable, but tends very slightly to the sweet side. There is quite a bit of character and range of elements married nicely and it is well rounded, yet it is very light. It is zesty and engaging and in the end exceedingly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is slick, low to medium carbonation, easy drinkin'."
"A fairly drinkable beer, and certainly a recommendation for Bock lovers. Rich and malty, but with enough significant bitterness to please more diehard hopheads. Quite good."
"Good body, coats the mouth and lingers. Nice, very drinkable cooler weather beer - like a Brown Shugga Lite!"
"Favorite amber to date."
"This beer went down very easy and would probably remain that way all night."
"D: A solid, drinkable beer."
"Copper orange color with a light caramel nose, not enough hops in the nose, which carries through to the underwhelming taste. Too sweet, not really hoppy enough, some citric hops with very sweet caramel malt, some nice dry earthy aftertaste and a nice creamy mouthfeel, but still, I didn't find the taste to be a stand-out."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable. not as balanced as i was hoping for after reading other reviews. I probably won't buy it again but if i did i could have quite a few in one sitting."
"Overall Drinkability - 4.0 - A great session beer with wonderful balance. Not very visually appealing due to the strange protein particles, but perhaps there was something wrong with the bottle I had."
"I am not a big fan of American red/amber ales, and this one didn't make me much more positive."
"D - Pleasant. I could easily drink a few of these. At the same time, it's not particularly special."
"D - Very drinkable, with a distinct emphasis on the malt. There is significant hop bitterness and flavor, certainly enough to balance and keep the sugar in check, but it is still a malt oriented beer. The caramel flavor is dominant and lingers on the palate after the other flavors have dissipated."
"D: Though a bit different from other brews of this style, it is very good, and easy to drink. Not my favorite release from Lagunitas, but still very enjoyable."
"D: Overall this is a very nice beer, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to someone interested in ambers. Not enough fruity notes. This, as mentioned above, reminds me more of a dry ESB than an amber, but fans of Laguintas will probably get a lot from this beer."
"This beer really surprised me. I really didn't know anything about this other than past experience with the brewery (Hop Stoopid etc). This was a malt driven beer (!), kind of reminded me of Fuller's ESB. I really liked it. Copper color, adequate but unremarkable head. First clue this wasn't a typical west coaster was no fruity-piney smell. Tasted very malty and balanced. Really got going as it warmed up, the malt shined. Very impressed they brew this style, I will check out some of their other beers."
"D: Very drinkable amber ale, and very enjoyable at that. Lagunitas continues to impress... if only they were more available in the East Coast."
"D'ability - Surprisingly bitter for a biggish 35 IBU beer.  Would like more malt in malt/hop balance."
"D - Super drinkable, and a really nice solid brew. This is a subtle one on many levels, and I'd gladly go for a few."
"Good drinkability - nice brew. Hoppier than a run of the mill Amber Ale."
"D - Very robust and malty with a good feel, without knowing it's style, I'd guess it was a dopplebock with a lower alcohol percent. No hops leads to a sweetness like caramel. A good beer all around."
"D: Pretty solid red ale. Would try this again."
"Another Launitas' beer that I can add to my list of favorites. Remember when you were a kid and ""accidentally"" swallowed a penny? We all know that taste. I never imagined i would ever taste it again, especially in a beer. I didn't know I liked pennies so much, the copper tones in this beer work great."
"D - Unfortunately, I tried this beer standalone. I don't think you can really enjoy it without something that will counterpunch the hops and make the voluminous feel a plus and not a defect. I imagine it would pair well with pizza, fried zucchini, fruta de mare, white fish, possibly salmon."
"D- This is not a knock your socks off kind of beer, but like a winterish session beer. I feel this way about a lot of lagunitas beers. Solid, but not crazy. I'm very OK with that. Keep up the good work."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - tasty, good mid range beer, good for mixed company"
"D - Easy to get down and smooth. Highly drinkable."
"Not a bad brew, a slightly different hop experience than usual, but that's just groovy enough to have me envision grabbing a sixer of these, if only they weren't so dear around these parts."
"Great look to the beer with an orange copper body topped with a light tan creamy cap. Lots of sweet malt and citrusy hop character in the aroma. The taste is toasty sweetened caramel malt, a hit of ripe orange preserves, and a subtle bitterness form the hops. Not too complex and it doesn't need to be. It is fantastic the way it is, great mouthfeel, just fills every tastebuds with sweet, hoppy goodness, heavy for the style and while very crisp, it isn't dry or over carbonated. You know when you drink an ice cold Coca Cola in the burning hot sun after mowing your yard, that feeling you get like: WOW! That was wonderful! Same feeling you get when you put this back. i continue to be impressed with Lagunitas."
"D - All in all nothing terribly special. But a nice sessionable beer."
"Copper color with some small floaties swimming around. Pretty faint smell. I'm used to being smacked with hops when I pour Lagunitas brews, so this was a change. Slight caramel malts followed by really subdued hops hinting of oranges. Does have a nice creamy feel. I'm torn here. This is a pretty good example, but I'm just not a fan of this style."
"D: This is a nice easy drinking beer. I'm quite glad I finally picked it up."
"M/D- a crisp refreshing beer with a little more creaminess than I would expect, which is a plus. It's got ultimate drinkability, a solid session beer, even though it's probably not technically a session beer."
"Tastes like light caramel malty very drinkable beer. Very light hop presence, low to medium mouthfeel and a good overall amber ale. Would be able to put a few of these down and I do not think they would be offensive to the uneducated beer drinker who tends to lear towards budweiser."
"Drinkability: Overall this was a very malty beer with little presence of hops. I greatly enjoyed the balance of baked bread and caramel in the taste. Very good representation of an amber ale in my opinion."
"This is a very good ale. Sweet, but flavorful and very nice on the palate as well as refreshing."
"D- Easy beer to drink. Didn't necessarily stand out in any way but I enjoyed it."
"The ale has a copper color, relatively clear from afar. Up close, there is a significant amount sediment. A huge head has left its mark, leaving thick lace all around the glass. The nose is somwhat restrained, showing off a citrusy hop profile with caramel malts. Caramel malts set the stage, creating a sweet flavor that coats the tastebuds and acts as a nice foundation for the hops. As the first wave of maltiness fades, the hops with a citrusy burst of intensity that adds a nice twist to the malts. The hops linger before fading back into the malts at the end of the sip."
"Being that American Amber Ales are one of my favorite styles, I feel biased to say that this beer is highly drinkable."
"Pours a hazy copper color, one finger head, decent retention and lacing (honestly, Lagunitas brews always lace wonderfully). Smell is of sweet carmel, bready malts, a faint touch of spice and even a little apple. Taste follows scent with a quite sweet carmel taste followed by breadier malts. Very muted hop presence for a Lagunitas brew. Traces of apple again noted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, ample carbonation, somewhat crisp. I expected a little more umph out of this brew, but very good and actually a nice easy drinker."
"Poured a rich but somewhat hazy copper/dark amber, with little tan head. Rich malty aroma. I was shocked when I opened this beer, this team is legendary for their hopped up the wazoo beers. Flavor is rich malty sweetness, but the hop bitterness is high enough to keep it from being too sweet. Caramel/toasty malt flavors dominate the flavor profile. Carbonation is actually on the high end of medium. Finishes fairly even for such malty sweetness upfront. Medium mouthfeel. I will end up drinking a BUNCH of this beer..."
"D- Moderate to high. I could slam back a couple of these no problem. I will seek out the Kronic (whoops, I mean the censored) by Lagunitas again."
"It is not bad at all. If you are a fan of Lagunitas this will not disappoint. Something worth trying."
"Had a bottle of this at a local restaurant in Duluth. Pours a copper color with moderate head and no lacing. Smell is relatively subdued - hard to pick much out of it except for some malt presence. Taste is a combination of the style and a hint of plastic. Average mouthfeel. Overall, decent but not my favorite."
"D: Good beer to enjoy with typical American fare; cuts through most strong flavors and holds its own. Decent ale for sessioning with."
"Poured a clear, red/brown with a two modest head that dissipated to a collar. The aroma was malty sweet. The taste was also malty sweet, but I got the faint taste of strawberries at the back of the throat, don't ask me where that came from. The feel was medium bodied, oily, with light carbonation. Drinkability was very good. I bought a sixer and could drink it if I hadn't already sampled a couple other brews."
"D: Very drinkable and smooth."
"D - excellent session brew. great balance across the board and a decent amount of flavor for a beer under 6 percent."
"D - Well balanced, easy to drink beer. Many BMC drinkers prefer a smooth over a pale ale type beer to open them the world to craft brew. Well..for all these Amber Bock drinkers, this may be just what you are looking for"
"D - Censored certainly isn't what I think of when I think of an amber. Nothing about it tastes terrible but it just isn't appealing. The toasty character is a bit strange in such large amounts and I would prefer a bit more sweetness. Hop flavor is restrained and what flavor is there doesn't meld beautifully with the malt. Kind of a strange combination of weakish flavors here."
"A real refreshing high carbonated balanced beer. Very smooth likable beer. Would be nice for a light session beer."
"D: A good beer, but it stops there. More like an ESB than an amber. At its price of 8 bucks for a sixer it is definitely worthy of a purchase."
"i liked this beer but for over 20$canadian for a 6 pack it might not see my gut again for a while"
"Overall, not a bad red. Not very hoppy which I really enjoyed. My pint is going moderately fast, but only 1 for me."
"Poured a red body with a light head that left no lacing. A light caramel malt smell along with minimal hops. Smooth and lighter bodied this beer has a buttery, sweet malt edge that is more about the malt than the hops. Hops are noticeable with some citric notes in the backgroun and give the beer a slight dry edge. I enjoyed this beer but not something I will seek out if I'm looking for a red ale."
"Overall, a good beer, and glad I got a chance to try it."
"I thought Censored was an old or strong ale and i'm surprised to the the alcohol by volume for this beer, which seemed much stronger and maltier than the abv suggests. I liked this beer but would not put it in the same catergory as many of the other beers in this category. As low as the abv is, it's really more of a winter drinker than a typical amber ale."
"Pours a deep copper colour with a pale head that quickly disappears to leave almost no lacing. Plenty of bubbles rising throughout the glass. The lack of head leads to a disappointing nose. There's not much aroma, but what there is ain't bad - sweet, citrusy, very slight hop character. The lack of nose is more than made up with the taste. Not too sweet, a nice dose of hops, very nice bitter finish as it goes down. If you're looking for anything extreme you won't find it here. This is very well balanced and even. Medium to full body, good carbonation. Very drinkable."
"I enjoyed the beer, and it was very easy to drink. I only wish that there would have been a little more early bitterness to cut the sweetness."
"T- Dull, slight bitter taste. Very smooth with a slight caramel to it, but it has something of a skunked taste to it, which could be attributed to the taps."
"D - This beer is big on the caramel flavors...not much balance and little hop presence...if that's what you're looking for...a good session beer and a solid brew from Lagunitas"
"Drinkability is wonderful. Dictionary definition of sessionable brew. Low ABV, smooth and complex enough to keep most beer geeks happy."
"D- I guess I must of had a bad bottle. I was expecting a lot more with this beer but to my suprise I didn't...not really at all. I will do another review on this if I can find a fresher bottle."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours a bright, clear copper color with no head to speak of. Aroma of bready malts and sweet toffee. Medium bodied and fairly smooth with subtle carbonation. Sweet flavor with barely a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. I wouldn't call it balanced, but it is very good if you like sweeter ales."
"12 ounce twist-off bottle. What's the word behind ""CENSORED"" on the label? I'd like to know. It pours out a reddish copper color with a medium eggshell-colored head. Big bubbles and it sticks to the side of the glass well. Smells like sweet malted barley and a little bit of hops. It just smells like real beer. Like beer should. If I were forced to explain further I may say carmel and prunes. Well, no surprise, but it tastes just like this style of beer should. Sweet malt with some hoppy bitterness to offset the sweetness quite nicely. Perfect carbonation and nice texture. Not too heavy. Easy to drink. Very slight bitter aftertaste. Good example of a beer just being brewed the way beer was intended to be brewed. I like it."
"Very standard amber ale. Very nice copper color in the glass with a nice foamy white head. Lots of malt sweetness up front and just a hint of hop character to balance. Feels full bodied in the mouth with a lot of sweetness at the finish. Very easy to drink a few of these."
"Drinkability: an overall well drinkable beer. Smells nice tastes alright not necessarily an intense drinking beer"
"Notes: A great session ale!"
"This would be a good morning starter or afternoon brew but I don't think I could go it all day. I am enjoying it on the deck with a cigar and it is perfect for this mild day."
"12 ounce stubby bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear, light copper color with an okay beige head. Christmas spice aroma with a deep caramel backdrop. Flavor is maple syrupy with a light citric fruitiness and a modest bitterness in the finish. A little muted in all aspects. Mouthfeel is thinnish, carbonation is good, finish is dry."
"The flavor matches the smell profile. Rich body. Good hop finish, but the aftertaste is short lived. No problems, an easy beer to drink, very middle of the road."
"A nice dark amber color pour with a solid,lasting two finger head,some spotty lacing. Aroma is malty,nutty,with floral and spicy notes,very nice. Flavor is crazy, a little bit of everything, sweet caramel malt,ripe fruit,bready yeast,white grapes, a super balance between hoppy,bitter ,and sweet.The medium level of carbonation seems to keep it from being too heavy and helps mix all the flavors, finish is like a sweet rum fruitcake or something crazy like that. I would call this very sessionable, and interesting, Would love to try this on tap."
"Overall, decent but I was expecting more."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. Appears a clear rich amber color with about two fingers of off white foam. The foam leaves minimal lacing on the inside of the glass. Nose and flavor consists of sweet caramel malt, bitter hops, slightly metallic twang. Medium in both body and carbonation. The metallic notes are a little off putting for me but still nothing terrible. Worth a try."
"There are certainly no real complexities to this beer. It's simple but it's clean and well-balanced."
"- Easy to drink, sits heavy though.. filling and bubbly... and I am wondering if I am the only guy that actually found a sixer of the 'censored' rich copper ale?"
"D- I overall like this one. I could drink this more often, but I probably wouldn't."
"D: I've had a few of these and I enjoyed them well enough then, but on closer inspection this beer leaves me wanting more and more. Appearance is boring, smell seems a bit off, flavor isn't bad and mouthfeel is adequate. Nothing really lending itself for me to really like this beer at all. Not bad, not good either."
"D- Lagunitas makes good beer, but not in this one. I kind of find myself getting similar flavor profiles in some offerings, perhaps the house ingredients. This is pretty light on alcohol so could be a nice session beer, maybe i'll give it another go on tap if I see it."
"D: Could session this beer easily. Very drinkable."
"I will call this a session ale. Only downside is a wee bit too carbonated for my ale tastes. Well recommended."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer and very drinkable, but a greater presence from the hops would improve it."
"D - highly drinkable beer."
"Same delicious fruit cocktail (maraschino cherries, grapefruit, pinapple) from the aroma mixed with a spicy, toasted bitter. Overall, way too sweet to for any balance but good nonetheless."
"D= worth the try, goes great with most meals that I've tried including a nice pork roast. Highly recommended if you want a Red Ale with a dry-malty APA twist."
"D- Nice drinkability great intreating taste. Would be great on a nice fall evening."
"D: High. I say session. This one's not outstanding like their Imperial Red, but it's a solid ale that I'd drink from time to time."
"First beer of the night at Church in the Fenway area. Bottles were $5. Poured into a tall pilsener glass. Dark amber color. Fairly large brilliant white head. Good lacing at the beginning. Smelled a bit piney and earthy. Taste was quite good. Malty with a bit of dark fruit flavors standing out. Definitely had a hearty body to it, but was relatively smooth. Very easy beer to drink. I don't often order red ales, but I am glad that I discovered this one. It sticks in my head as a memorable exception to a style that I don't often enjoy."
"The last 1/4 of the glass was really hard for me to swallow. Almost my first drain pour."
"Cheers Mark!"
"As a side note, the coolest thing about this beer in my opinion is its blending of characteristics of so many different beer styles - the color and feel of an amber ale, the flavors of a porter, pale ale, and hints of wheat ale, and the finish of a very light IPA. I don't know how they've done it, but this is really quite a magical brew, and I look forward to trying more offerings from Lagunitas."
"I liked this, but the malty flavor caught up to me."
"drinkability is absolutely wonderful will be looking for this in bottles"
"D - Good session beer. I liked it and now that I can get it locally I'll be getting more."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of of slight hops, slight alcohol, earthy malt, some caramel sweentess, and lots of grass. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of grass up front, slight hops, some sweet malt, and slight hint of spice. Wow, a decent beer, but nothing to brag about - I would not recommend trying this beer."
"D - this is a perfect session beer. it wont overwhelm your taste buds but wont bore them either."
"I'm sure that this one would be a great session beer. Probably for a lot of people. Just not for me. The bitter hop finish kills what is otherwise a very nice brew."
"Overall impression: Not a balanced or enjoyable amber ale, IMO. Too much sticky sweetness and not enough roasted/toastedness here. Lagunitas seems to be a love it or hate it brewery for me, and this brew is unfortunately not on the 'love it' end of that equation."
"Amber colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is caramel.Taste is the same caramel maltiness and maple flavoring.A very good beer that has good flavor and is good from first to last sip.Highly recommended and I would definetly seek this out again in the future!!"
"M & D - Medium bodied and creamy. Decent amount of carbonation. Finishes dry with little to no aftertaste. This is a brew with a high drinkability factor, and one I'll be buying in the future."
"Pours a clear golden-copper with a short white head that diminishes to a ring. Big caramely malt notes in the aroma with some citrus and floral essence too. The taste is mostly sweet caramely malts, again with some fruity backbone. Modest hop twinge in the finished. A little unbalanced, weighing heavily in the malt direction, but still tasty. Medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Exceptionally smooth and drinkable. Great session beer, though a little pricey for what it is."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. This could be a great session beer."
"Censored pours a copper color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mostly malty but there is a noticeable amount of hops. The flavor has a strong malty component but there is a fair amount of spicy hops too. Overall, just a bit better than average."
"In a word, balanced. This is a great example of a hoppy version of the style that doesn't go overboard in any one area."
"D. Great brew and being the first brew I've tried from Lagunitas I'm highly pleased."
"This beer poured a red-tinged copper with a single-finger head. The smell is malt and a bit of citrus. The taste starts off with some caramel malt and orangey citrus that's balanced pretty well by the hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation. This is pretty drinkable for a strong and fairly hoppy beer, I might just end up getting this one again sometime."
"A worthy effort from Lagunitas but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Drinkability - I don't think I could drink more than 2 with the amount of mucus build up in my mouth, but I would drink it again if I cam across it. Remember...don't sip."
"NOTES: BBCSD-200901-Danielle"
"M/D - Overpowering smell and taste make this something I will finish but hope to never encounter again. For those who enjoy the types of flavors evident here, this will be a big winner. However, for me it's a loser."
"Drinkability: Censored is very smooth and easy drinking. It's a well-balanced amber ale."
"D-Very drinkable."
"Pours an amber/copper with a decent head of foam. Lots of caramelly, malty aromas, hints of metal, and floral hops. Flavour is sweet and dense, rich with fruit and hop bitterness. Sticky caramel and molasses malts give this brew a heavy body and also a bit of a solvent undertone. Finishes quite bitter. Pretty much as advertised - rich and copper... not what I would call refreshing and a bit coarse for my taste."
"Credible finger+ head, mostly tiny, dense bubbles which allows it to last well, even as the lacing slides off the glass back into the muck. Metallic red rust color, inclines more towards red and orange but has some brown in it as well. In the nose the hops come through clearly bringing grassy, herbal notes in front of pine, lemon peel, pink grapefruit pith, honey glaze, spring flowers, no really overt malt presence although smoothly textured. Full-bodied, steadily expansive across the palate without becoming leaden. Here caramel and butterscotch supplement the honey to sweeten the pot. More pie dough and pancake mix as well. Never toasty nor roasty, and on the hop side there's the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus and diminished herbaceousness. The carbonation at once percolates things slightly and then removes rough spots from the overall texture. It's very drinkable and approachable but the anticipated higher gear never kicks in."
"D - not bad. I would drink again if offered but won't seek out buying this."
"Given it is lumped into the Ami Amber/Red ale's and given the broad interpretation within this grouping, it is a very drinkable brew even @ the 6.2% abv."
"This ""Rich Copper Ale," as the bottle proclaims, pours a--wait for it--copper color with a nice finger and a half of pillowy head. Smell is a touch hoppy with herbal notes. The taste follows suit with light herbal hops, a balanced amount of malt, and some orange and lemon zest in the finish. The balance makes for a nice mouthfeel and a pleasant, leafy finish. As smooth and easy as this bottle went down, I found the drinkability to be excellent. What a great surprise from Lagunitas!"
"Smell has a sweet brown sugar with some honey suckle. Taste is raw honey and floral hops. A little bit of ginger. A little gritty in the texture but still a lighter body. This would be OK in small doses."
"D: This is interesting and rather flavorful for the style. I would drink this again. I wouldn't say it's sessionable, as it's kind of estery and boozy, but a nice change of pace beer."
"D: This is balanced well enough with bitterness and hoppiness and abv to be a regular in the rotation"
"Very nice looking pour, although the head is a bit thing. It's a very deep red/brown color. It smells of maple syrup to me. I don't know if anyone else gets that, but it has a very caramel-y and syrup smell. Has a great sweet, malt taste without much of a hop after-taste. Not much complexity to the taste. It just gets maltier and sweeter as it warms up. Overall, a good beer. I was shocked to find that it was 5.9% on ABV, because the alcohol is not at all present. I'd have again if it were available. Great drinkability and worth the try, I think."
"Smell is of dark malts, slight fruit. Taste of caramel malts, slight hoppyness. Very smooth on the palate with a nice finish. Quite well balanced. I'd enjoy finishing another couple of these."
"Pours a dark copper with minimal head that diminishes to ring in no time. The head is not needed with this beer, as its taste does all the work. A delectable red ale, don't want to go as far as saying one of the best I've had, but it's up there. Has a spiced flavor to it, forgive me if I'm wrong but I also pick up anise and licorice scents. Mouthfeel is extraordinary, very thick for a red. Lingers on the tongue and roof of the mouth. I really enjoy this brew and am becoming a big fan of Lagunitas."
"Pretty good to darned solid Good. Like all the Lagunitas stuff, it's solid, enjoyable, high quality and very drinkable--but never outstanding or world class (IMO, OK?). Hey, gotta give them props, their beers always range from good to kick-ass across the board. Seems like a low score for this one, but no, I like it just fine, it's totally solid, but nothing that I couldn't live without. Serviceable, I think they say."
"Well, Lagunitas pulled it out on this one. Great beer with a very good flavor. Very nice smell. Not that hoppie, not that sweet. Just an all around good beer. I'd have it on more than one occasion. Kronic is a very good beer. If you are looking for a good Californian beer, with a great flavor and very good all around tast, this is the one."
"From a 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear amber color with a small white head that disappeared very quickly. Smell is sweet and malty. Taste is of sweet caramel malt with a slight hop bitterness. This beer is medium bodied and goes down smooth. This beer is good but a bit sweet for my liking."
"drinkability: very very easy and smooth"
"D - its refreshing but for my taste i couldn't take more than one because of the sweetness"
"Notes - I found this delicious and utterly drinkable, but it sort of plays to my sweet tooth."
"The beer has a pretty decent taste. It is very crisp and light, but balanced. This does somewhat make up for the terrible head that it poured with. The caramel malt really comes through and I don't detect any bitter hops."
"D: Really a pleasant, sessionable brew. Would have no problem drinking and enjoying several of these."
"Clear copper pour with off-white head. Caramel, cinammon, some dried fruit make up the nose. Astringent taste with hops and grain up front, which is really out of place for a Lagunitas product. Malty middle with caramel flavors that leads to the more familiar Lagunitas sweetness in the back. Tasty beer."
"Decent beer, easy to drink but nothing spectacular."
"Drinkability: Its thin, well carbonated, and lightly sweet so its an easy session drinker. But I'm not sure I'd want to :)"
"its really hard to taste the hops, not bad.. but not overly memorable"
"D - Thats a lot of hops at the end with a little too much bitterness for my liking."
"Decent on the tongue. Medium bodied. Clean and dry. A little too sweet for my liking. One of these and I grow weary."
"D- not too good, tastes and feels awkward as the scales are tipped on the malty side."
"Not a huge fan of this beer as it sits awkwardly on the palate. Definitely had better Red Ales."
"Notes: A successful offering from Lagunitas but nothing earth shattering for me. I do appreciate the attention brought on it by the whole ""censored"" label and everything."
"A solid amber ale from Lagunitas. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"Overall a good beer if you crave some malty goodness-but not a malt bomb."
"D: This is a nice simple brew. I can see why it was named the Kronic. It is simple but you want more after every pull. Goes down easy and the ABV isn't noticable at all. Good brew."
"D= This was a damn fine brew and one I would happily seek out again. Very drinkable, very sessionable and full of flavor."
"Very drinkable amber ale."
"Poured hard into a large Ayinger glass. Dark copper color topped by a large fluffy cream colored head and crystal clear. Smells of burnt toffee, caramel apple, earthy hops, pumpernickel toast. Flavors include toast, pithy citrus, lemon, and caramel. Finish is bitter and slightly metallic. Mouthfeel is medium, as is the carbonation. A fairly easy drinking ale with solid bitterness - I think the metallic finish would get in the way after a while. I have enjoyed some of the hoppy ales from Lagu very much - this was a bit of a change of pace. I would love to try it fresh on tap."
"The aroma was strongly malted with some sweetness. The taste was mostly malt dominated again and it seemed to leave an odd flavor on the tongue that I could not shake. I powered it down and left it at that. It was nice carbonated but not high on the food chain in the Amber category."
"D - Could drink a few of these and would be happy to do so."
"M: Medium-bodied and smooth, with enough hop bite to round out the experience. A very nice brew."
"M/D- Medium bodied and very smooth. Easy drinking as well."
"d. Very drinkable. This has become my go-to six-pack when I can't make up my mind. It usually fits the bill, and always tastes great and it's no problem to drink a few in a row... a pleasant surprise for something as flavorful and thick."
"drinkability-this was an ok beer a bit to sweet for me"
"D - One of the more generally enjoyable Red Ales I've had. Pretty easy to session and not a bad offering in a sea of hoppiness"
"Drinkability: I could drink more than one of these"
"This beer looked tasty in the glass. Great copper color with small off white head. I was surprised by the strong smell of hops as I expected a more subdued roasted smell. In flavor it really comes off as an IPA which I was not expecting. The alcohol comes out in the flavor more than I expected even in a beer the is almost 6%. It leaves a fantastic aftertaste that shows off the complexities and sweetness that are lost to the hops and alcohol during the actual drink. It goes down easy though almost like flat soda. Overall this taste like a nice easy IPA. But for myself I would choose something else even if I was looking for an IPA."
"Taste: Hop taste is more subdued in the taste than it was in the smell. Almost tastes like someone blended an IPA with a brown ale."
"D: Definitely drinkable, my favorite beer of this style is Red Seal and this is close behind it."
"Pours an absolutely beautiful copper color, one of the best I've seen in a beer, very inviting. Smell is just average, with some hops and malts slightly. The taste is of caramel malts and is well balanced with a great drinkability. Great overall beer."
"The story begins. Picture this: thick field of caramel-laced bready malt, thick with bitterness and wonderment, all Autumn-orange like a Van Gogh wheatscape, right outside the !CENSORED! and Citric inches up close to Floral to whisper, sensually !CENSORED! ""we can't -, Herbal will"" "Herbal's asleep, I !CENSORED! and all was happily ever after with a slightly bitter ending that was surprisingly dry after such a sweet beginning."
"This is another good beer from the Lagunitis brewing company."
"Drinkability: Quite nice, a good representative of what is for me an under-appreciated style. I'm very curious what the brewery's original name for this beer was, before they had to change it to [censored]!"
"Overall this was a solid beer, but nothing spectacular. A good choice for a session beer, and worth a shot."
"Pours a dark copper, slightly clear with a thin brownish-white head that dissipated into a thin collar. No laciness. Aroma was very malty and sweet and a slight hint of hops. Taste was also malty and sweet, with a hint of caramel and hops. There was a slight bitterness, not much aftertaste. Good texture for an ale, almost chewy. Good beer with excellent flavor but much to sweet for me to consider as a session beer."
"D: It's drinkable. Not that bad but not one of my favorite amber ales. I like the maltiness of it, but the hop flavor doesn't balance it out."
"D : A very sessionable beer on cask. I could keep drinking it with no problem."
"pours a copper color with a nice white head. the nose is sweet malts, nice hops, kind of like a breed of tomato zest hops!? the taste is sweet malts, floral hops, lighter fruits, kind of tastes like a California Common style. medium body, sweet finish, almost too sweet though"
"Easy to drink, but why would I want another?"
"This is a sessionable amber that I could make a night out of. Give it a try."
"Pours an amber/copper (go figure) color with some head that does settle down to almost nothing. Aroma is caramel malts with floral hops secondary with nothing really over-powering but it's nice. Medium-bodied and a pretty good tasting brew. The flavor starts off with malts, some fruits, honey, then turns to slightly bitter hoppiness to a dry, slightly spicy finish. Solid. Nicely balanced and a good mix of malts and hops. No problem getting this one again."
"D. I love this, definately a Friday night beer, a great brew for beginner or experienced drinker. It always seems to please"
"A good autumn red ale."
"medium to light bodied, but very drinkable indeed...good session ale"
"Lighter carbonation lends to a slick mouthfeel and an overall a very drinkable beer."
"D: very nicely balanced red ale, could easily have a few of these."
"This seems to be one that would go nicely with food. I enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability is high. Low alcohol makes this beer easily sessionable. Good flavor makes for easy consumption."
"Good drinkability. Low ABV allows it to be sessioned."
"Pretty refreshing, but kind of boring. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing to get excited about either though. Not sure what the ""censored"" label is about? Please explain that to me if you know."
"Great drinkability from this light-medium bodied, nicely-balanced beer."
"A very drinkable beer. I could deffinetly session this one. I was a fan of the suprise hops flavor and would reccomend it to others. It's deffinetly good, however there is nothing particuarly outstanding about it."
"Overall: I had one before, and it tasted more like a pale ale to me. After a second tasting I wonder if I grabbed the wrong bottle. Excellent stuff, highly recommended."
"poured a nice amber with red highlights and a nice off white head that lingers for a while. the aroma is malty, lots of caramel, and maybe a bit of a hop background. the taste is very sweet up front, the caramelized crystal malts really doing their thing, but as sweet as it starts the hop bitterness is there to balance it out. a nice full body and adequate carbonation made this one an easy drinker."
"A decidedly middling affair. I've had this on tap before and enjoyed it more, but I was pretty disappointed with this bottle. There are more enjoyable, more complex, and plain better interpretations of the style."
"D-Not my fav, but I would buy it again because something about it just hits the spot."
"Overall, an interesting beer, lives up to its name, but not something I'm crazy about."
"D - Easy to drink but doesn't stand out in a crowd."
"D: It was actually very enjoyable and I could finish off a six-pack easily."
"The Kr*nic pours a nice copper (orange/brownish) color with a big booming white head that stays around and sticks to the inside of the glass. The carbonation is pretty lively to the eye. The nose definitely doesn't jump out at you, some subtleties of roasted malts, cherry and other fruit notes come through. It tastes very bright and vibrant yet rich and toasty, the roasted malts are definitely dominant in this one but some subtle hop/citrus character is detected as well. Other tasting notes include, burnt wood ash, bready yeast and some rye-like spice. Its buttery smooth medium body and good amount of carbonation make this one very drinkable."
"This comes out of the tap a clear coppery brown that is rather appetizing. Aroma is of average strength, and mainly hoppy with a little malty scent. Flavor is strongly hoppy and has some malty taste. Texture is smooth. Not complex, but satisfying and pleasant."
"Pretty good beer, but I just want more hops."
"This is a perfectly OK beer, but there are plenty of more exciting competitors out there."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a brownish golden amber. It had a 1 finger white head that mixed both small and large bubbles. Left a small layer of head on top. Aroma was a mix between ginger snap cookie and wheat bread. Flavor was slightly bitter and also reminded me of potatoes? Don't ask why. Felt slightly oily in the mouth, but coated the mouth well. Easy to drink, but not my first choice."
"Medium bodied, foams up a bit on the mouth, medium carbonation cleanses the palette nicey. I'm not overly enamored with this beer but I think it'd go great with a burger or a nice big sandwich."
"Overall, pretty decent representative of the style. Not as intriguing as I have come to expect from the folks at Lagunitas, but still a solid beer."
"Ok, first off this is not The Chronic. It is a red colored ale with a decent head that fades fast. The smell is a malty sweetness. The flavor is that of a bland amber ale with the trademark Lagunitas sweetness. This beer is ok but not something I look for when I think of west coast red ales."
"M + D: Wet and refreshing, though I could stand for a little more body. Nonetheless, it is a decent summer amber, and I could go back to it over the season without hesitation."
"Has a pleasant deep amber color and a light malty smell, with a thin head that dissolves quickly. Light carbonation makes this easy to drink, and doesn't leave you feeling stuffed. Not as bitter as other copper ales-- in fact, it could use a bit more bitterness. Nonetheless, I'd drink it again. Great summer beer."
"deep amber color with a two finger light tan head that held up well and a nice wispy lace to the finish. slight ripe fruit smell along with some spice in the nose. rich malt biscuit taste up front, slightly sweet, with some caramel and spice. mouthfeel medium carbonation ok. had three one day and three the next and could have had more."
"Notes: Session for sure . Good feelings all around. Not complex,but who cares? It gets the job done."
"D- Drinks good but doesnt call for more than 2."
"An overall good ale. I expected a bit more hops presence however."
"Copper. The label says ""Copper."" This one looked exactly as I would have guessed. Deep copper color in the glass, little foam that laced nicely all the way down. Malty with a hint of hops in the nose, and taste was the same. Unfortunately, a bit tin or (pun intended) ""copper"" in the aftertaste. Didn't ruin it for me, but would definitely keep me from making this a session beverage."
"Poured copper, as the name would indicate, with a light brown head. It has a delicate hop aroma with some metallic smell. Despite a nice malty background and a nice amount of hops, the metallic taste was just a bit off-putting. Overall, it's very mellow and drinkable for a beer of its abv."
"Overall a nice refreshing beer. Nicely hopped but well balanced."
"D: Session beer with good flavor. Very enjoyable to knock back 3 or 4 of these."
"overall, i really enjoyed this"
"this is a great beer, the kind that you go ""this is a great beer"" it wont redefine the world, but it will make you love your love for beer"
"Pours out a beautiful dark amber. The head is light and disappears quickly. Smell is a little hoppy/flowery. It tastes crisp at first, smoothing out quickly and has a definite hoppy character . A moderate hopsy flavor throughout but an odd aftertaste at the end (my friend calls it ""perfumey"") that isnt entirely unpleasant. Mouthfeel is great, very smooth but almost oily leaves a bit of a coat on the tongue and throat. Definitely drinkable, you could easily follow the advice on the bottle ""Don't Sip""."
"Again hilarious name you crazy potheads at Lagunitas. You can't not like a beer named The Kronic. I enjoyed it well chilled in a pint glass. Powered the same color it says on the bottle: a rich copper. The smell was nice floral hop but not overpowering and a pinch of sweet malt. The taste was about equal to the aroma with a nice complexity and good balance. Dude, I think I'm getting the munchies."
"Amazingly good."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Fordham Maibock pint glass. Fairly vigorous pour resulted in minimal head with almost no retention. the Kronic poured a lovely coper color. Smells of malts and slight hoppiness. Nice rich taste, slight hop bitterness immediately on the tongue followed by a solidly malted body, slight sweet finish. Another very tasty product from Lagunitas. Well Done!"
"D: Drinkability was ok, not a session ale. A big dry, malty red with a good hop bitterness makes for a good try."
"A friend of mine spoke very highly of this beer so when I found it on a trip outside Alabama, I was sure to pick it up. I was not disappointed. This beer is smooth but delivers such a powerful punch for a red ale. No overpowering aftertastes which is great in my book. Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Will certainly buy again."
"Drinkability is high. I've never sessioned these before, but think it's a great all occasion beer, also one that would be a good transition brew for non-craft drinkers."
"Easy to drink. I had previously had a bottle while drunk/not paying too much attention, and it didn't do much for me. I will say that I found this to be much better. I could have had another, but this was my choice for last call. I probably won't get this beer again for a while, unless it's on special, as it was tonight."
"Poured into mini heffe glass at 08 Long Island Crew Brew festival. The suds came out in force on this one and were a finger or more, perhaps more to chilling for the festival, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The smell was a good mix of hops but not overpowering. The Taste was a suprising creamyness. Rich and thick for my mouthefeel and I'd go back to this one easily."
"Pours a clear red color with no head retention at all. The nose is of rich caramel toffee and caramel malt with some earthy hops. The flavor is smooth caramel and butterscotch toffee with an initial bitter tartness on the tip of your tounge. Personally enjoy the sweet candy sugar that coats your mouth like a film. The finish is kind of bland all you can taste is the left over sugar but the flavor is not as intense as it is when the beer is in your mouth."
"Drinkable, but 12oz is enough for me I think."
"A real nice amber, great balance."
"I don't know what's exactly being Censored here, but it certainly isn't flavor."
"D- For what it is worth, this one goes down very easy and the fairly low ABV makes this a good one to enjoy while cooking, doing homework or working on the house."
"Overall, a nice balanced brew and different offering from Lagunitas. Good session beer in my opinion. More flavors and character reveal itself the more I drink. Time to grab another one. Cheers!"
"Overall feeling of this beer, it is a little thin with moderate carbonation, not too strong of flavor. This is just an OK example of a red ale. Worth a try, but nothing too extravagant."
"hazy dark copper/amber in color with an off-white head and good lacing. floaties are present, which detracts a bit from the appearance. aromas of toffee, caramel, and burnt sugar dominate, with some resiny pine and fruitcake notes. taste was a rather rich, bready caramel malt profile balanced by a moderate hop bitterness, overall a bit on the malty side. medium-bodied with a spritzy, lively carbonation. overall a very well done session beer, and i'm sure this is great fresh at the brewery."
"Censored is $%*(!ing easy to drink and well put together. I have been getting lucky with out of state beers lately... would love a six pack of this. Anyone out there?"
"D_ A very good and drinkable brew, but Lagunitas has so many others to try."
"Censored pours a strange burnt orange copper color with a bit of a haze. The lid on it is eggshell with good size and a modest creaminess that thins to leave nice lacing. The nose is surprisingly fruity. Tangy tangerine and sweet orangey citrus unite with sweet caramel and lightly toasted malt aromas. A drop of vanilla and floral hops help to meld the fruit and grains together. Medium in body with a smooth and creamy texture. Tangerine returns in the taste along with sweetly toasted caramel malts. Fresh, orangey citrus rounds out the edges while a bit of bitter rind comes through with toasted malts in the finish. Throw in a dash of earthly black pepper spiciness and you've got yourself the kronic. I didn't really know what to expect from this brew, but it really impressed me. I would liken it to a censored version of a barleywine or strong ale. Great flavor, while incredibly drinkable. This is a great everyday offering from a brewery that hasn't let me down yet."
"Short, fat, 12 oz single bottle copped for $1.99 from Total Wine and More in Union, as a big fan of Lagunitas, had high hopes for this one... ""Rich Copper Ale"" on the white, logo sticker... Pours an attractive copper and bronze appearnce with an impressive head that lingered for a while... smell was on-target for the style, with a nice mixture of caramel and hops... taste was equally on-point, with noticeable vanilla, bittersweet sugar-candies, grapefruit, esters, and a noticeable amber essence... very good, crisp, clean flavor that burst through and was loaded with quality and character... very good stuff from Lagunitas and another winner from a terrific brewery... nice, creamy mouthfeel with amazingly easy drinkability for a rather modest 5.9% ABV... I could drink this stuff all night... Very good sample... Definitely recommended..."
"Taste is big with malts, very sweet and almost a bit too much if one isnt ready. I like the big malt taste. Sweet and thick with a lingering bitterness."
"Good."
"So this is a hearty endorsement and thumbs up."
"Had on draft at Alioto's in the Fisherman's Wharf in S.F. Nice amber, inviting colored pour, with a good white head. Very nice hop smell mostly. Taste bordered on the edge of great hop flavor and too much hop bitterness, but never really crossed it. A touch over ideal bitterness, but a good, drinkable refreshing beer nonetheless."
"Overall, a very good amber/copper ale. Well balanced flavors."
"This beer has a great amber color and is very clear. It has a healthy head, mild aroma, and great initial taste. A solid mouth feel with moderate sweetness and only a hint of hops finishes it nicely. It was much better than other Lagunitas offerings I've tried. I'll definitely have it again."
"The body is good, making this a fine ale and a good choice when you're looking for a flavorful, hoppy ale that won't get you falling down drunk after a few."
"D - Average I suppose, I would have no quarrels were I to drink this for an evening, though I imagine boredom would eventually settle in. Worth a try at any rate."
"Reddish copper color with half an inch of light tan foam that dissipates quickly to islands and a ring. Not much in the aroma department. Taste is malty like an ale should be, nothing leaps out just a nice drinkable ale. Good carbonation and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability - not my favorite slant on hops, but it's okay."
"D - A very drinkable red ale. I always find that many good red ales make up for their lack of complexity with balance and drinkability, and this is no exception."
"Overall not bad, I will give it that it was above average but thats about it. It was nothing terribley great and the flavor seemed a bit dull and boring to me, but again it was not terrible, I do not think I would purchase it again, however I could drink it if it was offered for sure."
"Tastes of caramel malt, spices, earthy hops (with a bit of citrus). Scores big in the drinkability department."
"Pours a clear copper color with a rather small light tan head that dissipated into a slight ring around the glass. The smell is faint, I pick up some caramel malt and perhaps a trace of hops, a bit disappointed here. The taste is of caramel and slightly toasted malt, a touch of honey, and some grassy hop action to balance the brew out. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation. Its not overly carbonated or watery but something reminds me of seltzer water. The brew finishes very balanced. A very easy drinking brew, not outstanding on flavor but enjoyable."
"The beer poured a rich copper color (hence the name!), with a thin almond-colored head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. The smell was of sweet malt, with earthy undertones - no discernable hop aroma. Kind of a fizzy beer, with nothing extraordinary as far as malt or hop flavor - a bit of a disappointment, given some of their other excellent beers (i.e. Kill Ugly Radio, Maximus, Imperial Red)."
"Pours a crystal clear amber that has a small crème head at first and then it falls quickly. Nose is hoopy, earthy, sweet. Those are three words that come to mind. And they mesh well together and one doesn't stand too far out in front of the other. Flavor is more along the lines of earthy with a cereal like aftertaste hitting at the very, very end. That aftertaste doesn't show up after the initial hits and is replaced by a zingy tang. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is pretty good too. Overall this is fairly good. I can't say it is blowing me away by any means. But it certainly is well made."
"Drinkability is good. Lots of nice flavors, without being overly strong. Definitely a beer that can be enjoyed more than once in the same seating."
"-Oelergud"
"Poured an excellent dark red color, they were on with calling it a copper ale. Had a nice head and good lacing, as well. Nice scent, a good malt/hop mixture. Same for the test, a great flavor with good malts going down and nice hops for an aftertaste. Went down great, I hope my buddy brings more back from California next time."
"the flavor is rich and malty with a firm bitterness, there is a toffee flavor in the background, grassy, herbal, ending with a lingering hint cocoa flavor."
"D: A really delicious, solid malty red/amber ale. Probably will appeal to a wide audience due to its nice balance with no flavors or aromas being overwhelmingly strong."
"Very light bitterness, which makes it approachable to the average micro drinker. Again, a clean caramel malt dominates the flavor, fruit cocktail and mild citrus, with puffed wheat aftertaste. Pretty satisfying, and a session-beer extraordinaire."
"Censored is a good beer... not mind blowing but very West Coast balanced (and I like that MO.) I really have no idea how to make it better.. I just know it could be... still a pretty drinkable brew.. but I would only really want 1-2 and after that it would be just because I don't have anything else in the fridge."
"D: This is a good offering, the taste is mild (relatively speaking). A nice sessioner."
"Another score for Lagunitas. I'd say this is definitely a great session brew, as it's inoffensive enough to give to the indecisive and satisfying enough for the avid beer drinker."
"Drinkability: Good session ale. It has an excellent amount of flavor coupled with an amazing cleanliness for an ale."
"Drinkability: Definatly a quaffable amber with some good flavors and balance. Nothing that really stands out exept it's exquisit balance- but a very worthy session beer none the less. The beer im reveiwing is somewhere around 6%, i wish i was tasting the beer of the same name that apparently used to be closer to 8%, then i would not be -quite- as inclined to call it a sessioner ;)"
"D: This one does not slap you in the face but I really like this one and will try to keep on hand for guests who need to be coaxed into finding out what a micro could offer in taste."
"Nothing too amazing, just a well-rounded brew."
"Drinkability: Would make a very good session beer. I could drink a few of these over the course of a night."
"This is a great beer. Lagunitas took a relatively unperforming style and gave it some pep. Recommended."
"This beer obviously got it's notoriety from the name/label than the contents of the bottle. Overall, a very mediocre and unbalanced beer."
"Lagunitas has made a big impression around here with a collection of well-made IPAs (Undercover) and others like this Censored. We had this on draught and enjoyed it a lot. Deep clear copper red in the glass with a modest head. Fairly muted nose. Palate is complex mixture of fruit, malt, caramel, baking spices, no sharp edges or overstatement, but an interesting and rewarding and easy drinking pint."
"D- Could drink a bunch of these in a sitting. Perfect for watching football all afternoon."
"D: I could drink a few of these in a row..."
"Pours a very nice copper amber color with a thin head. Aroma is a mixture of both hops and malt with a sweetness as well. Taste starts out malty upfront and fades with a nice sweetness/bitterness at the back of the throat. It's even a bit smoky. It feels like a well-balanced amber ale to me. Very sessionable too!"
"Had this on tap at the Jax Deli & Ale House in Lake Mary, Florida. This one pours a clean copper color, as advertized, with a sturdy dull white head and good lacing. The smell is malty with spruce hops. The flavor jumps out as a nice chocolatey mixture with piney hops. Nicely carbonated with a respectable body just short of a slick feel. There is a peppery presence that remains throughout, keeps it lively to the last. There is a yeasty quality, dry tartness that contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the malt/hops combination. Good complexity with great drinkability. Another hit from the Lagunitas gang. This should appeal to most anyone while giving a bit of hops to those in need."
"A really nice beer. Many IPA like qualities up front, but in the end it is, as advertised, an Amber/Red Ale. Looks good..coppery red color, medium sized slightly off white head and good lacing. Smell is very good....hoppy like an IPA. Taste starts out hoppy (not pine, not grapefruit...just hoppy) but then balances out (a West Coast hoppy balance to be sure) with a somewhat sweet, caramel maltiness. I now know what caramel malt flavor is all about. The mouthfeel is rich and crisp. The flavors hold up well...even better as the beer warms. Drinkability is good. I could see swilling several of these and enjoying every one. An excellent beer...really enjoyed it."
"Overall an good amber ale. Right in the meaty part of the curve."
"Another very good solid beer. I'd recommend this."
"Overall: An okay offering my Lagunitas. I will stick to the big hop bombs they put out in bombers. This is an average beer that would probably be enjoyed by those just getting into the craft brew scene."
"The beer pours a nice copper and amber color, a decent white head, some lacing, some retention. The smell is very good and you'll detect nice piney notes in the hops, some toasted malts, maybe some fruits in the fig/apricot/raisin family. The smell is better than the taste. The hops became a bit more bitter than I would have liked and the malts were more than toasted, rather burnt and too caramely for my liking. The aftertaste was a bit bitter and it lingered too long on the tongue. The mouthfeel was a bit creamy and this was accentuated a bit by the moderate carbonation in the beer, so this aspect gets a slightly better grade. Overall, I appreciated the hoppy character of the beer and its enticing smell, but the beer was also compromised by its rough edges and bitter aftertaste. This one is a one and done for me."
"I poured this skunky smelling flat beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was copper colored with a tan head that went away really fast. The tast was sour hoppy and reminded me of hay. The lacing was pretty decent but that is all I have to say good about this beer. I will not buy again."
"Good looking beer bubbling over with frothy potability. Havent been smelling well lately, but the hoppy, grainy, sweet wort shines through in this pontiac firebird red/orangey body. A well balanced beer with a left jab of hops followed by a blow of sweet sweet malts to the head. A hint of alcohol cuz it's a lagunitas, but, sweet balanced, big mouthfeel. I havent had a lagunitas I didnt like, and this one's no different."
"D: Not a session beer, feel it would be good with a hearty meal, maybe a beef stew or nice roast beef."
"In color, it's copper to bronze, crowned with a soapy head. Subtle aroma of tropical fruit makes way for esters. This amber ale is a good one packed with flavor. It starts with fruity esters and ends with a punch of hop flavor in the back, leaving biscuity notes on the palate in the aftertaste. Quite tasty. I'll be coming back for more of this later."
"Flavors were very well balanced here. Starts off with a Sugar Daddy caramel and dark honey flavor followed by a quite firm herb and spice hoppy bitterness. Finishes smooth and slightly sweet. Easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"Very nice pour- reddish amber with a quickly dissipating off white head. Crisp aromas flowed form the pint glass- earthy hops, and slightly caramelized malty goodness. Taste was amazing- clean flavor, excellent piney hops pair perfectly wth the slightly roasted malts which have a sweetness that is balanced and refreshing. This would be a great sessioner, it goes down very easy. The mouthfeel has a chewiness to it but it is not overly malted and heavy and has no off flavors to speak of. There is hardly anything negative to say; im glad that an american style can hold its own against old school heavyweights."
"It poured a nice copper color with good head formation. Smell was pretty minimal, with a bit of caramel but nothing special. Flavor was more peppery than anything else, with a very small amount of fruitiness balanced with some caramel. All-in-all I didn't find this beer to be extremely flavorful though, although it wasn't bad. There is some style mismatch here, but this beer reminded me quite a bit of a Leinenkugel's Red with a significantly softer mouthfeel. Pretty good."
"Mouthfeel thick and rich. Sweetness stays on the tongue."
"This all led to a finish that was long and good. This was another very fine offering by Lagunitas."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a reddish copper color with a nice off-white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. The aroma is sweet toasted malt with some caramel and citrusy hops. The taste is malt up front but the hops kick into full gear shortly after leaving a nice long bitter finish from the hops. Overall, this is a delicious Amber that is highly recommended."
"Body is just fine, maybe a touch on the full side of medium. Quite smooth and enjoyable, but the emphasis is definitely on drinkability rather than loads of flavor."
"Thick and rich. Really is chewy, in a good way. Feels like a real ALE. Creamy. Overall, very good: rich, thick, bold, bitter, slightly sweet, and balanced."
"If I DO have a complaint it is that this doesn't seem like a 7.7% beer, which makes me want to session it...and I don't think that would be a good idea. (and I'm not sure, but the sweetness could get annoying after a few of these)"
"Pours a hazy copper color with a quickly receding white head, leaving bits of lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, caramel-like with a touch of floral hops. Taste gives a trace of toffee, plenty of caramel sweetness that lingers, accompanied by just about the right amount of hops. Medium body and soft, yet higher carbonation. The numbers in my review do not fully match my opinion of this beer. Taste is higher than 4, but not quite a 4.5. This is one that I think I may be picking up more regularly. Well played, Lagunitas."
"Acquired at the Bier Stein, Eugene, OR. This was my favorite beer in my six-pack ""Salute to Lagunitas"" Adventure. It poured out a rich golden-amber color with a thin frothy white-tan head. The smell was sweet with some hints of caramel malts, but not at all strong. Which made the taste surprising, because the it tasted very strongly of caramel/toffee malts and was quite sweet and complex. I liked this quite a bit - probably my favorite Lagunitas at this point."
"Taste was good and exactly what I was looking for. Crisp refreshing acidity, good sweetness, and rounded by a slight hop character."
"D: Kind of tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, decent kick, it’s a beer that you can drink for a while but it’s not the first one that I would choose. This is a brewery that even the beers that have underwhelmed me have still been pretty decent, however this beer just seems to have that “just another beer” quality to it."
"A nice drinker of an ale here. Good depth and hop character throughout, as it always keeps interesting with subtle layers of toasted citrusy stuff. Solid stuff."
"D- I could drink about 2 of them. I really like the beer and it is pretty unique, but it is on the sweet side and more than a couple may not be the best way to enjoy it."
" All in all I really like this beer. I will be sure and get some more in the morning. If you get a chance be sure and ""score"" some."
"Pours a nice, deep, crystal clear amber color with a nice slightly tan two fingers of head that takes its time disappearing. Looks pretty good. Nose is okay; a little grain, some sweet brown sugar malt. Nothing much else in there. Taste is solid; up front sweet caramel malt. Salty hops show up at the back, giving it an almost ESB flavor. Feel is solid, good carbonation and a nice bite on the tongue too. Overall, I liked this one, although I might throw it in the ESB style rather than Ambers (although it is a catch all, so what do I know?). Definitely a tasty one, in any case."
"Overall: a pretty simple and strait forward beer, but put together pretty well. Sessionable for a higher alcohol beer. How floral the hops were stuck out to me the most."
"D: A tasty and very drinkable beer. Nothing that's going to knock your socks off but a very solid, drinkable, and tasty offering from Lagunitas."
"Caught it at the Vortex while visiting Atlanta. Fares well as a hightly hopped Amber. Could be a Pale Ale. Richly malted, but not highly kilned. Flavors and textures lean toward biscuit-ey, rather than toasty. The hops wash out the conservative matlitness a bit and lend a mild metalic flavor. The feel could hold a bit more weight, but the attenuation seemed to keep the beer lighter feeling, but heavier in alcohols. A solid brew for the summer, but still cannot compare to their Imperial Red."
"Drinkability- Not bad, not great."
"This beer poured a light amber color with almost no head and no lacing at all. The smell was fairly malty and inviting. The taste was pretty interesting. Nice, malty taste with spicy undertones that left a spicy, aftertaste that reminded me a little bit of cinnamon. Pretty full bodied, but leaning a little toward the thin side. Overall, a pretty drinkable beer. Not very filling and tastes pretty good."
"Poured a bright, clear copper with a half-inch of sticky head that left slight lacing, which didn't really retain on the glass. The aromas and the taste were both well balanced between a rich, slightly toasted caramel malt and a blend of floral, spicy, and earthy hops -- a nice accomplishment. The malts end up winning out, with brown sugar dominant in the finish, but the hops keep creeping back with different flavors throughout the drinking of this beer. Full, creamy mouthfeel, and extremely drinkable. It's not my favorite for the style, by any means, but it's a very well put-together brew."
"Drinkability on this one is off the charts. Seems to show off a different side which each sip.. Wish I had more than 2 of these."
"Pours a beautiful rich copper color as the label describes and I coulnd't say it any better. A solid quarter inch head forms and is everlasting. Aromas of plenty of hops with some bready background notes are really pleasant, a nice start. In the mouth a nice pillowy smooth mouthfeel almost like a nitro pour. Flavors are incredibly balanced: a nice hop flavor of citrus and mint followed by a delicious malty sweet flavor. At 25 IBUs, this is not a bitter beer like most of theirs, instead it is a session beer (at the upper ABV spectrum) that is so smooth and drinkable. The finish is so clean and begs for more sips, I wish this wasn't the only bottle for 500+ miles."
"Quite the tasty amber ale here. This would be a nice everyday beer. I'd certainly get it again. Recommended."
"Pours a clear red-amber with a one finger off white head that dissipates quickly but leaves moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet malts and brown sugar. Taste is sweet carmel malts and brown sugar with the perfect blend of hops to keep it from being too sweet. Remarkable. Creamy and moderately thick mouthfeel is extremely nice. Infinitely drinkable. A real pleasure and probably the best american red beer I have had to this point."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied and extremely drinkable. Easily a good session beer. I'm quite surprised by this beer. I really wasn't expecting much when I smelled it. But, I'm pleasantly surprised. Overall, it's pretty good. Definitely worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is smooth while the hop dries or cleans the palate. Though the malty sweet beginning, this beer is not overly sweet, but rather a D(censored)M good beer. Enjoy!!"
"This beer aint bad but I dont think I would revisit it again in the future.I havnt really been that happy with Lagunitas beers."
"This ale poured a cloudy burnt orange with a very generous head that appeared to die down quickly after pour. Lacing is quite sticky and granular throughout tasting. Smell has a bit of a metalic hint to it with a brown sugary undertone. Not an overpowering odor by any means, very pleasant. A very subtle crisp hop odor tickles the nose as well. Taste is very unique. Much more thick and chewy than I had anticipated, but very enjoyable. This is a tough beer to grasp a taste on, for some reason I feel as this is almost like an ESB. Mild hop bitterness with a sweet caramel malt that balances this out quite well. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Carbonation is minimal from start to finish. I find this beer to be extremely drinkable due to how very smooth it is. I really enjoyed this brew, nothing to seek out, but pick up a single if you have the chance."
"On tap at RFD Washington. Medium amber with little head. The aroma is moderately fruity and inviting. But this is a bit malty to the tongue ... almost chewy. Apple, tart, sap. Pretty viscuous. Relatively sharp alcoholic bite; I write myself a note to check the ABV later; I may have unwittingly ordered a big beer. (7.7, makes sense). (#2772, 4/5/2007)"
"this finish is perhaps a tad sweet for the average session but as a night cap or even with a rich dessert (think creme breulee) this would be marvellous."
"Would I? This is the last beer. This one will put you away. Like some of the other Lagunitas products I've had, it's the dessert for crazy hop heads. Yes. Try one."
"Light cloudy orange; the look of freshly squeezed orange juice. Obvious yeasty, chunky sediments. Luxurious, thick off-tan head; stringy lacing. The nose reveals west coast piney hops, orange juice and hints of caramel during warming. Powdery sweet-n-sour creaminess with slick flavorings of caramel malts and grassy hops. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Dry, zippy grapefruit left to graze the palate. Slender cleansing; smooth and hopped up. Pretty well balanced as some dry malts are noticeable near the end. Darn nice. For an amber/red--one of the best!"
"Pours and exceptionally clear orange-amber hue. Creamy off-white head just reaches two fingers and holds well leaving spotty lacing. Toasty pale malt, crystal malt, and strong dextins make up the malt aromas, with a healthy whiff of herabl and grassy American hops. First sip is sweet with caramel and toasty Biscuit malt, with a background roasted note. Flavor becomes deeply dextrinous for a brief moment before slipping into a delicate buttery fruit taste. This quickly gives way to a semi-dry aftertaste of piney resinous and bitter herbal American hops. Balanced and complex flavor, a credit to the style. Medium bodied, with a light carbonation that gives the illusion of extra body while retaining enough fine bubbles to ward off cloying from the large malt base. Finishes with residual caramel and roast tones, a touch of pumpkin fruitness and a mellow but full pine cone hop flavor. here is an amber ale with enough flavor top keep your attention but drinkable enough to be considered a session ale; likely to change some people's opinion of boring Red ales."
"I was surprised to see this beer on tap at the local college bar, The Ruck. This beer is amber is color with a light hop aroma. I was quite surprised how creamy it was though. There was a strong hop flavor, but not an equal level of hop bitterness. Although perhaps not to style, this is a good hoppy beer."
"I may not *actively* chase this one down again, but I would be happy to encounter it on tap or as a choice on the shelf."
"A decent brew. Easy enough to drink, despite a slight alcohol sharpness. To be honest, I didn't find anything particularly special about this brew. Seems pretty basic - sweet malt with a touch of bitterness and a bit too alcoholic for the style. Still in all, it's okay."
"Really tasty stuff! Try it! I bet it tastes great even while you are watching a good movie."
"The beer arrived in standard Lagunitas packaging consisting of 12 oz. brown bottles with the ubiquitous dog on the label. The pint glass I used was barely enough to contain the foamy head and the clear copper colored liquid. The smell was quite mild and sweet, with almost no hint of the hops typical in the offerings of this West Coast brewery. The taste was crisp, caramelized, and airy . The hops showed up as spicy overtones and citrus peels and were quite a bit more prominent than first hinted at by the smell, but the malt was clearly in charge of the whole taste. This was quite a deliberately balanced offering. As a result this beer felt full but subtle, and effect that is rarely seen in these days of ever bigger creations. This is one hell of a drinkable beer for being 7.7% ABV strong. Superb in most aspects, except for that dull smell."
"Mouthfeel is good, nothing outstanding here. Drinkability, I could have a few or several of these..."
"This was very drinkable, I felt; very sessionable. As I said earlier, a nice example of the style."
"Full bodied, rich and even a bit slick in the mouth. A very unique taste, this would be a good fair weather brew (spring or fall). Im guessing 5.5% - lets see"
"Censored pours a golden orange, clear without much head. Smell is sweet and malty, not too much else. Taste is sweet crystal malts, with a slight biscuity flavor. Hops are very light, and there is an almost black tea like flavor as well. There is a slight grainy aftertaste that I would ussually associate with cheap macros, but it's mild. Definitely a good session beer, easy drinking and delicious."
"Taste is a pine hop followed by bitter woodsy aftertaste. It has a mild sweet maltyness of honey and brown sugar. The subtle fruity malt complements the sweetness and hops well, making a superbly well rounded and drinakble brew. Mouthfeel is excellent as well: full, satisfying and clean without being overly watery. A very pleasant brew all around, another great California ale from Lagunitas."
"Notes: Not sure about the ABV on this one. I didn't notice any alcohol, yet I see from some other reviews that this is listed as 7.7%. On the other hand, BA lists it above as 5.9%. Regardless, it's a pretty flavorful beer and is very drinkable. Definitely recommended."
"When poured it was clear dark amber in color with a red hue. There was some white foam and a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste was of lighty roasted malts and spice with tart slightly piney hop flavor. Nicely balanced with the malts, spice and hops."
"Overall-This is a fine beer that starts to thin out when it warms much above beer fridge temps (45 or so). But has a lot f flavor and good flavor at that."
"Pours a nice dark golden with some ruby highlights. The head is moderate and light tan and leaves some slight lacing. The smell is sweet malt and a late hit of piney hops. The taste is sweet malt forward and is followed by a nice hit of spicy and piney hops. Biscuity and fruity flavors as well. Quite sweet,but well balanced and not at all insipid, the sweetness is deeply rich and malty. Mouthfeel is nice- supports the flavors well and isn't overcarbonated. Very drinkable, a great session beer."
"Pours an orangish red with a very nice cream colored head that leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt, fruit, a little herbal, and floral hops. Taste is more of the same with a little spice in there hops are pretty faint. An easy drinking red, nothing too earth shattering but very solid."
"An above average everyday beer."
"D - An easy drinker, nice smooth ambeer ale."
"Pours a clear copper, big off white head forms, some nice thick lacing, good retention. Smell is malty, some floral, toffee, bit of citrus, dark fruits and grain. Taste is grainy, toffee, burnt grains, raisins, dark fruits, clean bitterness, bit of a weak finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, bit of a strange flavour. Not bad but didn't really do anything for me."
"Clear, light reddish amber with a short, whitish head. The foam thinned quickly to a ring, leaving behind a bit of lace. Malty and fruity aroma with some gingerbread and toasty caramel. Moderate bitterness with some toasted malt, fruity hops and a bit of raisin. Still, the flavour seemed a tad thin. Carbonation was on the low side and the lightish body contributed to a soft mouthfeel. The finish was a little metallic. Not bad, but it didn't make a huge impression. Thanks for sharing Viggo!"
"Well done, very enjoyable beer."
"It's pretty good and a solid brew no doubt. I have my suspicions as to this bottles age, but I would still have to give this one a thumbs up."
"drinkability is great. tasty and well balanced beer. i liked this one a lot, more than anyone else at the table. thanks eric!"
"Overall- This just didn't do it for me! The flavor didn't blossom until the end. I want big chewy malt up front with an Amber. Drinkable but nothing memorable."
"Drinkability: A really nice, everyday drinker. Plenty of malts upfront but also nicely balanced with a citrusy hop bitterness in the finish. A true session beer in every sense of the word with a moderate abv and plenty of flavor. I could see this making a home in my DBF. Definitely recommended and one I will buy again. Seek and enjoy."
"Very nice, clear coppery amber in color. Soft hoppy aroma. Somewhat mellow. Malt and hop flavors balanced well together. Good sort of toasted and caramel sweetness to it. Very full mouthfeel. Much more body then most ambers I have had. Very enjoyable beer. Ambers do not do much for me anymore-this one sure does."
"Very nice easy drinking Amber, more flavor and hop goodness than your typical offering of this style."
"The drinkability in Very good also. this is one you could session quite easily. Prosit MK"
"thoughts on beer: as always I want more.. what more do I want out of this beer you ask??? well I will tell you. I want more of a nice warming booze flavor and feel out of this beer without changing any of the other flavor balances. A LOT to ask I know. But if this had the booze quality of an old stock ale or something of the sorts, I would be in heaven. I can only dream of sitting by the fire in the middle of winter with this beer in hand at 10%+ abv.. warming my cheeks and my soul.. Oh sorry, anyway, great beer!!"
"A good beer, but nothing that different from a lot of others I've had."
"Pours a hazy/coppery/tan with a thin head. Like most of Lagunitas' beer, hops is king. It hits you in the face when you stick your nose into the glass. Notes of citrus and fruit with a light scent of alcohol in the mix. The taste is simple, yet complex. With notes citrus, caramel, and alcohol one would think it too overbearing, yet the hops really help balance out the taste. It's a smooth drinking ale with a great mouthfeel. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Easily my favorite Copper Ale (well, there is Otter Creek too)!"
"This was a very nice drinking beer. It was like alternating between an IPA and barleywine, sip by sip. Worth picking up a full sixer."
"Pour results in a hazy amber colored brew with a 1/2"" flufffy head that dissipated fairly quick. Nose is subtle maltiness. I don't readily perceive the hops in this beer, but they are there doing their thing to keep the sweetness in check. This is a nicely balanced beer with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Easy to drink while one ponders the woes of the world."
"Wow. Thats great. I could drink this beer for a long time. Not a particularly sexy style, but beer doesnt need an OG of 1.090 or a hop sock in the nose. It just tastes so good."
"sweet enough, but not cloying, and the finish is fairly dry. it's a milder version of the style, but i appreciate the balance and restraint, though the malt profile is not complex. the bitterness is minty and piney"
"This one wasn't bad but, as mentioned, overly sweet in places. Nothing bad about this one per se, and in fact it's quite good overall, but it does need a bit of restraint in the sweetness area."
"D: Decent, but wasn't what I was really expecting for a ""strong"" ale."
"OK, so maybe this won't exactly stand out in a crowd, but it's certainly enjoyable while you're drinking it. It's not the kind of profile that conjures fond memories later on, but the fun is in the here and now. The easy nature and mellow elements, not to mention the well-disguised ABV, make this a pleasure to drink. So if nothing else, I'll remember I like it enough to willingly have it again."
"Amber color. Almost no head and no lacing. OK level of carbonation bubbles. Malty smell with an alcohol overtone. Taste follows suit. Bready, malty flavor. Some spiceyness - maybe a little pumpkin. I just don't know about this beer, there's nothing bad about it, but not anything that stands out either. Worth a try, and i'd have another. Kind of reminds me of Rogue Dead Guy Ale for some reason."
"indeed, rich copper color with a foamy vanilla head that left a nice thick lace in my glass. this baby is INSANELY DRINKABLE, and a total pleasure on a hot hot afternoon. super smooth, just enough bitter hoppy character to keep it interesting, clean, and crisp. nice malt notes that stay light, not syrupy at all. a really *$*%&$! good beer, censored for a reason. cheers!"
"Decent drinkability overall as an IPA, as a strong ale falls short compared to others out there. Decent flavor with lots of hops, and goes down really easy. This is a decent beer, but falls short within the style."
"D - a little disappointed in this beer. After it warms up, you start to get some of the hop flavor/aromas, but the malt content, which clearly must be substantial given the alcohol, is MIA."
"A very fiesty sopperyt, orange peel hue with lots of bubbling and plenty of lacing left over from each sip. Looks more like a red ale than an American Strong Ale. Lots of citrus in the nose along with an aftermath of roasty, toasty malts. A little hint of grapefruit and mimosa like like tendencies were noticed in the almost avergare palate."
"Another nice brew from Lagunitas."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice copper with a decent head shrinking to nothing, really nice lacing. Aroma is pretty decent, piney hops are aplenty, a little buttery, some malt, kind of eh to me. Taste is better, some decent hopping, though I'm just not getting excited about this beer, though its a good drinker. I don't know what to make of it."
"Somewhat copper colored beer topped by a thinish cream-colored head. Fantastic malt aroma has notes of brown sugar and caramel accented by a bit of spicy hops. Unfortunately, the flavor doesn't follow the aroma too well. Some hops bitterness is quickly followed by an alcoholic kick which brings wisps of medicinal and metallic notes for the finish. A slight sweet note slips through every once in a while. Mouthfeel is rather thin for a moderate ABV beer. Drinkability - glad I bought just one, and this one will last for a while on my desk tonight."
"Drinkability is a plus for a brew with a higher alcohol."
"Pours copper to light gold in color and clear with an off white head. Aroma is sweet malts, there is a little honey grapiness, and rich date smell, a swirl also produces a lemon aroma. Taste is nice sugary maltiness, cereal, a little yeasty with a little lemon and honey. Beer finishes with a slightly dry grassy hoppiness. Nice medium and slightly chewy body from the malts. I was a little lost at times as to what this beer was trying to be, but it was fairly drinkable, and the large malt bill was enjoyable."
"Taste is balanced between appley yeast, grassy hops, caramel malt, and alcohol. Everything is restrained, by Lagunitas' standards, except the alcohol. Alcohol and slightly minty grassiness in the finish. Tasty and drinkable, for the style."
"Drinkability: Like I said before it wasn't too strong and it wasn't too mild either, it was just a nice balanced beer. It's something I will drink again in the near future. This was my first Lagunitas beer and after this one, I will be sure to try more from this fine brewery!"
"A fairly drinkable beer. I had three, and that was probably enough. It has a rich flavor, and full-bodied feel to it. I'd drink it again."
"Much more drinkable than some of their other stuff but I've yet to be too impressed by any of it. This is a big, beefed-up ""So-Cal"" amber and it does what it's trying to do fairly well."
"ps: my daughter loves the dog"
"This beer has a color that reminds me of iced tea...clear light copper with a thin white head that has stuck around for a while. Sweet malt scent with some fruity aromas mixed in as well as light hops. I get some raisin as it warms. The taste starts sweet with caramel, toffee, and fruit (apples, green grapes, raisins?) but then you get the bitterness and floral qualities from the hops. Dry and chalky finish. Medium body with a little alcohol tinge present. I am glad I picked it up and tried it, but I won't go out of my way to get it again."
"D- This beer is smooth and light which makes it pretty drinkable but not to complex."
"I could have a few of these and discover something new each time. Very drinkable and overall a great beer."
"Not a bad beer, I'm not crazy about it, but it would be a very nice session ale."
"Bottle from Sammy: Poured a deep copper color ale with small off-white foamy head with average retention. Aroma of deep caramel malt with some very subtle hops. Taste is also dominated by sweet caramel malt with very little hops presence that I could detect. Body is a bit thin and alcohol is well hidden. A bit weak overall and definitely lacking character to make this worthwhile."
"drinkabilty: above average"
"The taste is a bit of a smack in the mouth, which I think would be better suited to a fall or winter release. A bit heavy for the spring and early summer. At least thats how my taste buds react to it. Maybe a further review in the fall would make me think differently?"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a creamy and smooth medium body. The beer is pretty dam drinkable overall. I enjoyed this beer alot and will have it on another occasion."
"D- Very unique. Sweet at times, bitter st times, but balanced enough to not let one or the other take over. Worth a try no doubt, but probably wont be stocking my frdige with it."
"I wish the smell had more for me but the taste and mouthfeel make it worthwhile."
"I really like this brew - not sure what a copper ale is but for such a strong ABV it is pretty tame - kind of dangerous actually - smooth and slightly caramel - you don't much notice until the tang at the end. Like other copper ales I have tried it is kinda of like an old house's tap water but without the deadly metals...both Lagunitas brews I have tried are excellent."
"This is nearly 8%? I can't tell... The aftertaste is the only thing that's keeping me from giving the drinkability a 5. Very smooth, not too heavy, and the alcohol is high, but I really can't tell from the taste. This is one of the better beers I've tried. Would definitely recommend to anyone.."
"Drinability - of course! lots of it. it was great!"
"D - This one could be an everyday drinker if it wasn't for the 7.7% ABV. Very smooth and easy to drink."
"This one pours with a very pretty amber color, quite clear, with little head. Aroma is a bit hoppy, with some apple esters and malt spiciness that adds up to a slightly ciderish character. A touch of bitterness up front, with smooth malts taking over before the hops kick in. The mid-palate has a bit of nickel, and the finish is bitter and grainy. All of this is pulled off with tremendous smoothness, especially for a beer with this much alcohol and hop character. Quite a nice sessionish, high alcohol brew."
"Nice hazy copper color. Off white head that is thin and disappears quick. Seemingly bursting with juicy hop aroma, piney, citrusy and floral. Very nice caramel like flavor, which seems to fit well, as it is not overwhelming but very flavorful. Hops seemed restrained compared to the aroma, however some piney flavors shine through. Low carbonation and medium in body. This is very enjoyable. Great malt flavor that stops short of being cloying, along with a great hop aroma and just anough bitterness to keep things in check. Very nice work."
"The beer poured into a pint glass a nice copper color, obviously that's why Lagunitas calls it a rich copper ale. It also has an amber color to it when I hold it up to a light. Not much head to it at all, though. Smells a little hoppy for the most part. It has the floral/hoppy taste at first, but then it has a sweet caramel aftertaste to it. I wasn't expecting that at all. It's on the thin side, with a bit of oilyness as well. It does go down easy. It's a decent beer, although it's not something I would drink all the time (but I would drink it again). However, it is good enough for me to want to try other Lagunitas beers, since this is the first beer of theirs I've tried."
"Randomly spotted this one on the shelf the other day and probably wouldn't have noticed it except for the post I read regarding the infamous title of this beer. First impression is wow this could be my new session beer, second impression holy sh!t 7.7% where did they hide it. Appearance is a dark copper with an easy inch of foamy white head, not much in the smell department. Taste and mouthfeel are both great with this one , super malty and smooth, I could probably drink a six pack in an afternoon while watching the red sox."
"Big malt bomb! Toffee, big and buttery toasted bread. Great hop balance. Long long finish. Would be a great session beer if not for the alcohol."
"Ah, the copper ale that got everyone's panties in a bunch up in Petaluma. Let's see if it was worth the hassle. Pours a nice amber-copper color, clearish, with a thick, rocky, slightly yellow head that tells me a lot of malt went into this beer. Alrighty. Smell is cool, jelly-bean-sweet, and a little American hoppy. Kind of a typical amber ale taste, with a slightly sweet body, moderate bitterness, and stiff dose of hop flavor... still, very well done over all. Light toasty flavors start the sip and are followed up by clean citrusy hops; body is solid but not heavy. This is not one of those bash-you-over-the-head Lagunitas beers; they're going for drinkability here, and they've done it. Surprisingly sippable for nearly 8% abv. I'd better not have 2, but I'd like to."
"Copper with large creamy head and lace in glass. Noticeably hoppy aroma, with sweetness: toffee, maybe sugar. Body is thinish. Hoppy taste with grapefruit at finish and drying aftertaste. Not offensive, but unsatisfying a I find Irish style oft to be, and in this you get hit with a lot of alcohol, limiting consumption of further beer."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I'm not sure I agree with the ASA classification though. To me, this seems like an Amber. Not that it matters much."
"Drinkability: A strong attribute of this beer. Goes down easy, and supplies a lot of flavor. Lives up to the billing of ""rich."" I'm pretty pleased with the experience."
"Pours a deep but clear copper red with a finer of off-white head that quickly subsides to a spotty cap, leaving some scattered lacing behind. Nose is subdued but nice, a caramel and nutty malt with a spicy hop note. Taste is a nice bready and yeasty malt, light caramel, some spicey hops, and finishes with a lingering sweetness and a slight hint of alcohol. Pretty nice tasting beer, a little on the thin side though, but overall very drinkable."
"Not the best Lagunitas product. Not very complex and doesnt have the same hoppy kick as other strong ales I have had, quite mild and easily drinkable though. Possibly would buy again, but Id stick with the stronger hopped American strong ales."
"A solid beer from Lagunitas."
"So, this used to be called The Kronic and the authorities complained? Or what?"
"Censored is an allright beer. It's defineitely worth a try, but not my first pick on the shelves. I tried this before at the KROQ Microbrew Fest at Santa Anita Race Track and seemed to like it a little more."
"This beer is so drinkable, I think it can really sneak up on you if you aren't paying attention. Nice good solid beer. Very enjoyable."
"I've yet to find a Lagunitas that I dont like.... they're all fantastic!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. This was my first beer by Lagunitas Brewing Co. & it was a pleasant experience. I found it had a good amount of malty sweetness along with a nice hoppy finish which lent to a well balanced beer. A wonderful copper color, as well. I would definitely buy this beer again, & would also be interested in some of the other Lagunitas beers."
"Too heavy on the wheat/grain character for the style. Not a great effort stylistically; a bit of a disappointment for the hype."
"Nice full body, well balanced with a smooth and tingley cream texture that lingers on the tongue. This is a fairly strong brew that goes down too easily. Wish I'd bought the whole sixer of this one, good stuff !"
"Received in BCG BIF from Zorro."
"My pint of The Kronic poured a deep copper with a suitable head. I have been meaning to try this beer for a while now and once I saw it on draught, I just couldn't resist. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. I could not smell much of anything, and there definitely was no discrenable hop smell. Even worse, it tasted sickeningly sweet. It truly tasted like a pack of starburst. There was nothing to balance out the sweetness upfront, and until the slight hop bite as it went down, it was horribly unbalanced. The alcohol was well-hidden only because of the excessive sweetness. I just simply did not enjoy this brew."
"All in all, a good, but average, brew. While I found the taste pleasing, it was not very complex either. I'd take either of Stone's offerings (Arrogant or Double Bastard) over this any day. However, this is a solid brew that I would happily drink again (and I shall, seeing as how I have 5 left from the 6er)."
"Drinkability is not hindered by the alcohol content, as it is almost unnoticeable."
"This pours a clear reddish amber with foamy tan one finger head. The smell is very pronounced with a real ""bisquity"" aroma. Like walking into a bakery. The taste is very sweet,carmel or toffee?, and malty. This does not have the super sweetness that some of the strong ales have,this is very drinkable. The m/f is light and the alcohol is very subdued which is nice from a high alcohol beer. This is a very tasty brew and I highly recommend it."
"I have to admit I spent some time trying to figure out what the word was behind the black bar. Dark copper color with a thick light orange/beige head. Thin lacing. Aroma of strong malt and subtle fruit. Medium-bodied and balanced nicely between sweet malt and citrus fruit. Light touch of pine as well. The finish is mildly bitter and lasting. Above average."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Easy to drink but slightly out of balance in the mouth, with a wavering carbonation that leaves room for improvement. Medium weight, and the ABV does not interfere with the experience IMO... a decent ASA, a surprise to find it here in NY/NJ."
"D - This beer is one freakishly drinkable beast. The alcohol content is up there, but not readily discernible, and the body of this beer is tasty without being heavy in any sense of the word. Too easy to suck down. Beware. It's a shame that it looks blah and smells only OK."
"Very oily, almost luxurious on the tong. The drinkability is a detriment in this case. I want to feel a bit of warmth or spice from the alcohol, with, if this is possible, is too understated."
"I had no idea this one was no where near 8% abv. Appearance: Ruby copper hue nice tan head leaves fine even lacing down my glass. Aroma: Hops contain a bit of everything pine, earthiness, grassy, floral, and a touch of underlying citrus sweet caramel malts touch of alcohol. Taste: Bready caramel malts doesn't come off too sweet blends nicely with the loads of hop flavor and solid bitterness presented definitely a welcomed brewery to the Pittsburgh market. Hop flavors that standout earthy, piney, and grassy for sure. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied evenly carbonated smooth ale low on hop oils pretty clean. Drinkability: Tasty hoppy ale that I will invite back anytime I see it especially if I ever catch it on draft gotta love the Kronic."
"Way Way to easy to down this sucker with this ABV... but at the same time it didn't do anything for me that made me ""have"" to have another... I would not go out of my way for it but wouldn't turn it down (kind of like the semi fat chick at the frat party at 3am)"
"Great session choice except for the price ($7.99 on sale)"
"This beer pours a golden copper color with a smaller off white head which maintained itself nicely. Lacing is slight. Aroma is bready and fruity with notes of apricot and herbal hop notes. Taste is caramelly and bready at the base. Fruit and grassy flavors on top. Finish is slightly piney and a bit warming. All in all a decent, above average offering, but nothing great. Cool name though."
"This is a nice beer that hits you with hops right off the bat. The color is a nice partially cloudy reddish/gold color with a small head. The aroma is sweet and floral, very pleasant. Nice hops with a touch of malt, and a lingering hop influenced aftertaste. I can't help but pick the slightest metallic twinge in the flavor and aftertaste, not sure where that could be coming from. Not a bad strong ale at all, definitely worth revisiting but probably not distinguishable enough to stand in the upper echelon of style."
"12 oz. stubby bottle. Extremely hazy glowing peach, topped with a frothy ivory head. Nose is ripe with caramel malt, peach and hops. Very estery up front, and quite slick and viscous. Delicious notes of tangy plums and grapes, just a hint of citrus, apple and honey and topped off with sappy, piney hops. Alcohol hides well. Strangely reminiscent of HopDevil...though this is sweeter and maltier, while being much less hoppy. Nonetheless, very nicely balanced and quite enjoyable. Thanks to BeerBeing for this guy."
"Pours a hazy deep copper color, some carbonation, small head, nice lacing though. Scents of malt, hops, fruits, and some caramel. Nice taste, kinda sweet, dry finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, but to call this a ASA is a bit to far I think. It's a nice brew, alcohol hidden very well, but not sure if I'll buy again."
"A very nice West Coast amber style ale. I could drink plenty of this were it available here. Recommended. Kinda like a better, nuttier version of Dead Guy Ale."
"Note: 7.7% abv version."
"Notes: Solid offering from Lagunitas. With all the talk about what beers would go good with thanksgiving, I would have to say this one could work just fine. Versatile and not overpowering at least in feel."
"Copperish amber with a small, soapy off-white head. Aromas of light caramel malt, with mild ripe orange and apricot hoppiness. Fleeting flowery apricot in the nose, then a husky, toffee malt body with hints of orange pekoe tea. Carbonation is medium to low with a fine, supple mouthfeel. Nice long finish with a mild ripe citrus bitterness. Overall, a very drinkable (dangerously so considering the abv) ale that isn't too far outside the box but doesn't fit any style perfectly. Very good, and a pleasant surprise for me."
"Pours a clear copper colour, with white lace, good retention. Aroma of caramel, toffee, sweet malt and some fruitiness. Very pleasant, smooth beer. Lightly hopped and very refreshing. The fine bubbles tingle you palate. Finishes dry and flavourful. Another great beer from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability is OK but I really expected a more outstanding beer. Worth a try but the hairy eyeball tastes better."
"Good enough to drink more than one, but I wouldnt go out searching for one."
"Color is caramel brown in the top 2/3 of glass that tapers into an amber bottom third. Nice head of 2-3 mm with some spider-web lacing appearing along the sides of my glass. A very neutral malty smell. Some hints of fruitiness are apparent. A good upfront maltiness on the tongue with some piney-citrussy hop kick. Pleasantly coating mouthfeel with a nice velvet-like character. A smooth beer but there are other Lagunitas that are more drinkable."
"Upon pour, there was great color and clarity. It had a nice golden color with a hint of red. The head on it was pretty good. The smell was rich with honey, hops and little citrusy. The flavor lingers for a while. I would recommend this beer on a warm summer day out by the pool. It is very refreshing and full-bodied."
"Im not sure why I didnt like this one as much the first time but maybe I drank it too cold. Thats all I can figure. That was my bad. Bad me."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) in July 2005 and consumed a couple days later. Poours a half-finger nearly white head over a crystal clear copper rust liquid. Smells of caramel and toffee with some sugar and esters yummy that is very enticing. There is some citrusy hop character that comes across as oranges to me. Taste starts toasted malt sweet with caramel, honey and a hint of toffee. Oh yummy. Mild fruity esters rise to mingle with the malt in the middle of the taste and then these settle as a light tang steps in as part of the aftertaste. The tang has a really nice orange zest flavor...no pith, just the thinest of the zest. There may be some hop bitter with the tang but the settle quickly as fruity esters (apricot and pear) rise up my throat to leave a wet sweet in my mouth. Fine carbonation still forms on my tongue to fight the thick body. It's mildy carbonated and very refreshing."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slow fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It has a toasted scent with a wonderful hop aroma. It's well balanced. The taste is good also. It has a malty base provide by pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It goes down easy with a very bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's solid on all fronts as well as being highly drinkable for having an elevated abv. ."
"This is a copper gold beer with a big head. The nose was a brewery smell which I love. This was a malty beer with an incredibly drinkable profile. Not overly hopped this is quite a soft touch for such an aggresive name. Unlike Snoop I didn't have to back off on it."
"Notes: I think this is a nice balance of body and malt. The hops are just right and its highly drinkable. I like it."
"This was interesting, if nothing else. The high ABV , creamy mouthfell and supringly heavy body would makes this a brew worthy of a cool winter night. I'd love to try it with my smoky bacon and potato chowder."
"Not terribly impressed with this one, but it isn't awful, though I really doubt I could stomach another one in rapid succession. Have to wonder if this is a bad bottle. It just seems way too sweet to have been intentional."
"Pours a cream, one finger-head that goes slowly leaving a decent lace. Nice clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is slightly hoppy. Starts with a mix of hops and malt, finish has a hoppy/soapy edge. Some bitter aftertaste but not bad. $1.60 for a 12oz from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Turns slightly herbal (savory) in the aroma and initial taste as it warms. Remains balanced with a pungent but backdropped hoppiness. Finishes mildly hoppier, sprucy and with a mellow dryness. Another great bomber from the one-off specialists."
"A sweet caramel and doughy malt taste soon gives way to an edgy citrus and slightly metallic hop bite. As it warms, the flavors begin to meld into a more balanced, smooth mix. A warming alcohol is noticed in the brain before it begins to encroach on the breath. This can be a dangerous thing if you're not careful!"
"The most noticable was the never-ending rolling stream of upward and falling carbonation as tiny bubbles. This dance was backdropped by a beautiful bright, clear copper-amber brew mounting a creamy off-white head of little height slipping to a soft covering. With each sip a sticky lace remained. I expected less from this beer but found it drinks as pleasing as it did on draught with a slightly different finish. The nose was smalll with malts and floral hops. The body was a medium feel with good length and a nice balance of malts and soft hops. The finish was dry with a delicate hop bitter which remained in memory. As I reread this review I must say the alcohol was well hidden until I began to write. Enjoy..."
"I'm not really sure why this one isn't called The Kronic anymore, I think it's a much cooler name than ""censored," but I suppose it's a minor issue. I was also kind of surprised that this one wasn't a hop bomb like many other west coast beers. A well balanced and enjoyable strong."
"Drinkbaility and Overall: This beer is ok, but not great. A little dissapointing when held against the the other stuff from Lagunita's I've had. This is a fun beer at best, but definitly not one to search for."
"My first impression of this beer is, of course, what's beneath the ""Censored"". The Kronic huh? It's ridiculous that has to be censored. Anyway, another story for another time. As far as the beer itself goes, the presentation is awesome. The head is substantial, fluffy, off-white, and very consistent. The body is a beauty as well, amber with an orange haze to it. The nose is sugary with hints of a caramel presence. The mouthfeel strikes me as clean and wholesome. Overall the maltiness is prevalent, but there is some nuttiness lingering and its quite juicy really. The finish stays sweet and is a little more grainy. I suspect a hint of apple preceding a mouth coating dosage of subtle caramel sweetness. It's a pretty good brew."
"This brew didnt wow me, but is was solid and could be a nice session brew."
"Clear and light chestnut, some carbonation seen rising with just a tad of khaki head in a dusting and thick ring. Caramelly, molassess, buttery and sugar... Very nice and heavy/thick/chewy aroma. Very full mouthfeel. Smooth and sikly, the carbonation is just barely noticeable, just feels like it gently comes to life in your mouth with touch of foam. Bite of hoppy pepperyness with a bit of caramel malt flavor, nice darkened toast taste with grapefruit rind. Flavors are left in your mouth at the end of the sip for a good while. Catching a bit of fruityness -bit of orange peel -maybe clementines- in the flavor. Very drinkable, nice session, a lot of good flavor and feel without being too intense too compete with a good meal."
"Nah, this beer didn't do it for me. Pours a beautiful mahogany brown, but my first taste was somewhat sour. Notable hops, but very little else to recommend. A very drinkable beer, this would be a decent session brew, but its limited complexity has me looking elswhere for my weekend six-pack..."
"Interesting bottle with the word censored written across the front blocking something out. Poured out a cloudy copper with a cream colored head. A bubbly webbing of lace was left around the glass. Caramel malt with some earthy hops made up most of the nose. A bit of doughy malt but mostly sweetness. Taste was similar with a strong sweet caramel being the main component. Some earthy spicy hops are lurking in the back as well as biscuit and some roastiness. A bit too much sweetness in my opinion. Medium and smooth this goes down easily and is tasty enough I would have had another. Something interesting enough I would try again."
"Drinkability- Sorry, but I didn't much care for this one. The sweetness just made it a bit hard for me to take."
"Pours a lightly hazy ruby copper color, that is topped by a light brown one finger thick head that. The aroma is thick with crystal malt, a bit of candy sweetness, toasted malts and a hint of herbal, perhaps spicy hops. The taste is sweet up front, and stays that way as it finishes with a heavy handed crystal malt caramel notes. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish that helps to balance this malt dominated brew. This beer has a medium full body contributed by the malt. The biggest problem with this beer is that it is a bit simplistic, though admittedly this is a pretty weak problem. This beer is pretty straight forward, and I almost think that a beer with this many malt & caramel notes would more fittingly be a low alcohol session brew."
"This could pass for an IPA any day of the week, appearance, aroma, and tast all fit the bill. Mouthfeel is really nice, a medium body brew with an ideal amount of fizz. This is a good beer, despite the higher ABV, I would drink this a plenty, would go well shooting pool and other drug lordz, yo. Lagunitas reprazent!"
"If this wasn't 7.7% abv it would make very excellent session beer as it is oh so easy to drink."
"The beer is smooth with a slightly thick mouthfeel. A hoppy flavor of pine and grapefruit begins each sip. Some caramel malt is hidden in the background and a hint of alcohol with a dry finish is found at the end leaving some citrus and alcohol notes behind."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear amber brew. Head lasts reasonably well, but shows minimal lacing. Aroma is deeply of malts husks, with some light hops presence. Taste follows the nose to a T, with the solid grain husks giving way to a slight sourness, and then quickly switching a slight hops crispness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, especially for such a strong abv brew. Check this one out."
"This is a pretty sexy looking ale, a chill-hazed fruity copper which increases in chroma from the bottom of the glass to the top. Quick, someone take a picture! The head is thin and off-white however, poor retention. The aroma is rich and full, caramel and toasted malts, dates and currents, some citrus along with a full boquet of hops, it all blends and balances out so nicely. The flavour is not as action packed in the beginning, subdued malt and dried fruit, carried along by a full mouthfeel, the alcohol can be felt but not tasted as much. Things pick up towards the end, everything slowly surfaces at once, sweet buttery malt, meaty dried fruit, with citrusy hops that go herbal on the aftertaste. Very drinkable for a strong ale, smooth mouthfeel, light flavour. But it loses me in the flavour department a bit, is lacking in more character to make it memorable, to leave an impression. A wallflower when it should be out there breakdancing, it has all the right moves, it just doesn't utilize them to their fullest. If it were less shy this would be an excellent strong ale. Perhaps the ganja has mellowed it out a little too much."
"slightly hazy copper with a thin tan head. fuity hop smelling with a significant amount of maltiness as well, caramlel and toffee, and a little bit of yeasty biscuit. very well balanced with a good amount of maltiness to back up the citric hops. the caramel comes through with a slight amount of fig and brown sugar to back it up. it has a well carbonated medium body. very drinkable, lots of flavors, none over powering, it would be easy to sip these all night."
"Medium bodied. The mouthfeel is smooth and the aftertaste has caramel and pine lasting briefly. Extremely drinkable and enjoyable."
"A great beer from out west. I've recently noticed this company more and more out here in Mass, I think they must be doing well for themselves. The Moan and Dove seems to frequently have a keg of theirs on tap and the better beer stores around here seem to have a lot of their sixers now, which they didn't about 6 months ago. I'm glad, because I like this stuff. Pours a nice dark ""rich copper"" color, as suggested on the label, with a little tan bubbly head. Smell is great, and complex. Swirls of sweet carmely malts and fruity piney hops combine here to create a great scent. The taste just screams balance. Malty up front with notes of carmel, vanilla, other sweetness, followed by a great bitter hop ass kicking. Fruity and floral like a pale ale too. Smooth even mouthfeel and super easy and pleasureful to put back. I'll definately be getting this stuff again. What a great beer."
"This is a top notch session beer. Pours a dark copper color with amber hints. The head is off beat tan with great retention. The smell is of lemons and pine, the caramel malts seem well done, the flavors intertwine into a great symphony. The taste is exceptional, with every taste you will pick up flavors. The floral/citrus hops in the taste get attacked right away by deep roasted caramel malts. The flavors are perfect. Perhaps my favorite session beer, goes good with meats."
"burnt sienna in color with very little head, disapeared so quickly i couldn't even tell you what color it was, from the tiny bit floating on top i would guess white like soap bubbles. pungent, almost pumpkin-ish smell. i dont think pumpkin is right, but i cant place the smell even though i just sniffed it for a good 5 minutes trying to figure out what it reminded me of. when i asked my dad, he said beer. Uber-smooth with malty caramel taste. dont expect a typical lagunitas hop punch with this one. no pumpkin taste, but i cant match that smell up with any of the tastes in there. did i read this had 7% alcohol? cant tate it. as it warms up slight chocolate taste hints through. very smooth, almost no carbonation, but blends well. very drinkable for a bigger beer. almost dangerously so, but not complex enough to make you want to come back for a second one right away in an attempt to understand it."
"Like the bottle says pours a rich copper color with an slightly off white head that sticks around for quite awhile I was also suprised by the higher carbonation level wich I wasn expecting.Wow alot of difeerent melding aromas going on somecaramel and butter toffee with a nice underlying piney hop that made this very delectable on the nose.The taste is big and sweet up front but man do the hops come in to dry this out just enough to make a perfect balance,caramel and roasted nuts turn into pine and grapefruit in the finish.Now this was a joy to drink complex and flavorful,I will buy again in the future."
"Deep amber to copper color (I know its known as a copper ale, but to me this was more amber). Thick, dense off white head leaves a light sheet of lace as I drink the beer. The aroma has a great fruity hop aroma, grapefruit and maybe just a hint of pine. The hops share aroma with some of the malt character, maybe ribbon candy or figs. Nice malt aroma. The taste has more malt up front than I expected. A rich character that I would associate more with a dark lager than an ale. Very pleasing with a thick mouth feel. The hops show up on the finish with a cleansing bitterness that leaves you wanting more. This is a very interesting beer. I was expecting more hops, but am surprised and impressed by the depth and strength of the malt in this beer."
"Notes: The nose is better than the taste with this brew."
"This beer comes courtesy of clvand0. The beer pours a deep amber color with a coat of head over the beer. The nose is caramel. orange with hints of biscuit and some hop bitters in there. The flavor is full on caramel, with a nice hop to balance it out on the finish. Not bad at all. The feel is moderate, and smooth with a light carb that makes things flow nicely. The drinkability is fantastic on this beer. Its easy drinking and well balanced. More of the biscuit comes through as it warms, but it still has a nice balance. Good beer."
"Tried my first bottle of this last night. It's somewhat of a treat because we can't get Lagunitas in KY. I like the idea behind the name. Pours a slightly dark amber color with a tall white head with excellent retention and leaves tons of lumpy lacing on the glass. I actually couldn't just rinse the lace off after drinking, had to actually wipe it. The aroma had caramel malts with some citrus and pine hops. Very pleasing aroma. The flavor has a very strong caramel backbone, but it is not overpowering. The hops come through well - citrus and pine mostly. This is exceptionally balanced. The mouthfeel is very good as it has a very thick body - I respect a copper ale that's not thin. Drinkability is great as well. I must say, this is one of the best amber/copper ales I've had."
"Drinkability: I used to like this a lot more than I do now. Just too sweet for me."
"Overall, an interesting beer. It's different from anything else I've had. I'm not quite sure if I really like it or not."
"Very well balanced, overall, and dangerously drinkable. The abv is cleverly disguised. An excellent American strong ale."
"Censored initially struck me as somewhat of a letdown. Once I recalibrated, however, I was able to appreciate it for what it is; namely, a drinkable strong ale that is unthreatening enough for all comers to enjoy. It is coming into its own with warming and I'm enjoying the bottom half of the bottle more than the top half. Or maybe it's the 7.7% ABV talking."
"Bottle. A bit too tinny for me. The hops are there and all that, piney grapefruity flavour, rusty bitterness, not round enough, edgey in flavour. Had the same characters as all the other Lagunitas beers i had. Different ingredients of course, but still this rough rusted tin edge comes through, as it does their other beers."
"Drank some of this controversial brew whilst visiting my brother in Palo Alto. Pours a medium golden copper with a dense off-white head. Smells of rich, caramelly malt, candy sugar, and quick, sharp hops. Taste starts off with chewy, caramel malt with some fruity/bready notes. Spicy hops kick in and are plenty bitter. Alcoholic and warming--almost medicinal. A tad too alcoholic tasting, otherwise a solid strong ale."
"Another nice beer from Lagunitas..they may not do fantastic beers , but they do good beers consistently."
"12 ounce bottle, w/o freshness dating. Pours a rich orangy amber. Not much head/carbonation. White bubble film is moderatly long lasting and just a touch of lacing is left behind. Oakey,whiskey nose. This is a malty strong ale. Well developed malty base, mellow hops well in the background. Finishes with a crisp and refreshing snap of more malt and a touch of alcohol warmth. Could use some more hop crunch IMHO."
"This copper colored brew poured a nice head that left a residual stickiness on my pint. Smell was nothing remarkable. The taste was good. I was shocked to see how high the ABV was. I figured it would have been in the mid 5's range. Mouthfeel was nice, simewhat full for a copper and definitely lively on the palate. Overall drinkability is good. This brew was crafted very well!"
"My lord, this is a scary ass tasty beer. I am stunned that the ratings are not higher because it is awesome!!! Pours a beautiful copper color. Rich malty aroma with an orange twang. Lightly sweet malty flavor with some grainy edginess and citric hops to balance. Rich and full body. You would never guess the alcohol contentno wonder they call it the Kronic. Fabulous!"
"Slightly hazed copper tone. Thin off white head. Lace comes in not so frequent rings. Aroma is sweet and malty. A little bready as well. The first thing I notice on the palate is a nice caramel malt base. Sweet and malty. The hops balance, but really don't add a lot of flavor or bitterness. Maybe there's a shimmer of spiciness coming from them. The alcohol is hidden well. The body is damn near full and the mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Pretty solid Amber overall. I would drop $8 for a six pack of this every now and then if it was available here."
"All in all, a bit of a rough beer -- but not bad if you're a consenting adult and into that sort of thing."
"A rich copper with good head and lace. Aroma of brown sugar and caramel. The beer begins with sweet malts, with quite a lot of brown sugar flavor, some maple syrup. A very slight roastiness and smokiness is apparent, but it is way down, deep down in there. The hops come along, with bright pine flavors to keep the beer from being too sweet. The alcohol mostly invisible, flavorwise, but there is definitely some spiciness happening here. The yeast adds a rich, buttery element that works nicely with the malts. Mouthfeel is smooth and full, with a slight prickliness. This is a fine, healthy brew, but like Lagunitas' other strong beers, I have to question why this has so much alcohol. To my tastes, it only serves to mask the flavor somewhat. It's like a blurry lens over the beer. Otherwise, this is a good, rich tasting red ale with an interesting and pleasing amount of hoppiness. I suppose one could give this strong beer good scores for drinkability, but I have chosen not to because I found the first sip to be the best-tasting, and each subsequent sip not quite as good."
"The Kronic (did that REALLY have to be censored, guys?) is something of a paradox--it's a simultaniously a success and a failure. They've succeeded in making a remarkably mild, middle-of-the-road, high ABV amber--you'd swear it was just another pale ale. However, it's just another pale ale; they've done nothing interesting or novel with all the malt and alcohol. My thinking is that if you're going big, go all the way. Nice, but not special."
"Picked up a sixer of this last weekend and shared it with a couple of friends after a local 10K race. I liked it so much initialy, I went back and got a 6-er for myself to conduct a thorough eval. Poured a glorious coppery color into my chalice with about 2 1/2 fingers of fluffy cloud-like head which took several minutes to dissipate, leaving a nice lacing on the glass. Smell was fresh bread/caramel, with a hint of fruity banana. I tried to find some of the 7.7% ABV, but it just wasn't there...Scary! Taste was initially going towards sweet caramel, but the 30 or so I.B.U.'s mellowed the sweetness to a glorious mild bitterness. I must admit, I am a hophead who loves it bitter, but this was a very smooth, drinkable, ever so tastey offering from Lagunitas! Mouthfeel was just right, with a mild carbonation and creamy, buttery smooth finish. Tastes like it would be a great session beer, but the 7.7% is there, so be forewarned. I love Lagunitas!!"
"This is one that I have been wanting to try for awhile and I just got around to it. The beer poured a nice burnt orange/copper color with a decent white head that settled into a small layer of head that left great spider web lace down the glass. The smell did not impress that much, with a pretty earthy malt scent and not much else. The taste is quite simple with a great malt profile, not much in the way of hops but the malt is not overly sweet so it tends to balance out. Slight carmel notes in the flavor as well. The mouthfeel is excelent on this one though, very smoothe and crisp and very drinkable. The 7.7% cannot be tasted at all but can for sure be felt so I think this one would make a very good session beer by flavor but the session would not last that long! Good stuff though."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Notes: I love Lagunitas!"
"Note: This one is complex and balanced and hides it's abv very well. One might mistake this for a session beer, but that could turn into a dangerous one. Very good beer! Cheers!"
"Pours a coppery red with a warm glow. Ample off-white head leaves nice rings of lace down the glass. The aroma is well balanced, with an abundance of caramel notes asserting itself slightly more than the grapefruit-rind character of the hops. The favor is delectable. ""Smooth"" hardly begins to describe the silken, buttery quality of the malts. The hops comprise the middle with a piney/citrusy attitude before a decidedly candy-sweet finish that makes me long for the next sip. Mouthfeel is complex and rich without much carbonation to get in the way of a true thrill ride for your senses. Drinkability is fine overall, though the high ABV makes it more of a treat. A delightful beer."
"It pours a clear copper with a small off-white head that quicly becomes a film. Aroma is sweet up front with notes of maple syrup, honey and a low hop profile. Rather simple overall.. Honeyish palate with more maple and bitter grassy hops. Slight flower hints and more brown sugar in the finish. Medium creamy body. I don't quite understand the purpose of this beer? besides hiding it's alcohol that is. Is that really only 29 IBUs too? Cheers to Rodolito for all those questions!"
"Aftertaste is a simmering sizzle of hops and some lingering alcohol heat."
"Poured a nice color from the bottle, with a healthy dose of carbonation. The smell is full of malt and sugar. The first sip was very appealing, but then subsequent sips hit me as a little over-the-top on the flavor. That's a good flavor, mind you, there's just a lot of it in there! I don't think I'd have more than one or two in a sitting."
"This brew is a dark reddish/copper colour with a tight head, of snowy white foam. The aromas are subtle, but chock full of german-style malts and hops. The taste is robust and satisfying. Starting with a sweet maltiness up front, and ending with some hops on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is a bit chewy and nice and the drinkability is excellent for a beer of this size. This is an 8% amber, that drinks like a 4% one!"
"Pours an amber-copper hue with a light, off white head that settles quickly. Smell is much more bold than I would have though. Very sweet and caramelly malty. Smells highly of alcohol. Beer is thick, and definitely was sweet, but i dont think it holds up to the smell. Less bold than I predicted. The ops are subdoed, but come poking out arbitrarily in the flavor, making for an overall nice herterogenous mixture. Taste is finished off by a grapefruit like, citric acidity, which I dont believe fits very well with the rest of the beer. Overall, I'm quite pleased, but mostly with the smell."
"You wouldn't guess the Kronic has a 7.7% ABV - it's very well disguised. As such, it's a dangerously drinkable brew but not one I'd use as a session beer. Not a real complex beer but still possessing enough vitality and diversity of flavors to warrant giving it a try."
"Notes: Tasty, to be sure, but the flavor profile is a tad ho-hum, in my opinion, to warrant a 7.7% ABV."
"Drinkablilty: Overall, nice. Would be a great ""session"" beer if it had some more body and at least some finish to it. Needs some refinement to truly be an above average brew."
"Drinkability  I could easily get trashed on this stuff. It went down extremely well and failed to warn of the rather hefty ABV."
"I decided to try this one after it beat out some pretty choice beers in a blind taste test a co- worker of mine conducted with himself. I was not completely impressed with the appearance as the head retention was poor and lacing was almost non existent. The deep amber/copper color though was appealing. Aroma was fresh, bready, malty and slightly hoppy. A very nice nose indeed. Smooth did I say smooth taste? very nice and tilted towards the caramel malt with a alanced but back seat hoppiness. Very drinkable and could be one of the top ambers I have had, might have to do my own taste test soon. Suzanne liked it too. Upon trying a second bottle, said sample had a nice head and left good lacing, so I upped it's appearance a bit."
"Dark copper color. Medium to large head. A medium bodied ale, most reminiscent of a amber. Malty and slightly hoppy. The malt sweetness is balanced by a slight hop spiciness. Full flavored. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with a slight residual bitterness. Refreshing. VERY nice beer."
"The brew has a nice copper amber color with a light amount of head that doesn't seem to fade. The smell is lightly hopped and mildly fruity intising you to try it. The taste is slightly fruity but not overpowering. After a couple sips the true undertones in the flavors come out revealing some honey and cherry type flavors (probably also with a bit of caramel). Overall very drinkable and worth checking out."
"Recommended."
"A very enjoyable drink from top to bottom."
"On tap at OBF2003. Rich copper color, billed as a copper at the festival, which differs somewhat from BA. Mild hop aromas, mild flavors, but just enough to keep me curious through the beer. Seems a supreme backyard beer, though uncertain how it would fair during the cooler months."
"I like it very much...big thanks to Gromit!"
"Originally sampled on 1 December 2002. This review is being written from my notes. burnt orange color. I agree w/ beerdedbastard that the nose is like an ice tea mix. It is a hoppy beer but well balanced. The flavor is very smooth and enjoyable. It's a nice brew"
"Brilliantly clear dark copper hue. Covered by a thick, rutted, persistent ivory white head that leaves rough lace. Spicy hops with contrasting soapy citrus hit the nose at first, then are contrasted by medium lovibond caramel malt with a tinge of toffee. Swirling releases mellow, ripe red currant like fruity esters. Pleasant, but not quite unified in aroma. Snap of candyish sweetness initially in flavor is tapered by moderate, well calculated hop bitterness and a slight acidic twang. Pronounced, lingering tang of salty biscuit emerges mid palate along with a mellow floral and citric hop flavor combination. The high apparent attenuation lends a crisp, agreeably smooth mouthfeel that belies the alcohol content. Finishes mostly clean with fleeting bready malt yielding to soft hop bitters. The Kronic is an odd, enjoyable brew. Not complex, but dangerously balanced and well brewed. Easily as drinkable as insipid American ambers of much lower strength. There is absolutely no reason why it has to be almost 8% ABV, though. Gimme a 40 of this in a brown paper sack and I'm good to go..."
"The pour is a slightly cloudy reddish orange with a grandiose head that dissipates to fine sheets of sticky lace that clings mightily to the glass. A nice floral tone up front with malt and a butter like aromas also present, clean and fresh, with a malt sweet start that leads to the middling top. The beer finishes with a planetary hop bite, prickly in its acidity, dry lingering aftertaste. Id call it a ""Hop Heads"" delight and I must say Lagunitas is a fine brewery with a great line of beers that also inhabit my Stable."
"Clear, deep amber-red with copper highlights. Full, foamy cream colored head that has excellent retention and leaves some really nice lace. Very nice lightly fruity, malty and hoppy aroma. It's medium bodied with a soft carbonation that gives it a really nice creaminess in the mouth. There's some lightly fruity, sweetish caramel malt up front (even lightly toasty), becoming creamier and more mellow as it crosses the palate - revealing some nice floral & grassy hop flavor. It finishes with a good blend of sweet malt and light hop flavor amongst a gentle, earthy bitter dryness - (kind of herbal in a way). The alcohol is very well cloaked. This is an exceptionally well balanced and well brewed beer, especially considering its original gravity and strength. Full flavored but not overwhelming as might be expected. It's not complex, but has a rich characeter that's very drinkable. Exceptionally enjoyable."
"This review will be 'censored' free...... The Kronic had a decent head on the pour, but settled rather quickly. There was still a little there, but not enough to even tickle your nose. The Kronic is dark copper in color. The Kronic isn't a very hoppy beer, so hopheads will be disappointed in that, but don't get me wrong....the Kronic is malty and a wonderful tasting beer."
"Pours a nice copper with a white head.  Good hop kick with some nice sweetness underneath.  As the beer warmed, I found some nutty and toasted flavors.  Balanced toward the hoppy side.  A good, solid beer."
"Pours copper, as the name would indicate, with a light brown head.  It has a delicate hop aroma with some metallic smell.  Despite a nice malty background and a nice amount of hops, the metallic taste was just a bit off-putting.  Overall, it's very mellow and drinkable for a beer of its abv."
"(Pulled this bottle out of refrigeration 20minutes prior to drinking.)"
"Deep amber/copper color, 30 IBU 7.7%. It is all hops (citrusy/grapefruit) coming right out of the fridge but as the glass warms it starts to balance out as the caramel malts come through. Nice body to it with good head. Another great one from Lagunitas"
