4.08,-0.7,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"I've had this sitting around for a while and finally decided to crack it open. This red ale pours a true red copper color with a thick and lasting off white head that leaves beautiful silky lacing. The nose is a delicious blend of sweet malts, west coast hops, and spice. The body is rather full with a pleasant carbonation and just the right amount of sticky sweetness. It finishes rather dry for such a malty ale. The flavor is a little different from the nose with a more pronounced spicy, peppery bite and an increased sweetness. This is a very good red. Knowing lagunitas and their love of hops, I want to try this fresh to see if there is a more pronounced hop character. This is very good none the less, just a tad sweet for what I expect from the brewer.","lochef81","May 07, 2014"

4.54,10.5,4,4.25,4.75,4.75,4.5,"Easily one of the best concoctions to come from Lagunitas. The bottle caught my eye amongst the ever growing lineup of 24 oz. craft brews showing up around the supermarkets in California, and the uniqueness of the beer reflected the bottle art. Expecting something like an imperial red IPA, I was pleasantly surprised to find something much more mild and easily drinkable. Amber with tonal red accents would be better to describe the Mondo Large Red here. Only slightly sharp and tangy (or maybe zesty) characteristics, which is surprising considering the ABV. Overall I call the taste unique and perhaps complex - hops that will remind you of a well brewed IPA rather than a red. A nicely palatable fall beer that pairs well with a hearty roast pork loin meal.","LABrewjourneyman","Nov 10, 2013"

Not really dank, after all, but mildly bitter behind sweet nutty malt grains. Notes of caramel and treacle syrup that never become too pronounced. Tastes fresh with a zippy pep of implied spice. Totals out with some fumage from the almost 9% ABV. Dangerously drinkable in its smoothness. Warms the belly, which can't quite catch up to the tongue's warning. Body has some stickiness, but retains a creamy nature that is a big positive for the feel. Carbonation is mostly soft, with some collective sizzle under the lips. Nice beer.

The nose is basically all malt, but the body of the beer showcases the hops. The malt is all but lost until the finish--I found a malty and hoppy aftertaste with this beer. Somewhat dry finish. Kind of an odd beer, I think, but very good. I don't have a lot of points of comparison with this one. It smells like a pale ale, hits like a scotch ale, and finishes with the bitterness of an IPA. In any event, I'm not complaining.","Wukk","Aug 21, 2013"

The initial taste was signature Lagunitas' grapefruit and citrus hops and I knew I was going to enjoy this beer. The flavor had much more depth than the initial hop love. There were notes of caramel and toasted grain malts underneath the tropical fruit, citrus and apricot hop flavors. The taste profile was deep and varied and took my palate on a ride with each sip.

There's sweetness on the front. On the middle. And almost equally (a bit of bitterness from the 76 IBUs is there) on the back. Hits your tongue with an incredibly creamy mouthfeel, and then your mouth just gets covered in glorious red ale goodness. This may be (or is really close to) the best red ale that I've ever had. It has all those sweet "red" flavors you'd expect, but there's a nice, signature Lagunitas hop-bite on the finish. I've heard some describe this beer as drying, but I don't often find any beer as sweet as I find this one to be drying... I guess I'd only go as far as saying it's semi-dry. There's about 9% ABV on this, and the alcohol basically doesn't come through at all. The aftertaste has a very slight warmth or trace of it, but I don't think the average beer drinking would have any idea that this is clocking in at nearly 9%.","Alextricity","Aug 07, 2013"

Being an IPA drinker, I loved the presence of hops. The taste was excellent. Smooth with a nice bitterness to it. The taste leaves you craving more. As you drink, it leaves a nice lacey finish around the glass. Definitely the best amber ale that I have had. It's actually going down a little too smoothly!

Taste again was hops forward that lingered for a bit on the tongue, the malt stepped up right after that for a nice finish that left the mouth clean and without hop bitter. Mouthfeel was clean and after the hops flair, smooth and well rounded. Overall it's a good brew but the hop smack reminds me of most of the Lagunitas offerings...not a bad thing really but I would've liked a tad more malts and sugars peeking out instead. Great price for a bomber and I try any beer at least once, at $4.50 a Bomber how can you say no?","Bear1964","Jul 17, 2013"

Aromas of big orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange rind, floral, pine, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, floral, orange rind, caramel, toast, pine, grass, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, floral, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hoppiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy imperial red ale. All around great balance and complexity of hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected from this brewery.","superspak","Jun 19, 2013"

Fuller body, creamy, and smooth on the palate while finishing fairly bitter but sweet also. Alcohol is warming and a little hot at times, but overall this is a stellar big red - one of my favorite pseudo-styles.","barnzy78","Jun 01, 2013"

4.18,1.7,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4," The flavor has a tangy synergy of yeast and hops with tropical taste of grapefruit and mango with some light vegetal elements leading me to believe this was dryhopped. There is an orange rind element in the taste which brings a zesty overall taste with some sweetness in the malt support and alcohol boost. The hops have a nice flavor and slight grassiness but still seems to blend well with the yeast flavor. Overall I think this is a great beer for the value - very juicy hop flavor and the only drawback to have multiples is the elevated alcohol level.","Slatetank","May 21, 2013"

4.15,1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear golden color. There is a discernable peach tint as the beer leaves the mouth of the bottle and waterfalls into the glass. A foamy, off white head appears and lingers, but for no longer than the average ale. There is a wonderful, rich aroma of butterscotch offset by sweet citrus. Creamy mouthfeel that almost seems misplaced. A mild scrubbing appears on the rear of the tongue, likely due more to hop heat than carbonation, as the beer finishes. The flavors are complex. Not necessarily complimentary, but interesting. Sweet, bold malt brings an undeniable, vibrant toffee flavor, followed immediately by some pretty obtrusive hop resin. This is a pretty large effort on the part of Lagunitas for number 13. I like it because it is irreverent and disrespectful, but quite good.","DocJitsu","Jul 27, 2012"

It's perhaps a little more hoppy than a typical amber ale but that is a positive distinguishing characteristic. The beer has a decent price to value tradeoff and I'd definitely buy it again.","paulginva","Mar 08, 2012"

It's not a perfect 5.0, as there is a tiny bit of coppery aftertaste when it leaves the mouth, but with an ABV of 8.9%, that's to be expected and shouldn't be held against it too much.

I did like the splash of plum/fruit flavor in the middle, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's too much going on, in a bad way in this particular one. Very 'boozy.' I don't understand the reviewers who feel that it's balanced. This is my first Lagunitas offering, and I def. want to give them another try though.","Neorebel","Oct 01, 2011"

Some hints of vanilla and caramel buried amid the other scents. The taste is really sublime. Where's this one been all my life? I could definitely make a habit out of drinking THIS stuff. The taste too is on the malty side, but it's not over powering. There's a hidden kinda sweet, fruity, nutty undertone to the flavor profile that is very pleasant. This one goes down so easy.

4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a burnt orange color that has some hazy red hues to it. It grows about an inch of eggshell white head that dissipates quickly into a ring and patches of bubbles. It smells of citrus (grapefruit, orange), plenty of hops as is the Lagunitas way, some grass and herbs, and a nice malt base. Tastes similar, with an emphasis on the hops and citrus. A caramel malt backbone plays nicely throughout the drink, and helps smooth out the bitterness of the hops. Has a nice, medium bodied mouth that finishes very well (not too dry or sticky wet).

Poured with a stiff bright white foamy head with excellent head retention. Foam left rows of sticky lacings on the glass. Grapefruit hop and sweet caramel malt aromas are dominant with a hint of pine hop as well. Very crisp, fresh aroma. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a delicate smooth feel from beginning to end with just a touch of resinous feel at the finish. Nice balance of citrus grapefruit and caramal malt flavor from beginning to end with pine hop bitterness flavors becoming more prominent at the finish. Finishes clean with a light pine bitterness.

Scent is pure Lagunitas west coast hop - grapefruit and bitter pine - with some brown sugary sweet malt. Taste is quite strong on the grapefruit, some pine resin, with enough sweet malt to cut into the overall bitterness. Medium bodied, thinner feeling then the boldness of the scent and taste dictate, goes down clean and smooth...would like a touch of creaminess.

4.17,1.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a deep copper color that borders on redness. Stingy beige head dissipates quite quickly. Smells of dark caramel and toffee mixed with some grapefruit pine and orange. Tastes smooth with caramel, dark sugars, toffee starting each sip until the citric attack somewhere in the middle. Grapefruit, orange, and apricot cut through the sweetness and meld into a long lingering almost earthy bitterness that's covered in brown sugar. Medium to thick body, lower medium amount of carbonation with a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. I can't find any bottling dates on this one, but I suspect that this bottle isn't the freshest example of this beer even though I purchased this today at a somewhat reputable store. That being said I really enjoyed this beer. I would have liked a bit more hop, but as is this is still a damn tasty brew. Lagunitas I'm starting to really dig ya.","johnnnniee","Jun 22, 2011"

3.58,-12.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazed copper coloring with a chunky, light, fluffy cream colored head. Nose is slightly sour malt, mild hops, and peppery spices. The aromas are similar to a lot of DIPAs. The beer is round and robust in mouth, with the malt carrying most of the load, and the spices picking up the tail end. Spiced flavors include pepper and cardamom. The beer has a semi-sweet aftertaste, with a slight citrus hint at the very end. The finish is semi-sweet, also, with a slight sour balance. Flavors also remind me of some DIPAs. Beer leaves a great, thick lacing on the glass while you drink. Solid brew.","GarthDanielson","May 11, 2011"
3.84,-6.6,5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D/O: While comparisons of this beer to Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot may be appropriate, the Lucky 13 is the maltier of the two--seeming unbalanced in that direction despite the detectable hop influences. It is extreme for the style, considering the unusual sensory qualities, and would make an interesting player in a malt/hops contrast to Stone Arrogant Bastard. The aggressively malty backbone encourages pairing with zesty savory food, especially tomato-based sauces or soups.","beagle75","May 10, 2011"

3.8,-7.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a reddish-brown, has a thick, beige-colored head. I thought it was hoppier than other reviewers noted, I got an upfront bitterness, almost a pine-like hop taste (as with SN Torpedo). Taste is big, bold flavors of dark fruit, slight caramel, hops, alchohol is noticeable at 8.56% abv. It isn't very "drinkable" for me because of the higher ABV, but it is a good beer.

Taste starts off with well-balanced hops that don't overpower, followed by malts that are so wonderfully mixed, I couldn't even begin to explain them, so I leave it to the other generous BAs out there!

The flavor is sweet and fruity up front, with notes of molasses and a firm slap of medicinal hop off the back for balance. Mouthfeel is not unexpectedly round, given that they got this up to 8.56% ABV. All that alcohol doesn't really make itself felt except as a feeling of well-being, so take care.

Deep amber color. Reminds me of bourbon. Light carbonation. Good lacing. Very nice smell. Light, fruity hops. I don't know if I would call it fresh but definitely lively. The must have been amazing when it was younger. Rich malt notes of molasses and maple syrup lie just below the hoppyness. Fairly light body but with a robust texture. A smooth sip with an interesting finish. Hoppy enough so that when the malt comes through you get hints of coffee and dark chocolate and not just sweet. It reminds me a little bit of a dubbel in that respect. Very quaffable for such a big beer. I will restate my original sentiment: the must have been amazing fresh!

I really wish more breweries would follow their lead. This one is the same. The nose is nothing short of a ass ton of hops and a butt load of malt. Up front is a blast of citrus hops. It almost reminds me of sticking my nose into a bowl of Fruit Loops, if Fruit Loops weren't fake fruit flavored. Right after that is a toffee smack down. Toast, caramel, and over caramelized sugars. Man, this is tasty. With the nose so hop heavy, I'm surprised that its so malt forward. Big caramel and toffee notes. Sweet candied dark fruits, and just a bit of heavily toasted bread. After that is a blast of tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple, and tangerine. But its all complimentary. The mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied and finishes dry.

Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium bodied with a stickiness to the finish. Drinkability is outstanding. I tend to skip over more reds in generally, not that I dislike them they just don't tend to do much for me. Not the case here. Even at 8.5%, which is hidden well, this is a very tasty, easy drinking brew. Comparatively speaking the price is dirt cheap too which never hurts.","alli4051","Jul 24, 2010"

Taste is good, a little sweet but not too much. Very smooth and sweet initial taste with a bitter, citric hop taste on the back of the tongue. Another beer geek told me this had a "cherry" taste to it and i didnt see that at all, the standard grapefruit and citrus taste as many west coast beer. How this beer is an amber confuses me, I pretty much got IPA all the way. Mouthfeel was fine, not too full at all and a nice oily aftertaste.

It's crystal clear and has a bit of carbonation rising within. There is a thick head of tan foam. As it settles, patchy lacework is left behind. This beer looks like how I want a mug of beer served to me. As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell caramel malts. Now that the beer is in the glass and I can get a better handle on the aroma, I can smell caramel and toffee malts, oak and a bourbon-like alcohol. It smells strong and pleasing. The taste is equally impressive. Crispy, toasted malts are readily apparent and give the beer a a slightly sweet taste, reminiscent of brown sugar. Caramel flavors are present in the finish. The aftertaste has some oakiness. The entire taste has an underlying bitter presence. The beer is full bodied and leaves a lot of coating, but isn't too sticky or sweet. It is highly carbonated. For all of the big aspects of this beer (it is an Imperial Red, after all), it is very drinkable. I'll easily make my way through these 22 ounces this afternoon. I find myself wishing I had more than this one bottle. I also wish I had consumed this beer sooner. I've had this bottle for a few months, and I think the hop presence has suffered.

Taste is a nice mixture of malt sweetness similar to caramel and a moderate amount of hop bitterness coupled with a warming alcohol driven finish. Medium feel with light carbination. Very drinkable.

Pleasant but not overly powerful. Those aromas are present in the flavor with a nice brown sugar/toffee/caramel malt flavor blended with a bright citrus grapefruit/orange flavor. Sort of reminds me of a toned down version of brown sugar. Medium-bodied and low on the carbonation. Also, a bit cloying on the finish, maybe could have used a little more hop to balance out.

The aroma brings a tasteful but mild grapefruit hop that leaves me unsure of exactly what it packs. However, the first taste declares a sharp pine hop with a heavy caramel overtone that settles sweetly on the tongue. Mid-bodied for a nice feel with subtle carbonation, quite drinkable if you're a hophead, otherwise, not. This almost settles into a rhubarb tartness with a wheat grain mellow base.

Caramelized and toasted malts, along with a little bread, mix with a strong dose of herbal/spring hops. Hops are more pronounced than usual so they are even with the malts. A thin-to-medium body with some sweetness from caramel malt along with a drying sensation that comes from some biscuit malt/grainy hops. Also some hop bitterness that leads to the dry backbite despite the malts giving this beer a little stickiness. With the beer's malt/hop balance between sweet and piney dryness this is a very good beer, but if I want a red I am looking for a tad less hops. Still, I recommend this as a must-try for anyone.","clayrock81","Aug 13, 2009"

For the first time since I've been reviewing, I couldn't even remember if I had reviewed (or even tried, to be honest) Lagunitas' normal Imperial Red Ale. It turns out that 10 months ago I really liked it. And 10 months later, I really like this one, too. It's a very hoppy Red. There's good malt character (fruity and sweet) lurking beneath the waves of hop resins, but it's not the star of the show. The hops come through with a big piney bitterness that is mostly rounded out by the malt caramel. It's like biting a pine needle candy bar. There's also some grapefruit rind and maybe even tangerine rind, connoisseur to connoisseur. Anyway, it's a very nice beer if you like hoppy West coast style DIPAs or assertive hop charaters, generally.","popery","Jul 24, 2009"

The flavor is sweet, sticky hops upfront with some dried fruits and toasted malts and a soft bitterness to round things off. This is a full to medium bodied beer and is very sticky but at the same time has ample carbonation. Very interesting, seems like a super hoppy barleywine overall.

A heavy malt foundation reminiscent of a DIPA with the hops turned dessert, cinnamon swirl bread, spicy caramel, maple syrup, and red cake. The hops provide a healthy bitter to disguise the power punching ABV, which is no where to found. Thick, sappy, spicy and littered in saw dust; another check into the IMP RED column.","SeanRedd","Mar 08, 2009"

Red to brown brick in hue, tinge of yellow around the rims. Sweetly roasted malts dominate the nose, caramel and milk chocolate stick out clearly, good florality, rounds out with plum, raisin notes, minimal hop presence, maybe tangerine juice, sufficiently dense to persist texturally. Full-bodied, decidedly sweet, plays long on caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate creme fraiche and toffee components. The large-scale carbonation opens up spaces for the more bitter, drying hops to alter the mouth texture. That said, never "dry" in nature, adds in oatmeal, honey and rice elements. Raisin, fig, plum, cherry fruit. Remains broad and full through the finish. May be too sweet for many palates for this category of beer.","farrago","Jan 28, 2009"

The sweetness, however sticks on the roof of the mouth as the bitters finish boldly. The high AC is only evident a little bit in the middle. A great ale for hop lovers. The AC is a tad bit up (which I'm sure contributes to smooth mouthfeel and taste) so in my book the drinkability can't be 5.0. However,as a brewery, Lagunitas never disappoints.

As the first molocule hits the tongue the sweetness parts for the earthy grassy hop flavor.

The smell is of carmalized malts, citrus, floral and piney hops. Cannot smell the alcohol but this one is obviously well hoped and malted. The taste is very ballanced, malts and hops peak here and there but keep each other in check. A little hint of the alcohol on the back end. This one is thick and slick leaving some hop oil residue with some lingering bitterness. Very drinkable almost too drinkable for a strong ale.","jordoo","Jul 25, 2008"

4.18,1.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Picked this one up at "Bottleworks" in Seattle. I've had mixed results with this brewery but I was very curious about the labeling as a " Mondo Large Red Ale". Pour definitely had rosy red suggestions as well as dark orange down the sides of the glass, head was dense and cream colored, leaving lots of lacing as it dissipates. Nose was actually milder than expected for a beer with over 8 percent alcohol, I get some very nice juicy hops and a bit of bubblegum. Taste is actually very smooth and soft, well balanced caramel texture with a well-timed hop finish, alcohol is almost invisible. I think this beer is very well done, quite tasty and despite carrying a high ABV would make a good introduction to someone wanting to wander into over 7% ABV territory.","masikon","Jun 25, 2008"

Poured into a Belgian glass a nice copper amber with a decent head that lasted as a thin layer and leaves spectacular lacing. Aroma was some nice caramel malt and slight pine. Taste was an almost perfect balance of burnt caramel and pine hops, very flavorable. The beer is medium bodied with some alcohol, but for the strength it's fairly well hidden.

I don't have to get my nose very close to the glass before I smell the bountiful citrus and pine hops in this one, but a deeper whiff reveals the sweet malty caramel which accompanies. The sweet side of oranges and grapefruits combines with caramel malt sweetness in the front as their rinds provide back end bitterness. A bit of spicy rye in the middle (credit to peeking at Buckeye below, I wouldn't have attributed that spiciness to rye on my own, but I believe you are correct sir) with earthy, piney hops joining in on the bitter finish. Medium to full in body with good carbonation contributing to a moderately creamy mouthfeel. I've had Imperial Red before--although I've never officially reviewed it--and retain very fond memories, so I think I lean slightly toward that offering.

Off-white head retention withstood the session well. Aromas of toasted malts, light caramel and barley malt rose high above the spicy, citrusy hops. Light bready / yeasty fermentation scent gave a sense of depth to the smell. Tastes kick off with the barley / caramel flavors, but well attenuated for clean taste. Along with the yeast, bready character, the beer tastes very sturdy. Spiced up with a mix of warming alcohols, orage-flavored and grapefruit hops, and a modest peppery note late. The beer actually feels light compared to the bold flavors, and became a bit metallic late. Finished clean but a little bite-ey.

Flavor is right there with the aroma. It hits first with an earthy pine and a moderate toasty and caramel maltyness. It finishes with a mild bitterness and a reprise of the earthy and pine notes. The flavor on this one is very big, but not at all overbearing. The toastyness really works well with the earthy notes from the hop. I don't find any alcohol flavor in there which is a surprise from the ABV. Mouthfeel is moderate with a mild carbonation.

In the mouth, my initial impression was sweetened grapefruit juice. It was not quite balanced enough, and leaning towards the sweet/malty end was a bit of a surprise coming from Lagunitas. There simply wasn't enough bitterness to meet all the crystal malt sweetness it brought, it was borderline cloying for me. In addition, the malts didn't proclaim themselves very distinctly, not toasty, bready or yeasty, a little nondescript for being a "red ale". Mouthfeel was where this beer suffered the most: it was sticky and slick, medium carbonation couldn't cut through all the stickly sweetness.

It had fantastic head retention, holding its lovely pillowy cap of foam for several minutes, and leaving a nice sticky web of lace on the glass. A very solid looking beer. Smell was comprised almost entirely of hops and nothing else. Taste, too, seemed very unbalanced to the side of hops and nearly bereft of any malt whatsoever.

Another one of these beers that I spotted today was the 13th Anniversary Release from Lagunitas. The bomber was adorned with an appropriate Western style label, and it took me a minute to catch the ExAyeAyeAye pun. The beer poured out a deep shade of bronze. The body was clear, and the head was typical IPA generous. The aroma was quite hoppy with pine resin being the predominant impression. The taste was bitter and resinous with a drying hop presence. Not much of Red Ale like caramel flavor to be found here, or if there was any it was well covered over with hops. Quite a different beer than what it looked like after pouring, but a good one anyway. Hopheads everywhere should seek this out immediately.","rajendra82","Mar 25, 2007"

4.3,4.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Big red hoppy ales have come on strong lately, and I wonder why that is? Is it a backlash against the Imperial pils? Is it a much needed, more malty repose to the ever growing number of big APA's out there? Or is it a kind of get to the heart of it and back to the roots kind of thing? I dunno, but I can say without doubt that Lagunitas has really hit the nail on the head with this one. The citrusy hops, yeasty fruitiness, and sweetish caramelish malts combine so perfectly that you'd hardly ever realize it was anything other than an average "red" ale. The alcohol never really stands out (although you will feel it halfway through a bomber), and it has great drinkability. They've kept the hops in-check - although it would have been very easy fro them to take them to a resinous, raspy level; and the bitterness is fine-tuned to give great balance, and nothing else. The caramelish malt is clear, but not overdone in depth or sweetness; and the hops are blended so as not to be all splashy and zesty citrusy fruit. In a way it's a bold move for Lagunitas (who are kind of known for having a bit of an aggressive edge) to have NOT gone all out with an anniversary beer - but they've done it. AND, on the label they reference a couple of guys who've done the same thing... made a beer that stands out, but embraces - and I think they're on the right track. Well-rounded, superbly balanced, remarkably drinkable!","NeroFiddled","Mar 12, 2007"
