"12 fl oz. Medium to deep amber colour with a mid density, light tan head which lasted well and left scattered lacing. Aroma of pine, resin, citrus, paw paw, caramel and licorice. Medium bitterness and light to medium sweetness. Medium bodied, almost fluffy texture with a semi-dry, lingering bitter finish. A hint of alcohol warmth. Decent enough. 7."

"Bottle well past its prime....will re-review when fresh.  Bottled on 07/14, consumed on 02/09/15.  No hop aroma on nose. Color slightly cloudy. Well-carbonated.  Taste is all caramel malt.  Part of a 'mixer 'sixer I picked up at a local bottle shop.  Shame on me for not checking the date well before purchasing."

"One of my favorite Red IPA's."
"Very good beer. Nothing to rant about, just a good example of the style."
"Totally ok. Totally not something I would seek out again."
"Pours an opaque deep amber producing a nice 2.5 finger, tan, frothy, nicely lasting head that leaves a good coating of thin, splotchy, webby lace. Nose is citrus, resinous pine & a hint of tropical hops forward backed by caramel, biscuit & toasted malts & something very rye like even though none should be there. Taste is citrus fruit & pith & resinous pine nicely balanced with toasted caramel malt imparting a subordinate sweetness with a burnt hint, finishing full bodied citrus, pine, a hint of tropical fruit & spicy hoppiness. Afrertaste is nicely bitter & lightly astringent again with something very rye like present. Overall malt & hops have a high degree of balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, dry & drawing aftertaste."

"I like amber IPA's, and this is a real nice offering.  Great balance of citrus-tasting hops (citra, simcoe and centennial) and a nice carmel malt presence.  You get a slight bit of hop bitterness in the finish - not overpowering but present.  If you like that you will love this.  Either way it is a quality brew that tastes real good.  This was a great autumn pickup for me."
""
""
"nice bubbly carb, pretty bitter and piney when fresh"
"Beautiful balance between all the different qualities."
"Tastes really hoppy but has a slight lager taste. But I love the fall spices."
""
"Pours a dense light tan head. Good retention and lacing. Clear, red of course. Not an over the top hop aroma but piney, apricot hops are in the forefront. Nice caramel underpinning. Hints of raisin. Bitterness is well balanced and hop flavor is in the lead. Nice pine, apricot and subtle melon notes. Bitterness lingers a bit on the tongue. The sweet caramel malt isn't overshadowed by the hops. Fair bit of alcohol warming that finishes dry with a mild bit of astringency. Overall a nice IPA."
"Great beer, I am surprised how such big company can produce such quality beer, please don’t change this recipe. Very flavorful, complex, pleasantly hoppy and superbly balanced beer. Bringing together two styles I love, it cannot go wrong. I Don’t understand the disparity in grades, though the most recent ones seem much better. I guess average people like maltier-sweeter cloying beers."

"Pours a nice copper with light tan head. Head disappears relatively quickly but lacing remains very strong. Smells very earthy like cool wet soil on a hot summer day, lighter on the hoppiness. Very interesting and nice. The taste has a delicate bitterness and hoppiness up front but fades quickly to fruit punch on the finish (like Hawaiian punch - really cool). Has a very sophisticated feel for what I consider a sessionable beer. The complexity of a great IPA with a drinkability that is all its own. Overall fantastic and well worth the money. This and Celebration Ale have really impressed me and have been two of my favorites here at the end of 2014. Kudos Sierra Nevada!"

"Absolutely love the very floral and herbal taste, and the hops are very good. I love the intensity that Torpedo IPA brings, but I also like that this one is not quite as intense, and gives you more of that earthy flavor, this beer is very very good and I will look forward to it every single year."
""
""
"Overall a pretty decent hoppy APA in my book.  Would definitely get more if looking for something more toward the sessionable side."

"Malty flavours. Nutty and toast notes along with the faintest chocolate note. Some soft piny and earthy hops."

"(3.55) O: Overall, earthy bitterness, dry toasted ipa, though only mildly entertaining with a limited range of complexity. Good toasted body, though hardly exciting. Flavor seemed a bit thin at times substance wise."

"Leans to the dry side that intensifies in the swallow.  Light hop finish which leaves a mild, but lasting aftertaste.  A bit thin with an elevated carbonation."
""
""
""
"This is a really effective, yeoman effort from Sierra Nevada, which—while not truly great—is very good.  While it is a pretty solid ""rebuttal to the [...] beers of summer", I'm nonetheless think it better complements the later, fully-chilled days of Autumn, as opposed to the ""final flash of summer"" for which Sierra Nevada intends it."

"I really enjoyed this Red IPA!"
""
""
""

"Clear copper-amber pour with a two finger beige head with great retention and crazy lacing.  The nose isn't huge, a bit malt forward with lots of caramel along with hints of brown sugar and subtle pine and citrus.  The taste follows suit with the caramel malt once again the star.  Hints of pine, brown sugar, tangerine, subtle grapefruit, and toast.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and incredibly well balanced with a subtle creaminess and smooth finish.  Overall, I wouldn't really call this an IPA, but it's a solid Red Ale with off the charts drinkability."

"O: A dull beer, seems lifeless and flabby. Big disappointment from SN."
"Poured a clear reddish brown body with two fingers of fluffy off-white head. An amazing looking ale, a combination of a red ale, an IPA and a brown. Scents of lemon peel, grassy hops, tropical fruit, especially mango with some pineapple, a light pine resin and a nice soft presence of toasted and bready malt. Overall impression of aroma is of a wonderfully hoppy, yet deeply malty ale that feels like both an IPA, a brown and a heavily hopped red ale. It is unique and quite pleasant. Flavor begins moderately bitter with notes of pine resin, tropical fruit and dried orange peel, light lemon zest, a backbone of toasted malt and light caramel. This moves into a middle that is bitter and continues the previous flavors but adds a grassy hop flavor and more tropical fruit, especially mango. Flavor is dry with strong notes of pine resin, light tropical fruit, moderate toasted and nutty malt, light lemon zest. Aftertaste is toasted and nutty malt, light pine resin. Overall impression of flavor is of a wonderfully rich and hoppy beer that has a pleasant toasted maltiness and the pleasant flavor of West Coast hops. Quite nice. Mouthfeel is resinous with light carbonation and a slick, oily finish. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a very nice, hop forward beer. Well done and pleasant. Overall this is a well done and rather unique beer. It combines the toasted malt of many Autumn beers with a nice hoppiness that adds balance. A very nice beer and a solid addition to the SN seasonals."

"I drank this from the bottle outside.  When I cracked it open I could smell the hops, the first taste was outstanding, pine and citrus with good malt smoothie.  Mouthfeel was excellent and this was an easy beer to drink.  It was 39 degrees clear and cool outside and the beer felt like that.  Excellent beer."

"A very enjoyable, malt-forward beer with a nice hop spiciness to balance it all out. Looks, great, tastes fine, and makes an outstanding autumnal brew..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look appears to be an unfiltered murky reddish brown color, with a very light brownish tan one inch head already on its way out and leaving some lacing. From smell I'm getting some sweet caramel maltiness...and on the back end I'm getting some grassy earthy hops also some very subtle fruitiness you would find in a typical IPA...(grapefruit etc.). Kind of lacking in the smell department. Ok, this beer is verrrrrrry drinkable and easy....... its a really good balance between bitterness and sweet ness as well. kind of one dimensional as you get all the flavors at once in your mouth rather then noticing a bunch of things happening.....very smooth though. Overall kind of lacks in flavor but for a drinkable ipa nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O - feels more like a red at the beginning, but then the solid hoppy bitterness makes itself known.  Nothing outstanding, but a solid red IPA nonetheless."

"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours ruby read with a small fine head. Aroma of caramel and toffee, citrus and honey. Taste of caramel with citrus hops. Decent beer."
""
"Overall: I am happy I picked up this 12 pack, it was really well priced and is an amazing beer. Good alternative to all the Oktoberfest and pumpkin beers this time of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic Red IPA.  You don't find Red IPA's very often but it's a great merge of the two beers.  I plan to get this beer at least once a year when it comes out."

"Notes: Clear chestnut-ruby body. The frothy light tan head drops to become creamy. Very good retention and lacing. Aroma: citrusy over sweet malt that's a little like dark cake. The flavor follows with the malt acting as the base for the hop flavors: bright citrus (pineapple, grapefruit), and berries (possibly from the yeast, or a combination of things). Solid bitterness. Interesting maltiness: very darkly caramelish with a sugary-bread and toast component ~ as stated, kind of like dark cake. Medium bodied, gently effervescent/crisp carbonation. Dry, lingering finish with residual bitterness and hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent brew form SN. A bit of harsh bitterness, almost a burnt roasted flavor, detracts from an otherwise enjoyable experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice hybrid of styles. Although it says it is a Red IPA, I think it is more of a cross between a Brown ale and a pale ale, maybe even a stout and a pale ale. However it takes the best of both styles and proves itself as an interesting offering from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  Did not live up to the label."
""
""
"Easy drinking but nothing that makes it overly memorable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite a nice surprise as I find a balance of grapefruit, lemon rind, piney resin and citrus hops against a backdrop of barley grain, caramel malt and roasted nuts. A little bitter in the finish it has a easy drink ability while holding up a proper heftiness."
""
""
"O - I am big fan of this beer. I really enjoy the balance between the malt and hops. If you are looking for a hop bomb this is not it, but if you enjoy a well crafted and balanced brew, check it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not my favorite here. I don't get any big hop flavors particularly, but the alpha acids come shining through. While still a bit hop-forward, it's closer to balanced than I expected - but neither the hop profile nor the malt bill seem particularly complex or interesting. Nothing offensive, but nothing to seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You first taste tropical fruit then the after taste has caramel/chocolate flavor. Not a bad beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent offering from SN, but one that I think could improve with higher emphasis on the malt and a slightly toned down hoppiness. The last third of the beer was great, and it was something I'd have liked to see throughout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: IPA's are not my choice style of beer but I really really enjoyed this beer. Not obnoxiously bitter like some IPAS, bust still interesting and very drinkable. The bottle says it's a seasonal beer for between summer and fall, I guess that makes sense. Awesome. Cheers!"

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a yellow/white head. Smells like roasty malts, yeast, and orange hops. The flavor is very roasty with a nice hoppy backbone. Almost tastes like a black ipa. Nice."

"9/8...pours deep brownish red, white foam layer and ring. Clingy. Malty caramel nose. Hearty amber ale taste with a full bitter. Long lasting. Buried fruitiness and small citrus too."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good sour/bitter bite across the tongue and roof of the mouth. Label mentions tropical fruit, but this is gone due to age on the bottle. But you can taste the quality of a SN ale, and it's tasty enough. Once again I finsd a decent beer on the downslide and am left to wonder how it would have tasted. Clear easy to read large letter BD's can't come soon enough."
""
""
""
""
"O- A tasty treat. I would recommend and would definitely have another again. A pleasantly balanced IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Normally I'm not a fan of red beers.  I blame Killian's.  But this Red IPA was thoroughly tasty.  The amount of hops was just perfectly bitter and there was a nice dryness too.  I also noticed lovely notes of pine and citrus."
""

"Classy red IPA, great aroma and a great taste!"

"Had this from the bottle in Maui. Typical well made offering from SNB. Malty, very drinkable."
""
""
"O. This beer is awesome, stop reading this and go get one. The fact that it is a seasonal beer makes it bitter sweet. This beer is super complex and that’s coming from a man who mostly drinks Russian Imperial Stouts. Heavy than average buzz for 6.2%."
""
"I missed out on this in its first year of existence and wanted to make sure I grabbed it this year...  I fingers worth of slightly late to develop medium khaki colored rich frothy goodness...  The color is a medium bronzish copper...  A good bite of medium sized carbonation rises briskly throughout...  Very mild aroma...  Biscuit....  Toasted malts...  A nice caramel presence...  Just a very light earthy hop presence lingering beneath the surface...    Medium bodied and sturdy...  Perhaps a bit on the thin side of the equation...  A bit of a dry finish...  A rather pedestrian but still enjoyable brew...  Nothing I would go out of my way to seek out, but nothing I would turn my nose up at if presented the opportunity in the future..."
""
""
""
""
""
"I Pop!ped the cap and gave it a heavy-handed pour to watch the pseudo-cascade take place. It settled into two fingers of rocky, tawny head with great retention. Color was a Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "
""
""
""
""
""
""

"OVERALL: Another Quality Product By Sierra Nevada. Which as usual didn't fall to impress. I would recommend this RED ALE Without ANY Hesitation"

"Malty and slight spice up front followed by slight citrus taste which turns piney afterwards. Refreshing for end of summer in Florida where it doesn't feel like fall but you want it to!"

""
""

"Nice Amber ale, not overly hoppy or fruity but just enough to know you are enjoying a red IPA, perfect for a crisp, cool fall evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice reddish hue with a lasting off white head, good lacing. Aroma and Taste is floral hops upfront slowly mellowing to a flavorful citrus and orange peel flavor with some caramel malt notes. A smooth drinking, medium body, with good carbonation. Finishes with some nice caramel malt and citrus orange peel flavor balanced by some good floral herbal hops for balance. A well made nicely balanced and flavorful brew. Good stuff."
""
""
""
"I really enjoyed this one. Pours a very nice amber red with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell is full of hops giving it a floral aroma but with a lot of subtleties I can't quite place. The taste was great, with all spice at the beginning turning more to the hops in the middle with a nice toasty finish. I found this one very enjoyable. Would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
""
"This is what I would like Amber ales to taste like.  There's a solid hop profile that goes along with biscuit and tea flavors. If any brewery was going to pull this off it was likely to be this one. I typically prefer brighter ipas but this remains very drinkable.  I'd happily get this again."
""
""

"Love the red ipa's and this one is good. A hint of the red malt but pretty pale. Very refreshing."

""
""
""
""

""
""

"Very well balanced. Not too citrusy as I thought it was going to be. Still a good hoppy flavor as with most Sierra Nevada beers."
""
"Overall, a decent beer but it just didn't do it for me. Too many great IPA's out there (inc. several from SN) to buy this one again."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada bills this as the antidote for long hot summers spent drinking light ""sessionable"" ales.  They got that right.  I found my six pack in mid-September, the very nick of time.  It may not be exactly sessionable, but I will definitely look for this tasty brew again."

"A good amber IPA which helps transition into the autumn season.  3.7"
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip nonic.  Pours a burnt red hue with a slight haze to the clarity and a loose, quarter inch, light tan head.  Head eventually disperses into a soapy slick.  Diffuse spots and strands of lacing are present during the tasting.   Nose expresses rich malts and intense floral/citrus notes.  Taste is interesting - I almost get a coffee/carmel malt profile integrated with earthy/herbal/citrusy hop notes.  Finishes with an earthy, slightly medicinal bitterness that lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp carbonation and a light acidity.  Overall, there's just a little too much happening here to make it overly drinkable.  It's well-crafted, but not something I need to revisit."

"IMO, it's hard to go wrong with any Sierra Nevada brew.  With the end of summer/beginning of fall, wanted to try this new red ipa from SN.  Pours a very dark amber with a nice 1 1/2 inch foamy, billowy head.  Beautiful hoppy smell -- a little bit pine-y and a little bit fruity.  The taste is slightly bitter, but very easy to drink.  The taste is hoppy and floral, really solid.  At 6.2% and a very high drink-ability....be careful with this one!"
""
"packaged on 7/16/14"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (packaged 7/24) into my tulip. Deep reddish hue looked kind of transluscent... little bit of head. Grassy Centennial hops broke through on the nose, a bit of citrus, the ubiquitous SN fresh smell, and a bit of a bitter note. Refreshingly bitter to taste (maybe a bit too bitter), covered up the nice malt character some. Typical light/medium SN body to the IPA style. However crisp, with a nice finish. As much as I like SN, this seemed a typical SN beer. Quite good, but would probably choose something more adventurous next time."
"Pours dark amber/red color with half finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are minimal.  Has an apple, slightly citric aroma, maybe a little bready.  Hop first taste, more grassy than anything else.  Smoother, malty citrus taste follows with a nice bitter aftertaste.  Good beer.  Leaves that nice bitter aftertaste I like with IPAs.  There is a little something off in the transition of malts and hops in this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid red. As the description states, it does indeed seem perfect for those two weeks or so in between the last gasps of summer and the first crisps of fall. Gorgeous thick head, deep ambery-red color. Bright pine scent. Not too malty. Leads a complex hoppy, then malty, then back and forth in that manner. Hadn't seen this before but glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid beer. Exactly what you would expect from SN"
""
""
"O:  pretty good seasonal red.  Balanced well.  Probably would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm a huge fan of red IPA's and Sierra Nevada hit this one on the head.  Solid malty Red IPA that's great for these chilly summer nights as we transition into fall. Great job."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is mostly bitter. The overall impression is a hoppy brew with lots of malt to balance things. I thought it was a lot higher alcohol content than it is - it seemed heavier. Recommended."
"Taste is hop forward but has a nice, even-keeled malt foundation that makes the beer so tasty. It is not toasty, or toffee, or even caramel - a little bit of all three would be as best I can describe. The hops shine with plenty of both flavoring (citrus) and bittering. Mouthfeel is great, perfect carbonation and light enough to be refreshing. I'll buy more of this, for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"The body shows of a clean nature while running on the lighter side of medium.  The focus is crispness, though it is quite smooth.  It almost has a lager-like feel to it, actually, as well as having a leafy, mildly dry element and almost a somewhat mineral feel to it that adds a bit of English, so to speak, in my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Blends both qualities of an amber and an IPA very well.  Features the great toasted malt features as well as a nice grapefruit hop punch and resinous bitterness that works well with the biscuit malt backbone. Crisp. Perfect brew for the transition to fall. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Umm, its okay, its got decent balance, its got a nice drinkability, clean, its just there..."
"Overall- A real good IPA, i would drink this again and often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is an extremely well executed, complex beer, which essentially equates to a very hoppy amber ale. Sierra Nevada definitely flexes their brewing prowess with this one; the hop and malt bill truly jive seamlessly and deliciously."
""

"overall: Interesting Amber or Red IPA or whatever. Not great but decent enough."

"Great Red IPA. Not too fruity. Beautiful Color."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a deep, crystal clear, ruby-amber coloring, with a thin, sparse, off-white head.  Aromas of roasted caramel, toasted grains, tart grapefruit notes, and subtle hops resin notes.  Flavors are more richly sweet forward, with roasted caramel and hints of toffee, followed quickly by a citrus blast of grapefruit and tangerine, with a solid dose of hops bitterness, some piney highlights, resinous and dank, and a cracker backbone.  Pretty decently balanced palate, on a light, crisp body.  The aftertaste is bittersweet, with a tart highlight throughout.  Smooth, slightly dry, fairly clean finish.  Subtle lingering tart and bitter feel on the taste buds.  Solid brew."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours dark red with tall, long lasting white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and tropical fruit.  Body is medium and tangy.  Citrusy, piney and earthy hops dominate the palate while caramel malt and ripe fruit provide support. Finish is long and grapefruity.  Very good, hoppy brew."
""
"Pours dark reddish amber with medium beige head. Aroma is sweet caramel and bready malt with hints of juicy citrus. Taste is sweet juicy citrus hops upfront that fade into caramel and bready malt notes on the follow through. Aftertaste is lingering bitter spruce and citrus hops. Palate is medium and sticky. Overall nice balance between sweet malt and juicy and bitter hops."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of citrus notes with some caramel malt clearly noticeable. Taste is also dominated by citrus notes and loads of caramel malt notes are also evident with quite a bit of residuals sugar. Body is quite full for style with good carbonation. Too much caramel malt for my taste with the Citra hops not coming out as much as I was expecting."

"Good beer. Kind of has a rye flavor on top of the hops. Not a bad price either. Coats about $13 for a 12 pack."

"Sierra Nevada always puts out a quality brew and this one is no exception.Pours a beautiful red hue.Smells of grapefruit and pine needles to me.Really tasty beer but would be hard for me to drink more than one of these a night.Overall a satisfying brew."

"O- Personally, this might be my new favorite Sierra Nevada offering.  I think that I prefer it to the Torpedo, Rye IPA and the Celebration.  Those are all awesome beers, but for me this one has a bit more complexity than the others and it accomplishes this without muddling any one attribute.  Really solid and I hope that it becomes a regular offering at the end of the summer.  It certainly deserves to be.  (4.11)"
""
""
"Overall:  I personally enjoy this more than I did last year when first released.  Theres a nice complexity between the citrus-forward hops and the darker malts.  I feel the hop flavors are masked somewhat by the malts used compared to Sierra Nevada's other IPAs.  This leads to the hops giving almost a spicy note throughout."
""
"Pours a nice amber color. Nice carbonation. Dry bitterness in this one. The darker malt is just enough to make this drinkable. No sweetness of note."

"Another solid ipa from Sierra Nevada.  Simcoe, centennial and citra-how can you go wrong ?  Pine, citrus, fruit with a lingering bitterness that coats the tongue and mouth. Aroma is tropical, quickly dissipating one finger wide soft white head, deep red color with moderate carbonation.  The initial taste is citra, it's signature fruit taste followed by the resiny, pine and citrus of simcoe all complimented by the grapefruit of centennial.  Clean yeast taste lingering bitterness  a solid beer"

"O- Very unique beer we have here. It is an IPA no questions asked, but it is a different breed of IPA. Not quite as roasty and malty as a black IPA, nor not as citrusy and bitter as a IIPA or even an IPA for that matter. Sierra Nevada continues to truly brew staples of each different beer style. A red IPA is mean't to blend together and blur the lines of IPA's and other styles. This particular brew does just that. There are a handful of breweries that just can't miss, Sierra Nevada is among them. To infinity, and beyond."

"Fantastic seasonal beer from Sierra Nevada. Has a nice pine/citrus smell to it that is really nice when first opened and then fades away. Dark reddish color is exactly what you would hope it looks like. The taste is that of a not-too-hoppy IPA with a lovely nut type flavor to go along with it. Really enjoyed this beer."

Somewhat grainy texture with a dry finish. A slight twist on the American ipa. Tastes a lot like a RyePA. Not half bad."

"Catch you on the Sierra Nevada red IPA. No panache. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise cherrywood topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, light pine sap, caramel, mild maple syrup, and a touch of grass. The taste brings in more of the same, the caramel and maple boldly defending against the massive onslaught of pine and citrus, though entirely in vain. Yeah, this means there's a bit of clash to the flavors, but it's not all that strident. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a nice ""red IPA"". 'Nuff said, really."

A solid beer - tasty and relatively bitter."

Not a IPA with a distinct hop bite but still a beer with a lot of character. Enjoyable beer that goes down easy."

"Overall - Nothing bold or in your face about this one, just a decent well rounded american amber. Something that will appeal to most beer drinkers I suppose."
""

"I poured this from a bottle into an Ale glass. The color is great with a nice head which makes for great lacing. It appears as a deep red/brown kind of reminds me of changing leaves which makes it really nice for the time of year. There is a nice scent o this beer, you get some floral hops and even, am I nuts, maybe some spiced apple? It smells awesome! The mouth-feel is just perfect and very unique. There is a lot of carbonation but it works well here and I think they were going for something that had a bubbly feel as it keeps this IPA initially light on the palate. The taste...how did they do this? Starts off with light hops, different for an IPA, then YES I got some spiced apple and even some cinnamon finishing with more hops but not of citrus, more like light pine which works so well with the other flavors. This is one of the strangest IPAs I have ever had and its great! Would even be great for later in the season and I believe anyone who enjoys quality crafted IPAs will be very very surprised at this one. Entirely unique!"

"O: I'm personally glad they swapped out Tumbler for this, but I'm not especially in the mood for hoppy beers this time of year. Nevertheless, this is a good beer that lives up more to the ""Red IPA"" on it's label than the typical amber ale style."

"Keeping in mind that this is a red first though, even if a red IPA, this is a great example of a red. I thought I hated reds (too much Leine's Red in college) but have been converted by Fixed Gear and the like, and this is an excellent example of a red done with some gusto. Would buy again."
"Overall an excellent beer."

"Overall: Not quite an IPA, not quite an amber, but a nice combination."

"O- I like the idea of pairing this with a caramel dessert as suggested on the SN website, and did to great effect with my wife's caramel/chocolate/cookie concoction. I enjoy the balance of the beer. Good early fall beer as marketed. Procured as a party leftover, I'd pay to drink it again."
""
""
"The body was on the light side of typical for the style, and had a bitter finish that lingered a bit too long for my enjoyment. Drinkability was OK, I probably wouldn't have 2 in a row, but I'd have it again. Overall, a nicely pleasant brew that's probably worth a shot when you see it."

"Mouthfeel is good, medium body with moderate carbonation leaves this very drinkable. Bitterness is not overly assertive."

"12 oz bottle from ""Lifesource"" in Salem. $1.89 Pours a dark amber clear coloured ale. Huge frothy,tight crème coloured head. Aroma herbal garlic, weed, style hop some caramel and that’s it..might be the huge head.. Taste is more balanced a lot of smooth caramel malts, skunky hop in the background. Palate is the best thing about this beer smooth and low carbonated. This is an all right beer but kind of a let down, expected more."

"This is excellent; lots of citrus and grapefruit. The smell is so inviting. They have this listed on BA as American Amber/Red Ale. Oh how I wish ambers and red ales tasted like this. I would definitely get this again."

""
""
""
"Lots of fresh hop flavours mucking about here, that's for sure, but they aren't allowed to totally run the table, as the malt backbone seems less than keen to take their guff. What we get out this is a zingy, earthy, and enjoyable IPA/Amber clone, in the best NoCal way."

"Beer looks great on the pour. Massive creme head with a significant degree of lacing. Flavor profile is good. Kind of what I expect to get from Sierra Nevada. Seems to fall off a bit quickly though. I wouldn't mind a more lasting flavor. But what is there is nice and hearty with a slight sweet tang that seems almost fruit like."
""
""

"O - Flipside starts like a red-hued IPA in the aroma, losing itself somewhere in flavor where it's focused and direct aromas become muddled but, the mouthfeel and finish are a lot more akin to Sierra Nevada's style, bitter but controlled and drinkable."
"Pours a deep amber color with a thick off-white head. Pleasant citrus/piney smell. Taste is balanced between piney hops and earthy, roasted malt. Aftertaste is definitely hoppy. Laces nicely on the side of the side of the glass. Carbonation is pretty good. Overall, not bad."
"Overall, a really good beer from Sierra Nevada but I don't necessarily like it as a fall sesonal. I reallly miss Tumbler."

"O-a well balanced red ale that is hoppy without being overbearing."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber coupled with a red hue resulting in a full off white head. Excellent lacing. Nice hoppy nose - pine and citrus. Light medium body. Prominent hop flavor without being overly bitter. Finishes with a great hop flavor rather than a kick in your teeth bitterness, such as SN Torpedo. This is one of SN's best beers. It is well balanced with malt and hop flavor. A very nice citrus / pine flavor at the finish that lingers as slightly bitter grapefruit."
""

"Yo me gusta Flipside Red IPA!!!! The beer pours a nice clear amber with thin white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The smell is a nice bouquet of fresh hops that carries subtle pine and citrus. The taste is a well balanced fight between subtle malt and fresh hops which provides a very nice sessionable beer. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great beer and I am glad to have tried it."
""

"Its an excellent beer and the hops really come through so well. I like this better than their torpedo because of the sweet malt taste which really wraps this beer up nicely. Sierra Nevada was smart to go with this one instead of their last Fall offering."

"D/O: This seasonal replacement for Tumbler brown ale is a return to true Sierra Nevada form. It moves their annual line-up even closer to presenting an uninterrupted continuum of sensory qualities--this one seems to fit somewhere between Pale Ale and Celebration IPA. It appears to be a well-executed middle-road recipe that lacks much of a dry-hopped character one might hope for in a new IPA recipe debuted in 2013."
"O- didn't get either tropical fruit or citrus but this is an interesting beer all the same."

"Overall, a solid red IPA. I'll have to do a vertical tasting of this and Nugget Nectar sometime."
""
""
""
"O - I usually enjoy SN products, but I think this one is a little off the mark in almost every area. Whats odd is that they have created much better red IPA's as part of their ""Beer Camp"" series. Wonder why this one got the nod? Not a repeat buy."

"Well a very interesting beer, will enjoy this 6er that is for sure.... I will say that upon first sip it does have that ""Hey its a SN hoppy Beer aroma and taste! Flavor""... But when something works why change it???"
"O-I have mix thoughts about this beer. On one hand being a hop lover I enjoyed this beer pretty well. On the other hand this is a beer strickly for hop heads. I think this one would not be recommened for the average newby craft beer lover. The bitterness level kind of almost over takes everything, but for a hop head like myself, I would recommend them trying it for sure."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 8/16/2013. Pours lightly cloudy light ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, mango, pineapple, lemon zest, orange zest, caramel, toast, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, mango, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, and pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and extremely crisp and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O- A pretty good red ale, but not nearly hoppy enough to be a red IPA. The bitterness is definitely there and may actually be a little too much for the lack of hop flavor in this beer.

"Bottled 8-5-14. Kicked up a nice two finger fluffy tan head that settled to a quarter inch that lasted to the end. Clear reddish-brown color. Aroma was a bit subdued, with some piney and citrus notes. Also got some caramel and malty bits. Taste was pretty good, with a good hoppy bite, also got a bit of sweetness and caramel as it warmed. Medium body with good carbonation. This one is really in my wheelhouse, especially considering the price. Keep up the good work Sierra Nevada!"

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and above average example of the style, the hops didn't do the greatest job at holding my attention, but I thought the malt profile was really nice. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean and the flavor did a decent job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these. What I liked the most about this beer was the malt base, I thought it was very well done. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop profile, it wasn't bad, but it's very typical for Sierra Nevada and it can be found in almost all of their other hoppy bees. I might order this at a bar, but I don't think I would buy any to keep at home and I would recommend it to people that like pretty hoppy Red Ales. Overall I liked this beer, but I wish Sierra Nevada would try something different when it comes to hopping their beers. This was a solid effort, but I prefer Tumbler over this beer and I'm sad to see it go, I just don't think Flipsise is on the same level, especially for the season."

"Overall: A pretty good selection though not in Sierra Nevadas top 5. It is marketed as a Red IPA, however, it resembles an amber ale. Very well balanced with more aroma hops than bittering."

""
"Overall, this is another solid IPA from Sierra Nevada."
"O - mixed feeling of this. Red IPA I would expect more hop flavor upfront, I know traditionally a red ale will lack late addition flavoring hops, but if you slap the word IPA on it, I expect it. It does have some but just not what I was thinking. Beyond that it tastes great, the Bittering is huge and refreshing."
""
"Moutfeel is good, lighter end of medium bodied, taste slightly lingers a few seconds. Great carbonation level. Well balanced overall, steady sweet start with a clean bitter finis that's slightly dry. This beer is a perfect transition from summer to fall beer, great in between beer. I like the Red IPA style and this is a good example, slight step back to the Sam Adams version, but it's still a great beer. Drinkability factor is crazy, I actually had to crack a second one during this review because I drank the first one faster than expected."

"Price Point - $1.67/12 oz bottle"
"Less than $9 for a six pack makes this a steal. Once again, Sierra Nevada puts out a very solid beer that has wide distribution. Magical. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Check it out. Easy to find and cheap, and a good counterpoint to so many ""generally bitter"" IPAs around. Goes for, and finds, a distinct flavor."

"A very well done amber ale. Big hop notes blend very well with the different malts used. Something I could certainly enjoy a 6-pack of."

"Ruby red in color with an orange hue and a slight chill haze. Poured with a short off white foam that reduced to a soapy cap that left wet lacings on the glass. Slightly pungent hop aromas up front with ripe orange and pineapple. Pine hop aromas, sugary sweet caramel malt and spicy hop aromas from the middle to the end. Medium bodied with an initially thin feel until the rich tangy carbonation rolls through. Caramel malt flavor down the middle with pine hops on the edges. Pine hops transition to mellow rule citrus flavors through the middle with sugary sweet notes in tow. Finishes with ripe  citrus fruit sweetness and delicate, lingering pine hop bitterness. Thoroughly enjoyed the complex flavors and aromas of this one."
""
""
"O - Something a little different than what I'm used to, and I love it. Very smooth, creamy, and sweet with a little bitterness to balance it out."
""
""

"overall; this is one of the best beers I've tried in months and i'd say the best seasonal beer I've had. bought one in a mixed packs and plan on buying a couple of six packs of just this. really, really balanced, easy to drink, and delicious. get it!!!"
"O: Good maltiness paired with earthy hops. Appropriate for the fall season. An above average Red IPA but not quite a fridge staple."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - nice IPA"
""
"O: Apparently, I liked this one much better than most on here. While this does not a the level of Nugget Nectar, I personally find it much more drinkable. Excellent!"
""
"This was disappointing for me. It's a fine beer and all but for Sierra Nevada I really expect much more. The taste of this is very simple mostly citrusy hops with a very subdued malt presence. This just isn't dynamic or anything the flavor isn't bad but it isn't good either. The bare minimum of what I expect from an IPA. I was really sad when I tried this because I was expecting something amazing like Sierra Nevada's celebration ale. Try it out, you might like it more than I do."
""
"The aroma is standard IPAish as I get citrusy hops for the most part and bits of sweet caramel malt and a little bit of breadiness. Taste is the same, mostly citric hops with a touch of spice, little bit of breadiness makes for fuller mouthfeel and then sweetness adds balanced. Overall, about a medium-bodied IPA that has a crisp finish. A good IPA that for lack of explanation I just found a bit off/underwhelming so not one of my top picks."
""
""
""
"Apperance is a deep auburn with a brownish tint. Generous head upon pour, about 2 1/2 fingers. As it recedes, it leaves a heavy layer of lace. The aroma starts with piney hops. Very aromatic, but sadly not getting too much of the Citra influence in the nose. The pine hop notes are followed by a strong malt profile which presents some caramel and bread. Taste is hop forward with floral notes along with some citrus and pine. The malt backbone comes through next and features some toasted notes. Moderate bitterness towards the end. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium body. Overall, a nice IPA from Sierra Nevada, in the vein of their other IPA hop profiles. I was a little let down by the fact that the taste didn't match the juiciness I expected from the description. Either way, tasty brew and great value."

"2.75 overall."
"Update: Much higher for appearance. Huge off white head with good retention and great lacing."
""
"Flipside Red IPA is a very good product overall and while I don’t rank it among my Sierra Nevada top 5, it is still much better than the average beer and a product I recommend."
"Pours a deep a reddish brown with a frumpy tan head with excellent retention. Aromas are very hoppy, with a lot of orange and grapefruit notes, and malty aromas reminiscent of caramel and cocoa. The bitter notes dominate the front palate before a toffee like sweetness enter the middle. Finishes with a taste of chocolate covered orange peel. Very very tasty. Medium full body is very satisfying. I like this a lot and intend to buy more."
""
""
""
"O: would have liked more malt sweetness for balance, hop presence is powerful"
""
"O: Bored to tears with this one. There is a pattern to all of the Sierra Nevada beers. Dank and bitter pine and bready malt. This one included. This is just like a cross between Ruthless Rye and Tumbler to me. This beer should've been a heck of a lot maltier for a red ale or red IPA. The best part of the beer was the impeccable pour. Other than that, drink a Green Flash Hop Head Red or a Troegs Nugget Nectar for a real red IPA experience."
"O-The finish was the worst part. The nose was misleading. Just left wishing for more."
""

"There is a reason why my blood is red: because this stuff is coursing through my veins. Big fan. BIG BIG fan. Not one to usually care much about the appearance of the beer, but this one is a nice red color and the color indicates a complexity of malt compounds present, which contribute nicely to the important attribute: THE FLAVOR. Oh, the flavor! This beer grew out of the Earth, just like I did, and the taste is there to prove it. There is grain in this bottle, and it feeds and sustains you. There are hops in this bottle. They awaken your face and mind. There is yeast in this bottle. And now it's inside you, alive and teeming. You are no longer a purely human/Neanderthal mixture. Now you are part yeast. Its DNA is now in your DNA, in the nucleus of every cell in your body."

"The Verdict: Very good. A tasty seasonal IPA with a sweet malt backbone to balance out the quality hops. Did I mention balanced? Earthy, sweet, hoppy, and malty, there isn’t much missing from this one."

"O=My scores reflect what I think IPA lovers like, and this is very much an IPA (which is my least favorite style)...any characteristics of a ""red"" or ""amber"" ale were lost...it was tolerable to me...which means IPA lovers should at least like this beer...if not love it. But, it didn't really stand out as being any different than any of the million other IPA's in the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: At about a month and a half old Flipside Red IPA is tasting great and I might just invest in a sixer before the seasons over. I can see this style becoming much more popular in the near future. The casual complexity makes for a great drinking experience. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
"Medium mouthfeel with a light oily hop texture. Overall, I really like this brew. It's not quite an IPA, but close enough. Nice to have something different that is still tasty."
""
""
"O-not impressed. More of a red ale than a red IPA, and just an okay red ale at that."
""
""
""
""
"Thankfully, the alcohol wasn't that pronounced and fit in well with this style of beer. Had this been a bit more aggressive and red, this could have really been an outstanding beer. As is, this was a nice alternative to the seasonals that are currently available but just a bit of a letdown. Fine for an afternoon with some pigskin on the tube but given a choice, I'd probably take the Tumbler over this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not as good as the wet hop series but on par with the Torpedo IPA. Not sure if I would get it again though."
""
""
""
""
"Another solid offering from Sierra Nevada, but not very distinctive. I prefer the Tumbler over this one. I would consider this more of a hoppy amber style than an IPA, but styles are open to some interpretation. Overall, this is worth trying."
""
"O: Easy to drink and quite enjoyable, more of an IPA than a Red/Amber in my opinion but I am totally OK with that as it matched very well with my bacon cheese burger"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Good solid amber/red, the hopping will attract hop heads and the malt body caters to fans of the amber/red style. Would definitely recommend. Sierra Nevada might not always impress craft beer enthusiasts but I would argue that they are a solid all around brewery, and the price is always right!"
""
"The hop flavor is in perfect contrast, rising crisp and sharp with dry grass, grapefruit and Carmel."

""

""
"I love this beer. It has a great red hue, a very fragrant smell (nice and hoppy), and is quite good. I am a big fan of IPAs in general and like a good bitter beer. The one thing I don't always like about some IPAs is that after I finish it I feel like I could use a glass of water. This one has the great flavor, smell, and a terrific finish."
""
"Flipside offers a wonderful combination of hops, but lacks some of the malt depth I would prefer to move this to the next level. That said I would enjoy having this beer on hand."
"D: A very nice Red IPA with loads of hop character and solid biscuit malt base to balance. Really good as to be expected from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a standard IPA; I appreciated the bitter finish. It's one of those beers you just crack open on a week night!"
""
"Overall: A nice red IPA. Certainly a cross between Torpedo (Citra) and Celebration (Centennial) with a Simoce twist!"
""
"O: I’ll take this over Tumbler any day, and hey, fill the body out a little more and I might just have a new go-to from Sierra Nevada. As it stands, though, this beer is leaning more towards a session ale, and that’s alright – it’s quite refreshing."
""
"Nicely balanced as to be expected. The hop profile is unique for Sierra Nevada and they do it well. Not stellar, but drinkable in spades."
" The taste is very good, dark red grapefruit with a hop flavor which is very fresh and has slight herbal bitter flavor with a light caramel taste from the malt and a mild alcohol taste with residual bitterness as it finishes. Overall a great IPA, SN does a good job with amber ales, this is no exception -it has a similarity to Celebration and Beer Camp Bloodshot which puts it in good company, very flavorful!"
"Medium bodied, this beer is unassuming but good. Finishes dry."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good hoppy red and another solid Sierra beer."
""
""
""
"Pours a perfectly clear reddish color with a size able foam topping. Plenty of lace is left behind in the pint glass. Aroma of caramelized malt, grapefruit, pine and herbs. Nice IPA like nose with perhaps a bit more sweetness than your typical example of the style. In the taste, pine and pith from aggressive hopping of fine hops. Caramel and toast round out a complimentary malt base. The brew is bittersweet, leaning towards bitter and citrus in the finish. Medium bodied, full flavored ale. Overall this is a smooth, dangerously drinkable IPA/red ale. Bought a case and it was a solid investment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fairly complex, but somewhat muddled. The malt character takes on an almost overly kilned flavor, which detracts a bit from the experience. A bit overly bitter and resiny for my palate, and I'm not a simcoe fan."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Another highly enjoyable Sierra Nevada brew. I would have expected nothing else."
""
""
"O: A nice fall seasonal. I have this ranked ahead of Tumbler though I still will miss that beer. Sierra Nevada remains one of the few breweries in which I'll buy any of their beers blindly and this one does not disappoint."
"O: Outstanding beer! Excellent for the cooling weather or for a hop head looking for a different take! Only complaint is how thin it get as it finishes but it doesn't detract much. Makes it even more dangerously drinkable! Definitely needs to be experienced and enjoyed!"
""
""
""
""
"Fresh bottle into a tulip. Pours a clear crimson with lasting head. Smells like it was brewed for optimal shelf life. Hoppy in an ambiguous way, kind of leafy and earthy but also faintly fruity; generally very bland. Plenty of crystal malt, too. Smells like a Sierra beer, basically. Very identifiable but also completely unexciting. I'd elaborate on the flavor, but it pretty much tastes exactly how I've described the aroma. Loads of caramel malt and heavily boiled hops with a mineral finish. About as exciting as any other hoppy Sierra beer, ie. not even slightly fucking exciting. I can't even be bothered to finish a 12oz bottle of this mediocrity."
""
""
""
""
"Somewhere between Celebration Ale, Torpedo and a nice amber ale for me. The hops feel fresh and inviting as it seems they always are from Sierra Nevada. A solid addition to their lineup."
""
""
"This is a great beer, I'm glad SN added it to the fleet, it's a nice variation on their standard hoppy goodness. I do wish that this was a little... brasher, this is is a great tasty drinkable beer. I am a fan of Tumbler, but with some caramel malt toastiness and hops, this is another great welcome fall offering- a great hoppy alternative to the plethora of Oktoberfest and pumpkin blah."
"A six dressed up as a nine, it's far from my favorite SN seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good new addition to the Sierra Nevada seasonal lineup that I really enjoyed and look forward to having every year. Glad this is listed under ""American Amber/Red Ale"" as it meets halfway between that style and a traditional Sierra Nevada IPA. A solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice mahogany color, good head/lacing. Aromas of grain, citrusy hops, and caramel. Tons of citrus fruit flavor--grapefruit, orange, tangerine. Mango, too. Nice balance of malt to keep it extremely drinkable. Nice all around and this won't be the last sixer I pick up."
""
"This is a beer I would certainly drink more often if it was available year round. As a fan of Sierra Nevada, Flipside is a great change of of pace from the more straightforward IPAs that I'm partial to. With a somewhat more citrusy but less bitter flavor, this beer is enjoyable and smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I'm very impressed with this one. It might be my favorite SN to date. Reminds me of Nugget Nectar. But not quite to that level. But close."
"An interesting beer but I'd need a few more to really say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass a very nice amber color, nice carbonation, with a small off-white head, with alot of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a very nice touch of hops, citrus, caramel. The taste is slightly bitter, alittle sweetness, malty, and some hop/citrus notes. Medium body, with a nice little bitter/dry finish. Overall a pretty tasty brew, would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A nice little change up from all the Oktoberfest I've been guzzling down of late. I could see myself reaching for this seasonal again..."
"Overall- Above average. If you're a fan of Sierra Nevada (like I am), you're probably going to try it no matter what a reviewer writes. This you could pass on though. No flaws, just quotidian."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really liked this red IPA!"
""
"Overall a very nice addition to the Marzens and Pumpkin Ales associated with autumn."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent hoppy amber ale. What with red, white and black IPAs, I wonder what they'll come up with next? Check this out!"
""
"Overall, an average beer. Definitely not of of Sierra Nevada's best offerings. Glad I tried it, but also glad I only bought a single. It's easy to drink, but certainly nothing memorable. I'm surprised they used 3 hops in this beer. I believe I can taste the simcoe, but I'm not sure I detect the other varietals."
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid red IPA but there other choices in the style segment that I would pick first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid Red / IPA. It is limited a bit by the fact that the flavors don't seem to function together seamlessly."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Foamy head, and plenty of thick lacing. Nose is bready with pine and wood. Earthy and woody character consisting of hearty malt, bitter pecan shells, and some pine. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, more of a hoppy nutty amber than what I would call an IPA of any color."
"O - A pretty damn good addition to the SN line. This has classic SN flavors yet still retains its own personality. I would recommend getting some soon while it's at optimal freshness! I hope they keep this around, and their concept of ""in between seasons"" beers is really intriguing."
""
"This is far better than I expected, and makes an excellent Fall thirst quencher."
"Tasty brew!"
"O: Solid. I was somewhat reluctant to shell out $18 (after tax & deposit) on an unknown 12-pack, but knowing Sierra Nevada, I figured the risk/reward assessment was fairly balanced, and sure enough, I'm pleased with this beer. It's no Nugget Nectar, but a nice Fall IPA. I predict the 11 beers left from the 12-pack won't last long in my fridge. . . ."

""
""
""
"Overall, a different, interesting beer. Not my favorite SN offering, but certainly in no way bad."
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems to be more about the Centennial than the Citra or Simcoe. I would have liked a bit more of a fruity hop character from those, but on the other hand the spiciness of the hop profile here fits the season pretty well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Do you love hops? You will love this beer. I only wish there was a way to find out when this beer was brewed. I'm drinking it on the East Coast and it was brewed on the West Coast but it tastes so fresh it is crazy. It's very delicious and I highly recommend drinking it."
"Overall this is another winner from Sierra Nevada. The label art and name seem to suggest that this brew is a sequel to their ""Ruthless Rye"". Well Sierra Nevada has succeeded in creating a quality end of summer IPA."
""
"Like many of SIerra Nevada's brewings, the foundation of the beer is practically the same with minor changes. My only concern is if the changes are enough to warrant a whole new brand of beer. The fruits are definitely prevalent but the similarity is uncanny."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: pretty good beer, has a very distinctive sierra nevada taste to it."
""
""
"For a hoppy red ale the hops really don't stand out though it is well crafted and balanced. The herbal and pungent hops don't pop out as much as the fruity, spicy complexity of the 'red' malt. It's a decent quaff but nothing to get too excited about."
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer. The aroma is excellent, but there seems to be something of an incongruity between that and the taste (as well as the mouthfeel). Not a bad beer by any measure, but not everything seems to work together for me."
""
"Overall, the more I consume, the more I like it. I DEFINITELY like it replacing Tumbler. It reminds me of a cross between Torpedo and Ruthless Rye. A nice beer that works and will be consistent in the rotation when it arrives each year. The 6.2% is nice as well which provides the opportunity for multiples."
""
""
"Overall another one I'll be picking up more of and enjoying this season. Has the hop profile Sierra Nevada is known for with more malt than their IPA's. Give it a go."
"Mouthfeel is nice and thick. Overall, nice beer."
"In short, a great brew that I'm already looking to go grab again and enjoy."
""
""
""
"Def a bet worth drinking s few of. Especially at the price"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute. Half inch head. Slightly red honey-color when held up to a bright light. Wonderful aroma, complex, with citrus and hops. Flavor is quite good, but not quite as complex as the aroma would suggest. Definitely an IPA. Mouthfeel is good, medium full. Overall I like this--not as much as Torpedo or SN Stout, but those are different styles."
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a vague malty character to start, which, like the aroma, is superseded by the citrus and floral hops. Moderately bitter. I found it to be pretty decent but their Torpedo would be my first IPA choice from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a deep clear ruby, topped with a thick off-white head. Great retention and sticky lacing. The aroma smells fresh and dank, with some pine notes and a tangy underpinning of bready malt and light tropical fruit character. The taste has a bite to it of zesty citrus and resins, which spreads lightly herbal and tropical notes out across the palate. The malts definitely have a presence here but aren’t overly intrusive on the hops, with a mix of caramel sweetness and doughy notes. Bitter and piney on the finish with some lingering herbal and malt flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied overall with an easy feeling creaminess to the carbonation. There is a touch of warmth here but those herbal and oily textures from the hops really keep this smooth. This was a nice hoppy Red Ale, with just the right mix of robust flavors that I really enjoy in the style. Perfect for fall drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall feels like a shade above a 4; more of a treat that a typical standby"
""
"Overall: To me, it's a tossup between the Tumbler and this one, the Tumber being a bit too sweet in my opinion but still being a great brown ale and this one offering great flavors but nothing really being that memorable for me. Both are very good beers that are almost excellent."
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, Flipside is another great brew from Sierra Nevada. Glad to have this beer in the seasonal rotation. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Candied citrus bomb! Extremely balanced and juicy. Effin' good!!"
""
"O - I really don't know what SN were trying to accomplish with FlipSide. But we are done with SN's summer offering and its still a little early to enjoy a brown ale on a cool Autumn evening. The answer? FlipSide Red IPA. Just bc what we think is summer and vacations are gone doesn't mean the hot weather is. Not just yet. In comes FlipSide and just at the right time. I will admit that I hope Tumbler remains their Fall Seasonal, but hey! If you want to keep your 4 seasonals and add an in between brew while we wait for the next then it puts a smile on my face. The Seasonal between the Seasonals. FlipSide is worth the try and an instant Sierra Nevada classic"
""
""
""
"Easy to drink, I like the maltyness of this, a nice change of pace"
""
"Though I like a dry finish to any IPA, the sharp hop flavor and poignant bitterness is abrupt and aggressive- not because of its reckless use of hops, but instead because of its lack of proper malt support. Still, the ale is a refreshing IPA that begs for pizza pairing."
""
""
"Thankfully there's much more of a hop presence in the flavor. On the fuller end of medium bodied with a blast of dry, bitter hops that linger over the sweet and spicy malt notes into a sticky, dry finish. Dank and resinous with grass and pine needle flavor as well as some subtle grapefruit and citrus rind. This is countered by a sweet malt backbone that has a strong caramel flavor. There's also some toffee, bread, faint dark fruit sweetness and. a spicy rye component that nicely compliments the hop profile. Well balanced and easy to drink. A nice hoppy beer for the fall season."
"O - Does Sierra Nevada ever brew a bad beer? They may not have the best in any specific category, but everything they brew just seems to be solid and drinkable. This one is no exception."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a fine two finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of piney and citrus hops, light caramel malt and a hint of citrus fruit. Flavor follows with a nice sweet caramel malt body with grassy and piney hops, finishing with light generic hops and some citrus. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Nicely balanced and a good light red ale with nothing that really stands out. I would have this again, but would probably look for one of the the more bold options if I was specifically looking for a red."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A fine medium strength red IPA. Delivers just what the season calls for. Not quite as hoppy as Torpedo, but the gorgeous copper color and huge light beige head makes up for it by adding psychological flavor. Drinkable and sessionable. Hard to imagine a better replacement for Tumbler, if that's what this is intended to be. A happy choice for my 150th BA review and 600th Beer Karma point."
""
""
""
""
"Nice! Interesting tweaner brew between late summer-early fall. Description on the carton reeled me in. Very interesting mix in my opinion tastes like a mesh up between an amber from an established Michigan brewery and a SN pale ale... and it works. To me was a little too heavy in the mouth for either an amber or an IPA. A great addition to the fall lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Certainly not the worst amber I've tried, but has a few rough edges. Drinkable, but could have been better."
""
"Like most Sierra Nevada brews, very well made and good to the last drop."
""
"O- Pretty good brew but I preferred the Imperial Red that came in the Beer Camp pack. A more vibrant brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid beer, good flavors but, what really is the point of this release? Has a celebration and torpedo flavor mix in with the hops, malts and spices. Is this a primer to get us ready for celebration? There's nothing new, special or unique about this beer, other then its drinkable and has good flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I quite like this and like seeing a new seasonal from an established brewery."
""
""
""
""
"I don't know what makes this an IPA. Sierra Nevada tends to brew them on the maltier side, but Torpedo and Celebration are still fine examples of the style. Flipside is not. Decent enough beer, but the concept reeks of false advertising and phony ""IPA"" marketing. (3)"

Or my choice, Why? Color is uninspiring red. Smells and tastes slightly bitter hops, not very drinkable and rather poor mouthfeel. The good is that I only paid $1.49 and I only got one. Waste of time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just another good beer from Sierra Nevada. No surprise here. This was even better than the same kind I had on Labor Day that I did not rate. Would try it again."
"Overall: Passable, not my favorite take on the style.  Too much roast/pine astringency clashing were I prefer caramel/citrus for this style. (3.6)"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Sierra Nevada has set a high bar with everything they do, but I was slightly underwhelmed by this one. As an amber ale, it's pretty good. As a ""red IPA"" it's pretty average."

"This beer is a great idea that was executely poorly. On paper this should be a hit. 3 of my favorite hop varieties together with a Sierra Nevada pedigree. It's not even ""meh"" it's not good at all. I will say the mouthfeel was very good which is typical of SN brews."

"A good beer but still feel a little disappointed. Good value."
"Pours into a standard pint glass a deep amber/tawny with a great looking billowing light beige head atop,great color and a great head,it just looks like fall.Aromas of citric hops and nutty malt with light caramel sweetness.The palate is alot like aromas with a good shot of citric hops intertwined with nutty maltiness with a little brown sugar in the finish.A solid hoppy amber ale,I could drink quite a few of these this fall."

"Overall great beer gets a really good complex flavor of Amber and Ipa in my opinion and should be tried by lovers of both."
""
"O- A solid beer. Nothing wrong with it all but its nothing new. Tastes very much like a Sierra Nevada beer which is a good thing but again, its nothing new."
""
"T: Very smooth, balancing some light piny hops with caramel malt. Again, the bready and caramel malt flavors are a bit too prominent for me and this shows more of the red side than the IPA side. Toasted malt, light pine resin, grapefruit pith. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. A good beer, but not a great one."
"In the end, the aroma is quite exciting. The flavor is nice, but could be more exciting."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a medium brown color with an inch of thick head. Some lacing. The aroma is a mix of citrus and piney hops. Caramel malts and bread. The taste is orange peel with some piney hops. More of the bread and caramel malts. Citrus peel at the finish. Nice amount of bitterness tthroughout. Oily mouthfeel with some hints of alcohol heat. Overall, its a solid hoppy Amber and a welcome addition to Sierra Nevada's seasonal rotation."

"This is an IPA for sure but build upon a unique backbone of malts, which really isn't evident in the flavor. It tastes like an IPA and I like that. It is a good beer, but not really much of a red ale."
""
"Despite expectations I would still say this is a fine beer and worth trying. The overall quality is here and you know right away it's a Sierra Nevada beer. The malts and hop bitterness are well balanced and it's very drinkable."
""
""
"Pours a clear copper color, khaki colored head fades to a thin ring, few splotches of lace. Smell: dried tropical fruit, grapefruit, sharp pine, slightly catty, slightly fruity and brown sugary in the back. Taste: caramel, grapefruit, piney, nectarine towards the finish. Oily, carb pushes to creamy then too far to over carbed, then fades back to oily again. Pretty good, kind of fits an early fall season."
"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost ~$9 so $1.49 per bottle. Dark orange/red color, super huge head which is one thing Sierra Nevada never fails at. The beers always seem to be carbonated just right and have a good mouthfeel. It sort of looks like Celebration. Aroma is hops, pine, honey, pine, tree sap. Flavor is bitter, hoppy, lemons? This is a really subtle but well done beer which is no surprise from Sierra Nevada. Their beers rarely slap you in the face but its hard to say they aren't well-rounded. I went back for another sixer."
""
"O - good sweet flavors with lighter citrus hop qualities. Standard decent sierra brew"
"Overall a solid new seasonal from Sierra Nevada. Not all I hoped when I read it was brewed with whole cone Simco and Citra, but still delicious none of the less. Going to look forward to seeing this again next year"
""

"I have been late to the party on this one, an excellent new seasonal from sierra Nevada. the pour is clear and radiant almost ruby red, its that bright. the head is just off white and very dense, it leaves some lacing as it drinks too. aromas of dryer red malt, fresh hay, jolly rancher candies, and some citric hops explode from the glass. its complex for a red beer, and just as hoppy as I was hoping for it to be. the taste doesn't get much of the candy stuff, just a hint of artificial fruit sweetness I can only attribute to the grains. the hops are more bitter than flavorful, which hurts this in my opinion. it has a kick at the end too, like a kiss of rye malt was added, but that's all speculation. fuller bodied yet still refreshing, they did an great job with this and I cant wait to score a sixer at the store and evaluate it more thoroughly. perfect for fall."

"Enjoyable. Smells great, tastes good."

"Picked up a six pack of this stuff yesterday for 9 bucks (!) Pours a nice amber color, a bit darker than your typical amber, but it looks really nice. Pretty good head. Very clear. Smell is a little more subtle than I was expecting, but it's a nice melony, slightly skunky smell that you can get with citra in the mix. Not what you typically find in an amber, but it's interesting and it works. Taste was very good. Again, I'm a little partial to that classic cascadey taste in an amber, but this is a nice change up. Mouthfeel is excellent! It's got a nice smooth, slipperiness to it, that I really like. All told, a unique and tasty American amber ale that you should try if you dig that style of beer. Good stuff!"

"This beer looks amazing. It has this incredibly vibrant caramel-ruby hue with a nice lacing. There’s a fantastic aroma to it—I can tell it’s fresh because the hops are just vibrant. I pick up a bit of pine and grapefruit that’s overshadowed by a sticky, dank, resiny note and held together with a caramelly-malty backbone. The aroma profile carries over to the flavor, with a smooth and surprisingly mellow bitterness lending some complexity to the lingering sticky-green-malty taste. It's good stuff. a little malty, kinda catty, slightly dank... it’s solid and scratches that itch, and for the price it’s a steal. One I will definitely seek out again."
"Outweighing the factors, this is not as drinkable as I'd like it to be. I'd sooner have Celebration than have another bottle of this anytime soon. The hoppy profile gets lost in between the dry, gritty malty character, in spite of the fact that this shows flavors I haven't quite seen before in a hoppy amber ale. Not a bad choice from the Fall, but a little too heavy and lacking of refreshing characteristics I enjoy in the style. Not a misstep by SN, but definitely below what they're capable of doing."
""
""
"The flavor profile will be familiar to anyone who has had one of SN's pale ale offerings. In a nutshell, it could be described as a maltier SNPA. Dry and moderately hoppy from start to finish. Slick mouthfeel with soft, smooth carbonation. Fundamentally, it's a good beer, but it's boring and not all that distinguishable from SN's ever-growing hoppy beer catalog."
""
""
""
"Nice citrus hop nose, piney with a bit caramel. On the heavy side of being medium bodied. Good malt foundation and brisk carbonation. Caramel and toasty sweet malts hide below waves of big juicy citrusy hops. Big bright bitter finish but not overly so. Good beer. Nothing to stand out-ish but it is good. I can see this beer going bad very quickly as the big malt body will taste pretty bad on its own once those hops start to fade."
""
""
"Lovely copper color, clear body, and two finger thick foamy head made the pour look good in a mug. The aroma was not as hoppy as expected, which did have the benefit of some nutty, caramel malts show through. The taste was also a good deal sweeter than a typical IPA at first, with syrupy first impression. Upon staying longer in the mouth, the beer suddenly seemed to start to get citric, and the finish was quite bitter, with a drawn-out aftertaste. Quite a bit more complex than the first impression, but let down a little by a watery feel."

"Overall – A very enjoyable brew and one I will certainly go to over and over again."
""
"Overall, this is a very good beer that is more of a hoppy red masquerading as a ""red IPA"" on its label. I'm a little sad that this is going to replace Tumbler as the fall seasonal, but it being a good beer helps to soften the blow."
"O: Every time I sample a new Sierra Nevada beer, I always expect it to be at least solid - and this is, more than that actually. I also don't expect them to blow me away - and it doesn't. It's exactly what I expect from them, and that's a hoppy, well-crafted brew with no mind-blowing moments or unexpected twists. Basically, good everyday beer for the fall weather."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: Very ""Sierra Nevada""-like beer. Seems to have a house flavor. I'm not complaining. I love it. However, I don't see much of a range in their beers. Other than Bigfoot and Celebration none of their hoppy offerings seem all that different. Not complaining, just noting. If it's available, I'll have it again."
""
""
""
"O - 4 - It's not bad, but it's not great by any means. I'd much rather have a Hop Head Red or a Red Rocket Ale. If I just wanted hops I'd get an American IPA or IIPA."
"Amazing addition to Sierra's seasonal lineup. This beer looks like a red ale, drinks like a black IPA, and finishes like a pale ale. Sierra's done well with this one."

"O: Packs a good punch of flavor for being only a hair over 6% ABV. Heard it's replacing the Tumbler. Now three of the four seasons are hopped up beers. Would have rather kept Tumbler and replaced Summerfest. But I don't make those calls."
""
""
""
"This may not be the most explosive or impressive amber, but it's got great qualities and is in such an easy to drink package, and I am a sucker for a good red amber ale, and this delivers the goods."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear dark amber color with a thick, pillowy head that leaves drippy sheets on the glass. Hoppy aromas, herbal and resinous. Dark, woody, and earthy. Oily, spicy hop flavors over a dark malt sweetness and some tea. Juicy citrus and pine sap. Medium-plus body, bitter, and properly carbonated to keep it highly drinkable. A well crafted hoppy beer, as expected from Sierra Nevada."

"O/D-I enjoy this beer. Great hop selection. Tumbler is legit but this is a viable alternative."
""
""
""
"O- A little less smooth than some of the other beers i have had featuring the Citra hop. Pretty intense bitterness and weak malt leads to some imbalance. Solid but not great."

"O - An interesting Red IPA, but I think I like a hoppy red because there is more balance. Worth a try."
""
""
"O: Considering I dislike amber beers and amber IPAs, this is pretty damn good. It has a nice bitterness/citrus balance, but I find this style (red IPAs) to have a sort of abrasive aspect to it. Definitely worth trying, but the fact that it's knocking out Tumbler as the autumn seasonal greatly disappoints me. As a red IPA, this is pretty decent, but as a fall seasonal? Give me a nice toasty brown ale please."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very solid hoppy red that isn't quite as good as something like, oh say, Tocobaga but since I can't get any CCB here in Louisiana it'll do."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My new favorite lower-priced IPA? Like SN Torpedo, this certainly puts many higher priced IPAs to shame. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: SN does not disappoint when it comes to IPAs. This is no exception, as the hops shine even with the maltiness of an amber. The sweetness of the malts really compliment the tropical and citrusy notes from the hops. Worthy of a purchase if you enjoy SN's IPAs"
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of earthy malt and grain, tropical fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that definitely has citrus and tropical aspects as described but there is an underlying earthiness that is battling for attention in the aroma and flavor."
""
""
"Recommendation is in the air. It's worthy at $1.90/12oz, but not to buy a 12pk of. SN has done and will do better."
"I never thought I wouldn't highly enjoy a beer hopped up with Citra, Simcoe, and Centennial. It's not bad, but it's not as interesting as one would expect. Reguardless if I enjoy it or not, the craftsmanship is clearly always there with Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Its departs from the Cascade signature that makes up their Pale Ale, but the Citra/Simcoe/Centennial additions really don't amount to much more then just light notes from each hop variety. It's less tropical then the description indicates and has a sort of Ruthless Rye malty profile but minus the actual rye spice that makes that beer so great. Overall, just a solid hoppy SN beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: I liked this one a lot for sure. It comes in just a half a tick below my favorite hoppy SN ofeerings like Hoptimum, Ruthless Rye, and celebration though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - If you know Sierra Nevada well, I think you'll have a pretty good idea of what this will taste like before you even take a sip. This is classic SN, not straying far from the hop profile that has brought them all their amazing success. As a result, it's not so unique from their core line-up, unfortunately. I've heard rumor this is replacing the Tumbler Brown as their fall seasonal; if so, disappointing. Tumbler was at least a change of pace from their mainstays. I see this as no more than their Torpedo with a bit of roasted malt as a change-up. It's good, yes, but all too similar. Following this up with their Celebration just means more of the same."

"Overall a very quality and easy drinking IPA from Sierra Nevada. Fans of rye will really like this one."

"I'd say this one is definitely right for this time of year. Nice job to Sierra Nevada for concocting this gem."
"Overall, another very nice hoppy offering from Sierra. This reminds me a bit of Ruthless, but more balanced and a touch lighter. I'm sure I'll be drinking quite a few of these over the next few weeks. A welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada line."
"Good overall flavor. A nice early fall beer. A nice sub to all the Oktoberfest beers that spew forth around now. Nice red/amber color. A nice spicy fruity smell. Yet it says on the bottle a Tropical citrusy hoppy flavor. It is hoppy, a little bitter and definitely Sierra Nevada. Not tropical and not too citrusy. But do not get me wrong a good solid beer. If you want a nice late summer fall offering and are tired if all the oktoberfests (that seem to get more watered down each year) then pick this up!"

"Super fresh, Noticed at the grocery store and knew it was just released. The description promised tropical fruit, and with the Citra I thought that there would be. Instead, the nose was a danker version of celebration. It was a really good beer, but still classic Sierra Nevada. Nice and bitter and smooth, just hoping for something a little different."
""
""
""
"overall, a solid beer from Sierra Nevada. Not exactly like the description says, but it is tasty. Maybe a little unbalanced, the bitterness lingers a little too long, kind of hides the malt presence, but I can tell this is going to actually age well (a few months i mean)."
""
"o - A solid beer I will be drinking this all season. Sierra Nevada rarely disappoints!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid pint right there, perhaps my favorite Red IPA to date. Hops come from a different angle than most American IPAs. Plenty of room for more assertive hop bitterness that would shy from being too one sided. Malt plays a great role in this beer though and this is quite drinkable."
""
""
"Overall a damn fine beer with no defects of any sort. Might as well buy two six packs because you will want to finish them both the same night."
