Taste follows the nose, very well balanced, grassy & citrusy, sweet in the middle, yet finishes dry but I still get something slightly metallic at the end.  Feel is right where it should be for the style.  I like hoppy reds and overall this is super easy drinking and I enjoy it quite a bit.","adapt313","Mar 01, 2015"

May just be my favorite Red Ale.  Jai Alai and some of the other Cigar's are very abundant here. I didn't know about this and wasn't looking for it.  It took a while to stumble upon it.  When, I finally did, it was at a large gas station, that is 70% dedicated to craft beer.  Times are a-changin'.","DavidBart","Dec 30, 2014"

3.86,-6.1,4,3.5,4,3.75,4,"A very ruddy red ale, with hints of orange in the pour that overweigh the browns, this is a sugary‚Äînear syrupy‚Äî red that nonetheless is well-composed enough to escape any miring, in its thickness; instead it even offers limited, though by no means leaden, refreshment via its boozy, well-bittered flavor-profile.  It is, foremost, definitely a sticky-ass beer; nonetheless, it boasts decent complexity, and does a very nice job finishing, hitting the hoppy acids hard and late on the tongue.  Aromatic oils have been mostly boiled-out, however, so the nose possesses a distinct malt-winey nose that's a bit heavier, even, than most of the other good deep-reds I've tried; any retention of citric or floral oils is expressed through the aforementioned ‚Äústickiness,‚Äù which is much sappier, woodier, or otherwise more vegetal than a drinker  might expect, even from a big red like this.  Overall, it works, but it's nonetheless less flexible or for-all-seasons than most entrants in my red-ale wheelhouse; I believe it is, in large part, a function of this being a very straight-up red: not especially or aggressively hoppy, seemingly without any late-stage or dry hopping to add any fresh-hopped notes, and not hedging at all with an adjunct element like rye to add spiciness or crunch to the big-body of the swirly-thick malts.  Still, it's good, and certainly fairly fecund‚Äîwhich I guess is the intellectual link between the beer, its name, and the premising patter printed on the side of the can.","OrestesMethuon","Nov 05, 2014"

A lot of orange juice and some mango. A bit of caramel. Taste follows the nose. A nice breadiness in there, although the malty sweetness is a tad overwhelming. Very sharp bitterness. It could be a bit harsh and lingers for a little while. Mouthfeel is pretty good, if a little thick. Overall a very good amber. The hop profile is very similar to Jai Alai, but maybe less on the tropical fruit side. It reminds me of a tamer version of Arrogant Bastard.","MisSigsFan","Nov 02, 2014"

This ale pours a handsome amber red color With a generous frothy white head that lasts throughout the pour. It leaves a decent amount of lacing. The nose is balanced with a tremendous amount of hops and a very nice amount of malt. It is sweet but bitter all at once. The body is medium in nature with a lot of coating of hoppy resin and sweet malts. The flavor begins with an ipas generosity of hops followed by the sweet balance of roasty malts. This is a delicious ale with an almost unheard of amount of balance. Thus is a greatly crafted ale from a brewer that is quickly impressing me more and more.","lochef81","Mar 18, 2014"

3.84,-6.6,3.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, suspended sediment filled, amber-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, sparse surface coating of head. Aromas of tangy sweetness, tropical fruit sweetness, and some floral hops characteristics. Flavors are tangy sweet forward, with a caramel backbone and tart grapefruit and pineapple blend, as well as some earthy notes, bitter and spiced hops profiles, and bready characteristics. Very layered and deep, especially for the style. Tasty beer. The body is full, which I was expecting after watching it pour and settle. It also leaves a decent lacing behind on the glass. The aftertaste leans more towards an IPA, with tropical fruit, heavy on the grapefruit and pineapple, bitterness, and pepper spices. The finish is slick and slightly dry, with bitter and subtle richly sweet notes. This is a bit rough around the edges, but I like it a lot.","GarthDanielson","0"

Notes of caramel malts come through the hop profile as well. The taste starts with some candied malt notes and is followed by some fruity notes of tangerine and citrus as well as some piney notes. The bitterness builds but is not over the top. The mouthfeel is well carbonated with moderate body. Overall, solid beer with nice balance between assertive hops and sweet malts.","homebrew311","Jan 11, 2014"

Faint citrus hop adds a touch of underlying bitterness but for the most part the sweetness overrides this and linger slightly. Very clean finish and smooth beer. Wish it showed a little less dark fruit. Along with the hop finish slightly dried toast flavor to help dry it out. A very clean and very drinkable beer though. Good but nothing to write home about. The alcohol is very deceptive as you cant taste it at all and it could easily pass as a 5% ABV brew.","jtierney89","Jun 27, 2013"

Taste of caramel malt and toffee, piney hops, citrus pith, somewhat metallic in the finish. Pretty average even for the style, but still a good brew. Probably overrated just because it's CC. Medium body, and decently drinkable, aside from that off-flavor, which could just be a freshness issue (didn't check for a bottle date).","Rifugium","0"

Upon pouring I immediately smelled some sweet lightly toasted malts. After taking a stronger whiff the piney hops came into play with perhaps some floral/grassy notes. This red ale has a smooth light mouthfeel with a good but not overwhelming malt backbone. What surprised me was the significant hop presence in the finish that hung around for a bit. For me this threw off the overall balance and was a bit disappointing. For the style, I think the hops were too much. This one would be best described as a Red/Amber Ale trying to be an IPA. I'd have it again, but only because we don't get Cigar City in IL. If it was available in IL, I wouldn't hesitate to leave in on the shelf and grab a Bell's Amber Ale.","ZDub","Apr 05, 2013"

Hops are very prevelant in the taste and balance well with the sweet caramel malt. A hoppy, dry, crisp beer in a light-to-medium body that then picks up a little sweetness and finishes with a snappy finish that leaves you wanting for more. A great example of a red ale that is not too sweet or watery and overhopped and quite enjoyable.","clayrock81","Mar 25, 2013"

Finishes pleasantly dry with mild mandarin orange rind bitteress with more caramel accents. Abundant but gentle carbonation. Smooth, silky, fairly large malt bill and on the lighter side of medium bodied. Amber/Red Ales are certainly not one of my favored styles, but this is certainly one of the better ones I've had.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs plenty hoppy and has a good dose of bitterness but it‚Äôs nicely balanced, and doesn‚Äôt harass or assault the palate in quite the way Jai Alai can. Also, it seems that the hop profile used in this beer fits the malt body surprisingly well, and in a way that suits the style: the hop profile of Jai Alai would not be as good of a fit for this beer, nor would Tocobaga‚Äôs hop profile be as good of a fit for Jai Alai. They‚Äôre well-matched. Overall, this is a very solid beer and absolutely worth seeking out if you‚Äôre a fan of this style.","fmccormi","Nov 01, 2012"

I am thinking about heading over this Saturday for the opening of their Hunahpu‚Äôs Imperial Stout. Anyways this Red Ale is fantastic and highly recommended!!","Specialkdb1","Feb 27, 2012"

Pours a nice reddish amber hue with an ample head of about three fingers width tall...although it fades in a hurry. The nose is very muted. This is almost a stone cold neutral smelling beer. The taste is stellar. This is one of the most flavorful, delicious, drinkable beers I've had in recent memory. It has a minor hop profile with some very pronounced malts in the background. There's also a very minor citrus tone to it. The mouthfeel is also stellar. Smooth as hell with only a minor bitter finish. Overall, this is an awesome beer.

It features flavors of slightly sweet malts and really clean, and not overly sticky bitter hops. It's just really approachable and easy to drink. For an amber, it's pretty stellar.

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, caramel hop, bitter hop, and subtle citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite good. Really glad CCB started to bottle this one as I have been wanting to try it for quite awhile. It did not disappoint... The Amber flavor profile on this one was definitely present and quite enjoyable. The malt backbone on this one was pretty solid and enjoyable.

Taste: caramel, mildly toasty, sugared tropical fruit, blam of white grapefruit, earthiness, and a note of alcohol. Medium bodied with exceptionally creamy feel.

Light malt and resin flavors that are very pleasant. There is a nice tartness and a bit of dryness on the finish.","TheTippler","Dec 30, 2010"
4.88,18.7,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Just an outstanding beer, very similar to Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster (which you should try if you like Tocobaga). I can't wait for them to start bottling it, I heard the newest batch was going to be bottled in 750ml sizes...not sure if its been done yet or not.","Ben505","Dec 24, 2010"
4.35,5.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Only problem was the gas from the growler filled me up quick. So I only had 2 glasses. Everyone else finished it off. IF you can get it, Get it!","bernardus1212","Dec 21, 2010"
4.37,6.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Had this one on tap at the brewery. Tocobaga has a nice 1inch head that slowly dissipates down to leave a nice sticky ring atop its orange/amber body. Smells of sweet malt, lemon, and citrusy hops. Taste is just as inviting a smell. Slight sweetness with a wide hop variety. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. My all time favorite red. Appeals more to the hop head!","BigBlacke","Dec 18, 2010"
4.56,10.9,5,4,4.5,5,5,"Drinkability is quite remarkable for a 7% hop-forward beer. Drinks like an English Pale Ale, and that's scary.","BeerImmediately","Dec 09, 2010"
4.28,4.1,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"D - This is really good - it's up there with fresh Nugget Nectar. I had multiple pours at the taproom, and bought a few growlers. It was probably for the best that the keg blew, as it prevented me from buying even more.","MasterSki","Dec 06, 2010"
4.34,5.6,4,5,4,4,4.5,"D - Very nice, the malt and hops are perfectly balanced, especially in the aroma where the fruity notes perfectly compliment the sweetness of the toffee and caramel. The flavor hop characteristics are sharper and push back more against the malt but still leave the beer balanced and drinkable. This is another excellent beer from the boys down in Tampa, and it rivals true west coast red ales such as those from Green Flash and Stone.","nickfl","Nov 24, 2010"
3.81,-7.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Draft. Pours a clear copper red color with a slight tan head. Hoppy citric aroma on the nose along with sweet malt and some woodiness. Nice lace left on the glass as it settles. Medium mouthfeel with good carb. The flavor starts off with some sweetness followed by flavors of citrus hops and the earthy/woody notes in the nose. For a red ale this is nicely balanced without being too maltyl. Very easy drinking as well. Ends with a lingering bitterness from the hops.","kbutler1","Nov 19, 2010"
3.96,-3.6,4,3,4.5,4,4,"Overall, goes down easy for the abv. Wish there was a little more on the nose but definitely an awesome beer for the style.","ChrisPro","Nov 13, 2010"
4.65,13.1,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"This is a great example of a hopped up red ale, well done. This is one of my favorite CCB beers, they need to bottle this one.","FLBeerGuy","Oct 31, 2010"

4.8,16.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"M - Just like a big IPA, this brew is a weighty medium-bodied brew, well-carbonated and smooth yet substantial.","ktrillionaire","Sep 24, 2010"
