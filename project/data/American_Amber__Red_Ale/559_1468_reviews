"Pours a light amber hue with a white head that recedes to a ring.  Aroma of alcohol and stale grains.  The taste has faded caramel, lemon juice, and faint bitterness.  Not the best tasting beer for style fairly abrasive actually.  Has an oxidized note of sherry.  Hop flavor helps somewhat.  Light bodied, cardboard dry and not moreish in the slightest.  Overall, not too good."

"Syrupy body. Flavor all caramel malts and fresh baked bread. Easy to drink, but not much to it flavor-wise"
"O: Very tasty hoppy amber. Right in my wheelhouse; this may become a regular."

""
""
""
""
"This is definitely good for an Amber ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a much better beer than I was expecting.  Like I stated earlier, due to the aroma, I was expecting a much hoppier beer than I got, but this beer is very nicely balanced.  Good malt, good hops, good sweetness.  Good beer."

"I would call it an amber soda. It was a really interesting beer. It wasn't what I expected but I enjoyed it once I got use to it. I will try this again. No doubt in my mind."

"02/06/13  On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Nothing outstanding. OK balance of basic tastes but doesn't impress. I'm not a fan of overt beers, but this makes me wonder 'what's the point'. Mediocre at best."
"Very smooth and flavorful with a significant malt presence, providing a richer and more complex flavor profile than some of the other American ambers I've tried. It does get a wee bit dry and bitter in the finish, but it's subtle enough merely to contribute a little bite to its otherwise soft and well-rounded character."

"Pours a dark red amber with a medium beige head with good lacing. Has an abundance of caramel malt with pine earthy hops,dark fruity notes. A medium body with a bit sweet and sticky mouth feel. Sweet caramel malt and earthy pine hops bitterness on the end that linger awhile. Brew seems a bit heavy for an amber style ale but has lot of flavor and good sweet malt character. A good brew."

"O:  I don't know if traveling in my wife's suitcase from LA to Mississippi messed up the taste.  But I was expecting more.  Once again, the cranberries cut in on the taste."

"Malty but yet smooth, the hop level is under a pale ale and balanced with hints of chocolate.  Nice amber/ red color and foam level in the pour.  Think a better flat tire..."

"12 oz bottle. Pours dark amber with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, ripe fruit and caramel malt. Body is full and crisp. Caramel malt, citrusy hops and red berries nicely balanced on the pallet. Finish is long, dry, and bitter. Very tasty brew."

"This brew is awesome. The bottle Is different, a more thug like art and feel. I've had in bottle and glass, prefer bottle as it given its natural fruit flavor. Smells great and unlike citrus ale's is given a lot more different fruit flavors. Beer is great I've had it on multiple occasions I rather have the ipa version though. Suggest everyone to try"

"A pleasant enough amber ale, the hops certainly doing their thing, and doing it well. Far be it from me, an avowed hop-head, to complain, but, ok, I'm also a fan of balance, and the way the malt showed up here, shook its frilly bits and bobs, and then left with the first goomba with a big, um bankroll, kind of bugs me. Stay and fight the good fight, ya coward! Anyways, a tasty affair, just somewhat underwhelming, right where it shouldn't be, y'know?"

"It's not that it's that bad a beer. It's just not what I'm looking for in an amber/red ale."
"Having this on tap at The Creamery, in San Francisco. Cherry wood color, caramel aroma and mouth feel. Not too much head, probably because of the sugar content. A bit heavy at 7% ABV for a happy hour. I can feel a hangover coming after 3 of these babies!"

"Nice, big fluffy head, over two fingers of deep tan foam, mottled surface, good portion of larger bubbles, the lacking streaks are thick and stick strongly. The liquid is a noticeably dark amber, red base which leans more towards a bright brown than orange, very clear but as “opaque” as this style of beer can get, hardly any bubbles visible at all. Chocolate and caramel get the nose started, like a German chocolate cake, stiffens with grains, quinine and pine sap, with a brush of white grapefruit you’d almost start thinking it is a weird sort of IPA, the golden raisin, peach, yellow apple, fig fruit subdued, ends with a sort of dampened campfire smokiness. Medium-bodied, creamy attack, plush and soft, not much prickle in the carbonation. Lots of coconut oil, cocoa and cola bean through the attack but not that sweet. Something like sweet cigar wrapper next to the metallic earth, fallen wood and hops, the white grapefruit and orange citrus comes and goes but bites when it is there. As in the nose, the peach, apricot, raisin fruit waits until the end to begin to strut. Displays good personality and switches things up frequently enough to keep you interested."
"DATE TASTED: March 3, 2014... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky's Tavern pint.. OCCASION: a Strat and Game of Thrones night... APPEARANCE: intimidating dark amber body; thick, creamy, beige two-finger head that proudly sits a good duration... AROMA: beautiful balance of caramel malts and bright West Coat hops; low citrus, more aromatic and flowery...PALATE: good beer/head mix in the sip, with the creamy viscosity rounding full-bodied impact...TASTE: a BIG pale ale, as old and well-intentioned as the 18th amendment itself; big pine cone bite, warm and malty late... OVERALL: I came back to this beer a decade after I introduced it at a house party (it was wildly successful that afternoon)--and after taking it to a poker night, I found a similarly positive reaction; strong, demanding pale ale that gently shakes the teeth and smooth out the throat; the caramel especially sweetens the end..."
""
"Overall, enjoyed this Amber Ale, loved the caramel, burnt, woodsy feel of this beer. Smooth, and easy to drink Amber Ale. One of the best."
"Poured a reddish-brown body with decent head and lace. A minimal amount of caramel malt sweetness balances with a large dose of citric hops in the aroma and this repeats itself in the beer. Light to medium bodied, smooth, the beer is rather simple and there isn't too much going on but what is happening is good. Well-balanced sweet and bready malts with citric hops give the beer a hoppy and yet also malty taste and it finishes a little dry and bitter from malts and hops."

"Overall: Not good at all. Really disappointed in this one, because I have respect for Speakeasy and generally love their beers. Too bad."

"This arrived with a finger of off-white head with decent retention. Nose was slightly caramel-ish. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a malty, caramel taste on the tongue. Finish was mild, not sweet at all. AmeriCAN Amber/Red Ale?!? This was much more like a classic English Pale Ale, IMHO. Well done and totally unexpected!"
"Overall quality craft brewed Amercan Amber/Red ale. I'm a fan of speak easy and find them to be a little more balanced in their approach to hopping than other west coast breweries. I will get this beer again."

"12oz. bottle courtesy of bstyle. Served in an American Pint. Bottled on 10.31.13. Pours a translucent amber with a foamy, three-finger, light tan head. Nothing overly distinctive about the nose - toasted malt-forward with some piny/citrusy hops. Taste consistent with nose, but there is also a distinct metallic flavor. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with an even carbonation and a trace of acidity. Overall, a pretty lackluster amber. Not sure if it's just an off bottle, past its prime or just subpar. Not something I need to revisit again any time soon."
""
"I'm still a novice ""craft"" beer drinker, but I've noticed the ones that are particularly dark (in this case red) are definitely my preference. It's definitely got the hops (what do you expect from these guys) and I'm definitely looking for this at bevmo. Overall, excellent."

"Pours a ruby red hue with a one finger bubbly head and some nice subtle lacing and definitely a red ale on eye,the smell is a heap of resinous piney hops mixed with strawberries and a slight herbalness it's a hopped red that's for sure,feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and really sets the sessionability on the high end and with that massive hopfest first encountered on smell it's nicely balanced with sweet sticky toffee mid palette and on the finish the hops are still there but it's only a light herbal bitterness and overall it's one of those beers that u have to try but Im not rushing out to grab again as i still prefer Riverside's 44 but also could happily drink if offered cheers."

"D: Totally a must try. Original."

"There’s a thick piney grapefruit hop aroma with a nice rounded hop note. The flavor is hoppy and dank with some chewy pine. It’s a hop bomb for sure. Forgot how good this one is."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear red with a half-finger off-white head that dissipated to a thin ring of white leaving no lacing. A good looking red ale, but nothing amazing. Scents of lemon juice, lemon zest, sweet citrus and orange. A very citrus forward aroma, dominated a bit more by the sweeter aromas than the lemon. Very good though. Flavor is extremely hop forward, though the actual bitterness level of the hops is low. The hop profile is floral, citrus pith, grapefruit pith and pine resin, balanced by faint hints of toasted and grainy malt. The finish is dry and bitter. Very good for a nice, hop forward amber, with hints of malt. I liked it. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, a smooth feel and a drying finish. A good session ale mouthfeel, despite the ABV. Overall this is a good, hop forward amber ale. Its got a nice citrusy aroma and a good hop profile, with just enough malt to keep it from being too bitter. I enjoyed it a lot and would drink it again."

"Poured rather aggressively from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute. It develops 1"" head that settles down to 1/2"" after a minute. The color is a clear deep golden honey. Aroma is wonderful, fruity and hops. Flavor is a bit disappointing--hops, pine, a little caramel, where did the fruit go? The flavor got better and better with each sip. Mouth feel is medium. Overall this is very good, maybe outstanding. I agree with micromaniac129, below."

"nice relatively hoppy amber. the pour is deep brick red, clear though, with an inch of khaki head, foamy and lasting. it smells like dryer, but still semi sweet red malts, ale yeast, and a good dose of American west coast hops. the taste matches, yeasty for a red, and the best of both red worlds here, dry and clean, also sweet and rich, its a contrast but a good one. carbonated well, and very easy drinking, I would have guessed 4.5% abv, this is easy going. medium body and a hint of smoke. I don't know what is prohibition about this, it makes me want another. good not great, but aren't most of them? my first brew from speakeasy is good enough to make me want another, so good on them. on tap at renegade publik house."
""
"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium to dark reddish amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of bready malt and the citrus and floral influence of Centennial and Cascade hops. Flavor of citrus and floral hops, neutral malt and light citrus rind. Finishes with citrus bitterness. Nice medium creamy body. A nicely made red ale that seemed a hair balanced towards the hops than malt, but the creamy body made up for it. Lingering citrus hop bitterness. Enjoyable, but somehow I think prohibition ales weren't quite this tasty."
"As mentioned above, this had the look, aroma, and taste more of a scottish ale than an amber ale. And unfortunately, not that good a one. Wouldn't reccomend this offering, though the label is pretty good looking."
""
""
"Nicely balanced and easy drinking. Tasty stuff!"
""
"Think I might have gotten an off bottle. Poured this a bit cold with a thick, foamy, tan, head that lasts and plenty of lace. Color is a very hazy to cloudy amber. Aroma isn't too strong but is vinous, Flavor is malt, sharp hop, metallic, yeast, biscuit, hint tart. Body is decent but has some high points from the odd flavors; carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor and has those less than pleasing characteristics that last too long."

"12 oz bottle poured into snifter. Upon opening, bottle gushes out as I quickly get it into a glass. The appearance is a deep clear read with tan head that retains nicely and heavy lacing. Nose starts with heavy cereal grain malt, backed up by toast, caramel, and earthy hops. The taste is moderately malty up front with a nice herbal hoppiness that comes through and takes some hop bitterness to the finish. Decent balance of flavors here with an emphasis on the malt profile. Mouthfeel is moderate with decent carbonation. Overall, this brew features a nice balance of flavors, but is overall somewhat forgettable."

"O= this isn't a bad beer at all but the toasty malts threw me for a loop. Not the most hopped up amber but a little more ambery than a hopped up amber. Not bad."
"O: Fairly well balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops so that neither really dominates the palate. Pretty easy to drink and enjoyable."

"It's a decent beer. But nothing special. I couldn't recommend it."
""
""
"The bottle is claimed to be a hoppy ale. It wasn't hoppy at all, and quite watery. Tasted better from the bottle than in a glass, but yet I wasn't impressed. After a short message from Speakeasy on Instagram, I'm considering trying a second bottle when I see it again. Maybe then I can re-do my review and rate it higher."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid brew but needs more body and complexity. Just comes off too light, leaves the palette begging for more."

"Pours reddish amber with scant remaining white foam. Some clings around the ring of the glass. Bready nose, slightly nutty. Some vanilla. Taste opens slightly sweet, with a tangy pine hop. Bittering is aggressive, as advertised. Good underlying flavor, but perhaps too aggressive. Back down!"

"Amber ales are a highly varied style, but Prohibition Ale seems to have nailed the qualities I expect in an amber ale as well or better than most I have sampled. The beer has a good deal of complexity and yet it still manages to maintain a smoothness that goes down easy. A very nice appearance and other factors combine to make this an amber that I highly recommend."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable."

"This was strong enough to be an American Amber/Red Ale even though it looked and felt darker than others that I've had before. Most of those were too hoppy but this had balance like a good ESB. Even though the packaging was a bit over the top like the posters for ""Gangster Squad", the product on the inside matched up with what appeared on the outside. This is a great beer to go to when something full is called for without being weak or generic."
""
""
""
""
"Excellent. They call it an amber ale, but there is a boatload of hops in here. They tossed in enough bready malts to make it perfectly balanced, but I would call it a pale ale. The classification is the only quibble I have, however. This is a darn good beer. Complex, balanced, and delicious."

"Poured aggressively from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice cloudy amber red color with a nice fluffy off white head. Smells of some dark roasted malt but is greatly dominated by piney hops. Tastes of piney hops and a little malt, but not much, a little more hop bite than normally expected in an amber. Beer is carbonated perfectly and goes down smooth with no real aftertastes, very refreshing. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Goes down incredibly smoothly. This is one beer I introduce to people who aren't necessarily ""beer people"" and it's a continual winner."
""
"A really refreshing pale ale. Aggressive and bold, but not balanced enough for me to really give it props. Still, a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I wanted to like it more. Still a red ale. Paired nicely with my fish though."
"Into a pint glass, brew pours a clear body and dull dirty copper color under a dense foam cap. Sweet aroma of lemon citrus comes forward in a friendly hop directed nose. A desirable amount of bitter and lightly sour lemon citrus nicely envelopes a complementary caramel malt body. Toasted biscuit and earthy citrus rind blend into a dry resonating finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite a well-developed and complete beer. I'm very pleased with it."
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a malty finish. There is a medium herbal hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"O-Interesting brew, a little different than many others that i have had in the style. Definitely enjoyed it and will be looking to pick up some others brews from these guys"
""
"Overall - Wow! This is one hell of a red. Nice complexity that intermingles near flawlessly to create a delicious, entirely drinkable brew. My hats off to Speakeasy on this one."
""
""
"Had this one on tap, deep red color with notable clarity and light tan head. Not too impressed with the smell, but it tastes pretty good. Nice fruity flavor along with some hops that give it a pretty pungent punch. However, I found it to feel a little watery compared to how I think it should have felt. Perhaps an issue with the tap? I hope so. Maybe I'll give it a shot next time I see it."

"Overall it's a shame this isn't local but also that I didn't drink this sooner. Been sitting in my fridge for about a month or two. Great overall beer."

"Overall: This in my honest opinion is some pretty damn good beer. It has properties in everything you would ask for and truly met beyond my expectations. For about six bucks and change this beer is a blessing in disguise. Salud!"

"This beer is quite smooth with moderate-low carbonation. The head had me thinking it was highly carbonated. Quite drinkable, almost sessionable.. almost. A nice high-quality beer though, I am happy I bought a 6-pack!"

"I actually enjoyed the draft a lot better (of enjoyed it more this time around). A very good amber ale that's quite easy to drink."

"O - Good and enjoyable beer to drink for a copious amount. But it does not steer away much from the average amber, which can be a minus to some."
""
"Dr: Drinkable but low quality, and expensive at that. I wouldn't try it again if I had to pay for it. A disappointment from Speakeasy. As a side note, beer probably did taste this crappy during prohibition due to limited brewing methods."
"O: Good stuff. Not a standout, amazing beer in any single category, but overall, this one's well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a solid amber, one that I revisit from time to time. I enjoy a good amber ale every now and then, and this one fits the bill just fine."
""
""
"Observed to be a deep, hazy saddle color with noticeable sediment. very minimal head and minimal carbonation as well. Aroma seems akin to a hoppy American Pale Ale.  Upon tasting, I found it to be very malty with additional tart, floral, and bready undertones. A grapefruit variety of hops is also very prominent and bright. The flavor lingers pleasantly in the finish and only has the lightest warmth of detectable alcohol. Highly recommended beer for all and on any occasion."

"Nice ale... just overrated in my very humble opinion."
"The pleasant surprises in this amber makes it a treat. Nice fall brew."
"Had this back in 2007 and haven't tried it since. From the recent reviews I'm seeing I may not try this one again since a lot of people seem displeased with some of the possible recipe changes. I suppose I should be glad I had it a while ago then I guess. The beer poured out as a nice looking amber color with a pretty decent head on top too. The smell of the beer was a little on the light side, there were some hop aromas and sweet malts in the mix also. The taste was pretty nicely balanced between the hops and the malts. The mouthfeel was drinkable and overall I thought it was a pretty good brew."
"I used to get this in bottles as a semi regular ""staple"" when I wanted a break from my normal IPA's but still wanted something hoppy and with a nice malt balance. This always worked for that and then all of a sudden THEY CHANGE IT! The last two times Ive had it recently the hops have all but disappeared from the aroma and taste and now its all some sort of caramel/chocalate/carafe malt. Why Speakeasy? Why!?"
"And if you're thinking maybe I just have a malt bias... there was no complexity to it. Just sugar, burnt sugar, caramel, and water. Mouthfeel was boring, it was low carbonated, the appearance was amber with hardly any head, no lace, no carbonation again... Just overall... ""meh""."
"Think of Prohibition Ale as that perfectly toasted piece of bread or the bed that's covers are tucked in just tightly enough or the soup that's at just the right temperature or the piece of fruit that is almost but not yet overripe... I could go on and on. It is a perfectly balanced recipe that is plenty malty and plenty hoppy and just the right amount of each."
"Overall. Great beer. Maybe my new ""old faithful""?"
"O: had this in a bottle after, and it's nothing compared to on-tap. This is an incredibly complex beer and not at all what I expected."
"Dunno if I got a bad bottle of this or not. Pretty sure I had this on tap in SF - and it was much different (and better!). Perhaps the strangest beer I've ever tasted."
"O – Nice nutty character."
"Overall, a decent, slightly above average amber. Goes down pretty easy. Nothing really stands out, but nothing is offensive. The body could use a little more 'pop' to it."
"Overall a very unoffensive brew, especially if you have a little of a sweet tooth."
"No freshness date."
"Overall: I think that this beer is pretty good despite the weird mouthfeel."
"The beer is nice, but do not feel as if above 6% ABV."
"Pours a nice amber red with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is caramel with some nice malt aromas. A bit of toastiness with some hops and a bit of brown sugar. Taste is pretty well balanced with some nice malt flavors with just the right amount of hops. Some nice caramel and grainy flavors reign through as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied with a nice crisp finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, it's a nice beer for it's style (not my favorite style) with nice drinkability."
"I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised."
"D - As you can tell this is a very drinkable beer for many reasons: smoothness, crispness, and not overwhelming alchohol content. I enjoyed this beer and I do not think it gets enough love."
"D- Carbonation issues aside, this beer is quite drinkable almost any season of the year."
"This is a pretty interesting beer. As I said above, loads of flavour in medium-sized beer."
"D- I dunno how many of these I could handle, thought it was pretty intense. But would be awesome for one or two."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and the taste is particularly well balanced as the malty sweetness helps to keep the hop bitterness in check."
"D - highly drinkable; sessionable"
"M: a bit mellow on the carbonation. but has a nice sharp finish, does not linger around much, but it makes for another sip, these go down quickly. Since I moved to nyc from ohio I miss great lakes conway's and this one is almost as good."
"One of my all time favorite standbys. Great deep raw honey amber color with a fresh hop nose. Crisp hop up front quickly followed by mellow roasted malt which lingers then gives way and leaves a hop legacy on the tounge. Carbonation is right on with an ideal consistency."
"Had this on tap at some bar next to my hotel in San Francisco. I seemed to see this beer many places in the city, so it appears to be popular. Pours a copper-amber colour with a finger of white head. Nice enough head retention, some lacing down the pint glass. Some mild citrus hops with a lot of caramel malt. At least to me, this is on the verge of being an APA instead of an amber. Really nice."
"This beer appears dark brown with tinges of crimson. This ale is quite malt forward, with pleasant fruit notes. The beer tastes like it is bigger than 6.1% abv, but not necessarily in a negative way. The feel is medium-bodied, with healthy level of carbonation. It goes down pretty smoothly. I could see myself having this again."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with a sort of bubbly feel from the carbonation. TBH, they could have said this was an IPA and i would have believed it. Although there is a significant malt backbone, this beer is just too hoppy for a red ale, for me. It reminds me of arrogant bastard with half the complexity and half the body. I say that not to compare but to give some idea of what this beer is bringing to the table."
"D: Hoppy with nice lingering bitterness, yet not abrasive. A real quality IPA all around."
"D - I don't know if I got an old bottle or not but I think the malts where a little too soft for me. The lemon flavors are kinda sorta dominate but makes the beer refreshing on a warmer day. It's very drinkable to me, I know I could toss back a sixer of this no problem. I'd have it again but maybe not buy it again. Worth a try for sure. Cheers!"
"D: Not bad, not great... a little needlessly hoppy for my taste; I wanted it to be more of a relaxing session beer."
"Light and crisp with very light carbonation and a medium body, this beer went down easy (in fact, 3 of them went down easy). Very tasty beer that's light, crisp, refreshing and easy to drink; a definite session beer for me that I will have again and recommend."
"Reddish amber color, clear body. Avg size creamy white head that leaves a soapy residue and finally a creamy surface. Excellent and pleasant sweet (brown sugar, caramel) citrusy and grassy hops. Light yet decent grassy hop flavor with some low-lying sweetness. Has an almost porter-like burnt/lactic acid finish."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable amber."
"mouthfeel is OK: medium-bodied, medium carbonation - a bit watery... nothing to write home about. good drinkability."
"Good thing Prohibition is over!"
"Overall this is a nice flavorful amber ale. It is worth picking up some."
"D: Very easy, somewhat interesting, quite pleasant."
"Poured out a dark amber with a large head. Great lace and carbonation. The smell seems pretty simple, caramel malts and some earthy hops. The taste had an almost rotten fruit flavor. There might be a beer storage factor to the taste but whatever it is, it's gross. I'll retry in a bottle or at a different bar, but my first experience was a bad one."
"Edit: I should add I often buy this beer in the bottle, and it is almost as good as on tap (a little less fragrance). Such a well-done beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability, both follow from everything else about this brew, they're quite good. Very balanced feel, the malt provides a full body that is not at all lacking in quality or thickness. This is a great amber ale, seriously if you haven't had it you will not be dissapointed, it's got great flavors, a look and body as full as a barleywine, and half the alcohol so you can drink 2x as many! so far this is my favorite from speak easy."
"D - Can have a few of these in a sitting. Nice session."
"Pours a deep red, and with an aggressive pour forms a dense off-white head. Sweetish malt and esters in the aroma with subtle, yet very fresh, hops. Slightly toasty caramel malt flavors dominate up front. The malt imparts a pretty substantial body to the mouthfeel, almost chewy in a light and clean sort of way. Hops are citric and fresh, but come just short of overpowering the caramel malt. Finishes with a nice toasty caramel flavor. This is actually a really good beer- a very well done version of an often overlooked style."
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. I was expecting for a very hoppy experience when I bought this beer, and it wasn't that. However, once I got used to the idea of what it was, it was very good."
"Drinkability- Easily sessionable."
"One finger white head, quick dissipation, thin layer of head on top of body, some lacing. Body is clear amber with some visible carbonation rising from bottom of glass. The nose features caramel malts with a bit of floral hops. Taste is malt forward, caramel, bread, a bit of roast, hops well hidden, some citrus notes with a wee nip of butterscotch on backend. Full mouthfeel nice carbonation throughout. Drinkability, quite sessionable, very tasty, a great summer session ale. Tasty, though looking forward to my trip to San Francisco to taste this fresh on tap. Recommended."
"I always forget how good this is. A nice local choice. Pretty tasty with my spag & meatballs, and sausage and garlic pizza."
"Glad to see good US beers making it on tap in Ireland."
"Drinkability good"
"It took me a while to get around to trying this, a few years in fact, but I'm glad I did. This is one of the better West Coast amber ales I can recall having."
"overall this was a great celebration of the prohibition period."
"The fruit must be a blueberry, b/c I'm kind of getting that. Some what vegetable sourness as well. Smooth, yet has a bite."
"The price of 12 bucks a 6 pack is perhaps the only drawback from this phenomenal beer. It has complex flavors, and is well hopped and malted to create a brew that is not too sweet or spiced like a trippel and not overwhelmingly hopped as to take away from the malt. A must try."
"It pours a deep amber colour, with a fast fading foamy off-white head, and very little carbonation. There is a bittersweet hoppiness on the nose with a noticeable hit of yeast, and a sticky toffee aroma. The hop flavours hit you initially in the taste but they are quickly softened by a sweet caramel and rich maltiness, which creates nicely balanced flavours with a a slightly clingy finish. Overall a nice beer, nothing breathtaking but a solid ale."
"Overall a fine, well balanced ale."
"Notes: Maybe not spectacular but a very pleasant draft surprise from Speakeasy. Far more successful than the rest of the brews I´ve tried from them, nicely hopped and very quaffable."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and easy, the modest carbonation gives way to a smooth finish down the throat. The tasting ends with a giant hop sneeze, the sign of a sure win. Delicious and thankfully now available in NY, this is very highly recommended."
"overall a very nice amber ale, well done."
"Drinkability is also good. This is a pretty solid amber ale. Tasty, drinkable, and not heavy at all."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and is definitely worth a try. Speakeasy has yet to disappoint."
"Drinkability is good as well. Recommended"
"T + M + D: Caramel, rather biscuity. Citrus zest and soeme resinous pine hop, like the aroma. The balance of this beer is particularly remarkable... it's not often that a brew has the kind of harmony that this does. Complemented by a rich body - it's a lot fuller than I may have expected it would be - it's a very solid, well brewed beer. This has served as a gateway to the brewery, and leaves me looking forward to try other offerings. Nicely done."
"D: A very good amber with tons of hops aroma and flavor with a raw, unfettered graininess that is truly unique for the style. I can think of a handful of ambers I like better (Lagunitas Lucky 13, Rogue Dry-Hopped Red, Humboldt Red Nectar), but Prohibition Ale is nothing to dismiss -- it's a very good brew. If I could homebrew this well, I would be a very happy man as Speakeasy has done a really nice job with this beer."
"So, I was impressed by the complexity of this beer. But the end of the day, I just didn't enjoy it all that much. And isn't that what drinking beer is all about?"
"A hoppy interpretation of an amber ale. You really don't know what you will get with this style. The west coast style ambers emphasize hops while the midwest (Bell's amber) emphasizes the malt. Both have their merits."
"Not bad, glad I gave it a shot."
"I had this on-tap in an imperial pint glass. Beautiful cloudy, reddish-brown color. Plenty of malt flavor but well balanced by the hops. Reminded me of a ""hopped-up"" version of an english bitter. Went down very smooth and easy. You can certainly feel the 6.1% ABV by the third pint. Excellent stuff."
"Draft. Pours a cloudy brown with a small head. Aroma of sweet, indistinct malt. Aroma of sharp malt initially with some bitter hops. Crisp but very malty. Just ok for me. On an interesting side note, I had a 1 year old bottle of this recently and it tasted very similar to the fresh, draft version despite this being a style that doesn't hold up well over time. Probably because it is so malt forward. Anyway, malty and decent."
"D- Although ambers are really not my thing this has to be the best offering from Speakeasy in my opinion. This is much more enjoyable than a lot of other ambers I have had and if given the chance I would have one again...but only is it was bought for me. And I would drink it a little more fast than I did with this bottle."
"This beer pours with a hazy amber color. The aroma is of lighly roasted malt. The first taste is a combination of sweet honey that gives way to a mild grapefruit taste as it passes over the back of the tongue. There is a moderate bitterness in the finish and aftertaste."
"Overall, this ia good beer with a nice hop/malt balance that makes it quite drinkable but it is definitely hindered by the mouthfeel. Still very good and worth having."
"With some sips I get a slight sour milk thing going on, other sips strike a nice malty brew with a solid hop bite."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and the finish is dry, much like an ipa. The beer is very drinkable, I could have an entire six pack without getting sick of it, but it's not necessarily something I will seek out in the future."
"D) Not very impressed with this brew. The mouth feel throws it off a bit."
"Overall a beer I've been neglecting for awhile and I'm glad to get back to it. Not perfect but very well put together and enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass with a creamy tan head and caramel red body. The head is very creamy on this one. I can see the retention on the glass as I near the bottom and there is still a creamy little layer insulating the beer. Smell is okay, not a lot of hops in the nose, but a biscuity malt presence is evident. Good taste with malt outshining the hops. Nice biscuit malt slightly apple and pear flavor. Pleasant little hop bitterness in the end with a wonderful, creamy mouthfeel to finish things out. Very drinkable and I'd imagine this would appeal to a wide audience. I was expecting more hops with this, but I'm not sure if maybe this bottle wasn't on the shelf and the hops have faded a bit. No freshness date so I don't know when it was actually brewed. I like the beer as is, but is not nearly as hoppy as some of the others in this category."
"Finishes dry with a very pleasing aftertaste of pine. Quite drinkable."
"Overall - A decent enough Amber ale - not something i'd rush back to but certainly worth a try..."
"D- I enjoyed it and would buy this low abv brew again. The smell was great while the taste was not quite was I expected. I look forward to more from this brewery"
"Lots of good stuff going on in this one. Pours a reddiish-brown, with a firm tan head and good lace work on the glass. Light floral aroma. Where this beer shines is the great blend of slightly caramel malt, a little sweetness, with citrus and floral hops. A bit hoppy for the style, but really liked the fresh, rich, and complex flavor they've hear. Slightly creamy mouthfeel, and very smooth, drinkable, and flavorable session beer. I've been a fan of Speakeasy Brews, and so far, this is one of my favorites."
"Great release from Speakeasy, I am really digging their beers lately."
"Cloudy amber beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is pine needles.Taste is bready,pine and a smidge of caramel.Another potentially good beer ruined by those disgusting hops.This is nothing special and something I wouldn't recommend nor purchase in the future."
"The taste won't disappoint. This is a medium bodied, very creamy, very well balanced beer. There is a bold caramel and biscuity malt backbone with some florals present. The malts blend very nicely with the earthy hops. This is a slighly drying beer in the finish with lots of punch up front. There might be a touch of toffee in the beer along with the pale malts, a very creamy, caramelly and well balanced amber ale. Well work seeking out. L'Chaim."
"My first impression was that if an Amber Ale and an American IPA procreated, this is what it would smell and taste like. It's a classic ""tweener."" Not quite like either style, but somehow it just works. Just hoppy enough, yet just malty enough. If I was going for style purity or a hop fix, this is not one I'd buy at the store. However, it's one of the better beers I've seen available at a restaurant recently, and quite a pleasant surprise."
"Far more hoppy than the aroma would indicate. Solid malt base providing a rich body. Neutral carbonation. The hop is bitingly bitter without the typical spicy notes. The aftertaste is long-lasting and lip-smackingly dry."
"Why isn't this beer more popular? A yummy, hoppy treat from Speakeasy."
"D - Very pleased with this...right on par with Big Daddy IPA...solid beer"
"An excellent amber. Pours true and clear amber with a puffy white head. Aroma of roasted caramel malt and some hops. Very smooth taste and perfectly balanced between the sweet malt and hop bite. A rare case of being hoppy, but not falling into the ""weak IPA"" category."
"O: Overall had this awhile ago before sharpening up my palate and beer reviewing skills, this holds up strong and is just as good as i remember. Easty multiples and case worthy."
"D: I didn't like the beer enough to want to try another. It almost tasted like it has some rye beer characteristics, which I'm not a big fan of."
"The taste is pretty richly malty with caramelly toast, with a hint of chocolate as well as grapes, grapefruit, some pine and leaves. It is creamy, yet zesty in feel with good balance, a light bitter finish."
"Purchased a six pack and was glad I did. It poured nicely with a dark copper somewhat reddish hue with a nice decent head which recessed into nice lacing. The aroma was nice but undistinguishable. The taste was great and the mouthfeel was very thick. I now have a three pack remaining which speaks of its drinkability."
"This has to be one of my favorites. Great complexity in the flavor from start to finish. Pours with nice head, has a great smell to it. Nice combination of hops balanced with the caramel flavor. Very smooth on the tongue. Bought bottles at Bevmo in Tempe, brought to Albuquerque since can't find it around here. Amazingly, this beer goes down smooth and flavorful, and is the gift the keeps on giving as you are reminded of the great taste when you burp it back up. No kidding! Can only vouch for this when drank on an empty stomach."
"Recommended..."
"The extreme hops start off as hard to take, but the caramel malts balance it out for great drinking pleasure. The beer has a 6.1% ABV, but remains an awesome session beer. Highly recommended..."
"A big flavorful American Amber. Nicely priced. Go get some."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this a nice beer with some substance that is worth pounding for a while."
"I'm shocked by the enjoyability factor of this beer. I really wasn't expecting a whole lot and this turned out to be very good. This isn't groundbreaking but an all around expertly crafted beer. Thanks again for the treat Brian!"
"I like this beer. A little too carbonated for me, but enjoyable. They really dont do a bad beer."
"Pours a nice copper color with a good size head that disappears relatively quickly. This beer smells and tastes of a nice spicy citrus flavor. This beer gets high marks from me for its rich flavor and high drinkability. I would drink this regularly if it was readily available to me."
"This beer has a great mouth feel, and full taste that leads to a definitive drinkability. I only wish my local liquor store didn't pick a few micro brews here and there that you get teased with, and can't purchase again. This is a keeper!"
"A nice copper color, with a fluffy head. The hoppy flavors were a bit of a surprise to me. They guy at the bottle store said it had a touch of hops and that was no joke. The hop flavor was very much there, but as far as the beer itself went it was a great beer, and matched the west coast style of red ale quite well. This beer was just very well rounded and fun to drink. The name itself is enjoyable."
"D/O: For a beer that was a ""throw in"" with a trade, I certainly wasn't expecting something as rich and complex as this. Had I known, I probably would have waited for a cooler night this fall to enjoy it. I'd be interested in trying it when I knew it to be fresh, as I'd like to see if there's a more pronounced hop presence than I experienced. I think that would really throw this one over the top. That being said, this is an excellently crafted beer that toys with being a Winter Warmer more than an Amber Ale, but the rich sweet malt and heavier mouthfeel would probably prevent me from drinking more than one or two in a sitting."
"Amazingly complex for the seemingy standard amber I was expecting. Really enjoying this one!!"
"This beer being my first introduction to the brewery. It is easy to expect an old-world type beer because of the name, but this proves to be a current-style Amber Ale, with only an old-school name. The beer pours a more-viscous-than-normal pint with tan head formation, laces well and retains well. Dark amber / ruby in color takes on the look of a winter warmer. Aromas of strong hops and malts swirl together, delivering caramel barley notes and citrus / pine character from the hops. Estery and spicy compliment the heavier malts and sharp hop flavor. A touch of toast, roasted grain, and chesnut flavors help to round out the sweetness. The beer feels heavy against the toung with more residual sweetness than needed, but not cloying. Finishes with a heavy malt / hop lingering. Good beer, but better attenuation would really have helped the beer."
"Quite a tasty ale here to say the least. Rich but still mild enough to drink a whole stein full anytime. A new favorite up there with local favorite Firestone Walker Ales."
"Damn Tasty!"
"Poured a nice reddish amber with a big lasting head that leaves great spotty lacing on the glass. Nose is of abundant caramel with a hint of pine, citrus hops. It has some very earthy tones to it. I still sense a nutty flavor to it. The malts really remind me of the Old Godfather. Taste was good but the mouthfeel was rather weak. I am not a fan of Ambers but this is smooth and easy flowing. Drinkability is good! Perhaps one of the best Ambers I ahve ever consumed."
"D-I could deintiely have a few of these."
"Drink: Definately one of the good ones. Speakeasy has established themselves as a force to be reckoned with!"
"(Empty bottle currently having a staring contest on the counter with an unopened bottle of Lucid Absinthe)"
"I'm starting to like these hoppy Amber Ales. Sort of the sister to an AIPA with a little more graininess and caramel. Recommended."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Despite a healthy pour, there's no more than a half finger of tan head atop this hazy rusty umber colored beer. Not much retention or lacing either. Aroma is of grapefruity hops and caramel malt. Taste starts out sweet and malty with an obvious caramel note that is quickly interrupted by sharp grapefruit hops. The finish is both maple syrupy and bitter from hops. Sticky mouthfeel, high carbonation. Easy to drink."
"Final Thought: This is a great red ale with no complexity."
"Rich amber, mostly opaque pour. Good offwhite head. Nice hoppiness, with a touch of sweetness in the nose. Hoppier side for an amber, tastewise, and very pale ale like. Milds short lasting bitter hop aftertaste, but not that well balanced in my opinion. 1 is enough for me."
"I cant really taste the toasted flavor that much. It feels a lil dry in my mouth yet just enough to wet my insides. It goes down smooth and no bad afteraste lingers like i have had in some red ales. A good beer but not too much to review about."
"Mouthfeel was thin and unsatisfying, could have easily had another but wouldn't have wanted one. I want to try some of speakeasy's other beers, but so far they are 0 for 2 for me. I wish they had freshness dates so i could know whether these are old bottles or not. I haven't seen this at Abe's before, so I know they haven't had it long, but who knows how long it was sitting at the brewery or distributor."
"this is one of or not the best ale I have ever had on tap. There is so much you could say about this ale but im going to sum it all up in one word ""AWSOME"". If you never had this ale you dont know what you are missing. Go ahead and step on up to a big boy ale thats going to blow you away."
"twelve ounce glass bottle- color of amber , with a tan head - full nose of fresh hops , light spruce , and slight citrus  taste of hops , citrus , and malt - body is medium , dry , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of resinous , hops , and dry"
"D = I would happily drink this on virtually any occasion. However, it is not really differentiated much from a panoply of American IPAs."
"Drinkability - I'd like to try this one with a meal. Lots of flavor, stopping just short of medicinal on the hops."
"The appearance is golden amber in color with a yellowish head. There is decent head retention. It has a very sweer hoppy aroma. The taste is one of a well balanced malt to hop ratio. Also present is a sweetness with caramel notes. Very good mouth feel. All in all, a very good well balanced beer!"
"D - This is good beer that I could (and will) easily have again. To really appreciate the brew I would suggest letting it warm for a minute before trying it. That seems to be the key to getting the Amber Ale flavor profile."
"Pours a deep amber with a hint of brown. Decent brownish-white head that fades after the first minute. The aromas are of toasted malts and a strong, outstanding hop aroma, I'm picking up chinook, or something with a huge alpha acid score. The taste starts of sweet from the malts, and a lot of pine and flowers from the overbearing hops, overbearing being good in this one. Mouthfeel is a little dry due to the hops, but is balance perfectly with the malt characteristics."
"Nice looking amber coloured ale with a nice sized tan head. WOAH this has some spicy hoppy aroma for an ""amber ale""!!, some caramel malts underneath , but well buried. Very hoppy, citric for an amber, but it does have a rich malty balance in the end, but again near the end the hops roar back into top-gear. Nice on the palate, quite good. Overall i have my doubts about this being an ""Amber ale"" it totally stretches the category to the max. This is more an IPA though on the balanced side."
"Bottle courtesy of Piscator34: Poured a clear deep amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with great retention and perfect lacing. Aroma of bitter hops is dominating with little malt discernable. Taste is also dominated by some deep bitter hops with a dry finish. I could not detect a lot of caramel malt as the label suggested. Body is quite full with some great carbonation."
"Comes in a painted bottle with no freshness date. The aroma of the ale is complex with hops and smell of malts. The malts came strong in the taste with a high hopiness. It left a nice aftertaste on the tongue and I could taste a higher alcohol content that was not overwhelming."
"D: Very drinkable, though high level of sweetness makes this less of a session beer. Likely good paired with a salty food (pretzels, chips) as a counterbalancing effect."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkabitlity: Nice beer, i can have one this again,"
"Pours a nice copper amber with a lasting head that leaves great spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is of abundant caramel with a hint of pine hops. The taste is a dominated by caramel malts with just a hint of chocolate, slight pine hops dwell hidden in the background. The beer is medium to light bodied and the alcohol is well hidden. This is a very enjoyable amber."
"from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass pours a cloudy amber color with a nice tan head. smells of caramel, malt and hops. the first thing i taste is sweet caramel malts with a nice amount of hoppy bitterness, this is a very tasty beer. this beer is medium-bodied and really smooth. this beer is very drinkable."
"Overall, however, it's pretty enjoyable."
"Pours a clear orange/amber, very brilliant, thick off white head forms, leaves lots of lacing, great retention, thick layer. Smell is sweet malts, caramelized sugar, citrus, very nice floral hops, dark fruits as well, nicely done. Taste is sweet and grainy, bready malt, citrus, floral and light fruits, bit peppery in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Very smooth, light and easy to drink, very sessionable! Actually just saw that this is over 6%, wouldn't have thought its more than 5%, nice done. Reminds me of St. Rogue Red quite a bit. Thanks Alexa!"
"Kind of weird find in the Winnipeg liqour store but I love small brewers beer showing up like this. The beer is dark gold with a hoppy nose( more pale ale than amber). The main body is fruity and hoppy with a nice solid finish ( The example I drank could have been fresher). I prefer the amber ales to show more malt but this is a decent hoppy version of the style."
"...cmp"
"D: A fairly average amber ale. Easy to drink, but nothing worth going wild over. Recommended for those who enjoy the style."
"Medium body,tangy and slightly cloying with a juicy feel. Just a bit above average amber,don't think i would want to drink all night,but could drink a few no problem. Good Amber style beer worth a try"
"Drinkability: decent session ale here. Not an overwhelmingly exciting beer, but one of the better ones I have had from this brewery."
"I'll start by admitting I bought this beer for the marketing gimmick... the idea of the prohibition/speakeasy clubs/bootlegging is an appealing subject to build a brewery around. The beer brewed a beautiful amber red color with a nice thick head, and the aroma of the hops was quite intoxicating in and of itself. It had a very strong hoppy smell, like no other amber ale I've had. It reminded me of a pale ale, or even an IPA. This was a pleasant surprise, I guess you could say. The taste was decent, but nothing spectacular. A very crisp, hoppy ale with little body. This was disappointing because the bottle claimed ""A boldly hopped amber ale that strikes a perfect balance between caramel maltiness and its aggressive hopping."" I definitely taste the maltiness, but it is anything but balanced (overpowered?) with the hoppiness. The lacing was nice and the beer finished well. If you are looking for an amber ale that drinks more like a mild IPA, then this is the beer for you. As for me, it will easily fade into obscurity as I continue on my quest to find the perfect beer..."
"Don't drink and review."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, carries a sense of round fullness that isn't heavy or thick. Would be easy to have several, it's a shame I only have one single."
"D - A wonderful beer. Glad I have three left!"
"A very drinkable/sessionable ale. Tasty and somewhat bold with a slight emphasis on the hops, as such may make a good stepping stone for craft beer novices looking for something a little hoppier. I'd drink this one again."
"JH"
"D- good and tasty brew. I'd would enjoy this again, buy to to enjoy it even. Rich on the hop oils for an amber, malt balance fends off making this an IPA. Filling brew"
"I have enjoyed the other offerings I have had from Speakeasy for the most part Iam glad I have the chance to try this.Poured a clear deep bronze with a well formed craterous white head that left patches of lace behind as it settled,grapefruit rind really sticks out at first notice in the nose with some toastiness and caramel.An aggressive hop profile shows itself in this amber and thats nice but it doesnt have the nice complex malt base that the Lagutinas Tocaloma I just drank had the caramel is there but just not alot of character.A solid beer no doubt and I wouldnt turn it down by any means but there are better."
"Clear medium amber colour with a short cap of eggshell foam. Fair retention, some lacing. Malty aroma, mostly caramel and crackery, but there's a light hop and fruit component as well. The flavour was a lot thinner than expected. There's not a lot of malt present, which leaves the bitterness exposed and a little harsh. The hops are a little acrid in the finish, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. The texture starts out alright, but the body falls away mid-sip leaving it watery. Light dryness at the end. I really liked the aroma, but once I took a sip things went downhill. The balance is way off and there's not enough malt to support the body and hops. Too bad."
"Overall, an amber that flows nicely from rich caramel maltiness to bold citrusy hopiness. Finish is way too balanced towards hops though."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a slightly hazy, amber color with a medium light tan head. Smell was pine, with a touch of honey underneath. This is one of my favorite starts to an IPA, so I was expecting great things. Expectations....disappointed. The flavor was all hops at the start, I thought I had pine tree juice. The malt was present as a sweetness in the middle, but it was accompanied by a mild flavor of sulfur and maybe some burnt toast. Finish was fairly bitter, and not particularly pleasant. Body was light, carbonation was medium. I did not like the burnt notes in the flavor, and felt they were very much out of place for this style. The finish was overly bitter (this from someone who likes Ruination). Perhaps more fair to say that they flavor of the bitterness was unpleasant. I would try this again, given how different my perception is from other reviews, but only if it was given to me."
"Mouthfeel: Medium-body brew with a very smooth bitterness. I like the balance in the brew, not overly bitter as some american ambers can be."
"An innteresting beer that we got for its visual appeal. The taste is nice and bitter and it stays pleasant long after the beer is gone. The smell is particularly appealing. Overall a quality beer. Worth it for the look of the case alone if you are a collector of case art."
"Definitely drinkable and one I will enjoy again soon."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into pint glass. Poured a nice amber with a decent head, some lacing. Aroma was a nice citrusy hop with some malty sweetness in the background. Taste was mostly of hops finishing with a nice sweet finish. Lightly effervescent, went down very easily. A nice beer that is very quaffable."
"Nice coppery color with a decent sized head. Floral and hoppy aroma. Nice hoppy flavor with a very nice lingering bitterness. Slight sweetness as well. Good mouthfeel. Quite the enjoyable amber ale. A step above a lot of the others out there-many can be rather ho hum. This is worth a try."
"Pours a nice clear amber/copper body with a solid, orangey/white head that leaves a slight lace on its way down the glass. The aroma is an overwhelming citrus hoppiness, with just a slight sweet breadiness behind it that keeps it from being acrid. The taste is a hoppy attack with a slightly roasty undercurrent with a rather sweet. The cohumulone grind leaves a slight aftertaste, but that's nothing that can't be dispatched by another sip. I could definitely drink a few cold bottles of this on a warm night, but some slightly cleaner hopping could improve the drinkability."
"Nice rich amber color that pours with a good head that settles down quickly. Has slight lacing, with a light body and adequate carbonation. Nice amber maltyness to start, moving to a bitter hops taste. Good balance of hops and malt. Malt taste sticks around for a mild but enjoyable aftertaste. Not my favorite amber ale, but the light body makes this beer very drinkable and would be good on a hot day."
"Poured a slightly hazy reddish-chestnut color with modest slightly off-white chunky head. Smell is strong on grassy hops with a minimum of malt noted. Taste initially presents a formidable hop character with little if any malt balance. That being said, I really like the taste of this beer. Finishes with more hoppiness and still the malt seems to be absent. Nice drinkability, nice taste, excellent beer."
"Normally, American Reds leave me a little unsatisifed. Not so here. This is a grand example of the style that I would place with the big boys like Santa's Private Reserve and Retro Red!"
"D - No problem. I'm glad I have a six pack."
"Final Verdict: Speakeasy REALLY nailed this one, their Untouchable Pale Ale though missed being at this high level."
"Overall: I was impressed with this brew. It exhibited a great flavor profile and balanced the flavors nicely-none of the flavors were fighting for attention. A really well done brew that is sure to please. One that has earned a place in my fridge."
"Drinkability - drank this on the croquet court in the sun. loved it."
"This was a straight up malty ale. No overpoweringly hoppy, but they existed in there. Decent mouthfeel, malt persists with a slight hoppiness in the back that definitely takes over as the beer warms up. Not a lot of aftertaste, kind of makes you long for more. I think I would classify this as more of an amber ale than a pale ale. Good overall and crisp, you could drink a few of these at a barbeque while grilling some burgers."
"Mouth: This beer is excellent! A strong bitter flavor from front to back with herbal highlights and incredible balance with a small amount of sweetness and even some salty qualities to add depth to this very drinkable and enjoyable beer. Incredibly well carbonated - or nitro-nated - that stays strong from start to finish."
"Over all a nice beer with a fairly good hoppy flavor, would have liked for it to be a little more balanced, but over all worth a try."
"Quenching, quaffable, perfect for summer sessions."
"Sunset orange. Again I am getting a touch of honey in the aroma, just like I did with their India Pale Ale, along with a touch of caramel covered red apples, toffee and a huge resinous hop scent. Watery texture and very thin in body. Notes of caramel, toffee, bright fruits and west coast hops. Overall, just very bland."
"Mouth feel is a bit watered down and actively carbonated."
"There's an initial burst of hoppy bitterness. A little bit of grapefruit citric flavor turns into chewy caramel malt sweetness pretty abruptly. Finishes thin and watery. Not too bad, just not my favorite beer from this brewery."
"My overall review ... loved it and will definitely be purchasing some for the homestead. A great beer year round. I paired mine with a nice wasabi encrusted meatloaf sandwich. I could see this beer going really well with grilled food too. Give it try ... you won't be disappointed!"
"I've had some success with these guys and will continue to seek their brews. This is a fine APA and one of my favorites to date. On the smoother end of the style, well put together."
"Nice light amber with a thin haze from a small amount of sediment. Slightly dimpled off-white head settles slowly and smoothly. Biscuity, caramelly, cereal and sweet german-like notes evident in the nose, with a hint of citrus and resinous hops. Malt flavors are real light cereal and biscuit. Hops are slightly more potent than malt with a hint of resinous and citrus that melts into grassiness. Light, almost watery body, but with a slick feel. Good ale, light, but more complex than some APAs, but not outstandimg."
"($1.89 / 12 oz.)"
"Drinkability- A touch too bitter for me, not really anything to carry the flavor. Kinda thin."
"Smells great, pungent hop aroma, some creamy caramel malts. Nice grapefruit bitterness on the initial tongue bite, very hoppy, bitter, but not as bitter as I thought. Smooths out the longer it's held on the tongue, the bite stays, but there's a bit of easy-going roasted maltiness to keep a bit of balance. Never feels too soft or weak in the mouth, dry and warm on the way down. A pretty decent APA, the MLCC should really bring in more west coast brews.... Now if there was only a place to find stuff like this on Tap in Winnipeg...."
"Pours out to a really nice dark amber. Head is extremely thick and doesn't subside. The smell is average because though it smells pleasant, it doens't hint that this is a beer at all. The taste is pretty sweet, but not too malty. Hops kind of has that sharp, spicy kick to it. Not bad at all! The beer does feel just a tad bit too thin, though the flavor does a good job of covering that. On the whole, a fairly drinkable beer, if you don't let the hops get to you."
"D: Due to the terrible taste, I didn't even finish this. As stated above, one of the worst beers I've ever tried, so I hardly consider it drinkable."
"In some ways this was an inimpressive brew but in reality it's quite drinkable. It's not a 'big' brew that'll grab your attention but it's a very competent APA with some malt characteristics that'll keep your interest throughout."
"Pours a nice amber color with some carbonation. Not much of a head, but leaves some nice lacing. Scents of hops aplenty, sweet caramel malts. I like the taste, very hoppy, but not much of a body, pretty light, not a bad aftertaste, but could be a bit more bitey. Very drinkable, would make an nice session brew."
"Dark amber in colour with somewhat low carbonation. Some nice hoppy aromas going on there, perhaps a mix of citrusy and woody (but not pine like) varieties. The flavor was far less malty than I had expected, with more leafy hop character coming through. The malt note that I detected was more of a slight roasted note. The body was a little thinner than expected too. Perhaps this bottle had a bit of a rough ride north? Anyway, Im glad that the MLCC finally brought in something with some hop character for a change."
"The nice art deco bottle art packages a decent pale ale. It pours hazy-orange with a flat white head that rapidly reduces in size but does not disappear. Bouquet is slightly piney but not particularly strong. Soft, slightly oily mouthfeel that coats the pallet well. Because the hop flavors are strong but not complex, making for a slightly dry finish that could handle a very small amount of addition malt balance. Overall, quite pleasent."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness indication given. Pours orangy medium amber, moderate light tan head and leaves respectable and stringy lacing. Nose is honey maple malty. This is a fairly dry APA, nice mouthfeel, coating, medium bodied and smooth over the tongue. Balance is in evidence here, as this is an easy drinking ale. No complaints.Nothing special, just a better then average, pleasant to quaff, BA worthy brew"
"An above average and delicious amber red ale (not a pale ale) that pours with smallish white head that drops to a thin collar of foam. As the head falls, lacework is left behind enhancing the appearance of this brew. The aroma is full of spicy and resiny hops, that also seem to add flavor to this beer. This is a very drinkable, hoppy ale (or maybe I'm just thirsty) that has a pleasant combination of spicy hops and caramel malt flavors. The finish is just bitter enough; leaving a lasting bitterness on the tongue."
"This is a pretty good American Pale/Amber ale. Poured out to a golden amber color with a nice fluffy head. Some traces of lace were noted. Aromas of hops and sweet veggies were noted. Taste was smooth and direct, with overtones of hops, dry fruit and a medium bitterness. Also had a wine like quality on the mouthfeel. Slightly dry aftertaste. Worth a try."
"Pours a dark amber color with little to no head. The smell is of hops but is pretty powerful and not that friendly. The first taste is not terrific... the hops takes the most prominent taste but its overbearing: there doesnt seem to be any body to the beer only that of hops. As you continue to sip you become more accustomed to the taste and it evens out, but there is still a little too much water for me. This is a good beer if you plan to have a couple because even though its a microbrew there is still a lot of water to it, but also much taste."
"12oz. bottle: This is a little interesting. The beer pours a somewhat hazy amber color. Mine didnt have too much head to it. The aroma is quite nice. It is a bit spicy, malty and citrusy, nicely balanced between the three. The taste is quite good also. There is a decent caramel maltiness to it, with a but of a hop bite also. Somewhat spicy taste also. This is well done and easy to drink. Thanks, Jay!"
"Id return to Prohibition, but only in to the form of Speakeasy. Prohibition Ale makes pretty good contact. Id say its a Texas Leaguer that gets barely thrown out at second on my baseball scale."
"A really refreshing pale ale. Aggressive and bold, but not balanced enough for me to really give it props. Still, a solid beer."
"Pours coppery golden with a pretty good head that dissipates into a thin collar. Pretty hoppy nose, but other presences (roasted, caramel and crystal malts, a touch of iron/brewing salt, fruit blossoms) take notice as well. Bitter, hoppy front with residual toffee-ish maltiness mid-palate, with a hop oil slickness in the finish. Tea-like tannins with a lot of bittering hops and the definitive Cascade hop aroma make for a pretty good ale. It's thin, but righteously so. It reminds me a bit of a few targeted homebrews I've done in my earlier days, hoppy English-style ales, of course using U.S. ingredients. It might let down to both the Maltheads and the Hopheads, but Prohibition a good medium between the two rival gangs. Can't we all just get along?!..."
"Note: I have had this beer in the bottle and it seemed even more hoppy and over-carbonated, definitely more balance on draught."
"There's a big, huge, yellow, fluffy, sticky head on this beer. Color is orange-amber, and a touch hazy. There's residue on the last pour. Sticky swoops o'lumps on the glass. Smell is lightly hoppy, soapy, a little fishy. Not great. Faint hoppiness in front, some fruit. Dusty in the middle with a little milky malt. Dry in the finish. Quite bitter, but not much taste. It's not bad. There's nothing really wrong with it, just not much to taste. A little bitter chocolate shows up with temperature. And in general, the faint malt doesn't quite support the hops."
"This brew isn't really getting it done for me. One was interesting; a six-pack is overkill."
"I wouldnt say that this was gushing, but it was certainly over-carbonated. It reminded me of some of my first attempts at homebrewing. Still, it poured an attractive earthy-orange color, with moderate haze and an enormous, solid head. Extraordinary retention. The aroma has an intense floral hoppiness, with citrus and pine-like characteristics. Its very fresh smelling. Slight ethanol in the smell too. The first sip brings forth a fruity, slightly yeasty ale trait. A little berry and apple, all underneath a heap of citrusy hops. Finish is hoppy, but not extremely bitter. On the downside, thought the flavors are nice, but they dont seem to come together very well. Its a jagged, rough beer. Drinkable enough though, Id have another."
"The pine carries though in the flavor in a big way. Massive hop resins characterize this beer. It is dripping with hoppiness. Thick, syrupy, sappy, coating pine flavors permeate this beer. But is it unbalanced? Not at all... There is a substantial and unyeilding malt backbone to this beer. Wonderfully caramelized malt flavors move about and meld with the pine resins. They do not war, they make love. It should be noted that this beer is not characterized by extreme hop bitterness. The bitterness is moderate, but the hop flavor is Brobdingnagian. Pure hop syrup. Pour this stuff on pancakes."
"Medium bodied, a session beer with great drinkability."
" Nothing jumps out but this is a darn solid good session beer....6% is a session beer to me... NIce hop taste that over powers the maltiness but i LIKE that.... I would say bring this one to a party because the bottles have cool little eyes on the neck that will probably be a conversation starter....two tumbs up"
"I have to admit that I wasn't expecting anything good from this one. I thought the bottle label and name of the beer was completely cheesey. It reminded me of Steel City cans or Three Stooges beer. Anyway, WOWEE! What a great surprise. This beer poured a nice copper color with very sticky, sturdy head that hung around and laced down the glass until the last sip. The taste was very complex with huge hops and fruity notes throughout that remained consistant until the last swallow. I also picked up on a little cinammon. The mouthfeel was thick but not too sweet or sticky. I will definitely have this one again."
"This ale poured a hazy amber color with white foam that settled slowly but coated the glass. The smell was dominated by floral hops with some bitter hops behind. The taste was nicely hoppy: floral hops and mild bitter hops. There was some malt to balance, and perhaps a trace of smokiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and very dry with medium body and moderate carbonation. The finish was dry and hoppy. This was a very nice and pleasantly floral pale ale."
"Overall: My least favorite of their regular 3."
"Reflection: I'm glad I picked this one up, I spent the first five minutes just smelling this beer! The aroma was excellent and its a good beer to boot!"
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with a floral hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a light pale malt flavor with some crystal malts. The hops are quite bitter and floral on the finish. It goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adeqaute carbonation. This is a good American IPA. It has the color, the aroma, and the fine malt hop balance; a good drinker."
"Overall, I'd like this brew a bit more if the hops and malt character were better blended. Prohibition Ale has potential but there's still some work to be done to smooth out the roughness."
"I am drinking a chilled sample of this brew in a pint glass. The beer pours a bright clear orange color with off-white marshmallowy, fluffy head developing easily. Great retention as well. Aroma is all hops with pine scents mixing with some grapefruit as well. These scents mix very evenly and create an appealing yet one-dimensional scent. First sip reveals average body and fine gentle rolling carbonatio. Flavor again is dominated by hops. Citrus hits of grapefruit and orange come out, possibly some lemon too. The beer ends very crisp and clean. Very refreshing ale, that while a little bitey is very drinkable. I just wish there was a bit of malt profile in the bottle too."
"Drinkability  They have some great flavors in this ale if they can just get them to work a little more together."
"pours a nice deep amber colur with a moderate to large sized creamy off-white head that's nice and sticky. the smell is a plethora of sweet/juicy hop, caramel, earth, pine, bread and malt. good stuff. the flavour is very hoppy up front but slowly gives way to(though is still intermingled with) earth and malt flavouring. the sweetness holds throughout from its characteristics in the hops to the caramel flavour mixed in with the malt, and it helps to produce some pine flavoured hop burps as well. a touch of alcohol is noticeable here and there as well. this is a brew that is complex but remains fairly basic and straightforward at the same time. it's big and bold but not over the top in any way. i enjoyed this much more than anticipated. easily recommended."
"Nicely balanced, very drinkable,decent strength - all around a solid beer."
"Medium body very drinkable. This reminds me a bit of Red Seal (that is good!)"
"Had this on tap at Redbones. Pleasantly surprised, it was a nice change for me. Light-medium amber in color, it came with a low head. Aroma was of grassy hops. Malt came across as smooth and a bit syrupy, with the hops changing course at the end, and becoming more woody and drying. Would get again."
"Tap@Edinborough Castle, San Fransisco. Considering i felt like crap after a mamoth day drinking with the San Fran Krew (from the other site), this wasnt too bad. pretty relaxed and soft. Nice hop aromatics, pine, lychee, not intense at all, well balanced."
"Pours with a two-finger bubbly white head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Medium carbonation. The brewer says: ""perfect balance between caramel maltiness and its aggressive hopping"" well, the aggressive hopping dominates any caramel maltiness, there is a little sweetness in the background but not much. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Vintage Cellar, Blacksburg, VA."
"The taste is very good, with a citrusy, pine taste. The aftertaste provides an ample hop flavor that is not too strong, but just right. This is a good IPA in my opinion."
"The carbonation never really gets going for this ""Amber"" Ale."
"Notes: An elaborate multi-leveled complexity that jumps from hops to malt several times and touches upon the fruity esters as well, beefy in the hops and a perfectly level malt that leaves everything in balance to a point. A must try, this is what beer is about."
"An indelibly hoppy amber ale, a bit of a juxtaposition of styles. The beer pours a clear, deep copper, with a feathery, airy head rising up, then sinking to a sheer film of foam and good, intricate lacing. The aroma is entirely honest and well-hopped. The flavor duplicates the aroma with a yeasty characteristic, and tasty bready malts. Citric hops are lightly sweet and tart, and very enjoyable. Despite the high hoppiness for the style, the malts are up to the challenge and the beer remains well balanced. The flavor is perhaps similar to some Rogue ales, yet the mouthfeel is much thinner and the beer is actually more drinkable. The beer tastes very fresh, almost unfinished, but thoroughly delightful. A slight staleness in the aftertaste is perhaps the only shortcoming; drinkability good. I'm not wholly on board with Speakeasy's gangster 'n' moll motif; it seems to me the '20s era of American Prohibition doesn't fully jibe with modern craft ale, particularly the well-hopped west coast variety; bootleg gin would be a closer match. Nor am I a fan of the interchangeable, unmemorable names for their beers. However, I absolutely love the furtive eyes on the neck of each bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light beige head over the slightly cloudy copper brew. Laces well. Aroma is mostly piney hops, with an undercurrent of pale malts. Taste is dominated by the hops, but the malts provide enough body to make it relatively well-balanced for an APA. Mouthfeel and drinkability both very good."
"That being said, for the timid, for those fixated on American craft Pale Ale, for those who insist on bone-dry attenuation, this is your beer."
"I was scared at first, due to the hoppiness, but once it warmed up a little, it got a lot smoother. Anyone who reads my reviews can see that I am not a big fan of hoppy beers, but this one was a bit different than the others. It started out malty, then to hops, then faded slowly into the two balanced out well. This was awesome! Most beers like this might start off a little malty, but then rage into this uncontrolable mosnter of hops. Which some people might like. Along with the malt and hops, there was the presence of citrus fruits and a hint of caramel. Oh, and I thought that the bottle's logo was pretty cool. With the gangsta people lookin' all shifty and such, and then the ""spooky"" eyes on the top. Kudoos to Speakeasy on this one. You've won a malt lovers heart over."
"Pours a deep copper color that is topped by an off white head. It has a pungent citrusy aroma that is backed by toasted malt notes. Slightly sweet up front with a dry finish that leads to a sense of toasted biscuit lingering on my tongue. These Speakeasy beers are a lot more malty than I remember them being. There is a nice hoppiness here, it is just not as dominant as I would like it to be, or as I remember it being. I get notes of orange, flowery herbal nectar, a sharp tongue tingling bitterness, and a certain sweetness towards the end that tends to tie the maltiness and the hops together. Just a wee bit disappointing in the end, ah such is my memory of this beer."
"Note: BA lists this as a pale ale. The bottle calls it an amber. To me, the maltiness and body speak of a pale ale moreso than amber."
"Prohibition Ale is a solid version and is my slight preference over this brewery's Untouchable Pale Ale. A calmer mouthfeel would be welcome, but it's good beer all the same. I always like to see silk-screened bottles and Speakeasy's are usually well done."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"It pours a clear amber with a nice off white head. The aroma has juicy hops and some sweet malts. The body is thin and the hops run the show. There is some citrus and pine with a touch of caramel. It finishes dry and the bitterness lingers. Not much depth or complexity IMO."
"This is a good Pale that actually pours kind of orange. Even the head is slightly orange...somewhat off-putting. The aroma is a well balanced menagerie of caramel malts and PNW hoppiness with some unique flowery notes. The taste is a winner, as the hops dominate, yet the finish is sweet and hearty. Mouthfeel is a little chewy and slightly oily on the palate. Perfect (low) carbonation for the style. Drinkability is good. A strong, strong session Pale."
"This beer pours a flourescent orange color with a weak beige colored head. Carbonation seems to be minimal. Smell is extremely citrus with oranges being dominant. Taste however is more complex and less citrus intense. The citric flavors are still there and mostly in hop form but there's a breadiness to the base of this beer as well as caramel malts that mix well with the hops which are quite bitter. Very crisp, very refreshing. The taste lingers in my mouth until the next sip. Quite an intense pale ale. Well done."
"Burnt orange colour. A thin white head sits atop this pretty brew. It doesn't last very long. A few strands of lace adorn the sides of my class. Potent nose, filled with spice with a touch of sweetness. The smell left me anticipating a strong hop laden brew. But thats not exactly what I got. The smell certainly transfers over to the taste. Just on a small scale. Starts spicy then ends suddenly with an all too quick hop bite. I'm left wanting more."
"This a quality IPA, despite what others think it is. I think this is better than SpeakEasy's pungent IPA, and easier to drink. Not quite up there with Stone, but this makes a decent West-Coast hop-heads dream."
"12 ounce bottle. Bottle says the beer is an amber ale."
"Mouthfeel is good as well, some body, and the carbonation go together nicely. Drinkability on this is great, lots of character, yet a smooth finish."
"hazy rust that leans more towards the brown than the orange. fluffy cream soda colored head the retreats to a mimimal collar. substantial lacing. carmel malt aroma, with notes of earthy hops. i keep thinking tobacco. light to medium bodied, carbonation seems to be at the right level. semi-sweet crystal malt flavor intertwined exquisitely with that earthy, leafy hop flavor. subtle citrus undertones mingle with a bready malt aftertaste. quite complex flavors going on here, and mingling very well! an enjoyable multi-dimensional ale that is quite quaffable. my favorite of the speakeasy line. recommended."
"Pours a light chestnut color with a delicate head. Very floral hop aroma, but initially a very citrusy hop flavor profile. Hints of dark malt, roasted and toffee flow across the palate. The hops are the star of this Northwest style amber ale. The malt, while distinctive, are mellow enough to let the hops take the line. Moderate bitterness through the finish with a sharper mouthfeel."
"Hazy and beclouded deep amber color on the pour, the head portly in size, spumescent in texture, winsome light tan in color with a velum like curtain of lace to seal off the glass from view. The aroma of hops, followed by sweet malt with a lemon like crispness, fresh and appealing with the start heavenly sweet with a nice malt profile and the top moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops dynamic in their spiciness, hop bitter and dry aftertaste, a wonderful beer, that I must say WOWs me still."
"Richly hopped amber ale. Nice roasted malts, slightly sweet. Nice balance to hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Etched beer bottle."
"F"
"This is considered by Speak Easy to be an amber Ale. For sure it has a nice amber color and great fragrant hops to be noted. I was fortunate enough to get this beer in a mixed case of Speak Easy's beers, because I had had Big Daddy IPA, and enjoyed it and wanted to see what else they created. Well, this one won me over, and I think it is even more full bodied and full flavored than Big Daddy. I got the case about two months ago, and still have one left in the fridge. I do not know what I am saving it for, but I do know it is not easy to find where I live. Any one who loves a nice hoppy beer should give this amber a try!"
"It has a slight oily feel to it but this does not hamper its mouthfeel or drinkability. It is a very complex ale. I am sure when I have another one I will notice something that I missed from this one. I really enjoyed this ale."
"Overall, a bold red ale....Not for the weak hearted...Throw this at a killian's fan and watch him squirm."
"This beer exhitibits a glowing scarlet red color that is very inviting. A small and creamy light brown head coats the glass nicely as I drink. There is a nice blend of agressive citric and piney hops and caramel malts on the nose. It's pretty cool. Upon tasting, I discover that this is one of the most hopped up amber ales I've tried. I'd almost say it's like an IPA, but I don't think the bitterness is high enough, and moreso, the underlying caramel malt backbone makes its presence known. The hops seem west coast all the way. Piney. Rind-like. And citric. A bit of a twist for an amber, but pretty tasty. This is a hophead's wetdream for an amber ale."
"Pours a gorgeous deep reddish amber with a long-lasting light tan head. Mouthfeel is medium-to-thin in body with a pleasant creaminess to it. Aroma consists of piney citrus and malt. Prohibition ale starts off with that piney citrus punch which leads to the creamy caramel malt middle. Biscuity finish that has a mouth-puckering finale. The underlying caramel malt background plays second fiddle to the predominant hop bitterness experienced and enjoyed throughout. This beer really seems more like an IPA than a traditional amber. Regardless, it's superbly crafted."
"Courtesy of Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. This beer was certainly a pleasant surprise. Usually these gimmicky-type bottles house awful beers. Pours a thorough amber color with a medium thin and quickly dissipating light beige head. Very thin lacing. Assertive floral hops aroma. Excellent balance of hops and malt in the flavor. Nice, clean finish is bitter and a little spicy. Very good."
"The hoppiest Amber Ale I have ever sampled. Sappy green hops engulf the almost imperceptable biscuit malts. While a fabulous brew, this beer has taken a single step too far, leaving behind the essense of its style. A more pronounced maltiness should be expected in an Amber Ale."
"Pours a nice deep clear orange/copper reddish color. The head was a light tan color. Carbonation is a bit high. On the nose the aroma was hoppy, caramel malts, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and fruity esters. On the palate the flavor were hoppy, nice bitterness, slight biscuit hints, caramel malts, citrus, pine, grapefruit, and fruity esters, herbs, slight spicy. Good balance in this brew...."
"Clear, amber, reticent white head. Exceptionally floral hoppy aroma - some citrus notes. Body is all floral hops, which is something that seems to be a Speakeasy trait. Fairly one-dimensional, but better than the Untouchable, I think. There are always better things out there, though."
"Hoppy grapefruit aroma, beautiful glowing clear copper-red color, citrusy hoppy flavor, nice thick creamy mouthfeel reminds me alot of Three Floyds Pale Ale, very tasty and easy drinking. I can't get enough, I wish I could get Speakeasy in St. Louis."
"It poured a hazy reddish copper with little to no foam. The smell was of citrus and a strong aroma of hop's. The taste was of citrus and hop's with a big bite of bitterness for me. This beer had to much bitterness on the palate. The bitterness lingers for quit a while after drinking the brew. It was just OK, I won't buy it again."
"A much better beer than the Untouchable Pale Ale, and as I purchased both for the same price, it would be my first choice if I was deciding between the two!"
"A bright red/red orange body is topped by a mountain top like just-off-white head. Aroma is mainly hops, both floral and citric. A bit atypical of a red ale. Taste has a good strong malt base, but a nice leavening and lingering hop signature is also there, but not overpowering. Red/amber ales are often fairly basic, but this one has some character to it."
"A nice amber color with a thick tan head.  Lace was thick and copious.  A strong hop aroma wafted out of the glass, the finish though was more malt prevalent (caramel) I found this very interesting that the hops were not as stong on the finish as the aroma suggested they might.  I'm not complaining cause this was and is a very smooth drinkable quality ale. One I will try to keep around from now on."
"Crystal clear with a  very nice color - truly reddish with copper highlights; like a rich oiled mahogany. The beautiful body is topped by a foamy light-tan colored head that holds very well and leaves some really good lace. The aroma is bold: full of bright, citrusy, Pacific Northwest hops and some fruitiness; well-backed by a dark caramel maltiness. The body is medium light and the carbonation level is moderate. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy. The flavors starts with a bold hoppiness, then wrestles across the tongue with some gentle caramel malt, and eventually fades smoothly into a gently lingering malty & hoppy finish. At first I felt the mouthfeel could have been fuller, but with further thought I feel that the limited body helps to keep the flavors from becoming too full, and allows for a smooth finish without the hops getting hung-up in the throat. A very well done beer that probably deserves more recognition than it gets."
