"On tap at rock 'n brews El Segundo poured into nonic pint glass. Red amber in color with off-white head that clings. Smells of passion fruit and booze. Tastes about the same with good crisp pine and carbonation."

"o: A very enjoyable and satisfying ESB-style ale, highly sippable and savory in texture and overall taste. I'd buy this again anytime of year. However I'll need to try a much fresher bottle to confirm this."

"I've had this sitting around for a while and finally decided to crack it open. This red ale pours a true red copper color with a thick and lasting off white head that leaves beautiful silky lacing. The nose is a delicious blend of sweet malts, west coast hops, and spice. The body is rather full with a pleasant carbonation and just the right amount of sticky sweetness. It finishes rather dry for such a malty ale. The flavor is a little different from the nose with a more pronounced spicy, peppery bite and an increased sweetness. This is a very good red. Knowing lagunitas and their love of hops, I want to try this fresh to see if there is a more pronounced hop character. This is very good none the less, just a tad sweet for what I expect from the brewer."

"O: tasty. Big beer that is well balanced. Big hop flavor up front. Slightly bitter. Easy drinking for how big it is."
""
""
""
"Get a hold of any of their beers, except for the PILS, which I think is a wasted effort. Also, try not to drink too much, as in the brewery in general. It will wash your palate away, and you'll be hunting for a great stout or porter to revive your palate. You will know. Thanks Lagunitas, you guys make great brews!"

"O: Not a wow beer for me but very yummy. This would be good in the fall and spring (might be a spring seasonal not sure though) Seen that this was a Lagunitas beer so I hadto try . . . Lagunitas has become a brewery that I have to try everything I see."

"Edit- with no apparent date on the bottle and after reading other reviews, I think this must be a older beer. A complete break down on the hop flavor I experienced leads me to feel this way. I think I need to give this one another go to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"P.S. - They've changed the malt bill to lighten things up from earlier iterations. See Lagunitas website."

"I only wish it wasnt a seasonal."

""

"Overall: this was a very satisfying experiance, its tasty and filling. It isn't too drinkable however, and I would buy it again but only when I'm looking for that style specifically and not as a "" go to"" still, definitely worth trying."

"O: This is a fantastic beer. One of the best I have had. I love the in your nose hop profile that reminds me of a DIPA. Just when you taste it you are dealing with a different animal that is more complex in character. I have another one and am tempted to drink it right now but won't do that until I get another one for my stash. If you like strong IPAs that can cross over into the complexity of a Stout, this is a beer you want. I am going to grab a few more while I can."

"A very nice interplay of malt sweetness with hop spiciness and bitterness. Almost seems like there is some rye in this one. Subtle yet deep complexity. Nice balance throughout. Excellent work in letting the grains and hops shine while not letting the high ABV over-dominate things. A damn good beer..."

""

"The mouth feel was smooth, almost silky, and had a good red ale flavor."

"Lagunitas always does it right. I need more of this beer. One bottle shared with a friend is not enough. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O - Very solid Red ale with IPA characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a big fan of this beer. Part of that was expecting something more with it being Lagunitas, but this just didn’t hit the spot. I would not have it again."
""
""
""
""
"Easily one of the best concoctions to come from Lagunitas. The bottle caught my eye amongst the ever growing lineup of 24 oz. craft brews showing up around the supermarkets in California, and the uniqueness of the beer reflected the bottle art. Expecting something like an imperial red IPA, I was pleasantly surprised to find something much more mild and easily drinkable. Amber with tonal red accents would be better to describe the Mondo Large Red here. Only slightly sharp and tangy (or maybe zesty) characteristics, which is surprising considering the ABV. Overall I call the taste unique and perhaps complex - hops that will remind you of a well brewed IPA rather than a red. A nicely palatable fall beer that pairs well with a hearty roast pork loin meal."
"Overall, I have to concur that this is a good value. Reminds me of a lighter version of Double Bastard or the Heavy Seas Big DIPA I had a couple days ago. Basically a solid (and cheap) entry into the American light barleywine category."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Bueno. The toasted sugars flavors of the malt tend to take over, especially as it warms. However, the bitterness of the hops keeps this one from being completely one side. Definitely a unique beer."
"I'm a noob when it comes to craft beer but this was an exceptional beer for the price... Even though the ABV is 8.65% it's masked by the flavorful filler in the beer itself. Fruity overtones-not in a bad way-it's a delicious beer...Get it while it's hot! The label is pretty bad ass, too..."
"Not necessarily what I expect in a Red but who cares, this is is really good."
""
""
""
"O- While I don't like it quite as much as the Imperial Red, it's still a great brew and one of the first I'd ever had from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When reading ""A Mondo Large Red Ale"" I was expecting a deep chestnut, boozy, syrupy unbalanced beer. I was immediately surprised, however, to pour a nice amber beer with moderate red hues. The smell was familiar for a Lagunitas beer, but then gave way to aromas of fruit cake. It coated the pallet smoothly and slowly, building in apparent body, with mounting tanginess and heat. Very pleasant for a Fall day such as this."
""
""
"It's an outstanding beer."
""
""
""
""
"On a recent kick of hoppy red ales, I've been enjoying the local varieties from Lawson's (Steve's Back Yard Red Ale), Maine Beer Company (Zoe),and most notably and refined, Fiddlehead Ruby Claire, with an incredible nose and finish accomplished by dry hopping with simcoe. Lucky 13 is pretty boring,quite malty, and overrated IMO."
""
""
"O: This beer is a dangerous one. The ABV doesn't really show and it's nice and smooth. Creamy with citrus and resin combined in a flattering spice profile to marry with the rich toasted caramel malts. Affordable and delicious, a true winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy malts squelch out most of the kilned notes. Apple-like hops are rich with sweetness and floral tones. Not really dank, after all, but mildly bitter behind sweet nutty malt grains. Notes of caramel and treacle syrup that never become too pronounced. Tastes fresh with a zippy pep of implied spice. Totals out with some fumage from the almost 9% ABV. Dangerously drinkable in its smoothness. Warms the belly, which can't quite catch up to the tongue's warning. Body has some stickiness, but retains a creamy nature that is a big positive for the feel. Carbonation is mostly soft, with some collective sizzle under the lips. Nice beer. Not stereotypically Lagunitas, in a good way."
""
""
"O: Not bad, but nothing I'd be in a big hurry to repeat. The Lucky 13.alt is superior, in my opinion."

"This is absolutely fantastic. The hoppiness is well balanced off sweet malt which is well balanced off noticeable booziness, with spicy hops behind it all. Just a great drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - yummy brew and interesting to consider and ponder over."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"A very nice, hoppy amber. The beer is balanced from nose to taste to finish. Very smooth. This one is a winner."
""
"Overall a nicely crafted beer that is very well balanced and not to hoppy for those that aren't used to a dominant hop presence. I still prefer Wilco Tango Foxtrot over this brew, but won't hesistate to pick this up again."
""
""
"O: A really nice, easy drinking imperial red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is earthy and full, decadent and has plenty of hop goodness. The balance is such that the no one characteristic over takes the others. It has a medium body and drinks toward the heavier side because of all the bread. Malty and fantastic with pungent hops and a good bitter too."
"VERY GOOD; GRAB ONE!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was one of my favorites. I will be getting more soon."
""
""
""
"The balance in this beer is really nice. It definitely stacks up to the other red ales out there. For the ABV and price it's one of the best. I'm glad to see that at 8.65% they still managed to pull off a nice flavor. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Lucky 13 is a winner, especially for this price and level of alcohol. Not that intoxication is the main purpose of enjoying a beer of this caliber, but when you're intending on drinking a single bomber in an evening, and perhaps on a limited budget, this may be a factor for some types. I'll drink this beer again."
""
""
"This is a good beer, especially considering the price-tag. Really well built and balanced for the size that it is. I'd definitely suggest this."
""
""
""
"O: A very, very good red ale. I've had a few different red ales and they are either very boring or too hoppy. This one seems to find the right balance of hop and malt for the style. Another win for Lagunitas!"

"This is quite possibly my favorite Red Ale... it hits all of the right marks and its delicious to boot... nice rich malty sweetness that is bolstered by a big wave of piney hoppiness and finishes long and smooth... its a very sneaky ABV as it drinks quite easily... terrific to look at with a pungent aroma... a terrific beer..."
""
"Overall- this is a fantastic beer. if i was shopping for a big red ale, this would be it ! The only thing I would like to see is a tad more head retention. Otherwise stellar."

"O: This beer has interesting complexities in the taste, akin to a lighter version of an American Barleywine. It's a pleasant beer to sip."
""
""
""
""
""
"D -A rather unique American Amber / Red Ale... The 77 IBU seems a bit understated as this one is packed with pungent bitterness... The mentholyptus notes I pick up several facets are a wee bit off putting, but also add a rather unique character... An interesting brew worth exploring, but not something I will revisit regularity..."
""
""
"A nice red color in the glass. About a two finger head that fades quickly, not much lacing to speak of. The nose is basically all malt, but the body of the beer showcases the hops. The malt is all but lost until the finish--I found a malty and hoppy aftertaste with this beer. Somewhat dry finish. Kind of an odd beer, I think, but very good. I don't have a lot of points of comparison with this one. It smells like a pale ale, hits like a scotch ale, and finishes with the bitterness of an IPA. In any event, I'm not complaining."
""
""
""
"Sweet malts are there on the front end, but don't overwhelm. The sweetness fades into a nice hop bitterness that lingers. It's smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation for the alcohol content. Being somewhat of a hophead, I look for balance between malt and hops in a beer and this one has it. IMO, it potentially suits a wide range of palates, from those who prefer sweeter ambers to IPA enthusiasts such as myself who want to adventure away from extreme IBU once in a while."
""
"It poured a deep copper amber with a substantial off white head. There were sweet malts and a strong citrus and fruity hop on the nose. The initial taste was signature Lagunitas' grapefruit and citrus hops and I knew I was going to enjoy this beer. The flavor had much more depth than the initial hop love. There were notes of caramel and toasted grain malts underneath the tropical fruit, citrus and apricot hop flavors. The taste profile was deep and varied and took my palate on a ride with each sip. The Lucky #13 is the best Imperial Red Ale I have had."

"This brew goes big in flavor, power, style, & delivery. Rich, autumn color with a gorgeous orange-cream head. Fantastic mouthfeel lets you experience all of the malts, fruity hops, & bitters in a delicious palate of flavor. One of my all-time favorites. Seasonal release for May but you can usually find it until late summer. Definitely one of Lagunitas' most successful brews."
""
"O: One of my favorite beers from this brewery and in general. If you are looking for a great American take on a red ale look no further."
"This is a fantastic amber ale. It has a great malt character but an even more profound, deep hop character. The balance and drinkability here is fantastic and the ABV is no where to be found. This is really a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o. This is a really good beer, from an amazing brewery. Gonna grab a bottle to age."
"O: Lagunitas continues to impress. This is a fun and unique take on the amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ha a pint on tap at Rattlesnake. Impressed the bartender warned in advance that it is 8.5 percent. Poured a standard copper color with nice lacing. The head is what stood out and it lingered for some time. I read someone else who thought he got a yea aroma from this, and after a few drinks I get the same. Not sure if I like that. However it does have a nice sweetness to it, and the malt and hoppy combination is well done. Nice carbonated taste and solid beer...but damn I am thinking of Nestea right now.."
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: There was quite a bit of bitterness in my first few sips, but then it just started tasting like a red ale ought to, and it was just pleasantly sweet. There's sweetness on the front. On the middle. And almost equally (a bit of bitterness from the 76 IBUs is there) on the back. Hits your tongue with an incredibly creamy mouthfeel, and then your mouth just gets covered in glorious red ale goodness. This may be (or is really close to) the best red ale that I've ever had. It has all those sweet ""red"" flavors you'd expect, but there's a nice, signature Lagunitas hop-bite on the finish. I've heard some describe this beer as drying, but I don't often find any beer as sweet as I find this one to be drying... I guess I'd only go as far as saying it's semi-dry. There's about 9% ABV on this, and the alcohol basically doesn't come through at all. The aftertaste has a very slight warmth or trace of it, but I don't think the average beer drinking would have any idea that this is clocking in at nearly 9%."

"Overall: this is a killer beer at a killer price. I will certainly by one every time I see it. It reminds me why I love malty beers. Love the malt mixture and the creaminess. Must try for the big red and malt lovers"
""
"O. This is exactly what I would want out of a strong red ale. Absolutely nailed it, even if it's not my first choice of style."

"O: A very very good beer. Ambers are not my thing, but this one is great."
""

"Medium thickness in the mouthfeel with no notice of the alcohol. I enjoyed this very much and asked for a second serving. I've never seen this in bottles but will start looking for it now. Highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice amber color with about 2 fingers of head. The smell is wonderful. Hops are abundant and certainly some citrus notes. Being an IPA drinker, I loved the presence of hops. The taste was excellent. Smooth with a nice bitterness to it. The taste leaves you craving more. As you drink, it leaves a nice lacey finish around the glass. Definitely the best amber ale that I have had. It's actually going down a little too smoothly! Overall, another great beer from Lagunita's. Well done."

"The pour from the bottle to the Pint glass showed a wonderful deep amber brew with a glorious tan head which left nice lace in its wake, aroma was hops dominated with some alcohol in the background which is what Lagunitas smells like. Taste again was hops forward that lingered for a bit on the tongue, the malt stepped up right after that for a nice finish that left the mouth clean and without hop bitter. Mouthfeel was clean and after the hops flair, smooth and well rounded. Overall it's a good brew but the hop smack reminds me of most of the Lagunitas offerings...not a bad thing really but I would've liked a tad more malts and sugars peeking out instead. Great price for a bomber and I try any beer at least once, at $4.50 a Bomber how can you say no?"
""
"The crispness is light but consistent and solid, allowing for a nice, flowing smoothness to reign in the feel throughout a medium body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good imperial red -- recommended if you like the style. Would drink again."
""
"O: Lucky 13's savory, rich and intense character is unique among Red Ales. Most Red Ales I've had straddle between a Lager and an actual Red Ale. Yeah, you're gonna get knocked the eff out by this brew. High alcohol content, generous amount of high quality ingredients. How have I not found this brew sooner?"
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Lagunitas Brewing Co. is one that has never let me down with all of their beers. They have a knack for brewing and do it well. Keep it up guys!"
""
""
""
"Overall another fantastic offering from Lagunitas. My current favorite amber. Very reminiscent of Troegs Nugget Nectar but a little sweeter. The ABV is very well-hidden. Affordable and delicious. Wish I had a case!"
""
"A superb red ale. About as good as it gets for the style. A masterfully crafted brew with its intriguing complexity and yet beautiful simplicity as all you taste in the end is malt and hops. Just phenomenal!"
""
""
""
""
"I've been locked into IPAs for some time now but this was a much enjoyed departure. I will definitely be picking up more of these down the road."
"O- a really and good unique beer"

"O - Chase the white whales if you wish, Lagunitas and Stone make World Class brews for the everyman and they are killing it! Get some joker..."
""
"The smell merely hints at the taste, which echoes - offering a bold blend of pine and hops with oak and caramel malts leading to a creamy warming finish. The bubbles from the ample carbonation adds to the creamy mouthful one gets. Lagunitas has proven to be an outstanding California brewer and this one is one of their best offerings that I have tried so far."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall another great beer from lagunitas. recommended!"
"I enjoyed this one so much that I went and picked up another five bottles of it this morning, lest they all be sold out in the imminent future. This is the type of beer that doesn't sit unattended on the shelves for all that long, and it's no wonder why."
"Overall this was very enjoyable and easy to drink. Probably my favorite Lagunitas thus far"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In the end, I wish this had more hop bite and bitterness. It’s super drinkable at 8.9% ABV and tasty, but a bit tame on the aroma and flavor for me."

"Overall: This tastes like a classic lagunitas. This is problably my favorite Lagunitas and my favorite Red Ale thus far, It is very well balanced. I get both an explosion in hop character and sweet fruits in my palate. I would definitely buy this again."
"overall: A great beer from Lagunitas. Easily one of their better ones, is it just me or do a lot of their beers taste really similar? They seem to all have the same sugary sweetness, this one may take the cake though, it has the sweetness of Undercover and Sumpin Sumpin, but with the earthy, fruity hoppiness to back it up."
""
"D: really fantastic stuff here. glad I got this pretty fresh (or at least it sure does taste that way) considering no date coding... regardless for the price (I think I paid $6) is beyond worth it. well done lagunitas, well done."
""

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Not too surprising, but another good IPA by Lagunitas. A little more accentuated on the hops then some other of their brews and a little less balanced, but very tasty and enjoyable."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 5/4/2013. Pours lightly cloudy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big orange zest, tangerine, grapefruit, orange rind, floral, pine, grass, caramel, toast, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, floral, orange rind, caramel, toast, pine, grass, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, citrus rind, floral, pine, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hoppiness; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent hoppy imperial red ale. All around great balance and complexity of hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering as expected from this brewery."

"Pours amber with a thick two finger khaki head. Lots of lacing while drinking this beer. Typical lagunitas aroma, lots of citrus hops, mostly grapefruit and pineapple. Seems no matter what style they make it always seems more IPA than anything else. The taste keeps the citrus going, grapefruit seems to overwhelm all other comers. Very nice bitterness in the finish. This is the hoppyest Red Ale that I can recall I've had. It's very nice, Lagunitas never let's me down. Great price point for a bomber."

"Lagunitas Lucky 13 Mondo Large Red Ale ---4/5."
""

"Poured into a pint glass, clear amber color with minimal carbonation and a thick tan head that dies down to a thin line of bubbles and laces the glass. Fresh pine and citrus hops in the nose with some alcohol in the background. Toasted and caramel malts with a pine and citrus hop flavor. The mouthfeel is on the creamy and heavy side. A smooth feel to it. The hops linger in the finish along with a peppery alcohol bite."

"O: A very good hoppy amber. Reminds me a lot of Zoe, which is my favorite in the style. A little bit more of a kick, but still nice and hoppy to go along with a strong malt backbone. Great price point as always with Lagunitas, and a solid seasonal"

"Impressive Red Ale from the West. If you like Nugget Nectar you should try this."

"This beer is full bodied with a creamy texture. This beer is tasty when it's fresh for sure."
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass. Copper dark orange with a fluffy white head that sticks to the glass leaving lots of delicate lacing. Smells fruity and hoppy and floral, with a strong sweet clean malt behind it. A little hint of alcohol in the smell as well. Taste is a smooth but slightly spiky sweet malt with a fruity and slightly bitter hop finish. Alcohol is pretty present, as this is pretty strong as red ales go. Delicious though."
""
""
""
"22oz bottle poured into a 25oz snifter, the ale is reddish-brown ale capped with a huge beige head that holds outstanding retention and leaves thick, chunky lacing as it fades. Aromas are caramel malts, toasted grain, juicy, dank citric grapefruit. Nice balance and complexity with caramel, brown sugar, bread crust, toasted grain, grapefruit, pine. Fuller body, creamy, and smooth on the palate while finishing fairly bitter but sweet also. Alcohol is warming and a little hot at times, but overall this is a stellar big red - one of my favorite pseudo-styles."

""

"Overall, what a great beer. Maybe a slight bit watery but alcohol remains hidden and the hop/malt balance is nearly perfect."

"L: Lagunitas seems to consistently come through with great beers and this is no exception. As normal expect aggressive fruity hop flavors in the West Coast style."

"So happy to see the red back. I mean, blondes are great and all, but reds are just more my speed. Lucky 13 has a beautiful red pour with an incredible head. The aroma is typical dank Lagunitas, perhaps with some more caramel and spicy tones than others in the lineup. The taste is fantastic, a fantastic resinous, earthy, and piney hop integrates perfectly with a big caramel malt base. This is seriously a good, tasty beer, and much better than the .alt version."

"Overall: This is very similar to their Imperial Red Ale. In fact, I copied my review and changed a few words. However, I would say that this is a little bigger and sweeter, and ultimately not quite as good. But still very good."
"Overall this is a pretty powerful beer with a solid malt backbone and I presume a relatively high gravity. Might be fun to get this in 6-packs, but one bomber is enough for me."
""
""
""
""
"They hit it for a big red ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very impressed by this mondo large red beer, only second beer ive had from lagunitas but im fast becoming a fan. will definitely drink again because its not expensive (4.99) and very good."
" The flavor has a tangy synergy of yeast and hops with tropical taste of grapefruit and mango with some light vegetal elements leading me to believe this was dryhopped. There is an orange rind element in the taste which brings a zesty overall taste with some sweetness in the malt support and alcohol boost. The hops have a nice flavor and slight grassiness but still seems to blend well with the yeast flavor. Overall I think this is a great beer for the value - very juicy hop flavor and the only drawback to have multiples is the elevated alcohol level."
"O - A pleasant beer however it wasn't as hop forward as i thought it would be. Still very tasty and cheap."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a big beautiful and hoppy red ale. it tastes good, is priced well and is very inoffensive and well made if you like hoppy beer. It's everything I'd expect from a lagunitas beer."
""
"O - It's hard to call this a malt bomb because it's so balanced. This is a really good beer. If you're like me and feel that most American strong ales are a bit of an unbalanced taste-bud assault, give this a try."
""
""
""
"Very good, though I expected more malt from a red beer. The hops was unexpected, but enjoyed. I love grapefruit!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a little above average, and certainly not disappointing for its price, but not what I remembered it being from last year. This year it does seem to be much more the amber it advertises than the DIPA it seemed like in memory. Still tons of hop as the 77 IBUs can attest. Probably not seeking out more of this, but not unhappy to be drinking it."
"Overall - Another Lagunitas beer, another sweet red grapefruit bomb. I realize this is their signature hop profile, and I do love it, but do we really need a dozen beers that all taste nearly identical? But hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it right? Nickelback and Linkin Park release the same formulated songs time and time again, and they're successful, right? Ahh, I digress. This is good, but if you've never had this before, don't expect much of a difference from their other releases."
""
""
"it's been awhile since i've had a lagunitas, and it's very nice to reacquaint myself with lucky 13."
""
""
"O: A very nice red. As an IPA fan, I think I prefer this to their Censored copper ale, as it has a bit more hop bitterness in the finish. Enjoyable in its own right, but also might be a good beer to introduce someone into greater hops of an IPA."
""
""
"O- 6/10 Nothing special from Lagunitas. It's like drinking another one of their session beers. It's always a poor level of balance from these brewers. I'm not impressed. I sure will be buying these 22s because I get them for 3.99, but it is only because I enjoy their style of beer. Lucky 13 may only be for the beer advocates but it sure doesn't live up to the BJCP style guidelines."

"Beautiful pour: color, aroma and head are all delicious even before introducing this beer to the palate. Once introduced this beer yields an initial sweetness that soon builds into strong yet manageable hop characteristics. Finishes semi-sweet. This beer circles the palate and ends very nicely. Complex yet very drinkable. A"

"Killer beer in that over the top but balanced style that Lagunitas owns. I thought this was a DIPA due to the huge hops and big piny finish. I loved the mouthfeel as it was huge yet velvet smooth. No rough edges yet complexity from every sip. I need to get some more of this as the BC government stores stockpiled it at $6.35 each."

"Review from 6/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark red amber. Minimal off-white head with light lacing. Nice pine and citrus hop start with a medium sweet malt body. Citrus hop finish and lingering aftertaste. Medium bodied. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color. There is a discernable peach tint as the beer leaves the mouth of the bottle and waterfalls into the glass. A foamy, off white head appears and lingers, but for no longer than the average ale. There is a wonderful, rich aroma of butterscotch offset by sweet citrus. Creamy mouthfeel that almost seems misplaced. A mild scrubbing appears on the rear of the tongue, likely due more to hop heat than carbonation, as the beer finishes. The flavors are complex. Not necessarily complimentary, but interesting. Sweet, bold malt brings an undeniable, vibrant toffee flavor, followed immediately by some pretty obtrusive hop resin. This is a pretty large effort on the part of Lagunitas for number 13. I like it because it is irreverent and disrespectful, but quite good."

"Very nice flavor on this beverage. Very strong in its price range. Maybe just a bit too sweet for the style imo, but still a very drinkable beer."
""
"O- a great anniversary present to us all. I can really appreciate an ale that is hoppy and a little sweet all at the same time."
""
""
"Overall- it feels like a bit of false advertising to call this an amber/red but I would recommend it to someone in a minute. I'm pleasantly surprised."
""
"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a clear, orange/golden colour with a decent amount of carbonation. Smells very hoppy and citrus like. Tastes more of tropical fruits mixed with a citrus hoppy finish. The 8.9% alcohol is well hidden on this and it makes for a very nice mouthfeel. This brewery keeps pumping out quality beers."
""
""
""
""
""

"Enjoyable beer. Citrus and pine flavors cut the occasionally overly sweet red feeling of this beer. Not something I would session but a pleasing one off."

"Overall: Quite nice, for such a heavy beer. I could see buying this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprised that it’s so light. Up there with some of my favorite reds ie nugget nector, great example of style. Most reds seemed to be under malted over hopped brown ales. A bit too strong to have high drinkability but taste great and its great for sipping and enjoying"
""
"Love it! Double Amber or Double IPA? Either way, you must pick this up!"
"overall: fantastic, should be more of an ipa than a red ale"
""
""

"O- I LOVE this beer it's always something to look forward to in the summer! Pick it up!!"

"O) Damn this was good. The more I drink of Lagunitas, the more this brewery impresses me. I wish I had more than 1 bottle. This is top notch, and I highly recommend."
""
""
"DRINKABILITY: This is definitely a winner but because of the high alcohol content, it's sipping beer, not a session beer as are many other amber ales. It's perhaps a little more hoppy than a typical amber ale but that is a positive distinguishing characteristic. The beer has a decent price to value tradeoff and I'd definitely buy it again."
""
""

""
""

""
""

""
""

"O: What an enjoyable beer. I really didn't see this one coming even with the ratings. I would love to have this one again for sure."
""
"O- first and foremost, I am not a malt bomb kinda dude, but this takes the cake on that concept. Massive flavor all over with a caramel malt taste that dominates. Lagunitas, you continue to be one of the best breweries out there!"

""
""
""

""

"O - Very nice amber ale. I have been holding on to this for a few months so it is not as fresh as it maybe should be, but either way, another very solid offering from a great brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Slightly sweet red fruit and plum malts up front are quickly balanced by grape skin/pine bitterness. Mouthfeel is thick and rich. Sweet/bitter axis is well balanced, vacillating between brief mirages that its leans sweet or bitter at any moment. Pleasantly over the top. Notes of candied, juicy rasp-strawberry, lime, brown sugar, toasted earth, and kumquat. Pine/citrus bitterness is somewhat pithy and rough especially in the finish. Finish has notes of pine, green herbs, and is quite dry. Lingers tacky and thick on the tongue."
""

"Overall: I liked very much. A very good brew from a fantastic brewery. Worthy of buying again."

"Overall: This red ale caught me by surprise, I basically picked it up off a friend's dare. I've had Lagunita's WTF before, while it was good this is a better offering in my opinion. I'm slightly partial to IPA/Red ales though. The price was decent for the size too, would definitely buy more if it was more known in my area."

"An excellent beer by Lagunitas, made better by the fact that I found it on draft and brought a growler home..."
""
""
""
"Served with a nice, foamy, frothy, off white head that settled out after a bit and plenty of lace. Color is a clear dark amber. Aroma is on the mild side, malt, hop, caramel. Flavor has a lot more going on - similar to nose, plus roast, nutmeats, toffee, leather. Body and carbonation are perfect for style. Finish is like flavor, tapers off nicely and stays true. Good drinking beer. Yessir."

"O: Yuck. Total malt-bomb. No balance. I hadn't met a Lagunitas beer I didn't like. Until now."
"O - This is definitely an enjoyable brew. It really blurs the lines between amber, red, and IPA. The alcohol is completely masked and I could see this being quite a dangerous brew if you had more than 1 on hand..."
"It's a bit overblown and not what I would expect from the listed style of amber/red ale. Not sure what to think here but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again."
"Overall - TAsty and real smooth, more so then i expected. Very well balanced and easy to enjoy. Slighty more hoppy then the average red ale, which aint a bad thing. Worth a drink for sure."
"Overall - I am continually blown away by Lagunitas, and this is no exception. The 8.9% ABV is perfectly hidden. The progression of flavors is so nice. Nice complexity and full flavored. What a nice ale. Highly recommend, will definitely purchase this whenever it is available."
"O- My favorite beer so far of 2011, and I've had a lot. One of my favorite releases from Lagunitas, and on taste alone, it's #1. It's not a perfect 5.0, as there is a tiny bit of coppery aftertaste when it leaves the mouth, but with an ABV of 8.9%, that's to be expected and shouldn't be held against it too much. Very nice release and would recommend this to anyone."
"Very nice copper color and lacing as it goes down. The aroma was a precursor to the unexpected hoppiness. I am a hop head but the mega 'pine' hop flavor in this beer seemed unwelcome. I expected this to be better. I did like the splash of plum/fruit flavor in the middle, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's too much going on, in a bad way in this particular one. Very 'boozy.' I don't understand the reviewers who feel that it's balanced. This is my first Lagunitas offering, and I def. want to give them another try though."
"O- a very good beer. I actually like it a lot. Its got the best of both worlds, tastes like a red from the get but then transitions into a flavoer like an IPA. Good stuff Lagunitas!"
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a light brownish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops and citrus. Taste is piney hops up front, some citrus and malts, considerable bitterness at the finish. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable brew."
"This is one to sip which gives one time to think of all that Lagunitas has done in its 13 years."
"Right up front...I'm a pretty big fan of Lagunitas brews, so there might be some built-in bias to this review. With that said, I have to say this beer did not disappoint. I was pleasantly surprised at the hoppiness of this beer - totally wasn't expecting it. I'll likely buy a couple more bombers to squirrel away and enjoy another day."
"O: It's a malt strong DIPA, which describes approximately 90% of Lagunitas's offerings."
"Future outlook: Another winner for Lagunitas, and a relative ""bomber bargain"" @ $4.99. Will have to nab a few more of these..."
"O - Well balanced flavors for an amber ale with this amount of alcohol content. More on the hoppy side, which is great for you hopheads."
"O: Very good, a good diversion from Hop Stoopid but still in the same ballpark, except a bit more Belgian-y throughout. Might be tough to finish a whole bottle alone though due to the sweetness creeping."
"Check out the .alt version of this one too!"
"Drinkability- A good red ale, but not completely to style. VERY pleasant drinking tho."
"Overall: I really like the balancing act this beer pulls off. Solid bitterness along with a complex flavor."
"Thanks to sweetwillyrolbar for this awesome bottle. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Poured vigorously, this yields a two fingers width crown, with a sea of beautiful reddish-amber beneath. This has a pretty sweet, malt forward nose. Some hints of vanilla and caramel buried amid the other scents. The taste is really sublime. Where's this one been all my life? I could definitely make a habit out of drinking THIS stuff. The taste too is on the malty side, but it's not over powering. There's a hidden kinda sweet, fruity, nutty undertone to the flavor profile that is very pleasant. This one goes down so easy. All in all, I really dig this beer. Chalk one up for Lagunitas. This is a winner."
"A good amber DIPA"
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I truly enjoyed drinking this beer and plan on buying enough to last me for a very long time."
"Go grab one yourself, cheers!"
"My second of the Lagunitas line (hop stoopid being the first). Poured a bit lighter than anticipated; with a cream, two finger head and pale amber color. Sweet and hoppy at the front with a nice raisiny sweetness on the finish. Not too thick either, which I like, and plenty of carbonation. Makes for a overall tasty, strong, but drinkable brew."
"-Copper, fairly clear with a thin, sticky head with great cling. Restrained, piney aroma. Resinous hops, some caramel sweetness that finishes clean with just a little but not too much lingering spruce bitterness. Smooth, mouthfeel with a bit of prickly carbonation. The high abv is very restrained."
"Pours a burnt orange color that has some hazy red hues to it. It grows about an inch of eggshell white head that dissipates quickly into a ring and patches of bubbles. It smells of citrus (grapefruit, orange), plenty of hops as is the Lagunitas way, some grass and herbs, and a nice malt base. Tastes similar, with an emphasis on the hops and citrus. A caramel malt backbone plays nicely throughout the drink, and helps smooth out the bitterness of the hops. Has a nice, medium bodied mouth that finishes very well (not too dry or sticky wet). Overall, a solid beer and one that I always look forward to."
"A good red ale, but the resiny sweetness is a little rough, a bomber of this may be a bit too much for me."
"Another great beer bargain at $4.99."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Once again, Lagunitas comes through with a tasty, boozy, affordable taste explosion. Keep rocking Lagunitas!"
"Definitely worth a try. Highly recommended."
"O: Usually I would say that ""anything"" from Lagunitas is amazing. BUT, this is the first beer from them that I don't really care that much for. Good, definitely. Great, by no means. For $6.50 a bottle, no complains though. Cheers."
"I really enjoy this beer. It's a yin/yang of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. The flavor is pleasant, and it's too easy to drink given its masked-high alcohol."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the big hoppy flavoring. For a red ale it is always nice to see gratuitous use of hops, while not straying too far away from the origins of the beer. The flavors here were complex, but yet well blended and seemingly simplistic. This is another homerun for Lagunitas."
"O - The flavors are great in this beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable red ale."
"Very nice beverage and one that I'll buy again."
"This is an excellent beer. Pick up a bottle if you come across it."
"Great red ale, always worth a try."
"A definitive and delicious version of the style. One of my favorite big reds."
"O: This is just personal preference here: When I'm in the mood for a West Coast Imperial Red Ale, I prefer a cake batter hop bomb (eg. Green Flash Hop Head Red). But once again, that's just personal preference."
"D: Really a fantastic amber. A great investment for amber or red ale lovers."
"Overall - I'm really liking these hoppy ambers - and this one is damn good!"
"D - Definitely a great beer and put in front of me I could drink quite a few but it is quite a strong beer."
"This is a good beer. It sports the Lagunitas trademark sweet taste. My only complaint is that every Lagunitas beer tastes remarkably similar. Pours a reddish hue with a decent loose head. This one is sweet, malty and clean, with enough alcohol to make an impact. With little carbonation, this is a good sipper. Pretty decent."
"O- Great appearance and good taste. The bitterness may be just a little off balance."
"Overall: A strong malty red ale with a robust hop profile to match. Not one of my favorite styles, but I recognize its merit and can appreciate it."
"O - Perhaps the above description doesn't adequately demonstrate my satisfaction with this brew. I enjoyed it tremendously, what with its bright hoppy flavors, and it's malty sweetness. A very enjoyable alt. Laguinitas does a great job on just about everything they touch. They were at the Charlottesville VA brewfest last year and I hope they bring something special this year!"
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Light copper orange in color with a reddish hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a stiff bright white foamy head with excellent head retention. Foam left rows of sticky lacings on the glass. Grapefruit hop and sweet caramel malt aromas are dominant with a hint of pine hop as well. Very crisp, fresh aroma. On the heavier side of medium bodied with a delicate smooth feel from beginning to end with just a touch of resinous feel at the finish. Nice balance of citrus grapefruit and caramal malt flavor from beginning to end with pine hop bitterness flavors becoming more prominent at the finish. Finishes clean with a light pine bitterness. This was excellent."
"Mouthfeel is thick but not quite chewy and warming. Overall, I'm enjoying this barleywine, wait I mean strong ale, wait no... it's an imperial red. Ahh style semantics, it doesn't really matter in the end because this is one delicious beer."
"O- This is a tasty offering from Lagunitas. A beer which runs the gamut from buttery caramel malt to citrusy hop bitterness. The flavors are skillfully melded together to create a very drinkable and enjoyable red ale."
"I most def enjoyed this beer, once again wasn't let down! Cheers"
"O: drinkable, yes. I would have this beer again. I picked up a 22oz bottle for $4.50."
"Overall-This beer is phenomenal. Glad I picked this one up for 4 bucks. This would be agreat beer to introduce someone to a IIPA. Although it's not a IIPA, it's hopped like some, and it's very smooth. Maybe the best Amber I've ever had(I haven't had that many) Highly reccomended."
"I will take #13 any day....who said its unlucky...this beer is good!!! The Lucky 13 is a rich amber ale with ecru creamy head that is lacing beautifully!!!! The smell is a nice malt with sweet undertones!!! The taste is a pure full bodies red ale with malt and sweet caramel. The ABV is high...but you cannot sense it. This beer is perfectly balanced. The problem is I would try to session and destroy myself...oh well."
"overall - a great brew, had no idea what to expect, bold and generous on the palate, a wrecker"
"Very good release. Would purchase again."
"OVERALL. A+++ BEST BEER ON BA? I say top 3. Hop Stoopid close behind this. TRY IT!"
"D: Pretty pleased with this beer, but I really, really do like red ales so I guess I wasn't taking much of a risk here."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and pleasant on palate. Drinks nicely, and I was pleasantly surprised to see this wasn't another overly boozy malt bomb from Lagunitas. I'll drink this again."
"Pours the color of a fresh new penny, clean and clear, thin cap of yellow white head with some very sticky rings. Scent is pure Lagunitas west coast hop - grapefruit and bitter pine - with some brown sugary sweet malt. Taste is quite strong on the grapefruit, some pine resin, with enough sweet malt to cut into the overall bitterness. Medium bodied, thinner feeling then the boldness of the scent and taste dictate, goes down clean and smooth...would like a touch of creaminess. Overall I'm a huge fan of hopped up ambers and this is one of the best, though well behind Nugget Nectar in all areas.."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being about average for the style. Overall it's a very solid beer. Some great hoppy flavors to it and enough of a malty presence to keep things interesting. Very enjoyable beer overall."
"On tap. Pours a translucent amber color with a thin ring of head. Lots of lacing. Great hoppy aroma. Citrus and tropical fruits. Taste is more of the same. Nice hoppy flavor with a dry, piney finish. Tropical fruits as well. Pineapple is most prevelant. Dangerously drinkable. Awesome hoppy red ale. Has some of that signature hoppy Lagunitas taste. Overall, worth seeking out."
"O: I loved this beer, although I may have a bit of a bias for supercharged amber ales. And this one is no different; Delicious."
"Lucky 13 poured into a tulip glass. Looks dark orange, crisp and clear. Nice smell - floral, citrus, spicy, sweet. Tastes pretty much the same. It has a tangy, sweet taste. Excellent balance of malts and hops. Smooth mouthfeel. I really love those strong amber ales. Good one, Lagunitas!"
"A silky, smooth creamy ale with nice nutty flavour and plenty of balance. Solid."
"For $3.49, are you kidding me - that's an outstanding value for an incredible beer."
"Overall an interesting sipper. Just not for me."
"O- Note a bad brew at all. Worth picking up if you're a fan of Lagunitas, or the style. Enjoyed this one."
"Pours a deep copper color that borders on redness. Stingy beige head dissipates quite quickly. Smells of dark caramel and toffee mixed with some grapefruit pine and orange. Tastes smooth with caramel, dark sugars, toffee starting each sip until the citric attack somewhere in the middle. Grapefruit, orange, and apricot cut through the sweetness and meld into a long lingering almost earthy bitterness that's covered in brown sugar. Medium to thick body, lower medium amount of carbonation with a sweet almost sticky mouthfeel. I can't find any bottling dates on this one, but I suspect that this bottle isn't the freshest example of this beer even though I purchased this today at a somewhat reputable store. That being said I really enjoyed this beer. I would have liked a bit more hop, but as is this is still a damn tasty brew. Lagunitas I'm starting to really dig ya."
"O - It's a Nice hoppy amber, close to great."
"Lucky 13.alt Bottle from Madison Wine Exchange.. Opened 06/17/2011.. This new edition is encouraging, Lagunitas i like your style. Its nose holds hop, citrusy pine, grilled orange and buttery. Mouthfeel once beer settles is thick & smooth. Certainly grab a bottle before its gone and judge it with your own personal touch. 93points.."
" ~ This is a very fine tasting and feeling beverage. The look is average and the aroma is run of the mill. That being said, I would still certainly recommend this to a friend."
"O: A fine ""Imperialized"" Red..."
"O: Lucky 13 isn't even close to the best brew I've had from Lagunitas. It's not bad, but the overdose of alcohol on the palate really hurts this one. If they'd tweak it a bit here and there, this could be a really killer bottle of beer. In the meantime, I'd look elsewhere to get your Amber fix."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazed copper coloring with a chunky, light, fluffy cream colored head. Nose is slightly sour malt, mild hops, and peppery spices. The aromas are similar to a lot of DIPAs. The beer is round and robust in mouth, with the malt carrying most of the load, and the spices picking up the tail end. Spiced flavors include pepper and cardamom. The beer has a semi-sweet aftertaste, with a slight citrus hint at the very end. The finish is semi-sweet, also, with a slight sour balance. Flavors also remind me of some DIPAs. Beer leaves a great, thick lacing on the glass while you drink. Solid brew."
"D/O: While comparisons of this beer to Lagunitas Wilco Tango Foxtrot may be appropriate, the Lucky 13 is the maltier of the two--seeming unbalanced in that direction despite the detectable hop influences. It is extreme for the style, considering the unusual sensory qualities, and would make an interesting player in a malt/hops contrast to Stone Arrogant Bastard. The aggressively malty backbone encourages pairing with zesty savory food, especially tomato-based sauces or soups."
"The taste is equally complex with an explosion of deep toasty malt full of dried fig, raisin, brown sugar, and pungent white pepper. Finishes with a lingering hops bitterness to complement the sweet malts."
"Pours a reddish-brown, has a thick, beige-colored head. I thought it was hoppier than other reviewers noted, I got an upfront bitterness, almost a pine-like hop taste (as with SN Torpedo). Taste is big, bold flavors of dark fruit, slight caramel, hops, alchohol is noticeable at 8.56% abv. It isn't very ""drinkable"" for me because of the higher ABV, but it is a good beer. The bottle I tried was perhaps a year old anyways, so a fresher one would probably taste better."
"Overall I like this beer in the aspect of drinkability and alcohol content. Excellent beer for session and daily."
"I imagine this probably had a little bit more hop zing to it when it was fresh (I've been meaning to crack this for like 6 months), but I still found it to be delicious, and pretty damn awesome. Surprise surprise, another awesome beer from Lagunitas."
"T: very complex flavor; it's like a mean, bitter barleywine; do I detect tickling the umami part of our taste buds?; it's surely not out to please everyone, but those looking for a dark complex beer--it's yours"
"Tried this outstanding beer with my good BA beer drinking buddy Arithmeticus. The beer, surprisingly, was a dark red (yes, that was sarcasm) with a moderate head and nice lacing. The nose reminded me of a barleywine with cocoa overtones. The taste was extremely complex. It tasted like a cross between an English-style barleywine and a porter but had a lingering hoppy finish. It had a nice mouthfeel ta' boot. Would I have it again? Absolutely!"
"O: Not bad, but I'd probably not track this down. Seems a little one sided with hops, but I think I should have warmed this up a bit before drinking."
"I'm into it but it's a bit too intense to want to drink much of."
"Coats well enough, and the mouthfeel is on point. I enjoyed this beer; not my favorite style but I felt it reached out across several different styles and aims to be a crowd pleaser."
"Pours a clear dark copper color with a 1 inch bone color head that fades to a residue on the top of the beer. Good ring lacing around the glass on the drink down. Smells of grapefruit, caramel, plums. A very good smelling beer. Tastes of sweet caramel malt, grapefruit, brown sugar. Mild hop bitterness on the tongue after each sip. Good carbonation with a medium body. Somewhat creamy. Hop coating is mild in the mouth. I usually don't like amber/red ales but this is super good. Very easy to drink and very tasty."
"Notes: This big red ale doesn't disappoint. There is plenty of hop and malt complexities to satisfy both hop heads and malt lovers."
"Drinkability is very good. I could have easily finished this bomber by itself."
"Enjoyable beer."
"Not surprisingly this remains one of my favorite Lagunitas beers."
"M/D: Medium bodied, leaves my mouth very dry. I expected it to be hoppier, but I like this beer quite a bit. I find that this style can range in the amount of hops used, and this one is on the lower end, but is very nice nonetheless."
"Deservedly one of the top examples in the style. Lagunitas have continued to demonstrate that they represent amazing bang for your buck, and I'd be pleased to buy this one again."
"Surprisingly very smooth with a light creamy taste at the end. Sour notes linger but not to intense as the alcohol tames the IBU's... Excellent in how easy it is to drink. You will never tire out with this one."
"Overall? Pretty much loved it."
"D: Very high for an ""imperial red."" My two glasses from the bomber went down quickly, and I wouldn't be opposed to having another. Great value too- always a plus."
"This bottle is one that I had after the chiefs lost they're playoff game. Poured a nice amber deep red color and had a great thick appearance. The smell is amazing and brings up alot of hops and citrus fruit. Grapefruit and lemon. The mouth is full and a medium thick full and goes down easy for a beer that is over 8% ABV. This is a good bee for a red ale and would recommend this to someone looking for a good ale."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Sam Adams Imperial Series glass. The color is a dark amber red with very little head. It's got a very distinct and hoppy smell to it, warms me up with every sniff. The taste is of caramelized hops and sweet sugar swirling around, it leaves the mouth dry with a bitter aftertaste. The presence of the alcohol reminds you its there after every sip...not a bad thing. Definitely a classy beer, but then Lagunitas never really misses."
"Drinkability: Overall, this isn't a bad beer. While the aromas and flavours seem a little bland, it is still enjoyable."
"D - The hops were a bit much but this made for a fine sipping beer. Definitely not one I could session."
"I found this to to a rich, flavorful and malty brew, also packing a larger then usual hop package. Typical for the Lagunitas offerings, loaded with flavor, malts and crunching hops, well crafted and thoroughly enjoyable stuff. Me like"
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"This certainly lives up to the ""Mondo Large"" on the label. This is a big beer with plenty of taste that should keep you interested throughout a night of drinking."
"Pours a copper-crimson color, easily a 2-finger head, reduces to frothy thin film, very sticky lacing covers ~90% of the glass. Aroma of very earthy pine hops, and such a creamy sweet malt, much like vanilla! Follow-up aromas of pecans, giving this beer a phenomenal malt character. Taste starts off with well-balanced hops that don't overpower, followed by malts that are so wonderfully mixed, I couldn't even begin to explain them, so I leave it to the other generous BAs out there! Sweet malt attacks the palate and makes me beg for more. I could sip this all night. Truly a solid beer from Lagunitas."
"Overall, a great beer. Very drinkable (should probably keep the ABV in mind, though), great aroma, and delicious. A new favorite of mine. I can't wait to get my hands on some more."
"D: While the alcohol is really well hidden, it does catch up to you if you're not careful. It does start to warm aggressively the more you drink."
"D/O- Very drinkable. A delicious brew all around. Bomber proves no match and makes me wish I had another."
"D: Great beer, one of the best i've had from Lagunitas. Would get this one again for sure."
"Great beer!"
"Is this better than Red Rocket?? A giant, gooey hoppy red - so up my street."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with super smooth carbonation, and the flavor clings like crazy to the inside of the mouth. Super sticky and resinous, which is a good thing. This beer is probably a little heavy to be called extremely drinkable, but the flavors and smoothness make it come close."
"Drinkability: hugely drinkable, given the ABV. The flavors are strong and intense, yet this beer manages to not completely overwhelm the palate. If I thought I could survive drinking this as a session beer, I would."
"If I find this again fresh I will drink it again. A nice hoppy red ale."
"Pours a deep and clear amber, with a tan head that sticks to the glass throughout. Slow carb trails. Smell is very sweet & malty, with caramel predominating. Taste is a very decent balance of bitterness and those sweet toffee malts. Bold flavor, but not overbearing. Finishes bitter and wet. Feel is a bit thin, probably because the alcohol presence is a bit pronounced. Other than that, a solid beer that drinks more like an old ale than an amber.."
"This brew pours a deep rich ruby red hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy two finger head and sticky lacing everywhere,the aroma is very sweet with hints of caramel,toffee,sticky date pudding and some medicinal hops,it has a nice sticky above medium bodied mouthfeel which really coats the mouth with tastes of sticky date pudding,toffee,pecan pie and finishes with a bitter medicinal hoppy bitterness which counteracts the sweetness nicely,overall a very nice and complex brew that is very drinkable."
"D: I could drink this all day long. Until I fell off my chair, that is."
"This beer is amazing it could deserve an A+ or 5's for all ratings, because the hard malt burst of red ales tops this brew it does not deserve a 5 for taste, mouthfeel or drinkablilty. Overall this is one of my personal favorite beers, its crispness is remarkable urging you to session it all night, or at least 50 ounces of it."
"Overall, a really nice, flavorful and smooth take on a hopped up amber. I would definitely get this again."
"Glad the brewers decided to make this an annual offering - keep 'em coming."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on November 20, 2010. It emerges as a deep amber-red pour with excellent clarity and a long lasting but thin soapy head. Caramel malts greet the nose followed quickly by molasses, a dark fruitiness, and pine resins. The bold body leads to a sweet red bitterness followed by a fine backdrop of hops."
"Probably my second favorite red thus far. Full of flavor and easy drinking, my only criticism is it's slightly heavy on the roasted flavors but very tasty."
"They should change the name of this beer to Jesus Cream because thats what it feels like is being poured down my gullet as I pull the bottle to my lips. I've only seen it at one place in Detroit so far, so naturally I camp out in a tent in the parking lot weekly awaiting the arrival of the shipments."
"Drinkability 4.0: It is surprisingly drinkable for its ABV 8.3% (as I said, an imperial red), but is held back a little by its extreme nature, whelming malt, slightly imperfect balance, and what I consider insufficient carbonation. But, once again, it is quite quaffable for its ""mondo-ness."""
"Slide down quite easily. Bready taste resonates, making you want to wash it out rather than go for another. ABV will sneak up on you so take it easy."
"D - Very strong flavor and a nice mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit much for some, but I would never believe you if you told me this was 8.56%."
"Good drinkabiity but definitely not my favorite Amber/red ale, but not bad just not amazing."
"Laugunitas Lucky 13 pours a finger of loose foam over a clear dark orange fluid. Carbonation is moderate but steady, the nose orange marmelade and yeast funk. The flavor is sweet and fruity up front, with notes of molasses and a firm slap of medicinal hop off the back for balance. Mouthfeel is not unexpectedly round, given that they got this up to 8.56% ABV. All that alcohol doesn't really make itself felt except as a feeling of well-being, so take care. Aftertaste is grassy, medicinal hops. Just a tad sticky-sweet but not bad."
"Overall: This is a good brew, but not mind blowing. It honestly smells and tastes more like a soft IPA than a hopped-up brown ale, however it is refreshing and the original concept and always low Lagunitas price will bring me back for more."
"Drinkability is good, but the one bomber was the perfect volume. The flavor is pretty potent, warm, and complex, so I wouldn't go all night with this one. But it's a really nice after-dinner beverage. I could see putting back one of these bombers in the winter time after shoveling the snow out of my driveway..."
"D - Very nice balance."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I was worried it would be out of date but it was excellent. One of my new favorites. I'll be picking up more if I see them. Another fine offering from Lagunitas. I would highly recommend this beer."
"Very nice beer, although lacking in some key areas. Well, whatever. I'm happy to drink it. I'm still waiting for an Australian brewery to get this style right."
"22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on July 13th. A little old but hopefully not past its prime. A solid inch of lumpy head formation slowly dissipates. Deep amber color. Reminds me of bourbon. Light carbonation. Good lacing. Very nice smell. Light, fruity hops. I don't know if I would call it fresh but definitely lively. The must have been amazing when it was younger. Rich malt notes of molasses and maple syrup lie just below the hoppyness. Fairly light body but with a robust texture. A smooth sip with an interesting finish. Hoppy enough so that when the malt comes through you get hints of coffee and dark chocolate and not just sweet. It reminds me a little bit of a dubbel in that respect. Very quaffable for such a big beer. I will restate my original sentiment: the must have been amazing fresh! It has been years since I have had this and will try to make it a point to pick one up next year as soon as they hit the shelf."
"Salud!!"
"It's nice to find a good red ale with big hops presence. Most are mainly malt."
"I was pleasantly surprised by the nice balance and flavors in this Red Ale. I've tried several other styles of beer from Lagunitas and have enjoyed them all. No dissapointments."
"Pours a clear amber body with a big and fluffy tan head. Some caramel maltiness in the aroma, but it leans more toward some floral hoppiness. Grapefruits and pine show through as it warms. Medium-bodied. Nice balance taste-wise. Caramel maltiness and a hint of cocoa upfront. Ample hops show through at the end with a solidly bitter finish that features just a touch of warming alcohol. I loved Lagunita's regular red ale, but this will fit the bill nicely..."
"Drinkability - interesting red ale with a big hop presence. A high gravity beer that drinks remarkable well with little to no alcohol presence."
"Pours a clear, red color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops, sweet malt, citrus, alcohol, and yeast. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of coffee, slight roasted malt, alcohol, strong hops, slight yeast, and slight citrus. Overall, good aroma, body, appearance, blend, and complexity."
"Very drinkable especially for the ABV. I probably won;t have this again, but I'm glad I did once. Another solid offering from Lagunitas."
"The hops leave behind a pine sap aftertaste that endures. If you drink anything after this one you'll probably still taste this one."
"D - This stuff is fantastic. I could drink bombers of this all night, except for the fact that I'd regret it in the morning. The flavours are delicious with powerful hops coming through but still offering a balanced offering. Number 13 has never been so lucky! If you can get your hands on this, I'd highly recommend it!"
"D: Very tasty American Amber, even if it is outside the style guidelines... but aren't most West Coast Ambers out there now, anyway?"
"* and at 5$ a bottle, this is a great beer."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderful deep amber color with a thick frothy 2 finger white head from an aggressive pour leaving a puffy cap and thick sticky lacing down the glass. The aroma is a punch in the face. No wimpy stuff here. Strong caramel malts, bolt citrus and spicy hops are present. The taste is just as good. The beginning is full of the sour citrus hops, the middle is full of sweet caramel and brown sugar from malt balance and the finish leaves with a slight bitter but pine needle fresh hop. The medium body and moderate carbonation fit this to a T. Very solid work and worth the strong accolades. Get some!"
"D- I cannot believe this is an almost 9% beer because it is so smooth and easy drink. I usually go to Lagunitas for hoppy beers, but Lucky 13 is a nicely balanced red ale. Yum!"
"Drinkability: Enjoyable beer from Lagunitas. They are really starting to become a favorite of mine, as they have some really solid beers at really good prices. I have another bottle of this and probably will pick up some more."
"D= This beer was very drinkable to me really enjoyed it."
"One of the better Lagunitas, in my opinion."
"D - this is a big beer (Mondo as it were), great variety and balance of malts, sweet, fruity, spicy, and the alcohol is VERY well hidden, another home run for Lagunitas"
"Served on tap, this beer is a hazy amber color, with an abundant white head, which lingers as lacing all over this glass. Smell is hoppy, but does not prepare one for the taste, which is exceptional. The taste is quite hoppy, with a bitterness on the tip of the tongue and a great orange rind citrussy component. The mouthfeel is neither too watery nor too rich-just about right. I wish this wasn't the last beer I had tonight, as it is one I could drink all night."
"I haven't been a big fan of big reds, and I don't have a whole lot to say about this one, except that it's a damn fine brew."
"Drinkability: very drinkable enjoyed it very much just the right balance of bitterness"
"This beer tastes a lot like a high ABV IPA like Dogfish Head 90 minute and I guess that's a compliment."
"D - Nicely drinkable for the ABV. Lagunitas made a great beer out of an unappreciated style, and I applaud their efforts."
"Well hot damn! This red is quite a treat. Color is a gorgeous bright red/amber. The head is moderate to thin, with a solid lacing left behind. Smell and taste have a cherry hint, with a strong supporting cast of bitter hops and malty sweetness. Very well-balanced, with notes of fresh fruit lingering on the lips. I see that it's got a healthy dose of alcohol, but really I wouldn't suspect 8.56. Well-masked in the hops profile. I can't wait to refill the glass with the second half of this big beer."
"Mondo. Check. Large. Redundant, and check. Red. Check. Ale. Check. A malt-a-licious surprise, and there's just enough hops to balance things out without stealing the show--you can't even tell it's 76.92 IBU. Hoist one. Happy 13!"
"amazing price and an ABV that is not too nasty. i love this and will pick up more. lagunitas always nails it for the value."
"I like the idea of just throwing a shitload of hops into every beer, one of the reasons I like this brewer. drinks like a DIPA and a good one at that, pick this one up if you can it's well worth a try"
"Pours a dark orange amber color with a small white head that fell quickly leaving no lacing. Not a big in your face hop aroma that I was expecting. Kinda of sweet smelling, almost candy like with a hint of grapefruit and pine. Meh... Taste is about the same. It's a big beer, but it's ain't Mondo. It's actually very well balanced, but that doesn't mean any flavors really stand out. It's hoppy, but not overly bitter, mostly grapefruit and light citrus, and the sweetness is very bready with touches of caramel. Medium body, average carbonation. Just a ""meh"" beer to me. Tastes llike just about every single other Lagunitas beer. These guys are starting to lose me. Make something different for a change!"
"Another strong offering from LAH-GOO-KNEE-TUSS."
"All in all a solid offering, my only complaint is the ABV, maybe it has to be that high to get the flavor, but I bought a bomber, cracked it, then noticed the ABV. If it was a bit lower it would be more drinkable."
"MF/D: a brief fizzle of carbonation on the tongue that certainly doesn't overwhelm the flavor by any means."
"Drinkability rates very good as well. A nice hoppy ale with good malt character. Found this to be thoroughly enjoyable."
"D - This beer has a nice combination of flavors, the wonderful aroma carries over to the taste an it makes this a great flavorful beer. Seems to go really well with spicy foods. Share this one with someone who appreciates beer as much as you do."
"Full bodied with medium carbonation. Very enjoyable. The alcohol can be felt a little bit toward the end, but for the most part isn't too noticeable. Would have again."
"Overall this is another good beer by lagunitas and it shows me that not all reds are tame. I wouldn't turn this beer down anytime soon."
"D-The carbonation, or lack thereof, is a bit distracting but this is otherwise a really enjoyable bigger beer."
"This is very drinkable for the double style. This is one of the better red ales I've had."
"D: It's a great red! Easy to drink for 8.56% ABV. Impressed. Would definitely have it again."
"d-yummy. nice balanced bigger beer. the price is right too! definitely try it out."
"I could drink this in the Sahara or Antarctica, but probably only 2 or so at a time. It's a tad strong to be sessioning this mutha unless you got your big boy pants on."
"Pours a nice clear reddish copper with a good sized persistent head. Lacing on the surface the whole way down the glass. Great citrusy hops in the nose along with some rich darker fruit notes. Big malt flavor. Toastiness and caramel. Fruit notes again. Citrusy hops are also present but not overwhelming at all. A little boozy in the finish. Well balanced. Nice full bodied mouthfeel. Easily drinkable although a bit heavy. Very good overall."
"Overall I thought this was a great beer, especially for the price. I would have liked a more malty presence but I would definitely have this one again."
"Good. Had it on draft and I prefer the bottle. Doesn't taste as strong as it smells, which I'm like. I was ready for syrup, but the lightness while swallowing makes this one a good beer for quick sipping."
"Deep reddish brown brew is a clear dark cherry red when held to a light. With a moderate pour it generates 1/2"" of light tan foam that settles to a thick foamy layer. Smell is pretty hoppy with a robust and toasty body. Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of moderate but the hops and carbonation cut through easily. Tasty malty hoppy, pretty darn good. Semi-sweet, dark cherry, strong mixed hop, fairly smoky/ earthy, lingering finish of smoke and licorice... a very wide palate, there's a lot to be found in there. A good hoppy and robust red."
"Booze is very well hidden in the bitterness and sweetness. Super hoppy for a red. Beginning of the sip is nice maltiness, followed by floral citrousy hops. Kind of a scorching beer, worth trying but I would make it one of the last beers of the night."
"D: This was an enjoyable beer but didn't blow my mind."
"This brew pours brilliantly clear red-copper with a thick, clingy off-white head. The aroma is moderate-high hops, citrus, piny, and floral -- almost minty, moderate malt aroma, sweet caramel with hints of raisin and roast. The flavor is intensely hoppy -- pine and grapefruit with a firm hop bitterness that slightly puckers the mouth. The hops linger after the swallow, with a bit of alcohol warmth. The malt is masked by the hops -- but still noticeable, chewy caramel and a bit of raisin. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall a very flavorful, bold beer that is very well made and not for the faint of heart!"
"This beer is a pleasure to drink. Another fine offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"A solid ASA/Imperial Red, although not quite as good as I remembered it."
"Poured a clear mahogany amber with a nice two fingered off white creamy head with nice sticky lacing. Aromas of burnt carmel malts and bread. On the palette sweet burnt carmel, citrus, and booze. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The hippies from Petaluma got this one right. Viva la Lagunitas!"
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a rust red with a 2 inch creamy, white head that leaves just a little bit of lacing. The head eventually resides as just a little lily pad in the middle of my glass. I have to give it to Lagunitas. They really know how to pack a ass load of aroma and flavor into a $3.99 bomber. I really wish more breweries would follow their lead. This one is the same. The nose is nothing short of a ass ton of hops and a butt load of malt. Up front is a blast of citrus hops. It almost reminds me of sticking my nose into a bowl of Fruit Loops, if Fruit Loops weren't fake fruit flavored. Right after that is a toffee smack down. Toast, caramel, and over caramelized sugars. Man, this is tasty. With the nose so hop heavy, I'm surprised that its so malt forward. Big caramel and toffee notes. Sweet candied dark fruits, and just a bit of heavily toasted bread. After that is a blast of tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple, and tangerine. But its all complimentary. The mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied and finishes dry. In my mind, Lagunitas is the BEST brewery in the nation. Great beers at great prices."
"Pours a very deep amber color with a nice off-white head. The scent is dark dried fruits with sweet sugars. Taste is exactly how it smells. Great flavor to this. Such sweet, sugary fruitiness. Followed up by some very fresh hoppiness. The mouthfeel is very full-bodied and refreshing. The drinkability is pretty high."
"All in all this is a superbly balanced beer. It's citrus hints and flavours embody what a California beer should."
"Red, large, and mondo, this one surely is. Tasty, and drinkable, but perhaps a bit too boozy to be all that much of a sessioner, though I'm more than tempted right now, with 2 buck Tuesday still in full effect. Good thing my hotel is within stumbling distance."
"Very tasty and easy to drink. Ridiculously easy to drink for the amount of alcohol involved. Not really a red ale outside of color but worth enjoying nonetheless."
"Quite a change of pace for a red. Never though of an imperial red but I'm impressed."
"22oz. bomber served in a Tank 7 tulip. Poured a reddish gold with a finger of off white head. Big malty aroma with some caramel and toffee and of course it couldn't be Lagunitas without some hops!. Medium to full bodied. Rich, malty flavor with a fair amount of hops, but not as much as a lot of their other offerings. A little heavy on the caramelly flavors for my taste. Not bad, but I don't think I would drink it regularly unlike a lot of their other beers."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company--Lucky 13--A Mondo Large Red Ale--EXAYEAYEAYE--2010 22 oz. Bottle. 8.56% ABV. 76.92 IBU's. (3.75 / 5.0) Red Ale--Imperial. Lacy off white head. Clear dark amber red color. Toasted hop pine roasted sweet floral dark fruit ester front. Cloying mildly creamy sweet rich burnt toffee black cherry earthy hop resin rich malty Imperial Red body. Mild hop spice cloying smooth malt end. Built on Lagunitas hop yeast signature base. Every brew over 7% has the same basic profile. Sampled 8/1/2010. 2 @ $5.49 Each."
"Opinion: A very balanced and drinkable red ale. The creamy mouthfeel is superb, and the fruity, caramelized malt flavors play well with the citrus hop character. Finish ends sweet yet slightly salty and dry."
"A hazy reddish brown color pour with a thick , long lasting creamy offwhite head , loads of sticky lacing , medium carbonation . Aroma of citrus and piny hops , with sweet caramel malts . Flavor is of cirtus and spicy hops with a sweet sticky caramel malt backing , nice balance , long hoppy sweet finish . Full body with a sticky creamy mouthfeel , very good and drinkable ."
"What else to say but another kickass beer from Lagunitas? Readily available, affordable, great tasting bombers everytime."
"D - Goes down easy. It's a little differnt than say a Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye or a Green Flash Hop Head Red (which I like about this same as this Lucky 13). All-in-all, a very enjoyable concoction."
"D-drinkability on this one is above par the 8.5abv is well hidden. a very nice west coast take on the Red Ale."
"Drinkability: Wonderfully balanced. The higher alcohol was nicely hidden. Great beer!"
"D - Awesome balance for a high gravity brew makes it very drinkable."
"Overall this a very good red ale at a fantastic price."
"D- bold red we've got here and its works very well. No sign of the abv. If its around on tap snag one."
"D - i'm usually hit or miss with the ""Imperial"" Amber style, this was a huge hit for sure. great to look at, smell, and taste...I will be on the lookout for this for sure. well done."
"Pours a deep, mostly clear, amber with a foamy tan head. Head dissipates quickly leaving some heavy lacing and a nice haze over the top of the beer. Nose is malty with some toffee and a hint of citrusy hops. Taste is more of the same, lots of malty character with some caramel notes and a perfectly assertive hoppiness in the middle before a nice malty finish. Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium bodied with a stickiness to the finish. Drinkability is outstanding. I tend to skip over more reds in generally, not that I dislike them they just don't tend to do much for me. Not the case here. Even at 8.5%, which is hidden well, this is a very tasty, easy drinking brew. Comparatively speaking the price is dirt cheap too which never hurts."
"Drinkability: Solid enough -- plenty of nose and flavor and the bitter hop profile is certainly refreshing enough; ABV feels like a bit much, but if nursed slowly enough, this beer is easy enough to drink."
"D - Great beer, great price, enjoy a few if you can!"
"what is this? an imperial red? a DIPA? a light barleywine? whatever it is, i love it! and probably will be buying more"
"Pretty easy to drink. The abv is almost non existent."
"I usually stay away from reds because most of them are more malty then I usually appreciate, but I think Lagunitas has struck a nice balance here. My only complaint is the aroma or lack thereof. Drinkability is great for a beer of its ABV but I don't think I could session it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and its nice and refreshing."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking when considering the abv, watch out."
"D: Pretty hoppy, almost like a DIPA but maltier. Red ales aren't my favorite, but this one is better than most. Strong flavors of both caramel malt and bitter hops, but very balanced."
"Interesting beer - aroma and flavor are all mixed up with some really malty notes coming through sometimes, and more bitter hoppy elements dominating at other times - I even get a little bit of some mild spiciness from this. Carbonation seems about right and the slightly higher than normal ABV is hidden well. Interesting & tasty brew and something I would drink again."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"This is a big beer in many aspects, but the balance makes it very drinkable"
"Clear brown amber with a rich head that produces plenty of lace. Nearly no visible carbonation. Predominant aroma is citrus-grapefruit with secondary caramel malt notes. Bit of a carbonation bite up front (despite lack of visible carbonation). Drinks like a strong ale: sweet with a bit of alcohol in the middle and end with plenty of hops balancing everything out. Mouthfeel a bit on the thin side for the style."
"D: The brew drinks excellent at just over 8%ABV. Well balanced, well crafted, and a pleasure to enjoy."
"Poured a muddy reddish copper into a Duvel tulip with around a finger of quick-receding head. Citrus aroma with a touch of honey/caramel. Moderately high carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Alcohol warmth at first followed by flavors of grapefruit, a touch of malty caramel, and pine-like bitterness on the finish. Nice balance overall, highly drinkable (flavor from the higher ABV quickly recedes into the background)."
"Drinkability -- Hopped up, but well balanced. Nothing seems too far out of proportion. Excellent hoppy red, glad I got mine."
"drinkability: Pretty darm smooth for a >8%'er."
"drinkability is an issue here because of a combination of the beer being thick and a lot more biting bittering flavor from the hops than i like."
"The taste is the smell with a creamy thickness to it. Very nice hop character with a little bit of alcohol heat as the beer warms. This is a hefty red and should be treated as such, very delicious though."
"This is a delicious and near perfect strong red ale. I hope to be able to get more."
"Chill hazed amber with a fluffy off-white head. Thick froth with tiny bubbles in the middle. Aroma of perfumy citrus, gingerbread, toffee. Classic Lagunitas sweet and hoppy up front. Toffee and molasses meets bitter navel orange. Great looking lacing in the Duvel stem. Sticky citrus hops with some pine in there. Quite a nice hop profile. Sweet mouthfeel with a toffee-citric glaze on the finish. Alcohol nicely hidden and very drinkable."
"D: Very drinkable despite the ABV. Complex in a sometimes ordinary category."
"D: Something to drink slow and enjoy. Flavors develop and come out as it warms up. I like it and since I have fresh bottles at my store I'll get some more."
"D: One of the best things I had at the brewery. Very drinkable, and I am not a big fan of Amber Ales."
"A very good brew that might be a bit too sweet for a session beer for me, but it leaves a nice malty hoppy taste lingering. This beer leans more towards and IPA than a red ale, but it was very enjoyable none the less. My only knock is that it was a tad bit too sweet, but besides that it was very good and another solid Lagunitas product."
"d - A nice amber ale that has some nice citru hops to it. Would try again."
"I'm not an expert on this style of beer, but I don't see the huge difference between this and a strong IPA or a regular DIPA. None the less, this is a great beer."
"Totally somewhere in between an amber and an IPA. Not my favorite, but still nice and quite tasty."
"You definitely know you're drinking something, but the alcohol is pretty well hidden for 8.5%."
"Another new addition to Vegas and surprised at the low cost. Poured into tulip (why not be fancy?). Pours a very nice cherry wood color with good head and retention, great lacing. Smell is of citrusy hops, some sweet malt but mainly the hops. I swear this is almost Pliney like! Taste is good, a little sweet but not too much. Very smooth and sweet initial taste with a bitter, citric hop taste on the back of the tongue. Another beer geek told me this had a ""cherry"" taste to it and i didnt see that at all, the standard grapefruit and citrus taste as many west coast beer. How this beer is an amber confuses me, I pretty much got IPA all the way. Mouthfeel was fine, not too full at all and a nice oily aftertaste. Overall a really good beer, especially for the $3.99 pricetag that was on the bomber."
"Pours a clear reddish-amber color with about a half-inch of light khaki colored head that had OK retention and lacing. The aroma was malty upfront and hoppy at the back. The flavor was a bit malty sweet with a sharp hop finish. The body was decent and drinkability was good. Overall, a very nice little beer. Nothing great, but enjoyable. Worth trying."
"Another well done hoppy red ale from Cali. No more, no less. A bit sweet for me to make it a regular, but I did enjoy it."
"Beer falls a little flat on flavor unfortunately. I guess the aroma propped me up to expect a big bitter finish and its just not there. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkability is high. Mostly malt in the front on the mouth and a gradual diminuendo of flavor until the flat finish."
"Pours a pretty amber color with some eggshell white head that leaves a little bit of lacing. Decently large hop aromas on this one, a bit of sticky caramel and sweetness too. Taste follows, like a red barleywine or something. Pretty interesting, a bit of resinous hops, some sweet malt in there, a bit of spiciness to it too. A nice big ale from Lagunitas here, nothing too incredible, but a decent, affordable ale nonetheless. Very smooth, medium to light body on this one. A bit prickly on the hind end. Very drinkable, especially considering the ABV. Nice one, I would buy it again."
"I think the blending in the flavor and the balance in the mouthfeel make this brew extremely drinkable and therefore, a dangerous one at 8.3%. In my opinion not the best I have had of this style (the ipa/amber blend), but probably the most equal balance I have found which is pretty cool."
"Darn good drinking."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a room temperature glass mug. The beer has a very pretty orange/amber color. It's crystal clear and has a bit of carbonation rising within. There is a thick head of tan foam. As it settles, patchy lacework is left behind. This beer looks like how I want a mug of beer served to me. As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell caramel malts. Now that the beer is in the glass and I can get a better handle on the aroma, I can smell caramel and toffee malts, oak and a bourbon-like alcohol. It smells strong and pleasing. The taste is equally impressive. Crispy, toasted malts are readily apparent and give the beer a a slightly sweet taste, reminiscent of brown sugar. Caramel flavors are present in the finish. The aftertaste has some oakiness. The entire taste has an underlying bitter presence. The beer is full bodied and leaves a lot of coating, but isn't too sticky or sweet. It is highly carbonated. For all of the big aspects of this beer (it is an Imperial Red, after all), it is very drinkable. I'll easily make my way through these 22 ounces this afternoon. I find myself wishing I had more than this one bottle. I also wish I had consumed this beer sooner. I've had this bottle for a few months, and I think the hop presence has suffered. I'll have to seek out a source of fresh bottles."
"Drinkability: Good. Went down nice and I could easily enjoy another bomber. Would/will drink again and recommend."
"D: Very drinkable. Lagunitas sure does it right when it comes to hops."
"Medium bodied with a decent roasted malt profile balanced by some dark fruit notes and a nice earthy pine hop bitterness. The hop profile is more prominent than the aroma lead on thankfully. Hints of cherry, slight chocolate and other dark fruit. Nicely balanced but the malt profile was a bit too strong and the hops were as prominent as I prefer."
"Very impressive and interesting flavor in this beer. I'd believe it if I was told that this beer was oak-aged from that awesome vanilla note, but I know that it wasn't. Apparently this was an anniversary beer that Lagunitas decided to make a seasonal offering. Good decision."
"Another excellent Lagunitas...not what I expected, but in a good way! A thin pour to coppery opaque honey brown with a full finger of off-white head & some decent lace. Aromas of malty vanilla, almost a Goetze cow-tail candy, but rounded by some hints of pepper & hops. The mouthfeel is creamy but not too heavy, with good roasted caramel malt and a bit of hop that leaves a strawberry aftertaste. Quite nice & unexpected. A bit sweet, but not too tacky; a bomber is sufficient although some might go for more."
"d- this has decent drinkability, i don't think that i expected this beer to taste this way, i think i was expecting more of a nugget nectar profile, so i was bound to be a bit disappointed because of that fact."
"D= if you like a good amber with plenty of gusto yet a dry finish, you'll love this. Probably would go well with a good filet mignon rolled and grilled with roasted garlic, or even a decent chocolate dessert."
"Very easy beer to drink. Great for the spring season. I will be buying this one much more."
"Taste of malt first, pine, grapefruit, brown sugar, eerily reminiscent of a smaller version of 'brown shugga' but very tasty, not quite as much caramelized sugar flavors. Good carbonation medium mouthfeel and a pretty nice finishing flavor of caramel malt and some sugars. Plenty sweet and tasty. I would get a couple of these at the reasonable price point."
"Verdict: Rather close to their Imperial Red Ale, Lucky 13 is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Lagunitas big Red Ale."
"A nice amber ale, I would buy it again."
"Bottle via bobsy. Absolutely beautiful slightly hazy reddish-brown pour with a foamy, persistent white head. Lots of cascade hops, piney, grapefruit, and a lot of grass. Taste is is very well balanced between the hops and the caramel malt sweetness. This tastes like liquid grass. Very smooth palate. Very solid beer. Thanks again, I didn't expected it to be that good."
"Pours a clear amber with 2 fingers of yellowishly stained head. Tons of sticky lace cling all about the glass. Nose is quite citrusy and floral from the hops with a little bit of malt sweetness in there as well. Taste is a nice mixture of malt sweetness similar to caramel and a moderate amount of hop bitterness coupled with a warming alcohol driven finish. Medium feel with light carbination. Very drinkable. As it warms the alcohol becomes very pronounced for 8% and the hops start to taste and smell more grassy and piney. Very nice red ale."
"A warm amber color with a small off-white head. Not much retention and minimal lacing. The aroma is a blend of caramel malts and citrus hop notes. Pleasant but not overly powerful. Those aromas are present in the flavor with a nice brown sugar/toffee/caramel malt flavor blended with a bright citrus grapefruit/orange flavor. Sort of reminds me of a toned down version of brown sugar. Medium-bodied and low on the carbonation. Also, a bit cloying on the finish, maybe could have used a little more hop to balance out. At any rate, it's a decent beer that may be worth a try if you enjoy Lagunitas' other offerings. I'd probably recommend the Imperial Red or Brown Shugga over this one though."
"D: Very high. Well balanced, really enjoyable. Lagunitas makes so many great, extremely drinkable beers!!!"
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was amber colored with a amber head and decent lacing. The beer was hoppy smelling and really hoppy tasting . Too much hops. I thought it was an IPA. If you like a hop bomb go for it. I will not buy again."
"One of the most drinkable 8% abv beers out there."
"Really enjoyed the taste of this beer. Has just enough hoppiness backed by a smooth caramel malt to make it very drinkable for an 8% beer."
"The pour is a medium amber and rich copper color with a great strong head that leaves a bit of spier silk lacing. The aroma is hot, hoppy and sweet. Plenty of orangey citrus hops with the abv. adding some spice to the hop nose. The caramel and crystal malts lend a sweet bread smell to the mix. The taste starts super orange and cane suagr. Then toasted malt and some warm, bitter orange zest snaps the middle of your palate and slowly recedes all the way to the finish. This beers palate is bitter at first, then add som alcoholic heat to that bitterness, and you'll have the finish. Pretty good and pretty heated red ale."
"Overall, a very well-done beer by Lagunitas."
"This is a superb beer from a brewery that produces some of my favorites. Strong enough to have some backbone, but not so strong that you can enjoy a bit of this without getting knocked about. Lagunitas is one left coast brewery that is not afraid to let the malts shine and not blow it all to hell with over the top hopping. Bravo, this hits the ball out of the park."
"Taste is the best thing about this beer. Recommend getting it as fresh as possible, one of those highly hopped beers that doesn't age the greatest. Has the irish red thing underneath all the hops and bitterness. Hides the alcohol well. Lingers nicely. Could drink a few of these."
"D- This is a drinkable beer and a nice surprise from what I am use to which is hops hops and mor hops. Would drink this again in a heartbeat. Plus I really like the artwork on the label."
"Great red color, very good hop aroma and bitterness. I'll get this again whenever I see it on draft. Great for any season."
"Notes: Most notable cask experience I´ve ever had. I had a few, maybe not too many cask servings over the years, but I typically prefer them seeking their complexity and uniqueness. This one made the top of experiences: what a brew revealing its potential as a live ale."
"Overall: Lots, nay tons, of tiny bubbles rising rapidly. This, however, does not make the beer too fizzy like many I've had lately. Mouth is substantial and appropriate and probably due to the obvious alcohol. I'd say this malt verges on Scotch ale."
"Poured a dark orangish brown color with good carbonation and a big dirty white head. Nose is warm with citrus, pine, bread and malt. Taste is a thick malt flavor and pretty hoppy. Mouthfeel is bready, warm with hops and drinkability is good but this is the strongest amber/red I have ever had, that I recall."
"Even with the ABV, this is very drinkable. Sweet and refreshing. I would have this again."
"Overall a very, very solid example of the style and a favorite of mine I think going forward. I would have no issue at all trying this one when I see it in the local store."
"Not bad of a beer, a little bit of a bite to it, nice soup beer or a good winter beer, like the flavor can see myself eating a good cheese product with this such as raclette not bad or a good beer cheese fondue, like my BDAY this LAST WEEK you know. will have again"
"definitely keep strong on this for a good time.. delicious."
"I believe it to be one of the better Amber ales I've had. Very drinkable beer with great taste. Will look for this beer again."
"Poured a medium, reddish brown with a moderate head that reduced to a collar. The aroma was malty. The taste was a good balance of citrus hops and malty sweet. There was no bitterness in the aftertaste. The feel was medium bodied with adequate carbonation. Drinkability was reasonably good. Lucky 13 may be a red ale but it drinks more like an APA."
"Ruby/copper color. Cream colored head was less than a finger from a pretty lazy pour. Sweet malty notes are prominent in the nose along with a floral hops. Not bursting with the piney hops of other Lagunitas brews I've sampled. Sweet caramel malts up front with a nice influx of hoppy bitterness at the end...left a hint of grapefruit moments after swallowing. Didn't reallyget a sense of the alcohol till that warming feeling hit my belly. I was unimpressed upon my first drink, but it really grew on me as I drank. Nice balance, just a hair on the sweet side. It is, however, very good for a red ale."
"This is a solid complex beer."
"Very balanced and quite drinkable. Too bad it's an anniversary release and not on their full-time brewing schedule."
"taste is smooth and creamy with a little kick, malt, grass, hops, and a nice earthiness, end is thick, dry, and bitter."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a murky reddish/copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is pine hops, caramel malt, brown sugar and some bread. Taste is similar to the aroma, there's pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops along with some caramel malt. Good balance between the hops and malt. There's also a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and slick, and is well carbonated. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. Overall I think this is a good brew, I enjoyed it."
"22 ounce bomber poured into a Unibroue tulip. The aroma seems to be fresh citrusy hops mixed with sweet caramel malt and the taste follows suit. ABV is masterfully hidden by the beautiful blend of sweet and bitter tastes. Almost reminds me of an aged double IPA. Probably a bit out of style but who cares...I suppose we have to fit all beers into a category but Lagunitas seems to always push the envelope of style...with some flair for the dramatic. Yet another awesome beer from Lagunitas in an expanding collection of amazing shit."
"Drinkability: The beer I'd describe as the closest to this is Arrogant Bastard, which has got to be one of my all-time favorite beers. This is higher in alcohol and may be even smoother than the Bastard, although it's not quite as well-balanced. Highly recommended."
"D- This was a very enjoyable beer. Certainly one of the best i've had from lagunitas. If you're expecting a red ale, you might be disappointed but it is a damn good beer."
"Nice great head very hoppy smell to it right away. The great big hop taste comes jolting out. A great big gulp from my mug and instant heaven sweet caramel flavors with a nice bitter and god is it ever smooth. Its definitely a drinkable beer and I would say that this won't be the only time that I will be picking up this beer. its a house favorite."
"One finger of head sits atop a deep copper/brown body. Good lacing left on the glass. Smell is caramel malts, apple skin, wax, and pine cone. The taste is very sharp and refreshing, the malt really jumps out at first but a big wave of pine hop bitterness is lurking underneath. Haven't really had many beers of this style that I enjoyed, but this one is pretty damn good. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I normally prefer, but this is a solid beer overall and one worth purchasing, but not necessarily seeking out."
"D- Great beer. This beer really deserves and Imperial Red category, for it is far out of the league of Bud American Ale. Hoppy, fragrant, fairly well balanced and sticks with you. I quite enjoy this beer."
"This is an excellent value for what is really a DIPA or imperial red. Lucky 13 is readily available to me at $3.99 a bomber. I hope to enjoy this again."
"Big red with that come to be expected Lagunitas hop bite. Glad to try it on the last day of summer first day of fall 2009."
"I like it, sweet yet hoppy."
"A very enjoyable red ale. Starts off with some nice malt sweetness. Ends with just a touch of bitterness. Lots of caramel, with notes of honey. Nice bit of citrus hops, that you can typically find in other Lagunitas beers. A small dose of pine. A very drinkable and stronger red ale."
"Well, heck. I haven't been all that impressed with the brewery before now. But this one... This one I like. A lot. Wish it were less expensive!"
"D. A tasty and potent red ale that hides its alcohol well. One of my favorite Lagunitas."
"The medium body became more and more smooth as the contents of my glass diminished."
"Very nicely done and highly drinkable. Lagunitas is brewing some excellent ales at more than reasonable prices. I paid less than five dollars for this bomber. Kudos!"
"d- deadly drinkable. one endeavoring to see me sober at the end of the night would do well to keep this bad boy away from me."
"Drinkability is good. Slightly sweet and sticky which makes the ABV moderately present."
"D - Very drinkable. Fine balance between robust hops, mild bitterness, malts & alcohol potency."
"Overall: Great balance. Kind of similar to Lagunitas' other big beers out there, but probably my favorite so far. Usually don't like imperial red ales d/t overhopping but this one seems to do it right. Very drinkable, especially when considering the high abv. Would choose this any day over Winter yulesmith or shark attack red by port brewing."
"Well balanced, good mouthfeel, neither too thick or too thin. I had these hours and beers apart .neither time did I want another one right after. A lot there for me."
"This beer is very drinkable. I am fairly sad that I only have one bottle. It is refreshing goes down smooth."
"Found on tap at Moe's in Lee, MA this shows a deep copper color with a good off-white head and very nice lacing. The aroma brings a tasteful but mild grapefruit hop that leaves me unsure of exactly what it packs. However, the first taste declares a sharp pine hop with a heavy caramel overtone that settles sweetly on the tongue. Mid-bodied for a nice feel with subtle carbonation, quite drinkable if you're a hophead, otherwise, not. This almost settles into a rhubarb tartness with a wheat grain mellow base. Very good stuff but Lagunitas rarely disappoints."
"cheers!!!"
"D: Very drinkable. If you aren't a fan of hops don't drink this one. That way there is more for me!! Lagunitas makes good quality beer and they hit the mark on this one."
"Quite good, worth trying."
"This is my first tasting of an American Amber/Red Ale an am hoping to find Nugget Nectar to compare."
"Drinkability: A very nice example of the style; gets a bit sweet at times for my palate, but I enjoy the bitter aspects well enough"
"D: I really enjoyed this brew. Overall, flavor was exceptional. Will attempt to purchase more while it is available."
"D: For what this is--a big red beer--this is a drinkable beer; of course, one must be aware that this beer packs quite the bite."
"D= best red ale I've had? Possibly. Really a great beer here. Something special."
"I might need to start buying this more often. This is hitting a special spot."
"Taste is initially full of the aroma characters, plenty of big malt flavor and caramel sweetness. This however gives way, a little to my surprise, to very nice hoppy, citrusy finish. The hops really do a great job of balancing things out, much more than I expected."
"D: By the time I finished, I enjoyed it much more than when I started. And I definitely wanted another. Mmm."
"Copper colored brew, one finger off-white head, good lacing. Hops predominate a bit in the nose, but bready malts with a bit of lingering caramel are noted. Spicy hops on the tastebuds, a bit of grapefruit, but a hot alcohol finish makes this a less than fully drinkable brew. Busy mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. Not as heavy as Stone 13th Anniversary, which is the best comparator I can see in this tricky Imperial Red category."
"This is a big malt, amber, and balanced by piney hops. A lot of taste here. A little bit more sweet then I would like, almost too much for a bomber on a warm summers night, especially if you let it sit and warm up a bit. I would say this is a nice big west coast red beer for a crisp night."
"This is a bold red ale that was heavy on the hops and was more carbonated that I'd normally like. The strength makes it ideal for putting just a bit cooking (I put it into my burgers and was amazed). Don't expect to drink this one all night, but it is a great way to start a BBQ"
"Deep malts initiate on the flavor, a bit of robust carbonation confuses in the middle and a nice hop bitterness concludes. Notably better as the carbonation settles for a bit and the beer warms from fridge temp. Feel and Drink are good and also improve with some warming. Finishes with some spice and warmth and offers a nice hop texture. Nose remains a bit nondescript. Odd carbonation issues as the beer pours somewhat flat yet was fizzy on the tongue for the first ten minutes. Overall a rich and robust Amber, big but not Yulesmith Winter in complexity."
"drinkability - while i split this bomber i would not want to drink more then one it was just too sweet"
"cheers"
"D) Well crafted. Tastes more like a double IPA than an amber / red."
"Probably one of the best Lagunitas beers I have ever had. Probably one of the best Amber Ales I have had as well. Nice strong and complex flavor that has perfect balance. Great beer and I hope this one stays in Lagunitas' regular rotation."
"D: Another big, tasty ale from Lagunitas. A lot to like here, especially for the $4 price tag. It's hefty, and you'll start to feel it halfway through the bomber, but it's nice to find something that can jostle you around a little and still leave a good impression."
"Poured a clear red/brown body with a two-finger light tan head with patches on the glass. Caramelized and toasted malts, along with a little bread, mix with a strong dose of herbal/spring hops. Hops are more pronounced than usual so they are even with the malts. A thin-to-medium body with some sweetness from caramel malt along with a drying sensation that comes from some biscuit malt/grainy hops. Also some hop bitterness that leads to the dry backbite despite the malts giving this beer a little stickiness. With the beer's malt/hop balance between sweet and piney dryness this is a very good beer, but if I want a red I am looking for a tad less hops. Still, I recommend this as a must-try for anyone."
"D - I don't necessarily want to finish it the more I drink it but it's definitely not close to a drain-pour. It's good all around but a bit off-putting on the finish."
"Recommended. Great with a mildly spiced ribeye and blue cheese iceberg wedge."
"One of Lagunitas' better offerings."
"This is a big flavor beer that pairs very well with big flavored foods. It went great with a big grilled burger with the works and a Sicilian pasta salad. Overall, lots of flavor that begs to be paired with dead, red meat. Yummy!"
"Fantastic beer on par with Hop Stoopid."
"Dam has to be the tastiest amber I've had to date."
"Served cold it's a big slam of Amarillo hoppy goodness. There is some malt to go along with it, but it's mostly a hop bomb. Let it warm up and it's almost a different beer. The malt sends the hops to the back seat and takes over. All said it's a fantastic beer. I could stick with it all night. My only complaint is the color... Fora self proclaimed ""mondo red ale"" it's pretty copper almost brunette color."
"D: I can say i've never had a beer quite like this and I'm glad that I have had the experience. I don't know if I'd drink a lot of this beer as the winter warmer sort of spices get a bit much for me but combined with this new style they are quite good. in fact, i hope they make this in december. get a bottle and enjoy."
"Final thoughts: Lots more biscuit the more I drink, a little too sweet but a nice heavy red ale, closer to a non-sour/tangy/fruity barleywine or heavy old ale, a great change for Lagunitas from the usual hop bomb"
"Mouthfeel is nice and smooth and not too fizzy. Drinks well too and and a very nice experience for less thatn $4 a bottle it's a great offering!"
"Again, I'm a fan of a Lagunitas brew. I really liked this stuff. The only problem is, I liked Hop Stoopid twice as much, it's available year round, and it's cheaper (at most places). So it looks like this wont become a regular in the fridge, but this 22 oz bomber was definitely a treat."
"I paid five bucks for the bomber which I think is a great deal. I'll be back for more and recommend others give this a try as well."
"A hop bomb of an Imperial Red. For the first time since I've been reviewing, I couldn't even remember if I had reviewed (or even tried, to be honest) Lagunitas' normal Imperial Red Ale. It turns out that 10 months ago I really liked it. And 10 months later, I really like this one, too. It's a very hoppy Red. There's good malt character (fruity and sweet) lurking beneath the waves of hop resins, but it's not the star of the show. The hops come through with a big piney bitterness that is mostly rounded out by the malt caramel. It's like biting a pine needle candy bar. There's also some grapefruit rind and maybe even tangerine rind, connoisseur to connoisseur. Anyway, it's a very nice beer if you like hoppy West coast style DIPAs or assertive hop charaters, generally."
"D - abv. is well hidden and only becomes remotely appearant as the beer nears room temp. great overall flavor...hell, exceptional overall flavor. I finished the bomber and i want more. I wish Lagunitas would make this into a year 'round, cause this is easily thier best yet IMHO!"
"D: Very easy drinking for such a hoppy and boozy ale."
"This is a great red ale. Great hops, nice malt balance. Dare I say its better that Stones 13th? It just might be. It really is a big red and the hops are just sublime. I will be buying more of this. Another hit from Lagunitas."
"D: Honestly, this is a pretty good beer. I found it much better as it warmed, and its BA recommended temperature of 45-50 F is a bit low. The mouthfeel could use some work to bring out the complexity of its flavor, but this is something I'll be picking up again to see if/how it changes. I love the price, too (under $5)."
"Good on the front end, lacking on the back."
"Notes: This is definitely a hop-forward Imperial Red, but manages to maintain somewhat of an equilibrium from the hefty malt bill. Full-flavored, bold, hopped-up, and delicious. This one is a real winner! Recommended"
"D: Very drinkable beer, quite tasty and a good way to end the night."
"Lucky 13 pours a deep clear red with an off white head that leaves good lacing down my tulip. Aromas are grapefruit, caramel, slight alcohol presence. It looks beautiful and smells that way too. Plenty of caramel malt and grapefruit in the nose. Not heavy in the body, but plenty there. Highly drinkable with enough carbonation to keep it from being thick. I wish this was lower abv, but the alcohol is pretty well hidden for over 8%."
"D: This is a wonderfully drinking beer, but the ABV is a little high if you want to drive home after one. Get a DD."
"Drinkability, ala every other Lagunitas offering I've tried, is marvelous. Refreshing, crisp, and tasty, it is the stuff of warm nights and good music."
"drinkability: overall a great beer and nice anniversay selection."
"Pretty large khaki colored head rides a deep amber to brown colored body. Slightly hazy and good lace. Big malt nose with a bunch of bitter hops mixed in. Lots of piney hops dominate the flavor, sweet red malts in the front. A bit of spicy alcohol as it warms. Medium sized mouth, pretty wet. Pretty solid overall"
"Pours a clear copper color with a large off-white head that has good retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Mostly hops in the aroma. Pine mostly but a touch of citrus as well. The flavor is dominated by the hops with the malt notably abcent. Pine resin hop flavor at first with a citrus finish. I really miss the malt I like in red ales. Bitterness is high. Medium body but it is a touch overcarbonated. Otherwise has a nice body. I like hopped up red ales and I enjoyed this one. Could of been better with some malt flavor. The high ABV and high bitterness limits drinkability."
"Feels smooth and creamy and is a very drinkable beer in the right circumstance."
"Just arrived today. The beer pours a mahogany with a thin off-white head, with a fine carbonation and nice lacing on the glass. Aroma isn't very strong, but resinous, piney hops are abundant. Sipping this beer is a real treat. Toasty malt is apparent, followed with a strong hop profile. Pineapple, grapefruit, and cedar dominate. The mouthfeel is good. Medium to full-bodied, the flavors last for a long time. Even with it's color, I wouldn't consider this a red. Unless one wants to name a new style category known as west coast reds. I'll be buying this one again."
"Other comments: I really like Lagunitas IPA and Hop Stoopid is pretty good, but the others I've tried are a bit off the mark for me. Not sure what exactly I don't like. They're too rich or something. And there's something odd in the background flavor."
"pours a chestnut amber color with a fresh fluffy head that dissipates slowly to a beige ring til the end....the smell is oily hops fruits and nutty malty smell..smells good to me..the taste is hops and pine first with some fruit and bready sweet caramel malts.hops are defiantly in charge for sure in this.. i will call it an imperial amber..overall this is yet another solid offering lagunitas who keeps putting out winner after winner..i find this enjoyable and very smooth and scary drinkable 1 bomber @ 8.3 will be felt..defiantly recommended"
"Pours a clear amber color with a finger or so of creamy off-white head that very slowly dissolves and never completely disappears. The aroma has some serious resinous piney hops along with some aromas that are reminiscent of barley (i.e. brown sugar, dried fruits) and some toasted malts. The flavor is sweet, sticky hops upfront with some dried fruits and toasted malts and a soft bitterness to round things off. This is a full to medium bodied beer and is very sticky but at the same time has ample carbonation. Very interesting, seems like a super hoppy barleywine overall. It does get much hotter as it warms up which makes it a sipper."
"- Super smooth and drinkable... and not too str4ong in the alc. taste dept. Bit over carbonated for my taste... but most Reds/Ambers are... Overall a very good offering from Lagunitas."
"This is ridiculous good. If your a fan of IPAs and a fan of Red Ales, this is your beer. They should create a new category for this beer and Big Hoppy Monster."
"Only the slightest bit of warmth as its warmed. This beer is fantastic! A must have for any hop lover."
"D: lagunitas has struck another winner with this Red Ale. Nice flavors and a bit of class"
"Drinkability - Absolutely a must for any lover of the style. Delicious to the last drop."
"The appearence is a hazy amber color with a light chunky off white head that recedes down nicely. THe smell is sweet malt and citrus hops. A light breadiness as well. THe taste is big malts, very sweet and caramel. I don't taste as much hops as i thought i would but its enough. There is slight bitterness at the end. Maybe a little piney taste too. Mouthfeel is nice a medium. Low carbonation and kind of a thick and slick feel down the throat. Overall pretty good beer. The hops may have died slightly on this one but its pretty good overall."
"Given the high ABV this is surprisingly drinkable. Glad to have tried this."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my trusty nonic pint glass. Appears a hazed crimson copper color with an inch of fluffy off white foam. Smells and tastes of a healthy dose of sweet caramelized malt and toasted grains, resinous, piney hops, maybe a bit of tangerine and grapefruit as it warms. Alcohol is in hiding and this red ale is adequately carbonated for it's style with a satisfying body. Good stuff."
" Good drink, bravo Louisiana beer."
"D- Overall very high, alcohol is well balanced with the complex taste."
"D - I enjoyed this one quite a bit I have a thing for hopped up ambers and this one meets my craving a very good beer thats worth getting to try"
" Overall a memorable strong ale. Cool label art too."
"D: Fairly easy drinking, but it just doesn't do too much for me on the flavor end. Although I enjoyed the sweet maltiness, I was hoping for a bit more bitterness. I'm still searching for that Amber/ Red Ale that can hang with Troegs Nugget Nectar."
"D - goes down well, a pretty nice all around beer."
"Compared to something similar, Oscar Blues Gordon's Ale, which I recently compared to this, this is darker, with a richer, more complex and less grapferuity character in smell and taste and a richer, frothier feel."
"Poured from bottle into imperial pint glass nice dark brown with thick tight head - excellent lacing all the way through. Smells great - malt pine citrus. Tastes some malt upfront citrus hops and alcohol - lots of alcohol, it kind of overwhelms much of the upfront flavor. Mouthfeel syrupy with some carb. Drinkability - at 8.3 abv - this is not a session beer - way too heavy. 12oz would do me fine."
"slight greasy feel with awesome carbonation. slightly chewey...lol but very nice sparkling feeling and refreshing. alcohol low enuff to drink fairly well as a session beverage. as long as you dont slam em down lol."
"Pours a very red colored body, clearish looking, with a small tannish colored head. Has a grapefruity, nutty aroma. A very grapefruity malty taste. Somewhat balanced, between bitterness and the sweetness. A little too piney."
"Overall a solid brew by Lagunitas but not a standout. Still I would be glad to drink one any time. Good beer."
"Thick bumpy pillow floats atop a non parting red sea. The scent is intense. Toffee covered cherries smoking over maple wood, boiling in molasses and brown sugar. A heavy malt foundation reminiscent of a DIPA with the hops turned dessert, cinnamon swirl bread, spicy caramel, maple syrup, and red cake. The hops provide a healthy bitter to disguise the power punching ABV, which is no where to found. Thick, sappy, spicy and littered in saw dust; another check into the IMP RED column."
"Pours a translucent red with 2-3 finger head that leaves lacing. Gorgeous looks! Smells of spices, bread, sugar, malt which is very inviting. The taste gives you exactly the scent: a flavor pyramid with thick, fat malt supporting the top half of brown sugar, cinnamon-ginger bread, spice and everything nice. Medium-heavy in body with a thick malty mouthfeel and cinnamon aftertaste. A great brew with dessert-like qualities as well as session beer characteristics."
"D - Very drinkable, although I would rather have a port shark attack."
"D- Damn tasty and an exemplary example of the style. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. This is a good beer to sit back and take 'er easy with."
"Good balance to this beer. Has a shitload of very clean malty sweetness and alot of citrusy hop flavor. As this is one of my last couple bottles and has aged about 5 months, it has lost some of the bright hop bitterness...which blows, but it is still drinking phenomenally. Fruity aspect is nice - green apples, strawberries and grapefruit. ABV is so well hidden that it almost seems sessionable. I would absolutely love to see this beer re-released at some point. Wonderful job Lagunitas!"
"Even free, I'd be hesitant."
"Opinion: I am actually pretty happy with this beer. I am normally not a huge fan of the red ales (though this was the first style I ever brewed). This one has enough of a malty backbone, and hop presence to satisfy just about any palate. I don't know how much I will be seeking out this beer in the future, but I am glad that I tried it. If I saw it on tap, I would probably give it another shot."
"Good whipped up quality to the head, contributes to strong lacing, head does subside swiftly despite active beads below. Red to brown brick in hue, tinge of yellow around the rims. Sweetly roasted malts dominate the nose, caramel and milk chocolate stick out clearly, good florality, rounds out with plum, raisin notes, minimal hop presence, maybe tangerine juice, sufficiently dense to persist texturally. Full-bodied, decidedly sweet, plays long on caramel, butterscotch, milk chocolate creme fraiche and toffee components. The large-scale carbonation opens up spaces for the more bitter, drying hops to alter the mouth texture. That said, never ""dry"" in nature, adds in oatmeal, honey and rice elements. Raisin, fig, plum, cherry fruit. Remains broad and full through the finish. May be too sweet for many palates for this category of beer."
"Juicy Fruit and grapefruit hops with a cherry caramel malt backbone. Very sweet and fruity. Mouthfeel is creamy and euphoric. Some alcoholic warming in the aftertaste. Very similiar to a strong altbier."
"shared this one, thanks donkeyrunner!"
"$4.99 for a 220z bottle. OG=1.085, 76.92 IBU, 8.3% ABV. Pours out to a cloudy near brown with auburn accents, forming a modest yellow head with good retention and solid lacing. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The aroma is sweet, malty, and toasty, with a faint sweet hope sheen. Mouthfeel is slick with a dense body. The taste begins large with big raisiny dark fruits and malts, followed by some sweet green hops in the middle, which has some mild bitterness in the finish and tobacco in the aftertaste. Lots of big dark fruits throughout. Touch of peppery alcohol in the finish as well. Lots of hops, yes, but well-balanced considering the malt bill. Nice."
"Picked up a bomber at the nearby TW. Bottle smell is hoppy and malty, red licorice. Pours to a light amber colour with a light tan, foamy medium bubble head. Taste is hopped to the max, a little sweet at the start with a good bit of bitterness Then the bitters hit the back of the tongue and kick in. The sweetness, however sticks on the roof of the mouth as the bitters finish boldly. The high AC is only evident a little bit in the middle. A great ale for hop lovers. The AC is a tad bit up (which I'm sure contributes to smooth mouthfeel and taste) so in my book the drinkability can't be 5.0. However,as a brewery, Lagunitas never disappoints. A delicious brew."
"D - This is one of the better amber ales I've had and one of the better brews I've had from Lagunitas."
"Medium sized peachy color head. Moderate carbonation. Clear auburn color. Smells of sweet peach jolly ranchers and patchouli (in a good way). Medium body. Noticeable hop presence upfront, but malt prevails. Raisins and cinnamon also present with a fruity alcohol finish."
"This is a great strong red ale with high IBU (77) and ABV (8.3). Reminiscent of a style brewed by the arrogant ones in the southern part of the state."
"Bottle. Pour a dark red with white head. Smelled fruity, on the more grapefruit side, hoppy and slightly malty with caramel tints. Flavor was mostly hoppy with a slight malty undertone and finishes hoppy. One of the better big reds I've had, Lagunitas made another solid hoppy beer that sells on the cheaper side of bombers that is much appreciated."
"Thanks Lagunitas. May the Lord bless the hop harvest."
"Lagunitas Lucky 13 is a hazy red-amber ale with small particles floating in it. It has a foamy, eggy, pale yellow head that has good retention and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is of strong, sweet malt. There are notes of resin and herb and a faint hint of cinnamon. It's pretty full bodied, smooth and syrupy. The finish is slightly gritty. The flavor is quite sweet. The bitterness is pretty good, so it balances it out. The aftertaste is long and sweet. It's a little sweet for my taste, but it's solid and good for sipping."
"8/4/8/4/16 (4.0/5)"
"Pours a red, average head, normal lacing. Weak nose. Tastes of sweet molasses, caramel. Lots of classic red, but nothing that stands out. Strong hops. Average red brew, probably won't try this one again unless it's given to me, though."
"Clear mahogany pour with a meringue-like off-white head. Awesome aroma of grapefruit hops, brown sugar, and pineapple. Clean, strong hop taste up front with pine and grassiness. Sweet, but not as stong as other Lagunitas beers. Taste gives way to a nice malty back, but without losing any bitterness. Resiny finish. One of the best Lagunitas beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability: This one is definetley one of my new go to red ales. It's got great balance and executes the style perfectly. A diamond in the rough to say the least. Now I know why they say Californians brew the best reds, excellent job."
"This beer pous a nice copper-redish beer with a frothy head. The first thing I taste is the sweetness of the malt followed by a nice mellow hop flavor. Dont let the mellow taste fool you this beer weighs in at over 8%. My local liquor store has a few bottles in stock and I make it a point to grab one almost everytime I stop in there. I would recommend this beer to any fan of American Red Ales."
"Pours a clear orangey-red with billowy off-white head. Impressive meringue-like retention and thick rings of lace. Smell: nice balance between sweet caramel malts and citric and earthy hops, fruity. Taste: caramel malts, grapefruit, earthy+subdued pine hops, slightly yeasty. The alcohol is very well hidden. Sweetness seems to get amplified - a little too much - halfway through the bomber. A malty hop fix? not quite. Pretty good, works as a big red ale, but a little too sweet towards the end."
"Overall a tasty brew. Nothing amazing, nothing flashy, nothing i will intentionally recommend, but it is a nice take on a ""mondo large red ale"" as alot of brewers these days think all they have to do to make an A rated red ale is hop the shit out of it and turn it into some red IPA. I would love to see a perfect melding between something like this and your HHRs and NNs. A good brew. I may have this one again, we'll find out. Give it a try, you will not be upset."
"I wanted to love this, but could not. I love aggressively hopped Red/Amber Ales. This had a chance and was just too much like a kids candy..."
" I've tried Lagunitas Maximus, which is their double ipa, for $8.99 per bomber. The Maximus may be slightly better, but certainly not more than twice as good, as price would suggest!"
"Smooth, slightly chewy, medium/full body, good effervescence, slightly hoppy aftertaste. Agood brew. A little hoppier than my normal choices and a bit more than an ale should be, I suppose."
"D- A solid amber ale with big hop characteristics. Straight from the brewery fresh this would probably be a hop explosion."
"Wow, this is a fantastic beer. For those of you that have tried Ithaca's Cascazilla and enjoyed it as much as I did, you'll absolutely love this beer. It looks and smells great, has a nice caramel taste with a hop kick to it, and finishes smooth and creamy. It's almost 9% alcohol yet you can't detect the flavor of ethanol... delicious beer."
"Pours a clear coppery color with a lot of ruby highlights when held to the light, tan head rises lazily, fades somewhat quickly, and leaves behind sheets of lacing. Smell is intense caramel, and a bit of a faint boozy smell comes through. This is a pretty intense malt bomb! Thick, sticky, chewy caramel flavors, some faint grapefruit bitterness tries to fight its way through the malt, but gets knocked back down. Mouthfeel is nice, very sticky & chewy, some lingering bitterness. Tasty, but with a borderline-cloying sweetness that would prevent this from being something I'd want a whole lot more of. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Damn good. I might have again (if I find it). It is a spectacular beer pushing toward DIPA."
"Beer poured copper ready with a generous white head that is leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is very malty with a big floral hop presence. Taste is a nice blend of caramel malts, citrus, and finishes with a generous piney hop. Mouthfeel is very smooth and very full. Drinkability is surprisingly good for such a high abv. This is a wonderful double red that is a must try if you like strong ambers."
"the drink correlates with the mouthfeel a little thick and alcohol after taste."
"This poured a clear, light auburn with light tan head. It smelled like roasted red barley with copper hops. It tasted like rich caramel malt and copper hops with a slight bit of coffee malt. It was oily with a bit of carbonation, and had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very interesting flavor that was clean and hid the alcohol well. It was easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not too much to say about this one. Alcohol's a little up there, but you knew that gettin' in to it. Like the 10 or so other Imperial Reds that Lagunitas makes, it's well-balanced, decently interesting, and well-made - they've found something that works and are sticking to it with minor variations. Does that make it terribly interesting? No, but it does make for a decent to above-average beer."
"Overall this is a solid take on a style that in my opinion is hit or miss. Good, robust flavors throughout. Definitely worth a shot."
"D - This has a big malty presence with plenty of hops, yet the balance seems a little off kilter. This is pretty tasty, but the hop profile isn't one of my favorites."
"D: I could really knock these back. The balance is superb. You get both a nice malty taste and a clean hop finish. The alcohol is amazingly hidden."
"Alcohol is very subdued. An easy drinkin' and well balanced Imperial Red."
"Pours a dark amber in color with a thin white/brown head. There is a slight clarity. Aroma was decent, mainly hops but some malt. Taste was hoppy and sweet, with a bitter aftertaste. Good texture, a lot of carbonation. A bit on the heavy side. Decent beer with good flavor, but it is on the sweet side. Not recommended for a session beer."
"Pours a very rich red dark amber color with a very large very pillowy head, lacing and head stay present throughout the drink.malt is present in the smell and taste as well.taste of hops and floral notes up front, finished with strong malt flavor. hints or bready flavors throughout.good beer not one of my favorites but its pretty good."
"Really liked this one, the best Lagunitas brew I've had so far."
"Overall this is a very good beer and another winner from Lagunitas. Seek it out while you can."
"Beautiful red hue with a bone white head that leaves a bunch of lacing. The smell is sweet like brown sugar. The taste is complex - dry and sweet with a nice alcohol burn in the finish. Perfect in the mouth with just the right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink for a big boy - totally satisfying and balanced. A delicious beer. Highest recommendation."
"Clear, reddish amber with a small, loosely creamy yellowish head. Big fruity hop nose...juicy with some brown sugar and caramel. Tastes like more of the same fruity hops and a good bit of soft, sweet underlying malt. Moderately prickly and slick adding some texture to a medium body. This is easy drinking for the strength, though I could just as easily move onto something else..."
"A good brew, probably more true to the red ale style than most others, but the hoppier ones will always get more pub."
"poured into a goblet, this was a deep reddish amber/copper with jsut a slight chill haze. creamy tan head dissipated to a nice lasting collar and lacing. malty caramel dominates the aroma with some resiny pine underneath. also maybe some vague dark dried fruit and a hint of rummy alcohol. taste follows suit flavor-wise, with the sweet caramelly malt dominating at first and a smooth bitterness balancing it out. does not seem at like like the listed 77 IBUs. long drying finish. medium to full in body with nice creamy carbonation."
"I found it to be very drinkable. This could be a good session beer."
"Overall this beer is fine but just doesn't hit my brew-spot."
"This brew poured amber with a light head, left a lacing throughout the entire pint. Nose of brown sugar and cloves. No real malt flavour (that I could detect)just a hoppy bitterness. I felt that it had a more hoppy taste than other Red Ales...I usually like Lagunitas beers, but not very fond of the Lucky 13."
"Bottom line, a wonderful beer. A bit ""thick"" in the mouth to drink too many but I don't think this beer is meant for heavy consumption. A beer I will be buying again soon. Well done."
"D: Totally sessionable. A nice change of pace from yet another hop bomb. Lucky 13's a charm."
"Very easy to drink! A good pick up! I think this is a good beer to have a few of and kick back with the fellas..."
"Body medium, creamy, and lightly chewy. Smooth mouthfeel and killer drinkability. Another winner!"
"I liked this. It drank well and the Amarillo hops were a welcome touch, adding some pizazz to a otherwise very malty and thick Imperial Amber. Good stuff from the boys in Petaluma."
"Notes: I was not blown away by this beer but it is worthy of a taste, especially if you like ambers."
"thanks to Tayner for the chance to try this beer. Wow, 271 reviews as of this writing so I'll go with a slighty different approach. It looks great, has a nice approachable hoppy taste and it works. It's a nice brew to round out the night. Worth a try if you're looking for something different."
"I'll be picking this up every once + awhile. A good 'have whenever' type brew in my opinion."
"D: Very easy drinking. No real hints of the ABV. I have become a fan of hoppier red ales as of late. Lagunitas should keep this one around they have a winner."
"Overall, not as strong as I expected. Still, very good, and a solid pick."
"D: An very underrated and underbought red/amber ale. Its evenness is unsurpassed and further cements Lagunitas as a top-5 brewery regardless of style. Get out and find this beer -- it is a top-notch brew."
"D- Just OK. Very sweet and strong, but a good experience. I don't think I will seek it out, but all in all not bad."
"I like. Find some."
"A slightly thin mouthfeel results from a little flattening, but nothing too compromising. Incredibly good beer, Lucky 13 Mondo is a gem."
"22 oz bottle. Pours red with an orange tint and over 2 cm of foamy, off-white head that is slowly diminishing. Some citrus and hops, mostly malt aroma. Caremel, citrus, and malt are the initial flavors. Flavor shifts to become drier and dominated by hops. Dry and sour aftertaste. Tons of lacing, medium body, light carbonation, and lots of warming from the alcohol. Overall, enjoyed it a lot, shocked that its rating is currently below 3.8."
"Bravo!"
"a big bad hopy monster has graced my glass, this is hopy all the way through, i love this one. it is bold and makes my toung tingle, this beer makes outher lesser beers hide in the corner trembling with feer, i would drink this one all the time if i could get my hands on it.this hops for days and keeps you coming back for more."
"Man, I am a huge fan of red ales and especially the whole product line of reds that lagunitas puts out. This one being no exception. Smells of faint hops and brown sugar. Pours a lucious head with tracings of it all the way down the glass. Tastes of some slight fruit (cherry maybe) and then lots of hops. Not quite as hoppy as say, hairy eyeball, but nice enough. Red/copper color on the pour. A really dry finish and a great beer. Hope sixers come out soon."
"Poured into a standard pint from a 22oz bottle. Hints of citrus fruit introduces the beer before the first pour. The head bursts out to form a dense orange/white creamy head that sits like a milkshake atop the deep ruby color. Citrus and grassy hop aromas fill the nose with sweet grain. As the first molocule hits the tongue the sweetness parts for the earthy grassy hop flavor. The full round flavor lasts through the whole pint with some caramel sweetness that lends to a metallic hint that your mind might pick up due to the rusty color. The head is now reduced to a dollup of whipped cream in the center of the class as I pour in the remainder of the bottle."
"Very good, solid beer. An enticing and eye catching bottle, the beer pours relatively thin and ephemeral head with stick bubbles. The smell of fairly sweet, with a distinctly fresh set of spicy. The taste is redolent a barely wine, although it's clearly not. The bottle describes it as "" a mondo large red ale," and its appearance certainly matches. The brew is a bit spicy, a healthy bite on the mouth from the 8.3 percent alcohol, and one certainly gets a hint both in smell and taste of some hops. The aftertaste is remarkably sweet; perhaps a bit much for my personal pallet, but respectably done. You'll do well with this beer, its certainly well done, but anticipate a bit of the barley wine sweet taste."
"D: This is a tasty one for sure, but the hops may induce a bit of palate fatigue by the end of 22 oz."
"D- love the balance and mouthfeel, malts are great, easily one of my faves from Lagunitas, great for style, recommended"
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Good balance. Alcohol hidden well. Overall an above average red, with a bit more of a hop bite than a typical example. Easy to drink, certainly worth having again."
"It's quite drinkable, and while featuring the hops a bit more, it retains a certain amount of balance. It's like a slightly earthier/nuttier Arrogant Bastard."
"D- its a tad plain to have me reaching for others. decently enjoyable but not something ill be missing anytime soon"
"A pretty good beer. I'm starting to like these Red Ales that are loaded with hops. They're like a dark IPAs. Recommended."
"Drinkability is high for the ABV, the alcohol is very well hidden."
"d- this is probably the best red ale i have ever tasted. this is not my favorite style of beer, however if the rest tasted this good i would reconsider. i will buy this one again and will check out their other wares."
"The really like the hop finish on this one. It seems like a perfect ending to a hard fought battle between malt and hops, with the hops finally coming out on top. Lagunitas rarely disappoints, and is very reasonably priced... Lucky 13 is yet another winner!"
"This one has a large slightly tan thick foamy head with great retention. Looks to be a deep Aubern with a redish glow. Some lace but less than I expected honestly. The smell is of carmalized malts, citrus, floral and piney hops. Cannot smell the alcohol but this one is obviously well hoped and malted. The taste is very ballanced, malts and hops peak here and there but keep each other in check. A little hint of the alcohol on the back end. This one is thick and slick leaving some hop oil residue with some lingering bitterness. Very drinkable almost too drinkable for a strong ale."
"Pours a deep amber with a small, dense off-white head that lasted quite a while and left excellent lacing. The aroma has a solid caramel malt background but with a big citrus and floral hop kick. The taste has the typical caramel malt background but has a very strong pine hop flavor and a hint of citrus as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and a pleasant bitterness in the finish. This was a great example of an amber and the alcohol was hardly noticeable."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and very sticky in your mouth. A damn good beer and very drinkable. Alcohol is hardly noticed despite the 8%+."
"Good body and carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Enjoyable."
"d: wow, what a beer. sort of like a premium version of sirius cream ale. this is what amber ales should taste like."
"Overall, it isn't bad. I cringe a little at first, because the taste of a red, especially one this bold, isn't my favorite. But then the hops come in and make everything better. Lagunitas has balanced these two flavors well, making a beer that is drinkable."
"Very tasty brew. A big bite for a red ale."
"A tasty ""high-gravity auburn offering""...gets smoother as we go, if the alcohol does start peeking through. Wait, here it comes...okay, here we go..."
"D: Incredible! This beer just begs me to drink it. I'm very satisfied with this ."
"Drinkability: Very easily drinkable and will fool you with the ABV. This is a big beer with a bigger malt profile than most IPA's but similar in flavor."
"Herbal hop bitterness greets the tongue. Toasted toffee and caramel malts fill in. Fruity sweet malts follow along with big hop flavor. Piny, resinous, and numbingly herbal. Still manages good balance with chewy caramel and fruit malts. Must be a good dose of crystal malt in this. Yum. Warming hint of fruity alcohol before a drying bitter hop finish. Medium-full body with an initial creaminess that turns a little stickier in the end. Maybe my favorite Lagunitas so far!"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. The color is a dark amber with a good two finger, tan head. The nose is hoppy with just a little sweetness. In the taste there is a little bit of citrus but not to much and a really good hop finish. The mouthfeel is a little oiliy almost viscous not to bad though. this beer has an excellent drinkability, it goes down very smooth. Another great beer from Lagunitas"
"In summary, Lagunitas Lucky 13 is a delicious ale and one I will certainly purchase again if I get the chance. It is certainly a beer worth sampling and savoring, and I recommend getting your hands on a bottle while the product is still available on the store shelves."
"Quite a drinkable beer. Sort of a nice summer evening kind of brew. Definitely a beer I'll be buying again and again."
"D: Drinkability is decent considering the ABV."
"an amazingly smooth brew ... has some beautiful and full flavours and a nearly unbeatable drinkability!! .. smell is piney and red ... happy birthday anna .. a very nice enjoyable brew that will make you coo! ..a great beer from a brewery that sometimes gets too high to notice odd happenings.."
"The flavor rides the line between a 4 and a 4.5, reminding me of a less intense, more fruity american barleywine. 13 balances impeccably between caramel-honey malts and resinous hop bitterness. The body is nicely carbonated with a medium body and a chewy, sticky mouthfeel that transitions to a lingering hoppy finish. I want more. This is quite a solid brew, and I'm glad I have the other half of the bomber to meet me at the end of this review."
"D: Nice balance between sweet and bitter."
"This a well balanced beer and something I could have more of. Too bad it was the last one I saw at the bar, or I would have had another."
"Smooth and medium-bodied, the beer is very drinkable despite the 8.3% ABV."
"For a big red I happen to like this one, it's not too overwhelming, nicely balanced, and the hops are quenching and satisfying, at least to my palate. Plus I'm digging on the tattoo flash art label, it just rounds out a great package."
"Starts off sweet but has a nicely crisp (but not overpowering) bitter finish - a good progression."
"d: a good ired in my opinion with a lot of flavors that are well-blended"
"D: This is quite a good Imperial Red, I liked it a lot, easily drinkable, would have again."
"Tasted on 6/2/08."
"Exceptionally drinkable and highly recommended."
"Pretty easy to drink, it's my first beer from the brewery, I'll probably try some others down the road."
"The alcohol is hidden, and with food this bomber was easy to put down rather quickly, and it nearly gave me a lunchtime buzz. It is definitely worth the $4, and IMO one of the best offerings from Lagunitas. Shame it is a limited beer."
"Picked this one up at ""Bottleworks"" in Seattle. I've had mixed results with this brewery but I was very curious about the labeling as a "" Mondo Large Red Ale"". Pour definitely had rosy red suggestions as well as dark orange down the sides of the glass, head was dense and cream colored, leaving lots of lacing as it dissipates. Nose was actually milder than expected for a beer with over 8 percent alcohol, I get some very nice juicy hops and a bit of bubblegum. Taste is actually very smooth and soft, well balanced caramel texture with a well-timed hop finish, alcohol is almost invisible. I think this beer is very well done, quite tasty and despite carrying a high ABV would make a good introduction to someone wanting to wander into over 7% ABV territory."
"Since we just recently got Lagunitas here in NC, I was very pleasantly surprised to see this one at Flying Saucer after enjoying a sample in April at the World Beer Festival. Poured into a Belgian glass a nice copper amber with a decent head that lasted as a thin layer and leaves spectacular lacing. Aroma was some nice caramel malt and slight pine. Taste was an almost perfect balance of burnt caramel and pine hops, very flavorable. The beer is medium bodied with some alcohol, but for the strength it's fairly well hidden. This is an immensly enjoyable beer that I would certainly enjoy again if given the opportunity."
"**Paired with peanut butter cup cookies, the sweetness brings out the pine and citrus hop tones of the brew, leaving the palate refreshed by the cleansing hops, though still finishing slightly dry and bitter."
"A nice roll of aroma and flavor through this one. I opened another b.c of a recent thread and this one did not disappoint for under $4. Will grab some more for sure."
"Another great beer from Lagunitas."
"Decent effort overall and a good example of an amped-up red ale. As Lagunitas beers are always relatively well-priced, this one is worth a try."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability - I really liked this beer. It has a big bold flavor that demonstrates a nice balance between its malty and hoppy flavors. For as bold of a flavor that it contains, it is pretty easy drinking. Good scent, good flavor, good feel - great beer."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a nonic. Dark amber with a tan 1-finger head. Lots of sticky lace and great retention. Aromas of brown sugar and caramel and a mondo dose of grapefruity hops. Flavor runs the gamut, from sticky malt sweetness to big bitter C hops to a unifying, warming finish. Lively carbonation, medium-full body, a touch of booziness."
"It's been a while since I had a Lagunitas beer, but this one definitely reminds me of my previous fascination with their line. Good, strong ale. Very drinkable. Love the lack of bitterness."
"D: This beer desperately wants to be Arrogant Bastard. It is a great brew and amazingly easy to drink considering the ABV. This beer is not as complex as AB, but that can be a good thing. This beer doesn't kill your palate but still creates some awesome flavors. Plus I could drink a couple of these in a night where I couldn't drink more than one AB bomber. I would love to do a side by side with this and AB. This is still a great beer."
"D - I'm glad I only got a taster. This one left me disappointed. Great appearance and smell, no taste."
"D - this is a really solid beer from Lagunitas (big shocker, I know). I really enjoyed the taste, but the ABV does limit the drinkability to a couple. Still, would definitely rock it and have been recently."
"For 3.29, unbelievably good. Nice thick mouthfeel, and the alcohol is supremely hidden."
"D: Definitely drinkable despite high alcohol. Not my favorite red ale but would like to have again."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a head that didn't linger but left some sticky lacing. Smelled of ""skunky"" (not a pejorative) hops. Taste is based on competition between strong hops and thick malts; not so much balance as two strong factors struggling to win out, but in the end tasty. Thick mouthfeel, almost syrupy. A good, big, tasty beer at a good value."
"Into a chalice glass, this beer forms a lovely, lasting head upon the pour. It has a nice polished mahogany color, clear when held to the light. Sweet malt, caramelly, in the nose, with a lot of resinous hop aroma. Very nice, complex malt on the first taste, nutty with a little bit a molasses hook, followed by a huge blast of dry bitter piney hoppiness. Finish is a mix of lingering sweetness and dry bitterness."
"Good beer, I tend to enjoy red ales and one of my favorites of all time is Port Brewing's Shark Attack Red... This compares, it doesn't have quite as much body as the Shark Attack but it is well worth buying and drinking. Excellent mouthfeel and the taste is excellent. I recommend anyone who can buy this at a store to definitely pick one up or if you can get it tossed in on trade then go for it otherwise don't search high and low for it."
"A fine mondo large red ale to say the least. Sure, at 8.3% ABV, it's bigger than most session beers I like, but I could easily down a couple of these bombers without batting an eye. Big, bold, and very very tasty. I'll definitely revisit this beer in the future."
"Add this to the list of strong ales brewed by Lagunitas, and this is one that's worth going after. Oddly, I haven't their other two strong ales they make yet."
"This is a great value. I think I paid $3 for the 22oz bottle. Hold on, I'm heading out to buy some more."
"An intensely robust brew, Lucky 13 is bursting with hoppy goodness and harmonious balance; ""Crazy!"" declare my tastebuds in an uproar."
"I would have to say this is worth seeking out. I'll be picking up some more before it's all gone."
"D - Good beer that was very well put together. I would love to try this on tap. Alcohol content keeps you from having too many."
"D: Pretty high drinkability for the style. Seems like the alcohol and flavor isn't quite as extreme as in some other cases. A malt-dominant brew to be sure, but enough of a hop balance as to not become a malt bomb. Personally, I like my strong ales a little more hard hitting in general, but I have to say this is pretty darn good. Taking something like an amber ale and turning it into this is a nice piece of work."
"Lagunitas Lucky 13 Mondo Large Red Ale pours a reddish copper with a tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is a strong malty aroma that also has some noticeable hops. There is a thick mouthfeel and a burst of flavor, it's moderately hoppy with a really strong malt backing. Really nice."
"A daily drinker for a nice price at about 3.50$ for a bomber. Good over all flavor with a good strength for those of strong livers and lack of taste buds."
"As always, a tasty beer from one of my favorite CA breweries. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is pushing the high end, but flavor is good. Rounds out to be easily consumed but in limited quantity."
"D-Very drinkable beer."
"D- Interesting, very drinkable considering the alcohol level."
"D - I'll have to look for this again. I recall that it was a pretty good value. I really like this one. It's big hop, but not 'hit you in the head' hops."
"22 oz bottle in to a goblet, paid 4.49 from local store. Pours clear amber with a nice soft head and lacing climbing the sides. Smells a mellowed citrusy, piney covered by malt sweet. Tastes a lot like it smells. Malt covering a strong IPA like taste. It is very creamy in your mouth. As good as I hoped it would be."
"D - Not a session beer IMO but good when you want a hoppy drink without going for the DIPA"
"Overall: Don't know if I'd commit to buying a 4-or 6-pack of this, but I would definitely revisit it, given the opportunity. Nice."
"This is a very nice big beer and I am glad it seems to be an annual treat now... A very good/great beer for an unbeatable value."
"D: Lots of flavor and very drinkable for such a big beer, but overall not one I would just to revisit. Excellent purchase for $3.25 a bomber however."
"D - Hey, I was surprised by the ABV. This sucker could hurt me."
"i had this on tap at city beer in san francisco and it was even better than the bottle."
"You can't go wrong with Lagunitas. The Betty Paige look alike on the bottle is a nice touch. Had this one well chilled in my Sam Adams pub glass. Pours a nice iced tea color with a wee head that yeilds nice lacing. The smell at first is smokey, reminiscent of a rauch beer. Some piney hops in the background and then some floral hops come in to play. Taste is oily hops with some floral accents that sticks to the tongue and doesn't go away. I'm getting some grapefruit too. A nice ""mondo large"" red ale."
"Overall: Well it's May 28 in Tampa Florida and it's hotter than balls. I mowed the yard trimmed the palms and tried to take a dip in the pool to get myself right after a bit of overexposure. The pool was nice, but a hoppy treat is what I really needed. I pulled this baby from the cellar and popped it open. Hoppy goodness in a bottle cures all ills. Yum...Happy 13th Lagunitas....Here's to MANY more."
"Smooth fine carbonation, a bit fizzy at first but some swirling smooths it out nicely. Some slick oiliness. Quite drinkable."
"Very hoppy, so not that easy to drink, but it warms up nicely. This is a very good beer to find, thanks to my guy at Armanetti's, love it."
"Drinkability: Another extremely solid brew from Lagunitas, who's starting to take the indefatigable crown of brewing away from some other breweries who I continue to love. They're always experimenting, coming up with new brews, and pushing boundaries. And I'm there to buy as much as I can. A solid ASA in the style of what's more like an Imperial Amber or lighter DIPA, but awesome, and certainly worth a try and beyond."
"The beer poured a clear, reddish-amber color with a thick, cream-colored head into a 12 oz pilsner glass. The aroma was of citrusy hops, with a slightly sour component in the background. The initial taste was slightly sweet, followed up with an intense hop flavor in the middle and a strong, yet clean & crisp hop bitterness at the finish. A bit fizzy mouthfeel, but good lacing down the inside of the glass. An intensely hoppy brew."
"Excellent beer, and was happy to have it back this year."
"Pours a beautiful clear red color, tan foamy head that settles very quickly. Light lacing. Aroma is heavily fruited, with some pear notes and some nice sweet caramel malt. Taste is also somewhat fruity, with just the right amount of hops. Smooth mouthfeel, not to syrupy, but the alcohol does dry it a bit. A very nice red ale, great flavor. Great finish. Would love to have this again"
"Recommended..."
"D: The residual sweetness & harsh bitterness are having a battle on my tastebuds."
"Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste."
"A damn good beer at a very reasonable price. I recommend this beer."
"Smell is very hoppy with sweet malts flowing through nose. Taste is hoppy with dark fruit notes and herbaceous tones. A bit overwhelming at first, but as glass warms a bit it becomes very nice. Bubbles are balanced and has a great finish with clean aftertaste."
"A reddish brownish orange in color with medium off-white head, some lacing down the glass. Great clarity and steady carbonation. Smell is a good balance of hop and malt. Citrus, grapefruit, some pine. Caramel and brown sugar. Not too big, not too bold. It doesn't come at you like some but is more subtle and seductive. Taste is excellent. Again, well balanced but the hops win over here. Anybody who says this doesn't have hops is plain crazy. A heaping helping are here for the taking if you just notice them. Big, juicy citrus. Orange, tangerine, mostly grapefruit though. Good caramel backbone and some toasted bread. Nice bitter mouthfeel with some decent body to it. By no means thick and excellent carbonation on this one. Damn drinkable as well. It's not boisterous or in your face. Subtle but will get your attention with it's great flavor and balance. I wish I had more because I'd honestly crack another right now. It's that drinkable."
"This is a fun and drinkable big ale. I reviewed it before seeing the internets, so I didn't know to expect Arrogant Bastard. It's really terrific and I'll be on the lookout for a draft."
"I am very impressed. For a very hoppy beer to not have an oppressive aftertaste makes this a very drinkable selection. As I said, I am really not a fan of reds, but this hoppy red balances out the hops so well. Perhaps this was the intention. There will be a spot in my fridge for this beer as long as I can get it."
"D: good drinkability, big and hoppy. The high alcohol and coarse hopping may limit those who are not big hopheads, but for those who are should really enjoy this."
"Overall, a good enough drinker, but it lacks any real uniqueness. It's just trying to be big."
"Not a big fan of imperial reds and this tasted a lot like one because of its heavy reliance on malt, not my favorite from Lagunitas, probably would not drink again, might be worth trying if you like this style of beer"
"This is simply a solid, if unspectacular, beer. It's kind of like a cross between a barleywine and an IPA, without committing to either one. Lagunitas did a good job distinguishing this big red ale from either of those styles. It's a good beer, and well worth picking up. Recommended."
"The taste was a caramel malty and spicy. It left a strong hop bite or alcohol bite on the finish. It was a bit chewy which was cool. And covered your mouth with some hop bitterness. A very enjoyable beer with a good abv. Mikey likes."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, especially at 8.3% ABV. Although it wasn't the smoothest brew I have had, it was easy to put down and perhaps closer to an Imperial Red Ale rather than an American Strong Ale. The alcohol is pretty well hidden underneath everything, so be careful with this one as it was put down no problem in less than a half hour."
"D: Tasty brew... but maybe a bit too much going on(hence a slightly lowered taste score). I do love hoppy red's, though. 8.3% isn't too obvious but this is definitely a big beer. I'll have no problem finishing the bomber, though."
"This beer was big in both flavor and mouthfeel. Very sweet, almost cloying."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer, a great choice for an anniversary brew, very drinkable for a bigger beer. Well balanced aroma and taste, possibly the biggest negative is the haziness. But a great beer, regardless."
"M/D: Body is medium, carbonation is high. Drinkability is fine for 8.30%. Really a nicely done brew, my first that I have tasted from Lagunitas."
"Deep amber orange with a big frothy yellow tinted cap. I don't have to get my nose very close to the glass before I smell the bountiful citrus and pine hops in this one, but a deeper whiff reveals the sweet malty caramel which accompanies. The sweet side of oranges and grapefruits combines with caramel malt sweetness in the front as their rinds provide back end bitterness. A bit of spicy rye in the middle (credit to peeking at Buckeye below, I wouldn't have attributed that spiciness to rye on my own, but I believe you are correct sir) with earthy, piney hops joining in on the bitter finish. Medium to full in body with good carbonation contributing to a moderately creamy mouthfeel. I've had Imperial Red before--although I've never officially reviewed it--and retain very fond memories, so I think I lean slightly toward that offering. This one is really good though, and it may take a faceoff to decide the true champ."
"Lagunitas Brewing Company is a fantastic big beer brewery. Olde Gnarlywine (barleywine) and Brown Shugga' (American strong ale) are two of the most delicious examples of their respective styles in the world of American craft beer. I don't care if a renamed Lucky 13 becomes their new Imperial red or if they keep the original Imperial Red. They're both superb."
"D-A solid GOOD brew overall. Nothing outstanding but nothing disappointing either. A nice beer for a 13th anni...Happy Birthday Lagunitas! Keep up the good work."
"Sampled 4-1-07. Pours a perfectly clear and very dark ruby/garnet with a tan head that falls to nothing after a bit. Nose is piney hops. Flavor is firm with those piney hops. It's no hop bomb. It doesn't try to blow you away. It is a smooth and even flavor profile that provides an excellent drinking experience. Feel is decent on the liquid with a slightly meaty feel and the carbonation is good too. Overall a very drinkable brew. Seeing as how this is an anniversary brew and it is not one that is trying to blow my taste buds out of the water, I have to wonder if this might just be the direction these breweries are heading in that have been open for 10+ years. A maturely brewed beer that doesn't have to show off to be good? Hmmmm. Perhaps a sign of brewing skill?"
"Tastes of sweet toasty malt, lots of hops (citrus, pine) and spices."
"Drinkability- This is quite drinkable, but I'm not so sure I would do more than one in a sitting. Initally I was sure I would have another beer afterward, but soon after the warmth started creeping and there was no need. Great to have this in the 22oz size though as it is just enough compared to a smaller size."
"A solid brew from a dependable brewery."
"Overall a tasty and easy to drink ale."
"D: Good; I enjoyed drinking this bottle, but this is plenty for me in one sitting."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a big beer. It provides plenty of character without crossing over the line of drinkability."
"Pours a nice clean/clear light mahongy color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head, which leaves some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, sweet, very slight dark fruit, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, big on malts/caramel, some dark fruits. Medium body. Very drinkable, another very tasty brew from a underrated brewery, highly recommended."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"This is a nicely balanced, ""sipping"" ale. You would want to be in the mood for something hoppy, but not overpoweringly so."
"D - Overall a good brew. It's an imperial red ale, a bit more hoppy than a regular red. I'd like a little bit more balance myself, but this was very interesting."
"Bottle: Poured a deep red color ale with a large purer white foamy head with some good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of intense bitter hops with some notes of citrus. Taste is also dominated by some citrus and grapefruit like hops with an intense bitter ending. Malt with some caramel characteristic is quite subtle with some semi-sweet notes. Body is above average with some nice carbonation."
"D: This is the second strong ale from Lagunitas that I have not been a fan of. I find their IPAs to be excellent, but this one is just too over the top."
"Truly excellent drinkability here. Lagunitas might as well rename this smooth 13 because that is what it is smooth as all hell. A must try beer and a not very expensive beer either."
"Clear, deep reddish amber with a thick, beige head. Lots of chunky lacing composed of fine bubbles and great retention. Citrusy grapefruit aroma, fragrant hops, pine needles, floral and fruity with a malty background. Moderate bitterness with a big hop flavour - lots of grapefruit, orange, some pine and fruitiness. Sweet caramel provided some balance, as did a bit of spice and mild alcohol. Bitterness builded into the finish. Medium to full bodied and a little sticky, with lowish carbonation and a pleasant warmth at the back of the palate. Good stuff and quite a hop showcase. Easy drinking for a big red ale."
"First sip reveals a soft smooth texture with mild gentle carbonation. The flavor starts with some bready yeast and caramel malt and rolls to some slightly grassy and also grapefruity hops. The hops are not over the top, but do leave a lingering astringency on my palate after each sip. The ABV is well hidden and the beer is easy to drink. I enjoy this beer a lot and it is just what I needed after a long day."
"D - This is definitely a delicious offering from Lagunitas, but when pitte against their Imperial Red, its shortcomings are obvious, especially where overall balance is concerned. Otherwise, this one is a treat on its own merit anyway."
"This is probably only the second ""Double Red"" type beer I've had and they both have been really nice. Go get it."
"Certainly a big Red, but I think I had my hopes just a bit too high for this brew. Starts off with the obvious amber hue, great clarity, and nicely carbonated. Off-white head retention withstood the session well. Aromas of toasted malts, light caramel and barley malt rose high above the spicy, citrusy hops. Light bready / yeasty fermentation scent gave a sense of depth to the smell. Tastes kick off with the barley / caramel flavors, but well attenuated for clean taste. Along with the yeast, bready character, the beer tastes very sturdy. Spiced up with a mix of warming alcohols, orage-flavored and grapefruit hops, and a modest peppery note late. The beer actually feels light compared to the bold flavors, and became a bit metallic late. Finished clean but a little bite-ey. Although I enjoyed this beer well, I did not prefer it to their standard Imperial Red."
"Pours an almost clear red/orange, very brilliant, huge off white head, massive lacing, great retention, just doesn't want to quit. Aroma is fantastic, very sticky caramel malt, resinous pine and floral hops, signature Lagunitas but just jacked up a couple notches. Grapefruit, bread, very malty, very hoppy, nicely balanced. Taste is bready caramel malt, citrus/floral, more toffee, iron, not very much complexity, but very drinkable and balanced big beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost sticky, low to medium carbonation, can't taste the 8.3% ABV. Very well done strong ale. Thanks James!!"
"Highly recommended. This is how I like my reds."
"Pours clear copper-red with thin film on top and plenty of persistent lace. Smell is low-toned, with damp earth, rough grains, and pine hops. Really over the top in flavor. Huge raw pine overtones lead to a chewy orange fruit and grain center. Prickly bitter pine and alcohol finish. Mostly creamy rich mouth feel, with just enough carbonation. Flavorful, but not very easy-drinking since it's such a brute."
"22 oz. bomber. The beer pours a solid deep amber color with a 2 fingers of ivory head over top that is maintained by a massive carbonation that keeps cascading up. The clarity is excellent as well. The head sits very well over top and doesn't fall for anything. The aroma is piney and spicey hop that sits over a deep caramel base. Smells nice to me. Flavor is right there with the aroma. It hits first with an earthy pine and a moderate toasty and caramel maltyness. It finishes with a mild bitterness and a reprise of the earthy and pine notes. The flavor on this one is very big, but not at all overbearing. The toastyness really works well with the earthy notes from the hop. I don't find any alcohol flavor in there which is a surprise from the ABV. Mouthfeel is moderate with a mild carbonation. Overall, this one really presents itself as a nice moderate abv drinking beer to me and not a big bad-ass strong ale like it is. The flavors are strong, but not overpowering. I really find this to be a nice beer."
"Overall: to paraphrase Miles, I've come never to expect greatness from Lagunitas, and this one is no exception. It's underwhelming in almost every way. Blah."
"Thick and hearty, I know it sounds like soup. But this one really fills you up in an ""it's good to be full"" kind of way. An all around nice offering on a rainy summer day."
"A huge beer with loads of flavor, but at the same time very simple. Big malt, big red ale, big resin hops, big yum. It's really not much more than that, just an amazing big red ale. Love it."
"Mouthfeel is full and rich, a little tannic and grainy. Fairly drinkable, a good session beer for a very short session."
"It was also difficult to review for the simple reason that it didn't last long enough. I couldn't find things to say fast enough to keep up with the pace at which I was drinking it. I was too busy enjoying it; this is seriously tasty. A dang nice offering!"
"Appears a clouded caramel copper tone large cream off white head large bubbled lacing forms thick and evenly in my pint glass. Aromatics contain spicy herbaceous hop bouqets kind bud if you will deep pine ccents raw citus peel with grassy highlights earthiness going on, deep carmel malt sweetness touch of brown sugar and alcohol going on. Flavors contain caramel brown sugar malts mild sweetness, strong upfront bitterness, raw hops bring, pine, citrus, and grassy herbal tones. Great west coast hop monster noticeable 8.3% abv in there as well. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied definitely slick with oily hop resins in the texutre bitterness is a bit unrelenting. Drinkability solid all around big hoppy beer Lagunitas contines to please me I definitely welcome them into this 13th year in operation."
"Poured a bright copper color with thick off-white head that lasted long and left good lacing up and down the glass. Aroma was a citrus grapefruit hops, mixed with a touch of malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is slightly oily, but crisp, and the flavor was very muich reminded me very much of an IPA, tangy citrus-hops with a touch of malt, and a finish that is long and bitter. A damn good beer that I will definitely have again."
"Citrus flavor, but thankfully there is a bit of hops here to keep the sweetness in check. Still there is a lingering citrus sweetness that does not appeal to me. Overall it's pretty good. You can tell they really tried to balance this one but just fell a tad short for me. Maybe aged a year or so would help, who knows..."
"D: A good beer, 'Anniversary Release'-worthy. Something about the hop profile and flavor had to grow on me, then I began to enjoy the bitterness and relative dryness. Not one I'd rush back to, for my own tastes vary from what this offers, but still a good beer worth picking up. Recommended."
"Notes -- Having had the Arrogant Bastard recently, I've got to say this one gives Stone a run for its money in the Strong Ale category. Especially when you factor in the cost. I was so pleased with this one that I immediately beer-mailed two friends to recommend it. Check it out."
"M&D - the brown sugary/resin-esque sweetness lends a smooth mouthcoat that battles with the bitterness, the finish is a little harsh, but otherwise a pleasant beer to drink"
"Pours a very hazy deep red/amber. Tan 2 finger head. Aroma is mild citrus and pine hops with some malts beneath it. Taste is mild malty sweetness with a very complex hop profile to go along with it. Definite pine and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is perfect. Very drinkable and it'll get ya drunk! Just kidding. Another excellent brew from Lagunitas, who need to make this and the Freak Out regular releases."
"Malty and satisfying, this brew has a personality of its own, while being adaptable to the need of most who demand a quality brew."
"I liked it. A cousin/friend of Arrogant Bastard, Gordon, Nugget Nectar? Aggressively hopped, yet pretty well balanced. I'm going to have to find some more!"
"15 months later, another bottle not as good.Dry but good head."
"Crisp and dry, it was a purty strong IPA at 8.3%, almost burned the chicken during the second bomber."
"Overall very good drinkability of a high ABV and high hopped beer."
"Upon first swig, the palate is blasted with hops. Its fresh pine upfront, followed by grapefruit. The hop character is pretty complex here as they are also spicy and slightly floral towards the finish. The beer ends with the malty sweetness noted in the aroma in the form of brown sugar. Mouthfeel is full bodied and the beer is smooth and viscous in the mouth with a good level of carbonation. The 8% abv is well hidden, making this potentially dangerous as it goes down easy. This is the best beer I have had from Lagunitas. A very good beer."
"a good offering from that fine brewery in petaluma"
"Drinkability: Oh, hey, is it good? I guess getting hit in the mouth with a tangelo is pretty fun! If it was anymore fun there would be mobs rioting in the streets."
"This is a red ale with attitude! I tend to really like the IPAs and such and this red ale made me smile."
"A very interesting beer, I saw red ale and thought it was not going to be that good. A deep red amberish color. A big hoppy nose, and sweetness in there too. In the taste, a sweet texture and big on the hops. I guess mondoo means that it makes a red ale better. A bit too sweet by the end, but another home run from Lagunitas!"
"The more I drank it, the more I liked it."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is very good, an enjoyable big red ale if there ever was one."
"Despite the high ABV, this is a nice, easy beer to drink. Nice brew if you can get it"
"Notes: It is a large red ale, but I was hoping for something bigger. Not in terms of alcohol, but the body, malt flavor, and some sweetness. The hop aroma and flavor is definitely there, but the bitterness isn't."
"Very creamy medium to full bodied brew. Bitter, dry aftertaste with some slight burn from the alcohol present. Hop oils coat the tongue really nicely, giving it a bit of a slick feel. I am starting to feel the abv in this one as I near the end of the bottle, but overall a really enjoyable beer that goes down rather easy."
"Pours a dark amber color with slight ruby red highlights; thick, compact, off-white head with nice tracing and sustain. Aromas of very fresh, bitter hops (lots of citrus with a little pine, perhaps Amarillo and cascade). It finishes with a nice candy sweetness that is a nice touch, a perfect DIPA aroma. In the mouth, my initial impression was sweetened grapefruit juice. It was not quite balanced enough, and leaning towards the sweet/malty end was a bit of a surprise coming from Lagunitas. There simply wasn't enough bitterness to meet all the crystal malt sweetness it brought, it was borderline cloying for me. In addition, the malts didn't proclaim themselves very distinctly, not toasty, bready or yeasty, a little nondescript for being a ""red ale"". Mouthfeel was where this beer suffered the most: it was sticky and slick, medium carbonation couldn't cut through all the stickly sweetness. Drinkability was fine, the aroma and fresh hop flavor were enough to give this beer high marks, but it's not something I need to check out again."
"D-Unbelievably easy to drink. You could get in trouble putting down more than a bomber of this. Definately not for the nay-sayer, but a gift to the fellow hopheads."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable for any hophead."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not very filling, good kick to it, if the label didn’t read “a mondo large red ale” I’d swear this was a 2IPA and a very good one at that. This beer is one that I could drink for a whole and enjoy the entire time."
"Thirteen is indeed lucky here. Happy anniversary to Lagunitas. Anyone feel free to join in the toast."
"D: Good and strong. I'm not sure about the style classification on the site. Drinkability is ok. One bomber did it for me but I would drink it again in the future."
"an epic red ale - reminiscent of a barley-wine and carries a wallop."
"Pours a dark copper hue with a nice khaki colored head. Lacing is very sticky here and there. Smell is of light floral hops with a lemony bite, a bit weaker than I had anticipated. A little bit of caramel malt undertone in the nose as well. Taste is a very crisp citrus hop. I can't really taste much more than hops, but they are pretty mild. Not much complexity. Mouthfeel is light/medium body with a subtle carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good for the abv. I'm not sure this is a strong ale, maybe a red/amber ale? This is a tough one to categorize. It's ok, but don't go out of your way to try this one."
"This for me was the ""best of show"" at the March 9, 2007 Beer and Bread Beerfest in Arcata, CA.. Poured a simply beautiful dark amber tending toward copper that raised a remarkably attractive off-white head that left clean rings of lacing as it slowily diminished. Af first sniff you are simply blasted by the pine hops. Smells almost like an IPA. A couple swirls of the glass then released some wiffs of lemon. Mouthfeel is like liquid gold, with a wonderful zip to it without any bite. Flavors are more malts and caramel as it shows up as a strong ale instead of an IPA The alcohol is nicely hidden. You can probably tell I liked this one a lot, and for me is the best thing Lagunitas has ever produced. We simply have to get some on the shelves up here in Eureka so others can relish this fantastic brew."
"22oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a clear medium gold, with little carbonation and lacing. Aroma is strong and hoppy. Taste is the same. Very nice and full. This is classified as a ""Mondo Red Ale"" on the label, but it certainly has lots inside to keep the hopheads happy. This is more like an IPA than I was expecting - not that there's anything wrong with that!"
"D - A pretty tasty brew, but not difficult to stomach a full bomber at a sitting. You'll feel it after the first pint, gaurunteed."
"Thick body and modest carbonation. Could use more carb to help lift the syrupy off the tongue."
"MF/Drinkability: Nice agreeable texture. Creamy and smooth. Lightly carbonated, but definitely noticeable. Medium to medium-full in body. A good drinker. Flavorful and enjoyable."
"22 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. The color was a bright red-orange with a perfect white head that settled to a creamy coating on top of the beer. The smell was a little grassy hops. The taste was some caramel, more grassy hops, some citrus, and alcohol. The alcohol really tingled my mouth and was not at all hidden. That definitely takes away from the drinkability. If you like reds give this one a try. Not as good as Nugget Nectar but still pretty tasty."
"I guess every American brewery has to make a ""Strong Ale"" ala ""Arrogant Bastard"". This is Lagunitas' entry. Balanced, in the way that putting two tons on each end of a seesaw is balanced. Fine if you are into it, but it's a bit like getting hit in the tastebuds with a hammer."
"Balanced and flavorful. A big beer with slightly more malt than hops. Dangerously drinkable, the high ABV is well masked. Pick this one up if you get the chance."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, only high abv limits sessionability."
"Wow. How is this not acclaimed? More importantly, at 3.99 a bomber why is this still sitting on shelves?!?"
"I'm going to pick up another to cellar."
"Bigger mouthfeel then I expected. Pine needles and pine tar flavors. Sweet caramel malt notes play a secondary role to the hops. Carbonation blast gives way to a spicy hop presence that lasts into the finish. Smells quote piney and hoppy, but the hops are more spicy in the flavor. Quite a nice tasting impy red ale. Higher abv goes unnoticed. Definitely one to seek out if you can, although this was only brewed once."
"Medium bodied with nice carbonation to keep it from being too thick. Pretty drinkable for what it is. A solid brew, I wouldn't mind if this was available year-round instead of Maximus."
"This poured a burnt orange colour from a 22oz bomber, and was without question, the hoppiest thing I have had in a long time. I would almost say extremely hoppy..floral. It had fantastic head retention, holding its lovely pillowy cap of foam for several minutes, and leaving a nice sticky web of lace on the glass. A very solid looking beer. Smell was comprised almost entirely of hops and nothing else. Taste, too, seemed very unbalanced to the side of hops and nearly bereft of any malt whatsoever. Another good, but fairly average brew from a brewery that I feel is really good at making such brews: Decent, but nothing to write home about."
"Thanks to Brewbaca for the sample."
"I like it but it's a bit of a hammer. It doesn't really have any finesse, it just kind of hits you over the head with alcohol and hoppiness."
"Rich, creamy and smooth, a delightfully hoppy ale that has enough malt in the style of a red ale to keep it all together. Delicious!"
"D- I really like this brew. I wish they made it as a regular beer. I would pick a few of these up."
"D- This beer has a big hop flavor with a unique musty flavor that adds a mystery to them. There is nice supporting malt flavor that really compliment the hops."
"In a word, balanced describes this brew. Its complexity is worthy of several. This would fit well in the American IPA category as well. A new favorite for me."
"This offering from Lagunitas pours a dark orange with red highlights. The aroma is sweet, malty caramel, honey, spicy hops, pine, tarragon, lots of rustic earthy spices. The mouthfeel is syrupy, coating the mouth with a caramel bitterness...the taste falls in line with the aroma, bready, honey, sweet, earthy notes just a wonderful brew. Lagunitas never fails to create a nice, drinkable beer. This is one that I will buy a few more bottles of and keep for a ""rainy"" day."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a beautiful clear amber red color. About two good fingers of thick, pillowy, off-white head formed. Decent retention and left moderate amount of lace. Nice thick malty aroma up front, with a nice hoppiness to it. Somewhat of a fruity aroma as well. Flavors of hops, malt, short bready tones, small hints of citrus fruits, all with a sweet earthiness . Definitely a nice smooth hop bite to it. Nice medium feel in the mouth.No alcohol present. Minimal carbonation. Very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Pours a clear deep reddish orange with a frothy tan head. The head is large and lasts a long time with great lacing. The smell has a creamy vanilla and citrus fruit aroma to it that is both pungent and very good. The taste has a strong hop bitterness to it with citrus fruit flavors,vanilla,carmel,and alcohol. The m/f is medium with the flavors not mixing all that well. This is a good beer,but with some cellaring this could be great."
"A slight amber, slightly cloudy. Could be a cold haze though. Strong aroma of hops. Very high in finishing hops( Cascade ? ). Very clean mouth feel. Almost no after taste except the heavy hops. The high alcohol content is almost unperceivable. The kind of beer that can sneak up on you and before you know it you're drunk. Excellent beer."
"I'm really starting to get into the Big Red Beer deal and it's becoming one of my most sought after styles."
"Ovr: Very solid beer. Very hoppy and a bit hot on the alcohol downgrades this a little, but very tasty for a strong ale/DIPA."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich, malty aroma that boasts of pale, crystal, and bisquit malts along with a wicked hop aroma that is quite bitter. The taste is great also. It's extremely bitter with loads of citrus hops from start to finish. The malt bill adds a bit of complexity. It's built with a bunch of specialty grains which add excellent flavor to the beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer with great malt and hop character. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"A very nice beer. This is a great pair to go with almost anything. Cheers on the exayeayeaye to the peeps at Lagunitas. Worth a try by anyone with a love for this style."
"Wow, I could drink alot of this stuff! It's probably one of the better beers I've had by Lagunitas by far and suits me just right. So seek this out and enjoy. It has a little of everything that exudes the West Coast style of what an American Strong Ale needs to be. Very good stuff. Yum!"
"A nice dark amber-brown, it pours with a thin but persistent head. Aroma is very hoppy and makes one think of an evergreen tree. Taste is outrageously hoppy - a must for any hop fanatic! The flavor is like the way a pine tree smells, but there is minimal bitterness. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. Even with all its hoppiness, it is smooth and pleasant to drink."
"Overall, this is another great ale from Lagunitas, not only one of the best of their brews, but one of the best Strong Ales around. Highly reccommended."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It is light to medium bodied and very, very smooth. Alcohol is masked very well. Goes down surprisingly easy at 8.3%. Overall, it's a very good beer. Highly recommended. Pick it up while you can."
"Another big time winner from this NoCal brewer hot damn!.Poured into an impy pint glass a clear deep amber/bronze with billowing 2 1/2 finger slight off white head that stuck like glue to the glass leaving soap scum-like lace behind as it settled slowly.If you like BIG hops then you'll like the nose of this beer its like walking thru a pine forest huge pine needle and grapefruit rind aromas with just a hint of caramel and biscuit hmm Amarillos in there?Yes I am quite certain Amarillo's in there oh man,the flavors are piney and citrusy along with some geranium-like leafiness intertwined with underlying caramel and lightly sweet bread dough,to me though the hop punch steals the show hands down and I applaud Lagunitas on their 13th Anniversary beer this is a left coast gem."
"Drinkability: I've had a few Lagunitas brews before, but I believe this is my favorite one so far. I didn't have a problem drinking a whole bomber bottle by myself and neither will you. Would I drink another one in the future? I sure would! If the label doesn't entices you to buy a bottle, then maybe it's hop content will. Well done Lagunitas on the beer and for choosing to put that sweet ass label on it."
"Drinkability is superb. Full flavored, but not overbearing, carbonation makes this refreshing. And as I said I like the flavor profile in this one. 3 bucks a bottle...Schweet!"
"Yes, I said extreme up there, and I don't think that's a dirty word. And especially when it's an anniversary brew, if it's well done, it's actually a plus. the balance is rather impressive, and despite a solid ABV it drinks smooth and swell, though one bomber is the likely limit. And so, to fall back on a cliche, I am lucky to have found Lucky 13."
"Drinks very easy despite the bigness. This is a winner from a brewery that produces quite a few IMO"
"Drinkability: It's tasty, that's for sure. I'm not getting a deep complexity, though, so it's probably one and done."
"Overall, a very fine brew! It's well made and well balanced. A nice big brew that's not over the top and is very drinkable."
"D- Very nice and well balanced hoppy Red that is noticeably easier to drink than other performers in the ""Strong Ale"" category. Sweet citrus tones and short finish make this a refreshing ale that can be enjoyed repeatedly through the night."
"I'd like to see more of these hoppy west-coast Reds and Ambers. Good hops deserve good malt. This beer had a fruity bubble-gummy hoppiness that I really like in the new hop varietals, and a balanced caramel malt backbone - it kinda reminded me of Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye. The finish is mostly hops and brainiac chemicals with touches of biscuit and caramel."
"I was recommended this beer because of its hoppy aromas and flavors and I must say that it did not disappoint. This is a must for all hopheads...even though its obviously not he hoppiest beer, but the hop characters are very apparent and enjoyable. Big recommendations on this one and I can't wait to try more brews from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability- Very nice. This is a very very tasty brew that is a great version of my favorite style. The 8.3% ABV is present and noticeable on both the tongue and head. This is an excellent beer that I could easily over-indulge on."
"While I am enjoying this one, the flavor is not remarkable - - going back on the taste after it has warmed up considerably - -; creamy and balanced between malt and hops until the swallow. More of a hoppy flavor after it warms up (a lot). A lingering bitterness at the end. I'm glad that i had the opportunity to try it."
"This is Red. It's Tasty. It's Great. Get it!"
"Kind of dry. Leaves a coating on the tongue. Very good, very bitter red brew. A hoppy red, what a great trend. Delish."
"Drinkability? Yes! This is another excellent offering from a hugely underrated brewery. And at $2.99 for a bomber?! Come on! Go out and grab a couple of bottles, and then drink them fresh! I think some other breweries would charge twice as much for a beer of equal or lesser quality."
"Overall- A big flavored beer that the huge alcohol flavor almost ruins. Nice, never the less."
"An excellent big, strong, potent, hoppy red ale. I love hoppy reds and this, so far, is the best I've come across. Really an enjoyable and tasty beer."
"Drinkability: nice and bold but this is more of a hearty brew not intended for multi-glass consumption. Pick up a bottle of this if you see it."
"Overall, Lagunitas has a real winner here, it's a shame it's only a one-off. I'm gonna have to stock up while I can, before you read this review and buy them all!"
"Pours a dark amber with some orange highlights. The head quickly disappears, but it leaves some great lacing. The smell is tangy malt, piney hops, and orange or maybe even tangerine citrus. The taste starts malty and with a chewy mouthfeel with more orange and tangerine citrus. This is followed by some delicious bubblegum flavors and a long finish of piney and citrusy hops. Really flavorful and with a big, creamy mouthfeel. I could drink several of these, but probably shouldn't. A worthy anniversary brew from this underrated brewery."
"Pours a dark orange copper brown with a nice thick head. Citrus and pine hops aroma with a touch of malt sweetness. Thick malt flavor and for me I detect a little smokeness. Mouthfeel is lucious and thick-drinkability is high-bt beware as this baby packs a punch. I can't wait for #14"
"The body is BIG, the carbonation near perfect and the alcohol is burried deep in the flavor of this tasty brew... a finely crafted brew indeed. If you can find it, buy it and enjoy it... I know I will. Cheers."
"22 oz. bottle- color of reddish brown , with a thick off white head - nose of spruce , malty , caramel , butterscotch , and floral  taste of spruce , malty , caramel , brown sugar , resin , tar , and hard floral hops - body is bitter , fresh , and with soft carbonation  aftertaste of hops , tar , resin , and brown sugar"
"A bold ale that is quite rounded and smooth. Sometimes Lagunitas overshoots on their offerings in regards to alcohol, hops, etc., but this one is balanced yet still flavorful."
"Imperial Red ales seem to be quite a catching phenomenon these days, beer like Rogue Santa's Private Reserve, Terrapin Big Hoppy Monster, and Lagunitas' own Imperial Red, I seem to be coming across more and more of these darker IPAs (would that make these IDAs?) lately. Another one of these beers that I spotted today was the 13th Anniversary Release from Lagunitas. The bomber was adorned with an appropriate Western style label, and it took me a minute to catch the ExAyeAyeAye pun. The beer poured out a deep shade of bronze. The body was clear, and the head was typical IPA generous. The aroma was quite hoppy with pine resin being the predominant impression. The taste was bitter and resinous with a drying hop presence. Not much of Red Ale like caramel flavor to be found here, or if there was any it was well covered over with hops. Quite a different beer than what it looked like after pouring, but a good one anyway. Hopheads everywhere should seek this out immediately."
"Overall a VERY good beer, Great flavor and big hops but the aroma puts this beer on top of many others."
"Notes: A tasty treat. This is the type of brew that would make for yearly case type purchases. Pick up a few with confidence."
"Thanks...I WILL have another."
"D: Lagunitas is stepping up their game. A lot of their beers sort of taste the same but this one stands out. I like this. Interesting that both of my favorite beers by Lagunitas are red ales."
"Such a wonderful aroma, but doesn't quite integrate with the taste. And at 8.3% this isn't one you want to keep chasing to find the taste."
"My compromise for St. Patrick's Day. This beer poured a clear red amber color and fromed a nice foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. A small amount of carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops, citrus, pine and caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops, caramel with a hint of pine. It had a medium light body and a bittersweet finish. A nice pumped up red ale that doesn't go over the top and loose it's red ale heritage."
"Mouthfeel is a little weak, but flavors more than make up for it. This begins brutally bitter, but the bitterness is quickly replaced loads of fresh fruit (grapefruit and pomegranite which were present in the nose, as well as some apple/pear). Sweetness fades into bitterness once more for the finish, which lingers with lots of citrus hoppiness. An excellent brew, which I would love them to add to their regular line-up. Alcohol is nicely masked, though you do feel a warming sensation about a quarter of the way through the bottle."
"Overall, a pretty solid beer. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: I'm a bit conflicted with this one. It's quite tasty and at around 8 percent, not totally out-of-control alcohol-wise. But at the same time, it's a pretty middle-of-the-road beer from these guys, especially for an anniversary beer. I can't complain about it, but I can't get too excited about it, either. Lagunitas may be in a bit of a rut, methinks -- I'd like to see something a bit more out there from them next year."
"Very well rounded all in all. This beer would offset Arrogant Bastard well, highly similar but probably less arrogant and definitely more complex. If it was bottle conditioned this could definitely be a good candidate for aging. Too bad."
"Big red hoppy ales have come on strong lately, and I wonder why that is? Is it a backlash against the Imperial pils? Is it a much needed, more malty repose to the ever growing number of big APA's out there? Or is it a kind of get to the heart of it and back to the roots kind of thing? I dunno, but I can say without doubt that Lagunitas has really hit the nail on the head with this one. The citrusy hops, yeasty fruitiness, and sweetish caramelish malts combine so perfectly that you'd hardly ever realize it was anything other than an average ""red"" ale. The alcohol never really stands out (although you will feel it halfway through a bomber), and it has great drinkability. They've kept the hops in-check - although it would have been very easy fro them to take them to a resinous, raspy level; and the bitterness is fine-tuned to give great balance, and nothing else. The caramelish malt is clear, but not overdone in depth or sweetness; and the hops are blended so as not to be all splashy and zesty citrusy fruit. In a way it's a bold move for Lagunitas (who are kind of known for having a bit of an aggressive edge) to have NOT gone all out with an anniversary beer - but they've done it. AND, on the label they reference a couple of guys who've done the same thing... made a beer that stands out, but embraces - and I think they're on the right track. Well-rounded, superbly balanced, remarkably drinkable!"
"22oz bomber. A furious pour leaves a rather attractive ale, clear dark copper with a lovelly eggshell/creme head thats large and creamy. very spicy hop aromas, with a good hint of fruitiness mmm tasty beer, its fully hopped ,yet very good malting mellows the raging hop a bit and leaves a nice fruity ,sweet beer, bitter finish. Very nice and smooth mouthfeel, makes avery drinkable ale for its strength. I liked this beer a lot."
"Overall: Lagunitas did it again. Simply a tasty brew with terrific drinkability. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability- This is right up there if not better than their Imperial Red and Bear Republic Red Rocket. Fine example of style. Delicious and easy to drink. Wonder how this would age for a year. Might want to taid the piggy back for a case of this stuff...which wouldn't be much as they are less than $3.50 per. A bargain if I ever saw one."
"Once again, Lagunitas has created a beer that's as complex, interesting and difficult to peg down as it is tasty. Well done!"
"The color was amber with a red hue when poured. There was a little white foam that disapated quickly. But, there was a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass from start to finish. The smell of piney hops filled the nose. To me, the taste was of a creamy piney flavor, with a nice balance of tart/bitter finish. This is a pleasant ale that was not overpowering!"
"Pours like a rocky mountain waterfall with a foamy white head. Smells like a fresh piney wet hopped brew, with pumpkin orange highlights. Big mouthfeel with sweet hoppy taste.Take a killians red and put it on HGH and that's your beer. It finishes well and leaves you snicker satisfied."
"Pours a pretty burnt umber hue with orange highlights, topped by a smallish creamy white head. Nice aroma of sharp, resinous piney hops and just a hint of sweet caramel malt. Palate is mildly sweet up front, with the hops providing contrast for a brief period mid-palate before taking over in a big way on the finish. A pleasant lingering hoppy bitterness sticks around for a while after the swallow. Body is nice and smooth. It's easy to forget this beer is as strong as it is - be careful. Dangerously drinkable."
