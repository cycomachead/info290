"On tap at the ABE airport. It’s pretty good. darker amber body. Light fruity sweet aroma. Taste was similar. More sweet tastes than fruitiness. It’s kind of like a baby Nugget Nectar."
""
""
""
""
"O: lacks the characteristic caramel note often found in ambers, but that's fine with me; I also really like the higher than usual bitterness at the end;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a fine brew definitely worth trying if to haven't had the pleasure but this isn't your normal amber."
""
"Typical amber ale. Nothing note worthy"

"maybe the best everyday Amber I have ever had.  really solid"

"Not too bad, but I would prefer less citrus hops."
""
""
""
"Beautiful beer in the glass. Deep rich copper color, small head, great carbonation. Aromas of caramel and distinct bitterness. Spicy, clean taste. Malt - forward (seems appropriate), with nice balance through the bittering hops. Medium mouth, bit of that spicy aftertaste. Mmmm. About 2 weeks old. Not super hoppy if that's your thing, but a great option for something different. Well-crafted amber."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a great gold color nose is robust and piny. The hops blend together very well balancing it out surprisingly well."
"Not very good. Bitter and less hoppy than others"
""
"Mild & smooth. A good session beer, & better then most other examples of the style."
""
""
""
"Decent hops, drinkable but not outstanding. Ok if you buy it or me"
"On tap at Troegs.  Looks pretty (clear pure color, nice head and lacing).  Other than that pretty average."
""
"Ok. Not great, not horrible. Just ok."

"Interesting take on Amber ale focusing on English hops, but with American boldness (55 IBUs) on a malty base (not in excess)."

"BOD 8/15/14.  Clear amber pour with just a hint of dark ruby.  Very nice head with exceptional lacing and very good retention.  Nice light nose of blended hops, mostly pine with herbal notes, over a somewhat dominate caramel base.  As it warms, light spicy hop notes are present.  Light medium bodied with a nice slightly oily texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  Very well balanced flavor profile with a bit of complexity and quite good intensity for an amber ale.  It begins with a blend of hop flavor that transitions to mostly pine as the bitterness begins to creep in.  Beneath all of this, is a good caramel backbone that takes center stage as the mild bitterness releases into the finish. The finish is slightly sweet over a mild pine oriented bitterness with a touch of pepper like spice."

"Overall (4.1): Its a good beer, but nothing more than that. Considering that its available just about everywhere local to me, this would be a solid go to. Nice balance between malts and hops. Can't go wrong with that!"

"O: A very enjoyable but quite hoppy amber ale - as a fan of hoppy beers I really enjoyed this take on the style. Nice complexity of flavors and aromas that is easy to drink. Definitely worth picking up if Troegs is available in your area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pure refreshment here. This brew is great for any occasion. May it be watching sports, the beach, after cutting the grass. With its sweet caramel aroma and balanced spicy,herbal hop flavor and a modest amount of bitterness. This can be an everyday beverage."
""
""
""
""
""
"Another great beer from Troegs. Smell is kind of flowery and malty. the flavor balances well with sweet maltiness and hops. I geta little lemon and some pine hop flavor. The carbonation is medium and this is a relatively lighter beer than I would have expected. Finishes nice and is very well balanced. One of the better balances I have had !!!!!!!!"

"O: This is a VERY well done amber ale. It hits on all points. Great balance, nice hop flavor and aroma, great malty backbone, and nice finish. The complexity is evident as the flavors slowly mutate throughout the sip. You can literally feel and taste the beer change changing character as you swallow. Pretty neat trick."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good amber ale which starts and ends with hoppy bitterness with a hit of malt in the middle – the hoppiness sets it apart from most amber/reds and raises the flavor profile."

"The beer is transparent with a bronze / golden body and a half inch of white head. The aroma brings piney hops, bready malts. Good flavor, with a mild sweetness to balance the robust pine component. Medium bodied with moderate bitterness. A solid beer from a fresh keg. Tasty."

"This could qualify as an ""dark-ish"" IPA based on the flavor profile. Not unlike another PA hoppy amber: Victory HopDevil (which is classified as an IPA). Some may liken it to Nugget Nectar's little brother, but it's a far cry from that beer. Still, this is a really good hoppy amber, especially fresh and on tap."
""
""
""
""
"O: Troegs delivers another solid beer with HopBack Amber Ale. While it's not outstanding to me, this one is complex and offers a lot to be enjoyed while sitting pretty with a very sessionable 6% ABV. I wouldn't buy this in excess for the sake of its enjoyment, but I'd definitely snag a 6-pack for game day with friends."

""
""
""

"A nice and enjoyable beer. My first from Tröegs and I hope after trying this one, not my last. I particularly enjoyed the way the hops stayed at the back of this beer, until the finish."

"On to the best part of all beer reviews, the taste. This brew has subtle overtones that come in waves of flavor. It was very pleasing in the mouth and finish. Overall a solid beer that I would not hesitate to enjoy again."
""
"Serving type: 1/6th Keg!!"
""
"At first sip was intrigued to feel the hit of hops mostly in the aftertaste, the back of the palate. Not disappointed at lack of sweetness which accompanies many amber or hoppy blends. Mostly disappointed that with additional sipping, what started as a hint of charcoal next began to produce more of a chalky texture effect. This was the most pronounced impression it made on me and unfortunately, if a beer doesn't finish well with me, it doesn't make me want to start over with another one."
""
""
"Overall: This is an interesting and complex amber ale."
""
""
"This is exactly what you would want from an Amber Ale, smooth and rich with just enough hops. The hop character may be too much for some, but you can still appreciate it in the flavor. The color is very appealing, and the aroma is pleasant. This brew is great on draft and in bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is really good. The look is very inviting with a ton of sediment. The smell is the best part: honey and hop. The taste is a reflection of the smell, but it's slightly less so and almost watery in comparison to how big the smell is. I would probably get this again."

"O: Without a doubt, this is one of the better brews I can get all day, every day, all the damn time at nearly every liquor store (with a half-assed craft beer selection, that is) I frequent. What else could be expected from a 5/6ths scale Nugget Nectar? I really should buy this brew more often..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, This is a super well balanced beer....very mildley hopped, and balanced perfect with sweet malt...not overly bitter, not overly sweet, just an awesome amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from trade. Thanks! Been anting to try this one for a while. Pours a deep amber bronze with a nice slightly orange white head. Aroma is sweet fruity malt and hints of grapefruit hops. Light-medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavor is mostly fruity malts with an ever so slight hop zest. Not bad but also not super exciting. Excellent BBQ beer and I suspect it would go nicely with some pulled pork."
""
""
""
""
"O - Great amber, something thats full of flavor that you could go to all year round."
"Taste starts with sweet and floral, then caramel malt, then tart citrus, with a clean crisp piney, floral, caramel finish. Mouthfeel is on the light side, a bit of creaminess and high carbonation. This amber ale is a flavorful, crisp,easy to drink beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A change for those burnt out by IPAs. Provides the hops you seek while softening the sharp, piney edges and providing a tease of malt. Hops contribution falls somewhere between an IPA and a lighter pale ale. Pretty good beer."

"Overall - This is most definitely Nugget Nectar's little cousin. Hot damn Tröegs this is great! Best amber I have ever had for sure."
""
""
""

""
""
""
"Overall - ok amber ale."
""
""
""
""

"With Nugget Nectar being a tough act to follow, Hop Back Amber is a great grab by Troegs while NN is out of season (and even when it is in season). This is an exceptionally well done amber with a distinct flavor well worthy of a purchase."
""
""
""
"O: Very drinkable! Nice balance of malt and hops. Hopback is a great alternative from heavy/aggressive Imperial or Double IPAs (not that there is anything wrong with those!!). While not a session ale at 6%, I could drink it all day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite from the pack, this was a great little ale to enjoy by the campfire. Nice mix of hops here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Haven't had a normalized amber ale this pleasant and balanced in a while. If this is the base for Nugget Nectar, then I intend to hoard those as soon as they're in season. The malts and grains are really well held together, and still allow the fruit and citrus to come through quite well. Refreshing stuff, and while not ""sessionable," I could most definitely have a bunch of these in one sitting and not complain. A winner from Tröegs once again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hopback gives this beer some great sttributes in the aroma, without overpowering the malt. Very well done."
"Appearance is burnt amber with orange and golden traces in the edges. There was a finger of head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose is lightly hoppy. The flavor profile is a well blended mix of malt and mild hops. This is the baby brother of the mighty Nugget Nectar; not bad in its own right."

"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel that's easy on the palate and makes drinking this pleasant. Closes quite dry from the hops, with moderate to heavy stickiness lingering on the palate."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer and though it will not be my first pick, it has certainly earned a place on my fall back list."
""
"Overall, this is my favorite year round brew from the Hershey boys. It's the combination of high points of different styles all poured into one glass that make it special--creamy, spicy, hoppy, deep, and just the balance of sweet and bitter. If you can't get to the brewery for the steady stream of scratch offerings, hopefully bottles of this widely distributed creature are in your neighborhood."
""
"Overall: This beer is alright. In all honesty it's not exactly my cup of tea, but I can't say it's a bad beer."
""
""
""
"Nice beer. balance between the sweet and the bitter is a little too much of a stark contrast for my palate, but good flavors seperately."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a prime example of a beer becoming a totally different animal as it warms. When I first poured it from my fridge it had a huge hop flavor. As it got nearer to room temperature the hops gave way to sweet fruity malts. Another solid offering from Troegs"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear orange amber with 2 fingers of light foam that fell off quickly to some picturesque splotchy rings of lace. Nose is mild and cheerful with gentle citrus, floral hops and a generous, forward malt presence. The malt profile kept expanding as the beer warmed. Hearty bready biscuit, round and toasted, then honey toffee sweetness. It’s slightly whimsical how all that strong malt character gently kisses the bright grassy hops. Taste is perfection. Smooth, light, lively; moderate for all it’s malt backbone. Deeply flavorful. Succulent hops finish dry but not really too bitter with a slick mouth coating and a little pine. This is an enticing amber with plenty of character that you could happily drink all day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into becker pint glass. Clear darker amber with a medium-thin white head that fades a bit into a tight disc of foam on top of the beer. Smells of sweet caramel malts and floral/fruity hops. Slight hint of piney hop bitterness, but not much. As the head continues to diminish it leaves tons of lacing. Taste is lots of clean, bready crackery malts, with some sweet fruity hops and a tiny pinch of bitterness at the very end for a nice crisp finish. Awesomely drinkable, another winner from Troegs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I find this beer exceptional! I would recommend it as a crossover into hoppy beers as it is delightfully easy to drink and whets the hop appetite as well. A solid 4.25 is due for this beer!"

"What a fantastic drinkable beer. Great flavor with hops and the crystal malt sweetness."
""
""
""
""
"Very nice and simple amber ale. Brownish amber in color, with a somewhat aggressive pour giving a large, healthy white head that retained nicely. Caramel malts in the nose, with a good dose of crisp piney/citrusy hops. Taste was similar, more complex than your typical amber ale, even if nothing surprising going on; bready malts, caramel, nice hop bite with notes of pine and citrus pith, for a good sense of balance. Light-medium body, crisp and enjoyable, and about as spot-on for the style as you can get."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a great example of a red ale. The hops could throw some off but could be a gateway for hoppier styles as well. It's fairly balanced in my opinion and isn't just a sweet malt bomb."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an easy drinking beer that would go great with a meal or to drink on a snowy winters night."
""
""
""
"Overall: a solid offering and a good start to checking out a different brewery. tasty and well crafted. hope to get my hands on some more Troegs while on the east coast. Wish Nugget nectar was available too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good balance of flavoring hop and malt character for the style. Avoids being cloyingly sweet and overly bitter."

"Troeg's is quite the brewery, and they're on the right track with this one!"

"O: A nice amber with great balance. Plenty of flavor as well as ease of drinkability. One of the better year-round ambers out there"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew is an easy to go to if its a available by you. Might seem strong but it's the hops that seem a bit too much, my opinion it's just fine. Salud."
""
""
"Still a solid reliable beer. A good starting point. if you wanna get someone into craft. Worked for me."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid amber. Got to love their spring lineup beers."
"Smell was slight and more malt forward than I expected, sharpened by the obvious hop presence. Taste is where this beer shines, nice hop bite and floral notes, very fresh tasting and finishing dry. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice carbonation that seem appropriate for this beer. A great tasting beer, will be having more by Tröegs."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very nicely carbonated, smooth-flowing beer with a good, crisp bite to it. The body is medium but there's a brightness and a sort of cleanness to it as well, and a sort of stickier (think hop resin) feel to it that really works in this case."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is easy drinking and quite flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"One of the best straight-up amber ales out there, hands down. The color is perfect, the malt profile is perfect, the hops could be just a touch stronger in my mind, but that might just be my DIPA-ish tendencies. It won't blow your mind, but if you appreciate ambers, you will love this!"

"Pours a brown to amber color with a good finger or two of head initially. Head scales back to a nice thin layer on top of this brew. Good lacing. Smells of piney hops. Flavor is more of the same piney hops but then is well balanced with a dark per malt sweetness. Bitter to start but sweet to finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"is an American Amber- it tastes somewhat like an IPA."
""
"O: this is a solid hoppy amber ale, nicley balanced with a hint of sweetness and breadiness. Nothing over the top, just a tasty drinkable brew."
"edit: consistency and perhaps freshness is an issue in new york state. some bottles have a sort of blah red mat thing going on, others are like a slice of cold fresh ripe pink grapefruit. its insane how different each can be, so if you get an average one, keep on trying. even in the same pack, its insane. when they are good, they are great!"
""
""
"Hope to have this again, it was a real pleasure. One of the better ambers I've tried. More hops than usual, and a bit more IPA hoppy pine-ness pervades this beer, but with the plentiful roast malt the balance is quite good, seek this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"D - A good beer. Never had this before and I would get it again. A well crafted East Coast IPA. I think I prefer it to Smuttynose and Dogfish Head's IPAs, in fact."
""
""
""
"Bottled on 092612"
""
"O-I like this beer. It's an IPA. There's no amber/red to it...not in the taste, nose, or even color. It's enjoyable and refreshing though...a nice easy drinking midday ale."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice amber color with a 2 finger head. Not much smell on this one, but plenty of tastiness... It has a nice hop presence that is balanced with a good malt backbone. Just the right amount of carbonation helps this one go down nice and easy. I think I'll have another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is good. The scent of the brew is really the only average characteristic of the beer. Worth a try as an easy to drink, low ABV (6%) IPA."
""
""
""
"O- Excellent beer. My current favorite amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was really impressed with the beer on-tap: while it isn't different it is a better version of the bottled version I know well (I probably buy 1.5-2 cases total per year). The feel is superior to most any amber ale you could pick up, and the hoppiness stresses the resinous and pine character over the citrus qualities, although both are there. It's a great beer either way."

"All around this is a good beer. I like the way it comes forward. Good job by Troegs."
""
""
""
"Overall, a delicious amber that is somewhat hampered by mouthfeel. It seems like everything is there then all of a sudden, mouthfeel just drops off into a watery nothingness. That aside, I would most definitely seek this out."
""
""

"O: well, this was definitely better than what I posted in my ""hads"" list. I would definitely have this again and am wishing Troeg's would send to New England. Until then, I just need to visit my parents more until I can get this in Maine."
"overall one of my favorites, from the front of the pallet to the back This one is exceptional on every level. if your just getting into beer this I'd a good one to try if you're not sure about hops yet in your pallets specific journey, this amber encapsulates in my opinion one of the best balances between residual sugars and hop complexion. never had an amber now is the tome for this one!"

"D - Not bad, the hop aroma is nice but doesn't quite come out as well in the flavor profile. The malt is a little too dry for my taste but not overly harsh."

"Amber ales simply do not get much better than this. Most of the amber ales I find tend to be more balanced, malty, and conservative. This one proves that these beers can be really interesting and exciting for those of us who dig the hop. Nugget Nectar's little brother is definitely worth your time. Nicely done Troegs!"

"This one has a nice reddish body with a thick finger white head that lays down the glass leaving nice sticky foam on the side of the glass. The smell is very nice of malty, caramel aromas. The taste has a very inviting hop bitterness to it, with nice malt chararstics to it. Its mouth feel is really nice and rolls off the tongue really nice. Overall a really drinkable and enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Clearly needs to be much fresher. I'd love to try it again within a month of the bottling date. Outside of that, still a good beer."
"Overall: this is a good and satisfying amber. Not usually my style, but the brewers have toned down the biscuity malt character and come up with a nicely refreshing recipe. I would have this again."

"Worth trying but, again, not outstanding."

"Overall (4.5/5): Hopback really was a very pleasant surprise–I wasn't really expecting such great hop flavor from an amber ale, but boy, does Hopback bring it. Tröegs did a great job with this refreshing take on an amber ale. Now that I've tried it, I'll have to seek it out. Yes, most people are drinking wheat beers, saisons, and IPAs during the warmer months, but I honestly think Tröegs Hopback should get consideration, despite its being an amber since it's nice and light and features a refreshingly juicy hop bite. Highly recommended."

"Poured on cask and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, crystal clear, ruby copper coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white head. Aromas of rich caramel malt and a subtle, wet hops to balance. Flavors are resiny hops and dark, sweet, roasted caramel on the forward tongue blended masterfully together. Roasty and smooth throughout. Bitter and slick aftertaste, with a roasty and resiny feel. Great lacing along the glass as you drink. The smooth, rich body leaves a resiny, slightly bitter finish. Solid beer."
""
"Overall this one is very balanced, and hugely complex in the flavor department. Some of the hop flavor and aroma is hard to nail down for me. It verges on citrus and some of the more west coast hop flavors, but is definitely defined more by the herbal/grassy component. Very drinkable and very complex... not bad."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a copper amber color with a very small head that dissipates quickly, but leaves lacing on the glass. Smells more of floral hops than grain, but definitely a darker roasted grain present. Tastes of dark roasted grain and definite hop bite, sweet earthy hops, similar to some IPAs. Goes down smooth, good light-medium body, however, a tad overcarbonated. Overall, a very good beer."

"It's a fetching copper color, with a decent head. Nothing to balk at, but nothing crazy either. The nose felt a little week, especially compared to flavor, though the nose opened up a little as it got warmer. Consider the toasty quality of the malt and refreshingly floral nature of the taste, I'm surprised the nose isn't better. I eally like the mouthfeel on this one, the overall impression I got from it is a little bit less enthusiastic. That said, this is my second beer from Tröegs, and I'm still impressed. I would definitely have it again."

"Another brew from my trade with Hudak, thanks man! Poured to pint glass the beer is a brilliant clear amber color. Nice 2 finger head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is a mix of caramel sweetness and fruity hop character. Apples and pears are in the mix along with a hint of citrus tone. The flavor follows suit and is a very enjoyable blend of caramel malt sweetness and fruity hop flavors, same as found in the nose. Medium bitterness. Finishes crisp and clean with a lingering fruity hop resin on the tongue. Very nice. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, well representing the style in a hop-forward fashion. Highly recommended."

""

"I really like this brew as I do all fresh hop tasting varieties, but for the style, I was expecting much more malt and lingering sugars. I was not expecting this much of a fresh-hop style finish."
""
""
""
"O-Having this and SA Tasman Red IPA, this beer is able to balance the hops and malt well. They are not in conflict but rather work together."
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours with a short head that recedes very quickly. Leaves a few spots of lacing. The color is somewhere between dark orange and brown. Aroma is kind of dull. There are some nice floral notes, and some pleasant caramel, but it is kind of just dull and unremarkable. The caramel is much nicer in the flavor, with a bit of nice spicy hop profile. There is also a nice mild grapefruit citrus note. Mouthfeel is medium-light and is a bit light on carbonation. I do really like this beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but nothing super special."
"Overall, what we enjoyed best about this brew was how malty, strong, and filling it was. The end of the flavoring, however, became a bit muddled, making the finish bite more than desired. The hops could have been more forward, which could have balanced the deepness of the malts and the bittering phenols."
""
""
""

"O - Really refreshing. Great taste, great smell, and low abv make this a great beer to drink. You definitely want to drink a few of these in a session."
""
""
"Golden brown ale with a foamy head. Aromas of light citrus, caramel and bread. Creamy, fruit-mostly apple-flavor up front and mild citrus bitterness in the aftertaste. It's perfectly balanced between creamy and thin. This is a great beer! It's very unique and enjoyable."
""
"Crisp, refreshing, and very drinkable. I’d very much enjoy a sixer or a couple pints while watching the playoffs this weekend. This is a style I don’t see much about and, given its broad definition, I bet there’s a lot of room for variation and innovation amongst amber ales. Not too flashy but it's an A for sure. This is a brew is called HopBack but, really, it’ll make you give it up for the malts."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a pretty clear amber/orange color with a creamy one finger head, solid retention and lacing. It smells like citrusy hops and maybe a little bit like raspberry. The taste is superbly balanced- medium bodied with overtones of hops and a clean dry finish. The mouthfeel is perfect for this style- well carbonated and very refreshing. Especially for the price, this is a fantastic beer. I plan on drinking it more frequently."
""
"Hopback Amber holds a nice moderate level of carbonation and body, making it easy to drink and quite delightful."
"Overall- A solid flagship ale, it's one of the beers I tried early on that convinced me craft was the way to go. I've since found others I like more (Including this one's big brother, Nugget Nectar, which is sadly still a seasonal.) but this is always a great fallback. Hopefully Troegs is around for a long, long time to continue showing everyone how it's done."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-fantastic beer, well balanced but still very hoppy. First time having this one but will reach for it again and again. I am familiar with the process of using a hop back and that is why I picked it up and I was not disapointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm ready for more. I love a 6.0 that drinks like 4.5."
""
""
"O: Troegs says this is their signature beer; it is fantastic. Great balance of hops, which are very hoppy but smooth and mellow. Great balance with hops and malt. The touch of sweetness gives a great point of contrast to the hops. Will buy this whenever I see it."
"O- Simple but unique. The combination of caramel malts with a heavy hop presence is delicious."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet to the taste. Immediately you get a nice hoppy bite, not too strong, slighty citrus malt taste. Smooth dry finish. The bite on the hops didn't seem as prominant, its smoothed out by the sweet malt flavor. Still a bit of a bitter hop after tast but I really enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
"Overall its a nice beer, and I would have again."
""
""
"This is one of my old standbys. It is relatively local (about an hour from where I live/70 miles) and it is abundant in this area. It is a great flavored ale and a well crafted beer. Troeg's does not make a mistake when they claim this as their flagship beer."

""
"The sweetness becomes a little much by the end of the bottle, but the hops are intense and add some bitterness as well as some complexity that keeps you interested. I've had this before and try to get more any time I'm in PA."

"I'm not much for adjectives.."
""
""
""
"I can see why this gets great reviews time and time again. Its tastey..sweet like an amber, but hoppy like an IPA. Nice marriage of the two... and makes a very nice overall beer. It's not over hoppy, but enough to warrant the giant hop on the bottle. Very good unique session IPA."
""
""
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. I've had fresher bottles many times before but this one held up pretty well. This is a solid go to beer that doesn't have much hype but is one you could drink everyday without a complaint."

""

""
""
"O: A great beer that I will be revisiting often. Perfect for the warmer months of spring and great for carrying through the summer. Crisp, refreshing, flavorful with just the right touch of sweetness."
"Some noted flavors are caramel, toffee, citric and floral hops. Great beer with some serious drinkability. Awesome dizzying amount of balance as well."
"Overall very drinkable and tasty amber, with satisfying amount of hops."
"A great example of a balanced and easy drinking american ale that is still flavorful and complex. I wish more breweries could pull this off."
"Full bodied for the style with an excellent balance of earthy, bitter hops and sweet malt flavors.  Hops are prominent with a dry and bitter piney, grassy presence that lingers into a dry finish.  Countered by hints of caramel, rye, toffee and biscuit.  Flavorful, well balanced and very quaffable.  "
"I had this before -- never on cask -- the flavors seem a little muted but still tasty on cask. Worth the experience if you can get it on cask."
"Good overall brew, I wish I could find it in Florida!"
"Glad to have tried. Troegs makes some pretty good stuff. A freshly hopped hand pump version of this brew would probably raise the score a few notches for me."
"Pours a very slightly cloudy brownish-amber. A light tan heads sticks well. Smell is pleasant, floral hops. Fresh. Taste is a nice blend of yeasty, doughy backbone and forward, yet mild, hops. Feel is smooth and a bit flat. Finishes a tiny bit spicy. I like it - more of a ""hop forward"" amber ale.."
"Nice dark red and caramel color. It is clear. Pours an abundant head that loves to stick the whole way down. Smells of some citrus hops with a little spiciness to it. Also can smell the underlying maltiness. A nice solid hop aroma with floral qualities. Tastes a little orange citrus with some spiciness and earthiness as well. Good solid bitterness is balanced with sweet caramel malt flavor. The sweetness and the hops go very well together. Full bodied creamy mouthfeel with smooth carbonation. This is a solid beer and a staple for Troegs. I pick this up every so often during the nugget nectar down season."
"Overall: What more can I say? This is a very good hoppy amber. Think of it as Nugget Nectar's little cousin. Solid stuff and I will definitely be getting this again!"
"VERY GOOD, SEEK IT OUT!"
"Overall, a great beer to come home to. Thank you Mr. Troeg."
"O: A very well crafted Amber Ale with the hop-head in mind. Beautifully balanced, refreshing and easy drinking. This is excellent for when you want to take a break from the massive amount of IPAs flooding the market. Thank you Troegs for putting the barley back into hoppy beers! SCREW YOU WEST COAST!"
"O: I haven't had many Amber/Red Ales, but this I definitely say is very good. Would've liked it to have a bit more hoppiness, but I guess that's par for the course."
"O: This is a good everyday beer. Refreshing with a good taste."
"D - expecting a bit more hops than i tasted which left me wanting for a bit more; not bad but have had better in the style; butter flavor confused me a bit"
"O: Looks great, smells great. I love the subtle earthy hop flavor, and the malt does not take a back seat. Very smooth and drinkable too. One of my favorites."
"O: Another good beer by Troegs. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries."
"O: Very tasty Amber Ale and something I would buy on a regular basis if it was available in my area. Everything balances out here and makes for a tasty and enjoyable experience."
"O: not especially interesting. I wanted more hops. 3.5"
"Overall a good amber ale. I hope I can try a fresh one soon."
"Pours a sappy orange color that darkens to a deep amber as the glass fills. An off-white head develops that quickly recedes to bubbles, leaving some wet, soapy lacing behind. Smells of caramel, floral hops, and faint sugar. Tastes of pepper, faint citrus, caramel, and some piney hops towards the rear. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that is amply carbonated. Overall, a solid amber that I rather enjoyed."
"This beer pours a reddish copper color with about one finger of off white head. the smell is floral and citrusy hops with a little bit of caramel toffee sweet malts. the flavor is pretty close, but the hops take the back seat to the malt character and the finish is a little bitter. the mouthfeel is medium light to medium bodied with good carbonation and a smooth finish. overall a very good beer."
"Big grapefruit presence along with toasted malt in the nose. Intense bitterness and explosive graprefruit flavor cut through the robust toasted malt body. Lingering graininess in a dry finish that really allows the hops to dish the punishment on the way down the hatch. This beer surpised the heck outta me. Everybody gets fired up over Nugget Nectar (a fine brew to be sure), but there's a pretty badass year-round substitute available from the same brewery."
"Overall probably my favorite out of the pack. I really like the work the Tröegs Bros do."
"Overall - This is a very solid beer in a style that I think has potential but frequently misses the mark. I really like hoppy reds and Hopback is a great year-round standard for the style."
"Pretty stellar all around, and what seems like a standard for American red ales. Great price for a 6-pack."
"I am very impressed with this beer..I enjoy it almost as much as it's big brother..Nugget Nector..this is a MORE drinkable version of it..."
"Overall - A great sessionable amber, I'd say. I generally like my beers to be pretty all out intense with flavor, but this one is a great example that subtle does the trick sometimes. This was a great offering that I enjoyed. If you like a good amber/red and you can get a hold of it, give this one a try."
"O: Nice American amber, highly drinkable, I would definitely have more of this!"
"O - Excellent beer, and really went beyond my expectations. HopBack in a bottle is usually solid, but the cask conditioning totally put it over the top. Very unique and refreshing."
"O - this is a harty beer and the name describes the hopiness it comes back on you for a lovely summer beer."
"Overall, very well done amber ale, you come away with a hop flavor and scent but the balance of the caramel malt makes it that amber ale."
"a solid amber ale, maybe a little more hoppier than the usual for the style, but thats always welcomed for many. a great brewery that knows how to make a great hoppy beer, id recommend this."
"Not a bad beer, I just think it's confused, and a bit asymmetrical on the palate. But drinkable."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This beer has wonderful flavors balanced and very easy to drink. I really enjoy drinking this beer."
"Very drinkable, and my comments about the lack of mindblowing flavour shouldn't mask the fact that this is a very well made and enjoyable beer. A tasty drop that would be relatively sessionable, even for 6% ABV."
"On tap, head, nose and appearance are all fantastic."
"Pours an amber red color body with a quickly dissipating head. The aroma is of floral hops and malts. The taste is well balanced between the caramel malts and the crisp hops. I enjoyed this beer thoroughly, this is a very solid amber ale."
"Bottled on May 13, 2011. Amber red in color with an orange hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a short, off-white head that reduced to a wispy cap. Nice lacings on the glass. Caramel malt aromas with floral and citrus hops and a hint of biscuit. Medium bodied and a bit oily with assertive carbonation. Floral and citrus hop flavors up front that slowly taper from beginning to end. Sweet caramel malt flavor is solid throughout with a hint of bready, biscuit beneath. Finishes semi-dry with a sweet malty and bitter floral hop character."
"This was a confusing review for me. Poured a nice bright amber, some lacing, head recedes quickly. Scent is awry. Smells almost salty. I mean hops is there but really salty. The thing is, I think it tastes really good. Caramel malts, and hops, not overly bitter and balanced, really drinkable. Overall, Very nice beer scent withstanding."
"M. Sweet. Goes down easy, a bit of carbonation to help it go down. Flavor sticks with you but does not overwhelm."
"O-great beer. More if a pale ale than amber ale due to hops. Quality offering from Toegs."
"O - Overall, this is another good one from Troegs. A very drinkable and tasty amber."
"O: This is a great amber ale. Full of maltigoodness but just the right amount of hoppiness to balance it out."
"D - I guess if you can't get Nugget Nectar but want a hint of that glory, you'd have one of these. It's a good brew but pretty ""safe""."
"Overall I think of this beer as Nugget Nectar's little brother, but it's still a good beer on it's own for when NN is out of season. The first time I ever had this beer was on draft and it was a lot more amazing than in a bottle. I'd love to try it again on tap if I could ever find it."
"Very tasty stuff!! I enjoyed it greatly. I will admit that I thought it would slant more towards the hop end because of the name, but I was still pleasantly surprised."
"overall a solid beer i could drink this baby in the heat of summer or the dead of winter it doesn't matter its just a great beeri"
"Overall: Even though this beer wouldn't be classified as sessionable, I would drink this beer over and over again. It's light enough to do that, yet loaded with enough flavor to really make this an attractive brew."
"O: Generally, both likeable and easy-drinking... seemingly session-worthy despite a 6% abv . Not doing back-flips over this (nor do I usually for this style), but it's a nice version and it disappeared *remarkably* quickly."
"A good brew. It feels more substantial than it looks"
"This is a solid beer that follows suit with other Tröegs beers I’ve had. The extra hoppiness was certainly a bonus here. I noticed the same surprise in Tröegs’ Pale Ale."
"The Hopback appears to be a cousin to Nugget Nectar, not as hoppy or citrusy yet extremely delicious. For being a basic Amber Ale, this is very well done."
"Medium body, nicely carbonated, sticky and bitter on the tongue. Drinks really well, sessionable at 6% (IMO), and an excellent balance of malt and hops. This was one of my favorite beers when I first got into craft and it remains today."
"O/D-Pretty good. I would consider buying another 6 pack. Maybe a bit fresher would make this one come to life on the palate more. But I love the style, and I love Troegs. No Nugget Nectar, but that goes for most beers. Happy with the results."
"Medium amber with thick, dens off white head that sticks to the sides. Citrus hop aroma. Medium sweet maltiness that finishes well with a spicy floral hop bite (but not a huge hop bite). Bit heavier mouthfeel. I had to give this a lower drinkability due to the malty heaviness. That's not a bad characteristic but I would have a hard time with more than two of these."
"Overall a very good amber. I enjoyed it and would drink it again."
"Troegs is a dependable brewery and this is a consistently good beer. It is a bright amber color. I would not call this a red ale at all. It is an amber that has a strong hop character but not overwhelming in IBUs and is not bitter. It also has a musky hint in the feel and flavor that I like very much. It smells lovely with a hint of blooming flowers and has a unique thing about it that makes me keep coming back. Maybe it's a pinch of spice or something...."
"D: Quite drinkable. This is a balanced, smooth, ale with a lot of flavor, none of which is ""overwhelming"". Very repeatable."
"Poured into a tumbler, the beer has a reddish/amber body with an off-white/ecru colored head, about a finger deep that descends pretty quickly. Decent lacing on the glass. Very sweet smelling with a good, but not overwhelming hop smell. There's a caramel-like sweetness in the malt and is very supportive to the hop-flavor in the beer. Well balanced on the sweeter side if that's not too contradictory for you. Velvety mouthfeel with a well hidden ABV. Easy drinking, especially at the perfect serving temperature. Love."
"Hopback was refreshing, easy to drink and delicious. I'm looking forward to trying it poured into a pint glass so I can ge more aroma from it, but I would recommend it to anyone."
"It has a nice smoothness across the tongue with a hint off resinous character coating the tongue. A nice beer to stake your name on.. oh wait, they do!"
"Overall: Wish I had gotten a hold of this sooner, this is really great. This is the type of beer I can see having in my fridge on a regular basis. Fairly low ABV, fantastic flavor, and great drinkability. A winner, in my book. Excellent balance."
"This is a very satisfying amber with a spicy hop profile and substantial mouthfeel."
"O- This is still a good beer. Maybe I had a slightly subpar bottle, but it was still an enjoyable drink. It sits heavy on the palate which hurts the drinkability. It is so well balanced it might actually detract from its flavor profile. Very drinkable."
"I freaking loved this brew."
"This brew poured out as a clean crisp looking amber color with a thin cream colored head. The smell of the beer is hoppy and slightly sweet. It's a good mix of citrus and sugar. The taste is about half the hoppiness of the Nugget Nectar. This is a more standard drinking beer for a more common drinker. Regardless it's still got a good flavor to it and it's a quality Amber Ale for sure. The mouthfeel is carbonated, and medium bodied. Overall I'd prefer the Nugget Nectar but this is a pretty decent alternative."
"O: This is a very nice beer. Nothing is overpowering, and between the caramel malt but distinct but not overpowering hops, this has something everyone can enjoy."
"O: The sweetness impedes drinkabilty, although the maltiness pairs well with spicy food. I would be interested in trying this beer when fresher, even though I wouldn't expect a beer billed as an amber ale to pass its prime in slightly over than a month."
"O- Troegs never disappoints me, and this is another example of a really good beer out of their brewery. Highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of the style."
"O: Overall it is a pretty good beer. I think I was expecting too much after having Troegs Nugget Nectar (one of my favorites) but this was a pretty good substitute. A very different flavor than the NN - but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Cheers!"
"This is a very sessionable well balanced beer with good flavoring yet not over the top. Copper clear color with 2 finger head. Perhaps the one I bought wasn't fress as I didn't notice much hop aromas but the taste was a nice blend of hop, spice, pine notes. This tastes like it would be a great beer to pair with seafood or New England style cuisine. I had it with Chinese and it held its own, but I really could picture myself drinking this beer in a rustic raw bar somewhere downing some mussels, clam chowder or oysters with it. Troegs makes another fine product."
"On a side note, I'm really glad I got this fresh; I had a chance to taste this at beerfest in AC and I could tell they were serving a very old batch of hopback. It was completely lacking hop flavor and almost skunky."
"OA: A fine brew, not as intense or intricate as it's older sibling Nugget Nectar, but available year round."
"O - The red headed step child to Nugget Nectar. Solid beer that will do, is nice to find in a mixed 12 pack once or twice a year"
"D= Very sessionable in the sense that the ABV and flavor profile were not over the top. That being said, a beer called ""Hopback"" should have a bit more pronounced hop character. Especially in the hop flavor department. The astringency issue was distracting also. Not a bad beer, but it could be made better for sure."
"Overall: Fairly good beer and I might buy again in the future."
"O: solid beer from a local brewery. I wouldn't skip over it."
"Overall this is a great beer, glad I got a fresh bottle (bottled within the last six weeks) I would defiantly pick this up again if I have the chance."
"O - this beer is very good. An aggressively hopped amber, but a well balanced one at that. I like the fact that despite this amped up approach, it's worthy of a session label. Truly an IPA lovers' Amber Ale."
"O- Was a little disappointed with this brew, I have yet to try Nugget Nectar, I have heard so many good things from Troegs, and I must say I was disappointed with my first beer from them, very easy drinkability, but nothing really special about this beer."
"Overall this is a good beer. It is very similar in flavor to Nugget Nectar, but the flavors and character are not as prominent as in its Imperial Amber Ale cousin. Aside from the slightly bitter aftertaste, the beer is well balanced and one of the tastier amber ales that I have had."
"O - A pleasant amber hopped ale. Nice for a few bottles."
"Pours with a thick white head & sticky lacing. Definitely amber in color, with excellent clarity. Picking up some mild malty notes, but mostly hops on the nose. Taste is pretty balanced between malt & hops with medium body. Overall, it's a pretty drinkable beer & reminds me of Nugget Nectar, but without the malt & hops presence of its big brother. It would make a great lawnmower beer."
"O: Almost like nugget nectar light. Really happy I grabbed this one and that it is available all year long."
"Overall a drinkable beer but I was expecting it to be a bit more crisp and tasty."
"Hop flavors are intense, yet controlled with enjoyable citrus and pine blasts. I enjoyed this beer with some sharp cheese and crackers, providing a nice complement to each other."
"Served from a bottle, reddish amber in color. Nice aroma with hoppy overtones. Smooth, balanced flavor, with a nice compliment of hops. This was a pleasant surprise. Not too expensive, but high quality flavor. Would definitely drink again. And again."
"another solid brew created by a solid brewery."
"Overall-I have heard a lot about this beer, so I think it would be hard to exceed my expectations. The beer seems out of balance to me. Spicy nugget hops seem to clash with the other hops and the malt. Would like to see some crystal malt notes/flavor as well. Overall, not a bad beer. Enjoyable. Experience improves as the beer warms. Not my favorite amber, would be better if the nugget hops were substitituted for a different hop."
"Beautiful crystal clear amber color. Aromas of roasted and sweet malt, earthy grains, and a slight citrus hop profile. This is a very pleasant drinking and well-balanced ale that begins with a solid, sweet malt flavor and follows with a dry hop finish."
"O: Great beer that's smooth & easy to drink. Definitely worth getting some if you see it. Almost reminded me of a maltier/sweeter Nugget Nectar."
"Overall this is a great amber. It does a good job highlighting both flavors of the malt and the hops. If more breweries made ambers like Troegs I think they would be a more popular beer style."
"O-Overall a solid offering. I like this very much. Would definitely drink this again."
"D - Very drinkable. Excellent hop and malt blend and a very nice malt profile. Very crisp and refreshing while still having really nice flavors."
"D: A good beer to have one or two of, but less than sessionable."
"A good beer, would recommend. Thanks Andy!"
"O - Nothing worng with this at all. It is a great offering from Troegs. But if you like this, then you will probably love Nugget Nectar even more."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours clear orange-amber color with a fairly dense 2 finger off white head with very good retention. Awesome looking glass lacing. Aromas of caramel, grapefruit, pine, and some light orange peel. Taste of a lot of grapefruit, with caramel, orange peel, and pine flavors. Malty on the front, with a decent amount of bitterness present on the finish. Overall very well balanced, bitterness and malts are pretty much equal. Alcohol was not noticed at all, except for a very small warming after the finish. Medium carbonation and body. This was extremely drinkable. My glass disappeared pretty fast. I would definitely pick up a 6 pack of this for a nightly session, and it is also very widely available around me. Overall a tasty and easy going amber ale. Excellent."
"Pours a dark amber with a one-finger off-white head. Not much lacing or retention. Aroma of hints of citrus and caramel malt. Nothing stands out too much. Sweet flavor profile. Sweet bread malt, caramel, hints of subdued dark fruits and amber creaminess. Hops are pushed aside, but hints of citrus and pine can be found deep in the beer. A bit of a toasted vibe as well. Refreshing and subtle, wish the flavor was a bit stronger."
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 02/18/11. Pours a dark amber color with a thin ring of head. Aroma is of floral, spicy hops. Slightly bready as well as a caramel aroma. Taste is more of the floral hops, a lot of the floral hops. A bit bready with a metallic aftertaste. Rather heavy mouthfeel to this one. Overall this is a very floral, hoppy beer. Pretty good beer for being in a mix 12 pack. Certainly worth buying on its own."
"Very good! My first try and a lucky extra from a recent trade [thanks Chase2634]... A hoppy lookin' golden amber... Great nose... poured very smoothly with a little lacing left behind.. Great mouthfeel...Sweet..bready..malty..hoppy..a good mixture..Definitely one of the better hoppy ambers I've had!"
"Wow. Had this on tap at Quality Meats in Manhattan this January. Looks great and smells good, but what impressed me was that I liked the sweetness so much. I don't usually go for too much sweet, but the kind of sweetness here has bread, some fruit, and is not in the least bit perfumey. Balance that with great hops and you have a beer that's fun to drink - not too bitter, not mild either. Definitely among my favorites. I look forward to trying it in a bottle, as well as giving the Nugget Nectar a try."
"Very clear deep amber, with about 1/2 inch head, which quickly dissipated. Very little lacing. Aroma and initial taste were above average, but I didn't care much for the finish. Mouthfeel was a little oily, with soft carbonation. Initial taste was better than the finish, one was enough for me."
"I'm a huge fan of Nugget Nectar and I've heard of this beer referred to as it's little brother (a spot on assessment, imo). Deep amber base with 1 to 1.5 fingers of off white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is very similar to NN with just a little less hop and fruit (citrus, apricots). Taste is fantastic, very similar to the smell. Mouthfeel and drinkability are spot on. If you love NN, but want something you can throw back more of, try this brew. Might be my new ""always on hand"" brew."
"D - good enough to drink but the malts might wear on you after a while"
"D: Ok."
"D- I'll be coming back to this one for sure. Next time i'll get a pack."
"D: A super hopped amber ale. I like it, maybe even more than Nugget Nectar. Well, maybe not, but this is a pretty good drinking beer that I must thank Josh again for getting me!"
"D- Very drinkable. Has a good flavor with the drinkability of a light lager. I would recommend this one."
"D: As stated above, this beer is too much to drink too many. Just too heavy for sessionability."
"D: Pretty good session beer, I could see myself drinking a couple in a row without getting tired of the flavors."
"In the end, HopBack is almost Nugget Nectar light. This isn't to diminish HopBack, it's a nice tasting, well balanced beer that can be enjoyed year round."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite drinkable. I thought there would be more floral and amber-type notes associated with the taste, so I was a little disappointed in that aspect. Tastes more like a pale ale than an amber lager."
"smell nice and hoppy with some citrus"
"All in all, a good ale from Troegs. Definitely worth a try."
"D - Very easy to down and extremely refreshing. This beer is so easy to drink, I just want more and more. Could use some more hop, but it's definitely a great alternative to it's brother Nugget Nectar. If you spend your time wishing you could find NN, just try the Hopback, you won't be disappointed."
"Very easy to drink. Through my many travels, I have to say that the great state of Pennsylvania has some of the finest craft breweries in the States, hands down. Maybe it is something in the water, but the folks of PA know how to make some fine beer. Cheers to Troegs."
"This is however, very easy drinking, and enjoyable for good drinkability"
"D: very drinkable. hard to tell this is a 6%'er. could easily drink quite a few of these. with amber's being all over the road i would say this is a very drinkable, middle of the road version."
"Edit- had another one and smelled awesome, same as described earlier but more prominent"
"D-Not a huge fan of amber ales, but I think Troegs made one I would drink more often if available in CT. Enjoyed this one a quite bit."
"This is very drinkable brew. Not to high of a ABV, so I could certainly do a few of these in an evening without to much of a problem. A great brew to have, and even better that its found in one of Troegs Sampler packs. So I will definity go for one of these again. A very nice Amber by Troegs."
"D - Very drinkable. One of my go-to beers when I'm not sure what to get at the local store."
"Highly drinkable, I can see this being a good gateway beer for those new to the craft scene and not big hop heads. I found it big on hop flavour and aroma, but with a substantial malt backbone that canceled out any major bitterness."
"Appearance is amber with a small white head. Hopback smells of hops, malt, pine. It tastes fairly sweet, caramel, hops are present in taste as well, some citrus too. All in all, this beer tastes very nice. MF is medium bodied. Drinkability is good, a couple of this go well with some chicken or on their own."
"Drinkability was just fine. It's a very potent beverage, so it's certainly not a bad thing it doesn't rate higher in this category."
"D: Good."
"Great brew right here. Pours nice amber color with a decent amount of head and while there is not much to say for the lacing down the glass, it still has some nice hop flavors. Starts a little bitter and a touch dry but rounds out pretty nice. Hop flavor is prominent but not at all overpowering which I like in this kiind of brew. This is for sure something I would be drinking on a beach in the summer. Light citrus flavors are also present but again very well balanced. So if you light a medium bodied hoppy (but not over hopped) brew, this one is just what youve been looking for."
"D - Definitely easy to drink, especially considering 6% alcohol level"
"drinkability: unsure what the age it but I bet this is even hoppier when fresh. This may not be that fresh."
"It goes down easily enough, and if it weren't for this lingering metallic flavoring, I'd love this beer."
"D: Everything balances extremely well in this beer but nothing stands out as extremely memorable. the bitterness of the hops really balance out the malt sweetness. This feels like a great session beer to just hang out and relax. more body than your typical session beer, though."
"D: One of the best flagship amber ales I've had to date. Troegs Hopback is very well-crafted and it pays lots of attention to its hops. The 6% ABV is a nice little bump that is virtually undetected amongst its rich, caramel malt sweetness balanced with the fresh, leafy hop bitterness. I would certainly get it again."
"D - Pretty enjoyable and easy to drink session beer. Good stuff, would drink it again and enjoy."
"D - an very sessionable and food friendly beer. I will be buying more of this in the summer when I like a lower alcohol, refreshing ale."
"pretty good, however this beer is hard to get in Indiana. I had my aunt bring it from PA. Very drinkable and sessionable however."
"D: Very drinkable and delicious. They go down really smooth. A great brew IMO"
"I was surprised by this beer. Nice clear ruby red color with little head that fizzles out quickly. Aroma is of juicy, spicy, and piney hops and there is a distinct undertone of warm maltyness. Tasty brew with lots of pine flavor up front followed by a wave of grainy malts clean lemon and citrus that gives way to a mix of grassy and minty hop flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel is insane for a small beer, lucious and luxurious. I've had three of these today and could have three more."
"Despite the use of Nugget hops, this beer doesn't try to be Nugget Nectar Jr, nor does it need to be. A truly enjoyable, and dare I say, sessionable beer."
"M- A Carmel chewiness is noticeable at the end along with very little carination and no noticeable alcohol taste. Truly a wonderfully enjoyable beer."
"I often session this at the local bar where I can get it on cask and even though the bottle version is very good the cask version blows it away."
"Drinkability- I liked it, was pretty easy to drink and a nice change from IPA's."
"D: Great! I'd like to try it even fresher though. Going to seek out lots of Nugget Nectar because I enjoyed this so much."
"D= Nice beer very enjoyable good session beer."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a great session beer with the mix of flavors, its feel, and its mouthfeel. Decent abv too, nice beer for sure."
"D: The drinkability is high, as the cask softens the rough edges. Glad to have had it in this fashion."
"D: Good overall. Something I could spend a whole night drinking.."
"D - I could definitely take down a few of these. While Troeg's Pale Ale left me wanting more complexity, their Hopback is a great balance of maltiness and hops that satisfies fully."
"D - Fairly high. I love the normal version of hopback, and I have had this on cask a few times before, but the watery feel brought this one down a notch. I still think it is the best cask hopback I have ever had."
"D - Extremely drinkable, I'm going through this glass quickly. Seems like this would be a great everyday beer, or a good gateway from a non-craft beer drinker."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass...Pours a medium copper with a light tan head, good retention and lacing...The aroma is piney, a little malt character, and alcohol, too much for a 6% beer...The taste shows off the hops again, too much pine for me. The pine is too much feel wise, but the hops are too bitter for me as well. A nice rye note tries to balance this out in vain. Way to much hops for me but still an enjoyable drink."
"D: A decent beer, but overall unexciting."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber color with a foamy, long lasting head. Aroma of citrus hops and some malt in the background. Medium crisp body. Citrus hops dominate the flavor with caramel malt provide nice balance at the later stage. Finish is long and bitter. This beer could be nice IPA as well."
"Keep it coming John, please don't move to Hershey."
"D/O- Ambers have never been my favorite style but this takes the cake as far as the best tasting one I've had. I'd be willing to put a few of these back as they are nicely balanced and not too high in ABV. First Troegs beer as well. Hats off to them."
"D - It's a pretty drinkable beer, but I'm not impressed taking the style into consideration."
"A beautiful cap of a finger of thick ecru head floated atop the beer following its pull from an engine. The beer itself was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was spicy with hops, much more so than in its bottle or draft forms. Mouthfeel was phenomenal - silky smooth and with a slight hops bite on the tongue, giving 'way on the finish to a great caramel sweetness. I never seem to get this level of taste anywhere but from cask beers. Finish was smooth, tasty with a wash of simultaneous bitter and sweet that lingered. Drinkability - out of this world!"
"I won't be buying this again, but I sure won't pass it up. Good stuff."
"Pours cloudy light amber. Nice white lasting head. Aroma is hoppy, some citrus, sweet malts. Taste is hoppy, some spice, balanced by some sweet malts. Palate is crisp, good carbonation, nice medium body. Finish is dominated by hops with some light malts to help balance the taste. A well balnced Amber Ale. Very nice"
"Mouthfeel and carbonation seem appropriate and unremarkable. Overall this is hoppier than you would expect for an amber, but the name does give you some warning. Seems closer to a pale ale. Whatever you call it, it's drinkable and delicious."
"overall, great beer, def try it if you can get your hands on it..it was a good APA"
"D- If you love hops, you'll love it. I downgraded it on an average scale just because the hops overwhelms, but gave it more points just because of how its flavor pops."
"D. This was a drinkable beer in the average category to me. I waited until after I had consumed almost the whole 6-pack over several sessions to review this beer. Maybe it just wasn't as good of a batch, but I wouldn't seek this beer out actively again. could be a good selection on a warmer humid day."
"Bottled on 05/14/10; Batch #100426. Big thanks to BigTomZ for this one as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Poured hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and subtle bitter hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, and a slight citrus hop note. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice amber ale. Wish I had gotten to try this one fresher, but it still had maintained quite a bit of it hoppy character despite this fact. The flavor was very nicely balanced and the aroma was quite nice as well. This one is worth seeking out for any Amber/Red Ale fans out there who have not tried this one before."
"It's easy enough to drink and it's got decent flavor, but there's nothing to make it stand out from other malt-focused ales to me."
"Overall: Not sure what happened as it looked and smelt good but everything fell flat after."
"The mouthfeel is good, and it is very drinkable. Overall it is just a good solid beer."
"D- Hopback is another fantastic brew from Troegs. A flavorful brew that really exhibits a caramel malt flavor that is memorable."
"Overall I remain a big fan of this beer, easily in the top tier of ambers. Well worth a shot."
"This one drinks nicely. One after another would bve possible for a hop/amber lover. Not a great beer, but a good one all around."
"Wow, beep... beep... beep.... back the truck up on this one and have it delivered by the truck load. You can drink this brew all day, all year round. This is a tremendous session brew, that will hit the spot for any beer lover or novice. A true session beer with full flavor. What this brew lacks in looks and nose, makes up for in taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. A new favorite for sure."
"Super drinkable and a nice change of pace from the obligatory APA that almost all breweries make. This beer was the first offering I had from Troegs that made me realize that they had something special going on in Harrisburg. Hopback does not get nearly as much press as Nugget Nectar, (its big brother) but is an excellent beer."
" Hopback has subtle fruit flavors which border on stone fruit, but with the simcoe there is more citrus influence. The malt taste is toasted w/ an essence of mild creamy yeast from the cask treatment. The citrus combo with mild munich sweetness is a pleasant juxtoposition w/ more juiciness in the taste than I remember from standard Hopback. the slight caramel comes through more as it warms w/ light tinges of grapefruit and mild lime tinges. The biscuit in the malt is fitting for the style and provides a good backbone for the mild hop w/ only a slight amount of alcohol shining through. A worthy cask ale w/ lots of hop aroma, I think it is solid in its usual format, but the cask with Simcoe hops adds just a little more to the drinkability for me."
"Out da firkin Hopback looks like it's going to be a treat. Bright sunshine orange glaze with some gold set within. Somewhat of a hazy appearance on this one but that's to be expected. A big ol fluffy white head with staying power, not to mention nice stickies. Smell is less sweet than normal hopback out of the bottle, or tap for that matter. The extra dry hopping really shows. Scents of tropic fruits with a thimble of maltback sweetners, bready and quite inviting. Hopback is not a very bitter beer to begin with, this version is no different. In taste the sweetness is muted under the additional hopping and Im loving it. I sense a bunch of pineapple and mango, not so much is fresh grapefruit. A dash of that Troegs signature pine and some sweet from the malts in the back. A slight sense of sugar on the tail end. The feel is to die for, it's a smooth criminal, it almost rivals fresh Racer 5 off the firkin or cask. Less than medium with a perfect gliding effect. This is easy drinking it is very easy to drink it all before you know it's gone. Not my favorite beer to begin with but the firkin makes it that much more enjoyable."
"Palate is medium bodied up front with a somewhat dry finish. Flavor is slightly malty, with a much bigger fruity hop and yeast element than was found in the nose. This is accentuated by a light bitterness and subtle caramel flavor. This is a very nice beer, and one of the best of the style that I've had. I'd welcome this in my glass anytime...like right now."
"Drinkability: I would not turn down another offered to me. This is the style of amber (or more appropriately, red ale) that I like. It is not all caramel malt, hops are a nice balance. Unfortunately, I only have one more until Ken goes to Pennsylvania again next summer."
"Nothing earth-shattering, but a very nice, well-balanced session brew. Good hop fix without crushing bitterness. Very well-done."
"I went to the local pizza shop and picked this up to make up for the case of pisswater I bought last night! I've never had anything from this brewery before, but bought it based on the reviews. Poured into a pint glass, it leaves a head that disappears quickly, but leaves a nice lace throughout the serving. Very nice aroma, and a smooth citrusy taste immediately followed by a slight hoppiness. Smooth all the way thru the glass! A very enjoyable beer to drink."
"Mouthfeel is nice and light and crisp. Very much in body like an American IPA rather than an American Amber. Easy to drink because of this. This is a good beer that is very well brewed. I'm just not sure I love how the parts come together."
"D: VERY! This beer always goes down so smoothly for me. I've always felt that this beer is Nugget Nectar's little brother! Great beer!"
"Sweet entry, fills out nicely. Firm hop backing, but it struggles to cleanse the palate of the sweet malts. A pleasurable drinker - just a bit too sweet to hit above ""good"" for me. I like the floral hop flavor - would shine a little more if not held back by the malt bill."
"The beer pours an almond amber with 1/4 inch white head that fades slowly. A very satisfying and balanced aroma with hints of citrusy-orange and pine. The taste is also very well balanced with a strong hop burst, accompanied by a light piney and citrusy taste. It leaves a lingering bitterness on the tongue. Smooth mouthful with little carbonation. A very drinkable and overall enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability: This is a highly drinkable amber ale. Overall a very solid beer that is highly enjoyable. I think I might have to seek this one out again. Now I have to get my hands on some fresh Nugget Nectar."
"Overall a decent beer but my complaint is it lacked body and more flavor."
"D: Some may consider 6% ABV a bit high to be a session beer. However, I'm certainly enjoying this session."
"Dark amber color with large, pillowy off-white head. Excellent lacing. The sweet aroma is powerful. I'm getting whiffs of it from the TV tray next to me as I type. Smells slightly hoppy with a hint of pine and a woodsy aroma. It's very sweet in its taste, but not in a bad way. A hint of hops, hint of citrus. It's medium bodied, but leaves no aftertaste on the tongue. Very refreshing and drinkable. One of my favorites from Troegs."
"Served to me in a frosty 16 oz mug. I made sure this did not happen on my second serving. The head wasn't much to speak of and the lacing was minimal. This could probably be attributed to a bartender who thinks that no head means perfect pour. Color is amber with a brown haze. Not stunning by any means but to be fair, the generic beer mug was not the ideal vessel. Smelled pretty fresh with an upfront hop nose of flower and pine. Also has a rich sweet malt smell. Taste is just a more beautiful version of the nose. Sweet honey and a healthy dose of floral and spiced hops. Very bold yet balanced flavor. Love it. Mouthfeel is a little creamy and has a good presence on the tongue. Despite the hop bill on this, the finish is nowhere as dry as an IPA making it flavorful and refreshing. Great brew overall. I guess that's why it's Troegs' flagship."
"Drinkabilty - Excellent beer. So smooth and easy to drink, at 6% its not real high alcohol either. I would love to drink this beer with a big old steak and potatos. Be warned, you could rip through a 6-pack rather easy. Troegs does it again."
"Cheers...."
"The body is full and the beer is a tad bit sticky, while not a session brew it is not super hard to drink either."
"Tröegs Brewing Company makes awesome beer. I believe Hopback Amber was my first experience with their beer. It's held a special place in my heart ever since. It's one of my favorite Amber Ales. I love the hopped up approach they took with it. It works extremely well in this style. If you haven't tried Hopback Amber by now, you really should go find a few bottles."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours deep amber color as would be expected with about an inch of head. Scents of sweetness at first and a bit of fruitiness. Pine-like and citrus flavors out front and lots of sweet caramel, spices help round out with the malts. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than most amber's. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"D - Clean and well balanced, this beer has pretty good drinkability and doesn't display the sweet, cloying mouthfeel that is found in many beers within this style."
"With a name like Hopback I was expecting a little more of a hoppy punch, but no go. Not that this was a disappointment at all, for this beer is still tasty. Upon smelling, I was instantly hit with a pleasant roasted aroma of caramel, almost toffee like. This same aroma follows through on taste and finishes with a bit of hop. All and all not bad, but probably should get a little more hop in there to balance the sweetness."
"Smooth amber in color with absolutely no head present. Smelled nice with a very sweet floral presence and a burned caramel malt. The floral and hops are immediately present upon drinking and the malt hides underneath. It has a bitter finish that stays on the palate for a while. It has a very smooth feel and carbonation is light. It is a very easy drink but the bitterness at the end and lingering aftertaste leave me wanting something different."
"Clear dark copper brew with a tan head that settles to a single layer and leaves decent lace. The smell has mild notes of candied cherries and mixed hop, but it's really the thick semi-sweet malty backbone, spot-on for the style, that dominates the nose. The taste is much the same but a mixed/muddy hop is more pronounced. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, finishes dry, adequate carbonation. Decent red ale but nothing great."
"Juicy and refreshing initially with a solid, medium body. Moderate carbonation throughout the brew leaves a soft, lush impression on the palate. The booze shows up and leaves with a semidry finish. Well balances and satisfying throughout. A great tailgating brew or nice to pair with grilled food or a summer salad."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also a bit hoppy, some malts coming through, finishes a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a quality brew."
"Pours a 1-finger head that quickly dies w/o lace ontop of a brownish red body. A very hoppy aroma for an amber ale with good citric notes that are spicy and a nice caramel malt base as well. Well-balanced and smooth light-to-medium bodied beer that has a sweet caramel taste that first struck me and also some bready/dry malts. The citric hops come out for balance on the back end for a mixture of a sweet then dry, crisp beer as the backbite is sharp and pleasant. A great beer for this style as they really got the sweetness right and the hops in there are the perfect amount to taste and balance the sweet malt."
"D: If ever there was a drinkable beer, it is this one. Goes down smooth with a good taste. The ABV is high enough to get you feeling good, without knocking you over."
"D- really good. I could see this being a staple brew for me if it were available. My only real knock is the aforementioned mouthfeel. It's just really really thin."
"Glad I tried this, my favorite beer I have had from Troegs....well done!"
"This is very drinkable and worthy of a few more."
"A reddish ale with a white head. Smells almost fruity like pineapple. Has a hoppy taste that finishes sweet A very good taste though it does finish a little weak but still an attractive taste which is well worth in indulging in a a couple of bottles of"
"Definitely an Amber ale at heart, and I was curious to see what this one was all about after having NN first. Clean, floral hop flavor here without a whole lot of bitterness. Maltiness is a nice combination of toast and sweet grains, earthy even. High drinkability, and enough going on to keep most beer geeks interested for a pint or few."
"A nicely easy-drinking beer. Built for sessioning, as far as I'm concerned."
"D - Excellent! 6 pack at only $9 makes this a solid go-to beer for me."
"nice drinkability, but the caramelized flavor and good amount of malt make this a bit of a sipper for me."
"Tried tapped from Beer on the Bay in Erie PA. Sampler glass, Copper colored with a beige head that retains pretty well and leaves some lacing behind. Smell is full of resinous hops, pine, and has some nice malt behind it too, very sweet. Bitter hops on the tongue, but leads into some resinous pine and sweet caramel malt. Medium carbonation and body. I'd like a little more hops in the taste to accompany the aroma, but it is just an amber ale, I have had lighter flavored ambers. So this was quite flavorful."
"This is hoppier and more bitter than most other ambers, but it works pretty well. This is a pretty enjoyable and drinkable brew. I would have guessed"
"Had this on cask at Pipers Pub, which is what inspired me to review. Have had lots of these in the past, but it was truly a treat on the handpull. The hops are nicely subdued, but the rich maltiness comes right out at you from the nose to the first sip. Still had a nice hoppy aroma when freshly pulled, one that jumped out at you even when your nose was a couple inches from the glass. Extremely drinkable, even at 6%abv. Definitely see myself going back for a couple more of these, since I'm sure it wont last long."
"Overall: well-balanced and solid beer. Easy to drink in any occasion. The aftertaste was especially interesting as it had a sweet kick as it went down."
"This was a very tasty beer, lots of flavor and lots of hops. It was also very refreshing for the amount of hops."
"Drinks: Damn it, but I do enjoy hopped-up versions of classic styles, and Hopback is the perfect example of just such a beer -- one tasty, spicy amber."
"D- A little too rich to session, but tasty for one or two."
"d- full disclosure: not a big amber fan. this one was pretty solid though. I could drink a few of these pretty easily. Excited to try a few more troegs brews."
"MF/D: briefly buzzes the tongue, but slides down smooth and coats the palate. a very enjoyable beverage."
"Overall this is a well above average beer. It is tasty and light and I could see myself enjoying several bottles of this in a single sitting."
"Overall: Overall the beer is really good. Very hoppy, so all hop lovers will enjoy this one. I'd recommend tasting it if you like a hoppy beer."
"Pours a dark amber color with a cap of off-white head, decent retention and lacing. First whiff is floral, piney and earthy hops backed by a nice carmely malt and a touch of roasted nuts. Flavor kicks the hop scent up just a bit with a nice piney bite, smooth floral flavors all backed by a lightly sweet carmel backbone. Nice medium body, good carbonaiton level. An all around high quality and pleasent amber that is highly drinkable in quantity."
"D: Overall, this is a very nice hoppy amber. Easy and smooth drinking, this is a beer that could become a regular if it was available locally. Nicely done Troeg's."
"The color is a deep amber with a thin head that doesn't stick around very long. Sugary malt and a hint of spicy hops are evident from a big whiff. Makes me want to take a swig! Yum! A little citrus, which I love, is quickly followed by sweet malt. Well balanced ale which could easily be overindulged. I love this style...and you should too!"
"D: Despite the name, this beer is not in the hops war, so it's ideal for sharing with a group with wide tastes. I think that lends the beer good ratings for drinkability."
"D - easy drinking, refreshing"
"All in all a good beer and one that I would drink again."
"Poured a nice red color with a barely noticeable head. Heavy smell of hops at first that had me dreading the taste. Was quite surprised by the balanced flavor and even texture. tastes more like a red Ale than a hopped up IPA which one does not expect from the aroma. In the end a rather easily drinkable beer with a good body and crisp finish."
"Good close, stiff but tasty. Quite drinkable. Reminds me of Magic Hat's Roxxy Rolles."
"Notes: A good pick up a very good year round beer. Cheers."
"Thanks to Tiklmelmo for this one."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly above average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it has some really nice hoppy and malty flavors that mix nicely. Definitely a very drinkable beer that I should buy more often when I'm looking to drink a few with friends."
"d - A very easy to drink amber ale. Lots of smooth malts going on here but not much hops. Have had many times and will definitely have again."
"D- really, really drinkable. They sell this at Harrisburg's minor league baseball stadium, and it goes over huge with the crowd who isn't big into craft stuff. Its 6%, but you wouldn't be able to tell. Really great drinkable beer for the earlier months of the year."
"Thanks Adam!"
"A: Slightly tarnished copper, lots of floating particles, thick creamy head which sticks around for some time until it slowly drops to reveal significant lacing - 4.00, S: Slightly medicinal, mild tartness, mellow grapefruit and caramel - 3.00, T: Medium hop bitterness, pleasantly sweet with strong caramel flavors, nicely balanced, faint alcohol noticeable - 3.75, M: Medium bodied and quite smooth, a little burn off the alcohol - 3.50, D: A solid amber ale, very nicely crafted, ever so slightly tilted to the hops than the malts, very drinkable - 4.00"
"Drinkability - Really nice balance to this beer. Leans slightly toward the hop side. A great anytime beer. Very drinkable."
"It's obvious that I prefer dry hopping to hop backing. The temperature of the wort when it goes through the hop back probably releases more resins and increases the bitterness. Dry hopping only adds hop flavor."
"D- its a quafable one for sure I might just need to get another one. Paired beautifully with the roasted pork sandwich I had."
"D - great balance and a light body makes this quite drinkable and slightly dangerous even at 6%. i like it, dont love it. for the style though, its a nice tease for hop heads."
"Poured a dark reddish amber with an off white head that faded. Large hop smell up front with a nice malt backbone. The taste is a deep hop flavor with some nice malty notes mixed in. A very smooth medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation and a great balance of flavor. This one is a nice drinker if you are a hop fan. Not too overpowering, but nice flavor, a great beer."
"Pours a clear, light copper color with 1 finger of head that fades with chunky lacing. Smells of big, citrus hops with faint notes of toasted malt in the background. Taste starts out with a bit of a bitter pucker before a nice, toasted malty middle. The finish is slightly lingering and bitter, just on the edge of being harsh. Body is on the sticky sweet side of medium and drinkability is pretty good, hurt only by the slightly harsh bitterness/graininess of the finish."
"Like most Troegs' I've had, pleasingly well-balanced. Well done."
"Drinkability: A good quality, sessionable, easy drinking beer from Troegs. It's one that I've enjoyed plenty in the past, and will continue to do so as long as they continue to brew it. If you are looking for a good tasting, simple brew to relax and end a night with, this one should fit the bill. Cheers!"
"I may try this again, only at a warmer serving temp, sometime next fall. . ."
"I am not going to get technical with this beer because it is so dam good! If you are a fan of hops you will love this beer! Don't just take my word for it; look at everyone else's reviews as well...it is an exceptional beer."
"Another quality product from the Troegs brothers. Top 10 brewers in this reviewers opinion, and this drink backs it up. Offerinings always fresh and well crafted. Great year round offering. Might be very interesting to ferment in new oak barrels. Just wish I lived closer to Harrisburg."
"Drinkability is amazing with this. This first one went down almost too fast! Alcohol is nonexistent. Super easy to drink. Drinks like a great pale ale with a pinch more malt. Which this beer basically is. Great buy for $9.79 a sixer! Always was a favorite of mine from Troegs. Only thing better than this one from Troegs is it's bigger brother Nugget Nectar."
"Pours a nice amber color with a thick and frothy beige head that retains well and leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is also really nice, with piney and citrusy hops upfront, followed by caramel malt, fruity esters, biscuit, and a little alcohol. The flavor has some caramel and toasted bread notes initially, followed by a piney and citrusy hops blast, and some fruity esters. The mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is incredible. This is a superbly balanced and quite tasty amber, wish I could drink it more often."
"D: Very drinkable with the balanced flavor profile and crisp clean mouthfeel. Delicious!"
"pours an amber color with a small amount of head. fairly hoppy smell, with a good hoppy taste. decent amount of lacing, and lite carbonation. i thought this beer was pretty tasty. i think FeDUBBELFIST said it best "" it taste like a dumbed down version of the nugget nectar"". sounds about right to me. good stuff."
"Serving type: Draft"
"Mouthfeel is very creamy with a medium to heavy body and a below average amount of carbonation. This is very easy to drink, as there is not an overwhelming amount of bitterness and it is not too heavy. Something just randomly picked up while at the store, and I'm definitely happy I did."
"I fnd Troegs beers, in general, to be easy, though enjoyable, on the palette. HopBack is no exception."
"D - A very nice offering from Troegs; probably my favorite so far. This satisfies the hops desire without going into IPA territory. I can see enjoying a few of these."
"Good drinkability. Basically a baby Nugget Nectar."
"D - A solid amber ale with good drinkability. I could drink a few of these, but it just kind of makes me want some Nugget Nectar."
"Very enjoyable brew, would purchase again!"
"D: Relatively easy to drink, especially if you like hoppy beers"
"D: A very, very easy drinker here. This can simultaneously satisfy cravings for malty and hoppy beers. Tasty and well-balanced, with an aggressive hop character for the style. This beers surprises me a little more each time I have it."
"D: Decent beer. Not one of my favs from Troegs, but good nonetheless. An above average beer to have now & again."
" D- This beer has a nice hop flavor but it is a bit soft and the malt is even softer. The over all flavor is pretty dry but it is pretty quaftable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Clear, ruby amber with a small off white head that shrinks quickly to a small collar of foam. Nice piney and fruity hops in the nose with caramel malt. Plenty of fresh hop flavors balanced with a solid caramel malty backbone. Full bodied with prickly carbonation. A good hophead's amber."
"Drinkability: For hop lovers, this is a break from your normal hoppy IPA. Solid sessionability on this one. Seek out."
""
"Na Zdravje!"
"Notes: This beer is good, but for some reason it just never really popped for me. Good all around, maybe just a little boring or not my style."
"Decent, not great beer. Was expecting more from Troeg's."
"Troegs has put out a very drinkable beer with Hopback. Easy to drink with assertive but not overpowering flavors. I could see enjoying a handful of these at a given time, well if they were available in my area. Very solid beer."
"M/D- Nice clean finish and very drinkable."
"Drinkability - Such a well balanced beer. Really well done. Another good brew from Troegs."
"D - so well-balanced and so tasty without ever being too much on the taste buds even though there is a lot going on."
"Not the most thrilling beer ever, and not as hoppy as I expected from something with hopback in the name, but I could easily session the hell out of this beer if it was readily available to me."
"D-the finish takes away from the overall drinkability as it has notes of metal and phenol. Not bad, though, definitely drinkable."
"drinkability is ok - i am not an amber fan but this is one of the better ones"
"D - WOW. 5.0"
"Tasty and well balanced, this beer epitomizes a well brewed, American-style session ale. It reminded me of a toned down version of Troegs' other amber ale (Nugget Nectar)."
"The smell shouts with the malty caramel scents they boast on the label. The sweet and flowery taste (no doubt from the dry-hopping) gives this one a very exciting back to it on the way out. It dances on the door of the IPA genre, but checks itself with a nice balance thanks to the strong malt presence, which has a butter cookie quality. Overall, the taste is a wave of sweet and bitter which flows in and out from first sip to the after taste. Nice, smooth body makes this dangerously drinkable."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Very nice red/amber color a little hazy with a thick white head that does not hang around very long going into a thin film. Had decent lacing. Right away I can smell the Cascade hops. Very citrusy bite but also a caramel sweetness. I found the taste very interesting and conflicted. From the aroma it was not what I had expected. Overall an enjoyable experiance."
"D: This is a good beer. It's abv is of session quality and it has a nice flavor for an amber ale, without being too agressive. That being said, I still prefer it's bigger brother (NN)."
"Overall, a delicious and very drinkable ale, however I have a feeling that it might show better from the bottle."
"D - Not a bad session beer, will be coming back to this one."
"Cheers!"
"D- Not your average run of the mill amber. This beer has an excellent hoppy profile and can easily become a staple go to session beer for the masses. Well done Troegs team!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip. Not a lot of head maybe a quarter of an inch or so, very little lacing. A beautiful amber color in the glass. The hops come to the forefront in the aroma, smelling of pine and citrus. I'm not a real hop head but I am slowly trying to work my way up to hoppier beers. This one is a great starting point. The hops balance very nicely with the caramel notes from the malt. Not any overly hoppy flavor as the name might imply. This is a very well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Not being overly expensive I will certainly be buying more of this in the future. I think that this would make a very good session beer."
"Pours amber with a slight off-white head. The aroma is piney hops with some malt. The flavor is more of the same with piney hops and a nice caramel malt backbone. Medium-thin mouthfeel and low carbonation. Not the most complex beer in the world but a very good drinker."
"D - Could easily have a few but with a 2.50 price tag I could see me buying one every now and again."
"D: This is a very good beer, true to style. I find it interesting, there are obviously quite a bit of late addition hops, but there are not the obvious hop flavors that I would like to see. Definitely worth trying, I would be happy to have this available in KY."
"This beer is insanely drinkable and one of my standbys. You can't go wrong with this one."
"My first from Troegs, cannot wait to try some of their others."
"Drinkability: A very good session beer at 6%. I wish I say this on draft a little more regularly than I do now."
"D: Even the loud, drunk & obnoxious girl beside me couldn't keep me from enjoying this one. Really smooth, very well balanced and truly sublime. The Hopback Amber Ale is made for the cask."
"The Troegs is hoppier than most amber I have had, to the point where many of the other flavors are pushed to the background. The beer finishes well with a nice crispness."
"Drinkability: On cask this is actually smoother and the flavors better integrated than when having it from the bottle. I could easily have more than one a night and I'll return to this one on cask. For those who like hops but want some softening provided by the malt this beer is a good choice. Every time I drink one of these beer is always gone before I want it to be."
"This is a pretty good beer. It's nothing exceptional, but I'd certainly have it again. I don't always love ambers, this one is hoppier than most, so it makes me pretty happy."
"this is a beer you could keep around house as staple session and not get tired of"
"Love Troegs Hopback. Mostly because it was my first real good beer. But, also because it has that great east coast malt/hop balance. The aroma is great. Floral hops shining brite. Smells so delicious. Taste? Balance. Bitterness, and piney hops in the aftertaste. Let out that burp and mmm hoppy goodness!"
"Drinkability is there, could be slightly more flavorful, but not overdone to tire your tastebuds."
"Overall this is a very sessionable beer that is refreshing and flavorful at the same times. Another nice Amber by Troegs. Recommended."
"That said, overall this is a nice, quaffable entry that would make a great session beer when the outside temperatures come back to sanity in the spring."
"Clear, dark and bubbly in the glass, with a loose and noisy head that fades fairly quickly, like a head on a glass of Coke. There's a dense cloud of hops that floats above the head, yet it's got enough sweetness from the malt to be balanced. There's also a hint of oranges in the nose. I expected a hoppier taste was pleasantly surprised by how mellow the hops actually were. Sure, they're present but the lend a nice sharpness without being overly sour or ham-fisted. You'll pucker a tiny bit-- it's refreshing, and the malt swings in shortly thereafter to soften the blow. The orange tang is quite nice, too. One for the fridge!"
"Drinkability is pretty high. Overall this is good stuff. Tröegs was my first craft beer love and I always enjoy a good fling with them."
"Awesome beer. For those that like hops, but is very nicely and evenly balanced out with the carmel malts. Spicy and floral hops in the background add a great taste."
"Poured a deep carbonated amber into an American pint glass, with a finger of white head that laced very well. The revealed citrus, lemon and grapefruit, but also some caramel and maltiness. The flavor revealed the balance between the hops and the malt to be a little more skewed to the malt side, but it worked, and it finished on a surprisingly dry note. The carbonation seemed just at the right level for this medium-bodied beer, helping its sessionability in the process."
"Great red ale, I would drink this all the time but in's not distributed to Cali ;-("
"Even though it smelled a lot like citrus hops, I am not expecting a hop bomb in my mouth and I don't get a hop bomb. This beer is medium body and really smooth. The bitterness is understated and there is no aftertaste. There is a strong citrus hop flavor in the beer. The carbonation really helps to connect the flavors of the beer while I'm drinking it. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is high."
"Good session brew if you're looking for IPA kick in a red. Not a patch on Nugget Nectar, though."
"Final thoughts: Overall a meh beer. It's got some crisp clean flavors and is pretty refreshing, but not much on the hop end considering its called ""hop back"". It's semi bland for an amber ale too. Oh well. This is probably the first Troegs I haven't been impressed with, bit it also could be because its 2 months old, needs to be fresh. I'll look out for a fresh one next time. Or again, this could be a factor of the fact that red/amber ales are usually not my cup of t... ummm, beer."
"Overall, a solid offering from Troegs. If this were readily available to me, I would probably buy it more. Thanks Adam for the chance."
"Drinkability: This beer contains the most depth that my young palate has experienced in this style and it is also the hoppiest of the style I've tried so far. Not quite great, but still damn good."
"This is my first offering from Troeg's. Pours a nice amber brown. Not much head, but a nice hoppy bite of an aroma. Very clean hoppy citrus taste. This is a great example of this style. Super easy to drink, the first sips are hoppy/bitter, but finish with a nice malty smoothness. I could drink a lot of these."
"Drinkability: A great amber ale. This has everything you could want from the style. It is well-balanced and definitely worth a try."
"dr. Very good. Very easy. Wish I had more."
"d- really great, i could have a bunch of these, glad this is a local brew for me, very sessionable."
"Awesome beer. I love everything from troegs and this is another solid one from them. I cannot wait for Nugget Nectar to release! This will keep me company till then"
"M/D: It has a nice carbonization, and has some bitterness, from the hops. This ale does go down sommth. It is a ale that I will drink again."
"M/D: Medium bodied, medium to carbonation. Drinkability is OK, nothing great. A little disappointed in this beer."
"D - Not as good as the Green Flash red ale I just had, but a solid beer."
"D - wow would search this out and drink this if given to me."
"Tastes great, lots of hops but the malt comes in nicely to even things up again. Sweet, spicy and very drinkable."
"Pours a clear amber with a small off-white head with poor retention. Aromas of sweet caramel and toffee, with comparatively faint citrusy hops; very floral; a pleasant and inviting nose. Palate is very well balanced - same flavors as the nose suggested with the addition of a leafy hop component. Dry on the mid palate but lingers long and sweet. A very flavorful, sessionable ale."
"D- New take for me on an amber. The big hop profile really makes it stand out from most reds i've had. Solid beer for sure."
"I must admit that this is one of my favorite beer styles; therefore my review may be a bit subjective. Especially seeing as how this is a fine Pennsylvania brewery, and myself being a Pennsylvanian, I may be cheering for the home-team a bit. However I do believe that Troegs Hopback is a damn fine amber ale! Troegs is one of those (few) breweries that I can honestly say, that I've never had a beer from, that I wasn't happy with--to at least some degree."
"D-Refreshing. I might usually only give this a four, but it's been awhile since I had a hoppy brew, and this is just what I needed."
"Nice prickly carbonation. This could have been a stellar brew but for something called HOPback I would have gone with a few more hops, the malt seems to take over this one."
"Mouthfeel is very full and rich, nice and malty. Theres a bit of bitterness that lingers on the palate, very nice. Quite a good balance of hops with a malty backbone makes this a superbly drinkable brew!"
"Pours medium copper with not much head, just a ring that sticks around. No lacing, but decent carbonation. Nose contains bitter hops as well a bit of caramels. Taste is rather light, dominated by bitterness with a hint of caramel toastiness. Not much body, but an easy drinker."
"Drinkability on this beer is quite good. I could find this a sessionable brew with some brats or a good slab of something once moving. Overall I think this beer is worth coming back to, something that is cheap enough to make a session beer, and balanced enough to enjoy without a magnifying glass for complexity."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer. Great balance between hops and malt."
"Drinkability: Very high drinkability. I could easily throw back 3+ of these."
"This is a fantastic amber ale that would be very sessionable as the taste, carbonation and body are just right for each other."
"Pours a clear amber color with slightly orangish stained head that is initially more than 1 finger but receeds leaving minor lacing on the glass. Nose is full of citrus and sweet hops and some malt in the background. Taste has hop bitterness that drags from the front to the finish, but inbetween there is some malt sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is medium on this one, definately has a clingy aftertaste but an enjoyable one at that. Carbination seems a bit low."
"Drinkability: Overall, I'm very happy with this amber, and better yet, happy I've finally tried a Troeg's brew. Excellent balance between hops and malt make this a sure fire winner in my book!"
"Bottled 06/17/09. Thanks to SBALDWIN for this bottle. Pours a dark, clear amber with a large white head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Has a semi-sweet malt aroma with some earthy hints. The hops lend some citrus and pine resin aromas. The caramel malt gives a solid flavor base, semi-sweet and bready before the hop bitterness and citrus/pine flavors take over. Finishes moderately bitter with just a hint of alcohol warmth. Medium body with a nice soft texture. Just enough carbonation to liven things up. A really nice hoppy amber ale. I imagine fresher the better but my sample was still good."
"Drinkability: A very good and very drinkable Amber. Good hop nose and flavor, with a nice malt backing. Very smooth and easy to drink. Excellent session beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"Initial pour was an excellent color with fantastic aroma. The taste was exceptionally smooth. It was not too heavy and this could become a fantastic session beer. The ""hoppiness"" was not overpowering and Troegs really got this one right. Fantastic..."
"Rich medium-weight texture is a near perfect complement to the bitter overtone -- lingering just long enough. Thus, dangerous drinkability --I could see several in one sitting! This beer will be a welcome Saturday evening addition to any high-class social gathering."
"Very clean and crisp. Easy to drink and refreshing. I like this as a summer brew. It is quality amber ale that gives plenty of flavor."
"D- Moderate. Taste, body, and flavor is there, and ABV is expertly blended. This beer is so tasty, though, I wish it were a hair lower on the ABV scale. Only because I want to keep drinking it! My first Troegs, a lovely beer and for sure one hell of a American Amber/Red Ale hoppy hybrid brew!"
"It's a good beer. Just don't mistake it for an American Amber. It's really an English bitter."
" I'm gonna have to give it the two thumbs of approval! For an amber ale that is definitely american it has a bit more hop flavor than i expected. Nicely done. Will definitely drink again!"
"a substancially hop amber. basic but suffient malt. absolute not bready to a dense state. i like the quality of the beer. the amber is there... color wise. i'm just not really sure what the spread between an american pale and an american amber is. its a great beer but pointless to define outside of american."
"Poured a clear, dark amber, with a cream colored head that dissipated quickly. Big grapefruit aroma was present with a little malt presence. Simple, but inviting. Flavor was a nice balance of malt and hop presence. Grapefruit flavor comes through up front followed by bready malt, ending with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is average. Low carbonation and medium body. Overall, I found this to be a highly drinkable beer."
"Picked up a single bottle of this in Brooklyn. Pours a lovely amber color bordering on orange with a small white head that was gone rather quickly. Nice hop aroma, a bit piney. Taste is a little on the weaker side for me. A bit watery for an IPA. There's a decent bitterness lying beneath the cracker/biscuit like malt, a bit of toastiness. Nothing really special, and I think the thin, watery mouthfeel makes the taste a little less pleasing. This is the first beer I've had by this brewery, and I have to say that I wasn't impressed."
"D) A very delicious amber. Pass the word - a great beer!"
"Nice deep amber color, good head retention and decent lace. Aroma a bit restrained but the hop bite is there where it counts, on the taste buds. Not a typical chocolatey amber, this one has a nice hop bite on the citrus side. i liked this beer and had it more than once in Brooklyn recently."
"Tröegs HopBack Amber Ale is a very clear, solid amber ale with a thick, dense, yellowish head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a fresh hoppy aroma, citrusy and grassy with a hint of sweetness. It's medium bodied, foamy and very smooth. The finish is clean and dry. This is beautifully balanced. That touch of sweetness seems to go with both the juicy hops and the caramel malt. There's a little bit of roastiness in the after taste. This is an ideal beer!"
"D - what a helluva session beer! i've liked a lot of ambers more, but this is the best balanced and approachable one yet, move over Fat Tire!"
"Thanks Sstacko!"
"HV"
"This amber ale is very drinkable but leans very close to an APA in my book. Always an enjoyable session beer, kudos to the chef!"
"Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"The apperance of this beer is truly amazing, unlike anything ive ever seen. Has a rich reddish hue. Not much head, decent lace. The smell is very pleasing. Sweet piney inviting smell and somewhat hoppy. The taste is rich and is not overpowered by hops. Well ballenced. The mouth feel is nice and goes down quite smooth. I find this to be a quality brew."
"This is an extremely clean and refreshing amber. Bravo Troegs!"
"Overall a very drinkable beer, but just didn't have the flavor i was expecting."
"Drinkability is great. This amber ale is one of the better I have ever had. A ton of taste, but smooth and easy going down. Great selection if you like ambers."
"Overall i loved this beer. I was very impressed. I will make this a go to beer."
"A very good red ale, more hops than caramel malt, but still relatively balances. The baby to Nugget Nectar, a really great session ale."
"D - Drinkability loses half a point because I'm not a fan of the big hit of spice on the back end. Though I generally think of ambers as having a more noticable malt backbone with a good deal more sweetness, this drier interpretation managed to work pretty well. Unique combination of hop flavors, even if they aren't what I prefer. Decent overall."
"Pours a copper amber color with a nice one and a half finger head that gives way to some lacing. The smell is of malt with some citrus hops to it. The taste is of citrus hops in the back end with malt up front. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall it is a slightly above average it has a good hop taste that is balanced out with malt."
"Great drinkability. Goes well with most anything. A great hoppy amber. One that I've bought several times since I've been able to find it. Love the fresh hop taste that troegs delivers."
"D- This is a very nice drinker that I would enjoy on a warm summer night outside with friends. Glad I got to try this beer and can't wait to have some of Troegs other offerings in the near future."
"The only real complaint was that there was no head, but if it's tastes pretty good, then who cares."
"D - Great beer, I could drink it all night, and I will. Every sip leaves me wanting more and I can clearly see why it flies off the shelves at work. Truly recommend this to any veteran beer drinker and to someone who may not know they like beer yet or what type of beer they're into yet."
"Easy drinker. Well worth seeking out."
"Another winner from Troegs. A delicious, well-hopped amber ale. Rich amber color with a delightful sweet pine aroma and a perfectly balanced flavor. A nice pine/citrus punch up front with a clean finish. Just a really great, easy drinking amber ale. Highly recommended."
"Hopback contains several shades of reds and yellow that combine to the color of a sunset! Sticky head to boot. Aroma is fresh, fresh hops. Mainly citrus and wet grassy flavors from the hops. Some caramel and soggy wood (not in a bad way, more an earthy character) aromas as well. Well balanced flavors all around. Besides a slightly higher than normal ABV for such use, I would consider this a great session beer."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable. Nice session beer. I am becoming more and more of a Troeg's fan."
"D: This is a great beer. I look forward to having my other bottle!"
"Light, whipped up foam across the surface, cream white in color, thin but clingy lacing. Pale mahogany to amber red in hue, persistent widespread bubbles visible. Pleasing caramel, toffee and heavy cream in the nose, sweeter hops with a mix of tangy citrus, flowers and tea leaf, there's graininess but no real bite nor bitterness. Medium-bodied, round and foamy carbonation, fills the mouth but without that much weight. Milk chocolate, toffee, caramel accents with a pinch of golden raisin to fig next to the apricot, peach and cherry flavors. More hops, cereal, and grass than in the nose, brings an overall swelling of dryness to it. Orange pekoe tea, more of a tea to wet tobacco edge than floral. Moves at a steady pace, neither slow nor swift. Nicely drinkable but not that thirst slaking."
"Troegs is quickly becoming one of my favorite American breweries."
"Tastes like a well-hoped amber. I--I wish I had some more to say, but even though it's firm and tasty it's not really complex. Bitter hops do a good job of balancing out sweet caramel malts."
"An extremely good session beer. I am impressed."
"Served in a bottle I received in trade from dwennis. Poured into a standard pint glass. It's a clear copper color that has mild white head that settles to a skim of foam. It has a strong floral hop aroma. There is some toffee taste up front, followed by hops of a medium bitterness. It ends with the taste of molasses. The Hopback has a slightly heavier than medium body with a bit of a syrupy thickness; there is no mouthcoating though. It's a very good beer, one I would certainly drink again. It's too bad it isn't readily available in my area."
"I did love this brew, however, it did remind me more of a weakened IPA than of an amber...but nonetheless a great quaffer-simplicity at it's finest once again. This one seems like a gateway brew for some..."
"Fresh 12oz bottle. Pours perfectly clear amber with a sizeable pale yellow head that lasts. Fruity, grassy hops are dominant over faint malt in the smell. A bit of bubblegum. The taste has some grapefruity bitterness. Citric notes and earthiness dominate faint biscuity malt. Nice medium body and good carbonation. Pretty decent, but there's not a lot of real amber ale character as the caramel malts aren't very assertive; essentially just another IPA."
"Drinkability is excellent, perhaps not as refreshing as some others in this style, but fuller bodied and more tasty than most, and quite easy drinking, fersure. A base hit (not a home run) for Troegs."
"The mouthfeel could be a little crisper on this. Carbonation is low to medium level. The hops on this are not overpowering by any means. They leave a subtle hop bite on the finish, but it's tamed out by a nice sweet malt base. This is a well-done amber, I must say. I could drink a few of these at a time."
"Excellent beer."
"drinkability- highly drinkable beer, would be a good session option that with each sip would leave you craving more, i would say this is an amazing beer but definitely solid choice,"
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a amber color with a fluffy head that leaves nice lace on the glass. Smell is a hop explosion pine, citrus, spring air comes to mind on this beer. The taste is as good as the smell very nicely hopped but not extreme, the citrus and pine really do shine here with a very well balanced malt back bone. This has to be one of the finest red ale's that I have tried. Very balanced and a hop lovers dream with a fresh clean taste."
"D: Pretty good flavor, but I could see this causing a small amount of palate fatigue."
"NOTES: I had this 6% ABV on tap in a pint glass, I could really see hanging out for a while taking a few of these bad boys down, and I did. It was perfect by itself, but I could see myself having a few of these with something hardy like burger, or a nice blue cheese, or a nice blue cheese burger."
"D: Great Red Amber - I really enjoyed this beer and as always find Troegs to be a great brewery"
"D: This is one of my favorite ambers. I can drink this stuff anytime."
"I have to pace myself as I could easily down this quick."
"I could have 2 to 3 in a sitting."
"This beer reminds me of Troegs Nugget Nectar. Yea, it's that good."
"Served in a faceted mug."
"Drinkability: I really really enjoy this beer and it really is drinkable. I got a single of this, but from now on I am going to look out for sixers of this beauty. It reminds a lot of a simpler nugget nectar."
"This brew poured to an Amber color ... go figure, nice red highlights come through. Nice sized off-white head that has excellent retention and left thick lace rings down the side of the glass. The aroma has a nice balance but the hops seem to get my attention first off. Nice floral aroma that is very inviting. There is a nice caramel like malt flavor there that melds nicely and IMO keeps it quite in balance. The flavors are what you would expect based on the nose, Caramel malts come out quickly with a break to the hops which while floral in the nose seem to be spicier here. Has a somewhat sweet finish, which is not bad, might have liked to see it be a little dryer. Overall this is a nice brew, I would have thought that this could be a pretty good session brew till I came to the realization that it is 6%. Another nice brew from Troegs, becoming a favorite brewery for me, they don't miss."
"This beer has been placed as my number one ranked beer, and I have been studying for a long time."
"D- Whoah....very nice and I could have several of these in a session."
"My first Troegs beer has become an instant favorite. I could easy drink a few of these in one sitting. What a great brew! I can't wait to try more Troegs now that I live in an area where they distribute. Really impressive beer!"
"Nice balance with a decent body. Pleasant malt start, mostly crystal. The swallow presents the bitter hop, but the aftertaste is brief. This is a very easy beer to drink."
"The balance of this beer make it highly drinkable and therefore, quite dangerous. One of my favorites."
"A bit reluctant to finish smooth and leaves a lot of hops on the palate. But well-balanced overall."
"I found a sooth mouthfeel that was a perfect balance from first sip to final gulp. Hopback is a perfect sessional beer for any season. As I point out in my other reveiws: Troegs is one fine brewery. Keep up the good work - and the great brews."
"Another happy find at Teresa's Cafe in Princeton, NJ this poured a deep clear copper color with a splotchy medium sized, light oatmeal colored head and great big bubbled lacing. The aroma has a gentle citrus hop and nutty malt toffee character, soft but good. The flavor is somewhat thin but tastey citrus hop with dry bitterness and a toasted wheat bread base. It is finely carbonated for a tingly crisp and very drinkable ale. Smooth, edible, sessionable I would think. Troeg's has a winner here, for the masses but very tasteful. Nice!"
"I am happy that Hopback was flavorful and extremely drinkable, because I need something to tide me over until Nugget Nectar is released again."
"Troegs knows how to make beer, plain and simple. Nothing too fancy, just well-balanced, full-flavored and very drinkable brews."
"Drinkability- Really, a refreshing brew. Awesome with grilled hamburgers and salad."
"not bad for the younger brother of nugget nectar!"
"Hopback Amber could be a go-to hot weather, or post-workout, beer for hop heads. It was easy to drink and had me imagining I was sitting at a tavern's outside deck on a lazy, sunny July day."
"D - Very smooth and refreshing. A somewhat reserved but pleasant every day beer."
"D. Easy to drink. I could see myself kicking back a few of these at the annual pig roast. Good flavor, not too bitter. A good fall/early spring beer for me."
"I could definitely drink a bunch of these. The hops have a nice balance to them, the light body makes them really easy to drink and the bitterness is mellow enough that it probably wouldn't be too much after 2 or 3 of these. Pretty nice beer. Makes me excited to finally try nugget nectar."
"Have to admit, it tastes like the little brother of Nugget Nectar. Not really enough malt to balance the hops, thinner body. All in all I prefer the older, more mature brother."
"Even though most amber ales don't have this level of hops, this is a really nice change that compliments the beer nicely. A nice rear round beer that makes you crave Nugget Nectar."
"D- Great brew that would make a nice gateway beer for those in search of hoppy beers without the palate for stonger IPAs and DIPAs."
"Had this at the Richmond Downtown Capital Ale House. My first troegs beer. Poured into a pint glass. Had a dark amber color with a thick and creamy off-white head. Lots of hops and citrus in the aroma. Taste had some caramel and strong hop presence. The beer had a bitter finish. I thought a little too bitter for an amber. I still enjoyed this beer. Can't wait to try the nugget nectar."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear golden amber color with about two fingers of tight off white head. Smells and tastes of caramel malts, bread, pine, fruity hops leading to notes of grapefruit and light citrus. Medium in both body and carbonation. Excellent drinkability."
"D- pretty good. I got this in a sampler pack with 3 other Troegs varieties, so I don't have a six pack to finish off, but I might pick one up, because this is a pretty enjoyable beer."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"This brew is a good balanced brew very drinkable and easily quaffable. I will go back to this brew again"
"D - Nice offering. Could have a few."
"Thanks Shawn for trying to convince me that Troegs aint that bad!"
"I poured into a pint glass to a short, white head. The color was reddish amber. It has a citrusy hop smell with a bit of pine. The taste was mild compared to Nugget Nectar, basically a toned down version. I rather enjoyed this amber ale much more than the imperial version. I could see myself tipping a few of these in a sitting, only two tonight though."
"Overall another fine effort by Troeg's."
"This is a favorite of mine. Very deep amber color typical of a solid amber ale (imagine that). Nice white, fluffy head that remains for a good while. Their are some nice citrusy scents in the nose, but is equally balanced by a nice sweet caramal aroma. The taste follows the nose nicely, but with a bit more emphasis on the hops. The sweetness is closer to a honey sweetness than a caramel sweetness, but is delicious all the same. Has a well carbonated mouthfeel, but slides down quite gently. This is an easy drinker and fits most situations."
"Pours a very vibrant, bright amber color with a good creamy head which retains decently. Smells of light caramel and a bit of citrus hops...clean with maybe a hint of metallic. Taste is evenly citrus hops throughout with a nice cramel/biscuit/bready malt backbone. Fairly bitter finish and not too dry. Medium bodied, not too carbonated, and semi dry finish. Very drinkable and nice amber offering from Troegs. I need to get my hands on some Nugget Nectar."
"Overall, not a particularly impressive beer but a decent drink if you're looking for something in the style."
"Drinkability is pretty high"
"This isn't my favorite style, but it's tasty and not too filling, so given the modest ABV, I could go for a couple of these in a sitting."
"Drink is very high I could definelty have some more of these."
"D - Something you could drink without thinking about."
"hops can get resinous with just a tad less malt to back it up than i hoped, so not quite a 4.5 in overall drinkability."
"Drinkability- Top notch. Goes down easy due to mouthfeel and the taste is an even better bonus."
"The pour is a good looking amber-orange with a lot of carbonation that bubbles up to a frothy two-finger beige head then settles back a bit but never entirely. The aroma is hops first, citrus second almost like an IPA. The mouthfeel is of medium to bold texture and holds its own while swirling in the mouth. A hoppy taste bites me on first sip but then it ends in a rather unique but balanced bitter finish. A pretty good brew."
"Drinkability- Lots of full flavor. A beautiful hoppy amber."
"D: Very drinkable. Glad I'll soon be moving out to VA and can get Troegs beers whenever I need them."
"M - Creamy, thin bodied, medium carbonation."
"troegs may just be the best brewery in the state. east coast...exponentiallyETC..."
"D: This is a pretty good beer. I'd definitely recommend it especially for a kind of transition beer to introduce someone to an IPA"
"D- Good, while the hops are certainly present the smooth balance allows for continued consumption, very easy to have a few of these."
"Drinkable and flavorful for a pretty standard style of brew. Nothing that I would seek out, but a safe choice for a six-pack."
"D - I'd prefer my Nugget Nectar...but I love that this is year round...one of my favorites hands down"
"Troegs recently broke into the Boston beer market. I'm pretty happy about that. This one is a really pretty red. Bright amber in color bordering on ruby red, and very clear with rising bubbles. Piney hops up front in the nose with some warm bready malts to back it up. The flavor is a little more laid back, nice doughy malty-ness and a great resiny, juicy hop profile throughout. It tastes great, but the thing that I really love about this beer is the crisp smooth mouthfeel and the lightness on the palate despite lots and lots of flavor. Very refreshing, too. This would be be an easy beer to hammer down while watching a game, or showering, or cleaning the house or whatnot..."
"This is an awesome beer.. I love me some hoppy American Amber's and this is one of the hoppiest. Nice reddish brown color to the pour, tons of head and lacing. Smell is full of citrus hops. Taste is very hoppy but with a nice caramel malty tone. This is a small notch below Ithaca Cascazilla and CBH Abijah Rowe IPA as my favorite beer of all time. Too bad there was only 3 in my variety pack.. it's a kick ass beer. I wish the package store had Nugget Nectar cuz it just sounds like a bad ass version of this one. Awesome mouthfeel and drinkability... fantastic beer."
"Taste is firstly of clean pine hops,"
"After trying the Troegs Nugget Nectar, which I can't get enough of, I was very excited to try another offering from this brewery. The first thing I noticed was the pour...what a beautiful amber sunset color. I then took a big whiff and could smell the hops, which made my mouth water. After the first sip I thought this beer was very good, but the hops didn't grab my tongue like I thought they might given the name. While I consider myself somewhat of a hophead, I didn't mind the mild taste and after a few minutes found myself at the bottom of the glass. I could easily drink these all night and can't wait for my next purchase from Troegs."
"Couldn't help but make a comparison between this and Nugget Nectar. I think they share many similarities, but I think NN edges it out just a bit."
"D: Highly drinkable, even with the hops this is an even balanced amber."
"Great cross between a session beer and a stern IPA. Well-crafted."
"drinkability is high on this one, and well I'm working on #2 and sad its the last one I have"
"Drinkability: This is a decent red that should appeal to hop heads. I would have this again, but will not seek it out."
"A great American amber. Beautiful to behold in the glass. A fragrant and balanced nose. Hops are definitely the star of this amber but the malts are aromatic as well. Taste is big on both sides and once again beautifully balanced. The name is Hopback so you know where the scale tilts. If hops are a love you will not be disappointed. Malty backbone is deep and well crafted as well. Gently carbonated and lightly creamy this is a great one for all around drinking. It goes down so easily and deliciously that you want to session it in spite of it's strength."
"Future outlook: It's slowly becoming clear that I have been too slow to sample the offerings of Troegs, as this is yet another fantastic brew. I would happily purchase again."
"M - Goes down silky smooth and the end of every drink leaves you with a dry mouth feeling that makes you want the next sip."
"This is a very balanced beer and very drinkable. You start and before you know you're almost done. I actually prefer a little less balance when the fist sensation is hops. But for what the beer is - an amber ale - the balance seems appropriate as the beer is never meant to be an in your face IPA. It's on for its style and dangeriously smooth and drinkable."
"An Imperial Amber(if such a thing exists) with strong touches of IPA. This is really like one of the best amber ales I've had, even better than a lot of brewpub hoppy ambers. At 6% I know it doesn't fit the definition of a session beer, but this is totally a session amber I wouldn't mind having again."
"Overall, you can sling these back and enjoy them, if 6% doesn't bite you on the ass first. Great flavors, good texture and scent. I am reviewing this beer based on what it presents, not based upon reputation or what else Troegs brews. I would choose Nugget Nectar over this, but I'm not reviewing Nugget Nectar here. On its own, this beer stands up fine. Very decent and absolutely worth a try."
"Fresh hop taste. Grassy with a touch of orange peel. Again, I like the different flavors in this one. Different, and although it may be an americanized version of the style, I really liked this one. I find this better than other ambers."
"Thanks again to drgonzo3705 for including this in a recent trade. Have heard only good things, and tasted a few from the folks at Tröegs. An aggressive pour yields an off-white, frothy, thick head, about 1"" thick. Its a reddish tinted copper color. I like the apparent hops in the smell, it adds character to a style that sometimes lacks it. The taste is also nice balance between the bitterness of the hops (not overwhelming by any measure) and caramel malt background. Rests easily in your mouth. A well built beer, nothing groundbreaking, but very solid. I wish you could get a beer like this at the ballpark, it seems like it would go well with baseball on a Sunday afternoon."
"Light aroma of grapefruit and pine with some sweet malt to balance it out. This is one hoppy amber ale as the taste starts off with grapefruit taste from the hops with a nice sweet malt taste. A very nice session beer with a good toffee malt taste to balance out the hops."
"This beer poured a pretty medium amber/red. Thin film of an off white head with very little lacing despite vigorous pour. Smell was extremely hoppy, much more so than I expected with a red ale - smell was like an IPA, with scents of sweets malts evening it out. Taste is flavorful of big hops, and sweet malts. The tastes are bold yet well balanced. Mouthfeel is moist, crisp and is extremely smooth with decent carbonation. This is a great beer, completely hit the spot - with Troegs now in the area, this will definitely be a session beer!"
"A good thirst quencher, Tröegs offering will suit a party or gathering where good beer is appreciated, but not the focus."
"the drinkability is very good, it's a little one dimensional, but it realy nails what it's trying to do, and you can't fault it for that. this is one of those beers makes me want to always have a six pack of on hand."
"3.5 D: This is Nugget Nectar after suffering from a debilitating disease for several years. Its not bad by any stretch, but it doesn't stand alone."
"D- I would probably not have this beer again on cask, it was disappointing. I could barely finish my beer. I love this beer out of the bottle, but perhaps because I had it in the bottle, I was expecting something else."
"Drinkability - Very good! The last drink always leaves you wanting another."
"Good mouthfeel, but the finish on this thing demands sip after sip. Could drink it all day."
"Pours a clear amber color with thin off-white head. Has an incredible aroma, bar far the best part of this beer. Hops and citrus with some frutiness. Really nice. Taste is very interesting combination af amber ale and pale ale. Hoppy but still pretty mild, some citrusy and fruity notes as well. Balanced and slightly flat, but still a pretty good beer.. Very drinkable stuff. Great beer!"
"Notes: Had this after the pale ale and was not as impressed as I thought I would be. Still a good brew, but not nearly on par with troeg's other offerings like Nugget Nectar."
"Recommended: Yes!"
"Drinkability: Really high - very refreshing beer."
"drinkability is good. balanced and tasty. good stuff."
"Pours a crystal clear dark amber/orange, medium sized white head forms, settles to a nice thick ring around the glass, keeps a solid layer with some nice retention, looks like a good amber. Smell is alright, sweet and caramelized, some floral, juicy grapefruit and orange peel, sugary malt, honey, bland but very fresh aroma. Taste is sweet at first, caramel and honey, nice floral, sweet orange peel, grapefruit, sugar, nice fruitiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and drinkable, not exciting but theres nothing bad about it."
"Overall, a great amber ale, tops for its style and at 6% fairly easy to drink. Still it kinda hangs in that middle group between malty and hoppy ambers. Yes, its balanced, but usually I am in the mood for one or the other, so I can't say I would reach for this one quite as much as I would a Big Hoppy or a Gaelic Ale."
"12oz. bottle to a pint glass produces an off white one finger head. Beer is crystal clear amber color. Great looking beer. Smell is faint hops, not much else. Taste is a great balance of malt and hops up front, followed by a sweet middle, and a slightly bitter hop finish. Not too heavy, but not too thin. Makes this beer bery drinkable."
"This beer is a great drinkable beer. Is well balanced and goes down easy."
"Very solid beer with hints of Nugget Nectar. I wonder if this was it's grandpa."
"My first beer from Troegs, and I'm not disappointed. A very good beverage, and I hope to trade for more. Thanks again tburkhart! Cheers!"
"D: The balance of this beer makes it very drinkable. It goes down very easy."
"D: Very delicious and refreshing. Could def consume a few of these in a session. The aroma lingers with every exhale. Highly recommended."
"If you like really hoppy beers (without it being extremely hoppy), definitely give this beer a try and if you find it too hoppy at first, let it age a bit. It's well worth the investment!"
"Overall pleasant and drinkable."
"A hoppy amber. Good color - dark gold to copper and a nice thick foam cap and lacing. Lots of hops and a light toasty edge, with some malt coming through in the nose. Flavour is a bit light as is the body - dare I say on the watery side. Nice toasty flavours and a quick hit of hops that don't stick around. Some malt, citrus/pine hops grain and a faint fruitiness. Easy drinking, but the aroma makes promises that are never delivered."
"Notes: reminded my of an ESB not an amber. A decent, highly drinkable beer, but could use a little oomph from more hops and carbonation. FWIW, my wife had one and loved it!"
"Good brew and one fo my top rated active bottled beers for the Amber style."
"Due to the extremely well balanced hoppiness,what could have been a sweet,unexciting brew becomes a lighter,brighter, easy-drinking amber ale. Highly enjoyable, will session this brew any day"
"D - This is one of the finest amber ales around. ANother strong offering from Troegs."
"Poured a deep rich amber color with a finger and a half head that left jagged lacing down the glass. Smell was very good with the hops slapping me in the face. Taste was delicious with hint of pine and grapefruit but nicely balanced. Mouthfeel was slightly oily with a moderately dry finish. Very good beer that could be consumed in quantities."
"Extremely drinkable and a good intro to hops for the hop fearing crowd. Would buy it again in a second."
"Had this on cask recently - it was Chuck Norris worthy."
"Had this on tap at Home Delivery in State College PA. Poured into a pint glass. Moderate head stayed awhile and had a bit of lacing about halfway through. Nice hoppy flavor and amber color. I thought the mouthfeel was good with a smooth drinkability. All in all a nice offering from a cool Pennsylvania brewery."
"Another excellent beer from the people at Troegs. I'm very thankful they started distrubing to Ohio."
"Pours a nice fluffy white head with excellent citrusy smell, grapefruit , lemon and pine coming thru. Taste is more of the same. This beer is well balanced and highly drinkable. The hops are not overpowering and there is nice sweetness as well. Overall excellent."
"I really like this beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth."
"As mentioned already, I had expected a little more of a hop presence given that it's been boasted right there in the name. Nevertheless, this makes a darn nice amber ale, albeit not as good as their Nugget Nectar. Troegs seems to make nothing but darn nice beers and despite not being particularly huge on the style, I could definitely see revisiting this one."
"12 oz bottle from Market of Choice, was very random to find this here in Oregon, but I was happy to give it a shot. Nice amber pour with a moderate tan head. Nice big hoppy flavor which is unusual for the style. Pretty well balanced as well, nice malt flavors. Solid offering though I was expecting a little more from what I have heard about this brewery."
"A deep amber color with a cream colored head about a half inch forms on top. The head laces slowly down the glass, showing tremendous retention. A grassy and citrus fragrance in the first thing that comes out at first scent. That is followed by a sweet scent that comes in in feintly at the end. A surprisingly hearty malt flavor at the front, then it is overtaken by the hops. The hops bring on a conglomerant of flavors, from grapefruit, grass, earthiness, and slight saltiness at the end. A very consistant mouthfeel, medium bodied all the way through, with the cleansing sensation of carbonation at the end. This is a fairly good beer, very strong flavor and consistant mouthfeel, along with the six percent ABV, makes this a great choice for a session beer."
"Drinkability's high, as I would thoroughly enjoy a session with this beer. I can't believe fans of Celebration ale aren't gobbling this up for the nine months out of the year they can't get the former. For my part this ranks in the top three for session beers. Why have I not gotten into this brewery sooner? Onward to Troegenator!"
"This could easily become a regular in my rotation; alas, the closet place to purchase this is in the Cincinnati, Ohio area. This is my first offering from this brewery, and I hope it is not the last."
"Excellent job on this distinctive effort by Troegs, borders on outstanding, and a must try."
"Pours a nice ruby orange with a fizzy head that disappears quickly with minimal lacing. Aroma is strong with pungent caramel malt. Taste is a balance of pure hop flavor with the sweet, biscuity malt behind it. The balance is very nice with just enough bitterness to it. Mouthfeel is the same as their Dopplebock, but more appropriate for this kind of style and makes it very drinkable. This stuff just started getting distributed around here and I was excited to see it but it's not as overwhelmingly amazing as I had anticipated. This particular beer was really nice on tap and I think they need to change their water treatment when dealing with different styles but this one is overall very pleasant and sweet and easy to drink."
"I am so excited that we recently learned that Troeg's is coming to MA!!"
"well if you like hops and troegs then this is the one. slightly brown copper in color. a nice grapefruit aroma once poured and sniffed. a nice hop flavor once swalloed. could drink many in the summer and actually all year long. bottle is just as good as the draft since i can get it fresh from the brewery."
"Drinkability. Solid, hoppy ale."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Thanks Sean for this!"
"D: Great beer. Best enjoyed as fresh as possible for max aroma."
"Drinkability isn't too bad, back in my PA days I'd always bogart this sixer in the sample case. Years later, this revisit is a bit underwhelming, but it's still a good example of the style no question (really more a matter of me moving beyond ambers)."
"D- what a great red ale, no wonder it's their flagship beer. mellow enough to not be overwhelming, and if you're like me it would be no problem having a nice session with this 6% abv ale. no desire for a different brand tonight (even santa's private reserve!)."
"D - Great example of a amber ale, another Troeg great"
" This would be best for the times of the year that are transitional - late fall or early spring. It's too heavy for a warm summer day and doesn't have enough alcohol or roastiness for a cold winter's day. It's a bit too strong too for session beer drinking (technically), even though I could see myself having a few of these in one sitting. This is a textbook brew when it comes to balance and depth - neither too much nor too little. Until my favorite Amber Ale comes out in late February, this will more than suffice!"
"This is a great session ale. Great interplay between bitter and sweet and impossibly easy to drink."
"Drinkability of this beer is excellent - expertly balanced with an extremely clean bitterness and hop flavor. Overall a very clean beer with a nice hop aroma and well-structured flavor."
"Picked up a sixer of this on sale at the local beer mart. Heard some good things about this brewery. I am an avid hop fan so this is a perfect amber ale for me. Color is clear amber and poured into a pint glass resulted in a gorgeous 1"" thick creamy head that stuck around for more than half the glass. Left heavy lacing on the glass. Smell is that of hops (YEAH!!) and caramel malt. Taste is exceptional. WOW, I didn't expect this beer to be so good. This satisfied my hop cravings. Taste of caramel with a backround or citrusy hops. I would almost classify this as an IPA, if the hops was any stronger. Mouthfeel is very smooth and above average. This is the kind of beer I can drink a few of. I definatly found a new regular in my fridge."
"Very drinkable beer. Nice and hoppy for an amber. I am a big fan."
"Clear amber with a creamy off-white head. Smells of sugary hop flowers...perfumy, soft, and floral. Fresh grainy aromas increase as it warms. Oily hop flavor, spicy citrus, flowers, and light grain. Melon-like fruit flavor and some leafiness. Medium bodied, coating mouthfeel. Solid bitterness. A nice introduction to the world of Tröegs. If I could get this around these parts I'd pick it up every once in a while."
"D: This is one of those beers where I fail to see what the big deal is. Not a bad beer as such, but taste-wise a little underwhelming."
"Drinkability - Good. It's well balanced and not boozy at all, but there's plenty of flavor."
"Poured a clear orange amber with a small off white head. Aroma is hoppy and citric with a good malt presence. Incredible balance. These days its hard to find a beer that isn't a hop bomb. This is perfect! Just enough hops to say its hoppy and a great malty backbone. The flavor is wonderfully floral and citric with a nice hint of caramel. There is a nice fruity twang to this. Feel is kinda tingly from the carbonation but overall very smooth. If presented with a six pack of this i would drink the entire thing. Perfectly balanced, perfectly drinkable."
"D- This beer does not pronounce itself intensely in any one area. It is, however a beer that that's nearly perfectly balanced. The hops are present but not overly bitter, the malts pronounced yet not overly sweet. Troegs has produced a beer that I can drink when I simply want something of a high level of quality and refreshment. Definitely a beer I would recommend as a session."
"Serving type: 1/2 pint glass"
"12oz bottle. Pours amber wit off-white head. Aroma is floral hops, caramel malt and citrus. Flavor is hoppy with notes of citrus and pine with nice caramel malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Nice hoppy amber ale. Very good session ale. Thanks to abcfan for this one."
"Poured an orange brown color into a glass with some lacing on the glass. Had a slightly nutty aroma. The flavor was more of the same nutty character of the malt, that was slightly sweet, with a slight hops bitterness. Low on the carbonation, and a bit of a slick mouthfeel, both of which I thought were a good thing. I like this."
"This ale has a deep, rich, amber color that's partly cloudy, with very light head. It smells of sweet malts and clean crisp hops. The taste is a little, sweet, a little bitter, and a little bready. Nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is good. Light/medium in body with just enough carbonation. This is such a refreshing and crisp beer. I love the clean hoppy bittery taste."
" I enjoyed this beer and would not hesitate to try others from Tröegs."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly astringent, perhaps a touch of tartness found after the sweet, caramel and biscuit move away from the front of the palate. Definite bitter bite keeps the beer in check but this could be even more bitter, in my opinion."
"Overall, a great concoction of an amber ale with a hoppy kick. You'll impress a few people if you bring this along to a gathering."
"Pours a copper red into a goblet with minimal lacing that quickly dissipates and leaves no lacing. Aroma is of cherry jolly ranchers, pine cones, and a bit of maltiness. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied with good carbonation, a good feel. Taste is piney hops up front, some good malt balance, orange, pine cones, with some hop bitterness through the sip, but lingers in the finish. As it warms, it mellows out to a very well-balanced brew. Drinkability is high. My experience with hoppier beers is limited, but this is a good one which I may be inclined to revisit."
"Poured a nice coppery red with a one finger head, and the lacing was watery but consistent. Smelled like pine air freshener with a hint of sweetness. More pine in the taste with an artificial citrus twang. Not seeing the ""spicy taste and rich caramel note"" advertised on the bottle. More like cardboard actually. Based on that description it sounds pretty bad, but it's not because all of the flavors are so muted. Mouthfeel is decent, and it goes down well without leaving a bad aftertaste, but too bland for my smoker's palate."
"o:very drinkable but i would appreciate more carbonation and more hop sharpness. i'm not sure if the water profile is responsible for this or if the hopback technique contributes. a little too dull on the tongue. i've had this before and didn't notice this. maybe my beer is older but i don't notice oxidation. very simple and hop profile is not complex (except for the simcoe hint)."
"Drinkability: I was pretty underwhelmed by this beer, but I think I may have gone into it expecting, as one friend puts it, ""baby Nugget Nectar," which I'm a huge fan of. Maybe I got an old bottle, and I'll be more than happy to try this again when it's perhaps fresher, but the flavors just didn't seem as vibrant or bright as I had hoped or expected them to be. That being said, it's not a bad beer, and it's drinkability is pretty good - well-hidden alcohol of a manageable level - so give it a shot."
"Overall: next"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Finish on this one is semi-dry and body is medium. Pretty average, carbonation doesn't overstep its boundaries. There is nothing here that really grabs my attention. I often feel that mouthfeel is the hardest to give a score to since it is either on or off. I mean if you have a RIS that is super carbonated then well I'd give it a 1, if there's a Light Macro with no carbonation then I'd give it a 1. For me its extremes...the beer either has a good mouthfeel or it doesn't, it is either really poor, where it should be, or it is something totally unexpected that just blows the mind. This one is where it should be. Easy drinking brew, one that I could easily drink all night, given I'm in a hoppy mood. As the weather gets colder it seems I'm more into a porter/stout mood. Still this is one that I'd not hesitate to pick up again. Not bitter like an IPA, really balanced between malt and hops in that aspect, but the taste of the beer is all about hops. Pretty cool beer, like a quasi IPA but without the bitterness. I feel that this one might be one that someone who doesn't like IPAs but likes nicely balanced beers such as browns, ESBs, etc would like."
"Eric"
"Cheers"
"It is not my favorite from Troegs (Nugget Nectar is), but is very pleasing nonetheless."
"Worth a try and dead on for the style."
"This is a terrific amber form Troegs. I could drink these all night."
"D: This is the best Troegs I have had and will certainl pick up a case when in Pa (as if I could get anything less) A nice refreshing new style that I originally thought was going to a different take on a pale ale. Again, the hops are balances to perfection, yet you still enjoy a robust flavor following by the sweetness to your tongue."
"Poured into a 12 oz glass. Good head retention that fades to nice lacing down to the last swallow. Nice nutty brown color, with visible carbonation. Not much malt smell but a citrusy hops aroma is apparent, but there's a bready malt taste that's quickly run off by the citrusy hops with a dry yet sweet somewhat fruity finish. A good beer all around. Ciao!"
"Thanks to CrazyMacHarris for the sample."
"This is a beautiful Ale that is crisp and malty with huge hop flavor and hints of caramel that aren't too rich. The bite makes it refreshing while the spice and texture make it a good cold-weather beer as well. Phenomenal on tap but holds up well in a bottle."
"Troegs HopBack - You are tried and true."
"D: Yes. I think as an Amber ale at a micro, I'd get this again. In the bottle 08-20-08, very fresh tasting."
"Overall impression: A well balanced, straight forward Amber. A little less carbonation would put this over the top. Nicely done."
"D: A very nice smooth drinking beer that is very sessionable. I don't get bored with this beer even after drinking the entire 2 liter growler. A good ""flagship"" beer for the Troegs Brewery. Nice work Chris & John... keep it up!"
"This is a solid beer all around. I think I read somewhere that Nugget Nectar is an amped-up version of Hopback, and I can believe it. However, this beer certainly has its own, distinct identity. It's a great beer for really any occasion. If you like a tasty amber ale with a nice hoppy kick, then this is your beer. Recommended."
"This beer pours a dark cloudy amber with 1 fingered head and lacing. The smell is of nuts and citrusy hops. The taste is wonderful, one of the best amber ale I have ever tried. A wonderful balance between nut flavor, citrusy hops and malts. Trully an amazing balance between the three. The mouthfeel is nice and the carbonation level seems nice. A very drinkable beer and a great session beer imo"
"Superb drinakability, a nice amber to session on"
"D--drinkable but NOT a hoppy beer. I kind of think that its false advertising. They should change the name to indicate this is more of a red ale."
"Pours a nice medium brilliant hue amber. Head is medium/small with minimal lacing. Smell is floral, sweet and of course hoppy. Given the name I would expect a much stronger hop flavor but the hops don't hit until the finish. A bit of spice and medium maltiness. Mouthfeel is about what I expected for an amber ale. Drinkability is still high as this is a high quality beer."
"Overall-Well balanced, leaning hoppy. An excellent example of a contemporary American amber."
"I think the real craft in all their brews is this creaminess. Cudos. I will buy it again."
"Pretty nice beer, I like hops and this delivers, especially for a amber. Could drink this all night probably, haven't caught on tap or even in bottles though."
"Pours a ruby brown in color that is translucent. About quarter inch of head/froth forms on the pour. Smell is a nice balance. First all malt, then deeper some hops appear. There's also some sort of spice notes as well. Taste is very resinous. Not overly bitter, but hop flavor. Don't know how to exactly describe it. Plenty of a malt backbone to support it. This is different than anything I've had of the style. Decent mouthfeel, but a tad cloying. Glad to see Troegs in Ohio."
"Overall, I used the word ""average"" a lot because I can't think of any other word to describe. The born on date is 8/12/08 so I know it is fresh. I guess this just isn't the beer for me."
"six from Whole Foods Vienna, bottled 08/04/08, consumed in my hotel in Hampton"
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a SA pint glass. It poured a dark amber color with a solid 1/2 head. As the head settled it left nice rings of lacing on the sides. The boquet was hoppier than I was expecting. This brew has a pleseant pine and citrus aroma. The hops are tasted immediately but are very mellow, it leaves a sweet after taste. This beer is a bit on the thin side, but it goes down easily. Troegs has another very solid beer here."
"D: Very drinkable. Certainly doesn't taste or feel like a 6 percent beer."
"This was part of my Troegs sampler case which did not have a bad beer in it. Poured from bottle into pint glass, was light brown with gold hues, a small head that reduced to a minimal sheen with heavy lacing. Smelled like sweet malts and hops. It had a mild hoppy tastewith a sweet malty finish. This is a very pleasnt drinkable beer. I look forward to my next sampler case so I can drink 3 more of these."
"The feel is thick and chewy, creamy and viscous. Really good. It's a bold and challenging drink. Smooth, dark and bitter. Quite nice."
"I usually go for this beer when I see it on tap - it is nice and bitter but with plenty of balance to make it interesting."
"overall, another greatly drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The carbonation is tight and active, becoming better with a few swishes in the mouth. A bigger amber ale with some serious character... not recommended as a session beer but strongly suggested with food or just to admire a well balanced, bold example of this style."
"You are something special. Within a style that never becomes overly daring, the Hopback defies all tame stereotypes and leads the way for its luster lacking brethren. Wet, oily, bitter-sweet roast. Malt sweet, hop bitter, expressed in its truest form...the edge factor, an emphasis on the hop. Malt cannot be jealous; the sweet syrup remains long after initial contact. An admirable balance of opposites. Something good was just made better."
"Pours a very nice deep amber color with some very good head and nice lacing. Excellent scent, very well balanced with a nice deep malty tone as well as a great floral hoppy scent. Excellent taste, very well done; it has the deep earthy amber ale malt with a wonderful hoppy/bitter flavor and great bitter/floral aftertaste. It goes down very well, a great beer."
"D: Still one of my favorite hoppier beers, hands-down. A treat on tap, but good out of the bottle."
"Another beer I picked up on a visit to Cranberry Township PA,that I don't believe is available around here. Pours a deep golden amber with a thin white head. Decent rention and very good laceing. Aroma is malty,and yeasty with a hint of grasy hops. Taste is a really good balance of malt and hops. Smooth finish."
"A light, amber ale with hop-attack for flavor and my mouth is watering. Slight bubbles rest on the tongue but aren't obnoxious which allow the palate to enjoy this refreshing, dry brew. Great syrupy color with a taste that would make Aunt Jemima dirty her pants. Slight taste of spices but don't take away from the hops. A bitter,dry aftertaste that lingers for a minute and then dissapates readying you for the next sip. A great in between amber ale and pale ale beer. Best of both worlds captured in a satisfying drink."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a brown/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is caramel malt and citrusy (grapefruit) and pine hops. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like caramel malt and bread/dough, along with the grapefruit and piney hops. It starts off sweet, and then has a nice bitter hoppy finish. Good balance, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and slick, but also crisp. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth and I think it would be a pretty good choice as a session brew. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Very drinkable, and nicely balanced for a ""hoppy"" beer. My second offering from Troegs (thanks to Jason) and as equally impressive as the first. Anyone in PA want to make some trades?"
"A must in anyone's rotation."
"Served in a nonic. Poured a translucent copper with a half-inch bright white head that dissipated to half its size within seconds before settling into a clumpy field of foam. Some scattered specks of lacing present during the tasting. Strong scent of hops and caramel. Taste consistent with nose; however, sweet character is a bit more subdued by the hops presence. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a pleasant effervescence across the tongue. Hops bitterness at the finish is substantially cut by the caramel flavoring. The balance this brew struck between sweet and bitter made this quite drinkable."
"Good mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Pretty good, one of the hoppier amber ales I've had."
"Pours a clear, deep amber with a small bubbly off-white head that shows decent retention and leaves only a hint of lacing. Smell is big on floral hops with a big pine presence on top of a sweet caramel malt base. The taste is a slightly more balanced version of the smell with a more subdued floral and pine hop kick up front that is balanced really well by the sweet caramel malts. Mouthfeel is medium and very creamy with good carbonation and only the slightest hop bitterness. This is a very well balanced amber with just the right amount of hops to give it a good kick. Very nice."
"Lively mouthfeel - carbonation came through even though it didn't have much of a head. Overall, I enjoyed the draft version much better - bottled version does not showcase the hop flavors as well, but still a very drinkable beer."
"Overall - Well balanced, well crafted, awesome! I really, really, like this one"
"Drink em if ya got em...."
"had this as a hand pump at Zeno's in State College. I have had many of these beers out of the bottle at home - but the bartender said the nitro was 10X better - and i have to admit, he was totally right. wow! this is something else. looked great but the smell is amazing - triple the hop smell than from the bottle - as goes the taste as well. there is so much more hop nose and flavor it is amazing. if you get a chance to try this beer in hand pump, do it!"
"Overall this is another quality brew by Troegs, but it doesn't stand out in a crowd. I think the Pale Ale has more hops body to it, but this is a very balanced leaning on the maltier side brew. One reviewer labled this Nugget Nectars little brother, but for me that's far from the truth. The NN is a entire different animal, but one that I love."
"This beer has good color as well as a very well balance of malt and hops. Very drinkable beer. The hops stand out, but are not in your face. Finish is smooth with a pleasant bitterness that lasts into the afetrtaste. A nice beer to sit and enjoy the lovely day with."
"Drinkability: Good beer with nice balance. Hops and malt combine very well. This is a good beer that you could easily drink several of."
"This is a dark amber/copper colored beer with a finger and a half o tight white head. Smells cof citrus hops and slightly piney as well with sweat rosted carmal malts. Citrus juicy flavor followed by a oiney sting with sweet carmaled malts all the way through. Its a very ballanced flavor. Medium bodied feel good on the palet and it pretty drinkable. Would be a good session beer."
"Side note: Thinking this could be the perfect gateway beer... My 'value beer' buddy (read ""keep it < $20/case"") recently declared this his new absolute favorite beer, worth paying real money for."
"D - Not your typical hop heavy brew... This is much more complex and balanced... Highly enjoyable and well crafted..."
"Somewhat smooth feel, moderate-medium body for amber, but still feels a little thin. Very drinkable amber."
"Flavor is a smooth and spicy amber hop experience. Caramel malty sweetness balances nicely with toasted grains."
"Drinkability: Fantastic session beer. VERY easy to drink and very enjoyable. This is a delightful beer to drink in the spring on the back deck."
"D: Very drinkable beer. It's hoppy and enjoyable without the in-your-face bitterness one would expect from a beer with such hop content. Some ambers can be a bit too sweet or cloying, but Hopback amber provides a wonderful drinking experience."
"Tasty and pretty big for amber, but it's no where near as good as its bigger brother, Nugget Nectar. Also, that off off-putting quality in the finish has me detracting points and is keeping me from really enjoying this and wanting another. Drinkability suffers some for that."
"D: Very drinkable, and a very safe beer to drink. If you're into hops... this is a very nice but not completely overwhelming beer. Highly recommended."
"D - A very easy drinking tasty amber. I could easily go through a 6 pack. I think I actually prefer this to Nugget Nectar"
"D: I wish I had picked up more than 2 of these while I was in VA!"
"Hopback pours a beautiful cloudy dark copper with an ample beige head. Smell is not very pronounced, just floral hops with a faint hint of malt. It tastes of hops and malts and is kind of woody. It's rather bitter. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and thickness is perfect. This is a very drinkable beer; not heavy and full of hops."
"This is my first sample of anything from Troegs but i really like the mouthfeel and flavor and the way it finishes."
"Overall a go to beer. AAlways some in the fridge and it is a beer you can always trust to be great. Get it."
"Thanks to Pete for bringin this back from PA! Poured into a shaker pint. Beautiful ruby/mahogany color with a tan fluffy head. Wonderful hop aromas- piney, flowery. Great biting flavor for an amber. No bland malt bomb here. Wonderful balance with the right amount of caramel and toffe flavored malts backing up the hop kick. Very drinkable- I have found another favorite from Troegs!!"
"Notes: It seemed something was missing?,perhaps a bit more hop or some more malts. I suppose that one could easily appreciate this beer for what it is,but did I hear someone say pass me a Roxy? (just kidding) I liked it and I will buy it again."
"If you're a raging hophead like me, you'll love this brew. If not, I feel like you still might be able to enjoy it. Or maybe I'm just used to hops. I don't know. Maybe have a few more moderately hopped beers before this one, but even then, HopBack can bridge the gap to even hoppier beers than itself"
"D- easy to put a sixer of this down during a Steeler game. this is a beer to enjoy during a football game."
"Maybe Troegs should initiate a new beer style, RPA for Red Pale Ale?"
"i could drink several of these i'm glad i can get them fairly locally. another fine offering from the troegs brewery."
"Overall one of the best amber ales I've tasted. I'm not a big fan of the style but I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"Still, an outstanding example of the malty pale and amber ales beloved by Pennsylvania brewers. This is a beer I will go back to as often as I can."
"Delightfully balanced between the floral and herbal hops, and the roasted malts. Slight bitter finish, but nothing unbearable. Overall a gold-star effort from Troegs, and a highly drinkable amber beer."
"D - Bring it on! This has been one of my favorites for a while, and certainly a worthy year-round beer for Troegs' portfolio. I can drink this any time. Perfect balance of malts and hops in this one."
"D: Excellent drinkability, I like it not as cold though"
"MF&D - This slightly oily, medium bodied ale coats the mouth well. Highly recommended."
"A great beer. Despite having a huge blast of hops, this beer mellows out wonderfully. Totally stoked that I can pick up a sixer of this just down the block"
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. Toned down, almost session-liker version of Nugget Nectar."
"This is a realy good beer. I'd have to say it's my favorite American Amber Ale. The hops are lively but not overpowering, giving a little spice with it. Smooth and highly drinkable. Recommended."
"MF&D- Really good medium bodied beer that drinks very smooth. Slight oily mouthfeel that is typical of the hoppy beers. My second selection from Troegs (first one was Nugget Nectar) and I am very impressed. Look forward to the rest of the sampler that I bought."
"I'm sure many would disagree, but it's like the malts are the feature here, their candy-like, somewhat gooey syrup sweetness making this far more drinkable than it would've been if the hops had their way entirely. But hopheads could never dislike this. A supremely balanced beer, and pretty freaking delicious too."
"Yet another tradeshow sample, this beer. I enjoyed the dark color and creamy head that it produced. It was a tad heavy, meaning that It was to be savoured, like a good wine. Obviously the hops were very pronounced, which wins a spot high on my list(I greatly enjoy the bite of the hops). It was smooth and had a tiny bit of an aftertaste, but by no means was it too much to enjoy. I did like this beer, but would like it much better if I had tiem to savor it better."
"D- I could have many of these in a sitting. This one really surprised me. I loved it!"
"Notes: My first offering from Troeg's, I grabbed this at a Bev Ctr on the side of Route 17 in NJ. Was hoping they'd have Nugget Nectar, but this was a worthy substitute at around $8 a sixer."
"D: A great drinking hopped amber that is case worthy by all means. One that is very enjoyable in multiples and hard to tire of."
"surprisingly, this pours darker than it's big brother nugget nectar, and darker than most amber/reds. mahogany in color with nice clarity, and a dissipating off-white head and lacing. nose is somewhat subdued, although caramel, dark fruit, and roasted nuts are present. lacks any citric hop character. decent dark maltiness in the taste with a smooth hop bitterness underneath. good but not great. medium-bodied with a nicely carbonated mouthfeel. sessionable at this abv."
"D: I have been extremely impressed with Troegs beers. This is no exception. A very sessionable American Amber. Troegs does an excellent job of balancing their beers. The 6.0 ABV on top of everything else makes this a very sessionable beer."
"Very good beer, great hops taste. Along the lines of an, like Hop Devil or Hoptical Illusion. Appearance was almost perfect, copper color. Smell was almost perfect as well. Taste was a 4/5 - a bit more bite than even a high hop should have, but could have been the 6 pack I bought (nothing wrong with a 4 out of 5 at all, just pointing out why it wasn't a 5/5). Would love to try this on tap, I bet it is even better."
"D: Taste just isnt there to carry this beer for me."
"I have always been interested in Troegs beers, and that interest exponentially grew after I visited the brewery. I have always liked Troegs hopback amber b/c of the hopiness and well balanced flavors. Then I went and got a sample straight from the brewery and what a difference. The flavors are much more distinct and come through much brighter. It has 55 IBU's according to Troegs but it is masked very well with their signature amber ale style. Wonderful color, cream-white head, and super easy to drink...a lot."
"Rich amber pour with a small offwhite head and a balanced nose of hops and malt. Found it a bit watery and slightly thin, but with a decent balanced flavor and what seemed to be some alcohol peeking through. Nice and drinkable, but not quite what I was expecting."
"D_A stellar brew and one I will be picking up at the corner store more often. This is a well rounded brew with complexity but one that does not overwhelm the senses."
"Deep amber with a brown hue topped by a quickly fading light tan head. Nose has some caramelized British malts and some fruity aromatic qualities of mild American hops and a nutty hint as well. Slightly over carbonated. The flavor has a light fruity hop touch upfront with dried orange peel followed by a nutty character. The finish has a dark toastiness and a prolonged bitterness. Pretty good American Amber."
"D- Good drinkability, one could sit and have a few of these back to back."
"Drinkability - Not exactly everything I had hoped for. More amber than hoppy. A decent beer and one I wouldn't mine trying again a little further down the road."
"A nice ruby amber color with a creamy off-white head that left a sticky trail all the way done the glass. The aroma is heavily floral and pine-like hops. The strong floral hops coat the mouth and dominate the flavor. There is a slight hint of sweet malt to provide some balance. Drinkable on whole, but I would prefer a bit more malt balance ."
"M + D: Medium body, a little slick, with a nice lingering effect. Tasty + a reasonably low ABV means I'll have a few of these this evening. The Troegs seem to have a gift for good brews... the more I have from the brewery, the more fond of it I become."
"D: Another winner from Troegs. This beer is a great amber with a kick of hops that is very drinkable."
"D: This is a good, balanced amber ale. Nothing overwhelming, but definitely possessing a pleasing taste and worthy of a second sampling."
"Single 12 oz bottle purchased from Gary's in Madison... from what I understand, this is supposed to be the ""younger brother"" of Troegs Nugget Nectar, which I recently sampled, and was excellent... this bottle, however, didn't quite live up to its hype... A very impressive dark, ruby-red, almost purple appearance led to an immense frothy and foamy head that soon receded... smell carried slight amber notes with hops, grains, and slight malts, and the taste strongly mirrored a classic Amber style with a nice balance of bitter and sweet along with apparent grapefruit and citrus essences... pretty good, rich mouthfeel with an equally good level of drinkability made a nice sample, but nothing above and beyond..."
"Troegs has a good reputation for their beers and this is no exception. Good Beer"
"Not very noticeable are the malts. I get some caramel sweetness but overall the hops take control. Now this is a very drinkable beer however I was looking for some more malt to balance this one a bit more. It is very refreshing and happened to pair well with a beef, mushroom, and barley soup."
"Not a big fan of hoppy ambers, this had a lot bold flavors, nice beer, but I won't be getting it again."
"Excellent drinkability."
"D:This would be an excellent session beer. Welcome to NY Troegs."
"Good beer. Nice experiment in styles. I'd definitely drink this again."
""
"The beer pours out a deep amber color with an alright head, nothing crazy. The first thing that hits your nose is a mild, piney, citrus hops scent. The taste is very smooth. The malt, hops, caramel all blend together perfectly. The drinkability for me is very high. This is probably one of my favorite session beers out there right now."
"T:pretty good beer it is very well balanced there is definitely a malt profile i know it is called hopback, but hops are not prominent. Its a good beer that meets the requirement for the style, its not a beer that will knock you off your feet...however i have bought and consumed many of them its a very good beer"
"Pours a reddish-amber with a good deal of bubbles slowly climbing to the top of the glass. head is off-white and looks about like the consistency of frothed milk. Leaves some thick, raised rings of lace with each sip. Aroma is very toasty with a really sweet malt backing. There's a good deal of fruity esters and citrus/pine hops in the nose as well. Flavor has a solid caramel malt base with loads of toasted malt character (crystal malt?). The hops bring herbal and citric notes to the fore in the middle of each sip. There isn't much bitterness here, rather just a good, solid hop profile. Finishes a touch sweet with a little bit of diacetyl. Mouthfeel is really silky, solid, and smooth in the carbonation. Nice drinker overall, and surely one of the better ambers I've ever come across."
"D - Almost too good, this beer vanished so quickly it made me paranoid. Someone must've been sneaking sips when I wasn't looking. Great beer that redeemed this brewery for me, prior to this I wasn't very impressed with Troegs. I take it all back, big reco here!"
"Clear coppery colour with a thin, sticky beige cap. Good head retention, lots of lacing. Hoppy aroma, citrusy and spicy for the most part, but with a bit of malt and grassiness too. Solid malt backbone on this one, balancing the mellow bitterness and hop presence. Spicy hops dominate, with notes of citrus, floral and grassy hops throughout. Ends with a spicy, orange flavour that has a bit of sweetness to it. Medium bodied, just short of average carbonation, really nice texture, just a bit of creaminess and warmth. I've really been impressed with Troegs lately and have enjoyed their beers quite a lot. There's a lot of flavour here, but balanced isn't sacrificed. Great stuff!"
"D: pretty good, I am not a hop head but I think a hop bomb in this thing would make for a well rounded hop experience. I wouldn't buy this one again but would def. drink it again."
"I was able to get this Tröegs beer at High Street Grill on 1/20/2008. They served it to me in a Tröegs pint glass. It poured a dark amber that looked like it blended in with some cranberry red. It had a 1 inch head of white foam that quickly receded into a handful of white foamy rings and a few streaks of white lace. It had a mild fruit based aroma that contained caramel malts, a dash of pepper, and few bitter hops. The taste was refreshing with the taste of juicy fruits, toasted malts, splash of pine, hint of caramel, and dry roasted citrus hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a good aftertaste of fruits and piny hops. I had this beer on tap and in bottles before. The draft version is much better than the bottled version. If you ever see this on tap at your local bar, you should try a glass of this beer for youeself. It won't let you down."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This would be a great beer to start off your friends that aren't quite ready for IPA'S/DIPA'S."
"Would go good with Mexican or spicy Mediterranean fair."
"D- A very nice beer. A managable ABV(6%) and very good for a session beer."
"Re-reviewed one month later: I added another half point to the aroma. Pure delight and it should definitely be listed as an IPA. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and this beer is less medium bodied than I originally reviewed. Overall, the beer is great!"
"Drinkability: High drinknability. The theme of these troegs beers thus far is BALANCE. This is a wonderfully balanced and drinknable, rich ale. Try their sample pack!"
"This is a great brew, great balance between the hops and the finish. This is definitely one that I will have again."
"Pours nearly crystal clear amber/reddish in color. Lower carbonation and thin white head. Smells very fresh and inviting. Juicy citrus hops and a biscuity malt backbone. Taste follows suit but doesn't quite live up to the smell. Orange, tangerine, light grapefruit hops and a nice caramel and sweet malt backbone. Toasted bread like malt, too. Good slightly bitter mouthfeel. Pretty darn drinkable but not a favorite. The Nugget Nectar is amazing when I compare the two but it is what it is..."
"This is a great cask beer. I have had the bottled version before and was not as impressed by its flavor then. It was good but on the hand pump this blew me away. If you find it cask, don't pass it up this up."
"D- Very drinkable, could of had a few of these, but I had already had a few and had to drive. It seemed like a session-able hoppy ale."
"A tiny bit of carbonated sharpness accompanies the minute sweetness that leads in the taste. A healthy biscuit malt backbone is rounded out by those fresh earthy / grassy hops and a bit of spiciness. A fresh and medium bodied creaminess completes this enjoyable and elegant brew. A very well-balanced and tasty amber from Troegs."
"Too many American ambers/red ales seem to cross that APA/IPA line with extreme hopping. This beer however, stays true to its ale roots. The hops are there, for sure, but the taste and drinking experience still says ""Ale!"". One of my favorites."
"Pours a nice clear red hued brown. Minimal head. Nose is like vibrant cherries, but not extremely pungent really. Flavor is nice and woody in a milder way. Hops are present in a leafy and slightly almost smoked way. Medium level sweet edge to it. Very smooth and consistent flavor. Feel has a fairly full level of carbonation sending tiny bubbles over my tongue. Liquid has a good body. Overall very drinkable. Extremely smooth and even, though the sweet kick on the tail end seems slightly out of place."
"Pours a nice amber color with a good white head that hung around for a while. Aroma is hoppy and begs you to drink it. Flavor is of caramel that is balanced by the hoppiness. This is smooth and drinkability is high. This improved drastically as it warmed. This is a nice beer. Will have again."
"D: Tasty, sessionable. As simple as that."
"D: Darn good & also sessionable. With plenty of malt and hop flavor, there's something to enjoy for people on both sides of the spectrum."
"Pours a clear ruby brown color with a rather small head that left some lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is piney and citrus hops. The taste starts off with a nice light piney hop flavor that is quickly balanced by a sweet malt presence, almost root beer like. No real strong flavors but a good balance between the hops and malt. The feel is light with moderate carbonation, finishes well balanced. A real good sessionable brew."
"Good across the board! Bottled 09.27.07 etched in bottle. Poured a pretty clear brownish red into my Sam Adams glass. 2 fingers of frothy, glittery head. Very nice crisp hop nose with the same crisp hop flavor in the mouth. Very balanced malt flavor, extremely easy drinking."
"D = Definitely a drinkable beer but not at the top of my list for the style."
"D - This was a good beer. It has a powerful hop bite for a red ale but I was impressed by the hops and amber flavor combonation. I would buy this beer again."
"Overall: Troegs make great beer and this one is just that. Perfectly balanced beer that has an even level of hops and malt. The taste is just so mild yet perfect. Really nice beer would love to sit down with a 12 pack turn on the NFL Sunday ticket and drink until the games were over or until I was drunk whichever happened to come first."
"Drinkability- Balance? Check! Good ABV? Check! Flavorful? Check! This is exactly what I look for when wanting to swill some terrific beer while watching football. I really enjoyed this beer a lot and cant wait to finish the last one. Big thanks to Leftmindedrighty!"
" Smells dominated by pine and citrus with a floral hint . Taste is a nice combo of sweet malts to balance out the piney hops. The seperation here from being an ipa is the toned down finish , it's more creamy and mellow without the bitter finish. Easy drinking and very inviting."
"D - Very good beer that shines when on cask (as most beers do IMHO) could drink this multiple times without hesitation. A solid offering from Troegs."
"very good taste = very good drinkability in my book."
"Another goodie from TroegsI really could not wait. This one poured a nice light amber color, with the tiniest hint of an orange hue. Deep carbonation came up from the bottom of the glass only to reinforce the large head of white stick and foamy lace that formed on the top. Great retention finally gave way to copious side glass lace and a nice little film across the top. The smell was deeply hopped. Very nice bouquet of floral hops, lots of pine and citrus notes accentuating a typical amber back, nicely malted with large hints of grains. The flavor was so much hoppier then I had thought it would be. There was a huge citrus hop punch from the very first sip and a very nice resin like taste that followed you throughout the session leaving behind a great dry and bitter finish. Great use of the hops here as the typical amber will have more of the malty character, which was still evident in the underlying base here, however the big hop presence not only balanced it well, but pushed it over to the lighter side and gave it much more of a bright feel. Great smooth and light body with ample carbonation led this to be an easy session beer. Overall I had honestly never heard of this one before I got it and it was truly wonderful. This was a great beer and something I would like to see more of, a nice, well rounded amber that could hold its own with a lot of sessionable IPAs. Definitely have to recommend this one."
"A little hazy, and on the darker side of light amber (?) with an off whitte head that dissipates pretty quick but leaves nice lace. Nose is hoppier than expected, and I did expect hop, but the nice herbal, pine, citrus smell is balanced out by a sweet malt scent in the background. It's also a little spicy... maybe some ginger and white pepper. Taste is really nice with a pretty light medium body that is very soft. It really delivers a much more balanced taste tha nthe nose would suggest. Very clean. Great for an all day/session drink."
"D- Good and definitely an interesting take on the style. If this had a little more in the mouthfeel department, this would be a real winner. Worth a try without a doubt."
"drinkability: Very drinkable. I love Hops so i am in Heaven"
"Complex, but well balanced. Flavorful, but not overpowering. Hops and sweet roasted malts both shine. Easy to drink - complex and flavorful enough to keep your attention, but not overpowering enough to burn you our. Very good with food. This may be my new go to everyday/session beer. Recommended."
"Poured a deep amber with a thin light tan head. The aroma was muted somewhat, but I expected that since it seems to be what I encounter with cask ales. There was some hops (pine and lemon zest) and some sweet malts. Touch of fruitiness. The flavor seemed like a blended version of the bottles I have had previously. It was good, but nothing really stood out. Towards the bottom third of the glass I did notice more of the hops in the taste and the sweetness faded some. Creamy cask-conditioned feel to it. Overall, it was a good beer, but I think I prefer the bottles."
"This was an awesome brew. Crisp, clean, refreshing, and delicious. I sure wish I had more than one bottle! I will drink this again, and hopefully soon"
"This was an awesome brew. Crisp, clean, refreshing, and delicious. I sure wish I had more than one bottle!"
"Bottle courtesy of Steph: Poured a deep copper color ale with a big foamy white head with some good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of floral and bitter hops is dominating. Taste is a mix between light caramel malt with some bitter hops at the end. Body is about average with some great carbonation. With the level of hops that can be found in this beer it is almost leaning toward an IPA. Very good session beer overall."
"It poured a pretty rich amber color with decent head formation. Aroma was light, citrus-y, hops. Flavor was definitely hoppy. I could find a bit of fault in the beer - it was just a touch stale and cardboard-y up front and just a touch sour at the finish, which might not have been the case if I'd had a bit fresher bottle (mine was dated 5/5/07, meaning it was just over 4 months old when I drank it). Still, there was a lot to like in this beer, including being very drinkable. Definitely recommended."
"Body is medium, creamy, and uber easy to drink. Great session beer that will certainly keep you interested."
"Hopback amber makes me think of what un-lagered Brooklyn lager might taste like. Complex but well balanced, flavorful but not so overpowering in any particular aspect. Hops and sweet roasted malts are all solid in this medium bodied brew. Makes me hope that I get my hands on some Nugget Nectar sometime soon."
"Drinkability- I wish I had more than one."
"Pours a ruby red, burnt orange color with a bubbly white foam almost tan head. Lingers around for a little while. Smell is of caramel malt and floral, earthy hop presence. Taste is sweet with caramel malt and bittering hops. Mouth feel is strong and heavy carbonated creating a really nice balance of all the flavors. A solid Amber Ale. One of my under rated favorite styles."
"Pours a reddish amber with a thin white lace head. Smells crisp with floral hops, a nice boquet indeed. Tastes of refeshing malt, fresh hops. This is verrry smooth and a delight. Has qualities from my favorite Troegs, Nugget Nectar. For an amber red this is a gem. Great drinkability."
"d: i immediately opened another one. nuff said."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a thick head. The aroma was immediately strong of hops and was persistent. The taste was strong initially of hops with some malt present and finishing bitter. The hops are noticeable and pleasant adding to the overall enjoyment. It has a very clean and balanced flavor. The mouthfeel is medium and crisp and suits the beer nicely. Overall, this is a delightful brew."
"Drinkability - No surprise that Troegs pounds out another winner, these guys are in the elite. This is definetly not in Nugget Nectar's class, but a nice easier drinking alternative when you want an IPA without all the gravity."
"Overall, an excellent and unique amber ale. Highly recommended."
"D- It's a good beer, and would be a good standby or introduction to craft beer with your bmc buddies."
"Big malty mouthfeel that has a oily residue. Overall this is a very nice beer."
"Overall, Hopback is a pretty solid beer and one that's quite drinkable, but it stumbles in the taste department. I want to try this beer again; perhaps the 12 hour car ride didn't help things..."
"This brew pours pretty much like many amber ales I have had in the past. Amber color, not too much heading, but still good looking. Smell had toasted grains and lots of hops. The taste of this beer is very similar to an IPA in the way that it has a big hop profile. Mouthfeel is medium. This is an easy to drink brew for sure. It is too bad that Troegs does not distribute to Ma. Oh well, I'll enjoy the six pack while it lasts. Cheers"
"the aroma is where the hops really shine. the flavor is a little more balanced: tea-like hops with a suggestion of mint. mild bitterness. i dig that it's not a glassfull of citrus hops; a little noble character"
"Pours a clean amber color with an off white head. Aromas of hops and a bit earthy. Tastes of hops, but a watery taste. A small dry, bitter end. A decent hop, a light body, but expecting a bit more in body, but it is still very nice. I do respect this because it is the Nugget Nectars daddy."
"D: I could see myself drinking this if only there wasn't much else to choose from. I have to give it credit, for some reason this beer seems like a good starter for someone trying to get into craft brew. It kind of covers that area between a simple macro and a more interesting microbrew..."
"Very nice orange color with a slight tan head on top. Good, mellow and hoppy aroma. Nice full hop flavor-slight citrusy taste and floral at the same time. Soft maltiness to it. Good body. Very full though not overly so. Very drinkable beer-would make a great session beer. I like to think of it as a Nugget Nectar Junior. Well balanced all around."
"I only got one bottle of this? What a tease!"
"Pours a very clear, shiny amber with bright edges and a molasses center. Little head. Beautiful hop aroma that displays a few hop varieties. Some 4C aromas and some spicy/earthy English-style ones. The aroma is evocative, powerful, and restrained enough not to overwhelm. It's the best aspect of this beer. The palate breaks down a bit, with a thin lemon grass tea note cropping up where the flavors should be more well rounded. But that's a quibble, really. There's sharp, substantially carbonated bitterness first off, then some sweeter, nutty malts and a tea-like finish. Overall, this is very good amber ale, and the best Troegs beer I've tried."
"Good medium+ body - absolutely stunning for a day like today (around 70, sunny, breezy)."
"Easily drinkable, but then so is Miller, for the same reasons. The absent finish, as you can tell, really bothered me, as I ws expecting much more out of this usually adventurous brewery."
"D- I'm not usually a big fan of amber ales. I had this one because it was in theTroegs multi-pack I bought. This is very drinkable and my favorite amber ale yet. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Another great brew by Troegs that I will have again."
"Proud to claim these brewers as Pennsylvanians... the smell of hops is thrust throughout the family room as the rich amber body settles into a shaker...a fruity, salty effervescence smooths out the mellow hop taste, although slight acidity is present at the tongue's back....a label that is backed by its substance, Hopback crafts a delicious non-complex ale that works as an all-season pint--not an easy accomplishment..."
"Troegs is justifiably proud in calling this their signature beer. Well-crafted, interesting, refreshing and tasty. Definitely recommended."
"Poured a cold 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Very dark amber or copper color. Pours with a fingernail's worth of frothy head. Smells outstanding -- very hoppy scent with citrus and maybe honey undertones. Tastes great. The beer is hoppy, but not bitter. Has some grapefruit flavor, and it is similar to the smell. The aftertaste stays for a while. However, you get a small alcohol aftertaste, but it is not bad. Medium carbonation, but not too much. I could see myself drinking a few of these. Troegs has a high quality line of brews, and this beer will not dissapoint."
"I think this is a great beer for malt heads and hop heads alike. The hops make their presence felt in the nose more than in the taste, and they are subdued enough on the palate that they shouldn't overly offend the malt heads. This is a quintessential session beer, in my opinion. I love this beer. I love Troegs."
"Has a nice clear amber hue with a two finger off-white head that dies down to a layer that stays throughout. Stickiness is all over the sides of the glass. Such a sugary hop odor pleases the nose that mixes well with a very mild pine scent. A touch of bready aroma is thrown in there as well. Taste is a spicy hop tingle up front that mixes well with a caramel malt and proceeds to end with a crisp citrus bite. Hopback has a medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation as well. Drinkability is scary good, I could easily have a few of these before I even realized it. Troegs is easily becoming one of my favorite breweries. Please begin to distribute in New York, is it really so much to ask for?"
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and medium in the carbonation. Solid and pleasant."
"Mouthfeel is good, but not great, almost leaves a little alcohol flavor at the end and a little carbonated. If it was a work night, I can see the whole sixer gone, the 6% is nicely hidden."
"D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not very filling, similar to Nugget Nectar the only thing keeping this beer from being an American IPA is the fact that Troegs doesnt call it an IPA. That being said, this is an excellent beer and I could see myself drinking a whole lot of it in an evening, if only Troegs were available this far in the Northeast. HINT-HINT!"
"Pours clear amber with 1/2"" head that quickly dissipates to almost nothing. Nice sweet hoppy smell which is slightly floral. Sweet malty initial flavor with medium hop bitterness and a nice balance. Clean dry finish with floral hop aftertaste. Medium bodied with a dry finish. This is a nice hoppy ale that I would definitely buy again. It is surprisingly hoppy, and I would probably guess IPA if I were blindfolded."
"With the low ABV and tame (not boring by any means) taste, it goes down quite well. Not quite their Nugget Nectar, but definitely a go-to year-round."
"Very good beer to savor and to session if so desired."
"Notes: A tasty amber with some bite. Too bad Troegs doesn't distribute in NY, I'd hit them up more often."
"The beer poured a rich amber with a thin head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was of some caramel malts and sweet citrus hops. The taste was of great citrus hops in the initial with a profound sweetness that completely overpowers the hops in the finish. This makes for a beer balanced in a truly unique way. The beer is very light, crisp and easy to drink. This would make a wonderful session beer."
"Medium bodied with little notable carbonation in the mouth. A nice beer if you're planning on having a few with the guys."
"Very nice sweet caramel malt backbone. Hefty malt notes that spar well with upstart hops though finish them off in the end. Balanced more towards the malty side if you missed it in the last sentence. Floral and slight fruit hop flavors give the brew a nice slickness to it. Medium to full bodied, especially for the style. Another great one from Troegs--haven't been disappointed yet by them."
"D: One of the tastier amber ales that I have tried. Very well balanced and extremely sessionable. I had the priviledge of trying this beer at the brewery and it is even better on tap. Recommend."
"Bottle into a mug. Pours an amber color, crystal clear, two-inch head, nice and billowy, and takes its time going away - nice looking. Aromas come out a couple feet away from the beer; mostly hoppy smell, spices, lots of grapefruit. Taste-wise, hops get you up front and then again even stronger in the long aftertaste. Lots of grapefruit again, malt a touch in the start but more so in the middle, although it's still fairly mild. Feel is thin to medium bodied, good carbonation. I really like this one. I'm not sure why, but I'd been hesitant to try Troegs - this one really surprised me, in a good way. A really nice American IPA."
"I had high hopes of this one, maybe I had a bad bottle or my mouth had a bad day."
"Drinkability: The aforementioned fade in the bitterness actually enhances the drinkability (and accessibility) of this amber. This would be a good one to have out on the deck during the early evening in the summertime."
"This beer is highly drinkable, I could see myself enjoying just one or two, or enjoying it all night."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice small tannish creamy head, some nice little islands and sticky lacing followed. The nose is sweet, hoppy, citrusy, and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is very nice, hoppy and citrusy. Nice chewy mouthfeel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brew from Troegs, highly recommended."
"The beer poured slightly cloudy, light amber in color, with a thin, cream colored head. It smell of hops. The hops are full throughout the taste and stronger in the aftertaste, but still balanced with the malt. The beer was not overly carbonated and lingered on the tongue. I could drink this beer anytime."
"Drinkability - What can I say, I love this beer. It's clean, crisp, methodically crafted, and has phenomenal drinkability potential. Excellent job Tröegs. Cheers!"
"TONS of floral hops in the sniff, really surprising for an amber ale. And the hops politely dominate the taste, I get it  this a amber / APA cross. Tasty lil brew that packs a hop kickin finish. Ill have another.wait, I only have onedammit."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. It had a very nice, dark amber color with a thick, off-white head with slow retention. It smelled quite hoppy which made me happy and looking forward to a nice, hoppy beer. I was not disappointed; hops were very prevalent in this brew and the aftertaste from the hops was not bad at all either; it was quite nice and smooth. I was not too impressed with the mouthfeel; it was a little on the thin side which was not too impressive. Overall drinka bility is pretty good, even though the mouthfeel is on the thin side. I Think it's pretty good overall. Thicker mouthfeel would have made a real solid beer."
"I've like the three previous Troeg's beers Ive had ( Rugged Trail, Nut Brown, and, of course, Troegenator) and this one fits nicely on that list."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable for a big ol' IPA. Nice level of alcohol, and has no abbrassive factors."
"I was expecting a little more hop from the hopback, but it was still a tastey brew. Fairly sweet, that must be where the amber comes in, the flavor reminded me of candied oranges and citrus. A hint of booze in the nose and mouthfeel but still pretty good overall. Give it a try."
"A very nice amber. Balanced, but certainly leans towards hop bitterness, but sweet, roasted malt keep things in line and in character for style. A nice interpretation of the style and an enjoyable brew."
"The label says Amber Ale, I always think i'm drinking an IPA , when i'm enjoying this beer."
"A well-rounded brew for hopheads."
"d-Its good stuff and it feels good to be drinking a part of Pa.I bought a variety case and there is a 6 pack of this stuff in it and im glad.very good Troegs."
"Pours a deep red to brown with a thick foamy head that retains well and leaves a generous amount of lacing. Smell is very hoppy and fruity. To me it smells a lot like an IPA. Taste is similar, very hoppy with a bready malt. It's a very light, smooth drink. Easy to drink a few. Definitely a good session beer."
"This ale poured a beautiful, clear, red/amber color with tall, fluffy, slightly off-white foam that persisted. The smell was a very hoppy aroma (reminiscent of Stone) with faint caramel coming through the hops. The taste was hoppy with strong bittering hops and floral hops. It was richly malty to balance the hops, with a light malt sweetness. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low carbonation. The hoppy flavors lingered nicely. This was a very nice ale, and was particularly good from cask!"
"D: Would have several of these. The composition of this beer makes it incredibly easy to drink, with the easygoing flavors keeping your interest and not destroying your palate."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, really and easy drinkin amber ale that disappears quickly. I like the fact that this is hoppier than most other ambers...overall it's just a solid brew. Nothing that's earth shattering..but I could see it making a good session."
"D: This is in my top 10 favorites (so far). A very good, highly recommended IPA. Troegs really hit the mark with this one."
"Very easy to drink, highly sessionable. Great flavor, solid beer. Nicely done."
"I have to give this brew all four ratings because its such a well rounded very nicely balanced and tasty beer. The appearance is a dark amber with a foamy head that leaves lots of lace. Smells of of malt and grassy hops give this beer a nice aroma. Taste of sweet malts and floral, citrus hops are in balance with a medium body mouth feel. A very good beer and a happy addition to my sampler case."
"Tried this brew on tap in York PA. What a surprise; it poured an extremely bright red amber with little head but good lacing. The aroma was sweet malts with a hint of hops, great earthy smell. The taste was even better with a perfect balance of citrusy sweetness and a great hop selection- so satisfyingly good and it could be even better bottled. Mouthfeel was smooth with moderate carbonation. I'm a big American IPA fan and this brew can stand up to the best of them- good choice."
"This beer has a nice lingering mouthfeel, even with the more muted flavors. Definitely would be a good session brew, quite drinkable."
"D: After the initial hop-shock, this beer quickly becomes very easy to drink. The more I drink, the more crave it. Unfortunately, the ABV is slightly high to session well."
"Like the famous Nugget Nectar, this is a good, good beer. Troegs does american ambers up right, and this one will keep NN fans somewhat sated while we wait until next year's batch. Go Troegs!"
"A light pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a very slight head that rapidly recedes to a thin, light tan glass ring. The beer's color is a deep copper. The nose is full of herbal and lightly grassy hops, balanced by a nice caramel scent. Not very strong, though. The taste is grassy, a bit nutty, bread-like, and perhaps just a bit toasted. This beer is an easy drinker, to be sure. The mouth is medium, with low carbonation. A good sessioner, if perhaps a little too strong."
"It's nice to see a craft brewer making an amber ale. It's not something that you usually see. This is a great one, and I love Troegs for it. For those of you that are looking for another good beer to show to non-BA's, as I always am, this is a good one. I'd think this would be a great ""transitional"" beer from the macro world into the quality craft beer world, just like Prima Pils, All Malt Lager, Brooklyn Pennant, and a few others."
"I'd drink this again. You better believe it!"
"D - This beer won Best Local Beer by a Philly magazine, and I'm quickly identifying it as one of my top everyday beers. It finishes so smoothly and pairs well with many food selections...the more I drink, the more I enjoy it. Definitely suggest picking some up if you have the opportunity."
"Highly drinkable, I will add this to my ""buy again"" list especially when entertaining folks that need to ease into hop-appreciation. This is my first sampling of Troegs, and now I am very anxious to try their IPA/APA/PA offerings, especially ON-TAP. Recommended!"
"a pretty good mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation in it, and ill probably follow this one up with an other."
"Thanks Muenchenerkindl! This was a real gem!"
"A very drinkable ale, sure to satify all but the most diehard hophead. I like it, and will again."
"D-Excellent, I could make this may regular fall back."
"Overall a very unique American Amber. Very quaffable amber ale that would appeal to my fellow hop heads."
"Drinkability: Superb. Not particularly complex or mindblowing, just exceptionally balanced. Probably would be my session beer of choice if I were living in Pennsylvania."
"Clear amber with nice offwhite head. Nose is hugely hoppy, fresh, grassy, floral, mildly citrus hops. Faint caramel malt backing. Taste is initially hoppy. Huge hop flavor, the nose echoed almost perfectly except the malts are quite substantial, and balance wonderfully. Plenty of caramel, oily hops, turning a spicy green through the finish. Mouthfeel is spot on, moderate carbonation with medium body and drinkability fantastic. Very nice beer, though on days when i want something drier, i wouldn't choose this."
"drinkability: good"
"12oz. bottle. Poured a dark gold/amber color. Very clear. Developed a large off white head. Aroma was earthy, with the hops coming through as a pine/grass scent. Flavor was much more malty than aroma suggested, with a nice balance of the hops throughout. Finish is ""piney"". Beer was medium in body, with fairly high carbonation and slightly drying. Overall, a pretty good beer, kinda a light version of Nugget Nectar (much better, unfortunately not available year round)."
"tasty, quite drinkable, and hybrid-like brew."
"Drinkability/Overall: Highly drinkable amber ale, impeccably balanced with plenty of hop, malt, and fruit flavors going on. A quality beer from an often-boring style."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl! MK"
"Clear light auburn with a thick, creamy, beige head. Steady small carbonation. Bristlecone pine and caramel dominate the spicy and leafy aroma. Very hoppy. Front is hoppy as can be but this mellows away to reveal a nice, moderately hopped middle and finish with wonderful caramel flavors. Still, hops dominate and offer a multitude of hop flavors including luscious juicy fruits, spicy mountain brush, pine, bright floral and grass notes. Body is light to medium. Drinkability is very high."
"Nice sweet malt backbone cut through by a pleasantly mild citrus/pine hop presence that carries through to a dry bitter finish. Another excellent offering from Troegs. Highly drinkable and affordable."
"Poured a medium dark amber with very little head. Some lacing as the beer was consumed. Fairly faint smell but traces of malt rather than hops. The taste is quite good- maybe a little too much carbonation at the front of the palate, but quickly some pleasant not too sharp bitterness from the hops and immediately a transition into a sweet malt flavor followed by a some lingering hop taste. The mouthfeel starts a little slick, but quickly drys out and ends up quite refreshing. Hoppier and maltier than many ambers, but eminently drinkable."
"My first Troegs was a good one."
"Here's another incredible brew by Troegs. This is an odd beer to categorize, as it tastes like a red amber, but is extremely hoppy. I'd just call it a Red APA. Quite similar to their Pale Ale, a little bolder and aggressively hoppy. Malts and hops are the dominance, and again, in true Troeg's fashion, an incredibly dry, smooth drinkability, with no after taste whatsoever. It is a very interesting beer and highly recommended."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. Pleasingly complete; sensually enlivening, thirst quenching, and satisfying. A fine beer."
"D: Wow, I'm in love with another Troegs brewery. They are certainly one of the most underated breweries in the country. Definitely pick up a 6er of this if you haven't had it."
"Taste is very similar to the Nugget Nectar, but not quite the same quality. Very balanced beer with a smooth maltiness and not overbearing yet tasty hop flavor. Excellent balance between these 2 with a nice smooth but-hop finish. Clean beer overall. Could be considered in the IPA category.I enjoy it - was very glad to find it in the local liquor store."
"Overall, a good beer and recommended."
"-this beer paired well with internet porn..."
"Pours a dark amber (red when held to the light) and with a dense long lasting head and plenty of aroma. Cascade-like hops in the scent and flavor, with others blended in for the bittering. Exeptionally clean mouthfeel with subsequent splendid drinkability. Tastes like pine resin and citrus with a sweet malty undertone. Not super hoppy or bitter as the name would imply but the hops taste very fresh and green. I think the brewer must have used whole flower hops to achieve this or something because these hops taste fresh picked. My first troegs beer (that umlaut is redundant and diminutive) and it's a winner. Ok the are ""Bros"" advocates of the ganja as well? None of the troegs beers are listed with with accurate ABV."
"I found that this works quite nicely as a beer to use in beer batter for fish n' chips. Add a dash of this to a creole mayo to accompany your fish n' chips. Of course, you might as well drink one of these while frying your fish. And what better to pair with said fish!"
"Overall a great tasting beer! This style has a whole lot of varience, but this one really seems to stand above most others. But between the balance and hops used, this really reminds me of an esb as well."
"Great amber ale! I wish they all had the kind of ""Umph!"" that this one does."
"This beer tastes more like an IPA than a red beer. The color is lighter than you would expect from a red beer. There was a decent head. The smell is very hoppy. As I said before, the taste is like an IPA. I guess it's more of an IPA / Amber Ale blend. The mouthfeel is smooth and there is a lingering bitterness. I could drink these over and over. A good beer!!"
"yeah."
"The beer is sweet up front, which accents the citrusy hop character. The hops have a tight grip on the palate; sharp and herbal with a solid bitterness that lingers on through to a long finish. This is nicely hoppy, just what I needed this afternoon. Fairly malty as well, with a solid backdrop, which helps to accentuate and balance out the hops. Both a malt sweetness and a toasted almost baked malt character. Quite a tasty beer, and as is the sign of any good beer it seems to disappear from my glass long before I want it to."
"This is an easy drinking beer. It pushes the limits of an amber, and could easily be mistaken for an APA. Either way, it's damn good."
"My wife brought this back for me from PA. Has a good light-brown head and true amber color. As expected, aroma has a good bit of malt and hops. Some typical hops aromas: resin, pine, citrus, but not overpowering. (Leave that to the Nugget Nectart). Overal, a pretty good beer. I'm not a huge fan of amber ales, but this is pretty good."
"This is one of the most balanced beers I've had. Wish I had more!"
"Good solid drinking beer here but it is a little too malty and dry in the end to get a really great drinkability rating. This is a rather full flavored and bodied beer that just isn't all that after the first hop burp you realize just how rich this really is. Nice beer though, would go great with sausage and dumplings."
"Pours a bourbon-like brown color with a frothy off-white head that settles quickly to thin cap. Hops dominate the nose, maybe a hint of caramel as well. Taste starts off slighly sweet with malts, then the hops come out, but not overpowering at all....great balance here. Medium bodied brew that doesn't coat the mouth as one might guess by the color, and very easy to drink. Great brew!"
"All in all a good offering, not sure I'd move it into heavy rotation, but I certainly could throw a few back in short order"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a medium bodied beer. The beer is well balanced. The mouthfeel has a very clean and refreshing feeling. A very drinkable beer treat overall. I will be sad to see the last of my case drank up."
"I got this beer a couple months ago for the first time actually completely by accident. It turned out in my favor this beer has a great color and an even better taste. It has a strong hop taste. The thing I wasn't a fan of was how my mouth felt afterwards. However, great accident, great beer, and I've had it a few times since."
"D - Has a nice flavor with the fruity sweetness and hops striking a nice balance. One could take a couple of these at 6% as well."
"Overall quite good -- hoppy, but not enough to be overwhelming or keep you from wanting another one (or two or three...)."
"Nice beer. Usually when I see Amber I expect a maltier beer. Although malt was present in the taste, it was countered nicely by the hops. Similar hop taste and smell as their Nugget Nectar...very earthy and spicy. Really good beer. Nice medium Amber color with a dense head of foam but that died fairly quickly. Easy drinking brew."
"Drinkability: Easily quaffable. Slightly higher alcohol content but not noticable at all. Very tasty and not too heavy. I'm already looking for a secod."
"12 ounce bottle. Troeg's Hopback Amber pours out a slightly cloudy amber color with a medium sized head. Toasted malt and sweet caramel, with fresh hops in the background. Flavor is bready malt with caramel and a surpisingly large dose of hops. Slightly fruity with some raisin notes. Just a hint of smoke. Fresh citrus hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, but the beer is still quite drinkable. Terrific balance. Even an older bottle loses little of the fresh hop flavor. A fine example of the style."
"Pours a nice looking light amber, very clear. Good size head that don't last too long. Ladder-like lacing down the glass. Good aroma of hops, not that strong but definitely worth savoring. Taste was very good. Definite hops but overall smooth,balanced taste so that the hops are not overpowering. Also detected some hint of spices. The mouthfeel was rich, carbonation about right. I was surprised at the 6.0 ABF when I logged on (didn't see it on the bottle). I would consider the drinkability of this beer very high. If this beer was generally available on tap in Tidewater VA, I would rate it above Yeungling but still below SNPA (my staple beers to ask for). This would also be a good beer to help de-program a BMC drinker."
"Served on tap last night at Tyson's in Baltimore. Pours a yellowish amber with a finger of head. Nice retention and lacing. Citrus aroma. Very hoppy, with a grapefruit/citrus lean, but with a caramel backbone to boot. The nonbeer geeks refered to it as ""refreshing."" Well worth several."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a finger of creamy off-white head, reduces quickly to a lingering cap that leaves behind some nice big curtains of lace. Smell is a nice and fairly strong bouquet of flowery hops with a slight citric twang and a slight caramel malt. Taste is a moderate caramel malt balanced very nicely by the hops, more floral in the middle and with the fruity citrus coming throuh on the finish. Body is on the thin side of medium and the carbonation could be crisper; the mouthfeel's the only thing that really detracts from this beer. This is a nice offering, hoppier and tastier than most ambers I've had, very easy drinking."
"Cheers!"
"-UF"
"All in all a very nice sessionable offering that I have to thank froggyfrog for!"
"Easy to drink but too light for me, both in hoppiness and in body. Probably an ok session, and probably much better on tap."
"The citric and floral hops are quite complex and noticeable for the style, but in no way over the top. In fact, I find the level of maltiness to be up to the task of balancing the hops, making for a well-balanced and enjoyable brew. This beer allows you to enjoy the hops without singing off your taste buds IPA-style. The body was a bit on the lean side, but not to the point of detracting from the brew, and probably only increases its prowess as a fine session ale."
"No complaints. This one is a good IPA, that will match up to most other domestic micro IPAs."
"Pours a light copper with a dense foam head that falls to a table and leave some bubbly lacing, gorgeous in the glass. Smells like a hoppy brew with a light malt background, but the taste reverses that with a bready malt beginning and a light balance of hops. Tasty and sessionable. Mouthfeel is medium, drinkability is high. Worthy of a regular purchase. Have it on hand for your beer related needs."
"Final Thought: Wow, this is in the top tier of Ales in my book, earns its place on my beer mantle!"
"This beer pours a bright copper orange with a very uniform head that left some nice lacing. Smells of earth, sour hops, limes and grassy grains with a little bit of smoke. The flavor is very dynamic, with a pasty and smooth, honey and molasses malt coupled with a separate green grape skin dryness. Nice transition of flavors here. The finish is sweet, smoky and eartyh. Mouth feel is simple, with a medium body and slight carbonation."
"This beer goes down easy, much like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, just without that special extra ""something."" You could have many of these in a row. Definitely worth picking up a six-pack."
"Drinkability: Overall, a fine effort that shows that an amber ale doesn't have to be boring"
"A copper colored beer with a red-hue head that has good retention but leaves behind little lacing. I can smell sugar, hops, and honey. Sweet scents seem to dominate this beer's aroma profile. The taste is a welcome blend of hop bitterness and malt sweetness as is typical for this style. The alcohol is not apparent in the taste or the aftertaste. In addition, the finish is a bit sour with a lingering sweetness that sits in the back of my throat. A well-balanced beer with excellent drinkability and taste."
"Troegs' brews impress once again. Really, really nice stuff. If I were to choose a favorite beer that I drank exclusively, this would be a top contender. I'd definitely want it to come with me in the ""shipwrecked on a deserted island"" scenario. I'd love to try it cask conditioned, and I'll be sure to grab a case of bottles next time I'm in PA or NJ. I'm a sucker for great session beers, I've had hundreds, and this is a stand out."
"This was on cask at Andys Corner bar on a recent NJ business trip. It poured into the shaker pint a medium copper color with a fluffy white head. Great retention. The nose had nice citrus hop, grapefruit with a little grass and hay. The flavor has grapefruit rind, hay and a little hop flower. Extremely light and slick mouth feel. Very drinkable. This would be a nice summer beer."
"Pint at Phyrst. This beer is a very nice copper color with a medium sized white head that dissipates rather quickly. Nose is dominated by spicy hops. Taste is very hoppy as well. There is a nice malt backbone but the hops hit almost immediately and persist through to the finish. Very nice medium to thick mouthful and quite drinkable as well."
"[yet another Eastern treasure sent Westward by mntlover]"
"D - This beer is very good all around. Smell could be better, but as far as drinkability goes, it's top notch. Would go well with almost any meal or as a session beer. Definitely a must try. Another great Troegs beer!"
"I finally got back to my beer after a few days of gastritis (caused, no doubt, by the pitcher of swill from my previous rating). And found this beer to be a nice mellow transition back to real beers. Pours a big country cream head over a pretty amber body; the head turns rocky as it starts to fade. The hops are clearly of an American IPA mode, piney more than citrusey. The bitterness is pleasing more than bitter for its own sake, and matches up well with a smooth caramel malt. Kudos."
"Thanks to this site and your reviews! Like I said, I'm new at this, but I think I've already taken a big step up. Cheers!"
"Had this out of a 1/6 at home, it poured a nice clear deep amber with a big off white head that was present for the whole glass. It has a sweet smell, like caramel, with some piney hops. Starts sweet, big caramel flavor, then the hops give some bitter bite, but not over the top. The after taste is all sweet malts. Medium body with moderate carbonation, really easy going down. Nice drinkable beer. I usually don't like amber ales because they are too sweet but this one was just right."
"This is really smooth, drinkable session beer. Hops are mentioned in the beer's name, but it's not a super-hoppy beer at all. Actually, the hops character is nicely balanced by some sweetness (fruits and malt). Worth trying when you want to kick back and enjoy beer after beer."
"For one this beer is the perfect color amber, if it crystalized I could sell it as jewlery. It has a nice lasting white chunky head that laces the glass. The smell is of lots o'hops, full fragerant floral, a touch citrus, a touch piney, with some sweet malt sneaking though and a little yeast too. The taste was a little confused though, nice malt base bold and assertive with a little alcohol, but the hops seem to go in different directions and the bitterness was grassy. It had a good body but overall the beer was decent in the bottle probably much better on tap."
"thanks to weeare138 from the bottle . poured a nice amber with a off white head. aroma hops, and a small amout of malts, a touch of citrus like lemon, floral. flavor gotta like the hops nice and mild and the malts blend in there nicely.satisfied the hop craving."
"I'd like to finish by saying I'm proud that I live 4 miles away from this awesome brewery. Always look forward to drinking Troegs. Great local Beer."
"The pleasure of this brew starts with the pour and goes all the way to staring at the lace on the side of the empty glass. The color is a classic amber with an ample off-white head. The nose powers through with sweet malt and piney hops. the front end reminds of an American IPA, but continues with a more moderate bitterness and a pleasant mild spicy aftertaste. The malt was buttery caramel and it bit nutty as well. The mouthfeel was a bit prickly, though that may have due to drinking it at about 40 degrees. My first thought was ""I need to have another"". Highly recommended."
"overall: i really wanted to like this amber, as it gets very good reviews on here, but i was a little disappointed. taste reminds me of a lager/ale/ipa instead of an amber. a decent beer, but falls even outside a ""catch all"" style like this."
"A lovely amber amber, with golden highlights.Didn't get much head out of my pour(s). Very nice clean piney hops scent, with a pleasant hop bite taste, with a perfect malt balance. Slighty candy undertone sweetens. Clean, smooth, a little chewy, but not overly puckering. The combination adds up to an all day drinker."
"This is one goddam good beer. A slammer. One of my favorite APA's in the whole country."
"Again, another easy-to-drink Troeg. Mellow, if not on the hoppy side, and may very well be a top American amber. Very well crafted. Try some."
"A rough pour produced a moderately thick, dense, dirty cream colored that faded slowly to a film leaving a sheet of lace behind. Aroma of candied grapefruit and spring flowers ( I almost sneezed!). Transparent, dark copper colored beer with a few streams of tiny bubbles rising from around the bottom. Solid malt backbone tastes like caramel and toasted malt. It's joined by doses of sweat tea and grapefruit. The finish is mildly sweet, not bitter as I had expected. The body is nice and light making for a refreshing beer. A full flavored beer with a nice mix of hops and malt. It's sweet, but more of a candied/sugary sweet then the thick gooey cloying sweetness."
"A perfect session beer - mouthfeel is awesome, goes down smooth, easy and agreeable. I have brought down from PA three cases of this over time. Still hadn't reviewed it. Sad, I know. Anyway, I just got a sixer sent from a friend in PA. I also had a bottle here from the last time I purchased a case, likely 9 months ago. The major difference was in the aroma - and the body. The aroma was not as strong, and the mouthfeel/body lent more texture to the beer, but wasn't bad in any way. Just an interesting note."
"Drinkability - Not too bad, I won't be going out of my way to get it. I've been told by others that this beer was pretty good so maybe a fresher representation would warrant an edit."
"very clear - crystal clear - but little head after a vigourous pouring. The aroma is nice, seems heavier on malty notes than hops with a little licorice and candy note there as well. Flavor follows through too, not overwhelming but a nicely balanced blend of spicey hops (with some cinnamon aspect noticed, wonder what hop that is?) and a slight bitterness, complimented with maltiness and some caramel notes. A good drinking beer, would make a good session beer except the ABV may shorten your session somewhat prematurely."
"A very nice mouthfeel to this. It seems to be very sticky initially but washes down well leaving only a hint of what was just tasted. Drinkability would be excellent and the beer almost demands it with its dry taste. I think that if this was more available that I would have a new session beer."
"Nice reddish amber ale with great flavor. Decent size head which stays around for a long time, just like the flavor. Not a very hoppy ale, but a great mix of malt and hops. Has a slightly sweet taste. The smell of the malt and citrus fruits is quite strong and quite appealing."
"I bought a six-pack of this after a friend recommended Troegs to me. Looks like I'll have to go back to him for some more recommendatons. This beer pours a reddish -copper color. The head was small but had good retention and a some slight lacing going down the glass. Sweet, caramel malt aroma. The taste really brings out some spicyness from the hops. Fairly easy on the palate with a slight dry finish. Medium to full bodied, but very drinkable. A fine brew and I will definitely be purchasing some other kinds of their beer in the future."
"Great example of the style. Pours a reddish clay in color. Nice thick foamy head with lots of lace. Nose is all grass. Taste is wonderfully balanced. Sweet malts combined with nice hop additions that bring out some grapefruit. With the aftertaste is a reminder of the grain that went into the beer. Slightly more than medium body. Very pleasant drinking."
"A very nice looking beer. Amber with a touch of red and a thin white head. Has a strong aroma of citiusy hops. It smells like they did use a hop back on this brew. A good balance between malt and hops, leaning toward the hop side. Being a hop head, the hop presence could be stonger. A good drinking beer for the summer, which is why I went for the half keg. Living 60 miles from Troegs I well aware of their beers and they are all pretty good."
"Drinkability - solid session amber, thanks to merlin48 for a fine bottle o' brew."
"Definitely recommended."
"pours a crystal clear amber with barely any head, but a very active life of carbonation. color glows beautifully in my glass. scent is explosively floral.. honey soaked hops. fruitier than it is buttery, aroma is light and inviting. flavor is very fresh and botanical in nature. a rye-ish maltish smoothness invades half of the flavor here. fruity sweet meets hop bitter in the finish with a rounded smoothness. light and bubbly. drinkably refreshing. a good example of a flavorful session beer, if not a little maniacal in its execution."
"A real solid everyday drinkable beer."
"Highly drinkable, ultra-tasty stuff. I'm glad Tröegs is somewhat local."
"Very refreshing an exceedingly drinkable. I love this stuff."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. The body is an orangey/amber with a 1 finger head that is off-white and leaves decent lacing. Very fruity in the nose - pineapple, grapefruit, and mangoes, along with some pine needles. The beer is fairly sweet on the palate, and the pine, grapefruit, and pineapple dominate, but there are traces of more fruits (mangoes, cherries?). The malts eventually contribute notes of biscuits and the bitterness from the hops gets more pronounced as it warms, as does the alcohol flavor. Very smooth with significant carbonation and a medium body that thickens as you near the end of the glass. Very tasty and not too bad on the wallet."
"The aroma is a hoppy grapefruit flavor with a hint of grassiness. The taste is very smooth and not overly bitter, but has a nice hoppy taste with hints of citrus flavor. There is a very pleasant aftertaste. This is not one of the strong hopped up ales I have had, but a mild version of an IPA."
"Note - was able to retry this one freshly tapped (within 7 days) and it was noticably better, which is saying something for a beer this good. Don't be afraid to ask how long the barrel has been tapped, it made a noticable difference in the fruit undercurrants of this."
"This is exactly what I expect from an amber ale. A very good example."
"Thanks to merlin48 for this beer. Pours an amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of hops - lots of different types, but they aren't too much, as they would be in a double IPA. The flavor has a lot of hop flavor in it, mostly covering up the malts. But again, the hops aren't too strong, just well proportioned. Moderate in body and the drinkability is pretty good."
"Thanks to merlin48 for this beer. This one pours a nice deep amber color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is caramel, slightly buttery and citrusy hops. I think it smells really nice. The flavor is right there with the nose. The hop is a little more floral and spicey on the taste and the caramel is more strong on the finish. I like it. The feel is thick, with a moderate carb. Overall, I think this is a well built beer. I like the flavor a lot. The hops are really nice with the sweet and slightly butteryness underneath."
"Thanks to francis and ericaweizen for the sample."
"There isnt anything all that special about this beer, but its just a well-balanced tasty beverage that I would recommend trying."
"A real stand out beer in a style with 95% boring beers."
"Pouring into my pint glass, it pours an amber color with reddish highlights; minimal head w/ slight edge lacing and very clean. However, nothing exciting really. Aroma is mainly of HOPS HOPS HOPS!!! Some vanilla malts come through a bit as well, and maybe some type of citrus fruit (lemons maybe?). However, the hops takes over for the most part. Bitter hops and a slight grape sweetness is the highlight of the sip. Grapefruits or lemons also come through; overall, very citrussy and piney. Feel is nice. Very carbonated throughout, but due to its light-to-medium body, i found it a slight bit creamy and smooth. Little alcohol burn and a slight pine aftertaste finish this one up. Overall, not the most complex of Troegs brews, but very fun, easy, and pleasant to drink!"
"Thanks to fellow BA JayT for bringing me some brews. This one was a true clear light amber, but even when I poured it myself, the small 1/2 inch head left quickly. Aroma is interesting...very strong, more grapefruit than grassy hops. Tastewise, I am picking up on strong grapefruit smelling hops, that have an interesting hay-like quality as well. Mouhhfeel is medium, carbonation is low. Alcohol would like to hide, but I can tell this one isn't a session beer."
"An excellent by itself or with food."
"Overall-Spectacular, the first beer I've ever given a flawless rating to. I'm absolutely floored, great work."
"Pours a light copper color with a foamy, 2-finger beige head that drops to a light collar, but stays until the glass is done. Very nice lacing as well. Smells very fresh and clean, very hoppy. Has hints grass, floral, and spicy hops. They all combine very well for a great smell. Honestly I wish I could have this smell in a Glade ""plug-it-in"". Tastes wonderful. Absolutly superb. A nice caramel hops flavor up front with light hops in the back. So, obviously, the name HopBack makes sense. Finishes with a nice malt flavor, caramel and hops abound. The malts and hops blean beautifully to create a complex and fabulously drinkable beer. Well done. This is the third of my Troeg's sample pack, and so far, the best. Try this and you will not be dissapointed."
"Troegs doesn't brew bad beer. Hopback Amber is a wonderful ale that keeps these guys solidly in my top dozen American breweries. The first of many from blitheringidiot. Thanks man."
"Pours ambery reddish color with a light beige head. Subtle, piney floral hop aroma and some malt sweetness present, too. Botanical and malty sweet up front, then dryness from the hops, and finishing with a faint, lingering sweetness, rather like sweetened tea. Slightly astringent, and a mild metallic oxidized flavor in the background, but easy to drink. I must admit that I was a little disappointed when Troegs decided to part ways with their ESB in order to make this beer, but it's a worthy substitute. I didn't really like the cask-conditioned version of this beer, but the bottle is enjoyable."
"My first Troeg's offering...thanks to Ted for bringing it back from his recent trip to PA. Appearance is excellent...a medium amber, chunky head and great lacing. Smell is a pleasant blend of malts and fruity hops. Taste is a palate's delight...starts lightly sweet on the front...lessens on the mid palate and finishes with just the right amount of hop finish. Moouthfeel is moist and smooth throughout and not overly oily or dry on the finish. Very easy on the drinkability scale, defintely could have another. I have three others from Troeg's to try and if they are anything like this offering, I may take a trip to PA myself. Highly recommended."
"purchased a 1/4 keg for my home tap system based on my fondness for other Troegs brews and was not disappointed by this tasty amber ale. Pours a clear amber with good carbonation - firm, creamy head starts off 1/2"" thick but settles to a lacey film for the duration. Initial aroma is sweet and mildly herbal. Drinkability is great for a 6.0 abv - a sweet beginning becomes a slightly bitter, hoppy full flavor with a long lasting hop aftertaste. I highly recommend this to anyone who fancies amber or pale ales."
"On tap and cask-conditioned. Dark-amber color that is clear with good effervescence. Large, creamy, off-white head that is fully lasting. Excellent lacing. Aroma is hoppy with a medium to strong herbal and evergreen scent and slight caramel notes as well. Excellent mix of sweetness and bitterness. Long finish that is evenly bitter and sweet. Excellent carbonation, body, and finish."
"12 ounce bottle, with no freshness dating. Pours a rich almond amber, clear, tan head, fair retention and leaving a tiny bubble, broken up film and classy lacing. Nice resiny hop nose. Medium bodied. Malty base. Almost creamy mouthfeel. What hits you with this one is the well developed and complex hop notes, flavors and smells. Nicely rounded brew all together. Well done and worth seeking out."
"saw this an cask at the sharp edge emporium in pittsburgh and told the bar-keep to pull me pint. little did i know, this would take some time. about ten minutes to be exact. i waited patiently as he readied the pint. he told me that it had not been pouring well but, the taste was fine. i said ok. the appearence was a creamy amber with a mountainous head that you could cut with a knife. the smell was much more raw than that of the bottle or an tap samples. a very hoppy nose with a sweet malty, earthy back. taste was creamy, hoppy floral but, more subdued than i had expected. the malts in this ale seemed to come through more on cask. mothfeel was almost free of carbonation and heavier than other serving types i've tried. the lack of carbonation kind of threw me at first. it seemed to take away the bite from the hops but, delicicous nonetheless. i don't know if i would have more than one or two on cask at any given time (price-$6 a draft) and the lack of carbonation lowered my drinkability slightly. very much enjoyed."
"I needs to gets me some more Troeg's beers!"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep amber color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of hops, but has a rich caramel background to it. Balanced just slightly on the hoppy side. The taste starts out a bit malty with some sweetness. Hops are really king here, and there's lots of em! Many layers of fresh hops leave a little room for a slightly malty finish. The mouthfeel is heavy, yet very smooth. Much more full of a body as compared to any other amber ale. The drinkability is also very good as well. The 6% is masked nicely. A great amber brew!"
"This beer is a winner, and will stay stocked in my fridge from here on out!"
"Taste: Slightly more carbonated than I prefer, lending a slightly spritzy mouth that leans toward thin. Initially slightly sweet. Toasty, husky, and slightly grainy in the middle. Finishes dry and with a nice hop bitterness, attacking the back of the tongue. Hops coat the inside of your mouth and don't let go. Very nice."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking session brew."
"Comments  Thanks to ericaweizen for sending this one my way. Darn her  now Im addicted!!"
"Drinkability: This is a very nice session beer. I can imagine this being wonderful on-tap. It doesn't assault the tongue like somesuper strong IPAs, but this will definitely give hopheads a nice little fix. Very good and easy drinking"
"Well-hopped, aggressive attack of malts and carbonation on palate. Fine cooper amber colour. Light, good as IPA! Some pine aroma. Mid-sip sour grapefruit citrus, spices and nuttyness. Refreshing on hot day. Unique and very drinkable. Recommend you try and can convert beer drinkers to the craft world."
"Pours a good amber color, with a decent head that had some retention. Decent lacing was seen when drinking this brew. The aroma is dominated almost exclusively by hops, mainly citrus with other smells present. The malt smell rounds out the aroma for an overall great smell. The taste stays true to the name as the citrus hops are taking over with the malts still making themselves known. Clean aftertaste with a slight bitterness and a good mouthfeel. Very easy drinking as I am on schedule to finish this 6 pack tonight. Another great beer by Tröegs."
"D&N: Beer Nirvana. One of the finest brews I've had the pleasure of tasting. Rich and full of character, this beer in a cask conditioned incarnation is one I'll look forward to having again. If you ever see this in a cask, try it."
"Cask version at Fat Heads in Pittsburgh. Pours a dark amber color with a thin off-white head. Thin and foamy lacing. The aroma is outstanding: Citrus hops, malt, caramel and fruit. Very smooth body, with a strong floral hops flavor, followed by malt and spice. The finish is slick and earthy hops and malt. This beer is definitely enjoyable on the cask, Id like to try the bottled version too."
"Nice deep malty taste/mouth feel that is backed up by, and washes down with a nice, lucid (neither overpowering or clean) and strong citrus flavor, and a solidly crisp finish. Nothing is overpowering taste-wise, and everything complements each other nicely. And makes for perfect drinkablility when looking for it!"
"ng"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a thick 1/2""of light beige head, which laced ok. Aroma is mainly of hops, but the malt is also evident, just in the minority. Taste is a bit of a surprise, as the nose did not lead me to think this would be as well-balanced as it is. Hops is up-front, but the flavor profile is quickly rounded out by an appropriate amount of malt. Mouthfeel is good, and that little aftertaste of hops is great, just like you want. Drinkability is excellent, plenty going on this brew so as not to bore the taste buds."
"Very nice find this weekend in State College at the Phyrst. This beer must have been mighty fresh. Had a nice hop nose, but the juicy, round, phat, fruity hop flavors in this beer make it really very nice. Very fresh fruity, juicy hop flavor. Very drinkable as well."
"The Hopback poured a clear copper color, with a fluffy white head that receded significantly. Still, the surface of the beer remained a thin, yet frothy consistency throughout. Some nice lacing along the glass. Heavy floral and fruity smell, with a deeper aroma than expected...very appealing. Just the right amount of caramel peeks out through the strong hops/malt competition to add a nice touch. Fairly malty, but bitter enough to satisfy. Nice aftertaste, too. The full, sticky mouthfeel almost reminds me of what an amber ale lollipop might taste like. Quite some time after finishing this glass, a quick lick of the lips reminds me of this fine beer. Very drinkable, especially for this style, the Hopback has become a staple for me. Very well done."
"Pours a medium amber color with a nice white, semi-persistent head. The head leaves a bit of sticky decoration on the glass. A hoppy aroma--primarily citrus and floral notes, comes nicely from the glass. A bit of sweet malt also is present in the aroma. The taste is quite good--the hops make themselves known and are balanced by some equally tastey caramelly, malty flavors. Finishes with some very nice bitterness. A very easy drinking beer, with a smooth medium body. Overall this is a pretty good beer and definitely one worth having again in the future."
"Tröegs Hopback Amber Ale: Not fully sure what this is supposed to be. It says it an amber ale, but the name and aroma indicate that it was much more than a typical amber ale. The aroma is fairly hoppy, with very little in the way of malts. This is a good looking beer, however, nice copper color, decent off white head, with a little bit of stickiness. The taste is nice, fairly floral/citrus hops, with a bready base of malts. Clean aftertaste with mild hop tastes. Nice and easy to drink."
"Taste: The flavor begins with a malt push, biscuit, caramel, and butterscotch are noticed. The floral hops peak through in the middle and finishes with a citrus hop bitterness. At first I thought the flavors were too distinct, big malt and then big hops. Either go one way or the other but after having this beer a few more times over a span of a couple of months I think it is a great blending of flavors. Extremely well balanced. Very smooth and hugely drinkable. A heavier session beer if you will. A must have in anyone's beer fridge."
"This is the only selection I have given a perfect five. This is justified. Hopback is my favorite selection from Troegs. I had the opportunity to have the beer served on-cask. It blew me away. The nose was amazing, in that the hops were present and similar to the bottle or draught version, but they were subdued. The head was light and fluffy and lasted the entire duration of the pint. As this was a cask-conditioned ale, the carbonation was very low, allowing for all the flavor to present itself to the drinker. All the flavors of the Hopback were present but just more balanced. The beer was very smooth in my mouth and actually made me understand the purpose of cask ale. Props to Market Cross Pub in Carlisle, PA for taking care of this cask and serving it properly in an Imperial Pint."
"Beer is good. Happy local beering."
"Beautiful clear, reddish amber color, with a very thin head. This bier has a slight caramel flavor that complements the hoppinesss of it very well. Has a very pleasing grassy and piney aromas to it, especially as the bier warms a little. This beer has overall a good hop flavor is very enjoyable. Also the bier finishes very creamy. The solid malt core helps balance the flavor."
"Good beer."
"Thanks to blitheringidiot for the trade."
"Beautful clear, reddish brown color, but disappointingly sparse head. Light floral aroma, nice, not overpowering. There is a strange aftertaste that is like hardboiled eggs which I cannot understand and may just be this batch? Slight caramel flavor. Light hoppiness, not too strong as you would expect from the name. Thick and creamy mouthfeel, makes me think of when your milkshake has melted.... Clean and dry finish, decent drinkability but maybe not as a session beer."
"The beer pours a reddish amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is great! It has a nice light crystal malt scent, but the main feature here is the awesome floral hop aroma that is very pleasant. The taste is great as well. This beer has got some good hop flavor that goes down easy and finishes creamy. It also has a solid malt core which helps balance the flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect. This is a med/full bodied amber ale with adequate carbonation. This is the best damn amber ale I've ever had. It has great hop flavor and a complex mouthfeel. I love it!"
"Moderate carbonation but an explosive head. Fantastic drinkability. I'd like some more."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a clear amber with a nice off white head that falls to fine coat of film that leaves light lacing a on my mug. Smells of nice refreshig piney hops. Tastes wonderful carmel malt with just the right amount of hops, not over bitterr or flavor one could say perfection. A nice well balanced amber brew. Good medium mouthfeel, great drinkability had three wishing I had more :)"
"Drinkablility: The same qualities that lowered the mouthfeel score raise it for drinkability. Dry astringent beer makes you drink more. Always have this on hand."
"12oz bottle: This one poured an absolutely crystal clear orangish-amber color. It had a decent head, but it went down rather quickly. Decent amount of lacing. Grapefruit hops and some spices to the nose. Very smooth and dry to the taste. It has a good hop bite, with a good malt backbone. Even a hint of sweetness in the background. Very Nice!"
"Notes. I compared this to the DFH brew above so if you've had that i will compare against that. I honestly feel that the DFH 60 minutes IPA is a better drink. The only real reason i can say that is i experienced almost no bitterness with the 60 minute from DFH. The sweetness in this Troeg's example is very nice and very substantial but i don't think it is enough to look over the bitter finish. If you enjoy the bitters this would be a nice light drink for you."
"Pours a clear copper/red amber with a moderate beige head that has nice retention, followed by patchy lacing. Outstanding aroma is like a bowl of fresh grapefruit drenched with maple syrup. Notes of spruce pine compliment the profound hop bouquet. Mouthfeel is superlative, as a cluster of hops exploded on your tongue. Nice carbonation and medium bodied feel. Taste is a complex amalgam of big hoppiness. Pine and citrus overwhelm the caramel malt, and other hoppy notes emerge throughout the glassful. Extreme hops here, but I was expecting a bit more balance from the malts. Still a very likeable and highly drinkable amber ale. Certainly a very interesting brew that I look forward to having again."
"Taste is a strong fruity malt. Peachy undertones in its sweetness. Followed by a solid hoppy flavor, well balanced with the malty fruitiness. Again, flavors are nicely balanced. Lightly sticky mouthfeel with a lingering bitter hops finish. Creamy. A very interesting and drinkable ale."
"pours an awesome looking amber colour with a nice sized creamy head. damn near perfect looking for an ale. a distinct hop smell instantly hits you nose along with sweet caramel and slight fruit notes as well as hints of spice. this is a medium bodied brew that is just full of flavour and a joy to drink. very crisp and refreshing. the flavour is more malty and caramel based than you would expect from the smell, which, as mentioned, is quite hopped. hop presence is certainly here, just more subdued than one would anticipate. the finish is nice and smooth with a bit of a creamy, cap'n crunch cereal bite. this was really just a pleasure to drink and a great choice for a session ale. an awesome brew from troegs."
"Thanks to beerluvr for this one."
"Very nice ruby red color with a slight head that adds to this beautiful looking amber ale. There is a hoppy note to this beer but it isn't overpowering. Also present is a hint of fruitiness. This beer leaves you yearning for another sip. The hops are well-proportioned and leave a nice aftertaste in your mouth. I was pleased from my first sample of this beer. This is something I could enjoy any time of the year. Very well-rounded amber ale in short."
"This Troegs delivery pours a golden to amber clear liquid with a nice white head. The lacing was thick and long lasting. The aroma was almost all hops with some citrus undercurrents. The taste was an explosion of hops. There is a definite lemon taste in there but it is a hint that is undetectable after the first beer. This beer has a thick viscuous feel in the mouth and is very bubbly feeling. It is a very easily consumed beer and begs for more than one. All in all, a really good entry from Troegs."
"Big old hop in the nose with grapefruit notes. Creamy thick white head. The color is one of dark peach. Very attractive in the glass. Taste is sweet malty and grassy.. Very very smooth silky mouth. Smooth malty and a nice bitter finish. A wonderful session type of beer."
"Notes: I would called this an amber-IPA. I really like that. Hops are good. Troeg's scores another winner with me."
"Pellucid bronze. Thick, solid, steadfast cream white head leaves sparse lace. Gentle light caramel with biscuit hints permeated by pungent, sweet grapefruit with a floral tinge. Devoid of yeast esters. Simple and inviting in aroma. Flavorwise, it's a facsimile of the aroma. Caramel malt with a bready pale malt foundation is the dominant malt character. Subtle, secondary, sweet cracker like presence. Pink grapefruit hop flavor, along with leafy, tea like hints. Moderate hop bitterness balances the soft male backbone. Lanky body with a lean, overly fluid mouthfeel. Underbaked, doughy biscuit presence augments as the beer breathes. Finishes clean, with fading hints of bread and marmalade. A tasty, simple, but unique amber in its pronounced hop flavor. Light on the palate and superbly drinkable."
"I orderd a second pint so I must say it is very drinkable. The ABV of 6.0 makes it a little strong to be a session brew unless you arent driving anywhere later. Find it and enjoy!"
"This beer is just nice, which is not a death knell, but neither is it an energetic endorsement. It's gentle and balanced, with no outstanding characteristics, but that's not entirely a negative. The mellow balance lends to a drinkable mix of traits. The whole six will be drunk, and not grudgingly, but neither will it flow empty in one sitting. If you sense an ambivalence, you're perceptive, and I think that may stem from the fact that the name would lead you to expect a heavy hops dimension, but it by no means delivers on that allusion. This beer doesn't so much Hop, as it Skips."
"The bitterness pleasantly continues into the aftertaste on the tongue. Some fruit tones are also distinguisable. Medium body ale. Carbonation level was perfect. This is very drinkable as several can be consumed in a session without batting an eye. Kudos to the brewer on this one. Becoming a staple brew in my refridgerator."
"Crystal clear orange amber with an off-white head which lasts. Aroma of sweet crystal malts and citrusy American hops. Flavor begins sweet and then is well balanced by the bitterness. Caramel/crystal malt flavors and then American hops bitterness. The flavor dries out into bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is just a bit thin, but the drinkability is good."
"Overall- Good malt hop balance."
"golden orange with an off white head that is not as big as i thought it should be but it had staying power leaving bits of spotty lace. scents are green leafy and with nectorines and a lemon zest. a bit of butter rounds it out. the flavor is nicely malted along with those hops. very floral and zippy with citrus. a bitter finish that seems to go on and on, lingering nicely on the palate. standard bubbly mouthfeel and very sessionable drinkability."
"True amber color, very clear with a nice head that faded fast with a lingering lace down the side of the glass. Smell was very hoppy with a hint of fruit. The taste was fantastic. Nice and mellow with just enough hops to keep your buds humming and excited. I want to say an almost ""buttery"" quality on the tail end. It just flowed nicely from the hops in the beginning, through the caramel taste in the middle to the smooth end. The mouthfeel was sweet but not overbearing, very clean and light. The drinkability was unsurpassed.... honestly. I don't know one person who couldn't sit down and drink a good number of these and still feel refreshed. I will definitely have to experience more from Troeg's."
"Very glad finally to have tried this beer. Troegs is a favorite brewery, always interesting and usually on the good side of quirky. This is a very refreshing beer."
"Comments: Excellent beer offering from Chris and John. This brewery is evolving into something very special. Pick up this or any one of their samplings soon!"
"Pours a lovely clear copper color under a small off-white head that lasts a long time and leaves a good scattering of lace dots on the glass. The nose is hoppy, but not as strong as many other IPAs. The mouth is prickly and slightly heavy, with just a touch of citrus sour. There's not much malt here, but the hops are quite tame, so it isn't missed. The hops are flowery, with a touch of grapefruit and grass. There's a good bitter aftertaste that makes you want more. This is a good brew, but I prefer my IPAs a little bit more aggressive."
"Pours a deep amber under a huge creamy head. The aroma is bold and spicy with a floral character. The first sip is well-rounded with an up-front floral spice and a building flush of sweet caramel malt. A moderate bitterness sneaks out between the balanced flavors and levels off at a crisp finish. Easy drinking and tasty."
"Drinkability: This is purty good.. one could drink a few of these with no complaint. Might make a nice session beer."
"I drank this beer while taking a tour of the Troegs brewery in Harrisburg, PA. I found it so delicious, I kept going back to the taps to refill my glass. It has a perfect amber color topped by a substantial white head. A strongly floral hop aroma wafts from the glass without any prompting. The flavor is slightly of toasted malt at first, then the hops make a full frontal assault. It is a good clean bitterness. A slightly fruity note is detectable in the background. It has a nice mouthfeel, not too full for the style. I wish this beer was more available in my area."
"Wow, this beer should be better known. Like most good American ambers this is yet another unique turn on a widely varying style, leaning to what a pale ale or IPA might be but undeniably still an amber."
"Yet another kick ass brew from one of my favorite brewers. I have heard comparisons to Hop Devil. I can see it to a point. The Devil, to me is more bitter overall, while the Hopback is more hop-flavor explosive. It would be interesting to do a head to head comparison."
"Thanks BA forum for pointing out this as mega hoppy beer."
"BTW, does this come in Bombers?"
"A great candidate for a session brew, easily consumed, but a reminder is always around the corner of how good a beer can taste. Well done, Troegs!"
"Pours a reddish dark amber color with a tall creamy light tan colored head that slowly fades into a solid patch of lace. Nose is sweet caramel malts blended with some floral and grassy hops. Medium in body with a slightly buttery texture. Taste is sweet malts up front perfectly balanced by the following bitter hops with notes of acidic citrus. A dry bitterness remains on the tongue in a lasting aftertaste. This is a very nice amber ale and would make a great session beer. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!"
"Appears amber with a copper tint and a huge billowing head with trickled lace surrounding my pint. This is one balanced brew in my opinion the aroma is balanced between sweet caramel malt and floral eathy pine scented hops, so balanced it's just about the perfect beer. This is one reason why Troegs has done what it has, and with it's oatmeal stout truly one PA's finest micros out there I must say. The taste is also truly balanced with a trace of the hops adding a bittering quality with the malt waves following blending perfectly to form a hopback amber ale. Medium to light bodied very good beer with no off tones to it everything here is like butter, what can I say. The drinkability level is unlike any other amber ale out there it's perfect, I love this beer."
"People have recommended Troegs to me in the past, and I can now see why. The amber ale is a quality brew, and Troegs may well be the best kept beer secret of all the Pennsylvania breweries."
"Thanks to Francisweizen for the bottle."
"(Two Troegs beers now for me and two outstanding beers....As I work my way through some East Coast Breweries this one is starting to shine brighter than some of the others although I still have some work....ummmm...tasting to do with many more brands and beers...)"

"Pours a deep amber color, but is very clear and initially has a thick tan head. There's no hunting for the aroma; it's instant and intense hop flowers. Very herbal and very fresh american hops. The beer is certainly on- sided, but there is a notable attempt to balance the hoppiness with a malt backbone. Finish is hoppy, but not necessarily bitter. Medium fullness, and quite satisfying. No question in my mind that this is an IPA...and not a bad one either."
"Wow a really nice beer,smell was great-grassy hop with some balancing caramel sweetness,poured a nice amber color with a nice medium head left a good lacing.Taste was of herbal hop to begin with the nutty maltness came thru in the end to really balance this one out nicely.Very well made brew will be looking for more from Troegs after this one!"
"However, the hop flavor is not dominant at all. It starts off with citrusy hops and a bitter middle, then has a bready malt finish. I prefer their Pale Ale to this (I'm a hophead and I can't help it), but this beer is extremely well balanced. Not very complex, but still enough to keep things interesting. Would make a great session brew."
"It says amber ale, but I say it's an ipa. Possibly at the level of hopdevil in my mind. Pours clear amber in color with a well retained head. Hops are spicy and citrusy and the malts do well in adding balance to this brew. I'm glad I live in the Philly area or else I may have never heard of troegs."
"Disappointingly, the HopBack Amber is replacing the ESB at Troegs, according to the brewers. The ESB was one of the finest American ales I've tasted and, though the HopBack Amber is a good beer, it's certainly not on the level of the ESB. The HopBack Amber is much less interesting and overall the just doesn't have the character and the uniqueness of the ESB."
"A nice crisp brew with an excellent hop character. Malts are light and sweet to balance, but the hops really provide the flavor here. The spiciness gets together with a ruby red grapefruit flavor and then dries leaving you with another kick of spice. A nice drinker any time of the year. This is one you can keep around with you for a while."
"In my review of Troegs ESB, I said it needed a little something to make it special. I understand that Hopback is to replace the ESB, and it easily fulfills my request. This is an excellent beer and a confused one. It is an amber ale, but also ventures into IPA and ESB territory. I would say that Troegs is sailing a new flagship. Heartily recommended."
"Hazy amber in color with a thich persistent white head that was quite easy on the eyes. Cleany hop aromas of citrus and spice come through and eventually yeild to a caramel malt sweetness. Flavor is largely hop dominated and a little to hoppy for the style. The malt does come through and make it's presence known in such a way to discount being able to call this an IPA. Bitterness leaves a dry bite on the back of the tongue. Overall a very good beer, but wary of the hops if you are expecting a good amber."
"Pours a medium copper color with amber highlights. A thick, creamy head that fades ever so slowly into a thin layer of foam tops the rather clear body. It is easily roused by a simple swirl of the glass. The aroma has a strong citrus note, but it is very clean. The first taste is all citrus hops, but the next taste reveals some buttery malt notes, mixed with a touch of caramel and some brown sugar. There is ample bittering on the finish as well. This tastes more like an IPA than a traditional amber ale. The mouthfeel is full and very enjoyable, with just the right amount of carbonation. The drinkability is excellent. This is a very enjoyable brew. Time to seek out a case of this one. My friends may get to know the Trogner Brothers soon, as this may be a staple of the summer beer supply."
"Pours out with a cream colored head over very clear amber liquid. Lots of citrusy hops in the nose...Cascades could they be?? Also some malt thrown in there as well. Taste is medium bodied maltiness, some fruitiness. Both step aside for a crashing wave of hop bitterness, crisp and bracing 'til some malty sugar sweetness reappears then both come together in harmony to form a nice balanced finish."
"This beer was pretty straightforward. From the name it was easy to tell what the major hop contributions would be. A nicely put together beer. I have a feeling that once the weather stays consistently warm there will be room for this in my fridge."
"The aroma is all over hops and a little bit of bitterness. The flavor speaks of the same, with some punch, but not too much hops. A very good brew, to say the least. Prost!"
"The aroma had a heavy citrus tang (grapefruits?) along with some floral notes. The body was a bit light. Taste was light and refreshing, slightly citrusy with a light malt sweetness. Very drinkable and refreshing. I could easily make this an everyday beer for me. I look foward to trying other beers from this brewery."
"Medium amber with thick, dens off white head that sticks to the sides. Citrus hop aroma. Medium sweet maltiness that finishes well with a spicy floral hop bite (but not a huge hop bite). Bit heavier mouthfeel. I had to give this a lower drinkability due to the malty heaviness. That's not a bad characteristic but I would have a hard time with more than two of these."
"This beer poured a beautifully clear amber color, and while held to the light the bubbles danced elegantly in the glass. The head was fairly thick and a off-white color that seemed to last fairly well full and then as a thin film to the end of the glass. The aroma was very fresh (at first I thought it was because I was at the brewery drinking it, but then realized while I talked to the 2 Troeg brothers that it was the excellent use of fresh quality products). I smelled fresh hops (nature-grass, flowers, citrus and some spice), there was a slight malt aroma to it but I really over looked it due to the great hop aroma. The taste was smooth and well balanced. Soft hops (grass, and flowers) were the prominent flavors that were present, but I noticed hints of sweet malt in the middle of the mild hop flavor, which took over the rest of the flavors till the end. It finished with some mild hop spices left on the tongue and in the throat, but not over powering. This beer was very smooth and very pleasing to the taste buds. I look forward to drinking more in the future."
"Pours a pleasant copper-amber color. Nice head, small bubbles, long lasting, leaves a nice lace around the glass as it slides down. Outstanding aroma of fresh hops, the label description makes it sound like this beer is being constantly circulated around fresh whole leaf hops as it's brewed. Very malty flavor given the heavy hop aroma with just the right amount of hop bitterness, a very nice blend. Nice bitter aftertaste and smooth mouthfeel. A very drinkable session beer. This beer seemed very Rogue-like, just not quite as hoppy. I was at the Great American Beer Festival in the Pocono's in November 02 and was very dissappointed to hear that Troeg's was discontinuing their ESB, which I thought was a great American micro version of the English classic. They told me that this was to be the replacement and this is my first tasting. Not as good as the ESB in my opinion, but an excellent beer none the less. I will definitely buy this again."
"If there's one thing that defines the Troeg's beers it's drinkability, and this one is a real charmer! It pours a clear, very deep amber body that's capped by a creamy off-white head. The head drops shortly to a thin creamy surface covering, but maintains it throughout the entire glass and leaves some spotty lace as well. The aroma, however, establishes this beer as something special! Fresh hops burst forth as if you had them cupped in your hands and you could rub them between your fingers releasing the floral, softly grassy, and lightly spicy aromas! Really enticing! The body is medium/light with a very fine and moderate carbonation that's lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor melds a rich caramel maltiness with grassy and floral hop flavors. As it warms in the mouth a gentle sweetness comes forth and accentuates some of the more floral flavors of the hops. It finishes lightly dry with a lingering caramel-laced malt note and a gently spicy hop character. The hop bitterness is well restrained, keeping it quite drinkable (and accessible), and allows for an interplay between the flavors of the sweet malt and hops that's rarely seen! Although the serious hop head may be let down by this beer because of it's moderate bitterness, I think that most beer lovers will find it's ability to combine and balance the malt and hops in such a unique way very interesting and highly enjoyable."

"Much better than average amber, nice reddish amber color, with a good head that held well, and nice ringing lace. Hop flavor in the beginning, middle and end, but not over done. Subtle malt flavor in the beginning, and tart finish that is indeed very drinkable. Good beer!"
