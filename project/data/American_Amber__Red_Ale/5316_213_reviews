"Somehow I kept passing over Full Sail even though it's widely available and I kept meaning to try it.  So I finally did.  It's your basic amber, which at this point almost seems a little boring compared to some of the experiments that are out there, but sometimes you just want a good solid beer, and this fits the bill.  Nicely balanced, not heavy at all, very drinkable."

"O: It is a quality beer that didn't cost much comparatively and the flavor and feel were in the pocket IMO.  I would recommend this one and would drink it again."
"Another one of my favorites that took me by surprise a bit. Heftier than you think it'll be but my goodness is it tasty."
""
"O: A good lager, with clean taste and piney happens."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a great beer!"

"O: There's a lot to like about this beer, and the flavors far more dynamic than I expected. The initial sip is fantastic. Unfortunately the finish is a little funky and unpleasant, which I hope is just a product of the particular bottle I was drinking. However, I will most certainly buy this again (and it's relatively cheap too!)."

"This, and Bells are my two favorite ambers."

"Medium amber with a half inch of foamy dissipating head. Foamy lacing. A solid toasted malt scent, and the Flavors mirror the scent....malt forward. Full bodied for an ale. Solid but unremarkable."
""
""
"Very well made and it goes down smooth, the hops are just right and the flavors are well balanced."

"Overall: Why have I never had this stuff before. Very, VERY impressed with this brew. I've been obsessed with RIS's and other stouts lately and wanted to explore a bit into lighter colored ale's. Glad I picked this one at random."

"Poured a clear amber body with a two finger white head that slowly receded leaving abundant lacing down the glass. Quite the nice looking amber ale. Scents of rich, malty, fruity esters, low levels of nuttiness and caramel aromas and an earthy hoppy and yeasty presence. Overall impression of aroma is of a very rich and malty bouquet with enough of a hop presence to provide a hint of balance. Quite nice. Flavor begins malty sweet, with heavy notes of caramel, sweet, bready malt and very light bitterness. This moves into a little bit more bitter middle with nutty malt, sweet caramel, light fruity esters and light toasted malt. The finish is malty sweet, with moderate toasted, nutty malt, light caramel, bready and biscuit-like malt with a medium-light bitterness. Aftertaste is nutty and toasted malt with a light breadiness and bitterness. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a pretty good amber ale that is quite rich and malty, but balanced. Rather well done. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with heavy carbonation and a smooth, rich feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of a nice session ale that is quite nice. Overall this is a pleasant little malty amber ale. It smells and tastes quite rich and pleasant and feels smooth and sessionable. A nice, though not amazing, ale."
"O: One of my favorite Amber's, an excellent sessionable, year-round brew."

"O- Very easy drinking and highly enjoyable. Nothing about the beer is outstanding, but nothing about it is bad either.  A solid American Amber."

"This is an excellent example of this style and an old favorite of mine.  I bought a six pack of this on sale for $6.19.  It has a ""best before"" date of November 3, 2014, a little over two months from now."

"Picked up a bottle of this today at my local ""Whole Paycheck (Foods)"". I poured it into a pub glass. It had a very nice foamy head with some staying power. The appearance was dark colored. I could definitely taste the hops in this one. Full Sail Amber is an very good beer and Id love to have it again."
""
""
"Overall: Still a classic after all these years – a fine early-autumn beer for a Northeasterner like me"
""
""
""
""
"O - Reminds me a bit of the Deschutes Red Chair or a Hoppy Blonde from Columbia Kettle Works. I like that it has very nice flavor and feel at 5.5% ABV. I'll have this again."
""
""
""
""
"It's an easy drinking and enjoyable amber."
""
""
""
"Notes: Poured into a clean U.S.-style tumbler from a glass bottle, served chilled."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark amber with a reddish tint and very minimal head. Smells of sweet toasted caramel and a bit of roast. Maybe slightly oxidized. The taste is pleasant with perceivable earthy hoppiness, a medium amount a maltiness from crystal malt and definitely some roasted malt in there too. A small taste of cola. Nice and refreshing carbonation but thin body. Overall a nice take on an Amber, but could possibly fit in Brown Ale category too."

"Coming from a person who doesn't like ales too much, this is a good beer. Very balanced taste. The hops are noticeable but not overwhelming, perhaps less so than Boston Lager. It has a nice dark amber color (imagine that). The smell is what bothers me. To me the smell isn't very attractive for a beer but besides that its a fine beer."

"Overall - A damn fine beer. Compared to Fat Tire (the motivation for this review), this has a bit more complexity that I feel comes from more substantial hopping. I wouldn't say this is a ""better"" beer than Fat Tire by any means, both have their place. However, it certainly lets the hops come out and play more assertively yet still maintains good balance."

"A well done amber ale. Nicely balanced hop and malt notes. I had passed by this for years now, and finally realized I hadn't tried it. I'm glad I gave it a shot!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather balanced amber overall. Not too sweet, not too malty, and not too hoppy. Overall an enjoyable brew."
""
"O: Just a so-so IPA"
""
""
""
"O: I liked this beer and I would have it again. I like more hops in my beer and I am going to seek out an Amber Ale with more hops."
""
"I really enjoy a good amber ale, and this one was simply okay. There was relatively little head to it which disappointed right off the bat. The color is a deeper, true amber with caramel-ish, toffee-ish aroma. I felt the taste was a bit flat but would not refuse one of these poured from a tap. Perhaps it was the bottle pour but the label says ""ridiculously tasty"" which I did not get from this beer."

"Cheeers!!!"
""
""
""

"It pours a murky caramel color. There’s a slight caramel malt aroma. The flavor is dominated by a caramel-malt profile that veers overly sweet. This beer comes off as cloying and syrupy. Not one I expect to have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I found this to be a nice amber ale. Just not a great one. I think even just a slightly bigger body would have made this much more enjoyable. The ""down the hatch"" mouthfeel reminded me of a light American lager. Not a compliment, in my opinion. But the taste and aroma were far superior to any of those big label beers, that's for sure. This is a beer that's just as ""poundable"" as a Budweiser, but far more tasty. Maybe Bud should buy the recipe."

"Pours deep copper with a fluffy off white head that left plenty of lacing behind. Nose was malt perfection. Breaddy, caramel, a hint of Belgian, and a dash of chocolate. Some fruity hops lightly in back to promise a little earth and bite. Subtle and enticing in it’s look and nose. On the palate it’s heavenly smooth and deliciously malt forward without heaviness. Toasted grain sweetness, mellow rich malt and a playful touch of hops bitter and oily pine to keep it interesting. Sweet meets bitter in perfect harmony. As it warms the hops add a little spice to the aftertaste and with a bitter swish it finishes long yet gentle. This is a smart and well turned out amber. One I would go back to again and again."
"It kept a nice flavor in my mouth each time I put it down--sort of a nutty flavor that I enjoyed. Having tried another Full Sail product tonight, I feel I can put these both down as simple, reliable beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: There's a lot of flavor crammed into this beer. It over achieves somewhat, as most people don't expect too much from an unassuming amber ale. One of the best readily available ambers on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Malts lead the way in both the aroma and taste. Sweet and tasty brew (I like malty, sweet beers), caramel and dark fruit hints hide the alcohol well and I really enjoyed this beer, my last in New York before re-joining my cruise ship after a day wandering around and drinking."
""
"Just a good, hearty beer, extremely well crafted, filling, and refreshing."
"O- Full Sail makes a good amber. A balanced beer where one attribute doesnt outweigh the other."

"Full Sail Amber has a thin-to-medium, off-white head and a slightly bubbly, clear, amber appearance, with a bit of lacing left behind. The aroma is of sweet, fruity, brown-bread malt, and the flavor is of those elements with a pleasant hop bitterness at the end of the sip. Mouthfeel is light to medium, and Full Sail Amber finishes semi-dry, refreshing, and easy drinking. Overall, this is a most excellent beer. RJT"

"A very enjoyable beer, definitely a nice amber ale."
"I poured this lovely beer in to a pint glass, I am not sure if this is the traditional choice for an amber ale but boy did it work. Right off the bat, it produced a very nice creamy and aromatic head. The initial taste is slightly sweet and malty, pure yummy. The beer does have a rather strong hoppy aftertaste for my personal choice, but that is not uncommon amongst this type of beer. This is definitely a very good quality beer. Pair is nicely with a flavorful curry or some grilled spicy meat. Not outstanding, a very good price and a great pair for flavorful food, try it!"
"Overall between this and the IPA I think I am loving this brewery. Worthy of a 10 dollar mixed six pack."
""
"This is an excellent Amber Ale!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malty, some caramel. Taste is well balanced malts and hops, a bit of caramel, tasty and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a solid beer."
"A favorite of our patrons down in the panhandle. This ale registers high in drinkability and overall flavor. Compared to a Fullers London Pride or CCB Tocabaga, it might fall short, but for an ""amber"" ale, I'd give it a chance. A fair addition to a menu, paired best with a Turkey Rueben or Cheese Fries."
""
"Cheers!"

"I want my beers to jump out of the bottle and into the glass and as such, I am heavy-handed with my pour. This was no exception and I quickly had two fingers of dense, tawny head head with great retention staring at me. Color was the dictionary definition of deep-amber, plus NE-plus quality, to boot. They certainly know how to clarify their beers in Hood River. Nose was nutty, not nutty like me, but more like pecans, walnuts, almonds, that sort of thing. Say, don't I remember something untoward about a bitter almond smell in liquids? Nah, I must be mistaken. Mouthfeel was medium and it really had a nutty flavor to it on the tongue. Finish had a minty hoppiness to go along with the nuttiness noted previously. I am not a huge fan of ambers, unless they are the hot redhead giving me a lap dance, but this was eminently drinkable. Now, if they would just CAN their beers, I would be a total fan ..."
"A solid beer thoug ordinary and plain. But good."
"Overall - A great amber. Very approachable, and just enough flavor to keep the beer geek in me satisfied. Can't believe I got this beer for $3.99/sixer. Killer steal of a deal."

"One of the first amber beers I ever had (back in the 1990s) and it is still great. I am not able to find it in Indiana, but had a friend pack some down from Minnesota for me. Just awesome."
""
""
""
"O- The aroma on this beer was very pleasant. I will say the booziness in the flavor was a turnoff for such a low ABV beer, just odd, maybe something was off."

"Not a lot of alcohol in this either, making it a decent session beer for those inclined to have more than one at a time. While not a bright knockout like fuller Amber and Red Ales, this was dry enough to warrant a big glass of water after the serving. It was like the other Full Sail beers that I had - accessible, middle of the road, and sure to offend no one, while being a good take on its namesake style. The aftertaste had a slight burnt tone to it, making this a great choice for the days when Fall is in full swing."
""
""
"I can tell there is lots of quality in this beer. Initial taste and smell was great, I just didn't love the slightly flowery and bitter finish as much."

"The weekend is here and I’ve purchased a six pack of Full Sail Amber beer. The appearance is dark-reddish with a Tan Lace. A quick sniff detects an aromatic aroma of fruity citrus hops mixed with toasted malts. The flavor is a medium-light fruity body, mild bitterness, caramel smooth with moderate carbonation. All told, this Amber Ale is ridiculously tasty and has everything that I love about American craft breweries."
"This is what an Amber Ale should taste like. Full Sail did a real good job."
""
""
""
"I'm not a fan of Amber's right now (going through a Bitter's / Pale Ales phase). This one's good for the style though, and for the season! Ho, ho, ho!"

"Good brew, well done amber ale, enjoyable, easily drinkable."

"Pours a very appealing and crystal clear ruby amber with two fingers of creamy head and good retention. Nose is a bit disapointing after the great eye show. Pale malt and a touch of caramel dominate, with a bit of citrus and earthy hop and some fruity esters. With such low hop character, I'm questioning the age of my sample right now. Taste follows with a nicely balanced malty profile backed by hop and fruity esters. Bigger caramel here with a decent bittering and touch of citrus. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, easy drinker. Overall a decent beer, but the appearance was definitely the highlight."
""
""
"Overall, this brew would pair great with almost anything. It is a sessionable amber that is great for a cold season. Cheers!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a deep red with a one finger off white head that dissipates semi quickly but leaves lacing. Smells of darkly roasted malt, very rich, but that is about it. Tastes of roasted malt and slight flowery hop flavor, very nice touch. Light bodied beer goes down wonderfully with perfect carbonation. Overall, a very good beer."

"An okay, malty-tasting, fairly bland, amber ale."
""
"A solid amber from Full Sail. It pours a dark red body with a really thick foamy head. Strong malt presence plays with some hops and a caramel & fruity flavor to boot. I think it's a pretty good beer, not one of the best ambers out there, but one that's worth trying."
""
"O: This is just a wonderful beer with a great balance of hops flavor, bitterness and malt sweetness. It's a moderately rich beer with a nice weight but I'd gladly throw back several pints of this."
""
""
""
""
"It pours a hazy amber with a two finger thick fluffy, white head that dissipates quite quickly but laces quite well. On the nose there's not much going on, some roast malts, a little caramel, raisins/grapes, biscuits and bread, though all very weak and not overly appetizing. The taste follows the nose, though the malts shine through. It's quite sweet with a little hop bitterness following through on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is really water with a tiny bit of carbonation. Overall it's a really drinkable beer, quite nice for the heat of the day and would probably go well with some BBQ, but other than that, not much going for it, not worth getting a whole sixer of it and not worth much effort in searching out."
""
""
""

""

"A solid amber. Nothing too exciting but drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Another okay beer from Full Sail. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this, but its still pretty good."
""
""
""
"Easy drinking amber that is all about malts and a bit of spicy playfulness. Great for a change of pace, but a bit sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a respectable amber; could do with less carbonation"
""
""
"Pours a dark copper with a thin layer of off-white head. No distinct smells, but reminded me of a lager (Yuengling) with a similar look. Taste was good but I felt it lacked a ""star flavor"" meaning that it was just plain but with long-lasting aftertaste. Overall, not my favorite beer. I would certainly try it again down the road, but for now it's so-so."
""
""
""
""
"I used to drink this a decent amount when I was back in Portland, before I was of age, so when I saw it at the Union Sq. Whole Foods yesterday, I had to grab one. It pours a clear deep amber, with a respectable head. The nose has some sweet, toasted malt, but also a little bit of corn (something off). The taste was close to what I remember, but once again there was something off, quality wise, a bit of sulfur, and a bit too much diacetyl. It also wasn't quite as full as I would've liked. Overall, it was OK, but not what I was hoping it would be. Is Full Sail doing something differently, or has the nostalgia just worn off?"
""
""
""
"O: Taste grows on me as I work my way down the bottle, but overall I think it's a bit too sweet for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a solid offering. Mild, pleasant, refreshing, and sessionable. Along with Session, one of two Full Sail beers you're likely to find in my fridge."
""
""
""
"Hands downs this is an American amber ale that will always look forward to sipping. Perfect balanced"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting amber, perhaps a bit lighter in taste and body than I would anticipate, yet very satisfying overall. Well-balanced and very drinkable."
""
"Overall Drinkability: If I had judged this book by its cover, I would have liked it a lot. However, the important parts don't hold water."
""
""
"The moderate head crests a little below a finger’s worth of eggshell white foam, dissipates in a big rush down to a thin layer across the surface, what meager lacing there is sticks adequately. The liquid is more brown than copper, likewise more red than orange, very clear and transparent, extremely few bubbles visible. The nose conveys sweetness via caramel, milk chocolate, pecans and yeast, comes up with a little citrus and herbal hops but remains tame overall, when the floral notes appear they support the sweeter profile, difficult to name any particular fruit aspect. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is on the low side causing it to feel semi-flat on the palate. Drier here with grass, pine, white pepper and sea salt nuances, at the same time there’s nuts, graham cracker, caramel and chocolate to bring it back to the middle. Which is where it resides, pleasurable but playing it safe. Fruitier through the finish with apple, peach and apricot notes. Hard to really fault it but, at the same time, doesn’t get you too excited to pop open another."

"Pours a nice dark amber with a slight head. Smell is of the caramel malt, but nothing really beyond that. Flavor wise is pretty strright up sweet malts, maybe a touch of some floral hops in there; it teeters on the line between enjoyably sweet and too sweet for me, landing on the right side of it when all is said and done. A medium body to this one. It's perfectly decent and priced right, but certainly not the most memorable amber I have had."
""
""
"o - solid sessionable amber."

"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a thick off-white, long lasting head, a lot of lacing and carbonation. Fine aroma of caramel; ripe fruit hints of hops and chocolate. Medium, creamy body. Taste is balanced between caramel malt, light earthy hops with hints of cherry and chocolate. Finish is long and bitter. Tasty session brew."
""
"Overall, I really disliked this beer. It looks, smells, and feels like a solid amber ale, but the sweetness just kills it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is quite average. The flavor profile is pretty subdued and mellow, and the nose and mouthfeel do nothing to change the experience. I probably won't ever seek this out."
""
"A very tasty Amber Ale that does all that the style perscribes. But more malt richness and less one-dimensional sweetness could have resulted in a better balanced American Amber Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"The appearance turned out nice. The lacing followed me all the way down the glass, it was a little patchy, but overall it was pretty full. The body was nice, and the head wasn't bad. I'll give it a 4 because the lacing was damn good, and everything else wasn't too bad."
""
"The color is an alluring amber hue. fantastic bubbly head that leaves lacing behind on the glass. The aroma consists of fruity esters and floral hop notes, not unlike a good IPA. The flavor of the beer is very clean with a hint of lemon, like spring water, giving way to hop flavors and a malt finish. Medium bodied with a mouth feel leaving me wanting more. Very refreshing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O: This is a solid American amber/red ale that is a bit more flavorful than most. Overall, it's a pretty good beer and is a decent representation of this style."
""
""
""
"A very solid amber and if this is how you like your amber, it might be among the best. I like a bit more hops and less density in the malt, but that's a personal preference."
"Overall Drinkability - The acidic/bitter lime peel aftertaste lingers a bit too long for a beer that doesn't offer very strong hop characters in the taste."
"OVERALL: Aside from the slight pucker at the end of the sip, this is a pretty drinkable beer. It is a little on the heavier, maltier and darker side for an amber, but remains a very easy drinker. I would drink this one again, but I probably won't go out of my way for it."
"Overall: Sweet and balanced flavorful ale. This is accessible and affordable."
"Gearin up for a doubleheader of Michigan footbal and the Tigers ALCS game one.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep rich amber with a creamy one finger slight off white top,love the creaminess of the head.Toast and fruity easters in the nose with a light shot of leafy hop in a passing whiff.Toasty and a little buttery on the palate with some caramel malt giving it mild sweetness,light fruity esters and a nice shot of leafy cone hops in the back end make this amber very drinkable.This is a great amber,for me almost a standard,well done."
"Good stuff. I liked it quite a bit...while it was certainly a malty beer, it wasn't over the top and it was extremely drinkable. Impressed."
"Idk why but i had a lot of trouble pin pointing exact flavors that this beer has within it but maybe thats because it's more of a simple beer which i really appreciate. When i initially tried it i instantly recognized it was a simple amber drinking beer just done extremely well and nicely balance. not too malty like others i've had."
"CONCLUSION: This is what you might call a session beer, for sure. However, just one is nice if you're in the mood for a good amber. It is quite different than other leaders in this style like New Belgium, but I think it may actually be more accurate. If you're expecting something spectacular you will be disappointed, but if you're expecting a proper amber you will get just that. Hey, and I don't even really dig this style!"
"This was great freshly opened and lost some edge with a little time. Poured a 2.5"" beige head. Color is a deep clear amber, almost auburn when held to the light. There's a nice smell of caramel and malt. Taste is fairly sweet and malty with a slightly bitter finish. Less than half way through the beer though it seemed to lose some of that taste and smell and become a more average beer."
"Overall: You know...this is one hell of a session beer. I can drink this one all night. I also had this one on-tap at a hotel and I drank more than I probably should have. It sneaks up on you and its so palatable that you can totally drink it for a long evening. I don't particularly like this style all that much, but something about Oregon, this beer, and a mild evening in downtown Salem has stuck with me."
"Taste and Mouthfeel: A very nice balance beer that wiill get in me in trouble tonight. Nice hop finish."
"This is an excellent beer. It has a nice aroma, taste great, is well balanced and easy to drink."
"Pours a nice clear red amber hue with nice off white head. Caramel malt and fruity esters fill the nose. Taste is sweet caramel malt some light fruitiness and some yeast. Palate is a nice medium body with good carbonation. Has a nice caramel malt finish with some nice fruity notes and some yeast followed by nice hoppiness with a light lingering nutty flavor. Overall a very nice and solid amber ale"
"A really quite solid amber ale with good flavour and a nice hoppy finish."
"O: Looks and smells just okay. The taste is alright. Has the right amount of hop flavor and I get a nice toasted finish, but there's not enough there overall."
"Overall: A solid amber/red ale. The smell is lacking and the taste could be a little stronger or interesting. Not bad but not great."
"O- A nice representation of the style, but I felt like something was missing to really draw me in."
"O: Solid amber. Good flavor. Not a twist off regardless of what the bottle cap says."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a thin head. Decent head retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malts, citrus hops and a faint nutty note. Taste is caramel malts, leafy citrus hops, a bit of toasted grain and a bitter finish. Medium bodied. Tasty beer, but probably not something I would buy all the time."
"very light, which to be honest kinda dissapointed me. What I could pick up was very grainy and boring with big notes of cereal grain very apparent as well as a musty kinda of bread smell. Some light grassy hops were present way in the back but to be honest were really a non issue as this was dominate by a musty bread like malt. big time musky bready like flavor that just was too strong to really get anything else to come out from behind it. There was a slight hoppiness in the finish, but again I stress light as it was really not a factor in the overall flavor. This was truly a malty lager and really not the normal flavor I would expect from the style but thats neither here not there."
"Overall. Decent amber with a decent hop presence."
"O/D-Not a big fan. I absolutely love Amber/Red ales that are big and bold. This is the opposite. Just bland and boring. Nothing else to say."
"So far my favorite beer of the summer."
"The beers that I poured from the bottles were lightly carbonated with little to no head. It did leave sporadic bits of lace on the glass while being drunk. The taste was somewhat disappointing for me. A little bit harsh for an amber I thought. The bitterness was a little strong and quite unexpected. It did have a nice mouth feel to it. This beer would probably go well with grilled red meats or BBQ. I was hoping for a little more from this beer but thought it was ok."
"O - A nice deviation from the ambers of the northeast. Certianly worth a try."
"Everything an Amber should be with a west coast spin with the hop choice. I'm in love."
"Overall a tasty well balanced ale."
"O – Middle of the river amber red to me. It has some flavor but is not as assertive as I like. All told this is a drinkable brew but I was not blown away."
"O- A good beer to have if your at a BBQ or something. A good session beer but far from a top tier amber."
"O: Like a lot of Full Sail beers I've had, this was a let down."
"Light body. Watery and refreshing. Lightly browned malt is the main flavor. Crisp with sharp tones overwhelm the initial bit of sweetness. Enough hops to balance the warmth of caramel and bready flavors. Slight bitterness holds up the aftertaste with a dirty Perfectly drinkable example of this catch-all style."
"Overall: Quite drinkable and refreshing."
"Recommended."
"D: very accessible to drink, especially in numbers. A bit sweet at times but 3-4 will go down without much thought. Good casual pub style amber."
"This is one bangin' beer, I had high expectations going in and the beer impressed me even further. Poured nice and amber with big thick tan head, thick lace drags down the glass. Big malt smell with light fruity aromas mingled in. The taste is great, biscuity, light leaf and citrus hopping. Again, big malt occurring in the taste, with some definite, caramel malts to chew on. The body of the beer is where I become further impressed, it's so thick, so smooth, so creamy, it's almost as if it's on nitro, but it's not. Feels like a big boozer as well, but it's only 5.5%. Excellent amber."
"Pours a clear dark amber/copper color with a nice 2 inch beige head that fades to a thin cap on the top of the beer. Nice puffy rings of lace settle around the glass on the drink down. Smells of toasty malts and citrus zest hops. A fairly standard amber beer smell. Taste is a bit better with bready malt and citrus zest flavors. Very mild hop bitterness that quickly fades after each sip. Beer has a pretty good level of carbonation and is somewhat clean and smooth. Overall, an above average amber beer but nothing too special."
"This is my first beer rating so I will fumble through it. I try to try a new beer every week and the week I choose Full Sail Amber I was truley impressed. It poured a beautiful red amber color and had a nice fruity smell. And he best the flavor was super. It was t"
"I liked it."
"As a style, I often find amber ales to be a little boring. Full Sail has corrected my misconception. Not with a big hop infusion or high ABV% but by craftily blending flavors together in a way that shows the brewers true talents. This sixer won't last long."
"Overall: Very solid beer. It's mild hop bitterness and balance makes it a highly drinkable beer."
"Overall: This is a really good sessionable amber."
"D: The beer goes down very easily and is quite sessionable."
"Good balance. This is one of Full Sail's more palatable and drinkable brews."
"Overall: Solid beer overall. It's not going to knock your socks off, but I don't think that's what is intended. It is a well-balanced amber ale that is very drinkable. I wouldn't hesitate to try this one again."
"Drink - While the beer won't knock your socks off, it has a pleasant taste and would be highly sessionable. I'm happy I tried it and wouldn't mind trying it fresh on tap."
"Clear, deep amber with a thin cap of fine beige bubbles. Looks nice. Mild malty aroma, brown sugar, light roasted and toasted malts. Low bitterness, malty up front with some citrus and hop spice, toasted malts. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, dry in texture. Quite tasty and easy drinking. Nicely balanced."
"T: Some pretty strong caramel malts with a gentle, floral hop finish. Some caramel and citrus thrown in, but not as much flavor as I feel like there should be. Pretty unremarkable."
"The beer was a dark brownish red color, The head was thick, bubbly, off-white and faded quickly. It smells mostly of nutty, toasted malts. I could also smell an earthy hop presence. The taste first has a slight lemon bite followed by some sweet, toasted caramel malt, there is a bready undertones and a slight pine bitterness. The beer is light-medium with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a great amber, I don't drink very many ambers but this one had a nice bitter finish, right up my alley."
"Drinkability: Your standard amber ale: easily replaceable, easily forgettable. While there's absolutely nothing ""wrong"" with this beer, there's nothing to make me ever want to have it again. It's pretty much the same as the other 100 amber ales out there. You could certainly do worse, but you could easily do much, much better."
"Verdict: Perfect for any time of the year, this beer won't WOW any seasoned beer lovers, but newbies might just find this to be a standard in their fridge."
"Overall, I had a single and was glad I just had one. Dry and mild bitterness, this one trick pony didn't really do it for me. Not horrible by any means, but just not my thing."
"Drinkability is real easy on this one, not exactly bold, but a real easy drink beer with good qualities to detect."
"D- Full Sail Amber is absolutely delicious. Sweet and toasty flavors make it very drinkable. Wow this was good on tap! I am going to have to grab a sixer"
"Drinkability: Excellent. I could drink these all day. Pairs well with a variety of foods and holds up on its own. Good job Full Sail."
"Full Sail Amber comes out amber like with a golden brown look and just enough bubbles to sustain a cap for a few minutes, a dark tan color on those bubbles, no stick though. Smell is str8 forward caramel and some small chocolate. Crystal malt is noted while a small hopping comes through, that's all I look for really in a amber, can't stand str8 caramel, personally. Taste is basically the same, Im impressed this is not so sweet and the hops hold their own in this fairly fresh bottle. Feel is less than medium but coating with some light carb running through it's vains, by no means bitey in any way. I drank it I enjoyed it, lets leave it at that."
"D- Very easy to drink."
"Taste is similarly fruity with orange syrup and maraschino cherry taking the lead. Again, more toasted bread would be appreciated. Despite all the fruity esters mouthfeel isn't as juicy some amber ales - which is a good thin IMO."
"Poured a clear, golden amber with a off tan head. Small carbanation, could hardly see the bubble. The west coast hops hit the nose but blend nice with the whole beer. For Full Sail to have their entry-level amber at these heights, much praise. Cheers"
"Full Sail seems to put together some nice beers."
"Drinkability: A slightly hoppy average amber ale. I like the greenhouse aromas, but this is nothing I would go out of my way for. A decent non-offensive beer."
"Neither highly exciting or exceptional, but a solid every day amber. Worth a try."
"Reviewed on 1/18/2010. Bottle thanks to Sparky27. Pours a dark brown with a small off white head. Aroma of light caramel malts and sweet fruit. Flavor of caramel, toasted, and biscuity malts with a sweet fruity finish. Very tasty amber and quite drinkable."
"As ambers go, this one hits all the marks: a slightly pungent citrus aroma; prickly, fizzy body that cuts through anything spicy or sweet; decent malty base with sharp hops that provide a nice, dry finish. It's like so many other amber ales, though: it's very drinkable but there's nothing that makes it stand out. It's nothing terribly special, nor is it terribly terrible. You can do worse."
"DB- An easy going, balanced amber ale with appropriate flavors. Both malt and hops lend nice notes to this easy drinking ale."
"D - This beer is a good value for the quality of beer you get for the price of a 6 pack (as sold at the Navy Exchange Package Store). I continue to go back for more."
"D: Extremely drinkable here wouldn't or couldn't tell it was 5.5% until I scanned the bottle, also the balance that this beer shows is what makes it one of that best amber ale's I've ever came across."
"Smooth finish. Leaves a slight dry tea-like aftertaste that lingers very well."
"Overall, a decent, but not special, example of the style."
"A traditional amber with no notable flaws. Good caramel base--again, this is not sweet. The finish is hoppy bitterness, but it doesn't last that long. Again, this is a well-balanced beer. The body is on the richer side and the carbonation is on the lower side. Overall, I think this is one of the nicer Ambers."
"This may not be my favorite beer genre, but it is a good amber beer representative. Thanks Full Sail!"
"Final Notes: Would make a good beer to step up into the world of better beers, and honestly, makes a great cooking beer. Nothing special though."
"D - Very good amber ale that I would love to have in the future."
"Seems to be a bit sweet, but with a decent amount of hop taste, I find it to be nicely balanced. At 5.5% ABV I could see it being a decent session beer, a few bottles would be OK for me!"
"D- Amber isn't one of my favorite styles, but Full Sail keeps it interesting"
"drinkability ok i guess. it's a pretty easy to drink beer."
"At 5.99 a sixer (I factor price into all of my rankings), this is good value, I would drink this again at this price for sure."
"Drinkability: A nicely balanced beer that is both easy to drink and packed with flavour. The hops offer a little extra complexity but essentially this is a malty beer. Nice."
"D-Decent but there are other ambers I would drink before this one."
"The finish on this beer is stellar. The grainy hops and roasted maltiness synergize well together. Aftertaste is a roasted caramel flavor. A great beer for any season."
"D) An alright amber. Grows on you as you get to the bottom."
"d: Good amber, very drinkable. Wouldn't go out of my way to get this again but for a cheap six-er, it works."
"D - An easily sessionable beer and one that delivers on flavor despite its simplicity."
"A nice malty, but not overly sweet amber ale. Simple, but good stuff - I could see sessioning these."
"I only had one 12 oz bottle on hand, but I feel like I could drink a few of these. I enjoyed this beer. While nothing extraordinary, a reliable and quite solid brew. Good version of the style."
"Dark copper hue, no head and little to no visible signs of carbonation. Excellent malt aroma with a wee bit of hop scents cutting through. Mellow body, mellow malt bite. After a few sips I can really taste the malts cutting through. There's a little spice in there, just a little. I almost want to say there's some burnt malt flavors running around, too. There's some hop presence in there, but they aren't doing much of the talking. About half way through my 12oz pour I start to notice some sugary textures lingering in my mouth, but not over powering. Perfectly crisp, always refreshing. Take that Boont! This is a perfect beer for heavy meals, as I've made this my bbq beer of choice in the past."
"D: Easily drinkable. Well done in what can be a pretty average category."
"D: Low ABV, great taste... Great session beer..."
"D - Good drinkability. Well-rounded beer that prepares you for the next sip."
"The mouthfeel is the american lager with an added spiciness to it that keeps the palate refreshed and ready for the next sip. Definitely a sessionable brew with more flavoring than the standard macro-brew, I guess the overall grade is basically that it's O.K. and for about $7/6er it's not a bad deal."
"Overall - good, but not my favorite. However, I did enjoy drinking it. In short, it was subltly good."
"Think I got some bad luck here: Poured with almost no head; at first a few soap bubbles then a very thin read rose. Color is a hazy dark amber. Aroma is malty fruity hops. Flavor metalic malt hop bittersweet. Can tell that it would be a pretty good beer if whatever happened to it hadn't. Body is ok, but flat. Finish is at first sweet then bitter in not such a good way. Dang, was looking forward to this. From the Everything Shop on Canal near the Quarter."
"The hops give this amber a bit of an edge for me making it an easy amber to have a few of. It's refreshing but not watery and a subtle and quick hop bittering in the finish means I don't have to wait too long to have another sip."
"You can score these dirt cheap in Reno. 10.99 a 12 pack at Ben's, so that's big time in the drinkability factor."
"It's actually quite good I think. There are no harsh aftertastes or anything really that would turn me away from this beer except it may be just a bit too sweet for my taste."
"Poured in a Sam Adams perfect pint. A nice clear dark amber appearance with slight carbonation and no head retention. Aroma of toasty sweet malt with caramel. Some hop bitterness with sweet caramel malts that linger on the palate. Could drink no more than 2 or 3 in one sitting."
"Drinkability is good a decent enjoyable amber ale, wont replace my got to amber but tasty."
" D- This amazing aroma is wonderful but the taste just doesn't follow through with the same richness and depth. It still has a good flavor but fizzy finish takes a lot of the flavors away."
"D: As ambers go, this is a drinkable example."
"D: A solid version of this Northwest pub style. For around $6.50 a sixer, certainly a value, there's a lot of $9 ambers where you're not going to get any better."
"A pretty understated and yet intensely easy to drink beer. This is nice and cheap, and with an ABV of 5.5% it makes a sixer disappear with ease."
"Drinkability: Just not my favorite style and not my favorite example of it, either; too little on the hops for me"
"I will probably get this again some other time."
"D: A pleasant surprise as I've found Full Sail's beers to be a bit hit or miss. This is a definite hit, especially if you like ales with a sweet, English herbal hops spin."
"Drinkability: its got a good drinkability for a warm day. Not my favorite example of the style buts not bad."
"D - Me and a friend managed to pack away a 6er of these without too much trouble, so they're easy to drink and keep on without meaning to."
"Buy Again? Yes, but not as an amber ale."
"Drinkability: I wavered a bit on the drinkability score, but in this case I think the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. While Full Sail Amber doesn't blow me away, it would make a very solid session beer. It might have to start making appearances at band practice."
"Notes: Delicious beer. The first beer I have had in a while that has had great caramel flavor."
"Purs dark with a nice amber color thick cream head that lingers, strong malt & hops hit your nose right away... It can taste thin in the mouth but still has a overall crisp feeling to it, so the drinkability is good, as it does have character, I gave it a 2.5 for ""D" because I have not found a food that this beer goes good with, and thats a requirement for me."
"A great Amber Ale. Nothing over-the-top, but just a solid, well-balanced, and flavorful beer. A good benchmark for the style. Drinkable? Definitely, this one was gone in less than 10 minutes and I want another."
"The drinkability is very good, I would have no problem quaffin back 1 or 10 more. However it seems more reserved for a newbie than someone expecting more."
"Feel and Drinkability: Medium bodied with fine carbonation that refreshes the palate. Lingering aftertaste on this beer, very clean and almost a mineral like quality found in here. This beer is very easy to drink and one that I can see myself sessioning. Nothing special, just simple and straight forward."
"Amber body with an antique white head. Nose is biscuity, toasted malts and toffee, and big time ruby grapefruit. Caramel notes from the malt is prominent in the flavor category as well as biscuits basted in honey, some bitterness from the hops shows up towards the end in the form of ripe grapefruit and citrus peels. Nice pine presence as well even though it is farely well hidden in the background, it does show up to lend it's nuances to the beer. Mouthfeel almost earned a higher score, but just above average with a medium body, and a crisp dryness. Overall a good Amber Ale."
"d - In a blind test with friends, this beat out 3 other Amber ales."
"D - Drinkable. No single flavor dominates, but the balance is good. Not too hoppy or sour. Pleasant for it's sense of balance."
"Medium bodied, just the right amount of carbonation. This all makes for a solid, well balanced, drinkable amber ale."
"Full Sail Amber, like their pale ale, is a rock solid beer that you can't go wrong with. Very drinkable and recommended, and at least in these parts one of the better bargains in craft beer as well."
"I cannot pinpoint flavors that stand out that make the beer memorable, that's why I probably won't pick it up again."
"Overall Impressions: Less hop flavor than the aroma suggests. Enjoyable, but would be better with a slightly stronger flavor (it is there, but I wanted more)."
"On tap at the Full Sail Brewery in Hood River, OR. The colour was, well.... amber. Oh, and there was very little head. The aroma was rather uneventful. Suffices to say that I could detect some malt that was rather musty, but that was about it! On the palate, again, nothing exceptionally good, nor remotely good. Rather blah and largely unremarkable!"
"I found this beer to be pretty tasty. This is my first beer from full sail and I must say I am impressed. nice malty flavor with a bit of alcohol tinge left on my tongue after swallowing. Had no problem putting back a few of these in a matter of an hour."
"Taste is refreshingly smooth. This is my favorite beer!!!! Nice vanilla colored head, with hints of mustyness all around. A lot of lace. Dances off the palate, try this one boys, you won't be disappointed."
"D - Quite quaffable... A very sessionable beer... At 5.5% ABV, I could drink all night long... The flavor is rich and complex and would definately keep me from getting bored... I only wish this were availabe in PA, though it is making a wonderful Disney vacation even better... If I had regular access to this, it would like be in my stash year round..."
"More than just your typical Amber Ale, this packed some lovely West Coast hop character into an extremely easy drinking package. I could have easily drank two of these in the sitting, as I was rabidly losing liquid for this review. Very nice for the style."
"single from the State Liquor in Moab, UT"
"D: A decent drinker."
"Overall I'd drink this as a chiller after work or bring a sixer up to the slopes. Drinkable, more refined, but not a special occasion pour-in-a-chalice beer. Tasty. I recommend it."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, grain, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, slight grain, sweet malt, and a good hop background. Overall, a clean, refreshing, and easy drinking brew."
"D: It's rich and satisfying, yet far from overwhelming, and it's highly drinkable pint after pint."
"D-Quite drinkable and pleasant, although there are better, more complete amber ales available. Good, but not great."
"I don't drink this beer very much. It's a good beer, used to drink it back in the days. Since i drank it from a bottle not sure about appearance but is reminds me a bit of black butte porter which is another great beer and this is only an amber so i guess thats saying a lot , like this is a great amber, but of course not as rich as the porter.. i guess i'm just not a big fan though :)"
"Another beer I could enjoy at a bar on any night of the week, and a beer I would definitely share with friends. I feel this could be a good beer to drink when it is much colder outside."
"Full Sail's flagship brew continues to prove why it's one of the West's standy-by amber ales."
"This beer would appeal greatly to folks looking for that sort of thing."
"Built on simple balances, Full Sail's amber is not an extravagant beer by any means. But I certainly enjoyed mine."
"Mouthfeel is quite nice with a bitterness that roughs up your tongue just enough to let a caramel flavor land and nestle in. Fine carbonation adds to the overall goodness. It's a solid beer and a good example for the style. Nothing bold about it but one that has the character and flavors to make it a beer I can drink all night."
" Easily one of the best amber's I've had."
"Just wish it had a little more hops..."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - It's a great toss back brew I'd enjoy on any day or at a restaurant. I wouldn't come back to it time & time again but it's worth a try."
"Drinkability might be this beer's one drawback. It's a pretty heavy beer for the style. Probably not a session beer."
"D - Very drinkable, especially with some spicy, grilled sausages or any other bbq. Good all around. A very enjoyable amber ale."
"D - I'd buy another six pack of these if I were looking to drink an amber. It's not the best but certainly not the worst."
"MF/D - medium bodied, perfect size to satisfy but not fill you up. this beer has session written all over it. not the best amber that i've had but definately worthy and highly drinkable."
"Poured a amber red with a one-finger head and some lace on top of a balanced aroma of piney hops w/ citric notes and some sweet malts. Medium-bodied and smooth with a good malt presence so this isn't just a hoppy red. A mix of caramelized and roasted malts dominate the toungue with the hops coming closer to the end, presenting a citric/floral taste along with giving it a dry finish. A good take on this style as it seems sweeter than most reds I've had."
"Drinkability: Full Sail Amber is very drinkable. It's not too hoppy. I wouldn't necessarily consider it an amber ale, but it is a quality brew."
"Balance and understatement make this beer greater than the sum of its parts. It goes great with a wide variety of food, and it is one most consistently affordable craft beers here in Portland. Both those factors rank high on my drinkability score... this beer will make more regular appearances in my fridge from now."
"I really like this beer. There's nothing overtly fancy about it, but it's a solid, tasty, well-crafted beer. Totally sessionable at 5.50% as well. This would go well with plenty of dishes, but I'm thinking it makes a great companion for a greasy burger or a rich chicken sandwich. Light and fruity. A great spring or summer session beer."
"Very delicious. I could put away a few of these and keep coming back."
"This is a pretty decent amber ale, and one at an affordable rate. I can find this for $6 a six-pack at a handful of places. Definately a good budget beer."
"Overall: not bad"
"Very drinkable beer. Full Sail's Amber is always a solid/consistent performer. Nice beer from a solid brewery. Will not disappoint."
"All in all very enjoyable. Glad I had it. Wouldn't mind another."
"Pours deep red brown with thick off white bubbly head that leaves thin lines of lace. Basic malty aroma that is maybe a little earthy. Mild malty IF that quickly transitions into a nicely balanced malt and lightly bitter, long lived aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with good carbonation and a dry finish. Overall this is a very good session beer, not overpowering, with a clean flavor that stays good as it warms up a little."
"D--Seems pretty drinkable to me. No in your face bitterness and low carbonation makes it easy to have a few."
"Not one of my top dogs... and I usually don't drink Ambers anyway... but my gf picked up a sixer of this for me when I really asked for a bomber of their Slipknot IIPA. Shhhh!"
"All-in-all a middle of the pack good beer. Nothing to make it stand out from the crowd, good or bad."
"Brown, copper and amber tones with head dissipating to a ring that leaves webs of lace behind. Sweet malts, floral hops and a bit of alcohol on the nose. Taste is sweet malts finishing in minimal, but balanced, floral hops. Taste and balance are somewhat reminiscent of a brown ale. Light to medium bodied and slick down the throat leaving very little hoppy residue. It's easy on the palate and is well-balanced, more so than other ambers I've enjoyed. This beer begs to be enjoyed with any number of meals!"
"Very session able beer, high drink ability, simple but overall very good"
"Cloudy amber color with almost no head but very large bubbles, light alcohol flavor, and very flavorful carmels gave the beer that breadlike feeling usually found in dopplebocks. While it's not striking, the weighty feeling in the mouth certainly make this a beer worth remembering."
"Pours amber brown body with practically no head. Smell is malty fresh, no real indication of hops. The taste is interesting, a bit sweeter than I expected in a good way, almost a hint of cherry on the finish. Hops are hard to detect, but a hint of bitterness is present. Mouthfeel is watery refreshing, and releases a bit more carbonation than the body initially displays. Drinkability is good, this you could drink all night and be happy."
"EDIT- This was my entry into the world of craft beers. While the chocolate malt has been given a lighter hand, this is one of the Pacific Northwest best session beers, IMHO. While my taste has turned toward its more hoppy compatriots, this is a solid, sessionable brew. Cheers, John Harris!"
"This beer poured a dark amber color with decent white head that left decent lacing around my glass. The aroma was of of fruit and toasted malt. The flavor was the same, but there was just a bit of hop presence providing some balance. Mouthfeel was okay. This was a decent beer, nothing flashly, but definitely drinkable."
"Poured a dark amber color, almost no head. Hoppy, slightly bitter and sweet. Nice overall balance. A little on the bitter side. Plenty of hops. I picked up on some crystal malts perhaps and a biscuity flavor all the way through. A decet amber overall."
"I can't say this is a great beer, but it's a very cheap beer that's easy to find and I enjoy drinking it from time to time. Its got a simple amber body with caramel malt flavor and enough bittering to keep you aware of it, without being too hoppy. The body is full enough and I have no problem drinking lots of these with a meal, while watching a ball game, at a BBQ, etc. It doesn't really steel your attention away from other things when you really don't need a complicated beer. If simple is good, this is good enough."
"I typically like the full sail beers, I was a little dissapointed in this one, mainly because I love ambers, and I really like the full sail beers they offer. This one was a little to much for me I like a more floral hoppy taste in an amber. NOt bad overall."
"Pours an amber brown with a non-existent head. A sweet yet tart smell with a slight odor of hops. A very easy drinking taste with that bit of tartness as mentioned before. It's interesting that there's a bite from the carbonation yet there was no head on the beer. I like this beer. Very unassuming, good taste and drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is full and creamy and there is a light hop spike towards the finish which is the high point of the beer."
"Full Sail Amber has a dark amber appearance with an off-white medium head. Smell is not real apparent--some hops. Taste is mainly citrusy hops with some faint caramel malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, not too much carbonation. This is a very drinkable, sessionable amber."
"The malt came through as being a nice caramel and the aroma was pretty decent. Pretty nice flaovr to this beer, plenty of grains break through. Very light bodied and easy to drink. Good for a hot sunny day."
"Cheers"
"D - good example of an amber"
"D - This is a great beer. I tried this a few years back while visiting Seattle and have been searching for it ever since. Tracked some down during a recent visit to Seattle."
"D - I could definitely session this brew ambers are a favorite of mine and Full Sail come through pretty well with this one worth trying sometime"
"Drinkability: Who says American beers can be balanced and sessionable? 5.5% abv and smooth, very drinkable."
"D: yup! keep'em coming glad I tried this one. Easy drinker and great straightforward brew, nothing tiresome about it."
"Pours a body that is a nice dark brown-red in color. Has a good sized head that is off white in color. Aroma is hoppy but mild, not the strongest. Okay flavor that is sweet but balanced, and has a pale aftertaste in the palate."
"Drinkability is excellent. This is a great session beer. Lots of flavor, but not too heavy, and with a relatively low ABV. This is a beer I will buy again."
"Drinkability: A fairly decent amber. I wouldn't turn down a second chance at it."
"I was surprised by this beer...I am not really a big fan of Full Sail, but the amber was a solid effort and this is coming from someone who doesn't usually enjoy Ambers."
"D 4.5 If you are in an amber mood this is a must try, congrats to the staff of ""47"" @ Full Sail for a job WELL DONE!!!"
"Aroma is malty and inviting, with just a touch of sweetness and a hint of fresh bread. Color is clear, orangy-brown-amber; head is fairly thick and persistent, and a nice pale tan. Flavor is crisp and smooth, malty and satisfying, only a teensy bit bitter - not complex, but rather tasty. Texture is smooth and lively."
"Of the few ambers I have had this one comes out at the top (below my favorite amber, Bell's Amber) though I would not likely seek this one out even if it became available in my area. Still worth trying a freshing example of the style."
"Drinkability: flavors are moderate. Overall, this beer is easily drinkable. Nothing offensive and definitely worth drinking two or three at any one session."
"The taste is less pleasing, being mostly winey apples with a little toast and hint of earth with light citrus and spicey bitterness. There is a little complexity at first but this soon fades and it becomes basically a mix of darkly toasted bread and grapefruit, steadily becoming even more bland except for increasing bitter grapefruit and a little toast in the finish."
"Mouthfeel is very full and as well balanced as any american beer as I have had. Very drinkable."
"A bit dry, but otherwise well balanced."
"Drinkability: This amber was decent, it lacked the wow factor for me."
"D: It is drinkable as there is nothing objectionable about this beer but then again there is nothing that really makes it stand out either. Overall very average in all aspects."
"A surprisingly well-balanced beer. Appearance started with huge off-white, rocky, creamy, and frothy head that was fully lasting. The body was clear and sparkling with a reddish brown hue. The aroma was a balance of moderate malts, hops, and yeast (I smelled them all equally) that made me think of roasted nuts. The body was medium to full, very watery and somewhat oily; the carbonation was oddly soft with a sweet finish. Overall the flavor was sweet with light bitterness and acidic qualities. The finish was long."
"D - Simply an all around great beer, I could drink these all night. This gives Great Lakes Burning River APA a run for it's money as my favorite beer. A steel at under six bucks a six here in Oregon. Kind of makes me sad I have to go back to Ohio for college..."
"I have had the APA and IPA and liked them. This one was not as good...and I like Amber Ales."
"D - a most enjoyable brew."
"Na Zdravje"
"Overall- A bit sweet and possibly cloying but tasty and defintiely worthy of a 6er."
"Tasted on 5/2/08."
"Bottled March 13th 08. Pours a clear...amber color... who would've guessed? Barely any head. Laces but it doesn't last. Gave it an average for appearance but makes up for it in other respects. Very light piney hop smell. The crystal and chocolate malts give it a toffee, cocoa smell. The flavor has just the right balance. Not overly complex. Flavor lingers for a while... all I can really say is that it has a great balance of hops and malt that creates a good tingly mouthfeel that smooths out to silk. The hops are present but more prominent in the smell, plus the chocolate malt effects the smell more than the taste as well, but they provide a toffee smoothness. Very drinkable. The flavor isn't too strong in any direction, but I like that about this beer. I've had the IPA and the pale. I'd say the pale was much better than the IPA, wish I had another pale around to compare to the amber to determine which is best from this brewery. Suggested"
"Now I guess I'll have to hike back up Multnomah Falls on my way to the brewery again, to pay my dues."
"This is a fine brew, nothing fancy just a solid example of a beer staying true to form."
"I can see why this beer has been around for a while. It is a very solid beer w/ a great balance of malts and hops. Unfortunately there wasn't anything overly exciting about this beer. This is still a great amber to have around."
"Eric"
"Thank god for hops"
"Wow, it's like this is to the American Amber Ale, what SNPA is to the American Pale Ale. This pours an amber orange color with a short white head - decent retention and white lacing until the end. The aroma could be a touch richer, but it previews the malt and herbal hops mixture to come. The flavor starts with slightly sweet, bready caramel malts with note of toffee. The hops kick in midway with citrus and herbal flavors that slowly fade into the aftertaste. This is a full-flavored and very sessionable beer. Sort of sets the standard for the style."
"This is a great session beer. It's flavorful and light at the same time, providing a good balance of hops and malts without leaning too far in either direction or being too heavy."
"A nice clean copper beer with red highlights. Has a small off white head. This smells like a ringwood beer (you know a Shipyard export or a Magic hat #9)* but is not I emailed the brewery to check. there is a light caramel malt note in with a strong butterscotch character. The light caramel malt note starts the taste. Followed by a snappy, peppery hop character. A buttery note seems to linger on the middle of your tongue after the finish."
"overall, this is not my favorite style of beer, but it's certainly a drinkable brew. this would go well with some nice spicy crawfish on a sunday afternoon out in the sun."
"Pours a clear amber orange color. Has a smooth, light, off-white head. Malty aroma with a bit of light spices. Light, spicy aroma. Similar flavor with a bit of a citrus element. Smooth and light bodied with minimal carbonation. Though not a very exciting offering, still very drinkable and a nice beer."
"Drinkability - Decent offering from full sail, but not enough to make it a staple for regular drinking."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes at a moderate pace into a small cap of foam. The aroma is of caramel and grapefruit. The taste is very balanced with a nice long, lively finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a fine amber that I would drink again."
"This seems out of wack. The vegetable aroma and taste really makes this an unenjoyable beer for me."
"D: The low abv and pleasing taste can't be beat. This is a nice session ale."
"A clearish maroon to brown pour with no lasting head. Looked darker than a standard amber, and the smell was mostly a light metal to it at first followed by light malt. Not too impressive on the pour or smell, but the taste was better, however. Good rich sweet maltiness, with very light hop flavor and bitterness to it. Overal, not bad, but not my favorite amber either. Worth a try if you like ambers."
"Pours clear light amber color with 1 finger head which quickly dissipated to thin ring with minimal lacing. Hoppy, fresh and slightly fruity aroma which turns to malt the deeper into the glass you get. Taste is hoppy, kind of peach like with medium body and moderately dry finish. Pretty easy to drink but just a bit on the fruity side for my taste."
"Drinkability: could do two in a night, but i'd rather drink something that tastes better"
"The taste is nice and malty. Lots of chewy caramel malt hits my tastebuds first followed by some bready notes and a citric fruit kick that hits the back of my throat nicely. It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is fairly light. After a few more sips the hops become a little more assertive but it's still a nicely balanced Amber. It finishes slightly sweet and leaves a fairly long lasting aftertaste. Good stuff!"
"The taste is sweet malt, buttered bread with some fruit added in the mix. It has a medium body with low carbonation. An interesting amber but just too sweet for me. More carbonation wouldn't hurt either."
"Drinkability is on the lower side, this is one of my least favorite Full Sails, grainy and grassy, and just not something I enjoy or what I look for in an amber."
"Finish and Mouth feel is nice. Would make a good alternative to a big three brew."
"Thanks to bwatson for this beer. Pours a nice light caramel (trying to be creative not using the word...amber) that leaves only 1/2 inch of head. After a few minutes, there's only a white ring that sticks to the side of the glass. You can definitely pick up on the toasted malts with some fruit smells and a hint of malts. The taste is extremely well balanced: smooth (if that's even a taste) malts, then wait, hops at the end. The hops aren't kick in your teeth, they are very balanced in the use. Mouthfeel is medium and lacks some carbonation. With the balance and the low alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer that I will search for in the future. Great job!"
"This is effin' good especially compared to usually predictable amber ales. Appears a deep amber red tone with a nice formed thicket of fine even lacing. A roasted caramel note with nuts, toffe, and herbal hops flowing, what a warming flow going on here. Flavor runs wild with smooth layers of caramel malt and wheaties like grains, really brings out depths of malt flavor with ample bittering hops making it really balanced. Great refreshing flow with bread crust caramelized sugars and an all out satisfying flavor. Mouthfeel is medium bodied smooth evenly carbonated definitely could drain a few of these bad boys. Drinkability one that I will revisit next time possibly a whole sixer good stuff."
"Medium bodied with low/moderate carbonation. Slightly dry in the finish but clean. Lots of bready, doughy, yeast in the texture. Tasty and well constructed. Very good; could be mistaken for a sweeter Brown Ale."
"Pours a clear amber-orange color with a medium off-white head with decent staying power. Thin rings of lacing. The aroma is evenly hoppy and malty. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with subtle malt undertones. Some tart fruit and caramel flavors as well. The finish is somewhat hoppy with touches of caramel malt and fruit in the aftertaste. Above average overall."
"I must say, I almost always skip over the Full Sail 12oz when going for fridge beers, but enjoying this one tonight will definately make me think twice... very drinkable and it has much more going on than I remember and from previous notes. also, the color is much better than expected.. nice brews and glad I decided to do an amber ale flight that included Full Sail."
"Mouthfeel was nice and meaty. I found it to be one of best Amber's to date that I have tried in recent memory. I remember thinking this was an average beer but after visiting the brewery I realized their beers are some of best around."
"Pours a beautiful amber color with a nice full head. Leaves lacing all the way down the glass. A true American Amber. Smells of some noble hops and off cherry flavors. Awesome looking beer. The body, however is very light. Needs more syrup in it, to make it a great beer, not just a good one. Can probably session out on these, nice abv, but again, just needs a little more draw to it on the body."
"D- Nice clean beer good flavors, not one to pound down but to enjoy with a meal of the have one or two with friends"
"Drinkabilty is great, a good session beer or everyday beer."
"Thanks to Wasatch for including in our trade!"
"D: Very high drinkability. One of my favorite amber ales. I'm glad I live in Hood River county!"
"12 ounce bottle is marked with 122707 on it, I assume it means it's best by 12/27/07. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/brown color with a half inch off-white head. I thought it would be amber colored, but I guess not! Head retention and lacing are both OK. It smells like sweet malt and caramel, with a little bit of citrusy hops and chocolate too. The taste is mainly caramel malt and some hops which leaves a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, thin and a bit on the watery side. With that being said, the drinkability isn't bad at all. It is smooth and goes down easy. Overall it's OK, but it's not something I'd make a point to seek out."
"Pours a dark amber, with a thin, white head. Smells earthy. Taste is malty, with a bit of citrus taste. You can also taste the dry hopping here. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, the body is a little bit watery, but not too bad. A good ale, quite sessionable."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a nice foamy head with average retention and no lacing. Aroma of caramel malt is about medium with some dry hops also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by some caramel malt as well as some dry hops. Body is above average with some good carbonation. Not bad but nothing extraordinary either."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass and noticed a nice brown/red (amber) colr with a nice creamy head. The aroma was a little hopps a little malty got something else I couldn't put my finger on. The taste a little bitter but nothing to be alarmed about. This could easily be something that goes down smooth for many. This is not a high abv brew so one could enjoy many of these or not."
"Very nice amber red color, clear, very good head, smells biscuity, tastes malty but not grainy. The drinkability of this beer is excellent. This beer was also an excellent value at 6.50 a sixer but I have found Full Sail really puts out quality beer at a very affordable price."
"If Full Sail Amber is a good example of the Full Sail line, I am very happy to welcome them to Cleveland!!"
"The hop bill here is just right for the beer. I'm not a big amber fan, so the score isn't great - but for this style -- a pretty good beer. Artisan work."
"Overall: I imagine that this is what all those macro bottlers are thinking about when they say things like crisp clean and refreshing. A competent amber, worth a try."
"D-Good solid amber....finishes with some mild dry notes....I've had better and I've had worse....I'd buy it again..."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good kick, this is a good beer to drink continuously. I could see myself sticking with this beer for the duration of an evening."
"Classic American Amber toasty caramel warmth. This one is particularly clean. One of the better/more-drinkable Ambers Ive had."
"By the way the label has changed from the one shown on the review bottle picture. A light brown background (faux wood?) with a green inset. Top of label says ""independent"" below that ""employee owned"" then ""Full Sail"" and in mid-label it says ""AMBER"""
"Pours a color somewhere between rich amber and burnt umber, with a small, off-white head that fades pretty quickly. Aroma of sweet caramel and dark malts, light caramel, and a hint of astringency. Mildly sweet palate up front, blending with some mild bittering hops towards the finish. Aftertaste is lightly bitter and a touch dry. The medium body is as expected for the style, with just a little residual creaminess. A thoroughly drinkable amber ale that, while not particularly exciting, has been a mainstay of the Oregon craft brew scene for nearly 20 years now."
"Pours out a dark amber with scant bubbles. Thin, creamy head with some wisps of lacing. Smells toasty, with fruity esters and some faint citrus hops. Taste is about the same with a good deal of sweetness. Slight medicinal taste. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth with a slight bubbly bite. Weight is moderate. This gets more medicinal as it warms; making it not so drinkable."
"Overall, this Amber Ale is tasty and won't disappoint. I had with a snapper fish burrito and it was very enjoyable. Enjoy"
"Overall, i think this is a very good beer to fall back on (if available-not really here). It has a solid flavor i dont get bored with, and a drinkability that would make it a beer i could buy a six pack for the night, but won't blow your socks off."
"This is a very easy-to-drink beer that doesn't sacrifice on flavor at all. A very nice choice, even for this hophead."
"Full Sail Amber pours a dark reddish brown with a thin ring of white foam along the edges from a brown twelve ounce bottle. A bit of chocolate malt in the aroma. Nutty and chocolatey malt with a nice splash of hops thrown in to balance things out. Sessionable."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber color with a thin and fizzy off-white head. The aroma is toasted malt, caramel and citrusy hops. There is a lot of malt on the palate with a balanced hop profile in the finish. I would like to have seen a little more hops in the taste and the mouthfeel to be a little fuller, but other than that, it is a solid brew. Overall, this is a pretty decent Amber that is certainly worth another try."
"Poured bottle into a standard pint glass. Drank 2 of these back to back, the first had no head whatsoever... on the second beer I used a much more aggressive pour. Still, little to no head and very little lacing. Smell is very faint, some sweet caramel and corn. Taste has quite a bit of sweetness, very little hop bitterness. Some malt & caramel. Goes down fairly smooth and leaves little aftertaste, but just enough sweetness remains. I would say this is an average beer, I was expecting much more from it, however I will have to try the Full Sail Pale next time. The Amber get's a B- or C+, somewhere in that range."
"Overall a decent session beer but thats a pretty competitive area and this beer does not really stand out."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep amber, forming a 1/2 inch head, leaving light lacing on the glass. The aroma is very thin. Maybe consisting of light malt sweetness, with a hint of hops. Not too much present. The taste is about the same. Nothing really complex. Sweet malt up front, followed by a light hop finish. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, this just seems like an average beer. Nothing really interesting."
"Drinks pretty easy, another winner from a pretty good oregon brewery. Nothing earthshattering, here, just solid across the board"
"Overall: This is almost more like an American Brown than an American Amber, certainly on the border between the two styles. The beer pull one's taste buds in different directions. While this makes the beer interesting, it detracts from the cohesiveness, and makes it less drinkable than expected."
"Poured a nice, deep amber color. The head was a dark tan, but quickly disappeared. I immediately smelled the caramel malts - typical of an amber. Not too hoppy, and good balance over all. Not a bad pick - and a decent bet at $6.99/6-pack. Recommended."
"12 ounce bottle, pours typical semi cloudy amber, medium almond, with an equally typical tan head, thas leaves nice, fine and scattered lacing. The nose here is all about the malt. This is well put together malty brew, smooth notes of vanilla, honey, and bready sweetness. Easy drinking, balanced and thoroughly sessionable. Middle of the road style, but this one was enjoyable, a crowd pleaser."
"Full Sail's Amber has a filtered amber appearance and a short-lived white head that reduces to a ring of foam, leaving no lacing behind. The nose is fruity and citric, characters that are also present in the taste. Malt-heavy with a decent hop backbone. I can't really pick out any subtlety in the flavor - it's a fairly inoffensive albeit unexciting beer. Drinkable but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of medium brown , with stark white head - nose of bitter hopps , floral , tasted , malts and bubble gum  taste of hopps , malts , tar , citrus , and slight skunk - body crisp , and bright  aftertaste of hopps , earthy and citrus"
"Proves you can have flavor without heaviness, and interest without bitterness. Good sessioner."
"D- i've never had an amber like this, modest easy drinker without being boring. may feel a bit awkward at times, but enjoyable. make a session out of this one, truly unique."
"Smooth and easy to drink, flavorful but a little too light on the malt to be one of my favorite amber ales."
"Not a bad beer at all. Good for sessioning. Try this one and see if you like it."
"This is a solid Amber that's perfect on this cool, early-fall evening. Would be a hit on a fall camping trip."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Copper color with a decent one-finger head and moderate lacing. Aroma was a mild citrusy hop smell. Flavor was moderately bitter finishing with a good malty finish. Nothing spectacular but very easy to put back while sitting by the barbecue."
"Drinkability is where this beer really shines. Mild and dry without anything harsh about it yet it isn't really dumbed down either. If this lacks anything it might be in complexity but this certainly nails all the necessary attributes of a good beer. VERY good beer for the $5.99 I paid for the six pack."
"I've had several brown ales that are the same dark copper color as this one. The nose has fruity and toasty malts and equal levels with hops. The hop bitterness just barely overtakes the sweet, toasty caramel malts in the taste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Overall this is a solid, slightly atypical, example of an amber ale. For what it's worth, I think the old label had more character."
"D - Good drinkability combined with great flavor make this a prime sessioning candidate."
"Highly drinkable stuff, it's one of the best of this style that I have tasted !"
"Drinkability: a great session amber. This can be enjoyed all alone or with a meal. Worth having."
"Overall: This would be a solid yet not noteworthy beer, if it weren't for the intensity of the malt flavor. IMO, amber ales should be showcasing the complexities of the lightly kilned malt varieties, and this one definitely comes through in that regard. It would have been nice to have a bit more hop character (not bitterness, but flavor). An above average amber."
"I enjoyed the witty comments on the full sail packaging as much as I did the beer. A: Amber copper color that looked promising flavorwise. S: Mildly citrus infused with hints of slightly spicy and floral undertones. T: Milder than expected, a slight carmelized maltiness that was trumped by the hoppy finish M: Med to thin but appropriate. D: Quite good, as it was a milder, smoother beer than I had anticipated. I hope to visit Oregon on a beer pilgrimage in the reasonably near future, and I will compare and contrast the draft version whilst there."
"Beautiful dark copper color, but very little lasting head. Not much of a characteristic aroma, just a straight-forward, almost 'bitter' smell. Very balanced taste, nice compromise between a clean, hoppy sensation that aids in the great drinkability and a solid malt backbone - caramel notes, reminds me more of a decent bitter than the hoppy amber/red I was expecting. Hops present on the finish, just begging you to take the next sip. Could definitely have a few of these. Not a flavor bomb, but sometimes this is just what I want."
"Notes: An easy drinking, soft brew that does what it is designed to do. Light enough to make a day of it, enough goodness to keep you interested, and the price is right just like most of the full sail lineup."
"This beer looks like a typical amber. Mine poured with a moderate tawny head that didn't last. There is a moderate maltiness to the taste that I found enjoyable. The smell and hoppiness are restrained. This is worth trying, but nothing to rave about."
"Dark amber in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas of wildflower honey, caramel, and a bit of floral hops. Flavors are of light caramel, and a bit of cinnamon-like spice. A bit of an earthy hop undertone as well. Medium bodied, and slightly bitte. Better than average, but not exceptional."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad brew, but not sure if I will buy again, since there are so many other better one's in my book."
"Pleasant and surprising, but I like a little more bite in my Ambers."
"Full Sail Brewing Company ('specialists in the liquid refreshment arts since 1987') comes through again. While this isn't the most spectacular Amber Ale that I've ever had, it's more than solid and is well deserving of the many gold medals that have been earned in world beer championships over the years."
"Drinkability: This is a great relaxation beer, profound in its simplicity!"
"meh"
"Pours a dark copper with a thin white head that didn't bother sticking around. Aroma consists of toasted grain with a nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with prickly carbonation. Things start off with a nice caramel and toasted malt flavor. There's a touch of fruitiness to it also. Noticeable hop bitterness arrives midway and lingers into the finish. Overall, this a pleasant and easy drinking amber."
"This is a drinkable beer. Its typical, perhaps slightly above average, for an American Amber. If you are looking for a well balanced beer, a little hoppy and a little malty, youll like this one. I would definitely buy Full Sail Amber Ale again."
"This is a decently tasty (perhaps not ""ridiculously tasty"" as the label proclaims) entry by Full Sail, worth a try if you see it available somewhere, but I can think of too many other great beers out there to make FSAmber a mainstay in my fridge."
"The color is a solid amber with good carbonation. The creamy head is average-sized and off-white. Aroma is of sweet, toasted malt with an underlying smell of piney hop. The taste is definently a step or two up from the standard microbrew amber. Plenty of malt flavor here, toasted bready flavors are joined by caramel. A moderate level of piney hop hits midway through a sip and really helps set this beer apart from the competion. A little spiciness rounds the flavor out. This is one of the top ambers I've sampled, this is something that will find it's way back into my fridge sooner rather than later."
"A medium-dark amber pacific NW ale. It is very clear sith an off-white one finger head that lasts quite a long time and leaves some lace. The nose is fruit and toffee. The taste of the hop blend is nice. it is not just citrus, there is also some woody and subdued bitterness. A moderate to heavy mouthfeel for an amber. There does seem to be a slight astringency to the finish that become somewhat more noticalbe as it warmed. Overall a very drinkable amber and one of the better PNW examples."
"Drinkability - Because there is not too much taste this is very drinkable. This could easily be a session beer."
"A nice American Amber Ale. Attractive, tasty, and very drinkable. I could see myself enjoying several in a sitting. Only lacks somewhat in the olfactory area."
"Bottle provided to me as a reward for cleaning up the day after GABF. The stamp on the bottle reads 093005 12:26. Pours a one finger slightly yellowish head over a crystal clear dark amber colored liquid. The head slowly settled until it reached a thin layer that nver went away. Nice lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells caramel, oranges, woody hops, some citrus pith, a tinge of alcohol, toasted grains, and pine sol. Some of these aromas were only found with deep searching. Wet sweet smelling and a little bit of chocolate. Tastes, yeah, chocolatey with a nice toffee/caramel beneath to sweeten things up. Nice tasting amber, but the carbonation is a bit more than I care for personally. A little bit of soured grains and what I think is hops comes in the aftertaste rough like I'm holding a grassy drab cottonball in my mouth. Esters are present, but I can't nail down any particular fruit. Maybe squash. Overall, sweet in the mouth, but dry grainy in the aftertaste. Could this sour and dour end be partly from tannins? Md-thick mouthfeel and tiny sharp carb is just a touch too strong. Gorgeous looking beer with a nice aroma profile. Thumbs up."
"Complex and simple at the same time, this beer does great things without having to aspire to it. Easy."
"Pours a nice looking medium copper-amber with minimal head. Aroma is slightly sweet malt bread. Flavor is malty, but witha much stronger hop profle than expected. However, it's a little cold, adn as it warms, the malt does become more dominant. Hops are floral but also oily. Balance isn't what I would hope for. Mouthfeel is ok, but the hop profile does not make this one as drinkable as I like. I guess, bottom line, this one just doesn't grab me."
"When poured, it was of a copperish red color with little foam and not lace. The smell of hops, roasted malts and a hint of citrus filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste was no surprise. The taste and aroma almost matched, except for just a hint of caramel mixted with the hops and citrus for a very good flavor. Mark another good beer for Full Sail!"
"Appearance is a deep copper, foam is beige with some lace. Aroma consists of roasted grain, malt, and grapefruit hops. Initial taste is a nice clean lightly carbonated mouthful of delicious malty beer with citrus hops. The middle is yeast bread, unsweetened chocolate and malt. Finish is neat, dry and slightly sweet. Delicious!"
"Nice solid offering. Pours a nice amber color with yellow/gold highlights. The smell has a nice floral scent, the subtle hints of molasses malts is refreshing. The taste is a light balance of citrus lemon/ and peanuts covered with honey. The alcohol is distant while the mouthfeel is dry. A nice solid beer, goes great as a marinade to london broil or other steak cuts."
"It's a split decision, great aroma and initial taste, bad aftertaste."
"Nice looking clear dark brown body, some visible carbonation. Head has excellent retention, settling at 1/3 and remaining. Smell is very hoppy, just like I like it, also slightly sweet. Those flavors are both reflected in the taste, as this is a nice and hoppy brew, floral and satisfying, with some sweet caramel malts to boot. An excellent amber ale offering, hopped as much as you could expect for the style. Recommended."
"Way to go Full Sail!"
"Overall, great Amber here. Nothing too sweet, but nothing IPA-like hoppy either. This one is just right for a cold winter's night."
"The mouthfeel is in no way syrupy with a balance of carbonation. This is a session beer that has good quality and very drinkable for the 5.5 abv. The carbonation is balanced throughout with a sweet malty aftertaste."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color wtih 2 fingers of head that falls very slowly to a finger over the beer. The nose is a really nice caramel malt base with a great floral and citrus hop dancing in and out. This beer smells great. The flavor is heavy caramel, almost a light coffee flavor. There is just enough hop to give it a beautiful finish. As it warms, there are some fruity tones that come out as well. The feel is moderate to thick, easy drinking and smooth. This beer is damn good. I really wish I could get it here in the middle lands."
"Lightly sweet, fruity malt flavors start off. Has a kind of herbal-cherry quality that's quite good (due to the yeast?). Caramel notes mix in with the cherry, right before a modest surge of floral, herbal hops comes in. Also an enjoyable yeasty flavor throughout (like in Bell's amber). I was expecting more of a hoppy PacNW-style amber, but this leans more toward the fruity (cherry) malts. Interesting and good. Finish is faintly bitter with lingering fruity malt. Medium-bodied, yet mouth-coating and creamy feel. Yum. Very drinkable."
" A solid, no nonsense Oregon craft brew."
"P.S. I think my problem is that i'm used to Mac & Jacks and Fat Tire, both are hoppier and dryer, as I like it."
"Tap@ The Edinborough Castle, San Fransisco. fairly simple, but very drinkable. Nutty soft malts, with aromtic US hops in the finish, this is one of the better ambers youll find. Not bad. (Tap@The Pilsner Room (Full Sail), Portland. Same opinion as a bove."
"Dark brown with a big head this beer is under a lot of peoples radar as a great session beer. Lots of malt and a decent hit of hops this is easy to drink and yet makes one consider what one is drinking. An amber ale should really be that perfect drinking beer that complements food and friends. I will search out more of this beer."
"Dark, slightly hazy copper body is topped by a small and short-live head. Sweet and fruity Im getting bits of tea and melon and a little caramel. The flavor is sweet, but light. Lightly malty, but very little in the way of hops. There is a slightly floral character to the aroma, but its not striking me so much as hops as with some beers."
"Pours amber with a wood-like color mahogany? (I guess). Forms into a small 1 finger head and diminishes to 1-2mm within 60 seconds. Exceptionally nice --well organized lace is left on glass-especially for a bottled beer. Taste is the way an amber should be nicely balanced -- floral/hoppy - with slight malt. Maybe a touch of licorice or chocolate too. Finishes dry and clean, and a little fruity. Mouthfeel is very smooth, also surprisingly so for a bottled beer. Drinkabilty is dangerous --easy to get used to and this is not my favorite style. This is probably one of the better ambers I have tried."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a slightly dry, yet sweet malt scent with a bit of hops in the background to round out the aroma. The taste is decent. It has a watery crystal/pale malt flavor with some hops and a bitter, grainy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This would be a much better beer if it had a bit more body and carbonation. It drinks decent despite it's flaws."
"Light, refreshing offering from Full Sail. They continue to impress."
"This goes down pretty easy. It would be a pretty decent session beer"
"The first sip started out malty and thick that slowly turned to a nice bitter hoppiness. In the very end it left a smokey taste lingering in my mouth. A nice bodied beer that is a pleasure to drink."
"Readily drinkable, this is a great crowd pleaser."
"Thick off white head sits atop a deep amber body. Malt fills the nasal cavities. Mellow carmal malt flavors up front. The hop flavor takes a back seat to the dominating malt character. This is overall a great lightbodied, easy drinking, session brew."
"I hadn't had Full Sail Amber in so long, I'd taken it for granted and forgot how good it is. I still personally prefer the hoppier brews, but this is just right for food, parties, or just drinkin'."
"Color is a coppery rust, thin off-white top quickly disappears, lacing in bits of glaring spots. Aroma is soft and biscuity with a subdued dulled fruity sense, some lighter caramel and roasted malt within and a bit of grassy spiced hop underneath. Taste is a bit roasty but mostly dulled and sweet with a bit of a biscuit malt tone, milder hops with fresh cut grassy notes. Dull, chewy, nutty finish. A bit heavy on the malt end but sufficient hop spice and bittering help keep a yielding taste. The feel however does come across mostly malty, with a smooth medium body and a bit of chewy finish, getting close to cloying in some areas, but this does favor a good drinkability. Full Sail has themselves a pretty good amber here."
"-- *apologies to Neil Young"
"A deep copper with reddish hues, the smallish but creamy head is off-white to tan. The aroma is mildly hoppy. The taste is interesting -- subtle with a slight spiciness and a mild bitter finish and aftertaste -- though there was a touch of unpleasantness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. Overall an enjoyable and fairly drinkable amber."
"A bit timid for me, but probably a great beer for a macro drinker looking to take a walk on the micro side."
"The beer pours a crystal clear deep mahogany color with a mediocre light tan head that is semi-creamy in texture with the lace forming a tight sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt, hints of caramel, citrus crisp and clean quite appealing to this old schnozzle with the start sweet and laced with malt, top is light in its feel. Finish is moderate in its carbonation, hops a delectable, aftertaste dry and lingering, another fine session beer from a Great brewery."
"Drinkability  A very good Amber/Red. Nothing outstanding, but very nice."
"A heavy pour gives a smallish, tan head. Color is a dark, clear, amber/brown. The smell is fruity, malty, with a little chocolate. The sweet, fruity front gives way to a smooth, malty middle. Finish is nutty, hoppy bitter with a touch of alcohol. There's a slight hint of some medicinal quality, but otherwise, this is just delicious."
" If you can find this ale on cask give it a try. I think you'll be surprised at the extra flavor this handpumped Amber can supply!"
"I cant give this beer a good review. I can compare it to beers I enjoy drinking, where it does not stand a chance, or compare it to widely available plain crap, in which case, it is on the upper echelon of not much. The nose is composed entirely of sweet malt, much like the flavor, which consists also of different faint hints thats are undistinguishable. It does at least produce a malty character, but the malt is not intriguing and it certainly leaves you will unfulfilled desire. Not a high recommendation from me certainly. On the other hand, as this is probably thir most available brew, the fact that they could adequately compose at least one flavor bodes fairly well for the brewery."
"Pours a warm reddish amber with perfect clarity. Its light tan head starts out well enough, then fades to a small ring around the edge. Fair amount of lacing. Nice aroma with the balanced slightly tilted towards the sweet, fruity malt. A bit of green hops (dry-hopped?) as well as a hint of earthiness and minerals. Some caramel/crystal malt presence. The flavor is well balanced between the sweet, caramelly malt, the spicy and green hops, and earthy yeast. Theres a significant amount of mineral taste and hardness from an over-eager water treatment. Interestingly enough, the fruity esters and earthy yeast combine to take on an almost spice-like character. The body is on the lighter side of medium, with the aforementioned mineral dryness and chalkiness. Lots of carbonation. This is surprisingly good, and a very solid example of an undefined style."
"Much less interesting in the mouth. Medium-bodied with the crystal leading the way (bias disclosure - I can't stand the flavor of crystal malt). Some supporting maltiness, but not as much as the nose promised. Some leafy hop notes come out with time. The water treatment is a bit extreme and really makes itself known on the palate - sulphur city. The carbonation is a bit harsh as well. Thanks to MJR for the bottle!"
"Appearance is reddish brown. Poured a small head that dissapated to a small head quickly but left a nice lacing down the glass. Toasted malt and fruity hop aroma. Nice smooth initial taste with a big hop finish. Smooth to bitter mouthfeel. A nice rugged amber ale, another fine drinkable beer by the Full Sail folks!"
"First off I don't really like the new bottles, the old ones had much more character. Anyway, this beer pours with a deep garnet color, and is quite clear when held up to the light. It has a light tan head that is reasonably persistent. The first aroma is one of hops; citrusy, and floral components. Then as you stick your nose in a bit deeper one gets a malty aroma and I seem to even detect a hint of roastiness, and some toasted maltiness as well. This is a quite malty brew with some definite hop notes to it as well. It has a sort of austere wine like finish to it, which is quite interesting. There is a good amount of body here, as the beer coats my taste buds and the back of my throat nicely. At the very end one gets a nice laying on of bitterness from the hops. It is not as hoppy (both aroma and flavor) as I remember it, but I suspect my tastebuds have changed quite a bit over the years."
"This has been one of my favorite beers since my first taste four years ago. Pours a nice dark amber--red/brown when held to light--with a minimal head which diminishes fairly quickly to a thin veneer of bubbles. A very attractive looking beer. The aroma is sweet and wonderfully malty. This is mirrored in the taste which is also sweet and strongly malty. A hint of hops is also present. Smooth and full to medium bodied I find this to be a highly drinkable beer."
"Full Sail is a worthy brewery (try their Pale Ale) but this one sort of falls flat. A relatively drinkable, malty brew but just not too exciting."
"Med brown color. Medium/large head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. Slightly roasted malts, nutty and slightly sweet. A lightly citrusy hopped amber. Full flavored, yet mild taste. Malt flavors are subtle and mild. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty, very light bitterness."
"Overall Impression: A pretty good beer. No major criticisms, but nothing really outstanding either."
"Notes: Won't blow you away but makes for a good-to-excellent session amber."
"Drinkability: I had this beer about four years ago. It's a nice beer to come back to. Very easy to drink as I polished off the first one too fast (can you do that?) and got a 2nd to finish the review. Well balanced and not over-the-top one way or the other. IMO this would be a great ""converter"" beer to use to introduce macro-drinkers to the micro beer world."
"Deep amber color with a tan head and aroma of spicy hops and chocolate. Flavor is a very nice balance of malty sweetness and hop citrus. There is a lazy carbonation that tingles the tastebuds without diminishing the clear deep color of this brew. Overall this beer is one worth drinking again."
"There is about an inch of a light brown head on top of this cola colored amber body, which leaves a fair amount of lacing around. The smell of this brew is a bit flowery. Its got a fairly sweet malt taste topped off with a spicy hop backround. This is a pretty nice amber ale, worth your while if you run into it."
"Overall: I just cannot believe that I walked pass this beer in Trader Joes so many times without ever picking it up! A well priced solid Amber Pale Ale that goes down well. Worth the price of a Six-Pack."
"Poured with a rather frothy head. Didn't notice if it faded as it was gone fast. Hops and a sweet, grainy maltiness in the nose. Hops are definitely the backbone of the beer leaving a dry, bitter finish, but not in a harsh way. Grain and malt sweetness come through in the middle of the tongue with barely a trace of caramel. A little light in body for my liking. Could easily see making a session beer out of it."
"I expected more from Full Sail Amber, not that it's a bad beer, but not something I would search out."
"Taste is crisp and clean with malt and a hop finish. Medium body with light carbonation."
"Very drinkable amber have to thank the wife for this..well done Carmen!"
"Another excellent choice. If i could homebrew a beer this good, I'd consider going pro. This would be a good beer to have around. It pours to a thin white head that clings to the glass. It has a somewhat dry fresh malt smell. The flavors are less intense than the aroma suggests. It starts out dryish and malty and resolves to a balance of maltiness balanced by hop flavor and bitterness. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Yes, aftertaste can be a good thing to a Beer Advocate. Very drinkable stuff. The flavor could stand to have a little more ""impact"" to it though."
"A groovy looking ruby red amber with a rice white thin head. The aroma was not strong on this brew, but I could detect some spices and sweet maltiness floating off the top. The floral bouquet of the hops comes well with the sweet malts. The hops do seize your tongue initially but the flavor was not intense enough for me."
"Deep amber in color with a thin head. Sweet, full malty aroma with hints of floral hops. Flavor is very smooth, caramel malt develops toasty toffee notes mid-palate. Tingly citric hop finish is quite nice. Very drinkable; I'd love to try it on draught. Fullish side of medium bodied, with a dry finish which practically begs you to take another sip quick."
"I bought one of those mixed cases from Full Sail at Costco and this one was by far the best of the batch. I really liked the flavor. Wierd though, it tasted best ice cold, and not as good when above 42 degrees. Just my opinion. This beer's smell seemed different than the taste. Nice spice and malt flavor. They did a good job with this one."
"This ends up beeing a pretty drinkable beer."
"Very drinkable but some non microbrew drinkers may find it a bit on the bitter side. A great session beer, drinking 6 or 8 of these in a sitting is a must."
"Pours a vibrant amber with decent, creamy head that laced fairly well on the glass. Sweet, caramel-like aroma with a well-balanced flavor of hops, malty sweetness. Finishes slightly dry with a touch of hops. Not a bad session beer, but not my favorite amber."
"Standard pacific northwest offering from a employee owned brewery. I had this in a restaurant and it came essentially headless, lace was very sparse. Deep color is attractive and mouthfeel was slightly creamy. Nice hoppy taste in the west coast tradition and drinkability was good. Could see knocking back a few of these under the right circumstances."
"Pours a dark brownish copper color with a thin tan colored head. Nose is sweet malts and a touch of fruit. Sweet spices come through upfront in the taste followed by a caramel like taste of roasted malts and grains. Finish is dry with a mild hop bitterness. A nice amber, but nothing special."
"Pours a dark amber/brown with a full 2 1/2 finger head that hangs in there quite nicely.  The smell is a malty spicy aroma with a little hint of hops.  The taste is quite nice and crisp and consists of fruit, caramel, malt, and a nice balance of hops.  It has a light to medium body and finishes with a semi-dry hop.  Good brew!  Cheers!"
"This beer has a deep clear burgandy tone.  A small soft beige head tops the brew and sticks around for a while.  A nice malt aroma is blended nicely with floral hop notes.  If you take the nice deep malt taste from a good barleywine (like Hog Heaven) and cut the intensity of it in half, you've got the malt taste for this brew.  Pretty nice for an amber ale.  Good caramel tones.  It's balanced nicely with a good dose of floral, spicy hops.  The body of this beer is about medium and it is a very easy to drink, tasty beverage."
"Drinkability/notes: A very nice example of the style."
"I had this on tap and it's always harder to remember then write.  Not much of a head.  Amber color.  Both malt and hops quite noticable with the bitterness of the hops the greater flavor and the lingering taste.  Mouthfeel maybe a litte thin.  I certainly don't regret trying it, but may order something else next time."
"A dark amber with a lot of carbonation with an unusual mix of sweetness with the hops.  A different amber."
"This poured out to a very dark amber. What a nice aroma! A malty-sweet smell. Nice taste, average in the mouth, but with a smooth finish that gives you some hops, but doesn't blast you with bitterness. I like it"
"Notes: A big and impressive Amber Ale ... All American Micro Style. One of the best Amber Ales to come out of the PNW."
"Nice deep garnet hue that's crystal clear with no haze.  Pleasant Willamette hop nose accompanied by subtle fruity esters.  Mild hop bitterness well balanced by a pronounced caramel malt sweetness.  A bit of earthy hop flavor as well.  Finishes with just a touch of roasted grain bitterness on the back of the tongue as well as a tad of alcohol warmth.  This is amber has more character than expected for the norm, as well as more alcohol.  At 6.0% ABV, I would've liked more body to this beer.  Still-- a fairly tasty above average amber."
"I never know what an ""amber"" (or ""red"") is supposed to be...Well, anyway, Full Sail's Amber is a decent ale, nice color and a nice but not exciting malt/hop balance.  I had one excellent example on tap, one with a better body and a slightly hopped statement.  My review is based on the bottles I've had more often."
"One of my favorite ambers.  A darker amber (not sure I see any red, though) color with a nice light tan head.  Very distinctive flavor, with a pronounced malt/fruitiness up front fading to a good hop finish.  There's a real segregation to the mix of flavors.  I wish Full Sail made more of their beers available in Texas -- I've only seen their amber and pale ales."
