"Keg of boont ale drank."
"I've always enjoyed Amber ales but this one was really special. It was a golden color with a nice foamy head. Would buy again."
"A fond remembrance from my period in the Valley. I love Anderson..."

"Purchased in Naas Kildare Ireland Feb 2015. Very drinkable amber ale. Reasonable lacing and light mouth feel. Maybe too easy to drink ( I prefer the highly hopped IPAs). Note: I give high ratings if I like the beer."
"Not very tasty compared to most ambers I've had. Kind of a fruity taste, not a true amber in my opinion."

"Good brown ale from one of my favorite breweries."

"Low hops flavor. Low carbonation. Little to no lacing. Very drinkable. Sweet not to bitter."

"I prefer lighter/smoother amber ales and this is the best of them all."
"Decent copper tone. Finish is bitter, but overly done. Pretty good west coast amber ale."
"Great beer"

"Rating: A, 95/100."
"Starts sweet and finishes with some hoppy bitterness, but malts still prevail."

"Strange caramelly sweet, almost marshmallow aroma initially fades to slightly fruity, floral hops and toasted, nutty malt. Flavor reveals that same, slightly odd caramel overly sweet character, reminiscent of banana, which is countered by bready dryness in the finish. Muddled citrus, floral hops, and light resin lie underneath. Not a bad beer, but not what I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is one tasty, easy drinking beer. The balance between the flavorful malt and zesty (but not overpowering) hops is ideal. Imagine an English Bitters with the volume turned up a click or two. IMHO, American Ambers, such as this one, are under-appreciated."
""
""
""

""

"O: This is a nice beer. It doesn't strike me as a prime example of an amber ale, but something different. I expected a bit more hop flavor and aroma. I'm wondering if this beer may possibly have been on the shelf at the beer store a bit too long. It's a nice beer overall but I'd like to sample another to see if it's age or not."

"This one started very well with the smell being a particular highlight but sadly things started to fade slightly after that with the taste seeming a little watery, more so that I would have liked. Not one I'd pick up again I'm afraid."

"This is one of my favorite beers. This brew is incredibly refreshing. Though it isnt the easiest to pour from the tap, the appearance is amazing. It is a nice dark amber color. The head floats atop- an aesthetically pleasing addition. When it hits my mouth I think caramel. The toasted carmel hops are prime. It is a first class amber ale that all should experience."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, sealed with a pry-off crown. Served in a Samuel Adams Boston Lager sensory glass."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this hopeful beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. Nice label. The beer poured a amber color with a nice tan head. looking good so far. The smell was caramel and nice. However the beer was lacking in the taste department. A little on the bitter side for me. I might try this one again if I could find it on tap."

"Overall a good beer, a malty treat that is fruity and hoppy and pretty easy to drink if you are looking for the intense sweetness of this malty style. Not a session beer to me, but a flavorful brew that showcases malt, caramel and fruit in a very enjoyable way."

"355ml bottle. Nonic glass. Amber color, chill haze appearance. Off-white crown shows fairly good retention. Intense fruity & caramel malt aromas with resinous hues. Sweet & malty flavor are quickly overwhelmed by hops. Medium body. Light carbonation. Oily to watery. Dry bitter/sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a very ordinary and very expensive Amber / Red ale. Before I pass any kind of judgement on it though, I'd like to try it again a) from the bottle instead of the can, and b) hopefully not suffering from old age or whatever."
"O-Overall, a good amber."

"12oz can. Pours a translucent copper brown with an inch of light tan head. Lots of lacing. Not much aroma to this one. Smells of caramel, light floral hops, and bread. The taste is sweeter than I expected. Caramel, lemon, apple, floral hops and sweet bread. A bit earthy at the finish with more malt flavor. Light mouthfeel but with a large amount of carbonation.Very drinkable. Lots of caramel malt flavor. Overall, a solid Amber I'd buy every once in a while."

"Still, all in all I liked this. Not normally crazy about the style, but this one at least stands up and tries to deliver some basic flavor, and does so admirably. It's not a dull wash like a lot of Amber Ales, it's assertive and I liked that."

"O- a really good, almost excellent, amber ale."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/30/2012. Pours moderately hazy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, bread, toffee, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon zest, peach, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, orange zest, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, grass, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, toffee, nuttiness, citrus zest, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice balance and robustness of malt and moderate hop flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent amber ale. All around great balance and robustness of malt and moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
"I like Anderson's other brews so was excited to try this one. Would probably not go back to it unless I needed a refresher after a game of tennis."

"Summary - Nice. Not a bad amber ale. A little more hoppy up front than I'm used to, but still good. Nice aftertaste."

"A dark but clear amber brown, one finger of brownish white head. Smells like toasted bread, caramel, grassy hops. Taste follows, with good nutty sweetness. Mainly sweet/toasted/nutty, but a decent bitterness on the finish. Smooth and creamy, not too much carbonation. Refreshing and tasty."
"A well done amber ale. The hop profile is balanced, and really highlights the malts."

"Poured into a sam adams glass, developed a nice full head, tan, which laced well and lasted. Appearance was a hazy ruby look. Aroma was mild with malty notes. Taste was of caramel and toffee wirh a medium mouthfeel and lingering, slight malt aftertasrte."

"Not bad, a little fruity for me when it comes to amber ales but its nice. Dark fruitiness, medium bodied with carbonation that breaks it up a bit. Just enough hop to balance with lingering sweetness. Pretty clean with a few things that throw that off. Fruitiness throws the cleanliness of the brew off a bit and the body breaks a little thin but otherwise pretty nice especially as a summer sipper in a can."
""
""
"An exceptional beer that features terrific balance in body and taste. Great color with a very aromatic nose. This is one of the best amber ales I have ever tasted. AT Only 5.80% ABV this beer can get you in to trouble. I can honestly say that this is the best amber beer I have tasted in months."
""
""
"A decent drinking amber ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, it's a great beer to pair with food or to have as a sessional during the cooler fall months (in my opinion). It is a solid amber ale that deserves a spot in everybody's fridge. Cheers!"

"Overall this is a solid Red Ale from Anderson Valley but it does not really ""pop"" for me."
""
"It's a great amber ale for sure and quite drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautifully clear red amber with a nice head and good lacing. Nose had lots of sweet and yeast fruitiness featuring notes of raspberry. Taste follows the nose with a biscuit malt core. Raspberry is a lovely segue into the mild short hop finish. Hops have a bit of tea leaf and deposit just a trace of oil on the tongue. Feel is light and crisp with a smooth carbonation.. Highly drinkable and one I will have over and over"

"+Story I heard about this beer: On the label is a bear with deer antlers (a ""Beer""), and it is said that if you drink enough of these and wonder out into the forest you can see this so called ""Beer"". Though that was a cheeky story haha."

"O- Mild, but fairly flavorful. I would put this more into the realm of a brown, because of the mild hop. But still a solid beer."
"From a 12 ounce can, this beer pours a slightly hazy amber color. Small white head. It's an average looking amber ale. The smell is of toast and crackers. Malty. Some fruit and distant earthy hops, but mostly a lightly toasty, bready scent. The taste is somewhat tilted sweet, but is well balanced. Malt comes through in the taste as well, but this is not a sweet brew. Medium in body, easy to drink, and tasty. This is a no-frills amber all, solid and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good drinkability. Moderately good Ale. Good session beer, and on sweet side without cloying. Complex, balanced and subtle all at once. Must try again. However, I prefer Smuttynose, Red Tail and Rogue in this style."
""
"Great ale, it should please both malt lovers and hopheads, given its balance. And if you leave in a country with competitive prices, it is also great as a premium session beer."
""
""
"O: This beer was a regular in my fridge for a long time when I lived in NC but since moving to the NYC area I just don't find it as often. I find this beer to be enjoyable, a touch sweet but not cloying and an easy drinker."
"Copper hued with an inch of white foam on top. The aroma brings some bread, biscuits, a touch of fruity sweetness. Similar flavor, with just a tad of citrus and some bitter hops in the finish. Light to medium in body with crisp carbonation. Well balanced and enjoyable. While I don't drink beers of this style too often, I found this quaffable."
"A pretty good easy drinker that tends to straddle the line for the style--not too malty and not too hoppy. Flavour intensity itself is rather mild but still well enough present. A decent pick for a session beer."
""
""
"O: Very good drinkability. Excellent Ale. Great for a whole day session beer"
"The Verdict: Not bad. A fairly solid, decently balanced amber ale, it would be perfect with a sampler plate of appetizers."

"Pint on tap at the crows nest in Santa Cruz. This brew is a very attractive copper with an orangish hue. Clear and served without a head. Aromas of slightly toasted barley and a bit of orange like fruitiness. Flavor is fresh and crisp. Clean toasted slightly sweet malt up front with a nice fruity hop finish-slightly bittering. Mouthfeel is light bodied and medium high carbonated. Overall this is a well done beer-clean and crisp with plenty of flavor."
""
""
""
"Boont Amber Ale - The bottle says: ""Deep copper with a creamy light tan head. Rich aroma of caramel and a sun-toasted grain elegantly meshed with a mellow noble hop aroma. A full-bodied malt flavor is supported by a refreshing mild hop bitterness with herbal hoppy aromas - lending itself to a long, clean finish."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The noble hops give this brew a lager flavor that I find displeasing as it's really out of style and not at all what I was anticipating. The mouthfeel however was amazing and was what kept me wanting to drink the rest of the bottle."
""
""
"O - A very nice beer overall. There's a richness to it so although it is only 5.8 ABV, I would probably stop at two rather than say it's sessionable. AVBC has such a great variety of outstanding beers - each with strong points!"

"Delicious! I had this years back and haven't had it since. I almost forgot how good this is -- it is easily one of my top choices for an amber ale. It's a great beer to check your palate on. Further proof that you don't have to be above 6% ABV to be flavorful and praise-worthy. AVBC might not release the ""latest and greatest"" and might not be the grand innovators, but making high-quality, easy drinking brews day in and day out is super-sexy to me."
""
"O - Definitely a tasty and balanced amber ale. Superb drinkability. Anderson Valley hasn't disappointed me yet."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, what we liked best about this brew was uniqueness of the hops in both the aroma and the flavoring. The nose really wakes you up, taking you to a very foody, organic place in your thoughts. The flavoring follows suit exactly as you would expect, keeping nice continuity of flavor, and blend between everything that is going on. The feel is soft and slurpable, with the drinker left happy on all fronts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. A nice deep amber hue with a adequate 2 finger off white head. Decent retention and lacing. Nose is sweet malts, brown sugar notes, bread and earthy hops. Taste follows the nose closely and takes on a sweet/sugary front end. Fairly complex with the malts and hops that give it a unique taste. Perhaps a bit too sweet, but unique. Fairly well balanced. A touch hoppy on the end. Feel is just okay. A tad thin and carbonated. Perhaps a bit too dry as well. Overall- A pretty decent Amber that has some good/interesting qualities. Like the sugar/malty front, but distracted by the hop/dry finish. Wouldn't turn one down and will hit this again at some point. Nothing outstanding, but pretty good-"
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with a mix of a slickness and mildly carbonated crisp finish. Super easy to drink!"

"Pours dark amber-caramel with a soapy off-white head. Moderately sweet aromas of caramel malt and grassy hops. Understated. Taste is similar, with caramel and amber malts, grassy hops, and a very mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is light and drinkable, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall a solidly drinkable beer that goes great with pub food. No complaints."
""
"overall, i really like the balanced taste, the lightness of the liquid overall, and would genuinely like to have a few more of these in my existence."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Very nice. It starts sweeter and gets more hoppy and bitter as the taste advances. Quit easy drinking and delicious."
""
""
"This melting pot of flavors have some that I like, but for me, a bit too much going on."
""
""
""
""
""

"I really like it. Bends the style a bit but it has two things I really look for, balance and easy drinkability. Well wothy a try!"

"Here is one of the best beers of it's kind. Boont is a tasty, crisp amber ale, with a bit of a floral fragrance and mildly fruity taste in addition to a complex malt profile. I've seen it finding its way onto more and more taps around here and that makes me a happy dude. I'll pick it over most beers when I'm out."
""
""
""
"O- Good session beer. I prefer a maltier profile but this works. In fact, I wish I had more than just the one 12 oz bottle!"
"It still pours beautifully and glows in its glass. A very tempting amber color, really tough to resist. Has a nice malty/citrusy aroma, medium bodied with a nutty afterthought that hangs around just long enough. It's an easy drinker. Definitely an unchallenging brew, but still worth it's weight in a pinch."
"I am glad that this amber is a bit out of the ordinary, but it won't make me a bigger fan of the style, and I think I almost prefer the more normal, sweeter variety."
""
""
""
"Pours brownish copper with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly and only leaves a trace of lace. The nose is malty and bready, more like an ESB than a red. The taste is malt forward, but crisp nonetheless. The finish is dry with some pleasant hop bitterness."
""
"I love this stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a murky red amber, nice thick head and sheets of lacing. Nice looking. Mineral like and light malt aroma. Thin malt and grain. Light hop finish. Solid amber, but not that exciting. Glad I tried it, but will go for something more aggressive next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Great amber with exceptional balance. Session friendly. One of those rare beers that's approachable enough for the beginner, but complex enough to keep an avid beer fan's interest."
""
"Drink- It was okay. Nothing special or fancy. Might have been a bit old, but thats my fault. Just lacked pop and flavor for me."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- medium bodied, creamy and smooth, lightly carbonated. Not my kind of beer but certainly interesting. I prefer bolder hops to lactose in my ambers."
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinker. Good stuff for a fairly non-descript style."
""
"O. Very nice, smooth malt ale. Good showing for a red ale, which aren't always my favorite."
"decent beer, tastes better in the can than in a glass..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: None either offending nor particular inspiring, however, I liked the flavor and what this beer was about overall."
""
""
"Overall - Something is just missing from this beer. It LOOKS good after the pour which made me expect so much more than what this beer delivered. The flavors are fleeting...almost as if your palate has been cleansed after a swallow. While drinking this beer is not unpleasant, I find it easily forgetable."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent enough amber ale, one that rises above the standard riff-raff - so prevalent across our two countries' brewing output - but doesn't fly too high, hop-wise, as this is no typical California red ale Icarus. Easy to drink, then, if well-rendered malt and fruit esters are your thing - me - I'm in the US of A, and will shortly be seeking out something to address the buildup of enamel on my teeth."
"Not a bad amber ale - and also, this has grown to be a cult classic around these parts - but not necessarily my to-go beer if I had to pick one from a selection of beers within this style. Has plenty of flavors going for it, but needs more body. At least to me it does!"
""
"Why in the heck have I never had this beer before off all the other Andersons? This is a real simple and easy drinking and great tasting amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good Amber Ale. Highly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma falls well short - bordering on non-existent. However, that's the only negative I can offer for this brew."
""
""
"definitely not the best anderson valley can do. who knew they canned too? cool. pours clear redish with a medium tan head. smells like red/amber malts, english a little in nature, and almost no hops or sweetness, which leaves a void in the the aroma and actually in the taste too. caramely flavor, with none of the irish dryness, but the same profile flavor wise. feel is very bubbly, maybe overly so. keeps things fizzy and too light to let the flavors shine. i dont know, a pretty average amber all up, but my first letdown from these guys."
"If it weren't the apocalypse, I don't think I'd have had a second."
""
""
"Overall, I really didn't expect the hop overload in an amber ale. But it is well-balanced. Not a bad beer, but for an amber ale, not one I want to try again."
"its not going to blow your mind but its a pretty solid amber that worth your time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very easy drinker with a sweet start and pretty roasted finish. A nice, light, winter or spring beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Perrier morphed into an ale. This one was a gold medal winner (according to the label), but the sour, mineral water taste really got in the way for me."
""
""
""
""
" Having been a big Barney Flats fan I decided to explore the brewery more fully when I picked up their 12 pack mixer and this 1st one was definitely a solid one."
""
"Pours a clear golden copper into my standard Bell's Brewery pint glass. A foamy, antique white/eggshell head of about 3/4 of an inch forms and dissipates almost as quickly, leaving lace around the entire glass. An immediate pleasing, mild hint of citrus that yields to a light roasted caramel malt aroma. Up front, there's a bit of a sour sensation (not necessarily taste) on the tip and underneath the tip of the tongue. Smooth carbonation over the top of the tongue, but a little scrubby on the tongue's edges. Nothing is overpowering about this beer, but if there is a prevalent flavor it is something akin to caramel, sorghum, and horehound. It finishes with a trace of pine on the back of the tongue. I was disappointed by how this beer tasted, because I expected something a little more based on what I had read. Otherwise, its not a bad beer. Quite drinkable."

"O: Good damn amber here. I enjoyed the shit out of it."
"Poured into pint glass. Next to no head, no lacing. Good reddish-orange color. Smells of hops, pine, and citrus. My initial taste was almost orangy... further on, there's something that's faintly soapy. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, the carbonation is good though. Overall, I can't get over the soapy taste... I would try this again to see if maybe it was just me just this time."
""
"Pretty tasty and balanced -- solid brew!"
""
"Overall very floral which dominates this brew. Basically if you like floral beers you will enjoy this one."
"Overall: Awesome, WAY better than expected. So much better than expected I can't even believe I haven't had this before. Pick this up if you like really malty amber-styled, colorful ales. A-rated."
""
""
"Amber in appearance with very little head. The aroma is sweet as you get the smell of the malt. Flavor starts off good with a nice malt intro but the sweetness just continues to develop and by the middle of the sip it is too overbearing for me, a liquified sugar candy type flavor. Sweet finish too, though the peak of that sweetness lies in the middle. Mouthfeel medium bodied with a little bit of carbonation. I tried this because it was one of my friend's favorite beers but I definitely felt differently towards it."
""
""
""
""
"The taste is simple and satisfying. An everyday beer good with food or without. A very carbonated front with a malt flavor lingering on the top of the roof of your mouth. Aftertaste is minimal making it very easy to drink a lot of this beer."
""
""
""
"O- Perfectly balanced on the malts/hops combination, refreshing and extremely balanced. Not the most flavourful or complex beer out there, so if you are in for bold and super-tasty beers this may not be your cup of tea, but it is a fine, excellent brew. I would gladly drink it on regular basis if US imports did not cost so much"
""
"The caramel dominates and the yeast adds character. Nice body and easy going down. The astringent finish is the only flaw. A good drinking Amber ale."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice amber color with reddish highlights. OK lacing on my pint glass. Fairly clear in appearance. A good looker for the style. The nose is mainly caramel malt, hops, and some sweetness. A little on the weak side for me, but still nice. Taste profile is the same as the nose, but a little stronger taste- very nice and easy to drink. Feel is fairly light, w/ minimal carbonation. This would be a great beer to have several of- it goes down easily, and is pretty tasty for the style. Overall, I would have this again.. It's not my favorite style, but it's a solid beer. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very similar flavours, lots of nutty and toasty malt. Slightly more hoppy than the aroma, again mainly pine. Seems lacking after the initial burst of flavours though, and a little watery."
"This is a solid beer. I've had it before, and I remember some toasted malt notes. Honestly, I enjoy these notes better. I could though use a little more malt backbone, but I'm not complaining."
""
"This is what people need to focus in on. Beers like this that no one has ever even heard of but yet satisfy just as much if not more than any big labeled beers. Well done."
""
"Color was a rich amber color. Smell of dirty dish towels and burnt sugar and malt. Taste was burnt wood and and a sweet unappealing malt combo. The aftertaste was worse. The initial taste was bad and stayed with me even the next day after brushing my teeth and eating. Cant help but wonder if its a bad bottle or just bad product. Too cautious to try again. Almost wrote off amber completely."
""
"Went down very, very easy. Delicious. Sweet, earthy, but not too sweet. A great ""go to"" beer for all seasons."
"D - Doesn't really fit into the style all too well, but not a bad beer at all. Simple, but it's built well and easily drinkable."

"Amber colored beer with a slowly fading puffy head.Aroma is fruity with carmel malts.Taste is citrus,carmel and spices.Overall a pretty good beer with a lot of flavor.I would recommend to try this beer at least once.I can see myself buying this again sometime down the road."

"Final Thoughts: A very nice beer. I was a little iffy buying it because I hadn't ever heard of the company but their labels would have you believe they are as well known as Sam Adams or something. But it worked out, and I'll keep an eye out for them again. Buy this one, it's good."

"4.5 D: Solid beer throughout. Definitely worth an occasional purchase."
"However, they are dominated by particular taste watery beer with nothing except a slight bitterness, comes up. Which is a shame because it is full-bodied and easy drinking."
"D: Boont Amber Ale drinks like a dream. The alcohol hides very well and it's easy to get carried away by just having too many. Whether that's good or bad is left to the end user."
"Overall - This is one very well put together amber ale. It has all the components fitting perfectly into place. Nice maltiness to go with the pronounced but still subtle hop flavors. A cold six-pack of this would not be more than welcome at most social, or anti-social, gatherings."
"Boont Amber Ale is probably my favorite straight up amber ale. The beer pours a nice full amber with froathy white head....at least finger plus...not much lacing. The smell is sweet malt. The taste is sweet malt with a touch of caramel and spice. The mouthfeel is medium body with decent carbonation and balance. Overall it is a great amber ale!!!!"
"Pours a pleasing amber color, true to its name. Foamy. There’s a distinctive and pleasing caramel maltiness to this. (Is it the same malt profile that’s shared across the Boontville family? I’ll have to investigate this one further.) There’s a hoppy bite on the finish that surprises, like a sharp bitter treat."
"T: I have to admit, there's nothing particularly outstanding about this beer, but it may just be my favorite amber out there. It has such a great balance between the caramel malt and floral hop flavors that I could drink it all night."
"Overall: A worthy beer in a can.. Might be one of the better canned beers made in the US these days."
"Rather earthy and seems a little murky. I struggle for words but this is not a flavor I am very fond of. The scent is great, though."
"Wow. I'm really suitably unimpressed with this. It's cloying, sugary and altogether rather unpleasant. Given how widespread this is, I was expecting something at least mild and inoffensive, but this genuinely not something I want to drink often, if at all."
"Overall, not a very impressive beer. There are interesting qualities and rich flavors, but the final product seems flabby and uninspired. Out of balance, out of whack."
"Very thin body and carbonation"
"O- Smooth decent beer. I enjoyed it."
"Overall, way too sweet for me. I didn't really care for the maple and toasted malts. I can see this as a solid amber, but it totally didn't work for me."
"O: One of the most drinkable American Amber or Red Ales that I have had. The reason why I like this beer over others in the style is its subtlety. While other Red Ales can be more acidic, this takes a balanced and middle of the road approach."
"Another Thursday, another random bottle at the weekly Bliss tasting. It pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises orange peel, caramel, very light pine, and a few crumbs of sourdough. The taste holds notes of caramel, orange rind, light lemon zest, light pine, and rye bread. These all come together in a pleasant, balanced flavor. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a creamy feel. Overall, a tasty, well-balanced brew. Right on."
"This beer could be a bit more complex. That said: it's still a nice drink, you can have a few on a night."
"Smells of caramel and bready malts with a bit of a grassy hop smell as well. It pours a an amber body with a creamy white head that leaves behind great lacing. It tastes a bit bitter upfront followed by a greart mellow sweet malty ending. Its a bit oily on the palate but drinks very well and can be made for a great session beer. A great beer to get in the can and go camping with."
"Overall definitely not a bad beer, but not a good beer either."
"Reasonable offering from those pot-smoking NorCal hippies. Amber color with a small off-white head. Malty and hoppy aroma with caramel notes. Strong sweet caramel malt and nicely hopped. Medium body with average carbonation level."
"O: Solid amber ale. Looks good, tastes good, and has an interesting aroma. Looking forward to drinking this one again."
"While Boont Amber doesn't quite possess the body or strength of character to warrant repeat purchases by the Me writing this beer review, I can only imagine what the Me first discovering darker beers would have thought six or seven years ago. Chances are I would have given my right eye for another. This is a serviceable amber ale through and through."
"O: One of the best all-around drinking beers available. I go back to this beer again and again when looking for something to go with my meal. It’s not the most technical beer in the world, but it’s one of the most drinkable."
"Worthy!!!"
"Beer is medium in body with a lead off sweetness and a sweet finish. It is a malty one this beer. It is not cloying but it is on the heavier end of the spectrum for these beers."
"T-Earthy tea like spiciness, with a nice sweet malt backbone. But really just stops there. I was expecting something more up front but its fairly mellow, not what I expected from how the beer initially smelled like. There is a nice fruitiness to the beer in which the malts keep in check. Hop bitterness is minimal but present toward the end of your sip. Overall good balance, I could see myself drinking a few of theses, I saw some available in cans as well might give that a try."
"Another Northern California classic, good for any occasion."
"Pours a clouded, dark brownish-amber. A dense, off-white head stays and sticks. Smell is sort of earthy, with some green spices, and a bit of heat (and band-aid?). Taste is balanced well, overall. Nicely toasted malted barley, much appreciated finishing hops, with a mineral water taste certainly happening. Very good. Could be an amber ale staple for me.."
"Overall: Nice to try, no to try again"
"Looks pretty good; its a translucent amber hue capped with a soapy off-white head. It smells average at best; somewhat farm-y (hay) atop caramel grain, with a faint herbal hop. It tastes good, far better than the nose suggests, with lots of caramel maltiness, though it winds up with a rather dry flavor for the profile. Floral hoppiness is noted throughout. Feels smooth and soft. Overall it is good and drinkable."
"O – An amber with mass appeal and good drinkability… if I wanted to buy it again, but I’m moving on 3.5"
"Drinkability: Overall, a good beer. There is something in the smell and that I do not like, that carry's over just slightly into the taste, I can't put my finger on it. Good beer but not my favorite."
"Usually the best ambers and reds rating wise tend to be very hoppy which is all well and dandy. This is one of the best balanced ambers out there. Worth having around, a versatile beer."
"Sampled from a can with no freshness date. Deep red in color with a hint of orange and excellent clarity. Poured with decent off-white head that slowly reduced to a spotty cap that left spots of sticky lacings on the glass. Fresh floral and wet pine aromas balance well with a sweet caramel maltiness. Smooth and resiny feel with perfect carbonation. Flavors are a nice balance of floral hops and sweet caramel malt. Both the hop bitterness and malty sweetness seem to intensify from the beginning through the middle and slowly transition to a mostly malty finish with a hint of fresh, wet pine."
"Overall very solid, well balanced, and very drinkable."
"I had this on tap at the 2011 American Craft Beer Fest on June 3, 2011. The pour was more deep amber than red with a decent offering of head. There was a strong caramel maltiness on the nose. The body came in at about medium and the taste also brought out a vibrant caramel maltiness but it ended with a nicely balanced hop finale."
"Narrative: Scott Wilson didn't forsee that he would be guidance counseler, in fact, that is the greatest irony of his existence. his father, a doctor, his mother a nobelaureate, and here he was, advising adolescents of their future. ""well you certainly need AP Bio...I call that a versatility class..."" He sighed under his breath. Even if he was the best at his job, no one would notice. He could direct his students to the perfect universities but never receive a single accolade. Such is the life of a high school administrator. He sighed upon receipt of yet another acceptance letter facsimile from one of his students, a school he never attended, but certainly maintained the ability to embrace. This was not the time to wonder about the past, he would embrace the present knowing that he was perpetually affecting the future."
"(22oz bottle from Total Wine). Pours hazy amber color with off-white head. Aroma has bready notes along with caramel and some dried fruit. Taste is caramel sweet and a bit malty. Some hops on the end as well. Thinner bodied with an oily texture. Slightly bitter finish. An ok beer."
"O- A solid amber ale with good balance between sweet and bitter."
"Overall I thought this was a descent amber ale. I tend to like my amber's more balanced and this wasn't that balanced, it was dominated by the malts and it didn't let much hops come through at all. A stronger hop kick in this beer would help balance out all the sweet caramel and toffee malts. I am glad I tried it but I would choose most of the local amber over this one, not sure I would buy this again, it was pretty expensive for what it is. If you like amber's give this one a try, but don't go out of your way to track it down. I wasn't blown away by this amber but I would still be willing to see what other brews Anderson Valley is working with."
"O: One of the first ambers that I tried and still always a good beer."
"O: The beer is easy to drink, especially if you like ones that are sweet but not cloying, but I’m not sure if I could have more than one of these in a sitting because it does feel a bit filling."
"Additional note: as a beer tasting amateur, I usually analyze a new beer and THEN read other members' reviews. I must say the below review by nickfl vividly and accurately characterizes my impressions of this beer. I swear I was thinking what he put into words."
"After pouring it into my glass I was impressed by the brightness of the color and the activity of the carbonation, which provided a rich creamy head. This beer had wonderful aromas of caramel malt and pine (hops). The mouth feel is extremely full, round and silky. A very full flavored amber. The balance of malt and hop characters is the best I've tasted in sometime!"
"D - Very drinkable, this is one of the best amber ales out there. There is an excellent balance between the citrusy hops and amber malt such that both are full flavored aspects of the beer but neither one every feels excessive or unbalanced. The hop aroma is particularly nice for a beer of this style and strength. I particularly like the way the orange flavors of the hops work with the toffee in the malt profile to lend the beer a refreshing, but substantial quality. A great beer and well worth seeking out when it is fresh."
"This is a fine amber. I'm glad to see more Anderson Valley popping up in Toledo."
"Over all this was a very good beer. My first go around with this beer in 2008 left me less than impressed, but I may just grab an other one of these."
"Overall I do appreciate more hop forward amber's but this beer drinks pretty well. I am kind of off put by this and glad I am finishing it off tonight. Not the best rep of the style but not the worst. Very good if you can find it for under 8 bucks a sixer (or what I paid 15 for a case."
"Served from tap into a sampler tunbler. Poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was of sweet malt, jolly rancher, and hair salon. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, nutmeg, jolly rancher, and wet permed hair (WTF!?!?!?). It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I was not a fan of this one. What the Hell was up with the hair characteristics in the aroma and flavor of this one? I should have known not to drink it by getting hair salon in the aroma, but nooo, I had to do it anyways. Blah. I won't be having this one again for sure. Still better than the one where I got burnt hair flavors in it."
"A hazy red copper with a frothy white head. Small amount of head but thick and clinging to the sides. A strong amount of sweetened black tea in the nose. Some caramel but it is mostly dominated by the black tea smell. Floral hops are faintly lingering in the background but I think they mainly contributing to the tea aroma. A mild fruity taste of cherries but also a great mix of the roasted caramel and fruity/floral hop aromas. A lightly dry bitterness that is balanced with some wet juicy hops."
"Taste-Toasted malt,caramel, toffee, hint of orange peel, pleasant hop bite. Very pleasant and easy drinkability. Would make a fine session brew, or a nice entry-level craft beer for the newbie."
"Very solid amber with some interest character."
"Pour light copper with a two finger white head. Sticks around a while. Faint caramel and citrus aroma. A bit metallic, not all that pleasant. Nice crisp hops to start. Pine resin, a tad floral. Moves to a toasted grains and bread flavor in the middle. A bit of spice and tangyness as well. Slight caramel malt. Semi-bitter finish."
"Light amber colored beer with a decent of white head. Very light tasting beer with orange citrus and subtle yeast flavors. I have heard many great things about this brewery, and while I have not been drinking many amber/ales lately, this was a refreshing beer that could be a nice session beer like on a camping trip. Not the greatest amber, but I will be trying more Anderson Valley beers."
"D - Very good and tasty. Its an interesting beer with a number of layers. I'd definitely have another. Good first experience from Anderson Valley."
"D: Decently enjoyable; the taste is good even if most of the rest of the beer falls short. Wouldn't mind trying this again if I knew it was fresh for sure, but otherwise I'm in no hurry to go for another glass."
"Mouthfeel /Drinkability - Easily drinkable. Spicy and medium bodied. Easily drinkable and a good flavored red ale."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, overall it's just a mediocre beer, nothing outstanding but nothing awful either."
"D: This is a nice amber overall. It has a good sweet/bitter balance and is quite drinkable."
"D: This is another very drinkable beer from Anderson Valley. The hops leaves a mild and short lived bitterness in the aftertaste, but other than that, it's an easy drinker."
"D-Was excited to try this beer especially after smelling it, but didn't live up to my expectations. Flavors get lost in the cold and it is just a little too hoppy for my taste."
"Overall: This is one of the beers I drink regularly, and it has definitely earned it's spot as ""old faithful"" in my book. Not only does it ""do the trick", I find it to be quite enjoyable as well. It's among the top of the line as far as American Amber Ales go."
"Copper in body with everlasting off-white head. Aroma of sweet grains, hops, slight wheat, and slight caramel. Sweet malts, caramel, hops, slight grass towards the finish, some echoes of fruit. Light in body with light carbonation. A sessionable sweet, malt forward ale."
"Overall - Not impressed. This was ranked highly and I enjoy ambers. I was looking for a staple to add to my rotation.I am glad I have such regional choices as Bell's, Founders, Goose Island, Sprechers, and New Glarus brewing nearby. I can rely on them for the majority of my sessionable stuff."
"Poured from a bottle into a beer mug. The beer pours an orange-amber coloring with a thick, foamy white head. The beer has malty caramel and sweet earthy smells. This brew has a mild tastes of caramel and toffee, with a slight whisper of hoppy bitterness to balance. The beer stays light and smooth in mouth, and transitions quickly to a slightly sour aftertaste. The finish is quick and light, and there is the slightest sour-film left in mouth after each drink. Very easy to drink, mostly due to the light body for an amber quality. Great to go along with spicy foods."
"Overall: Very good, This is a good example of how a beer should be. Sweet malts with a nice counter balance of hops. I don't really understad IPA's because this does the job."
"Very drinkable light bodied beer. I like it very much and will look for more from this brewery."
"Very drinkable beer. Nice session beer. Not getting the fullness that others have found."
"D: Sits a little heavy in the stomach so probably not a good session beer, but definitely drinkable. I could probably drink two or three of these without feeling too bloated. Overall, this is a very good example of an amber ale. A bit on the hoppy side for my tastes, but I can appreciate the work that went into a beer of this quality. I would not hesitate to recommend this one to anyone who likes ambers or hop-dominant beers."
"Drinkability: very drinkable. I just watched my buddy pound three over Chinese food. Really tasty and Affordable."
"Edit: May have been clouded by the temperature of the beer? Also it seems that a can of this is not the way to go. On draft it was excellent."
"Pours a beautiful transparent amber-brown body with a large white fluffy head of approx 2.5fingers. Smells of cone hops and citrus with a faint blueberry-like bitter-sweetness. Tastes of caramel and bready malt and has a tasty hop bitterness throughout but crescendos throughout the sip. Call me crazy, but I pick up a taste of blueberry. The bittersweetness of a not completely ripened blueberry is evident and this brew is reminiscent of Atlantic Brewing Company's Blueberry ale. Tastes absolutely spectacular and has a really smooth feel to it, most likely due to the fluffy head. An excellent amber ale and one which should never be passed up!!"
"Real clear amber body with frothy head and lace. A strong earthy hop smell with some buttery, toasty malts as well for a stiff smell. Smooth, slightly creamy, with a chewey, bready twang to a medium body. Balanced brew as herbal hop bitterness and caramel sweet malt play on the tongue for a sweet beer w/ some bite. Finishes easily and for price I could drink this all night."
"D - Goes down very smooth without any sharp flavors. I feel that it's a type of beer anyone can enjoy."
"I like the concept here of a more roasted feeling Amber Ale but the nose and feel (which I think could have saved this some had it stepped up more) really let this down. I wish that I could have overall liked this one some more."
"A solid Amber ale. Not my favorite style but this is a good representation."
"Taste is a bit resinous and piny, but not fruity or fresh. The malt is sweet, like dark caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is big, smooth and creamy. Quite tasty and drinkable."
"D: A great introductory beer, in my opinion, to the style of Amber Ale for the craft beer seeker. It possesses a great balance between the style's general characteristics that I can appreciate and hope to revisit the next time I come across this..."
"A nice brew, Nice sweet and creamy malts with decent hop bite and dry finish. Spices and carbonation keep it interesting. Felt like a good winter brew!"
"Pours cloudy copper with nice offwhite head. Aroma of earthy hops, sweet malts and caramel. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is medium body with good carbonation, crisp. Nice caramel nutty finish with a good amount of bittering hops but not to overwhelming. Overall a nice robust and drinkable ambe ale."
"Notes: This medium bodied brew is the perfect example of an American amber ale. Very well-balanced, with loads of flavor. A session brew by any means, but would be a great pairing with just about any meal. A brew for any season. Well done."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good and I would definitely drink it again."
"This Amber Ale from Anderson Valley is most impressive, especially for being out of a can. It pours a dark amber color with a decent scent of malts as a heavy amount of carbonation floats to the top. It has a good thick taste that is so well mixed that it is hard to pick out individual parts of the beer so no taste really stands out. A very well made beer!"
"Verdict: Very AMerican and true to style, this almost defines the American Amber Ale. Worth having in the fridge at all times, but not elite."
"D: Great drinkability - the only thing that might slow me down is the sweetness, which I'd eventually get tired of - this is my favorite Anderson Valley brew."
"M/D: This beer is medium to full bodied, lower than expected carbonation. Overall a very nice beer, look forward to trying other AVBC beers."
"D: A solid, well made amber. Drinkable."
"This beer is fairly hoppy for an amber but a nice one all the same. A good expression of an amber with an interesting pale ale twist."
"Drinkability - In my opinion, this is really a pretty decent brew. I definitely wouldn't turn this down if it was offered. I like it. Warming and inviting."
"A touch heavy especially at 5.8%. I was expecting it over 6% for sure. The carbonation really does make this a fun beer to drink. The body actually is fine in feel, but I don't feel like I'd want 3-4 of these and for a pale I that should be my desire."
"Drinkability: a refreshing and well-balanced beer. Pretty tasty as well, if a little bit sweet. I would definitely have this beer again."
"It definitely has a classic red color and even a touch of orange. The head is mainly white and a good finger thick. The nose is a rich, malty, and caramel. The heavy malt carries over to the taste. I get the faintest hint of those white yogurt covered raisins my kids love. The finish is long while a sticky caramel coats my lips. Nice! I'm glad I tried this big amber that is easy to drink. It would go great with chicken or pork tenderloin."
"poured from bottle into sam adams glass. head is a beige that lasts quite a while. beer is deep amber and a little cloudy. smell is malty and caramel. taste is more of the same with minimal hops at the finish. feels slightly heavy on the tongue. however, drinkability is great. overall a good beer."
"Overall- nice beer, I enjoyed the easy flavors and this made for nice drinking at the bar, recommended for a try"
"D: A really great Amber... nicely balanced flavor makes it an easy-drinking brew with lots of character."
"drinkability is good and i am kinda sad by the fact i only bought one can - this could be my new tailgating beer"
"Don't drink and review."
"Solid session ale. If it were available around me, I would drink it much more often."
"D-A really nice beer that you can have a couple of on a hot night and it won't bore you."
"Final Notes: A great session beer with a good amount of flavor, would pair well with a variety of different foods. One of the best American Ambers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking, and a great all-around beer."
"22 oz. Bottle purchased @ Ballard Fred Meyer for $4.79 + Tax.Floral fruit ester minimal hop front. Sweet fruit malt backbone similar to Summer and Winter Solstice. Clean refreshing light hop sweet end. (2.75 / 5.0)"
"At 5.8% this is a very drinkable beer. Smooth and subtle but still providing plenty of flavor and enjoyment."
"Pours crystal clear amber with a moderate to high amount of carbonation that forms an off-white head that settles quickly leaving some Brussels lace. Fruitcake aroma with perhaps some orange standing out. Feels a bit prickly due to high carbonation, but not a serious flaw. Tastes of caramel malt and pine-like hops with a hard candy sweetness balanced by peppery and cedar-like hop bitterness and a late burst of sweetness in the finish. A bit light and dry and therefore quite drinkable. Not quite as good as the draft version I had a few weeks ago, but still rather enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is a little thin, but this beer goes a long way in the drinkability department: I could see myself enjoying quite a few of these on a summer's porch, or in the autumn after raking."
"D - This beer is very thirst quenching, and the body is smooth and not overly carbonated, making it easy for me to take down a 6-pack. I'd definitely by this one again sometime. Cheers!"
"Drinkable, very drinkable. A perfect amber ale to session. Definitely pick this up in a six-pack, you'll want more than one."
"Writing this review makes me want to go out and by a case of it. If you like Amber Ales, this is one that you must try."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and oily with low carbonation; feels like it is missing something."
"D: great drinkable beer, goes down easy, not too bold with the flavors, leans a little sweeter than my liking but a solid brew nonetheless"
"D: An unassuming beer, delivers what it promises with a good balance stuck between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. A good beer, just wanting more. I guess I am spoiled a bit and can't appreciate the subtleties this beer has to offer but I knows what I like and this beer could stand to have a bit more of that."
"Had this beer on its own in the summer in the late afternoon. Probably a bit better with something salty, maybe pretzels. It was a bit sweet, soft and foamy in the mouth, easy to drink. If it's on sale, then buy it. Otherwise, go for one of your sure favorites."
"Poured amber gold into a pint glass, with one finger of white head, and above average lacing. The aroma consisted of apple, molasses, and crisply floral hops. The flavor was more pronounced, with apple, pear, and molasses all coming to the fore, and finishing on a crisp dry apple note. Thin and mildly carbonated, this beer had a very easy feel on the palate. Very sessionable; excellent summertime alternative."
"Pours a clear orangish/amber with a thin tan head. Smell is a hint of citrus fruit and toasted malt. Taste is herbal and citrusy hops up front, with a smooth toasted bread middle, and a earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, smooth and refreshing, and the Alcohol isnt too high."
"The flavor is slightly sweet as if this beer was underfermented. The body also reflects this, coating my tongue from sip to swallow. There's a mild lactose element in the aftertaste. This is a malty offering where there is nearly no hoppy bitterness."
"Enjoy!"
"DB- Love the looks of this can. A great looking beer with good flavor and aroma. The light fruit taste is very nice over the slight caramel malt. Could use some body but Anderson Valley seems to be a consistently good buy. The first half of the glass was great but the second half was faded and inconsistent."
"A very solid offering from AVBC - this ale is balanced and extremely drinkable. This is ideal for any season."
"Tasty, but probably not super drinkable over a long period. On an overall scale it's ""meh"" for drinkability, for an amber it's pretty good. IMHO."
"O No one flavor stands out. This a very easy beer to drink one after another. I could make this a regular event."
"D - Very tasty beer that I would definitely buy again."
"I love my variety, but I also really love this beer."
"The first thing that I noticed upon cracking the CAN open was that it was filled right to the brim! I have noticed this phenomenon in more than one CANned craft beer, but not so much in the macros. Is it possible that different sizes of CANs are being used, or perhaps the micro-CANners are giving their patrons a little extra ... ? Hmmm. My pour created two fingers' worth of rocky light-tan head that was exploding with CO2 bubbles. The beer's color was a coppery-red, like a new penny, with NE-quality clarity. The nose was immediately malty sweet, but underlain with a piney hoppiness. Mouthfeel was medium and I caught a good bit of malty sweetness on the tongue and in the mouth. Finish was initially minty with hops, giving way on the extreme finish to a lingering sweetness. This definitely gets some cooler space on the way to the beach!"
"Extremely drinkable. In fact, I just opened another."
"MD- Overall the feel and drinkability are both very good. Just a simple good drinking beer. This one also got the non-craft beer wife seal of approval."
"I love the taste of this beer! It is so perfectly balanced with sweetness at the beginning but never leaving and just enough hops to give a finish that leaves you wanting another sip immediately. It is the BEST Amber I have ever had. It is better than Full Sail Amber my previous favorite. As the beer warms, it does accent the caramel malts more. I only bought a 12oz bottle but will be buying 6ers after today. This beer would be great to drink with almost any meal. It could be enjoyed all by itself as I had it or you could enjoy 6 of them while watching a football game. It is refreshing enough for a hot summer day without being to heavy!"
"D - Wow, easily the best amber ale I've had. Interesting enough to set itself apart from the pack, but still very easy to drink and impressive for what's usually a humdrum style."
"Taste is sweet and malty. a little caramel. Fruity. Interesting. Was not expecting this beer to be anything at all. Has some hop bitterness in the finish as well. A pretty drinkable beer. nice."
"D: A good, complex beer. Hit the spot. Would gladly have another."
"Overall is is a very solid Amber, one of the best I have had in fact, I will be getting this more often now that its available around here."
"Looks great in the glass: rich copper color with a bit of fog. No head, but that's because the guy at the restaurant bar ""forgot"" to pour one (my standard complaint applies here). Minimal aroma (see above). Decent taste of apricots and cherries up front; malts dominate with very little sting at the end. In fact, I wanted more hops at the finish. It felt somewhat incomplete. Still, I managed to consume the entire pint with little difficulty. Would be worth trying again, but someplace where the beer could get a proper head."
"Drinkability: overall a very drinkable beer."
"The body was on the light side. The feel had good slickness and a nice dry chalky finish, with very crisp sharp carbonation. Not the best of the bunch but not the worst."
"A perfect example of top notch American Amber Ale."
"mouthfeel is too thick. too much residual sugar, not enough hops to balance"
"Another well-crafted ale in Anderson Valley's lineup."
"I'm not overly excited about this beer, it's O.K., nothing really special. However, compared to other ales, this one ranks in the upper tier. However, this might be a good one to draw non-craft beer drinkers into the fold."
"D: Very drinkable. This is a very underrated style in my opinion. When done right its a perfect showcase for the best of both worlds, hops and malt. This is a very excellent example of the style and one that you could drink several pints of."
"Copper brown color with some decent head and lacing. Retention isn't much but the carbonation turns out pretty high. Nose is malty sweet with some toasted notes, but for a higher score I need more assertion. The flavor stands out above millions of others for the pleasingly fruity hops in add itiom to brown sugar and toast notes from the malting. Solid workmanlike mouthfeel, docked a tiny bit for the metallic carbonation factor. Easy sipper and not a bad little brew for being outside on a warm spring day ( yes it is spring in February in AZ)."
"Drinkability: This was a disappointment for me from a brewery I like. This beer had a lot going in within it but it did not add up to the clean taste I expect from this style. The sweetness and the florals did not mesh the way I have seen in others in the style. I will pass."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle: Nothing distinctive about the aroma; Very cloudy dark amber beer with a thin off-white head and lots of retention. Good balance but not real tasty, dry finish. Did not really impress my taste or any other senses and probably will not buy another."
"Goes down smooth and easy."
"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Great hazy coppery color that seems to glow. Nice creamy head with good lacing. Great caramel flavors which seems to be Anderson's trademark. Slight bitter aftertaste with a sour hint to it. This is a beer I could drink all night. I bought this warm in NJ and wonder how much better it must be fresh if it tastes this good here."
"I'll be blatant. I'm kind of disappointed. Ecerything I've tried from Anderson Valley except for theor oatmeal stout has been just okay. This amber ale is no exception. The appearance is superb with a dark orange amber color to the body and a light tan color to the head. great lacing as it hangs in foamy clumps in ringlets around the pint glass. Sweet malty nose with little hop character. More sweet malt in the taste, a little caramel and ripe orange, with a mild hop character. Kind of tasty, mellow for sure with a smooth creamy feel. Good beer but like their Hop Ottin' IPA nothing really made it stand apart from other examples."
"Nice session beer."
"The aroma is light sweet hops. The taste is much the same, very light on the palate over all but very drinkable. This is an amber ale, nothing less nothing more."
"Body was well above average for the style, full and well rounded without being heavy. Drinkability is very good, much more enjoyable than most of the style. Overall, an excellent example of the style, highly recommended."
"Perfectly carbonated giving it a lively, crisp mouthfeel. Light to medium in body with a pleasant light caramel malt aftertaste. Very drinkable."
"If you haven't tried this Ale I would strongly recommend it. I rate this beer as one of the best Ales I've tried. Anderson Valley did a great job here."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Aroma is sweet and caramelly with some faint hops in the distant background. Taste is also sweet and smooth with a medium body. A bit of sourness on the finish but the sweet, now honey-like malt is the star of the show. Lovely offering in a style that isn't my favorite."
"Easy drinking beer. Nice red ale but nothing spectacular."
"Overall, a good to average beer that is good for the style. Glad to see AVBC here in Texas finally. Rotation: this isn't a style that I usually seek out so probably won't buy any six packs but could see drinking this on-tap as a change-up or best option."
"A rich coppery color with a respectable amount of lace, could have been a little showier but I'll take it. The aroma was decent, sweet malty character with an fruity quality in the background. The flavor was very well balanced and complex. Nice hop bitterness balanced by a malty sweetness. There was a fruitiness that was hard to pin down that was somewhere between apple juice and sweetened tea. Very pleasant overall and highly drinkable. I could see myself drinking this beer all night long."
"Pours a nice dark amber with loads of lacey head taht overflows. Pleasant malty aroma. Easy drinker,nicely lightly toasted, lightly hopped. Something you can drink anytime. Carbonation was right there, initially strong but nowhere impeding drinkability or mouthfeel."
"Notes: A nice amber ale, too carbonated for my liking but a good brew. I must recognize that typically this is not a style of beer that I go after when having other choices so I'm not too passionate about them and tend not to rate them very highly."
"Boont Amber Ale poured a hazy orange with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Caramel malt and floral hops dominate both the nose and the flavor. This beer is quite nicely balanced, really a very enjoyable session beer that I could drink all night."
"Distinctive AV malt nuttiness and bready yeast with a bit of sweetness and toast. Plenty of grassy hop flavor pervades the beer for a nice clean finish. The more I drink of this beer the better it gets, one of the best American amber ales I have had."
"Poured into a pint glass pours an amber color with a foamy white head which leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is of sweet roasted malt with hints of caramel in the nose. Taste is smooth and sweet with a bit of hops towards the finish, not overwhelming but subtle. Overall a good offering and one that I will purchase again."
"D- Overall, Boont Amber Ale is a decent brew but I am a little let down after reading so many great reviews. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad but not great either. I'd put it at about average when compared to other Ambers."
"D: Very drinkable, a lighter amber that is a definite summer drinker. I'm looking forward to trying other brews from Anderson Valley."
"Poured into pint glass red-brown with a nice white head that lasts. Scents of carmelized malts hit the nose. The taste is there, but it isn't anything spectacular. Not much of a hop flavor to it, much like it should be. But the carmel from the nose isn't translated to the tounge. In fact there is some odd after taste, not offensive but not normal. I would like to see some more carmeled fruit flavor from this beer. The mouthfeel is fine, nice carbonation and consistency. Overall, this isn't a bad session beer. But it's nothing more, nothing less."
"taste is dry, sourish, malt, some caramel, and a little nuts, ends on the dry side and a little bitter."
"I love it."
"22oz bottle that overflows upon opening. Nice amber color with a big frothy white head. Slight hoppy aroma. Taste is fantastic; sweet, with a nice balance of piney hops and bready malt. Clean finish with a pleasant fruity aftertaste. An exceptional example of the style; it's a shame I had to go to NY to buy it!"
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer presents a fairly handsome walnut amber color with a nice half-inch head on top. The nose is a bit plain, with a sweet caramel malt scent, and little else. Fairly ordinary amber ale flavor, with caramel malt flavor, light bitterness, and a faint touch of fruitiness--typical fare I've had a bazillion times in brew pubs before, with nothing special to distinguish it."
"A great ""sociable beer", as Michael Jackson would say."
"The taste is rather caramel laden with a nice toasted flavor, and some clove tastes as well. There is a touch of sweetness, and slight orange flavors. Nothing spectacular, but an easy drink nonetheless."
"Pours a lovely, but soapey looking bone white head. Ruby and copper colored brew with central column of bubbling and slow cascade of lacing. Sweet toasted malts give off a musty aire of caramel and some old hops. Sweet toasted crystal and caramel malts. Heavy caramel and sweet Hawaiian bread aromas blended with funky earth hop notes balance out some of the maltiness of this amber brew. Syrupy malty mouthfeel and just a little tinny twang. But a nice malty session brew to inbibe once in awhile."
"Notes: A really well balanced beer with great malt character and sufficient amount of hops. A pick me up beer if I ever had one."
"""solar powered brewery"". I had read many positive reviews on Anderson Valley in the past."
"pours a nice copper color with a nice head and a ring and nice lacing..this is its best attribute of the ale and then its all downhill....the smell is soapy taste differennt and malty and not that appealing it has malts and bready biscuit tones.... the taste is a bitter malt not sweet and not much in the hops smell..the taste is the same its ok but not a nice sweet malt with some nice bitter hops followed by some bready nutty flavors... it just was not there... think troegs or bells amber beers..this one is drinkable and ok i just wont buy it again to many other ambers and pales and ipas to mess with this one.. not recommended"
"Drinkability - Overall, I really liked this and would recommend to friends."
"This is the second really good amber ale that I've had in a week! The deep color of molasses makes this brew mouthwatering. The drinkability of this beer between the mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, and nice hop immediately makes it one of my favorites this spring. The smell off of the pint is slightly sweet but otherwise indescript. I woudl compare this brew to a mild APA in terms of flavor and drinkability. It's A Good One!"
"The taste is smooth, slightly oily and full, and balanced. It has plenty of sweet caramel and fruit balanced with and piney-flowery hop bitterness with some general citrus, grapefruit being detectable but only faintly amongst other, fairly well-rounded hop character. The body is fairly robust and both it and the flavour both hold up well. It is highly drinkable, the flavour, balance, and character holding up well and staying smooth throughout."
"Overall it's a tad too sweet for my liking, but it's a solid brew. Not a stand out, but solid."
"D: Highly drinkable, though nothing spectacular. As the review indicates, pretty much everything was ""good."" Everything above average, but nothing particularly excellent. Still, one of the better examples of the style that I have had."
"D- And it goes down oh so easy."
"Drinkability: Boont Amber Ale is a very impressive. It's even and well flavored, definitely the best amber I've tried."
"D - This is a good beer...my first offering from Anderson Valley and I think this could easily be enjoyed in a session"
"This is a great example of an american amber ale. The balance between the malts and hops is right on and the finish is very clean."
"D - I really applaud the restraint in this ale, it does get overly hopped for the style and I could have gone for another bomber honestly. The freshness has a lot to do with my review I am sure since Anderson Valley beer travels and sits in PA whereas this was sent directly from CA by Josh - thanks again."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Taste: Once again, small grapefruit bitterness, bigger than average maltiness."
"Very drinkable diffently a session beer or even a session starter."
"D: easy to drink, but i'm not sold on the flavor"
"The color when poured was a medium golden brown with a reddish hue. Not a lot of foam when poured and no lace at all. The smell of roasted malts and hops filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste of hops was a little over powering. The hop flavor over powered the other flavors of fruit and spices that could have been. If you like a mild hop flavor with just a bit of tartness and bitterness, you'll like this Amber Ale!"
"Huge head immediately on the pour, mainly larger bubbles glued together by smaller ones, average plus lacing. Classic amber red color, just about fully transparent, slight fade to yellow-orange at the rims. Very approachable nose of pink grapefruit and tangerine juice, chamomile tea, hard caramel candy, as it warms you get more caramelized brown sugar, that said, balanced enough that you detect no favoritism between hops or malts. Medium-bodied, its unassuming serenity momentarily overshadowed by frothy carbonation through the attack. After that, it's fair shares of pink grapefruit, orange citrus, wildflowers, minerals, brown sugar and chocolate taffy. No unnecessary bite in the grain, oat components, and breadiness has a taken out of the oven a couple of minutes too early feel. Don't think of it as a wimp, though, stiffens nicely through the finish. Drinks smoothly while you always know it's there."
"I absolutetly love this beer. The first time I had it was on draft in a bar in Santa Cruz. It poured out with a lot of head. It had such a nice aroma to it, kind of woodsy. Taste really smooth caramel nutty just a bunch of greatness. Definitely reccommended!!!"
"A very forward taste with berry and vanilla that dissolves into a mildly smokey caramel that lingers with just enough sweetness to be pleasant. I'm drinking this on a very cold winter evening, and am thinking it would be superb on a warm fall evening"
"Decent carbonation, but a times a bit over done. Big bottle size with a slightly higher than average ABV makes this a borderline session ale."
"D - Legendary session beer."
"Overall: The beer has an astringent and a moderate carbonation for the mouth feel. The finish is bitter but lingers on the palate for a few moments. This is a very good amber ale. I have tried a few others amber ales but this one so far is one of the better one. I like the balance of the beers malt to the hops. The only thing that I feel is it didn't have head retention."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color. Full 1 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malts, a little hop, and some fruity aroma. Fits the style. Smooth, crisp, and low carbonation. Initial hops bitterness (light in nature) quickly gives way to a sweet malt. Initial aftertaste is of a fruity flavor that gives way to a strong malt flavor. Body is just right, not watery and not too overpowering. Only complaint would be that it is a touch to sweet for my tastes, but overall a really good beer."
"Beer poured a deep copper color with an outstanding off white head. Nose initially had a hint of light fruits but becomes mostly malty after a few sips. Taste is well balanced between the caramel toffee malts and the english style hops that lend a light apple/pear finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and pretty smooth. Drinkability is quite good. This is a well balanced beer that is right on the edge of being sessionable. Not sure why it took so long to try this but it is definitely recommended!"
"It also has a bear with deer antlers."

"Good drinkable beer."
"Notes from 2/11/07"
"I'd like to thank AVBC for hours of pleasurable Boont Amber drinking."
"Overall, one of the best amber ales I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"D - This is a pretty straightforward amber ale that's simple and drinkable, albeit a tad thin and watery overall, possibly due to the age of the bottle."
"D- This is a somewhat easy drinker. Ambers aren't really my thing so I would probably tire after a couple, but if you like them then you'll probably be able to enjoy a whole lot of this stuff."
"Great beer. I'd love to hang at a bar and drink these til I couldn't drink anymore. Nice smooth taste, but not that unique. If you're looking for a one of a kind beer this probably isn't it, but would fit well with any mixed variety of beers. If I saw it in a pile I'd pick it up. Especially impresses withed shape."
"Overall this one is OK, but nothing to get excited about."
"A good, but very typical American Amber, worth drinking, but nothing that separates it from the crowd."
"T: extremely drinkable. ridiculously smooth. the most drinkable amber I have had yet."
"D-Nice abv something you can partake all night"
"Pours a clouded amber. Nose use malty with some caramel. Flavor is wads of caramel. Malt on the backside. Nice and thick. Robust and lasts for a while. Heavy, heavy caramel though. Real smooth feel on all ends. Nice to drink. Well bodied and consistent. A good one."
"Great gateway beer, or even just a great beer to enjoy anytime. My wife and I loved this beer when we lived in CA and are glad we got another chance to have this again."
"Overall, one of the best Ambers I have had. The flavors blend so well together and the caramel flavor is almost unrivaled."
"M + D: A smooth drinking round, medium body. Just enough stick to leave a lasting impression on the way down. A very decent brew - this could potentially become a staple of my selection at some point."
"D: Drinks alright, but if it wasn't so darn cloying, it would go down much easier. I don't think I can finish it."
"Now this is an amber ale for me, nice quality. Reddish brown color with a decent head leaving trace amounts of lacing. Aroma is not extremely intense, but it is sturdy sweet with caramel and a light hop aroma very enticing. Fresh and satisfying to the palate a real good feel to this one. Flavor is incredibly balanced. Tons of malt in this one and just the right amount of mild hops. Perhaps one of the most balanced beers ever to cross my lips. Great Amber, sweet and yummy a pure delight."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good Amber Ale, and probably one of the best that I have had. I prefer a beer that tips toward the malt, and this one certainly does. There is quite a bit of complexity to the malt, and the hops let them come out and show their stuff. Even after the beer warms up, it is still a very drinkable brew and I would certainly drink it again."
"Excellent beer and one I will have again. I can see drinking a couple as I watch the Patriots this fall. I am sad to report I only bought a single bottle to try. I will head back for more eventually."
"Really smooth and nicely drinkable."
"Drinkability: One of the better ambers I've had lately. A nice malt backbone balanced by citrus hops without anything going out of control either way. Full, delicious, highly balanced and drinkable."
"-Oelergud"
"Taste follows suit. Burnt/toasted malts overwhelm the flavor and finish of this brew. Toasted, biscuity malts. All in all a decent brew, just not quite what I expected. Good drinkability, somewhat sweet."
"Pretty good stuff."
"Overall, a little on the soft side in hops, but still complex enough to be very enjoyable. Malt driven with lots of sweet fruit flavors, with just enough hops to provide balance. Overall, one of my favorite ambers."
"Mouthfeel is creamy but a little flat. Still pretty easy to drink."
"I really liked this amber ale. It is very well balanced between the malt and hops."
"Compared to the monster west coast beers we have been enjoying over the past few years this is a very drinkable beer. It is easly one of the most balanced session beers I have had in a while"
"To me, it seems not much more than a run-of-the-mill amber that can be found in a typical brewpub. Just my opinion, though."
"P.S. Sorry for the short review. I'm not a beer drinking professional."
"In the bottle you have little head/light head. But it still has the great hoppy taste!"
"D - Very easy to drink, not my favorite for this style but a pleasant drink."
"MF/D: Decent session beer, relatively mild, but enjoyable. A good standard for American Ambers, which tend to not be my cup of tea. It wouldn't be my first choice down the pub, but tasty nonetheless."
"This was a decent Amber. I am not a huge fan of Ambers but these guys did it right. They also have a damn good Oatmeal Stout. Poured a deep copper color with a dirty white head and great carbonation. Nose was citrus, slightly hoppy, some malts and even biscuity. Together they did not mesh well. Not well balanced in my opinion."
"Cookielike smells of toasted caramel malt -- very little hop presence in its aromas. Nice, refreshing, well-balanced taste -- toffee, caramel, ripe citrus in the malt profile with a nice snap-brim bittering from the hops toward the end. Feels crisp and well-carbonated but not overly so. A very drinkable beer -- probably the most drinkable I've had from this brewery. Good hop notes without overdoing it. Nice West Coast spin on a generally drinkable style that's really hard to screw up."
"A nice, solid amber ale that's generally refreshing and rather enjoyable. Nothing mind-blowing, but still quite solid -- something I'd try again when offered."
"The body is closer to mid than full body quality. A bit chewy with good carbonation. Easy to drink but some off flavors limit this beer."
"Recommended..."
"Not deep, but very tasty with a great mouthfeel."
"This is an extremely drinkable session type beer. This is a great beer to serve to swill-beer drinkers who you are trying to move to craft beers because of its balance and the fact that it has nothing offensive going on. This beer has broad appeal."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a slightly murky, copper/amber color with a thin head comprised of lots of large bubbles. The smell is slightly malty sweet, caramely, slightly fruity and also has a slight hop presence. The taste is quite interesting, can't quite put my finger on it... the intro is slightly hoppy but well balanced with caramel malt and finishes biscuty and slightly grainy. Different is how I would have to describe it, but in a good way. The mouthfeel is medium in body with a light, smooth carbonation. Drinkability of this one is pretty high, good session beer."
"Not a particularly pleasing beer, but a novelty, anyway."
"D - This is a very nice amber beer. The smell was really surprising."
"The taste is of caramel malt, roasted malt, some bread, and midway through and through the finish, there's a nice hop bite that gives a nice balance to the over all flavour but it's still slightly on the sweet side and, for me, it works nicely. Amber/Reds that are tasty enough to keep me interested for the entire session aren't all that easy to find for my palate but this one fits the bill. I recommend it because it's tasty and it's a good brew to session."
"Pours a light copper color with an off white head. Hops is noticeable in the pour but the aroma doesn't linger. Taste is slightly sweet and malty with a slight bitterness in the finish. Mouth feel is medium with light carbonation, while drinkability is high because of the smoothness of the finish and the nice malty sweetness."
"Poured an amber red, with a decent off white head. Smell is of piney hops. Taste is also of piney hops, with some caramel, roasted malt flavor coming through. An enjoyable brew, which fortunately for me is readily available in Northern California."
"Poured into a pint glass producing minimal head. Dark reddish orange in color. Subtle floral hop aroma becoming more noticeable as the beer warms. Bitterness on the tip of the tongue. Well balanced with a slightly creamy mouthfeel and dry finish. This would qualify as a pleasant session beer. One of the best American Amber ales I have tasted."
"D: Very good drinkability, nicely carbonated and one you could easily drink all night."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like toasted malt, caramel, grain/bread, brown sugar and a bit of hops. A nice malty aroma overall. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a noticable nutty taste and a lingering slightly bitter hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit chewy and has average carbonation. Drinkability is good too, I found myself picking up my glass for another drink quicker than I thought. If in the mood, I could have this as a session beer. Overall I think this is a good all around brew, I'll have to pick this up again in the future."
"Pours a dark caramel color with a nice off white head. Smell at first is of mostly hops and a touch of caramel like sweetness. A very nice balanced smell. Taste is definitely more malty at first and overall tastes nice, and balanced. As it warms, the mild hop flavor dissipates somewhat and becomes more of a backdrop to the big caramel creamy taste. Definitely changes as it warms a bit. Overall a good rich amber."
"Drinkability is about average, this one is fine but pretty indistinct."
"Well carbonated and very good mouthfeel. I still believe this one is among the best amber ales out there."
"D- Highly drinkable, love the creamy caramel. Excellant change of pace for my hop heavy rotation."
"The beer settles in the glass a chill hazed orange color with an adequate compact head. This is a nice little treat in a glass. This ale leans towards the malty side with a kiss of tea-like hops. Actually, the flavor from the maltiness reminds me a bit of an Oktoberfestbier, and like that beer, this can be quaffed with ease despite an alcohol level that's just a little heavier than normal."
"D-The memory remains the same....great drinking amber ale with character and flavor."
"The aroma was of honey and caramel. The taste was well balanced between the malt and the hops. I thought it finished nice on the hop side which gave it a fresh taste. You can taste the caramel thru the drink and it was soft on the palate. Very enjoyable amber."
"Boont Amber has for years been a fridge staple when I am on an amber kick... and is always the brew I try and emulate when I make an amber homebrew. A very good brew from a very good brewing company."
"Poured from the bottle into tasting glass. Amber/orange in color 1"" head which dissapates quickly to 1/4"". Grapefruity nose with slight sweet carmel malt, pretty faint. The taste is forwardly malty with slight hoppy bite on the finish. The mouthfeel has nice carbonation slighty chewy, but still refreshing. I could drink a couple of these large beers in a sitting."
"Had in its bottle at Moan and Dove. The drink settled with a murky, amber-like appearance. The smells of malty spices with some citrus were most apparent in this drink. The ale had a perfect balance between citrus flavors and bitter-sweet flavors. It had a great carbonation to it, making it pretty refreshing. In general, this one heck of a good amber ale."
"Pours a clean amber/ copper color with a tan head. Aromas that consist of grapefruity hops. In the taste, grapefruity/ citrus hops and a nice sweet maltiness. A small bitter mouthfeel and a dry maltiness with a sticky-sweet aftertaste. Quite hoppy for an amber, but nice and easy."
"Final thoughts  There are a lot of subtle flavors in this brew indicating a high degree of complexity. This is one that I would like to try at a variety of temperatures."
"Smell is of sweet malt, some grapes and raisin in the aroma as well. Taste is of grapes, and prune juice. I had to taste again and yep, I really did not like the flavor. Mouthfeeling is crisp, but does not make up for the flavor. I have no idea what was going on with this one."
"Surprisingly good Red Ale. Pours a clear coppery, amber color with a nice size off white head. The head shrinks down to a covering of the top of the glass. Lacing is fairly thick.Aroma is fairly pronounced, gives an indication of a hops / malt balance. Taste is very good. There is a nice balance between sweet malts (caramel?) and Celebration Ale style resin/pine hops. The hops flavor is stronger, but nothing jumps out at you. A nicely balanced beer. Mouthfeel is rich enough, a touch of Celebration Ale style resin / oiliness but nothing as pronounced as a good West Coast IPA. This is a well balance (for a hophead), crisp and tasty beer. Just right as a session beer and more than worthy to be savored for its own sake out on my deck. A very nice take on Amber Ale."
"Overall a very good amber ale and definitely worth trying. Not my favorite but if someone said it was it wouldn't surprise me."
"Quite drinkable. I love Bell's, don't get me wrong, but teir amber ale, like many others, is very grassy and tangy with the hops. The extremely sweet malts balance this out like no other amber ale I've had in a while. Delicious."
"Served a mostly crisp amber with a diminishing head. The aroma was burnt caramel and earthy pine hops. The taste was an interesting blend of sweet and caramel malts with some underlying citrus hops. The beer was light bodied with low carbonation. This was an enjoyable beer, but I would likely almost always pass it for something else."
"It's just not the same out of the bottle, which is a shame."
"Very drinkable beinmg that I drank two and half beers worth with no problems"
"D- I didn't dig this beers balance and that made it especially difficult for me to drink for a style that should be an easy session beer."
"This looks like a great beer, excellent head and head retention, deep amber body, but not too dark. The aroma is pretty standard for an amber ale, medium malt background with a jumble of american hop aromas, mostly floral. The taste has a malt background that is a little exaggerated by crystal malt, it reminds me a lot of one of my first homebrews in this way. There isn't so much depth in maltiness, but more of one layer of crystal malt underneath the pale malt base making the caramel seem a little unnatural. The hops lack distinction, but are nice if you like a thick bitterness in your drink. Its hard to make it through a hole pint of this, and I won't be ordering it again. For beer that's supposed to be fairly drinkable, I think there's a slight lack of balance."
"smooth and very drinkable. Enjoyable"
"This is a good American amber, but not a brilliant one. It pours a decent copper/amber color with a modest head. The smell is very hoppy right after the pour, but becomes quite a bit more malty as it warms, almost bready and grainy. Initially I thought I was in for a very hoppy, caramel beer, but as things settled, I was deceived a bit. This is a beer which is better after it sits a little while. I tasted too much hoppy bite, too much oxidation, and an overall imbalance right out of the bottle. As the beer settled, its caramel, malty, balanced characteristic arises, and the warming bread like notes became more pronounced. This is a medium bodied, slightly carbonated ale that is quite drinkable and not overly strong for its 5.8 ABV. My suggestion is to be patient with this beer and it will insinuate itself in your good graces. The mouthfeel is modest and the aftertaste is slightly bitter, but just enough to keep it honest. L'Chaim."
"D - This is an excellent beer with PERFECT sessionability. Everything is smooth, creamy, clean and excellently crafted. Next time I'm in Hudson, this will be coming back with me."
"D: A good beer from Anderson Valley, not my favorite beer from them, but a workable brew, an above average American amber."
"The beer is a little to sweet to be a session beer, but certainly is a nice little complex number that I will be sure to enjoy from time to time again"
"The texture is a really nice thickness, not filmy or chewy. It's a perfect thirst-quencher, but also is a bit dry. Feels very English. To me, this is what an amber should be. Balanced and thick. For crying out loud, bring me more!"
"D - A nice, pleasant easy drinking amber. Expected a little more on the flavor but still a nice easy drinker."
"Pours a pretty amber hue with deep golden highlights, topped by a small crown of creamy white head. Aroma of caramel malt, a touch of brown sugar and light fruit, and just a hint of fruity hops. Palate is smooth and staightforward - caramel and a touch of pale malts, balanced nicely by some mellow, fruity hops. Smooth finish leaves a taste of sweet, mellow malt after the swallow. Body is a touch creamy, and just about perfect for the flavors that are imparted. An excellent, easy-drinking amber ale."
"D: A pleasant departure from the boring reds around these days. A really nice offering in this beer style -- unique and very drinkable."
"I had it on tap on 5/23 and it's even better. I had a beer menu of about 30 choices in front of me and I went back to Boont Amber for a second pint."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark amber , with a thin light tan head - nose of hops , spruce , resin , toasty , and malt chocolate  taste of malt , lightly hopped , toasted , and sweet - body is medium , with medium carbonation  aftertaste of roasted malts , and hops"
"Definitely on the dry side - most American Ambers are sweeter, chocolatier, doughier. A great example of integration. Yummy."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It really did not have an aroma. Was not too bitter and definitely not sweet. I could drink this beer every time. It was dispensed by a bartender and the glass immediately fogged over so there was no head to review and it was hard to determine clarity. But it tasted great!"
"Have revisited this since, a bit too toffeeish and sweetish."
"Tastes hoppier than the fragrance puts on. Not really much going on...somewhat forgettable. Moutfeel is juicy as a mandarin orange with decent carbonation levels, a smooth finish and almost no aftertse. Bottom line: it goes down smooth and drinks easily but not much here in the way of complexity and taste."
"This is one of the best amber's I've had that doesn't rely on an over the top hops profile (for the style). It's is drinkable, yet still has a nice, rich caramel flavor. I wish I had bought more than just a single of this. Not your average amber, it reminds me of a nice, dark lager. I wonder if a decoction was maybe used for the malt profile."
"Overall, this is a good beer with a nice balanced, slightly sweet floral flavor. It's not too strong, and makes a good accompaniment to a meal."
"Pours dark-medium amber with bubbly golden-white head. Thick to medium lacing. Toasty malt aroma with some citrus and pineapple, undertone of hops. Medium body with a nice warm, round mouthfeel. Floral and citrus flavors followed by toasty, nutty malts. Good balance with mild hoppiness; accentuated by light citrus and wood undertones throughout. A bit sour. Hints of caramel. Buttery, mildly spicy finish with just the right touch of graininess. Slightly bitter aftertaste."
"Drinkability- Very good for the style. Maybe just a tad heavy, but it's got a nice complexity for an Amber. I'm not much into ambers, but this one is pretty nice."
"Verdict: pretty good. A friend talked it up before I tried it, but I probably wouldn't have. It does deviate from the style a bit, it was a lot like an alt, as feloniousmonk commented."
"I had my suspicions going in to this beer that it was going to be rotten but I was pleasantly surprised. I don't think this was the best bottle of this beer I could have grabbed but all things aside it faired rather well and was pretty decent."
"This beer looks great and smells very good, but the drying astringency didn't leave such a good impression. I would bet that it would show better paired with food, however."
"Pours a very reddish amber with a substantial head that dissipates rather quickly to a ring. Nutty malts on the nose, along with some metallic hops and hints of oranges. On the palate, those nutty malts come up first, followed by solid hop bitterness before turning a bit fruity-sweet (oranges again) at the end. Mouthfeel is full for the style, with some dextrine characteristics and bracing carbonation. Quite drinkable, but a touch filling for the style. Still, overall a very enjoyable beer -- one that provides a nicely balanced drinking experience that both a malt monster and a hop head can enjoy."
"A solid Amber Ale from Anderson Valley."
"It's a wonderful beer that's very easy to drink. I wish I had easier access to this beer as it's easy to throw back and probably the best amber ale I've ever had."
"Give this one a try."
"Into a pint glass, pours a pretty nice amber with good fluffy head, stringy lacing, pretty good. A kind of mild mannered nose, mildly hopped. Tastes almost a little too hoppy for what I know of ambers, but whatev. It hosts that nice load of hops, decent malt... overall, pretty decent, ya, but hardly one to brag about."
"Drinkability: Wonderful, substantive refreshment. Makes me wish I had a ribeye."
"Despite not being top notch there's certainly enough flavor, depth and alcohol in this beer to have several rounds."
"Overall- Damn this was good!! Anderson Valley is 1 of the best breweries in the country!! Yet another good offering from them!!!"
"D: Interesting that quite a few of the Anderson Valley beers have some of the same characteristics. This beer wasn't bad."
"D - Above average, but I'd grab numerous other ambers before I'd grab this one again."
"D- Sessionable without a doubt, awesome balance, count me in for another (couple) rounds of this one."
"Notes: A pretty thick amber that I liked. Its a testimant to the brewery that they can pull this offering off without a hitch. Not the style so much as their take on it."
"I was very surprised by the color and taste of this beer. I knew not to expect a normal amber ale from Anderson Valley, but this goes way beyond the norm. Pours a dark brown color with a little head. Smell is predominantly of mild hops and golden malt. Taste is great. Again, its the hops that start off the big taste, but the malt is definitely what lingers in the back. There is a slight burnt taste. The amazing thing is the big amount of tastes that are balanced in the beer."
"Overall good and drinkable beer. I'm starting to see these guys more and more in my local liquor stores, which is nice to have the new options."
"Drinks too easy, this is an amber you can sink your teeth into! At damn near $9.25 a sixer, a bit pricey"
"Excellent! Worth seeking out! Very unique in its maltiness!"
"Overall a very drinkable and tasty brew. Definitely one to have again and also recommended."
"Appearance is a deep amber, moderate head, very good lacing. Smell is very sour and rancid, like rotting fruit or the vacuum cleaner when you haven't changed the bag in years. I don't know if the tap line was dirty or the keg old - I'd expect a place like Linwood would keep extremely fresh beer. Taste was slightly sweet, malty and fruity. Pretty flavorful but not too complex. It was pretty average. Not the best amber I've had, I'd like to try it again in bottle form as the freshness of the beer might have been in doubt."
"This is a super enjoyable beer. Pleasant, well-rounded, and highly sessionable."
"Fairly drinkable. This is a beer that I bought a single to just try...don't consider this style one of my favorites, but this one is pretty good....really worth a try."
"Spicy and active on the tip of the tounge this medium bodied brew holds is carbonation through the finish making it some what reminicent of a cider. A very solid beer, easy drinking but may taste even better paired with a good meal or some sharp chedder cheese."
"Drinkability: Fine flavor with splendid balance. A pleasure to consume, and quite refreshing. I would welcome another."
"Overall impression: Solid example of an American amber. Drinkable and smooth."
"All in all, a nice representation of the style from a very good brewery."
"Red/copper in color and clear. Nice frothy head dissipates but doesn't disappear, leaves some lacing. Aroma is of fresh dough and some fruity sweetness. Medium to full bodied and nice and creamy. Well-balanced toffee and caramel malt sweetness and hop crisping. Very nice amber ale."
"Poured a medium copper color with sparse tannish head. Nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is loaded with malt with some mild citrus notes also present. Taste starts off very fruity sweet, with some nice citrus (lemon) tastes also showing through. Finish is a bit too dry to compete nicely with all the malt sweetness. All around a good beer, but not great."
"Delicious and refreshing - very drinkable. Another excellent beer from the folks at Anderson Valley Brewing. One of my favorite American Ambers."
"This is my second beer from Anderson Valley and a great example of an Amber Ale. Keep up the great work."
"Pours a lightly ambered golden color with a finger of off-white head that falls to a quarter inch coat over top. A solid cascade of bubbles boil up from the bottom of the glass, maintaining the head. Nose is nice and sweet. Loads of caramel with a lighter orangey hop and mild toastyness. Smells nice. Flavor hits with caramel malt immediately, followed by a peppery hop, moving towards a light orange citrusyness and very mild toastyness on the finish. What amazes me about this one is that it drys the sides of my tongue out really bad. It leaves just a hint of residual bitter after swallowing the beer as well. Feel is solid at moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty well where I wanted to find the feel. I find this to be a very enjoyable beer. Very flavorful, but nothing too big to dominate. I like the caramel quality this one shows a lot. Feel keeps it something I can drink, not just sip. A solid amber ale."
"all in all a great beer. only drawback is the price."
"This was very enjoyable to drink, even though I don't partake in this style very often. Not a lot of of depth here, but what's present works well and this would be great for most types of tastes. Additonally, it has the richness of a fall brew with the warming power of a winter beer. It balances both those traits well, and I'm glad I took a chance on this!"
"Pours deep amber. Head vanished quickly,into average lace. Aroma is of malts and carmels,and is very inviting.Mouthfeel is medium. Not much carbonation. Taste is smooth,and sweet from start to finish. The malts and carmels are very evident,but not overwhelming. Nice balance. I recommend this beer."
"Overall this beer is fantastic. To me amber ales are always sort of questionable as to how they will taste. I have had so many that they range from too hoppy and bitter to too malty and sweet. This one does a helluva good balancing act. This was the beer that turned me on to craft beers, a few years ago."
"Drinkability: With a light body and a relatively complex malt profile, I could definitely take a few pints of Boont (especially served a bit too cold on a warm afternoon). But the prominence of the crystal-malt sweetness keep this from being a truly perfect session beer."
"This has a more pronounced hop character than many American examples of the style. The hop bitterness is a major player, but there is great deal of floral and spicy complexity accompanying it. Not that the malt character isnt a major player tooa great deal of complexity here too. Basically what Im trying to say is that it is both well-balanced and complex. Damn tasty too."
"Drinkability: This is a relaxing beer."
"Good feel, no lingering aftertaste."
"A decent amber, but it isnt Anderson Valleys best brew, in my opinion. Still, recommended."
"Drinkability- Not usually a huge fan of amber ales, but this one was pretty drinkable. Maybe on the session borderline. Gets pretty good ratings, so all those people can't be wrong."
"As a side note: purchased this one since this year's winter solstice was so yummy. Looks like I need to try some more AVBC."
"The body is appropriate medium in structure, with a low-end carbonation. This has some promise upfront, but is lead astray with a variety of tailing chaos."
"12 oz bottle pours a deep, hazy amber-copper color with a nice foamy off white head that leaves some lace in the glass, malty caramel aroma, sweet malty nutty flavors, medium bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel. Finishes with a pleasant bitterness, a tasty amber ale."
"Can't wait to have another!"
"This is a versatile brew, I think many people will like it, hop hounds and neophytes alike. It's just a very well balance ale. Sparing you all the taste profile cliches, I think that this beer has a very full flavor, but not like some the extremely hopped beers that tear your head off. Beautiful appearance with strong head, it lived up to the accolades."
"Find this one. Buy it. Drink it."
"Drinkability: A decent amber that leans to the sweet side; would benefit from a more balanced hop profile"
"This beer has cracked my ambivalence towards ambers. Very nice job, Anderson Valley!"
"Your usual, coppery colored amber beer. No real head. Nice,soft aroma-somewhat malty and floral. Very nice malty flavor. A good touch of caramel sweetness. The overall flavor is very smooth and mellow. Nice body for style. Very full. Very enjoyble and drinkable beer. Well worth a try."
"My impression of an amber ale is that of a weak brown ale. Nevertheless, this one pretty safe. Looks nicely of a red with some copper hues. Big bubbles and nice lacing. Aromatic on the side of malt, almonds, caramel, and thin molassas. Tastes much the same with some toasty and yeasty characters. Low hop flavor and bitter; could be amped up a bit. Finishes mildly sweet and lingering. Low but present alcohol flavors. This beer has no real stand-out characters, but is well balanced for easy drinking."
"Pours as a rich, consistent amber color; unlike some others, mine had virtually no head. Taste was subtle, with mild maltiness & slight fruity/floral quality. I also detected something akin to bread (like a yeast roll...) in the finish. Very light on the hops. A smooth beer & quite drinkable."
"This is one awesome beer. Pours a copper color with a nice head. Not much lacing afterwards though. Scents of sweet caramel, malt. Has a medium body with a nice sweet taste. I really like this beer, it's a very new taste to me. Definitely will be buying a 6er. Many of these can be had for sure, watchout, LOL."
"Appearance is a copper color with good foam and lacing. Aroma is floral with strong fruity hops. Initial taste contains bread, a thickish mouthfeel, crisp, bitter hops balanced nicely with with malt. The mildly sweet flavor persists to the end, and the finish is barley, malt, hops and brown sugar. A nicely brewed, good beer."
"A fine amber ale, I just wish AVBC would start selling in GA."
"Settles into a deep and clear amber - this is essentially what I want my amber ale to look like. The flavor is a simple but rich maltiness with a really nice full body. Just enough of a hint of hops to be allowed to come from a good west coast brewery. My own ""house"" beer for a long time, it's easy on the palate and the wallet - can't go wrong with this one."
"Very nice American Amber here. Pours a very dark copper with lazy head. Smell is strong of caramel and alcohol. Taste is sweet, with more caramel notes and not a trace of bitterness. Nice mouthfeel, with not too much carbonation. Very smooth, very drinkable. A wonderful session brew..."
"Poured a copper/red color with a white head. Plenty of cascade from the grolwer purchased at Half Time. The nose was slight floral hops and fruity flavors with a little biscuity backdrop. The taste was malty, very full bodied and just a bit of hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall this was a beer I could easily quaff on a drizzley day such as this one, but not a mind blowing beer. Just solid, which is what a prominent beer like this should be."
"Mouthfeel is a bit oily and chewy. There's a definite murky quality to this brew. I found the mouthfeel to be a bit off overall here. That said, it's still a decent brew and shouldn't be something that should scare you away from it, it's just nothing to go out of your way for overall."
"A clean copper/amber beer. Has a big thick beige head, that makes some lace. There is a very light sweetness to the aroma that hints at malt. There is a light earthy maltiness with hints of roasty malt in the background in the flavor followed by a light hop snap on the finish."
"This beer poured up a deep amber color. I big tan head was generated but faded quickly and laced the glass. The nose is subtle and slightly sweet. The taste of mild caramel and is really smooth. Not much of an after taste. This is a nice beer from Anderson Valley. I would definetly recommend it. Better in cool weather."
"This beer is smooth and sits well in the mouth. Definite citrus in there, particularly orange but not syrupy sweet at all. Also, some nuttiness in there, too. The malt is kicks in just enough to keep it wet and smooth in your mouth. It slides down your throat easily and your mouth asks for more. It doesn't taste like a higher alcohol content but a few of these can go down quickly and start kicking in before you know it."
"A good example of the style, that also has its own personnality. Maybe not extremely drinkable, but definitely enjoyable."
"Poured with one finger of head into my pint glass. Dissipated to a thin ring. Minimal to no lacing. Average carbonation. Caramel taste that finishes in my mouth with low bitterness, very smooth to drink. Could drink a six pack of this in a sitting without even noticing. For the amber ale style, this is a very drinkable and smooth beer. Perfect example of why I should try more American Amber/Red Ales."
"Pours a translucent reddish brown with a yellowish white head. Strong malty aroma. Well balanced with a rich, malty front and just enough American hops to balance. There is some fruit flavor as well. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is simple and straightforward, but good. Highly drinkable. Good American amber ale. It reminded me a little of an altbier."
"I think this is a nice brew. I would hesitate big time in calling it an Amber Ale - what the hell is an Amber Ale anyway? But, it has a nice malt to hop profile and I enjoyed it."
"This amber is a nice session ale. Starts off with a tan head that stays around for most of the pint. The beer is amber with a lot of light flickering through. Smell is quite mild, with some biscuity notes poking through. Taste is very straight-forward. The malt profile is very simple and refreshing. Hops are quite thin, although I detected a bit of citrus in the middle. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but overall a great amber."
"Drinkability: Very. Much maltier, and certainly much milder than I expected, especially given the tastebud-scorching, enamel-peeling hop monster that is their Hop Ottin'. It's very drinkable, but aside from the terrific appearance, it's not especially compelling. For a session West Coast ale, I'd definitely look to Red Nectar or Sierra Nevada before this."
"Man, I love this beer."
"Tap@Edinborough Castle, San Fransisco. Im a big fan of anderson Valley. and this is a good amber. Nutty, with some the usual hit of NW hops, something i could imagine drinking a lot of in one session.Quite a nice amber ale, from a pretty good brewery!!!"
"A slightly above average beer. Pours a standard amber color, head is very light, but present throughout. Smell is malty, nothing unusual. Taste is unusual compared to most ambers that Ive had. Its light, but has a definite tang to it that feels odd. Almost sugary-sweet malt profile on the first sip, hops are secondary. A slightly metallic aftertaste. I probably wont try this one again."
"Still a decent amber."
"I had this on tap today, and the color was deep amber to mahogany. There was just a slight head, and little lace (this may be due to the fact that I was one of the 1st pours off the line). The aroma was of roasted malt, and a subtle sweetness that reminded me of caramel corn (Cracker Jack?). The taste had the malt (roasted and otherwise) up front. The hops show themselves in the middle and balance the sweetness, on the back of the taste is a yeasty bread flavor (wheat bread). Nice medium heavy mouth feel, and a wonderful drinkability, Brown ales are not my favorite, but this beer excels."
"All told, this is a drinkable amber but not what I was expecting from Anderson Valley."
"I'm not a session drinker but my reaction on finishing this amber ale was to wonder what the next one would taste like now that my tongue had adjusted to the flavors. Would the cold bring out the grapefruit hoppy flavors again or would my adjusted palette respond to the malt notes? Contrary to my first impressions, this is not a 'sweet' ale at all - it just has some very interesting notes that are so reminiscent of fruit that it gets remembered as sweet. I'm looking for my next bottle and may serve it at a warmer temperature to start with to see how that affects the flavors."
"Boont Amber Ale is another goodun' from Anderson Valley. While not stupendous, it is solid across the board and earns my seal of approval. Come to think of it, maybe those flaky floaters were boont."
"Pours a deep clear amber with a off white head that is feed by lots of rising bubbles. Smells of sweet malt and citrus hops a little light in aroma. Tastes of crystal malt you get the carmel flavor along with sweet malt with a touch of hop flavor with a light hop bite. Mouthfeel is medium a good drinkable little amber ale. Not one of the best but not a bad little sessions brew."
"Wyll-"
"An all around good beer. I like this one. An unexpected surprise from a brewery I had never heard of."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a slight malty scent with the presence of hops and fruity yeast. The taste is good. It has a smooth light caramel flavor that goes down smooth and finishes dry and a bit metallic. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with a bit too much carbonation. This is a decent amber ale. It says it's a gold medal winner, but I've had much better. It drinks well, but nothing special."
"Saw that this beer took home the silver at the GABF so I had to try it. The appearance is a dark amber color with a cream whipped cream colored head. The smell is of a homecoode banana bread, inviting and pleasant, hints of honey. Taste is of malts with honey tones, very full bodied, hints of herbal. A nice beer to have at dinner time."
"Medium-full bodied."
"I can't wait to go up to the brewry and have some ""Bahl Hornin'," as they say in Mendocino county (good drinking) Boont on draught."
"Haven't had one of these in years. Forgot what a great version of the style it is. Nothing over the top, just the right amount of the proper ingredients. Simplicity at its finest."
"12 oz bottle, no freshness dating. Pours dark almond and cloudy with some sediment. Malty nose. Leaves some lacing. Thin, creamy off white head. Nice malty brew, Hops come in late with a bit of a bite and some grainyness. Well balanced and smooth in the mouth. Notes of vanilla and caramel. Nicely crafted. Tasty quaffer."
"This brew is a hazy brown colored drink, with a small tan head on top. The scent is fruits and citrus. The taste has some citrus notes with a nice somewhat floral hop backbone. Dark fruit. Caramel malts, creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat sweet flavor, a nice amber ale."
"Something about AV beers that I really like --- it must be the type of hops they use because every brew is hoppy, citrusy, very west coast, but always silky smooth. I didn't like this as much as the ESB but it was similar and definitely a cut above most of the ambers/red ale's out there. Very nice... next time I'll buy a six instead of just a single."
"Picked this up at a little corner store in Atherton on a recent trip to the Bay area. It has a yellowish, off-white head that leaves tiny spots of lacing. The beer itself is a dark amber. Quite red, actually. Wow: serious caramel in the nose. And some nice, juicy hops. These hops mostly dominate the front. But they're not just a superficial bitterness... quite deep. Dark, caramel maltiness in the middle. Tangy hoppiness foreshadows a nice, bitter finish. Lots of nice, roasty grains, too. This is a great amber: lotsa caramel, lotsa roasty grains, lotsa hops. I really like it."
"Erm, anyway, nicely rounded out - the flavors (sweet to bitter) blend together very well and don't leave you with any unpleasant, off flavors. Very nice..."
"12 oz bottle pours a murky reddish orange color, with a long lasting tan head. Some sheets and rings of lace are left behind. Sweet caramel stands out in what is a subdued aroma. Floral and citrus hops struggle to get noticed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and surprising hop bite. Taste is sweet caramel all the way through, but with a solid hops presence of pine and citrus which provide a substantial bitterness. Well balanced overall. Finish is dry and bitter. The hops seem to overtake the caramel malt sweetness about halfway through the glass. There is also some earthiness to this one. I wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"Very drinkable. Not the best, but if you go to a bar and on tap this is a choice and the others are American Factory beers plus Fosters and Heineken PICK THIS FOR GODS SAKE!"
"This beer poured amber in color, as the name says. Smell is citrus and bitterness. Taste brings about more complexity than I would expect from an amber ale. Really floral at the front. A mix of oranges and flowers hits my tongue. The middle is slightly sweeter with some bread-like flavor and other nondescript sweetness coming in. The finish is bittersweet and dry and also quite crisp. Yeast and alcohol are noticeable here. This one is good, but seems to have too much going on. Not bad though."
"Drinkability: Not overpowering in any one specific area, this is a fantastic offering. AVBC done good with this one. I think I'll be picking up a few more of these."
"Notes: Pretty good red."
"Pours a deepp orange red with an off-white head. Subdued aromas of fruity malts, but mostly citrusy hops. Taste starts with slight fruity malts. Hops are bigger--tart grapefruitk, acidic, bitter finish, with lingering biscuity malt flavors. Not bad, but not great."
"Had this one on a recommendation from a friend and since I am not usually a big fan of Amber/Red Ales I was a bit skeptical. But I was very happy with this beer indeed. It poured a nice medium to light amber color with a thin white head that left lots of lace around the glass. The smell wasa mostly of sweet carmel and also had a bit of hops sneaking though. The flavor was more hoppy than I was expecting, but not overly hoppy by any means. The slight bitterness was quickly thwarted by wonderful malt and carmel flavors. This beer was very very smoothe and had a nice medium thick body to it that would enable me to drink many of these at a single setting. If you are looking for a great drinkable amber ale, this is a excelent choice"
"A pleasing carmelized malt flavor was dominant with this brew. Malt and hops combine very nicely to keep this brew somewhat refreshing but also slightly bitter as well. The finish was straight hop bitterness which was very nice. Pretty impressed with this Amber."
"A white creamy head topped off this garnet colored brew. This one looks great. A sweet fruity smell emanates from the beer, along with a pleasant maltiness. There are some cherries and oranges in there. The taste is slightly bitter, slightly fruity and finishes dry. This is a very flavorful and thin bodied beer. On the whole, I think this is a very well crafted and highly drinkable beer."
"A very nice amber ale, tilted toward the ""robust"" end of the spectrum. Complex toasted caramel malt flavors and a potent hop punch to ""kick it up a notch."" Sharp carbonation kept the beer lively throughout. As I was drinking it, I was struck with the impression that this is much like a light version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale."
"Nice amber (duh) appearance with decent head and lacing. Smell is both floral and malty. Taste is a slight bit on the bitter side, but balanced. Definite floral element. Mouthfeel was medium bodied but not overly smooth. Easy enough to drink. A decent offering."
"Appearance: Nice mellow amber with a cream colored head sitting atop forms nicely with full even rings of lacing. Aroma: Sweet caramel malt reaches out toward my olfactory nerves reeling me in closer to notice nice faint but present piney hops very nice. Taste: Perfect blend between the herbal, earthy, pine like hops with a the sweet rolling blend of caramel malt oh so nice and balanced a brew, doesn't beat out Troeg's Hopback but very good brew here. Mouthfeel is a medium body brew very smooth and decent carbonation perfect sensation of hops running down the palate as well. Drinkability: Amazing, buy a keg of this nectar and give it as a sacifice to the beer gods drinkable"
"I dunno about this beer I like it but I doubt i could pound em down...but still ""it's good drinking""..which is what the slang phrase means!"
"Sampled while in Yosemite National Park. A very nice looking semi-dark amber colored beer with a nice foamy head. The head leaves behind nice lacing on the glass and itself persists as a thin layer for some time. The aroma is very pleasant and primarily malty, with a hint of some fruity hops--an overall mild aroma. Tastes of caramelly malt with a bit of hops, again as with the aroma, the taste is very pleasant. I found this beer to be rather smooth and highly drinkable. A good beer and definitely one I would have again."
"The aroma of this one is definitely hoppy, with a floral expression. A deep red, clear, color and a light tan head. Lightly sweet to the taste, a very malty brew. The maltiness melds very well with the hop flavor. The hop flavor has light citrus notes to it, and it finishes with a nice hop bite. A very balanced brew, that has a fair amount of fruitiness to it (though this is not a strong flavor)."
"The flavors are predictable, but well executed as they deliver scorched milk, wild grasses and flowers before succumbing to a gritty, roasted starch edge on the finish. If it were more concentrated, it might not come off so well balanced, but as it stands, none of the flavors dominates."
"Drinkability: a little bit better than average. This beer really didn't stand out in my mind (or palate) as much above the norm for the style. Not much distinguished it from the rest. A decent brew overall."
"Poured a browned red copper color with not much head, and otherwise looked like a thin and watery beer. Smelled of caramel scented malt, very nice hoppy fruit scents, and a sweet roasted smell like bbq nuts. Taste was amazing spice as well as savory roast flavors, combined with an almost citric twang; too tangy though. A dry finish reinforced the burnt toast tartness. Regardless, a solid moderate malt in the middle. Went down well enough but had some thickness as Id think an amber should have. A caramel and zingy hops interpretation of the style."
"True to its name in its color - a true amber, with highlights of orange where the light hits. A thick beige frothy head sits atop, and just haaangs in there nicely. Smell is mostly citrus and pine, a bit of light sweet malt. Flavor is fresh and clean, biscuity upfront and finishing with an orange peel zest, with sweet malt creeping in from behind. Thick cables of lace line the glass. Mouthfeel is round and creamy. Moderate carbonation. Orange zest tingle and pine lines the mouth in aftertaste."
"Nice darker amber color with a good looking off white head. Nose is flowery hop with a touch of citrus maybe. Taste starts with an underlying malt, but has a sweet fruit flavor that takes over, finishes with a crisp hop bitterness, but still some sweetness. Body is medium. I dont know if I can fully appreciate ambers, but this is decent on tap."
"This beer had a large white head with small bubbles that was mostly diminishing. The lacing was good on the sides of my glass. The body was clear and the hue was copper. It had a moderate malty aroma and a light hoppy aroma. There was no carbonation observed with this brew. It had a light bitter flavor from start to finish and it had a medium mouthfeel to it. This was a fairly smooth drink, but I was not very impressed with it."
"For favorites of the amber this one might take some getting used to. For hop heads this ale is a great change when one wants something different."
"Clear, brilliant ruby forming a poofy beige head atop fine bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. This is a gorgeous beer. Aroma is of earthy hops, amber malts, and a suggestion of alcohol. The taste, unfortunately is exactly the same. Mouthfeel is medium soft, with a wet finish and moderate carbonation. If only it tasted as good as it looks."
"Medium brown copper color, medium head. Aroma is malty and a touch sweet. A medium bodied amber ale. Fairly malty, with a nice hop bite. Milder, smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice session beer."
"An appropriate bright amber body is topped by a big, rocky, frothy off-white head. Nose is a mix of herbal hops and some cereal grains. Taste is malty caramel and herbal, earthy hops, all in dead-on balance. Nice toasty quality throughout, and a fast jab of hop smack at the very end. Creamy smooth across the tongue. Too many amber ales are strictly middle-of-the-road. This one heads down the fast lane. Enjoy."
"Poured a deep amber color with nice creamy head that dissapated pretty quickly,a veryy hoppy aroma to this pretty floral with slight malt'grain background.Taste is a little sharp/hoppy to start with a little bread dough type flavor lingers in the end.Pretty well amber one of the better onse I have had in awhile."
"This beer pours a nearly perfect copper color with a voluminous, tan rocky head. The head slowly fades until a loose layer of foam lays atop the beer, which displays excellent clarity. A loose, sticky lacing clings to the glass as you quaff. The aroma is a bit of an earthy hop presence atop a light caramel note. Actually sort of unisnpiring after the perfect pour. The taste is pretty much a balanced malt and hop ale, with a bit more roastiness and just a hint of anise in the aftertaste. Good bittering on the finish, but just a little better than average overall. The mouthfeel is good, and displays the barely carbonated traditional ale feel. The drinkability is average. It goes down easy, but I don't find myslef reaching for this one as frequently as many other beers. Yet another average offering from a company who's labels inspire me more than their beer does."
"Brown ale to malty for you? Or are you moving from a deep brown habit to paler styles? Grab some of this brew. Highly recommended."
"A nice smooth brew with pretty light carbonation. The body is medium. There is a good amount of flavor. Rich malts lead the way with a nice hop presence that keeps it interesting. This is a good, but not great brew."
"""Where is Anderson Valley anyway?"""
"Nice amber color with a haze and creamy white head. Good floral hoppy aroma with a thin pasta-like background, very fresh and open. Excellent caramel malt flavor, and some light nut grainyness balanced in. Smooth feel, light-medium body with a very nice firm, slightly bitter finish. One good amber with great caramel and hops."
"Reddish amber color, slightly hazy, with a nicely creamy and clingy off white head. Inviting aromas of floral hops and freshly baked rolls. The aroma reminds me of boiling wort and steeping grains - good fresh beer smell. Great caramel malt flavor; honey and biscuit notes with some grain nuttiness. Mouth feel is light to med. with firm hop bittering and a slightly sour/ bitter finish. A highly drinkable Amber with a solid dose of hops."
"Coppery-red color with a foamy, off-white head with medium retension. Almost no aroma other than a mild hoppy spiciness. The flavor is very full with the same spiciness from the aroma. A soft malt presence on the forefront with a nice bite at the finish. A little expensive but besides that, a pretty decent beer."
"Aroma is soft, citrusy, but mild. Good hops, good bite and texture, adequate malt, light body, very smooth and easy to drink. Some dischord in the finish. Altogether fine, but not memorable."
"Probably the most widely available from a high quality micro brewery located in rural Mendocino County, CA."
"Cloudy carmel colored ale. Aroma doesn't appeal to me too much. Nothing stands out of the aroma that screams ""DRINK ME!"" The taste isn't much better than the aroma. Sort of bland. No huge hopiness, no huge maltiness...Reminds a lot of an English style ale. I probably won't get this one again."
"Backwash: I would look to an Anchor Steam or Youngs Dirty Dicks as better interpretations of similarly-styled beers."
"Deep amber is the color on the pour with the head plentiful and the lace thick glutinous sheets to coat the glass. Mostly malt in the nose, crisp and fresh with the start quite sweet. Top is lean in its feel with the finish crisply acidic in its bite and the hops apropos to the style, aftertaste dry and long lasting. Quaffable and a beer you could enjoy daily as it is tasty and well brewed."
"The beer pours a delicious amber/honey color with an off-white head and medium head retention. Scents of caramel malt, pine, and a ""roasty", earthy aroma. Crisp hops and oily/silky mouthfeel give way to a charming malt sweetness. Sweet notes of toffee and fruit balanced by piney, yeasty hops. The classic west coast hops element is there but in a very subtle, understated way. The caramel malt and earthy notes are beautifully balanced by the crisp, clean hops without either won ever seeming to dominate. A very smooth and drinkable beer, but at the same time a beer with alot of character and charm."
"Fairly good Amber, it actually seemed borderline Vienna to me. Sweet caramel malt aroma with a medium sand colored head that disappeared rather quickly. High ratio of malt to hops in the flavor which gave it some good body. This is definitely a solid, well-balanced Amber and I wouldn't mind getting it again."
"Poured well - nice head. Supreme deep orangey-copper-amber color, looks great and healthy. Both malt and hops in the nose, but neither overwhelming. Lovely balance of caramel malt, hops and a lovely fruitiness that adds drinkability to this beer - like an engine adds movement to a car. Some light sweetness at first that makes way for a light malt, bitter dry finish. Solid mouthfeel, that leaves a light mouth puckering begging to be quelled by the next mouthful of beer, making this a very drinkable beer. This is now the 4th, or 5th, beer that I have had from Anderson Valley, and they are quickly developing great respect from me, for the excellent high quality range of beers they produce. They seem to do no wrong. No wonder these beers win awards, they must be truly brewed by a Drinker."
"Deep amber coloring; no head due to the way the bartender poured it. Aromas of caramel malts and citrusy hops. Those aromas are reflected in the taste, which features an outstanding balance of caramel/brown sugary malts and grapefruity hops. Has to be one of the top American amber ales."
"Nice deep copper color with some tinges of orange refracting here and there.  A thin sticky off-white head tops of this beauty.  Retention is adequate.  Deep caramel malt aroma.  Also some nuttiness, roastiness and grain.  Nice nose on this one.  The taste consists of a primary element (sweet caramel malt) and some secondary elements (toasted malt, spicy grain and some hops to balance the nice malt load).  The mouthfell is smooth and creamy and lightly carbonated, making this one easily drinkable beer.  Very nice amber."
"I have had this beer on both tap and in the bottle.  This review is of the bottle since I had it more recently.  I love AVBC, so what is there not to love about this one.  Just the right balance of fuit of bitterness on this ale.  It's not overpowering at all, but has enough assertivness to make it stand out.  I think a great summer beer to drink by the grill."
"Handsome reddish amber color with full, delicate head. Wonderful malty caramel aroma with light hop spiciness and flowers. Quite tasty, although slightly lacking in complexity in the mouth, draws out to an excellent crisp finish. Well balanced for the most part; strong attack based on the terrific aroma, the middle is a bit bland, but the finish evens it out. Maybe more hops right off the bat? Mouthfeel a little watery for such a malty, sticky tasting brew. Warming and filling, I like this very much."
"Deep and clear ""brown sugar"" amber color. Head settles at 1/4 of an inch with a yellow ochre color. Pronounced sweet aroma, pretty dense. Nice and spicy malt flavor, impressive medium body. The hop tang is also very good and balances the taste in an admirable way. Maltier than I expected. Very well done, the Anderson Valley brewmasters scored on this one with free throws to follow. Lots of flavor and mouthfeel for the style."
"Deep amber color, with solid head. lacing is above average.  A little smoother than other domestics of this type. I found it has a very long malty finish, that is balanced nicely by moderate bitterness. Anderson Valley's best seller. Great with pasta dishes.  Fine beer but I overated it originally. Not as popular with me as other AVBC brews"
"Notes: Good fruity / hoppy mix, the malt character cradles the complexities perfectly. A little hefty and very flavourful … this beer shows again that AVBC knows craft beer. 5.8% abv."
