"Not a big fan of reds so I'm trying not to be biased. Bottle date was a while back and the hops I'm sure have faded quite a bit. Nice body but just too sweet."
"Hoppy red ale (IPA) with malty sweetness and a bitter finish...reminds me of Arrogant  Bastard Ale"

"On tap at Beachwood BBQ and poured into half size ale glass. Appearance is copper-orange with foamy head that settles, but leaves the glass coated with lace. Big balanced aromas split between herbal and citrus hops and toffee malts, plus a little dankness. Taste is early butterscotch and brown sugar sweetness mixed with orange peel bitterness and alcohol esters warm on the swallow. Medium-full bodied with a creamy and thick mouthfeel, the carbonation is low and soft."
"Beautiful draft pour into a tulip glass with a nice head, good retention and lacing.  Smelled very nice with a good combination of sweet and hoppy with a bit of the alcohol coming through.  Taste was very similar.  Quite delicious but with the alcohol breaking through.  Great beer for sitting down in front of the fire on a cold winter night."

"Deep brown with a reddish hue to it. A woody kind of color with a very pleasing looking soapy foam tan head and clingy sheety lace. Aroma is just the right amount of sweet; Caramel encrusted graham crackers, cinnamon and nutmeg. Festive aromas for sure... Flavor is a bit more serious than the smell. By that I mean its more direct. Sweet and spicy but also assertive. The high ABV is not completely hidden and reminds you that you are in fact celebrating the holidays. There's a nice fresh pile of malt under the hops and seasonings but this beer doesn't take on a heavy character at all. It's apparently strong but light and swirly in flavors. Flavors include grapefruit pulp, coniferous vegetation, nutmeg, cinnamon, honey graham crackers, and perhaps a dusting of molasses. Very pleasant drinkins... Mouthfeel is soft around the edges...smooth, finely carbonated, easy and delightful to consume."
"Deep, hazy rust color topped with a densely creamy head that deposits a good amount of lacing on the glass and never quite fully disappears.  Despite being obviously hopped up, the first thing that strikes me about the aroma is a lovely graham cracker crust, brown sugar, and cake that contributes a certain warm ""holiday festiveness"" to the brew.  Pine needles, woody spice, and grapefruit.  Flavor is big and hoppy, but nicely balanced.  Spicy pine resin, citrus, floral hops, toasted bread, black tea, and cake.  Rich, but the solid wall of hop bitterness keeps things in balance and thus, surprisingly drinkable for 9.5%.  Not all that boozy either, though a warmth grows in the throat.  Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Seems to fit the season well."

"O: After so many dark and spiced seasonal beers this is a much appreciated change of pace. Just what I would expect for Xmas in San Diego. Love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Great beer for fall/winter. Would be great to drink on a cold evening while watching it snow. Too bad I like in SoCal...."

"If you like malty and alcoholic brews it is a good choice for you."

"I was rooting around in the cellar and found one of these from 2010. Alesmith website says it doesn't improve with age so I popped it open right away. Poured into a tulip glass. 3 fingers fluffy head on top of brown slightly transparent body.  Aromas of spice apricot peach and heavy malt. Tasted of heavy booze like it was BBA, but deceiving since it's only 8%. Very malty, with fruit subtones. Very smooth!  Overall, I don't think it improved with age, but 4 years didn't make it any worse. Still the same old awesomeness from Alesmith. Cheers!"
"Overall:  Iâ€™m not a fan of this beer, really, as it is way too hoppy for me.  The hoppy bitterness totally overpowers all of the other flavors of the beer.  Sorry AleSmith, this beer is not for me.  Hop heads should love it though!"
""
""
"O-This was one of my ISO after I had their IPA and they didn't disappoint me. I must try more of their brews especially speedway."

"Overall, this is genuinely cracking stuff, and I guess I'd expect no less from AleSmith. It's fragrant and bright, but with depth and gravitas. A really well-crafted beer."
""

""

"Overall: It's the balanced play with strong malty backbone and fruity hops that does it - brings out the fresh succulent flavor and feeling. Not too complex, but rich enough to enjoy throughout. Well done."

"Overall, an amazing well balanced DIPA with sweet caramel malt, fruit and a ton of piney hops."
""
""
"Rich, creamy head, close to three fingers, tan in color with an orange tint, for as fluffy as it is has wonderful retention and the lacing is strong too, long, thick streaks form every time the glass is turned. Dark, if clear, amber red color, kind of has a metallic sheen to it, not quite beads but lots of large, healthy bubbles swirling upwards inside the glass. Excellent balance between malts and hops in the nose, cocoa, hard coffee candy and malted milk balls interplay with sweet pink grapefruit, pine sap, lemongrass and a pinch of white pepper, basic apricot, peach to pineapple fruit yet restrained, as it gets warmer the damp herbal matter element becomes more pronounced. Full-bodied, the buoyant carbonation frames the attack and makes it less blockish and more apt to settle gently on the tongue. While the texture is dry and after 4-5 sips you start to feel a tacky residue building up, the flavors are all ripe sweetness, especially that pink grapefruit to tangelo citrus. Floral, piney, sweet and sour enough to play up papaya and pineapple over the apricot and peach. Some biscuit notes among the caramel and molasses, as in the nose saves the more bitter or leafy herbaceousness for last. Given the multitude of things going on, stays balanced and integrated and, even better, highly drinkable."

"I am pretty confident AleSmith does not make a single bad beer but they sure have the Reds nailed down between this and Evil Dead/Bloody Valentine."
""
"While this is exactly what the brewers wanted to make, it is just a bit to big for me. Really not bad for what it is, just the large bitterness mixed with the big burnt sugary character are not really for me. I want something a bit cleaner, for me to drink this more often. Still, at least worth a try."
""
"love this beer. Alesmith's under-the-radar expertise is their red ales- Yulesmith, Evil Dead Red, and Bloody Valentine- I love how they blend hops and caramel malts"

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/8/2013. Pours lightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, pine, grass, and floral/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and dark malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, orange zest/ring, tangerine, pineapple, caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and well balanced hop and dark malt flavors; with a moderately crisp bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red! All around awesome balance and complexity of hop and dark malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

""
""
"Overall: YuleSmith Winter is a fantastic beer, with a perfect balance between the malt and hops. There is absolutely no trace of alcohol, making this one dangerous drink for a hot South African Christmas!"
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Has a bit of a sticky mouthfeel, and is somewhat oily and resinous. Has a grapefruit and caramel aftertaste. The alcohol is well hidden. Another very nice beer from AleSmith."
""
""
""
""
""
"O) Excellent balance... I rank this right there with my favorite imperial red ales. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very solid imperial Red Ale. Big oily mix of earthy hops with a big sweet malt presence."
"there's a lot of red ink on a brown bottle. I can't read it. On the bottom, above the web address it says: ""Serve in a pint at 50-55 degrees."" I think the temperature is okay, but is a ""pint"" really what you want to recommend? Whatever, I did it in a ""tulip."" So sorry."

"A simplistic but well crafted hoppy red ale. I would love more dimensions thrown in in either the malt or hops, malt is equally balanced with the hops so there isn't much that can be done about the rising alcohol. A nice beer but far from the best this brewery can offer."
"M: Medium bodied. Big flavor burst."
""
""
"Deep red brown, crystal clear with about a finger's width of light tan head, settles quickly, nice lacing. Absolutely gorgeous Earthy hop aroma, slightly piney with a hint of malt and biscuit as it warms. Flavor is nicely balanced, strongly bitter with significant sweet malt and brown sugar to offset it, balance doesn't shift much as it warms. Subtle hints of orange peel and pine. Mouthfeel is thicker than I'd expect from 8.5%, bordering on what I'd expect from an Imperial Red. Overall very nice effort: hoppy but not too hoppy, very attractive appearance."

"Buy again? Most definately!"
""
""
""
"Overall - Really good, full flavored, but not quite what id call a red ale. Sure I get the hops but with the roasty malts and alcohol, the beer seems closer to a barleywine to me. Still, really tasty and great to drink."
""
"O - YuleSmith isn't brewed with spices or special yeast like most holiday beers, rather, AleSmith got creative and used American hop varieties that introduce overtones of pine and earthy characteristics which, in conjunction with the toasted amber and sweet caramel malts, make for a seasonally enjoyable amber ale!"
""
""
""
"Kind of like your fallback after your ""fallback"" doesn't pick up. Yeah, I'll drive over at midnight, but I'm not exactly stoked."
""
""
""
"O - very good imperial red, definitely one to throw in the winter rotation with SN Celebration, GL Christmas, and lakefront Holiday Spice"
""
""

"Overall nothing jaw dropping, but still a solid beer, well done."

"This pours a dark amber color with a foamy beige head. The aroma is full of fresh hops. The taste is amazing with a bold yet not overpowering taste of hops and hidden citrus. It finishes with a lingering malt and dry hop after taste. A very well made double IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts off with bready biscuit notes followed by some mild hints of caramel sweetness that balance the brew out. Then the hop grassyness and piney notes come in. Well balanced and not too intense. A perfect balance of piney, resinous and dank hops with some amazing rich caramel malt notes. The body in this brew is great. Medium-light body with nice sticky notes. Overall this brew is delicious. One of the better Imperial Reds out there. The balance between yummy caramel malts and the resinous and dank pine hops is pretty amazing."
"O: a very nice seasonal offering - reminiscent of Celebration ale but with a stronger malt bill and higher gravity. Classic seasonal/winter warmer-kinda flavors. No reason not to check this out."
"D - tasty, hoppy red ale. Had this in 07 and don't remember it being this hoppy. Must have been an older bottle. Definitely drink this one fresh."
"Review #3400"

"This is a pretty solid offering from AleSmith. It's not too flashy and it's pretty traditional for a hopped up red ale. It's fitting for the cold weather. It was nice to revisit this one."

"o: I love it when a gamble pays off! This is a tasty brew, wonderful for the holidays or anytime. Having it now as a summer refresher and it works for that!"
""
""
""
""
"O - It has kind of taken on the characteristics of a barleywine. The hops have faded, but are fighting to keep a counterbalance to the sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: this exceptional beer may be as good as Imperial Reds get."
"O: Pretty good. A nice little holiday piece. I normally don't like black licorice, but it worked well in this beer. Recommended."
""

"D - Good hoppy red ale. Good hop profile and bitterness."

"Overall â€“ A good seasonally flavoured beer. A little too earthy for me but still nice nonetheless. Just a bit overpriced for what you get in my opinion. Nice to have tried but not something I'd buy again."
""
""
"Awesome stuff here. My first from Alesmith and a gem of a brew. Makes me think of Nugget Nectar. Cant wait to try more from them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is pretty good. Sort of disappointed. Mine tastes like its old and the hops have faded away. Which I don't see being possible because this is a winter brew and its the heart of winter. Regardless, this beer is well made and not too shabby."
""
""
""

"Deep ruby red in color with an orangish hue and good clarity. Poured with a huge, dense off-white foam with excellent staying power that left random sticky lacings on the glass. Fresh, pungent, citrus and ripe grapfruit hop aromas with intense, sugary sweet caramel malt beneath. Light, fresh pine hop aromas float overtop. Medium bodied with a thick oily feel underneath the rich, tight carbonation. A fabulous balance of pungent hops and sweet, sticky caramel malt. The balance of these intense flavors is the beauty of these beer."
""
"Overall: A beer that is almost if not an imperial IPA. Has every quality of it that makes this beer a true gem. Not only does it improve with every sip it becomes more addicting. I thank a very special person for this brew and you should be thanking yourself just for having it. Salud!"
"Mouthfeel is decent- medium to fuller bodied, moderate carbonation, as I mentioned above pretty resiny but smoothes out as it warms. I would definitely recommend drinking this one closer to room temperature. Good hoppy amber beer."

"a bold winter beer, possibly my favorite of the season so far. pours rich red in color, and appears to be an irish red all the way. huge lacey tan head and a nose of clove and nutmeg, dry red malt, alcohol, and a majorly aggressive hopping. i taste hops first, and i taste hops last. this might as well be a red ipa rather than a holiday beer, because to me this is very very hoppy for a christmas brew, which i appreciate greatly. the spice doesnt come in until the end, and is relaxed compared to so many winter warmers and the like. the spice also seems to be tamed by the addition of something a little sweet, vanilla, brown sugar, maybe some belgian candy sugar in small dose. it really rounds out the beer nicely, and are nice materials over the red malt foundation. theres a nice full body, enough bubbles, and a warming alcohol sting. a nice bomber to share, or to drink alone on a cold winters night. i enjoyed this as much as any winter seasonal this year."
""
""
"I'll definitly will not hesitate for the summer version."
""
""
""
""
"O- a desert beer no doubt. Good Carmel flavor that I really enjoyed. Give this some citrus hop flavors and it would be wicked!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall certainly a beer that would be great paired with a meal. Has the malt and body to combine with meats and cheeses but also a pleasant hop that makes it very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall: a tasty and interesting amber ale, this could probably be better classified as a strong ale. Still, pretty tasty and, while not particularly smooth, is surprisingly drinkable for a beer clocking in at near 10% alcohol."
"more citrus."

""

"O: Great beer, for sure, but my heart is still with Nugget Nectar."
""
"All around just an excellent beer. Have another bottle I'm saving for it's namesake holiday."
"Overall one real great tasting amber. I would love to have this every Christmas."
"This is a great hoppy beer. The alcohol isn't even noticeable. A great winter beer for the hop head."
"O: a very good holidday brew, great flavors without getting to fancy and overdoing it with added spices and such. good balance of hops"
""
"The summer Yuletide is one of my favorites and now this one joins the ranks. Perfect hop head choice for the colder season. Would def get again and adds to the respect for Alesmith"
"O: Good."
""
"overall: very nice winter seasonal"
""
""
"Overall a big but well-balanced DIPA. A little more caramelly than I generally like, but still a tasty winter beer."
""
"Pours a clear classic amber with a light taupe head. Aromas of caramel and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy. Sweet caramel cut by the tart (sweet) grapefruit. Perhaps a little eggplant. This is an amazing beer. Despite very limited cooler space, I took a bottle home."
"Very good red ale here. Highly hopped, setting it apart. Recommended. Thanks for the share kawilliams81."
"Pours a hazy dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some herbal and dank hop aromas. Taste is much the same with an alcohol kick and medium hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that strong and quite dank."
""
""
"O- very nice imperial red. Has enough citrus and sweetness to balance to bitterness. Glad I have 1 more bottle!"
"M/O - Medium body that is very well carbonated. The aftertaste doesn't last long and is mostly alpha acid bittering and some malt, finishes semi-dry on the palate. Overall this beer is wonderful, one of the best amber/red ales IMO. If you can find it fresh, drink it and drink it often! The only gripe I have is that it comes out too early to be a ""holiday"" ale."
""
""
"so confused..."
""
"Overall. I was all ""Okay, old hoppy beer..."". I know people say this ages nice, but man, this was amazing tasting. I fucking love it when a beer blows me away like this!!"

"I'd call it an American Strong Ale. It has more Barleywine flavors, and it's too good to be any kind of a Red Ale. A classic Christmas beer, whatever the style. From the 22 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent beer, but it drinks like an American Barleywine, not an amber/red."
"DOA"
""
"O: A solid beer. it tastes kind of familiar but in a good way."
"2010 bottle sampled in late 2011. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a deep, somewhat murky red brown amber. Thin off-white head leaves a little lacing. Aroma is herbal hops, caramel malt, some citrus. Flavor follows, with citrus and piney hops, sweet and caramel malt. Alcohol is quite noticeable. The hops are somewhat muted, perhaps because this is six month old bottle. Medium to heavy bodied and creamy. Nicely made, but the hops seem tired and aged. Worth checking a newer bottle."
"Strong malt flavor upfront--lots of crystal. Is there such a thing as semi-sweet caramel? That's what the initial taste is to me: little sweetness, but still some buttery flavors. The swallow features the hop, lightly bitter. There is a unique balance of caramel and pepper in the aftertaste. The body is rich and slightly oily from the high alcohol content."
""
""
""
""
"I was initially dissappointed to see that I'd traded for the 2010 version but this turned out to be mighty nice indeed. Smooth and highly drinkable. The 8.5% abv is only barely noticable. I'd planned to drink half tonight & finish tomorrow but it was too good to stop drinking! If it's this good 14 months old, I'm sure the hop character in a fresh bottle would be absolutely phenominal. This is my second experience with Alesmith (the other being Speedway Stout) and I am thouroughly impressed. This comes highly reccomended & I hope to get my hands on more Alesmith brews in the future. Anyone out there want to send some to Georgia?.."
""
""
""
"O: This tasted like a Barleywine brewed with cherries. I really need to get my hands on another bottle, just great and everyone who is a fan of Barleywine's should give this a try."
"O: A nice beer on a cold day but not something that I would put in my regular rotation of favorites. Pleasant but not fantastic..."
""

"O - A good warming beer."

"Overall, a very nice beer, I just wish the hoppiness and citrus notes in the nose translated over to the taste a but better. That is a bit of a nit pick though, this is very solid."

"This was a very good beer, there was so much flavor and very nicely balanced. I didn't take much effort for me to finish of this bomber."

"This is a creamy, highly hopped brew that goes down smooth and warm. A very nice Christmas fireside beer!"

"No real gimmicks here for a Holiday ale, just a very well crafted and big amber ale."

"Overall (4.5): I was not let down by this one. Perfectly hoppy with a great caramel backbone. I will seek this one out again."

"Very balanced and tasty. Big malt, big hops, and a good dose of booze that stays pretty well hidden."
"O: One of the better red ales I have ever had AleSmith did an amazing job. I definitely recommend this beer."

"Overall: Real nice imperial red and the cask really brought out the hops nicely"

"O - Quite the interesting brew that sits on the bitter side of an Imperial Amber style. I like it but find myself thinking that if I want an Imperial Stout, I'll have that; or if I want an Imperial IPA, I'll have that. This sits between the two in a way I've not experienced before. Perhaps as I become more familiar with this style, I'll appreciate this brew even more."
"Overall - A spectacular beer. I really wish they made this in a six-pack, I find it hard to justify paying this much for a bomber of a beer more than once or twice, which is a pity, because this is a truly delicious beer."
"Very good beer that brings me back every year."
"Big ale. I let this warm a bit out of the fridge. Then poured it with a large, thick, fluffy, foamy, textured, cream colored, fairly long lasting head and some lace. Color is a hazy apricot red. Aroma is hops, malt, raisins, prunes, caramel. Flavor is very similar to nose with bittersweetness on top with other qualities below. Great body and carbonation. Finish is resiny and long. Well done, but too much for me."
"Kudos as usual to Alesmith for producing a solid example of the style. Well formed malt backbone that offers up a varied toasted character and plenty of hops to lend balance and keep me back for another sip. No problems finishing the bomber on my own and wouldn't have issues grabbing another to follow."
"Dr: Drinkable for the high ABV, though alcohol does unfortunately come through. I'd like to try it on draught. It does lack a clear focus, but I enjoy drinking it."
"Some beautiful spicy hops with chocolate notes in the nose. Taste is again very spicy hops, and it also has a heat-like character that is striking and a little undesirable for me. A large malt-backbone. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy, I'm much happier to be nursing a bottle of this than many things I could've bought but don't think it stands up to yulesmith summer or any truly great ambers."
"Overall: A solid hoppy Red Ale from Alesmith, though at $9 a bottle I don't think I'll revisit this format."
"Overall this beer kicks ass. I enjoyed the summer yulesmith but this one is just a lot better tasting and not as boozy. Mucho recommendo!"
"O/D-This beer is pretty damn good. I love the style. I would have originally said that I like Yulesmith Summer better than this, but I found this summer's batch to be far less extraordinary than previous years. This being my first Yulesmith Winter, I must say I am quite impressed. Hoppy and delicious."
"O: Good, but the aroma, taste, and hop profile are somewhat one dimensional. I thought the summer Yulesmith was incredible, so this was a bit of a letdown."
"O - This was a fairly interesting beer. Was a bit more than a typical amber/red ale. A definate winter ale cross over, this was fairly tasty beer. Like the hop and malt profile on this one."
"O - Overall this is a great style! Go Imperial Red IPA's! I am actually brewing one right now, so this was interesting. More a hop forward brew, but somehow it got balanced out with malts. Great sipper and would be great for the holidays. Will buy more. Bought fresh straight from the brewery!"
"A good take on a red ale, good flavors coming from all sides with exceptional balance. I like the Summer Yulesmith a little better I think but a nice beer to look forward to each year."
"This brew poured out as a really nice looking clear red color with a white fizzy head on top. The retention wasn't too bad and neither was the lacing. T found the aroma of this beer to be really nicely hopped and has no elements of being a winter ale at all. The taste of this brew was a little bit like a Nugget Nectar in my opinion. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and had a light oily feel to it. Overall this brew was good but I like the Summer version much more."
"Deuce to bottle. New arrival (Winter, 2011) at Dutch's, the best spot in Cincinnati. Smell is good. Reminds me of 90 Minute. Tastes good too. It doesn't redefine its genre, but at the same time, it's unique, and one I'll seek out when 'tis the season. Mouthfeel is probably its best attribute. Surprisingly drinkable for 8.5%. Overall, a good beer that will do great with limited release - I'll buy it occasionally, as opposed to never if it was available all of the time."
"As a Red/Amber ale this one shines but I can see this one being tough to have a lot of. Works well as a winter warmer as it's a nice big meal of a beer that makes you not mind being holed up in a warm house on a cold night."
"Really solid winter beer. They did not spare any hops on this one. Amber/red color with medium carbonation. Nice aroma of big citrusy hops, maybe some pineapple notes, with caramel malt and maybe some spice. Complex flavor profile with spices, citrus and pine, spices, sweet malt, and bitter hops. Fairly full palate. Excellent."
"[2006 Winter] This is a very nice, high-quality beer. It tastes fairly similar to Arrogant Bastard; it's appearance is a little cloudier and more orange (less red) than Arrogant Bastard, though. It is malty, hoppy, a little nutty, and slightly spicy. The aroma is quite strong--stronger than the taste. The head was very thick and lasted forever. At 8.5%, one bottle (22 oz.) leaves you feeling perfectly buzzed without being really drunk. I will look forward to this every holiday season from now on. Enjoy it if you can find it."
"O - Nice beer, not my favorite style but this is well done and entirely drinkable."
"O: I like the fresh Winter Yulesmith a lot, but the aged version is working well here. If you like aged American Barleywines, you will love it at this stage. Having had it fresh enough I can tell you it works great fresh as well. A beer that's been creeping up in price, gone up from around $4.50 to $8 in the few years I've been drinking it. Nevertheless it's a Christmas classic, and I plan to buy it every year."
"O - Solid red ale (which I originally thought was a DIPA) but a bit too malty for my liking. One bomber was plenty for me as this beer drinks closer to 10% ABV rather than the 8.5% as indicated on the bottle. At $17.50 a bomber in Philly I feel this is overpriced. Guess I was expecting a bit more from a top tier brewery with a premium price such as Alesmith."
"O - A good Amber Ale, I wish I could try this a touch fresher. Still tasty, though."
"A tasty, somewhat bitter and piney amber ale. A wonderful holiday treat."
"O - Packed the the rim with lots of hop flavour but well balanced by yummy malt character without being cloying. A very tasty beer indeed. A treat indeed given its high alcohol and general unavailability here in Australia."
"a pretty good late to be had beer. i can see that bottle was older than it should have been with the sediment clusters at the bottle. pour is red amber darkness. nose of toffee... palate of toffee predominately. the nose has some bitterness hints of tobacco earthiness with a hint of it expanding in the palate as a earthy brown sugar sweet then over ripened apple then gritty husk dryness. not a beer to be had in the heat. a bit to syrupy at this point."
"Such a lovely piney hops aroma that has me thinking about how perfect this is at Christmas. Also getting some caramel malts in the aroma. Overwhelming hoppy pine flavor that seems to be a perfect combination of hops and malt. Hints of nutmeg - is that just because it's Christmas Eve? Every sip has me wanting more! Highly recommended!"
"With a gentle pour this brew definately looks impressive it pours a dark murky orange,amber hue that leaves behind a frothy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of lacing everywhere,the smell is straight out hops and lots of them with aromas of honeycomb,stonefruit and toffee aswell,it has a nice medium bodied well carbonated mouthfeel which coats the mouth with tastes of sticky date pudding,brown sugar,toffee,stonefruit and finished with a nice dry hit of sticky,piney,resiny hops and a touch of warmth and overall this is my type of holiday brew no spices,no gimmicks just straight out hops and malts and lots of them definately a good gift for xmas or anytime of year."
"The pour was very big. Lots of dark orange colors swirling about and a good sized head of white reaching up and over the top to around two inches before settling back down again. Really nice layered look to the sides of the glass as it was thoroughly coated all the way down, really good retention here I have to say. Lots of malt in the nose right off. Caramel, sweet notes mixing with a very big hop note, especially as it warms. Piney with a sweet orange rind like citrus touch as it comes close to room temperature. Very thick feel, sticky and full with nice carbonation, definite enough to get it done. Initially you get the piney hop bite as you take the first sip, but it became very well balanced mid palate as the rich, almost scotch ale like buttery notes start to come through and really give it quite a smooth flavor. A bit hot still and a definite big one, it hurts the session ability of it a touch, and by the end you are really pushing it with this one."
"D- This was a good brew. I could see looking to somehow score this again around the holidays."
"O: How is this not a barleywine?! Whatever you call it, I like it. Malty and complex in all the right was but very easy to drink."
"A bit high on the carbonation up front. Balanced middle with some alcohol showing. Medium bitterness on the back with an earth/leathery finish. Medium, maybe with a lean toward light, body."
"M/D: Medium bodied with a slightly thicker mouthfeel. No alcohol presence, but left my mouth slightly dry. A solid beer, I do like Summer better, but thats probably because I prefer hoppy beers."
"Acquired through trade. Poured from bomber (2010 brew) into dimpled mug. Pours dark mahogany with two fingers of beige head on top; it was short lived however, and lacing was nonexistent throughout the session unlike it's summer version. Aroma is not as big as the taste suggests, however, nose is caramel, floral, citrus, hops, malt, and light spices. Taste picks up some mildly biter hops, a variety of spices, roasted malts, and a sweet caramel blend. Medium bodied with some dryness. Decent carbonation throughout. When comparing against the summer version, this brew is maltier and darker in color, but not necessarily better overall in taste, per se. This brew also does not fit the ""winter concept"" for me, but it was a very nice Imperial Red Ale regardless!"
"I'm glad that I had the opportunity to try this beer but I'm not sure I'll trade for it again... Unremarkable brew from an otherwise outstanding brewery..."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is low. Overall, this is too sweet and the alcohol is overpowering. Combine this with how bad the beer looks, and I will not be seeking again. Skal."
"D: The ale doesn't taste is a 9.5% beer. The heaviness is hidden behind the caramel malts. I prefer the fresh zing of the summer version, but this one does alright."
"Mouthfeel is fine, as it isn't too thin and is full-bodied enough to bring out all the flavors involved. Carbonation is well done too, not too strong and not too weak. Drinkability is directly linked to taste in a lot of cases, and here it suffers due to the lack of balance. The abv of 8.5% is masked well, but there is no denying the fact this beer is tough to down sip after sip."
"4.0 D: Like the 09, but a bit more drinkable due to the mellowing out."
"A very fine holiday ale to have around the Christmas season."
"D: This is a nice ale that I would drink again, only if they would release a 2011 summer version."
"D - Nice balanced beer, appearance wasn't too appealing but it did keep a nice head from the pour, fairly strong tastes - full bomber would be enough as it was pretty decent in ABV. $6.99 a bomber from BevMo..."
"While it didn't knock my socks off like the Summer version, it's still a decent beer. The citrus/pine hops flavor paired with the malts produces a nice winter brew. I probably won't seek it out again, but I'm glad I got to try it."
"Other than the looks, this beer is amazingly complex and tasty with perfect balance between malts and hops."
"I'm wondering if this bottle had something wrong with it, but seeing as how it recently showed up on my beer store's shelves I can only assume it was produced for this Christmas season. I am drinking it about a month after Christmas... but that doesn't seem long enough for this beer to go so bad. I did send one of these out as a trade extra a bit recently, before I actually gave it a try... hope he was able to enjoy it more than I did."
"Complex mouthfeel, really as a lot going on. Overall I'd have to say full bodied. Rich, big, thick, and I'd even say a little chewy. It's got a bitter finish, could be a little more clean. Overall just really big. The drinkability is really good, a nice long sipper. Been nursing the bottle for about an hour and a half now. This is the 2nd time I've tried this beer and the first AleSmith beer I've had. Needless to say, I'll be back for more."
"Overall, a decent Imperial amber ale. It's very enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. Worth a try or the price tag, eh, probably not considering how forgettable it is. The Summer YuleSmith is exponentially better if you ask me."
"A truly outstanding brew...I can't wait to try the summer version."
"Appearance is fairly spectacular with a murky, rusty copper color with a massive frothy light tan head that never quite fades away and leaves abundant clumps of sticky lacing. Some pretty intense chunks of sediment knock this down half a point however. Aroma is extremely sweet and malt forward, toasty and caramel, with mild citrus hops. Flavor is a little less sweet than the nose, more bready and toast with some brown sugar and caramel. Citrus-y hops are present in the finish with just enough bitterness to resign in the malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little thin, at least carbonation wise and ends with a slightly thin finish. Regardless, a very enjoyable winter beer, but just makes me want fresh Nugget Nectar."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark brown giving way to lighter brown edging. A yellowish to off white head is present. This beer smells very sweet, like candy. I don't get that much bitterness but lots of malt. It tastes about the same. Very sweet malt, lots of caramel and some sugared dates. Not sure what the end design was but I expected more hoppiness. It is ok just very malty and sticky mouthfeel. I would have this one again, just not my favourite."
"d- really nice, i like this better than the yulesmith summer actually. goes down easy, no trace of strength here. well hopped and smooth. can't go wrong with alesmith."
"Recommended."
"A fresher version of this beer is worthy of an A, but this vintage, while not bad, definitely shows the signs of age. Still pretty damn good ."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ yellow color with aan off-white head. Aromas of a citrusy, grapefruity hop. In the taste, big grapefruity hops and a great balance of malt in taste as well. A bittersweet mouthfeel and a sticky sweet grapefruity hop aftertaste. A great double IPA, big hops and balanced. This is one of the better beers I have had in a while."
"Overall a great red ale one of the best red ales I have had."
"Great flavors and mouthfeel overall, but the high alcohol content and aftertaste takes away from the overall drinkability, in my opinion. Still a beer that I would highly recommend trying. SOLID."
"I feel this brew has a lot of good qualities, but I just don't see much hype in this one."
"D- I was hoping for more from this as I really enjoy the summer version. I'll probably pass on this one in the future."
"D: it drank good and went great paired with late night jack in the box jalepeno poppers. I honestly prefer the yule smith summer over the winter though."
"A full, thick, foam sits on top of a burnt golden colored liquid. The liquid has a notable haze. It has a very pine and grapefruit hop smell. Candy-like and malt sweetness, mixed with a solid hop flavor, beginning immediately with the front-taste. Long, lasting, and lingering bitterness. Moderate carbonation. There is a remarkable fruitiness in the beer, half from the hops and partially from the fermentation. It's a very good beer."
"Well deserving of good marks, just not exactly my thing."
"D - A very solid American Amber / Red Ale and a nice departure from the typical winter / Christmas seasonal... I had no problem putting a bottle down by myself and would gladly partake in on occasion is this were a year round offering... Another fine job by the fine folks at Alesmith..."
"I look forward to trying other AleSmith offerings!"
"Somewhere between double IPA, barleywine and American strong ale. I remember liking the summer version much more, but this is pretty special too."
"Drinkability: This is a diet American barleywine. A subdued malty base and subdued hop notes (relatively), though I suppose they're (absolutely) high by other standards. I'll agree with the review averages and say that the summer version of this brew is definitely superior, though I'll also willingly admit that this is a finely crafted beer in and of its own right. At 9.5%, it should be treated with respect, but none of that is anywhere to be found. In conclusion, give me the summer version anytime ... but when it's off the shelf, I'll gladly take a bottle of this one."
"good stuff - like sculpin meets nugget nectar -"
"D: fairly high"
"Just had this beer on draft at Coronado Brewing Co. It was poured into a regular pint glass w/ a 1/4"" thick, beige head. The beer has a very strong citrus aroma that is very inviting and even refreshing for a Holiday Ale. The beer was very warming and had spice notes on the tongue. The hop spiciness and bitterness was well balanced with the alcohol. The mouthfeel was a little thin for what I would expect of a typical Holiday beer, but this is definitely a beer that fits the Christmas season on the ocean here in Southern California. I will look for this beer again."
"YuleSmith Winter pours out a clouded red with a hint of brown in the pour yieldeing a dark brown look in the glass. A healthy pour yielded nothing in terms of even a cap. A nice cap appeared over time with dark tan suds. Some clingy lace. This has a nice musk tyo it. It has a winter feel but is not boggled down with spice. Alot of toasted malt, caramel, rich candi canes, some dark fruits, faint hops. Sweeter as it warms up. While Yulesmith Summer is hop forward, the winter version is all malts, with hops in the back. A spicy hop kick with warming, blending ever so nice with lucious malts goozing with caramel, slight chocolate and fruit taste. Some plum and a candi sweetness. A nice winter red here without the spice to qualify as a winter warmer, I like where it's at. The feel is a big medium that's glidy and more spicy with warming, carb is there but not bitey, no attack on the tounge at all while maintaining life. A nice sweet aftertaste. I liked this, I would not call it a treat but it's damn good beer. I drank the bomber with ease. It satisfied me well. With that said, bring on the SUMMER."
"I would recommend this beer to beer enthusiasts that have never drank it before. But if you're thinking about getting it for someone else, ask if they have already had it. You'd be better off spending your money on a Founder's six-pack, but it's worth a shot."
"22 oz. bottle. Pours a hazy, almost completely opaque, dark amber color with a large, frothy, tan head, lacing throughout. Aroma is caramel malts, orange, grapefruit, resin, and spicy. Flavor is caramel, a hint of chocolate, resin, alcohol, dark fruits, and spice. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, a hint of alcohol burn, nice and bitter. Good beer, pretty good balance, very drinkable."
"Overall, a really enjoyable amber ale that definitely quenches your hop thrist. It's very enjoyable, but not particularly memorable. Definitely worth a try though."
"This was a nice beer, and I might pick it up again when I have a hop craving (but more balanced). Solid."
"- This is a bountiful and well blended recipe of an ale... very good, and perfect for the holiday. Probably the best holiday ale bottles anywhere around."
"Bold and worthy of respect. This beer is meant to sip not swill. Not for the timid or beginner."
"D: Considering this is an Alesmith seasonal, it should be this good. It is a fine example of style--more nuanced than Oskar Blues' Gordon and very much the imperial successor to Green Flash's Hop Head Red. That said, its potency is high even if not really detectable, limiting enjoyment somewhat."
"Drink- A very welcome suprise after a highly respected person gave me the recommendation."
"The taste is exceptional. Malty-hoppy-malty-hoppy that's the best way I can explain this one from start to finish. Its one of the most intrinsic beers from alesmith. Its everything a winter brew should be."
"D - this particular bottle is not really the greatest in drinkability, with the weird carbonation situation, but I would imagine this normally a very good, easy drinking beer."
"2007 rate- Winter version. Appearance- cloudy ruby colour with a chunky/fluffy head that sticks around. Smell- lots of C hops give it a strong tropical fruit nose. I could smell it all day long.... Taste- the hops were so stiff out of the gate that they tickled my nostrils like a strong serving of horseradish. Impressive! Sweet caramel malts give the backbone to this hop monster. Toffee and caramel with some leather. Almost sweet enought that its on the cloying side, but straddles the line brilliantly. Finish is dry as the hops pucker the mouth and the booze shows up. Fantastic beer all around."

"This is the first, and quite possibly the last, beer you would want for the night. Struggled to finish it after already having had a couple of other brews."
"poured into a mcchouffe tulip, this was quite cloudy with no particulates noted. golden to orange in color with a beautiful, thick, super creamy, white head. the head covers the top and sides all the way down. the head and lacing are quite persistent; this beer is beautiful to behold. big bouqet is honeyed, sweet, biscuity, floral, citric, and resiny. a vague buttery note takes the nose down a notch but i'm sure this is phenomenal when fresher (drinking summer 07 version now). very well-balanced taste between the moderately sweet malts and prominent yet super smooth hop bitterness. mouthfeel is phenomenal, has a rich, creamy quality to it with just the perfect carbonation. medium to full-bodied. i don't know the technical aspects too well but i'm guessing this has some unfermentables in it which make the mouthfeel superb. i'd love to try this on tap."
"Taste compare to some pine and burn caramel. Has a dry finish with a balance warming alcohol. I suggest this for those who like strong ales. I wonder what a fresh one will taste like. I wouldn't want to age any longer."
"Overall it has turned into a great barleywine, could use a little more age to let the hops fade a little more."
"D: Like a wire walker, this beer's beauty is in a masterful balancing act between a precipice of biting hops on one side, and a sticky quagmire of malt on the other. But for me, it's the herbal, almost minty, freshness that provides the twist, and separates it from the the crowd while clearing the way for another jaw-dropping sip."
"D: Balanced and easy to drink."
"D- Very easy for a 8.75 beer. Killed the growler with no issues. A little tipsy though haha"
"Thick and syrupy mouthfeel, almost chewy. Drinks like a barleywine. Very nice beer. Would seek this out again."
"D: This beer isn't difficult to drink, but it definitely needs to be sipped given the alcohol content and amount of bitterness."
"This is the Christmas version of Yulesmith (which Alesmith calls an imperial red ale); 22 oz. bottle with no vintage dating. The beer pours a highly-carbonated, hazed crimson (laced with brown) and topped with a voluminous, four-finger tan head that is almost frothy at the base, fine-bubbled at the apex, and can be teased above the rim of the glass. Loads of aroma hops contribute citrus, pine, and some fruity/woody notes, and are backed by caramel and maybe a hint of chocolate. The flavor follows suit nicely, but adds a light sweetness and some late leafy/green hops, on top of a medium, tingly and dry body. The beer is very drinkable and the hops have a huge presence, but they are not overly bitter. It is actually quite balanced for such a hoppy beer, and I think the lower ABV (for an imperial) helps them to accomplish that. Tasty and highly-recommended."
"Notes: This beer is VERY close to perfection. My personal preference would be for a tad bit more strength in the hoppy flavors, but that's just my personal preference for hops. I gave a friend a sip and she said ""wow, that's a dessert"" and that sums up my reluctance to give it a 5 in taste -- it was just a little bit sweeter than I like in my DIPAs. But ""balance"" really is the word to describe this beer -- balanced and smooth. Highly, highly recommended."
"Amyliz4 adds in that it tastes a little bit like chocolate and a nice barleywine--""it's fantastic."""
"Dark, hearty caramel malt balanced with tropical (pineapple, mango, etc.) and grapefruit hops. Pleasant alcoholic warmth. Hard to believe something this flavorful can be this balanced. Thick and chunky mouthfeel."
"D - Fantastic. I was really surprised to see a hoppy beer do so well with some aging."
"Christmas in a bottle."
"Dull orange topped by a dense, cream coloured head. The fine bubbles formed sheets that clung to the sides of the glass. Juicy grapefruit smell initially, followed by a warm pine resin aroma. There's some toasted character in there, but it's overshadowed by the hops. Great balance between big hop flavour and malt sweetness -- pine and orange/grapefruit on one side, malty sweetness and a bit of caramel and graham cracker on the other. Bitterness is controlled throughout and alcohol is just apparent at the finish. Medium to full bodied with very well integrated carbonation -- the fine bubbles create an exceptionally creamy texture. Slight warmth as well. At first, it seems like it'll end up syrupy and palate-coating, but ends up being surprisingly clean and balanced slightly towards dryness. Big hops, big malts, and great balance makes this a winner."
"D- This was a good brew. I don't think this is worth all the hype, but a good one nonetheless."
"Reviewed on: 12-25-2009 04:17:29"
"Good stuff here I can already tell...Pours a nice, red-amber with huge head. This is Dirk Diggler huge, chicas....Head is a reddish-tan and very creamy pillowy, like melted marshmallows. Nose is big on piney hops, maybe a touch of vanilla, some allspice maybe too...Beautiful, barleywine like qualities in the flavor...This is fantastic beer. Very rich, but also very sweet. Almost chewy thick....Some really roasty characteristics are evident. Best thing about this beer is the balance...Very rich and malty and gives way to long, bitter hoppy finish, in a good way. Fantastic beer, and at $4.99/bomber well priced. Must find..."
"Picked this up at Save-On, a great beer store in Mentor Ohio. Really dark copper-brown pour with huge caramel-colored head and incredible lacing. Lots of floaties and sediment. Very resiny, earthy, malty nose. Sweet candy-like aroma with hints of caramel and pine and a touch of alcohol. Taste is much the same. Very earthy, resiny, and complex, with a bit of dark fruits, oranges, caramel, molasses, candy, and just a touch of pine and ginger. The alcohol is there as well with gentle warming from start to finish. Thick, chewy, resiny, rich mouthfeel. This really improves as it warms up which helps the drinkability. With that said, it's very rich and sweet and it took a while to kill a bomber. But still a great beer from a great brewery."
"Picked up this winter bottle of Yulesmith at Julio's a few weeks back, dunno if its weakened at all but I'll hopefully have a summer one sometime to back this review up. Pours a dark amber brown color, dark for a DIPA, with an AMAZING head, this one is creamy and retains for the entire time I was drinking this one. Lacing thick like sea foam is left on my glass. Awesome carb bubbles rising after the pour. Smells of great malts and hops, spices in here too and some sweets. The only gripe with the smell is it didn't represent the full taste very well, but still a great smell. Taste is huge, great hops, great malts, good holiday like spices and a lingering citrus/sweet taste that is great. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy and smooth, suitable for a DIPA that I enjoy. Drinkability is good here, the spices might get to me after a while, they seem like a flavor that would do that, the 9% alcohol is well hidden, never shines through."
"22 ounce bottle, Winter 2007 YuleSmith. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a copper/red color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The aroma is citrusy hops (pineapple and grapefruit), spicy hops and caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some peppery and pine hop flavors in there too. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's rich, a bit slick and has a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good too, it's smooth and very enjoyable to drink. Alcohol is a bit noticable, but not overpowering at all. Overall I think it's a pretty good brew, I'd definitely recommend this to others."
"M/D - Full boided and incredibly oily. The hop resins coat your mouth and the sweetnes from the caramel provides the perfect balance to drink this one for a long time."
"D: Pretty good but not what I was expecting. Most holiday beers are very malty but this one has a ton of hops as well."
"Beer poured a clear dark copper color with a huge billowy off white head. Nose is caramel malt city and northwest hops. Taste is a wonderful balance of the huge caramel malt base, with hints of chocolate, piney and citrusy hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, very smooth in the finish. Drinkability is near perfect, a bit of alcohol warming with the first sip, perfect for the style! Highly recommended if you like imperial reds/strong ales!"
"22oz bomber: This one is a clear amber color. There was a huge head on mine. The aroma has both notes of pine and citrus hops. Also some floral, fruit and caramel malt notes. A bit of a bitter bite to the beer (predominately citric), but nicely balanced by the presence of a slightly more than medium malt body. Some caramel malts and fruits peeking out from under the hops. It has a creamy texture to it. Extremely nice."
"D - Not one of my favorites from Ale Smith but still a decent brew. A medium bodied brew with a good blend of malt and piney hops. I probably would seek this brew out again but very glad I tried it."
"Nice winter warmer enjoyed on a cool late spring night in LA. I wish I could get this back in Chicago for a fire companion."
"D-hides the alcohol very well, has a great sweetness to it with big hops and some nice malts to balance an otherwise hop dominant beer. i'm enjoying this quite thoroughly"
"A very good beer and one which I intend to drink in isolation (i.e., not directly after 13% barleywine Founder's Deca) next time."
"D-This is a great drinker and only wish I could get it on a regular basis. This beer does it all for me and I'm kind of sad now that it is gone."
"Quite drinkable, although this is probably mood dependent, if you don't want a huge flavor impact on your palate then definitely don't even consider this brew. I think it would go great with a hot stew, it's too thick a brew to compliment chili or any thicker/creamier soups but a nice piping hot spicey vegetable stew would be great!"
"D: Sadly, this was not enjoyable at all. It was way to0 sweet and the alcohol flavor was too strong. The spicy butter flavors in the taste make me wonder if this bottle has started going bad. As it stands now, however, I did not like this beer at all."
"Taste: Toasted bread-like malt character with big fruity and candy-sweet caramel notes, as expressed in the nose. Hops are aggressively bitter, featuring a nice pine & spice hop flavor, but certainly on the level with the malt. Finish is balanced as well, hops run more grapefruit and the toasted malt, almost chocolate. Consistency leans towards oily as the beer warms and the caramel becomes even more expressive."
"D - A really good Imperial Red and I was very glad to try this again, but a bit high in abv to drink alone - it is for sharing you know the winter, holidaze and all. I found it to have wonderful hop flavor and mild spice even though it was almost 2 months old at the point of sampling, I can only imagine how it would be on draft - A very good beer from a World Class Brewery!"
"Winter, 2008. Well, let's see what all the fuss is about. The beer looks great. It glows amber with hints of red-orange around the edges. This version is definitely a Double Amber Ale, and I'm not quite sure why BA doesn't split the Summer and Winter into separate entries but what's done is done. The head clings to the sides of the glass in great gobs. Even a sip of beer leaves enough lacing to make me a bit confused as to where I'm drinking from on the glass. The aroma could be a touch stronger, but I enjoy the subtlety and the depth of malt balancing out the enormous hops. The hops are more orange than grapefruit and slightly piney, as well. The flavor shows off the enormous amount of sweet, caramel malt used. It gets a perfect score more for balance than any particular incredible flavor. Alesmith manages subtlety in an enormously hoppy beer, which is quite a feat and deserves its recognition. Neither the hops nor the malt are the best in the world, however the balance and subtlety are striking with such enormous flavors. This beer is not what I expected. It is distinct in a world crowded by nearly indistinguishable enormously hopped San Diego-style hoppy beers. I dearly love many of these beers, but very few of them possess YuleSmith's subtlety. I'm thankful that I've had a chance to sample many big California DIPAs because, without that experience, I'm not sure that I would appreciate AleSmith's efforts. That said, experience is also a detriment; this beer would receive a perfect taste score if Russian River and Port didn't exist. The hops are excellent but could be slightly more complex. I lean towards the floral side of hops, like those in Pliny the Elder, over these citric-pine hops. I know little about the technical side of these beers, so I'm probably misstating things. On the other hand, YuleSmith has one of the best malt characters of a hop-bomb style beer that I've ever tried. It's a truly great beer and deserves the fuss, but living in California has made me enormously nit picky about hops. Ultimately, this is great, great beer and a must for all hop lovers."
"D: Incredible for its weight!"
"12/26/07...The appearance of this Winter Yule is very similar. A huge stiff head that settles in a rocky pattern to 3D lacing. The color of this one is darker; a seasonal redness. The smell, mouth and flavors are very similar. Cheers."
"In a pint glass this beer was a hazy red/brown color with a medium-sized tan head. It had a fruity aroma, as well as some biscuit. Cherry/dark fruit taste, bread, and a bunch of hops. Nice balance, sweet up front and hops bitterness at the end. Great beer."
"Drinkability: An above average amber where the alcohol hits hard. This is the first AleSmith offering that has not totally blown me away however. Not a bad beer, just one that I am not likely to pick up again."
"Sweet up front, nice midpalate character and an odd bitterness at the back, its not as bitter as I expected. I was almost expecting a DIPA in flavor from the aroma. The malt is there for sure but not the bitter. Second taste, some fruit flavors, maybe sweet apple, overall its pretty good. I can taste the alcohol and the bitterness is growing in my mouth. Its pretty good. I like it."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is strong orange and citrus with some caramel malts. The flavor is bitter orange peel with a nice caramel malt backbone. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"I like the summer version a bit better, but it was an aged summer version, so fresher is probably definitely better with either version of this beer."
"I've heard all the talk about Nugget Nectar being the best of the reds, and I have tried it this past month. However, YuleSmith Holiday was the best red I have tasted, and I will be happy to pay nine bucks per bomber to taste this again. Well done AleSmith."
"Originally reviewed on: 04-09-2007 18:49:18"
"My previous Alesmith experience was the IPA, which was unfortunately over-carbonated but nevertheless delicious. Yulesmith was a much better drinking experience."
"Thanks Don for a mega want! Thanks for the chance!"
"Overall this was a nice beer from AleSmith and a rich and full-bodied American Amber, but the aroma and complexity left me wanting a bit more out of this beer. Worth a look."
"Notes: Merry Christmas!"
"O: great malt, great hops but they don't work well together, sweet and hops clash, has similarities to the stone 13th anniversary but this is way better (compared to small pour of stone 13 and it makes similarities more apparent), if it were spiced instead of the hop presence i think the different tastes would work better together."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This is supposed to warm you up on those cold winter nights when the blizzards have snowed you in, your heat and power is out, and you have no food in the fridge. What are you going to do to fill you up and keep you warm? Bust out a Yulesmith of course! This is a big beer! Very malty. Very hoppy. Very delicious. This one you gotta sip through. Keeps you warm every step of the way."
"Drinkability: Awesome. What a gorgeous beer!"
"Notes: Really nice beer that definitely has a winter/Christmas feel to it, but would be wonderful anytime of the year. So many flavors that mix and mingle so well together."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a large foamy beige head. The aroma is sweet caramel malt, citrus hops, and pine. The flavor is a wonderful mix of the chewy sweet caramel along with the citrus and pine hop flavors. The finish is bitter and long lasting. The 9.5 % is not noticeable in the beer at all which makes this one dangerous, as it is so easy to drink. I'm glad AleSmith is going to ship to the Bay Area."
"Straight-forward, tasty amber ale, which works well as a Winter Warmer. I'll return to this later as I've still got an '08 that may have some interesting changes in the bottle over 2 years..."
"Glad these have been broken up into two different beers on BA, as they are certainly distinct. Both have an excellent grapefruit/hop aroma. I prefer the summer version (see my review), the winter version is much more mellow on the hops and much heavier on the malt. A bit syrupy."
"D: This is an above average beer. That being said, I would put it second behind Nugget Nectar in the Amber/Red Ale category. I can buy Nugget Nectar for $2 less per bomber (and save even more by buying NN in six pack form), so it suffers in rating because of that fact."
"Somewhat heavy, but a good, drinkable Dub/Imp IPA for the winter season."
"Another great brew from Alesmith. Nicely balanced and still interesting."
"Mouthfeel- Slightly thicker than medium body, slightly sticky. Medium carbonation"
"Overall a delicious and very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: I wish I had liked this one more. It's really not agreeing with my palate nor my stomach. Perhaps I'd like the Summer version better. The diacetyl and alcohol that shines through just ruined this one for me."
"I poured from a 22 ounce bottle(winter version) into a snifter. It pours a deep red, almost black, with a big, long lasting, sticky, white head. There is a pleasant citrus hops aroma. The flavor follows the nose, big citrus hops and a dry finish. It is medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel and well carbonated. A very solid imperial amber."
"This will do, good for a winter warmer tho..."
"Overall, if you want to have a hoppy, hoppy, Christmas, along with some nice yuletide flavors, this is a worthy, challenging entry."
"D= This one was great to share. We moved on to a milder IPA after this one."
"2009 vintage. 22oz. bottle served in my Bruery tulip. Poured a murky plum color with a creamy two inch, off-white head. Head eventually settles into a foamy/frothy/bubbly, thin cap with thick slashes of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals sweet grapefruit initially, with a malty character forming the backbone (perhaps caramel malt). Taste follows nose, with a little bit of resinous bitterness coming out at the back. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an oiliness that coats the tongue and an assertive background carbonation that leaves a bit of burn and astringency at the finish, as well as a residual heat that coats the esophagus. A very good beer; however, the $10 price tag was a little steep. Also, seems closer to a DIPA than an American Amber. Still, I would enjoy the opportunity to try this side by side with the Summer recipe."
"The taste is very interesting, but not sure if that's a good thing. There is lots of hoppiness here but there is something else to, that just brings a weirdness to the beer."
"A big beer with every attribute screaming IMPERIAL. This beer as an hot alcohol, hop, and malt nose. Its a full bodied beer with sweet molasses/caramel, dark fruit (plum/cherry), accented by a slight roast & nutty flavor to round out the profile. True to its Red Ale roots it is malt focused with the hops equally balanced. Though not hidden the alcohol is cleverly disguised behind the big flavor in this beer."
"As a big beer that is also sweet makes this not the easiest beer to drink. The high ABV does not help matters as well."
"Cask at Beachwood BBQ, poured into a nonic pint glass. Ah, AleSmith casks. Rare to see them at all actually, any time I do I know I am in for a treat. Winter Yulesmith poured out a dark amber-red with one finger of somewhat soapy looking head. Good retention, though little lacing. Aromas of orange peel and perfumey hops dominate along with some evidence of the 9.5% alcohol. Taste is highly floral with some syrupy malt balance and a good amount of orange to it. Finish is slightly alcoholic with cookielike malt and pine hops. Feels chewy, low-medium in carbonation and sticky. Some more bubbles here would probably lighten up the body, increasing drinkability and improving the appearance as well. As it is, I have to say I prefer Yulesmith from the bottle, which is a rare occurrence for an AleSmith cask."
"D- I absolutely love this! It is certainly not as bright and hoppy as the summer version-but it is much spicier and mellow. Perfect for the winter season. The alcohol is apparent in this brew and I found it to be a very enjoyable slow-sipper. Too bad this brew only comes around once a year!"
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely, no question about it. I hope to try the 4th of July version this summer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation. Drinkability is very good, this glass went down very easily. I really enjoy most things Alesmith but really enjoy both Yulesmith versions. Always a treat when I get my hands on one of these."
"i have had this the past couple of years and i have to say i like this years the least. too much malt and i miss the more citrus and floral hop flavors with lights malts. the booze really comes out of this."
"mouth feel full and drinkability good for such a womper of an american red"
"EDIT- 2009 vintage sampled 9.18.2010 during UCLA football romp, poured into pint glass. The head is a bit more liight tan than '08 version, smell of hops has faded a bit, but still a very tasty beer. Not up to standards of Nugget Nectar, but certainly one of the better (once again, need to modify style guidelines) Imperial Amber/Red Ales."
"Overall, a nicely crafted Imperial Red. I'm guessing that if you want more hops then the DIPA version of this beer has got what you want. However, this guy still has a nice punch of hop flavor and is also very smooth. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a strong Red."
"Good deal. I'd try this one again."
"Overall, an excellent beer that I highly recommend. I'd had the summer several times so was glad to get the winter one finally. Yet another excellent offering from Alesmith. Rotation - not avail in TX so had shipped in. If here, would be several per season. As is, I'll try to get a couple shipped each year."
"This beer is one of my holiday favs and to be able to try this on cask was a real treat. While the cask serving did take away some of the aggressiveness of the hops that I like so much and seemed to lessen a bit of the spicy content to an extent (I seem to remember more mint in the bottled version), it more than make up for this with a smooth body and its overall flavors. This is just a great beer no matter how it is served."
"(2.9) Rerate: 22oz bottle. Better beige head over a rich dark red body. the butterscotch is gone, but this is still too sweet and alcoholic; the hops are there, but they just get clobbered by all the sugar and alcohol. I'll bump it up a bit, but I still feel that this is way overrated."
"Bomber bottle at 42 F. Poured clear dark amber color with medium frothy off-white head that was that lasted with excellent lacing. Solid complex sour citrus and pine hop aroma. Medium to full body with smooth texture with soft carbonation. Full citrus, malt and spice flavor with a sharp bittersweet finish. Good brew that is a standout."
"M/D - With a full body and warming finish, YuleSmith is the ideal accompaniment to any and all family gatherings. This festival ale will provide balance and peace of mind to the most unsavory situations."
"D - Pretty high in alcohol at 9.5%...goes down pretty smooth. Not at all a sipper, but if I had more than one bottle by myself, it would be a problem. Really good winter beer - just strong enough without feeling excessive. Body is really medium, but the overall feel is of a heavier beer. Heavyness limits drinkability a bit, but overall pretty smooth for a beer this strong."
"OVERALL: An outstanding beer. I've only had a couple from Alesmith, but they've been very impressive to say the least. Like the bottle says, this really is deliciously malty and hoppy; a very drinkable and enjoyable balanced brew. One of the better beers I've ever had. Recommended."
"My bottle is from last holiday at least, so the hops have faded, but I still find this very well done. I would seek out all available bottles immediately!!"
"Another great beer from Alesmith. There's very little these guys don't do well. So glad to live in SoCal."
"Drinkability - Extremely so. This is pretty damn good and something I would expect from the ""Winter"" version of this beer. I'm not going to lie, however, when I say that the summer version was better than this. I still have one of those left which I need to drink ASAP. Overall, a very nice winter offering form AleSmith and fitting. It is a bit chilly outside right now and this is doing the trick to keep me warm."
"My only regret about this beer is that I didn't buy every one the store had. This is a beautiful beer. I could drink these until I collapsed. Bravo, AleSmith."
"This is Evil Dead Red's big brother. Similar taste, but it'll kick EDR's butt, as EDR only has a 6.66% ABV. A very quality beer."
"YuleSmith's mouthfeel is perfect. If the body isn't full, it's damn close. Smooth, ridiculously easy drinker. ABV is never noticeable. Just a phenomenal beer."
"Drinkability is rather high (keep it cold), it's an interesting seasonal but a nicely done west coast red. If you don't mind them to fruity, rich or hoppy, merry xmas!"
"I tried the winter seasonal Imperial Red version but I'd love to try the YuleSmith summer version DIPA as well."
"D: Excellent... this has easily become one of my favorite beers... hats of to AleSmith"
"A big, hoppy beer for those that love them. For the rest of us, a bomber might be too much to finish solo."
"Poured a slightly cloudy amber color with thin offwhite head. Smelled sweet and like dark fruits, plums and raisins. Tasted much like it smelled, dark fruits and sweet malts. Not a huge alcohol taste, but definitely present. This was an excellent beer. Did not have it fresh, but with a few months on it and it is still very enjoyable. A little syrupy as I get to the end of the bomber but nothing unpleasant going on. Very good and highly recommended."
"Notes: Tremendously well balanced DIPA that hits all the right notes for me. Great holiday beer to enjoy while basking in the glory of such a magical season. Damn, I love the holidays...and Alesmith! Highly recommended"
"Reviewed on 4/20/08. Winter bottle. Pours a red/amber with a huge light tan head that lasted. Aroma primarily of floral hops, also some piney hops, grapefruit, other citrus fruits. Flavor of piney hops, citrus with a malty finish (also got some sweetness and alcohol in the finish). At first this beer was very smooth to drink, but it got heavier and more syrupy as I continued to drink. A very good ASA (but not my favorite)."
"After having Stone 13 and looking back at this beer, imperial red's are a tough style to get right."
"Very good!!!"
"D - The bomber I shared with Dave went too quickly. Even though this clocks in at a hefty 9.5% it drinks just as well as some lighter IPAs and red ales."
"As good as this one is I'm not sure if I like it more than the summer version. Still, this is one fine crafted beer."
"Reviewed on: 03-08-2008 22:17:07"
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: This one goes down so smooth. I've just polished off a bomber and feel that I could go for another. This is an outstanding winter release. One of the best easily. You won't be disappointed. Very strong offering from Alesmith."
"D: Very nicely done beer from AleSmith, and one of the better winter ales."
"Bottom line: An exceptional DIPA that I hope every BA gets to try. Get it any way you can!!"
"Originally reviewed on 9-11-2007."
"Decent drinkability."
"Drinkability: Just fine for a 9.5% DIPA"
"A tremendously large IPA with great balance and done with a holiday twist. Typical of big IPA's with very bold hop character, balanced with a healthy dosage of malt. Atypical of IPA's in it's cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and alspice flavors. It remains pine-ey and spruce-ey while showing complex fruitiness of grapefruit and oranges. Malts offer a creamy, viscous round sweetness while spiced heavily with American hops and fruitcake. Bready and yeasty despite such boldness. A very good beer to compliment the holiday season...even if the holiday season ended 3 months ago."
"An interesting ale and worth a try though surely better when fresh. I look forward to the pending release of Summer Yulesmith next month."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color is a nice reddish brown with a 2 finger bubbly off white head. The head clung to the sides well. Aroma smelled spicy, some banana bread, and some orange. Taste was tangy, slightly peppery. Felt very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Tangy aftertaste lingered for a while. ABV hit a bit fast definitely a sipping beer."
"grapefruit - that leave a wonderful aftertaste on the palate. Overspiced for me, just too much on the palate. Good body and carbonation. Drinkability is reduced for me by its bitter and spicing, but overall above average."
"Drinkability= With the creamy mouthfeel and Abv. It is not highly drinkable. However, it is a very good holiday brew. Up there with Hoppy Holidaze and other great holiday beers. Did I say Holiday in my review enough?"
"Drink: A very drinkable IPA. The high alcohol content is definitely hidden. A very well-crafted great beer."
"Both versions of Yulesmith are winners for me. Wish I would have bought more than one bottle."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, small foamy head which disappears quickly, some nice lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, malts, citrus, some spices. The taste is sweet and tangy, very well balanced. There is a nice malty/sweet finish as well. Medium body. Very drinkable, another awesome brew from AleSmith."
"**I've noticed over the last two years that the differences between the two editions seem to be getting more pronounced. The Summer edition has stayed bright, hoppy, and charming with its palate blasting mindset. I'm finding this one just seems to have mellowed too much."
"yum!"
