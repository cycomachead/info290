"Terrible. Nothing at all going on here as far as taste or smell. No hops, no malt, no alcohol, nothing. Was even a little skunky. Bridgeport is very unimpressive brewery."
"My lasting impression is, ""I could make that."" This looks and tastes like my attempts at creating an IPA from scratch without really knowing what's what. I suppose what I actually made was an American amber--good to know."
"Using a nonic pint (that's what's suggested by the label), a beautiful shade of red with a tannish head that was with me all the way to the bottom. Nose is fairly dank and spicy. Hop character is very vegetably, like a broth made with carrots, celery, and the like. I'd suggest this was related to the rye, but I've noticed this with Bridgeport's Conviction Pale Ale, Signature IPA, and Hop Czar Imperial IPA as well. In the red and the pale, it's tolerable, good even, but in the others it's overwhelming. Decently carbonated with a relatively high viscosity and a bitter, pepper-like aftertaste, this ale is surprisingly drinkable...in sips, not gulps...with a snack, which works well with the moderately high ABV."

"A balanced Amber that masks its ABV well and presents a balanced flavor between bitter orange zesty hops and toasted Amber grains. The rye adds just enough spiciness without drowning out the other flavors in the beer."

"Overall not a bad beer, Unfortunately with no bottling date that i could find i suspect i have an old bottle. Could be better fresher."

"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Amber red with not much head or carbonation. Very drinkable hoppy red ale. The hops and bitterness last on you tongue for quite a while. Not an everday beer at 7.5 abv, but one or two every once in a while for a nice change of pace. Very affordable at 6.99 for 6 pack in KC.  Will buy again at this price point."

"O: Bought a 6er on sale for $5.99, a more than fair price for a unique beer. Interesting how 'triple hops' and 'double red' mix. I'm normally not a big fan of red ale but would definitely buy again for that price."

"Overall, not a bad American Red/Amber ale, though I might not seek this out, I might have this again if offered."

"O: Could have been much better. Could have been worse. I expected more because of the packaging, and didn't restrain my expectations even though it was Bridgeport. Still, a decent brew, definitely not bad."

"Not a big fan of this beer. The smell was the best part, but it went down from there."
"O - I'm not quite sure what BridgePort means by ""triple hopped"" with their double red ale, Kingpin but I assure you, there's a hell of a lot more hops in here than Miller's ""triple hopped"" Lite. Either way, while exponentially hoppier than that bladder-filling swill, Kingpin seems more balanced than anything which seems to work out great. Sweet, bready malt provides a nice body and smooth feel with predominantly earthy hops filling in the gaps and finishing out with dry bitterness for an easy drinking (and higher alcohol) red that won't destroy your taste buds in the process."
"Food match: As the flavour became more fruitcake I began thinking about Christmas ham, turkey, stuffing and roasted vegetables - I would start there."
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely not as I expected, with the triple hopped now where to be seen. Drinkable but average overall."
""
"A pretty respectable red ale with excellent looks and a good if unremarkable taste. You may detect some rye crispness and pungency in the flavor, but otherwise it's the hop bitterness that is the strong point with this beverage."
""
"solid beer but better beers out there"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours red (!) with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Lemon, grapefruit, minty earthy aromas from hops, a little bit of sweetness too. Surprised there isn't more going on in the smell department being triple-hopped and all. Thin body, dry finish, more about the hops than the malt. Earthy, spicy, tangy and acidic with a bitter hop finish. Drinks easier than most beers given its ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Lack of balance and hop bitterness that is not matched by aroma makes it a beer that might satisfy hop-heads but is heavy handed otherwise."

"Overall 3.75: Certainly, this is just a few steps away from an outstanding beer. The taste is very good as is the mouthfeel and I would order round after round of these if I could find them on tap. There are a few knocks on it, but very few. This is an easy-drinking 7.5% (!) ale and if you are a fan of red ales, you will be hard-pressed to find a better one. If you are accustomed to a certain red ale that starts with a ""K," this baby will blow your mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice, interesting spicy character with supporting rich malt characters. I guess that a lot of the hop character has dropped out, as the bottle states 'triple hopped'."
""
""
"Thanks, kemoarps, for the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: without a doubt the best American Red Ale I have had to date. A good sipping ale - something worth while onece every now and then. The price is a bit restrictive at AU$100 a case (2013), but a 6-pack every now and then won't hurt too badly."

"A drinkable red ale. Somewhat less than sessionable at 7.5% ABV. But I;m going to stash a couple bottles of this for a bright sunny spring day."
""
"Not a bad beer but not a great one. The hops and malt just are not working in harmony."
""
"O: surprisingly good. Tied with Ninkasi Believer Double Red Ale in my book and I really like Believer."
""
"Summary - Pretty good overall. I was afraid when the smell was strong with hops, but it is fairly light in that category - especially when paired with food."

"Bridgeport Kingpin Double Red Ale ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it was enjoyable. Not the greatest red ever, but a welcome part of my sampler twelvesky."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's drinkable enough, and I don't get the sense of a particularly high ABV beer, which is good at least. But it's just dull: there's really not a lot to it. It feels as though all the flavours have given up, and they're putting in only the most perfunctory effort."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clouded rust color with a central dome and surrounding bullae of soapy lighter tan bubbles. Smells like sweet caramel malt, some dank hops, some pine hops and a bit of soap. Flavor is spicy with some nice malts, a bit of special B character, tea, caramel, body odor, some resin and a bit of pine. Medium on syrup body with a lighter carbonation character. Overall not a bad beer, I'd drink this quite a few times."
"Body feels overly syrupy."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, not sure the freshness. This pours a reddish / amber color with a mid sizzed tan head which leaves a lacing. The scent is mild, a little caramel and some hops. The feel is medium. The taste decent, some hop bite followed by some caramel malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: better and much more drinkable than remembered; some aging recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish/orange color with a slight off-white head. Scent is mild with malts and slight hint of hops. Taste is bold with wheat, rye, and hops. After taste is slightly crisp and bitter. Drinks smooth but has a good grain taste that is hard to pass up. Made quite well!"
""
""
""
"Overall, I just don't have much to say. This is as mediocre as beer gets & with all those taps begging for attention, I was bummed to get something this hum-drum."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite pleasant for sipping. From the 12 oz bottle. Cost was a reasonable $1.49 for a single."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A good red ale. Lots of interesting, mellow flavors. Definitely a must try, if not for you, at least me again."
""
""
""
""
"0- Really like this beer. Kinda surprised as most reviewers dedn't give this a positive review. It's not the best red ale I've had but I like it as I like hoppy beers and like the hops found in this one."
""
"Impressed. Has a ton of goodies packed away in a nicely priced 12oz bottle. Makes for a nice desert, or a snack in that case."
""
""
"Altogether, a very drinkable ale and with 7.5 ABV, that is something you may have to watch out for."
"Not a Red Ale guy. I guess that should disqualify me from the review but here is a review anyway. Smooth, a little flat for my taste in terms of carbonation. Some flavor but I feel one flavor was more dominant than the others and I can't put my finger on it. I gave the bottle to my brother-in-law to finish because well, I don't want to waste it. He like it but it wasn't a favorite of his. Maybe I swayed his opinion. Bridgeport should focus on lighter beers in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Liked this on-tap, had to try it in a bottle. Sharp aroma is malty with an overtone of caramel and spice. It pours a dark, clear coppery with a pale golden tan head that leaves some good lacing. Mouth-filling flavor has malty and hoppy qualities plus hints of caramel and cloves. Texture has good body and a fair amount of fizz, not quite as much as when on-tap but still appreciable. I'm glad I gave this one another review."
"O - Overall, I dunno that this is one I'd go out of my way to find, but I'd happily drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A solid medium bodied beer that seems to get better as the glass gets emptier."
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not good either. Not worth the money."
"i find this to be grossly underscored here on BA. it pours a clear light amber color with a lacey beige head as tall as you want it to be. smells like big red malts, but not dry like the irish reds. some resiny hops in the nose as well. flavor is a bit tart, but not like a sour at all, just bursting with that malt flavor, very unique. hops balance it all out at the end, and the alcohol is never noticed. feel is nice here too, not a heavy beer for a double red at all. good carbonation keeps it feeling lighter than it is. overall an excellent brew from bridgeport, and one id like to see get a little more love from the beer advocate community. this is really good stuff"
"I like this one. Pours a dark copper with a thin white head. Smell is deceiving, as the nose leads you to a dopplebock or heavy dunkel. The taste is rye, caramel, maybe brown sugar or molasses, and a fairly intense mutliple hop finish - there are tones of floral as well as citrus."
""
""
"O- Ok beer. The appearance is mediocre, but the taste and mouthfeel are nice."
""
"O: Overall another average and disappointing beer from Bridgeport. Reminds me of Redhook or some other grocery store crap. I forgot how boring and overly strong their beers were. No nice smells or tastes from this beer, possibly due to age. I won't be buying another one of their beers for a long, long time. Maybe I can use this beer for cooking something."
"Overall this beer was worth the try as far as bang for your buck goes it absolutely is. Bridgeport puts out a quality product in my price range and I appreciate that."
"Pours a medium orange-red amber. Thin head but some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt, bready malts and a hint of hops. Starts with a bitter malt and apple flavor with some straw undertones. Finish is dry, bitter and dry grass. Hops provide bite without any aromatic presence. A bit too sour, acidic and dry, bitter finish to be a good red."
"All in all, pretty interesting in that they included rye in this beer...other than that, pretty average stuff. That said, it was enjoyable and I'd have another."
"We talkin' Michael Clarke Duncan or that fat white guy? Regardless, this stuff pours a sunset russet-amber topped by a finger of lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises toffee, caramel, orange zest, ruby red grapefruit peel, and a hint of greens. The taste holds notes of dried maple syrup, light grapefruit peel, light caramel, and an overarching surge of some blandly bitter citrus rind. Let's be blunt, indeed. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a pretty sad beer, one that has no idea of balance, let alone quality flavor expression."
""
""
"I love this one... BUY IT! Bridgeport nails Amber Ale with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The full bitterness of the hops and really dry finish make this abrasive and a bit harsh to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark orange, light red color with a minimal head. Smells spicy, must be rye, hints of malt too. The flavor is a good spicy flavor but nothing really special and the rye seems to dominate the hops. Overall, not bad but not something I'm going to be buying more of any time soon."
"Liked it better the second time I had it."

"O - For only $6.99/6-pack Kingpin is not a bad ale."
"O- Awesome double red for the price of 6.99 a sixer. 7.5% abv hides very well in this brew IMO. Bridgeport wins again with great beer at a great price."
"O â I always remember âredsâ being the hot beer twenty years ago, with Killianâs Red serving as my âbridge beerâ between adjunct beers and âbetterâ beers, but I never truly enjoyed them as a style. Until now. If this is an example of what reds can be, sign me up!"
"O: This is an untraditional red ale and will not appeal to a beer purist. It does, however, fill an interesting niche that I can see myself occasionally craving. The dryness of a wine with the drinkability of an ale."
""
""
"O- Disappointing for sure. Really artificial and chemical tasting overall for me, like a sour patch kid candy mixed with a cleaning agent. Not digging this. Gave this brew a few chances thinking I may have had a bad bottle or twoâ¦ but still it let me down on multiple occasions."
""
""
""
"O- If you're expecting a ton of hops this one doesn't really deliver. The malt flavors are nice though so I'm enjoying it none the less."
""
""
"This is a somewhat heavy beer. Itâs fine in a 12oz serving, but I canât see sessioning it. A little too heavy and a little too monotonous for me."
"I've been drinking various beers from Bridgeport for a while now, and while I'm still not a super-fan of the Double Red Ale style, this one is a very crisp, nicely hopped, delicious and easy-drinking brew I would have any time. Definitely recommended."
"Overall this is a great go-to sipping beer. It's big, strong, and not really flawed. Problem is, there are 5000 other beers just like it, and this one had nothing in it that really stood out and was memorable. So all in all, I'd call this a good beer. But just good."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, pine, sweet malt, and citrus (mango?). Since, there is no American Double Red style, this beer fits well enough into the style of an American Amber / Red Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, slight pine, slight citrus, and hint of wheat. Overall, tastes more like an American IPA, than an American Amber / Red Ale."
"A straightforward and bold flavor. Beautiful to look at. An enjoyable and different amber ale."
"Poured into a frozen mug. The head on this thing is thick, creamy and foamy and has some real staying power. The color is garnet and the beer is clear. Smells of raisin, malted milk balls and sweet, tangy hops. The flavor is sturdy, with the raisin up front and spicy hops next. The sharp, prickly carbonation is great, then it washes down leaving a malty glow. A bit of a grainy mouthfeel. The 7.5 ABV is not very noticeable. It goes down smooth and could lead to premature (if that's possible) intoxication. As I down it, the lacing is firm and intact in the glass to the end. A good one, for sure."
"A good red, and for $6.99 a sixer, it's hard to beat."
"This beer seems like a confused adopted stepchild wandering through a family reunion. Lots of hops argue with a malty red base and strange flavors intermingle."
"Atmosphere is decent. Ruby brown hue and a little head remains around the rim and some dry sticky lacing that remains throughout. Nose is pungent and woody. Flavor is pungent with a bit of an unappealing synthetic sweetness. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"Reddish orange in color with a white head. I love the look of beers with this color! I first noticed a yeast-like aroma, followed by malts and alcohol. Given that this is triple-hopped, I expected a stronger hop aroma. In flavor, the caramel malts come through and a grassy hop bitterness is more pronounced. Mid-taste, the alcohol is noticeable (but along the lines of what I'd expect for a 7.5% ABV brew). Body is light to medium, nicely carbonated, and has a crisp mouth feel. Finish leaves a hoppy bitterness and a taste of of alcohol that lingers."
"T - not as strong as the description. Triple hopped, double red would make me think something like an Arrogant Bastard is on the way but really it's his 2nd cousin. Malty, hoppy yes. But bitter, not very smooth. The hops do not make me think of the pungent west coast varieties. Dry and bitter overall but there is some good taste of roasted malt with stronger than average hops. It's ok but there's better out there if there's a choice for sure."
"This was a decent double red ale, but I felt a little lacking in flavor. I didn't get much out of it, but at the same time it was drinkable. Glad I tasted it, but I'd order something else after a taste."
"O: Decent, but the flavors don't meld as well as I would have liked. Don't feel the need to try this again."
"Overall: This is a very decent brew. It's worth getting if you see it."
"I gave this beer a 4.0 overall based on the time of year I sampled it. I have been craving a straightforward beer as an alternative to corporate swill in the late summer heat. I am looking for more malty flavor as an alternative to my go-to IPA, but sweetness really gets to me in the heat. This beer would be great for fall tailgating as well before it gets cold enough to warrant a bigger beer. It won't change your life, but a cheap way to not compromise beer credentials when you're looking to get hammered (7.5% ABV and poundable - woohoo)."
"O: This is one of those wonderful beers that is unique enough for the adventurous, but mild enough for the session drinkers. Definitely worth a try."
"Nose is restrained, if pleasant, bready and slightly toasty with vague fruity notions of baked apples, maybe a hint of cherry. The lack of aroma 'oomph' is made up for by a smooth malty goodness. Not so much caramel as fresh baked dark bread with a light smear of butter and brown sugar. A touch boozy. Nice velvety feel reveals hints of chocolate among the stronger toasted notes. Not bad, although it seems a red ale this subtly flavored could have been fit into a smaller ABV package."
"CONCLUSION: For being ""triple hopped", I agree that this was disappointing and perhaps a failed attempt at making an amped up red ale. I would think BridgePort could make this a lot hoppier and big, as they did with their Hop Czar IPA, and still call it a ""double red"". This is my only complaint against this beer. I got mad respect for BridgePort as a hallmark of the Portland beer scene, I know they can do this one better."
"D - Entirely to bitter for a red. Not bad, but there are better in the style."
"Dr: Decently priced, relatively high ABV, and of bad quality. I won't have it again."
"I don't mind Kingpin, but I strongly suggest BridgePort stop advertising it as a ""double"" red ale that is ""triple hopped""; surely it would fare better in the mind of the average reviewer without those unfortunate monikers. Or, conversely, they could do the right thing and bulk up the malts and double-down on the hops. Either way, changes are needed."
"The purported hop profile doesn't really flesh out, beyond rendering a generic bitter crutch, but it's nice to see the rye strutting its stuff on the flip side."
"I'm loving it...typical good stuff from Bridgeport."
"Thanks for the nice beer."
"I was surprised by this one, given the reviews, but grading to style this is a flavorful, interesting, and well-balanced beer that stands out above most ambers to me. Love the touch of rye malt too."
"Overall, Kingpin exhibits qualities both good and bad. Not Bridgeportâs best, but not their worst either."
"Overall: Not bad, good for a change of pace but not my style of beer. Good one to try."
"A clear reddish brown in color with a big light tan head. Smells vaguely of pine cones. Taste is initially a mild sweetness, followed by a big earthy, piney, resinous bitterness. Mouthfeel is light, medium carbonation. Overall a good beer, tastes a bit watery though for how much alcohol it contains. I would drink it again though."
"Final thought - Pricey at $10 a sixer and a decent 7.5% abv. Pick this up if you like reds or really love the brewer. Otherwise, try this on tap"
"somewhat sippable, but somewhat ordinary...I'm going to try adding a touch of Wells Bananabread beer to this."
"Mouthfeel is thick and very slightly sticky. Overall, not bad at all."
"Overall: Surprisingly complex twist on a red/amber. The deep fruity flavors could be balanced a bit more effectively with more pronounced hop flavor though."
"Appearance is red amber in color with a healthy head stickin around awhile leaving fair lace. Smell, well for as hoppy as it is, hops are not dominant, a little grainy with a citrus note. Taste is fairly true to style, but just with more hop punch. Mouthfeel is medium with a good spike of carbonation. Nothing to exciting, but something different to try."
"The taste has some powdered texture upfront and toasted rye bread with a little caramel sweetness. The middle has a bitter powdered orange peel and dry grass nitterness to it. The finish ia dry and somwhat metallic. Not a bad brew, but nothing special."
"Overall: this beer seems to have a fair amount of potential but it just doesn't quite live up to it. I think it's the tart sourness that gets me the most: maybe too much acid from roasted malts? I don't know, but it just doesn't seem to work well here with the caramel sweetness and the earthy bitterness."
"Poured a clear red liquid with an off white thick head that was well retained. The aroma was a nice malt and hop aroma, well balanced. The taste, as with the nose, is well balanced, malt sweetness balanced with floral hops. The beer has a medium feel to it. The beer is smooth, clean has good carbonation. Overall, a very solid and interesting beer with a nice aftertaste."
"Overall this is a alright red ale. It is nothing spectacular but it doesn't suck either, so its worth trying."
"Poured from the bottle into my snifter a deep amber color, head was off white and average, about two fingers. Head dissipate quickly with really good lacing. Aromas were very balanced with a great caramel malt smell, and floral hops. Taste is balanced as well, with malt sweetness and great balance from floral flavors. Feel is smooth, with some oiliness, light carbonation. Overall a good beer, fitting in the style, though I would have appreciated a little more hop flavor, and carbonation."
"Decently hopped taste, toffee, irish moss and/or malt seemed evident, mild grapefruit tinge from the hops. Hides 7.5% alcohol well. For the triple hopping claims, falls short of hoppy expectations, but still remains a solid choice at the price. ($8/6). More bitter than almost any red ale short of nugget nectar."
"D - Bitter start that fades quickly to a malty finish that lingers on the tongue."
"This ale is interesting, but it isn't hitting the spot for me. Some more complexity with hops and malty sweetness and body would have added a lot. It was worth a try, but I'll look elsewhere next time."
"Overall: Touts being triple hopped, so, like Miller Lite, it's ""triple hops brewed."" I gotta say, it just doesn't come together for me and there's really not much to this one, especially with a name like Kingpin (an, at times, understated Spider-Man villain)."
"The beer is is orange-red with a thick foamy off white head that hugged the glass. It smells like a fruitcake, sweet and fruity with a hint of caramel the most dominant aroma of fruit is peach, I couldn't single out the rest. The taste is sweet then bitter with flavors toasted malt, bread, lemon and pine. This is a thick, full-bodied beer with soft carbonation and a dry finish. I'm glad I picked this one up, it's very well rounded and I'll have no problem finishing the 6-pack."
"Maybe this beer was poorly stored by the retailer."
"O--I could drink several of these, maybe. Its a good beer except when that corny taste rears it ugly head. But not great."
"I really didn't enjoy the taste of this one. It just had some weird flavors going on that I'm not used to. I won't say it tasted bad because to each their own, you know. It just had this bittery sour taste that left a bad aftertaste. It was really not enjoyable at all to finish (and I did) the sixer bought for a very reasonable $6.99. I don't have too much experience with reds but I am anxious to try another one of the same style to compare. I definitely won't be buying this one again but I couldn't resist a 7.5% abv beer at such a low price. I should also revisit the Bridgeport IPA as I do remember that one as very solid."
"O- definitely closer to arrogant bastard than miller lite. ill probably pick up a sixer of this given the price. i feel i rated this beer higher than average, but i also feel that it isnt given the respect its due. check it out for a nice value craft beer."
"Hearty yet easy drinking, dominated by an estery yeast flavor manifesting as fresh sliced apples. Pleasant malt complexity, crusty multigrain bread and honey. Slighty toasty, breadiness and apple notes seem to domintate. Medium bodied and easy drinking. It has fortitude, yet never feels heavy. Something i'd drink again for sure, seems well suited to cooler weather."
"Tastes like a generic amber beer, though a little stronger than most. Not worth repeat-buying. But it does make a good end-of-the-workday beer, in a liter's amount."
"Trying to broaden my palate and drink local. Checked the website for the brewer and this beer is one of a couple that has no accolades. Not average, but not quite excellent."
"First off , good job on the new labels and also seeing some new additions to the lineup. This is a red ale that drinks like a 6% beer. The hops are there but not as apparent as say Rocket Red from Bear Republic. The malt really anchors this brew but the finish is a little rough and could be a little smoother. Decent beer and true to the style though I expected more hops from the triple hopped part on the label"
"O: Big malt is the hallmark of this beer."
"Big waft of fruitcake and wild herbs in the nose. Mildly hazed deep amber color shows some tiny bubbles; those same bubbles have produced an epic creamy lacing. The ale is not shy, and shows off its lush smoothness right away, while the malty medium body holds together very well. Biscuit, bread crust and a hint of grainy caramel throughout the malt--this beer does show its bold Red Ale side. Hops throw down a pretty hefty bitterness, brash but flavorful. Fruitiness suggests ripe apple orchard flavors with a hint of golden raisin in the back end; alcohol is warming. Finishes bittersweet and biscuity. A worthy encounter--a bit more caramel edge would do it great, but a good drink nonetheless."
"O - This was pretty tasty. I guess I like a double red ale with rye."
"O: was expecting more from an ostensibly hoppy double red ale...perhaps different hops would have improved this?"
"Overall I found this beer to be pretty decent. It's not necessarily something I'll be rushing back to, but I'm glad I tried it."
"I'm a big fan of rye, but this beer just didn't quite do it for me. The rye is nice, and I wouldn't hesitate to have another. Not something I'd rush out to pick up another sixer of."
"Overall, an OK hoppy red. Nothing too special though."
"The body is around medium with a real slick feel that makes it seem thinner than it is. It's mildly carbonated and the finish is just a tiny bit dry, pretty clean. Not a bad beer, but not earth shattering, typical Bridgeport."
"Nice amber coloring with a 1 finger if not a bit weak head but still very clean and strong look. Smell is very sweet biscuity caramel. Has a slight floral tangy cereal smell. Gives off a certain pilsner smell for sure. Taste is kind of all over the place. Initially very weak at first but really open up in the middle. Strangely an aspirin like bitterness hits you hard in the aftertaste and really sticks around. The middle of the taste is a bit of a fruity, cereal like quality. Actually if not for the crazy bitterness in the end it would be quite nice. FYI, I love hop bitterness but this goes into medicinal territory. A bit undercarbonated on mouthfeel and also a bit hot for 7.5%. This beer had potential but they really lost me with crushed aspirin for the aftertaste."
"I expected there to be some more hop oomph from this beer. Not really there. More of a mild earthy hoppiness swimming in some grainy maltiness. Not sweet, exactly, but a bit boring. Some light citrus notes, and fairly thick, almost soupy in the mouth. Disappointing."
"Bitterness has plenty of bite on the palate, but still lacks in hop flavor. Candy-like maltiness is a bit wearing and the alcohol is a bit rough, shows every bit of the 7.5%. Toasty but almost more of the burnt variety. Mouthfeel is ok, but the finish is just too rough to qualify as a delicious craft beer. Pretty lame attempt at joining the 'double' or 'imperial' party by Bridgeport, I just cant imagine the testing of this and whoever thought this would be a good beer to release to the masses. Very mediocre offering."
"Easy drinking. Probably a beer best paired with food."
"One and done for me. The overly bitter finish makes it hard to enjoy more than one."
"D: The alcohol is present, but not overpowering or distracting at all. Pretty tasty. I could drink a couple of these and be just fine."
"Clear reddish amber with a 1/4 off white head that dwindled down to a small halo in a few minutes. Not much of a smell. Tasted good going in, malts, smoke, biscuit. Some mellow hops on the back end, and the warming of the belly with alcohol. Though the hops are not too bitter, they linger quite a while."
"Overall just not what I was hoping for or expecting. Bitter yes but hoppy goodness, no."
"I drainpoured this one... Couldn't get past the sweet malts..."
"Drinkability: This beer has just made it into my top 5. It's that good."
"Drinkability - If you like very bitter finishing ales than this beer is for you, if not steer clear."
"Overall, I'm just not liking this one. I really don't like the aroma (it got more perfumey after it warmed), and the flavor is just not balanced right. I think the Liberty hops are running too high, resulting in a mouth-puckering bitterness coupled with that perfumey flavor. I wouldn't drink this again. I would, however, drink their CafÃ© Negro Porter though! That was a good new addition!"
"Taste: There is definitely an initial burst of bitterness that is followed by a little sweetness but not a large amount of either. The taste quickly fades but leaves vary little aftertaste."
"Would I buy it again? Not necessarily. Would I drink it again? Yeah, I think so. Draw your own conclusions based on that."
"Pale red in color with a dense and rolling tan head that holds its own for a bit before retreating into a thick frothy covering. Subtle sweet malts and grassy notes to the nose initially. Fleeting light fruits and florals meander. Good mix of bitter up front and background sweetness to the palate. Nothing bold, but it all fits. Has a medium body with a near creamy core which is followed by a definite crispness. Enjoyable, albeit a bit misleading in the labeling department, as there's nothing ""double"" about this brew."
"Pours out a translucent copper hue with dense 1-finger head. Leaves significant lacing. Emits a beautiful hop scent, citrusy, complimented perfectly by the sweetness of the red ale malts and a light caramel. The taste is bitter, of course, hoppy and malty, somewhat of a copper bite to it, and a touch of booziness. Tastes great, actually, but unfortunately the fullness of flavor falls off at the end. It has full body, quite viscous, but not too sticky. It's a strong brew and perhaps not the easiest to drink for that reason, but I could drink a pitcher of this with beer if it were available."
"D - Very balanced flavor between the hops and the malts, with neither completely overpowering the other. With that said, this is a slightly boring beer. Nothing special going on. I have to admit this isnt my style of beer, but I thought there would be a little more falvor wise going on. Again, this isnt the style I usually drink so I'm not an expert at what the flavor profile should consist of."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not what I hoped for, not beckoning, but slid down easy enough..."
"Assertiveness kicked up a notch in the flavor, but the alcohol clashes against an onslaught of German style hops and a syrupy/spicy rye note. This beer is having trouble finding its identity, as it has the sweetness of an amber, the hop profile of a German pilsener, and the body of a double IPA. I can't say it really works for me. Mouthfeel is dry, but syrupy and sticky on the palate. Big bubbles of carbonation feel gritty going down. Not my bag. It's a decent attempt, but has too many stylistic and flavor errors for my liking."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear dark copper with a finger of off white head. Malty aroma with a hint of fruit and hops. Medium bodied. Malt predominates, but there is a decent hop bite. Bit of a tang that was off putting to me. Fairly dry on the finish from the hops. This didn't do much for me."
" Body is smooth and creamy, not nearly as still as the appearance would indicate. As full as a big red ale should be, without the stickiness of some imperial ales. On the whole, a very drinkable new offering from Bridgeport. While this is obviously an attempt to compete with Ninkasi's Believer, it fills a slightly different spot in the lineup by not being a complete hop bomb. Still, it's a very enjoyable brew."
"D: A drinkable beer for 7.5%. But overall, a forgettable brew."
"D - Great drinkability. Nice and light but depth of flavor - not heavy at all and the hops and bitterness balances well with the sweetness ."
"I had a NN last night and can't help but compare the two, this one pales."
"Yet again another Bridgeport beer that I know I am going to drink a lot of. This triple hopped double red ale is exteremely well balanced with the hops and malts. Definitely shows some good hops but it isn't so intense that it takes away from the sweetness of the malts. In my opinion the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness from the malts coincide very well, with neither ingredient dominating the other."
"Flavor is generally the same, with earthy and faintly sweet malt notes balanced by herbal hops. Nothing stands out here exept the overly thin body. Barely bitter finish recalls the six packs promise of triple hopping, etc. Not worth it."
"Upon reevaluation a few months later, I found the dense, rich head significantly more pleasing and the malt profile admirable. The rye really added a different dimension and the beer came across as better overall. Still, though, save the Liberty for the American interpretations of German lagers."
"This beer pours a red amber color with a slight amount of off white head that doesn't cling to the glass much. The aroma is missing... There's not much there, but if I imagine I can maybe come up with some fruity hops. The taste starts and ends malty, but very plain with a little hoppy bitterness thrown in there. For a beer that is so-called 'triple hopped' it is certainly lacking in the hops big time. The mouthfeel is about average. Overall I wouldn't really bother with this one unless you need to."
"Overall, this is a competent beer but some tweaking by BridgePort could easily make this spectacular. Close but no cigar, boys."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a slightly smooth amount of carbonation."
"The flavor is that of red ale with a slightly more pronounced hop character. (I realize that may seem a little ""no Duh"" but that's exactly what this beer is) The malt is traditional toasty caramel flavor with a bigger earthy, herbal hop presence than normally expected. Overall this is good but the hop flavor needs to be blended into the flavor better and the overall hop character to me is a bit one sided."
"3.5/3/3/3/3"
"I was expecting a winner when I opened this bottle, but I guess this brewery got so big that it doesn't care what it puts out now. Not terrible, but won't buy it again, even though it was fairly cheap."
"D - Drinkability is good for 7.5%. Well hidden and not too filling. A decent beer."
"6 pack bought from Haggens store in Tualatin. $6.79 Kinda like the straight good looks of the beer., dark clear copper tones with a big thick creme coloured head. Aroma again very simplistic, earthy hop,nutty ,toasty malts Again a simple plain slightly resinous hop and a nice nutty maltiness, struggling to find any rye though that may be at the very end and lends a rather spicy finish. Ok on my palate, smooth long ending peppery spice. Overall a rather simple beer..far more simple than the dessription led me to believe. Slightly let down but it really is not a bad beer."
"Not a bad beer but not great either. It is a forgettable beer."
"Not much on the aroma but a full flavor sweet malt character with the spice and tea bite indicative of a good red. It's certainly nothing out of the ordinary but it's done just right. It definitely needs to be warmer to allow all the flavor to come out."
"Overall, a pretty good brew. I expected a bit more after reading the label, but that's marketing for ya. Worth trying when you see it."
