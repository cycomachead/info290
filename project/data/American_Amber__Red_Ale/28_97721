3.79,6.8,3.75,4,3.75,3.5,3.75," The taste begins with a hop flavor which is predominantly pine with a slightly fruity accent from the yeast which hints of English character with mild malt sweetness rounding out the taste and light woody flavor continuing into the finish with semi-dry and bitter quality. Overall a decent red ale with that familiar Anchor yeast in the taste and hops sufficient to balance.The maple contribution seems to dry and boost alcohol rather than flavor or sweeten, but that is not unexpected.","Slatetank","Nov 13, 2014"

4.02,13.2,4.25,4,4,4,4,"Reviewed in real time... This beer looks great: a massive head of yellowed orange-tan rests atop a clear deep-copper body with a crimson cast and orange and gold highlights. If you're going for a beer that looks like fall, this is it! Aroma displays spicy, softly citrusy, grassy, floral and leafy hops over a sugary caramel malt base. So is this a maple beer? I don't taste it particularly, though it might be there, but the malt itself is quite nice. I get golden caramel as well as dark caramel and a soft toastiness, and there IS an edge of sugariness to it, but that's balanced by a wonderful spiciness. OK, so let's check the label... yes, there's ""a hint of maple - including big leaf maple - syrup in every brew"". It finishes with a dollop of sweetness, and it is there at the start as well, but mainly the malt and hops take the show. It's surprisingly complex, and yet at the same time really drinkable. It also seems to taste of fall to me. Maybe that's the power of suggestion, but I think the combination of its dry crispness and gentle sugariness somehow reminds me of the season, as does the spiciness, the soft citrus, and the grassy, piney, and leafy side of it as well. It's certainly unique, pleasantly complex, and really well-balanced and polished. Worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 04, 2014"

Aroma was pine and citrus, sweet. It had a slightly creamy mouthfeel which left it kind of sticky, light-medium body and medium carbonation. Got a flash of that maple right away to the taste, but it disappeared quickly, booted out by the big hoppy, citrus, grapefruit characteristics.

Initial smell is juicy fruit and wild berries, followed by grapefruit, unripe peach, wood, and grass.  Malts are biscuity, which the maple syrup compliments nicely. Flavor seems to be maltier to start with a caramel, nutty, maple sweetness, but transforms into something more green, hoppy, and bitter by the finish.  This does help to cut down the sweetness, but the hops lose their initial fruitiness and turn grassy, minty, and piney which results in something more bitter and dry feeling.  Solid medium body and creamy.  Things are skewed a little towards the bitter side and the maple is subtle, but this is still pretty nice in an old-school kind of way.  Despite the mostly ""newer"" hop profile, this seems like something Anchor has always brewed.","wedge","Oct 19, 2014"

Aromas of roasted caramel in the backbone, with subtle sugary maple highlights. Pretty balanced, light, and sweet. Flavors are toasted and tangy caramel, with woody notes, hints of maple sugar sweetness, and a roasted character, with some subtle citrus hops notes peeking through here and there, too. Smooth, light body, with a tangy sweet, almost cloying aftertaste. Light, slightly frothy finish, with a caramel linger.","GarthDanielson","Sep 28, 2014"

Pours lightly hazy orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, wood, light maple, herbal, light pine, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt and hop notes; with decent strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, wood, light maple, pine, herbal, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, apple, pear, caramel, toast, brown sugar, light maple, wood, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of hop and malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice amber ale. Good balance and complexity of malt and hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 12, 2014"

I don't hardly taste maple in this at all, as the hops really overshadow it, if its there at all. a very well made beer though, despite its relative imbalance. fuller body, prickly fine micro carbonation, and a fast finish. a perfect fall beer, not totally dissimilar to sierra nevadas flipside red ipa really.","StonedTrippin","Sep 26, 2013"

Nice hop aromas greet the nose first,herbal and citrus,getting a small amount of caramel from the malts. Taste is far more balanced with the caramel malts ( with tinge of salt) equaling the hops..blends very nice, the maple syrup to me seems more under the radar but is there in a almost subconscious way!

The nose comprises grass, mixed greens, light flowers, and a slight breeze of spearmint. The taste brings in more of the same, with a strong undercurrent of very mild toffee. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, I can't say this is a bad beer; it's not. What I can say is that I didn't care for it: There is no real balance, the hops seem stagnant and out of place, and that weird mint character doesn't endear the beer to my tastebuds.","TMoney2591","Sep 21, 2013"

Finishes semi-dry with residual hop bitterness. Medium bodied with nice active carbonation. The addition of maple to a red ale works out quite well here. Like many Anchor beers, this is safe and non-challenging, but well made and pleasant to drink.

4.3,21.1,4,4,4,5,5,"Wow, this is a really good beer. A bit of a thin body with prickly carbonation. Nice toasty maltiness with big hoppiness and the faintest toach of maple sweetness to balance the bitterness. Very tannic with a very bright clean and crisp finish. Complex yet drinkable, hoppy, malty, and flavorful. Really enjoy it and looking forward to drinking this this fall!","jtierney89","Aug 25, 2013"

4,12.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Bigleaf is a very nice beer. The maple balances the fairly strong hopping, making this taste more like a traditional Amber with a twist as opposed to the in vogue Red IPAs. This makes it a beer that can be enjoyed by the Amber fan and the IPA fan equally. My only complaint is that this beer is replacing the outstanding Humming Ale. Why you gotta play me like that, Anchor?","shand","Aug 23, 2013"

3.23,-9,4.5,4,2.5,4,3,"O- This aroma on this beer was promising, but the flavor missed the mark for me. Lots of harsh bitterness and lots of unpleasant earthy notes. Definitely a bit of a disappointment and really lacking in maple flavor, all you get is some in the aroma and a slightly sticky mouthfeel just like right after polishing off a stack of pancakes.","Hoptometrist","Aug 20, 2013"

Oddly enough, I liked the bottle I drank from the bottle last night a lot better than this one. Probably worth a shot if you see it.","beertunes","Aug 13, 2013"

3.51,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall- I wish there were more maple syrup and the integration were better but it is a Anchor beer, so it is worth a try. Though it's not a beer you would typically cellar, it might be worth the experiment. Above average.","artoolemomo","Aug 09, 2013"
3.75,5.6,4.25,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"This is definitely a rustic amber ale. The maple syrup comes through and the overall flavor is rather earthy. The hops are intense as well with big citrus notes up front followed by a piney, bitter finish. This beer could use a bit of balance as all of the flavors don't mesh as a cohesive unit. That being said this is a nice, hoppy beer that keeps me intrigued.","tdm168","Aug 08, 2013"
