If I had a gun to my head I would say it had a kind of flat finish but that is outweighed  by the initial feel or sneaky hoppy rush.","marcespo","Mar 18, 2015"

Aroma is fresh dough and judiciously used piney hops.  The flavor is a well balanced presentation of amber malt but the hops seem more piney tasting than citrus.  The body is moderately carbonated and overall fairly light for the style.","Franziskaner","Mar 07, 2015"

The more pine like hop notes meld really well with the malts and I’d even like to see a more of the pine than the lighter citrusy notes.  Runoff Red would be a good work week IPA to stock in the fridge; hits all the right notes without dragging.   I’d really like to see what an imperial version of this with a bit of rye and Amarillo hops.","CowsandBeer","Mar 03, 2015"

The color is a nice dark mahogany, again not quite your normal red.  There's a lot of lace on this one too.  This is a winter/spring seasonal and I'm glad I picked up a six-pack, even though it's not my favorite beer style.  I'll try anything from Odell, and this is no exception.","dcscientist","Feb 12, 2015"

The aroma is pine and herbal grassiness with just a hint of brown sugar peeking through. Flavor favors malt more with caramel, shortbread, and biscuit. Hop flavor and bitterness is still firm with another hit of pine, some citrus, and an earthy element that separates it from other big American reds. Slightly resinous, oily mouthfeel along with the pine makes this perfect for a spring evening in the Rocky Mountains.","bump8628","Jun 13, 2012"

Lots of bright citrus (grapefruit) up front with a strong pine behind it, a touch of caramel malt sweetness at the very end of the aroma. The taste is interesting, the malt presence is much more prominent and clashes ever so slightly with the hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkable. Overall this is a good brew but I prefer their IPA. The hop profiles were very similar but I thought they matched better to the dryness of the IPA vs. the maltiness of this beer.

A lot of the nose is noticeable on the pallet, with biscuity and toasty malt sweetness giving way to quite a wallop of citrusy (grapefruit and orange) and piney hop bitterness. A medium-light amount of carbonation is augmented by a medium body that finishes a little spicy and sticky finish. For our money, Odell's is executing the beauty of the hop better then anyone else in Fort Collins.","phishsihq","Feb 19, 2012"

The Red provides a big aroma as well, with lots of flowery hop notes. There is a firm malt base to the flavor, and a big hoppy finish. This beer is closer to an IPA than a traditional red ale, so depending on your tastes you may really like it, or be disappointed. I liked it.

The hops are juicy and flavorful. If there was more balance with this beer I would probably love it. I don't feel it is over hopped, but instead that the malts are not rich and complex enough. Alas, it seems that for the typical American palate, any style that is overrun with American hops becomes a new favorite. Just hop the junk out of it and it will earn an 'A' on BA, no matter how far from the original style it has drifted...","allforbetterbeer","Jun 13, 2011"

The nose straight from the bottle after popping the cap screams hops with loads of pine and a bit of citrus. Really inviting. Great start. A bit of light amber malt in the background, but nowhere near balance. The flavor isn't quite as nice, adding in a bit more malt and just a touch of sweetness. Medium body and really nice bitterness in the finish. Quite a bit of piney hop flavor. Really nice brew overall. Super glad I finally got to try this one. Cheers.","Thorpe429","Apr 14, 2011"

Poured a deep red-orange with a two finger off-white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, pine resin, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, bitter hop, caramel, and slight cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice red. Not a lot missing on this one for the style. Pretty good aroma and flavor both. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness on both accounts. Worth trying and really glad I got a chance to try it as well.","thagr81us","Apr 01, 2011"
