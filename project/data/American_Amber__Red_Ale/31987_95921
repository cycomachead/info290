Tropicals in the nose, with some caramel backing. Taste gives way to standard bittering hop profile less so than some notes of citrus, pine, floral, tropical, etc. Pretty simple toasted grain sweetness balances the bitters.","MisterGone","Feb 28, 2015"

Slightly hazy orange to amber in color with a finger of khaki head that settles to a cap and leaves some patches of lace. Aroma is dank hops, grapefruit, pine, more tropical fruit, and a bit of an herbal note. The malt aroma features caramel and toasred bread. Taste is thoroughly dank and moderately bitter with the tropical fruit and caramel sweetness offering some balance early. Medium body, viscous texture, lower carbonation, and a long bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 27, 2015"

4.29,4.4,3.75,4.75,4.25,3.75,4.25,"So I received this beer via the NBS BIF thread, courtesy of @aoampm.  What is so amazing about this beer is the smell.  I'd say caramel and vanilla, pine with maybe a touch of honey.  Very prominent smell and it is wonderful.  One of the best smelling beers I have had in a long time.  The beer was fresh (1/13/15) and exceptional.  It is called an amber but it seems to be more of an IPA quality to me only because the hops are so abundant.  However, there is plenty of vanilla and toffee sweetness in the taste.  At just under 7% abv, it is not quite an imperial, I suppose.  I love Nugget Nectar, a benchmark  imperial Amber, but give me this over Nugget anytime  Send more :)","FlakyBiscuit","Feb 10, 2015"

I think it's higher than that- it's an Amber/Red but I definitely enjoy this a lot more than the likes of Nugget Nectar which is considered one of the best hoppy Amber/Red ales out there.","Stevedore","Feb 05, 2015"

Took a sip and thought... hey, that's a lot better than I expected - didn't think I should rate it so high because anything is great coming from very low expectation.  After a few sips, I put the beer down and THEN it hits me.  The citrusy hop flavor lingers... for a long time.  It just begs for another sip then another and made me really sad when the can is gone.","daisyapplegirl","Jan 24, 2015"

Some may quibble over the idea that it's an amber at all, since the hop profile is extremely aggressive, but I think there is just enough grain and bready sweetness to keep this one grounded in the style as much as any hoppy amber can be considered to be an amber ale. I really wish I could pick this one up on the regular in my neck of the woods.","LambicPentameter","Aug 20, 2014"

4.2,2.2,4,4,4.25,4,4.5,"Pours reddish amber, good amount of head retention and sticky lacing left behind. While the nose does feature significant dank hops as the can boasts, caramel from the malts comes through very strongly. Earthy and herbal hops present but without too much implied bitterness. The taste delivers exactly as the nose leads on. Plenty of piney hops and caramel malts with a very smooth bitterness. The lack of bite from the hops makes this endlessly drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated. OVerall, this beer is absolutely crushable.","homebrew311","Jun 16, 2014"

Passion fruit, papaya, grapefruit pith, toasty malts in the backbone. Very dry and astringent mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Very good, very interesting beer that is unique in that it has the hop profile of an IPA with the toasted/caramel grain aspects of an amber, while being very dry.","Aaron_Ramson","Feb 20, 2014"

Some sweet citrus notes as well. The taste is the doughy and caramel malts up front followed by the dank hops. Some light pine. I expected more hops and less malt flavor from the aroma but its still solid. Does a pretty good job juggling the malt and hops. Lots of carbonation with a slightly dry mouthfeel.

4.2,2.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Got in a trade with BeerBaron666. 16 ounce can into tulip glass; no canning date, but should be pretty fresh. Pours lightly hazy deep orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion fruit, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, orange rind, floral, grass, light pine, biscuit, caramel, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity of dank citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange rind, caramel, biscuit, floral, grass, light pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon/orange zest, floral, grass, caramel, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of bright citrus/tropical hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome hoppy amber ale. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/tropical hops and bready malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 05, 2014"

Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, grapefruit juice, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

They share a pretty similar hope profile and i must admit i might like this more. If you are a fan of Sculpin you have to check this one out.

Not necessarily bitter hops, but strong-scented fruity hops with lovely malt aromas. The aromas is more hop forward than malty, and I love that from an Amber Ale. Taste is...WOW...amazing. I havent been this blown away from an Amber Ale since I had Nugget Nectar for the first time. It's hilarious that Fat Tire even sits in the same category as this beer. Tons of Nelson hops in the flavor. I pick up a bit of Simcoe, but I'm still not all that familiar with Mosaic hops. The malt profile is subdued compared to the hops, which I love. Drinkability is VERY high. Mouthfeel could be a bit more carbonated. Overall, I really look forward to what these guys bring in the future.

Out of the can, the dankness of the hops is a little muted in a much more drinkable way. It was pretty in your face on tap, so seems counter-intuitive to like the can better, but there's more synergy there (and the batches coulda been quite a bit different, too). So drinkable. One of my favorite new hoppy reds at this point. An everyday hoppy red.","velcrowe","Nov 10, 2013"
