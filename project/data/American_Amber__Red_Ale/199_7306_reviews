"O: I'm a big fan of hoppy reds, but this one is kinda disappointing. A bit too malty for me despite the load of hops. My bottle was pretty fresh and had bite so I'm not sure how much has faded out, but I can imagine this being better super fresh. For now it's just ok."
""
""
""
""
"A bit thin and alcoholic for my tastes."
""
"Overall - While red ales are not my favorite style, I can definitely enjoy them; although I do struggle to review them, as my palate may not be advanced enough to single out certain flavors in this style.  This is a nice, complex beer that I enjoyed and any aficionado of red's should as well."
""
"This has the distinction of being the least enjoyable beer I have had this year. Despite being just 10% ABV, it tasted like pure booze. I could hardly even taste the hops and malts anymore. More boozy than any barleywine, quad, or imperial stout I've had. No balance at all. This beer pretty much turned me off on anything Ballast Point."
""
""
""
"Maybe *slightly* overdoing it in the hop bitterness department."
""
""
"Good taste. Ballast Point never disappoints."
""
""
"Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. Chewy, and has a long, bitter finish."
""
""
"A wonderful hoppy red - juicy, chewy full-bodied beer. It's like hop candy in a bottle.  By the way, the alcohol is so wonderfully covered I didn't realize the abv was so quite so high until I went to enter the review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Incredibly balanced. Resiny hop flavors and sugary sweet malt flavors blend together to provide a feeling of perfection."
"O- Solid imperial red, but I think it's not as balanced as it should be."
""
""
""
""
"Taste:  Crispy carbonation with a bold and heavy mouthfeel.  Syrupy just long enough to be taken over my hop bitterness.  Alcohol hotness forms at the end.  Bitterness, malty sweetness, carbonation, and alcohol all get a chance to show you their stuff during each sip.  It is a heavy beer with lots of medicinal and metallic qualities coming through.  The dryness s pronounced and plays with the bitterness.  Very medicinal at the end."

"A fantastic, deep, rich, complex and nicely balanced beer. The alcohol content remains behind the scenes while the grain bill and hops do the bulk of the work in pleasing your senses. The malt sweetness isn't in your face while the hop bitterness isn't too brash. If big, bold, and beautiful (in a beer) is your thing, then this is one to check out."

"Fans of Imperial Reds should find something to enjoy  about Tongue Buckler, but there is an intense bitterness that may not be for all, and at $10 for a bomber, the value factor is on the low side. I find the recent wave of New England style hoppy Red Ales more to my liking, finding the Simcoe for hopping and dry hopping more appealing personally (Lawson's Steve's Back Yard Red Ale and Fiddlehead Ruby Claire  are my favorite examples of this style). I'd recommend trying it if you can handle a beer that was designed to challenge your palate to a duel!"

"this is crazy beer, super hoppy and not sweet at all, like i often associate red beers as being, or at least ambers, which i expected this to be, you know, heavy with caramel malts and overbalanced. not the case, this one stands as a gnarly big red ipa, super hoppy, a lot of action on this one, resins and pine, grapefruit peel bitterness, and some of the alcohol. its distinct from others in its size but gentle feel, in its refreshment capacity for a strong ale, and in its use of red malt to add character without sweetness. hoppy as can be, but never harsh, just super intense there, and a little hard to drink in mass quantity, but like all beer from ballast point, especially the big strong ones, this is excellent and original beer, worthy at any table."

"Amazing beer. Ballast point keeps me falling in love with the craft every new beer I try."
"A little boozy but the name tells no lies. It's sticky red and hop forward. It'll warm you up going down. There are better in this style but if you like ballast point then this is worthy of a pick up."
""
"Pours a nice red color. Nose is all hops. Taste is hop on the front with a malty finish. Not too boozy for a double digit ABV. Very good."

"O: hop-forward ""American"" Imperial India Amber Ale (new style category!) - essentially a dark IPA Imperialized effectively - big hops, hearty malts - easy-drinking with a hammer of hops to hide the high abv. I really dug it."

"This beer is very complex, and takes some effort to chew through.  Crazy sweet, crazy hoppy, and crazy bitter, however, they don't quite blend harmoniously."

"Overall, a nice big hoppy red.  The alcohol is well hidden."

"Overall: This beer is okay. There are some off-putting elements on the nose that reminds me of cooking brussel sprouts or cauliflower. There is an artificial citrus element as well. I love the big amber style of beer, and I will say that this does not come close to Nugget Nectar or Lagunitas Mondo, which are two of my favorite examples. Overall, I think it falls short because it lacks that clean, crisp and fresh hop character that the others have."

""

""

""

"A pretty decent imperial amber, could be a little cleaner."
""
""
""
"I can't decide if I like it or don't like it, but it certainly is different. This is also definitely not a session beer. Between the 10% abv and a 22oz sized bottle, one is enough to start your head spinning."
"O: Recently there has been a number of IRAs being released and this one is good but does not quite measure up to some of the competition (e.g. oskar blues)"

"This is a very solid Imperial Red Ale. It has just about everything you can look for in the style. It's not flashy or over the top, but it's traditional and well crafted."
""
""
""
""
"A really smooth beer and I enjoyed it very much. It was a good follow up to Bear Republic’s Café 15."
""
""
""
""
""

"But for the price ($10.52 for the 22 oz. at Spec's in Houston), it's not worth it for me. Ballast Point makes some good stuff -- Sculpin might be my favorite IPA. Tongue Buckler is a one-off for me; I shant be walking down this plank again."
"I had a clean palate when I tried this beer. It wasn't nearly as bitter as it's ""off the scale," IBU label description declares. However it's 10% ABV content is hidden well. It's probably the smoothest 10% beer I've ever had. It tastes like a normal 5% Lager. That's where this swash-buckling pirate draws first blood. Deceptively strong is the best way to explain this beer."

"Overall, I think I paid $7 for this, and it’s pretty delicious. Not a pretty beer by any means, but a very good beer."
""

"Despite the size and heft of this beer, it impressively manages a proper medium body. There's a bite all the way through while it remains creamy smooth until the end."

""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied with high carbonation keeps this drinkable through the bold flavors and bitterness."

"Smooth, rich flavor. Aftertaste has a touch of bite consistent with imperial. I am glad that they didn't go overboard on the ""imperial"" that maintains drinkability. Note: Any imperial should have a slight drop in drinkability due to the concentration of flavors."

"Excited to try another of the semi-rare but delicious imperial red ale style. This pour is breaking in my new DFH signature glass. Pours a deep, clear blood red with a thick fluffy off-white head. Smell is boozy caramel malt, completely overshadowed by hops. The hop scents start off with some mild pine/citrus rind, followed by tons of sweet fruit. Taste is sweet toasted malt, a sudden wave of booze carrying tons of juicy and bitter hop flavors with it. Finishes with sticky sweetness rolling in bitterness and the heat left over from the alcohol. Definitely a sipper, but great if you like big hoppy beers."

"Iam a big fan of uber hopped imperial reds so here we go!Poured into an imperial pint glass a clear rich bronze color with a billowing one and a half finger off white head that spits and shoots into a craterous mass leaving a full ring of lace behind.Herbal and grassy hops with a tinge of pine resin,not a big malt profile wich surprised me a little,but I loved the hops.Not quite as full as I would have liked in the mouth,not watery but for the style I may have liked a little more fullness.Flavors of alcohol dipped malty-gummy fruitiness and brown sugar then more of a herbal/leafy hop flavor that turns into a big of grapefruit rind,as I drink more the complexities unfold more.There is a nuttiness that keeps the beer from becoming overly sweet and boozy.At first the beer didn't impress much but as I drank more it impressed more."
""
"22oz bottle, best by 4/17/2014, pours red-copper topped with a creamy beige head that holds great retention.  Aromas are toasty grain, caramel, earthy, piny, citric hop.  Tastes include a sharp bite of bitter hops up-front, piny, pungent, grapefruit, burnt caramel, brown sugar, bread crust, earth, prickly booze.  Creamy yet resiny mouth-feel, medium-full body, moderate carbonation.  Overall, nice Imperial Red, but there are some better ones out there, in particular one lucky one that is half the price..."

"This is quite good and I'm happy to have had this available semi-locally as a welcomed impromptu pick up. I enjoyed this much more than any bottle of Sculpin I've enjoyed and hazarded to guess at its relative freshness. A nice big boisterous bomb of Imperial redsiness."
""
""
""
""
"O – I was expecting much more of a hop bomb here but it is not that. It is a well balanced flavorful brew. Nice balanced taste. I enjoyed this one. Goes down easy..maybe too easy at 10%!"
""
""
"O - Yesterday I heard about this beer on this site and thought to myself ""that sounds delicious."" Today, I walked into Whole Foods (as I do weekly) and saw it for the first time in my life. Funny how those things work. It lived up to my expectations and then some. I'm a sucker for hoppy imperial reds, but this is one fine beer. I'm yet to try a bad beer by Ballast Point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in weight, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a smooth and slightly foamy mouthfeel. Ethanol can be felt as heat and mild burn in the nostrils and back of throat throughout. Leaves substantial stickiness on the lips and palate after each sip. Enjoyable mouthfeel, given the heaviness of ingredients and resulting ethanol content."
""

""
""

"The beer pours a dull rusty amber with a thin blanketing of off-white head that dissipates into a thin halo that laces. The nose is definitely alcohol and caramel forward with robust, earthy/piney hops in the background...maybe a bit of B.O. and leather. The taste has a mild caramelized sweetness, which is overwhelmed by the abrasive and intrusive hop profile. I have no respect for >100 IBU beers that can't mitigate the gross, grapefruit rind bitter aftertaste...which this one seems to push to the max. As the beer warms the malt sweetness pops a bit more, but it really doesn't do much to cut down on the insane bitterness. This is a reasonably priced, shelf-ready bomber...that I will probably never drink again."

"O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid flavorful stronger beer to drink for a as long as you can handle it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Kinda reminds me of the War of Jenkins's Ear, only with a tongue. Yeah. This stuff pours a clear midnight garnet-copper topped by a finger of dirty cream foam. The nose comprises sweet caramel, light leek, pine resin, and light spicy greens. The taste brings in more of the same, with less leek and a light menthol character in the finish. Unfortunately, what is present--in abundance--is the clash between the caramel and the resin, which are apparently acting out a centuries-old feud right on my tongue. Buckle, my ass, it's a fucking raze job! The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this just didn't work for me, as the hops and the malts just clash far too much for any enjoyment to result."

"Overall - Not a bad beer by any means, but nothing I'd particularly care to pick up again. Tastes more like a barley wine than a red ale. Good to try once. Not terribly impressed, especially considering the typical quality that Ballast Point puts out."
"I would never drink this beer again unless someone bought it for me."
"O: An interesting take on an imperial Red Ale. I really enjoy Ballast Point's beers, but I feel this one neglects some of the balance that defines the great beers they make. I would still try it again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brown to amber. Darker in color with a slightly cloudy look. Healthy head - at least a finger and quality lacing. Smell is dominated by a great hop aroma and slightly balanced with some malts. Taste is good with malt and candimsugar more present with the hops some hidden well. Spicy. Good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"First sip and wow. Big bitter hop goodness. Herbal, piny, and resinous. Lots of sweet malt fills in quickly, though, providing some reprieve. Fruity, caramel-y, and figgy. Scotch tape and pine resin bitterness fights back, winning the battle for hoppy bitterness into the finish. Warming. Dries out a lot in the finish, but there is still some lingering fruity malt sweetness. Full-bodied and chewy. Nice."
"Overall not the cleanest of finishes but very flavorful and fun to drink."
"Overall – Wow.. a lot of hops going on here. I've been looking for this one for a while and it doesn't disappoint. It is definitely over the top flavour wise.. it has a lot of sugary sweet flavours and a giant dose of hops."
""
""
""
"Bottle from Lueken's Liquors. A smooth mouthfeel, with an initial maltiness followed by a pleasant citrusy hop finish. Well integrated blend of malt and hops, the perfect imperial red beer. Another master craft from this brewery. Above average mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O) A decent Imperial Red but leaves a lot to be desired. I would take Great Lakes Nosferatu over this one in a second. It is almost too bitter for my taste but overall, a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
"o - really good red ale and one i'll seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"A fairly clear copper-brown color with a proud oatmeal colored head and plenty of chunky lacing. The aroma offers a deep nutty malt and pine hop and a bit of toffee alcohol. Very nice! The flavor brings a very sweet pine malt with a nice leafy bitterness and a somewhat boozy finish. There's plenty of graham cracker-rye grain goodness mixed with the grassy-pine. This beauty is medium-full bodied with a frothy carbonation and feel. This is yet another triumphant effort from Ballast Point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I wasn't really impressed with this beer."
"O: I wouldn't classify this as an Imperial Red Ale (which is how Ballast Point describes it on the bottle), but rather as an American Strong Ale, along the lines of Stone's Double Bastard - though like I said, at times this even brings to mind an American Barleywine. Definitely a ""big"" beer, with the alcohol announcing its presence and telling you to slow down."
""
""
"M: Medium bodied. Not as bitter as expected."
""
"It's a nice beer for sure, but the name makes it not as enjoyable as I was expecting a hugely bitter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Especially given my love of Ballast Point's hoppy beer, this is a touch of a letdown. The heaviness & ingredients that appear to be sparring with one another means this one only lands in the pretty good airfield."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a reasonably good hoppy red ale. But there is more caramel malt than I'd like, and I'd think a fruitier hop profile would have helped here. Not bad, but not my favorite american red by a long shot."
""
""
"O - ""Amber"" and ""Red"" ales are not normally high on my list of favorites because I usually find them to be too pedestrian for my tastes. This beer changes that and I appriciated the assertive (aggressive?) flavor profile and abv. Packs a punch for the price point, and I'll be buying again."
"pour is copper brown with a light brown head and lots of mid size bubbles. Nose is lots of toasted bread and grain with a powerful citrus and pine hop behind it. Lightly green and sweaty. Taste is much of the same, a bit stale piney hop with citrus notes, strong bread crust and cooked caramel. Body is lighter with decent carbonation but a bit of a grainy feel in back."
"Pours a deep, opaque red/mahogany with a thick light brown head that dissipates down to about a half finger. Nose is super hoppy. Pine, tangerine, caramel, grapefruit, molasses and brown sugar. The taste is pine, grass, red grapefruit, black tea, caramel, toffee and bitter orange. Pine explodes and quickly turns into tart grapefruit then plunges into caramel/toffee with a hint of grassy bitterness and some notes of black tea (almost like unsweetened iced tea) that all fades out into a bitter orange and caramel that clings onto the tongue and doesn't let go. This ""red ale"" is a better DIPA than many beers that are classified as DIPAs (I'm looking at you Palate Wrecker!). Very awesome, love me some Ballast Point."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a big amber ale and I would definitely think it was a barleywine if not told otherwise, but this is tasty either way."
"Well, needless to say, my hopes are high for this one. I love Ballast Point, and I love big, hoppy reds. Tongue Buckler pours a hazy blood-red color with a tiny head. The aroma is robustly malty, with a touch of citrus hops. The taste is excellent, this is a big, brash beer with a huge caramel malt kick and bitter pine notes. An explosion of flavor right to your taste buds. The mouthfeel is, well, big. It's got a thicker mouthfeel that suits the beer quite nicely, and the drinkability is great. Overall, this is a great, big imperial red. Bold and delicious."
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed this brew although it's not my favorite imperial red or Ballast Point offering. They say on the package that it's gonna attack your palate, and it does. A successful beer and reminds me of a hop heavy beer from Stone. I'd have this one again."
""
"I love Ballast Point. Took a tour of their brewery in San Diego and sampled some tasty brews. However, this ale is a miss for me."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 4/17/2014. Pours lightly cloudy ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, lemon zest, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright citrus hops and moderate caramel malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness. Moderate amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, caramel, toast, floral, grass, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of bright citrus/pineapple hops and light-moderate caramel/bready malts; with balanced and crisp malt/bitterness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red ale! All around great complexity and balance of bright hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."
""
"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, dry and sticky on the tongue. This is borderline over the top, but I still enjoyed the intensely bitter profile. If the booze was turned down a notch, it might make this a little easier to drink."
"Still it's overall not too bad, there is some masking of the large abv on this but not totally. I don't think I'd have this again."
""
"Would pair well with simple hearty bread. The outback steakhouse's brown bread comes to mind for some reason. Am I rambling?"
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice big hoppy Imperial Red. Good strong hop profile and bitterness throughout with enough malt flavor to balance things out a bit."
""
""
"O - I'm not a fan of red ales and this one is one of the best ones I've experienced since Stone's 13th Anniversary. It's an assertive red ale with some really interesting blends of dark fruit and citrus without a predominant caramel/toffee malt presence which takes a backseat in this particular beer. I'd like another one, please. (!!)"
"Overall, it let itself down somewhat. This beer looks great, and smells great, and I expected something great when I put my lips to the glass. Unfortunately, even though it was good, this meant that it didn't deliver on its promises: it should have been magnificent."
""
""
"Overall a very good imperial red."

"Glad to have tried it. Not a bad double red, but not as interesting as I would have hoped."
""
""

"o - Overall I think this was a pretty good hoppy red ale. Nice citrus hops up front in the nose and more in the taste. Light bitterness but not too bad; would like to have it again."

"O- Decent beer, smells great but the taste doesn't hold up."
""
"O: While I liked it, I would not be ordering this a whole lot because it is a chore to drink."
""
""
"Mouth and taste come in huge. Big-ass body with cloy and caramel/molasses flavors enhancing the feel. The hops never let this big viscous malt take over, and bite along the way. A little drying impact to clean up the cloy and some tropical notes to ""juicify."" If I sit the last tiny sip out overnight, I will have a sticky/gummy yield in the morning. This is not a clean tasting beer, but what pirate wants that?!?! This is a strong-ass American beer with that west coast signature."
""
"O/D-This brew is brutish in both malt and hop. A supremely intense drink. It will take me a while to finish this, but I really enjoy beers of this magnitude. Tongue Buckler is a great name for this; it fits the beer well. At nearly $10 a bomber it is pricey; but if you're looking for a beer to literally burn away the uvula in the back of your throat, this is the beer to choose."
""

""
""
""
""

"O: a pretty good beer, reminds me of bitter tropical fruit punch.... I wish the lingering bitterness was toned down a notch here as I am not a big fan of the aftertaste. It is deffinatly worth giving a whirl though, grows and grows on me everytime i drink it."
""
""
""
""
"Really good strong amber. Hops forward and flavorful. Big but all works out nicely."
""

"Overall a mild tasting Barleywine that kicks you in the head like a Mule."
""
"O-a solid imperial red ale with decent balance and body"
"Pours a clear, dark amber red color with a LARGE off-white egg-shell color that goes down slowly. Scent is quite malt forward, with plenty of sweet caramel malt aromas. There is also a ton of hop resin in the nose. A little bit of that lovely cat piss aroma we get from some hoppy beers as well. Taste is initially sweet, and the sweetness actually lingers. Very bitter in the middle, but starts out smooth and ends rather smooth. Nice malt profile to compliment the intense hop profile. With each sip, the bitterness tends to intensify, which is rather unique. Definite lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue, while the front of the tongue leaves a nice sweet candy flavor. Burnt malts as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated for this particular style. Drinkability is scary for how high the ABV is. Overall, this is another great hoppy offering from Ballast Point. Sweeter than I had expected, but not overly sweet."
"O - I like double/triple IPAs quite a bit, and Sculpin is high on my list, but this brew doesn't have a flavor or finish that propels it even close to the top of my BA ratings. I finished the 2nd half of the bomber the next day and liked it better than on day one because the excessive bitterness had faded enough to let the malt profile show through a bit."
"Overall, this is a great take on the style. Excellent flavors!"
"22oz bottle. Picked this up at City Beer Store in San Francisco. Pours a dark, slightly clear, ruby amber colour. Decent head. Tastes very bitter, and quite malty with a almost caramal like finish. Decently hoppy as well, and the name follows suit. It makes your tongue tingle and sing. Very nice beer overall, and a style I would like to try more of."
"Overall, a fantastic looking beer that is solid all around. mmmm- eye candy. I wish the taste were a bit more complex or followed up with more/different late hops."
""
"Complexity, character and density of flavors adds up to a quality brew thats well worth seeking out."
"O - I have only tried a few red ales so my experience is not much, let alone this imperial red ale which is my first. If someone were to ask me if i ever tried any imperial red ales this one would definitely come to mind. I would buy again if i were in the mood for a imperial red ale."
"I would have again actually."
""
""
"D: Big Brew for sure. All things considered this is a nice brew given the Imperial quality. Teeters the scales at times but really comes along as you make your way through the drink. Should please both hops and malt lovers but watch yourself with this one at 10% ABV."
""
""
""
""
"This brew poured a nice copper color leaving 2 fingers worth of a khaki head and great lacing. The aroma consisted of citrus, light grass, pine and pepper. The taste was a combination of spicy and citrusy, leaving your palate very dry. Overall it was a very pleasant beer and one I would seek out if you're a hop head."
"Pours a beautiful, brilliant garnet shade with one of the sexiest foam crowns I've seen. Easily 2-3 fingers thick, the head is still over a finger thick by the time the glass is half finished. Insane. The nose is loaded with rich vanilla, some caramel, and a healthy dose of malt. The taste has a good dose of hops that were noticeably absent in the nose. Lots of caramel in this. Awesome. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a sublime biterness to it. It's not sour OR tart...but you can see where the tongue buckling comes into play. I've never encountered a beer where the hops greatest presence was in the finish. Very very unique. Overall, this rules. Want more."

"O: Overall, I applaud Ballast Point for bringing more of a pirate theme to their bottling labels. That was one of the biggest weaknesses of the brand. The beer is less abrasive than expected; good, if pretty big, amber. Hides the alcohol well."
""
""
""
""
"O - a decent ""IPA"" with an interesting malt profile."
"M: Very much a red ale, verging towards Black red ale with the roasted undertones. It's not as hoppy as one might expect it to be though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: So amazing this beer is. I always get it on tap whenever u see it at my local san diego brew pubs. Bad ass beer that provides full crazy amounts of flavor. So amped there bottling again. "
""
"D - Drink it till it hurts, baby!"

"Overall this is a very nice example of a West Coast Amber Ale. Plenty of dank, resinous, citrusy hops to balance a mellow but substantial caramel maltiness. Very easy to drink and dangerous @ 10%ABV. Not my favorite of the style but definitely worth a go if you see it on tap. Not mind-blowing but super solid beer."
"O: Very nice for the hop head in all of us but not an easy drinker - the hops are really intense and the name of the beer is appropriate. Probably would be amazing with the correct food pairing but on it's own it is a little difficult to consume much of."
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a slow sipping beer that will catch up to you quickly. Not a bad beer, a bit over the top for me."

"Pours a clear dark copper with a beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thick chunks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grapefruit, citrus zest, and a slight alcohol kick. Taste is of malt, grapefruit extract, and very bitter citrus zest. The bitterness with each sip is quite assertive and lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a somewhat full bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but it is extremely bitter just like the name implies."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the big hops in both the nose and the taste. The aroma is damn near perfect, with a certain cleanliness and crispness to it. While the hops were so robust, the malts beautifully balanced this beer. The alcohol is hidden expertly, and the flavors all melt together. This is one of the best beers we’ve had in a long time."

"This imperial red poured an amber color with a short beige head. Its` nose has pine resin, grapefruit, toasted malts and hops. This is a smell that creates anticipation of the beer and is quite nice. Upon sipping it, I taste oranges, pine, some more hops, all well balanced together with some of the other flavors. MF is medium with a good amount of carbonation. All in all, this is a very good beer, which I have never seen on a shelf in metro NY; so it was nice to enjoy it on draft."

"Deep red/amber color witha finger of off-white foam. Thick, sticky lacing. Caramel malt and citrus hops in the nose. Taste follows true to form with a big caramel presence up front. The malt is offset by huge citrus hop bitterness on the back end. There's mango, tangerine and a bit of pineapple. Some booze is apparent in the finish and there's a lingering bitter aftertaste. The beer is full bodied, quite thick and viscous. Medium level of carbonation. A good imperial red, emphasis on the imperial. I like the combination of caramel malt and hoppiness, but the 10% ABV starts to wear on me a little as I near the bottom of the pint. A good brew for a chilly November evening."

"O - Everything about this beer is good but nothing mind-blowing. Recommended."
"CHEERS"
"Overall I think I blew it by aging this too long. I thought it would be ok, given the alcohol level. After reading other reviews, it seems like I'm missing out on a lot of hop flavor."
"Had a goblet at Liberty St. Tavern. The alcohol was well hidden, but overall this was a thick beer without as many stand-out flavors as I'd have liked for something this strong. The hops were juicy, with a citrus rind finish, but lacked depth for such a big beer. The malts were also fairly big, with a soft bready character, but oddly indistinct. Finally, the bitterness, likely thanks to the residual sugar, was far too balanced for anything with the name ""Tongue Buckler."" I don't want to give the impression that this is a bad beer, but when we're talking about 10% ABV hop-bombs, there are better options."
"This offering is a puzzler. I am a genuine hop fan and I loved this beer for its aggressive hop profile. However, there must be some minimum style standards adhered to so that we beer nuts can compare apples with apples. This is simply NOT a red, as it is not at all true to style. I am not sure what it actually IS other than a tasty big beer. Let's just go with that, ok?"
"It's interesting to compare what I think was a super-fresh keg against this one which has been on for many days now. The fresh keg was more astringent and biting (in a good way) but maybe with a little less nuance...while the hops seem to have fallen off a bit in the older keg, allowing more fruit to come forward albeit with more sweetness."
"I can't find what hops these are, but they do a good job of bittering. This tastes like they took a batch of Sculpin and dosed it with quinine. The color is a nice orange mahogany with really good lacing in the tulip glass. Aroma of roast malt. I'm not sure what the point of this exercise is. Anything for research, but after a few sips I'm grateful I don't have to finish it."
"Flowing at Smokin' Joe's in the Southside pours a copper hue with a light off shade of white head, big chunks of lacing. Aroma has big abrasive pine/caramel blended with some dank smelling herbaceous goodness, quite a nose with a some booze edging in this good just as easily be a barleywine in most beer cultures. Flavor again earthy herbaceous and citrus peel accented hops bring a strong bitterness full big booze and big caramel malts with a bit of dirt/mineral quality going on. Alcohol is soothing and fits within the massive arrangement of this beer, never seen bottles in the Burgh but definitely scattered on a limited basis on tap. Mouthfeel was big a bit harsh with bitterness and alcohol but I new what I was getting into when I ordered this one. Overall a high quality big aggressive West Coast Tongue Buckler, meaning it pretty much assaults your palate with intense flavor."
"Overall: The beer was very good. This wet sock hop aroma that I see in some imperial beers and IPAs is a bit of a turn off before the taste. Otherwise a decent beer."
"This one lives up to its name - hopheads only - loved it..."
"Poured ontap into a snifter. Deep brown in color with a small white cap. Aroma is full of sugary malt and floral hops. In the flavor, deep peaty malt notes and grapefruit rind like hops. Very close to a scotch ale with a sweet and unexpected maltyness. For 100 IBU the bitterness is moderate. Sweet malts battling a good dose of hops kind of overshadows the lofty alcohol. A hybrid style, Scotch IPA is what it had me thinking."
"Great brew that would really go well on a cold night."
"O- Big Red. It's a great selling-point, but I can't think of a reason to finish this, let alone try it again. The beer is enjoyable for a little while, and makes ""lesser"" beers seem wimpy. Beyond that, this beer just becomes flabby, and an apparent product of indecisiveness."
"O: I didn't notice the alcohol in this beer, but (comparatively for the style) it was still a little slower-drinking because of its size and the malt bill. A good Imperial Red, that (I believe) would benefit greatly from some more hopping."
"D - There is good drinkability here. It goes down good and the flavor is great. I could easily drink a few of these in a night, even considering the alcohol percentage. Overall, I thought this was a really nice beer, and really good for the style. One of the best Red Ales I've had so far. Definitely tasty and I recommend trying it."
"An aight hoppy amber. Its way too big and the hop profile doesn't suit me."
"Amber red in color with an ornage hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a decent beige head that reduced to a wispy cap that left nice sticky lacings on the glass. Aroma consisted of a nice balance of sweet caramel malt and ripe tropical fruit, grapefruit and orange. On the thicker side of medium bodied with a resinous feel from beginning to end and robust carbonation. Grapefruit, and ripe pineapple hop flavors, with hints of floral hop as well and a strong, very sweet caramel malt backbone. Alcoholic heat is well defined from the middle to the end, making this one a sipper. Finishes with a touch of bitterness that lingers briefly along with the heat of the higher abv."
"Pours a clean and clear coppery amber with cap of dense khaki head, good retention and lacing. Scent is filled with notes of resinous and grapefruity hops, solid carmel malt backbone with light nuttyness - almost barleywineish with a kiss of booze. Taste follows scent, solid malt backbone, carmely, malty and nutty with strong resinous hops, touches of citrus and bread and booze. Fuller side of medium bodied, palate coating, oily. More akin to a mild barleywine then imperial amber - strong malt backbone with solid hop profile and hefty body."
"Overall not bad, very bitter and hoppy but earthy grassy chewy hops, plenty of darker crystal malts, little syrupy though and finish is a bit too harsh."
"Sampled this one on tap at the Ballast Point Brewery/Home Brew Mart in San Diego. Poured a dark amber color with a little beige head. Aromas of juicy hops, citrus, toasted malt and sweet caramel. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of citrusy hops, oranges, caramel and sweet malt. Very hoppy, without a bitter finish."
"Huge citric and caramel aromas, but they're overwhelmed by an even more powerful alcohol presence. The taste is similarly frustrating, surprisingly even more boozy than it smells. Kind of a weird doughy tanginess as well. A great citrusy hop profile and scorching bitterness battle for attention, but this battle creates anything but a smooth drinking experience. Something seems to have gone amiss here."
"OA - this is a one of a kinder! Have to take it easy on these!"
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured red-orange with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet amtl, citrus, citrus hop, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grapefruit, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. Nice aroma going on here and a very complex flavor. This one made the citrus shine throughout. The alcohol on the followthrough was very noticeable. Everything seemed to work really well together. A definite must try and a great example of the style."
"O - 40 taps in the bar, at least 20 solid ones, and this was the only beer I had more than once. Better beer than the sum of its scores."
"T: A pretty good hit of citrus hops upfront with a bit of a peppery bite, then some caramel malts and a slight breadiness on the finish. Not bad at all, but not Ballast's best."
"Alcohol stays warm on you in this one."
"My second beer was an Orkney SkullSplitter, which I've had countless times, and this beer made every sip of my Skullsplitter have a hoppy finish as well!"
"O - I really enjoyed the first half of this drink, but then it became reminiscent of the DFH 90 Min, which isn't a good thing for me. Very sweet caramel/fruit malts are too much for the hops to overcome. Alcohol burn is unsettling as well."
"Cloudy brownish-red with a frothy tan head. Lots of scattered lacing with solid head retention. Very resiny aroma, pine and crystal malt, grapefruit, light alcohol presence. Similar on the palate, not particularly sweet but heavy on crystal malts and sticky, resiny hops. Grapefruit, pine, plenty of lingering bitterness in the finish that balances the heaviness of the malt. Alcohol is fairly well-hidden, though there's a slight sting toward the finish. Very easy to drink for such a big beer."
"D: Malt-forward and boldly flavored, this imperial red ale leaves a definite impression on the beer-memory but is held back by the ever-present sweetness. Still, taken piece-by-piece most of its qualities hold up under scrutiny--especially the cleverly-hidden 10% abv--but taken together they fail to really wow."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery, this beer was served in a pint glass. The beer was a hazy copper-orange coloring with a thin film of head. Citrus and booze on the nose, with caramelly sweet tones mixed in. The flavors were caramel and citrus sweet touching down on the front tongue, but they are quickly overpowered by bitter and sour flavors around the sides and back of the tongue. Caramel and sour characteristics stay through to the aftertaste. The beer is surprisingly light bodied, but the finish is in for the long haul. Booze accompanies all the flavors listed throughout here, but remains a supporting cast member throughout. Very interesting and tasty brew!"
"A true tongue-buckler. This beer has earned its name, perhaps the most bitter non-DIPA I've ever had. Tasty, but not incredibly drinkable."
"O - Nice, well rounded strong ale, malty, hoppy, and redish all at the same time, mixed in with a homebrew kinda vibe. Thumbs up for a different style!"
"Overall, the age shows a bit as it is malty. However, the hops really showed and that surprised me. Very bitter."
"D - Reminds me a bit of fresh Flying Mouflan. Strongly hoppy and bitter. Definitely lives up to the name - the bitterness is a bit bracing and in your face. I'm enjoying this beer, but it is certainly not an easy drinker...tends more towards being a sipper. I started the night with this bomber and I think this is where my night is going to end too. This 22 is a session in itself."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is caramel and toffee malts with some nice fruit tones. The aroma smells very sweet. The flavor is caramel and chocolate malt with a good amount of orange and pine hops. The malt backbone goes very well with the strong hop profile. Medium bitterness overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - I could see why people would like this but it is not my bag."
"Pours a bright reddish brown with a compact tan head. Mild lacing. Off the nose I get malt, toffee and grapefruit. The taste is rich malt along with a the grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is superb...Medium body and super smooth fine carbonation. Overall a very tasty imperial red."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. Poured a copper-amber color with a semi-translucent clarity. Pour exposes a quarter inch off-white head that dissipates into a skim and a cluster of bubbles, but refreshes with a swirl. Some spots and strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals caramel, toffee and some grapefruit notes. Taste consistent with nose, all on a big, malty backbone. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a consistent background carbonation. I am really growing to appreciate Ambers, and Tongue Buckler is definitely a standard for the style."
"M: The alcohol content is well masked but this is a beer that tastes like it is strong and definitely needs to be sipped."
"D: The alcohol doesn't necessarily show itself in the course of the smelling or tasting of the beer, but it does make itself known (and not surprising at 10%). Still a nice beer, but it can sneak up on you."
"This was a bit of a letdown from Ballast Point, coming off just way too sweet in it's profiles at times. I would have liked for those West Coast hops to shine just a wee bit more. That being said, this still had a very impressive mouthfeel for a 10% beer. This was overall decent but I expected just a little more here."
"D: Imperial reds are a funny beast; not too many people make them (that I'm aware of), especially in this area. I love the Lagunitas take on the style, and Nugget Nectar is good but falls short due to certain smell associations that this beer also shares. However, what kills the interest in this one for me is the $12 / bomber price. It's a good beer for the style, but when there's a beer I enjoy more that costs less, I'm not going to spend much time on this one."
"M & D - Really a very tasty treat, but its a pallet destroyer for sure. Pair it with a good meal."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my tumbler. appears a hazed deep crimson amber color with a good two fingers of light rust colored foam. The head leaves a nice lacing in its wake. Nose and flavors consist of huge bitter citrus notes such as white and red grapefruit juice, pith , and peel, toasted sweet caramelized malts, pine, toffee, floral notes, certainly on the bitter side. Medium to full bodied with ample carbonation. Very bitter after each sip and swallow. Somewhat dry as well. Decent overall."
"22oz bottle. Red-brown with a creamy beige head. A piney and spicy hop nose with light alcohol and toasted malt and caramel. The flavor has a lot of classic pine and grapefruit hops and a fat caramel and toffee malt balance. Very bitter and pretty dry for how malty it is. There is a little alcohol in the finish, but the burn balances the malt well. Very enjoyable, with a medium body and creamy carbonation that is perfect for this beer. I love how they got lots of malt flavor to balance the hops, but attenuated it enough to have just about as lean and drinkable a beer as you get at this size."
"A very enjoyable Imperial Red from Ballast Point."
"The colour of this beer was a dark amber. The aroma was a hoppy smack in the face! I couldn't detect much else as the hops were predominant. On the palate, WHOA! A hop caliope! Geez! Citrusy hops galore, sweet, resinous and an extremely long finish that ruined my palate for the rest of the night (but in a good way!)."
"Drinkability: Pretty syrupy and hot at times, but otherwise a solid imperial amber. I recommend splitting this with someone else."
"D - While not as severe as, say, Stone Ruination, Tongue Buckler is aptly named. The hop presence is quite aggressive, yet it still maintains its drinkability for such a hoppy red ale."
"-some interesting stuff throughout the whole experience. each level seemed to have something different going on. and it changed a bit once it warmed up too. an odd drink for me but i really enjoyed it"
"A very nice red ale. Would recommend any hop lover check out."
"Thanks to MASPuros for this one. 22oz bottle served in a Duvel tulip. Poured a pretty amber/red color with about two fingers of light tan head. Big piney hop aroma with a fair amount of malt. It's pretty bitter, but not as much as the aroma might suggest. Nice malt base with some sweetness in the middle. Maybe of bit of oxidation, but in a good way. Some dry mouth pucker from the hops in the finish. Nice balance of malt and hops. The hops are not as over the top as you would think from the name (or maybe I'm just jaded!) To me, this is pretty much a barley wine, but you don't have to label it, just enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation."
"Overall, a really good bitter but not too bitter beer. Another great beer from an outstanding brewery. Highly recommend. A/R - not avail here in TX so got some shipped from Milt in SD. If here, I'd get a couple per release. As is, would get at least 1 shipped per year. [M/OR;y;Sy]"
"Very good beer, almost like two beers in one...a DIPA combined with a Red Ale, very complex and something you don't taste everyday."
"D - Can't tell its 10% until you're done! ;)"
"D: Usually with a beer this big like a barleywine, the bomber would last 2-3 hours, but 20 minutes into this one I had about 8 oz. left in the pint glass. Just a beautifully drinking beer for it's strength. A fantastic Imperial ale, I really just can't say enough good things about it."
"D- Couldn't have too many of these. But they sure are good."
"Very easy to drink but at 10% I'm not sure how long I oould drink this."
"A monster beer. Thick and hoppy as hell. Full of resiny oily hops from front to back. Thick caramel, red currant, plum, stone fruits. Pine with a bit of earthyness. Very bitter and chalky on the finish. But it should be with this amount of IBU's. A toung buckler indeed."
"Before going into this beer, I had heard it was so bitter that it would rip your face off and make your tastebuds curdle. Well, it's not THAT intense, but it is one bitter mother of an amber ale...a friend compared it to Nugget Nectar or steroids. However, what I enjoy about NN is that it utilizes more hop flavor, whereas Tongue Buckler focused more on hop bitterness, as it coated the tongue with raw, leafy hop cones and alpha acids galore. The amber malts are sturdy in the background, giving the body a medium-thick consistency and semi-creamy mouthfeel. Lingering bitter bite lasts throughout the finish. This is a beer for the geeks...Ballast Point has a winner with Tongue Buckler, my only ""beef"" is that I'd like to see a bit more hop flavor complimenting the massive bitterness."
"Sadistic blood orange pour into the Duvel glass. Quite the devil. Very inviting looking...crimson red with a striking off-white frothy 3"" head. Chill hazy...ominous. Aroma of hot citrus glaze on a piping hot waffle with pineapple singing backup. Big ole flavor of spruce tips and thick indian river grapefruit. So balanced for such a big ole crunchy hop bomb. Perfumey as hell in the mouth yet the tongue buckler sensation was omnipresent. Rich, malty taste and I get hints of bittersweet chocolate and toffee somewhere. So aromatic hop nasty yet so rich and malty. Citric piney overhand then a sweet uppercut maly smack. This one is a winner!"
"- Says 10% Alc. I don't really buy it.. especially after slamming the whole bomber.. I usually get a bit more of a kick out of one... but if it was... it was well hidden by the bitterness... otherwise a smooth malt profile."
"Tongue Buckler is more of a Mind Buckler to me. How Ballast Point managed to pull off this beer without any major leakage of alcohol deserves props. An excellent beer, but watch your consumption: it drinks more like 7% ABV than its listed 10% ABV."
"Very bitter and hoppy in the mouthfeel. What can I say, another outstanding beer from Ballast Point."
"Notes: This is a very tasty Imperial Red! It's uber-hoppy with not much in the way of malts to get in the way. The super flavorful, intensely bitter hop bill does a good job of hiding the alcohol in taste, but the warmth of the ethanol kind of hinders the drinkability of this one. Maybe with a little age, this one will really come into its own. Don't plan on using your tongue for anything important afterwards!"
"A very fine beer, like we expect anything else from BP. It is a bruiser though, and it is a beer that can only be enjoyed in small quantities, but boy is it a huge beer. Nicely done."
"Drinkability: Fun to taste for a hop head, but a tough one to consume in any quantity; one of the most aggressive beers I have ever tasted"
"D - Drinkability is good for a 10%-er. This is a BIG red with a huge hop presence. The ending bitterness is just a tad too much for me. Actually, I kept sipping on this one to avoid the unrelenting bitterness at the end but that just brought forth (and amplified) the heat from the alcohol. That pretty much brings this category down a notch or two. Glad I got to try it though and can't help but love the name and label."
"This one initially poured all head. Settled into a medium to deeper orange color. Aromas of pine, toasty, caramel, and citrus. Tastes of citrus, caramel, a little fruity, pine and floralness. Tastes definitely nice and hoppy but also had a nice balance. Medium alcohol burn in the finish. Lacing left on the glass. Piney hoppy burps."
"Tongue Buckler is a damn good Imperial Red. The hops are very aggressive and bitter, but my tongue's still in tact and in its proper home. Given my love for all things hoppy and bitter, I like this beer...a lot actually. Much to my surprise, I believe I'd like it a little better if it were slightly less hoppy. It seems like some of the malty sweetness that's desired in an Imperial Red is just a little lost in the shuffle. The aftertaste is also a tad too intense and resiny. Just needs a slight tweak there. Still a very tasty beer that's more than certain to satisfy any hophead. Seek out a bottle and see if your tongue's up to the challenge."
"D: Very drinkable. We split the bomber with a few people and it was gone before we knew it."
"D: As drinkable as a 10% beer is going to get. That being said it's still 10% hah!"
"Overall not bad, actually very, very good. Straddles the line of several styles, but I would call it a strong ale as a catch all. A bit strong and young still, this would serve up great after 6 months I am sure."
"The drinkabilty is good as you can get for 10% abv. A must try if you can find this rare beer!"
"Big body and big ABV, along with plenty of carbonation give a good full (and somewhat astringent) mouthfeel, the aftertaste is refreshing and a bit sharp to the tongue. We'll see what happens with a little more time spent in the bottle...it might just kick it up a point or so overall."
"Nice mouthfeel. Delicious."
"D: Drinkable for an enormous ale (how many 10% red ales are out there, anyway?) though a definite palate wrecker / tongue buckler for me. I will finish up this bomber, but I would be happy with 12 oz. or so and this isn't really something I would buy frequently. A very well done ale, but the spiciness and high ABV aren't things that I seek out in a red ale."
"So I pull out some Danish Blue and aged Cheddar and the journey is enjoyable once again, as the beer further brings out the strong, earthy and pungent flavors of the cheeses. I would definitely come back to this one, though limit it to one serving per session and let the drinking partner pick up some of the heat."
"This is my first Imperial Red, and I think I picked a good one. The head pours thick, and lasts a minute or tow with some nice light brown lacing. The smell is reminds me of a barley wine with slightly less kick, fresh hops. The color is definately amber, nice and dark. The taste is somewhat similar to a barley wine, tasting pretty strong for 6.4% ABV. I get that oak barrel taste, malty, but has some bitter characteristics. Carbonation is pretty high, which tones down the alcohol taste. Good Imperial Red, I would recommend it."
"Certainly not a session beer, but I had no problem at all finishing the bomber, and could probably handle a few pints on tap. Very tasty, and another awesome beer from the Ballast Point limited releases (I find their year round releases to be not so hot)."
"D - I could drink this all night. Like I said before, this is a very well balanced beer which makes it very easy to drink. There are no extremes in any category that would make this difficult for anyone to drink."
"Shout out to my 619 connect for this and all the other awesome San Diego local beers. Ruby red, wispy caramel bubbles. It smells like strong alcohol and a little hops. The taste is hoppy, malty, piney, its probably the most potent red ale I've had despite the fact that Alesmith Decadence 06 was 9.9%. This is just heavy on the alcohol but it is still alright, its definitely a tounge-wrecker."
"Overall this is a well done amber, although not quite in the top tier. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Medium carbonation and a clean finish. Good drinkability but I wasn't craving more of it."
"I'm not sure if my palate has progressed or if this is just better than last year's batch, but this is a contender for best Imperial Red...up there with Nugget Nectar. Alcohol is better hidden this year, and the hop aroma and flavor are both explosive. So much citrus and pine. Outstanding stuff. Drink it fresh, drink it fresh, drink it fresh, and you'll find it to be amazing."
"Huge smack of melon/cantaloupe sweetness, dank fruity hops are massive in this one! Lush, sweet almost syrupy body. Reminded me a little of oak-aged Unearthly minus the oak. Drying with moderately bitter finish. Traces of alcohol only seem to come out as it warms. Pretty damn strong, but tasty. The sweetness and booze are integrated well enough that it isn't a distraction. I'm going to miss this bomber when it's gone..."
"d - while it tastes good I don't know if I could drink this all night. not saying it's bad, just not my style."
"Much better from bobmer for me. complex aroma, really deep amber and amazing when the light hits it. malt, more hops, fresh, green, pine and a touch of sweetness that all came out better in the tulip. still crushes the tongue but is nicer about it. could see this improving with several months in the bottle. reminded me of a winter yulesmith, but monsterized."
"D - It's pretty drinkable. Not necessarily a sipper, but not a quick drinker either."
"This beer is huge. Pours dark crimson with a tiny tan head. Aroma is mostly hops and caramel malt, with some fruitiness. The taste is very strong. Thick with malt and caramel, but offset by the heaping of bitter hops. Some citrus towards the back. Creamy mouthfeel with some stickiness. Its a sipper, but a really good one."
"Drinkability is high, great mix of hops and caramel malts, a very impressive 'imperial' amber style beer resembling GF Hophead and Port Shark Attack"
"Could not drink too many of these even though the alcohol content is not too high, but it is very bitter and not in the best way, still worth checking out if they ever have this at O'Briens or Liar's Club"
"Swirls thick, but comes across as thin in the mouth because it's so dry nothing hangs in the mouth. Not very drinkable...I dumped it."
"Had this on cask at O Briens. A thick creamy off white head topped a copper/red brew. This is what a beer should look like. The smell was of hops, citrusy/floral hops. The hops in this smelled fresh, like a harvest ale. Taste was dominated by the hops. Now i do love hops, but this was fairly one dimensional. Mouthfeel was good, creamy and rich. A good beer for hop heads if a bit one dimensional."
"Drinkability: I found this to be way over hopped for my liking, and barely made it through a pint."
"On tap at the brewery.Brown cloudy nice big head tight bubbles that continued forever, very bitter almost an IPA caramel with backbone slight sweetness but rounds out well with a well balanced finish. I enjoyed this brew but couldn't drink more than three"
"Overall: I am not a huge fan of Reds, so when I heard this one referred to as a Double Red, seconds after I ordered it.(note to Pizza Port: please add a style column to the next Festival Menu!!!) I was filled with trepidation. However, I will happily state that this was a very tasty treat, far from overpowering, sickly or alcoholic. I rate the brews from Ballast Point very highly; they consistently produce high quality products and always make an effort to add a Review for them whenever I can. This really should be bottled."
"This beer hit the spot the other night and I hope to come back for more. Had this on tap at the San Diego Brewing Co. and it was great. Poured a great amber color with a great head and nice lacing. The smell leaned more towards the IPA side of things with a nice wiff of hops and a little carmel malt scent in there too. The taste was very good and was a perfect mix between a strong amber and an IPA with a nice healthy hoppy flavor backed by a sweet malt that broke through very nicely and came to the foreground to ballance. I too hope they bottle this one someday, I'll buy!"
"XLPerro turned me on to this brew, it's an Imperial Red according to the brewery. Aroma and taste profile was hoppy, that's for sure. There was a bit too much sweetness or I would have really fallen for this one. Color was a deep amber, head was tannish. Nice solid mouthfeel and decent drinkability. A very interesting beer that I'm glad I tried."
