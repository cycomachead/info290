Not very aromatic in general. Tastes of coriander and moderate bitterness accompanied by a malty finish. Smooth mouth feel with some carbonation. Somewhat acidic feel on front of tongue. Leaves a mildly drying sensation, with very slight chewy character. Overall, good winter style ale that is not overwhelming to palate and easy drinking. Nothing to write home about, but enjoyable nonetheless.","sporklift87","Feb 15, 2015"

Taste matches the nose with a warm alcohol finish. Flavor is influenced by the yeast, it gives a slight warm doughy element. This is classified differently on different sites.

3.6,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and an above average example of the style, it had all the things that I look for in a good Amber Ale and the balance was pretty nice. This beer had very good drinkability, it was very smooth, crisp, a little refreshing, and it had a decent amount of flavor to hold my attention, I could drink a few of these without a problem, it's a pretty easy drinking Red Ale and I like that. What I liked the most about this beer was the drinkability, it was very good and better then most Amber Ales and it also hid it's alcohol very nicely. What I liked the least about this beer was how sweet it smelled, it had me preparing for the worse but luckily all that sweetness didn't make it to the taste. I would buy this beer again to keep around in the fridge since I think it's a good example of the style and it's always nice to have a quality easy drinking Amber Ale on hand, I recommend this beer to just about anyone, fans of the style should really appreciate it. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought it was very solid and a good example of the style. the last couple Big Sky beers I had weren't too impressive so it's nice to get one that I enjoy. My only problem with this beer is that I think it's miss marketed, I don't really think of this as Winter Ale, it has that nice Amber Ale flavor that is perfect for the summer and fall and I think this beer would do much better if marketed as a year round Amber Ale instead of a Winter Ale, but that's just my opinion. Either was this was pretty solid and I'm happy I tried it.","StoutHunter","Dec 01, 2012"

Instead it has a more earthy-spicy flavor that's not overwhelming. Mango citrus tang follows the hops with malty sweetness and a light roastiness. When drinking this I think of sitting by a fire after being outside in the cold and snow. In this case I guess the Powder Hound has done its job of being a winter ale since it makes me imagine drinking it in the winter. :P Hop bitterness and citrus do linger at the very end in the mouth. There's nothing like good flavors lingering to help you have a more lasting enjoyment of the beer. Although I don't think this beer is extraordinary, it is definitely very good. It's a great example of a quintessential winter ale. If you're snowed in then get this one!","BeardedRiker","Feb 16, 2011"

4.07,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Big Sky's version of a winter ale enters the glass, revealing an amber colored liquid with a dishwater head. The color is lighter than I expect for a winter ale--portentous it seems. The aroma is a nice mixture of caramel malt, biscuit, and citrus and pine from the hops. As I take the first imbibition hops race across the palate making this beer feel more akin to a pale ale than a winter ale. The pine and citrus from the hops is not able to overpower the caramel and nuttiness from the malt. The interplay between the hops and malt is just right. This well balanced brew is a winter delight. Drinkable indeed.","BeardedBoffin","Dec 21, 2010"

Slight, very slight medicinal/metallic note on the finish that's just a bit astringent. Mouthfeel is solid, but a bit over-carbonated. Drinakbilty is ok. A solid beer, but not exceptional.","aaronh","Feb 02, 2007"
4.03,11,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured cool (not from-the-fridge cold). Medium-firm pour into a Westmalle chalice produces a full one-fingered, pale tan head of medium duration and moderate lacing. Nose is fairly rich with esters of dark fruit, caramel, cocoa, and rather minimal hop. Smells creamy. Brilliant amber in color, fairly dark, and with a touch of crimson. Fruity and mildly-sweet on the first sip, with more dry biscuity malt notes than rich, roasty malt. VERY creamy. Lingering bitterness, with plenty of fresh piney, resiny hop aromatics, and a drying quality as well. Malt is fairly juicy on the second sip, and the alcohol is warming and nearer the front of the palate . . . tingly. Stronger than I recall it as being (and it drinks a bit stronger than 6.2%), but my overall impression is that this brew has changed a good deal since I first tried it five years ago . . . I really like the way they've balanced the juicy, aromatic, and bittering hops with the pale and roasty malt. Mildly roasty, cocoa notes tend to linger along with the both the hop bitterness and resiny quality, all to a rather pleasing affect. Light notes of cherry and caramel, cocoa and vanilla. Mouthfeel is light and creamy tingly as opposed to scrubbing/cleansing, and it is very *readily* drinkable, almost too much so. Carbonation is lower than I recall, with the brew being softer and more refined than I recall, definitely an improvement. Seeing as I haven't tried this in a good while and as it was on sale -$4 / six pack!- this made for a great buy for a cold day in February. Seeing as how their flagship brand (Moose Drool) has really come into its own in recenet years, it's no surprise that this brew would do likewise.

I'd like a little less nuttyness and a light graineyness to put a touch of an edge on it. This one is a touch closer to a nut brown in the aroma. Flavor is a bit more interesting than the nose. Caramel, light butter, moving towards a melanoidan toastyness and nuttyness, finishing with a very mild bitter. Its okay, but I don't like the nuttyness in here. It doesn't work well with the other flavors in my opinion. Feel is on the light end of moderate, with a carbonation that is moderately strong. It works very well with the flavor of the beer. Overall, this one is okay. I don't like the nutty character in it, as it seems to be fighting with the sweeter notes, not compliment them.

The flavor is a facsimile of the nose. Mild cocoa and citrus are prevalent, although an undertone of caramel sweetened, dark biscuit adds depth. Hop bitterness is paltry and leaves ample, but inobtrusive residual sweetness. Virtually bereft of esters, save a trace figgish complement. Lightly bodied and conducive to easy quaffing.

The underpowering nose was sweet with a delicate strawberry maltiness and a subtle citric hoppiness. The taste was also rather bland for a winter beer. The malt character was quite mild and not as sweet as the nose suggested, with no roastiness to be found. Instead, a Belgian strong ale-like focused strawberry essence presided, and held up throughout the mild bitter finish. I am reminded somewhat of a wimpy version of the Victory Grand Cru. My conclusion is that this beer is an experimental variant of the Belgian pale strong style (though there was no spice), perhaps an attempt to blend this style with another, altough with what I don't know...maybe with an amber/red ale as the style designation suggests, or an English pale ale. The result is not very inspiring, but isn't bad, just bland. The body of the beer is decent, though carbonation seemed fizzle out to quickly.

Hops are not very substantial but they do the job with a definite herbal character. A long, lingering sweetness entices you to take another sip. I was surprised how good this beer was. It at first seemed like an average malty winter brew but as it asserted itself I was more and more impressed with its complexity.

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Light mahagony in color with a tan head. Malt aroma. Roasted malt flavor up front that is well balanced by hops. Finishes pretty well and has good drinkability. Overall a solid beer with a flavor I enjoyed.","PhantomVodoo","Nov 21, 2002"
3.7,1.9,3,3,4,4,4,"Besides the quirkiness of this beer, (and the odd flavors that come along with it), I'd say it is actually very drinkable. And although a bit strange, it's a good strange.","Zraly","Beers"

3.7,1.9,4,4,3.5,3,4,"Ruby color, smallish head. Aroma: plum, cherries, some dark fruits. Medium body, lingering pleasant finish, slightly sweet, and very mellow. Normally, I like my winter ales to be on the spicier side, richer and toasted, and stronger. We'll have to wait 'til Anchor Our Special comes in...not a bad beer here, though.","feloniousmonk","Apr 23, 2002"
3.5,-3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The pour a deep brown color, the head light chocolate, the lace in average sheets.. Nose is malt, slightly sweet, the start is sweet, the top flimsy. The beer finished with a potent hop spicy bite, medial carbonation, and a tad dry. Not a great beer, but quite quaffable, although I think it could or should have more body for a ""Winter Warmer"".","Gusler","Mar 26, 2002"
3.83,5.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"clear dark bronze in color, poured a medium head that stuck around and left a good deal of lace. muted malt aroma with some spicy hops. tastes very good. a nice blend of roasted caramel and chocolate malts with a bit of spices and finishing hop bite. a little thin in mouthfeel but very drinkable and warming. i'm a fan of this style/flavor of winter brew. it needs some backbone, but the malt flavor is great. recommended.","budgood1","Beers"
