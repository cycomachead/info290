"Try this one while it lasts. Mine is labeled as #35 for 2013, which I notice is a little different from some of the other release numbers I see in these reviews. But the style is still the same, as far as I know. It may not be around for long so give it a try if you can."
"This is #95 no clues on what is cancelled for review or whatever. Popping the top the bottle smell is black licorice with alot of malts and strong sweetness. Pouring into the SAPP yields a deep bronze with a permanent multi size bubble tan head that is as I said, permanent. Taste is smoothness beyond all comprehension will an up front bittersweet maltiness that then kicks into a a sweet but mildly balanced bitterness that then fades to a slight bitterness that never exceeds the butterscotch bite. A fine brew."

"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute. Yields a 1/2"" head which stocks around for a couple sips, and then leaves lovely lacing in rings on the inside of the glass. Unfiltered slightly ruby-tinted honey color. Aroma is rich, complex, fruity and hops. Flavor is rich, complex, caramel, hops, fruit, alcohol, and more hops. Mouthfeel is medium thick and potent. Overall I really like this. It is quite a bit better than the seasonal Flipside Red IPA, which is a little bit different style."
"Reddish amber colored with a good inch of khaki colored head. Lively carbonation. Cereal grains and amber malt combine with pine like aromatic hops in the nose. The mouthfeel is sticky and warm. The cereal grains and amber malts are on the front of the palate and are quickly drenched with intense pine hop flavors that burn a bit and then fade. Intensely hopped."

"O: I tend to hate Imperial reds because they’re so abrasive. Pretty happy with this."
""
""
""

"O- A pretty good offering from SN, it's got the big hop bitterness I expect from them but not a overpowering as in some of their other beers, but most of those are IPAs. Not as good as Bear Republic's Red Rocket but I don't think that is an Imperial."
""
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer, but comes off as unfinished compared to what I would normally expect from Sierra Nevada."
""

"Sierra Nevada never releases a bad beer. Pours to a frothy beige head that leaves endless lacing. Reddish brown color. Aroma is spicy, citrusy hops, caramel malt, and sweet, comforting alcohol. Flavor is an intense blend of specialty malts, assertive hop flavors and residual malt sweetness balanced by strong, resiny alpha acids. Mouthfeel is medium, full and satisfying. Overall, a full malt and hops experience."

"A pretty good beer but it shouldn't have that musty hop flavor already. As it warms the booze comes out. Solid and tasty."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Frothy head, and substantial lacing. Roasted grains, rye, and wood. Wood is prominent in the flavor, roasted malt and coffee make up the body. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."

"Overall not my favorite. Severalotherbeer camp beers are better this season."
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of citrus and earthy hops with some caramelized malt notes. Taste is dominated by some citrus and earthy hops with some good notes of caramelized malt notes with medium sweet notes. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not bad but a bit short on complexity and hops punch could be more pronounced."
"Overall, I'm woundedly disappointed by this. I love red ales (imperial all the better), and I really hoped that Sierra Nevada would give me a better example than this. While it's still decent enough, ""decent enough"" is far below the benchmark set for Sierra Nevada."
"Slightly above average amber. Except for the head, not very attractive looking. Straight up bitter amber ale."

"This is really not my idea of a good red or imperial red. I like the spicy element of the beer but it just follows the American over hopped variety of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer but it is definitely lacks a bit of panache."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty nice, another solid offering from SN and a nice addition to the beer Camp series. Worth trying, but there are quite a few other reds/imperial reds on the market that I would choose over this one if they were on the same shelf."
"This beer pours up a murky deep red with a lucious two finger foamy caramel colored head, awesome retention, and world class lacing. The smell is pine, floral, citrus, grasses, and biscuit. Taste is very citrus, probably more orange than grapefruit, some caramel, sweet malt, and a nice hops finish. Mouthfeel is good with a bit of an aftertaste, but not too bad of one. I liked this one a lot!!!"
""
"On tap at Churchkey. Served in a mini snifter. Pours a moderate red-amber color with an off-white head and some lacing. The nose carries some citrus hops and a touch of pine atop some bready malt. Flavor has bready malt with a slight bit of toast and amber. Citrus hops and a bit of pine and earth. Medium body with good carbonation. Somewhat bitter. Pretty good."
""
"O: Not a bad Imperial Red, but a bit too hoppy for my tastes. As far as the style, i'd say its on par with most Imperial Reds though, nothing really stands out for me. It is nice to see SN putting out a nice broad array of beer camp brews though."
"Overall – I think I expected more from Sierra Nevada but this is still a very tasty beer. I'd like a little more citrus punch but maybe that would make it more of a IPA/DIPA. Glad to have tried."
""
""
"Palate is a little sticky and resiny, but fits the flavor profile pretty well. I don't think I'd want to have another one after this though."
"Overall a very tasty red ale. More on the bitter-hop side than the citrus-sweet side, which is just fine. Caramel malts play a big role in the balance and work nicely with the pines through and through. Another solid release from the guys in Cali."
"Very nice effort from SN. Not a hop bomb but very well balanced. Goes down well for ABV"
""
"Done well. Clean, consistent and easy and fun to drink. A very enjoyable beer."
"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Imperial Red pours out a muddy brown-tinged red color with a finger of persistent head. The aroma is big and malty, a decent amount of the hop presence from fresh has faded, revealing a roast presence I don't really remember. There's still a solid amount of the citrus hop flavor on the tongue, but the malt really runs the show here, with a toffee/caramel/roast kinda thing going on. A hint of booze in the middle, and a dry, malty finish. The mouthfeel is big and brash, and the drinkability is solid. Overall, it's a good beer, but never quite hit great."
""
"O: A nice beer, but doesn't rock my socks, I Sierra Nevada makes a lot of beers I like/love, but this is not one of them. I'll happily drink the last one of these, but I would not look for more."
"O - This is an imperial red ale that isn't hopped up on hops. It's just a higher ABV version that is a mild balance to floral hops and malt. I really expected a red IPA."
""
"good not great. much more than a red ale, this is more lke an imperial red ipa in my opinion. pour is brick red, clear, and had an inch of white head on it. the nose is big american red malts, nothing dry and irish about this baby. lots of bold hops too, big aroma on this beer. flavor is hops first malt second. its bitter at first, especially for a red, but the malts quickly come in to sweeten up the bitter and add a huge layer of earthy depth. its good, but the two flavors seem at odds with eachother somehow. the feel is quite airy really, but filling and heavy at the same time. its a contradiction that i do not understand, and its one i dont really like either. i can sip this down easy, but as soon as i swallow it, its heavy in my gut, also very strong for a beer you can hardly taste the booze in, even when its warm. its a cool beer, there is a lot going on, but i like the others in this beer camp box better."
""
"A bit too boozy, not too bad otherwise."
"Overall: Reminds me of a less aggressive/less hoppy Arrogant Bastard. Pretty good malt base to go with plenty of pine and citrus bitterness. Gave a few hints of a much lighter Bigfoot, not nearly as much caramel/toffee as Bigfoot (or hops either) but almost like a second runnings brew."
""
"The second offering from this year's variety pack. It pours a clear amber-russet topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises toasted caramel, dark greens, pine resin, and celery. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is less toasted, the pine is stronger, and some grapefruit peel has been added. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a very nice impy red, one that's not ashamed to be pleasantly balanced."
""
""
"O - Pretty decent for the style, although I have seen it done better (Ballast Point Tongue Buckler comes to mind) but a good addition to the Beer Camp craft pack nonetheless. Would gladly drink again if someone handed me one, but probably wouldn't seek this out."
""
"Super malty IPA/DIPA with a gorgeous color, though there is some clash in the nose I am not crazy about. Heavy body makes this a one per siting sort of beer for me. So one dimensionally malty that for a second I catch a tinge of almost smoky porter malt."
""
"O- I was impressed with this one, my favorite of the Beer Camp sampler. Great balance of bold hops and malt with a warming finish."
""
"Pours a dark ruby-brown with a fluffy off-white head that remains a pillowy, 2-inch head. Aromas of amber malt, caramel and toffee, grassy hops, tangerine peel, and a touch of resin. Taste consists of more amber malt, candy, grain, and moderately bitter pine resin and grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is a touch sticky, with a medium body and good carbonation. Solid Amber Ale, but nothing new or revolutionary."
"Beer is nice, thick in body and sweet through, a strong flavored beer with a good finish. For a big big red ale, it is quite drinkable, could have been a little hoppier even and I would still enjoy it. I'd have this again."
""
"Overall a very good and very big red ale. I wouldn't mind seeing this in six packs soon."
""
""
""
"O: I'd happy take this hop bomb over many of the IPA on the market."
"O - This is a very nice imperial red ale. Second best of the mix pack behind the Oatmeal Stout."
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Light beige head with clear lacing. Dark coppery red in color. Aroma is malty, caramel sweet with some traces of alcohol. Taste is spicy, some piney hop bitterness, mild malty sweetness. Really can't find anything wrong with this beer, just doesn't stand out. But quite good and a very solid offering."
""
"Overall this brew is pretty solid. It has a nice chewy caramel malt backbone and an agressive hopping that makes the impy red style one of my favorites. Recommended."
""
"D: This is pretty tasty. My only gripe is that it's a little rough around the edges. This has a complex malt bill (sweet, malty, and toasty) along with a complex hop profile, which creates an interesting tug-of-war on the palate. Still, this has something for everyone without seeming too big to be drinkable."
"This was a good beer, had it as part of this years bear camp. Probably my second favorite in the set. The smell reminded me of hopps and citrus fruits. It had a moderately hoppy taste sort of bittersweetness. The color was reddish . It was crisp. I found it to be very refreshing."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber color with a khaki head. Nose is nicely sweet with plenty of caramel and toffee malts. Strong hop profile of grapefruit, tangerine, and pine. A bit of peach fruitiness, maybe some earth and floral notes as well. The flavor is slightly bitter with lots of pine and citrus peel hop notes. Tangerine and grapefruit give a nice citrus character. Solid maltiness with a good caramel sweetness as a dominant flavor of the beer."

"A thanks goes out to cpolking for this beer. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mainly of hops and pine. Taste is piney hops up front, some alcohol is present, malts kicking in near the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
"This ale is different than any red that I had before. Enjoyable. With a price of $4 and limited availability, I won't buy another. Store only received one case, and it was going fast. But I am certainly enjoying the one I have."
""
"O- It's a good beer. I like Imperial reds as they bring the big flavors of an IIPA, but have a bit more depth. This is a decent example of the style."
""
"O: It's an alright beer, but nothing I'll revisit. True to its amber ale roots. You should try it; your opinion may differ."
""
"Overall - Really complex and well balanced brew, and a very pleasant surprise, really has the best of a dipa, an apa, and a red ale all rolled into one. Big bold flavors, not overly sweet - a really nice beer to enjoy with the onset of the cooler weather - enjoying this one during Monday Night Football - get the sampler pack, I think you'll like this one."

"The beer pours a deep dark candied red, bordering on brown with a nice clear body and a good flow of carbonation bubbles. The head is big, rocky, and mountainous, with sticky fat globs of lacing moving up the sides of the glass in web-like patterns. The beer smells very bready with a great smattering of piney hops with hints of citrus. Caramel malts are also obviously present and enticing, just as any red ale should be. The beer tastes fantastically balanced. It opens with sweet caramel and malts before opening into big pine and grapefruit bitter notes which transitions into the aftertaste which mingles the hops bitter citrus-pine with the bready malts to make a mellow bitter linger and sweet touch. Mouthfeel is clean and medium bodied, with light effervescence from the carbonation, which helps to cleanse the palate. The mouth is left slightly dry on the tongue and roof, with just a trickle of saliva to leave the mouth calling out for more liquid nourishment. Overall this beer is a lovely sipper. I must admit that I love hoppy imperial reds, and this is very nice hoppy red. Granted, the hops are a little mellower than other reds I have sampled, this ale still holds great grapefruit and other citrus notes, and definitely kisses the mouth with sweet caramel and bread malts in a perfect balancing act with the hoppy bitters. Try this beer! It is most likely my favorite of Beer Camp this year."
"Taste is sharp, with a bitter grapefruit hops character dominating. The big malt presence comes through later in the finish, smoothing things over a bit. Overall, a solid, tasty, and very enjoyable brew."
"O: Good stuff. Closer to a Strong Ale, I think, than an American Amber/Red, but SN calls this an Imperial Red, so I knew what I was getting myself into."
"O -- Probably my favorite selection of the 12 pack. This beer is full of different characters, yet they all work together for a great glass full of beer."
""
""
"O- sweet red with ABV well hidden a tad bitter"
"Cheers!"
"Very good balance of hops and malt. Can't taste the 8.1 percent alcohol but you can feel it. This is a big beer that is my favorite beer camp beer so far. Cloudy red color with a good quantity of malt. Some citrus notes in the hoppy finish. A very well made ale that I wish I could buy more of."
"o - overall, a bit too earthy for me. although ambers aren't my favorite, i do enjoy a good take on the style and this one is a bit boozy and way too heavy on the grains."
"Dark slightly hazy amber. Clingy lace - nose is floral, zesty, spicy hops clinging to a sturdy malt base of dark toasted grains and toffee - low carbonation - smooth on the palate - flavor is moderately bitter on the approach, but the malt is pretty much center stage on the front end - very toasty and medium sweet - spicy herbal hops come on stronger through the middle and hit their most potent in the finish. The beer dries out as the bitterness intensifies, leaving a nice finish - reminds me of a malty up Celebration ale, which is not a bad thing - simple, but tasty."
"O - wont kick it out of a glass. Quite enjoyable, but is missing something to put it over the top."
""
""
""
"Overall: Reminds me of six month old Sierra Nevada Bigfoot."
"The beer is mildly hazy and appears copper to amber in color with a creamy, off-white head that leaves ample sticky lacing on the pint glass. The aroma brings malt, slightly sweet, pine, hops. Intensely bitter, with prominent piney hop flavors. A tad sweet, with some fruity maly offerings. A bit of alcoholic warmth persists after each sip. Typical SN hop and flavor profile. Overall, this was ok."
"O: Solid amber, definitely on the hoppy bitter side. Refreshing and smooth, but firm and chewy."
""
"D - Pretty good. I like it overall. It isn't fantastic among the imperial red ale style - which I love. Beer camp variety is reasonably priced, so I will likely have it again."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. This pours a reddish brown color with a large beautiful tan head which has good retention and a nice consistency. The smells are of caramel, some grassy hops. The feel is medium to light thickness. The taste is excellent, a load of sweet caramel followed by a load of bitterness. A great beer."
""
""
"Certainly an interesting beer, but I think it needs a little polish around the edges to be great."
"OVERALL: This beer seems full of surprises. Each step of the reviewing process seems to throw a twist into the plot. Decent effort here, speaking from a hophead's perspective, but don't give this one to a light lager drinker."
"Pours a dark red crimsom color. Some white foam resides with a ring around. Nose is red-caramel and toffee blend. There is a bitter hop that bursts through with the sweet malt and takes hold. Really robust red ale. Good."
""
"Pretty standard for an Imperial Red/Amber. Balanced and easy drinking for 8.1%. Solid but nothing groundbreaking."
"o - well executed and enjoyable. everything form this year's beer camp box has been great so far. can't wait for the next edition."
"This was hands down my fav of the 2012 Beer Camp bunch."
"Overall: this is a pretty drinkable beer for an imperial-strength red ale. I feel like if the brewers had emphasized the toastiness and caramel character more than the biscuit, I would really love it."
"O: This was my least favorite in the ""Beer Camp 2012"" box available in my area. Perhaps I was searching for something the brewers didn't intend?"
""
"O - Bitter and malty. Blah."
""
""
"There's a good kick of grapefruit starting things off, closely matched by some malt sweetness but I find it pretty bitter overall. This, like the other Beer Camp beers of 2012 I've tried all seem to have a fence that don't let the flavours really shine. To be frank, I wouldn't seek any of them out if they showed up in individual 6 packs. Oh well. That's just me, I guess."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, ruby-red coloring with a thin, filmy, clingy, off-white head that coats the surface and any of the glass it touches. Aromas of roasted caramel, nutty highlights, and a touch of hops to keep everything clean and tight. Flavors are rich and malty on the forward tongue, with a strong hop presence on the tail end of the palate. Hops are slightly resiny and citrusy, with enough bitterness to counterbalance the rich, sweet caramel and nutty sweet malt profile. Extremely well balanced. The aftertaste is roasted sweetness, with a clean, smooth finish that leaves only a trace linger behind. Well done campers!"
""
"O: Really n a fan of his style put this was pretty tasty and well crafted"
""
"It's very sweet, with a great depth of flavor, it just isn't my favorite due to the high ""red malt"" profile. For me, it needed more warm roasty flavors. Still, it's complex and tasty, and hid the 8.1% well. Worth trying."
""
"O: Good drinkability for a borderline imperial red. Big malts, not too heavy on the hops. A lot better than the floral IPA, right up there with the pilsner and oat stout... Might be the best in the bunch."
""
""
"What happened? The Imperial Pils was clean & lovely, this beer feels like it was left on simmer for a couple hours too long. Not very good."
""
""
""
""
"o: I think this is a very nicely balanced beer. maybe my favorite out of the beer camp pack."
""
"Medium bodied with a spicy hop bite up front that provides some earthy, dry bitterness that lingers over the sweet malt backbone into a dry finish. Resinous with a grassy pine needle flavor along with a very faint citrus fruit presence. The malt flavors are a bit strong for my liking but they don't really interfere with the hops. There's a strong caramel flavor along with some toffee, nut and biscuit. Nicely balanced with a well masked ABV but I was expected a bit more complexity."
"O= Not the best hoppy red and not the best sweet red but this is a sort of blend of the two. I actually like it quite a bit. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding the difference in a hoppy red and an IPA. This beer lets the difference be known. A quality beer and worth checking out."
"Not bad, but I was expecting more. It turned out to be my least favorite in the beer camp 12 pack."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 6/26/2012. Pours lightly hazy reddish copper color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, caramel, toast, pine, herbal, bread, mango, and earthy spiciness. Pretty good aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of grapefruit, pine, caramel, bread, mango, toast, herbal, floral, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, mango, pine, caramel, toast, biscuit, herbal, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of malt and hop flavors; with decent complexity overall. Moderately astringent bitterness lingers after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good imperial red ale. Decent complexity and balance of flavors; very smooth to drink for the gravity. The flavor profile balance and complexity wasn’t on par to what I was hoping to get."
"A great take on the style. Very deep malt bill with supporting hops. Very raw but in robust and elegant way. I really liked this one."
"o: a good imperial red that i wouldn't mind seeing in 4 packs of cans like Torpedo. recommended."
"Taste-Big dose of citrus hops, grapefruit, faint peach. Toasted malt in the background, but mostly hop-forward. Very tasty."
"Found this at My Place in Newtown, CT. The look is a dark but clear rosy mahogany color with a fair off-white head and a wash of lacing. The aroma brings malt vinegar and grassy earthy grains. A bit tart and likeable enough. The flavor offers an intense grass hop and malt vinegar blend with a grainy near butterscotch touch. It’s medium bodied with gentle carbonation and a vaguely resinous feel. Overall a lovely brew that I can recommend for a nice combination of tart and hoppy!"
""
""
"O:  What a great concoction of toasted sweet malts and ferocious fruity hops. The hop profile is sublime and the mouthfeel is fantastic. Gotta say this is one terrific take on the style. "
""
"Overall: a slow sipping beer that is hearty. Nice flavors but not overpowering."
"Of the four beers that came in the Beer Camp 12-pack, this was the one I looked forward to the most. Unfortunately it ends up being the least impressive of the four."
""
"This is fine....kind of middle of the road for the style but not bad in any way....just doesn't seem to come together as I hoped for."
""
""
"Love a good imperial red, and this is a good one."
""
"D - Kind of lacking in hop character for an imperial red. The malt is excessively sweet and lacking in depth, which means that it further obscures the hops. Another dissapointment from this years beer camp pack."
"Overall, this is a solid amber, but not particularly great."
""
""
"O-A good Red Ale, malt was strong but could have had more subtle flavors."
""
"Beautiful caramel and toffee flavors on top of brown sugar, molasses, and a firm, but not overbearing bitterness that brings it home to a nice smooth finish. Medium bodied and medium-low carbonation make this super easy to drink. Surprisingly thoroughly enjoyable and extremely well-made."
"VERY GOOD, TRY SOME!"
""
""
""
"This isn't one of the best Sierra Nevada products I have ever had, but it certainly isn't bad. For the relatively high ABV it is really easy to drink and quite light on the flavor. I would drink this again, but I wouldn't seek it out if it were a full time Sierra Nevada offering."
""
""
"Dark, deep red in color with white frothy head that stays. Aroma of apple skins, booze, malty, grass, hazelnut. Apple skins, citrus, cough syrup, booze, cola, hop resin, bitterness towards the finish. Thick in body with light carbonation. Big, boozy, fruity, unbalanced, and amateur."
""
""
"Overall: Gnight is still the best in this category from what I have tried and the hop character though balanced isnt very complex. Still worth trying in a nice beer camp year."
"O) I had high hopes for this one, but was a bit let down. I was thinking this would perhaps be like Lucky 13, Brian Boru, or Tocobaga. Unfortunately, it was not. This was my least favorite of the Beer Camp pack this year, but even so, I'm glad to have tried it."
""
""
"Hop-forward Red Ale, but still well balanced with the malts. Quite tasty."
"Overall: A very well done IPA/Red Ale. Good mix of hops and a good malt balance. Nice undertones of roast."
""
""
"O: Id call it a Red IPA. A bit all over the place, but pretty tasty none the less. Although the hops are higher than normal for style (which is welcomed) its the malt profile that I enjoy the most. Its good, and worth trying, but"
"The mouthfeel feels a little on the heavy side for the style with carbonation being slightly below average. Overall, it was a decent beer but not a stand out one. The darker, roasted malts seemed a little overdone and overshadowed the hoppiness for me unfortunately."
"This is a pretty decent red ale, I'd drink my share of these and maybe a bit more."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a medium red copper color with a nice two finger fine light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of bready malt, piney and herbal hops, citrus. Interesting caramel malt and complex hop flavor, with different hop flavors slowly revealing themselves into an herbal hop and light malt finish. A hint of rye sourness. I was expecting a more intense hop flavor from the aroma, but instead the malts and hops are very nicely integrated. I greatly enjoyed the slow revealing of of the hop flavors. A nice creamy medium body. This is a very nice classic red ale with good balance in the components. I love Sierra Nevada."
"O- Overall an enjoyable, nice beer that I would have again. It didn't blow me away, but solid nonetheless."
""
"O-I like this a lot as an imperial re ale. I'm impressed because most big red ale are just essentially IPAs but this maintains all the good characteristics of a red ale. It's a but hoppy, yes, but it's just a slight addition. "
""
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Pours a mahogany/amber color with a two inch, rocky, cream-colored head embedded with craters and a network of honeycombs visible along the sides. Head gradually dissipates into a consistent, eigth inch skim, leaving textured, delicates sheets of lacing as the brew recedes. Nose expresses citrus, rind and earthy spice with a suggestion of caramel malt in the background. Taste reveals an herbal/resinous character on a malty backbone; however, the hops quality definitely asserts itself more than the malt. There's a slight, rind-like bitterness at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a brisk carbonation and a slight oiliness. More and more I find myself buying from this brewery. The quality, variety and price point are exceptional. That said, a very solid example of the style - not my favorite per se, but quite enjoyable."
"It pours a deep opaque red with a small white head. The smell is hoppy, of the west coast variety. It's a very bitter beer, but the hops have a nice flowery aftertaste. I think I smell and taste oak somewhere in the beer. The mouthfeel is good. There's a good amount of carbonation and the medium body feels nice. I feel like there isn't much complexity to this beer, but it's at least a solid offering, which can't be said for some of the other beers in the beer camp package."
"Aw yeah, this is a really good imperial red. Recommended."
"O: A malty imperial red, and a pretty good one at that, though I prefer my red ales on the hoppy side."
""
""
"o: one of these is all i can drink in a sitting. just too overly bitter with out a lot of flavor to back it up. leaves my taste buds thinking that i just ate some burnt toast."
""
""
""
"M&D- The mouth on this is nice with a medium feel and a bit of carb which I think works perfectly. The ABV is 8.1% which is a bit higher than most reds but the alcohol is completely hidden. I would knock back 1/2 a sixer easily. This is alright."
"Overall - At 8%, I was surprised by the amount of alcohol that presents itself on the palate. I thought it may have been closer to 10 or 11% until I read the bottle. Not very impressed."
"O: pretty tasty, nice maltyness and a good dose of hops to keep the sweetness in check. as usual Sierra Nevada makes another very solid offering."
"I guess this one needed to warm a little to really unfold and feel the weight of it. By the end of the glass, Red-Oric has become quite a big beer, and certainly a good one to end the night with. I like most aspects about this beer, but there is just something that rubs me the wrong way in its finish. Probably just personal preference. Otherwise, another solid beer from Sierra Nevada and fun to try their take on an imperial red."
"Roasted and dark chocolate leads the way for the malt side. Even balance is achieved as the finish is dominated by citrus and floral hops. The alcohol is present in the taste and texture but not overwhelming for either. Strong basic flavors melded nicely. Maybe not as refined as some, but very tasty and drinkable."
"Overall: This is a high quality beer, but it takes a lot (or at least a just-right combination) to really wow me with an imperial red. Maybe if the hops were *way more* in your face (they're good, but rather subtle), or the malt flavors worked differently with the rest. I like the bitterness, and I don't detect any outright off flavors whatsoever. It's a good value, just not something I'd be inclined to buy very often."

"Overall - Pretty solid brew. It's not outstanding as an 'imperial red', but it does the trick. A little underflavored, but the flavors there are good"
"OVERALL: Definitely a fine brew from Sierra Nevada, with big time malt flavor and solid hop notes. Any fans of well balanced ales would enjoy this one. A winner."

"Imperial Red Ale is pretty good. It really doesn’t make any huge missteps, but the alcohol is a bit much. A little less would go a long way. Otherwise, it performs pretty well all around. Definitely worth checking out."
""
"Overall it's a very well constructed beer, I just don't feel that drawn to it, but could easily have it again."
""
""
"Fruity malt sweetness up front, with growing herbal, almost vegetal hop bitterness. Malt sweetness dominates the palate, with notes of pear and grapes. Big caramel flavors take over as we head to the finish, providing an interesting mix of flavors. Meanwhile, the hop bitterness steadily increases, with notes of pepper, pine, and a little citrus. Lingering caramel and fruit in the finish. Medium-full body with a nice, creamy feel. Maltier than expected, but good."
"Overall a beer I would certainly drink again. A solid entry in this beer camp that any amber ale fan should try. Plenty of hop but still malty enough to be a red."

"Maybe mid bodied, alcohol is hidden. Clean and pretty dry. A good American red ale. Well done, not too extream per usual for SN."
""
""
""
"This is a damn solid red ale. Sturdy, chewy malt with a big piney hop profile. Bitterness gets more serious with each sip, which, in my book, is a great sign of a hoppy ale."
""
"O: My favorite Beer Camp brew so far; every sip was interesting and relatively satisfying. Not a life-changing beer experience, but it was definitely a memorable drink."
"A generously hopped Red...could be considered an imperial red i.p.a. A well-made brew...Malty but with a considerable hop presence."
""

""
""
"This was a decent Imperial Red. A little more balanced than expected, but still a very high quality brew with some complexity present. The 8.1% ABV was completely undetectable: the true sign of a well crafted offering."
"Spruce, piny aroma. Soapy head and lace dots on cloudy amber. Initially complex hoppy melange with a dry malty finish. Worth sipping to enjoy. A good balance between hop bitterness and sweetness. A tad of chestnut, fruitiness, star anise. A must try."
"A really nice brew. Hoppy and malty at the same time. Like this one quite a bit."
""
"Overall not very complex on the malt side given the style, yet showing a solid hop character and hiding a notable ABV well. Drinks easily as a result and ranking very low on the 'cloying' meter."
"Red body, filtered with an offwhite head. Mild retention and lace. Nose is fantastic, loads of dank pot, pineapple and melon character. Tons more pot on the palate, pine, melon, apricots, mango. Lightly herbal and some sweeter malt character. Medium feel, bitter with just a light sweetness. Excellent red ale, with a ton of different qualities coming through on every sniff/sip. Definitely recommended."
"Carbonation scale of 2 out of 5. Not very heavy again considering the abv."
"The finish is pretty dry and the bitterness is nice. It's not a bad beer, but is is pretty average for a big Red Ale."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on the 217th of 12. Pours a deep red, with a half inch of off white that leaves globs of lace. Smell is carmel, pine, toffee, and grapefruit. Taste is more aggressive and that is not a bad thing, sweet grapefruit lingers in the finish. Body is medium large, with a perfect amount of carbonation, more lush than dry, and excellent drinkability. Another winner in this awesome mixed 12 pack."
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good and proper example of an Imperial Red Ale, it had a nice and bold malt backbone that helped balance out the loads of citrus hops that imparted lots of nice fruity flavors that worked with with the biscuity caramel malt flavors. This beer had good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, I could see having another one, but I think that would be limit. What I liked most about this beer was how good it looked and it's great balance, those were the highlights of this beer and the balance really worked well with this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was a little thin for the style and it would fit this beer better if it was just a little thicker. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Imperial Red Ale, and I would for sure recommend giving this beer a try. All in all I was quite pleased with this beer and it delivered just about everything that I would want from the style, it's a really solid beer and so far my second beer from the Beer Camp series, so far I am liking this series and I can't wait to see how the other two are. Keep up the good work Sierra Nevada, series like this are what puts you a step ahead of most other brewers."

"O- I really hope they make this a year round or seasonal brew. I really dug this. Glad I have few more to drink from this 12-pack. Gotta love beer camp."

"A very good red ale that is another fine product of the Beer Camp. This beer hides the ABV well, but after a second I felt the full power of the 8.1%. A definite recommendation on this limited release as I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
""
"M- Light body, quite chewy, slightly sticky on the lips."
"O- best brew in beer camp! What an imperial red that's full of flavor!"
"O - Pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. My only knock would be that it is perhaps a bit too sweet. Still , highly drinkable without any offensive flavors. Leaves me a reasonably happy camper."
"Overall: Great Imperial Red Ale. While not reaching the apex of the style (see Great Lakes Nosferatu), it is still damn good and much better than the average on the site suggests."
"This is a nice amber with a combination of hops and malt and the alcohol well hidden. Well done SN."
"The flavors are very well-balanced with nothing being overpowering. The malt brings those subdued caramel and crusty bread qualities and there are some floral and piney hops to provide balance. The alcohol is well hidden here. There is a mild aftertase from the malt and hops. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth with a slightly dry finish. The drinkability is very high. This is an excellent beer."

"From the 12 oz bottle from the 12-pack I have only seen at Liticker's in San Diego."
"O: It's a pretty good standard american red. Hop forward of course, this is Sierra Nevada."

"Beer Camp #65 is a beautifully constructed ale that forgets about the mundane notions of balance and gains inspiration from our love affair with IPAs to inform and inspire the finish product from its recipe formation, through brewing technique, and fresh delivery."
""
"O: Its not a bad beer and worth a try, but not my favorite red ale or favorite imperial red. Slightly imbalanced and too dry for me but drinkable nonetheless."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"O- Nice beer, it tastes as it sounds. Drinks easy for the ABV. Definitely pick up the multipack if you can."
"O: so far my favorite out of the beer camp mix pack, the most flavorful and well rounded, quite well done"
"Extremely hoppy west coast nose. Grapefruit, strong pine, some citrus, and a bit of soapiness. A little thinner in body than expected. Sweet dark fruit and caramel up front roll over the tongue into the balancing hop act. Balance is actually impeccable. Strange and unique layers of flavors that somehow meld together into on interesting sip. You also can't detect a whiff of that 8%. Pretty damn good. But i'm a sucker for imperial reds."
"Deep red colour, finger of off white head with some lace left behind. Smell is a mix of citrus and malts, big juicy grapefruit and orange, sweet malts and some biscuity caramel. Taste is also a mix of malt and hops, moderately sweet, citrus fruit mid palate, grapefruit and earthy hop, quite bitter throughout with a long malty finish. Light-med carbonation, oily and fairly full bodied. The 8% alcohol goes largely undetected, nice hoppy red ale that may be a touch too sweet, still a smooth drinking beer."
"A decent beer, but just a tad off in all areas. Close, but not quite there."
"O - I could drink a few of these but it is just below the standard I set for this brewery. I would not refuse one given the chance, although I certainly would not lose any sleep if I never saw this beer again."
"Pours a brownish burnt copper with more than a finger of head. The head lingered a bit and left a good amount of lacing behind. The nose has some mild citrus notes, but there is also a malt presence. The flavor is a well balanced mixture of caramel malt and hops. The hops are not overdone, but they are certainly featured on the finish. Considering this offering clocks in at slightly above 8%, the alcohol is well hidden among the solid flavors."
"Overall Impression- My 3rd from the ""Beer Camp"" Series and was above average. Not sure why the hops couldn't have came up sooner in the taste! Very enjoyable though and will be popping another one of these. Glad there are 3 of each to the pack!"
""
"O- I think they got this right. Light on the hops, heavy on the malt. Rich enough with just enough ABV to warrant the imperial label."
""
"Edit from 8/20/12. Just learned this beer will be part of the beer camp sample pack from SN, which is good news. Hopefully that means we will continue to see this beer on tap from time to time as well."
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced hoppy Imperial Red Ale. Good hop profile and bitterness throughout."
""
"I expected much more, especially considering this is Sierra Nevada we're talking about. It should satisfy, but it's too boring."
""
"Overall I really like this beer. The hops mixed well with the roasted malts, reminiscent of DFH's Indian Brown Ale but with a little more sweetness."
"Pours rusty with a quilt of peanut foam. Nice tea, pine and bitter citrus notes over a scotch like nose. There is a certain herbal quality to this beer. The flavor is assertively bitter up front, again with tea like hops and some english malts. Then followed up with some pleasant creamy sweetness (which is fleeting) and then some lasting ESB character. I like. Medium on full bodied with prickly, moderately hi carb and an off-dry finish. Nice beer. Once annually would be nice."
"O: Not necessarily a bad beer, but kind of on the forgettable side."
"12oz bottle from the recent mixed Beer Camp 12 pack. Red, clear, sticky head, Smells super malty. I always expect imperial reds to be super hoppy but this relied more on malts to produce a solid beer. Smells sort of like coffee, yum. Taste has the slightest hint of coffee followed by malts and a touch of hops. This might be the best beer in this mix pack. Solid."
"O- A good imperial red, but nowhere near the class of Lagunitas Imperial Red or Nugget Nector."
"O/D-Looks amazing, smells amazing, but it tastes good. I am very pleased with this beer's overall outcome, but I wish the flavor lived up to the look and scent."
""
"O: This is a nice beer but it suffers for lack of character."
""
"O- It's OK, probably my least favorite of what I've had out of this seasons beer camp so far. The 8.0% ABV starts to show up as it warms up too. This is not my favorite style of beer, but I've had much better versions of the style."
""
"Pours a dark amber color with a thin tea-like head. Herbal, grassy and floral hop aromas with a bit of caramel malt. The caramel and roasted malt flavor is stronger than the aroma would let on. The grassy and floral hop mixes with a slightly bitter alcohol taste to ride on top of the sweet roasted malt flavors. Medium-heavy body, a bit of syrupy and oil, low carbonation, and a bitter finish. Another good beer out of this bunch. Maybe a bit on the sweet side for my tastes, but well crafted."
"4/4/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky dark rust color with a half iinch of head. Lots of lacing. Hoppy aroma of grapefruit and tropical fruits. Some malts as well. The flavor is hoppy grapefruit. Not as tropical as the aroma but more of a citrus hop flavor. Grapefruit bitterness at the end. Slightly boozey. Decent malt backbone. Creamy mouthfeel. Great hoppy Red Ale. Overall, great beer."
""
"The body is a bit heavy with good carbonation. Overall this one is mediocre. It's fair enough, but my least favorite so far of the beer camps."
""
""
"O - An interesting brew. Reminds me of a Founders Breakfast Stout in some ways except the emphasis is on citrus, caramel and chocolate. Definitely worth trying."
"Overall - I think this is a solid brew. Lots of flavors for the enjoyer to figure out and keep you wondering. Not boring by any means. Sweet, bitter, roasty with enough alcohol warmth. What a great brew this is!"
""
"This is an easy to drink red ale. It's solid and balanced, but unfortunately it's not very flavorful. It's malty with some light hoppiness. It's good and worth trying, but unfortunately, I won't have this again."

"O - Reds usually aren't my thing, but I liked this one a lot."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a solid brew. Tasty and drinkable, I wish this had a little more hoppiness to balance this one out better though."
""
"Nothing fantastic, but its a good solid Impy Red."
"This is medium to full bodied. There is a nice full mouthfeel to go with the lively carbonation. This is pretty good. Nothing super special, but it strikes a unique balance between malt and hops."
"The body was nice full and the beer was a bit sharp across the tongue, mostly from the hops. In a bit of a dichotomy, the had a sweet, but still dry, finish. Drinkability was good, I'd have a couple if I saw it on tap. Overall, a good brew, a nice change of pace from Sierra Nevada's usual hop assault. Might make a nice yearly seasonal release. Worth trying if you see it."
"Overall nice change of pace very good drinker quite the change of pace from a red"
"Overall: This isn't a very well balanced beer. The harshness of the bitter flavors was too much. I don't think I'd want another."
